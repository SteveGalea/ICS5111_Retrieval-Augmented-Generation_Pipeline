{"summary": "AA Ritchie*, P Clarke, P Collier, A Grabowska Cancer Biology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom. we grow human tumors in immunodeficient mice such as CD-1 nude. the supplement was delivered by subcutaneous slow-release pellets. however, due to supply issues with the 5-DHT pellets, we had to develop another way to provide this hormone. administration via diet provides a simple solution for oral drug delivery. it is easily transferable to a broad range of animal models requiring regular oral dosing of substances such as stimulation of transgenic models. it is a major refinement in welfare terms by reducing the need for invasive implants or injection regimes. surgery and 21 of them (10%) had noncompliance issues identified between 01/01/2016 and 06/30/2018. only 3 of the 21 labs had never had a PASSR. the average number of days elapsed from the time of training to the time at which we identified a noncompliance issue was 705. using radio frequency identification for electronic study tracking, researchers can create a complete and accurate record for each individual. tracking can start before any dosing begins, as far back as weaning. using this technology we were able to track groups of research animals starting with the implantation of a medical device and vascular catheters until necropsy. all of our dogs are purpose-bred and enter our colony around 6-9 months of age. all of our dogs are purpose-bred and remain until study termination or a pre-determined retirement date (4.25 years of age). over the past 2 y we have placed heavy emphasis on increased quality human interactions and training with our dogs. microsampling was used to reduce blood collection amount. TK time points were conducted at 0, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose on day 1 and day 7. mice were housed 5 per cage, and facilities staff completed cage/water bottle changes. observations were recorded daily with respect to fighting, separations, and deaths as a result of fighting, for up to 433 d. laboratory rodent housing environments can have a significant impact on the animals\u2019 welfare and affect the overall quality of research. there are several options for rodent cage types, bedding, and enrichment available today. a total of 56 animals, 7 groups (RO, jugular, saphenous, tail nick, isoflorane, and nave) with 8 animals per group were collected at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 120 min, 160 min, 240 min, and 1440 min. the PK curve was similar across collection sites to include the comparison of serial versus serial. jugular collection required fewer attempts per sample with decreased bruising. novel tail collection method had the fewest attempts per sample. jugular blood draws and novel alternative of tail bleeding are acceptable approaches. liver biopsies have proven a minimally invasive, well tolerated, and safe method for repeated biopsy collection from the liver in nonhuman primates. we evaluated breeding performance of C57BL/6J mice by comparing 2 different contact bedding types: 40 IVC cages on aspen chip and 40 IVC cages on corn cob. home cage versus induction chamber is better at decreasing potential distress. behavioural assessment of jumping, digging, rearing, and sniffing were compared between groups. no significant differences between animals euthanized in the home cage compared to those euthanized in the induction chamber. our rats\u2019 hands-on training has maintained a 0 rat-bite incident record ever since. our rats\u2019 hands-on training has also maintained a 0 rat-bite incident record ever since. a surgical record accompanies each cage of mice for at least 10 d following any procedure requiring anesthesia. a small-time investment provides an excellent opportunity for postapproval monitoring and ongoing communication between the veterinarian and technical staff. training has increased efficiencies in workflow, increasing self-worth and empowering employees for future advancement. the beagle Freedom Bill requires public funding research institutions to offer adoptable research cats and dogs to nonprofit rescues. this began a movement of public participation in governing the disposition of research animals. multiple states have passed similar laws, including new york and Connecticut. to simplify and streamline the process, we have created an electronic calculator in Microsoft Excel for aggregating and totaling animals required per experimental aim as well as per overall animal use protocol. arithmetic and study design errors may result in animal use beyond what is necessary to achieve research objectives. we hoped to expand the length of time an animal could be sampled on an ABS system without having to increase animal numbers. combined an ABS system with a miniaturized vascular access port (mVAP) this combination made it possible to collect blood samples from awake, freely moving Sprague-Dawley (n=6) rats over a 28-d study. IACLAM helps represent over 1,400 LAM specialists worldwide in four colleges of LAM to the scientific community, government bodies, and public. previous mission-related projects included generating results from a survey of trends and practices by diplomates across the globe. survey identified challenges facing LAM such as euthanasia, transportation, cage space needs, rehoming research animals. sewn pocket restrainer provides restraint appropriate for procedures such as subcutaneous injections, tail vein injections/blood collections, intraperitoneal injections, and blood collections from the pedal or saphenous veins. it took an average of approximately 30% longer to restrain 6 rats in the towel compared to the sewn restrainer. traditional methods to reduce/eliminate host interference include wound care, analgesics, topical and systemic antibiotics and antihistamines, systemic sedatives and tranquilizers. some of these strategies have proven ineffective and often capable of replacing traditional methods. the care taker\u2019s ability to assign the correct BC scores significantly improved after simulation training compared to lecture-only training. a post-study survey was conducted to obtain the pros and cons of training with the SD. twelve male rabbits were individually housed for the duration of the study. they were offered a choice from typical substrates available to laboratory rabbits. they were then able to access each substrate via a weighted entry door. time spent in each cage was recorded over 20 h, including the dark phase. over 120 facilities have signed up to the Concordant of Openness initiative. each organization must demonstrate its commitment to being open about animal research. this includes raising awareness of the inclusion of animals to the public and our work colleagues. ARS encompasses prospective strategy and span style=\u201dbackground-color:rgb(246, 213, 217)\u201d>uses /span>iterative learnings from retrospective evaluations. this allows determination of best-quality models, driven by preclinical-clinical continuity and translational relevance and pathobiology of clinical disease. AMSTs consisting of multidisciplinary scientists, providing capability, expertise, and experience leveraged to determine translational modeling pathways. pig Surgical Wound Infection JM Wilson*1, JA Henn2, J Fernandez2 1Laboratory Animal Medicine, Janssen Research and Development, Spring House, PA. some reports are in vitro studies or unrelated in vivo studies. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) have also been shown to inhibit the growth of bacteria. analgesics can be used and should be tested in specific animal models before withholding analgesics and assigning a protocol a USDA Category E status. over the past 2 y our facility has undergone a rapid expansion of existing research facilities resulting in 2 new geographically distinct vivaria. the MLAS is designed as an international, English-language, part-time course. the blended learning concept incorporates attendance blocks for practical skills training. the curriculum contains modules addressing ethics and legislation in relation to the use of laboratory animals. in vitro and ex vivo techniques are taught during practical skill courses. this should facilitate the qualification of persons responsible for directing animal experiments. however, standard restraint devices may not work for all mice. a standard practice is the training of animal care and research staff so they are experienced and competent when working with animals. one of the procedures in which workers must be trained is on the euthanasia of research animals at the endpoint of a study. atypical approach to a challenge with catheter management arose with socially housed rats for behavioral and addiction studies. rats were surgically implanted with an intravenous catheter with cannula to prepare for a drug self-administration study, then group-housed. despite the initial failure of the plastic cap, a new in-house cap was refined and implemented as a low-cost replacement. tobiotic caging facility filmed technicians performing assigned tasks, such as aseptic cage change within a biosafety cabinet. supervisor-technician teams would then compare identified breaks in asepsis or high-risk behaviors that were deemed likely to lead to a break in asepsis they separately noted from films. the individuals with the top 3 scores are bestowed prizes that consist of an award certificate along with 3 different attractive selections for first place, 2 for second and 1 for third place. the moral towards obtaining the certifications beyond requirements has increased. over 70% of the staff actively participate in the program at one point or another. the 5Es of training provides a framework for trainers. the 5Es focus on key developmental categories which aim to increase employee buy-in and motivation for achievement of certifications and promotions. education would include daily duties, continuing education, and new study protocols, for example. countries a Ezz Elarab2, A Badr1, H Khairy4, N Awad5, A Refaat3, K Gaafar*1 1Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. in developing countries the newly implemented IACUCs are encountering many obstacles and difficulties. ultrasound machine used to determine pregnancy in time-mated mice. if done incorrectly palpating can cause discomfort to the female or in some cases hurt the pups. subcutaneous and intramuscular injections are frequently used methods of sedation in swine, and are considered as causing brief pain or distress. despite positive reinforcement, over time we observed vocalizing, hiding, escape, and snapping behavior resulting from repeat injections in miniature swine requiring weekly sedation. the ratio of 1 male to 1 female is a crucial parameter used to optimize the number of fertilized embryos and the most efficient use of animals. the results indicate there is no significant difference (p>0.05) between the one-to-one or the one-to-two male to female ratio. gers2 1Center for Comparative Medicine and Surgery, Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, New York, NY; 2Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY; 3Department of Veterinary Resources, New York University, N, NY The best enrichment and behavior management programs extract and implement novel ideas from other institutions. the club is open to anyone in the lab animal community that has a passion for animal welfare. continuous monitoring of behavioral, and physiological conditions (motion, breathing, etc.) could provide valuable insight into disease process and increase statistical power. we hypothesize that continuous monitoring of motion and breathing rate could reduce the overall number of animals needed for an experiment. the public is commonly misinformed by animal rights activists, advocates, and public figures who preach against the accomplishments derived from animal science and research. we educate members of the animal science and biomedical research communities that they can use social media in response to a public figure\u2019s post or paid advertisement without a conflict of interest to one\u2019s institute or the science being conducted. mice used snip method to assess sample quality, collection time, and animal welfare concerns. each technique had 3 groups, 1 without a heat source, 1 with a heat lamp, and 1 using a slide warmer to aid vasodilation. mice will engage in active behaviors including nesting and grooming. mice experiencing distress or pain will be less active. measuring rodent activity historically relied on imprecise observational and discontinuous methods. urine is a commonly collected sample used to assess a variety of drug/therapy combinations, as well as evaluate disease progression in the animal model. we used mice as our model because their small size often makes urine collection by standard methods difficult. however, our greater target volume is more than a mouse will voluntarily micturate. animal ID procedures are considered to be relatively noninvasive and therefore not typically taken into consideration in the overall experimental design. we performed retrospective analysis on data gathered during the acclimation period (3-14 d prior to study start) swine intubation is technically difficult as a result of the pig\u2019s oral anatomy and presence of excess tissue in the oropharyngeal region. standard intubation techniques involve using the laryngoscope blade to position the epiglottis such that the vocal cords can be visualized. a standardized electronic postapproval monitoring form was created to streamline the PAM process. this simple PDF form can easily be customized to any site-specific needs and processed via any email provider or even integrated into a content management system. the ePAM is completed by the IACUC designee during an annual administrative protocol review and critical sections reflected for review. the IACUC designee reflects PAM results on ePAM and resubmits to PI/designee to initiate any required protocol amendments. the results are (1) simplified documentation, (2) faster completion time, (3) increased PI engagement, and most importantly, a reduction in identified protocol inconsistencies. a move towards sex parity in rodent research would reduce the numbers of animals produced but not put to research use. the nature of breeding is that generally equal numbers of males and females are produced for each line, but sex bias in usage means a large percentage of one sex may not be used experimentally. tether/swivel system was infused at a continuous rate of 0.3 mL/hr for approximately 12 wk. tether/swivel system eliminated contact irritation previously associated with the jacket/harness. tension caused the port to tilt and the skin around the port to be pulled. the animal procurement process can be effectively managed with an electronic database that simplifies the attending veterinarian\u2019s role to approve animal vendors. a multiteam approach with clearly defined roles can simplify the animal procurement process while still maintaining the highest of standards. trainers are able to share ideas and offer suggestions that have worked in different scenarios. this global approach to problem-solving for PRT challenges has resulted in a forum for trainers with various experience and knowledge to freely share information. the pens allowed for vertical climbing opportunities, hiding opportunities, and structures allowing for establishing mini-territories if the cats so chose. observations included full use of the pen structure by the cats, no apparent social conflict or sickness behaviors, fewer injuries to the handlers during both receipt and handling procedures. this caging will be recommended as standard for cats at our facility in the future. the submental (chin) blood collection method will have lower histopathology scores than submandibular (cheek) and would provide a refined method of blood collection when multiple collections are needed. we used 28 male mice split into groups based on blood collection method. weekly farm rounds were conducted by a dedicated veterinarian and a licensed veterinary technologist. a spreadsheet was used to record once weekly summaries, but ultimately became cumbersome. to improve our approach, the LVT was trained in database design and created a records database which has been used for more than 10 y. a binder was created by the training department that contains educational material. the binder accompanies all new hires to their assigned facility. managers and trainers find it convenient to have all the training materials at their fingertips. experimental device (ED) was developed to reduce needle insertion force, tissue damage, and potentially animal distress. previous rodent studies demonstrated that an oscillated needle yielded blood samples with lower plasma corticosterone levels, improved sampling success, and reduced tissue trauma. 62.3% of ED collections caused minimal tissue damage (scores 0-2). 62.3% of ED collections caused minimal tissue damage. only 31.2% and 37.5% of control and noise collections were in this range. study design and outcome measures were highly variable. of 18 outcomes evaluated, changes were inconsistent or poorly differentiated between treatments. there is insufficient evidence to permit an unbiased assessment of the impact of a single exposure to CO2 inhalation for euthanasia. compatible pairs of macaques were gradually acclimated from unpaired to paired feeding. this was successfully accomplished in approximately 3 wk by gradually decreasing the time of unpaired food access until the animals were no longer separated during feeding. four groups of 6 adult, female, ICR mice were placed in a chamber either that was or was not prefilled with isoflurane. isoflurane gas with 100% oxygen was then introduced at 2 different flow rates. group A, 2% isoflurane with 0.5L/min oxygen; B, 4% isoflurane with 4L/min oxygen; and D, prefilled induction chamber with the rate of group B. we ran a trial study over 9 d to observe 10 alternative options for enrichment. three primary types of malleable enrichment were used: tissues, crinkle paper discs, and enrichment squares. each of the 10 groups was assigned a combination of 1 or more of the materials. sanctuaries have full-time veterinarians, access to multiple diagnostic tools, and medications. research environments have full-time veterinarians, access to multiple diagnostic tools, and medications. one may be skeptical that sanctuaries have the resources to provide this quality of care. sentinel cages were used as a primary component of the rodent health surveillance monitoring program. a grading scale was developed for sentinel cages to provide a guideline for training and set a consistent standard for animal care staff working with sentinel cages. individuals that received excellent scores for sentinel cages for 4 consecutive quarters was named a Sentinel Superstar. the OLAW definition of a significant change resulted in frequent full committee review meetings for our IACUC. the results of implementing the Veterinary Verification and Consultation (VVC) policy exceeded our expectations. each submission handled under the VVC policy saves approximately 2.75 review hours equating to a $40,000 savings in the last 6 mo in 2017. dilatative cardiomyopathy and atrial thrombosis have been reported in a genetically modified mouse breeding colony. the condition affected several strains of both sexes and different ages. extensive testing failed to ascertain the cause. a naive, 4-y-old, 5 kg female cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was found to have a focal, spherical, firm, subcutaneous mass on the proximal aspect of the nasal bone slightly right of midline. radiographs of the skull did not identify abnormal pathology and CBC/chemistry were within normal reference intervals. cynomolgus monkey reported a mesenchymal cell neoplasia in the nasal bone of a cynomolgus monkey. histologic appearance of the mass revealed a disorganized, hypocellular matrix of collagen and spindeloid cells with the presence of blood vessels and chondrocytes. coccus thoraltensis has been shown to be a commensal bacterium of the vaginal flora of swine. it has not yet been determined to be a commensal of the murine reproductive tract. there is significant concern that S. thoraltensis may be an opportunistic pathogen in the mouse reproductive tract. twinning is the most frequent reproductive pattern seen within a common marmoset breeding colony. it is not uncommon to witness single births and triplets in a family group. cross-fostering any offspring to another female marmoset who has given birth within a close time frame has proven to be an effective alternative to euthanasia. two 6-mo-old, female chinchillas presented with large, round, firm, nonmobile, subcutaneous masses. the first chinchilla was experimentally nave had a mass in the left submandibular region approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. the second chinchilla had 2 masses in the left axillary region both approximately 3 cm in diameter. a necropsy was performed to confirm abscesses, followed by bacterial culture, antibiotic sensitivity testing, and histologic assessment. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus was isolated from the abscesses. a 22-y-old male castrated pigtail macaque presented with focal swelling on the left side of the face on routine physical exam. the swelling was located 1 cm lateral to the nasal bridge and 2 cm ventral to the orbit, was firm on palpation. radiographs revealed a radiopaque lesion in the nasal cavity adjacent to the apex of the maxillary canine tooth. euthanasia was elected after consultation with specialists in bone pathology and head and neck tumors. final diagnosis was a cystic adenoid carcinoma of the minor salivary glands. a second female from the same shipment was euthanized and diagnostic necropsy performed due to similar clinical signs, including wheezing inspiratory sounds in the lungs. both cases were diagnosed as acute hemorrhagic pneumonia with edema caused by an extra-intestinal E. coli infection. rabbit was covered in plastic food wrap over the abdomen and thorax. each procedure lasted on average 120 min. the rabbits in group 1 had an average body temperature of 101.0\u00b0F. 11 of 12 rats seroconverted and no virus was detected by PCR in feces or multiple target tissues. the findings confirmed subclinical disease with seroconversion and transient virus shedding in immunocompetent rats. the use of drugs with longer durations can be beneficial by reducing the number of times the animal needs to be restrained and potentially less stressed. however, there are several negative side effects of opioid or sustained-release opioid use in this species. a 12-y-old, female, SPF rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) housed in an indoor-outdoor breeding group presented to the clinic for complete right arm lameness of 3-d duration. no clinical progress or parturition was noted. placentae have been reported in up to 9.5% of rhesus macaque births. placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality in human medicine. loupes can increase target size up to 8 times and provide visual focus. loupes have greatly enhanced visibility for veins injected repeatedly. condition of tail declines with each injection, and magnifying the vein helps increase accuracy. systemic absorption of 10% topical phenylephrine solution has previously been reported in human pediatric patients. 3 cases of pulmonary edema were reported in the africa green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) following administration of topical 10% phenylephrine HCl solution. wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) is one of the biggest problems in captive marmoset colonies. molecular mechanisms, biochemical markers for accurate diagnosis, and a reliable treatment remain unknown. six marmosets received tranexamic acid therapy with supportive measures for 8 wk. the body weight, hematocrit values, and serum albumin levels significantly increased. tranexamic acid therapy may be a new and useful treatment. a group of n=5 wild-type ferrets at a known gestational age underwent a laparotomy. each uterine horn was exposed, allowing complete visualization of the number of embryos present. the fetus underwent intraventricular injection through the uterine wall, followed by electroporation. the jill was allowed to recover and deliver kits vaginally. umbilical vein catheters were placed temporarily the day of c-section. this method was highly favorable and more successful because of the multiple implications presented while using long-term central lines. this method was highly favorable and more successful because of the multiple implications presented while using long-term central lines. electronic records were generated at the end of each anesthetic procedure. they included notations regarding preoperative evaluation, anesthetic plan, routine vital signs, complications noted during the procedure, and recovery quality. use of the program also aided billing accuracy and efficiency. axolotls with skin lesions (n=2) and newts with bloating and lethargy (n=2) were selected for experimental treatment with itraconazole baths (0.0025%; 5 min SID x 10 d), which were well tolerated. PCR results after treatments (at 1 wk and 1 mo post) were negative. itraconazole submersion protocol appears to be successful treatment for B. dendrobatidis in laboratory-maintained colonies of A. mexicanum and T. granulosa. male Gottingen minipig presented with bilateral ear erythema at the apical margins 4 h post repetitive auricular venipuncture. pig had open cage bar communication with conspecifics. clinical pathology revealed a regenerative anemia, low hemoglobin, marked thrombocytopenia, elevated ALT, AST, GGT, and albumin. pig was euthanized due to poor study candidacy and disease severity. pathogenesis is unknown but suspected to be a Type 3 hypersensitivity reaction causing degenerative vasculopathy with arteriosclerosis as a distinctive feature. humanized mice are immunodeficient mice engrafted with human cells, tissues, or most commonly, human immune systems. the different factors involved in creating humanized mice also affect the onset and development of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) mouse was housed on an autowater rack with ad libitum access to standard rodent chow in a room with a 12:12 light:dark cycle. no other mice in the cage were affected. eosinophilic inflammation in the skin, lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, lung, heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys is likely strain-related due to the inflammatory pathways that are disrupted by the Casp8 and Rip3 mutations. this is the first known reported incidence of spontaneous disease. atypical presentation of P. pneumonotropica is due to its effect on immunocompetent individuals and historically clinical signs only present in immunocompromised. we performed a study to evaluate use of a ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine cocktail. 35 [5.7%] DF failed to achieve a plane of surgical anesthesia than is typical with TBE at our facility (0.34%) ibuprofen in drinking water reduces Paw Swelling and improves wellbeing in a mouse model of postsurgical pain. heat stimulus (nociceptive reflex), running wheel activity (operant wellbeing assay) and swelling of the injured paw (local inflammatory oedema measured using a plethysmometer) ibuprofen (0.4mg/mL; n=11) resulted in approximately 100 mg/kg/day ibuprofen imbibed by a 30 g mouse. the frog was anesthetized with MS222 for further assessment. the swelling appeared to be the cranial end of an approximately 2 x 0.25 cm, smooth, firm, oval mass. the frog was subsequently euthanized for oocyte harvest and complete necropsy. owl monkeys form monogamous pairs that live in small family groups with their subadult offspring. owl monkeys housed for research are often maintained in male-female pairs or small families. mice were irradiated with 1 Gy, followed with engraftment of human leukemia cells. PDX implanted mice within the room, and a separate room of NSGS weanlings were subsequently affected. litis with crypt abscesses, superficial enterocyte necrosis, and apically adherent coccobacilli. PCR identified enteroinvasive (Einv) toxin, believed to represent Escherichia coli, from small intestine and colon. NSGS mice were depopulated, while the NSG mice were placed on enrofloxacin and allowed to complete the experiment with in-room decontamination. group 1 consisted of 80 rabbits that were separated for surgery. group 2 consisted of 82 rabbits, which wore 0to 3-mo-old sized human infant pants solely as postsurgical protection. infant pants were replaced with replacement human infant pants or an e-collar. baseline time to consumption (TTC) was recorded in 36 rats prior to surgery. they were then ovariectomized (n=27) or received anesthesia only (n=9). after surgery, the rats were given 1 h for recovery before 4 pieces of cereal were dropped into the 4 corners of the cage. aging rats have developed a multimodal approach to prevent and treat pododermatitis in aging rats. the multimodal therapy was effective to prevent severe lesions and heal pododermatitis in aging rats. zebra finches are given intramuscular meloxicam (a selective COX-2-inhibiting NSAID) for enhanced multimodal analgesia. meloxicam doses range from 0.5-3.0 mg/kg by various routes. zebra finches are passerines, in contrast to birds that have already been investigated. currently recommended dose of 1 mg/kg will need to be administered more frequently than once a day to maintain optimal plasma concentrations. injectable administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) requires repeated restraint. in swine, endotracheal tube size in comparison to the size of the animal is much smaller than ET tube sizes commonly used in other domestic animals. a direct comparison of body weight can accurately be used to predict ET tube size for the intubation of domestic swine. weight (kg), endotracheal tube sizes, intubation attempts, positioning for intubation (dorsal, lateral, ventral) and SpO2 measurements were collected from each swine during intubation. the swine used in both cohorts were SPF Yorkshire crosses and standard farm pigs of various breeds. combination of butorphanol tartrate, azaperone tartrate, and medetomidine hydrochloride (BAM) took approximately 1-1.5 h. each animal was given 0.02 ml/kg of BAM IM. each animal was given 0.02 ml/kg of BAM IM. the hands and feet was diagnosed in 17 colony rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) the age at diagnosis ranged from 3 to 10 y with an average onset of 6 y. a psoriasiform pattern was evident on microscopic examination. female cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) socially housed in same-sex peer group. multilocular mass with compartments of hypoechoic (fluid) or mixed echogenicity contents. a barium series confirmed the mass was extragastrointestinal and suggested adjacent organ displacement. a 6.5-y-old, 830 g, spayed, trio-housed female laboratory ferret was evaluated with a reported history of decreased activity level. the animal had been employed in neurobehavioral studies, where it served to provoke predator-based stress in a rodent model of posttraumatic stress disorder. the splenomegaly was attributable to red pulp extramedullary hematopoiesis. the adrenal mass was a cortical adenoma. the gastric and mesenteric lymphadenopathy was due to lymphoid hyperplasia. animals were monitored for signs of pain at 1-h intervals for the first 12 h, 2-h intervals for the second 12 h, then 24-h intervals thereafter, for a total of 4 to 6 wk. the animals gained body weight and showed mobility within 3 d after the operation. seminiferous tubules were diffusely atrophied, with irregular, undulant basement membranes, lined by a single layer of Sertoli cells. subsequent autopsy of the remaining cohort found a second barrow with an intraabdominal testis. this animal did not manifest any behavioral changes seen in the first pig. the neoplastic spindle cells were located within the submucosa of the gastric cardia and infiltrated into the gastric wall with expansion into the peritoneum. on immunohistochemistry, the neoplasm was negative for pancytokeratin and positive for vimentin. the neoplasm was negative for pancytokeratin and positive for vimentin. differential diagnoses for weight loss include parasites, mycobacterium-associated granulomatous intestinal disease, nitrogenous or heavy metal toxicosis, neoplasia, and viral infection. animal was removed from recirculating system and placed in static housing for closer monitoring. within 1 wk the frog died. a retrospective analysis was performed on baseline clinical chemistry and hematology (42 parameters) obtained from 64 nave purpose-bred 2.5-3.6-y-old macaques 3 wk after arrival. no biologically significant generational differences in hematological or serum chemistry parameters in F1 versus F2 animals. a 5-y-old male rhesus macaque presented for acute visual impairment. the animal was assigned to a neuroscience study. the animal was euthanized and submitted for a postmortem examination. cerebral strokes are the fifth leading cause of death and primary cause of long-term disabilities for adults in the united states. ischemic cerebral stroke should be considered as a differential for NHPs presenting with acute neurological signs or ocular deficits. vesicular stomatitis, and Seneca virus A are clinically indistinguishable from each other. the regional USDA office was contacted and vesicular fluid and tissue, as well as a blood sample, were collected for diagnostic testing. the cause of the vesicle in this swine was not determined. the results for AST and bacterial contamination plating were provided by a diagnostic laboratory, allowing for an objective evaluation. the results were supported by the results; a multiuse approach is possible without sacrificing efficacy or patient safety. Thousands of microchips are currently implanted in a wide variety of species, including laboratory animals, for identification purposes each year. adverse reactions to microchips occasionally occur, including migration, postinjection swelling, infection, functional failure, or even complete loss from the body. the meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius) is currently used to study metabolism during periods of hibernation and very cold temperatures at our institution. the meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius) is not commercially available nor bred by other researchers. a retrospective analysis of clinical cases and necropsy reports has been compiled for the previous 14 mo in an effort to better understand the species and its particular veterinary health challenges. a myriad of age-related health issues, primarily cancers, have been observed due to their longevity in captivity versus wild meadow mice. swab performed on a sedated animal is comparable to the fecal microbiome profile. feces were sampled from transport cages with a sterile swab. rectal swabs were obtained from the sedated animal. PD is a common health condition in aging rats used for behavioral studies. treatment includes nail trims, with or without multi-wave locked system (MLS) laser therapy, and/or placement on a commercially available variable paper-free bedding. MLS laser therapy offers similar advantage to placement on paper-free bedding. size and severity of the PD lesions along with placement on paper-free bedding were the most predictive measures of treatment success. rabbit model was used to assess pharmacokinetics and ocular and systemic toxicity following intraarterial carboplatin infusion. melphalan and carboplatin combination therapy can cause orbital fibrosis. the severity of this adverse consequence in rabbits was unexpected and its use in the study was discontinued. we suspect species-specific features may have contributed to amplified complications. in damaged sperm with low motility rate (14.6%), we incubated the suspension for 20 min with or without H2. we found that H2 markedly improved the fertilization rate (59.2%) users can browse content across the entire site via text search, document type, species referenced, and/or topic. each document is broken down into collapsible accordion list(s) for easier navigation, includes contact and approval information, and an auto-populated list of related documents from across the program. researchers can log in to the website to access protected content, save custom searches, and bookmark documents. each group of serum averaged 1 h and 44 min of additional processing. each group of microsamplers averaged 3 min and 13 s (17.5 s per microsampler); a time savings of approximately 1 h and 41 min. the comparative medicine program husbandry management team (HMT) has used a wireless environmental monitoring system for all animal housing and critical support areas. testing of this approach revealed that any management team member can view real-time washer water temperatures. the coupled notification system was implemented and established thresholds for wash cycle initiation as well as achieving set point temperatures. each cage was given the nesting material for 1 wk. there were no health reports, and no fighting was observed over the 6 wk. shredding scores were significantly higher for mice given BCP alone. animal care staff gave their evaluation of different space allocations of rooms, schematic animal rack layouts, large equipment layouts, workflow charts, surface materials, and storage requirements. in the planning phase of the facility, the animal care staff gave their evaluation of environmental monitoring technology, air-exchange exhaust schematics, and workstation locations and their features. colony management handbook records strain nomenclature, research applications, phenotypical behavior/appearances, and basic husbandry procedures. each cage card lists the strain name and is color-coded to match the handbook information. the system has resulted in better colony management and has become a key factor for efficient use of resources. all rodent drinking water is autoclaved. on day 0, 3 mL, of water was collected from each water bottle. the bottles were added to the rodent cage. peroxide (AHP) based products for the sanitation of electronic devices. we tested the premoistened wipes at a 1-, 3-, and 5-min contact time. the premoistened wipes had the most significant decrease in relative light units with ATP testing overall. effective onboarding promotes employee engagement, builds trust, enhances the quality of work, and increases retention. effective onboarding promotes employee engagement, builds trust, enhances the quality of work, and increases retention. researchers are invited to all-staff meetings to present their projects. they are important to help animal care staff understand their role in the mission of the organization and promotes engagement. a simple assignment promoted inclusion to the team. a, Spironucleus muris, astrovirus, norovirus, mouse minute virus, and pinworms were not detected with the routine bedding sentinel program including pinworm. the regular bedding sentinel setting (1 sentinel cage for 140 cages) was not able to detect this pinworm infestation. additional testing was undertaken to exclude false positive results. in-house produced water pouches remain sterile for at least 30 mo. gnotobiotic animal studies are gaining renewed interest coincident with growing body of research evaluating relationship between microbiome in health and disease. all cages tested negative in weekly in-house aerobic and anaerobic culture tests for a total of 24 wk. the study validated the repurpose of underutilized biocontainment unit (BCU) equipment at our institution for germ-free housing. this housing system allows for both germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse experiments at the cage level. pH of acidified bottles (n=4) and autoclaved acidified bottles (n=4) was recorded before and after autoclaving. samples from day 0 and day 7 were then cultured on blood agar plates. no bacterial growth from any sample undergoing bioburden testing. staff reported decreased levels of environmental dust and odor in the housing rooms. cages bedded with paper-based bedding had an average spot change frequency of 1.76% (0-6.3%) over the measured timeframe. paper-based bedding provides a potential reduction in the spot change frequency of IVC mouse cages. the decision was made to house sheep on the floor on bedding. it takes about half the time for husbandry technicians to clean this room. the flex room encourages more natural herd and grazing behaviors. the voles destroyed the water pouch valve causing floods or dehydration. when the program switched from bottles to the water pouch system, the voles were included. they were successfully moved back to bottles with stainless caps. over 5,000 cages of nonhuman primates have been successfully moved by this method. the department of veterinary resources began rethinking our enrichment program by focusing on species-specific needs. sanitization in vivarium is important for reducing microbial contaminants. sanitization has been verified through traditional microbiological culture methods. ATP can be quantified by measuring the reaction of a surface swab\u2019s contents. vivarium staff followed sanitization procedures more closely resulting in a cleaner macroenvironment. a brief disinfectant wet-contact time and weak dilutions are the main barriers to substandard cleaning. 88% (227/257) of swabs were positive for S. xylosus. 5% of samples with the highest copy number were traced back to their original racks for additional investigation into general population trends. bed fabric is ballistic nylon and has a pouch beneath that allows for insertion of thermal support devices. the beds have been tried for enrichment and/or anesthetic recovery in ferrets, rabbits, turkeys, dogs, and pigs. eighty percent of survey respondents indicated they plan to use the bed again. mice from 2 genetic backgrounds used shelters more frequently than B6 mice. the shelters were used most often by adults and older pups. neonates were kept in a separate nest, suggesting a potential benefit. multiple cases of failure scenarios investigated including plastic membrane seam separation, different rip sizes, and exhaust fan failure. each isolator has a blower motor plus a backup blower motor including battery power in case of electrical failure. modified flexible film isolators with negative airflow proved safe and effective for aerosol studies using BSL-3 select agents. we have isolated several Clostridium spp. including C. perfringens from all batches of our standard rodent diet (NIH-31) we also tested multiple natural ingredient rodent diets and one swine diet (NIH-2004) from other institutions. there have been no reports of its isolation from laboratory animal feeds. eighteen breeder pairs of ICR (good breeders) and SJL (poor breeders) mice were established. the breeder pairs were randomly allocated to 3 different treatment groups. the breeder pairs were followed for 140 d. racks were visually inspected for debris, dust, and rust. different cleaning methods and materials were evaluated for the disinfection of water valves during cage wash and cage change out over an 18-mo time period. ethoxylates (20-30%), sodium xylene sulfonate (1- 3%), fatty acids, C8-18 and C18 unsaturated (1- 3%) and terpene solvent (.1 - 1%) were used to determine effectiveness. a real-time ATP swab test was used to determine effectiveness. vivarium has created a poster depicting mouse pups from age P14 to P28. the poster is now included in the vivarium orientation and training program. chlorine dioxide solution based on a volume per volume comparison. compared the cost that would be associated with each bottle (21 oz) of disinfectants. the hydrogen peroxide solution was filled only when the solution ran out. serial CSF collection is performed every 2 mo with a per entry volume of 2-10l of CSF normally obtained. biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like MS are not easily found in the blood, making it imperative to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to monitor the disease in mice, the spinal cord is collected using a serial sacrifice method and the tissue is used for immunological analyses. reintroductions are attempted whenever nursery-rearing is not required. a successful reintroduction requires exhibition of appropriate behaviors by both dam and infant including affiliation, proper suckling positioning, adequate lactation, and sufficient nursing. animal holding rooms hold multiple ballasts and light tubes which leads to multiple outages, inconsistent light levels, noncompliance, and constant work order submission for bulb replacement. animal care staff noted increased algae growth in the Xenopus laevis holding tanks. light filters and ballast modulators are being investigated as ways to reduce blue light emission from the LEDs reaching the tanks. the use of filters may allow for the continued use of the LED lighting without resulting in increased algae growth. thirty-nine isolators were used to monitor the daily inspection of both the left-hand and right-hand of the gloves using this new method for approximately 7 mo. the new method to protect the gloves has proved to be successful. Sprague Dawley rat breeding cages were housed according to our internal (1 x 1; 120 in2 per animal) the number of pups born and weaned was recorded, as well as pup and parental morbidity, mortality, ammonia, clinical conditions, animal behavior, and cage cleanliness. facility managers routinely over ordered consumables which exacerbated restricted storage capacity and impacted an already tight budget. a purchase order (PO) is automatically generated and sent to the vendor. the institution carries the cost of the asset until the asset is distributed. organic load was significantly reduced compared to animal facility entrances. swabs were taken at facility entrances and within animal rooms weekly for 6 wk. floor contamination control strategies help reduce organic load in rodent IVC facilities. a yearlong course designed to give each candidate skills required for leadership responsibilities. a few of the resources include human resource classes, seminars, case studies, and tours of other facilities. the success of our leadership program is measured in multiple ways. xenoestrogens mimic estrogen and can disrupt normal reproductive physiology in mammals. xenoestrogens are used as the base material for the synthesis of thermoplastics including polycarbonate and polyethylene. a biocontainment procedure for the transport of zika virus-infected macaques was developed. it is recommended that facilities test their water delivery systems to determine EA and xenoestrogens within the water supplied to their animals. a biocontainment procedure was fabricated consisting of 2 parts; the primary interior cage and the secondary exterior cage. other biocontainment procedures included mosquito traps at the facility entrance, air curtains installed at each of the loading dock entrances. additional mosquito netting prevented any mosquitos from entering the back of the truck while the door was opened to load/unload the bio-transport cage. autoclaving is one of the most common methods of decontaminating biohazardous materials for purposes of biosafety. a literature search indicates there are several other acceptable decontamination methods. rodent sentinel screening is an integral part of all biomedical research institutes and universities that use rodents in research. we wanted to investigate the possibility of keeping sentinel animals in-house for periods of 12 versus 3 mo at a time. mice exposed at 38-40 wk of age were able to seroconvert to MNV. mice first exposed at 8-12 wk of age were exposed at 8-12 wk of age. this practice can be combined to increase sensitivity and specificity of rodent surveillance programs. our conventional facility will house African pygmy hedgehogs for an investigator. the PI and our trainers held training sessions for the staff. the hedgehogs have been housed for 8 wk in the current setup. they have spaces for hiding as well as exercise. the new enrichment program included increasing the frequency and variety of fresh food offerings as well as encouraging foraging via novel toys and/or devices on an established rotational schedule. there was an almost immediate decrease in health reports of fight wounds and/or decreased feather loss in the cages by approximately 62%. inflammatory Cytokines Support Extended Cage-change Frequency for singleton rats in individually ventilated caging. the guide recommends solid-bottom caging be changed weekly, but allows for the flexibility to establish facility- and equipment-specific standards. a large percentage of our rat population is singly housed due to scientific need. corvids are a species of bird that has been proven to be extremely smart and require a great deal of mental stimulation while in captivity. the current budget for the corvid colony is limited, which has driven staff to become more creative. the rabbit condo was made in-house and allowed animals to exercise, forage and assume normal body postures in a novel and safe space. this new approach was retained as part of the environmental enrichment program in both laboratories in North America. the rabbit condo is an enrichment system developed from recycled outdated equipment. the entire sump of the circulating frog system in our laboratory was discovered drained. a technician discovered large pools of water covering the housing space floor. the sump was nearly empty and the housing cages were excessively soiled with debris. veterinary assistance was sought as the team began to come up with a solution to preserve the water quality. gamma irradiation is considered a convenient and reliable method of sterilization of medical supplies and irregularly shaped particles such as pelleted chow. the FDA has approved exemptions for the use of higher levels of irradiation (35 kGy minimum) in feed for certain research facilities. irradiation has not been identified for germ-free work and most irradiator sources can only guarantee a minimum exposure level and not a maximum level. careful consideration on size and density of packaging should be considered to mitigate uneven gamma penetrance and exposure that can occur during processing. chlorine-based sterilants have the widest margin of safety in respect to the bactericidal and sporicidal activity in vitro, were the most rapid-acting. hydrogen peroxide-based sterilants can be effective alternatives, as are generally more cost effective but more corrosive to acrylic surfaces. the guide recommends changing static open topped cages every week and individually ventilated cages (IVCs) every 2 wk, with considerations granted for the use of wire bottom or perforated-bottom caging. the vendor A system operates on 60 air changes per hour (ACH) and a 14-d cage change interval. ammonia levels were measured by an electrochemical sensor and wireless metal-oxide-semiconductor type sensors. the sensors were tuned to record an ammonia value once every 3 h over the course of a 6-mo long study. the pole and collar training process for Chlorocebus monkeys was very different than our normal pole and collar training procedure in macaques. the stoic nature of the Chlorocebus monkeys tended to show little to no facial, vocal, or body cues during the training. current enrichment standards for other laboratory rodents may be inappropriate for the social, physical, and mental wellbeing of gerbils. gerbils are divided into 3 study groups as follows: 1) baseline enrichment (given once during weekly cage change, consisting of 1 cardboard box or 1 cardboard tube, and 1 dust bath). gloves can harbor bacteria that can be harmful to the nonhuman primate. it has not been established if gloves can be sanitized and remain viable after the decontamination process. VAV systems allow ventilation rates to be set in accordance with heat load and other variables. a multiplexed IAQ sensing device was used as input device for VAV control. vivarium was transitioning from older to newer caging units. cage wash staff produced 6-8 different types of caging equipment. cage wash staff now communicate effectively and work efficiently. multiple layers of protective gloves worn during mouse handling and restraint can lead to hand fatigue. we have identified specific ear notchers and styles of mouse restraint that are easier to use in the context of the isolators. a scheduled monthly nail trim was performed on 29 rabbits without the rabbit temperament chart posted. the number of times the staff changed restraint due to animal movement was counted. the average handling time per rabbit was reduced by an average of 66.92 sec per rabbit. the \u201cferret futon\u201d uses items that are easily found in most animal facilities. it encourages the ferret to nest, burrow, and hide within the nesting box. we developed a procedure for surgical rederivation and introduce ferret litters into a complete barrier environment. ferrets have successfully fostered to the new jills, and the kits have remained negative for influenza titers as well as other pathogens. this procedure has proved to be a successful method for introducing ferrets into a barrier environment to maintain an SPF health status for studying infectious disease, such as influenza. ferrets are a valuable model in many areas of biomedical research, most notably influenza research and neurobiology. a clear criterion for defining aged (old) mice has not been established. male and female C57BL/6NCrSlc mice (4 wk) were purchased from a vendor every 3 mo and kept over their lifetime. survival rates start to decline at approximately 21 mo. blood test shows that the total WBC count starts to decline at around 18 mo and the composition of WBC tends to change with aging. we will investigate these parameters in detail and continue to search for novel biomarkers (such as fecal IgA levels) research staff were notified of the change and instructed on how to properly care for the laminated cards. Across 20 animal rooms, over 70% of recycle bins are full weekly. this project successfully reduced waste within animal rooms in a simple, cost-effective manner. mice were weighed at the beginning and at 7 wk and monitored during cage changes for general wellbeing. after week 4, testing on these cages was discontinued due to the level of growth on environmental monitoring plates and high relative light units. microbial growth on ventilated cage components remained within acceptable limits for 6 wk. twenty-one participants were asked to trim rear nails on mice using scruffing and tube restraint methods in a randomized order. participants filled out an anonymous survey addressing ease of use and perceived mouse welfare. using a 50 mL conical as a mouse restrainer for nail trims is practical, cost-effective and easy to construct. d strains such as the C57BL/6 mouse are commercially available in the germ-free state from multiple vendors. however, we needed to establish a rapid, efficient, and cost-effective method to rederive mice into the germ-free state. this procedure is done entirely inside a horizontal laminar flow hood. 4 cage sizes (groups 3, 4, 5, 6) across 4 caging types (A to D) each respondent ranked the types in order of preference. cage type A, the only 4-pack design, ranked last overall (44%), particularly amongst husbandry (58%) 91 out of 126 previously active in animal controlled substance administration did not apply for DEA registration. 91 out of 126 previously active in animal controlled substance administration did not apply for DEA registration. a, MD Heath surveillance in rodent facilities typically uses live sentinel animals euthanized at periodic intervals for serology, parasitology, and necropsy evaluation. the alternative testing would provide equivalent results to sentinels. two mouse rooms and 1 rat room with commercially available positive pressure IVC cages with rack filtered air and exhaust through the cage top filter to the plenum were evaluated. a thorough evaluation of occupational incidents is critical to identify issues, guide appropriate interventions, and measure the corresponding response. the occupational health and safety program (OHSP) at an institution is an essential component of its animal care and use program. pes and Registered Disinfectants in the Surgical Suite ST Baker*1, LT Holt-Bright2, A Ingraham3, D Johnson3 1Thoracic Medicine and Surgery (TMS), Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA. ATP technology compared prepared concentrations of potassium peroxymonosulfate, quaternary ammonium, a commercially prepared sanitation wipe, and a commercially available antimicrobial surface wipe. enrichment items encourage species-specific behaviors of swine (foraging and rooting) are limited. toys, foraging balls, and hiding treats in substrates (such as hay) can be used, but do not promote a long interaction time and complicate waste removal processes from animal rooms. the 1/4 in corncob bedding has been associated with a reduced incidence of flooding compared to the 1/8 in both at our and other institutions. two strains of male mice and two stocks of male rats were housed in static, filter top cages with 1 of the 2 bedding types. the 1/4 in bedding has comparable effects as 1/8 in. on ammonia levels and behavior for rats and mice. the larger bedding might be associated with greater damage to the nasal mucosa in rats and should be used with more caution in that species. tracking of IVC racks and live sentinel cages was critical to the success of our sentinel testing. the database is accessible from any workstation, and provides a room location for each rack at the time of the weekly census activity. the implementation of the RFID rack tracking system has made it easier to verify the location of racks in our facilities and know when racks have been relocated. an 11-fold higher level of organic debris (404 RLU) was measured on floors before the mats. a reduction in ATP (38 RLU) was seen on floors directly after walking across the mats. the larger facility mat required cleaning every day. the new flashlight failed to produce a significant statistical change to AA. daily checks using the new procedure could project savings of 6.5 h/d. the results showed a significant reduction in waste without sacrificing cage check quality. the photos are electronically filed in a common use folder. the archived photos remove the need for paper records. the visual nature of these records is providing staff members a self-accountability while ensuring that all tasks are completed as assigned. urine chemistries collected at 8 wk and 12 wk were collected weekly. results suggest mature guinea pigs may benefit from a lower macromineral diet made available from standard research diet manufacturers. breeder cages were relocated from the top row of the housing rack to the bottom row. the cages were exposed to microenvironment disturbances such as foot traffic, noise, and light variances. the change of the housing rack and position resulted in a decreased mating to parturition time. primarily stored outdoors on secondary containment berms in multiple locations. inadequate equipment design led to incidental drips, occasional spills, and rainwater that filled the containment berms over time. twelve pair-housed animals were housed 2 per cage for a total of 6 cages. two cages were provided each type of bedding for a period of 1 wk. each guinea pig was weighed and a brief physical examination performed. the Quatranasia allows for a maximum of 20 mice to be euthanized simultaneously through a gas overdose. the ability to euthanize mice from separate cages at the same time is discouraged, or one-by-one as with a standard euthanasia chamber. the reduced euthanasia time minimizes emotional stress for personnel and is useful for time-sensitive studies. a dedicated breeding colony must maximize breeding output to meet scientific goals. the responsibility for managing >400 active transgenic lines lies with the transgenic colony management (TCM) team. this team effectively interfaces with other vivarium teams including the husbandry staff and veterinary technicians. Embryo transfer was extensively applied in the construction and cryopreservation of gene-modified mice and rederivation of infected rodent strains. the numbers of embryos, which were transferred to the unilateral oviduct of ICR recipients, ranged from 10 to 15. necroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programed cell death, plays a role in the pathogenesis of NEC. we used in vitroculture of intestinal epithelial cell crypts, termed enteroids, to test the effects of 2 variables. hypoxia and exposure to bacterial endotoxin caused an upregulation of necroptosis gene expression. necroptosis is upregulated in NEC and inhibition of this pathway results decreased intestinal inflammation. pharmacological inhibition of this signaling pathway may provide therapeutic options for decreasing the severity of neonatal NEC. repeat intradermal injections for a period of 5 d did elicit increased erythema and edema in rpIL-4 dose sites. peak irritation was observed approximately 5 min after dose administration. perivascular or dermal lymphocytes were observed in 25-38% of rpIL-4 and rpIL-13 dose sites. gingival venipuncture could be used as an alternative blood collection technique in guinea pigs. hematological parameters would be consistent with samples collected from the cranial vena cava. no adverse effects were detected at either site. gingival venipuncture may be used as an alternative blood collection method. a chlorhexidine oral rinse should be considered as an alternative to saline in future studies. control NSG mice (n=5) underwent the described tumor implantation and injections of human T cells and rIL-2 at the same doses. the human MSLN BiTE is effective, over a range of doses, for limiting the growth of PDAs. the association of primate veterinarians recommends aseptic technique when opening cranial chambers. no studies have evaluated whether the use of strict aseptic technique mitigates levels of colonization within chambers. corynebacterium ulcerans and Staphylococcus aureus were most common species identified on culture. partial body irradiation (PBI) model showed classic gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS) after total body irradiation (TBI) at GI doses which is 100% lethal by 10-14 d. 20 5-6-mo-old, male GMP were exposed to either 12 or 16 Gy PBI using 40-50% bone marrow sparing. unEL analyses revealed apoptosis only to a minimal extent at both doses. food tolerance, amino acid absorption, and citrulline production were dose-dependent. apoptosis was lost earlier at 16 Gy compared to 12. non-operated treated and vasectomized-treated mice showed spontaneous locomotion activity similar to what was observed in the CTR group. vTM- vasectomized treated with tramadol, VM- vasectomized treated with meloxicam, and VTML- vasectomized treated with tramadol. genitals were significantly lower in CM (20 mg.kg-1) group in comparison with other groups. tramadol 20 mg.kg-1, meloxicam 10 mg.kg-1 and lidocaine association did not interfere in general activity of these animals. systemic immunosuppression was induced using cyclosporine A (CsA) injected subcutaneously either five weeks after virus infection (modeling reactivation from latency; n=6) or concurrent to viral infection (modeling primary infection; n=4) cyclosporine A (CsA) treatments were administered at 15 mg/kg daily for five days, then at 20 mg/kg twice weekly for two weeks. we administered equal volumes (0.1 ml) of saline or injectable meloxicam at a dose of 20 mg/kg subcutaneously to 8 male young adult C57Bl6 mice daily for 6 d. no gross pathological lesions in the stomach, kidneys, or liver were noted, and complete blood counts and serum chemistries were within normal limits. cross-fostering involves minimal manipulation of the fostered pups. we propose a cross-fostering procedure that requires minimal manipulation. the limited handling is combined with fostering the litter within 18-24 h of birth. transgenic mouse model harboring -MHC promoter driven (loxP)-TRPV4 transgene was bred to the MerCreMer inducible cardiac-specific Cre recombinase driver mouse. cardiomyocytes exhibited expression of the mCherry fluorescent reporter protein prior to tamoxifen treatment. twelve rats were used to compare whole-body perfusion fixation to 2 different immersion fixation methods. 4 rats were collected with all neural tissue remaining intact on the carcass. four additional rats were fixed via whole-body perfusion, with all associated neural tissues collected and exposed post-fixation from all 12 animals. SR-meloxicam is a commonly used and FDA approved nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug in dogs administered orally or subcutaneously every 24 h. a sustained release formulation of meloxicam (SR-meloxicam) has been shown to last up to 72 h in other species. meningitis is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in premature infants. the neonatal immune system has decreased inflammasome signaling compared to adults. but it is unknown what role inflammasome activation plays in NMEC meningitis. mice were assessed based on a pain and distress scale developed for the model. survival data was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier survival log rank. survival data was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier survival log rank. 25 percent soiled bedding was produced by combining 50 parts soiled bedding pet shop mice, 50 parts soiled bedding from an SOPF mouse isolator. one SBS mouse from each cage was submitted monthly for testing by PCR and traditional methods for 3 mo. MHV was detected only in the HE nude CD-1 SBS by both PCR and serology. the outcome of therapeutic treatment success in humans has been linked to the rat GMB. using rats before their GMB has stabilized could impact study results. rats were housed in individually ventilated caging (IVC) systems. icibacter (87%), Caloramator (79%), Clostridium (79%), Bifidobacterium (78%), and Lactobacillus (67%) rat GMB did not stabilize after 3 d and continued to change over time points evaluated in this study. additional time points beyond 21 d may be necessary to determine the time required to stabilize the rat GMB after transport. astrovirus from the research colony has 89% nucleotide homology to another recently reported astrovirus. the largest contig identified was 6,461 bps and contained 47 open reading frames (ORFs) the largest ORF is composed of 824 amino acids. mutant phenotype is the result of a recessive mutation that arose spontaneously from a colony of Swiss mice. mutation has been transferred into C57BL/6 background by successive backcrossing for at least 10 generations. mutation is on chromosome 14 between 33.21 and 38.21 cM. the mutation tremor could be involved into an impairment of the GABAergic transmission. some strains encode virulence factors that enable the bacteria to cause intestinal and extra-intestinal infections. some commensal and pathogenic pks+ and cnf+ strains have been associated with inflammation and cancer in humans and animals. the presence of pks+ or cnf+ E. coli did not correlate with health status. colibactin- and CNF-encoding E. coli colonize laboratory marmosets. rhesus macaques were used following intraventricular administration of Inulin. plasma and CSF inulin PK were evaluated. 3 additional macaques were fasted for 18-22 h. inulin was quantifiable in all pre-dose plasma samples and increased over the sampling period precluding PK plasma interpretation. the dietary evaluation established a mean fasting baseline Inulin of 0.152 ug/ml +/- 0.058. cecal content from 25% (33/133) of the sentinel cages was positive for TM tropozoites. only 8.2% (11/133) of the fecal samples tested positive for TM. pseudocysts were most often found in the fecal samples. ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is an attractive species in which to model preterm brain injury because they are born lissencephalic and develop gyrencephalic brains postnatally. postnatal white matter maturation and complex cortical folding also occur in a similar pattern to that observed in the human brain during the third trimester. aversion, spontaneous righting and walking (righting reflex) were performed 3x/week from P21-P42. a composite behavioral score increased from 2.3 at P21 to 13.0 at P43. injured ferrets displayed a wider base of support (BOS) with the forelimbs relative to the hindlimbs compared to controls (n=14, P = 0.007) despite its use on other sutures, a potential concern existed as to whether the silicone core in this suture could have a deleterious clinical impact. using a porcine model, 2 study groups were created: 1 with suture particles created by rupturing hand tied knots of suture. the other had vitreous carbon particles. flow cytometry biomarkers were developed for characterization of the major populations of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) a novel flow cytometry approach has been developed to characterize the major porcine PBMCs in one single assay. this assay will facilitate immune investigations during nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies. stock solutions (100 mg/mL MS222) were mixed and stored in opaque jars at 4\u00b0C and -20\u00b0C for 2 and 6 mo. stability of the solutions was analyzed using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry and compared to fresh MS222. 100 mg/mL solutions of MS222 can be stored in opaque jars at 4\u00b0C or -20\u00b0C for 6 mo and be used to effectively anesthetize zebrafish. animal models of inflammatory bowel disease are critical and necessary tools for determining the activity, safety, and tolerability of novel drugs before clinical development. tail-tip snip is a common technique to collect small amounts of blood in mice. most commonly this method is performed without the use of anesthetics due to the elevation of glucose. however, there are none evaluating very short-term isoflurane. glucose was measured using a retroorbital technique. after 24 h all mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. glucose was measured using a glucometer. the second method involved the cryopreservation of 5 small fragments. body weights, clinical observations, and tumor volumes were measured weekly. the use of tumor tissue preserved as smaller fragments greatly improved the overall engraftment success of all models tested thus far. temperatures for laboratory mice according to the Guide are 20-26\u00b0C. the additional energy expenditure required for thermoregulation at subthermoneutral housing temperatures may have physiological consequences. the study is to determine whether housing temperatures affect disease progression in mice with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) more than 380 million people worldwide have diagnosed diabetes. hyperphagia and insulin resistance are a central mechanism in obesity. insulin resistance is a central mechanism in obesity and type 2 diabetes. agonist and how might it contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. a novel transgenic mouse model (L44) over-expresses the nonaggregating agonist, [25,28,29triprolyl]-hA. these include pathogenic effects on systemic metabolic regulation. mice warmed on the slide warmer for ten minutes averaged 35\u00b0C. rectal temperatures for mice averaged 36.7\u00b0C compared to 37.06\u00b0C for the electric blanket and 37.2-37.9\u00b0C for the heat lamp. the average bolus dose of bupivacaine administered was 0.42 0.16 mg/kg. the average plasma bupivacaine level was 50.3 48.1 ng/ml. cynomolgus males (n=8) acquired the response faster with a moving stimulus. cynomolgus females (n=8) acquired the response faster with a stationary stimulus. these results suggest that acquisition under conditions of stimulus movement may be differentially affected by sex and the species under study. conventional p19arf knockout mice generated by replacing the exon 1 with Neomycin-resistance (NeoR) gene showed persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), an ophthalmic disease characterized with accumulation of perivascular cells and cataract. however, NeoR has been reported to cause undesirable sideeffects and complicate the manifestation of target gene-related phenotypes, raising a concern on the role of p19arf observed in the KO mice. male SCID Mice as new animal model for inflammatory breast cancer research. JC Illera*1, S Caceres1, G Silvan1, Alonso-Diez1, L Pea2, CC Perez-Garcia3, IC Diez-Prieto3, MJ Illera1 1Animal Fisiology. mice compared to 80% of female mice after 3 and 4 wk of inoculation respectively. male tumors had higher T and SO4E1 levels compared to female tumors. male mice could be useful as a tool for in vivo IBC research. two CARMA2 point mutations associated with psoriasis were created by site-directed mutagenesis. transgenic keratinocytes were infected with lentiviral vector contain CARMA inhibitory serine/threonine kinase to investigate expression levels of NF-kB targeted genes. the optimal dose of protein antigen used for priming and boosting animals depends on a variety of parameters, including immunogenicity of the antigen itself, immunization species, adjuvant, frequency, and route of dosing. a priori how low we can go before adversely affecting total antigen-specific immune response. rat species identified as Rattus norvegicus (11/29; 37.9%) and Rattus rattus (18/29; 62.1%) based on amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. exposure to 11 of 19 (57.9%) pathogens tested in the panel was detected. antibodies to Hantaan virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, toolan\u2019s H-1 virus, mouse adenovirus type 1, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, sendai virus, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi were not detected. the study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. twenty-four of the 29 sentinels were seropositive and 14 of 29 were PCR positive. the results provided direct evidence that MRV originated from the contaminated feed or bedding within the shipping boxes. this is the first report of contaminated materials in shipping boxes. injection sites were dyed with 2% Gentian Violet to quantify microneedle array insertion efficacy by counting individual microneedle insertions. the Yucatan minipig was selected as the preferred minipig model for microneedle evaluation based on high reproducibility of successful injections. the folate hydrolase gene (FOLH1) encodes for the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is highly overexpressed in human IBD where it is associated with robustly increased GCPII enzymatic activity (300-1000%) guinea pigs were administered mirtazapine at 1.88, 3.75, or 7.5 mg orally once daily for 4 d. each guinea pig received all doses over 3 different sessions separated by a 7-10 d washout period, in a randomized crossover design. body weight, feed intake, and fecal output were recorded every 24 h for each guinea pig during the dosing sessions and washout periods. pharmacokinetic results showed peak plasma levels being reached at 30 min and returning to 0 at 8 h. further studies with dosing performed every 8 h is planned to more clearly elucidate the effects of mirtazapine in this species. whole blood samples were collected from 4 nave adult male beagle dogs. samples were divided into hirudin, lithium-heparin, and sodium citrate anticoagulant tubes. platelet function was analyzed using the MEA apparatus. toxicity study was performed to generate historical background control data in the RccHan:WIST rat model. one-hundred and thirty male and 130 female RccHan:WIST rats were pair-housed under standard housing and husbandry conditions with ad libitum access to a lower energy diet. Sprague Dawley rats were allotted in 4 subsets of 25 rats each. ad libitum access to a standard diet (18% protein, 6% fat) and water. rats were administered tap water by oral gavage once daily from gestational day 6 to 17. a more convenient dosing schedule may increase compliance, thereby increasing the welfare of the rodents after surgical manipulation. we try to determine if higher doses of buprenorphine can extend the functional duration of analgesia in mice. mice may experience hyperalgesia at time points as far as 120 h post-injection. the main side effect observed was hypoactivity in doses above and including 7 mg/kg. other side effects were not observed due to the invasive nature of measurement. DNA was extracted from samples using the DNeasy Powerlyzer Powersoil kit. the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced using 300 paired-end reads. fecal, oral, and skin communities were significantly different from fecal. a majority of allograft repairs today involve the use of an autograft. but due to the morbidity of graft harvest, there is an increased interest in allograft use. studies have shown up to 23% of allograft patients will require a revision surgery. the role of epigenetic aberrations in carcinogenesis have become more transparent. hypermethylation occurs at CpG islands causing gene silencing. hypomethylated regions allow transcription of genes. dysregulation can lead to abnormal proliferation, migration, and cell invasion. increase in apoptosis at 12 h with decitabine and 12 and 24 h with 6TG. high dose 6TG actually caused an early increase in proliferation. results support the use of demethylating agents as additional therapeutic agents for priming or combination chemotherapy in osteosarcoma. each feed was imaged by both 2D bioluminescence and fluorescence. three of the test feeds had decreased or equivalent auto-luminescence signal compared to the control diet. one of the test feeds provided additional high-caloric support. male and female C57BL/6NTac mice were enriched for 22 OTUs. male mice were enriched for 10 OTUs corresponding to specific genera. male mice were enriched for 22 OTUs and males enriched for 10 OTUs. noninvasive blood pressure measurements were collected from 100 healthy, ketamine-sedated, adult rhesus macaques representing both sexes, aged 8 to 16 y old. the reference interval calculated for the mean arterial pressure using a high-definition oscillometer was 38-129 mmHg at the brachium, 52-147 mmHg on the pelvic limb, and 54-124 mmHg at the tail. all found to significantly influence BP measurements, providing important information necessary for the appropriate interpretation of noninvasive blood pressure values in rhesus macaques. the influence of mouse strain, immune competency, and age on the pathogenesis of a field strain of minute virus of mice (MVMm) was examined in mice experimentally infected as neonates, weanlings, and adults. viral DNA levels in tissues and bodily excretions consistently increased over time in immune deficient mice regardless of age inoculated. mortality observed in neonatal inoculates between 28 and 56 d after inoculation. mortality observed in neonatal inoculates between 28 and 56 d after inoculation. immune competent Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nuheterozygote (nu/+) and immune deficient homozygote (nu/nu) mice were inoculated by subcutaneous injection (SC) orogastric gavage (OG) with 1 of 3 representative V. botryosastrains recovered from white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), and Luminex polystyrene beads have been in use for more than 15 y for routine serosurveillance of nonhuman primate colonies. a new magnetic MagPlex microspheres was developed using the next generation magnetic MagPlex microspheres. lex MFIA assay was found to be comparable to or better than those obtained by PS MFIA. diagnostic specificity of both NHP MagPlex and PS MFIA were nearly 100% suggesting that MagPlex MFIA is an acceptable alternative assay. mice were monitored for loss of righting reflex (LORR), loss of pedal reflex (RPR), recovery of pedal reflex (RPR) and recovery of righting reflex (RRR). reversal with AT was done at 30\u2019 of LORR. a common cause of cell death is the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) which is mediated by the MPT pore, a nonselective channel in the inner membrane. a matrix protein called cyclophilin-D (CypD) is the only defined regulator of the MPT pore. mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured and were transfected with a control siRNA or an siRNA targeted against NipSnap2 to decrease protein levels. a parallel set of cells was infected with a control virus or a virus coded to produce NipSnap2, elevating levels of the protein. the results suggest that NipSnap2 is not an essential component of the MPT. 8 to 10-wk-old Sprague Dawley rats were used in 2 toxicology studies. 3 posters with different shapes and conspicuous graphics were used for visual cues. 4 new posters of different colors, similar shape, and less prominent graphics were all placed just above the rim of the water maze pool. ylcellulose (MC) is a nontoxic hydrophilic compound derived from cellulose. it is commonly used as an emulsifier and thickener in a variety of food products. there is limited data describing the effects of repeated systemic delivery of MC despite frequent use in preclinical studies. MC PO (n=2) or saline via either route (IP n=6 or PO n=3) had no lesions. repeated IP MC administration may confound any interpretation of drug-induced pathologic lesions. these data highlight the necessity of considering and evaluating the effects of repeated and chronic administration. only 15% of Ulk1/HbbTh3/+ mice survived for 30 d (n=15), compared to 80% of Ulk1+/+HbbTh3/+ mice (n=20) (P 0.05) to examine the consequences of Ulk1 loss in -thalassemic erythroblasts. mutations in the peroxisomal protein, ABCD1, result in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), with clinical manifestations that vary from a progressive spinal cord dysfunction to a fatal form of childhood cerebral ALD (cCALD) changes were identified in these cell populations as early as postnatal day 4 using a nonsurvival blood collection technique. anesthetic mixture of medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol (MMB) has been used in mice and rats. however, there is little information regarding its effects in rabbits. the length of reflex absence determined the surgical anesthetic duration. the recovery time was determined when all reflexes were recovered. another 6 male rabbits were administered MMB by IM. in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion is a comparatively direct approach of measuring compound absorption. the aim of this study is to test the feasibility of using SPIP in mice for both assessing the intestinal permeability of test compound and monitoring its metabolite. mice have high similarity to human in transporter expression profiles and intestinal enzymes. we grow human tumors in immunodeficient mice such as CD-1 nude. the supplement was delivered by subcutaneous slow-release pellets. but due to supply issues with the 5-DHT pellets, we had to develop another way to provide this hormone. administration via diet provides a simple solution for oral drug delivery. it is easily transferable to a broad range of other animal model systems. it is a major refinement in welfare terms by reducing the need for invasive implants or injection regimes and by reducing side effects. 210 labs are currently approved to conduct survival surgery. only 3 of the 21 labs had never had a PASSR. the average number of days elapsed from the time of training to the time at which we identified a noncompliance issue was 705. using radio frequency identification for electronic study tracking, researchers can create a complete and accurate record for each individual. tracking can start before any dosing begins, as far back as weaning. tracking can start before any dosing begins, as far back as weaning. all of our dogs are purpose-bred and enter our colony around 6-9 months of age. all of our dogs are purpose-bred and remain until study termination or a pre-determined retirement date (4.25 years of age). over the past 2 y we have placed heavy emphasis on increased quality human interactions and training with our dogs. small animal numbers are required to acquire sufficient data by standard (staggered) design. microsampling and standard sampling were employed. three groups of SD rats were assigned to a 7-d repeated dose study. mice were housed 5 per cage, and facilities staff completed cage/water bottle changes. observations were recorded daily with respect to fighting, separations, and deaths as result of fighting, for up to 433 d. igloos and pouches were hypothesized to be territorial triggers. laboratory rodent housing environments can have a significant impact on animals\u2019 welfare and affect the overall quality of research. there are several options for rodent cage types, bedding, and enrichment available on the market today. a total of 56 animals, 7 groups (RO, jugular, saphenous, tail nick, isoflorane, and nave) with 8 animals per group. group 1 RO had 2 nonterminal time points per animal collected. group 2-5 had 7 nonterminal time points collected. serial sampling from saphenous collection was difficult, leading to multiple attempts, an inability to collect all samples, and bruising at collection site. jugular blood draws and the novel alternative of tail bleeding are acceptable approaches to serial blood collection in hamsters. liver biopsies have proven a minimally invasive, well tolerated, and safe method for repeated biopsy collection from the liver in nonhuman primates. we evaluated breeding performance of C57BL/6J mice by comparing 2 different contact bedding types: 40 IVC cages on aspen chip. inhalant anesthetic is recommended to anesthetize mice for surgery or euthanasia. it is critical to determine which of these 2 scenarios, home cage versus induction chamber, is truly better at decreasing the potential distress experienced by the mouse. behavioural assessment of jumping, digging, rearing, and sniffing were compared between groups. goal is to identify measures that will help improve interactions between rats and handlers. we initiated 3 consecutive days of habituation by gently handling the rats before a hands-on class. the trainer started by touching the rat gently within the cage. postprocedural veterinary report accompanies each cage of mice for at least 10 d following any procedure requiring anesthesia. a surgical record accompanies each cage for at least 10 d following any procedure requiring anesthesia. this allows specific veterinary review of anesthesia, analgesia, training and competence of surgical staff, as well as a variety of other possible assessments. the beagle Freedom Bill requires public funding research institutions to offer adoptable research cats and dogs to nonprofit rescues. the beagle Freedom Bill emphasizes creating a partnership with rescue organizations. to simplify and streamline the process, we have created an electronic calculator in Microsoft Excel for aggregating and totaling animals required per experimental aim as well as per overall animal use protocol. the calculator provides a robust verification method to simplify the critical question of how many animals should be used in a study. we hoped to expand the length of time an animal could be sampled on an ABS system without having to increase animal numbers. the combination made it possible to collect blood samples from awake, freely moving rats over a 28-d study. animals were monitored for patency, corticosterone levels, and blood chemistry to ensure that the study system did not cause adverse effects. IACLAM helps represent over 1,400 LAM specialists worldwide in four colleges of LAM to the scientific community, government bodies, and public. previous mission-related projects included generating results from a survey of trends and practices by diplomates across the globe. survey identified challenges facing LAM such as euthanasia, transportation, cage space needs, rehoming research animals. er consists of a surgical towel that has been sewn into a pocket equipped with a solid base and an adjustable strap that can be secured behind the rear legs of the animal. rats show preference for the dark pocket and acclimate quickly for routine procedures. traditional methods to reduce/eliminate host interference include wound care, analgesics, topical and systemic antibiotics and antihistamines, systemic sedatives and tranquilizers. some of these strategies have proven ineffective and often capable of replacing the traditional methods. study assessed effectiveness of training care takers to BC score rats using a novel simulation device (SD) compared to lecture-only training. fourteen care takers were given a lecture-based presentation which illustrated the landmarks and described the criteria for determining the BC score for rats. the same care takers were then trained on BC scoring using a SD constructed of a 3-D printed rat skeleton with removable padding. twelve male new Zealand white rabbits were individually housed for the duration of the study in 3 connected cages. they were offered a choice from typical substrates available to laboratory rabbits: aspen wood chips, sawdust, hay. and an empty cage. time spent in each cage was recorded over 20 h, including the dark phase. over 120 facilities have signed up to the Concordant of Openness initiative. each organization must demonstrate its commitment to being open about animal research. a new initiative called the live virtual tour enables us to show a larger audience of people around our facility in real time. ARS encompasses prospective strategy and span style=\u201dbackground-color:rgb(246, 213, 217)\u201d>uses /span>iterative learnings from retrospective evaluations. this allows determination of best-quality models, driven by preclinical-clinical continuity and translational relevance and pathobiology of clinical disease. AMSTs are positioned in early stage of drug discovery programs to determine modeling strategy but can occur throughout a project as required. ics does not impact growth of Staphylococcus aureus in a minipig Surgical Wound Infection. some reports are in vitro studies or unrelated in vivo studies. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have also been shown to inhibit growth of bacteria. analgesics can be used and should be tested in specific animal models before withholding analgesics and assigning a protocol a USDA Category E status. the rapid expansion combined with the geographical separation of animal care staff, veterinary technicians, and research staff has presented a challenging environment in which to effectively disseminate training materials. the 3R principles of the 3Rs are for the first time incorporated into the animal welfare law and a declared goal. the program is unique in Germany and qualifies students as LAS specialist. the curriculum contains modules addressing ethics and legislation in relation to the use of laboratory animals. in vitro and ex vivo techniques are taught during practical skill courses. this should facilitate the qualification of persons responsible for directing animal experiments. in vitro and ex vivo techniques are taught during practical skill courses. using a nontraditional restrainer, the mice are less confined and restrained for less time than with a traditional restrainer. a standard practice is the training of animal care and research staff so they are experienced and competent when working with animals and in compliance with government and institutional policies. atypical approach to a challenge with catheter management arose with socially housed rats for behavioral and addiction studies. rats were surgically implanted with an intravenous catheter with cannula to prepare for a drug self-administration study, then group-housed. despite the initial failure of the plastic cap, a new in-house cap was refined and implemented as a low-cost replacement to protect the tip without further destruction from cagemates. gnotobiotic caging facility filmed technicians performing assigned tasks. they self-assess their performance through review of their own film. technicians found this film review more helpful than traditional methods of instruction. the individual with the top 3 scores are bestowed prizes that consist of an award certificate along with 3 different attractive selections for first place, 2 for second and 1 for third place. the moral towards obtaining the certifications beyond requirements has increased. over 70% of the staff actively participate in the program at one point or another. IACUC can review meeting agendas and meeting minutes, as well as review ASPs. it is user-friendly, has 24-hour access, delivers updates in real-time, and is environment-friendly since the use of paper is eliminated. the 5Es of training provides a framework for trainers. in developing countries the newly implemented IACUCs are encountering many obstacles and difficulties. the role of the IACUC is well established in developed countries and the laws that regulate their operation are under continuous review. the results of the study are some of the difficulties encountered. we bought an ultrasound machine to help in determining pregnancy in time-mated mice. if done incorrectly palpating can cause discomfort to the female. the use of a large animal induction chamber for sedation of miniature swine is a cost-effective and valid refinement strategy. the use of a large animal induction chamber is a cost-effective and valid refinement strategy which improves animal welfare, requires minimal animal training and adequately addresses occupational health and safety issues. the ratio of 1 male to 1 female is a crucial parameter used to optimize the number of fertilized embryos and the most efficient use of animals. the mouse strain CD1 was super-ovulated using a single injection of 5 IU PMSG, then bred. the embryos were then counted, assessed, washed, and placed in M2 media. the club is open to anyone in the lab animal community that has a passion for animal welfare. members include veterinary resident students, veterinarians, vet techs, facility managers, and principal investigators. the club is open to anyone in the lab animal community that has a passion for animal welfare. nic, M Lim, M Rabe, L Schaevitz* Vium, San Mateo, CA. continuous animal monitoring gave effect sizes of 4.01 and 1.67. continuous animal monitoring gave effect sizes of 4.33 and 9.48. the public is commonly misinformed by animal rights activists, advocates, and public figures who preach against the accomplishments derived from animal science and research. using social media to share this information will encourage and motivate others in our industry to start and/or continue to use social media to enlighten the public. the tail vein snip technique in mice is acceptable and reliable when performing serial sampling in mice. the technique produces high-quality plasma samples without the need of supplemental heat, with minimal effect to the animal\u2019s overall wellbeing. mice will engage in active behaviors including nesting and grooming. mice experiencing distress or pain will be less active. increased use of wireless telemetry units has allowed for transmission of real-time information to a sensor. urine is a commonly collected sample used to assess a variety of drug/therapy combinations, as well as evaluate disease progression in the animal model. we used mice as our model because their small size often makes urine collection difficult. however, our greater target volume of 150l is more than a mouse will voluntarily micturate. our goal was to understand the duration and magnitude of impact of animal identification (ID) on animal behavior and physiology. several animal ID procedures, such as tail-tattooing, ear-tagging, and RFID implantation, resulted in distinct changes in activity and breathing rate. intubation in swine is technically difficult as a result of the pig\u2019s oral anatomy and presence of excess tissue in the oropharyngeal region. standard intubation techniques involve using the laryngoscope blade to position the epiglottis such that the vocal cords can be visualized. staff members training on swine intubation also reported greater comfort when using the device versus traditional methods for manipulating the epiglottis. future work will be aimed at showing that this device will also reduce laryngeal trauma (decreased laryngeal edema, hemorrhage, and cellular infiltrate) the ePAM is completed by the IACUC designee during an annual administrative protocol review and critical sections reflected for review. Upon completion, the IACUC designee submits ePAM to PI/designee for review and arranges PAM meeting. the results are simplified documentation, faster completion time, increased PI engagement, and most importantly, a reduction in identified protocol inconsistencies. stocks all display bias towards a particular sex which has remained unchanged from 2013 through 2018. each model maintains a similar sex bias over time, with some fluctuation seen by year. a move towards sex parity in rodent research would reduce the numbers of animals produced but not put to research use. a normal saline solution was infused at a continuous rate of 0.3 mL/hr for approximately 12 wk. there was notable tension on the skin around the port caused by the tether. a more flexible tether at different lengths (8, 9, and 10\u201d) span style=\u201dbackground-color:rgb(246, 213, 217)\u201d>was /span>compared. animal procurement can be complex, based on requirements and regulations such as the Animal Welfare Act. we emphasize a company\u2019s need to enact via its own internal corporate policies numerous safeguards in areas, such as risk, transportation, legal agreements, payments, audits, and cross-divisional impact. teleconferences bring together trainers of all skill levels to share ideas on challenges and solutions. topics have emerged when discussing challenges, including animals that won\u2019t participate, inconsistent response, regression, failure to transfer behavior with another trainer, and fear of new objects. the group brainstorms to evaluate the root cause. the pens allowed for vertical climbing opportunities, hiding opportunities, and structures allowing for establishing mini-territories if the cats so chose. no reduction in room capacity was necessary due to increased animal welfare, reduction in human injuries, increased human welfare, and lack of impact on study design and business needs. the submental (chin) blood collection method will have lower histopathology scores than submandibular (cheek) and would provide a refined method of blood collection when multiple collections are needed. we used 28 NU/J HOM male mice split into groups based on blood collection method. annual farm rounds were conducted by a dedicated veterinarian and a licensed veterinary technologist from the laboratory animal care team. a spreadsheet was used to record once weekly summaries, but ultimately became cumbersome. a related database was created to accurately track teaching and research use, especially repeated involvement of individual animals on study. 200 animal caregivers provide daily care for research animals housed in nine vivaria, on approximately 600 protocols. a binder was created by the training department that contains educational material regarding human relations, occupational health and safety, and other job-related tasks. the binder accompanies all new hires to their assigned facility. an experimental device was developed to reduce needle insertion force, tissue damage, and potentially animal distress. the ED reduced (>50%) the maximum insertion forces for needle entry (23G and 25G) compared to control (P 0.0005) in a bench model (orange skin), and for angled (30\u00b0, 25G) entry into ex vivo porcine ears. the ED group had significantly less bruising (blinded visual scoring, 0-5 scale) compared to other groups. 62.3% of ED collections caused minimal tissue damage (scores 0-2). only 31.2% and 37.5% of control and noise collections were in this range. study design and outcome measures were highly variable. of 18 outcomes evaluated, changes were inconsistent or poorly differentiated between treatments. it is likely repeated exposures to carbon dioxide inhalation are aversive to adult rats and mice. compatible pairs of macaques were gradually acclimated from unpaired to paired feeding. this was successfully accomplished in approximately 3 wk by gradually decreasing the time of unpaired food access until the animals were no longer separated during feeding. four groups of 6 adult, female, ICR mice were placed in a chamber either that was or was not prefilled with isoflurane. the isoflurane gas with 100% oxygen was then introduced at 2 different flow rates. there was no significant difference in anxiety behaviors scored between the first and second exposures in group A and B. our IACUC raised concerns on the current standard of enrichment provided to a typical mouse cage. three primary types of enrichment were used: tissues, crinkle paper discs, and enrichment squares. each of the 10 groups was assigned a combination of 1 or more of the materials. the first cage of the group contained a male/female pair. the need to locate a sanctuary that will continue to take exceptional care of the animals is of upmost importance to the research facility. the sanctuary will display a tactful dialog on social media and/or their website regarding the intake of animals from research facilities and animal research in general. sentinel cages were used as a primary component of the rodent health surveillance monitoring program. a grading scale was developed for sentinel cages to provide a guideline for training. individuals that received excellent scores for sentinel cages in all of their areas for 4 consecutive quarters was named a Sentinel Superstar. the results of implementing the Veterinary Verification and Consultation policy were immediate and exceeded our expectations. each submission handled under the VVC policy saves approximately 2.75 review hours equating to a $40,000 savings in the last 6 mo in 2017. dilatative cardiomyopathy and atrial thrombosis have been reported in a genetically modified mouse breeding colony. the condition affected several strains of both sexes and different ages. extensive testing failed to ascertain the cause. a naive, 4-y-old, 5 kg female cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was found to have a focal, spherical, firm, subcutaneous mass on the proximal aspect of the nasal bone slightly right of midline. radiographs of the skull did not identify abnormal pathology and CBC/chemistry were within normal reference intervals. psy revealed a focal 2 cm x 2 cm raised, spherical, semi-firm, tan nodule on the proximal aspect of the nasal bone slightly right of midline. no further macroscopic lesions were observed and the mass did not appear to be invading into the nasal turbinates, orbit, or cranium. this is the first report of a mesenchymal cell neoplasia in the nasal bone of newborn pups were disinfected with chlorine dioxide and cross-fostered to CD-1 females that were confirmed to be free of MNV. cross-foster rederivation was successful in 100% of the litters as determined by fecal PCR for MNV. twinning is the most frequent reproductive pattern seen within a common marmoset breeding colony. it is not uncommon to witness single births and triplets in a family group. cross-fostering any offspring to another female marmoset who has given birth to a singlet within a close time frame. two 6-mo-old, female chinchillas presented with large, round, firm, nonmobile, subcutaneous masses. the first chinchilla being experimentally nave had a mass in the left submandibular region approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. the second chinchilla which had undergone several weeks of acoustic behavioral training had 2 masses in the left axillary region both approximately 3 cm in diameter. both chinchillas showed mild anemia, likely due to an inflammatory response, lymphopenia with a large number of toxic neutrophils and monocytes. a necropsy was performed which confirmed abscesses, followed by bacterial culture, antibiotic sensitivity testing, and histologic assessment. a 22-year-old male castrated pigtail macaque presented with focal swelling on the left side of the face on routine physical exam. the swelling was located 1 cm lateral to the nasal bridge and 2 cm ventral to the orbit. radiographs revealed a radiopaque lesion adjacent to the apex of the maxillary canine tooth. the mass extended from the left incisive bone ventrally to involve the hard palate and caudally to involve the entire alveolar bone of the left maxilla. due to the locally extensive nature of the mass, euthanasia was elected. final diagnosis was a cystic adenoid carcinoma of the minor salivary glands. a second female from the same shipment was euthanized and diagnostic necropsy performed due to similar clinical signs. Necropsy of the first female showed hemorrhage of the right middle lung lobe and a darkened mediastinal lymph node. both cases were diagnosed as acute hemorrhagic pneumonia with edema caused by an extra-intestinal infection. each rabbit was sedated and aseptically prepared for each procedure. body temperature was monitored via a rectal probe throughout the procedure. the rabbits in group 1 had an overall higher average body temperature than those in group 2. rats administered 10E5 copies of RatPyV2 purified from feces from infected nude rats. no virus was detected by PCR in feces or multiple target tissues. the findings confirmed subclinical disease with seroconversion. rabbits are adept at hiding pain and can be stressed by handling and restraint. the use of drugs with longer durations can be beneficial by reducing the number of times the animal needs to be restrained. a 12-y-old, female, SPF rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) housed in an indoor-outdoor breeding group presented to the clinic for complete right arm lameness of 3-d duration. the animal was noted with clinical signs indicative of labor. despite conservative monitoring, no clinical progress or parturition was noted. placentae have been reported in up to 9.5% of rhesus macaque births. placental abruption is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. musculoskeletal and eye strain issues can be exacerbated by poor posture and incorrect ergonomic position. loupes can increase target size up to 8 times and provide visual focus. loupes have greatly enhanced visibility for veins that have been injected repeatedly. systemic absorption of 10% topical phenylephrine solution has previously been reported in human pediatric patients. 3 cases of pulmonary edema were reported in the africa green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) following administration of topical 10% phenylephrine HCl solution. wasting marmoset syndrome is one of the biggest problems in captive marmoset colonies. molecular mechanisms, biochemical markers for accurate diagnosis remain unknown. wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) is one of the biggest problems in captive marmoset colonies. tranexamic acid therapy may be a new and useful treatment for WMS. ferrets are commonly used in research for their short gestational age of 41-42 d and their ability to carry a fetus. a group of n=5 wild-type ferrets at a known gestational age underwent a laparotomy. each uterine horn was exposed, allowing complete visualization of the number of embryos present. the fetus underwent intraventricular injection through the uterine wall, followed by electroporation. the catheters were secured in place using 2-0 PDS suture for the duration of the study. alternative to jugular cannulation, umbilical vein catheters were placed using aseptic technique temporarily the day of c-section. the program was used to record anesthetic parameters for 160 anesthetic procedures, involving multiple species, over the course of 5 y. recorded parameters included notations regarding preoperative evaluation, anesthetic plan, routine vital signs, complications noted during the procedure. axolotls with skin lesions (n=2) and newts with bloating and lethargy (n=2) were treated with itraconazole baths. axolotls with skin lesions (n=2) and newts with bloating and lethargy (n=2) were treated with itraconazole baths. PCR results after treatments (at 1 wk and 1 mo post) were negative. itraconazole submersion protocol appears to be a successful treatment for B. dendrobatidis in laboratory-maintained colonies. the intraoperative detection of perforation was poor, being present in only 5% (1/19) perforations. the use of a surgical drill significantly increased the risk for glove perforation (P = 0.03) clinical pathology revealed a regenerative anemia, low hemoglobin, marked thrombocytopenia, elevated ALT, AST, GGT, and albumin. pig was euthanized due to poor study candidacy and disease severity. pathogenesis is unknown but suspected to be a Type 3 hypersensitivity reaction causing degenerative vasculopathy with arteriosclerosis as a distinctive feature. humanized mice are immunodeficient mice engrafted with human cells, tissues, or most commonly, human immune systems. the different factors involved in creating humanized mice also affects the onset and development of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. mouse was housed on an autowater rack with ad libitum access to standard rodent chow in ventilated caging with 1/8 in corncob bedding. no other mice in the cage were affected. e screening, and C. bovis testing revealed diffuse eosinophilic inflammation in the skin, lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, lung, heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys. this mouse was diagnosed with systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome. this is the first known reported incidence of spontaneous disease. l biotype was identified by PCR testing of oropharyngeal swabs taken from a 10-d-old pup presenting with a closed right eye and ocular discharge. the presentation of P. pneumonotropica is atypical due to its effect on immunocompetent individuals and historically clinical signs only present in immunocompromised. a higher percentage of animals failed to achieve a plane of surgical anesthesia than typical with TBE at our facility. a higher percentage of animals (4 out of 40 [10%] GF and 2 out of 35 [5.7%] DF) failed to achieve a plane of surgical anesthesia than is typical with TBE at our facility. ibuprofen (0.4mg/mL; n=11) compared with vehicle (n=10) resulted in approximately 100 mg/kg/day ibuprofen imbibed by a 30 g mouse. postincision paw swelling increased 50% at 24 and 48 h, running wheel reduced 20% at 24 and 48 h. experimentally naive, wild-caught, female African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) was identified with a 5 mm3 firm subcutaneous papule on the left side of the dorsum 1 cm cranial to the pelvis. the frog was otherwise normal and anesthetized with MS222 for further assessment. a small colony of owl monkeys, Aotus nancymaae, was housed for research in previously established male-female pairs. a no-scalpel vasectomy technique was performed under general anesthesia with isoflurane gas. the monkey recovered without complication. Vasectomy proved to be a fast and effective surgical sterilization procedure for owl monkeys. the surgery details may be useful for other institutions housing pair-bonded owl monkeys or similarly sized primates. PCR identified enteroinvasive (Einv) toxin, believed to represent Escherichia coli, from small intestine and colon in 3 of 3 NSGS mice tested. NSGS mice were depopulated, while the NSG mice were allowed to complete the experiment with in-room decontamination. group 1 consisted of 80 rabbits separated for surgery and unsuccessfully reintroduced to each other 10 d postoperatively. group 2 consisted of 82 rabbits, which were not separated for surgery, and wore 0to 3-mo-old sized human infant pants solely as postsurgical protection. group 1 rabbits were singly housed postsurgically, and group 1 had no success pair housing postsurgically. baseline time to consumption (TTC) was recorded in 36 rats prior to surgery. rats were then ovariectomized (n=27) or received anesthesia only (n=9) and assigned 1 of 3 groups: subcutaneous treatment with 2 mg/kg meloxicam, 4 mg/kg sustained release SR-meloxicam, or 1 mL saline. animal experimentation uses laboratory animals as models of human diseases to better understand their pathophysiology and treatment. aging rats tend to develop pododermatitis which can be difficult to treat efficiently to humanely maintain the animals until reaching the target age for the experimental endpoint. adult zebra finches are dosed with 1 or 3 mg/kg (approximately, and based on exact weight of each bird) of meloxicam intramuscularly. plasma is collected from the birds during a terminal cardiac blood draw under isoflurane anesthesia, and the plasma samples are analysed using HPLC. a currently recommended dose of 1 mg/kg will need to be administered more frequently than once a day to maintain optimal plasma concentrations. injectable administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) requires repeated restraint and may increase stress. the lowest average mouse dose per cage (2.9 mg/kg) was significantly lower than the water group (5.93 mg/kg) and target dose on day 1 only. both methods of oral Carprofen dosing resulted in postsurgical analgesia comparable to daily injections. retrospective data was collected from 97 swine over a course of 3 y. weight (kg), endotracheal tube sizes, intubation attempts, positioning for intubation (dorsal, lateral, ventral) and SpO2 measurements were collected from each swine during intubation. a patented combination of butorphanol tartrate, azaperone tartrate, and medetomidine hydrochloride (BAM) each animal was given 0.02 ml/kg of BAM IM. after completion of the procedure, the butorphanol tartrate was reversed with 0.5 mL of naltrexone and the medetomidine was reversed. tosis, and xerosis of the ischial callosities and the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet was diagnosed in 17 colony rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) the age at diagnosis ranged from 3 to 10 y with an average onset of 6 y. the differential diagnosis was allergic contact dermatitis and was favored given the lesion distribution and the character of the inflammatory infiltrate. a 22-mo-old female cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) socially housed in a same-sex peer group presented with an irregular soft tissue mass in the right cranial abdomen palpated during routine physical exam. a barium series confirmed the mass was extragastrointestinal and suggested adjacent organ displacement. the mass had an irregular surface, weighed 139 g, and measured 8 x 10 cm. a 6.5-y-old, 830 g, spayed, trio-housed lab ferret was evaluated with a reported history of decreased activity level. alopecia on the dorsal tail base, vulvar enlargement, and a large, firm, palpable abdominal mass were within normal ranges, and the remainder of exam was unremarkable. gastric and mesenteric lymphadenomegaly was attributable to red pulp extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), and that the adrenal mass was a cortical adenoma. histology also revealed chronic gastritis with rare spirochetes consistent with Helicobacter spp. animals were monitored for signs of pain at 1-h intervals for the first 12 h, 2-h intervals for the second 12 h, then 24-h intervals thereafter, for a total of 4 to 6 wk. the animals gained body weight and showed mobility within 3 d after the operation. an intraabdominal testis was identified and tissue collected for histologic analysis. a second barrow with an intraabdominal testis was found. this animal did not manifest any of the behavioral changes seen in the first pig. mesenteric mass measured 4 x 6 x 2 cm and was dark red-brown with multiple fluid-filled cysts. neoplastic spindle cells were located within the submucosa of the gastric cardia and infiltrated into the gastric wall. neoplasm was negative for pancytokeratin and positive for vimentin. frog had undergone 3 surgical laparotomies for oocyte harvest prior to clinical signs. previous incision sites had healed without complications. differential diagnoses for weight loss include parasites, mycobacterium-associated granulomatous intestinal disease, nitrogenous or heavy metal toxicosis. a wild-caught frog from Chile was distributed to our facility. heavy parasite infestation can lead to malabsorption, weight loss, and increase an animal\u2019s susceptibility to bacterial infection. sexes were compared, and basophil percentage in females. ALT, GGT, red cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and reticulocyte count differed in males and females. ischemic cerebral stroke leads to severe encephalomalacia of the right occipital lobe. additional diagnostics including bacterial cultures and histopathology showed no other systemic, such as viral, bacterial, or parasitic causation. e vesicular disease, vesicular exanthema of swine, vesicular stomatitis, and Seneca virus A are clinically indistinguishable from each other. USDA and molecular diagnostics are the only means to confidently rule out a foreign animal disease. cefazolin samples were collected every third day for pH, turbidity, coloration, and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) the contents of each bottle were plated on sheep blood agar to test for the growth of bacterial contaminants. no bacterial contaminants were detected and the AST results performed well above standard requirements throughout the 10-d investigation. the mass had advanced into an anaplastic sarcoma with >1 cm margins laterally and 0.5 cm margins deep. the incision healed without incident or regrowth in 3 mo. adverse reactions to microchips occasionally occur, including migration, postinjection swelling, infection, functional failure, or even complete loss from the body. the meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius) is currently used to study metabolism during periods of hibernation and very cold temperatures at our institution. all of the founding individuals in both our breeding colony and study group are wild caught. a retrospective analysis of clinical cases and necropsy reports has been compiled for the previous 14 mo in an effort to better understand the species and its particular veterinary health challenges. the overall health of the colony is robust with traumatic foot and/or tail injuries constituting most acute cases. the goal of this study was to determine whether the microbiome profile from a rectal swab performed on a sedated animal is comparable to the fecal microbiome profile. the results demonstrate that nonclear rectal swabs are a reliable method for sample collection for gut microbiome studies in marmosets. PD is a common health condition in aging rats used for behavioral studies. treatment included nail trims, with or without multi-wave locked system (MLS) laser therapy, and/or placement on a commercially available variable paper-free bedding. MLS laser therapy promoted increased erythema/swelling. size and severity of the PD lesions along with placement on paper-free bedding were the most predictive measures of treatment success. periocular edema is a common finding seen with intraarterial chemotherapy. carboplatin itself can cause orbital fibrosis following direct periocular injection. however, the severity of this adverse consequence in rabbits was unexpected and its use was discontinued. motility rate was 82.4%, were treated with 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, resulting in damaged sperm with low motility rate (14.6%) we further incubated the suspension for 20 min with or without H2 and found that H2 significantly increased the motility rate (63.9%). users can browse content across the entire site via text search, document type, species referenced, and/or topic. each document is broken down into collapsible accordion list(s) for easier navigation, includes contact and approval information, and an auto-populated list of related documents from across the program. researchers can log in to the website to access protected content, save custom searches, and bookmark documents. each group of serum averaged 1 h and 44 min of additional processing. each group of microsamplers averaged 3 min and 13 s (17.5 s per microsampler); a time savings of approximately 1 h and 41 min. the comparative medicine program husbandry management team (HMT) has used a wireless environmental monitoring system for all animal housing and critical support areas. it explored on a trial basis, monitoring cage washer performance using a water temperature sensor compatible with the environmental monitoring system. establishing a new performance standard that documents washer performance was established. each cage was given the nesting material for 1 wk. no health reports, and no fighting was observed over the 6 wk. shredding scores were significantly higher for mice given BCP alone. animal care staff gave their evaluation of different space allocations of rooms, schematic animal rack layouts, large equipment layouts, workflow charts, surface materials, and storage requirements. animal care staff gave their sample appraisal of different individually-ventilated caging systems and their components, biosafety cabinets, shelves, PPE, material containers, and environmental enrichment. a line-specific informational system was needed to make these assessments. it records strain nomenclature, research applications, phenotypical behavior/appearances. each cage card lists the strain name and is color-coded to match the handbook information. the system has resulted in better colony management. tubes were customized with a 1 in long, pinhole (1/32 diameter) commercially available sipper tube. all rodent drinking water is autoclaved. at day 7, water samples were taken from the standard sipper tubes. we used adenosine triphosphate testing (ATP) to measure the effectiveness of various AHP products. we tested the premoistened wipes (0.5% hydrogen peroxide), the ready to use AHP spray (0.5% hydrogen peroxide) and the AHP concentrate (4.25% hydrogen peroxide) diluted to 2 oz per gallon spray at a 1-, 3-, and 5-min contact time. effective onboarding promotes employee engagement, builds trust, enhances the quality of work, and increases retention. effective onboarding promotes employee engagement, builds trust, enhances the quality of work and increases retention. a dedicated departmental trainer and a custom online training video series are important to help animal care staff understand their role in the mission of the organization. we also invite researchers to all-staff meetings to present their projects and connect the value of our support to their studies. a range of pathogens were not detected with the routine bedding sentinel program including pinworm. a positive cage out of 280 cages led to a positive EAD result. the regular bedding sentinel setting was not able to detect this pinworm infestation. in-house produced water pouches remain sterile for at least 30 mo. animal studies are gaining renewed interest coincident with growing body of research evaluating the relationship between the microbiome in health and disease. six out of 6 mice sent to a commercial laboratory for testing at week 17 were found to be axenic in all testing criterion. all cages tested negative in weekly in-house aerobic and anaerobic culture tests for a total of 24 wk. this study validated the repurpose of underutilized biocontainment unit at our institution for germ-free housing. pH of acidified bottles (n=4) and autoclaved acidified bottles (n=4) was recorded before and after autoclaving, and on day 7. samples from day 0 and day 7 were then cultured on blood agar plates. no microbial growth from any sample undergoing bioburden testing. mice housed in IVCs, in over 3,700 cages from 23 different housing rooms, during a 2-3 mo timeframe (4-6, 2-wk intervals) staff reported decreased levels of environmental dust and odor in the housing rooms, as well as a reduction in cage flooding. the flex room was designed to accommodate rodents, aquatics, or large animals. it took about half the time for husbandry technicians to clean this room. the flex room also encourages more natural herd and grazing behaviors. the voles destroyed the water pouch valve causing floods or dehydration. the only pathogen detected was mycoplasma volis. the voles were prolific breeders and the colony expanded quickly. over 5,000 cages of nonhuman primates have been successfully moved by this method. the institution has a large array of housed animals that had required expensive devices. we have created ownership of the powerful enrichment component. sanitization is important for reducing microbial contaminants which can negatively impact colony health and research results. sanitization in a vivarium is important for reducing microbial contaminants which can negatively impact colony health. vivarium staff followed sanitization procedures more closely resulting in a cleaner macroenvironment. the bacterium is presumed to be a commensal on the skin of a variety of animals including rodents. a single swab sampled 1 or 2 single-sided racks or 1 double-sided rack. in total, 88% (227/257) of swabs were positive for S. xylosus. the 5% of samples with the highest copy number were traced back to their original racks. bed fabric is ballistic nylon and has a pouch beneath that allows for insertion of thermal support devices. options made from french terry cloth attach via heavy duty velcro and provide a soft blanket for recovery. mice from 2 genetic backgrounds used shelters more frequently than B6 mice. the shelters were used most often by adults and older pups. the shelters were used most often by adults and older pups. three isolators were located inside an animal biosafety level-3 (ABL-3) room to provide an extra tier of protection. multiple case studies of failure scenarios were investigated. each isolator has a blower motor plus a backup blower motor in case of electrical failure. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) is the third leading cause of food poisoning in humans. toxin-producing strains of C. perfringens are present in these diets. there are no reports of disease due to C. perfringens. eighteen breeder pairs of ICR (good breeders) and SJL (poor breeders) mice were established. breeder pairs were randomly allocated to 3 different treatment groups. the breeder pairs were followed for 140 d. new racks used quick disconnect water valves and air plenums. different cleaning methods and materials were evaluated for the disinfection of water valves during cage wash. ammonium chloride (8.7%) and a neutral cleaner (alcohol ethoxylates (20-30%), sodium xylene sulfonate (1- 3%), fatty acids, C8-18 and C18 unsaturated (1- 3%) and terpene solvent (.1 - 1%) were found to score in the 11-29 RLU range consistently and was the preferred cleaner recommended for use by custodial staff. vivarium has created a poster depicting mouse pups from age P14 to P28. the poster is now included in the vivarium orientation and training program. the hydrogen peroxide solution appeared to be over 7x more expensive than the chlorine dioxide solution based on a volume per volume comparison. this was done by comparing the cost that would be associated with each bottle (21 oz) of the disinfectants. NH Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune neurodegenerative disease characterized by intrathecal inflammation. biomarkers are not easily found in the blood, making it imperative to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to monitor the disease in mice, the spinal cord is collected using a serial sacrifice method and the tissue is used for immunological analyses. reintroductions are attempted whenever nursery-rearing is not required by research protocols. an infant separated at birth was first reintroduced to his dam\u2019s home cage 16 d and 17 d postpartum. new caging arrangements can succeed in reintroduction of infants to dams or foster dams at later ages. study indicates that novel caging arrangements can succeed in reintroduction of infants to dams or foster dams. light filters and ballast modulators are being investigated as ways to reduce blue light emission from the LEDs reaching the tanks. the use of filters may allow for the continued use of the LED lighting without resulting in increased algae growth. the new method to protect the cuff of the gloves has proved to be successful. we have changed the frequency of changing the isolator gloves back to intervals of 6 mo. Sprague Dawley rat breeding cages were housed according to our internal (1 x 1; 120 in2 per animal) the number of pups born and weaned was recorded, as well as pup and parental morbidity, mortality, ammonia, clinical conditions, animal behavior, and cage cleanliness. facility managers routinely over ordered consumables which exacerbated restricted storage capacity and impacted an already tight budget. a purchase order is automatically generated and sent to the vendor. each facility submits a weekly consumables/feed/bedding order. ative Medicine, UNC Chapel Hill, NC Strategies for controlling floor contamination in rodent individually ventilated caging (IVC) facilities have traditionally consisted of disposable shoe covers, but alternative technologies, such as contamination control flooring, have been developed. floor contamination control strategies help reduce organic load in rodent IVC facility entrances and housing areas. a leadership training program is a yearlong course designed to give each candidate skills required for leadership responsibilities. the success of our leadership program is measured by conducting surveys each year. many of our program participants are RSTs, which is a team leader role. xenoestrogens are a naturally occurring steroid hormone most notable for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system. xenoestrogens mimic estrogen and can disrupt normal reproductive physiology in mammals. urized fluid extraction (PFE) and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) no estrogen activity or bisphenols were detected in either water supply when kept in the pouches or the glass bottles. it is recommended that facilities test their water delivery systems to determine EA and xenoestrogens within the water. mosquito traps at the facility entrance, air curtains installed at each loading dock entrance, and additional mosquito netting installed into the back of the transport vehicle. the additional netting prevented any mosquitos from entering the back of the truck while the door was opened to load/unload the bio-transport cage. autoclaving is one of the most common methods of decontaminating biohazardous materials for purposes of biosafety. a literature search indicates there are several other acceptable decontamination methods. abs. S. obvelata and C. rodentium DNA were not detected on 16/22 PCR samples of clean cages. autoclaving, although an effective decontamination method based on our autoclave monitoring reports, did not eliminate DNA on the cages. we wanted to investigate the possibility of keeping sentinel animals in-house for periods of 12 versus 3 mo at a time. mice first exposed at 8-12 wk of age were exposed at 8-12 wk of age. this practice can be combined to increase sensitivity and specificity of rodent surveillance programs and minimize the use of live animals. the PI and our trainers held training sessions for the staff. the hedgehogs have been housed for 8 wk in the current setup. the running wheels were the most likely to become soiled, followed by the pan papers. a new enrichment program was devised to mitigate the aggression within the colony. the program included increasing the frequency and variety of fresh food offerings. there was an almost immediate decrease in health reports of fight wounds and/or decreased feather loss in the cages by approximately 62%. a large percentage of our rat population is singly housed due to scientific need. we measured intracage temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, ammonia levels, and microbiological load (ATP) for 2 different weight classes of singleton Sprague Dawley rats. corvids are a species of bird that has been proven to be extremely smart and require a great deal of mental stimulation while in captivity. the current budget for the corvid colony is limited, which has driven staff to become more creative. the rabbit condo was developed in-house and allowed animals to exercise, forage and assume normal body postures in a novel and safe space. the rabbit condo was made in-house and the device allowed animals to assume normal body postures in a novel and safe space. it was retained as part of the environmental enrichment program in both laboratories in North America. the entire sump of the circulating frog system in our laboratory was discovered drained. the team jumped into action to avoid a major disruption to the water quality. veterinary assistance was sought as the team began to come up with a solution to preserve the water quality and avoid frog casualty. gamma irradiation is considered a convenient and reliable method of sterilization of medical supplies and irregularly shaped particles such as pelleted chow. the FDA has approved exemptions for the use of higher levels of irradiation (35 kGy minimum) in feed for certain research facilities. high-dose irradiated diet resolved within 24 h. some irradiator sources can only guarantee a minimum exposure level and not a maximum level. careful consideration on size and density of packaging should be considered. the results showed chlorine-based sterilants had the widest margin of safety in respect to the bactericidal and sporicidal activity in vitro, were the most rapid-acting. hydrogen peroxide-based sterilants can be effective alternatives, as are generally more cost effective but more corrosive to acrylic surfaces. mock test runs with all involved staff using no animals followed by live test runs using control sheep identified areas for process improvement. the guide recommends changing static open topped cages every week and individually ventilated cages every 2 wk. vendor B design operates at 30 ACH and a 21-d cage change interval. ammonia levels were measured by an electrochemical sensor and wireless metal-oxide-semiconductor type sensors. sensors were tuned to record an ammonia value once every 3 h. aques that are too large for hand-catch restraint can minimize the use of chemical restraint for handling. this voluntary participation with positive reinforcement may lead to overall stress reduction for the animals. we decided to pole and collar train the Chlorocebus monkeys so that we could use restraint chairs. the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) represents an important niche in the overall body of scientific literature including neuroscience and infectious disease research. current enrichment standards for other laboratory rodents may be inappropriate for the social, physical, and mental wellbeing of gerbils. gloves worn during handling of nonhuman primates provide a protective barrier against physical trauma. gloves can harbor bacteria that can be harmful to the nonhuman primate. it has not been established if gloves can be sanitized and remain viable after sterilization. ilation in a Rodents\u2019 and Primates\u2019 facility with 50% HVAC Energy Saving M Ishihara* Workplace Solutions dept., Azbil Corporation, Tokyo, Japan Since the 8th edition of the Guide published, some variable air volume (VAV) systems had been installed in newly built animal facilities. the guide recommends that ventilation rates be set in accordance with heat load and other variables. vivarium had 2 different types of caging equipment paired with an extensive cage change schedule that required our cage wash staff to produce 6-8 different types of caging. cage wash staff now communicate effectively and work efficiently while avoiding many disparities. many small changes and additions to procedures have led to increased employee comfort and morale. ear notchers and styles of mouse restraint are easier to use in the context of the isolators. a scheduled monthly nail trim was performed on 29 rabbits without the rabbit temperament chart posted. the number of times the staff changed restraint due to animal movement was counted. the average handling time per rabbit was reduced by an average of 66.92 sec per rabbit. the \u201cferret futon\u201d uses items that are easily found in most animal facilities. this enrichment is designed to encourage the ferret to nest, burrow, and hide within the nesting box. the procedure is necessary to introduce ferrets with a desired genetic background into the barrier. ferrets have successfully fostered to the new jills, and the kits have remained negative for influenza titers as well as other pathogens. this procedure has proved to be a successful method for introducing ferrets into a barrier environment to maintain an SPF health status for studying infectious disease. ferrets are a valuable model in many areas of biomedical research, most notably influenza research and neurobiology. a clear criterion for defining aged (old) mice has not been established. male and female C57BL/6NCrSlc mice (4 wk) were purchased from a vendor every 3 mo and kept over their lifetime. survival rates start to decline at approximately 21 mo. blood test shows that the total WBC count starts to decline at around 18 mo and the composition of WBC tends to change with aging. several age-related changes can be candidate senescence indicators at an individual level. research staff were notified of the change and instructed on how to properly use and care for the laminated cards. Across 20 animal rooms, over 70% of recycle bins are full weekly. this project successfully reduced waste within animal rooms. escence and environmental monitoring plates to quantify organic material and microbial burden. mice were weighed at the beginning and at 7 wk and monitored during cage changes for general wellbeing. mice gained weight (mean = 27%) and no health problems were observed. a 50 mL conical tube with a breathing hole as a mouse restrainer is practical, cost-effective, and easy to construct. the tube restrainer is easy for staff to perform and appears to improves welfare for mice with ulcerative dermatitis. gnotobiotic genetically modified mouse models are needed to rederive mice into the germ-free state. the procedure is done inside a horizontal flow hood and can be performed in its entirety by a single operator. if contamination occurs, the entire isolator must be rebuilt resulting in additional cost and loss of time. a survey was created to evaluate our current caging in an effort to better understand the various needs of both the primates and the employees. four employees from across 5 facilities participated, including colony management, veterinary, husbandry, facilities, behavioral management, nursery, research support, and research staff. 91 out of 126 previously active in animal controlled substance administration did not apply for DEA registration. 91 out of 126 previously active in animal controlled substance administration did apply for DEA registration. heath surveillance in rodent facilities typically uses live sentinel animals euthanized at periodic intervals for serology, parasitology, and necropsy evaluation. recent literature has suggested the number of animals needed could be reduced by PCR testing filters or fecal and fur swabs from colony animals instead of sacrificing sentinels. the alternative testing would provide equivalent results to sentinels. the results of direct colony sampling for mice matched the sentinel results and did not pick up any additional agents. for rats, the direct samples were negative for agents found by sentinels. further evaluation may be needed for rats. P195 Comparing Efficacy of Antimicrobial Hand Wipes and Registered Disinfectants in the Surgical Suite ST Baker*1, LT Holt-Bright2, A Ingraham3, D Johnson3 1Thoracic Medicine and Surgery (TMS), Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; 2ULAR, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; 3Pharmacal Research Laboratories. the pigsicle is a layered, frozen device comprised of various treats and a flavored oral rehydrator. the pigsicle is highly customizable in regards to shape, size, and incorporation of flavors and types of treats. it promotes species-specific behaviors, increases interaction time, produces no waste, and allows for variation when offered repeatedly. the 1/4 in corncob bedding has been associated with a reduced incidence of flooding compared to the 1/8 in both at our and other institutions. two strains of male mice and two stocks of male rats were housed in static, filter top cages with 1 of the 2 bedding types. the 1/4 in bedding has comparable effects as 1/8 in. on ammonia levels and behavior for rats and mice. the larger bedding might be associated with greater damage to the nasal mucosa in rats and should be used with more caution in that species. tracking of IVC racks and live sentinel cages in rodent facilities can be challenging. the RFID is associated with the barcode for each IVC rack. the database is accessible from any workstation, and provides a room location for each rack at the time of the weekly census activity. mat tested for adenosine tri-phosphates (ATP) using a luminometer. an 11-fold higher level of organic debris was measured on floors before the mats. a significant reduction in ATP (38 RLU) was seen on floors directly after walking across the mats. s of each strain were evaluated over a 4-d period. the new flashlight failed to produce a significant statistical change to AA. daily checks using the new procedure could project savings of 6.5 h/d. guinea pigs are prone to diet-associated clinical abnormalities. pelleted lab diets are alfalfa-based, which is higher in calcium and protein. urine chemistries, radiographs, and gross photographs were collected at 8 wk and 12 wk. all 3 animals demonstrated an initial weight reduction and a significant improvement in body condition. results suggest mature guinea pigs may benefit from lower macromineral and less energy-dense diet made available from standard research diet manufacturers. a CNTNAP2 knockout colony thrived resulting in efficient breeding and pup viability. a secluded cage location has a direct impact on the breeding success of a CNTNAP2 knockout colony. animal research facilities use a multitude of chemical detergents that are necessary for daily husbandry activities. the bulk chemical containers were stored outdoors on secondary containment berms in multiple locations. inadequate equipment design led to incidental drips, occasional spills, and rainwater that filled the containment berms over time. twelve pair-housed animals were housed 2 per cage for a total of 6 cages. two cages were provided each type of bedding for a period of 1 wk. each guinea pig was weighed and a brief physical examination performed. the Quatranasia allows for a maximum of 20 mice to be euthanized simultaneously through a gas overdose. the ability to euthanize mice from separate cages at the same time prevents unnecessary distress to the animals. the reduced euthanasia time minimizes emotional stress for personnel and is useful for time-sensitive studies. the transgenic colony management team is responsible for managing >400 active transgenic lines containing targeted genetic modifications at up to four independent loci. the team uses up-to-date principles of colony management and electronic (software) tools to process breeding requests, devise breeding strategies, schedule tasks (such as paw tattooing, tail biopsies, ear notching, and weaning), log genotype information, track breeder productivity. we propose the use of a dedicated breeding colony with vigilant colony managers to reduce waste and improve overall operational efficiency in the transgenic mouse vivarium. the average pups born by every recipient were 3.50 and 3.67 for transgenic and knockout mice. necroptosis machinery in the pathogenesis of Neonatal Necrotizing Enterocolitis AD Werts* Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, Baltimore, MD Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of premature infants that is characterized by excessive inflammation and cell death in the intestine. we hypothesize that necroptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of NEC. pharmacological and genetic inhibition of necroptosis during NEC decreased the upregulation of inflammatory gene transcription. necroptosis genes in the immature intestine suggest that these genes may play a role in normal intestinal development, but also that the neonatal intestine may be primed for death by necroptosis. repeated intradermal injections for a period of 5 d did elicit increased erythema and edema in rpIL-4 dose sites. peak irritation was observed approximately 5 min after dose administration. perivascular eosinophils were observed in 25% of rpIL-4 and rpIL-13 dose sites. venipuncture is a novel blood sampling technique that uses the gingival vein located within the gingiva just below the pair of mandibular incisors. the technique has previously been shown to be minimally traumatic with no significant alterations in hematological parameters. gingival venipuncture may be used as an alternative blood collection method for guinea pigs. a chlorhexidine oral rinse should be considered as an alternative to saline in future studies, given the positive blood cultures. control NSG mice (n=5) underwent the described tumor implantation and injections of human T cells and rIL-2 at the same doses. the human MSLN BiTE is effective, over a range of doses, for limiting the growth of PDAs. the association of primate veterinarians recommends aseptic technique when opening cranial chambers. no studies have evaluated whether the use of strict aseptic technique mitigates levels of colonization within chambers. corynebacterium ulcerans and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common species identified on culture. total body irradiation (TBI) at GI doses is 100% lethal by 10-14 d. 20 5-6-mo-old, male GMP were exposed to either 12 or 16 Gy PBI employing 40-50% bone marrow sparing. ling demonstrated dose-dependent loss of crypts and subsequent mucosal ulceration. apoptosis only to a minimal extent at both doses. reductions in food tolerance, amino acid absorption, and citrulline production were dose-dependent. animals received tramadol 20 mg.kg-1 and meloxicam 10-20 mg.kg-1, by intraperitoneal injection. behavioral tests were performed within 60 minutes after anesthesia recovery. non-operated treated mice showed spontaneous locomotion activity similar to what was observed in the CTR group. licking of the paws and genitals was significantly lower in CM (20 mg.kg-1) group. tramadol 20 mg.kg-1, meloxicam 10 mg.kg-1 and lidocaine association did not interfere in general activity of these animals. systemic immunosuppression was induced using cyclosporine A (CsA) injected subcutaneously either five weeks after virus infection (modeling reactivation from latency; n=6) or concurrent to viral infection (modeling primary infection; n=4) the immune suppression was maintained over a three week period. doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) of at least 20 mg/kg may be necessary for adequate peri- and postoperative analgesia in the mouse. however, it is not known whether such NSAID doses exceed the threshold for gastrointestinal ulceration or induce other relevant pathology. mice destined for our barrier facilities are either tested to confirm absence of infectious agents or rederived to eliminate pathogens excluded from the barrier. this method is excellent at eliminating undesired pathogens, but requires technical expertise, surgical skills, specialized equipment. we propose a cross-fostering procedure that requires minimal manipulation of the fostered pups. transgenic mouse model harboring -MHC promoter driven (loxP)-TRPV4 transgene was bred to the MerCreMer inducible cardiac-specific Cre recombinase driver mouse. mCherry-reporter positive cells were no longer observed (0/29 cells from 3 mice; n=6 to 15 cells sampled per mouse) twelve rats were used to compare whole-body perfusion fixation to 2 different immersion fixation methods to determine the procedures that produced the highest-quality tissue sections in the most efficient manner. four additional rats were collected with all neural tissue remaining intact on the carcass and exposed post-fixation. SR-meloxicam is a commonly used and FDA approved nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug in dogs administered orally or subcutaneously every 24 h. a sustained-release formulation of SR-meloxicam (SR-meloxicam) has been shown to last up to 72 h in other species. meningitis is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in premature infants. the neonatal immune system has decreased inflammasome signaling compared to adults. but it is unknown what role inflammasome activation plays in NMEC meningitis. mice were assessed based on a pain and distress scale developed for the model. survival data was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier survival log rank. the mice lacking the IL-1 receptor succumb to the infection sooner. 25 percent soiled bedding was produced by combining 50 parts soiled bedding pet shop mice, 50 parts soiled bedding from an SOPF mouse isolator and 100 parts clean bedding. one SBS mouse from each cage was submitted monthly for testing by PCR and traditional methods for 3 mo. MHV was detected only in the HE nude CD-1 SBS by both PCR and serology. the mouse gut microbiome (GMB) will stabilize in 5 d when transported within a research facility. the outcome of therapeutic treatment success in humans has been linked to the GMB. using rats before their GMB has stabilized could impact study results. the greatest decreases among genera include Sarcina (95%), Turicibacter (87%), Caloramator (79%), Clostridium (79%), Bifidobacterium (78%), and Lactobacillus (67%). additional time points beyond 21 d may be necessary to determine the time required to stabilize the rat GMB after transport. a complete sequence was determined for the novel astrovirus from the research colony. this virus has 89% nucleotide homology to another recently reported astrovirus. the largest contig identified was 6,461 bps and contained 47 open reading frames (ORFs) tremor mutant phenotype is the result of a recessive mutation that arose spontaneously from a colony of Swiss mice. around postnatal day 21 (P21), mutants can be identified by the tremor, ataxia, motor incoordination, and tonic seizures. mutants showed Straub tail reaction, reduced rearing and grooming frequency, ataxia, tremor, and motor incoordination. mutation tremor could be involved into an impairment of the GABAergic transmission. some strains encode virulence factors that enable bacteria to cause intestinal and extra-intestinal infections. a total of 140 E. coli strains were isolated from 121 out of all 138 marmosets in the three colonies. in Colony A, 32 strains of E. coli were isolated from 26 of the 31 animals, 54.8% of the animals had pks+ E. coli. virulent E. coli strains can vary between different marmoset colonies. rhesus macaque is often a critical element of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies using rhesus macaques. three animals, previously implanted subcutaneously with a CSF ventricular reservoir, a lumbar port, and IV ports, received Inulin. intraventricularly administered Inulin was well tolerated in all subjects. Mean CSF PK clearance was 0.018 ml/min +/- 0.003 and the volume of distribution was 10.17 ml +/- 0.635. the morphology of the tropozoites was confirmed by trichorome and Giemsa staining. a PCR-based method was used for detection of TM in fecal samples. ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is an attractive species in which to model preterm brain injury because, like preterm human infants, they are born lissencephalic. postnatal white matter maturation and complex cortical folding in newborn ferrets also occur in a similar pattern to that observed in the human brain during the third trimester. Behavioral tests including negative geotaxis, cliff aversion, and spontaneous righting and walking (righting reflex) were performed 3x/week from P21-P42. a composite behavioral score increased from 2.3 at P21 to 13.0 at P43 (n=6-23 per time point). a medical-grade silicone/salt filled core has been developed to address shortcomings of current high strength sutures. despite its use on other sutures, a potential concern existed as to whether the silicone core in this suture could have a deleterious clinical impact. using a porcine model, 2 study groups were created. flow cytometry biomarkers were developed for characterization of the major populations of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) we analyzed distributions of these immune cells in blood samples of 4 breeds of minipigs. a novel flow cytometry approach has been developed to characterize the major porcine PBMCs in one single assay. EM Katz*1, DK Chu1, KM Casey1, K Jampachaisri2, S Felt1, C Pacharinsak1 1Department of Comparative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; 2Department of Mathematics, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand Tricaine Methanesulfonate (MS222) is widely used for anesthesia and euthanasia of zebrafish. no evidence of anesthetic-related histologic changes were noted. 100 mg/mL solutions of MS222 can be stored in opaque jars at 4\u00b0C or -20\u00b0C for 6 mo and be used to effectively anesthetize zebrafish. a comparative study of fasted mice versus nonfasted mice using this model proved that fasting does not adversely impact animal welfare, more focused intrarectal TNBS delivery. we tested the hypothesis that brief anesthesia during initial tail laceration will not elevate blood glucose or WBC during 2-h serial blood collection. glucose was measured using a retroorbital technique. after 24 h all mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. mice were euthanized prior to recovery. the tissue was thawed, homogenized by mincing, and 30l of tumor slurry implanted subcutaneously to the right flank of each mouse. the second method involved the cryopreservation of 5 small fragments (10-30mm3 per piece) which were divided amongst 5 NSG mice for subcutaneous trocar injection. mice aged 6- to 8-wk were injected intravenously with 107 peripheral blood mononuclear cells to induce GvHD. the results were determined by comparison of disease activity index (DAI) scores, flow cytometry, and survival curves between groups. more than 380 million people globally have diagnosed diabetes. insulin resistance is a central mechanism in obesity and type 2 diabetes. increased blood amylin occurs in patients with insulin resistance. a novel transgenic mouse model (L44) over-expresses the non-aggregating agonist, [25,28,29triprolyl]-hA in its -cells. these include pathogenic effects on systemic metabolic regulation (body weight, food intake, and blood glucose), levels of metabolic hormones (amylin, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) mice warmed on the slide warmer for 10 minutes averaged 35\u00b0C. rectal temperatures for mice averaged 36.7\u00b0C compared to 37.06\u00b0C for the electric blanket. adult sheep received intermittent boluses of 0.25% bupivacaine. sheep are dosed based on the volume of bupivacaine required to bathe the length of the incision. the average bolus dose of bupivacaine administered was 0.42 0.16 mg/kg. cynomolgus males (n=8) acquired the response faster with a moving stimulus. cynomolgus females (n=8) acquired the response faster with a stationary stimulus. cynomolgus females (n=8) acquired the response faster with a stationary stimulus. p19arf (p14arf in humans) stabilizes p53 by interacting with mdm2 (hdm2 in humans) conventional KO mice generated by replacing the exon 1 with Neomycin-resistance (NeoR) gene exhibited persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), an ophthalmic disease characterized with accumulation of perivascular cells and cataract. however, NeoR has been reported to cause undesirable sideeffects and complicate the manifestation of p243 male SCID Mice as new animal model for inflammatory breast cancer research. JC Illera*1, S Caceres1, G Silvan1, A Alonso-Diez1, L Pea2, CC Perez-Garcia3. male mice reproduced tumors with less frequency than female mice. despite male mice reproduced tumors with less frequency than female mice, these results showed that male mice could be a useful tool for in vivo IBC research. two CARMA2 point mutations associated with psoriasis were created by site-directed mutagenesis. transgenic keratinocytes were cultured and infected with lentiviral vector contain CARMA inhibitory serine/threonine kinase to investigate the expression levels of NF-kB targeted genes. the optimal dose of protein antigen used for priming and boosting animals depends on a variety of parameters. lower doses of antigen have been thought to drive more stringent selection (in terms of affinities) of antibodies in vivo. rodent pathogens may pose an animal biosecurity risk to laboratory rodent colonies due to the possibility of pathogen spillovers. rat species were identified as Rattus norvegicus (11/29; 37.9%) and Rattus rattus (18/29; 62.1%) antibodies to Hantaan virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, toolan\u2019s H-1 virus, mouse adenovirus type 1, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, sendai virus, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi were not detected. twenty-four of the 29 sentinels were seropositive and 14 of 29 were PCR positive. MRV detected by recipient institutions originated from the contaminated feed or bedding within the shipping boxes. the Yucatan minipig was selected as the preferred minipig model for microneedle evaluation based on high reproducibility of successful injections. a novel microneedle array was successfully inserted in Yucatan minipig skin with >90% insertion efficiency. the folate hydrolase gene (FOLH1) encodes for the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is highly overexpressed in human IBD where it is associated with robustly increased GCPII enzymatic activity (300-1000%) it is unclear if 2-PMPA is exerting its protective benefits in this model through a local or systemic action. a tetracyclic antidepressant is used in dogs and cats to treat nausea and inappetance. but a therapeutic dose of mirtazapine has not yet been established for this species. guinea pigs were administered mirtazapine once daily for 4 d. analysis was collected prior to the first dose of each session and at time points 0.5, 1, 2, 8, 12 and 24 h for each guinea pig during the dosing sessions and washout periods. significant differences in weight gains, feed intake, and fecal output were not present, as compared to 3 male guinea pigs of similar age given saline only. citrate tubes would produce variable results given its ability to chelate calcium. samples were divided into hirudin, lithium-heparin, and sodium citrate anticoagulant tubes. platelet function was analyzed using the MEA apparatus. a chronic toxicity study was performed to generate historical background control data in the RccHan:WIST rat model. one-hundred and thirty male and 130 female RccHan:WIST rats were pair-housed under standard housing and husbandry conditions. one-hundred previously nulliparous and virgin time-mated female Sprague Dawley rats were housed under standard housing and husbandry conditions with ad libitum access to a standard diet (18% protein, 6% fat) and water. rats were administered tap water (10 mL/kg body weight) by oral gavage once daily from gestational day 6 to 17. small doses of buprenorphine (0.05\u20133.0 mg/kg SQ) have been used which must be administered every 6 to 12 h. a more convenient dosing schedule may increase compliance. we recommend using a dose of 3.0 mg/kg in CD1 mice and 5.0 mg/kg in C57BL/6J mice to extend the duration of analgesia up to 24 h. the main side effect observed was hypoactivity in doses above and including 7 mg/kg. DNA was extracted from samples using the DNeasy Powerlyzer Powersoil kit. the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR. fecal and oral communities were significantly different from skin communities. a majority of allograft repairs today involve the use of an autograft. but due to the morbidity of graft harvest, there is an increased interest in allograft use. a majority of allograft patients will require a revision surgery. the experimental graft had a greater percentage of normal synovial cells. the graft had less graft breakdown and a greater amount of blood vessel formation on average. the biocompatibility of a gold nanoparticle tissue scaffold in a large animal model. the low dose of decitabine caused an early increase in proliferation. the d17 line had a significant increase in apoptosis at 12 h and 12 and 24 h with 6TG. each feed was imaged by both 2D bioluminescence and fluorescence. three of the test feeds had decreased or equivalent auto-luminescence signal compared to the control diet. male and female C57BL/6NTac mice were enriched for 22 OTUs. male mice were enriched for 10 OTUs corresponding to specific genera. male mice were enriched for 22 OTUs and males for 10 OTUs. noninvasive blood pressure measurements were collected from more than 100 healthy, ketamine-sedated, adult rhesus macaques. the reference interval calculated for the mean arterial pressure using a standard oscillometer was 38-129 mmHg at the brachium, 52-147 mmHg on the pelvic limb, and 54-124 mmHg at the tail. score, sex, type of sphygmomanometer, location of cuff placement were all found to significantly influence BP measurements. the influence of mouse strain, immune competency, and age on the pathogenesis of a field strain of minute virus of mice was examined. viral DNA levels in tissues and bodily excretions consistently increased over time in immune deficient mice inoculated as neonates. mortality observed in neonatal inoculates between 28 and 56 d after inoculation. clinical syndrome recapitulates clinical presentation reported for naturally infected, immune deficient NOD -chain knockout mice. immune competent Hsd:Athymic Nude-Fox1nuheterozygote (nu/+) and immune deficient homozygote (nu/nu) mice were inoculated by subcutaneous injection (SC) or orogastric gavage (OG) with 1 of 3 representative V. botryosastrains recovered from white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) Luminex polystyrene beads have been in use for more than 15 y for routine serosurveillance of nonhuman primate colonies. a new magnetic MagPlex microspheres was developed using the next generation magnetic MagPlex microspheres. a similar number of negative macaque sera were used from specific-pathogen free colonies. more than 3,000 assays were performed. overall diagnostic sensitivity of NHP MagPlex was 99% compared to 100% for PS MFIA. xmedetomidine(D) 0.5mg/kg, reversed with AT 1mg/kg. xmedetomidine(D) 0.5mg/kg + D 0.5mg/kg reversed with AT 3mg/kg. acepromazine(Ace) 3mg/kg reversal was done every 5\u2019 from LORR until RPR. a common cause of cell death is the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is characterized by a sudden increase in inner mitochondrial membrane permeability leading to ATP depletion, mitochondrial swelling, rupture, and ultimately cell death. mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured and were transfected with a control siRNA or an siRNA targeted against NipSnap2 to decrease protein levels. a parallel set of cells was infected with a control virus or a virus coded to produce NipSnap2 to increase levels of the protein. 8 to 10-wk-old Sprague Dawley rats were used in 2 toxicology studies. in the first study, 3 posters with different shapes and conspicuous graphics were used for visual cues. over 4 consecutive d, each rat was given 4 trial runs per day. methylcellulose (MC) is a nontoxic hydrophilic compound derived from cellulose that is frequently used as an emulsifier and thickener in a variety of food products. there is limited data describing the effects of repeated systemic delivery of MC, despite frequent use in preclinical studies. choroid plexus with lesions present in all animals that received IP MC. no significant effects of IP MC treatment on body weight gain, appearance, or general behavior. repeated IP MC administration may confound any interpretation of drug-induced pathologic lesions. only 15% of Ulk1/HbbTh3/+ mice survived for 30 d (n=15), compared to 80% of Ulk1+/+HbbTh3/+ mice (n=20) (P 0.05). -thalassemic-treated mice showed reduced thalassemic hallmarks. a literature search revealed that there are currently no validated and published methods for survival blood collection in neonates. 11 Abcd1 KO and 6 WT neonates were weighed on postnatal day 5 and then bled via the facial vein. weight gain increased by an average of 41% for the WT neonates and an average of 43% for the KO neonates. a successful survival facial vein bleed is possible in neonatal mice without any adverse effects. the establishment of this technique will enable monitoring of leukocyte development in multiple mouse models of disease. the length of reflex absence determined the surgical anesthesia starting time. the recovery time was determined when all reflexes were recovered. another 6 male rabbits were administered MMB by IM. the most commonly used model for predicting absorption process in humans is Caco-2 cell monolayer system. in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) is a comparatively direct approach of measuring compound absorption. the HEPI does not include research costs because not all higher education institutions have research programs. the HEPI does not include research costs because not all higher education institutions have research programs. index predicting cost trend associated with an animal program operation provides a more accurate, evidenced-based approach to building 5- and 10-year animal program financial models. using an index-based cost to build financial models helps guard against developing unrealistic financial models. most LERU programs have mice and rats, while fewer programs have monkeys. in LERU programs less than 50% of institutions cover an animal program deficit. almost 100% of such deficits in U.S. programs are covered by the institution. virology and serology services are most frequently outsourced. the Matrix highlights waste as never before. management was able to pinpoint the precise location of inefficiencies. bettas are purchased from a variety of breeders which can bring unwanted pathogens with them. bettas are purchased from a variety of breeders which can bring unwanted pathogens with them. results identified an outlier among our rodent clinical health team. the ratio of new cases/clinical visits suggested that he rechecked ulcerative dermatitis cases more frequently than his peers despite having significantly longer days to resolution. single-housed animals flagged in the system which prompts periodic reevaluation. migration from paper-based social housing records to this digital method has greatly improved accuracy, consistency, simplified our social housing documentation. 144.24 lux (highest setting) or at 3.23 lux (lowest setting) LED red lights for 60 min before euthanization via decapitation. brains and blood were collected for subsequent testing of c-Fos mRNA levels and corticosterone hormone measurement. increased c-Fos mRNA in various regions of neocortex. national institutes of health (NIH) published guidelines that help to enhance rigor and support research that is reproducible, robust, and transparent. the guide and the new NIH initiative, this metric enhances our ability to monitor and report lighting parameters that may lead to improved scientific outcomes. current recommendation for exposure limits is 2 parts per million/hour. this is based on a study conducted on other halogenated gasses in 1978. this promotes little to no exposure to anesthetic waste gas. lab animals experimentally infected with rabies virus present unique management challenges for animal facility personnel, veterinarians, and the IACUC. rabies-infected animals pose a potential health risk to employees, present obstacles to performing veterinary and experimental procedures. rabies-infected animals pose a potential health risk to employees, and require more intense animal welfare and protocol oversight. light entrains the master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain. blue-enriched light (460-480 nm) increases the amplitude of the nighttime circadian melatonin signal by 7-fold compared with broad-spectrum (300-700 nm) cool white fluorescent (CWF) lighting. animals in an IACUC-approved protocol were maintained for 8 wk on a common lighting regimen 12L (300 lux; 123 W/cm2; lights on 0600 h):12D (0 lux) on either CWF (control) or bLAD (experimental) lighting. adult mice maintained in bLAD vs. CWF had lower (P 0.001) dietary (-15.4 0.3%) and water intake (-13.1 0.1%), eight breeder pairs of long Evans and CD rats were randomly assigned into 1 of 4 treatments groups: red cage-200 lux, red cage-25 lux, clear cage-200 lux, or clear cage-25 lux. during the light cycle, CD rats preferred the 25 lux environments without distinct preference for cage color. cage change schedules and choice of environmental enrichment vary widely across laboratories. response to cage changes was assessed in >250 pair housed female C57Bl/6 mice or single housed C57Bl/6J mice housed singly in cages containing either mixed seeds on corncob or soft cob bedding. continuous monitoring of motion and breathing rate provides meaningful longitudinal insights into animals\u2019 responses to routine cage changing procedure and environmental enrichment. in mice, it is widely accepted that blood glucose values are obtained on a background of stress caused by handling, restraint, and sample collection. BG declined gradually, reaching clinical hypoglycemia (3.9 mM) after 11 h, and dropping further to 2.70.5 mM at 14 h of fasting. stress-induced glucose excursions can be a major confounder in metabolic studies. fasting beyond 7-8 h in mice is a severe metabolic stress. spleens were isolated and stimulated with OVA and cultured for 72 h. cytokine levels were significantly elevated in the saline, SR-Bup, and SR-Bup mice compared to unstimulated splenocytes. study examining chemotherapeutic tolerability of common DNA damaging oncology drugs in female R2G2 mice. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin (Doxo) and cyclophosphamide (n=10 per group) were given at 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice weekly for 5 wk. PS17 Patient-derived and Cell Line Xenograft Growth in the B6;129-Rag2tm1FwaIL2rgtm1Rsky/DwlHsd (R2G2) mouse model. PDXs examined include colorectal and head and neck cancers. the human esophageal adenocarcinoma FLO1 cells were examined in 2 studies. the human esophageal adenocarcinoma FLO1 cells were injected into both flanks of R2G2 and SCID mice. a safe and simple oral vaccination strategy with an immune adjuvant during infancy is sufficient to counteract heritable cancer risk associated with a carcinogenic microbiome. we found that feeding 10ug of sterile Vibrio cholerae exotoxin subunit B for a total of 3 times every other week was sufficient to significantly inhibit cancers development when compared with matching controls at 9-mo of age. one in 10 newborns are born premature and receive an average of 14 +/- 4 painful procedures daily in the hospital. the effect on chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain is unknown. ipsilateral limb use characterized by decreased standing weight distribution on the ipsilateral limb (P 0.0001), reduced maximum contact area (P 0.0001), reduced intensity (P 0.0001) and longer swing phase (P 0.0001) during walking. early RNP injury appears to heighten pain due to OA-induced by MIA. study was designed to test the hypothesis that co-culture of AF and NP would be associated with significantly higher levels of inflammatory and degradative metabolite production compared to separate AF and NP mono-cultures. significant differences in IL-6, KC, MMP2, MMP3, NO, and PGE2 levels were noted between co-culture and NP mono-culture. chronic diabetes in the Yucatan miniature swine manifests with progressive effects on heart rate, PR interval, and QRS duration. a heart rate correction for the QT interval (QTc) was calculated using the Fridericia method. multiple frogs in a colony of western clawed frogs were reported for a similar presentation including bloating, coelomic distention, and lethargy. all frogs were used for oocyte collection and had been injected with human chorionic gonadotropin to stimulate ovulation approximately 1-4 wk prior to presentation. the moderate to severe amount of vitellogenin and red blood cells seen on several serosal surfaces of organs within the coelomic cavity is indicative of either the over-production or release of vitellogenin from the increased catabolism of oocytes. OHSS is an iatrogenic condition and has been reported in Xenopus spp., as well as in humans, due to exogenous hCG injections. three-view thoracic radiographs confirmed severe megaesophagus. a gastroesophageal intussusception was discovered immediately cranial to the diaphragm. the mesenteric blood vessels were engorged with diffuse congestion of the small intestines. the model is used to study chronic granulomatous disease and to evaluate the role of phagocyte-derived oxidants in inflammation. 50% of the mice presented with liver lesions during scheduled terminal blood collection. serum chemistry analysis showed hypernatremia (Na+: 160 mmol/L), azotemia (BUN: 39 mg/dL), and increased albumin (4.9 g/dL), consistent with dehydration. white carneau pigeon (Columba livia) presented with acute onset left leg lameness. the animal was used in operant conditioning studies during the previous 4 y. the pigeon was euthanized, necropsied, and tissues submitted for histopathology. histology revealed a T-cell lymphoma in the left kidney. lymphomas comprise only 5% of tumors. the history and acute onset of symptoms confused the differential diagnosis. the animal was prescribed milk of magnesia 10mg/kg PO SID, meloxicam 0.1mg/kg SQ SID, and the simethicone dose was increased to 40 mg BID as continued supportive care. the animal was euthanized and submitted for necropsy. the rabbit was slightly underconditioned with mild serous nasal discharge and a body temperature of 105.7\u00b0F. differential diagnoses for the inappetance, sneezing, fever, and weight loss included a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. thoracic radiographs were obtained due to poor response to therapy. a 1.6 kg male, singly housed, Southern Giant Pouched Rat presented with right-sided facial swelling. the rat was anesthetized for medical CT, which showed severe lysis and periosteal reactions along the entire length of the right mandible. the rat was transitioned to injectable meloxicam (1 mg/kg SC SID) and long-acting cefovecin (8 mg/kg SC) due to poor prognosis, euthanasia was elected. nano-CT was performed, which confirmed changes seen on medical CT. rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) had been previously diagnosed with endometriosis. for the past 5 y had been treated with monthly medroxyprogesterone (40mg) injections. the animal was sedated 3 d later for physical exam, bloodwork, and an ultrasound examination. there are 2 constants: discussion on harm/benefit of a study design and how the 3Rs can decrease the harm. each institution has a mechanism to record discussions at IACUC meetings and in many instances use forms, templates, or checklists. the challenges included recruiting committee members from a region away from research-hubs, training a new IACUC quorum, assignment of responsibilities, coordination for a committee comprised of several members unaffiliated with the institution. it became incumbent upon the company to self-educate by scheduling weekly meetings and discussions to determine what was needed of the institution. the compliance unit standard procedure (CUSP) project offers an option to address administrative burden at the institutional level. the goal of this project is to create an online repository where institutions can share standard procedures used in animal care protocols with the animal welfare compliance community. training is provided by the microsurgery team, which consists of 4 skilled experimental microsurgeons. staff members are required to train in practical procedures at least twice a year. in existence for 5 y, the roundtable has produced a diverse portfolio of activities on a range of topics, including practical, scientific, educational, and regulatory. we provide concise information regarding each of the topics covered by the roundtable to date, including developments that have taken place since then. we discuss each of the topics covered by the roundtable to date, including developments that have taken place since then. the 3Rs self-assessment tool allows higher education institutions to benchmark their 3Rs activities and progress. the tools are secure, interactive, online resources that map scores longitudinally. we are supporting universities to deliver on their commitments to the 3Rs. a canine adoption program was developed to satisfy our desire to retire the research beagles. the program focused on the following areas: harness and leash, basic manners, new locations and experiences, novel floor textures, and novel sounds. the training program was managed by 2 technicians that performed daily 20-m sessions for each dog. an animal welfare and compliance office developed a web-based platform to facilitate an interactive review system. the interactive system has been implemented across 3 campuses and has proven effective in allowing a timely and efficient IACUC review. the benefits include reducing email volume for the animal welfare and compliance office, the IACUC, and the principal investigators. the registry does not account for every line on campus, but is a powerful tool to assist the investigator looking for a line which may benefit their research. a more refined method for data collection from the IACUC and ARP animal order databases is being developed along with a secure searchable database to take the place of the Excel spreadsheet. mice were weaned at 21 days old (Day 0) and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. animals were video recorded over 12 h on d 133, 137, 151, 158, and 179. results indicated a statistically significant decrease in aggressive behaviors of mice in partially divided cages compared to mice in standard cages. two IVC rack vendors, vendor A and vendor B, developed in-line EAP collection devices. compared efficacies for detecting murine infectious agents using EAP-PCR. all materials used were decontaminated or sterilized. both EAP capture media detected the infectious agents in naturally infected mice monitored over a 3-mo period. the EAP real-time PCR technology can serve as an adjunct method of HM, leads to the reduction of mice used for routine HM. video scoring, weight loss analysis, and amylase paper saliva analysis were conducted to determine the most preferred device. the most preferred wooden devices were tongue depressor. the most preferred plastic device was a commercially available flexible polymer chew. 2.8% of male mice housed in groups of 2 or more, respectively. aggression in mice is multifactorial and is influenced by factors thought to be controlled for, such as the external environment. study also helps provide a framework for housing at risk or valuable animals used in research. zebra finches were found to interact readily with water and dust baths. only water baths were used for bathing; dust baths were used primarily for foraging. results support the notion that water baths are a valuable form of enrichment for zebra finches. a 14-d cage change at 60 ACH in product B was compared to a 21-d cage change at 30 ACH in product A. product B averaged 6.4 pups per litter and had 27 litters total. product A averaged 7.3 pups per litter. a successful pair is defined as stable cohousing of 4 mo or longer. of the successful pairs, 5% were young animals (less than 5 y of age) of the successful pairs, 42% were a young animal paired with an adult. 53% of the pairs were adult macaques. animals were transported to ABSL-2 quarantine, anesthetized, and samples were taken for a global panel of 50 pathogens. the lab was then cleared to perform surgeries and behavioral testing within the ABSL-2 suite. successful introduction of wild-caught rodents into our vivaria resulted in reevaluation and refinement of our animal husbandry practices. the fewest pups were culled from tunnel cages for reasons including runts, hair loss, and picked whiskers. weekly per-cage averages were reduced 60% compared to aspen chips (P 0.0001) and 61% compared to vendor A (P 0.0001). three groups of preterm piglets with 8, 12, 13 piglets were delivered via Caserean section, resuscitated, and allowed to recover in a controlled environment. each piglet was provided a group of caregivers, including members of the NICU staff, a veterinary technician, and direct oversight of the NICU physician and veterinarian. the study was incredibly challenging from a medical and husbandry aspect. both CPRC facilities, Sabana Seca Field Station, and the free-ranging island of cayo Santiago, were severely affected. the CPRC took care of more than 4,000 rhesus macaques. SSFS has received a grant from the lab animal, primatology, and research communities. the project is underway to rebuild both facilities. women are generally cardiometabolically protected from obesity. both obese male and female mice developed mild hyperglycemia (P = 0.021 diet, P = 0.265 gender, P = 0.463 interaction), insulin resistance (P = 0.001 diet, P = 0.444 gender, P = 0.249 interaction), and glucose intolerance (P = 0.001 diet, P = 0.156 gender, P = 0.685 interaction) female mice developed obesity-related insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (P = 0.001 diet, P = 0.156 gender, P corynebacterium bovis is the causative agent of corynebacterium-associated hyperkeratosis (CAH) in immunocompromised mice. the resulting skin pathology can be profound and may be associated with severe wasting. the administration of antibiotics is effective in resolving disease, but does not eradicate the bacterium. no intact phage sequences were identified in any of the isolates. all isolates had at least 1 confirmed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system. toxin-antitoxin systems, shown to mediate defense mechanisms against phage infection, were detected in the majority. murine astrovirus 1 (MuAstV1) is endemic in many research and production laboratory mouse colonies. this virus is most closely related to astroviruses isolated from 2 feral rat species in china and a virus recently identified in feral mice in new york city. soiled bedding sentinel animals are most commonly used to monitor rodent colony health in research facilities. EAD testing via PCR has emerged as an adjunct method or replacement for sBS monitoring. soiled bedding sentinel animals are most commonly used. pathogens tested were all agents excluded in the SPB rooms. the SB included the typical agents excluded in most rodent SPF facilities. the SPB rooms also excluded Helicobacter spp., Pasteurella pneumotropica, and mouse norovirus (MNV) infestations are clinically inapparent in most mouse strains. infestations with D. musculi are increased and clinical signs have been reported in several strains of immunodeficient mice. romised mice had the highest mite burdens, which correlated with high PCR copy numbers. no significantdifferences between infested and naive animals were observed. a 1-way ANOVA was used to compare MAC, heart, and respiratory rates between the injections. BUP reduced MAC by 18% in females (1.720.08% control; 1.410.09% BUP) and 26% in males (1.820.03% control; 1.330.15% BUP). a change from baseline can be detectable prior to onset of visual clinical signs. a change from baseline can be detectable prior to onset of visual clinical signs. commercially available systems which include a large-scale ClO2 gas generator and specialized air-tight exposure chamber can be costly and impractical in some situations. the goal of this study was to create and validate an effective, small-scale, decontamination method using ClO2 gas. based on the size of the tote and whether BI are used, the upfront cost is approximately $75-$750. this method is roughly 100 times less expensive than large-scale gas generators used with specialized air-tight exposure chambers. leopard geckos were matched by weight and sex, then randomly divided into treatment groups. geckos assigned to the treatment group were provided non-supplemented crickets over the course of 90 d. the nonpharmaceutical grade sedative chlorprothixene has been widely used to reduce spontaneous eye movement in pupillary light reflex imaging. sedatives have been widely used to reduce spontaneous eye movement in pupillary light reflex imaging, and to lower the isoflurane to a level that does not substantially weaken light-evoked responses. acupuncture is a nondrug therapy modality that can be useful in laboratory animal medicine. five clinical cases are presented (4 successes, 1 failure) to illustrate potential usefulness/limitations of acupuncture in lab animal care. eight owl monkeys with OMWD received twice weekly vitamin B12 aquapuncture at 4 points: PC6, stomach 36 (ST36), gallbladder 34, and spleen 6. a 13-y-old male Aotus had intermittent melena/diarrhea refractory to Western medical treatment. an ultrasound exam was negative for neoplasia. twenty-four cynomolgus macaques (4 groups, 12 M/12F) were prepared for a 6-8 h anesthesia including presurgical analgesia, induction of anesthesia with ketamine/medetomidine, intubation, clipping, disinfection, and placement in a stereotactic frame. animals were transferred to the MRI to obtain data for calculation of position and angle and depth for catheter placement. meloxicam is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to manage pain in rodents. an extended release formulation, MSR, has been developed to provide 72 h continuous analgesia. the median time to first lesion in the MSR treatment group was 3 d (95% confidence interval 2-3 d), showing a very consistent pattern. the median time to first lesion in the MSR treatment group was 3 d (95% confidence interval 2-3 d), again highly significantly different from the control group (P 0.001). 3 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) affected with chronic dermatitis were assessed using a novel Macaque Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (MADESI) this scoring system was adapted from one widely used in dogs. a spot-on PUFA treatment reduced chronic dermatitis and improved the quality of life in affected macaques. a series of studies evaluating the use of a multimodal buprenorphine and bupivacaine analgesic regimen in a rat thoracic spinal contusion model. treatment groups received a preoperative subcutaneous line block of bupivacaine (8 mg/kg) and varying regimens of buprenorphine treatment: buprenorphine HCl (0.05 mg/kg) every 8h for 24h or 72h. pruritus associated with buprenorphine administration has been reported in primates. a long-acting, highly concentrated formulation of buprenorphine is available as a single dose, injectable solution that provides therapeutic plasma concentrations lasting 24 h in rhesus macaques. six healthy, adult rhesus macaques were included in a randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study. the low dose achieved a maximum plasma concentration of 19.1 5.68 ng/mL at 19.6 4.02 h with an AUC of 236.4 22.5 h/ng/mL. twenty-five cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) 8-13-mo-old presented with acute, unilateral exophthalmos over a 6-mo period. the cotton rats otherwise appeared healthy and had no previous clinical signs of disease. the majority of affected cotton rats were retired breeders. canine X-linked muscular dystrophy is a well-established model for duchenne muscular dystrophy in humans. phy are potential surgical interventions for cotton rats presenting with exophthalmia. sufentanil was administered as a continuous rate infusion (1.5g/kg/hr) the patient was induced with intravenous boluses of sufentanil (1.5g/kg), midazolam (0.2mg/kg) and etomidate (2mg/kg to effect) the patient developed gastric dilatation without volvulus, which was corrected with orogastric intubation and suction to decompress. the AVMA guidelines for euthanasia of animals recommends injectable pentobarbital and inhalant CO2. however, barbiturates are controlled substances and challenging to use. there is limited literature on the use of CO2 in avian species. ethanol (n=4, 1052.60s +/- 200.01s) and pentobarbital (n=5, 772.2s +/- 54.67s) groups by 2-sample t-test (P = 0.0005) there was a total of 8 chickens (4 per group), who failed to reach asystole. there were no significant histological changes and there was no degradative effect on RNA extraction. adult cull zebra finches received an IPC injection of 0.5mL of saline (n=21), 0.5mL of 100% ethanol (n=22), or 0.05mL sodium pentobarbital (n=21) finches were placed in an observation box and video recorded. xenopus laevis is an efficacious and novel method of euthanasia in zebra finches. a pilot study using 4 adult female X. laevis was conducted to assess the safety of a feeder and its effects on behavior. experimental frogs spent less time clumped together than control frogs in the intermediate period. stereotypic behavior was seen in a control frog 14% of the time across feeding days. stereotypic behavior in other frogs was observed 10% of the time. subjects showed the strongest preference for the back of the tank when housed with mirrored paper on the side of the tank compared to the barren half of the tank. fish were also observed interacting with 3 of the other items in species-specific behaviors. a singly housed neighbor fish, group-housed neighbor fish, or an empty neighbor tank. video-based systems offer distinct advantages in being able to recognize discreet behaviors. some video-monitoring functions have been designed into specialized mouse racks. we demonstrate a mechanical design that uses 3-D printing technology. the alert system accurately identified 83.3% of desired alerts, while only falsely identifying 6.6% of alerts. an animal alerting system improves animal welfare by enhancing the ability of vivarium staff and researchers to automatically identify animals that need more careful observation, or should be euthanized. trainers deemed proficient are capable of consistently and accurately performing the specific techniques with an 80 to 100% pass rate. each year the technicians are reassessed and deemed proficient. callipers only 9% of measurements are within 25% of the measured excised tumor mass compared with 60% using our 3D scanning method. results show much promise for reducing the handling and use of mice and decreasing cost and duration of cancer drug development. group-housed mice are a serious welfare concern, but so too is housing mice singly. crowdsourcing data project allowed data to be collected from multiple institutions. 143 animal technicians from 9 countries participated in the study. the results will be used to generate a published evidence base to support best practice to minimize aggressive behavior in group-housed, male mice. over a 10-wk period we studied 12 groups of 4 to 12-wk-old male Sprague-Dawley rats housed in either standard laboratory rat cages (58cmL, 38cmW, 22cmH). the increase in positive affiliative behavior, reduced aggression, and reduced self-directed behavior suggests that rats housed in tower cages have improved welfare compared to rats in s2tandard. all animal studies were ethically reviewed and carried out in accordance with the GSK policy on the care, welfare and treatment of animals. frogs and Bacteroides uniformis were cultured from one of the frogs. the history of compromised recirculating water system and the pathognomonic lesions of gas bubbles are diagnostic for gas bubble disease. all other frogs recovered with no additional morbidity or mortality noted in the colony. the mouse was submitted to a commercial laboratory for culture and PCR of C. bovis, S. xylosus, and Corynebacterium spp. (HAC2) all test results were negative. the mouse was then submitted for full histopathologic evaluation. at 1 y of age presented with acute onset left-sided hemiparesis. the animal had exhibited self-injurious behavior at 7 y of age. he had exhibited self-injurious behavior at 7 y of age following experimental amphetamine treatment. a 1-y-old CD rat exposed to an experimental nerve agent presented with an approximately 5 x 4 cm mass with focal necrosis on the left distal thorax. the firm, infiltrative mass had multifocal cysts containing serosanguinous fluid. a second surgery involved relocating the implant and fully excising the mass. the rat recovered without complications and survived to the study endpoint. a 15-y-old female baboon on an IACUC-approved protocol was examined for a firm swelling in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. the animal had no abnormalities noted on prestudy physical examination 7 mo prior, or during study-related procedures 2 mo prior to the mass being observed. euthanasia was elected and a complete necropsy was performed. a 7-mo-old castrated male, 33 kg, Yucatan miniature pig received a myocardial infarction, jugular catheter, and daily amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic. two wk after cell injection, routine blood chemistry screening revealed elevated GGT (93 U/L) and AST (100 U/L), and hypercholesterolemia (378 mg/dL). hepatopathy and hyperthyroidism are known side effects of amiodarone. the pig was examined for hypothermia and hypothermia. euthanasia and necropsy were also noted. adult wildtype zebrafish presented with marked generalized coelomic distention and erect scales. differentials included renal damage or failure, coelomic cavity mass/tumor, systemic infection(s) and branchial abnormality. the bacterial infection noted is most likely secondary to the primary neoplastic mass and may be associated with immunosuppression secondary to its chronicity. microsporidium spores within the spinal cord were consistent with Pseudoloma neurophilia. the clinical signs and lesions noted in this case are consistent with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) the pathogenesis of PDNS is still ill-defined, yet there is evidence for an immune-mediated component. this case demonstrates the impact of immunosuppression in mini pigs. 14 bacterial isolates were preliminarily identified as Campylobacterspecies based on morphological characteristics using gram-staining, scanning electron microcopy (SEM) and biochemical assays. further speciation was performed to differentiate Campylobacter isolates at a species level using multiple biochemical and molecular tools. the subsequent whole genome sequence revealed the Biotyper system correctly identified them at the species level. rats, a model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, startle easily and can be difficult to work with. they respond positively to gentle handling and \u201ctickling\u201d by humans. this refinement decreases anxiety-like behavior and makes these animals easier to handle. mouse norovirus (MNV) and mouse parvovirus (MPV) are among the most common adventitious viral infections in laboratory mice. some have implicated nonirradiated feed as a source of MPV in rodent facilities. some have implicated nonirradiated feed as a source of MPV. irradiation and autoclaving effectively prevented seroconversion of mice exposed to high doses of MNV contaminated pellets. irradiation and autoclaving effectively prevented seroconversion of mice exposed to high doses of MNV contaminated pellets while 1 mouse seroconverted at the highest dose for MPV. the aim of this study was to compare the antibody titer and seroconversion kinetics of heterozygous nude Crl:NU(Ncr)-Foxn1nu/+ (Het-nude) and CD1-E dirty bedding sentinels to murine norovirus. there was no significant difference between antibody titers to murine norovirus between Het-nude and CD1-E mice. corynebacterium bovis (C. bovis) is a gram-positive bacterium that causes hyperkeratotic dermatitis in immunocompromised mice. it is unknown whether immunocompetent mice become subclinically infected and shed infectious material. our results suggest that B6 mice do not actively amplify C. bovis. these data provide information for management decisions and diagnostic testing during a C. bovis outbreak. a neighbor-joining tree for the Corynebacterium genus revealed C. falsenii as the genetically closest species to C. bovis. the average number of putative genomic islands and virulence factors were significantly higher in rodent isolates compared to the human/bovine isolates. we isolated a novel Helicobacter species, H. saguini, from CTTs with chronic colitis. IL-10/ specific-pathogen free mice orally inoculated were not colonized with H. saguini; however, H. saguini mono-infection in germfree IL-10-/- mice developed IBD. histology of the colon revealed moderately severe colitis with mild epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia in 5/10 infected mice (4 males, 1 female) controls appeared clinically and histologically normal. astrovirus was genetically divergent from muAstV1 commonly present in research mice. it was closely related to viruses isolated from feral Norwegian and Sikham rats in china. astrovirus was recently identified in feral mice in new york city. magPlex is quick and easy to separate from solution using a magnetic separator. antigens for several common infectious agents in mice and rats were part of the 33- and 28-member mouse and rat MFIA bead panels. exhaust air dust testing is a sensitive tool in screening for rodent infectious agents on individually ventilated cage (IVC) racks. previous reports for EAD testing using an inline filter proved the detection of MNV. adenovirus, rotavirus, M. pulmonis, P. pneumotropica, S. moniliformis, Cryptosporidium, S. muris, and tritrichomonas were detected by EAD only. soiled bedding sentinel testing detected more infectious agents than soiled bedding sentinel testing. a 3000-cubic foot lab was sealed and equipped with an AHP generation system and biosafety cabinet. the generator controlled the injection of 7% hydrogen peroxide and pulse phases. three decontamination times and 6 repeatable treatments were tested. midazolam is a fast-acting benzodiazepine commonly used in veterinary medicine that causes muscle relaxation, hypnosis, and has little cardiovascular effects. the intranasal administration of midazolam is often used to sedate human pediatric patients for noninvasive procedures, eliminating injection-associated stress in the recipients. X. laevis is a sexually dimorphic species, but phenotypic signs of sexual maturation can take 1 to 2 y to develop. ultrasound waves allow for easy identification of the majority of X. laevis coelomic organs. s were recorded in 4 adult males and 4 adult females. half of the females were also imaged before and after hormonally induced ovulation. this is a non-invasive technique commonly used for egg harvesting. nanogels containing N-isopropylacrylamide, Dextran-lactate-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and acrylic acid were synthesized by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. nanoparticles were characterized with respect to size, zeta potential, yield, and insulin loading efficiency and capacity. nanogels could load insulin with extremely high loading efficiency of >98%. libactin, Cytolethal Distending Toxin, and Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor Colonize Laboratory Rats. genotoxins include the polyketide synthase (pks) pathogenicity island, cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) and hemolysin-associated cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf) these strains are not excluded from rodents housed under specific-pathogen free conditions in academic or all genotoxin-associated strains were members of pathogen-associated phylogroup B2. cdt or cnf was never present together or without pks. findings suggest genotoxin-encoding E. coli colonize laboratory rats. mmary gland tumors prime microglia and augment the inflammatory profile and behavior of mice. after 16 d of tumor growth, there were no differences in inflammatory markers in the hippocampus or serum apart from increased serum CXCL1 concentrations in tumor-bearing mice. the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is responsible for normal vocal fold (VF) movement. the RLN is at risk for iatrogenic injury during anterior neck surgical procedures in human patients, resulting in subsequent VF paralysis that may contribute to swallow, voice, and respiratory dysfunction. IPF affects more than 5 million people in the world and can be as high as 400 cases per 100,000 people over 65 years old. a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF in animal models will haveten the development of antifibrotic drugs. CD36 null mice showed less fibrosis on histology and by hydroxyproline assay of lung tissue. these studies support a novel mechanism of how AEC injury initiates progressive fibrosis. they reveal CD36 as a potential therapeutic target against fibrosis. two experimental groups of heterozygous (HET) rats were chronically exposed to 1 of 2 different known environmental triggers of CD. either a low-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID; diclofenac, 1.25 mg/kg/PO) or ad libitum Western diet formulated rodent feed. each group contained 24 animals cohoused by sex and experimental group. rial pathogenesis and Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY; 3Comparative Bioscience Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY. alternative therapies are needed due to antibiotic resistance. lysins encode novel antimicrobial agents as they can degrade bacterial cell wall resulting in hypotonic lysis. lysostaphin treated areas were swabbed before, during, and after treatment to determine MRSA colony forming units (CFUs) the CFU count decreased below detectable levels (100 CFU/mL) in the nostrils and peri-rectal area in all animals after decontamination and antibiotic treatment. fenbendazole (FBZ-QS, 1 mg/ml) may provide a cost effective, non-precipitating, liquid alternative to medicated feeds. fenbendazole has been formulated as a medicated rodent feed with demonstrated success treating pinworms. no evidence of dehydration was detected and mice gained weight as expected. results for balb/c mice (Balb/cAnNHsd), Wistar (Hsd:WI) and Sprague-Dawley rats (Hsd:Sprague Dawley) are pending. multiple animals had rampant pneumocystis pneumonia, evidence of bacterial infections, and severe renal hemorrhagic medullary nephritis. one animal had early histologic changes to the liver consistent with lymphoma. at least 1 animal had evidence of porcine circovirus-associated porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and 2 had severe disseminated porcine cytomegalovirus infection. differential diagnoses included mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine circovirus-2, swine influenza virus, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, porcine respiratory coronavirus, Salmonella enterica ser. Choleraesuis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Streptococcus suis. a marked increase in the number of mice presenting with a head tilt was observed in numerous holding rooms within 1 of our 3 barrier vivaria. all mice had tympanic bulla empyema, which was evident histologically as marked suppurative bacterial otitis media. burkholderia spp. was isolated from hepatic and brain lesions in 1 mouse. a subset of these isolates were speciated by MALDI-TOF as Burkholderia gladioli. only one other account of B. gladioli infection in laboratory mice has been reported. microbial surveillance program was implemented using daily RODAC plating of gloved hands and various surfaces. results showed growth of specific organisms on gloves and surfaces which often matched those identified later as contaminants in animals that underwent surgery the day of the environmental monitoring. animals were euthanized and submitted for further diagnostics. differential diagnoses included infection, graft vs host disease, anemia secondary to xenographic bone marrow displacement, and graft failure. all 44 murine pathogens tested were negative. non-invasive methods to evaluate the gastrointestinal tract are limited to radiography with or without the use of intra-oral barium. a protocol for focused ultrasound assessment of the cranial abdomen of marmosets was developed. this technique was incorporated into biannual health screenings of the marmoset colony. this focused ultrasound technique is easy to incorporate with routine health assessments of a colony and normal ranges generated in this study will be clinically useful for further studies of gastrointestinal disease in this species. affected animals showed 3 clinical syndromes: peracute death; severe diarrhea leading to death or euthanasia; and mild to moderate diarrhea followed by recovery. all of these mice could be found within a single cage, occasionally alongside clinically unaffected cage mates. one pyometra was managed medically, with Clavamox (62.5 mg BID) and Lutalyse (0.25 mg/kg daily for 5 d) this queen became pregnant and underwent a gravid ovariohysterectomy. a pregnant queen then presented in dystocia after passing 2 stillborn kittens. 7 rabbits from 2 independent cohorts presented with inappetence and diarrhea. each cohort consisted of both male and female New Zealand White rabbits. the February cohort had 4 rabbits present with inappetence, and 2 with concurrent diarrhea. rabbits were fed a low-fiber diet prior to shipment, thus predisposing them to bacterial dysbiosis. new practices, such as increasing fiber content upon arrival, were set in place to prevent potential future cases of dysbiosis following shipment. sterile struvite urolithiasis is rare in dogs without a concurrent urinary tract infection. in 2017, dogs (n=2, males, about 3-y-old) maintained as part of a veterinary research colony on unrelated protocols were diagnosed with urolithiasis. urine was collected via ultrasound-guided cystocentesis. the average urine pH of the examined animals was 7.65. struvite crystalluria was observed in 36% (8 of 22) of samples. cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was sedated for an experimental surgical procedure with ketamine and dexmedetomidine. anesthesia was induced with propofol (0.4mg/kg IV) to facilitate intubation. a moderate amount of blood-tinged fluid was observed in the endotracheal tube. an echocardiogram confirmed right ventricular enlargement with no evidence of valvular regurgitation. the diagnosis was determined to be congestive cardiomyopathy. the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. a cohort of 10 4.5-y-old laying hens suspected for ovarian cancer was administered a 6-wk course of paclitaxel to assess chemotherapeutic efficacy. results are indicative of chemotherapeutic tolerability and efficacy, as well as the value of using a noninvasive method for diagnosis of cancer within the coelomic cavity. a blood chemistry analysis had the most striking abnormality being a moderately elevated BUN and a moderate to severely elevated BUN/creatinine ratio. a coagulation panel demonstrated elevated fibrinogen levels but all other parameters were within normal limits. the animal was euthanized due to a poor prognosis. a pair of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) with an unknown genetic load, carriers of splay leg syndrome were mated, resulting in an offspring of 5:2 dysplastic animals studied for a period of 180 d to determine its influence over morphologic and skeletal deviations. results showed drastically impaired locomotion, limited abduction, and progressive bilateral dysplasia with acetabular involvement. a 1-y-old female spayed pig presented with nonweight-bearing lameness of the left hindlimb. there was severe swelling proximal to the coronary band on the fourth digit of the left hindlimb. differential diagnoses include trauma versus infection. pig regained full use of her hind limb and was euthanized at 15 wk post procedure. pig was able to be used in a study, and was euthanized at 15 wk post procedure. pig was reported for severe lethargy and lameness on the right hindlimb. a second 1.5-year-old mini pig presented with lethargy and inappetance. a moderate inflammatory leukogram and NSAIDs, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids were administered. the animal was successfully maintained on NSAIDs, antibiotics, and assisted feedings. our behavior team was able to confirm sexual maturity in group-housed females without disrupting social relationships. our behavior team was able to confirm sexual maturity in group-housed females without disrupting social relationships. single and group housed NHP using the radiolabelled test compound, Quetiapine. cortisol concentrations were determined in serum samples daily. u.s. urine and feces were collected pre- and postdose daily for up to 168 h. simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques are a valuable animal model for the study of HIV pathogenesis. socially housed SIV-infected macaques showed less immunosuppression. macaques were either singly housed or socially housed with a compatible conspecific during both the pre- and postinoculation periods. animal care staff recommended 37 ideas to be evaluated for the weekly intervention rotation. each item trialed was given \"as is\" (without treats) to a representative group of rhesus and cynomologus macaques. each item was tested daily until destroyed which took on average 5 days. the rabbits housed in large runs spent an average of 71.812.4% of the time analyzed performing active, exploratory behaviors. by comparison, rabbits housed in the typical rabbit cages spent only 30.79.2% of the time analyzed performing active, exploratory behaviors. the addition of enrichment devices or provision of larger caging encouraged active, species-typical rabbit behaviors. our future plans include measuring fecal cortisol levels and scoring animals for ease of handling when given access to various enrichment devices. anxious rabbits performed significantly more breath holding (mean=3.5) compared to bold ones (mean=0) (Z =-2.23, P = 0.02). all rabbits showed wide variability in HR (136-254) and RR (0-65) swine training program led to refinements in routine husbandry and research procedures. swine trained to walk back to animal holding rooms post anesthesia to ensure complete recovery. the animal is taught to \u201ctouch\u201d a target-stick for a food reward first. it is walked a short way following the target stick and asked to touch the target, then reward. the animal stays in the cart with a target-touch interaction coming at about every 3 s. a multimodal pain relief regime was developed using acetaminophen 30mg/kg PO SID x 5d, meloxicam 0.5 mg/kg PO SID x 5d, a fentanyl transdermal patch 50 mcg/hr/21-24kg x 3d. a specially tailored post-gastrointestinal feeding regime was instituted and refined over the course of the pilot study. the HEPI does not include research costs because not all higher education institutions have research programs. the lack of an index meaningful to higher education research enterprises has left animal programs without an analogous basis for modeling financial strategic planning. based approach to building 5- and 10-year animal program financial models. using an index-based cost to build financial models helps guard against developing unrealistic financial models. most LERU programs have mice and rats, but fewer programs have monkeys. less than 50% of institutions in LERU programs cover an animal program deficit. almost 100% of such deficits in U.S. programs are covered by the institution. virology and serology services are most frequently outsourced. the Matrix highlights waste as never before. management was able to pinpoint the precise location of inefficiencies. a variety of processes ended up saving the department hundreds of thousands. bettas are purchased from a variety of breeders which can bring unwanted pathogens with them. multiple treatment regimens were developed, requiring the stocking of an aquarists\u2019 pharmacy to include a broad spectrum treatment for the control of diseases caused by Ichthyophthirius (ich), Costia, Trichodina, Chilodonella, Chilodonella, and fungal infections. the ratio of new cases/clinical visits suggested that he rechecked ulcerative dermatitis cases more frequently than his peers despite having significantly longer days to resolution. the analytics provided by our rodent clinical health program were critical in identifying this outlier. Sprague-Dawley rats were acclimated for 2.5 wk in the vivarium. two cubicles were subjected to either 144.24 lux (highest setting) or 3.23 lux (lowest setting) the rat\u2019s circadian system was responsive to an hour at either red light intensities. increased c-Fos mRNA (neuronal activity marker) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. the rat\u2019s circadian system was responsive to an hour at either red light intensities. a new species-specific metric, or standard set of reporting parameters, is proposed. this metric enhances our ability to monitor and report lighting parameters that may lead to improved scientific outcomes. this metric is a cost-effective approach to anesthetic waste gas scanning. current recommendation for exposure limits is 2 parts per million/hour. this is based on a study conducted on other halogenated gasses in 1978. this promotes little to no exposure to anesthetic waste gas. laboratory animals experimentally infected with rabies virus pose a potential health risk to employees. the IACUC developed methods, protocols, and standard operating procedures to ensure research projects with rabies-infected dogs and mice follow contemporary animal welfare standards. light entrains the master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which controls all metabolic, physiologic, and neurobehavioral processes of the body. blue-enriched light (460-480 nm) from light-emitting diode (LED) lighting at daytime increases the amplitude of the nighttime circadian melatonin signal by 7-fold compared with broad-spectrum (300-700 nm) cool white adult mice maintained in bLAD vs. CWF lighting had lower (P 0.001) dietary (-15.4 0.3%) and water intake (-13.1 0.1%), and body growth rates (-10.1 0.4%) plasma nighttime melatonin levels were over 5-fold higher in bLAD- vs. CWF-exposed mice. eight breeder pairs of long Evans and CD rats were randomly assigned into 1 of 4 treatments groups: red cage-200 lux, red cage-25 lux, clear cage-200 lux, or clear cage-25 lux. rats were randomly exposed to each of the 4 environments for 3 consecutive d. continuous monitoring of animal behavior and physiology provides unique insight into the impact of cage changes and environmental enrichment. we performed retrospective data analysis on the effects of cage changes across multiple years, 2) in different mouse strains, 3) during varying times in the day. glucose homeostasis is a primary readout used to assess effects of pharmacological, environmental, or genetic manipulations in most metabolic studies. in mice, it is widely accepted that blood glucose (BG) values are obtained on a background of stress caused by handling, restraint, and sample collection. lycemia (3.9 mM) after 11 h followed by 7 hof hypothermia. lycemia (2.70.5 mM) was normal for 11 h, followed by 7 hof hypothermia. fasting beyond 7-8 h in mice is a severe metabolic stress. the cytokine levels were significantly elevated in the saline, SR-Bup, and SR-Bup mice compared to unstimulated splenocytes. the Bup stimulated splenocytes were only slightly elevated compared to unstimulated splenocytes. study examining chemotherapeutic tolerability of common DNA damaging oncology drugs including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin (Doxo) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) in female R2G2 mice. 5-FU was given at 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice weekly for 5 wk. CTX was given at 2 or 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once weekly for 3 PS17 Patient-derived and Cell Line Xenograft Growth in the B6;129-Rag2tm1FwaIL2rgtm1Rsky/DwlHsd (R2G2) mouse model. tumor cell line xeno-(CDX) and allo-grafts examined include colorectal and head and neck cancers. human esophageal adenocarcinoma FLO1 cells were examined in 2 studies. in both studies, cells were injected into both flanks of R2G2 and SCID mice. no tumor growth was seen in athymic nude or SCID mice. a safe and simple oral vaccination strategy with an immune adjuvant during infancy is sufficient to counteract heritable cancer risk associated with a carcinogenic microbiome. we tested whether a safe and simple oral vaccination strategy with an immune adjuvant during infancy is sufficient to counteract heritable cancer risk associated with a carcinogenic microbiome. we found that feeding 10ug of sterile Vibrio cholerae exotoxin subunit B for a total one in 10 newborns are born premature and receive an average of 14 +/- 4 painful procedures daily in the hospital. early-life, injury-induced alterations can lead to increased severity of subsequent painful events. the effect on chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain is unknown. on the ipsilateral limb (P 0.0001), reduced maximum contact area (P 0.0001), reduced intensity (P 0.0001) and longer swing phase (P 0.0001) during walking. RNP+OA animals showed less horizontal exploration (P 0.05) and spent less time in the center of the open field area (P 0.02) compared to controls. co-culture of AF and NP would be associated with significantly higher levels of inflammatory and degradative metabolite production compared to separate AF and NP mono-cultures. significant differences in IL-6, KC, MMP2, MMP3, NO, and PGE2 levels were noted between co-culture and NP mono-culture. diabetes in the Yucatan miniature swine manifests with progressive effects on heart rate, PR interval, and QRS duration. the diabetic minipig could provide a good model to test preventative approaches for progressive cardiac therapies in diabetes. multiple frogs in a colony of western clawed frogs were reported for a similar presentation. bloating, coelomic distention, and lethargy were reported for a similar presentation. frogs were used for oocyte collection and had been injected with human chorionic gonadotropin. rosal surfaces of organs within the coelomic cavity are indicative of either the over-production or release of vitellogenin from the increased catabolism of oocytes. this leads to hemorrhage followed by edema of tissues due to acute inflammation, which then triggers osmoregulatory shock, coelomic distension, subcutaneous edema, and eventually death. thoracic radiographs confirmed severe megaesophagus and atelectasis of the left caudal lung lobe. a gastroesophageal intussusception was discovered immediately cranial to the diaphragm. the model is used to study chronic granulomatous disease and to evaluate the role of phagocyte-derived oxidants in inflammation. 50% of the mice presented with liver lesions during scheduled terminal blood collection. serum chemistry analysis showed hypernatremia (Na+: 160 mmol/L), azotemia (BUN: 39 mg/dL), and increased albumin (4.9 g/dL), consistent with dehydration. antemortem diagnosis based on history, clinical signs, and elevated serum or cerebrospinal fluid sodium levels. the left leg was nonweight-bearing, and toes dragged and lacked pinch reflex and proprioceptive response. the differential diagnosis included fracture, dislocation, muscle or ligament injury, or nerve damage. radiographs of the leg did not reveal any fractures or dislocations. histology revealed a T-cell lymphoma in the left kidney. lymphomas comprise only 5% of tumors. history and acute onset of symptoms confused the differential diagnosis. the animal was euthanized and submitted for necropsy due to poor prognosis. a saline enema was administered followed by colonoscopy, which was ultimately unsuccessful and inconclusive. a complete blood count revealed lymphopenia, consistent with a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype. differential diagnoses for the inappetance, sneezing, fever, and weight loss included a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. immunosuppressed rabbits may be prone to severe pulmonary infections with P. oryctolagi, as well as respiratory bacterial infection. rabbits may serve as a useful model for human Pneumocystisinfection. the rat was transitioned to injectable meloxicam (1 mg/kg SC SID) and long-acting cefovecin (8 mg/kg SC) the rat was transitioned to injectable meloxicam (1 mg/kg SC SID) nano-CT was performed after euthanasia. animal had been previously diagnosed with endometriosis. for the past 5 y had been treated with monthly medroxyprogesterone injections. animal was sedated 3 d later for physical exam, bloodwork and ultrasound. there are 2 constants: discussion on harm/benefit of a study design and how the 3Rs can decrease the harm. each institution has a mechanism to record discussions at IACUC meetings and in many instances use forms, templates, or checklists. there are recognized benefits to using forms, templates, or checklists. the challenges included recruiting committee members from a region away from research-hubs, training a new IACUC quorum, assignment of responsibilities, coordination for a committee comprised of several members unaffiliated with the institution. it became incumbent upon the company to self-educate by scheduling weekly meetings and discussions. the compliance unit standard procedure (CUSP) project offers an option to address administrative burden at the institutional level. the goal of this project is to create an online repository where institutions can share standard procedures used in animal care protocols with the animal welfare compliance community. the microsurgery team offers a wide variety of techniques, ranging from handling, restraining, and injecting rodents up to specific techniques and an advanced microsurgery course. staff members are required to train in practical procedures at least twice a year. in existence for 5 y, the roundtable has produced a diverse portfolio of activities on a range of topics, including practical, scientific, educational, and regulatory. we provide concise information regarding each of the topics covered by the roundtable to date, including developments that have taken place since then. we discuss each of the topics covered by the roundtable to date, including developments that have taken place since then. the tools are secure, interactive, online resources that map scores longitudinally and provide tailored advice on how improvements can be made to encourage a more active 3Rs culture. we are supporting universities to deliver on their commitments to the 3Rs, benefiting science, scientists, and animals. a canine adoption program was developed to satisfy our desire to retire the research beagles. the program focused on the following areas: harness and leash, basic manners, new locations and experiences, novel floor textures, and novel sounds. the program was managed by 2 technicians that performed daily 20-m sessions for each dog. an animal welfare and compliance office developed a web-based platform to facilitate an interactive review system. the interactive system has been implemented across 3 campuses and has proven effective in allowing a timely and efficient IACUC review. the benefits include reducing email volume for the animal welfare and compliance office, the IACUC, and the principal investigators. the registry does not account for every line on campus, but is a powerful tool to assist the investigator looking for a line which may benefit their research. data from approved IACUC protocols and the ARP animal order database was extracted through queries into an Excel spreadsheet. information was then filtered to be searchedable by species, strain, line, or nomenclature. mice were weaned at 21 days old (Day 0) and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. animals were tested on rotarod, open field, novel object recognition, elevated plus maze, and Y maze beginning on d 40 through d 70. animals were video recorded over 12 h on d 133, 137, 151, 158, and 179. two IVC rack vendors, vendor A and vendor B, developed in-line EAP collection devices. baseline samples were taken from each exhaust-side horizontal plenum opening (vendor A) and from the horizontal air-exhaust plenum (vendor B) and screened via real-time PCR for infectious agents. both EAP capture media were evaluated for FELASA-listed infectious agents. both EAP capture media detected the infectious agents in naturally infected mice monitored over a 3-mo period. the EAP real-time PCR technology can serve as an adjunct method of HM, leads to the reduction of the number of mice used for routine HM. in the first round, devices were compared with members of the same category (wood or plastic) to determine the best device within the respective category. tongue depressors were significantly more preferable than the flexible polymer chew in mice. the top of racks and in individually ventilated cages with corncob bedding showed increased levels of aggression compared to those housed on the bottom of racks. other predictors of aggression included strain and time of year. this data suggests aggression in mice is multifactorial and is influenced by factors thought to be controlled for, such as the external environment. zebra finches were found to interact readily with both water and dust baths. only water baths were used for bathing; dust baths were used primarily for foraging. results support the notion that water baths are a valuable form of enrichment for zebra finches. product B averaged 6.4 pups per litter and had 27 litters total. product A averaged 7.3 pups per litter and had 33 litters total. product A reduced flooding incidences due to automatic watering valve failures. 113 successful pairs are defined as stable cohousing of 4 mo or longer. 5% were young animals (less than 5 y of age), 42% were a young animal paired with an adult. 53% of the pairs were adult macaques. all animals were treated for multiple internal and external parasites. the lab was then cleared to perform surgeries and behavioral testing within the ABSL-2 suite. successful introduction of wild-caught rodents into our vivaria resulted in reevaluation and refinement of our animal husbandry practices. weekly per-cage averages were reduced 60% compared to aspen chips (P 0.0001), 61% compared to vendor A (P 0.0001), and 45% compared to huts (P = 0.0180). vendor A\u2019s product was the only enrichment that significantly reduced pup mortalities. preterm infants have metabolic and developmental deficits within their first postnatal week of life leading to an increase in neonatal morbidity. our goal was to design an effective model using Yorkshire swine that would resemble preterm infants. three groups of preterm piglets with 8, 12, 13 piglets were delivered via Caserean section, resuscitated and allowed to recover in a controlled environment. both CPRC facilities, Sabana Seca Field Station and the free-ranging island of cayo Santiago, were severely affected. the CPRC took care of more than 4,000 rhesus macaques in the midst of the chaos. women are generally cardiometabolically protected from obesity-induced hypertension and type II diabetes compared to men despite a higher prevalence of obesity within the female population. women are generally cardiometabolically protected from obesity-induced hypertension and type II diabetes compared to men. male and female mice developed mild hyperglycemia (P = 0.021 diet, P = 0.265 gender, P = 0.463 interaction), insulin resistance (P = 0.001 diet, P = 0.444 gender, P = 0.463 interaction), and glucose intolerance (P = 0.001 diet, P = 0.156 gender, P = 0.685 interaction) female mice developed obesity-related insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (P = 0.001 diet, P = 0.156 gender, P = corynebacterium bovis is the causative agent of corynebacterium-associated hyperkeratosis in immunocompromised mice. the resulting skin pathology can be profound and may be associated with severe wasting. the administration of antibiotics is effective in resolving disease, but does not eradicate the bacterium. all isolates had at least 1 confirmed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, which may explain why no phages were found. toxin-antitoxin systems, shown to mediate defense mechanisms against phage infection, were detected in the majority of the isolates. murine astrovirus 1 (MuAstV1) is endemic in many research and production laboratory mouse colonies. we recently identified a novel astrovirus genetically distinct from MuAstV1 using metagenomics. this virus is most closely related to astroviruses isolated from 2 feral rat species in china. soiled bedding sentinel animals are most commonly used to monitor rodent colony health in research facilities. EAD testing via PCR has emerged as an adjunct method or replacement for rodent health colony monitoring. soiled bedding sentinel animals are most commonly used. pathogens tested were all agents excluded in the SPB rooms. the SB included the typical agents excluded in most rodent SPF facilities. the SPB rooms also excluded Helicobacter spp., Pasteurella pneumotropica, and mouse norovirus (MNV) infestations are clinically inapparent in most mouse strains. infestation with D. musculi modulates innate and adaptive immune responses. no significantdifferences between infested and naive animals in terms of T-cell activation or complete blood counts were observed in Swiss Webster mice. the effects of Buprenorphine and buprenorphine Sustained Release on the minimum alveolar concentration of Isoflurane in mice. BUP reduced MAC by 18% in females (1.720.08% control; 1.410.09% BUP) and 26% in males (1.820.03% control; 1.330.15% BUP). the heart rate of the mice receiving BUP was significantly lower (P 0.001; 35924 bpm BUP; 35924 bpm saline) pain was assessed by orbital tightness, posture, activity, and piloerection. a change from baseline can be detectable prior to onset of visual clinical signs. commercially available systems which include a large-scale ClO2 gas generator and specialized air-tight exposure chamber can be costly and impractical in some situations. the goal of this study was to create and validate an effective, small-scale, decontamination method using ClO2 gas. the upfront cost is approximately $75-$750. the method is 100 times less expensive than large-scale ClO2 gas generators. leopard geckos were fed the experimental diet for 4-6 h prior to being fed to the geckos. geckos in the control group were provided non-supplemented crickets over the course of 90 d. blood was collected at days 0, 45, and 90 to measure Ca, P, and VitD. male 15-wk-old B6129SF2/J mice were IP-injected with 1 mg/kg chlorprothixene (n=5), 5 mg/kg acepromazine (n=5), 10 mg/kg chlorpromazine (n=4), or saline (n=5). anesthesia maintenance was 0.5% and 1% isoflurane for mice administered sedatives and saline. five clinical cases are presented to illustrate potential usefulness/limitations of acupuncture in lab animal care. the first is a 10-y-old male rabbit (Oryctolagus sp.) that presented with hindlimb paresis. eight owl monkeys with OMWD received twice weekly vitamin B12 aquapuncture at 4 points: PC6, stomach 36 (ST36), gallbladder 34, and spleen 6. a 13-y-old male Aotus had intermittent melena/diarrhea refractory to Western medical treatment. an ultrasound exam was negative for neoplasia. twenty-four cynomolgus macaques (4 groups, 12 M/12F) were prepared for a 6-8 h anesthesia including presurgical analgesia, induction of anesthesia with ketamine/medetomidine, intubation, clipping, disinfection, and placement in a stereotactic frame. animals were transferred to the MRI to obtain data for calculation of position and angle and depth for catheter placement. meloxicam is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to manage pain in rodents. an extended release formulation, MSR, has been developed to provide 72 h of continuous analgesia. 3 d (95% confidence interval 2-3 d), showing a very consistent pattern, again highly significantly different from the control group (P 0.001). a more detailed examination of the trajectories of lesion severity showed rapid progression from onset around d 2-3, at stage 1 lesions characterized by palpable thickening with undefined borders, mild alopecia and/or mild erythema, to stage 2 lesions characterized by a measurable, defined mass with moderate alopecia sus macaques affected with chronic dermatitis, along with age and sex-matched, unaffected controls, were assessed using a novel Macaque Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (MADESI) this scoring system was adapted from one widely used in dogs. a spot-on PUFA treatment reduced chronic dermatitis and improved the quality of life in affected macaques. Sprague dawley rats received a preoperative subcutaneous line block of bupivacaine (8 mg/kg) and varying regimens of buprenorphine treatment: buprenorphine HCl (0.05 mg/kg) every 8h for 24h or 72h. control animals received volume- and site-matched injections of sterile saline. us associated with buprenorphine administration has been reported in primates. this is the first report of self-injurious behavior associated with standard buprenorphine dosing in rats. a long-acting, highly concentrated formulation of buprenorphine is available as a single dose, injectable solution. six healthy, adult rhesus macaques (3 male and 3 female) were included in a randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study. the low dose achieved a maximum plasma concentration of 19.1 5.68 ng/mL at 19.6 4.02 h with an AUC of 236.4 22.5 h/ng/mL. cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) 8-13-mo-old presented with acute, unilateral exophthalmos over a 6-mo period. the majority of affected cotton rats were retired breeders and were not exposed to experimental manipulations such as retroorbital blood collection. nesthetic management of a dog (Canis lupus familiaris) with X-linked muscular dystrophy and Cardiac Compromise IM Barber-Axthelm*1, TW Riebold2, RD Gleed3, JM Crudele4, JM Klaiman5, GA Fye1, J Snyder1, JS Chamberlain4, N Reyes1 1Department of Comparative Medicine; 2Department of Clinical Sciences; 3Department of Clinical Sciences the patient was induced with intravenous boluses of sufentanil (1.5g/kg), midazolam (0.2mg/kg) and etomidate (2mg/kg to effect) anesthesia was maintained with a sufentanil continuous rate infusion to reduce the alveolar concentration of isoflurane needed to maintain a stable anesthetic plane and facilitate rapid anesthetic recovery. euthanasia of animals, injectable pentobarbital and inhalant CO2 are acceptable and accepted with conditions methods of euthanasia for avian species. however, barbiturates are controlled substances and challenging to use in the field and laboratory setting. ethanol (n=4, 1052.60s +/- 200.01s) and pentobarbital (n=5, 772.2s +/- 54.67s) groups failed to reach asystole. no overt signs of pain or distress were observed. there were no significant histological changes and no degradative effect on RNA extraction. zebra finches received an IPC injection of 0.5mL of saline (n=21), 0.5mL of 100% ethanol (n=22) or 0.05mL sodium pentobarbital (n=21) finches were placed in an observation box and video recorded. time to loss of the righting reflex (LORR) and cessation of all movement (CAM) was recorded. a group of cull zebra finches were randomized and used to determine an effective dose 50% (ED50) of 100% ethanol. this information was then used to develop a linear regression model. the ED50 of 100% ethanol IPc was 0.023 mL/g (standard error = 0.004 mL/g) experimental frogs also spent less time displaying social conflict behaviors than control frogs in the intermediate period. stereotypic behavior was seen in a control frog 14% of the time across feeding days. fish were also observed interacting with 3 of the other items in species-specific behaviors. zebrafish housed next to neighboring fish showed a preference to be on the side of the tank nearest to the other fish. automated profiling of rodent activity in their home cages may reflect health, welfare, phenotype, and/or effects of toxicity. video-based systems offer distinct advantages in being able to recognize discreet behaviors. some video-monitoring functions have been designed into specialized mouse racks. the alert system accurately identified 83.3% of desired alerts, while only falsely identifying 6.6% of alerts. an animal alerting system improves animal welfare by enhancing the ability of vivarium staff and researchers to automatically identify animals that need more careful observation. technical procedures for proper restraint, injections (ID, IP, IV and SQ) and blood collection (maxillary vein) in mice and rats. trainers deemed proficient are capable of consistently and accurately performing the specific techniques with an 80 to 100% pass rate. each year the technicians are reassessed and deemed proficient. callipers only 9% of measurements are within 25% of the measured excised tumor mass compared with 60% using our 3D scanning method. results show much promise for reducing the handling and use of mice and decreasing the cost and duration of cancer drug development. group-housed mice are a serious welfare concern, but so too is housing mice singly. crowdsourcing data project is the first time such an approach has been applied to a laboratory animal welfare problem. rats housed in either standard laboratory rat cages (58cmL, 38cmW, 22cmH) or larger (tower) cages (73cmL, 58cmL, 58cmW, 46cmH) with shelters, perches, nesting material and locations, tunnels, and the aspen chew block. rats in standard cages groomed less (F1,50=55.80, P = 0.001) than rats in standard cages. rats housed in tower cages have improved welfare compared to rats in s2tandard even when both systems feature extensive cage enrichment. all animal studies were ethically reviewed and carried out in accordance with the GSK policy on the care, welfare and treatment of animals. gas bubble disease is an acute disease that occurs due to oversaturation of dissolved gases, such as nitrogen and argon into the water. the animals presented 5 d after issues in the recirculating water system were repaired suggesting that gas bubble disease can present even after restoration of the facility. bovis, xylosus, and corynebacterium spp. (HAC2) were isolated from all 4 submitted samples. all results were negative. the mouse was then submitted for full histopathologic evaluation. the animal had exhibited self-injurious behavior at 7 y of age following experimental amphetamine treatment between 2.5-4 years of age. awake physical exam at acute presentation revealed a mentally appropriate attitude, normal visual tracking and menace responses, intact limb withdrawal reflexes, and deep pain present. /EMG telemeterized, experimental nerve agent presented with an approximately 5 x 4 cm mass with focal necrosis on the left distal thorax under the subcuticular telemetry device. the firm, infiltrative mass had multifocal cysts containing serosanguinous fluid. a second surgery involved relocating the implant and fully excising the mass. a 15-y-old female baboon on an IACUC-approved protocol was examined for a firm swelling in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. the animal had no abnormalities noted on prestudy physical examination 7 mo prior, or during study-related procedures 2 mo prior to the mass being observed. radiographs demonstrated irregularity of the pelvic bones from the pubic symphysis to the obturator foramen. a 7-mo-old castrated male, 33 kg, Yucatan miniature pig received a myocardial infarction, jugular catheter, and daily amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic. two wk after cell injection, routine blood chemistry screening revealed elevated GGT (93 U/L) and AST (100 U/L), and hypercholesterolemia (378 mg/dL) five wk after cell injection the pig was examined for hypothermia. he was hypothermic (rectal temperature 99.7\u00b0F) and mildly tachycardic (130 bpm) the pig was presented as bright, alert and responsive, euhydrated. fish was euthanized in buffered MS-222 and submitted for necropsy. differentials included renal damage or failure, coelomic cavity mass/tumor, systemic infection(s) and branchial abnormality. the bacterial infection noted is most likely secondary to the primary neoplastic mass. microsporidium spores within the spinal cord were consistent with Pseudoloma neurophilia. the pig was on a xenotransplant study and had received daily oral immunosuppressives. the clinical signs and lesions noted in this case are consistent with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) the pathogenesis of PDNS is still ill-defined, yet there is evidence for an immune-mediated component. this case demonstrates the impact of immunosuppression in mini pigs. obacterspecies based on morphological characteristics using gram-staining, scanning electron microcopy (SEM) and biochemical assays failed to differentiate Campylobacter isolates at a species level. automated biochemical identification system (Vitek2C), fatty-acid profile-based identification system (MIDI) and 16S rDNA sequencing method failed to differentiate the 14 isolates. rats, a model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, startle easily and can be difficult to work with. their GM also differs from their wild-type littermates and may be involved in disease pathogenesis. mouse norovirus (MNV) and mouse parvovirus (MPV) are among the most common adventitious viral infections in laboratory mice. some have implicated nonirradiated feed as a source of MPV in rodent facilities but none have conclusively documented viral particles in the feed. irradiation and autoclaving effectively prevented seroconversion of mice exposed to high doses of contaminated rodent feed. irradiation and autoclaving effectively prevented seroconversion of mice exposed to high doses of MNV contaminated pellets while 1 mouse seroconverted at the highest dose for MPV. the aim of this study was to compare the antibody titer and seroconversion kinetics of heterozygous nude Crl:NU(Ncr)-Foxn1nu/+ (Het-nude) and CD1-E dirty bedding sentinels to murine norovirus. there was no significant difference between antibody titers to murine norovirus between Het-nude and CD1-E mice. corynebacterium bovis (C. bovis) causes hyperkeratotic dermatitis in immunocompromised mice. it is unknown whether immunocompetent mice become subclinically infected and shed infectious material. corynebacterium bovis is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that has been shown to cause eye and prosthetic joint infection and abscesses in humans. at present, little is known about the genetic characteristics and genomic diversity of C. bovis as only 1 draft genome has been sequenced. a neighbor-joining tree for the Corynebacterium genus revealed C. falsenii as the genetically closest species to C. bovis. the average number of putative genomic islands and virulence factors were significantly higher in rodent isolates compared to the human/bovine isolates. IL-10/ specific-pathogen free mice orally inoculated were not colonized with H. saguini; however, H. saguini mono-infection in germfree IL-10-/- mice developed IBD. immunohistochemistry for -H2AX was significantly higher in the cecum of infected mice than age-matched controls. the colon revealed moderately severe colitis with mild epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia in 5/10 infected mice (4 males, 1 female) microbial infections can play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD in IL-10-/- mice. the astrovirus was genetically divergent from muAstV1 commonly present in research mice. it was closely related to viruses isolated from feral norway and sikham rats in china. a PCR assay was used to implement a test and cull eradication plan in our research colony. antigens for several common infectious agents in lab mice and rats were part of the 33- and 28-member mouse and rat MFIA bead panels. whole virus or purified recombinant antigens were individually coupled to different color-coded bead sets. several system and sample suitability controls including tissue control beads to determine sample related nonspecific antibody binding. haust air dust testing is a sensitive tool in screening for rodent infectious agents on individually ventilated cage (IVC) racks. PCR testing is a sensitive tool in screening for rodent infectious agents on individually ventilated cage (IVC) racks. adenovirus, rotavirus, M. pulmonis, P. pneumotropica, S. moniliformis, Cryptosporidium, S. muris, and tritrichomonas were detected by EAD only. soiled bedding sentinels were 33% for traditional testing and 35% for PCR testing. a 3000-cubic foot lab was sealed and equipped with an AHP generation system and biosafety cabinet. the generator controlled the injection of 7% hydrogen peroxide and pulse phases. three decontamination times and 6 repeatable treatments were tested. midazolam is a fast-acting benzodiazepine commonly used in veterinary medicine that causes muscle relaxation, hypnosis, and has little cardiovascular effects. the intranasal administration of midazolam is often used to sedate human pediatric patients for noninvasive procedures, eliminating injection-associated stress in the recipients. X. laevis is a sexually dimorphic species, but phenotypic signs of sexual maturation can take 1 to 2 y to develop. the ability to sex juvenile frogs has the potential to improve colony management. oocytes were imaged before and after hormonally induced ovulation. results reflected the asynchrony of oogenesis in this species. juvenile animals (15-22g) not yet old enough to be sexed by phenotypic characteristics. nanogels containing N-isopropylacrylamide, Dextran-lactate-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and acrylic acid were synthesized by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. nanoparticles were characterized with respect to size, zeta potential, yield, and insulin loading efficiency and capacity. nanogels could load insulin with extremely high loading efficiency of >98%. strains encoding cyclomodulin genotoxins are associated with clinical and subclinical disease in the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts, meningitis, and inflammatory disorders. these genotoxins include the polyketide synthase (pks) pathogenicity island, cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) and hemolysin-associated cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf) cnf was also present in the remaining 24 isolates (55%). cdt or cnf was never present together or without pks. clb, cdt, and cnfencoding isolates induced megalocytosis. after 16 d of tumor growth, there were no differences in inflammatory markers in the hippocampus or serum apart from increased serum CXCL1 concentrations in tumor-bearing mice. however, after mastectomy surgery there were no exaggerated immune responses or behavioral changes to substantiate microglial priming in the tumor removal group. the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is responsible for normal vocal fold (VF) movement. the RLN is at risk for iatrogenic injury during anterior neck surgical procedures in human patients. no treatments can truly promote regeneration of the injured nerve. IPF affects more than 5 million people in the world and can be as high as 400 cases per 100,000 people over 65 years old. a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF in animal models will haveten the development of antifibrotic drugs. CD36 null mice showed less fibrosis on histology and by hydroxyproline assay of lung tissue. efferocytosis is an important efferocytosis receptor. efferocytosis is a multifactorial disorder that affects the lining of the gastrointestinal system. two experimental groups of heterozygous (HET) rats were chronically exposed to 1 of 2 different known environmental triggers of CD. either a low-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID; diclofenac, 1.25 mg/kg/PO) or ad libitum Western diet formulated rodent feed. each group contained 24 animals cohoused by sex and experimental group. lysins encoded by bacteriophages (lysins) and bacteria (bacteriocins) can degrade bacterial cell wall resulting in hypotonic lysis. treatment animals received 5 doses every other day of the bacteriocin lysostaphin (5 mg/mL) active against our MRSA isolate in vitro. the CFU count decreased below detectable levels (100 CFU/mL) in the nostrils and peri-rectal area in all animals. lysostaphin treatment coupled with decontamination and systemic antibiotics may be effective at decreasing MRSA colonization but failed to eradicate MRSA leading to increased bacterial colonization. fenbendazole has been formulated as a medicated rodent feed with demonstrated success treating pinworms. a FBZ oral suspension became available for delivery in water to use in swine and chickens. this new product must be mixed fresh daily or requires agitation. a positive outcome for this study would provide an alternative and possibly a more cost effective method for treatment of pinworms in rodents. the 4-8 mo-old, castrated male pigs, were on longterm immunosuppressive regimes (greater than 2 wk) as part of a xenotransplant study. cystis pneumonia, evidence of bacterial infections, and severe renal hemorrhagic medullary nephritis with variable fibrinohemorrhagic glomerulonephritis and arteriolar lesions. at least 1 animal had early histologic changes to the liver consistent with lymphoma. at least 2 had severe disseminated porcine cytomegalovirus infection. pneumoniae, porcine circovirus-2, swine influenza virus, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, porcine respiratory coronavirus, and Streptococcus suis. pigs presenting with decreased appetite and increased expiratory effort received an injection of long-acting tulathromycin 2.5 mg/kg as empiric therapy for primary or secondary bacterial respiratory path mice had tympanic bulla empyema, which was evident histologically as marked suppurative bacterial otitis media. all mice had tympanic bulla empyema, which was evident histologically as marked suppurative bacterial otitis media. burkholderia gladioli is of growing concern as a cause of severe respiratory tract infections in cystic fibrosis patients. the pathogen was found in oropharyngeal swabs of affected mice and believed to cause otitis via colonization of the Eustachian tube. a microbial surveillance program was implemented using daily RODAC plating of gloved hands and various surfaces touched by surgeons and assistants during the ET procedure. results of the monitoring showed growth of specific organisms on gloves and surfaces which often matched those identified later as contaminants in animals that underwent surgery. animals were euthanized and submitted for further diagnostics. differential diagnoses included infection, graft vs host disease, anemia secondary to xenographic bone marrow displacement, and graft failure. all 44 murine pathogens tested were negative. non-invasive methods to evaluate the gastrointestinal tract are limited to radiography with or without the use of intra-oral barium. a protocol for focused ultrasound assessment of the cranial abdomen of marmosets was developed. this technique was incorporated into biannual health screenings of the marmoset colony. normal ranges generated in this study will be clinically useful for further studies of gastrointestinal disease in this species. the technique of focused cranial abdominal ultrasonography may be adapted for use in other nonhuman primate species. feces from healthy NSG mice and subcutaneous fluids were administered to some mice with limited efficacy. the presence of both C. difficile toxins A and B were confirmed in 3/4 cases. sensitivity of 5 isolates revealed 3 different profiles. one pyometra was successfully managed medically, with Clavamox (62.5 mg BID) and Lutalyse (0.25 mg/kg daily for 5 d) this queen became pregnant and underwent a gravid ovariohysterectomy. two other pyometras were managed surgically, with uneventful recovery of the queens. 7 rabbits from 2 independent cohorts presented with inappetence and diarrhea. each cohort consisted of both male and female New Zealand White rabbits. the February cohort had 4 rabbits present with inappetence, and 2 with concurrent diarrhea. rabbits were fed a low-fiber diet prior to shipment, thus predisposing them to bacterial dysbiosis. new practices, such as increasing fiber content upon arrival, were set in place to prevent potential future cases of dysbiosis following shipment. animals were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation and tissues and blood were collected for clinical and histopathological examination. differentials for the clinical presentation included sepsis or vitamin D toxicity. urine was collected via ultrasound-guided cystocentesis. the average urine pH of the examined animals was 7.65. struvite crystalluria was observed in 36% (8 of 22) of samples. cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was sedated for an experimental surgical procedure. anesthesia was induced with propofol (0.4mg/kg IV) to facilitate intubation. the animal displayed prolonged capillary refill time (2-3 s) an echocardiogram confirmed right ventricular enlargement with no evidence of valvular regurgitation. the diagnosis was determined to be congestive cardiomyopathy. laying hens are a spontaneous ovarian cancer model with a high incidence of disease. a cohort of 10 4.5-y-old laying hens suspected for ovarian cancer was administered a 6-wk course of paclitaxel to assess chemotherapeutic efficacy. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET/CT) were used to identify cancerous laying hens and to assess changes in tumorigenesis throughout treatment. a coagulation panel showed elevated fibrinogen levels but all other parameters were within normal limits. a coagulation panel showed elevated fibrinogen levels but all other parameters were within normal limits. the animal was euthanized due to a poor prognosis. study of splay leg syndrome has been well documented in several animal species. findings show a strong genetic role of candidate genes for congenital splay leg in piglets, which translated into gross physical and radiographic abnormalities. splay leg syndrome is a common finding in human medicine. a 1-y-old female spayed pig presented with nonweight-bearing lameness of the left hindlimb. there was severe swelling proximal to the coronary band on the fourth digit of the left hindlimb. differential diagnoses include trauma versus infection. pain and swelling were managed with NSAIDs and opioids. a 1.5-year-old female spayed Yucat\u00e1n mini pig was reported for severe lethargy and lameness on the right hindlimb 4 wk following VAP implantation and 2 wk following stroke. on exam, the pig was laterally recumbent, febrile, and tachycardic. the animal was euthanized 24 h later. cat\u00e1n mini pig presented with lethargy and inappetance. bloodwork revealed a moderate inflammatory leukogram and NSAIDs, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids were administered. the animal was successfully maintained on NSAIDs, antibiotics, and assisted feedings. we designed a frame to match the openings of the transport chute to the housing unit, a cable hoist to open and close the chute door from inside the pen, a ratchet strap to secure the transport chute to the housing unit. modifying materials used for vaginal swabbing, and the introduction of rods to secure the dividers closed while working animals in the chute. anti-psychotic pharmaceutical selected for suitable excretion profile. cortisol concentrations were determined in serum samples daily. u.s. urine and feces were collected pre- and postdose daily for up to 168 h. macaques were either singly housed or socially housed with a compatible conspecific during both the pre- and postinoculation periods. pigtailed macaques showed a greater magnitude of decline in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells throughout acute infection compared to socially housed macaques. animal care staff recommended 37 ideas to be evaluated for the weekly intervention rotation. each item trialed was given \"as is\" (without treats) to a representative group of rhesus and cynomologus macaques. the item was checked daily until destroyed which took on average 5 days. we constructed an ethogram of laboratory rabbit behaviors. the rabbits housed in large runs spent an average of 71.812.4% of the time analyzed performing active, exploratory behaviors. the addition of enrichment devices or provision of larger caging encouraged active, species-typical rabbit behaviors. our future plans include measuring fecal cortisol levels and scoring animals for ease of handling when given access to various enrichment devices. all rabbits showed wide variability in HR (Z = -1.53, P = 0.17) or RR (Z = -1.26, P = 0.21) there was no correlation between temperament and ease of intubation, age ( = -0.03, P = 0.89), or duration in single housing. the swine training program led to refinements in routine husbandry and research procedures. Swine readily approached the front of their cages for injections and transportation to procedure rooms, reducing animal handling and stress. each week, caretakers participate in a performance on cue (POC) tournament with a miniature swine they have trained. pigs follow targeting cues to navigate through obstacles leading to a cart loaded with food reward. if the animal stays calm, you can add in distractions such as opening the door or making distracting noises. acetaminophen 30mg/kg PO SID x 5d, meloxicam 0.5 mg/kg PO SID x 5d, a fentanyl transdermal patch 50 mcg/hr/21-24kg x 3d and an incisional block of 2mg/kg bupivacaine. a specially tailored post-gastrointestinal feeding regime was instituted and refined. of the pigs will continue to be refined."}
