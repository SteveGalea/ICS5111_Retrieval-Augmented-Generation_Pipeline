{"summary": "positive-strand [(+)-strand] RNA virus genome first serves as a template for synthesis of viral proteins required for subsequent virus replication. the 3\u2032 end of the synthesized ()-strand RNA genome is then employed as the site for the initiation of the (+)-strand RNA genome. cis-acting RNA elements in the coronavirus genome required for replication have been identified in the past two decades with a full-length infectious cDNA or coronavirus defective two higher-order structures on the upstream end of the 3\u2032 UTR have been identified as cis-acting RNA elements that are essential for coronavirus replication. downstream of the 3\u2032 UTR is a hypervariable region (HVR) which forms a complex secondary structure. this secondary structure is nonessential for RNA synthesis but plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis [21] a head-to-tail ligation method and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been developed to detect ()-strand DI RNA synthesis. this method may be employed to determine the requirements of cis-acting elements for the synthesis of BCoV ()-strand DI RNA. the aligned 3\u2032-terminal 55-nt sequence was highly conserved across the coronaviruses within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses. the sequence identity within the subgroup 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d coronaviruses was 71%, 100%, 88% and 82%, respectively. position numbers 1 and 55 below the sequence indicate the first and 55th nt counted from the poly(A tail, respectively. the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts on BCoV DI RNA are required for ()-strand RNA synthesis as analyzed by head-to-tail RNA ligation and qRT-PCR. the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts on BCoV DI RNA are required for ()-strand RNA synthesis. RT-PCR may be used to detect the ()-strand DI RNA molecules. but a false positive result may occur due to the synthesis of the copy-back ()-strand DI RNA transcripts generated by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro using plasmid DNA as a template. to overcome detection problems, we created a hybrid BCoV DI RNA construct marked with the MHV 3\u2032 UTR and 25 nts of poly(A) tail. most 55 nts for ()-strand DI RNA synthesis in context of BCoV RNA. BM25A construct in which the 3\u2032-most 55 nts were intact. 55 mutant in which the 3\u2032-most 55 nts were deleted were created. RNA was extracted at different time points as indicated in Fig. 3B. RNA samples extracted from BM25A- and 55-transfected BCoV-infected cells at 8 hour posttransfection were tested for a 1,639-nt helper virus genome-integrated reporter-containing sequence. no RT-PCR product was observed, suggesting that the detected 150 bp RT-PCR products do not result from a recombinant helper virus genome. RNA extracted at 8 hpt of DI RNA transcript was treated with TAP and head-to-tail ligated. MHV-A59 3\u2032 UTR-negative-strand-specific primer 2 MHV3UTR6(\u2013) and BCoV 5\u2032 UTR-positive-strand specific primer 3 BCoV23-40(+) were used for RT. cDNA-cloned RT-PCR product with a size of 150 bp from lane 5. primers MHV3\u2032 UTR2(+), which anneals to the MHV 3\u2032 UTR and was used for RT, and M3(\u2013) were used for PCR to detect potential recombination between helper virus BCoV genome and BM25A (lane 2) or 55 (lane 3). cis-acting RNA elements within the 3\u2032-terminal 55 nts are required for the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA. a series of DI RNA constructs with deletions from the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 end of the 55-nt region were generated by mutagenesis. the total cellular RNA was collected at 8 hpt of RNA transcript to detect the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA. strand DI RNA is specifically synthesized by the BCoV polymerase. the supernatant virus was used to infect fresh HRT-18 cells. the total cellular RNA collected at 48 hpi of VP1 was used to detect the synthesis of (+)-strand DI RNA. deletion of 5-, 15-, 30-, and 55- nts from the 3\u2032 terminus of the 55-nt region led to a significant decrease in the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand and (+)-strand DI RNA. total cellular RNA was extracted from DI RNA-transfected cells at 8 hpt. mRNA and 18S rRNA as internal controls. lower panel: sequence of the BCoV DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1. both (\u2013)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis were significantly inhibited from DI RNA with a deletion from nts \u201355 to \u201330 (construct 55-30) the efficiency of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA synthesis was also significantly blocked in the construct 30-15 with a deletion from nts \u201330 to \u201315. deletion mutants 5\u201314, 15\u201324, 25\u201334, and 35\u201339 were constructed. efficiency of the ()-strand DI RNA synthesis from these deletion constructs was inhibited. all of the mutated sequences in these synthesized ()-strand DI RNA were still maintained at 8 hpt. but all the mutants reversed back to wt DI RNA at 48 hpi. mutated sequences were still maintained in the mutants 2, 55\u201340 and 35\u201339. the majority of the sequences were from the mutants rather than from the wt DI RNA (BM25A) these results suggest that these DI RNA mutants still maintain the ability to replicate. total cellular RNA extracted at 10 hpi and 200 ng of BM25A transcript. upper panel: synthesis of (+)-strand DI RNA as detected by Northern blot assay. BM-3\u2032A was still able to synthesize its (+)-strand counterpart (60% of wt BM25A) the efficiency of the ()-strand DI RNA synthesis from construct BM-3\u2032U was significantly inhibited. the mutant BM-3\u2032U still maintained the mutated sequence. BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells were transfected with the indicated DI RNA construct at 2 hpi. synthesis of the ()-strand DI RNA from the substitution mutant was quantitated by qRT-PCR. cis-acting elements in the 3\u2032 UTR of BCoV and MHV-A59 have been characterized. the aligned 3\u2032-terminal 55-nt sequence was highly conserved. the conserved sequence within the individual subgroups of betacoronaviruses is identified by shading. ECoV, equine coronavirus-NC99; MHVA59, mouse hepatitis virus-A59; MHVJ, mouse hepatitis virus-JHM; PV, puffinosis virus; SARS-CoV, SARS coronavirus; B-S-HKU3, bat SARS coronavirus HKU3; B-S-HKU5, bat SARS coronavirus HKU5; B-S-HKU5, coronavirus DI RNA has been employed as a surrogate for coronavirus genome to study the cis-acting elements required for coronavirus replication. the identification of cis-acting RNA elements that are essential for the ()-strand DI RNA synthesis in coronaviruses has been restricted by the low number of ()-strand DI RNA produced from the DI RNA-transfected helper virus-infected cells. the sequence in the 3\u2032-termianl 55 nts of the 3\u2032UTR between BCoV and MHV is highly conserved. it has been shown that the replication efficiency of BCoV DI RNA with the MHV 3\u2032 UTR is almost the same with that of BCoV DI RNA with BCoV 3\u2032UTR. 150-bp RT-PCR product obtained from BM25A- and 55-transfected BCoV-infected cells was specific from head-to-tail-ligated (\u2013)-strand DI RNA. the detected (\u2013)-strand DI RNA in Fig. 3B may be derived from the recombinant genome rather than input (+)-strand DI RNA. RNA extracted at 8 hpt of DI RNA transcript was treated with TAP. MHV-A59 3\u2032 UTR-negative-strand-specific primer 2 MHV3UTR6(\u2013) and BCoV 5\u2032 UTR-positive-strand specific primer 3 BCoV23-40(+) were used for PCR. transfected cells (lanes 2\u20138, arrowhead) but not from BCoV-infected 55-transfected cells. Lanes 18\u201321 represent the controls for RT-PCR. C1: total cellular RNA from DI RNA-transfected cells. the amounts of DI RNA, helper virus N sgmRNA, and 18S rRNA from DI RNA-transfected cells at 8 hpt of VP0 as measured by Northern blot assay. the values (E) represent the mean SD of three individual experiments. the transfected transcript was still in the BCoV-infected cells at 8 hpt. it is difficult to distinguish between the coronaviral polymerase-generated (+)-strand DI RNA and the T7 RNA polymerase-generated (+)-strand DI RNA by qRT-PCR. the supernatant virus collected at 48 hpt was used to infect fresh HRT-18 cells. BCoV DI RNA with a 1- and 2-nt deletion at the 3\u2032 terminus still supported the (+)-strand synthesis. further deletion of 5-, 15-, 30-, and 55- nts led to a significant decrease in the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand. control C: total cellular RNA from DI RNA-transfected mock-infected cells. total cellular RNA was extracted at 10 hpi and 200 ng of BM25A transcript. upper panel: the relative levels of the (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. efficiency of both (\u2013)-and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis was also significantly blocked in the construct 30-15 with a deletion from nts \u201355 to \u201330. mutated sequences in the synthesized (\u2013)-strand DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1 showed that all contained the sequence with majority from wt DI RNA except for the mutant 2. nts from \u20131 to \u20134 and from \u201340 to \u201355 are not essential for the (\u2013)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. cis-acting elements essential for (\u2013)- or (+)-strand synthesis may reside in the region between the nts \u20132 and \u201340. deletion mutants 5\u201314, 15\u201324, 25\u201334, and 35\u201339 were constructed. the mutated sequences were still maintained in the mutants 1, 55\u201345 and 55\u201335. the majority of the sequences were from the mutants rather than from the wt DI RNA (BM25A) these results suggest that these DI RNA mutants still maintain the ability to replicate. the synthesis of ()-strand DI RNA from the deletion mutant was quantitated by qRT-PCR. the synthesis of ()-strand DI RNA from the deletion mutant was compared with that from wt BM25. the cytosine residing at the last nucleotide of the 3\u2032 UTR in BCoV DI RNA was substituted with adenine, uracil and guanine to make the constructs BM-3\u2032A, BM-3\u2032U, and BM-3\u2032G, respectively. the results together suggest that (1) the substitution of the 3\u2032-most nucleotide cytosine with other nucleotide. species is sensitive for ()-strand DI RNA synthesis and (2) the substitution of the 3\u2032-most cytosine residue by uracil, but not adenine or guanine, is more tolerant for (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. the nucleotide species at the 3\u2032-most position (1) is important, but not critical, for both ()- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. the sequence of the BCoV DI RNA at 48 hpi of VP1 is determined by RT-PCR and sequencing analysis. the values (B) and (C) represent the mean SD of three individual experiments. cis-acting elements in coronaviruses may function in ()- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. the deletions blocked the synthesis of (+)-strand DI RNA from their (+)-strand DI RNA templates. however, it is not feasible to speculate from these mutants at this time. efficiency of ()- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis from mutants 55\u201345 and 55\u201340 was not significantly inhibited. nts from 55 to 40 are not absolutely required for both ()- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. nts from 55 to 40 are not absolutely required for both ()- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis. nts 40 to 44 may act as a repressor and synergistic effect of enhancer and repressor. nts 35 to 39 may play a role of enhancer as evidenced by comparison of replication efficiency between 55\u201340 and 55\u201335 (102% vs 78%) coronavirus nonstructural protein 8 has been proposed to preferentially initiate the synthesis of primer at the cytosine within the internal 5\u2032-(G/U)CC-3\u2032 trinucleotides. since the substitution of the cytosine with adenine, guanine or uracil inhibited the ()-strand DI RNA synthesis. alterations of the sequence at the 3\u2032-terminal region of (+)-strand RNA also impair the synthesis of (+)-strand RNA. the reasons why the sequence alterations at the 3\u2032-terminal region on (+)-strand RNA, for example, mutants 3, 4, BM-3\u2032A, and BM-3\u2032G, affected the synthesis of (+)-strand RNA remains unknown. the method allows us to simultaneously detect ()- and (+)-strand RNA synthesis. cis-acting elements located in the 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR and coding region have been demonstrated to be required for replication. the method may contribute to elucidate the specific roles of these cis-acting elements. the resultant PCR product was cloned into the TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen) the digested fragment was cloned into SpeI- and MluI-linearized pDI RNA-1 to create pBM25A containing MHV-A59 3\u2032 UTR and 25-nt poly(A) tail. the plasmid DNA construct was transcribed with the RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was chromatographed through a bio-Rad. after 2 hours of infection, 3 g of BM25A or mutant transcript quantitated by RNA denaturing gel was transfected into BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells. the mixture was heated to 94\u00b0C for 2 min and subjected to 50 cycles. 1 g of ligated RNA was used for RT reaction with oligonucleotide MHV3\u2032UTR3(\u2013), which binds nts 89\u2013112 from the poly(U) tail in the strand of the MHV-A59 3\u2032 UTR. s MHV3\u2032UTR6(\u2013) and BCV23-40(+) was performed using TagMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) to quantitate the synthesis of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA, dilutions of plasmids containing the same sequence as the detected RT-PCR product of (\u2013) \u2013strand DI RNA were always run in parallel with quantitated cDNA. IG Oligonucleotide 3\u2032-End Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) RNA detected was visualized according to manufacturer's recommended procedure. one microgram of ligated RNA was used for an RT reaction with oligonucleotide MHV 3\u2032 UTR3(\u2013) or BCV107(+) the resultant PCR product was cloned into the TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen) and digested with SpeI and MluI. a 756-nt fragment obtained by digestion with SpeI and MluI was cloned into SpeI- and MluI-linearized pDI RNA-1 to create the mutant p55. p35\u201339, pBM-3\u2032A, pBM-3\u2032G, and pBM-3\u2032U were similarly constructed, except for the corresponding oligonucleotides used in the first and second reactions. the plasmid DNA construct was transcribed with the RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was chromatographed through a Bio-Rad before use. l of 10X ligase buffer and 2 U (in 2 l) of T4 RNA ligase I (New England Biolabs) were added. 1 g of ligated RNA was used for RT reaction with oligonucleotide MHV3\u2032UTR3(\u2013) which binds nts 89\u2013112 from the poly(U) tail in the (\u2013) strand of the MHV-A59 3\u2032 U real-time PCR amplification was performed using the primers MHV3\u2032UTR6(\u2013) and BCV23-40(+) dilutions of plasmids containing the same sequence as the detected RT-PCR product of (\u2013)-strand DI RNA were always run in parallel with quantitated cDNA for use as standard curves. RNA(+) was tailed with digoxigenin (DIG)-ddUTP using a DIG Oligonucleotide 3\u2032-End Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) the RNA detected was visualized according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. the total intracellular RNA collected at 48 hpi of VP1 was used to detect the synthesis of (+)-strand DI RNA with Northern blot assay. total cellular RNA was extracted at 24 hpi of VP1 and was analyzed by northern blot assay with N sgmRNA and 18S rRNA used as internal controls."}
