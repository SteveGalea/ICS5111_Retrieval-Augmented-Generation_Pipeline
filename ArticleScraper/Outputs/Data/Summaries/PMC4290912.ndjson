{"summary": "the most affected population is children under 5 years of age, where it accounts for the second cause of postneonatal death. diarrheal disease is among the most common causes of illness worldwide. wild animals, such as deer, monkeys, bats, foxes, wolves, and boars, are also affected. DNA microarrays are based on solid-phase hybridization, in which specific probes are deposited on a surface and react with a mixture of labeled nucleic acids. different microarrays have been developed for virus discovery (21); however, a diagnostic microarray specific for viruses found in the GI tract is lacking. triple-layered particles of RV-A strain RRV were purified with a cesium chloride density gradient as described previously (27). reference virus species were provided by Ramon Gonzalez, FC-UAEM (human adenovirus, norwalk virus, and Sapporo virus), Rosa E. Sarmiento, FMVZ-UNAM (bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and bovine parainfluenza virus 3), Rosa Mara Del Angel, CINVESTAV-IPN (dengue all available full-length genomes or complete gene sequences of the selected virus species were identified by an extensive review of published literature. for each virus species, sequence redundancy was eliminated according to sequence similarity with cutoff values of 95 to 99% using CD-HIT software. the best probe-target G was plotted in a heat map using R. Detection of a target is when the G is 50 kcal/mol. supernatants were filtered in spin-X 22-m-pore filters (Costar, NY) at 5,000 g for 10 to 20 min. samples were treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion, USA) and RNase (Sigma, USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and immediately chilled on ice. nucleic acids from virus lysates or clinical samples were eluted in nuclease-free water, aliquoted, quantified in nanoDrop fluorophore-labeled DNA was purified with the DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit. microarray slides were treated just before their use with an ethanolamine wash solution (50 mM ethanolamine, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 M Tris, pH 9) for 15 min at 50\u00b0C, followed by two washes in distilled water. normalization of intensity values was done with the formula (F532i/F532m) (B532i-B5532m), where F532i and B532i are the foreground and background signals of spot \u201ci\u201d respectively. Rank values from negative-control samples were recorded and used to generate a \u201cspot rank value\u201d included in subsequent spot quality analysis. HAdV-C, corresponding to 1 107 to 100 virus particles, were extracted, amplified, labeled, and processed using the full microarray protocol. nucleic acids extracted from clinical samples were used to perform diagnostic reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using Qiagen's one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, USA) or SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) for confirm human parechovirus (HPeV) amplification was as follows: 30 min at 50\u00b0C; 15 min at 95\u00b0C; 35 cycles of 1 min at 95\u00b0C, 1 min at 48\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C. conditions for the first round were as follows: 2 min at 94\u00b0C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. the HAstV and RV-A amplification program consisted of 10 min at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. the NV amplification program consisted of 10 min at 95\u00b0C and 45 cycles of 10 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 48\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C. clinical samples from children presenting gastroenteritis during the winter season from 2004 to 2005 were obtained in Monterrey, Mexico. no previous screening for bacterial or parasitic agents was performed on the group of samples. oligonucleotide probes recognized virus/total number of oligonucleotide probes designed to bind viral species. for each virus species, sequence redundancy was eliminated according to sequence similarity with cutoff values of 95 to 99% using CD-HIT software. a minimum of 6 nonoverlapping probes from conserved regions in virus genomes were selected for each virus. each available genome sequence in the target database for given species was recognized by at least two probes. lysates (cell culture supernatants from reference strains) were extracted with the PureLink viral RNA/DNA kit. for clinical samples and norwalk and Sapporo virus positive controls, 100 g of stool was added to conical screw-cap tubes containing 100 mg of 150- to 212-m glass beads. samples were homogenized in a bead beater (Biospec Products, USA) after 10 min centrifugation at 2,000 g, supernatants were primer B (5\u2032-GTTTCCCAGTAGGTCTC-3\u2032) was incorporated during 20 cycles of PCR. the amplified products were purified with the DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit. fluorophore-labeled DNA was purified with the Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit. 0.2 SSC and dried for 5 min at 500 rpm. axon GenePix 4000B scanner synchronized with genePix Pro 6.0 software. spot intensities were first filtered by spot quality control parameters. RNA was extracted from purified RV-A strain RRV and MA104 cells. dilutions of RV-A RNA corresponding to 1 108 to 10 particles were analyzed. decreased dilutions of focus-forming unit-titrated cell lysates were extracted. RT-PCR conditions for human enterovirus (HEV) were as follows: 30 min at 50\u00b0C; 15 min at 95\u00b0C; 40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 50\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; and a final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0C. conditions for the first round were as follows: 2 min at 94\u00b0C; 15 min at 95\u00b0C; 35 cycles of 1 min at 95\u00b0C, 1 min at 48\u00b0C 3 l of RNA (5 ng) was reverse transcribed with 0.125 l (50 U/l) superScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA), 0.25 l of RNase inhibitor (20 U/l), 12.5 l of 2 SYBR green master mix. samples were incubated for 30 min at 48\u00b0C, followed by enzyme inactivation for 10 min at 90\u00b0C. conditions were 95\u00b0C for 8 min, 45 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 55\u00b0C, and 20 s at 72\u00b0C, and a final extension of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR primer sets for detection of CV, HAdV, and HEV were designed to recognize the target at the genus level (5, 6, 41) a set of 1,256 70-mer microarray probes were selected from conserved regions. at least 6 probes designed for each viral species and at least 2 probes corresponding to each sequenced viral genome. the highest number of probes covered RV-A (42 probes), Alphacoronavirus (28 probes), and mammalian Orthoreovirus (25 probes) all reference strains tested were detected as expected, including four different RV-A strains. the only genotype that the microarray probably would not detect was G22P[35], belonging to a turkey rotavirus strain. 76 samples from children under 5 years of age were analyzed. a viral agent was detected in 70 out of 76 (92%) samples tested. a single virus was found in 63 (83%) samples, while two or more viral species were detected in 7 (9%) samples. all samples tested with the microarray were tested for selected viruses, including RV-A. a group of 76 samples from children presenting gastroenteritis was analyzed by the described microarray (A) or by diagnostic RT-PCR for the 5 most common gastrointestinal pathogens (B) the RT-PCR panel confirmed the microarray results in all HAdV-positive samples (1 HAdV-A and 3 HAdV-F), having a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%. PPVs were lower for HAstV, with 3 of 5 positive samples identified by microarray (PPV 60%), and HEV, with 5 of 7 positive samples identified by microarray (PPV 71%) the MI combinations observed in RT-PCR were RV-A/HAdV (8 samples), RV-A/HEV (5), HAstV/HEV (1), RV-A/CV (1), and HAdV/CV/HEV (1). in one sample, NV was identified as the sole species by microarray, while RT-PCR results showed CV/HAdV/HEV triple coinfection. single-infection samples were used as positive controls. lower CT values are shown in bold. b NV is detected at the genus level as calicivirus. RV-A was the only virus identified by microarray despite lower CT values. this indicates that MI presenting large differences in the amounts of the genetic material of the viral agents involved are prone to result in single-virus detection by the microarray. the most prevalent or most frequently found viruses in single infections, such as RV-A, HAstV, and CV, showed good sensitivity and specificity. the main goal of this study was to develop an assay for detection of all viruses that have been found in stool samples from vertebrates, associated or not with gastroenteritis. a deep search of the scientific literature resulted in a list of 128 species of viruses reported to be present in the gastrointestinal tract. the list includes the well-known human gastroenteritis viruses (calicivirus group, rotaviruses, human astroviruses, and enteric adenovirus a set of 1,256 70-mer microarray probes were selected from conserved regions and designed to identify 128 viral species associated with the GI tract. at least 6 probes designed for each viral species and at least 2 probes corresponding to each sequenced viral genome. the highest number of probes covered RV-A (42 probes), Alphacoronavirus (28 probes), and mammalian Orthoreovirus (25 probes) 42 probes specific for rotavirus were analyzed with a panel of all available G and P genotypes. the only genotype that the microarray probably would not detect was G22P[35], belonging to a turkey rotavirus strain. 76 samples from children under 5 years of age collected during the winter season from 2004 to 2005 in Monterrey, Mexico, were analyzed. the collection of samples was originally screened for RV-A by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stored at 70\u00b0C. a viral agent was detected in 70 out of 76 samples tested; a single virus was found in 63 (83%) samples. a group of 76 samples from children presenting gastroenteritis was analyzed by the described microarray (A) or by diagnostic RT-PCR for the 5 most common gastrointestinal pathogens (B) samples with coinfections are shown. Negative, no virus identified. a panel of 5 virus groups was tested by RT-PCR in all 76 samples. results were compared to those obtained by microarray analysis. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were shown. HAstV was the only virus identified in samples with HAstV/HEV coinfection (Table 2). NV was identified as the sole species by microarray. RT-PCR results showed CV/HAdV/HEV triple coinfection. single-infection samples were used as positive controls. lower CT values are shown in bold. b NV is detected at the genus level as calicivirus. 4 samples that presented only HAdV were found positive by both microarray and RT-PCR. in the remaining 9 samples, only the second virus was identified by microarray. it should be pointed out that most of these samples contained a low level of HAdV genetic material, with CT values close to the nontemplate control value. a comprehensive and sensitive DNA microarray was developed and tested. it allows in principle the parallel detection of more than 100 gastrointestinal tract-associated virus species. a microarray allows in principle the parallel detection of more than 100 gastrointestinal tract-associated virus species. some probes were found to react nonspecifically with the amplified labeled DNA. some probes were found to react nonspecifically with the amplified labeled DNA. sensitivity of the assay could be lower than that of specific PCR. the microarray presented in this work identified 34 RV-A-positive samples. 42 samples were found to be RV-A positive. the microarray had a higher number of positive results when clinical samples were tested. between 4 and 18% are observed, with the most common combination being RV-A/NV (2, 13, 77, 81, 82, 83) mixed infections are more common than previously thought (4, 80), even in healthy individuals (79). the number of virus species identified has increased considerably in the last decade with the application of emerging genomic technologies such as microarrays. unbiased next-generation sequencing in studies of fatal or rare cases of disease in humans and in wild and domestic animals should be considered."}
