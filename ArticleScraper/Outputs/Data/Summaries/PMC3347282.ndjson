{"summary": "coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide variety of animals. they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of various severities. coronaviruses were traditionally classified into three distinct groups (5, 25) an alphacoronavirus was reported independently by two groups in the Netherlands in 2004 (12, 60), whereas human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV HKU1) was identified in patients from Hong Kong in 2005 (28, 68, 72). despite the identification of horseshoe bats in china as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses, it is still unknown if these animals are the direct origin of SARS-CoV in civet and human. complete genome analyses of four RbCoV HKU14 strains were carried out to study the genome features and molecular evolution in relation to those of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A CoVs. all specimens were collected from live food animal markets in Guangzhou, China, from March 2006 to June 2009. the PCR mixture (25 l) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% gelatin) the mixtures were amplified with 60 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. cell lines were prepared in culture tubes and inoculated with 200 l of fecal samples diluted 1:10. nonattached viruses were removed by washing the cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline. antigen detection was performed by immunofluorescence. real-time RT-PCR was performed on supernatants of infected cell lines. cDNA was amplified in a lightcycler instrument with random primers. a reference standard was prepared by using the pCRII-TOPO vector. cDNA was amplified by degenerate primers designed by multiple alignments of other CoVs with available complete genomes. additional primers were designed from the results of the first round and subsequent rounds of sequencing. sequences were assembled and edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. the divergence time was calculated using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach implemented in BEAST. one parametric model tree prior (constant size) and one nonparametric model tree prior (Bayesian skyline) were used for inference. RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel with 7% formaldehyde at 100 V in 1 MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) buffer (20 mM MOPS, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA) the blot was prehybridized with ULTRAhyb-Oligo hybridization buffer (Ambion) and washed with low- and high-stringency buffers. cDNA was PCR amplified with a forward primer located in the leader sequence and a reverse primer located in the body of each mRNA. the mixtures were amplified for 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the sequences coding for a total of 444 (RbCoV HKU14) and 453 (HCoV OC43) amino acid residues of the nucleocapsid proteins were amplified and cloned into the NdeI site of the pET-28b(+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and the BamHI site and KpnI site of the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen, Hilden blot was cut into strips, and strips incubated separately with 1:4,000 dilutions of sera collected from 30 rabbits with serum samples available. sera from a patient with HCoV OC43 infection, 32 healthy blood donors, and 33 SARS patients were included. neutralization assays for RbCoV HKU14 were carried out according to previously described protocols. RNA was eluted in 60 l of AVE buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was used as the template for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) the RNA was eluted in 60 l of AVE buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) lified with 60 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination. no false-positive result was observed for negative controls. antigen detection of infected HRT-18G cell lines was performed by immunofluorescence. cell smears at day 7 that were prepared and fixed in chilled acetone at 20\u00b0C for 10 min were tested with rabbit serum against RbCoV HKU14. a reference standard was prepared by using the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) containing the target sequence. Tenfold dilutions equivalent to 2 to 2 107 copies per reaction were prepared to generate concomitant calibration curves. the detection limit of this assay was 2 copies per reaction. phylogenetic trees were performed using neighbor-joining method. bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 trees. prediction of transmembrane domains was performed by the use of PFAM and InterProScan (3, 4). a Bayesian skyline under a relaxed-clock model with an uncorrelated exponential distribution was adopted for making inferences. the tree was summarized in a target tree by the Tree Annotator program included in the BEAST package by choosing the tree with the maximum sum of posterior probabilities (maximum clade credibility) the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, Ka, for each coding oligodeoxynucleotide probe was labeled with digoxigenin at the 3\u2032 end. the blot was hybridized at 37\u00b0C overnight and washed with low- and high-stringency buffers. cDNA was PCR amplified with a forward primer located in the leader sequence. RT-PCR products were gel purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced to obtain the leader-body junction sequences for each subgenomic mRNA. the sequences coding for a total of 444 (RbCoV HKU14) and 453 (HCoV OC43) amino acid residues of the nucleocapsid proteins were amplified and cloned into the his6-tagged nucleocapsid proteins were expressed and purified by using the hiTrap chelating system. 600 ng of purified His6-tagged recombinant N protein of RbCoV HKU14 or HCoV OC43 was loaded into each well of a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. the strips were incubated separately with 1:4,000 dilutions of sera collected from 30 rabbits with serum samples available. from 30 rabbits and human sera from a patient with HCoV OC43 infection, 10 healthy blood donors, and 10 SARS patients were included. the mixture was inoculated in duplicate onto 96-well plates of HRT-18G cell cultures. results were recorded after 6 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C. RT-PCR detected in the supernatants of HRT-18G and RK13 cells at day 7. a viral load of 8 106 copies/ml was also observed for infected HRT-18G cells 5 days after inoculation. only a minimal CPE with cell rounding was observed for infected cells. cleotide positions (start\u2013end) No. of nucleotides No. of amino acids Frame(s) Predicted domain(s) Positions (aa) ORF1ab 209\u201321663 21,455 7,151 +1, +2 \u2014a NS2a1 21673\u201321804 132 43 +1 NS2a2 21829\u201322020 192 63 +1 NS2a3 22126\u201322254 129 42 +1 hemagglutinin-esterase, spike, NS5a, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins are indicated with the corresponding nucleotide positions. the positions and arrangement of the small NS2a ORFs in the four strains of RbCoV HKU14 are shown in the expanded view. the putative TRS is underlined, and base mismatches between the body TRS and the leader TRS or the genomic region are indicated by asterisks. the leader TRS and subgenomic mRNAs of HE, S, and N exactly matched each other, whereas there was a one-base mismatch for NS2a, NS5a, E, and M. nsp13, and nsp15 in RbCoV HKU14 differed from those of corresponding nsp's in HCoV OC43, BCoV, ECoV, and/or PHEV. the genome of strain RbCoV HKU14-10 differed from the other three genomes in the nsp3 region by the presence of a 117-bp deletion between PL2pro and the Y domain. p10 Unknown A4293 Q4429 137 137 nsp11 Unknown (short peptide at the end of ORF1a) S4430 V4443 14 14 nsp12 RdRp S4430 Q5357 928 928 nsp13 Hel S5358 Q5956 599 603 (599 in ECoV) nsp14 ExoN C5957 Q6477 521 521 nsp15 N only two of these small NS2a proteins contained one putative transmembrane domain predicted by TMHMM. PHEV was found to possess a shorter single NS2a protein than HCoV OC43, BCoV, ECoV, and PHEV as a result of the deletion of 84 amino acids at the C-terminal region. small NS2a proteins of RbCoV HKU14 are marked above the corresponding sequences. identical and highly conserved amino acid residues among all viruses are highlighted in black and gray. the amino acid sequence of the predicted S protein of RbCoV HKU14 is most similar to that of BCoV. five of these seven \u201cvirulent\u201d amino acids were also conserved in RbCoV. amino acid substitutions were observed for the other two (valine to threonine at position 33 and aspartic acid to alanine at position 469) a preceding TRS, 5\u2032-UCCAAAC-3\u2032, can be identified upstream of the E protein of RbCoV HKU14. the 3\u2032-untranslated region contains a predicted bulged stem-loop structure of 64 nucleotides (nucleotide positions 30797 to 30860) conserved in betacoronaviruses (77) coronavirus species demarcation (7) showed that RbCoV HKU14 possessed 90% amino acid identities to members of Betacoronavirus 1 in the ADRP. a total of 318, 959, 609, 1,791, 303, and 609 amino acid positions in 3CLpro, RdRp, Hel, S, M, and N, respectively, were included in the analyses. ine epidemic diarrhea virus (accession no.

Bootscan analysis detected potential recombination at various sites of the RbCoV HKU14 genome, most notably at around positions 7100 and 20350. this suggests that recombination may have occurred among these viruses during their evolution. similarity plot and sequence alignment analyses showed that upstream of position 7100, RbCoV HKU14 possessed a higher level of sequence similarity to ECoV than to PHEV, BCoV, and HCoV OC43. however, such close similarity to ECoV was no longer observed downstream of position 7100. this suggests that RbCoV HKU14 and ECoV have probably coevolved at the region upstream of position 7100. the date of divergence between HCoV OC43 and BCoV was estimated to be 1846.25 (HPDs, 1673.18 to 1958.81), approximately 165 years ago. the date of divergence between HCoV OC43 and BCoV was estimated to be 1929.71 (HPDs, 1881.95 to 1960.19), approximately 165 years ago. all positive sera were obtained from 30 rabbits with samples available. 20 (67%) were positive and 10 (33%) were negative. possible cross-antigenicity between the RbCoV HKU14 and HCoV OC43 N proteins was found. RT-PCR using specific primers for this novel virus, RbCoV HKU14, was positive for 11 (8.1%) of these 136 samples. viral replication was detected by RT-PCR in the supernatants of HRT-18G and RK13 cells at day 7. the sizes of the genomes of RbCoV HKU14 were 30,904 to 31,116 bases, with a G+C content of 38%. the genome organization is similar to that of other Betacoronavirus subgroup A CoVs. heptad repeats 990\u20131091 (HR1), 1258-1303 (HR2) NS5a 28178\u201328507 330 109 +2 E 28494\u201328763 270 89 +3 2 transmembrane domains 14\u201336 and 41\u201361 M 28760\u201329452 693 230 +2 3 transmembrane domains 35\u201345, 57\u201377, and 81\u2013101.

PHEV was found to possess a shorter single NS2a protein than HCoV OC43, BCoV, and ECoV as a result of the deletion of 84 amino acids at the C-terminal region. cyclic phosphodiesterase domains in the NS2 proteins of coronaviruses as well as toroviruses have been predicted. five amino acids that may affect receptor binding in BCoV were conserved in RbCoV HKU14. a previous study also identified seven amino acid substitutions in the S protein of BCoV that differ between virulent and avirulent cells. amino acid sites important for virulence in BCoV are highlighted in light gray. a preceding TRS, 5\u2032-UCCAAAC-3\u2032, can be identified upstream of the E protein of RbCoV HKU14. the four strains of RbCoV HKU14 formed a distinct cluster within Betacoronavirus subgroup A CoVs. they were more closely related to members of the species Betacoronavirus 1, BCoV, ECoV, PHEV, and HCoV OC43. however, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains (ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase [ADRP], ns analyses of chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (Hel), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) were constructed using Kimura's two-parameter correction and bootstrap values calculated from 1,000 trees. a total of 318, 959, 609, 1,791, 303, and 609 amino acid positions in 3CLpro, R Ro-BatCoV HKU9, Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (accession no.

HCoV OC43 and HCoV 229E, even if isolated, induce only subtle or nonexistent cytopathic effects. despite being closely related to SARS-CoV, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV has not been isolated in cells susceptible to SARS-CoV. HCoV OC43, BCoV, ECoV, and the MHV-H2 variant are also known to replicate in HRT-18 cells. many CoVs, especially those from bats, were detected in apparently healthy individuals without evidence of overt disease. domestic rabbits are descended from the wild European or Old World rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, originating from southern Europe and North Africa (39) natural recombination leading to the generation of different genotypes in HCoV HKU1 has also been described (67, 68) PHEV, BCoV, and HCoV OC43 are genetically and antigenically related betacoronaviruses that have been shown to have originated from a relatively recent common ancestor dating back to the end of the 19th century. continuous surveillance studies will also be important to monitor the genetic evolution of CoVs in various food animals."}
