{"summary": "cheetah fecal (n = 38) and serum (n = 20) samples from captive cheetahs were obtained from a repository at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in front Royal, VA, and National Zoological Park (NZP) in Washington, DC for genotypic and SAA protein analysis. animals were housed in groups, varying in size from 1 to 8 individuals. only one group had mixed sexes. the diet consisted of 1.5\u20132.5kg fresh horse and donkey meat per day. semi-nested PCR amplified a 716bp segment of the SAA1A promoter. the first PCR product was either purified using the QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN\u00ae) or was treated with ExoSAP-IT\u00ae (Affymetrix) before being used as template for the second reaction. set of the PCR products (n = 86) were genotyped by standard Sanger sequencing via GENEWIZ\u00ae Inc. the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN\u00ae) and premixed with the SAA1F primer. fluorescently labeled PCR products (n = 47) were run on the ABI PRISM\u00ae 310 Genetic Analyzer and analyzed with fragment size polymorphism. homozygotes produced a single peak, and heterozygotes produced 2 peaks. amplification of both SAA1A and SAA1B promoters simultaneously produced 4 amplified products. eradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (50 l) and sample/control/standard (50 l, in duplicate) were added to each pre-coated well. 100l of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution was added to each well. the plate was incubated for 1.5h on a shaker at room temperature. cheetahs ranged in age from 2 to 12 years old (median age 5.5 years) and were of variable health status. cheetahs ranged in age from 2 to 12 years old (median age 5.5 years) animals were housed individually (females, n = 8) or in sibling groups (males, n = 12) in enclosures ranging from 2525 m at NZP and 4050 m at SCBI. cheetahs had ad libitum access to water, a barn structure and an unheated yard shelter. sections of liver, kidney, spleen, or muscle tissue from a subset of cases (n = 48) with known amyloidosis status and available either frozen (80 \u00b0C) or formalin-fixed were obtained for DNA extraction and genotyping. semi-nested PCR was used to get adequate concentrations of the product from degraded DNA samples. initial external primer pair (F3A, SAA1R; Table 1) amplified a 716bp segment of the SAA1A promoter specifically; the seminested reaction with an alternative forward primer (SAA1F; Table 1) produced a smaller PCR product (186bp) containing the putative NF-B binding site. both polymerase chain reactions were carried out using GoTaq\u00ae Green Master Mix (Promega) +/97delG heterozygotes generated a chromatogram with overlapping peaks beginning at the 97 guanine deletion site in the SAA1A promoter. primer sequences used for amplification of the SAA1A promoter Primer Locationa Sequence Use F3Ab 745 to 724 bp 5\u2032-CAGATGGCCTCTCTGGTAGGTTTC-3\u2032 SAA1A specific forward primer SAA1Rc 30 to 49 bp 5 the SAA1 promoter region was amplified for 6 cheetahs (2 with each genotype) the SAA1B gene lacks the SAA1A97delG SNP (Chen et al. 2012). assay coefficients of variation (CV) for 2 internal controls were 8.5% and 27.2%. genome and allele frequencies were compared between populations using a Chi-square test. significant associations were declared when P 0.05. allele frequencies for the deceased representatives of the captive north american cheetah population with known AA amyloidosis diagnosis were estimated using the software MENDEL (Lange et al. 2013) genome and allele frequencies were compared between individuals confirmed with and without AA amyloidosis using a Chi-square test of homogeneity. additional copies of the SAA1A97delG allele are associated with a decrease in serum SAA protein concentrations. both dominance (d) and additional polygenic additive variance ( A 2 ) were not significantly different from zero (P = 0.9450 and P = 0.8247, respectively) allele frequencies of the SAA1A97delG SNP for wild or wild-born cheetahs in Namibia and captive cheetahs in North America Population Allele Estimateda frequency standard error Hardy\u2013Weinberg P valueb Namibia SAA1A 97delG 0.5032c 0.0600 0.291 (Wild or wild-born, n = 47) there was no significant difference in the frequency of the SAA1A97delG allele between these 2 groups of captive cheetahs. the SAA1A97delG allele does not appear to be associated with the disease (P = 0.1100, Wright\u2019s FST = 0.2362, Table 2). additional copies of the SAA1A97delG allele are associated with a decrease in serum SAA protein concentrations. both dominance (d) and additional polygenic additive variance ( A 2 ) were not significantly different from zero (P = 0.9450 and P = 0.8247, respectively) hs in Namibia and captive cheetahs in North America Population Allele Estimateda frequency standard error Hardy\u2013Weinberg P valueb Namibia SAA1A 97delG 0.5032c 0.0600 0.291 (Wild or wild-born, n = 47) SAA1A + 0.49680.0600 North America SAA1A 97delG 0.7158d 0.0796 0.422 (Captive, n = 38) SAA1 AA amyloidosis is considered \u201creactive\u201d and does not have a genetic basis. cheetah AA protein amino acid sequence is more similar to that of Abyssinian cats than DSH cats. AA amyloidosis is not of a true \u201cfamilial\u201d type and rather secondary to chronic inflammation. the identification of the SNP in the promoter region of the SAA1A gene in cheetahs suggests that AA amyloidosis in captive cheetahs may still be linked to genetic differences. cheetahs have a thymine (T) nucleotide at the 13 position in the promoter region of the SAA1 gene. this nucleotide position is not polymorphic, therefore all cheetahs may be predisposed to developing secondary AA amyloidosis. mortality, amyloid burden, and renal prognosis are all significantly correlated with serum SAA concentration. 76% of cheetahs with amyloidosis have moderate to severe gastritis. the high prevalence of AA amyloidosis only in captive cheetahs is more likely a result of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as gastritis, inducing the overproduction of SAA.
