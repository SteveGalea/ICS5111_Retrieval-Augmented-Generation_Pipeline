{"summary": "GALT is the largest single immunologic organ in the body, containing a large amount of lymphocytes. a majority of the CD4+ T cells that reside in GALT are CCR5 positive, activated memory CD4 T cells which are the preferred target cells for HIV/SIV infection. feces could be an easily accessible, non-invasive and inexpensive specimen to assess CD4+ T cell loss in GALT. HIV-1 from seropositive individuals has been detected from various body fluids including blood, semen, tears, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, breast milk and cervical secretions. there is little information on the presence of HIV-1 in urine. group C: HIV-1 positive on ART with non-detectable viral load in blood; group D: HIV-1 positive on ART with detectable viral load in blood. group B = HIV-1 Positive/ART/Non-detectable viral load N = 13 XX484 8/19/2008 50 440 XX008 8/20/2008 50 890 XX523 9. the HIV-1 positive plasma with viral load of 170,000 copies/ml was obtained from a HIV-1 infected Brazilian blood donor. plasma, serum and PBMC were isolated from these blood samples and used for CD4+ T cell counts and viral load measurement. 8E5 cell line and HIV-1 positive plasma were added to feces from HIV-1 negative persons before nucleic acid isolation. samples stored in 2 ml Cell-Lysis buffer were thawed and mixed completely by vortexing. the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed five times. most of the supernatant was removed and 50 ul of remaining supernatant and pellet was saved at -80\u00b0C for further RNA isolation. RNA was precipitated using isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol, air dried and stored in nuclease free water. PCR and RT-PCR were performed on isolated RNA/DNA samples to detect HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA. specific primers were used for optimal detection of HIV-1 subtype B env and gag regions, human beta-globin DNA, human beta-actin mRNA and CD4 mRNA.

Cloned plasmid DNA was purified from transformed E. Coli using Wizard\u00ae Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI) and digested with ecoRI restriction enzyme to confirm the insertion. the plasmid DNAs with the insertions were then sequenced using M13 forward or M13 reverse primers. DNA was synthesized by random hexamer followed by nested PCR amplification using human beta-actin mRNA specific primers. HIV-1 RNA was detected from normal feces mixed with HIV-1 positive plasma. the detection limit was as low as 40 copies/reaction. human beta-actin mRNA was amplified by RT nested PCR amplification. as shown in Figure 1A, relatively equal amounts of beta-actin mRNA were detected from all isolated fecal RNA. HIV-1 RNA was detected in 3 out of 16 (19%) subjects with detectable viral load in blood. 5 subjects were not on ART and 2 subjects were on ART. no CD4 mRNA was detected in any HIV-1 uninfected donor's fecal specimens or infected donors with undetectable viral loads. fecal blood was detected in 7 out of 39 fecal specimens. HIV-1 DNA was detected in 7 urine pellet samples from HIV infected subjects, 4 from subjects with detectable. all 34 urine pellet samples were positive for beta-globin amplification. RNA purified from 34 urine supernatants was tested by RT nested-PCR to detect HIV env region. RNA purified from the 34 urine supernatants was tested by RT nested-PCR to detect HIV env region. cal sample was mixed with different concentrations of HIV-1 positive 8E5 cells. for every DNA sample, the human beta-globin gene was PCR amplified to ensure that the isolated DNA was amplifiable and contained the comparable amount of human DNA. a nested PCR reaction was performed to detect HIV-1 DNA from the isolated DNA using HIV-1 env specific primers. nucleic acids isolated from 200 mg of fecal specimen were subjected to RT nested-PCR for amplification of HIV-1 env C2-V5 region. for every DNA sample, the human beta-globin gene was PCR amplified to ensure the comparable amount of human DNA contained in each PCR reaction. the beta-globin gene was detected in 17 out of 39 fecal specimens. two out of three HIV-1 env targeted-PCR positive and two out of two env negative fecal RNA samples maintained the identical outcome using gag specific primers. cloning and sequencing of the PCR product using env specific primers from the fecal samples demonstrated that the PCR products were HIV-1 subtype B env sequences. the fecal occult blood test was negative for the fecal samples. one of the five CD4 mRNA positive fecal specimens was positive for occult blood. the remaining samples were negative. HIV-1 DNA was amplified from the DNA purified from the urine pellet in a nested-PCR reaction using the env primers described previously. RNA purified from the 34 urine supernatants was tested by RT nested-PCR to detect HIV env region. the validity of the branching orders was estimated with 1000 replicates. reference strains were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV database. phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the sequences belong to HIV-1 subtype B. HIV-1 DNA was detected from normal donor feces mixed with 8E5 cells. detection limit of 2.5 copies of HIV-1 RNA/reaction. fecal samples were collected from HIV-1 uninfected and infected donors. al DNA was detected, but HIV-1 RNA was detected in 67% of subjects' fecal samples by RT-nested PCR. levels of HIV-1 shedding from GALT to intestinal lumen might be higher compared to the later chronic phase of infection. the gastrointestinal tract is the major reservoir of viral infected cells. no CD4 mRNA was detected in any feces samples from the HIV-1 negative donors or HIV-1 infected with undetectable plasma viral load. the results suggest that CD4+ T cells were shed from GALT to intestinal lumen in the infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load. fecal occult blood test was performed in all samples. HIV-1 DNA was detected in 7 urine pellet samples from the 29 infected subjects. 4 of the 7 samples from subjects (2 subjects were not on ART and 2 subjects on ART) with detectable plasma viral load, and 3 from subjects (who were on ART) and with undetectable viral load. this result indicates that the detection of HIV-1 in urine is not necessarily associated with plasma viral load. authors' contributions AC carried out all the feces DNA/RNA isolation and HIV-1 detection work and drafted the manuscript. LC, MD and CS performed urine DNA/RNA isolation and HIV-1 detection."}
