{"summary": "emerging infections can be defined as those diseases whose incidence has been found to be increased within recent decades or which have threatened to increase in the future. emergences are often detection/spread of pathogens in newer areas, recognition of the presence of diseases that have been present in a population albeit as undetected entities. the major arboviral pathogens of humans belong to the three genera of Flavivirus, Alphavirus and Nairovirus. chikungunya, an arboviral illness characterized by debilitating and prolonged arthralgia, has been re-emerging since 20067. a consistent theme in the infectious disease landscape of the country has been the periods of quiescence of several pathogens following their discovery. no zika-associated microcephaly cases have been identified in the country. there have also been cases of discovery of novel pathogens in the country. these viruses were identified during the 1950s-1960s12,13,14. the IDSP network reported a total of 1683 outbreaks of such diseases. 71 per cent of these outbreaks were caused by viral pathogens. the national vector borne disease control programme (NVBDCP) undertakes the surveillance for the vector-borne diseases in the country. this programme focusses on the prevention and control of diseases, which include malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, kala-azar and lymphatic filariasis. annual pilgrimage to Sabarimala temple in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. annual pilgrimage to Mahamaham in Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. transmission of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections remains major concerns during such large-scale assemblies. use/sharing of contaminated instruments may result in heightened risk for transmission of infections, including hepatitis-C virus (HCV), hepatitis-B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) appreciable risks also exist at dental clinics, haemodialysis units, etc. viviridae Yellow fever Arthropod-borne Yes 4 Zika virus Arthropod-borne Yes* 2 Bagaza virus Arthropod-borne Yes* 2 Paramyxoviridae Influenza - (H3N2) v alias Air-borne Yes 3 Influenza -Avian (H5N1) Air-borne Yes 4 RSV Air-borne Yes 2 Quaranfil virus Tick-borne Yes* 2 Parainfluenza 1-4 Air-borne Yes* 2 Enter contact Yes 2 Chickenpox (varicella) VZV Air-borne, direct contact Yes 3 Reoviridae Kammavanpettai virus (orbiviruses) Tick-borne No Unknown *May cause epidemic; however, no epidemic has been reported. more than 300 EV types have been described57. the disease spectrum associated with these includes acute flaccid paralysis, meningitis, encephalitis, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, myositis, respiratory tract infections. coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and CV-A6 have been major and CV-A10, EV-A71 and E-9, infrequent causes of these outbreaks in the southern and eastern parts of India61. Saxena et al62 reported the circulation of three genotypes of EV-A71 in the country and also identified as a new genogroup (G) of the same. a recent report indicated that HSV-1 was a significant pathogen in paediatric cases of acute viral encephalitis64. VZV, one of the herpes viruses, is the causative agent for varicella (chickenpox), an acute febrile illness with diffuse maculopapular vesicular rash. influenza pandemics have occurred in 1918 (Swine influenza), 1957 (Asian flu), 1968 (Hong Kong flu), 1977 (Russian flu) and the recent pandemic of 2009 (pandemic influenza A H1N1)71. the surface antigenic glycoproteins undergo two major types of antigenic variation, viz. antigenic shift and antigenic drift. over 2207 laboratory-confirmed cases and 787 deaths have occurred due to MERS-CoV infection globally, since 201275. clinical spectrum of illness ranges from asymptomatic infections to acute respiratory distress syndrome, resulting in multi-organ failure and death. no case of infection with this virus has been detected in India so far. the public health risk from the currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface remains the same. but the sustained human-to-human transmission of this virus is low. estimates indicate an annual incidence of approximately 34 million episodes of ALRTI associated with RSV infection in children aged five years or less80. strains formed a distinct cluster in the Asian-Middle East group IV84. the high-risk groups are those who either get exposed to ticks or close contacts with bodily fluids of acute viraemic CCHF-positive cases. the high-risk groups are those who either get exposed to ticks (e.g. farmers, shepherds and veterinarians) and persons (mainly healthcare workers/family members) who come in close contact with the CCHF patients85. no specific treatment is available for CCHF-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. treatment includes supportive medications and maintenance of fluid-electrolyte balance. antiviral drug ribavirin has shown promise in some studies89. the illness manifests with high-grade fever with or without chills, frontal headache and body ache, lasting for 5-12 days. the CFR is generally around 3-5 per cent and the convalescence is often prolonged. in some infected individuals, the illness is biphasic, starting after a febrile period of 1-2 wk. yF is a viral haemorrhagic fever disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. it is transmitted to humans either through contact of blood or fluids of infected animals as well as bite from infected mosquitoes. the disease is known in two forms: mild and severe. yF presents with acute-onset jaundice with constitutional symptoms. cases with severe symptoms may land up in liver and multi-organ failure. a single dose of YF vaccine is sufficient to provide life-long immunity within 10 days after vaccination. rotaviral infections will help in early identification of the rare and emerging strains of rotaviruses. monitoring of rotavirus disease and strains is essential to assess the impact of rotavirus vaccines and circulating rotavirus strains in the country. human noV was first detected in the stool specimen of a gastroenteritis outbreak in norwalk. it was the first viral agent reported as a cause of AGE104. there are five genotypes of NoV (GI-GV) of which GI, GII and GIV are responsible for human AGE cases. tests often reveal infections with Salmonella sp., Leptospira sp., Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus also as the underlying cause of FUO109. despite a battery of tests for a variety of pathogens, an aetiological agent is often not detected in as much as one-third to one-fourth of patients with FUO109. the virus causes multi-organ vasculitis with symptoms including fever, headache, drowsiness, dizziness and coma. Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels have also been reported from NiV-infected cases. LCMV causes a wide range of human infections from meningoencephalitis to congenital birth defects. it is also known to cause severe disseminated illness reported from organ transplant immunocompromised patients. in pregnancy, LCMV may cause foetal death or induce/spontaneous abortion. parvovirus B19, human bocaviruses 1-4 and adeno-associated viruses 1-536 are the other viruses of significance in this family. adeno-associated viruses 1-536 are found mainly in africa, europe and the u.s. foetus can be infected after a primary or a recurrent infection in pregnant women. infections in utero are associated with intrauterine death or congenital foetal abnormalities and intrauterine growth retardation as sequelae126,127. CHPV is a known public health problem in certain parts of Maharashtra and in Andhra Pradesh132. a substantial section of population in these regions remains at risk. the factors responsible for the amplification of this virus in natural reservoirs need to be investigated in detail. novel phlebovirus was isolated from bats in india and found phylogenetically related to SFTSV135. it is divided into two serotypes: serotype-1 from ticks collected from a limestone cave in Nepal and Fomede virus (FV) from bat species in caves in Guinea in 1978. BPX is a double-stranded, enveloped DNA virus in the genus OPXV and family Poxviridae42. BPX is a highly contagious and one of the known and important zoonotic viral disease144 affecting humans and livestock species such as buffaloes and cows. the disease is characterized by erythematous pocks on arms, face and neck, along with fever, axillary lymphadenopathy and malaise. the first report of a zoonotic human case of BPX was reported in 1934148. a possibility exists that VARV and VACV-related viruses may re-emerge in human and animal population, posing a public health threat. the surface antigenic glycoproteins undergo two major types of antigenic variation, viz. antigenic shift and antigenic drift. the surface antigenic glycoproteins undergo two major types of antigenic variation, viz. antigenic shift and antigenic drift. antigenic drift results due to minor changes in HA or NA and causes occasional pandemics72. no case of infection with this virus has been detected in india so far. sporadic reports of human infections with AI and swine influenza viruses, but sustained human-to-human transmission is low. the WHO has started a pilot project for RSV surveillance in its six regions. the exact burden and impact of RSV infections in the country need to be studied in depth. CCHF virus belongs to the genus Orthonairovirus of the family Nairoviridae. nearly 81 cases have been diagnosed positive for CCHF since 2011. clinical features include abrupt onset of high-grade fever, severe headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sore throat. ribavirin has shown promise in some studies89; however, its use remains controversial. CCHF is the highest priority disease globally, needing urgent research and development. a formalin-inactivated, chick embryo fibroblast-derived KFD vaccine is currently employed for prophylaxis in the affected areas. the vaccine was found to be immunogenic, safe and potent. however, no specific treatment is available for KFD till date. a small percentage of patients develop severe forms of disease including: ocular (eye) disease (in 0.5-2%) with blurred vision, lesions in eyes involving macula leading to loss of vision. meningoencephalitis form (in less than 1%) that usually occurs after 1-4 wk of onset of initial RFV symptoms presenting with severe headache, memory loss, disorientation, disorientation, lethargy, convulsions, hallucinations leading to coma a single dose of YF vaccine is sufficient to provide life-long immunity within 10 days after vaccination. 99 per cent immunity within 30 days. there is currently no specific anti-viral drug available for the treatment of YF. there are 14 genogroups of sapoviruses. the four genogroups of human sapovirus infection are GI, GII, GIV and GV. the first detection of sapovirus in India was in 2000 from Vellore101. noV positivity was found to be 6.3-12.6 per cent with a prominence of GII genotype (96.6%)107. it is the second most common cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in western India. NiV belongs to the Henipavirus and is a pathogenic paramyxovirus. it causes acute-onset encephalitis, leading to deaths in humans. the reservoir for NiV is known to be Pteropus bats (flying foxes) infections by NiV in humans and animals are confirmed by virus isolation, RNA as well as anti-Nipah IgM and IgG antibodies detection. there are no vaccines available for NiV for human use. congenital LCMV does not occur unless pregnant women contract with primary LCMV infection during pregnancy. in india, the incidence of LCMV was observed to be 0.76 per cent in rat and mice of southern and north India. a high prevalence of PARV4 infection (35%) among those with HIV infection (with or without HCV co-infection) has been reported from Iran122. high PARV4 levels were observed in CSF in children suspected to have encephalitis from southern India. 83 per cent seropositivity for CMV IgG and 9.46 per cent seropositivity for CMV IgM have been observed in antenatal women129. in india, due to scarcity of birth defects, it is difficult to extrapolate the true incidence of recurrent CMV. the factors responsible for the amplification of this virus in natural reservoirs need to be investigated in detail. the virus belongs to the genus Phlebovirus and family Bunyaviridae. CGV is divided into two serotypes: serotype-1 from ticks collected from a limestone cave in Nepal while Fomede virus (FV) was isolated from bat species in caves in Guinea in 1978. serological evidence was found in horses, sheep, cattle, buffalo and humans137. BPX is a double-stranded, enveloped DNA virus in the genus OPXV and family Poxviridae42. BPX is a highly contagious and one of the known and important zoonotic viral disease144 affecting humans and livestock species. over 200 viral pathogens, belonging to the families Orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Adenoviridae and Herpesviridae, cause respiratory infections in humans. influenza pandemics have occurred earlier in 1918 (Swine influenza), 1957 (Asian flu), 1968 (Hong Kong flu), 1977 (Russian flu) and the recent pandemic of 2009 (pandemic influenza A H1 antigenic drift results due to minor changes in HA or NA and causes frequent epidemics72. influenza viruses are continuously evolving and show ubiquitous distribution in the environment, animals and humans. india is home to a great diversity of bat species and has substantial camel population. the country also reports heavy passenger traffic from the Middle East. sporadic reports of human infections with AI and other zoonotic influenza viruses. CCHF virus belongs to the genus Orthonairovirus of the family Nairoviridae. this virus was detected from almost 30 countries in africa, south-eastern Europe, the Middle East and Western Asia. CCHF virus clustering is seen in 6-7 different groups (group I - West African strains; Group II - Central African strains; Group III - South Africa and West Africa, Group IV - the Middle East and Asian strains; Group V - European strains clinical features include abrupt onset of high-grade fever, severe headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sore throat. the disease typically progresses through the stages of incubation period, pre-haemorrhagic, haemorrhagic period and then convalescence89. the virus was identified for the first time in 1957 during investigations of a febrile illness affecting monkeys and humans. since 1957, the disease has occurred in sporadic and epidemic form in many parts of Karnataka State in India. since 2012, KFD infections (involving monkeys and humans) have also been reported from states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Maharashtra29. a formalin-inactivated, chick embryo fibroblast-derived KFD vaccine is currently employed for prophylaxis in the affected areas. the vaccine was found to be immunogenic, safe and potent. however, no specific treatment is available for KFD till date. yF is a viral haemorrhagic fever disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and belongs to family Filoviridae. yF presents with acute-onset jaundice with constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. rotavirus is one of the major causes of severe and dehydrating diarrhoea amongst children aged less than five years. in india, rotavirus is responsible for almost 22% deaths, 30 per cent hospitalizations and 8.3% outpatient visits each year30. the first detection of sapovirus in India was in 2000 from Vellore101. sapovirus infections accounted for 16.7% of cases103. in india, sapovirus has also been detected in asymptomatic children. in india, noV infections are common cause of childhood AGE cases. the replacement strains had made a cautionary and pointed out the need for strain-specific vaccines. locally endemic infections such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, japanese encephalitis33 and influenza could probably be responsible for AUF cases. transmission to humans usually occurs through contact of positive NiV cases through their infectious secretions or an intermediate animal host such as pigs. human-to-human spread of the virus has also been described110. evidence of the virus without clinical disease has also been found in fruit bats in Cambodia, Thailand and Madagascar. TPMV belongs to the family Hantaviridae and the genus Orthohantavirus. it is known to cause transient viraemia with shedding of virus from oropharyngeal secretions of the house shrew. LCMV causes a wide range of human infections from meningoencephalitis to congenital birth defects. the presence of LCMV in rat and mice of southern and north India was analyzed and found to be 2.85 per cent117,118. the presence of LCMV in rat and mice of southern and north India was analyzed and found to be 0.76 per cent in mice. CMV is a highly host-specific virus belonging to herpesviridae family37. it is of public health importance as it is known to responsible for high morbidity and mortality in new-borns as well as immunocompromised patients. CHPV is a single-stranded, negative sense, RNA arbovirus of the genus Vesiculovirus and family Rhabdoviridae. it was first discovered by Bhatt and Rodrigues130 in 1966 during investigations of febrile illness in Chandipura region of Maharashtra. the virus belongs to the genus Phlebovirus and family Bunyaviridae. it includes fever, thrombocytopenia, leucocytopenia, gastrointestinal and muscular symptoms, neurological abnormalities, coagulopathy and haemophagocytic syndrome. the virus has been detected in haemaphysalis ticks134. EEV is an arthropod-borne Orbivirus (Family Reoviridae) and causes febrile non-contagious disease in equids138. infection presents as an acute illness involving lack of appetite and oedema40. disease results in 60-70 per cent morbidity in equids, but deaths are rare139. BPX is a double-stranded, enveloped DNA virus in the genus OPXV and family Poxviridae42. it causes considerable financial loss to the dairy industry in terms of reduction in milk production and draught capacity145. in buffaloes and cows, this disease affects udder, teats, inguinal region, ears and eyes. there is a need for strengthening disease surveillance in the country. there is also a pressing need to gain detailed insights into disease biomics. it is also important to strengthen the emergency preparedness for these diseases and response by focusing on one health approach."}
