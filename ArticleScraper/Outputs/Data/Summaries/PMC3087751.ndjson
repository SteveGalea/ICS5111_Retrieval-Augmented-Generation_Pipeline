{"summary": "genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding the -adrenergic receptors (-AR) have a pivotal role in the functions of the autonomic nervous system. results provide evidence that 2-AR polymorphisms are significantly associated with the acceleration/deceleration pattern of heart rate oscillation, reflecting. instantaneous heart rate in response to physiological perturbations exhibits remarkable oscillations at multiple time scales. these oscillations, known as heart rate variability (HRV), are mainly mediated by the autonomic nervous system via parasympathetic and sympathetic innervations. -AR has a pivotal role in the functions of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. -AR has a pivotal role in the functions of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. -AR has a pivotal role in the functions of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis categorized subjects into clusters based on pairwise dissimilarity among heart rate dynamics. we investigated the association of these clustering patterns with -AR gene polymorphisms. subjects recruited by advertisement among medical employees, research laboratory staff working at both hospitals. valid DNA samples were obtained in 221 healthy adult subjects. participants were asked to avoid smoking or drinking alcoholic beverages. the final study sample consisted of 221 healthy adult subjects. all experiments were performed by investigators who were blind to phenotype. failure in genotyping for rs1801252 polymorphism was noted in 6 cases. the root-mean-square fluctuation of integrated and detrended time series is measured at different observation windows. the scaling exponent is then derived from the slope of line fitting to the obtained log-log plot. low-exponent values represent reduced fractal propertiy of heart rate dynamics. entropy over scale factors from 1\u20135 and 6\u201320 was calculated to represent short-term and long-term MSE measures. the method was developed to effectively categorize symbolic sequences according to their information content. the method has been fully described and validated [16], with applications to heart rate time series, literary texts, and genetic sequences. the diagonal line indicates the case where the rank order of 6-tuple symbolic sequence for both subjects is identical. we plotted the rank number of each n-tuple sequence in the first sequence against that of the second sequence. the average deviation of these scattered points away from the diagonal line is a measure of the dissimilarity index between these two sequences. a non-randomness index was defined to measure the symbolic patterns of heart rate dynamics away from complete randomness. the non-randomness index is independent of conventional entropic measures. the calculation of the non-randomness index is based on estimating the average n-tuple distance between raw interbeat interval time series and its randomly shuffled surrogates using the IBS method. cluster-specific association was analyzed by the chi-square test to assess the frequency of -AR polymorphisms. to validate cluster-specific associations, we tested the differences in HRV and -AR genotypes in estimated clusters based on first- and second-half ECG data. electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring took place in the daytime. participants were asked to avoid smoking or drinking alcoholic beverages. valid DNA samples were obtained in 221 healthy adult subjects. all samples were genotyped for eight unrelated SNPs for DNA quality examination. failure in genotyping for rs1801252 polymorphism was noted in 6 cases. detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [27], [28] and multiscale entropy (MSE) [29] are available at physionet (http://physionet.org), a research resource for complex physiologic signals. y was calculated using a pattern length (m) of 2 and a similarity factor (r) of 0.15. the sum of sample entropy over scale factors from 1\u20135 and 6\u201320 was computed to represent the overall MSE measure. frequencies of 26 = 64 6-tuple symbolic patterns were determined. for each 6-tuple symbolic sequence, its rank in subject A is plotted against its rank in subject B. the diagonal line indicates the case where the rank order of 6-tuple symbolic sequence for both subjects is identical. a non-randomness index was defined to measure the symbolic patterns of heart rate dynamics away from complete randomness (i.e., absence of ordered control of the autonomic nervous system) the non-randomness index is independent of conventional entropic measures (i.e., sample entropy or approximate entropy) a p value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was required for all statistical comparisons. a complete-linkage, hierarchical clustering tree was estimated using the generalized association plot. ser/Sern = 155 Gly allelen = 60 p Time domain Mean heart rate, beats/minute 82.913.2 86.212.0 0.087 SDNN, ms 77.324.4 70.720.2 0.064 RMSSD, ms 30.613.5 28.013.3 0.204
