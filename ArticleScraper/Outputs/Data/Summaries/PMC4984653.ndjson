{"summary": "eukaryotic mRNAs possess a methylated 5\u2032 guanosine cap linked to the penultimate nucleotide by a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge. the 5\u2032 capping of cellular mRNAs functions in RNA stability, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export from the nucleus, and protection against antiviral defenses. nsp16 of feline coronavirus functions independently as a 2\u2032O-MTase (16\u201318), but SARS-CoV nsp16 requires nsp10 as a cofactor for 2\u2032O-MTase activity. nsp14 is a multifunctional protein with 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity and N7-MTase activity (24, 25) nsp10/16-mediated 2\u2032O-methylation in vitro is a prerequisite for nsp10/16-mediated 2\u2032O-methylation in vitro. alteration of these residues abolishes MTase activity in vitro. however, the requirements of the coV nsp14 N7-MTase during viral replication are not known. fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B were supplemented to contain 0.8 mg/ml of G418. BMDCs were maintained in R10 medium (RPMI 1640 [Gibco] supplemented to contain 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine. inocula were removed, cells were washed with 1 phosphate-buffered saline. cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 h postinfection. cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 h postinfection. at 12 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were aspirated and cell lysates were harvested by adding TRIzol reagent. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using 1 g of total RNA. medium in 24-well plates at 105 cells/well and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. inocula were removed, and fresh medium was added. cell culture supernatants were collected 24 h postinfection. firefly luciferase-encoding sequence was translated at 30\u00b0C. subconfluent DBT cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. cell culture supernatants were removed, cells were washed with PBS. subconfluent monolayers of DBT-9 cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell at 37\u00b0C for 45 min in the presence of DMSO or 100 g/ml cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma) cDNA was generated by RT-PCR, and the number of viral genome copies present relative to Renilla luciferase was determined by phenol-chloroform extraction. escein (FAM)-labeled probe was used with forward (5\u2032-TTCTGACAACGGCTACACCCAACG-3\u2032) primers. the final volume for reaction mixtures was 20 l, with 150 nM probe, 900 nM each primer, 2 l sample RNA, and 10 l 2 ToughMix, one-step, low ROX enzyme mix (Quantas) per reaction mixture. recombinant MHV strain A59 (GenBank accession number AY910861) was propagated. site-directed mutagenesis was used to engineer point mutations in individual MHV genome cDNA fragment plasmids using the MHV infectious clone reverse genetics system (28). mutant viruses were recovered using MHV A frag-FFL2 (29) 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; Sigma) was prepared as a 200 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) drug was removed, and cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. inocula were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. mouse IFN- expression levels relative to GAPDH were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using the Applied Biosciences 7500 real-time PCR system with the Power SYBR green PCR master mix and the IFN- primers FWD, 5\u2032-TCCGCCCTGTGAGGTTGAT-3\u2032, and REV. primary BMDCs were isolated from the hind limbs of WT and IFN-/ receptor-deficient (IFNAR/) Virion RNA was purified from subconfluent T150 flasks of BHK-R cells infected with WT-FFL or nsp14 G332A-FFL viruses at an MOI of 0.001 PFU/cell. cell culture supernatants were collected and pooled into 50-ml conical tubes (Corning), clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min, and stored at 80\u00b0C. subconfluent monolayers of DBT-9 cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. cell culture supernatants were removed, cells were washed with PBS, and 100 l of reporter cell lysis buffer (Promega) was added to each well. cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using nsp10 and Renilla luciferase-specific primers. a standard curve was generated using 10-fold dilutions from 103 to 108 copies. a 5\u2032 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled probe was used with forward (5\u2032-AGAAGGCTACACCCAACG-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-TGTCCACGGCTAAATCAAAC-3\u2032) reaction mixtures were 20 l, with 150 nM probe, 900 nM each primer, 2 l sample RNA, and 10 l 2 ToughMix, one-step, low ROX enzyme mix (Quantas) per reaction mixture. samples were quantified in duplicate using an Applied Biosciences 7500 real-time PCR system. the last two steps repeated 40 times. nsp14 D330A plaque morphology was similar to that of WT MHV. the nsp14 G332A virus began exponential replication 4 to 6 h later than WT MHV. the nsp14 G332A virus plaque size was also decreased relative to that of WT MHV. matic activities, a proofreading 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN) and N7-MTase activity (24, 25) based on in vitro studies, the ExoN and N7-MTase domains of CoV nsp14 are interdependent (26). disruption of ExoN (ExoN) via mutations at two active-site residues decreases replication fidelity of MHV and SARS-CoV. cell culture supernatants were collected at either 12 or 24 h postinfection. for each virus, titers were normalized to those following infection of DMSO-treated controls. mutations in viral titers for nsp14 D330A and nsp14 G332A viruses were not statistically significant relative to WT MHV. nsp14 D330A virus exhibits increased induction of and sensitivity to IFN-. DBT cells were treated for 18 h with the indicated concentrations of mouse IFN-. cell culture supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. BMDCs were infected with either WT or nsp14 G332A virus at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. at 24 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. nsp14 G332A virus replication could be rescued in BMDCs lacking the IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR/) IFNAR/ cells lack the capacity to respond to type I IFNs and are thus incapable of mounting an effective IFN-dependent antiviral response. nsp14 G332A genome translation is delayed during infection. other mechanisms, such as decreased genome RNA stability or decreased viral genome translation, may contribute to the replication defect of this virus. the 5\u2032 capping of cellular mRNAs serves several important functions. cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using MHV nsp10 and Renilla luciferase-specific primers. the number of viral genome copies present relative to Renilla luciferase was determined by SYBR green qPCR. nsp14 G332A mutation impairs viral translation efficiency. ratio of luciferase activity to genome copies was highest at early times postinfection. nsp14 G332A-FFL virus requires more genomic RNA to achieve the WT levels of FFL activity. nsp14 G332A-FFL and WT-FFL virions are equivalently infectious. for the first lysate sample, luciferase activity was quantified (A) for the remaining lysate sample, RNA was extracted, and genome RNA copies were quantified using real-time qRT-PCR. values were normalized to WT-FFL at 6 h postinfection. we quantified the relative translation efficiency of equal amounts of WT-FFL and nsp14 G332A-FFL genomic RNA over time. at all time points tested after 15 min, FFL activity was significantly reduced following incubation of reticulocyte lysates with nsp14 G332A-FFL genomes relative to WT-FFL genomes. in vitro for the times shown, and luciferase activity was quantified. mutations in this motif of SARS-CoV nsp14 ablate N7-MTase activity of purified proteins in vitro. nsp14 D330A virus replicated with kinetics comparable to that of WT MHV. nsp14 nsp14 is a multifunctional protein with two known enzymatic activities, a proofreading 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN) and N7-MTase activity (24, 25). nsp14 mutations do not significantly influence nsp14 ExoN activity. nsp14 D330A and nsp14 G332A viruses were not significantly altered in 5-FU sensitivity compared with WT MHV. the nsp14 D330A and nsp14 G332A viruses were not significantly altered in 5-FU sensitivity compared with WT MHV. nsp14 N7-methylation is a prerequisite for 2\u2032O-methylation in vitro. decreased nsp14 N7-MTase activity should reduce overall 2\u2032O-methylation, thereby increasing virus sensitivity to exogenous type I IFN due to recognition by IFIT1 and MDA5. nsp14 G332A virus exhibits increased induction of and sensitivity to IFN-. cell culture supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. error bars represent SEM (n = 4). ND, not detectable. coronaviruses lacking 2\u2032O-MTase activity induce higher levels of IFN- than do the WT viruses (8, 22, 23) sensitivity to the effects of type I interferon pretreatment, we pretreated DBT cells with 10 U/ml murine IFN- for 18 h prior to infection with WT MHV. T or IFNAR/ BMDCs were infected with WT MHV or nsp14 G332A virus at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. cell culture supernatants were collected 24 h postinfection. nsp14 G332A virus replicated poorly in WT BMDCs. CHX inhibits translation of input viral genomes and prevents expression of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. at the indicated times postinfection, cell lysates were harvested and spiked with a known amount of in vitro-transcribed Renilla luciferase RNA. at each time point postinfection, cell lysates were harvested and spiked with a known amount of in vitro-transcribed Renilla luciferase RNA nsp14 nsp14 G332A cloned genome was first engineered by eIF4E. nsp14 nsp2 is the second protein translated from the input viral genome. lysates were prepared at various intervals postinfection to quantify luciferase activity and viral genome RNA copy number. to genome copies was substantially less for the nsp14 G332A-FFL virus at early time points postinfection than for WT-FFL. the ratio of nsp14 G332A-FFL particles per PFU was approximately 7-fold more than WT-FFL. therefore, packaged nsp14 G332A-FFL genomes were less efficient at establishing infection than the WT. nsp14 G332A-FFL genomes are translated less efficiently than WT-FFL genomes in vitro. nsp14 G332A-FFL genomes are translated less efficiently than WT-FFL genomes in vitro. nsp14 G332A-FFL genomes are translated less efficiently. nsp14 G332A-FFL genomic RNA is translated at lower efficiency in vitro. supernatants were harvested and clarified, and virions were collected by ultracentrifugation. virion pellets were resuspended, TRIzol was added, and virion RNAs were purified. a previous study using vesicular stomatitis virus identified a SAM-binding residue within the L protein (G1674) that, when altered, does not affect viral replication or N7-MTase activity. a previous study using both in vitro functional assays and yeast complementation reported that SARS-CoV nsp14 D331 is essential for N7-MTase activity. viable viruses were not recovered after at least three attempts for each mutant. nsp14 G332A virus replicated with delayed kinetics and reached peak titers 1,000-fold less than those of WT MHV. mutations at these residues do not dampen ExoN activity during virus replication. 32A virus is likely due to a combination of factors including increased detection by immune sensors and decreased translation efficiency of viral RNA. nsp14 G332A virus did not replicate following IFN- pretreatment with doses of >75 U/ml. the delayed translation kinetics of nsp14 G332A genomic RNA increases innate sensing of the virus by delaying the early expression of multiple CoV IFN antagonists upon entry, resulting in decreased replication capacity. our studies suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of the CoV nsp14 N7-MTase would impair virus replication."}
