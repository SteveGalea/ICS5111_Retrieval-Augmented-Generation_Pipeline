{"summary": "the aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the dental students and evaluate their awareness about MERS-CoV. more than half of the students interviewed had good knowledge about the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of MERS-CoV. the majority of cases (>85%) have occurred in Saudi Arabia. there have been 572 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by WHO globally as of May 15, 2014. there have been 173 deaths (30% mortality rate) cases reported between April 11, 2014 and may 4, 2014 by Saudi Arabia were probably seasonal, related to the birthing season of camels. a bat of the Taphozous genus was found in a fragments of the MERS sequence. but contacts between bats and people are rare, and this idea still needs more study. a study of 47 patients with MERS-CoV infection in saudi arabia found 45 (96%) had underlying comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus (68%), hypertension (34%), chronic cardiac disease (28%), and chronic kidney disease (49%). the mortality rate is around 30%, and there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment available. a-2a, started a median of 3 days after diagnosis (20 patients), was associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, compared with 24 patients who received only supportive care (70 vs 29% survival), but the outcome was not significant at 28 days (30 vs 17% survival, a nonsignificant difference). travel recommendations The WHO does not recommend special screening for MERS-CoV at points of entry or the application of any travel or trade restrictions. countries outside the affected region maintain a high level of vigilance, especially those with large numbers of travelers or guest workers returning from the Middle East. the high number of MERS-CoV cases reported between April 11, 2014 and may 4, 2014 by Saudi Arabia were probably seasonal, related to the birthing season of camels. a bat of the Taphozous genus was found in a fragments of the MERS sequence. the majority of cases in the spring of 2014 in Saudi Arabia were acquired through human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings. camels in the Arabian Peninsula and in part of north and east Africa have been shown to carry the virus. the high number of MERS-CoV cases reported between April 11, 2014 and may 4, 2014 by Saudi Arabia were probably seasonal. the majority of cases in the spring of 2014 in Saudi Arabia were acquired through human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings. the majority of cases in the spring of 2014 were acquired through human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings. people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease should avoid contact with camels, drinking camel's urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. the number of cases reported among healthcare workers from hospitals in jeddah was amplified due to overcrowding and inadequate infection control measures. the mortality rate is around 30%, and there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment available. people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised patients are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. the WHO and the CDC have issued recommendations for the prevention and control of MERS-CoV infections in healthcare settings. an increased level of infection control precautions is recommended when caring for patients with probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infection. contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. the WHO and the CDC have issued recommendations for the prevention and control of MERS-CoV infections in healthcare settings. an increased level of infection control precautions is recommended when caring for patients with probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infection. the CDC recommends the use of standard, contact, and airborne precautions for the management of hospitalized patients. the WHO recommends countries outside the affected region maintain a high level of vigilance. the questionnaire contained 12 questions which were formulated based on the information given by MOH for MERS-CoV. the questionnaire was edited in English and distributed to the dental group. a sizable proportion (48%) of the respondents reported that the source of MERS-CoV is camels, 18% gave the answer as bats, and 32% had no idea. more than two-thirds (64%) knew that close contact with confirmed MERS patient spreads the infection. 79% applied methods of protection such as washing hands with alcohol sanitizer, using mask, goggles, and avoiding personnel contact with the confirmed patient. the main infection prevention and control measures for managing acute viral respiratory tract infection are simple and well documented. first droplet precaution is wearing a surgical mask within 1 m of the patient; contact precaution is also important by wearing gown and gloves on entering the room and removing them on leaving. the majority of respondents were aware of the measures adopted for protection. dental students had good knowledge about MERS-CoV. however, more information still must be provided by MOH and college for medical staff. dental students had good knowledge of MERS-CoV (etiology, symptoms, protection) and this may reflect the successful distribution of the information about MERS-CoV by college 27% and MOH 25%. medical staff are the first people in contact with patients infected by the virus."}
