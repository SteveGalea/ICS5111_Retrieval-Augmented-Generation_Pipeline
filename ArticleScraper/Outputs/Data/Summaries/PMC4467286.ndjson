{"summary": "studies explored aspects of women\u2019s health and elaborated ways in which contemporary biomedicine perpetuated masculinist notions of healthy bodies. health services have been shown to institutionalise discriminatory practices perpetuating health and social inequalities. discourse draws heavily on universalising myths that seek to value donation as a social and public good, and ties donation to citizenship and social solidarity. it also assumes that bioavailability has equalising effects whereby all donations are equally valued, despite evidence to the contrary. risk assessment has been viewed as the domain of scientific experts and risk management as a matter for political leadership. but the role of science and politics in risk governance has been debated. concerns must be managed in the context of interconnectedness in relation to collection and supply. this shifts over time and space in the face of emerging risks to blood safety. also in relation to changing market demands for blood components and plasma products. plasma obtained from male whole blood donors may be used to produce fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for transfusion in adults but no British plasma is used to manufacture plasma products. the principle of national self-sufficiency in blood supply and plasma products has been considered an important way of maximising blood safety. the principle of national self-sufficiency in blood supply and plasma products is considered an important way of maximising blood safety. transfusion science and blood policies construct moral hierarchies and scales of exchange and use value which have excluded MSM and migrants as donors. blood may be seen both as self and as alienable and rendered \u2018non-self\u2019 following manipulation and transfusion. eight out of nine male blood donors used some version of this model to understand what they were doing when they gave blood. female donors were more inclined to think of their blood as forming a relationship with the recipient, either as a kind of loan or as a shared substance. the maternal body represents a threat to blood and plasma product safety. plasma products industry has traditionally relied on the socio-economically disadvantaged or marginalised to provide plasma on a regular basis in return for cash. industry has shown a long standing preference for male plasma, targeting prisoners, inmates in mental institutions and gay men for antibodies needed to manufacture particular products. there are industry standards which apply to procurement, processing and manufacturing of plasma which are intended to reduce the risk of transmissible infections and viral disease. women are recruited as whole blood donors, but their donations have different exchange value to those of men. from 2003 all the UK blood services introduced a policy of \u2018male donor preference\u2019, which involved women\u2019s plasma being discarded following whole blood collection. in 1999, SHOT introduced a set of four categories of TRALI cases. a high proportion of reported TRALI cases are categorised as possible or unlikely to be TRALI. the association with HLA antibody-positive female donors led to this new policy. since 2010, 100 percent of FFP has been produced from recovered male plasma. at its largest national blood processing centre, female plasma is redirected to the \u2018discard\u2019 section to be sent for incineration. risk factors are associated, not with reproductive history per se, but with reproductive potential, materialising female bodies as inherently \u2018risky\u2019 sources of plasma. staff at the processing centre we visited referred to the'superior' qualities of male plasma and men who donate. change in policy appeared to raise no political concerns and received no public attention. strategies to prevent TRALI have been implemented in different ways in other countries, based on differing interpretations of the evidence of the link with female donor plasma. in the u.s., a combination of preference for male plasma transfusion and high-volume plasma components has been thought to improve transfusion outcomes. women are neither routinely screened nor tested for their antibody status. this contrasts with other western countries which use a different approach. women are not routinely screened or tested for their antibody status. anti-D Ig can be administered prophylactically antenatally or postnatally or following any sensitising event which may have caused fetal maternal haemorrhage. the mechanism of this passive immunisation is poorly understood and the efficacy of different treatments has not been well studied. cases involving women blood donors who were HCV-positive emerged. positive action successfully lobbied the government for a comprehensive health care package. a tribunal of inquiry found there had been a clear contravention of policy guidelines in relation to how blood was collected as source material for anti-D Ig. administration of anti-D Ig has become a target for training of midwives. there are no direct health benefits to women from routine administration of anti-D Ig. current guidelines recommend that all women who carry a RhD negative fetus receive this product unnecessarily. the technology to produce monoclonal (synthetic) anti-D Ig has been developed, but is not currently commercially viable. the technology is embedded within a gendered blood economy where male bodies are sourced for plasma and plasma proteins and the production of commercially available Anti-D Ig. erism refers to the mixing of cells from the maternal and fetal body. previously thought to be pathological, fetal cells entering the maternal circulation have more recently been considered normal. biology has intrinsically been a branch of political discourse. commercial production of anti-D Ig by injecting male RhD negative plasma donors\u2019 with RhD positive cells to produce antibodies is an accepted and valued practice. this in turn raises questions about the ethics of donation \u2013 the information given to women about becoming blood donors. women are often unaware they may not need anti-D Ig if they are carrying an RhD negative fetus. gender difference is produced within the industry and blood services."}
