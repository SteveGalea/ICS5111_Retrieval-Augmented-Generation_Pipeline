{"summary": "the ferret (Mustela putorius furo) represents an attractive animal model for the study of respiratory diseases, including influenza. despite its importance for biomedical research, the number of reagents for molecular and immunological analysis is restricted. the ferret represents an inexpensive small, non-rodent animal model. the lack of reagents for molecular analysis of the mechanisms involved in infection and immunogenic protection is restricted, limiting the usefulness of this animal model. new advances in DNA sequencing have drastically increased sequencing throughput relative to traditional Sanger based approaches [10-12] cDNA pooled total RNA from blood, liver, lung, spleen and brain. this RNA pool was reverse-transcribed to cDNA that was normalized prior to sequencing to avoid sequencing of abundantly expressed genes. the sequence reads were then assembled and annotated using a newly-developed annotation pipeline. 10710 contigs with sequence length larger than 100 bp and an e-value smaller than 10-5 were selected to be included on the ferret-specific microarray. the Ferret_seq2 cDNAs represent 4872 additional orthologous gene fragments not included in the Ferret_seq1 data set as well as 2374 hits to chromosomal regions. d by three contigs (green), 4.5% of four contigs (purple), 3% by five contigs (turquoise), 2% by six contigs (light blue) and 1% were covered by eight contigs. the genes covered by nine or more contigs represent approximately 2% when added together. hybridization of globin clear treated RNA increased the number of microarray probes with a normalized log2-transformed signal above 3 to 22112 probes versus 21438 for the non-treated RNA. the array was designed using the e-array portal hosted by Agilent for array design https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/. microarray analysis and TaqMan development RNA from brain, liver, lung, spleen and blood were analyzed on the array. Biological replicates were analyzed as follows: five for liver and brain tissues, four for lung tissue, and three for blood and spleen tissues. technical replicates were analyzed for samples from the lung, the liver and the brain. the one-way ANOVA test isolated 8783 probes with significantly different expression profile between the five analyzed tissues. the probes were further analyzed using the Pavlidis Template Matching pattern recognition algorithm to isolate transcripts only expressed by one of the five tissue groups. the expression profile of a selection of these genes was further verified by TaqMan analysis. more than 400 transcripts were significantly different despite being classified as housekeeping genes. the remaining transcripts were clustered using K-means clustering to distinguish between the genes that varied within each group from those that were truly non-variable between the groups. qMan probes enabling multiplex analysis, allowing simultaneous analysis of tissue specific transcripts and housekeeping genes in a single reaction. the genes encoding apolipoprotein H (Apo-H, liver), albumin (Alb, liver), pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc, lung), Claudin-18 (Cldn18, lung), Glycine receptor subunit beta (Glrb, brain), Synaptotagmin-1 (S 1 and Atf4 is approximately 1.5 when measured by the array and 0.5 when confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. these genes were the 60S ribosomal proteins L32 and L34 (Rpl32 and Rpl34) and the Sin3A-associated protein, 18 kDa (Sap18) as with the array analysis, the C(t) values across the tissues were more variable than the 41 selected by the ANOVA/K-means clustering analysis. ferret_seq2 cDNAs represent 4872 additional orthologous gene fragments not included in the Ferret_seq1 data set. the cDNAs represent 4872 additional orthologous gene fragments not included in the Ferret_seq1 data set as well as 2374 hits to chromosomal regions. panel B shows the biological process distribution as per GO ontology analysis of the annotated contigs. the annotated transcripts were also classified according to the three major functional standard Gene Ontology categories. the most frequent biological processes are shown in figure 1b, and involve nucleic acid metabolic processes, metabolic processes and regulation of biological processes. hybridization of globin clear treated RNA increased the number of microarray probes with a normalized log2-transformed signal above 3 to 22112 probes versus 21438 for the non-treated RNA. the array was designed utilizing the e-array portal hosted by Agilent for array design https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/. liver, lung, spleen and blood were analyzed on the array [GEO omnibus acc. GSE19398] Biological replicates were analyzed as follows: five for liver and brain tissues, four for lung tissue, and three for blood and spleen tissues. technical replicates were analyzed for samples from the lung, the liver and the brain. isolated 8783 probes with significantly different expression profile between the five analyzed tissues. these probes were further analyzed using the Pavlidis Template Matching (PTM) pattern recognition algorithm to isolate transcripts only expressed by one of the five tissue groups. more than 400 transcripts were significantly different. the remaining transcripts were clustered using K-means clustering to distinguish between the genes that varied within each group from those that were truly non-variable between the groups. the latter indicate suitable housekeeping genes. panel A: Hierarchical clustering analysis showing a set of possible housekeeping genes. protein H (Apo-H, liver), albumin (Alb, liver), pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc, lung), Claudin-18 (Cldn18, lung), Glycine receptor subunit beta (Glrb, brain), Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1, brain), ataxin 2-binding protein 1 (Fox1, brain), non-POU domain containing, octamer-binding protein (Non ferret animal model is highly adapted for studies of influenza virus infection. ferrets can be infected by human isolates of influenza virus. ferrets share the same molecular structure of sialic acid residues. this enables the influenza virus to use the same host cell entry mechanism. the genome sequencing project is ongoing and has made several thousand partially sequenced clones available in the HTGS database. the goal for the present study was to use these advances to increase the available transcribed sequences for the ferret and to develop a ferret microarray platform as well as assays for quantitative real time PCR. the tissue-specific expression profiles were compared to the gene expression of the same genes from mouse and human. common expression profiles suggest that the annotation of the ferret transcripts on the array is accurate. the majority of the analyzed genes showed similar transcription profiles for the ferret genes and the human or murine transcripts. ferret animal model is highly adapted for studies of influenza virus infection. ferrets can be infected by human isolates of influenza virus. mice, for example, require adapted strains. ferrets share the same molecular structure of sialic acid residues. analysis of global transcriptional changes using microarrays has improved our knowledge about virus-host interactions as well as mechanisms by which vaccines induce protection. functional genomic analyses provide valuable knowledge about components of hosts' innate immune responses to pathogens. systemic approaches like these can identify innate immune signatures. common expression profiles suggest that the annotation of the ferret transcripts on the array is accurate. the microarray data were used to identify genes evenly expressed throughout the analyzed tissues. none of the most commonly used housekeeping genes were in this list. ferret lung, liver, brain, and spleen tissue were taken and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene blood RNA extraction kit. cDNA was synthesized from a pool made from equal amounts of total RNA. cDNA was amplified by PCR using a proof-reading enzyme. normalization was done by one cycle of denaturation and re-association of the cDNA. cDNA was separated from the remaining single stranded, normalized cDNA by passing the mixture over a hydroxylapatite column. cDNA ranging from 450 to 650 base pairs were excised from the gel. the results from BLAST searches for each of these databases were parsed, stored and integrated in a relational database using different e-value cut-offs. the summary of the results was reported for each reference database using either validated genes or putative functions for predicted genes. using globin reduction methods can increase the sensitivity of whole blood-derived RNA. five micrograms of globin-reduced RNA were then hybridized with 1 l of the human Capture Oligo mix or 1 l of the human Capture Oligo mix and 400 ng (1 l) of the ferret antisence oligo mix. the remaining procedure was carried out as specified by the manufacturer. the arrays were then washed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) each slide was scanned at 5 m resolution with two different PMT gain settings (450 and 480 V) the image files were then opened in Agilent's Feature Extraction software using the default Gene Expression protocol. the housekeeping genes were selected using a gene list derived from Eisenberg and Levanon. from the gene list we selected genes not significantly changed between the tissue groups. to sort out genes with large intra tissue variability we subjected the non-significant hits to K-means clustering and then manually selected the clusters with no or limited variability between the tissues. RNA preparation, library preparation and sequencing Four six-months-old healthy ferrets were anesthetized using a mix of ketamine, xylazine and atropine prior to the final blood draw and euthanasia. total RNA was isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from a pool made from equal amounts of total RNA using a random primer followed by ligation of the 454 adapters A and B to the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA. cDNA was then amplified by PCR using a proof-reading enzyme and assayed on a 1.5% agarose gel. assembly and annotation We implemented an annotation analysis system with five major components: (1) ESTs assembly system; (2) contig processing; (3) sequence homology analysis; (4) sequence annotation and (5) an object-relational storage and reporting tool. the resulting contigs were annotated by using a sequence homology analysis pipeline including blastx and blastn algorithms and local copies of protein and nucleic acid sequences. antisense oligos were diluted in nuclease-free water and pooled at a concentration of 400 ng/l. five micrograms of globin-reduced RNA were then used for cRNA synthesis using the MessageAmp kit. microarray analysis Five hundred nanograms of high-quality total RNA was labeled according to the one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis protocol supplied by the manufacturer. samples with a cRNA synthesis yield below 1.65 g and a specific activity less than 9.0 pmol Cy3 per g cRNA were repeated. labeled cRNA (1.65 g) was then fragmented and mixed with the HI-RPM hybridization buffer and hybridized for the normalized and scaled data was log2 transformed and imported in to the TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV) the statistical analysis of the microarray data was done in MeV. the clustering analysis was done including all intensity values for all samples. analysis was carried out in an Eppendorf realPlex4S machine at 60\u00b0C annealing temperature. probes were labeled on the 5' end with either the FAM or HEX fluorophores. RT and AB were involved in extraction and preparation of samples for sequencing and microarray analysis. globin mRNA band is most pronounced (85%) in the blood sample. the authors would like to thank the animal operations team at Southern research for excellent technical assistance. we thank Dr Vladimir Yamshchikov at Department of Genetics at the University of Alabama for careful revision of the manuscript."}
