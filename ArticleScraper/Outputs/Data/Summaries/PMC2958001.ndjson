{"summary": "the survey was conducted to provide information with regard to the public\u2019s reaction to the possible use of social distancing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions during a severe outbreak of pandemic influenza. the target population was adults >18 years of age, who lived in the united states. 101 employed respondents, 2006 Harvard School of Public Health Pandemic Influenza Survey*. respondents were asked a series of questions to assess real or perceived constraints with regard to their ability to comply with pandemic influenza mitigation strategies. responses % Yes % No % Don\u2019t know Outcome variables representing ability to comply with pandemic influenza mitigation recommendations If you were asked to stay home for 7\u201310 days, would you or someone in your household lose your job or business. sociodemographic and personal characteristics assessed were education, race/ethnicity, age, sex, self-reported health status, and self-reported knowledge of pandemic influenza. each outcome used 1 full model; all models controlled simultaneously for all key predictors as well as covariates. survey questions assessed willingness and ability to comply with public health recommendations in 3 domains: home, school, and work. target population was adults >18 years of age, who lived in the united states. indicators of ability to comply Employed respondents were asked a series of questions to assess real or perceived constraints with regard to their ability to comply with pandemic influenza mitigation strategies. the four dependent variables were positive responses to the following statements: \"I would have serious financial problems if I stayed away from work for 7\u201310 days, 1 month, or 3 months\" 1,073 28 71 1 Would it become a serious financial problem if you stayed out of work for 1 month\" 464 45 51 4 Key predictor variables representing employment-related constraints on compliance Unable to work from home for 1 month in the event of a serious outbreak 1,073 69 29 2 Would not be paid if kept from work because of a serious outbreak 1,073 69 29 2. Statistical Analysis Structured analytical approaches have improved predictions of behavior in emergency situations, modeling the joint effects of several factors on planned behavior (3). each outcome used 1 full model;
