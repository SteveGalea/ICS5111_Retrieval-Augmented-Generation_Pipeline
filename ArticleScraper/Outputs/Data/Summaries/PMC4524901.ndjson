{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a common type of viral enteritis in pigs that is caused by PED virus (PEDV) pigs can infect pigs of any age, from neonates to sows or boars. the severity of PED in neonatal pigs differs according to age. in the 1970s and 1980s, the number of PED outbreaks decreased markedly in the region. only a few severe outbreaks have been reported since the 1980s in Europe. however, the number of PED outbreaks decreased markedly in the region. this review covers the vaccine, epidemiology, genetic structure, and characteristics of PED/PEDV after 2013. this report may improve our understanding of this disease, which is currently the most fatal in pigs and one of the most costly health issues in animals. the S protein is responsible for the interaction with host cellular receptor molecules [18,19] of the PEDV proteins, the S protein is considered the most antigenic. this gene may affect the pathogenicity of novel PED outbreaks based on variations in the S gene. this variant PEDV exhibited 93% similarity with the CV777 prototype strain in the S gene. the PEDV isolated after the US outbreak also exhibited 89%-92% similarity with the S protein of CV777. similarities in the S gene could be important in vaccine efficacy and development strategies. in most strains, amino acid 549 is changed to arginine (R) most strains exhibit a change from G to S at amino acid position 594, similar to current strains [22]. a strain with deletion of the S gene was detected and isolated in Ohio. this strain exhibited patterns that were different from those of the Korean strain with the S gene deletion. in the united states, a deletion in the S gene was also reported after the united states outbreak. 27 out of 219 fecal samples from diarrheic piglets (21 days old) were positive for PEDV. some PEDV-positive farms (35 out of 476) were detected between mid-2006 and the end of 2007. the disease progressively disappeared [39]. in late 2013, PEDV outbreaks were reported in south Korea and Taiwan [12,50,51]. PEDV was first identified within the united states in Iowa in may 2013. testing of historical samples showed that PEDV occurred the month before in Ohio. PEDV rapidly spread across the country and was confirmed on farms from 32 states. in the last decade, PEDV outbreaks have been reported in several Asian countries, including Thailand [41,42,43,44], Taiwan [12], the Philippines [45], south Korea [46], and the southern provinces of Vietnam [47]. PEDV is now circulating in at least 29 Chinese provinces [49] the commercial dual priming oligonucleotide system (seegene, Seoul, Korea) has been developed for the rapid differential detection of PEDV. a polyclonal antibody is produced by immunizing rabbits with purified PEDV M gene after its expression in Escherichia coli. immunochromatographic assay kits can be used at farms in order to detect the N (nucleocapsid) protein of PEDV with 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity. this technique is less sensitive than RT-PCR, but allows for diagnosis within 10 minutes. enteropathogenic viruses can be divided into two types (type I and II) according to their infection site in the intestine [66]. Viruses infecting villous enterocytes, including TGEV, PEDV, and RV, can be suppressed by local gut-associated immunity. in nave swine herds, PED is characterized by vomiting and acute diarrhea and results in high mortality rates in piglets less than 2 weeks of age. oral inoculation of seronegative sows with live virulent TGEV results in high rates of protection in piglets. passive protection is associated with high titers of secretory IgA (sIgA) in colostrum and milk. several highly attenuated oral TGEV vaccines induce poor milk sIgA titers compared with virulent TGEV in sows. there is a potential risk of transmission of the contaminated viral or bacterial agents in the inoculum. PEDV may spread rapidly in pigs of all ages in the index farms. the severity of the disease may vary with unknown factors. despite the reduction in mortality rates in piglets delivered from orally vaccinated sows, there was no shortening of the duration of virus shedding. passive immunity by vaccination with the highly attenuated PEDV strain DR13 does not prevent virus shedding after challenge. at low doses of the attenuated PEDV, 25% of pigs are protected against PEDV challenge. many groups have debated the appropriate standards for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines after official challenge tests using currently available PEDV vaccines in south Korea in 2014. simple criteria, such as serum neutralizing antibodies, severity of diarrhea, and mortality after virulent challenge, are insufficient for the accurate and optimal evaluation. PEDV research has become a hot topic in veterinary virology since the US outbreak in 2013. veterinary scientists are striving to breakthroughs to combat current PED outbreaks worldwide."}
