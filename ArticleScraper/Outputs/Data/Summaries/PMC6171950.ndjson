{"summary": "coVs are large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause acute and prolonged infections in a variety of mammals and birds. pathogenic human CoVs include members of the genus Alphacoronavirus, termed human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and HCoV-229E, as well as members of the genus Betacoronavirus. SARS-CoV has become a paradigmatic subject to study pre-pandemic processes. there is an increasing interest to understand functional differences in the relative ways in which viruses deal with host cell defenses across different host species. the type I interferon response is an effective antiviral barrier that may limit zoonotic cross-host infection in general terms. coronavirus PLP proteins encode a catalytic triad domain that catalyzes site-specific peptide cleavage of the viral polyprotein. PLP protease activity catalyzes the processing of the replicase polyprotein at cleavage sites between nsp1/nsp2, nsp2/nsp3, and nsp3/nsp4. the protease recognition sequence LXGG is common to cleavage sites in the viral protein as well as ubiquitin and its derivatives. the protease recognition sequence LXGG is common to cleavage sites in the viral protein as well as ubiquitin and its derivatives. direct studies of PLP functions of reservoir-borne viruses are therefore therefore conserved. functional studies have to take the whole viral replication cycle into account. to date, the DUB functions of SARS-CoV PLP have not been studied in the context of a replicating virus. no studies have so far compared PLP functions between members of one same viral species including natural variants existing in the zoonotic reservoir. Phylogeny of beta-CoVs in the PLP gene (981 bp fragment) within the nonstructural protein 3. Symbols correspond to the respective host species (human, civet and bat) the SO-CoV derived PLP (SO-PLP) was included as an outlier PLP. yellow boxes indicate conserved residues in only two sequences. ubiquitin-binding methionine at amino acid position 209 is marked in blue. the PLP core domains in SA-PLP and SR-PLP comprise 315 amino acids. SO-PLP share 39% (125/324 positions including insertions/deletions) and 36% (118/324 positions including insertions/deletions) identical amino acids with SA- and SR-PLP respectively. protease activities were assessed by a trans-cleavage assay [49]. the assay was based on coexpression of a SARS-CoV nsp2/3-GFP substrate with the respective PLPs, testing the cleavage of substrate into truncated products nsp2 and nsp3-GFP. codon-optimized constructs were therefore generated. HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector plasmid (EV) or plasmids expressing either wild type (WT)- or catalytic mutant (CA) PLPs. SARS-CoV nsp2/3-GFP was cotransfected simultaneously. K-293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either WT- or CA-PLPs. plasmids (50 ng, 100 ng and 200 ng per 12-well) were transfected for comparison. HA-ubiquitin (HA-ub) was coexpressed in all samples. a small molecule competitive inhibitor known to be specific for the PLP catalytic site, named 3e [51], was tested side-by-side on the PLPs. the inhibitor was slightly more efficient for SA-PLP (EC50 = 26.20 M) than for SR-PLP (EC50 = 30.28 M) the inhibitor had very low efficiency towards SO-PLP, whose inhibitor-binding site has only 46% amino acid identity. differential efficiency towards a PLP inhibitor hint at structural differences even between PLPs from conspecific viruses that occur in zoonotic reservoirs. failure of the inhibitor was only seen with SO-PLP that falls outside limits of current CoV species classification. a chimeric rSCV containing SR-PLP (SR-PLP-rSCV) was generated by reverse genetics to investigate SR-PLP functions in the context of a replicating virus. cells were infected with either rSCV or SR-PLP-rSCV (MOI 0.0001) and overlaid with a highly viscous medium. the 50% effective concentrations were rSCV: IC50 = 2.36 M and SR-PLP-rSCV: IC50 = 11.02 M. growth curve experiments were done for both viruses in vero cells. both viruses grew to the same titers at all tested time points. infectious particle production of rSCV and SR-PLP-rSCV was compared using SPSS Version 23.0.0.0 and a general linear regression model. growth of both viruses did not significantly differ in Vero cells (p = 0.929 and R-square = 0.670) in MA-104 cells growth of the viruses significantly differed (p = 0.038 and R-square = 0.612) helial cells (HAE) were infected with rSCV and SR-PLP-rSCV. at 0, 48, 72 and 96 hpi samples were taken and viral replication was determined by a plaque titration assay. multistep growth curve experiments were conducted in human airway epithelial cells. a significantly reduced growth was detected for SR-PLP-rSCV compared to rSCV at 96 hpi (10.3 fold; p = 0.006 in a two-sided t test) the anti-IFN activity of SR-PLP may be decreased in type I IFN competent cells. a sensitive assay for IRF-3 nuclear translocation was established. SA- and SO-PLP CA-mutants were strongly reduced, but still detectable at significant levels. SR-PLP CA-mutant had lost its ability to block IRF-3 nuclear translocation (94% of cells with nuclear IRF-3/GFP signal) primate cells were transfected with plasmids expressing 1 g of WT- or CA-PLPs. 50 ng/24-well of EV were transfected and samples were applied as induction controls. expression of the PLPs was confirmed by Western blotting. expression of the PLPs was confirmed by Western blotting. the differential capabilities of SA-PLP, SR-PLP and SO-PLP may be attributable to protease-dependent cleavage. SR-PLP may have to rely on protease-dependent cleavage. SA-PLP and SO-PLP may provide additional IFN-antagonistic activity. hek-293T cells were transfected with HA-ub and 200 ng of plasmids expressing either SA-PLP, the SA-PLP mutant M209R or the respective CA-mutants. a trans-cleavage assay was conducted in HEK-293T cells to determine the catalytic activity of SA-PLP. kinetics, cells were infected with rSCV or rSCV-PLP/M209R at an MOI of 0.01. each experiment was performed in triplicate. the mean fold change in IFN- expression was calculated using TATA-binding protein (TBP) expression as a reference gene and the 2Ct analysis method [55]. the experiment was done in quadruplicates using a two-sided t test. the destabilizing mutation in the ubiquitin-binding domain caused increased IFN sensitivity. rSCV-PLP/M209R-infected Calu-3 cells were infected with both viruses with an MOI of 1 for 24 h and 2.8 fold at 48 hpi. rSCV-PLP/M209R-infected cells had a more pronounced IFN- mRNA expression level compared to rSCV. the type I IFN-inducing RVFV Cl 13 was included as an IFN- mRNA expression control showing that the cells had a fully functional IFN response. the phenotypic similarity between SR-PLP-rSCV and rSCV-PLP/M209R suggests that SR-PLP-rSCV grew less efficiently in IFN-competent, bat-derived lung cells. rSCV, SR-PLP-rSCV or SR-PLP-rSCV grew less efficiently. a quantitative real-time-PCR assay specific for the Rhinolophus IFN- gene was established. to determine the specific IFN- mRNA expression levels, rSCV, SR-PLP-rSCV and RVFV Cl 13 were infected with rSCV. in SR-PLP the aspartic acids (D1826) are replaced by an asparagine (N) this alternative type of catalytic domain was previously described for other cysteine proteases. other essential feature of SA-PLP is the zinc-binding domain, comprised of four cysteine residues. truncated nsp3-GFP product was detected by Western blot using anti-GFP epitope tag antibodies with all PLPs. the catalytic cysteines of each PLP (C1651) were changed to alanines. for SA-PLP this mutation was previously shown to abolish PLP activity. hek-293T cells were transfected with either WT- or CA-PLPs. plasmids were transfected in increasing amounts of plasmids expressing either WT- or CA-PLPs. at 14 hpi, cells were incubated with a protease inhibitor. c and the conjugation machinery (UbcH8, Ube1L, and Herc5) were coexpressed in all samples. a time-course experiment confirmed that all PLPs had similar protease activities ranging between 1- to 6-fold within 2 to 6 h when compared to CA-mutants corresponding to each PLP. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with increasing doses of plasmids encoding each PLP along with constant doses of plasmids encoding ubiquitin. each PLP deconjugated ubiquitin in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that the PLPs have comparable DUB efficiencies. a chimeric rSCV containing SR-PLP was generated by reverse genetics to investigate SR-PLP functions in the context of a replicating virus. a chimeric rSCV containing SR-PLP (SR-PLP-rSCV) was generated by reverse genetics to investigate SR-PLP functions in the context of a replicating virus. cells were infected with either rSCV or SR-PLP-rSCV (MOI 0.0001) and treated with the SA-PLP protease inhibitor 3e (24-well format) cells were washed twice with PBS and either DMSO (0 M) or in DMEM serially diluted compound 3e (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 M) was added. SR-PLP-rSCV grew to significantly lower titers than rSCV. reduced growth of SR-PLP-rSCV in MA-104 cells may indicate a less efficient viral counteraction against type I IFN. supernatants were taken at 24 hpi, and viral replication was determined by a plaque titration assay. the experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. d-f was determined using a two-sided t test. SR-PLP-rSCV grew to significantly lower titers than rSCV. a 1.5-fold increased detection of IFN- mRNA expression levels in SR-PLP-rSCV- compared to rSCV-infected Calu-3 cells. nuclear translocation of an overexpressed IRF-3/GFP fusion protein was stimulated by superinfection with rift Valley fever virus clone 13 (RVFV Cl 13), an RVFV-mutant devoid of the IFN induction antagonist NSs. the proportion of cells with nuclear translocation of GFP signal was counted microscopically. EV was coexpressed in each sample. at 24 hpi, cells were infected with IFN-inducing, recombinant clone 13 (RVFV Cl 13) at an MOI of 5. the ability to block IFN promoter activation was determined using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett-T3 post hoc test. all PLPs efficiently blocked IFN- promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner. differences were observed with CA-mutants. the ubiquitin-binding residue M209 of SA-PLP interacts directly with a binding patch comprised of I44, V70, L8, R167 and D168 of ubiquitin. in the MERS-CoV PLP, replacement of methionine at a corresponding position by the bulkier arginine residue was found to prevent the interaction. hek-293T cells were transfected with HA-ub and 200 ng of plasmids expressing either SA-PLP, the SA-PLP mutant M209R or the respective CA-mutants. gene expression was analyzed by Western blotting. cells were treated with 100 IU/ml of recombinant pan-species IFN-. at 16 h post treatment, cells were infected with rSCV or rSCV-PLP/M209R (MOI 0.01) for 24 h. the experiment was performed in triplicate. the reduced ubiquitin-binding efficiency should result in a decreased IFN-antagonistic activity of M209R PLP. both, the M209R and the corresponding M209R CA mutant, had less anti-IFN activity compared to SA-PLP. the combination of M209R and CA resulted in the complete depletion of significant anti-IFN activity. multistep virus growth kinetics were done in the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3. rSCV-PLP/M209R-infected cells had a more pronounced IFN- mRNA expression level compared to rSCV-PLP/M209R. differential IFN counteraction in cells of the species SARS-CoV are conserved in mammalian species. SR-PLP-rSCV grew less efficiently in IFN-competent primate cells. yone lung cells expressed the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 were infected with rSCV, SR-PLP-rSCV or IFN-inducing RVFV Cl 13 (control of IFN- mRNA expression) at an MOI of 0.1. SR-PLP-rSCV infection led to significantly higher IFN- expression levels. spike protein may not sufficiently represent variability of virulence traits in reservoir. spike protein may not sufficiently represent variability of virulence traits in reservoir. growth properties of the chimeric virus in IFN-deficient Vero cells confirmed that the reservoir-derived PLP effectively cleaved the viral polyprotein. only when grown in cells with a fully active IFN system, wild type SARS-CoV replicated better than the PLP-chimeric virus. a definite link to IFN antagonism was established by engineering of a destabilizing mutation into the ubiquitin-binding surface in an EAV infectious clone. the choice of the mutation was informed by another study that defined the primary ubiquitin-binding surface in SARS-CoV PLP. we found no signs of catalytic inactivation of the M209 mutant in Vero cells where it replicates like wild type virus. sp16 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase domain replicated like wild type in vero cells. when engineered in a mouse-adapted backbone, the mutant was cleared faster from the lungs of infected mice. sp16 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase domain caused about 10-fold lower replication in an IFN-competent human airway epithelial cell line. the structure of the second binding site (Ub2) seems to be more critical for K48-linked di-ubiquitin-binding than the primary binding surface (38, 60) the SARS-CoV strains found in reservoirs in china and Europe show several variants at both ubiquitin-binding sites that could be studied for effects on replication level. the tertiary structure of SA-PLP is shown in dark blue. the SR-PLP tertiary structure is shown in light blue. silico modeling of the ubiquitin-binding sites shows that sequence variations may even cause structural changes in- and adjacent to the binding sites. all fecal samples were collected non-invasively by trained field biologists. bats produced fecal pellets that were collected and transferred into RNAlater RNA stabilization solution (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) permission was obtained from the Wildlife Division of the Ministry of Lands, Forestry, and Mines in Ghana. treptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% L-glutamine and 1% sodium pyruvate were generated and maintained as previously described. rSCV Cl 13 was a kind gift from Friedemann Weber (University of Gie\u00dfen) pcDNA3-Ube1L, pcDNA3-UbcH8 and pcDNA3-Herc5 were kind gifts from Robert M.
