{"summary": "recent outbreaks of communicable diseases in human populations have triggered a series of studies addressing the spread of directly transmissible infections at a country level. spatial models and microsimulations can quantify the possible role of border control, quarantine or transport reductions in curtailing local and international spread. in human diseases, spatial models and microsimulations can quantify the possible role of border control, quarantine or transport reductions in curtailing local and international spread. measles is a childhood disease and so the spatial dependencies of the host are different than for infections that affect both adults and children. measles is a childhood disease, and so the spatial dependencies of the host are different than for infections that affect both adults and children, such as pandemic influenza. the 1918 pandemic constitutes a rare example of a well-documented epidemic in a largely susceptible human population. we examine the effect of city-specific characteristics on the pattern of spread seen. we also investigate the impact of the distribution of cities in each country. a third wave of influenza occurred in early 1919 although with greater heterogeneity in mortality rates between cities. the third wave was less pronounced in US cities than in England and Wales. the second wave occurred in all cities (unlike wave 3) and because recording of mortality had begun in all cities before its arrival. we define the infection week of city i, ti, to be the first that meets a set of conditions on mortality in weeks ti + 1, ti + 2 and ti + 3. a week could be designated the infection week if either (or both) of two sets of criteria were met for mortality in the following weeks. distance dij is an estimated parameter relating the infectivity of a city at time ti to its mortality rate. a value of = 0 gives a flat infectiousness profile, independent of the death rate in the source city. is a time-invariant estimated infectivity term. parameter describes the strength of connection of a susceptible city to all possible infectors. = 0 gives the density-dependent model and = 1 gives the density independent model. model is used to generate epidemic trees [42,43]. the most likely tree for each parameter set is generated by calculating which \u2018infector\u2019 city has the highest probability of infecting each \u2018infectee\u2019 city. we use 1000 parameter sets sampled from the joint posterior distribution. the spring wave gave immunological protection against the autumn wave at a population level [25,26] by September 1918, the pandemic was a prominent global phenomenon. in both the UK and the US, a third wave of influenza occurred in early 1919 although with greater heterogeneity in mortality rates. a US city dataset is compiled from five publications reporting the Weekly Health Index. it covers the period 14 September 1918 to 15 March 1919 and contains weekly pneumonia and influenza death counts for 47 cities in the US. the data therefore covers a period of two waves, with not all cities experiencing the later wave. each city, i, has an infection time ti, an invariant population size Pi and a time-varying mortality rate, ri,t at time t. each week, each city can be in one of the disease states: Susceptible, Latent or Infectious. a value of = 0 gives a flat infectiousness profile, independent of the death rate in the source city. estimates allow us to assess whether mortality rate is a good proxy for infectiousness in an infected city. the model is used to generate epidemic trees [42,43]. the most likely tree for each parameter set is generated by calculating which \u2018infector\u2019 city has the highest probability of infecting each \u2018infectee\u2019 city. we use 1000 parameter sets sampled from the joint posterior distribution. DIC and parameter estimates for the distance-only model are given in column 1 of tables 1 and 2. DIC and parameter estimates for the distance-only model are given in column 1 of tables 1 and 2. distance-only model density-dependent population model estimated density dependence population model density-dependent population model with infectivity distance-only with infectivity DIC 114.5 115.3 119.1 117.2 114.8 114.8 (distance power) 0.79 (0.54, 1.01) 0.77 (0.52, 0.99) 1.04 (0.68, 1.41) 0.99 (0.65, 1.35) 0.85 (0.60, 1.10) 0.86 (0.61, 1.10) (susceptible population) in figure 2a, is estimated, whereas in b it is fixed at 1. See model components in the electronic supplementary material for further comparisons. blue models are population independent, green have a linear relationship with source and destination population size. red estimate the relationship between the population sizes of both source and destination cities and connectivity. the difference in DIC score between a constant infectivity model and one with a linear relationship between mortality and infectivity is negligible in either a distance-only model framework (columns 1 and 6) or a population-dependent framework (columns 2 and 5). the model is dependent on the destination population size, has estimated dependence of infectivity on mortality and an estimated intermediate degree of density dependence. a lower value was found for models in the us, where for the most parsimonious low DIC model (density dependent, population independent), was estimated as 0.79 (0.54, 1.00) the probability that the most likely infector was responsible for each infection falls as the epidemic progresses. cities infected early give rise to more infections than those infected late in the wave, as expected, but the range is large. in the distance-only constant infectivity model, some cities may give rise to a large number of new infections (e.g. Pittsburgh gives rise to nearly a quarter of infections) the effect of a city acting as a hub of infection is reduced in the more complex model, as the risk of infection from one city to another is reduced in the more complex model. a relatively good agreement between observed and simulated epidemic curves. the observed epidemic curve rises more steeply than the simulation curves in the early stages of the epidemic. this suggests that the model may underestimate the external infection pressure early in the wave. in the us the simulated curves for the distance-only constant infectivity model are shown in figure 5e and for the England and Wales parameters in figure 5f. the distance-only constant infectivity model gives peak incidence in the same week as observed. there is good correlation between the observed and simulated weeks of infection. population model estimated density dependence population model full model single-infected city parameter model DIC 880.4 863.6 844.5 846.3 846.4 841.9 (distance power) 0.90 (0.71, 1.07) 0.85 (0.66, 1.03) 1.14 (0.92, 1.34) 1.15 (0.93, 1.36) 1.18 (0.93, 1.40) 1.18 (0.96, 1.39) (susceptible population) 0.30 (0.15, 0.44) 0.36 (0. 0 0.85 (0.60, 1.10) 0.86 (0.61, 1.10) 0.11 (0.01, 0.35) 0.10 (0.004, 0.34) 0.08 (0.004, 0.27) 0 (infected population) 0 0.75 (0.03, 1.86) 0.28 (0.01, 0.91) 0.37 (0.02, 1.32) 1.13 (0.07, 2.09) 0 (spatial interaction) in each population context the variant that estimates the degree of density dependence gives a slightly better fit than models with no density dependence. the comparison also shows that the models which estimate the effect of origin and destination city population sizes on the connectivity of cities are much better than either the population-independent or linear population size-dependent models. the constant-infectivity and estimated-infectivity model variants are shown in columns 4 and 5 of table 1 using the density-dependent population-dependent framework. the estimated relationship includes two inputs from the infected city: the mortality rate and the population of the city. the power parameter on the destination city population,, was estimated at 0.40 (0.25, 0.54) in England and Wales. the credible intervals exclude 1, demonstrating that as population size increases, the susceptibility of the city increased more slowly. two models using the US data compare the most likely infection trees for the distance-only constant infectivity model. the nearest infected city is always the most likely infector. in the distance-only constant infectivity model, some cities may give rise to a large number of new infections. cities infected early in the epidemic (week 0\u20132) are shown in red, those infected in the middle (week 3) are in blue and cities infected late in the epidemic (weeks 4\u20137) are shown in green. the most likely tree for the US using 1000 parameter sets fitted to the England and Wales data. 245 of 246 cities lie within the 95 per cent interval of their expected distribution. there are no population size (p = 0.36) or density trends (p = 0.11) in these cities. all but three lie within the inter quartile interval. we removed all cities with fewer than 90 000 inhabitants in England and Wales. the best model by DIC comparison gave a distance-only interaction (no dependence on population size) with mortality in a density-independent framework. a model with intermediate levels of density dependence gives the best fit to the observed pattern. Xia et al. assumed a kernel power of 1, rather than fitting this parameter. it is not surprising that there is a disparity in the distance kernel in England and Wales and the US. in theory, this gives better resolution for estimating the kernel shape. our results using a subset of the England and Wales dataset suggest that the degree of density dependence is a difficult parameter to estimate when coverage is low. the low power on destination city size found in fitting the gravity model to the England and Wales dataset shows that connectivity of a city increases sub-linearly with population increase. the variation in the onset of infection may be due to the differing susceptibility of each city. however, the low case fatality of the first wave and age-specificity of infection between waves need to be understood before spatial heterogeneity in susceptibility can be discernible."}
