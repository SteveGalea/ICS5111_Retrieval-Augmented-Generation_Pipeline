{"summary": "a 'functional protein microarray' contains a set of proteins individually produced and positioned in an addressable format on a microarray surface. the first version of a proteome microarray was reported in 2001 and contained 5,800 yeast proteins with amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags printed on the array. the second type of protein microarray, the 'analytical protein microarray' or 'antibody microarray', shares similarities with immunoassays and uses antibodies to detect specific probes. a typical DNA microarray experiment measures signal ratios between two color channels, one for a tested mRNA sample and the other for a reference sample [15]. several scaling approaches in DNA microarrays are based on a set of 'housekeeping' genes that give constant signal intensities at different conditions. however, such a control group must be customized according to the type of activities that are assayed. cross-reactivities of protein microarrays can not be as directly corrected for. ProCAT contains a flexible modular design whose individual components can be adjusted according to the experimental designs and stringency level selected by the users. six modules for reduction of specific array artifacts plus a report annotation module are currently implemented in order. autophosphorylation experiment showed typical bleeding problems in positive control spots. signal for one spot is measured as foreground minus local background intensity. median of PKA signals is enhanced by 53% and variance among the PKA spots is decreased by 41%. all of the PKA spots autophosphorylated and showed strong signals. the median for PKA signal intensities was enhanced by 53%. the variance within them is decreased by 41%. protein microarray experiments in which proteins are randomly printed on the array. median and median absolute deviation are calculated to represent the signal distribution in the local window. to perform the normalization, the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) of all sliding windows are averaged. fusion proteins Sla2p and Myo4p at each concentration were printed at eight random positions on the array. other spots were occupied with bovine serum albumin as negative controls. a small window size diminishes any signal inequality that exists between positive signals and background noise. a small scaling window tends to introduce extreme changes to the original signals. the variance of the signals for the same protein after normalization with different window size was calculated. area under ROC curve (AUC) is a performance indicator that ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 for the best performing method. sensitivity and specificity for both local and global cutoff methods was estimated. five window sizes were tested and compared with the global cutoff. eles were probed on separate arrays using the same experimental conditions as wild-type kinases. eles that produce signals in the absence of active kinase were identified by ProCAT and removed from the target lists of kinase probings. probing with anti-epitope antibodies will provide an estimate of the relative protein amounts in each spot on the array. proCAT divides the raw signal intensities Si,j by the protein amount signals Ai,j. overpowering spots can also be biased if they have saturated signal intensities. ProCAT takes five minutes on average to complete all analysis modules for each array. the time may vary depending on the selected analysis modules and the size of the protein microarrays. in protein microarrays local background regions can be easily skewed by artifacts such as small speckles. strong positive signals from on-chip kinase assays tend to produce signal smears on both film and phosphoimagers that exceed the normal feature size. in both cases, the measurement for that spot will be inaccurate. the median background of the nine spots will be used as the 'neighborhood background' value for the central spot. no additional time is needed for further alignment, yet this method will significantly reduce artifacts that can produce erroneous measurements on spots background. spatial artifacts will cause inaccurate measurements of signal intensities. the signal of each spot can then be normalized according to its local controls. a scaling method that reduces signal variations among spots of the same proteins at different array locations decreases spatial artifacts. a test microarray was organized in the same format as the commercially available protein microarrays (Invitrogen) each protein was printed in duplicate. two GST-fusion proteins, Sla2p and Myo4p, were purified separately. five out of six controls showed a decrease of variances after normalization. we applied ProCAT to normalize the slide with several different parameters. five window sizes were tested, termed windows 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. a global cutoff can be calculated from all spots and applied to the whole slide. for each spot on the array the signal distribution within a nine by nine window was calculated and a cutoff defined as a number of standard deviations away from the mean. the default for ProCAT is two standard deviations. the local cutoff is significantly better in identifying positive spots than a global cutoff. the test slide has six unique positive controls (Sla2p and Myo4p in three different titrations) the performance of identifying positive controls is increased by using local cutoffs generated in relatively large surrounding windows. protein microarray experiments aim to identify the affinity of a binding interaction (in a protein-protein interaction assay) or the extent of phosphorylation (in a kinase assay) so that one can compare the relative strength of the reaction for each positive protein. a number of other factors contribute to the array signal intensities, including the systematic noise from various artifacts. ProCAT was designed as a flexible tool to analyze functional protein microarray data. the program was scripted in Perl (version 5.6.1) on top of a Tomcat web server. each module discussed above can be included or excluded depending on experimental designs. proCAT includes novel scaling methods that provide robust and reproducible measurement for quantitative signals. this is crucial for protein microarrays as chip signal intensities often indicate strength of interactions. each step has been integrated into a modular design to fit various experimental designs. this approach is based on the assumption that signal intensities across the slide share the same distribution. it holds true if and only if the regional variations observed on the slide are due to technical artifacts. the size of the neighborhood window can also largely affect the performance of the normalization. slide washed twice with 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS and 2 l 33P--ATP. slides were printed with Sla2p and Myo4p as positive controls. array surface was blocked using SuperBlock at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. a local window Wi,j around one spot (i, j) is defined as signals of a set of spots Si,j that satisfy: Wi,j(k) = Si',j' | max(1, i - k) i' min(N, i + k), max(1, j - k) j' min(M, j + k) Different windows can overlap with each other and go beyond the block edges. a spot (i, j) will be called positive only if its signal is above the threshold. the difference between Q1 and Q2 is termed interquartile range Q. a spot (i', j') is then defined as an outlier if its signal: S i \u2032, j \u2032 > Q2 + 1.5 Q or S i \u2032, j \u2032 Q1 \u2013 1.5 Q. 100 nM PKA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was spotted at 96 different places as positive control. slides were printed with Sla2p and Myo4p as positive controls. array surface was blocked using SuperBlock at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. the raw signal intensity Si,j = Fi,j - Bi,j is calculated as: Si,j = Fi,j. the neighborhood background B i, j is defined as: m e d i a n i 1 i \u2032 i + 1 j 1 j \u2032 j + 1 ( B i \u2032, j \u2032. i, j = m e d i a n s W i, j = m e d i a n s W i, j = m e d i a n s W i, j = m e d i a n s W i, j = m e d i a n s W i, j = m additional data files The following additional data files are available with the online version of this paper.
