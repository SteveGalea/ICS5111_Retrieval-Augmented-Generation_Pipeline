{"summary": "asthma and healthy control subjects were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between February 2012 and February 2013. the prevalence of viral infection triggering asthma exacerbation and its impact on the symptoms and duration of exacerbation are unclear. the average cost for a patient with an acute exacerbation is 3.5 times higher than that for a patient without one (2). viral respiratory tract infection is considered a very common trigger (3-5) viral respiratory tract infection is considered a very common trigger. a history of psychiatric disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse, or persistent use of 2 blockers; and (III) other disorders that can result in wheezing. age-matched volunteers recruited as members of our control group during same period (from February 2012 to February 2013) asthma symptom scores were assessed with an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) (13), an Asthma Control Test (ACT) (14), and a Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-AQLQ) (15). other symptoms, such as fever, headache, myalgia, pharyngalgia, nasal discharge, sneezing, cough, dyspnea, and night wakening, were also diagnosis of asthma was confirmed with a clinical profile and spirometry results according to the criteria described by the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (1). age-matched healthy volunteers, who had no respiratory symptoms within the previous 4 weeks, were also recruited as members of our control group during the same period (from February 2012 to February 2013). influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), human parainfluenza viruses (hPIVs), rhinoviruses (RV, including most serotypes of human rhinovirus groups A, B, and C), enterovirus (EV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronaviruses (hCoV-229E, OC43, statistical analyses were performed using an Statistical Product and Service Solutions package. the significance of changes in paired data was analyzed by paired t-tests. the viral-positive rate of samples from the exacerbation group was 34.2% (24/70), which is significantly higher than that for samples from the stable asthma group (12/65; 18.5%; P=0.038) or from the normal control group (18/134; 13.4%; P0.001). samples from six cases (8.5%) were positive for more than one virus. no human metapneumovirus or human bocavirus was detected in our samples. clinical characteristics of asthma exacerbation No significant differences were found between virus-positive and virus-negative subjects within the asthma exacerbation group (all P>0.05) the smoking rate was higher in the viral-positive subgroup (12%; 3/25) than in the viral-negative subgroup (0%; 0/45; P=0.042) ACQ, Asthma Control Questionnaire; ACT, Asthma Control Test; Mini-AQLQ, Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. no statistically significant differences were observed on any other days during the observation period. the lung function recovery after exacerbation of these subjects is shown in Table 4. there was no difference in the recovery of lung function between the viral-positive and viral-negative subgroups. 134 age-matched normal volunteers were recruited as controls. nasal swab samples were obtained for viral detection in the 65 stable asthma group patients and the 134 normal control group patients. there were no significant differences in the duration of asthma history, smoking status, or comorbidity of rhinitis between the stable and exacerbation groups (all P>0.05). the presence of respiratory viruses in the patient samples was detected by PCR (Table 2). the viral-positive rate of samples from the exacerbation group was 34.2% (24/70), which is significantly higher than that for samples from the stable asthma group (12/65; 18.5%; P=0.038) the viral load (number of viral copies) was significantly higher in the acute asthma exacerbation group [(5.004.63) 107 copies/L] than in the stable asthma group [(1.241.44) 106 copies/L; P0.001] or in the healthy control group [(1.440.44) 106 copies/L; P0.001]. there was not a significant difference between the viral loads of the stable asthma and healthy control groups (P=0.774) /45 0.042 Rhinitis (no. of cases) 11 21 0.830 ACT** 18.523.15 17.823.70 0.428 ACQ** 2.041.08 2.120.93 0.755 Mini-AQLQ** 4.910.92 4.860.86 0.833 Systemic symptom scores* 0 (0\u20136) 0 (0\u20133) 0.150 Upper airway symptom scores* 2 (0\u20134) 1 (0\u20136) 0.067 Lower airway symptom scores* 4 (2 the cough scores of patients with (A) virus-associated acute asthma exacerbation (virus AE) or (B) non-virus acute asthma exacerbation (non-virus AE) 34 (48.6%) completed a 4-week follow-up. the lung function recovery after exacerbation of these subjects is shown in Table 4. the positive rate of respiratory viral detection for our subjects was 34.2%. this is similar to previous reports in the literature (4). we used PCR for respiratory virus detection in this study. the most commonly detected viruses in our study were influenza A, influenza B, human parainfluenza virus, RSV, human coronavirus, and rhinovirus (4). it remains controversial whether positive PCR results always represent true respiratory viral infections. a study by Message et al. found that rhinovirus infection in an asthma patient increased asthma symptoms and airway eosinophil inflammation. however, there were no significant differences between the viral-positive and viral-negative asthma exacerbation subgroups in their overall asthma severity, CAT score, or respiratory symptoms at the first visit during acute exacerbation. patients infected with these viruses had more prominent and persistent cough symptoms. the potential effects of respiratory viral infection on severe asthma exacerbations and on asthma in children or elderly."}
