{"summary": "the rule is intended to apply to clinical situations, such as major trauma, cardiac arrest, or other incapacitating circumstances. the situation must be life-threatening, requiring an immediate intervention, and there must be no standard treatment that could be used instead of an experimental intervention. possible solutions are available to ensure public health research in disease outbreaks can proceed without undue delays. a minister of health is not the equivalent of ethical review and clearance by a duly constituted committee. an appropriate solution would be to seek an alternative mechanism to that of full review of a complete research protocol by an IRB. a duly constituted oversight body could decide to waive the requirement for signed consent forms in favor of oral consent depending on the specifics of a research proposal. the first situation is that of repeat occurrences of an outbreak of a known disease, such as cholera [8],[9],[10], and therefore cannot be reviewed by the expedited mechanism. the epidemic highlights the major difficulties in conducting clinical research in disease outbreaks involving novel disease-causing agents. the use of \u201cmodel protocols\u201d to enable the more rapid IRB or ERC review described above may not be sufficient for outbreaks of new diseases. the most urgent concern at the time of an outbreak of any disease is to implement public health measures to contain its spread. investigators can prepare what we shall call a \u201cmodel protocol\u201d with all the basic elements spelled out in detail. the model protocol can be submitted for full review to the IRB or ERC, omitting items that are specific to the time and place of the predicted outbreak. a problem could arise where the drugs to be studied are not known in advance. despite the global impact of SARS, relatively few treatment protocols were studied in clinical trials. one study of early corticosteroid treatment for SARS was even terminated prematurely because the epidemic had subsided just as the study got underway. the epidemic highlights the major difficulties in conducting clinical research in disease outbreaks involving novel disease-causing agents. some form of ethical oversight is needed to conduct an investigation of a disease outbreak. the mechanism and procedures can vary from an established ERC to development of a model protocol submitted to a committee for full review. such safeguards can help to ensure that the rights and welfare of individuals are protected in disease outbreaks."}
