{"summary": "arterivirus family consists of equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). PRRSV isolates segregate into European (type I) and North American (type II) genotypes. arteriviruses employ a unique mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce an extensive nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. these transcripts are 3\u2032 coterminal but also carry a common 5\u2032 leader sequence that is identical to the 5\u2032-terminal part of the genome (37). sg mRNA is thought to start with the generation of subgenome-length negative-stranded templates. the minor envelope protein-coding region of vAPRRSasc, ORF2a to ORF4, was replaced with the gene set of vEAV030. the resultant chimeric virus was designated vAPRRS-EAV2ab34. EAV and PRRSV are the most extensively studied arteriviruses. knockout mutant retained moderate level of infectiousness (17, 19) expression of all other genes in the 3\u2032 quarter of the EAV genome (ORFs 2a to 7) was found to be essential for the production of infectious virus particles. knockouts of ORFs 2a to 4 were found to produce virus-like particles containing the three major structural proteins (GP5, M, and N) and RNA (28, 59, 63) pSn is the (primary) PRRSV receptor, but the internalized virus is not uncoated. the protein is not expressed by MARC-145 cells, which are permissive to PRRSV infection. the membrane protein CD163 was identified as an additional determinant. chimeric PRRSV acquired broad cell tropism that is typical of its minor envelope protein donor, EAV. besides MARC-145, the chimeric virus could productively infect both the BHK-21 and Vero cell lines. this suggests that the tropism and entry of PRRSV are mediated by the minor rather than the major envelope proteins. a rabbit antiserum recognizing EAV nsp2 has been described previously (45) and an anti-EAV GP2b serum (ARV-EAV-GP2b, recognizing the MSPSRRTSSGTLPRRKIL peptide) were obtained from Shanghai GL Biochem (Shanghai, China) the secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 555-labeled goat b34\u2013APRRS56 was amplified via splicing overlap extension (SOE) PCR with the primer pair FE234asc\u2013RA14780 (56) this fragment was subsequently cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) the hybrid fragment was transferred to pAPRRSasc to yield the chimeric full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS-EAV2 RT-PCR amplification for sg mRNAs 2 to 5 of the APRRS sequence RA12661 TTTACAGGTCTCGGCTTC RA13077 CCCTAGCTCTCTCTCTCTCTTG RT-PCR amplification. all experiments with live chimeric viruses and their parents were performed in a biosafety level 2 biocontainment laboratory. fresh MARC-145 cells in a six-well plate were transfected with 2 g of plasmid per well using FuGene HD transfection reagent (Roche, Germany), followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. when about 80% of transfected cells displayed cytopathic effect (CPE), cell culture supernatants were harvested. plaques were fixed in 4% (vol/vol) formaldehyde in distilled water for 1 h. then stained with crystal violet (5% [wt/vol] in 20% ethanol. chimeric viruses in MARC-145 and BHK-21 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01. the viral titers of each sample were determined as described in Materials and Methods. the sg mRNAs of chimeric and parental viruses were amplified by RT-PCR. RT-PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. full-length cDNA clones with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter were used. ATCC was cultured in modified Eagle medium (MEM) with 10% FBS. all the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. the wild-type PRRSV strain vAPRRS was derived from infectious cDNA clone pAPRRS. hybrid fragment EAV2ab34\u2013APRRS56 was amplified from pEAV030 using the primer pair FE234asc\u2013RE4-A5. fragment APRRS56 was amplified from pAPRRS using the primer pair FE4-A5\u2013RA14780. all constructs were verified by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequencing.

PRRSV-specific mRNAs were detected with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to nucleotides (nt) 15468 to 15488 in the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral genome sequence. gels were exposed to phosphorimager screens, which were scanned using a Typhoon variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare) RESULTS Generation of a viable chimeric arterivirus. pAPRRS-EAV2ab34- and pAPRRS-transfected cells stained positive for both PRRSV nsp2 and N proteins. pEAV030-transfected cells stained positive for both PRRSV and EAV nonstructural and structural proteins. pAPRRS-EAV2ab34- and pAPRRS-transfected cells stained positive for both PRRSV nsp2 and N proteins, while pE chimeric nature of vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 was confirmed by the fact that it expressed PRRSV nsp2 and N, as well as EAV GP2b. bar, 100 m. genome sequencing confirmed that vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 genome indeed contained EAV ORFs 2a to 4 in the vAPRRS backbone. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 displays extended tropism in cell culture. it is well established that EAV can infect the MARC-145, BHK-21, and Vero cell lines. vAPPRS failed to infect BHK-21 cells, but not for vEAV030. both the MARC-145 and BHK-21 cell lines were strongly labeled for PRRSV nsp2 as well as N protein. this confirmed that this chimera can efficiently infect BHK-21 cells. similar results were obtained on vero cells, a second cell line normally permissive to EAV but not to PRRSV. the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera has lost its ability to infect PAM. the chimera is unable to infect PAM, which are readily infected by wild-type PRRSV particles. the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera is unable to infect PAM. chimeric vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 propagation in MARC-145 and BHK-21cells. cells were infected with the chimeric and parental viruses at an MOI of 0.01. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 reached its peak titer around 72 h p.i. plaque morphologies of chimeric and parental viruses were assessed using MARC-145 cells fixed at 4 days p.i. no plaques were obtained when BHK-21 cells were infected with vAPRRS. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 plaques in BHK-21 cells were substantially smaller than those of vEAV030. the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera is the site of leader-to-body joining (37). however, in the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera, the TRS-B motif would have to base pair with the PRRSV TRS-L sequence to produce the templates for the synthesis of sg mRNAs 3, 4 and 5. the pattern of the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 was identical to that of the parental virus vAPRRS. as expected, the pattern of the chimera vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 was unchanged for the two sg mRNAs encoded downstream of this insertion site, mRNAs 6 and 7. the junction sites identified for each of mRNAs 2 to 5 are summarized. newly discovered TRS-B-like sequences are named 3.a, 3.b, etc. the frequency with which each junction was encountered in the 12 cDNA clones analyzed is given below the TRS-B name. sg mRNAs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the chimeric virus were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned for nucleotide sequence analysis. this showed that the TRS-B used to produce mRNA2 had not changed in the chimeric virus. in our opinion, the mixture of sg mRNA3 species identified adequately explains the lack of a prominent RNA3 band in Fig. 7A. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera was characterized by genetic stability. chimeric virus may evolve during passaging and develop adaptive mutations. nucleotide sequencing revealed three nonsynonymous replicase point mutations (Glu-2512 Asp in nsp9, Arg-3881 Pro and Lys-3902 Thr in nsp12) and one synonymous point mutation (U C) at nucleotide 198 in the inserted EAV ORF3. this suggests the production of viable progeny viruses from all three constructs. pAPRRS-EAV2ab34- and pAPRRS-transfected cells stained positive for both PRRSV and EAV nonstructural and structural proteins. pAPRRS-EAV2ab34- and pAPRRS-transfected cells stained positive for both PRRSV nsp2 and N proteins, while pEAV030-transfected cells were negative. pAPRRS-EAV2ab34-transfected the chimeric nature of vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 was confirmed by the fact that it expressed PRRSV nsp2 and N, as well as EAV GP2b. bar, 100 m. genomic RNA was extracted from P1 virus and was used for RT-PCR amplification with a pair of primers that would confirm its chimeric nature. RT-PCR was performed with the chimeric primer pair FA12066 (in vEAV030 ORF3) to amplify a 1,139-bp product specific for the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera. the parental viruses were included as negative controls. chimeric virus vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 infects both the MARC-145 and BHK-21 cell lines with the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera. similar results were obtained on vero cells, a second cell line that is normally permissive to EAV but not to PRRSV. chimera has an extended tropism in cell culture and that this tropism matches that of the minor envelope protein donor, EAV. chimeric vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera has lost its ability to infect PAM. the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera is unable to infect PAM. chimeric vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 propagation in MARC-145 and BHK-21cells. cells were infected with the chimeric and parental viruses at an MOI of 0.01. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 reached its peak titer around 72 h p.i. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 plaques appeared similar to those of the vEAV030 donor virus. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 plaques in BHK-21 cells were substantially smaller than those of vEAV030. the morphologies of chimeric and parental viruses were assessed using MARC-145 cells fixed at 4 days p.i. the vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera is believed to play a critical role in determining the efficiency and precise site of leader-to-body joining (37). however, the EAV and PRRSV consensus TRS-B sequences would have to base pair with the PRRSV TRS-L sequence to produce the templates for the synthesis of sg mRNAs 3, 4 and 5. chimera vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 produced a pattern identical to that of the parental virus vAPRRS. as expected, the pattern of the chimera was unchanged for the two sg mRNAs encoded downstream of this insertion site, mRNAs 6 and 7. mRNA2 was about 300 nucleotides shorter than the corresponding transcript of the parental virus. the TRS-L region of the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR is shown at the top. boxed regions indicate the possibilities of base pairing with the TRS-L sequence. newly discovered TRS-B-like sequences are named 3.a, 3.b, etc. sg mRNAs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the chimeric virus were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned for nucleotide sequence analysis. this showed that the TRS-B used to produce mRNA2 had not changed in the chimeric virus. the results for mRNA4 remained somewhat puzzling, since two novel TRS-B-like motifs were found to be used. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 chimera was characterized by genetic stability. chimeric virus could evolve during passaging. chimeric virus could acquire adaptive mutations. RNA was extracted, amplified in its entirety by RT-PCR. nucleotide sequencing showed that the heterologous ORF2a-to-ORF4 region had remained genetically stable for eight passages. no nonsynonymous mutations were detected in any of the structural-protein-coding sequences. arteriviruses can cause various clinical symptoms ranging from lethal to asymptomatic persistent infection in susceptible host animals (42) pSn is the authentic receptor for virus internalization, while CD163 may function as a downstream mediator of entry. both putative receptors could be used for PRRSV entry, e.g., acting as the receptor and coreceptor, as described for human immunodeficiency virus (8). chimeric arteriviruses carrying different combinations of envelope proteins could aid in identifying the viral attachment protein (42) chimeras in which the GP5 ectodomain was replaced by comparable sequences of related and unrelated RNA viruses had been developed previously, and two viable chimeric viruses containing the GP5 ectodomains of PRRSV and LDV were obtained. our results create new possibilities for functional characterization of arterivirus minor envelope proteins. the minor envelope proteins are poorly understood compared to the major envelope proteins. a deficiency in any one of them abolished the production of infectious progeny. vAPRRS-EAV2ab34 mRNA synthesis is clearly beyond the scope of this study. the analysis of 12 clones per mRNA is not sufficient to obtain a reliable measurement of their relative abundances. the same cannot be said about ORF5a and ORF5 (Fig. 7B) the current modified live vaccine (MLV) can be amplified only in MARC-145 cells. a peak titer of 2.5 108 TCID50/ml was measured in the MARC-145 cell line. chimeric nature of this recombinant virus could provide a blueprint for the rational design of vaccines that can be used to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. y level 2 biocontainment facilities."}
