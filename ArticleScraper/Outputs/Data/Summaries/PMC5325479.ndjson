{"summary": "the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 in a cell culture taken from a patient who died of pneumonia in Saudi Arabia. the median age of those affected is 47 years old, with most fatalities occurring in patients over 60 years old. a large proportion of severely ill patients require mechanical ventilation. experimental animal models of MERS-CoV infection should exhibit a life-threatening lower respiratory tract disease. little is known about the comparative pathology and inflammatory cell response in rhesus macaques or common marmosets infected with this virus. three rhesus macaques and three common marmosets were infected with the virus. one individual of each species was left uninfected to serve as a control. the animals were planned to be euthaniazed when they were suffering from fatal respiratory symptom, impending death or 20% of body weight loss. drinking potable water is obtained from the city of Beijing and delivered to the animals via automated watering system. the AWS is checked daily to ensure proper operation i.e., water pressure, free flowing exits and absence of leakages. cages were washed every week by hand. mock-infected rhesus macaques were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, i.m) prior to the procedures, and while under deep anesthesia, the animals were sacrificed through femoral artery bloodletting at 3 days post-infection. fixed samples were dehydrated and dewaxed according to conventional procedures. some sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin using routine methods. two independent pathologists observed all slides and were blinded to the experimental design. endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature for 30 minutes. pre-hybridization was performed at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours. sections were incubated in a blocking buffer at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. rhesus macaques and three common marmosets were infected with the virus. one individual of each species was left uninfected to serve as a control. all experiments were conducted within an animal biosafety level 3 facility. 0.5\u20130.75 m2 and 0.5\u20130.6 m depending on the weight of the individual animal. the photoperiod is supplemented during the winter months with an artificial lighting source to provide a 12: 12 light cycle. temperature and humidity in animal holding rooms are maintained in accordance with recommendations in the national standards for animal care. mock-infected rhesus macaques were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, i.m) prior to the procedures and intratracheally inoculated with 1 mL of hCoV-EMC (5 106 TCID50/0.5 mL) diluted in DMEM. the common marmosets were observed twice daily, and clinical signs were recorded. none of the infected animals were euthanized or died without euthanasia prior to their sacrifice at 3 days post-infection. no animals were euthanized or died without euthanasia prior to their sacrifice at 3 days post-infection. ISH was carried out using the Enhanced Sensitive ISH Detection Kit I (Boster, china) according to the manufacturer's instructions. endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide. the rectal temperature of the infected rhesus macaques increased to 40.5\u00b0C at 1\u20132 days post-infection. the infected common marmosets showed manifest symtoms of viral infection, including severe respiratory symtoms, drastical water intake decrease and overt weight loss. pathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV. interstitial pneumonia and eosinophil (black arrowhead) infiltration in the expanded alveolar septum. IHC was carried out to identify CD68+ macrophages, CD15+ neutrophils, CD57+ natural killer cells, CD20+ B lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells, and CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes. in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a large number of diffusely and focally infiltrating eosinophils were found in the thickened alveolar septum and oedemat rhesus macaques and common marmosets were extensively distributed in pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, eosinophils and bronchial epithelial cells. in the lungs of common marmosets, a moderate level of MERS-CoV-positive antigens were detected in pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in the lungs of common marmosets. moset animal models are summarized and shown in Table 3. Fig 3. Distribution of MERS-CoV antigen and viral RNA in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV. rhesus macaques and common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV. alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells extensively distributed in alveolar macrophages. ultrastructural observations were performed on lesions in infected lung samples and on mock-infected samples. no viral particles were observed in the lungs of mock-infected common marmosets. mosets, DDP4 was widely expressed in type I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. however, DDP4 was only weakly expressed in the bronchial epithelial cells. the infected common marmosets showed manifest symtoms of viral infection. focal interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary oedema were observed in different parts of the pulmonary lobes as was mild haemorrhaging. the most prominent pathological effect observed in the lungs of rhesus macaques was diffuse and focal eosinophil infiltration in the thickened alveolar septum. pathological findings in common marmoset tissues A histopathological analysis detected numerous lesions in the lungs of infected marmosets. exudative pathological changes were found, exhibiting haemorrhage, widespread pulmonary oedema and a large number of inflammatory cells. rhesus macaques and common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV. eosinophils infiltrated the alveolar septum. other types of inflammatory cells were rarely observed. a moderate level of MERS-CoV-positive antigens were detected in pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in the lungs of common marmosets. no MERS-CoV-positive antigens or viral RNA was detected in the lungs of the control NHPs. pathology index Rhesus macaque Common marmoset Clinical signs transient fever severe respiratory symtoms, drastical water intake decrease and overt weight loss Pathological findings Interstitial pneumonia focal mild Pulmonary oedema focal widespread, with fibrinous exudates Degeneration and necrosis of pneumocytes. rhesus macaques and common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV. expression pattern of DDP4 in lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets. rhesus macaques strongly expressed in type I and II pneumocytes. rhesus macaques exhibited varying degrees of lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, haemorrhaging, degeneration and necrosis. in the lungs of common marmosets, exudative pathological changes were found, exhibiting pulmonary oedema. in the lungs of common marmosets, diffuse and focal neutrophil infiltration occurred in the oedematous alveolar cavities, bronchial lumen and mildly thickened alveolar septum, around the bronchus. differences in inflammatory cell infiltration suggest that inflammatory cells may function in the development of MERS-CoV infection. eosinophils and neutrophils play important roles in rhesus macaques and common marmoset rhesus macaque model showed no-to-very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. rhesus macaque model represents mild infection of MERS-CoV. cases include exudative-phase diffuse alveolar damage with denuding of bronchiolar epithelia. inflammatory cells may play a crucial role in fatal MERS-CoV infections. inflammatory cells may mimic the infection in humans, making these models useful for further study of pathogenesis, prevention and treatment. models of MERS-CoV infection using rhesus macaques and common marmosets mimic the oncome of MERS-CoV infection in humans. they may also be suitable models for the development of effective medications and prophylactic treatments for MERS-CoV infections. no pathological changes were identified in the lungs examined from the control rhesus macaque or the control common marmoset."}
