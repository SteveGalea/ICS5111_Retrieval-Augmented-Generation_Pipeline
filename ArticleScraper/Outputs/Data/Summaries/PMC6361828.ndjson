{"summary": "the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes large polyprotein precursors, open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF1b, which are proteolytically cleaved to generate 16 non-structural proteins. the 3\u2032 one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N) recognition of virus infection plays an important role in limiting virus replication at the early stages of infection. four models describing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been proposed thus far. cathepsin B and L, which are specific lysosomal cysteine proteases, play a role after phagocytosis of cholesterol crystals. avage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33. these molecules then recruit the speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. this event activates the downstream molecule, caspase-1, which catalyzes proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1 and pro the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. cells and Viruses Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously. influenza A virus strain A/PR8 (H1N1) was grown at 35\u00b0C for 2 days in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old fertile chicken eggs. cDNA fragments of E, 3a, and M were amplified from pcDNA3.1D-E-V5His and pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His using specific primer sets. to generate plasmids pCA7-flag-E, pCA7-flag-3a, and pCA7-flag-M, pCA7-HA-3a, and pCA7-HA-3a, cDNA fragments of E, 3a, and M were amplified from pcDNA3.1D-E-V5His, pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His, and pcDNA3.1D-M- lysates were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 1% NP-40, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) membranes were incubated over night with mouse anti-V5-tag (R960-25, Invitrogen), mouse anti-GFP (GF200, Nacalai Tesque), or rabbit anti-tubulin ( sub-confluent monolayers of HEK293FT cells seeded in a collagen-coated dish were transfected with 3 g of pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector expressing each viral protein or EGFP together with ViraPower Packaging Mix. supernatants containing lentiviruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 m filter (Millipore) at 72\u201396 h post-transfection. HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with 1 g of pCA7-flag-3a or pCD7-flag-3a-CS together with 0.5 g of ER-mCherry or DsRed-Golgi. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100/PBS. fluorescent signals were observed by confocal microscopy (A1R+, Nikon) Statistical significance was tested using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. 0.05 were considered statistically significant. influenza A virus strain A/PR8 (H1N1) was grown at 35\u00b0C for 2 days in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old fertile eggs. the viral titer was quantified in a standard plaque assay using MDCK cells. Plasmids cDNAs encoding the E and M proteins of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 strain were obtained by reverse transcription. pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His and pcDNA3.1D-M-V5His were subcloned into the EcoR I-Not I sites of the pCA7-flag-ASC plasmid or pCA7-HA-M2 plasmid. the mutated E fragments were amplified by inverse PCR with wild-type E-containing plasmids and specific primer sets. membranes were incubated over night with mouse anti-V5-tag (R960-25, Invitrogen), mouse anti-GFP (GF200, Nacalai Tesque), mouse anti-influenza A virus M2 (14C2, Abcam), mouse anti-GFP (GF200, Nacalai Tesque), or rabbit anti-tubulin (DM1A, Santa Cruz), followed by horseradish peroxide-conjugated anti-mouse IgG ( HEK293FT cells seeded in a collagen-coated dish were transfected with 3 g of pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector expressing each viral protein or EGFP together with ViraPower Packaging Mix (Invitrogen) the supernatants containing lentiviruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 m filter (Millipore) at 72\u201396 h post-transfection. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% Triton X-100/PBS. after washing with PBS and blocking with 4% BSA/PBS, cells were incubated with a mouse anti-flag antibody (M2, Sigma) followed by incubation with a mouse anti-flag antibody (M2, Sigma) lentiviruses expressing the lentiviruses stimulated IL-1 release from LPS-primed BMMs. lentiviruses expressing the lentiviruses stimulated IL-1 release from lentiviruses. lentiviruses expressing the lentiviruses stimulated IL-1 release from lentiviruses. lentivirus-infected cells were transfected with pLenti6-E-V5, pLenti6-3a-V5, pLenti6-M-V5 (A), pLenti6-M-V5 (A), pLenti-GFP-V5 (B), or pLenti-M2-V5 plasmids (C) supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and analyzed mutation of the cysteine-rich domain blocks the ion conductivity by the 3a protein. to this end, we substituted amino acids Cys-127, Cys-130 and Cys-133 within the cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV 3a protein with serine to generate a lentivirus expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutant, 3a-CS. lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV E, V25F, 3a, 3a-CS or M at MOI 0.25. supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and analyzed for IL-1. a process considered as a hallmark of NLRP3 activation led to a redistribution from the cytosol to the perinuclear space. cells expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutants 3a-CS or V25F uniformly expressed NLRP3 throughout the cytoplasm, but it was redistributed to the perinuclear region. lux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. to this end, BMMs in K+-rich medium were infected with influenza A virus or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins. IL-1 secretion caused by influenza virus was completely blocked. K+ efflux is required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV 3a protein. BMMs were infected with influenza virus A/PR8 (A) or lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV 3a or E proteins (B) and cultured in the presence or absence of KCl (130 mM). cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection, and analyzed for IL-1 by lentiviruses expressing the lentiviruses stimulated IL-1 release from LPS-primed BMMs. lentiviruses expressing the lentiviruses stimulated IL-1 release from lentiviruses. lentiviruses expressing the lentiviruses stimulated IL-1 release from lentiviruses. HEK293FT cells were transfected with pLenti6-E-V5, pLenti6-3a-V5, pLenti6-M-V5 (A), pLenti-GFP-V5 (B), or pLenti-M2-V5 plasmids (C) supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and analyzed for IL-1 by ELISA. mutation of the cysteine-rich domain blocks the ion conductivity by the 3a protein. to this end, we substituted amino acids Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133 within the cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV 3a protein with serine to generate a lentivirus expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutant, 3a-CS. supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and analyzed for IL-1 by ELISA. data are representative of at least three independent experiments, and indicate the mean SD (B); P 0.001. NLRP3 inflammasome was redistributed to the perinuclear region. cells expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutants 3a-CS or V25F uniformly expressed NLRP3 throughout the cytoplasm. these data provide evidence that the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential. IL-1 secretion caused by influenza virus was completely blocked when the extracellular K+ concentration was increased to 130 mM. the inhibitory effect of the K+-rich medium was also observed when cells were stimulated with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins. BMMs were infected with influenza virus A/PR8 (A) or lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV 3a or E proteins (B) and cultured in the presence or absence of KCl. cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection, and analyzed for IL-1 by ELISA. hepatitis C virus stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 production. viroporins encoded by RNA viruses activate NLRP3 inflammasome. hepatitis C virus stimulates IL-1 production through its p7 viroporin. a recent study has shown that the 3a protein of EV71 directly interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex. in the case of SARS-CoV, the viroporin E forms forms Ca2+-permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. a better understanding of the mechanism that governs the NLRP3 inflammasome will facilitate the development of more effective interventions for the treatment of infectious diseases. authors say the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
