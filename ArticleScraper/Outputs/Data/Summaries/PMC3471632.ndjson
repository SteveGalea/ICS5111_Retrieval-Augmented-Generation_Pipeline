{"summary": "Combined nasopharyngeal wash (or swab) and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected weekly beginning 1\u20132 weeks before transplantation until day 100. each 1\u20133 months for 1-year after transplantation from allogeneic recipients enrolled in a prospective surveillance study approved by the Institutional Review Board. participants provided written informed consent. the in-house PCR had a sensitivity of 5\u201310 DNA copies/mL. a subset of 397 samples, including 31 positive for KIPyV and 27 positive for WUPyV by the PCR. samples with discordant KIPyV results included 3 positive by the in-house PCR and negative by the alternate PCR (4) and 1 negative by the in-house PCR and positive by the alternate PCR. samples with discordant results had 5,000 copies/mL, indicating low levels of DNA near the assay limits of detection. cox regression models were fit to evaluate potential risk factors for detection of KIPyV or WUPyV in the first year after transplantation. differences in KIPyV and WUPyV copies/mL according to patient age at transplantation were assessed by using linear regression. symptoms, increased liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels, and death within 1 year. Virus detection within the last week was defined as a positive sample at the current or last study contact and a lag time 14 days. patients had 1 specimen collected during January 2006\u2013December 2007. patients reported any of 11 respiratory or 4 systemic symptoms. the in-house PCR had a sensitivity of 5\u201310 DNA copies/mL. a subset of 397 samples, including 31 positive for KIPyV and 27 positive for WUPyV by the PCR, was retested by using published real-time PCRs. cordant results had 5,000 copies/mL, indicating low levels of DNA near the assay limits of detection. assays to detect respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3. sensitivity of each assay was 1,000 viral copies/mL. cox regression models were fit to evaluate risk factors for KIPyV or WUPyV detection in the first 100 days after transplantation. CMV reactivation was modeled as a time-dependent covariate set to 1 when the absolute neutrophil count was 500 cells/mm3. es with multiple occurrences over time were analyzed as functions of recent KIPyV or WUPyV detection by using logistic and linear regression models. es with multiple occurrences over time were analyzed as functions of recent KIPyV or WUPyV detection by using logistic and linear regression models. n = 62 Not infected, n = 160 Age, y 20 23 (10) 18 (29) 5 (3) 20\u201339 37 (17) 14 (23) 23 (14) 40\u201359 99 (45) 17 (27) 82 (51) >60 63 (28) 13 (21) 50 (31) Sex F 87 (39) 23 (37) 64 (40) M 135 (61) 39 (63) 96 (60) the underlying disease stage of a patient was categorized as low, intermediate, or high risk (29,31). two patients were positive for both viruses; one patient was positive concurrently in the same specimen. a respiratory virus was detected in 32% of KIPyV-positive and 14% of WUPyV-positive specimens. twenty-one (43%) KIPyV-positive and 9 (60%) WUPyV-positive patients had 1 positive specimen. positive episodes with detection in 4 consecutive specimens were seen in 18 (37%) KIPyV-positive patients, including 6 with 9\u201319 consistently positive specimens. the number of copies/mL was significantly higher in specimens positive for KIPyV and a respiratory virus than in specimens in which KIPyV was the only virus detected. age at transplantation was not correlated with KIPyV or WUPyV copies/mL. age at transplantation was not correlated with KIPyV or WUPyV copies/mL. samples positive for KI polyomavirus (black bars) and WU polyomavirus (white bars) values above bars are percentages. associations between KIPyV or WUPyV Detection and Symptoms Detection within the past week was significantly associated with sputum production. KIPyV, KI polyomavirus, WU polyomavirus; HCT, hematopoietic cell transplantation; OR, odds ratio. each result was adjusted for the following covariates. 95% CI 0.1\u20130.6, p = 0.001) and grades 2\u20134 acute GvHD (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3\u20137.7, p = 0.01) in a model adjusted for donor type and stem cell source. only 5 patients had WUPyV detected before the GvHD diagnosis. no relationships between detection of KIPyV or WUPyV and CMV reactivation were found. the cohort had a median of 13 specimens per patient (range 1\u201330 specimens) patients ranged in age from 9.6 months to 75.2 years (median 51.5 years) a respiratory virus was detected in 17% of specimens. 51% of patients had 1 sample positive for any respiratory virus during their time in the study. cord blood 15 (7) 3 (5) 12 (8) Unrelated\u2013matched 97 (44) 24 (39) 73 (46) Unrelated\u2013mismatched 24 (11) 6 (10) 18 (11) Conditioning regimen Myeloablative 128 (58) 41 (66) 87 (54) underlying disease stage of a patient was categorized as low, intermediate, or high risk (29,31) yV-positive and 14% of WUPyV-positive specimens accounted for 78% of respiratory virus co-detections. yV-positive and coronaviruses accounted for 78% of respiratory virus co-detections. DNA in 28 hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients with >2 KIPyV-positive specimens and B) WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) DNA in 6 recipients with and without detection of a respiratory virus by day after transplantation. each line represents 1 patient in order of age. each line represents 1 patient in order of age. of age and 18 (78%) of 23 patients 20 years of age were positive for KIPyV or WUPyV compared with 44 (22%) of 199 patients 20 years of age. detecting a respiratory virus within the last 2 weeks was a significant predictor of KIPyV detection. ic symptoms associated with KIPyV or WUPyV detection within the prior week or month in HCT recipients*. Ear pain was too rare for analysis. each result was adjusted for the following covariates: detection of the other polyomavirus (KIPyV or WUPyV), detection of a respiratory virus, day relative to transplantation, age at transplantation, stem cell source, donor type, and grades 2\u20134 acute graft-versus-host-disease. only 5 patients had WUPyV detected before the GvHD diagnosis. only 1 of 76 BAL samples was positive for KIPyV (6.3 log10 copies/mL) of 66 deaths within 1 year of transplantation, 12 occurred in patients positive for KIPyV, 4 in patients positive for WUPyV and 1 in a patient positive for KIPyV and WUPyV. a cross-sectional study tested specimens from 45 asymptomatic patients with respiratory illness detected KIPyV in 8 (17.8%), similar to our findings, but with no WUPyV detected. young age was a risk factor for detection of KIPyV or WUPyV, which has been reported (4,7,32,33) a site of persistence for these new polyomaviruses has not yet been identified. human tonsils have been postulated as a reservoir and reactivation has been demonstrated in lymph nodes and spleen (17,36,37) both viruses were detected in fecal samples from patients infected with HIV-1, healthy blood donors, and children and in urine samples from children and immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults (18,38). both viruses were detected in fecal samples from HCT recipients (18,40), and an association was found between virus and diarrhea (40)."}
