{"summary": "METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of MERS-CoV reported in four cities of the Makkah region from March to June 2014. RESULTS Analysis of the 261 cases revealed that the incidence peaked in mid-April 2014 and the fatality rate was 42%. males in Jeddah are at a higher risk due to greater outdoor exposure while females in Taif are at higher risk due to domestic caregiving. secondary data were collected from all confirmed cases reported by public and private hospitals serving four cities of the Makkah region between March and June 2014. the data were compiled in Makkah for retrospective review and analysis. the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Makkah region. unique patient codes were issued to each study participant to maintain anonymity. no personal identifiers were listed on the Excel data sheet. data was e-mailed to all cities for reporting of data on these factors. the data was cross-checked and clarified and missing data were provided through direct communication with the appropriate health directorates. the variables for which data were collected were patient code; age; sex; nationality; occupation; clinical signs; symptoms. the majority of cases were reported in jeddah (203, 78%), followed by Makkah (39, 15%), Taif (13, 5%), and Kunfudah (6, 2%). 147 (56%) were Saudis (incidence 3.39 per 100000, 95% CI 2.86\u20133.95) and 114 (44%) non-Saudis. in Makkah, 19 (49%) were males (mean age 44.3 years, range 14\u201384 years) and 20 (51%) females (mean age 39.5 years, range 18\u201369 years) in Taif, 5 (38%) were males (mean age 43.2 years, range 31\u201359 years) in Kunfudah, 4 (67%) were males (mean age 50.5 years, range 36\u201365 years) and 2 (33%) females (mean age 3 84 (32%) had been healthcare workers (HCWs) and 177 (68%) had been non-health care workers (non-HCWs; Figure 3). majority of HCW cases had been reported in jeddah (63 cases, 31%), followed by Makkah (16 cases, 41%), Taif (4 cases, 31%), and Kunfudah (1 case, 17%). non-healthcare-related cleaners 2 (9%) Policemen 1 (11%) Total non-HCWs 16 (41%) Taif Nurses 3 Unemployed workers 4 X-ray technicians 1 Housewives 4 Teachers 1 Total HCWs 4 (31%) Total non-HCWs 9 (83%) Kunfudah Nurses 22 (35%) Retired 32 Physicians 19 (30%) Housewives 26 Technicians 7 (11%) Employees 18 Administrative clerks 6 (10%) Unemployed/not workers 42 Other most common signs and symptoms were cough (170 cases, 65%), fever >38\u00b0C (165 cases, 63%), radiological evidence of pneumonia (146 cases, 60%), shortness of breath (136 cases, 52%), joint pain or swelling (137 cases, 52%), fatigue (108 cases, 41%), sore throat (96 cases, 37%), fever with chills (95 cases, 36%), wheezing or abnormal breathing (68 cases, 26%), chest pain (66 cases, 25%), headaches ( high (50109/L), low (150109/L), normal (150\u2013400109/L), and high (>400109/L), 9 (3%) had a very low, 40 (15%) had a low, 98 (38%) had a normal, and 7 (%) had a high PLT count. mortality among non-HCW cases was higher (OR 12.8, 95% CI 6.02\u201327.2, P.001) compared to males (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1. males appear more susceptible to infection than females in jeddah. females appear more susceptible to infection in Taif despite remaining indoors probably due to close contact with or exposure to confirmed cases. no confirmed cases were reported by private healthcare facilities in Makah, Taif, and Kunfudah. in jeddah, 56% of confirmed cases had hospital-acquired infection from a prior visit to an HCF. private healthcare facilities in Makkah, Taif, Kunfudah, and other regional cities did not report whether they had treated any confirmed cases during the study period. as the actual MERS-related morbidity and mortality for these cities could not be determined, the fatality rate (42%) may have been underestimated. report cases of any notifiable diseases, including MERS, remains challenging. knowledge of epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics will help identify gaps, set goals for further research. key to this effort is establishing private\u2013public healthcare partnerships for both effective response and collaborative research."}
