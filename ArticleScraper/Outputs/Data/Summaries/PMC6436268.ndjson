{"summary": "the novel coronavirus (nCoV), or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is a particular strain different from any other known hCoV with the possibility of human and also zoonotic transmissions. a cross-sectional study design was followed to include 85 PHC physicians in Abha city. 81.2% stated that upon exit from the room of a MERS-CoV patient, the physician should remove and discard personal protective equipment. non-saudi physicians expressed higher percent of excellent knowledge than those who did not attend a CME activity (55.6% and 23.9%, respectively, P = 0.011). the MERS-CoV belongs to the genus \"Betacoronavirus\" it appears to replicate efficiently in human respiratory tissues targeting alveolar epithelial cells and the endothelium of blood vessels in the lungs. the transmission of the virus was through a hospital cluster, suggesting that the virus can be spread through contact and in the form of droplets. the eastern region of Saudi Arabia was affected by MERS-CoV. the virus could proceed throughout the country. five of the highest travelled airports in the world are located in countries where MERS-CoV has been transmitted. primary health care physicians are expected to play an important role in detecting and management of cases of MERS-CoV and adhere to guidelines for prevention. the researcher felt that it is necessary to conduct this study to target primary care physicians by assessing their knowledge and adherence toward MERS-CoV updated MOH guidelines. statistically significant findings considered if P 0.05. half of participants (49.4%) aged 30\u201340 years, 37.6% aged 30 years, and 12.9% aged more than 40 years. Approximately, two-third of participants (61.2%) were males. main identified knowledge gaps, with least correct answers, among primary care physicians regarding MERS-CoV were about protected exposure (32.9%), highest seasonal incidence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (60%), relation between incidence of MERS-CoV and overcrowding (62.4%), case fatality of MERS-CoV cases (63.5%), and collecting specimens from MERS-CoV patients (64.7%). 76 89.4 MERS-CoV has been commonly reported among children 66 77.6. it is not useful to collect specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs form MERS-CoV patients 55 64.7 MERS-CoV patients should be place in single patient rooms 79 92.9 Case fatality is less than 10% 54 63.5 Study findings also show that knowledge of primary care physicians about MERS-CoV was poor among 5.9%, good among 63.5% 14.1% mentioned burning all patients\u2019 clothes, curtains, and bed coverings. practice-related adherence of primary care physicians about MERS-CoV was poor among 43.5%, good among 50.6%, and excellent among 5.9%. non-Saudi physicians expressed higher percent of excellent knowledge than Saudi physicians (40% and 20%, respectively) their knowledge also differed significantly according to their position (P = 0.047), with general practitioners having the highest percent of excellent knowledge (37.7%) participants who had lectures as a source of knowledge about MERS-CoV had significantly higher percent of excellent knowledge than those who did not attend a CME activity. participants practice grades about MERS-CoV according to their personal characteristics Poor Good Excellent P No. Percentage No. Percentage Age groups 30 years 15 46.9 15 46.9 2 6.3 30-40 years 16 38.1 23 54.8 3 7.1 >40 years 6 54.5 5 45.5 0 0.0 0.785 Gender Male 19 36.5 30 57.7 3 5.8 Female 18 54.5 13 39.4 2 6.1 0.241 Nationality Saudi 17 42.5 18 45.0 5 12.5 Non- primary care physicians in abha city expressed suboptimal grades of knowledge and practice-related adherence regarding Saudi MOH guidelines. less than one-third of primary care physicians had excellent knowledge, whereas only 3.5% had excellent practice-related adherence to guidelines. the main sources of knowledge about MERS-CoV for primary care physicians in abha city were the internet websites and lectures, followed by medical journals and lastly textbooks. this finding is in accordance with that of Nour et al.[13] who reported that the television had been reported to be the main source of knowledge about such type of virus. adherence to such procedures can successfully lead to decreased morbidity and mortality related to MERS-CoV infection. however, nour et al.[13] reported limited numbers of correct responses regarding items about hand washing and the use of personal protective equipment. significantly less practice-related adherence to guidelines are associated with Saudi primary care physicians. financial support and sponsorship Nil.
