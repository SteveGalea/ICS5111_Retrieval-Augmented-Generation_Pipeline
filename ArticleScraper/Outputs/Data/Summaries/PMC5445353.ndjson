{"summary": "ncRNAs can be classified as short ncRNAs (200 nucleotides) or long ncRNAs (>200 nucleotides) short ncRNAs can be further classified as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) emerging data have identified the important roles of lncRNAs in regulating anti-viral responses. this review highlights specific lncRNAs associated with viral infection, specifically focusing on their expression and function. functions and mechanisms LncRNAs regulate numerous cellular processes such as gene imprinting, regulation of the p53 pathway, stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. lncRNA air is imprinted and expressed only from the paternal allele. lncRNA can act as scaffold to recruit chromatin remodeling components. lncRNAs act as miRNA \u201csponges\u201d by sharing common MREs. LncRNAs act as decoys, signals or guides to play important roles in transcriptional regulation. lethe is upregulated directly by NF-B after stimulation with dexamethasone. lncRNA THRIL, and lncRNA-Cox2 regulate the transcription of TNF- and CCL5 by binding hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) isoforms. lncRNA recruits chromatin remodeling components to specific genomic loci. lncRNA can act as scaffold to recruit chromatin remodeling components. lncRNAs can also regulate expression of neighboring genes in cis. lncRNAs act as miRNA \u201csponges\u201d by sharing common miRNA response elements. green arrows, activate transcription; Red arrows, inhibit transcription. transcriptional regulation LncRNAs also act as decoys, signals or guides. ous RNAs (ceRNAs) vie with mRNAs for miRNAs with shared MREs. cytoplasmic lncRNA acts as a ceRNA for miR-133 and miR-135 to control MEF2C, MAML1 and myoblast differentiation. lncRNAs exert both positive and negative effects on innate immunity.

HIV also utilizes NRON to control the balance between viral reproduction and cell death through the HIV early expressed protein Nef and the late expressed protein Vpu to decrease and increase NRON expression at different infection stages respectively. lncRNA ALT identified lncRNA ALT as an early lytic transcript and a splice isoform of LANA transcript in KSHV infection. 2.7 RNA, the most abundantly transcribed early gene from the HCMV genome in permissive cells, is a 2.7-kb unspliced polyadenylated lncRNA. 2.7 RNA can protect rat aortic endothelial cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis by reduction of reactive oxygen species. sfRNA is a product of incomplete degradation of genomic RNA by the host 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exoribonuclease XRN1 and sfRNA is involved in viral infection and host cell response modulation. production of sfRNA increases replication efficiency of WNVs. production of sfRNA is essential for virus-induced cytotoxicity in cell culture and for viral pathogenicity in mice. a 5-kb immediate-early RNA is a stable intron expressed by human CMV. an HIV-encoded antisense lncRNA without a poly (A) tail was recently discovered. the lncRNA guides a chromatin-remodeling complex consisting of proteins such as DNMT3a, EZH2 and HDAC-1 to the viral promoter driving transcriptional regulation. EBER acts as an autocrine growth factor in BL cells. in BL, EBER counteracts IFN-induced apoptosis via binding to PKR and inhibition of its phosphorylation. expression of host genes linked to T cell activation in virally transformed T cells was up regulated by HSURs 1 and 2. VA RNA binds PKR and blocks PKR activity, avoiding phosphorylation of eIF-2a and inhibition of viral mRNA translation. HBx-LINE1 functions as an lncRNA-like RNA in HBV-positive HCC cell lines, which induces the Wnt pathway by increasing the nuclear localization of -catenin. so far, it remains unknown whether other chimeric lncRNAs are identified. significant differential expression of lncRNAs is induced by virus and regulated by RNA virus or DNA virus infection. these lncRNAs regulate the host innate immune response including the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR)-related signaling, the production of IFNs and cytokines. lncRNA NRAV was down regulated after infection with a DNA virus (HSV) and with RNA viruses (SeV and MDRV) NRAV promotes influenza A virus replication and virulence and negatively regulates the expression of several critical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, OASL, and MxA. ncRNA#32 is 2,946 nt in length and was identified after poly I: C stimulation. overexpression of lncRNA#32 significantly inhibited EMCV replication. lncRNA#32 was involved in anti-viral responses by controlling ISG expression. a mouse lncRNA, NeST (Nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler's, cleanup Salmonella not Therler's) was identified in chromosome10. the transgenic mouse of T cell specific expression of NeST showed that Theiler's virus increased persistence but decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis. this observation was likely due to induction of IFN- coding gene Ifng. virus-encoded lncRNA During virus infection, the host cell generates various lncRNAs to counteract infection. lncRNAs express many lncRNAs to resist cellular antiviral activity. PAN promotes LANA-episome disassociation through an interaction with LANA which facilitates LANA sequestration away from KSHV episomes during latency. the size of lncRNA ALT is large (approximately a 10,000-nucleotide transcript) and its abundance is very low. 2.7 RNA can protect rat aortic endothelial cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis by reduction of reactive oxygen species. the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) is 300\u2013500 nt in length and is derived from the 3\u2032 UTR of the RNA genome of flaviviruses. sfRNA is a product of an incomplete degradation of genomic RNA by the host 5\u2032\u20133 sfRNA generated by the Dengue virus II infection can bind the host proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, and CAPRIN1 and inhibit ISG mRNA translation. production of sfRNA increases the replication efficiency of WNVs and is essential for virus-induced cytotoxicity in cell culture and for viral pathogenicity in mice. an HIV-encoded antisense lncRNA without a poly (A) tail was recently discovered. this lncRNA guides a chromatin-remodeling complex consisting of proteins such as DNMT3a, EZH2 and HDAC-1 to the viral promoter driving transcriptional regulation. several ncRNAs are 200 nt in size, but several are 200 nt in size. the expression of host genes linked to T cell activation in virally transformed T cells was up regulated by HSURs 1 and 2. the expression of host genes linked to T cell activation in virally transformed T cells was up regulated by HSURs 1 and 2. adenovirus VA RNA binds PKR and blocks PKR activity. lncRNAs secreted into the serum may serve as novel biomarkers. lncRNAs secreted into the serum may serve as prognostic markers. lncRNAs secreted into the serum may serve as prognostic markers. lncRNA-UCA1 and lncRNA-WRAP53 were significantly higher in sera of HCC than in chronic HCV infection or healthy volunteers (Kamel et al., 2016). this result suggests that lncRNA-UCA1 and lncRNA-WRAP53 upregulation may serve as novel serum biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis."}
