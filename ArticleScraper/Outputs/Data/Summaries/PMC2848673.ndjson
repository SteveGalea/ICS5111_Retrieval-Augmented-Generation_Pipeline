{"summary": "RVFV is a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. it causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans. in livestock it causes fever and abortion rates. RVFV has a single-stranded, tripartite RNA genome composed of the L, M, and S segments. the single nucleotide substitution in the Gn protein substantially affected the RVFV mouse virulence. RVFV infection results in high mortality and abortion rates in domestic ruminants with severe hepatic diseases. a nonstructural protein, NSs, is translated from viral-sense mRNA. N protein is expressed from anti-viral-sense mRNA. NSs protein suppresses host innate immune functions by suppressing host gene expression [9], including interferon- [10], and promoting PKR degradation [12]. cloned RT-PCR products of intracellular viral-specific RNAs showed sequence homogeneity in all three RNA segments except for nucleotide 847 of the anti-viral sense M segment RNA (M847) of 35 independent, cloned RT-PCR products of a region including M847, 18 clones and 17 clones had A and G, respectively, at M847. rZH501-M847-A and rZH501-M847-G showed similar replication kinetics in both vero cells and MRC-5 cells. titers of rZH501-M847-G were roughly 10 times higher than those of rZH501-M847-A in human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells from 24 h to 72 h p.i. titer of rZH501-M847-G was significantly higher (P0.01) than that of rZH501-M847-A at 72 h p.i. growth curve of ZH501, rZH501-847-A and rZH501-847-A in various cell lines. mice were observed daily for 28 days p.i. no mice died after 14 days p.i.

RT-PCR products of the expected size were obtained from all samples of rZH five-week-old female CD-1 mice were infected i.p. with 105 PFU of rZH501-M847-G or rZH501-M847-A. total RNAs from 3 livers at 4 day p.i., 3 spleens at day 6 p.i., 3 kidneys at day 6 p.i., 3 brains at day 6 p.i., and 3 brains at day 7 rZH501-M847-A-type virus became the major virus population in rZH501-M847-G-infected mice. rZH501-M847-A-type virus became the major virus population in rZH501-M847-G-infected mice. five-week-old female CD-1 mice were infected i.p. with 105 PFU of rZH501-M847-G. liver, spleen and brain were collected every day from day 1 to day 8 p.i. RT-PCR products were obtained from total RNAs in these samples and then subjected to Sac I digestion. rZH501-M847-G was independently passaged five times at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01 and 1 in both cells and MRC-5 cells. RT-PCR products, including M847, were generated from intracellular RNAs, extracted from cells infected with viruses at passage levels 1 and 5. rZH501-M847-A-type virus did not emerge after 5 passages of rZH501-M847-G in both five 5-week-old female CD-1 mice were inoculated i.p. with 101, 102, 103, 104 or 105 PFU of the virus. mice were inoculated with HBSS. Mortality was recorded daily for 28 days p.i. rZH501-M847-A-type virus became a major viral population in mice inoculated with rZH501-M847-G. 38 of 39 isolates from wt RVFV thus far reported were found to have A at M847 and carry Glu277 [19] rZH501-M847-A-type virus probably represented the major virus population in the patient. the rZH501-M847-G-type virus that was present as a minor virus population in the patient could have amplified in cell culture to become a major viral subpopulation in the ZH501 virus stock. the efficient replication of rZH501-M847-A and ZH501 in the liver and in other initial target organs probably induced high viremia titers that facilitated the spread of the virus to other organs. rZH501-M847-A-infected mice showed higher viremia titers than rZH501-M847-G-infected mice at 1-3 days p.i. rZH501-M847-G replicated at a higher titer than did rZH501-M847-A in MRC-5 cells. rZH501-M847-G binds efficiently to GAGs in the the attenuated virus, MP-12, is developed by serial passage of the wt RVFV ZH548 strain in the presence of 5-fluorouracil [27] carries A at M847 and encodes Glu277. the amino acid sequence of the M segment of MP-12 differs from that of rZH501-M847-A by 5 amino acids. rZH501-M847-A and rZH501-M847-G were infected with rZH501-M847-G. rZH501-M847-G was rescued from cDNAs and direct sequencing of the M segment of rZH501-M847-G did not show the presence of rZH501-M847-A-type in the inoculum. rZH501-M rZH501-M847-A-type virus was generated by a point mutation at M847 of the M segment in the rZH501-M847-G-infected mice. it became a major virus population as early as 2 days p.i. this putative phenotype of rZH501-M847-A-type virus may have prevented the efficient elimination of the virus from reticuloendothelial systems. new rZH501-M847-A-type virus failed to replicate efficiently after 5 days p.i. in various organs. rZH501-M847-A-inoculated mice were higher than those inoculated with rZH501-M847-G in many organs during the first 4-5 days p.i. the neutralizing antibody titers tend to be higher in rZH501-M847-G-inocul total RNA of veroE6 cells infected with RVFV ZH501 was used for cDNA synthesis. PCR fragments of full-length, antiviral-sense ZH501 S and L-segments were cloned into a pProT7 plasmid, designated as pProT7-wS(+) and pProT7-wL(+), respectively. rZH501-M847-G, a recombinant ZH501 carrying G at nucleotide 847 of anti-viral-sense M, was recovered by co-transfection of pProT7-wS(+), pProT7-wM(+)-M847-G, pT7-IRES-N, pT7-IRES-L and pCAGGS-G into BHK/T7-9 cells free 5\u2032-phosphates in intracellular RNAs were removed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and then the samples were treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the cap structure. cDNA was synthesized by using an RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using random primers. each cell monolayer was stained by adding 0.6 ml of a second overlay. plaques were enumerated and viral titers were calculated. each mouse was inoculated in a tuberculin syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle. all experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch. the facilities used are fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. cross-neutralization assays anti-rZH501-M847-G serum demonstrating a PRNT80 titer of 1640 to ZH501 was a mixture of the sera collected at days 6, 7 and 8 p.i. from eight rZH501-M847-G-infected mice. convalescent goat anti-ZH501 serum showing a PRNT80 titer of 15,120 to ZH501 served as a positive control. RNA pellets were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 25 min at 4\u00b0C. RNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and dried. RNAs were purified by addition with phenol-chloroform. thirty-five clones were sequenced, or cloned into pSTBlue-1. Specimens for histopathology and IHC examination were collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin. livers, spleens, kidneys, and brains obtained from infected mice and control animals were processed for histopathological and IHC examination. total RNA of veroE6 cells infected with RVFV ZH501 was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. PCR fragments of full-length, antiviral-sense ZH501 S and L-segments were cloned into a pProT7 plasmid [45], designated as pProT7-wS(+) and pProT7-wL(+), respectively. transfection of pProT7-wS(+), pProT7-wM(+)-M847-G, pT7-IRES-N, pT7-IRES-L and pCAGGS-G into BHK/T7-9 cells. transfection of pProT7-wS(+), pProT7-wM(+)-M847-A, pProT7-IRES-N, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA containing a poly A tail. cDNA was subjected to PCR with an adaptor-specific primer. amplicons were subjected to sequence analysis. each cell monolayer was stained with 0.6 ml of a mixture of 1 part 1% agarose and 1 part 2X Eagle's basal medium with Earle's salts, 17 mm HEPES, 8% fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin/ml and 100 g of streptomycin sulfate/ml. after an additional 24 h incubation, plaques were enumerated and viral titers were calculated the facilities used are fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. the facilities used are fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. anti-rZH501-M847-G serum showed a PRNT80 titer of 1640 to ZH501 was a mixture of the sera collected at days 6, 7 and 8 p.i. from eight rZH501-M847-A-infected mice. convalescent goat anti-ZH501 serum showed a PRNT80 titer of 15,120 to ZH501 served as a positive control. ty microliters of RNase-free water was added to dissolve the RNA pellet. the RNAs were then purified by addition with phenol-chloroform. cDNA was synthesized with a random hexamer by RTG YouPrime RXN Beads. ty-five clones were sequenced by T7 primer. livers, spleens, kidneys, and brains obtained from infected mice were processed for histopathological and IHC examination. mice showed pyknotic cells (arrow) in glomeruli (magnification, 600) RVFV antigens were detected by IHC in the glomeruli (C) and blood smooth muscle of interlobular and arcuate arteries (D) mice infected with rZH501-M847-G had encephalitis on day 8 p.i."}
