{"summary": "every year around 150,000 pilgrims from Bangladesh perform Umrah and Hajj. the institute of epidemiology, disease control & research is responsible for MERS-CoV screening of pilgrims/pilgrims returning from the Middle East with respiratory illness. human-to-human transmission has been documented in several clusters among health-care providers and contacts. since 2012, the world health organization (WHO) reported 1841 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases including 652 deaths from 28 countries [9], including 652 deaths from 28 countries. respiratory infections among returning pilgrims were caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses, such as Adeno virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Human metapneumovirus and para influenza viruses. study was conducted in the united kingdom to detect the viral pathogens responsible for respiratory infections. Primers and probes for upstream of the envelope (UpE) and non-structural protein 2 (N2) gene were used. sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assay kit is 100%. reported cases were collected in the sample collection room of IEDCR. samples from hospitalized patients were transported to the IEDCR Virology laboratory. 81 cases included in the study. 0\u201316 years 17\u201365 years >65 years Total (%) Male 0 41 4 45 (55.6%) Female 1 33 2 36 (44.4%) Total 1 (1.2%) 74 (91.4%) 6 (7.4%) 81 (100%) Respiratory virus detection Of all the samples obtained from the 81 patients tested, none was positive for MERS-CoV. male 0 41 4 45 (55.6%) Female 1 33 2 36 (44.4%) Total 1 (1.2%) 6 (7.4%) 81 (100%) Respiratory virus detection Of all the samples obtained from the 81 patients tested, none was positive for MERS-CoV. a viral etiology for clinical illness was found in 29.6% of cases. in the last five years the overall prevalence of influenza virus infection is 11%. the seasonality of influenza infection in KSA is different, beginning in September and peaking in November-December. there was no evidence of MERS-CoV carriage among pilgrims from Bangladesh. many countries, including Bangladesh, have established enhanced surveillance systems. none of the returning pilgrims were detected for MERS-CoV. few sporadic travel-associated MERS-CoV cases have been reported."}
