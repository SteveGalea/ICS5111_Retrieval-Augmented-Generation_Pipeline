{"summary": "the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry. it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. influenza A viruses are classified into 16 HA (H1\u201316) and 9 NA (N1\u20139) subtypes. the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. the HA protein is the antigen of choice for the development of recombinant subunit vaccines to protect against HPAI H5N1. the recombinant HA protein can be highly purified thereby limiting adverse reactions caused by egg contaminants. a baculovirus expression system has been used to produce strain specific HA antigens in insect cells. such full-size HA proteins may be limited in their efficacy because the membrane proteins may not retain their native membrane-bound structure upon purification. recombinant soluble H5 trimers were purified from the culture supernatants using a simple one-step purification protocol. the predicted HA ectodomain protein lacks a multibasic cleavage site. the cDNA was cloned into the pCD5 expression vector for efficient expression in mammalian cells. the vector encodes the soluble trimeric H5 protein designated as sH53. sH53 proteins were purified using a spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Sciences) the concentration of purified protein was determined by using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Sciences) the concentration of purified protein was determined by using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Sciences) one group was immunized twice (on day 21) or twice (on day 0 and 21) by i.m. injection of 10, 2 or 0.4 g sH53 antigen adjuvanted with Stimune. the other group received an equal volume of PBS in Stimune (mock vaccinated) three weeks after the vaccination, the birds were challenged by inoculation with 105 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of A/Viet swabs were taken from each chicken on day 2, 4 and 7 p.i. Vaccination-challenge experiment in mice Female, specified pathogen-free (SPF) mice were immunized once (on day 21) or twice (on day 0 and 21) by i.m. injection (0.2 ml) of 2 g sH53 adjuvanted with Stimune. three weeks after the vaccination, mice were mock vaccinated. trachea and cloaca swabs sampled from same bird on same day pooled. cDNA was synthesized using reverse primer 5\u2032-CACTGGGCACGGTGAGC-3\u2032. part of the M1 gene was amplified by running 45 cycles of PCR. negative and positive control samples were tested in parallel. ELISA Total antibody titers against sH53 were determined by using a sH53-specific ELISA. 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates coated with 0.5 g sH53 per well were incubated with limiting dilutions of chicken or mouse sera. after extensive washing, the plates were incubated with goat-anti-chicken or goat-anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with HRP. the resulting vector encodes the soluble trimeric protein designated as sH53. protein expression and purification pCD5 expression vectors were transfected into HEK293S GnTI()cells [22] using polyethyleneimine I (PEI) in a 15 ratio (g DNA g PEI) at 6 h post transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced by 293 SFM II expression medium (Invitrogen) 1 g/ml fetuin per well was used to coat 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates. sH53 was pre-complexed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-Strep-tag antibody. HA-binding was detected using tetramethylbenzidine substrate. chickens were immunized once (on day 21) or twice (on day 0 and 21) by i.m. injection of 10, 2 or 0.4 g sH53 antigen adjuvanted with Stimune. as a challenge control, one group was mock-vaccinated twice (on day 0 and 21) with PBS. mice were anaesthetized with ketamin/xylazin by intraperitoneal injection. inoculated intranasally with 50 l of H5N1A/Viet nam/1194/04. clinical signs were recorded using a scoring system. negative and positive control samples were tested in parallel. the lower limit of detection was approximately 500 TCID50. some samples gave inconclusive results, meaning that they gave only a very weak signal. peroxidase activity was visualized using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BioFX) and an ELISA reader (EL-808 [BioTEK]) the OD values of the 250-fold diluted samples were plotted. expression, purification, and characterization of sH53 was first cloned into an appropriate expression vector. the bulk of the H5 protein eluted with the velocity of an oligomer. only a minor fraction was found as aggregates in the void volume. the trimeric nature of the H5 oligomer was confirmed using blue-native gel electrophoresis followed by western blotting. the recombinant protein was detected using a mouse anti-Strep-tag antibody. the elution profile of a 232 kDa catalase control is indicated by the line. the position in the gel of the ectodomain species observed after heating of the HA sample prior to electrophoresis is indicated. all mock-vaccinated chickens succumbed within 2 days. none contained antibodies against sH53 as determined by a sH53-specific ELISA. all immunized animals showed appreciable levels of HA antibodies already after a single immunization. blood samples were collected 3 weeks after the first immunization (sH53 1) and 3 weeks after the second vaccination (sH53 2). sH53 antibody levels were determined by ELISA (B), the HI titers against H5N1 (NIBRG-14) (C) and the HI titers against sH53 (D) in serum for each bird. bars represent geometric means per group. of 10 chickens were immunized i.m. with 10, 2 or 0.4 g sH53 either once or twice with 3 weeks interval. one group was mock-treated (PBS) four weeks after the vaccination, all chickens were challenged. the same results as with the ELISA were obtained with the HI assay using sH53 as the hemagglutinating agent. trachea and cloaca swabs were taken from chickens of the vaccine dose titration experiment of Fig. 3 at 2, 4 and 7 days after the challenge inoculation. infection exhibited minimum or no virus shedding in tracheal and cloacal swabs collected from vaccinated chickens after challenge with H5N1. chicken # D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D2 D2 1 b + + + + + + + + 2 groups of 10 mice were vaccinated once (on day 21) or twice (on day 0 and 21) with 2 g of sH53 adjuvanted with Stimune and challenged three weeks later by intranasal inoculation with 10 LD50 of H5N1 A/Viet Nam/1194/04. all mock-vaccinated mice succumbed to infection or had to be euthanized by day 9 p.i. pre-challenge anti-sH53 antibody levels in individual serum samples were determined by ELISA. these antibodies could be detected in most vaccinated animals. but after a single immunization, these levels remained very low compared to those in animals receiving a booster vaccination. expression, purification, and characterization of sH53 In order to express soluble trimeric subtype 5 HA (sH53) in mammalian cells, the H5 ectodomain-coding sequence was first cloned into an appropriate expression vector. the sequence was preceded by a signal peptide-encoding sequence, to allow efficient secretion of the recombinant protein. the trimeric nature of the H5 oligomer was confirmed using blue-native gel electrophoresis followed by western blotting. the initial trimeric HA species dissociated into dimers and monomers. the biological activity of the purified sH53 was studied using a solid phase-binding assay. elution of a 232 kDa catalase control is indicated by the line. the position in the gel of the momomeric, dimeric and trimeric ectodomain species observed after heating of the HA sample prior to electrophoresis is indicated. all immunized animals showed appreciable levels of HA antibodies already after a single immunization. all mock-vaccinated chickens had a HI titer below the detection limit. 50% of the birds developed HI antibody titers equal to 64 or higher already three weeks after the first vaccination. ELISA (B), the HI titers against H5N1 (NIBRG-14) (C) and the HI titers against sH53 (D) determined the lowest antibody levels correlating with protection in this experiment. results prompted us to determine the minimal sH53 dose required to confer protection and to examine whether a single dose could already be sufficient. all chickens were challenged with 105 TCID50 of HPAI H5N1 A/Viet Nam/1194/04. sH53 antibody levels at the day of challenge were determined by ELISA. protection against the lethal challenge correlated well with the observed antibody levels against sH53. trachea and cloaca swabs were taken from chickens of the vaccine dose titration experiment of Fig. 3 at 2, 4 and 7 days after the challenge inoculation. the presence of viral RNA in the pooled swabs was analyzed using a quantitative RT PCR assay detecting the M1 gene. chicken # D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D7 D2 D4 D7 D2 D7 D2 D7 D2 D2 1 b + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 2 groups of 10 mice were vaccinated once (on day 21) or twice (on day 0 and 21) with 2 g of sH53 adjuvanted with Stimune and challenged three weeks later by intranasal inoculation with 10 LD50 of H5N1 A/Viet Nam/1194/04. the percentage of mice surviving the infection, median clinical scores and body weight per group observed after the challenge inoculation are shown in Fig. 4 group of 10 mice were immunized i.m. with 2 g sH53 either once (day 21) or twice with a 3-week interval (day 0 and day 21) mice were infected with 10 LD50 of A/Viet Nam/1194/04 and monitored daily for clinical signs and body weight during the next 14 days. in 2009, HPAI H5N1 was found in wild birds in Germany, China, Mongolia and the Russion Federation. several outbreaks of the virus in poultry were reported in Viet Nam, Hong Kong, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Egypt, Lao DPR, and Cambodia. dozens of confirmed human cases were reported that same year. high-molecular-weight oligomers and trimers were found to induce neutralizing antibodies in mice. this difference was attributed to the preferential induction of antibodies against epitopes present in the monomeric, but not in the trimeric form. sH53 vaccine preparation emulsified from insect cell cultures infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing the H5 gene. a vaccinated flock can pose a barrier against further spread of circulating virus. sHA3 vaccination could be economically feasible in epidemic situations. thal H5N1 challenge after 2 doses resulted in 40% survival. differences in protection levels correlated with the observed anti-sH53 titers in the animals' sera. the reason for this apparent discrepancy is unclear and warrants further investigations. pandemic influenza viruses."}
