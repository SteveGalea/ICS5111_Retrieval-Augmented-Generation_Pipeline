{"summary": "early detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is feasible. recombinant antigens were generated using recombinant DNA techniques to fuse PRRSV structural protein (N) or nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) with the Rellina luciferase gene. fused genes were cloned into plasmids and transfected into HEK-293 T cells. antibodies specific for nsp1 were detected at higher levels overall, but were undetectable until 10 dpi. one IDEXX ELISA positive result was not confirmed by LACA or IFA."}
