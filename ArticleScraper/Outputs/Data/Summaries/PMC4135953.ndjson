{"summary": "inactivated whole inactivated virions induce neutralizing antibodies in mouse models (5\u201310) but also cause increased eosinophilic immunopathology in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. 80% of immunized children were hospitalized and died of enhanced respiratory disease upon subsequent RSV infection. the pathology of enhanced respiratory disease upon subsequent RSV infection is thought to be due to skewing of the immune response toward Th2. the generation of nonprotective antibodies by the FI-RSV vaccine may have been due to poor Toll-like receptor stimulation (18). thus, TLR stimulation with an inactivated whole virion vaccine is thought to be crucial to induce protective antibodies. UV-V was amplified in vero E6 cells, exposed to UV light (4.75 J/cm2) and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. inactivation of UV-V was confirmed upon inoculation into vero E6 cells. the animals were subsequently inoculated in the left nostril with 106.5 TCID50 of F-musX in 30 l. the animals were 1,000-fold higher than the 50% lethal dose for adult mice. a second vaccination experiment was performed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of TLR. inflammatory profiling of 10% (wt/vol) lung homogenates was performed using the milliplex Map assay (Millipore, MA) these assays can determine the concentrations of 18 cytokines and chemokines, including eotaxin. the presence of a viral cytopathic effect was determined on day 3. lowest and highest serum dilutions tested were 1:2 and 1:512. RNA was extracted from the lung samples using RNeasy minikits. eosinophils were identified with a C.E.M. kit using astra blue/Vital New Red staining. five 240-m2 sections in the extrabronchioles were assessed. eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages counted were averaged. whole lungs were collected from mice 1 day after challenge with F-musX. lungs were removed aseptically, cut into 1-mm pieces, and incubated in HEPES buffer. single-cell suspensions were prepared by gently pushing the tissue through a 70-m nylon screen. 1 105 cells in 100 l of PBS-FBS were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min onto glass slides using a Shandon cytocentrifuge. cells were stained with Giemsa stain and analyzed by microscopy. RNA samples with the highest RNA integrity number, of more than 7, were used for microarray analysis. two hundred micrograms (lung tissue) or 25 g (CD11b+ cells) of total RNAs was used for amplification. individual cRNA samples were fragmented by incubation with fragmentation buffer and blocking agent at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. CD11b+ cell samples were classified into four groups based on the treatment regimen. six mice each were infected with F-musX and immunized with UV-V or UV-V+TLR. all data are presented as the mean per group. fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin G, and 50 g/ml streptomycin. stocks of the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV, F-musX-VeroE6 (F-musX) were propagated and titrated on Vero E6 cells. the agonists consisted of 1 g lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 2.5 g poly(IC) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and 0.1 g poly(U) per immunization. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg ketamine and 0.02 mg xylazine in 0.1 ml/10 mice were sacrificed 3 or 10 days after challenge to analyze virus replication, hematology, cytokine expression, and pathology. 10% (wt/vol) tissue homogenates of each lung were prepared in MEM containing 2% FBS, 50 IU/ml penicillin G, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 g/ml amphotericin B. alpha and beta IFN (IFN- and-) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to detect IFN-4, IFN-, and SARS-CoV mRNA. blood was obtained from the tail vein of each mouse and allowed to clot. the expression of each gene was normalized relative to that of -actin mRNA, with the expression of IFN-4 and IFN- mRNAs calculated as the log10 fold change relative to results with PBS-injected and challenged mice. phosphate-buffered formalin injected into the trachea until the lungs inflated. fixed lung tissues were routinely embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages were averaged per lung. cell suspensions were washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS (PBS-FBS), counted, and incubated at the appropriate ratio with MACS CD11b microbeads. cells were separated by passing the antibody-coated cell suspension over an MS-positive selection column on a magnetic cell separator. microarray analysis was performed using left lung lobe tissue samples and CD11b+ cells in the lung, as described previously (22). RNA concentrations were measured with an ND-1000 spectrophotometer. RNA samples with the highest RNA integrity number, of more than 7, were used for microarray analysis. the images were analyzed using the Feature Extraction software program (Agilent) the data files were automatically exported into GeneSpring. the raw data were normalized per chip to the 75th percentile expression level and per gene to the median expression intensity of all samples. 11 mice per group were immunized with UV-V and challenged 10 days after boosting with the live virus. one mouse immunized with UV-V and one immunized with UV-V+Alum died on day 5. titers of virus in lung wash fluid on day 3 did not differ significantly among UV-V-immunized, UV-V+Alum-immunized and PBS+Alum-injected mice. the serum titers of neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in UV-V+Alum- than in UV-V-immunized mice (n = 11 each) but did not differ significantly after challenge. eosinophil infiltration was more severe on day 10 than on day 3 in UV-V- and UV-V+Alum-immunized mice. the virus neutralization titers in the sera on the day prior to virus challenge were 1:4 and 1:128 in the UV-V- and UV-V+Alum-immunized mice. however, these mice were unable to survive following SARS-CoV infection. we assumed that the severe respiratory illness in the dead mice was caused by an exacerbation of pulmonary inflammatory reactions due to UV-V acting as an inactivated RSV vaccine. significant differences (P 0.05, one-way ANOVA) between groups are marked with an asterisk. numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils in lung sections were examined at magnification 40. the mock-vaccinated mouse (PBS+Alum) (E, inset, and D) showed eosinophilic inflammatory reactions. no viral antigen-positive cells were present in the lungs. ated mice on days 3 and 10 after challenge showed mild perivascular and peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltration. most of these infiltrating cells were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils, and there were no cells positive for viral antigens in the lungs. the lung pathology of these control mice was similar to that of PBS+Alum-injected mice following challenge with SARS-CoV. significant between-group differences are marked with an asterisk. numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils in lung sections are marked with an asterisk. inactivated RSV vaccine-induced pulmonary disease was resolved by the addition of TLR agonists in an RSV mouse model (18). the effects of TLR agonists as an adjuvant during immunization with UV-V. by day 10, body weight of all mice had recovered to that before immunization, and no mice had died. tokine and chemokine responses were assessed in lung homogenates of UV-V and UV-V+TLR-immunized mice on days 3 and 10. levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and eotaxin eotaxin (CCL11) were lower in UV-V+TLR- than in UV-V-immunized mice on day 3 and 10. significant differences (P 0.05, one-way ANOVA) between groups are marked with an asterisk. the dashed line indicates the limit of detection (101.5 TCID50/ml). Error bars indicate standard deviations. IFN- gene expression in the lungs was significantly higher in UV-V+TLR- and UV-V+TLR-immunized mice on day 1. the viral copy number in the lungs of these mice did not differ significantly. ELISAs showed that IFN- and - in UV-V- and UV-V+TLR-immunized mice were below the limits of detection 3 and 10 days after challenge. type I IFN mRNAs and SARS-CoV genome were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. results are expressed as log10 fold change from results for mock-vaccinated, challenged mice. +TLR-immunized mice seroconverted to produce sufficient neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV infection. both short- and long-interval UV-V-immunization caused eosinophil infiltration in the lungs after challenge. adult female mice were vaccinated with UV-V or UV-V+TLR or mock vaccinated. gene expression profiling was performed using total RNAs from the lungs of mice immunized with UV-V, UV-V+TLR, PBS (as a mock vaccination), or HKU39849 (mimicking live attenuated vaccine) a total of 242 genes were differentially regulated between UV-V and UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. genes upregulated in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice included those associated with signaling of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-1 and -2. this network was constructed by including the 242 genes differentially regulated between UV-V- and UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. the gene encoding IL-4 is at the center of this network. most genes associated with \u201cinflammation of the lungs\u201d were unchanged or downregulated in UV-V-immunized mice compared with expression in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. expression of genes related to Th2 responses, especially IL-4, had a key role in the excess eosinophilic immunopathology observed in the lungs of UV-V-immunized mice. the heat map was generated using the software program GeneSpring GX 12.1. uncentered Pearson correlation was used as the distance metric with average linkage for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. 3E2 Eosinophil 2E2 to 1E2 Responses to pathogen 1E4 to 2E2 Th2 NSa a NS, not significant. diagrams show the TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways. genes downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling were upregulated in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice (B) a network for TLR7 could not be built from these data. the network involving TLR3, TLR4 and poly(IC) consisted of 37 genes. these genes were associated with cellular movement, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking and infectious disease. CD11b+ cells from UV-V-immunized mice showed much more robust regulation of genes in this network than cells from UV-V-immunized mice. however, several of these genes have also been implicated in eosinophil migration and eosinophilia of the airways. IPA analysis revealed that these genes were also upregulated in CD11b+ cells from the lungs of UV-V-immunized mice. titers of virus in lung wash fluid on day 3 were significantly lower in UV-V+Alum-immunized mice compared with expression in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice (F). titers of virus in lung wash fluid on day 3 were significantly lower in UV-V+Alum-immunized mice compared with in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. mice showed high levels of eosinophil infiltration around the bronchi. lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few neutrophils had infiltrated into the lungs. eosinophil infiltration was more severe on day 10 than on day 3 in UV-V and UV-V+Alum-immunized mice. mice were vaccinated with UV-V, UV-V with alum, or vehicle (PBS with Alum, PBS+Alum) and subsequently challenged with 1,000 TCID50 of F-musX. mice showed severe pulmonary edema, congestion, and hemorrhage, with many viral antigen-positive cells. serum samples were serially diluted beginning at 1:2. Error bars indicate standard deviations. numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils in lung sections. pulmonary edema with mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in the mock-vaccinated mouse (PBS+Alum) (E, inset) cells positive for viral antigen were seen throughout the lung (F). hematoxylin-and-eosin (magnification, 10) and C.M.E kit (inset; magnification, 100) staining, a reliable and specific stain for eosinophils (A, C 39849-inoculated mice showed mild perivascular and peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltration on days 3 and 10 after the challenge. most of these infiltrating cells were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils, and there were no cells positive for viral antigens in the lungs. in contrast, MEM-treated control mice showed severe respiratory illness and weight loss after F-musX infection and succumbed to infection within 5 days. serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted beginning at 1:2. Error bars indicate standard deviations. numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils in lung sections. UV-V+TLR-immunized mice developed a clinical illness, characterized by weight loss, hunching, and ruffled fur. by day 10, the body weight of all mice had recovered to that before immunization. survival rates, weight loss, and clinical illness of mice did not differ significantly. eosinophil-related chemokine eotaxin (CCL11) were lower in UV-V+TLR- than in UV-V-immunized mice on day 3 and 10. the levels of IP-10 (CXCL10) and KC (CXCL1) tended to be higher in UV-V+TLR- than in UV-V-immunized mice on day 3 and 10. the dashed line indicates the limit of detection (101.5 TCID50/ml) Error bars indicate standard deviations. immunoization with UV-V plus TLR agonists induces IFN- gene expression. Stimulation of TLRs-3,-4, and -7 by TLR agonists induces type I IFNs. the induction of these type I IFNs is the most immediate antiviral host response to many viral infections (25) a second vaccine experiment was performed to evaluate the long-term antiviral efficacy of UV-V+TLR. fourteen mice per group were immunized with UV-V and UV-V+TLR. eosinophil infiltration in the lungs was lower on day 10 than on day 3. adult female mice were vaccinated with UV-V or UV-V+TLR. subsequently challenged with 1,000 TCID50 of F-musX. eosinophilic immune pathology in mice after long-term challenge. UV-V-immunized mice showed high expression of genes related to Th2 responses in the lungs after challenge. gene expression profiling was performed using total RNAs from the lungs of mice immunized with UV-V, UV-V+TLR, or HKU39849 (mimicking live attenuated vaccine) genes upregulated in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice included those associated with signaling of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-1 and -2. a functional analysis approach was used to construct a graphic network of biologically related genes derived from IPA. this network was constructed by including the 242 genes differentially regulated between UV-V and UV-V+TLR-immunized mice. antimicrobial peptide (CAMP), coagulation factor X enzyme (F10), inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, kinase epsilon (IKBKE), interleukin 15 receptor alpha (IL-15RA), IL-4, plasminogen activator, tissue (PLAT), spleen focus-forming virus proviral integration oncogene (SPI1), and TRAF family member-associated NF a gene interaction network including 39 genes was constructed from 242 genes connected by IPA software. the solid and dotted lines indicate direct and indirect interactions. network 1 was composed of genes associated with eosinophilia. the diagrams show the TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways. genes downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling were upregulated in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice (B) compared with expression in UV-V-immunized mice (A) network involving TLR3, TLR4 and poly(IC) consisted of 37 genes. many of these genes were associated with cellular movement, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking, inflammatory response, and infectious disease. eosinophil migration and eosinophilia of the airways have also been implicated in eosinophil migration and eosinophilia of the airways. genes downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling were upregulated in UV-V-immunized mice (C) compared with expression in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice (F). ION This study describes vaccine immunization with attenuated live and inactivated vaccines and virus challenge using adult mice and mouse-passaged SARS-CoV. this model is useful in the evaluation of efficacies and side effects of vaccine candidates. UV-V failed to inhibit viral infection and replication within the lungs on day 3. this was one cause of death after subsequent SARS-CoV infection. results consistent with studies of vaccine formulations incorporating SARS-CoV N protein and also SARS-CoV doubly inactivated with formalin and UV irradiation. eosinophilia is a hallmark of an aberrant hypersensitivity response to FI-RSV. a study using eosinophil-deficient mice found that eosinophils did not contribute to RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary disease (44) eosinophils did not promote virus clearance (45) vaccination with UV-V was unable to generate effective immunity against SARS-CoV infection because of poor TLR stimulation. intranasal injection of the TLR agonist poly(IC) into aged mice provided a high level of protection against SARS-CoV infection. the type I IFNs play an important role in the innate immune response. higher IFN- gene expression in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice may also contribute to the production of Th1 cytokines after viral infection. vaccination with UV-inactivated whole virions plus TLR agonists provides protection against SARS-CoV infection without strong Th2 skewing. several are currently in preclinical development for use as vaccine adjuvants (55)."}
