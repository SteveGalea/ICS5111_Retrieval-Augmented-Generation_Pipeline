{"summary": "type I interferons, such as alpha interferon (IFN-) and IFN-, play a critical role in antiviral innate immunity. the detection of an invading virus activates host protein signaling cascades. this leads to the formation of transcriptionally competent enhanceosomes in the cell nucleus to induce the expression of type I IFNs. antiviral molecules RIG-I, JAK-1, STAT1, PKR, and MXA were determined to be targets for ISG15 conjugation. vaccinia virus NS1 protein targets the E1 enzyme, which subsequently prevents ISG15 conjugation. replicase gene covers the 5\u2032-proximal three quarters of the viral genome. together, ORF1a and ORF1b encode two long replicase polyproteins. nsp2 is the largest cleavage product, which is released by the autoproteolytic activity of the upstream nsp1\u00df toward the nsp1\u00df/2 site. mutants support an important role for the antiviral activity of ISG15 in PRRSV infection and may represent a first step toward engineering a modified live virus lacking the immune antagonist function of nsp2. the type I PRRSV strain SD01-08 and its nsp2 mutants were used to infect MARC-145 cells or PAMs. flag-ISG15-R was cloned into the p3xFlag vector (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) to generate the p3xFlag-ISG15 plasmid. the plasmid containing the LRLRGG-to-LRLRAA mutation is designated p3xFlag-ISG15AA. cells were stained with the PRRSV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) SDOW17. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody. cDNA clone pCMV-SD01-08 was modified from pSD01-08 plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis. cell monolayer was lysed in Laemmli sample buffer for Western blot analysis. IRDye 680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and/or IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were added. the blot was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and overnight at 4\u00b0C. corresponding deletion or mutation was introduced into the nsp2 region of a PRRSV infectious cDNA clone, pCMV-SD01-08. each mutant was constructed in both the pCAGGS expression vector and in PRRSV full-length cDNA clone pCMV-SD01-08. luciferase reporter assay performed according to manufacturer's instructions. reporter plasmid p125-Luc expresses firefly luciferase under the control of a simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. RNA was extracted from cells infected with passage 10 of the recombinant virus. nsp2 mutants and parental virus were infected with a 10-fold serially diluted parental or mutant virus. cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. sp2-3-CD19+1S plasmids were transiently expressed in sp2-3-CD19+1S cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase expression system. proteins synthesized in transfected cells were labeled from 5 to 8 h after vaccinia virus infection. the first strand of ISG15 cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer and a super Script III reverse transcriptase kit. the PCR product was cloned into the p3xFlag vector to generate the p3xFlag-ISG15 plasmid. the plasmid containing the LRLRGG-to-LRLRAA mutation is designated p3xFlag-ISG15AA. 0.6 g of the p3xFlag-ISG15 or control empty vector plasmid. cells in one of the parallel wells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. cells in another parallel well were infected with PRRSV strain SD01-08. cells were seeded in six-well plates at 4 105 cells 1 day prior to transfection. cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-UbE1L (E1), p3xFlag-UbcH8 (E2), pcDNA-TAP-HA-HERC5 (E3) and p3xFlag-ISG15AA. cell lysates were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membrane was blocked with PBST (1 phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] in 0.05% Tween 20) and nonfat dry milk. bda Biotech, St. Louis, MO, was used to detect -tubulin expression. each protein lane on the Western blot was normalized to that of -tubulin. each individual deletion or mutation was introduced into expression vector pCAGGS-nsp2(386\u2013578) each mutant was constructed in both the pCAGGS expression vector and in PRRSV full-length cDNA clone pCMV-SD01-08. the CD23, CD19, and CD19+1S mutations were also transferred to the pLnsp2-3 plasmid backbone. Sendai virus was used to stimulate cells at 24 h posttransfection. at 16 h poststimulation, cells were lysed and analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. values for each sample were normalized using the Renilla luciferase values. pLnsp2-3-CD23, pLnsp2-3-CD19, and pLnsp2-3-CD19+1S plasmids were transiently expressed in RK-13 cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase expression system. RIP was performed using a rabbit antiserum recognizing both nsp2 and nsp3 (26), and precipitated proteins were separated by SDS western blot analysis with anti-Flag antibody detected an immunoreactive band corresponding to a size of about 18 kDa. the ISG15 expression level correlated well with the initial transfection dose of pFlag-ISG15 plasmid DNA. the cells were subsequently infected with PRRSV, which revealed that overexpression of ISG15 inhibited virus replication. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody. pictures were taken with an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope. we further studied the effect of ISGylation on viral replication in more detail. cells were transfected with a cDNA clone, pCMV-SD01-08. at 24 h posttransfection, cells and culture supernatant were harvested. progeny virus titers were reduced about 10-fold in cells expressing wild-type ISG15 and conjugation enzymes. s, and virus titers were expressed as numbers of fluorescent-focus units per milliliter (FFU/ml) PRRSV inhibits ISG15 production and ISGylation. membranes were harvested at 12, 24, 36, or 48 hpi and analyzed by Western blotting. membranes were probed with a specific MAb to nsp1 or tubulin (loading control) or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to swine ISG15. membranes were probed with a specific MAb to nsp1 or nsp1. PRRSV nsp2 inhibits ISG15 production and ISGylation. nsp2 was previously identified as a major immune antagonist. previous studies showed the nsp2 PLP2-DUB domain inhibits IFN- production. anti-ISG15 MAb was used to detect ISG15 expression. anti-nsp2 MAb was used to detect expression of nsp2(386\u2013578) cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNAs expressing conjugation enzymes E1/E2/E3, ISG15, and nsp2(386-578) lated proteins were analyzed (compare lanes 3 and 4), which confirmed that the PLP2-DUB domain has the ability to counteract ISGylation. if the PLP2-DUB domain were to affect any step(s) in this pathway, we expect to see a reduced level of (free) ISG15 in the cells. however, such a difference was not observed. a 19-aa region of nsp2, 402-DSALAPKIAPPVPTCGITT-420, was targeted for deletion. this region is located immediately upstream of the conserved core of the PLP2-DUB domain (47), may contribute to the binding of substrates like ubiquitin and ISG15 (1). this region was previously found to be nonessential for viral replication (20) mutants showed reduced inhibition of luciferase reporter gene expression. the CD23 deletion largely impaired the ability of the PLP2-DUB domain to inhibit IFN- activation. mutants were transferred to a PRRSV full-length cDNA clone. luciferase activity is defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase reporter activity to Renilla luciferase activity. each data point represents a mean value from three experiments. recombinant viruses were serially passaged 10 times in MARC-145 cells. vSD-CD19 and vSD-CD19+1S were impaired in growth in MARC-145 cells. peak viral titer for vSD-CD19 was 1.8 106 FFU/ml. vSD-CD19+1S maintained a very low titer throughout the time course experiment. pCAGGS-CD19 and pCAGGS-CD19+1S were expressed in HeLa cells. the pCAGGS-CD23 construct was also included as a control. all three mutants showed a certain degree of impairment in their ability to inhibit ISG15 expression. expression of ISG15 and nsp2(386\u2013578) was analyzed by Western blot. anti-iSG15 MAb was used to detect the expression of ISG15. nsp2-3) and 23-aa deletion mutant (pLnsp2-3-CD23) were also included in the analysis. the different nsp2-3 polyproteins were expressed by transfection of plasmid DNA into cells previously infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus. expression and cleavage of nsp2-3 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. plasmids were expressing wild-type or mutant nsp2-3 polyproteins. expression products were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit antiserum. the positions of the nsp2-3 precursor and its cleavage products are indicated on the right. MARC-145 cells were transfected with different doses of control vector or p3xFLAG-ISG15 plasmid DNA for 48 h. cells were infected with different doses of control vector or p3xFLAG-ISG15 plasmid DNA for 24 h. plasmids expressing wild-type ISG15 and three conjugation enzymes were detected. no ISGylated proteins were detected in cells transfected with a cDNA clone. progeny virus titers in the cell culture supernatant were reduced about 10-fold in cells expressing wild-type ISG15. BHK-21 cells were transfected with plasmids that express conjugation enzymes E1/E2/E3 and Flag-tagged ISG15 or ISG15 mutant (ISG15AA) plasmid p3xFlag was used as a negative control. at 6 h posttransfection, cells were transfected with the infectious PRRSV cDNA clone pCMV-SD01-08. levels were measured at 36 hpi and 48 hpi respectively. the amount of PRRSV nsp1 continuously increased in virus-infected cells. the results suggest that PRRSV employs a mechanism to inhibit ISG15 expression. we did not detect any ISG15-conjugated proteins in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. however, we were also not able to detect ISGylated cellular proteins upon stimulation of uninfected MARC-145 cells with type I IFNs. nsp2 was previously identified as a major immune antagonist (3, 17, 49) cells were transfected with plasmid pCAGGS-nsp2(386\u2013578) and then stimulated by seV infection. a 2.9-fold reduction of the ISG15 level was observed when nsp2(386\u2013578)-expressing cells were compared to cells transfected with empty vector plasmid DNA. the anti-tubulin antibody was used to detect the expression of -tubulin. the effect of PRRSV PLP2-DUB expression on host protein ISGylation was further investigated. nsp2 has the ability to inhibit ISG15 expression and ISGylation of cellular proteins. we constructed a panel of PRRSV mutants with a deletion and/or mutation at the N-terminal border of the predicted PLP2-DUB domain. a 19-aa region of nsp2, 402-DSALAPKIAPPVPTCGITT-420, was targeted for deletion. the 19-aa deletion was combined with the previously identified S462A and D465A mutations that previously yielded viable recombinant viruses. the resulting panel of nsp2 mutants was expressed using the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS and then screened using a previously described IFN- promoter-luciferase reporter assay (6, 49) each mutant showed reduced inhibition of luciferase reporter gene expression. lethal effect of mutations extending upstream of the initial 19-aa deletion could be due to interference with cleavage of the nsp1/2 junction. luciferase activity measured at 16 h poststimulation. vSD-CD19 plaques are smaller than those of wild-type virus. vSD-CD19+1S is barely able to induce plaque formation. cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in cells infected with vSD-CD19 and wild-type virus at 72 hpi. at 2 h postinfection, medium was removed and an agar overlay was applied. cells were stained using 0.1% crystal violet. the amount of virus produced at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h postinfection was determined. the CD23 deletion mutants almost lost the ability to interfere with ISGylation. this property was clearly impaired in the CD19 and CD19+1S mutants. the PLP2-DUB domain is a cysteine protease responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the nsp2/3 site, a critical step in arterivirus replicase polyprotein processing. the nsp2/3-coding region containing CD19 or CD19+1S was expressed in a vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase system. nsp2-3-CD19 and nsp2-3-CD19+1S mutants detected efficient cleavage of the nsp2/3 site. the result indicates that the proteolytic function of PLP2 with regard to the nsp2/3 site is not directly affected in the mutants CD19 and CD19+1S. this suggests that the reduced growth rate (viral titer) of the vSD-CD19 and vSD-CD19+1 viruses defect in production of ISG15 are hyperresponsive to infection by influenza A and B virus, herpesviruses, and Sindbis virus (28). in this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of ISG15 and ISGylation of cellular proteins also interferes with PRRSV replication. previous studies showed that PRRSV infection suppresses or delays immune gene expression. we were not able to detect the ISGylated cellular proteins upon stimulation of uninfected MARC-145 cells by type I IFNs. previous studies showed that type I IFN stimulation did not induce ISGylation in vero and 293T cells. the PRRSV nsp2 protease targets at least two pathways of the host immune response. it interferes with the ubiquitination of signaling molecules in the IFN- production pathway, such as IkB-, resulting in the suppression of IFN- expression and reduced activation of the downstream JACK-STAT pathway. the challenge now is to apply the above findings in disease control and prevention. vSD-CD19 grew to a peak titer slightly lower than that of the parental virus, while vSD-CD19+1S was seriously impaired in cell culture. vSD-CD19+1S was passaged 10 times in cell culture, but its titer remained low (1 103 FFU/ml in MARC-145 cells) the recombinant virus with a single S462A mutation showed a 1.5-fold reduction in the ability of nsp2 to suppress NF-B activation. this reduction was not as significant as we hoped. in the present study, we investigated whether combining this deletion with the S462A mutation might produce a synergistic effect in reducing the innate immune antagonist function of PLP2-DUB. CD19+1S mutant showed reduced ability to suppress innate immune responses. results suggest virus-specific immunity could be enhanced by modifying certain regions within or upstream of the PLP2-DUB domain. follow-up studies are required to determine whether such recombinant viruses could enhance the PRRSV-specific immune response in animals."}
