{"summary": "a series of experts and committees recommended that a faster and larger international financial response to outbreaks be part of pandemic risk mitigation. the world bank offered to provide a financial solution to support global pandemic preparedness and complement the work of the global health security agenda. but the involvement is more than an act of charity. the bank announced the creation of the PEF, a health insurance scheme for the world\u2019s poorest countries. it should provide insurance coverage of initially up to $500m to countries eligible for support from the international development association. this coverage may seem low, both because it is only 0.8% of the bank\u2019s 2016 financial commitments worth $64.2bn and because the bank only pays for parts of it itself. the size of an outbreak, measured in number of cases or of deaths, must be considerable. outbreak growth must be fast (eg, an increase of confirmed cases from 2000 to 5000 within a month) spread of the outbreak must be broad (eg, two or more countries must be affected) investors will be given the option of buying \"pandemic catastrophe bonds\" if the insurance window is not paid out, they lose part of the invested capital. donors are meant to pay them an annual interest (acoupon) via the bank\u2019s treasury. the bank estimates that at a targeted maximum coverage of $500m for three years, annual interest payments should be in the range of $55m-$65m. the bank has provided a hypothetical example for how the PEF would work during an Ebola outbreak. the following day, $140m could be paid out from the insurance and the cash window. potential donors will need to assess whether the insurance premiums and bond coupons they are supposed to pay for risk coverage are justified. this assessment relies on risk calculations based on data established in the bond and insurance market of natural catastrophes. a financial market for pandemic risk management may replace the boom and bust cycles of donor willingness to give with the willingness of finance professionals to invest. risk analysts and investors will incorporate the opinions of healthcare practitioners into their market assessments. people in the world\u2019s poorest countries who will be considered \u201ccovered\u201d by the PEF once it is active might want to know how their coverage operates. the bank risks creating a financial mechanism that is inefficient and opaque. this points to the wider tensions between the immediate pursuit of profit and the goal of providing healthcare to the world\u2019s poorest people. key messages The world bank\u2019s interest in \u201cglobal public goods\u201d reflects its role as an international financial institution active in global health."}
