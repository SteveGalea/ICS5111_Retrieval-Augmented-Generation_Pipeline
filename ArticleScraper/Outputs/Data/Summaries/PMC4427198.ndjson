{"summary": "MERS-CoV causes severe pneumonia reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003. cases of MERS-CoV exhibit a higher mortality rate than those of SARS-CoV (approximately 40% versus 10%) coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, share a common organization of their polycistronic positive-strand RNA genomes. a longer polyprotein (pp1ab) is the product of a ribosomal frameshift that joins ORF1a together with ORF1b. 3CLpros are chymotrypsin-like proteases except that they use cysteine as the nucleophile in a catalytic dyad instead of serine in a catalytic triad. a catalytically inactive variant (C148A) of MERS-CoV 3CLpro in three different crystal forms provides distinct biological insights. the 3CLpro gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a cDNA clone constructed using total RNA isolated from MERS-CoV Jordan. to construct the catalytically inactive C148A variant, a protease amplicon was first used as a PCR template with primers PE2635 (5\u2032-GGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA ATG TCA CAT-3\u2032) pDN2551, an expression vector encoding a TEV protease-cleavable hexahistidine tag preceding MERS-CoV 3CLpro (residues 1\u2013306; C148A) the protein was produced in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta 2(DE3) (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 m polyethersulfone membrane. it was applied onto a 5 ml HisTrap FF column equilibrated with buffer A. the column was washed to baseline with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole to 500 mM in buffer A. a molar extinction coefficient of 43 890 M 1 cm1 was derived using the ExPASy ProtParam tool. the molecular weight of the product was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. crystal form III was cryoprotected by transferring a crystal into a new drop consisting of well solution supplemented with 20%(v/v) polyethylene glycol 200, soaking for 1 min and flash-cooling by plunging into liquid nitrogen. crystal forms I and III were retrieved directly from the crystallization drop using a LithoLoop (Molecular Dimensions) 360 images were collected with an exposure time of 180 s per image. an oscillation angle of 0.5\u00b0 and a crystal-to-detector distance of 150 mm. all X-ray diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL-3000. a large region of well defined 2mF o DF c and mF o DF c electron-density features for protein residues adjacent to residues 11\u2013190 of chain C. residues 191\u2013306 of chain C, corresponding to domain III of MERS-CoV 3CLpro, had undergone a large rigid-body movement. another round of molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP by fixing the positions of chains A, B and residues 11\u2013 the 3CLpro gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a cDNA clone constructed using total RNA isolated from MERS-CoV Jordan. the product of the reaction was amplified in a second PCR with primers PE277 (5\u2032-GGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA AAA GCA GGC TCG GAG AAC CTG TAC TCT GC-3\u2032) pDN2551, an expression vector encoding a TEV protease-cleavable hexahistidine tag preceding MERS-CoV 3CLpro (residues 1\u2013306;

Anand et al., 2002 ). the main-chain amide N atom of Gln306 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl O atom of Gln167 (3.0 ). residue Ser1 from protomer A also forms analogous hydrogen-bond interactions with Glu169 in protomer B. the active site of protomer A (crystal form II, C atoms in gray) is nestled into a hydrophobic pocket. hydrogen-bonding interactions between the backbone amide N atom of Val304 and the backbone carbonyl O atom of Glu169 contribute additional stabilizing inter\u00adactions. the residue, Val303, is bound to the S4 site, which is formed by residues Gln192\u2013Gln195, Met168, Glu169 and Leu170. the core chymotrypsin-like part (domains I and II) of protomer C aligns well with those of protomers A or B. when domains I and II of the three protomers are aligned then domain III of protomer C occupies a very different position than it does in protomers A or B. if domain III of protomer C are superimposed then they align well (r.m.s.d. of 1.1 over 98 C-atom pairs; residues cyan, domain III magenta, the oxyanion loop (residues 143\u2013148) blue and the oxyanion loop (residues 143\u2013148) blue. the four molecules found in the asymmetric unit of crystal form II exist as two canonical homodimers. the C-terminal tail of protomer C is inserted into the active site of protomer A. the entire linker region in the IBV-CoV homolog could be modeled into electron density, whereas MERS-CoV 3CLpro residues 194\u2013196 are disordered. however, there is a significant shift in the orientation of domain III between the two homologs. prior studies of monomeric forms of other 3CLpro enzymes revealed that there is very little or no activity in this state. truncations of the linker loop between the chymotrypsin-like domain and domain III gave rise to a significant reduction in enzymatic activity. three different crystal forms (I, II and III) of catalytically inactive (C148A) MERS-CoV 3CLpro provide a structural view of three distinct states of the enzyme. data-collection and refinement statistics for all three crystal forms are reported in Table 1. values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. 0.2 0.2 0.3 PDB entry 4wmd 4wme 4wmf R merge =, where I(hkl) is the mean intensity of multiply recorded reflections. there are three protomers in the asymmetric unit of crystal form I. C-terminal residues Met301\u2013Gln306 correspond to the P6\u2013P1 sites of the auto\u00adprocessed product of the mature enzyme. a significant shift in the orientation of domain III in protomer C in crystal form III represents a crystallographic monomer, as it does not form a homodimer. MERS-CoV and BatCoV-HKU4 3CLpro homodimers yield an r.m.s.d. of 0.8 over 552 C-atom pairs. r.m.s.d. of 1.9 over 258 C-atom pairs. r.m.s.d. is 2.2 over 537 C-atom pairs. mers of MERS-CoV 3CLpro (crystal form II, green ribbons) and BatCoV-HKU4 (PDB entry 2yna, red ribbons) sequence alignment of CoV 3CLpro enzymes from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4, Human coronavirus HKU1, Human coronavirus OC43, Human coronavirus NL63 and human coronavirus 229 the side chain of Gln306 is held tightly in the S1 pocket near the catalytic dyad formed by his41 and Ala148 (Cys148 in the wild-type enzyme; Anand et al., 2002 ). the side chain of Gln306 is held tightly in the S1 pocket near the catalytic dyad formed by his41 and Ala148 (Cys148 in the wild-type enzyme; anand et al., residue Ser1 from protomer A forms analogous hydrogen-bond interactions with Glu169 in protomer B. residues 301\u2013306 of protomer D (crystal form II, C atoms in magenta) superimposed onto active site of protomer A (crystal form II, C atoms in gray) the side chain of Val303 is bound to the S4 site, which is formed by residues Gln192\u2013Gln195, Met168, Glu169 and Leu170. the side chain of Val303 stacks against the hydrophobic side chain of Leu170. the core chymotrypsin-like part (domains I and II) of protomer C aligns well with those of protomers A or B (r.m.s.d. of 0.6 over 163 C-atom pairs; residues 11\u2013190) but their chymotrypsin-like domains appear to have shifted relative to one another. if domain III of protomer C are superimposed then they align well (r.m.s.d. of 1.1 over domains I and II colored gray, the linker loop (residues 188\u2013204) cyan, domain III magenta, the oxyanion loop (residues 143\u2013148) blue and the S1 binding pocket green. ERS-CoV protomer C from crystal form III with protomer C from IBV-CoV yields an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 over 161 C-atom pairs (residues 1\u2013193). however, there is a significant shift in the orientation of domain III between the two homologs. enta ribbons superimposed on the structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro G11A monomer (PDB entry 2pwx, cyan ribbons; Chen et al., 2008 ). previous studies with variants of the enzyme in which residues involved in dimerization were altered revealed that certain amino-acid substitutions cause a structural shift in 3CLpro that disrupts dimerization. three crystal structures of MERS-CoV 3CLpro represent the free enzyme, an enzyme\u2013product comple and a crystallographic monomer. the enzyme\u2013product complex reveals the structural basis of substrate recognition by MERS-CoV 3CLpro on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond."}
