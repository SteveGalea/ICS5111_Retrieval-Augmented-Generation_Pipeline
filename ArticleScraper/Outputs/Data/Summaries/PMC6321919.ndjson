{"summary": "several coronaviruses (CoV) within the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus constantly circulate in the human population and cause mild respiratory disease. the betacoronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV can be zoonotically transmitted from animals to humans. the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (CatL) and the type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, can activate MERS-S (10\u201312) the polymorphisms are located in the receptor binding domain (RBD), a portion of S1 that is required for binding to DPP4. RESULTS Polymorphisms D510G and I529T in MERS-S of Korean patients reduce DPP4 binding but allow efficient entry into cells expressing large amounts of DPP4. we first investigated whether polymorphisms identified during the Korean MERS outbreak are compatible with robust S protein expression and S protein-driven host cell entry. furin processes the S protein in MERS-S-transfected and MERS-CoV-infected cells. the polymorphisms studied did not impact S protein expression. expression plasmids for the indicated S proteins or empty plasmid were transfected into 293T cells. S protein signals were normalized against the corresponding signals for ACTB or VSV-M. expression and particle incorporation were set as 100%. differences in particle expression or incorporation efficiency between MERS-S WT and variants were analyzed. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and flow cytometry revealed that caco-2 and 293T + DPP4 cells expressed substantially higher levels of DPP4 than 293T and Vero E6 cells. this reduction translates into diminished S protein-driven cell entry only when DPP4 expression is low. rhabdoviral particles harboring MERS-S WT were inoculated onto Caco-2, Vero E6, 293T, and 293T cells overexpressing DPP4. soluble DPP4 (solDPP4-Fc) and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody were quantified. binding of solDPP4-Fc to MERS-S WT was set as 100%. results of a single representative experiment carried out with triplicate samples are shown. neuraminidase treatment markedly reduced influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA)-driven entry but had no effect on entry driven by VSV-G. entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants was comparably inhibited by neuraminidase treatment. the polymorphisms under study modulated the capacity of MERS-S to employ CatL and TMPRSS2 for activation. the cells were transfected with DPP4 plasmid and either TMPRSS2 encoding or empty plasmid (control), incubated with the catL inhibitor MDL28170, and then analyzed for S protein-driven transduction. this effect was fully rescued by directed expression of TMPRSS2. transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring the activity of virus-encoded luciferase in cell lysates at 18 h posttransfection. luciferase activity measured for 293T cells overexpressing DPP4 and incubated with DMSO (filled gray bars) ms under study modulated susceptibility of MERS-S-driven entry to blockade by IFITM proteins. expression of IFITM proteins had little effect on entry driven by the Machupo virus glycoprotein (MACV-GPC), while both IFITM2 and IFITM3 markedly reduced entry by the influenza A virus hemagglutinin. transduction of control 293T-CAT cells was set as 100%. error bars indicate SEMs, and statistical significance was analyzed. we focused our analysis on D510G and I529T since these changes modulated the efficiency of host cell entry. I529T diminished neutralization by two seras (CSS16 and CSS53) neither mutation had any impact on neutralization by serum sample CSS23. however, the overall neutralizing activity of this particular serum sample was reduced compared to those of the other sera tested. the results of a single representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown in panels B and C and were confirmed in a separate experiment. errors indicate SDs. all mutants analyzed were robustly expressed and incorporated into rhabdoviral particles. expression plasmids for the indicated S proteins or empty plasmid (control) were transfected into 293T cells. Detection of -actin (ACTB) served as a negative control. expression and particle incorporation, respectively, of MERS-S WT were set as 100%. differences in particle expression or incorporation efficiency between MERS-S WT and variants were analyzed by paired two-tailed Student t tests. the polymorphisms impacted entry into the colon-derived cell line Caco-2, the African green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6, and the human adrenal gland-derived cell line 293T. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and flow cytometry revealed that caco-2 and 293T + DPP4 cells expressed substantially higher levels of DPP4 than 293T and Vero E6 cells. this reduction translates into diminished S protein-driven cell entry only when DPP4 expression is low. the results confirm that D510G and I529T reduce S protein binding to DPP4. binding of solDPP4-Fc to MERS-S WT was set as 100%. results of a single representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. error bars indicate SDs. neuraminidase treatment markedly reduced influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA)-driven entry but had no effect on entry driven by VSV-G. entry driven by neuraminidase was comparably inhibited by neuraminidase treatment. 293T cells were transfected with TMPRSS2 plasmid and either TMPRSS2 encoding or empty plasmid (control), incubated with the catL inhibitor MDL28170. incubation of control cells with MDL28170 reduced entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants. this effect was fully rescued by directed expression of TMPRSS2. transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring the activity of virus-encoded luciferase in cell lysates at 18 h posttransduction. luciferase activity measured for 293T cells overexpressing DPP4 and incubated with DMSO (filled gray bars) was set as 100% for normalization, transduction levels in the absence of inhibitor were set as 100%. expression of IFITM proteins had little effect on entry driven by the Machupo virus glycoprotein (MACV-GPC), while both IFITM2 and IFITM3 markedly reduced entry by the influenza A virus hemagglutinin. comparable results were obtained with 293T cells transfected with escalating amounts of IFTIM2 plasmid. paired two-tailed Student t tests were performed with quadruplicate samples. D510G and I529T increase resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization. the antibody response significantly contributes to control of MERS-CoV infection. the overall neutralization activity of this particular serum sample was reduced compared to those of the other sera tested. however, the overall neutralizing activity of this particular serum sample was reduced compared to those of the other sera tested. our results suggest that increased resistance against humoral immune responses might have driven the emergence of the variants. d510G and I529T were compatible with robust S protein-driven entry into cells expressing large amounts of DPP4 and conferred resistance against antibody-mediated neutralization. d510G and I529T were compatible with robust S protein-driven entry into cells expressing large amounts of DPP4. the I529T mutation has been detected in 72% of patients in Korea examined by one study. the S protein sequences from 26 out of 38 patients deposited in the virus variation database contain the I529T change. however, it remains unclear whether these mutations may also aid virus spread under certain conditions. gene expression of DPP4 has been detected in viral target cells in the human respiratory epithelium, type I and type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages (8, 32), and it is thus possible that virus and virus bearing D510G or I529T infect these cells with comparable efficiencies in the lung of MERS patients. the proteolytic activation of MERS-S by host cell proteases is essential for MERS-S-driven entry into target cells (35). cellular factors can modulate the efficiency of MERS-S-driven entry into cells. the DPP4 ligand adenosine deaminase is highly expressed in lymphoid tissue. the IFN-induced transmembrane proteins IFITM2 and IFITM3 are shown to block MERS-S-driven entry. speculation that reduced DPP4 binding might not necessarily lead to reduced viral spread in host cells expressing high levels of DPP4. however, it would be in keeping with the observation that viruses harboring the I529T change were robustly transmitted between patients during the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea (14) 293T cells stably expressing IFITMs or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), 293T-IFITM1, 293T-IFITM2, 293T-IFITM3, and 293T-CAT (45) were cultivated as for the parental 293T cell line with the exception that they additionally received 0.5 g/ml of puromycin. targeting cathepsin L and related proteases (MDL28170; Sigma-Aldrich) or TMPRSS2 and related proteases (camostat mesylate; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h prior to inoculation with rhabdoviral transduction vectors. target cells were preincubated with 100 mU of recombinant neuraminidase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 cells were incubated for 24 h before the supernatant was harvested. target cells were previously transfected with expression plasmids for DsRed-DPP4 and/or TMPRSS2 or pretreated with protease inhibitors or neuraminidase. 2SDS sample buffer was added to the cells, which were then incubated for 10 min before the sample was transferred to 1.5-ml reaction tubes and heated to 95\u00b0C for additional 10 min. nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked by incubation in 5% skim milk in PBS\u20130.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and then incubated with primary antibody solution (anti-V5, anti-ACTB, or anti-VSV-M anti-V5 (mouse, 1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-actin (ACTB, mouse, 1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-VSV-M (mouse, 1:1,000; Kerafast) as a secondary antibody, an HRP-coupled anti-mouse antibody was used (goat, 1:5,000; Dianova). 293T, Caco-2, and Vero E6 cells were detached by resuspension in 1% BSA-PBS or by incubation in citric saline (PBS containing 0.135 M potassium chloride and 0.015 M sodium citrate; Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells) cells were pelleted and washed as described above, successively incubated with anti-DPP4 antibodies. rhabdoviral transduction vectors harboring MERS-S WT, MERS-S mutants, or VSV-G were normalized for comparable transduction of Caco-2 cells. rhabdoviral transduction vectors harboring MERS-S WT, MERS-S mutants, or VSV-G were normalized for comparable transduction of Caco-2 cells. expression plasmids for TMPRSS2 N-terminally fused to a cMYC epitope and DPP4 N-terminally fused to DsRed (EU827527.1 and DsRed-DPP4) were constructed by amplifying the genetic information from existing expression plasmids and cloning the respective open reading frame (ORF) into the pQCXIP plasmid. 293T cells stably expressing IFITMs or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), 293T-IFITM1, 293T-IFITM2, 293T-IFITM3, and 293T-CAT (45) were cultivated as for the parental 293T cell line with the exception that they additionally received 0.5 g/ml of puromycin (Biomol) 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for MERS-S WT, mutant MERS-S harboring RBD polymorphisms, MACV-GPC, H1N1(WSN)-HA/NA, VSV-G (positive control) or empty expression vector (negative control) at 24 h posttransfection, cells were inoculated with VSV-G-transcomplemented VSV*G-fLuc (Indiana strain, kindly provided by target cells were previously transfected with expression plasmids for DsRed-DPP4 and/or TMPRSS2. for transduction, the culture medium was aspirated and the rhabdoviral transduction vectors were added to the cells. at 48 h posttransfection, the culture supernatant was removed and cells were washed with PBS. proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hartenstein GmbH) by immunoblotting. membranes were then blocked by incubation in 5% skim milk in PBS\u20130.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature. then incubated with primary antibody solution (anti-V5, anti-ACTB, or anti-VSV-M) overnight at 4\u00b0C. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for MERS-S WT, MERS-S mutants, or empty plasmid (both negative controls) at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS. cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 600 g at 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in all samples were analyzed using an LSR II flow cytometer and the FACS Diva software. total cellular RNA was extracted from 293T, Caco-2, and Vero E6 cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) sera from two additional MERS patients, CSS16 and CSS23, were tested at a dilution of 1:200. the mixtures of VSVpp and antibodies/serum were inoculated onto Caco-2 cells. at 18 h posttransduction, transduction efficiency was quantified."}
