{"summary": "in 430 BC, when Hippocrates was collecting clinical observations he would publish in Epidemics, his treatise that forms the foundation of modern medicine. at least 3 terms were used in Ancient Greece to describe situations that resemble those described by Hippocrates: nosos, phtoros, and loimos (2). nosos, meaning disease, was used by Plato in the 4th century BC. the word epidemios was used by Homer 2 centuries before Hippocrates. it means \"who is back home\" and \"who is in his country\" in the Iliad, homer confirmed this meaning by using also polemos epidemios to mean civil war. authors before Hippocrates used epidemios for almost everything (persons, rain, rumors, war), except diseases. hippocrates' Corpus Hippocraticum contains 7 books, titled Epidemics (3). this adjective gave rise to the noun in Greek, epidemia. epidemios, meaning \"on the people,\" became adapted to mean \"that which circulates or propagates in a country\" ouros or loimos were frequently used, but epidemios was not. a database that does not include Hippocrates' works. syndromic groupings become diseases. syndromic groupings become diseases. syndromic groupings become diseases. syndromic groupings become diseases. littr\u00e9 mistakenly considered the Cough of Perinthus to be a single disease. this error made retrospectively diagnosing the diseases of Perinthus difficult, if not impossible. he essentially turned it into an epidemic, probably because of the modern sense of the term in mind. Thucydides and the first Descriptions of Epidemics Thucydides (460 BC\u2013395 BC) interrupted his account of the peloponnesian war to describe the famous Plague of Athens. the term pestis is used in the sense of the Latin term pestis, a term with no clear etymology (4), meaning contagious disease, epidemic, or scourge. de Romilly translated loimos, kakos, and phtoros as disease or epidemic. the original Greek meant \"following these things\" as symptoms. de Romilly rendered the text more elegant and accessible to 20th-century readers. ypidime in medieval French has its origins in these Latin words and went on to become \u00e9pydime in the 14th century, epidimie in the 17th century, and then epid\u00e9mie in the 18th century. in the second half of the 19th century, the terms \u00e9pid\u00e9miologie (1855), \u00e9pid\u00e9miologique (1878) and \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiste (1896) coined in French and notions attached to them developed. a clone of a bacterium (the epidemic strain) was shown to occur during an epidemic with person-to-person transmission (9). the table summarizes these 4 major stages in the semantic evolution of the term epidemic. the slow evolution of the form and meaning of the term suggests that we still have much to learn about the concept of epidemic."}
