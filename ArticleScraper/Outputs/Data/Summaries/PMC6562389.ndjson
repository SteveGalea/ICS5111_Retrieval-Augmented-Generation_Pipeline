{"summary": "wild rats abundant in urban environments may transmit diseases to humans and other animals, including laboratory rodents used for biomedical research in research facilities. in order to gather information about the various diseases present around such facilities, it is important to conduct routine surveillance of wild rats. wild and peridomestic rats are known reservoirs of a number of rodent and zoonotic pathogens. they are ubiquitous in urban and rural environments and are major pests of public health significance. wild rats may pose an animal biosecurity risk to laboratory rodent colonies. sample collection and Rat Identification Captured rats were euthanized using carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and cervical dislocation. rat species was determined by amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. ystis carinii, Toolan\u2019s H-1 virus (H-1), Hantaan virus (HTNV), infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (IDIR strain of GBR; rat rotavirus), Kilham rat virus (KRV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), mouse adenovirus type 2 (MAV2), pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), rat coronavirus/ rat species was determined by amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. a search of homologous sequences was performed using a multiplex fluorescent immunoassay 2 panel. rat minute virus (RMV), rat parvovirus (RPV), rat theilovirus (RTV) and sendai virus (SeV) 29 rats were collected from three areas around the island of St. Kitts. 22 rats were tested for antibodies against various rodent pathogens. antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were not detected in any serum sample. one rat was negative for antibodies to all agents tested, and three rats were positive for antibodies to a single pathogen. the highest number of pathogens detected was in a single rat with antibodies to seven pathogens. LCMV 0/4 0/2 0/16 0/22 (0) MAV2 2/4 1/2 13/16 16/22 (72.7) PVM 0/4 0/2 0/16 0/22 (0) RCV/SDAV 0/4 0/2 0/16 0/22 (0) REO3 0/4 0/2 9/16 9/22 (40.9) RPV 0/4 1/2 3/16 4/22 (18.2) a pilot seroprevalence study provides first evidence of the exposure to rodent pathogens in wild rats in St. Kitts, west indies. antibodies against CARB, MAV2, and KRV were detected in over half of the rat serum samples tested. parvoviruses H-1, RMV, and RPV are asymptomatic in naturally infected rats, compared to KRV, which causes clinical signs such as jaundice, ataxia, and scrotal cyanosis. genetic and/or behavioral differences could be attributed to the increased seroprevalence of KRV in R. norvegicus. infected rats are usually asymptomatic and natural infection has not been proven to be linked specifically to interference with biomedical research. the majority of HTNV infection is observed in Asia and in its reservoir host, the field mouse. wild rats harbor a variety of rodent and zoonotic pathogens [1] that could be a source of contamination in laboratory rodent colonies. pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks."}
