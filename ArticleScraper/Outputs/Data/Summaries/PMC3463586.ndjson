{"summary": "innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and C-type lectins. this results in production of type I interferons (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that orchestrate the elimination of the pathogens. however, unlike adaptive immunity, the innate immune response can also be detrimental to hosts. activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFB) and distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are critical for the production of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway is only required for induction of type I IFNs as well as a group of antiviral proteins. our initial high throughput screening campaign has thus far identified a compound that selectively enhances TLR3 and RLR ligand-induced IFN- gene expression. the compound selectively enhances TLR3 and RLR ligand-induced IFN- gene expression and antiviral response, most likely via activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, but not the NFB or IRF3 pathway. poly I:C-induced luciferase expression was dose-dependently inhibited by chloroquine and IKK-2 inhibitor IV (an IKK- inhibitor) in both 293TLR3/IFNLuc and 293TLR3/NFBLuc cells, LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that is required for activation of IRF3 [27] only inhibited poly I:C-induced the effects of the tested compounds on the promoter activity were normalized and expressed as a percentage of luciferase activity obtained from the cells treated with poly I:C alone. RO 90\u20137501 selectively enhances the activation of IFN-, but not NFB activation. 293TLR3/IFNLuc and 293TLR3/NFBLuc cells were mock treated or treated with indicated concentrations of RO 90\u20137501 for 16 h. the effects of RO 90\u20137501 on the IFN- promoter and NFB reporter activation were normalized to mock-treated controls. the promoter activity declined with a similar kinetics since the peak time in the absence or presence of RO 90\u2013751. the results thus imply that RO 90\u20137501 most likely targets a molecular event in the activation, but not negative feedback regulation of TLR3 signal transduction pathway to prolong the activation of IFN- promoter. 293TLR3/IFNLuc cells were treated either with 2 g/ml poly I:C alone or in combination with 10 M of RO 90\u20137501. the results indicate that RO 90\u20137501 has no effect on IFN- promoter activation in the absence of TLR3 ligand. this suggests the compound should be pharmacologically active only in virally-infected, but not un-infected cells. 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated or treated with 10 M of RO 90\u20137501, 2 g/ml poly I:C, alone or in combination. levels of secreted type I IFN were then determined using culture media transferred from treated THP-1 cells. levels of secreted type I IFN were then determined with HEK-Blue IFN-/ cells using culture media transferred from treated THP-1 cells. the downstream signaling pathways leading to activation of IFN- and inflammatory cytokine gene expression are shared by both TLR3 and cytoplasmic RLRs. we set out to test whether RO 90\u20137501 could also enhance the activation of the IFN- promoter elicited by cytoplasmic delivery of double stranded RNA. 293/IFNLuc cells were either mock transfected (no RNA) or transfected with poly I:C. RO 90\u20137501 enhances poly I:C-induced antiviral response. 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated, or treated with poly I:C, RO 90\u20137501 alone or in combination for 12 h. virus yields were determined by a plaque assay. 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated, or treated with poly I:C (2 g/ml), RO 90\u20137501 (10 M), alone or in combination, for 30 min. the levels of the total and phosphorylated p38, ERK and JNK pathways were determined by an immunoblot assay. treatment of the cells with RO 90\u20137501 was able to efficiently activate p38 MAKP and to a lesser extent, ERK and JNK pathways. 293TLR3/IFNLuc cells were treated with 2 g/ml of poly I:C alone. luciferase activity was normalized and expressed as a percentage of luciferase activity obtained from the cells treated with poly I:C alone. poly I:C treatment of 293/IFNLuc cell line without TLR3 fails to induce luciferase expression. however, the poly I:C-induced luciferase expression was dose-dependently inhibited by chloroquine (a lysosome acidification inhibitor) and IKK-2 inhibitor IV (an IKK- inhibitor) in both 293TLR3/IFNLuc and 293TLR3/NFBLuc cells, LY294002, only inhibited poly 293TLR3/IFNLuc and 293TLR3/NFBLuc cells were treated with 2 g/ml of poly I:C in the absence of the indicated concentrations of compounds for 16 h. the effects of the tested compounds on the promoter activity were normalized and expressed as a percentage of luciferase activity obtained from the cells treated with poly I:C alone. 293TLR3/IFNLuc and 293TLR3/NFBLuc cells were mock treated or treated with 10 M of RO 90\u20137501 for 16 h. the effects of RO 90\u20137501 on the IFN- promoter and NFB reporter activation were normalized to mock-treated controls. the presence of RO 90\u20137501 increased the peak level of IFN- promoter activity at 10 h of poly I:C treatment. but the promoter activity declined with a similar kinetics since the peak time in the absence or presence of RO 90\u20137501. the results thus imply that RO 90\u20137501 most likely targets a molecular event in the activation, but not negative feedback regulation of TLR3 signal transduction pathway. the compound did not enhance poly I:C-induced IFN- promoter activation when added 3 h before, at same time or even 3 h after the addition of poly I:C into the culture media. however, the compound did not enhance poly I:C-induced IFN- promoter activation when the cells were pretreated with the compound for 3 h. this results indicate that RO 90\u20137501 has no effect on IFN- promoter activation in the absence of TLR3 ligand 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated or treated with 10 M of RO 90\u20137501, 2 g/ml poly I:C, alone or in combination. levels of IFN- and -actin mRNAs were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. levels of secreted type I IFN were then determined with HEK-Blue. RO 90\u20137501 enhances the cytoplasmic RLR ligand-induced IFN- expression. the downstream signaling pathways leading to activation of IFN- and inflammatory cytokine gene expression are shared by both TLR3 and cytoplasmic RLRs. we set out to test whether RO 90\u20137501 could also enhance the activation of the IFN- promoter elicited by cytoplasmic delivery of double stranded RNA. 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated or treated with poly I:C. cells were then challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) the virus yields were determined by a plaque assay. RO 90\u20137501 enhances poly I:C-induced activation of MAPKs. 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated, or treated with poly I:C (2 g/ml), RO 90\u20137501 (10 M), alone or in combination, for 30 min. levels of total and phosphorylated p38, ERK and JNK pathways were determined by an immunoblot assay. 293TLR3HA cells were mock treated or treated with 2 g/ml of poly I:C. luciferase activity was determined and expressed as a percentage of luciferase activity obtained from the cells treated with poly I:C alone. imiquimod (Aldara) has been approved for treatment of papillomavirus-induced genital warts and basal cell carcinoma via topical use. it is not surprising that systematic administration of the TLR agonists in doses necessary to achieve antiviral or anti-tumor effects is usually associated with significant adverse effects [11], [12], [13], [14]. LR3 agonist-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation and IRF3 activated gene (ISG56) expression. treatment of 293TLR3HA cells with RO 90\u20137501 was able to rapidly activate p38 MAPK, and to a lesser extent, ERK and JNK. ironically, RO 90\u20137501 only enhances TLR3 response in the presence of its agonist, but fails in the condition that the cells were pretreated with the compound for 3 h. pharmacological modulation of TLR3 signaling or function of downstream chemokines and/or cytokines can alter TLR3 agonist-induced innate immune response.
