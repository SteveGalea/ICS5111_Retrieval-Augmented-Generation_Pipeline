{"summary": "a large proportion of children with fever in africa present at primary health care facilities. few studies have been designed to specifically study the causes of uncomplicated childhood febrile illness at this level of care, especially in areas like Zanzibar that has recently undergone a dramatic change from high to low malaria transmission. 4.3%) were the most common viral and bacterial fever diagnoses. only 152 (22%) had an infection retrospectively considered to require antibiotics. only 68 (11%) patients remained febrile on day 3 and three had verified fever on day 14. the complexity of fever aetiology has been highlighted by the application of molecular assays for detection of multiple pathogens. the frequent detection of nucleic acids from pathogens among both patients and asymptomatic children points at the need to include healthy controls in fever aetiology studies. however, comprehensive studies of this type, especially those from africa are lacking. in addition to first-level outpatient care, Kivunge primary health care centre has facilities for basic inpatient care and laboratory services. it was selected as study site based on its central location in the district, 24-hour service, presence of a research laboratory, and radiology equipment. the clinicians had been trained in IMCI management.

CXR confirmed pneumonia in 12% (42/342) of patients with sufficient CXR quality. influenza A and enterovirus were final diagnoses at enrolment. the remaining five children had coronavirus and rhinovirus infection (n = 2), bocavirus, GAS infection and influenza A respectively. there was neither any difference in early fever resolution (Table 1) among patients with (39/45; 87%) or without (504/595; 85%) a serious bacterial infection (CXR-confirmed pneumonia and/or urinary tract infection) multiple pathogens were detected in a large proportion of specimens from both patients and controls. many pathogens were detected in similar frequencies in patients and controls. aetiology identification has previously been used for gastrointestinal infections. IMCI-pneumonia classification was the largest contributor to presumed unnecessary antibiotic prescription in our study. approximately 50% with CXR-confirmed pneumonia in our study had CRP 80 mg/L and a viral pathogen detected by NPH-qPCR. IMCI guidelines have remained quite similar since its introduction. the overall health outcome was satisfactory with relatively few children who developed severe disease during follow-up. our results concur with previous studies of IMCI management of uncomplicated childhood fever on first referral level of Pakistan and Papua new Guinea. on aetiology, antibiotic treatment and outcome of non-severe febrile childhood illness in a malaria pre-elimination setting of Africa. the first using a comprehensive laboratory panel and including a healthy control group shows the complexity of determining infectious aetiologies. the majority of fevers were caused by viral upper respiratory tract infections, similarly to children in high-income countries."}
