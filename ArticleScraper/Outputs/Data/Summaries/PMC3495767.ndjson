{"summary": "monoclonal antibodies or vaccination with an A33 subunit vaccine confer protection against lethal poxvirus challenge in animal models. one monoclonal antibody directed against VACV A33, MAb-1G10, has been shown to target a conformation-dependent epitope. one monoclonal antibody directed against VACV A33, MAb-1G10, has been shown to target a conformation-dependent epitope. small molecule mimetics may interfere with the function of A33 in vivo. despite the eradication of naturally occurring smallpox, the licensed smallpox vaccine is still administered to military personnel and first responders due to the threat of bioterrorism. controlled trials were performed with the currently available VIGIV product. the use of similar products has historically decreased mortality, from 100% to 50% for PV, and from 30-40% to 3-4% for EV (reviewed in [7]. in immunized individuals anti-EEV titers vary considerably. anti-ev antibody levels are also variable among different VIG products. however, identification and characterization of EEV neutralizing determinants is incomplete. -1G10 epitope on vaccinia A33 was not present in the monkeypox ortholog A35 ortholog A35. residues 117\u2013120 implicated as core residues forming the MAb-1G10 epitope. a dimeric, -strand rich structural model of vaccinia A33 was proposed. our data confirm that residue L118 contributes to epitope formation. an unbiased mapping strategy utilizing random peptide display technology can effectively map linear and conformational epitopes involved in facilitating cell to cell spread of vaccinia. this work also expands understanding of an important orthopoxvirus epitope. biotinylated peptide mimics were constructed to verify MAb-1G10 binding in a solid-phase assay. strong interaction of MAb-1G10 with one of the peptides (RF2-1) was confirmed in the ELISA based assay. peptides containing cluster I and cluster II consensus sequences demonstrate increased binding to MAb-1G10 when compared to an unrelated control antibody. a molecular model of the short consensus CELPC peptide was constructed as an aid in identifying potential binding regions in the intact molecule. bonded peptide with 11.7 angstrom distance between charged glutamate side chain and hydrophobic leucine residue was only 6.9 angstroms. reducing disulphide bond would reduce binding of phage peptide to MAb-1G10 antibody by virtue of altering conformation of the loop. alanine scanning technique was used to determine if either of these hypotheses regarding the MAb-1G10 epitope structure might be correct. the ectodomain of wild type A33 (residues 59\u2013186) was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged recombinant protein, and refolded on an affinity purification column. alanine substitutions at residues 116, 117, 120, 125, and 129 did not prevent interaction with MAb-1G10. rA33 proteins were used in an ELISA format assay to capture MAb-1G10. rA33 proteins were tested for their ability to bind MAb-1G10 in an immunoprecipitation assay. y116A or Q117A variant A33 proteins had no effect on MAb-1G10 activity in the comet assay. rA33 proteins containing substitutions at D115 or L118 do not interfere with MAb-1G10\u2019s ability to block EEV-mediated virus spread. wells labeled \u2018MAb+\u2019 received 12.5 g/mL MAb-1G10 1 hour post infection. the monolayers were fixed and stained 46 hours post infection. a disulfide-constrained heptapeptide library screening approach was used to obtain unbiased information on the conformationally distinct epitope interacting with MAb-1G10. the randomized peptide segment is flanked by paired cysteines, which are oxidized during phage assembly to present the peptide as a taut loop. the 2 library screens suggested that the conformationally constrained CEPLC sequence was likely to be functionally identical to the minimal core MAb-1G10 epitope. residues 118 and 120 demonstrate heterogeneity, while residues 118 and 120 demonstrate heterogeneity. two loops with (pdbid 3DXQ, sequence C(177)DPLC(181) and without (pdbid 1M6B, C(304)GGLC(308)) disulphide bonds were extracted. the presence or absence of the disulphide bond prescribes a different topology for these sequences. the strand-loop-helix region of the A33 protein similar to the phage display peptide CEPLC is shown. alanine scanning technique was used to determine if either of these hypotheses regarding the MAb-1G10 epitope structure might be correct. Binding to MAb-1G10 was found comparable by ELISA and immunoprecipitation. alanine residues were individually substituted for D115, Y116, Q117, L118, N125, and E129. all of these were successfully expressed in E. coli with similar efficiency and purity as compared to E. coli expressed wild type recombinant A33 (rA33; Supplemental Figure 2). phage expressing the CELPC consensus motif were included in the comet assay along with MAb-1G10. satellite plaques were restored, demonstrating that MAb-1G10 activity had been abolished. rA33 proteins containing substitutions at D115A or L118A mutations were added to the comet assay along with MAb-1G10. the monolayers were fixed and stained 46 hours post infection. a randomized peptide library screen used a randomized peptide library to evaluate the rA33 inhibiting epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody MAb-1G10. the importance of measuring anti-EEV antibodies is underscored by observations that anti-B5 and anti-A33 levels are variable in polyclonal VIGIV preparations. the current study provides thorough characterization of an A33 conformational comet inhibiting epitope and links the epitope to a viral spread assay. a limitation to this broader approach is lack of detailed structural information for other important target EEV proteins such as B5. our future studies will include structural analysis of key vaccinia-neutralizing targets to support random peptide library screening efforts. interdisciplinary approach integrating conformational peptide display, structure mapping, and a biologically relevant assay provides a more complete characterization of an important vaccinia epitope. findings suggest an additional option for vaccine subunit development, the possibility of using streamlined assays to assess anti-EEV vaccine responses. the MAb-1G10 hybridoma was grown in BD Cell Monoclonal Antibody Medium (Fisher) the bound antibody was eluted with 0.1M glycine pH 2.5. after extensive washes with PBS, the bound antibody was immediately neutralized with 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) the structural database was queried using BLAST for short sequences containing two cysteines separated by three amino acids. if different the sequence extracted from the database was altered to the sequence of phage display peptide, energy minimized using CHARMM [54] and then compared with the possible locus of the MAb-1G10 epitope. inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 18000 g for 30 minutes. washed with PBS/0.5% Triton X-100, solubilized overnight in 6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0 and then incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads for 2 hours at room temperature. to express and purify soluble recombinant A33 proteins from E.coli, the protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) at 18\u00b0C in the presence of 5% glycerol and 2.5% ethanol. the soluble fraction containing A33 was refolded onto a column using the method described above. RF2-5:ACGDDWPHECGGGSAK-(C6-biotin) were made by standard 9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl chemistry. the peptide was dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH7.0) and incubated with 20 fold of molar excess of both tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at room temperature for 2 peptides diluted in phosphate buffer were added to wells of streptavidin-coated 96-well plates. antibody dilutions were incubated with protein A Dynal magnetic beads. antibody was removed by incubation with 0.1m glycine buffer (pH 2.5), followed by three times washing in PBS-T buffer. DMEM, and virus + MAb wells received 2 mL cDMEM containing 12.5 g/mL MAb-1G10 at 12.5 g/mL. some experiments used purified phage instead of A33 proteins. plates were placed in a CO2 incubator maintained at 37\u00b0C for 46 hours. cells and cell culture supernatant were removed to centrifuge tubes and spun for 15 minutes at 2000 g at 4\u00b0C. the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in cold cDMEM. the supernatant was disrupted using a cup horn sonicator for 4 cycles each composed of 30 seconds at 90% power, 50% duty cycle followed by 60 seconds on ice. phages were eluted from the complex with 0.1 M HCl for 8 min at room temperature and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) the eluted phages were then amplified in the host strain ER2738 and precipitated with 25% PEG/4 M NaCl. DNA from well-separated plaques was sequenced, and the corresponding peptide sequence was then deduced from the DNA sequence. the resulting plasmids were constructed using a kit for site directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs) the accuracy of the resulting constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. BL21-DE3 strain was transformed with the resulting plasmids. the protein solution was then clarified by centrifugation at 18000 g. the supernatant snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. a common reverse primer was used for all reactions: AATATATAACAAGAACCCTGG. to express and purify soluble recombinant A33 proteins from E.coli, the protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) at 18\u00b0C in the presence of 5% glycerol and 2.5% ethanol. the soluble fraction containing A33 was adsorbed onto an eco-Pak column and refolded on the column using the method described above. unbound rA33 was removed with saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) non-specific protein binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T. wells were washed 4 times in PBS-T before addition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Roche Diagnostics) diluted in blocking buffer. rA33 proteins were eluted by using 0.1M glycine (pH 2.5) the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by staining with GelCode Blue (Pierce) one well was left uninfected as a sham control. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software) all experiments were performed in duplicate unless otherwise noted. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
