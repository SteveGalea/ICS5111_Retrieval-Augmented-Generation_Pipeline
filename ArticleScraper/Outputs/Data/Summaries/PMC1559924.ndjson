{"summary": "the functional mediators of RNA interference (RNAi) are small interfering RNAs (siRNA) these double-stranded RNA molecules are typically 19 to 23 nucleotides in length. passive transport over the lipophilic cell membrane is poor. intracellular entry into the target cell within the diseased tissue is a prerequisite. overexpression of the mammalian homologue increases the intracellular uptake of siRNA. this lack of activity of \u201cnaked\u201d siRNA indicates that not all cell types express (enough of) the SID-1 homologue, to observe silencing effects. rapid removal of \u201cnaked\u201d siRNA after intravenous administration relying on passive targeting of the diseased tissue. nontarget cells can respond strongly to siRNA by different proinflammatory reactions. these effects can be intensified by employing cationic helper molecules. this is an important aspect when considering the nonspecific effects that can be induced. modifications in the nucleobases, sugars, and the phosphate ester backbone of siRNA can reduce siRNA sensitivity to nucleases. a number of chemical modifications have been proposed to increase nuclease resistance, like boranophosphates [30], 4\u2032-thioribonucleosides, phosphorothioates, 2\u2032deoxy-2\u2032 fluorouridine, 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxy silencing effects of modified siRNA specific for insulin-like growth factor receptor were strongly enhanced as compared to unmodified siRNA. a similar setup, membrane permeant peptides were coupled to siRNA to facilitate intracellular uptake. cholesterol-modified siRNAs were detected in liver and jejunum at concentrations of 100\u2013200 ng per gram tissue 24 hours after intravenous injection. these levels were sufficient to reduce the levels of the apolipoprotein apoB-100 in plasma by 31\u201368%. this reduction was parallel by a 37% reduction in overall cholesterol levels, and reduction in high-density lipoprotein, low- density lipoprotein, and chylomicron levels. chemical modifications in the nucleobases, sugars, and the phosphate ester backbone of siRNA can reduce siRNA sensitivity to nucleases. a number of chemical modifications have been proposed to increase nuclease resistance, like boranophosphates [30], 4\u2032-thioribonucleosides, phosphorothioates, 2\u2032deoxy-2\u2032 fluorouridine, 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-O-(2-meth chemical modifications have been introduced to enhance intracellular uptake of siRNA. the enhanced lipophilicity of this siRNA allows passive diffusion over the cell membrane, while at the same time enhancing nuclease resistance. cholesterol-modified siRNAs were detected in liver and jejunum at concentrations of 100\u2013200 ng per gram tissue 24 hours after intravenous injection. these levels were sufficient to reduce the levels of the apolipoprotein apoB-100 in plasma by 31\u201368%. despite these impressive results using relatively simple modifications, the doses of chemically modified siRNAs needed are relatively high. reconstituted viral envelopes derived from influenza virus are used to encapsulate and deliver siRNAs. the reconstituted viral envelopes contain the influenza virus spike protein hemagglutinin and additionally added cationic lipids. the siRNA-loaded vesicles are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. a fraction of viral protein was not susceptible to RNAi-mediated silencing. the exact nature of this protection remains to be determined. the exact nature of this protection and its possible involvement in RNAi resistance remains to be determined. the natural tropism of viruses for certain cell types may be used. however, such approaches have not been tried as yet in combination with RNAi-mediated gene silencing in vivo. the strength of the viral delivery approach is the efficient transduction of cells. some cationic compounds are being used as endosomal escape enhancers. cationic complexes possess a propensity to interact with virtually any cell type they encounter, creating a need to insulate the interactive surface of the particle to promote specificity. intraperitoneal macrophages after intraperitoneal administration [60], delta opioid receptor in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia after intravenous administration [61], polo-like kinase-1 in bladder cancer after intravesical administration, and c-raf-1 in prostate cancer cells after intravenous administration [62]. cationic compounds have also been investigated for siRNA-delivery purposes. siRNA-atelocollagen complexes failed to induce nonspecific proinflammatory responses like secretion of IFN- and IL-12. targeted amino-acid-based system was based on the cationic peptide protamine [67] VEGF strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo when delivered using the F105-P system. this combination of siRNAs attacking the tumor at multiple fronts is an important advantage of the siRNA technology. the delivery problem for each individual drug molecule (siRNA) remains the same. ic RGD-peptide is a high-affinity ligand for alpha v-integrins that are overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial surfaces. tissue distribution studies in vivo showed that injection of \"naked\" siRNA did not produce appreciable tumor levels, but rather rapid clearance into the urine. PEI-siRNA complexes also lacked the production of high fluorescence in the tumor, but did increase liver and especially lung levels synthetic nonviral delivery systems are a diverse class of molecules used in different nucleic acid delivery strategies. reconstituted viral envelopes derived from influenza virus are used to encapsulate and deliver siRNAs. reconstituted viral envelopes contain the influenza virus spike protein hemagglutinin and additionally added cationic lipids. virus transcripts in mice with active replication of the hepatitis B virus, showed almost complete inhibition of viral protein production. this in turn led to arrest of viral replication at day 17 after viral infection. there appeared to be a fraction of viral protein that was not susceptible to RNAi-mediated silencing. viral DNA-based sh/siRNA delivery process is very efficient. binding to the target cell surface and subsequent transduction appear satisfactory. however, the natural tropism of viruses for certain cell types may be used. cationic functional group is usually required to bind and condense the nucleic acid, thereby protecting it against nucleases and increasing the apparent molecular weight above the renal clearance cut-off. cationic compounds are being used as endosomal escape enhancers. some cationic compounds are being used as endosomal escape enhancers. cationic complexes possess a propensity to interact with virtually any cell type they encounter, creating a need to insulate the interactive surface of the particle to promote specificity. cationic polymer poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) has been used for treatment of ovarian carcinoma in mice. silencing of Her-2 with these polyplexes inhibited ovarian carcinoma growth in vivo. tumor levels increased 6-fold as compared to levels after \"naked\" siRNA administration. siRNA-atelocollagen complexes failed to induce nonspecific proinflammatory responses like secretion of IFN- and IL-12. targeted cationic delivery systems A targeted amino-acid-based system was based on the cationic peptide protamine [67] DM2, VEGF strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo when delivered using the F105-P system. the versatility of this targeted system was demonstrated by exchanging the HIV-envelope antibody for an ErbB2-antibody changing the specificity of the system. GD-peptide is a high-affinity ligand for alpha v-integrins that are overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial surfaces. peptide is a high-affinity ligand for alpha v-integrins that are overexpressed on angiogenic endothelial surfaces. studies in the eye also showed vasculature-specific delivery and inhibition of angiogenesis leading to therapeutic effects. nonviral delivery systems are a diverse class of molecules used in different nucleic acid delivery strategies. they range from simple cationic complexation for local administration to targeted shielded systems for intravenous injection. their adaptability to specific targeting requirements is an important advantage, although optimization of delivery efficiency continues to remain important. strategies are based on (a) chemical modifications of siRNA, (b) targeting of siRNA using viral vectors."}
