{"summary": "there are three existential threats to humanity. the first is deduced from the inferred cataclysmic effects of nuclear war. the second is geological evidence for the association of asteroid impacts with massive extinction. the universe of threats can potentially encompass all microbes that inhabit the planet. pathogenic microbes acquired directly from the environment represent a completely different challenge for the host since these have acquired their capacity for pathogenicity by. virulence is expressed only in a susceptible host. a large percentage of environmental microbes come from those microbes that can survive mammalian temperatures. it is possible to adapt an insect pathogenic fungus to tolerate mammalian temperatures by simple thermal selection in the laboratory. if the universe of threats from the natural world was not enough humanity also faces potential threats from synthetic biology. microbial threat lists have been designed by creating algorithms that attempt to identify the most dangerous types of microbes. a fundamental problem with any microbial threat list is that it is necessarily a backward looking document. microbial threat lists are primarily populated with agents that have been investigated for biological warfare use. at least 335 new infectious diseases have been described since 1940, with the majority being zoonosis (Jones et al., 2008). the identification of so many new diseases over the past seven decades shows no sign to slowing. it is almost a certainty that humanity will continue to confront new microbial threats and that many of these agents, such as SARS coronavirus, possess a significant weapon potential when recovered from nature. the introduction of antimicrobial resistance genes into bacterial agents could significantly enhance their lethality by reducing treatment options. it is relatively easy to generate B. anthracis resistant to first line antimicrobial therapies such as ciprofloxacin. develop hosttargeted interventions that enhance immune function against a wide variety of threats. develop therapies that produce temporary increases in immune function. this approach would provide defensive options against yet to be identified microbial threats. continued investments in basic research with emphasis on fostering a better understanding of host\u2013microbe interactions are an essential cornerstone for any effort to defend in depth against biological weapons."}
