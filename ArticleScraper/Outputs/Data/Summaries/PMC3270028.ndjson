{"summary": "viral infections are sensed by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and then trigger an antiviral response. innate immune system is the first line of defense that protects the host against viral infection. new-emerging and most pathogenic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) inhibits the induction of IFN- through blocking translocation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at a later time point in infection. innate immunity in specific cell types is likely essential for generating a protective immune response. coronavirus infection induces a type I interferon response in a subset of cells. the ability to mount an effective immune response is essential for clearing the viral infection and generating protective immunity. at least two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the low level of type I interferon response to coronavirus infection. coV PLPs cleave replicase polyprotein to generate nonstructural proteins (nsp's) that associate with ER membranes to generate convoluted membranes. the coV PLPs are tethered to the DMVs by a transmembrane domain. HEK293T cells were transfected with the STING-HA, ISRE-luc reporter and either wild-type or catalytic mutants of HCoV-NL63 PLP2-TM or SARS-CoV PLpro-TM. asterisks indicate statistical significance (P0.05) in comparison with ISRE-reporter activity stimulated with STING. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing STING and catalytic cysteine mutants of either PLP2-TM or PLpro-TM. co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine if CoV PLPs associate with STING. NL63 wild-type and catalytic mutant PLPs are detected in association with STING. similar co-immunoprecipitation results were obtained using PLpro-TM. HCoV-NL63 replicase protein nsp3 is detected as punctate, perinuclear staining. STING-Flag, PLP2-TM-V5 and the catalytic mutant expression were selectively detected from whole cell lysates (WCL) HEK293-ACE2 cells were transfected with STING-V5 for 4 hours and then infected with HCoV-NL63 for 24 hrs. NL63 PLP2-TM interacts with STING and disrupts STING dimers. HEK293-ACE2 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA expressing STING-HA and infected with SARS-CoV as indicated. whole cell lysates were immunoblotted to detect expression of each product. dimers were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing STING-HA and STING-Flag and plasmid DNA expressing wt or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM. a reduction in STING dimers was detected in cells expressing wt PLP2-TM and the D1849A mutant which retain DUB activity. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNAs expressing STING-HA along with Flag-RIG-I, Flag-MAVS or Flag-IKK. expression of PLP2-TM had no effect on co-immunoprecipitation of RIG-I with STING. NL63 PLP2-TM disrupts signaling complex formation. HEK-293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub and epitope-tagged versions of either RIG-I, TBK-1, IRF-3 or STING. there was a dramatic reduction in the amount of ubiquitinated RIG-I (A), TBK-1 (B), IRF-3 (C) and STING (D) in cells expressing PLP2-TM. HEK293 cells were transfected with flag-tagged RIG-I, STING, TBK1 and IRF-3 in the presence of NL63 PLP2-TM-V5. the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibody. the whole cell lysates were blotted to evaluate expression of each epitope-tagged product. co-expression of STING with wild-type PLP2-TM or PLpro-TM resulted in a dose dependent decrease in ISRE activity. this indicates that these PLPs can antagonize STING-mediated activation of an IRF-3 dependent promoter. co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine if this antagonism is dependent on PLP catalytic activity. cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing epitope tagged version of STING (STING-Flag) in the presence or absence of PLP2-TM and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody. the results show that both NL63 wild-type and catalytic mutant PLPs are detected in association with STING. cell lysates were prepared at 28 hrs post-transfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Flag antibody. HEK293-ACE2 cells were transfected with STING-V5 for 4 hours and then infected with HCoV-NL63 for 24 hrs. NL63 PLP2-TM interacts with STING and disrupts STING dimers. HEK293-ACE2 cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing STING-Flag. cell lysates were immunoblotted to detect SARS-CoV replicase protein nsp3. TING-Flag with either wild-type or indicated catalytic mutant of PLP2-TM and lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) to detect expression of each product. cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing STING-HA and STING-Flag. a reduction in STING dimers was detected in cells expressing wt PLP2-TM and the D1849A mutant which retain DUB activity HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNAs expressing STING-HA along with Flag-RIG-I, Flag-MAVS or Flag-IKK. expression of PLP2-TM had no effect on co-immunoprecipitation of RIG-I with STING. HEK-293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub and epitope-tagged versions of either RIG-I, TBK-1 (B), IRF-3 (C) or STING. we found a dramatic reduction in the amount of ubiquitinated RIG-I (A), TBK-1 (B), IRF-3 (C) and STING (D) in cells expressing PLP2-TM. IFN antagonism of catalytic mutants may be due to physical interaction with STING which blocks access of ubiquitin chains or Ub-ligases or other modifying enzymes. a previous report indicates that only the dimer form of STING is ubiquitinated [9], which supports a role for viral DUB activity in negatively regulating STING. both SARS-CoV PLpro-TM and HCoV-NL63 PLP2-TM associate with an ER-associated protein, STING. ubiquitination of signaling molecules is dramatically reduced in the presence of HCoV-NL63 PLP2-TM. this is another mechanism used by coronaviruses to prevent activation of innate immunity. the activation of STING facilitates the recruitment of IRF-3 and TBK-1 into a complex where IRF-3 is phosphorylated. Phosphorylated IRF-3 forms dimers and is transported to the nucleus to activate transcription of type I IFN genes. CoV PLPs target STING and prevent this key scaffolding protein from activating IRF-3. previous studies have shown a role for viral proteases in cleavage of key IFN signaling molecules. a protease inhibitor that blocks both protease and DUB activity failed to abrogate the PLP inhibition on activation of IRF-3 dependent promoters. catalytic activity was important for blocking either the assembly or the stability of STING dimers. we found that PLP2-TM either actively deubiquitinates or blocks the ubiquitination of the signaling molecules. this is consistent with these reported works that STING dimers were modified by ubiquitin. A20 activity removes K-63 linked polyubiquitin chains from RIP1, TRAF6, RIP2 and NEMO which results in negative regulation of the innate immune response. both A20 and CoV PLPs can act on K-63 linked ubiquitin chains [14], [58] further experiments are needed to determine if recognition, processing or sequestering of K-63 linked ubiquitin chains is important. the interaction of STING with PLP2-TM may block the signals required for STING to translocate to exocyst vesicles. HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV PLPs inhibit host IFN- production by targeting and nullifying STING. the activation of STING facilitates the recruitment of IRF-3 and TBK-1 into a complex where IRF-3 is phosphorylated. Phosphorylated IRF-3 forms dimers and is transported to the nucleus to activate transcription of type I IFN genes. CoV PLPs exploit catalytic dependent and catalytic-independent mechanisms to block the innate immune response. phosphorylatin of STING and IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus inducing production of IFN. previous studies have shown a role for viral proteases in cleavage of key IFN signaling molecules. this led us to suspect that CoV PLPs were interacting with a component in the IFN signaling pathway. catalytic activity was important for blocking either the assembly or the stability of STING dimers. we found that PLP2-TM either actively deubiquitinates or blocks the ubiquitination of the signaling molecules. these studies are currently ongoing. ubiquitin-editing on signaling molecules such as RIP1, TRAF6, RIP2 and NEMO. both A20 and CoV PLPs can act on K-63 linked ubiquitin chains. further experiments are needed to determine if recognition, processing or sequestering of K-63 linked ubiquitin is important. the interaction of STING with PLP2-TM may block the signals required for STING to translocate to exocyst vesicles. HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV PLPs inhibit host IFN- production by targeting and nullifying STING.
