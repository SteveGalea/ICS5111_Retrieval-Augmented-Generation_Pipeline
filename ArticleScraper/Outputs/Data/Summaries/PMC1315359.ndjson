{"summary": "real-time quantitative PCR is a sensitive and very efficient technique to examine gene transcription patterns in preimplantation embryos. it is critical to the succesful application of real-time quantitative PCR is careful assay design, reaction optimization and validation to maximize sensitivity and accuracy. most studies published GAPD, ACTB or 18S rRNA have been used as a single reference gene without prior verification of their expression stability. a lack of standards, variation in assay design, diversity of protocols, instruments and analysis methods make that real-time RT-PCR has been recognised as the method of choice for accurate and sensitive quantification of mRNA transcripts. real-time RT-PCR assays in which data are accurately normalized, are significantly less variable than conventional RT-PCR procedures. a number of experiments have provided solid evidence that their transcription levels are not constant between different developmental stages and different experimental conditions. a number of studies have provided solid evidence that their transcription levels are not constant between different developmental stages and different experimental conditions. morphological characteristics were selected from 3 different in vitro embryo production experiments. the mean percentage of obtained embryos from all cultivated oocytes at the different developmental stages were 65 6% for the 2-cell stage, 44 5% for the 8-cell stage, 25 4% for the blastocyst stage. information on primers used for real-time PCR Gene Genbank Accession number species Sequence Product size (bp) Ta (\u00b0C) % homology ACTB[23] AY141970 Cow 5'-CCTCACGGAACGTGGTTACA-3' 5'-TCCTTGATGTCACGCACAATTT-3' 87 58 100 % GAPD XM_618013 Cow 5'-TTCAACGGCACAGTCAAGG-3' 5'- utions of pooled cDNA gave correlation coefficients greater than 0.97 and efficiencies greater than 90%. the reaction efficiencies were used to transform the Ct-values into raw data for analysis with the geNorm software. a correction factor was necessary for the determination of the most stable reference gene over the 3 assays together. the geNorm analysis of the combined assay is in accordance with the ranking of the 3 individual assays. the 4th gene has no significanf effect (low V3/4 value) on the NF. the 3 member set GAPD, SDHA and YWHAZ is an excellent choice for the calculation of the NF. gene-specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melt-curve analysis and a single band with the expected size in agarose gel electrophoresis. the identities of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. 6811 cow 5'-AGAAACGGCTACCACATCCA-3' 5'-CACCAGACTTGCCCTCCA-3' 169 62 100 % For all genes studied, standard curves derived from 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cDNA gave correlation coefficients greater than 0.97. reaction efficiencies were used to transform the Ct-values into raw data for analysis with the geNorm software.

RNA analysis was not possible, but an RNA extraction method was optimized for small sample quantities. RT-controls before and after the DNAse treatment demonstrated the necessity and efficacy of the DNase treatment. but even more importantly, yielding unreliable data especially for low abundant single exon genes. the addition of exogenously added mRNA can only be used when the exact amount of cells or starting material is known. it is now accepted that transcription levels should be normalized to an invariable internal control gene. a safer approach is to use the geometric average expression of several genes that show small variance. a gene-stability measure was developed to determine the expression stability of control genes on the basis of non-normalized expression levels. a normalization factor (NF) based on the geometric mean of the best performing reference genes was calculated. the 3 most stable reference genes were used to calculate the normalization factor (NF3). a method for gDNA free RNA extraction from embryos was optimized. a reference gene assay for reliable normalization of real-time qPCR data was designed. the use of a single reference gene is not reliable and will result in erroneous conclusions. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was isolated from 20 pooled embryos using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the kit is engineered to recover high-quality total RNA from pico-scale samples.

PCR amplicons were characterized using Mfold [40] in order to predict the nature of any secondary structures which might influence the PCR efficiency. the other primers were designed by the Primer 3 software [39]. real-time quantitative PCR Three replicates of 20 pooled embryos were used for each developmental stage (2-cell, 8-cell, blastocyst and hatched blastocyst) all PCR reactions were performed in a 15 l reaction volume on the iCycler iQ real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Nazareth) each reaction was run in duplicate, whereby a no-template control was included. the geNorm Visual Basic application for Microsoft Excel was used as described by Vandesompele et al."}
