{"summary": "the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in Europe is 33/100,000 in the age group 5 years. the risk group of severe disease course includes children 5 years of age. there are no clinical, radiological, or biochemical markers that would enable the differentiation between bacterial and viral infections. traditional bacterial cultures are insufficient to establish the etiology. this especially concerns children in their first year of life, in whom viral infections may be responsible for even 67% of pneumonia cases. the currently used molecular examinations enable quick identification of numerous pathogens. fTD respiratory pathogens 33 is an in vitro test with eight multiplex real-time PCR reactions. indications included radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia nonresponding to standard therapy, the presence of complications, for example, impaired immunity. positive microbiological cultures defined a 105 CFU/mL. all the described tests were done as diagnostic tests during hospitalization. informed consent was obtained from parents/legal guardians on admission to hospital. number of patients 97 Mean age (months) 56.3 Male/female ratio 52/45 ICU admission 53 (54%) Airways obturation 44 (44%) Coexisting diseases 90 (92.78%) Heart diseases 21 (20%) CHD 17 HF 2 HA 1 Neurologic diseases 13 (13%) Cerebral palsy 7 Epilepsy 4 Myopathy 2 Neoplastic diseases 9 (9%) ALL 6 Solid tumor 3 Pulmonary diseases 12 (12%) Asthma 8 CF 4 Immunos viral and bacterial Total number H. influenzae 0 1 11 0 2 14 S. pneumoniae 0 2 3 0 3 8 S. aureus 3 3 2 0 3 11 Klebsiella 0 0 1 0 1 2 Moraxella 0 0 1 0 1 3 Mycoplasma 1 0 0 1 0 1 3 RSV 11 4 6 1 1 23 RH 5 4 2 1 7 19 AdV 3 1 2 0 5 11 hMPV 3 on admission 54% of children with negative real-time PCR results had elevated procalcitonin levels. this proportion is significantly higher when compared to patient with established etiology. the prevalence of increased procalcitonin levels was higher in patients without established etiology. blood cultures were performed in 75 children, in 62 cases they were sterile. bacterial flora growth occurred in 13 cases, and in 3 (4%) cases it was pathological. in 8 of these cases the results were confirmed with multiplex real-time PCR tests. aureus Sa Pseud 0 E.coli Sa X 0 Serratia Pseud Pseud 0 Positive respiratory tract aspirate 0 X Sa RH/AdV/Sa X X Sp RH/Sp 0 X Hinf, Klebs RH/Hinf 0 X Hinf RH/AdV/Hinf 0 F E.coli RSV/CMV/Hinf 0 NP: Pneumocystis jiroveci; Pseud: Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Sp: Streptococcus pneumoniae; X: test not done; and 0: negative results. targeted therapy implemented based on FTD33 positive results. etiology of 85% of pneumonia cases was diagnosed in children under the age of five with the use of the PCR method. in 67% the results pointed to the presence of viruses and in 52% bacteria. in 33% of the children the etiology was mixed. establishing the presence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract is considered as a probable etiological factor. positive results may also be achieved in individuals in temporary asymptomatic carrier state during convalescence after a previous infection. the group we analyzed was unique due to the high participation of patients with comorbidities, some of them in immunosuppression. the diagnosis of a viral etiology of infection enables moderate use of antibiotics and allows for more emphasis on symptomatic treatment. the conducted analysis showed limited usefulness of traditional microbiological examinations in the diagnostic process of pneumonia. 91.8% of the diagnoses were based on positive results of real-time PCR tests conducted on material collected from the respiratory tract. in 11 of these cases there was agreement with the results of multiplex real-time PCR tests. we have collected a heterogenic group of patients (different indication for testing, different comorbidities, and chronic diseases) the number of patients and the number of specimens were too small to perform elaborate statistical analysis."}
