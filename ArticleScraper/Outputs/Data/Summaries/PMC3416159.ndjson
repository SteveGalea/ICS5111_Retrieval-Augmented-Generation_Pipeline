{"summary": "alphaherpesviruses, gammaherpesviruses, and betacoronaviruses block host gene expression by promoting global mRNA degradation. mRNA degradation in alphaherpesviruses is induced by vhs (14, 18), a nuclease of the FEN1 family. this enables recruitment of the cellular Xrn1 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease. this then completes degradation of the cleaved intermediates (1). roles for cellular nucleases in host shutoff by these factors remain untested. these factors have been characterized in vitro, but less is known about their specificity and activity in cells. cells were transfected with plasmids expressing KSHV SOX (pCDEF3-SOX [6]), MHV68 muSOX (pCDEF3-HA-muSOX [2]), EBV BGLF5 (pCDEF3-HA-BGLF5 [19]), HSV-1 vhs (pCDNA3.1-vhs [9]), and SCoV nsp1 (pCAGGS-nsp1 hs (100 to 200 ng/ml), nsp1 (200 to 300 ng/ml) and a corresponding amount of the empty vector to bring the total concentration of plasmid per transfection to 1 g/ml. mRNA targeting occurred before or after ribosome recruitment in cells. nsp1 is likely recruited to RNA through its interactions with the 40S subunit (10) hairpin location masks the region of the mRNA in which cleavage occurs in nsp1-expressing cells. nsp1 is likely recruited to RNA through its interactions with the 40S subunit (10) HEK293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts (100, 200, and 400 ng/ml) of either a control GFP reporter or hp-GFP. the levels of GFP were assessed by a Western blot, and actin served as a loading control. reporter mRNA levels were visualized by a Northern blot. a protected fragment was visible in cells expressing each of the host shutoff factors, indicating a role for Xrn1 in exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA body after the primary endonucleolytic cleavage. we examined degradation of two different reporter mRNAs by each viral protein in cells subjected to small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of Xrn1. muSOX, muSOX, and BGLF5 produced different degradation patterns. this suggests that even among highly related proteins, distinct sequences or elements may direct cleavage. each host shutoff factor requires Xrn1 for completion of mRNA degradation. host shutoff factors are recruited to mRNAs either through the ribosome (nsp1) or the cap-binding complex (vhs) or through yet-unknown factors (SOX, muSOX, and BGLF5). they then mediate endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage near the cap (muSOX, nsp1) or at one or more internal positions (SOX, BGLF5, vhs), whereupon host gammaherpesvirus has hijacked the same process of endonuclease-triggered mRNA destruction in at least three separate biochemical ways. it is possible that this strategy is advantageous because it is rapid, resembles some host pathways."}
