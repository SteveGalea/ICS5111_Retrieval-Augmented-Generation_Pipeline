{"summary": "adenoviruses cause keratoconjunctivitis, respiratory, urogenital and intestinal tract infectious diseases. adenoviruses may persist in the lymphoid tissue of the tonsils and adenoids for a long time, causing upper respiratory tract infections in adults. anti-adenoviral activity was shown in vitro for nucleotide analogs. adenoviruses have effective mechanisms that suppress the interferon-induced antiviral cascade. they are resistant to the action of interferon and its inducers. the development of new antiviral drugs that would be effective against adenoviruses without adverse effects is very urgent. exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of the genera Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus were extracted, purified and accumulated by the researchers from the department of physiology of industrial microbiology. the infectious titer of the virus was 7.0 107 PFU/mL. sources used to extract exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and genera of lactic acid bacteria producing respective EPS. EPS Source of Extracted EPS Genus of Lactic Acid Bacteria 6a pickled apples Pediococcus sp. 48a pickled apples Leuconostoc sp. 2t pickled tomato juice Leuconostoc sp. 19s sauerkraut Leuconostoc sp. 26a pickled apples % decrease of cell viability under condition of EPS action was calculated by the following formula. EPS concentration at which cell viability was inhibited by 50% (CC50) was estimated in comparison to control cells not treated with EPSs. cells were infected with HAdV-5 (the multiplicity of the infection) after 1.5 h, the virus-containing medium was removed, and 200 L of serum-free medium was added. EPSs Were Added Post-Infection The MDBK cells were first infected with HAdV-5 at 50 L/well. cells were infected with serial ten-fold diluted lysates of cells previously infected with adenovirus. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C at 5% CO2 for 5 days. cells were covered with 1% methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 2% fetal bovine serum. the results were expressed as mean S.D. for three independent experiments. the Student\u2019s t-test (unpaired, two-sided t-test) was used to evaluate the difference between the test sample and control. Pediococcus, leuconostoc and Lactobacillus were extracted, purified and accumulated by the researchers at the Zabolotny Institute of Microbiology and Virology of Ukraine. sources used to extract exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and genera of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) producing respective EPS. the plates were read using a multiskan FC (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a 538-nm test wavelength. percentage decrease of cell viability under the condition of EPS action was calculated by the following formula: % decrease of cell viability = 100 (A/B 100) EPSs were added 100 L of EPSs at concentrations of 20, 100 and 500 g/mL. cells were infected with HAdV-5 (the multiplicity of the infection) after 1.5 h, the virus-containing medium was removed. 200 L of serum-free medium was added. to MDBK cells were added 100 L of EPSs at the concentrations of 20, 100 and 500 g/mL. cells were infected with HAdV-5 (the multiplicity of the infection) after 1.5 h, the virus-containing medium was removed, and 200 L of serum-free medium was added. cells were grown in a 24-well plate (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) to form a 100% monolayer. cells were infected with serial ten-fold diluted lysates of cells previously infected with adenovirus. cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C at 5% CO2 for 5 days. 97\u201399% demonstrates a moderate effect and less than 97% shows a relative activity [22]. Statistical analysis was performed according to standard approaches for calculating statistical errors (standard deviation) using Microsoft Excel 2010. the effect of EPSs on the MDBK cell populations was studied. cells were fixed and dyed with fluorochrome propidium iodide. the method allowed the estimation of the distribution of cells by their structure and cell cycle phases. 19s decreased the number of cells in the G1 phase up to 16%. EPSs 6a, 48a, and 6s increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase by 11\u201342%. only EPSs 48a, 26a and 6s showed low antiviral activity, reducing virus reproduction by 23\u201367%. adenoviral infection has been reported to have effects on the cell cycle. it is well-known that adenoviral E1 gene products interact with pRb (retinoblastoma protein), causing the release of E2F transcription factor. adenoviral infection has been reported to have effects on the cell cycle. the number of cells in the G1 phase decreased by 67%, whereas the number of cells in the S phase is doubled. the reduction of the cell population in G1 phases demonstrated the suppression of the transition of cells through the mitotic phase. as infected cells enter the S phase and the G2/M phase is blocked, cells produce viral DNA, late viral proteins and virions. a significant increase in the number of cells in the G1 phase (1.5\u20132 times) compared with infected cells. a decrease in the number of cells in the synthetic phase by 18\u201329%, indicating normalization of the cell cycle of infected cells to the level of uninfected cells. cells were fixed and dyed with fluorochrome propidium iodide and analyzed using flow cytometry. the approach allowed the estimation of the distribution of cells by their structure and cell cycle phases. EPSs 48a and 19s decreased the number of cells in the G1 phase up to 16% compared to control cells. anti-HAdV-5 activity of EPSs was confirmed by measuring virus yield synthesized de novo using a plaque reduction assay. only EPSs 48a, 26a and 6s showed low antiviral activity, reducing virus reproduction by 23\u201367%. results are presented as percentage of infectious virus titer reduction. the use of Ribavirin at concentrations of 32\u2013125 g/mL after infection of the cells with adenovirus resulted in a decrease in HAdV-5 reproduction by 96.3\u201399.8%. adenoviral infection has been reported to have effects on the cell cycle. population in the G1 phase demonstrated the suppression of the transition of cells through the mitotic phase. as infected cells enter the S phase and the G2/M phase is blocked, cells produce viral DNA, late viral proteins and virions. these cells are destroyed and detach from the monolayer. LAB exopolysaccharides have unique physical and rheological properties. EPS producing strains were found among representatives of the genera Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and Weissella. producers were found among representatives of the genera Lactobacillus, leuconostoc and Pediococcus isolated from pickled apples, pickled tomato juice, and sauerkraut. EPSs in the studied concentrations are not toxic to MDBK cells, since they reduce cell viability only up to 17%. the EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced HAdV-5 infectivity up to 85%. the inhibitory effects were observed only when EPSs were added to cells at the end of the virus adsorption period. however, only EPS 26a reduced the titer of the virus obtained de novo. bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides have an apparent virucidal effect on influenza, HSV-1 and -2, HIV and Newcastle disease. hydrogen peroxide plays an essential role as a natural microbocide within the vaginal ecosystem. lactobacillus sp. can produce compounds that inhibit replication of the viruses. LAB strains produced EPS 26a suppressing yield of virus particles. EPS 26a produced by Lactobacillus sp. suppressed yield of viruses particles. further investigation is needed to explore antiviral mechanism of EPS."}
