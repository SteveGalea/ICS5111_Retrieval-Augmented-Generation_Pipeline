{"summary": "the virus is closely related to human pathogens herpes simplex virus 1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in adult swine, wild-type PRV infection causes respiratory and reproductive disorders with a low mortality rate. in these non-natural hosts, wild-type PRV infection causes a severe pruritus called \u2018the mad itch\u2019 with peracute death. innate immune system is first line of defense against herpesvirus infections. innate immune system is first line of defense against herpesvirus infections. detection of viral components by PRRs in host cells activates distinct intracellular signaling cascades. type I IFN comprises both IFN- and - and is produced as the first wave of antiviral defense against viral infections. virulent PRV-Becker infection suppresses the expression of most IFN-stimulated genes in primary rat fibroblasts through inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation. virulent PRV-Becker infection induces high levels of IL-6 and G-CSF in mouse tissues early after infection. we first determined the early kinetics of G-CSF and IL-6 production in several tissues of PRV-Becker infected mice. IL-6 levels detected in PRV-Becker infected and control mouse tissues. protein levels were quantified by ELISA and expressed as picogram (pg) per milligram (mg) of tissue. five mice per group were used per experiment. the high levels of G-CSF and IL-6 detected in the footpad and DRGs are not caused by the rapid increase of immune cell infiltrates. both abraded footpads of PRV-Becker and control mice resulted in minimal to moderate epidermal necrosis in all animals. mice mock inoculated or inoculated with PRV-Becker, UV-inactivated PRV-Becker, PRV-Bartha, or a gB null mutant (PRV 233) by ELISA showed comparable levels of G-CSF in the footpad and DRGs. culated with either mock or PRV-Becker, UV-inactivated PRV-Becker, PRV-Bartha or PRV gB null mutant at 7 hpi. protein levels were measured in the footpad (A) and DRGs (B) of corresponding mice. we first quantified the PRV load in the footpad of PRV-Becker infected TLR2 KO mice at 24 hpi by qPCR analysis. at 82 hpi, we could not detect PRV DNA in the footpad, DRGs, spinal cord and brain of all five PRV-Becker infected mice. PRV-Becker replication is limited in the footpad of TLR2 KO mice. the infection does not spread and replicate in the DRGs. however, the infection does not spread and replicate in the DRGs. PRV-Bartha, but not PRV-Becker, elicited a significant increase of IFN- in the footpad, DRGs and plasma of inoculated mice at 7 and 24 hpi. at 24 hpi, IFN- levels rapidly decreased to control levels. mice showed mild inflammation and redness of the inoculated footpad. no tremors or intense scratching and biting of the footpad were reported. ELISA quantified levels of IL-6 and G-CSF in plasma. virulent PRV-Becker infection induces high levels of IL-6 and G-CSF in mouse tissues early after infection. by 24 and 48 hpi, G-CSF levels decreased again in both tissues and were comparable to controls. the level of IL-6 was significantly higher in all tissues of PRV-Becker infected mice compared to controls. for each tissue, the IL-6 concentrations reached a plateau starting from 24 hpi to 82hpi. no viral inclusion bodies were observed within the footpad at both time points. neutrophilic inflammation was considered secondary to loss of epidermal barrier due to the abrasion rather than a primary effect of the virus. we measured PRV DNA in DRGs at different time post-infection. no PRV-Becker DNA was detected in DRGs at 7, 24 and 48 hpi. therefore, high G-CSF and IL-6 levels detected in DRGs could not be attributed to extensive viral replication in DRGs. mice inoculated with PRV-Bartha or PRV 233 did not show significant G-CSF levels in both footpad and DRGs compared to control groups. primary replication of PRV-Becker in the footpad is required to activate DRGs to produce G-CSF at 7 hpi. all five PRV-Becker infected mice remained asymptomatic at 82 hpi. the inoculated footpad did not show any signs of inflammation. the inoculated footpad did not show any signs of inflammation. PRV-Becker infected TLR2 KO mice showed significantly less PRV DNA in the footpad (approx. 1.2 x 102 PFU/mg of tissue) at 82 hpi, we could not detect PRV DNA in the footpad, DRGs, spinal cord and brain of all five PRV-Becker inoculated TLR2 KO mice. we measured levels of G-CSF and IL-6 in tissues of PRV-Becker inocul at 7 hpi, both PRV-Becker and PRV-Bartha infections trigger significant IFN- production in DRGs compared to the control group (p0.01) at 24 hpi, IFN- levels significantly decreased to control levels. no significant IFN- production was detected in the footpad, DRGs and plasma of inoculated mice at anytime. PRV-Bartha infected IFNAR KO mice did not show a significant increase of body temperature or weight loss compared to control group at 82 hpi. however, PRV-Bartha infected mice showed mild inflammation and redness of the footpad compared to control group at 82 hpi. infection by PRV-Bartha, but not by PRV-Becker, strongly induces production of IFN- in the footpad, in DRGs, and in plasma of inoculated mice at 7 hpi. virulent PRV infection of mice has been shown to induce a specific and lethal systemic inflammatory response. virulent PRV strain Becker and an attenuated vaccine strain, PRV Bartha. we first showed that high levels of G-CSF and IL-6 are produced in most tissues of PRV-Becker infected mice at early time post-infection. a peak of G-CSF and IL-6 were detected in the footpad and DRGs at 7 and 24 hpi. PRV-Bartha is known to have slower replication kinetics than PRV-Becker. infection by PRV-Bartha induces a strong IFN response in cells. the PRV gB null mutant can initiate one round of replication. in vitro studies will further characterize the interaction of PRV-Becker and PRV-Bartha gB with TLR2 expressed in neurons. the results are in accordance with a previous study from Lamote, Kestens [24]. PRV-Becker elicits a strong IFN response in pDC mice. virulent PRV-Becker infection triggers an exceptional inflammatory response. the imbalance between antiviral and pro-inflammatory immune responses is likely to contribute to the distinct clinical outcomes. il-6 has also been implicated in the cytokine storm initiated following influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections [36, 37]. this results further suggest that PRV-Becker infection in mice induces a biphasic inflammatory response controlled by DRG neurons. the increase in cytokine mRNA expression occurred simultaneously with the appearance of viral mRNA in TG of PRV infected 15-week-old pigs. this study concluded age-dependent differences in PRV-induced clinical signs are due to enhanced viral replication and associated immunopathology in immature trigeminal ganglion and central nervous system neurons. DRG neurons play an important role in modulation of peripheral and central sensory processing, such as inflammation and neuropathic pain. the interaction of G-CSF with its receptor has been shown to cause hyperexcitability of DRG neurons during colitis [46]. PRV-Becker efficiently replicates and spreads in the epidermal cells of the mouse footpad. both cytokines are released in (a) DRG neurons and (b) locally at axon terminals innervating the footpad. type I IFN molecules released from infected epidermal cells can bind to their receptors and directly prime DRG neurons to an antiviral state. a study from Song, Koyuncu showed that type I IFN- applied to isolated axons induces a local response that limits transport of PRV virus particles. the wild-type virulent PRV strain (PRV-Becker) and live-attenuated PRV strain (PRV-Bartha) were used in this study. PRV-Becker is a virulent field isolate from dog, originally isolated at Iowa State University (USA), with subsequent laboratory passage. mice were anesthetized with 1\u20133% isoflurane gas and the right hind footpad was gently abraded about 20 times with an emery board until the stratum corneum was removed. a 20-l droplet of virus inoculum containing 8.106 plaque-forming unit (PFU) of PRV-Becker, UV-PRV-Becker, PRV 232 or 108 PFU of PRV-Bartha was resuspended pad, ipsilateral DRGs, spinal cord, brain, heart, lungs, spleen, pancreas, liver, kidneys and bladder were collected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. tissue was weighed and placed in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube containing a sterile steel bead (Qiagen) and 500 l modified RIPA buffer containing 0.5M EDTA, pH 8.0; 1M Tris-HCl, ELISAs The quantitation of single analyte IL-6, G-CSF, type I IFN ( and) levels in plasma and/or tissue homogenates was performed using commercial ELISA kits from Thermo Fischer, Qiagen, Biolegend and Invitrogen. all samples were measured in duplicate. amplification conditions consisted of pre-incubation at 95\u00b0 for 2 min and 40 cycles of denaturation (5 seconds at 95\u00b0C), annealing (20 seconds at 55\u00b0C), and extension (10 seconds at 72\u00b0C). the specific target amplification was analyzed by melt-curve analysis using the mastercycler ep realplex 2.2 software. a Kruskall-Wallis test followed by a Mann-Whitney post-hoc test were performed. values in the text, graphs, and figure legends throughout the manuscript are means + or standard deviations (SDs) PRV 232 is a gB-null strain expressing VP26-GFP. titers were determined in PK15 cells stably transfected with LP64e3. a thin layer of viral suspension was exposed to short-wave UV light for 10 min. the inoculum was gently rubbed 5 to 10 times with the shaft of an 18-gauge hypodermic needle to facilitate adsorption of the virus. mice were kept under anesthesia for 30 minutes (min) until the abraded footpad was dry and then the animals were placed in separate cages for further analysis. blood collection Whole blood (approx. 300 l) was collected by cardiac puncture after CO2 asphyxiation. samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 x g, 4\u00b0C to separate cells from plasma and then for 15 min at 2,000 x g, 4\u00b0C to deplete platelets. en-20 for 60 min at 55\u00b0C followed by inactivation for 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C prior to qPCR run. amplification reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 l. amplification reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 l. the amounts of PRV DNA in samples were obtained by plotting Ct values onto the standard curve and expressed as PFU/mg of tissue. the conversion of genome copies to PFU was done for convenience of comparison of previous published data. the public health service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals; the Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate animals used in testing, research and training; and the Health Research Extension Act of 1985."}
