{"summary": "microbiological evidence of infection must be considered in the context of several fundamental difficulties found in respiratory diagnostics. this includes the frequent lack of access to the site of infection, the insensitivity of available tests, and insufficient assay validation. PERCH investigators conducted an extensive review of the microbiologic diagnosis of respiratory infections. NADT methods present less of a safety hazard for laboratory personnel compared with culture, typically require less time compared with bacterial culture, and require less technical capacity compared with viral culture. molecular diagnostic platforms are not without their disadvantages. cost and complexity remain significant barriers to adoption in many laboratories. multiplex Molecular Diagnostic Platforms Considered by the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health Project Platform (Commercially Available Examples) Advantages Disadvantages Selected References Liquid-phase suspension array (Luminex, MassTag, IBIS) Capacity for >20 targets in 1 reaction Requires specialized equipment; decreased sensitivity, particularly with co-infections. several respiratory diagnostic systems have been based on a liquid-phase technology using polystyrene microbeads (Luminex) [9, 10, 13\u201315, 32] or mass spectroscopy [33, 34] for amplicon discrimination. complexity, specialized equipment, and high start-up costs have limited their widespread adoption. multiplex NADTs for bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes have been evaluated in respiratory specimens [45] and will likely be incorporated into larger multiplexing assays. the distinction between \u201canalytic\u201d and \u201cspecificity\u201d is common to the field of diagnostics evaluation. analytic sensitivity refers to the lowest concentration of target that can be detected. analytic specificity measures the ability of the test to exclude undesired targets despite similar genetic sequences. clinical performance characteristics are subject to a number of factors, including the patient\u2019s disease status, variations in the concentration of the target throughout the course of illness. respiratory diagnostics are complicated by the absence of a perfect gold standard. serologic tests are often not available and usually require paired serum specimens for accurate results. the fda has recently published industry guidance that may encourage additional work in this area. PERCH developed a list of candidate diagnostic systems that met our initial criteria, and developed a short list of candidate platforms. this process allowed us to engage with the assay manufacturers and their academic partners, directly compare the performance characteristics of the platforms. this process allowed us to communicate our strategy more effectively to collaborators, advisors, and assay developers. the field of molecular diagnostics is rapidly evolving, with constant improvements in accuracy, speed, automation, and cost. however, the field of molecular diagnostics is rapidly evolving, with constant improvements in accuracy, speed, automation, and cost. the contents of this article are solely the responsibility of the authors."}
