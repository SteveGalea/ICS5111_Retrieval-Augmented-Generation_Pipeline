{"summary": "the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme includes \"Personal Health Skills\" as one of its key aspects to improve student hygiene knowledge and practices. study examines differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between those schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those that have not adopted. schools have become an important setting to build up the skills and capacity for students, parents and the wider community to combat the challenges of outbreak of communicable diseases. a hygiene program can produce a sustained increase in hand washing rates among toilet-trained preschool children [10]. a health program can produce a sustained increase in hand washing rates among toilet-trained preschool children. the participating schools attended training programme on development planning. the project team met with the co-ordinating group of the school to identify and prioritize four to five areas of potential action. the amount of support given varied from area to area. at the time of the study there were 24 primary and 17 secondary schools that had obtained awards for HPS. a sample size of 240 were needed for each group. random sampling method was used to target at least 500 students from primary and secondary schools. the complete questionnaire had been pilot tested in a primary school for face-validity and reliability with good results. the 2-week test-retest reliability has shown all the items with kappa statistic 0.7 or higher. random sampling method was used to target at least 500 students from primary and secondary schools in HSA category and 750 non-HPS category. schools were randomly selected from each category and letters of invitation were sent out in lots of tens to the selected schools. 2-week test-retest reliability has shown all the items with kappa statistic 0.7 or higher. 510 students and 789 students were sampled from 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools respectively. the response rate from students of the participating schools was nearly 100% for all the schools. the mean age of the participants from primary schools was 11.15 (S.D. 0.95) and 11.54 (S.D. 1.56) year-old in HSA and non-HPS schools respectively. there was a significant difference between HSA schools and non-HPS schools in teachers reminding students to wash their hand before meals. teachers reminded students to wash hands before meal Primary 65.2% (332/509) 75.9% (491/647) 0.001 Secondary 31.9% (251/786) 8.3% (60/722) 0.001. correct coping when fever Primary 80.9% (412/509) 75.2%(507/674) 0.02 Secondary 64.0% (497/777) 58.0%(418/721) 0.02 Tooth Brushing and Bathing Table 2 shows that in primary schools, higher proportion school health policy There was no significant difference amongst primary school children encouraged to wear face mask or staying away from school if they had symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) however difference was observed in mask wearing between the HSA and non-HPS secondary schools (86.8% vs 80.4%) and in staying away from schools if students had URTI symptoms (93.6% vs 90.1%) with statistical significance. the organization of activities to promote health and hygiene was also reported by higher proportion of students from the HSA than the non-HPS group in both primary and secondary schools (60.9% vs. 56.7%) and secondary schools (53.7% vs. 37.0%, p 0.001). 73.6% of students in the HSA group chose ''very clean'' or ''clean'' for playground hygiene. more HSA primary (75.0% vs. 64.4%; p 0.001) and secondary (52.5% vs. 34.2%, p 0.001) students perceived their schools having assigned prefects to monitor or help with cleaning. more HSA primary school students reported having prefects for environmental protection (63.1% vs. 59.7%), and similarly in secondary schools (49.4% vs. 23.7%) with statistical significance (p 0.001). literacy on health and hygiene In most areas of health-related knowledge, it was found that the majority of students in both groups have ever acquired related knowledge. higher proportion of primary school students in HSA group had chosen \"very much\" or \"quite a lot\" higher proportion of students in HSA group had chosen \"very much\" or \"quite a lot\" in getting health information from student health ambassadors. a significant difference was detected between HSA schools and non-HPS schools in teachers reminding students to wash their hand before meals. also higher proportion of secondary school students washed hands with their own initiatives before meals. teachers reminded students to wash hands before meal Primary 65.2% (332/509) 75.9% (491/647) 0.001 Secondary 31.9% (251/786) 8.3% (60/722) 0.001 4. Brush teeth after meal always Primary 99.6% (506/508) 98.1% (663/676) 0.02 Secondary 98.9% (777/786) 98.3% (710/722) 0.39 6. correct coping when fever Primary 80.9% (412/509) 75.2% teachers reminded students to wash their hand before meals. higher proportion of secondary school students washed hands with their own initiatives before meals. HSA primary school students reported a significantly higher proportion than non-HPS schools (99.6% vs. 98.1%, p = 0.02; table 2). Correct self care with fever Higher proportion of students from both primary and secondary schools coped correctly when they had fever. in secondary schools, higher proportion of students from the HSA group reported that teachers had mentioned the Hygiene Charter website (28% vs 15.3%; p 0.001). higher proportion of students from the HSA group felt that their schools joined community cleaning with statistical significance (p = 0.04). toilets perceived as very clean Primary 34.7% (176/507) 38.5% (259/673) 0.18 Secondary 29.7% (233/784) 27.6% (199/721) 0.36 7. Staircases perceived as very clean or clean Primary 77.2% (392/508) 76.2% (513/673) 0.71 Secondary 68.7% (540/786) 63.3% (457/722) 0.03 8. Tuckshop perceived as very clean or clean Primary 75.0% (38 more HSA primary (75.0% vs. 64.4%; p 0.001) and secondary (52.5% vs. 34.2%, p 0.001) students perceived their schools having assigned prefects to monitor or help with cleaning with statistical significance. there was no significant difference between the HSA and non-HPS groups in the overall scores for both categories. higher proportion of primary school students in HSA group had chosen \"very much\" or \"quite a lot\" in getting health information from student health ambassadors. higher proportion of students in HSA group had chosen \"quite a lot\" studies have shown that students from schools who had comprehensively embraced the HPS concept were better, in terms of health and educational outcomes, than students from schools that did not reach the standard of the award. 'healthy schools award' builds on the concept of HPS which helps to create a supportive environment for healthy development in schools, home and the community. many of these gains have occurred without a specific health 'intervention' a whole school approach to build and maintain a caring school social environment might be the most effective way in achieving good health outcomes. the success of HPS depends heavily on teachers' training like health education diploma programmes. a descriptive design was adopted instead of randomised control study design because one cannot randomly select schools from all schools in Hong Kong as intervention group. study demonstrated that schools involved in HPS activities through the HSA scheme in Hong Kong had more favorable hygiene practice of students, school environment and atmosphere in health and hygienic practice."}
