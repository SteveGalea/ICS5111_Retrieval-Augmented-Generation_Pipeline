{"summary": "CSF Specimens We tested 332 consecutively submitted CSF samples from 319 patients 4 years of age from Denmark. the study was approved by the local ethics committee, de Videnskabsetiske Komiteer for Region Hovedstaden, Denmark. the reaction mixtures contained 1 mol/L of each primer and 0.2 mol/L of probe. design of the primers and probe was based on an alignment of all available SAFV sequences in GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) the sequences have been submitted to GenBank under accession nos. JF693612\u201323. the sequences have been submitted to GenBank under accession nos. JF693612\u201323. primers and probe are selective for a highly conserved part of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (Table) the primers and probe are selective for a highly conserved part of the 5\u2032 untranslated region. sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession nos. JF693612\u201323. child 1 child 1 was a 16-month-old, previously healthy boy who became ill in may 2009. the boy had a fever 6 days before hospital admission, followed by sudden onset of monosymptomatic ataxia, with no fever. no history of recent travel was reported. a small vascular malformation surrounded by edema was found in the brain. a small vascular malformation surrounded by edema was found in the brain. no signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome were found. phylogenetic tree showed partial viral protein 1 capsid sequences (588 nt) from the Saffold virus strains identified from 2 children from Denmark, 2009. tree was constructed by neighbor-joining method by using MEGA4 software. d positive test results for parechovirus type 3 and negative results for enterovirus and adenovirus. the diagnosis at this time was viral encephalitis, possibly caused by parechovirus type 3. phylogenetic tree showed partial viral protein 1 capsid sequences (588 nt) from the Saffold virus strains identified from 2 children from Denmark, 2009. the tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method by using MEGA4 software (www.megasoftware.net) parechovirus type 3 was found in a fecal sample taken 2 weeks after onset of disease. a small vascular malformation surrounded by edema was found. this edema could be the cause of the herniation. enteroviruses are known to cause many more or less organ-specific diseases such as central nervous system infection (meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis), myocarditis, enanthema, exanthema, and septicemia."}
