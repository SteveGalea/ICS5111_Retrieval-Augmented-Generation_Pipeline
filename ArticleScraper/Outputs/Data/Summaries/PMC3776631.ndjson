{"summary": "Approximately 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), putting them at a higher risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. 25% of individuals spontaneously clear the virus during the acute stage of infection. recombinant virus vectors, such as rAd and rVV, are advantageous in terms of their induction of the cellular immune response. pseudotyped virus-like particles with HCV E1/E2 envelope proteins (HCVpp) can induce high-titre antigen-specific antibodies and nAbs. NS3 is essential for HCV clearance as it induces an early and sustained cell-mediated immune response. both structural proteins and the NS3 antigen are targets for HCV vaccine development. research has begun to focus increasingly on replicating-deficient vaccinia virus Ankara-based vaccines. HCV CE1E2 proteins (1\u2013746 aa) and full-length NS3 (aa1024-1658) are enclosed by a box that indicates the amino acid sites, C44p is a recombinant protein comprising HCV NS3' (1201-1465aa) with Core' (1\u201334 aa) in its C-terminal. gG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres were assessed every 2 weeks after immunization (inverted triangle) only four monkeys were immunized with rAd-HCV and were assessed in the weeks indicated by italicized numbers. rhesus macaques divided into three groups were immunized with rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, and rAd-HCV. anti-E1 and -E2 responses in group B (rNTV-HCV priming and rAd-HCV boosting) were significantly higher than those in the other two groups. cross-neutralization of samples was tested at a dilution of 1:50 for their capacity to neutralize infection with HCVpp of various strains and genotypes. data are expressed as the means SD of the percentage of neutralization of HCVpp by sera tested in triplicate. rNTV-HCV prime and rAd-HCV boost regimens induce superior HCV-specific T-cell\u2013mediated immunity in macaques. rNTV-HCV prime and rAd-HCV boost regimens induce superior HCV-specific T-cell\u2013mediated immunity. level in the group with rNTV-HCV prime/rAd-HCV boost was detectable up to week 74 (range: 121\u2013496 SFU/million PBMCs) rAd-primed group was then boosted with HCVpp at week 24. but two boosts with HCVpps did not significantly reinforce the T-cell response. rNTV-HCV priming group exhibited significant enhancements in all four peptides, especially after boosting with rAd-HCV at week 36. rNTV-HCV priming group induced two monkeys in the group to be positive to E1, all positive to E2, and three positive to NS3. this was the only vaccine that was effective after a single administration. PBMCs from vaccinated rhesus macaques were cocultured with 4 g/ml peptides. after 2 days in culture, cytokines in supernatants were assayed by Luminex. the cytokine levels were divided by those of the negative control. all vaccinations elicited a humoral response to the target HCV antigens in macaques. the construction and enrichment of the rAd-HCV, rNTV-HCV, and HCVpp vaccine candidates were reported in our previous work. twelve rhesus macaques were immunized I.M. with the vaccines indicated in Table 1. only four monkeys were immunized with rAd-HCV. boosting with rAd-HCV increased antibody titres against E1 and E2. no increased production of antibodies against E1, E2 or NS3 was detected. serum samples were collected at weeks (a,c) +26 and (b,d) +38 from macaques. cross-neutralization of samples was tested at a dilution of 1:50 for their capacity to neutralize infection with HCVpp. rNTV-HCV prime and rAd-HCV boost regimens induce superior HCV-specific T-cell\u2013mediated immunity in macaques. no CMI was detected in macaques primed with HCVpp at weeks 22 and 28. four monkeys primed with rNTV-HCV showed strong CMI responses. the response decreased markedly by week 32 in the group with rNTV-HCV priming. but marked enhancement resulted from rAd-HCV vaccination boosting. responses to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) insert antigen in PBMCs of each group over time are shown. bars represent the median group response with each animal displayed as a single point. rNTV-HCV priming group exhibited significant enhancements in all four peptides. freshly isolated PBMC were stimulated with the HCV peptide pools. the supernatants were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after stimulation. commercial cytokine kits were used following manufacturer's instructions and their respective standards. MC of the group that received rNTV/rAd vaccination were higher than those of the other groups. the rNTV-rAd group also showed enhancement of Th2 cytokines. it correlated with the strongest HCV-specific humoral immune response. rNTV is a novel viral vector vaccine based on the Tiantan strain of vaccinia virus. it is a highly attenuated strain used widely as a safe viral vector to deliver antigens. rNTV exhibits DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein expression similar to the original Tiantan strain. rAd-HCV boosting can effectively enhance the CMI when rhesus macaques are primed with rNTV-HCV or HCVpp. previous studies have reported that an adenoviral vector strategy can induce sustained T-cell responses of a magnitude and quality. rAd prime and HCVpp boost vaccination also elicited strong humoral immune responses to HCV antigens in rhesus macaques. rAd-HCV boosting may play a more important role in the induction of a cross-neutralizing response by a vaccine. the genes encoding the core//E1/E2 proteins (aa1-746) and the non-structural component NS3 (aa1024-1658) of HCV subtype 1b (Hebei strain) were constructed previously. the gene was subcloned into the poxvirus shuttle vector pJSA1175. the rAd-HCV vaccines were cloned into the E1 region of the replication-defective adenoviral serotype 5 vector. both of the rAd-HCV vaccines were rescued and amplified in HEK293 cells. the monkeys were assigned to each group in a manner that ensured homogeneous age and body weight distributions. the total vaccine dose was suspended in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. the vaccines were delivered intramuscularly into both deltoid muscles via tuberculin syringes. luciferase activity in infected cells was measured using a Bright-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a CentroXS luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) the percentage of neutralization was calculated by comparing the luciferase activity in cells infected with HCVpp. detection antibody (7-B6-1-biotin) followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and development with TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate solution. results are presented as spot-forming cells per 106 PBMC. ELISA end-point titres were normalized by log10 transformation for analysis. comparisons of mean immune responses among groups of macaques were performed by the LSD (one-way analysis of variance) or Bonferroni (two-way analysis of variance) test."}
