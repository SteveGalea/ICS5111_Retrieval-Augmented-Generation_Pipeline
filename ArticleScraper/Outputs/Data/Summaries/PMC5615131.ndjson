{"summary": "certain bat species have been identified as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses associated with significant human morbidity and mortality. they are also suspected reservoirs of other viruses, such as the ebolaviruses, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses (4\u20136) each of these viruses can cause severe disease in humans but are not known to cause disease. each arenavirus is associated with a specific host species. the distribution of the host dictates the distribution of the virus. artibeus bats were reservoirs of TCRV given its original isolation. a total of 12 pooled samples were sequenced, generating 693,106,150 raw 100-bp paired-end reads. a total of 12 pooled samples were sequenced, generating 691,108,820 raw 100-bp paired-end reads. the global transcriptome was performed using Trinity. de novo assembly of the Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome was performed using RNA-Seq data from kidney, liver, and spleen tissues. differentially expressed genes were then identified in the uninfected and infected tissues using edgeR. the bat Brandt\u2019s myotis (Myotis brandtii) had the highest number of related sequences (8,060 similar sequences [Data Set S2] among other mammals were the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) each had a greater number of upregulated genes (251 and 188, respectively) compared to the number of downregulated genes in these tissues following TCRV infection. a comparison of all TCRV-infected tissues against all of the uninfected controls revealed 62 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes. genuity Pathway Analysis (IPA [Qiagen]) identified the interferon signaling pathway to be among the top pathways altered upon TCRV infection. we then examined the relationship between these factors within the spleen, kidney, and liver in response to TCRV infection. we validated differential expression of select immune genes via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. red corresponds to upregulated and orange to downregulated (FDR, 0.01; log2 fold change, >2); gray indicates no significant differential expression. red corresponds to upregulated and orange to downregulated (FDR, 0.01; log2 fold change, >2); gray indicates no significant differential expression. we identified signaling pathways for toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (among other cytokines) and pathways for T-helper cell differentiation. further analysis of all DEGs via the Reactome plugin identified additional key pathways involved in the immune response. signaling 0.000 2.0e0.04 0.000 5.0e04 0.000 5.0e04 IFN- signaling 0.000 9.1e05 0.000 1.0e03 0.000 2.5e04 Chemokine receptors bind chemokines 0.001 0.001 0.028 0.235 0.003 0.044 Innate immune response TLR cascades 0.005 0.009 0.000 2.5e04 0.081 0.615 MyD88-independent cascade 0.014 0.036 six transcripts of IgG heavy chains were identified, including 5 with complete and distinct V regions. the six IgG constant regions were identical, other than one that contained a Thr in place of an Ala. the hinge regions, which are frequently different between IgG subclasses within a species, were identical in all 6 transcripts. expression of TCR- was identified in all uninfected and infected tissues. expression of TCR- was identified in all uninfected and infected tissues. expression of TCR- was identified in all spleen and liver tissues. ive and congenital bile acid synthesis defect 3 (CBAS3) 0.000 0.000 Kidney, Collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes 0.000 0.000 Kidney, NCAM1 interactions 0.000 0.000 Kidney, + Chemokine receptors bind chemokines 0.000 0.001 Spleen, a, untreated; +, treated. genes involved in complement cascade were repressed, including the genes for phosphatidylinositol 3- IFNG itself was not differentially expressed in the livers. despite these findings, further indications of apoptotic activation were not expressed in the livers. a total of 12 pooled samples were sequenced, generating 693,106,150 raw 100-bp paired-end reads. de novo assembly of the global transcriptome was performed using Trinity. 349,855 assembled transcripts of 300 bp (mean length of 997 bp) with an N50 of 3,419 bases. tigs from the transcriptome assembly showed that 35% (12,600) are expressed in the spleen, kidney, and liver tissues (FRKM, >1). we compared this transcriptome assembly to those of other mammals through BLASTX analysis. the combined Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome was systematically annotated using the Trinotate pipeline. differential gene expression analysis was performed to investigate the molecular response of bats to TCRV infection. the spleen had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among these 1,912 DEGs, 1,187 were upregulated and 725 were downregulated following infection (Fig. 3C; false discovery rate [FDR], 0.01; log2 fold change, >2). Approximately 23% of the 4,723 genes available in the database corresponded to the differentially expressed genes annotated in our analysis. coordinating transcript expression values of these identified immune genes were used to evaluate the relationship between the specific uninfected and infected tissues. select immune genes via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed upregulation of ISG15 and IRF7 in the spleen and kidney tissues and downregulation of HLA-DRA in the kidney. we performed ingenuity pathway analysis to characterize the specific immune pathways for those genes identified in cluster 3 (n = 117) from panel A. copyright 2017 Gerrard et al. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

ISG15 can act to drive expression of IFN-, which was elevated in the spleen. intracellular expression can modulate type I IFN signaling (71). previous work examining in vitro infection of the black flying fox suggests a prominent role for IFN- (72). artibeus bats are suspected reservoirs of the recently discovered bat influenza viruses (56, 73, 74) this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional landscape of Jamaican fruit bats during infection with Tacaribe virus. study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional landscape of jamaican fruit bats during a pathogenic virus infection. this natural pathogen of artibeus bats causes high-mortality disease with similar clinical manifestations to the South American hemorrhagic fevers and Lassa fever. results suggest diverse immune responses, including alterations in neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, markers for lymphocytes, and antibodies. negative controls were culated with 100 l of sterile Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) as negative controls. negative control bats were euthanized at the end of the experimental period (45 days), whereas TCRV-infected bats were euthanized as they became moribund. RNA was extracted from flash-frozen tissues by homogenization with a mini bead beater. the complete list of differentially regulated genes in each organ can be found in Data Set S3. BLAST alignments and functional annotations were performed using Blast2GO Pro or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. two bats were inoculated with 100 l of sterile dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) as negative controls. negative control bats were euthanized at the end of the experimental period (45 days), whereas TCRV-infected bats were euthanized as they became moribund. a pairwise comparison was made between TCRV-infected samples and control uninfected samples. genes were considered differentially expressed with an FDR of 0.01 and a log2 fold change of >2. raw reads have been deposited into GenBank under accession no.
