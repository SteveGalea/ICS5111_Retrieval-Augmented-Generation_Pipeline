RNA was transferred and immobilized onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Intl., Little Chalfont, UK) the membrane was hybridized with a 1.2-kb HindIII/XbaI cDNA fragment from the 2,3 SAT (O) plasmid. the membrane was reprobed for 18S expression. the bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Intl.) the bands were eluted in 2% SDS and hydrolyzed in 2 N trifluoroacetic acid at 100\u00b0C for 3 h. cells were incubated with or without neuraminidase and analyzed by HPAEC for Arachis hypogaea peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin binding. cells were stained with 9E10 mAb after incubating the cells with 0.3% saponin for 20 min. immunofluorescence Staining Cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. the cells were then incubated with the 9E10 mAb to the myc epitope (10 g/ml) or TEX-1. binding was detected with FITC-conjugated goat anti\u2013mouse (diluted 1:40; Dako) or rhodamine the grids were embedded in 1.8% methyl cellulose/0.4% uranyl acetate. the grids were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before washing. each gold particle was calculated as a fraction of the distance across the golgi apparatus. the sum of gold particles of each size in each fraction was expressed as a percentage frequency of the total number of each size of gold. the cDNA encoding the human 2,3 sialyltransferase tagged with a 30-bp stretch of DNA encoding the 9E10 epitope of the myc protein was cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNAI neo) the cell line MTSV1-7 has many characteristics of normal mammary epithelial cells. it is nontumorigenic, forms organized colonies in collagen gels. a retrovirus expressing the 2,3 sialyltransferase was constructed. blot analysis of 2,3 sialyltransferase expression in a) 2,3 SAT (O) transfectants. blots were prepared and probed as described in Materials and Methods. difference in size of mRNA transcript in T47D and MTSV1-7 transfectants is due to the use of different vectors forintroducing the gene. expression of 2,3 sialyltransferase had no obvious effect on the morphology of the golgi apparatus. a western blot analysis of myc-tagged 2,3 SAT (O) expression in MT47D and MTSV1-7 3STMYC transfectants was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. the absolute values for 2,3 sialyltransferase activity in the MTSV1-7 and T47D series of cell lines are not directly comparable. the absolute values for 2,3 sialyltransferase activity in the MTSV1-7 and T47D series of cell lines are not directly comparable as the assays on the two series were performed. MTSV1-7, MTSV1-7 3STMYC, c) T47D, and d) T47D 3STMYC show well-stacked Golgi. most of the O-glycans added to MUC1 produced by MTSV1-7 cells have either the core-1 structure (Gal1,3 GalNAc) or sialylated core-1. peak 1 contains neutral oligosaccharides consisting mainly of Gal1-3 GalNAc-ol with a small amount of GalNAc-ol. peak 2 contains monosialylated Gal1-3 GalNAc-ol. the 2,3 SAT transfected T47D clones show an increase in the proportion of the monosialylated peak. peak 1 consists of neutral oligosaccharides, peak 2 corresponds to monosialylated species and peak 3 elutes with disialo oligosaccharides. peak at 9 min in b is free NeuAc released during the work up of the sample. the x-axis shows cell number and the y-axis shows log fluorescence intensity. the binding of PNA seen in the parental MTSV1-7 cell line and the puromycin transfectant was not evident in the MTSV1-7 transfectants. the sialyltransferase was also active in the MTSV1-7 transfectants. the 2,3 sialyltransferase gave a perinuclear staining, often located to one side of the nucleus, characteristic of golgi apparatus staining. the cells were double labeled using a polyclonal antibody to mannosidase II, a resident of the Golgi medial cisternae, and 9E10. this confirming localization to the Golgi apparatus of the recombinant MTSV1-7 3STMYC cells show double labeling of the same cells with an antibody against a resident Golgi marker, mannosidase II. overlapping distribution (yellow) to a compact, juxtanuclear reticulum. labeling of MTSV1-7 3STMYC 3.14 with polyclonal anti-GalT and monoclonal 9E10 antibodies followed by protein A coupled to 5-nm gold. antibody to the 1-4 galactosyltransferase (GalT) operative in N-linked glycosylation was used in double-labeling experiments. gold particles were counted over 18 Golgi, and the results are expressed as the mean percentage frequency. the difference in distribution between 2,3 SAT (O) and GalT is statistically significant. the number of each size of gold particles in the TGN was also estimated. cDNA encoding the human 2,3 sialyltransferase was cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNAI neo) at the COOH terminus of this type II transmembrane protein, the 9E10 epitope is far away from the membrane-spanning domain that has been shown to be involved in the localization of glycosyltransferases. a retrovirus expressing the 2,3 sialyltransferase was constructed. five stable cell lines were selected in the presence of puromycin. expression level varied with the clone, with the MTSV1-7 transfectants expressing more than the T47D clones. blot in b was exposed for 6 d to detect endogenous transcripts. western blotting with the 9E10 antibody showed a specific band in the region of 46\u201348 kD, which corresponds to the myc-tagged 2,3 SAT (O). expression of the protein was confirmed by FACS\u00ae analysis of permeabilized cells. 1-7 clones had increased activity ranging from 19\u201330fold. levels of activity of the enzyme correlated with levels of expression. overexpression of 2,3 sialyltransferase had no obvious effect on the morphology of the Golgi apparatus. the absolute values for 2,3 sialyltransferase activity in the MTSV1-7 and T47D series of cell lines are not directly comparable. both transfected and untransfected cell lines show well-stacked Golgi consisting of several cisternae. most of the O-glycans added to MUC1 produced by MTSV1-7 cells have either the core-1 structure (Gal1,3 GalNAc) or sialylated core-1. on the other hand, 64% of the O-glycans added to MUC1 produced by MTSV1-7 cells are disialylated core-2\u2013based structures. sialylated peak consists of neutral oligosaccharides. peak 2 corresponds to monosialylated species. peak 3 elutes with disialo oligosaccharides. cell lines were incubated with media only (thin continuous lines) or with PNA labeled with fluorescein in the presence (dotted lines) of neuraminidase. the binding of PNA seen in the parental MTSV1-7 cell line was not evident in the MTSV1-7 transfectants (Fig. 6, g and f) but it could again be induced by neuraminidase treatment. se was also active in the MTSV1-7 transfectants in increasing the level of sialylated core-1. radiolabeled MUC1 precipitates from the MTSV1-7 puro and MTSV1-7 3ST clones were analyzed for hexosamine content. tagged 2,3 SAT (O) of the MTSV1-7 3ST and T47D 3ST cell lines gave the expected pattern of staining. the 2,3 sialyltransferase gave a perinuclear staining, often located to one side of the nucleus, characteristic of Golgi apparatus staining. staining of unfixed cells showed no positive surface staining. sections of the transfected MTSV1-7 and T47D cells were labeled with the myc antibody followed by goat anti\u2013mouse coupled to gold particles. the gold labeling appeared to be localized over the golgi stack and was polarized to one side. operative in N-linked glycosylation was previously mapped to the trans cisternae and the TGN in HeLa cells by immunoelectron microscopy. the relative distribution of the two enzymes was then determined by counting each size of gold particle across the Golgi stacks. the distance between the beginning of the cis cisternae and the end of the trans compartment was divided into 10 equal fractions and converted to real distances (nm) the difference in distribution between 2,3 SAT (O) and GalT is statistically significant. the number of each size of gold particles in the TGN was also estimated. the distribution in the Golgi apparatus and TGN is shown in Table III. the 2,3 sialyltransferase gave a perinuclear staining, often located to one side of the nucleus, characteristic of Golgi apparatus staining. the cells were double labeled using a polyclonal antibody to mannosidase II, a resident of the Golgi medial cisternae, and 9E10. the gold labeling appeared to be localized over the Golgi stack. the stably expressed myc epitope\u2013tagged 2,3 sialyltransferase in the golgi apparatus of T47D cells. an antibody to the 1-4 galactosyltransferase (GalT) operative in N-linked glycosylation was used in double-labeling experiments. the relative distribution of the two enzymes was then determined by counting each size of gold particle across the Golgi stacks. the distance between the beginning of the cis cisternae and the end of the trans compartment was divided into 10 equal fractions. the difference in distribution between 2,3 SAT (O) and GalT is statistically significant. the difference in distribution between 2,3 SAT (O) and GalT is statistically significant. the number of each size of gold particles in the TGN was also estimated. the transfected enzyme contains the same sequence that determines the residency of the endogenous 2,3 sialyltransferase in the Golgi apparatus. this is particularly relevant to the study of breast cancer since the activity of the enzyme is elevated in breast cancer cell lines. increased expression of the 2,3 sialyltransferase in breast epithelial cell lines results in increased sialylation of the mRNA coding for the enzyme. a detailed structural analysis of the side chains is necessary to prove unequivocally that the decrease in GlcNAc content is due to a reduction in core-2 branching rather than a reduction in chain extension from galactose in core-1. the conclusion from the studies reported here is that the 2,3 SAT (O) is located in the medial and trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. the location of the sialyltransferase to within more than one compartment of the Golgi apparatus supports the view that the Golgi cisternae are characterized by their different mixtures of these enzymes, not by discrete types. there is a formal possibility that overexpression of a glycosyltransferase may alter the fine localization of the enzyme. the study of Roth et al. (1994) used an antibody to map the position of a GalNAc T to the cis-Golgi apparatus. the positioning of enzymes involved in mucin-type O-glycosylation has relied mainly on sucrose density gradient centrifugation. previous work by Locker and colleagues following the acquisition of oligosaccharides onto the M protein of Coronavirus suggested that 2,3 SAT (O) is in an earlier compartment than the change in glycosylation pattern seen in breast cancer also relates specifically to studies on the MUC1 mucin as a potential target antigen in active specific immunotherapy of breast cancer. both humoral and cellular responses to the mucin have been observed in breast cancer patients. CHO cells, widely used for the production of recombinant proteins, do not express the core-2 1,6 GlcNAc T (Li et al., 1996). it may then be relatively simple to produce the MUC1 antigen in these cells with minimal manipulation."}
