{"summary": "there is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with Pierre Robin sequence. one approach is a temporary tongue-lip adhesion (TLA) that acts as a temporizing measure while the mandible continues to grow and is usually taken down at 1 year of age. clinical signs to evaluate for upper airway obstruction in infants with PRS include stridor, labored breathing, diaphoresis, apnea, and restlessness. an objective evaluation of respiratory compromise can include pulse oximetry, carbon dioxide retention, and polysomnography. it is estimated that airway issues that accompany PRS are expected to improve or resolve as the mandible continues to grow by the age of one. however, this option has decreased in popularity due to its temporary effectiveness and the frequent need for nutritional support for >1 month. tolaryngology and the Sleep team at CHC demonstrated severe sleep apnea with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 31 and a nadir of 75%. after 17 days of distraction, the patient presented for removal of external distraction arms. left-sided consolidation was confirmed to be complete during removal of the distractor. left-sided consolidation was confirmed to be complete during removal. the patient tolerated takedown well and was discharged on POD #2. he maintained his airway throughout hospitalization without aggressive measures. four months later per dentistry the patient's mandibular alveolus was better aligned. the patient retained his TLA until 5.2 years of age. prolonged TLA resulted in a severely retroclined mandibular alveolus, embedded primary incisors in the floor of the mouth, and a steep dolichofacial mandibular growth pattern. mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a mandibular lengthening technique. it is frequently used in the treatment of micrognathia in infants. it can lead to an improvement in respiratory status within a few days. however, failure rate is estimated between 2% and 9%. writing \u2013 review and editing: Robyn Randall, Katherine Chin, Brooke French."}
