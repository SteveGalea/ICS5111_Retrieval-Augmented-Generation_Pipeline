{"summary": "endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a familial chronic tubulointerstitial disease with insidious onset and slow progression to terminal renal failure. the disease affects people living in the alluvial plains along the tributaries of the Danube River in Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Rumania. BEN is a multifactorial disease with genetic predisposition to environmental risk agents. previous studies have suggested genes located in chromosome band 3q25-3q26. incidence of rapid debrisoquine metabolizers is higher in BEN patients than in healthy controls. differentially methylated regions were determined in BEN patient and controls. the commonly presented DMRs were determined to be the most promising methylation alterations in BEN. in the present study we aimed to perform exome sequencing of 22 000 genes with the Illumina Nextera Exome Enrichment Kit. the 22 libraries were distributed in 10 enrichment reactions (pools) in 6 of them DNA from 3 libraries was mixed together, while the other 4 contained DNA from only one. the reactions were run in triplicate on an Illumina qPCR Eco system. we selected mutations based on the following criteria: (i) no data about variants; (ii) no incidence in healthy Bulgarian controls and in European populations; (iv) similar incidence in both Bulgarian and Serbian patients' groups; (iv) mutation frequency of more than 40% in BEN patients. pool 9 was sequenced using a 300-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 and a micro 4-tile flow cell. only pool 9 was sequenced using a miSeq Reagent Micro Kit v2 and a 500-cycle 14-tile flow cell. nonannotated variants with frequency of more than 40% in BEN patients. mutations occur in 77% of BEN patients. all selected variants occur with similar frequency in the Bulgarian and Serbian groups of BEN patients. KCNK5 variant c.1397A>C occurs only in combination with one or two of the other variants. CELA1 variant is present as a single aberration in 6 out of 10 positive cases. in 5 of BEN patients none of these variants were found. this is probably due to the presence of other rare mutations. next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows simultaneous and efficient analysis of all known genes for a given trait. we applied whole-genome and exome sequencing in 22 BEN patients. AA is a carcinogen that can cause nephrotoxicity as well. the role of CKD as a risk factor in the development of ESRD has been confirmed. angiogenic growth factors are involved in the development of the kidney. a number of angiogenic growth factors are involved in the development of the kidney. the second nominated gene encodes elastase-1, which degrades elastin in the vascular matrix. elastin causes deposition of hydroxyapatite-like mineral and osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells. elastin degradation products play a key role in vascular morphogenesis. defects in potassium channels cause abnormal vasodilation responses. an increased K+ channel activity may therefore reflect a very high metabolic state of vascular smooth muscle cells. molecular mechanisms leading to interstitial fibrosis and chronic kidney disease are complex and are probably related to the primary processes leading to renal injury. the main pathological characteristic of BEN kidney is interstitial fibrosis. interstitial sclerosis could result from overproduction of extracellular matrix by injured proximal tubular epithelium."}
