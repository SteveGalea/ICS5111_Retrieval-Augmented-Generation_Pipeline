{"summary": "human serum albumin (BSA, Fig 1a) is the most abundant plasma carrier protein in humans. it is responsible for transporting many endogenous and exogenous agents. the drug binding ability of HSA is directly related to the effectiveness of clinical therapy due to its strongly influences on the free drug concentrations in the plasma. fluorescence spectroscopy technology has been widely used to investigate the interactions of drug protein system [20\u201324] fluorescence spectrum of BSA is dominated by tryptophan residues (Trp-212 and Trp-134, Fig 1). Molecular docking is an important technique for computer-aided drug design. ibuprofen (Ibu) were obtained from the national institute for food and drug control (Beijing, China). HSYA, syringin (Syr) and danshensu (DSS) were purchased from Zhongxin Innova Laboratories (Tianjin, China) the test solutions were incubated at 310 K for 40 min and then transferred into 96-well black fluoro-microplates (CORNING, USA) the fluorescence spectroscopy tests were carried out at the same temperature to simulate the body temperature. materials Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained from Solarbio China. adenosine (Ade), cytidine (Cyt), uridine (Uri), phenylalanine (Phe), warfarin (War) and ibuprofen (Ibu) were used without further purification. the test solutions for fluorescence spectroscopy were prepared with different concentrations via stepwise dilution. the test solutions were incubated at 310 K for 40 min and then transferred into 96-well black fluoro-microplates. the excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 500 nm. each grid computation was performed with a grid box of 303030, with 1 spacing. the grid was centered at the middle of Sudlow's site I and Sudlow's site II. binding of the tested natural components would cause different changes in the fluorescence spectra of BSA due to the protein conformation transformation. the occurrence of an isoactinic point at 445 nm was considered as direct evidence of the existence of a static quenching process in the SaB-BSA binding system. the occurrence of an isoactinic point at 445 nm was considered as direct evidence of the existence of a static quenching process in the SaB-BSA binding system. the modified Stern-Volmer plots of the SaB-BSA system and HYSA-BSA system are shown in Fig 5. Modified Stern-Volmer plots of the SaB-BSA system and the HYSA-BSA system are shown in Fig 5. the fluorescence data were analyzed by the Lineweaver-Burk equation. 1 / F = 1 / F m a x + F m a x / K Q = 1 / F - F 0 + F - F 0 / K Q. the binding parameter Kq of SaB was calculated by the Stern-Volmer Eq (1). the fluorescence data of Syr were analyzed using Eq (4). the binding constant K was 2.7104 M-1 for the Syr-BSA system. the calculated fluorescence parameters of single tested component with BSA were 310 K and pH 7.2. warfarin is a globular heart-shaped non-glycoprotein, and has two ligand-binding sites located in the hydrophobic cavity. warfarin has been demonstrated to be the site marker of site I in HSA, while ibuprofen is a site II binder [2]. ibuprofen is still used as site markers for site I and site II of BSA. fluorescence studies of the SaB-BSA system coexisting with other components in DHI. first, BSA was mixed with the coexisting components in a 1:1 ratio. tests were prepared with fixed BSA and coexisting components at a concentration of 510-6 M.

Molecular docking studies AutoDock Vina-based molecular docking includes an entire surface search of the selected protein region. the aim of this study was to evaluate the binding affinities of these components in DHI on plasma protein and to determine the most optimum binding site. the binding site of SaB, HSYA, and Syr was within Sudlow's site I. it is evident that several amino acids with hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics were in contact with SaB in these complexes. binding of the tested natural components would cause different changes in the fluorescence spectra of BSA due to the protein conformation transformation. binding of the tested components would cause different changes in the fluorescence spectra of BSA due to the protein conformation transformation. the effect of these components on the BSA fluorescence spectra is shown in Fig 3. fluorescence emission intensity data for BSA at peak position were analysed by the followed equations ((Eq 1)\u2013(Eq 4)) the static quenching procedure can be divided into static quenching procedure and dynamic quenching procedure. the modified Stern-Volmer plot of the SaB-BSA system changed to an upward curvature, indicating a combined quenching process at a higher concentration ratio of CSaB/CBSA. the modified Stern-Volmer equation (Eq (2)) is another way to describe the quenching process[33, 39]. the binding parameter Kq of SaB was calculated by the Stern-Volmer Eq (1). the binding parameter Kq of SaB was 6.831012 M-1 s-1 and was much larger than that of HSYA. the binding constant K was 2.7104 M-1 for the Syr-BSA system. site marker competitive experiments were carried out to identify the binding site of SaB on BSA using molecules that were well known as specifical binding markers of BSA. warfarin has been demonstrated to be the site marker of site I in HSA, while ibuprofen is a site II binder [2]. the binding parameters of the SaB-BSA system with warfarin decreased almost 40% compared to those of without warfarin. the binding parameters of the SaB-BSA system with and without ibuprofen were comparable. test solutions containing different concentrations of SaB (from 0 M to 4010-6 M) were prepared with fixed BSA and coexisting components at a concentration of 510-6 M. in the presence of these natural components, there were still upward curvatures when the concentration was larger than 3010-6 M. 104 M-1) 6.29 8.12 8.93 7.57 7.10 7.71 K\u2019b (104 M-1) 3.89 10.7 61.6 6.61 5.25 7.08 K\u2019b/Kb 0.21 0.58 3.31 0.36 0.28 0.38 K\u2019b is the Kb of SaB-BSA system in the presence of coexisted components. SaB is released from serum albumin more quickly than when it is used alone. it may increase the concentrations of unbound SaB in plasma and improve the effects of SaB. two crystallographic structures of HSA co-crystallized with warfarin (entry code 1H9Z) [29] and with ibuprofen (entry code 2BXG) [30] were selected for docking studies. the conformation of the protein with site marker is a good starting model for further docking studies. in the SaB-BSA complexes, SaB was surrounded by Tyr-156, Tyr-340, Trp-213, Val-292, Val-342, Glu-291, Glu-293,Ala-260, Ala-290, Pro-338, Pro-446, Lys-187, Lys-294, Ser-286, Arg-191, Arg-194, Arg-198, Arg-217, Arg-256, and Asp-450 formed hydrogen bonds with SaB at 310 K. Syr could enhance the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA. binding constant (K) was 2.7104 at 310 K."}
