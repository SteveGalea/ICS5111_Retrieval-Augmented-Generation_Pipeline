{"summary": "HCoV-NL63, a member of the group I coronaviruses, was first detected in a child with bronchiolitis in the Netherlands in 2004 [1]. HCoV-HKU1, a group II virus, was detected in an adult with chronic pulmonary disease in the Netherlands in 2005 [2] it is now recognized that both these viruses have a worldwide circulation and are associated with human respiratory tract infections. cDNA was synthesized from 10 L of RNA eluate using random hexamer primers (TaKaRa Dalian, China) and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase. real-time RT-PCR assays targeting conserve regions of the N and 1ab genes of both viruses were developed and used in parallel. amplicons of the N and 1ab genes were cloned into pET-9a and pGEM-T Easy vectors. the lower limit of detection of each real-time RT PCR assay was 100 copies/20 L. 104 copies of N gene and 1ab gene transcripts were used as positive controls in each run. HCoV-NL63 replicase polyprotein 1ab gene and five sequences (951 nt) of the HCoV-HKU1 nucleoprotein (N) gene were derived from positive samples using conventional PCR and sequencing and subject to phylogenetic analysis. 382 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from hospitalised children with a diagnosis of pneumonitis or bronchopneumonia. the children had a median age of 1.1 years (range 1 month to 7.75 years) cDNA was synthesized from 10 L of RNA eluate using random hexamer primers. amplicons of the N and 1ab genes were cloned into vectors. amplicons of the N and 1ab genes were cloned into pET-9a (QIAGEN) and pGEM-T Easy (Promega Corporation, USA) vectors. 104 copies of N gene and 1ab gene transcripts were used as positive controls in each run. the amplification conditions were 48\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 15 sec. for each virus, when the CT value generated was less than 38, the specimen was considered positive. oV sequences AY597011.2, AY56787.2 and DQ415910.1 were used as references for the HCoV-NL63 analysis. AF304460 representing the sequence of HCoV-229E was also included. age, gender, and clinical details are listed for those positive for either virus. seasonal distributions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from may 2008 to the end of March 2010 were similar. peak incidences of both viruses occurred in the summer of 2009 but not in 2008. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 infections were coinfected with other respiratory viruses. only 13 of 57 (14.0%) HCoV-HKU1-positive patients and 8 of 32 (25%) HCoV-NL63-positive patients tested negative. influenza 4 0 (0.00) 1 (3.13) Adenovirus 0 (0.00) 3 (9.38) human metapneumovirus (hMPV) 7 (12.28) 5 (15.63) None* 13 (14.04) 8 (25.00) most patients infected with either HCoV-NL63 (65.6%) or HCoV-HKU1 (77.2%) were less than 1 year of age at the time of investigation. expectoration was a more frequent symptom in HCoV-HKU1-infected patients. seasonal distributions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from may 2008 to the end of March 2010 were similar. peak incidences of both viruses occurred in the summer of 2009 but not in 2008. heightened activity occurring at times when the number of samples collected from children with respiratory infections was declining. only 13 of 57 (14.0%) HCoV-HKU1-positive patients and 8 of 32 (25%) HCoV-NL63-positive patients tested negative for other respiratory viruses. hMPV 7 (12.28) 5 (15.63) none* 13 (14.04) 8 (25.00) the 15 strains of HCoV-NL63 were more widely distributed on the tree when the 1ab (replicase) sequence was analysed. BJET72 was not related to reference NL63 genes used in the analysis. the other 14 strains clustered into at least 3 distinct monophyletic groups. HCoV-NL63 infections peaked in the summer, fall, and winter months of 2009, but there was little activity at any time during 2008. in temperate climates, most HCoV-NL63 infections appear to occur in winter and early spring, including in canada and france. coinfection with HCoV and parainfluenza 3 viruses is common in both HCoV-HKU1- and HCoV-NL63-positive patients. this makes it difficult to clarify the role of coronaviruses in childhood pneumonia or bronchopneumonia."}
