{"summary": "TYLCV is a persistent, circulative virus, exclusively transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. however, this and other viruses transmitted by hemipteran insects are thought not to replicate in their insect vectors. covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA is central to viral infection and persistence. mutations in the viral capsid protein selectively impair the integrity of mature nucleocapsids. these results implicate viral uncoating as an important step regulating CCC DNA formation. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes hepatitis and neurological disease. MHV-induced BBB breakdown correlate with downregulation of tight junctions according to strain virulence."}
