{"summary": "a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is associated with specific Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) strains. the 89K pathogenicity island (PAI) was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. two large-scale outbreaks of severe SS2 epidemics occurred in china in 1998 and 2005, causing great economic losses in the swine industry. these two outbreaks also posed serious public health risks from the newly emerging streptococcal toxin shock syndrome (STSS), which claimed 52 lives. results from a recently published work suggest that the genome of SS2 would be highly polymorphic among different strains. we used the comparative genome re-sequencing approach developed by Roche NimbleGen Systems to investigate genomic diversity in a collection of 18 SS2 strains. this includes isolates from the two outbreaks in china, virulent strains from european countries, and several avirulent strains. 05ZYH33 (GenBank accession number NC_009442) is a highly virulent strain isolated from a Chinese STSS patient during the Sichuan outbreak in 2005. the complete genome sequence of 05ZYH33 (GenBank accession number NC_009442) is available and was used as the common reference strain for each CGS analysis. a total of 299,469 29-mer probes were synthesized according to the genome sequence of 05ZYH33. the NimbleGen algorithms assign each probe a '1'or '0' status based on the probe signal intensity ratio (reference/test) to reflect the sequence similarity of the corresponding region. a phylogenetic tree was then drawn based on the probe status of the entire probe set from the various SS2 strains. the 89K genomic island of strain 05ZYH33 was considered a candidate PAI of virulent SS2 strains responsible for the two STSS outbreaks in China. all eight virulent strains isolated from the two outbreaks contain the entire 89K fragment. the international virulent strains SS2-N, S735, S10, and 607, as well as one strain (1940) isolated in China before the 1998 outbreak, completely lack this element. kb amplicon was obtained with primer pair P1/P17. region II in strains 606 and 1941 is found at different locations with respective to the 89K locus in the genome of 05ZYH33. the outer circle shows the genome scale. the R13 plot (blue) shows the hybridization signal intensity for the reference strain. regions of low signal intensity of strains 05HAS68, ZF, and 1941 are highlighted with black rectangles. Figure 4. PCR confirmation of the 89 K polymorphisms in the SS2 strains. a 1.5-kb fragment in strain 8011 and a 4.5-kb band in T15 was obtained by PCR. a 1.5-kb PCR product was detected by primer pair P1/P17 in both strains. strains 05HAS68, ZF, and 1941 appear to possess gene homologs. virulent strain SS2-N lacks all four regions of differences. strains 607 and S735 lack RD1, RD3 and RD4. RD3 and RD4 contain mobile genetic elements, such as recombinase and integrase. the average GC content of the 05ZYH33 chromosome is 41.1% compared to the average. virulent strains 05HAS68, ZF, and T15 contain additional deletions. a total of 194 genes are absent or display significant sequence variation compared to the reference strain. 114 encode proteins involved in ABC-type transporters, phosphotransferase systems, transcription regulators, carbohydrate metabolism, co-factor biosynthesis, restriction-modification systems. NPs were found in the avirulent strains compared to the 05ZYH33 reference strain. the lack of detected SNPs in the avirulent strains can be ascribed to large genomic variations between these strains. the identified SNPs in the STSS-causing strains are significantly less abundant than those in the other virulent isolates. a phylogenetic tree was drawn based on the probe status of the entire probe set from the various SS2 strains. the virulent strains isolated from the two STSS outbreaks in china were grouped together, except the Netherlands 8011 strain. considerable genome variation exists among members of this group. 89K genomic island of strain 05ZYH33 is 89-kb in length and composed of 80 predicted genes (SSU05_09030982) in the genome of 05ZYH33. all eight virulent strains isolated from the two Chinese outbreaks contain the entire 89K fragment. the international virulent strains SS2-N, S735, S10, and 607, as well as one strain (1940) isolated in China before the 1998 outbreak, completely lack this the outer circle denotes locations of the 89 K PAI, including Region I (red), Region II (blue), Region III (yellow), Region IV (green), Region V (purple), and Region VI (orange). the third and fourth circles display predicted coding regions on the plus and minus strands, respectively. avirulent strain 8011 and avirulent strain T15 appeared to have a similar polymorphism pattern in the 89K island. both contain Region IV (SSU05_09360942 in strain 8011 and SSU05_09380942 in strain T15) and Region VI (SSU05_09610982) of the 89K element. a 1.5-kb fragment in strain 8011 and a 4.5-kb band in T15 (Figure 4E) strains 606 and 1941 also reside at different locations than the 89K island in 05ZYH33. a 1.5-kb PCR product was detected by primer pair P1/P17 in both strains. strains 05HAS68, ZF, and 1941 appear to possess gene homologs. virulent strain SS2-N lacks all four regions of differences, while strains 607 and S735 lack RD1, RD3 and RD4. RD4 is also absent in virulent strain 1940. virulent strain 05HAS68 and ZF lack RD3 and RD4. the average GC content of the 05ZYH33 chromosome is 41.1% compared to the virulent strains 05HAS68, ZF, and T15. a total of 194 genes are absent or display significant sequence variation compared to the reference strain. 194 genes, 80 encode hypothetical proteins, and the remaining 114 encode proteins that are involved in ABC-type transporters, phosphotransferase systems, transcription regulators, carbohydrate metabolism, co-factor biosynthesis, restriction-modification systems, and cellular surface structure. the virulence-related epf gene cluster [10,11], which encodes extracellular protein factor (EF; a putative virulence marker that widely exists in virulent strains, was absent in the lack of detected SNPs in the avirulent strains can be attributed to large genomic variations between these strains. the identified SNPs in the STSS-causing strains are significantly less abundant than those in the other virulent isolates. this result is consistent with the phylogenetic profiling described above, as well as the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these strains. SS2 strain BM407 contains two regions with extended similarity to 89K. region V encodes several ABC-type transporters (SSU05_09450949) and regulatory proteins, such as the SalK/R two-component system (SSU05_09450949) a number of genes, including several well-characterized virulence genes, are absent in the three avirulent isolates. this may account for the loss of virulence and provide new insight into the virulence mechanisms of SS2. lipase is important for bacteria to grow in carbohydrate-restricted conditions, where lipids are the sole carbon source. srtF cluster encodes nine proteins, including three sortases, three pilus subunits, and three ancillary proteins. the srtBCD cluster (SSU05_20962103) encodes nine proteins, including three sortases, three pilus subunits and three ancillary proteins. six putative transcriptional regulators and a response regulator (RevS; SSU05_2090) in signal transduction pathways were absent from the avirulent strains. 89/1591 represents a typical North American virulent strain that lacks three virulence protein markers. 89/1591 also lacks the candidate virulence genes that are described above. the genome of 89/1591 is significantly different from the sequenced genomes of Chinese strains 05ZYH33 and 98HAH12. it appears that strain 89/1591 has evolved differently and acquired distinct sets of genes that contribute to its virulence. a recent comparative genomic analysis indicates that gene gain is the major evolutionary force of streptococcal species, among which S. suis is the greatest lineage [37] virulent and virulent lineages acquired divergent genes to improve their ability to survive and evolve independently into the currently prevailing strains. the virulent and virulent lineages acquired divergent genes to improve their ability to survive and evolve independently into the currently prevailing strains. a whole-genome comparative analysis has provided new insight into the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 strains. the virulent strains were isolated from diseased patients or swine. the avirulent strains were identified as avirulent in a pig model. mapping microarrays were designed with NimbleGen algorithms that select a 29-mer oligonucleotide every seven bases on each strand of the reference genome sequence. all probes were synthesized in parallel on a two-array set using a digital light processor TM (Texas Instruments, Plano Texas) and photoprotected phosphoramidite chemistry in a random probe layout. s contain all possible alleles at a centrally located position. the perfect match probe will hybridize more strongly than the three corresponding mismatch probes for each strand. re-sequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each tested strain. cells were cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) medium. DNA (1 g) was mixed with 1 OD of 5'-fluorescent dye-labeled random nonamer (Cy3 for the SS2 strains analyzed and Cy5 for the 05ZYH33 reference strain) re-sequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each tested strain. Arrays were washed with NimbleGen wash buffer, spun dry in a high-speed microarray centrifuge. pixel intensities were extracted using a genepix\u00ae 4000B scanner. array data was deposited in the national center for biotechnology information gene expression Omnibus Database. each probe was assigned a binary profile (1 or 0) based on the probe signal intensity ratio (reference/test) to evaluate its presence/absence across different strains. gene profiles were then clustered, and the strains were grouped based on the similarity of gene profiles. a grant from the Open Fund of State Key Lab of Infections and Diagnostics in Zhejiang University Medical School (No. 491010*A60902) to BZ, and grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) to ML (No. 30901282) and JT (No. 30730081)."}
