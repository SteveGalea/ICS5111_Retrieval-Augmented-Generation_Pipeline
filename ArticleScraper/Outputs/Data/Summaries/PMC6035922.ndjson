{"summary": "the 2018 Asian Thoracic Cancer Care Summit was held in Hong Kong from April 13\u201314, 2018. AME was honored to conduct an interview with Professor Chung Ming Chu. ENB is an instrument to target small lung lesions, initially to biopsy them to understand what they are. it can be used to treat some of these small lesions, for example, by doing radiofrequency ablation or microwaves treatment, or it can help the surgeon by placing marker to assist the surgeon to locate the lesion for removal. the challenge is to train more bronchoscopists and have more hospitals to install similar systems so that more patients can be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible when the lesions are still small. if you want to introduce new technologies, you have to go through a very lengthy process of applications and approval because we\u2019re using taxpayers\u2019 money. right now, bronchoscopies in hongkong is training doctors to do it under conscious sedation and local anesthesia. the other challenge is the cost of procedure. the company manufacturing these technologies can lower the cost to benefit a lot more patients. interview with dr. chung Ming Chu: the potential and burden of ENB in Asia (1)."}
