{"summary": "CPMO1 and CPMO2 were designed to bind to the AUG region of ORF1 and ORF2 of CHIKV genomic RNA. both CPMO target sequences were structurally accessible with no complex secondary folding. the sequences were also predicted to be highly conserved among different geographical strains of CHIKV. fluorescence signals of CPMO1 and CPMO2 were detected in at least 84% of CHIKV-infected cells at day 1, 2 and 3 p.i. CPMO signals were only located in the cell cytosol and most of them colocalized with CHIKV E2 protein stain. this suggests that CPMO could be distributed to the Endoplasmic reticulum where it inhibits CHIKV protein expression. NCBI blast nucleotide alignment with representative geographical strains of CHIKV showed high similarity in CPMO target sequences except for a few mismatch base. bCPMO1 and CPMO2 sequence are 100% conserved in query coverage and identity to 56.1% and 62.1% of all published CHIKV strains in NCBI database. HeLa cells were treated with 0 M (mock-treated) or 6 M Endo-Porter delivery reagent as vehicle control. number of cells with intracellular PMO fluorescence signal, n, was indicated on each bar. CHIKV non-structural polyprotein or CPMO2 targeting the synthesis of structural polyprotein was carried out at M.O.I. 0.1. virus titre in the culture supernatant was quantitated by viral plaque assays. CPMO1 (10 M) significantly reduced CHIKV titre by 2 log10 PFU/ml at day 1 p.i. CPMO2 treatment seemed less effective in silencing production of E2 protein and infectious CHIKV titre relative to CPMO1. findings highlight strong antiviral efficacy of CPMO1 against CHIKV replication. treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 10 M did not produce specific inhibition against (f) Sindbis and (g) Dengue virus replication (M.O.I. 0.1 infection) when compared to the non-treated and scrambled CPMO1 controls. Error bars are indicative of mean s.e.m. expressed from three independent sets of experiments. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on day 3 post-infected cells. cells maintained healthy cellular morphology with intact organelles. cell surface membrane was smooth and there was no sign of CHIKV virions. CHIKV-induced cytopathic vacuoles, CPV II, are indicated by arrowheads and virus budding from cell surface membrane is indicated by *. representative images are shown here with corresponding scale bar in m. CPV II, cytopathic vacuole II; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; G, Golgi apparatus; L, lysosome; M, mitochondria; N, nucleus; NM, serum Lactate dehydragenase level in mice remained low and insignificant. CPMO1v or sCPMO1v administration via intraperitoneal injection remained low and insignificant compared to the LDH positive control. CPMO1v given at 15 g/g had the most notable reduction of viremia (2.83 log10; Fig. 5d), CHIKV load in the spleen (3.85 log10; Fig. 5e), liver (2.09 log10; Fig. 5f), brain (2.45 log10; Fig. 5g) and limbs (2.91 log10; Fig. 5h) treatment was given at two more equivalent doses at 18 h p.i. and 42 h p.i. mice were monitored daily for signs or symptom of CHIKV morbidity. at the end of two weeks p.i., the number of surviving mice was recorded. 1v-treated and CHIKV-infected mice showed degenerative changes in the form of diffused necrosis. this suggests inflammation has occurred in the skeletal muscle fibres due to CHIKV pathogenesis. muscle and liver tissues of 15 g/g CPMO1v-treated mice retained healthy integrity and were protected from CHIKV pathogenesis. immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed positive and intense CHIKV antigen staining in the limb muscle and liver of PBS-treated mice at day 7 p.i. viral antigenic staining appeared like granule structures in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. CPMO1v-treated mice were strongly protected with no CHIKV antigens in both muscle and liver tissues. 99% of CPMO1 and 97% of CPMO2-treated cells showed diffused fluorescence occurring individually or freely in clusters around the cytosol. fluorescence signals of CPMO1 and CPMO2 were similarly detected in at least 84% of CHIKV-infected cells at day 1, 2 and 3 p.i. CPMO1 binds to a sequence (25-mer) upstream of the first Open Reading Frame. CPMO2 targets a sequence (25-mer) in the second ORF. secondary structures of CPMO target region in the CHIKV genome are predicted by mfold program. bCPMO1 and CPMO2 sequence are 100% conserved in query coverage and identity to 56.1% and 62.1% of all published CHIKV strains in NCBI database. CPMO1 and CPMO2 of 10 M were tested for their cytotoxic effect after day 1, 2 and 3 treatment. cells with positive PMO-FITC signal expressed as percentage over total number of CHIKV-infected cells with E2-594 signal. n number of cells with 594 signal was quantitated and indicated on the top of each bar. pre-treatment with equal concentration of CPMO2 achieved only a 1 log10 PFU/ml reduction in CHIKV titre at day 2 and 3 p.i. in mock, EP or sCPMO-treated cells, increasing level of expression of CHIKV E2 and nsP3 protein were observed from day 1 to day 3 p.i. CPMO2 (10 M) exhibited a lower inhibition relative to the non-treated control. treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 10 M did not produce specific inhibition against (f) Sindbis and (g) Dengue virus replication (M.O.I. 0.1 infection) when compared to non-treated and scrambled CPMO1 controls. CPMO1 is highly specific against CHIKV with no cross-reactivity to the replication of other alphaviruses or flaviviruses. TEM was carried out on day 3 post-infected cells for ultrastructural observation of CHIKV replication. infected cells showed assembly and budding of mature CHIKV virions. mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum remained intact. CPMO1-treated cells showed no sign of CHIKV replication with absence of CPVs at say 3 p.i. mice succumbed to CHIKV infection with a range of 10\u201365% lethality in day 5\u20139 p.i. relative to mock-infected wildtype control group. there could be variability in survival due to the development of innate immunity that help mice to overcome lethality. this mouse model was used to analyze the acute phase of CHIKV infection. 5 g/g of CPMO1v protected 75% of the mice from CHIKV-induced morbidity. 65% survival at day 3 p.i. and 50% survival at day 4 p.i respectively. 5 g/g CPMO1v-treated mice showed retarded growth. mice were injected with sterile PBS, anti-CHIKV vivo-PMO (CPMO1v) or scrambled vivo-PMO (sCPMO1v) at 5 g/g, 10 g/g or 15 g/g consecutively for seven days at every 24 h interval. mice were sacrificed at 6 h after the last treatment and whole blood was harvested for quantification of LDH activity level. d limbs harvested and homogenized for viral plaque assays. significant reduction in viremia and CHIKV load were observed. histological analysis was performed on mice pre-treated with CPMO1v. all mice were sacrificed at day 7 p.i and their hind limbs and liver were harvested, fixed with formalin, ethanol-dehydrated and paraffin embedded in sections for (a\u2013h) H&E staining or (i\u2013p) IHC staining using primary rabbit anti-CHIKV E2 IgG followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit HRP IgG. CPMO1v was investigated for its inhibitory efficacy against CHIKV replication in human cells and in the murine model. previous study demonstrated the strong potential of antisense molecules in suppressing CHIKV replication in HeLa cells56. however, treatment-induced toxicity and the high susceptibility of siRNA to intracellular degradation posed as limitations in further development of shRNA for pre-clinical applications57,58. i.p treatment of CPMO1v showed significant reduction of CHIKV load in the liver, spleen, skeletal muscles and the brain. this suggests CPMO1v could have been favorably taken up into these organs. further investigation on CPMO1v biodistribution using bioanalytical tools63 can be carried out. CPMO1 targets upstream of the AUG codon in the first ORF. it blocks the translation of CHIKV genomic RNA to non-structural viral polyprotein. this hinders the translation of CHIKV subgenomic RNA to structural proteins, namely, the Capsid, E1 and E2. the control sCPMOs have neither caused non-specific reduction in CHIKV titre nor drastic decrease in E2 protein level. this signifies that for future studies requiring specific silencing of a stage of CHIKV replication, more CPMO candidates can be similarly designed and screened. a novel study demonstrating the strong prophylactic efficacy of morpholino oligomer in inhibiting CHIKV replication on cell-based and murine models. this is a novel study demonstrating the strong prophylactic efficacy of CPMO1v in inhibiting CHIKV replication.
