{"summary": "physicians maintained a registry of patients who sought treatment with fever or with history of fever with axillary temperature >38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), altered mental status, new onset of seizures, or a new neurologic deficit. the physicians collected whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid, a throat swab specimen, and urine samples from patients admitted during January\u2013March 2010 in 3 of the 6 active surveillance hospitals. samples were stored at 70\u00b0C. we shipped an aliquot of serum, cerebrospinal fluid, throat swab specimens, and urine from patients with probable and confirmed cases of NiV infection. we calculated the matched odds ratio (mOR) and considered any association statistically significant if the p value was 0.05. we analyzed data in STATA 10 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) confirmed case-patients within the preceding month to provide a blood specimen for serologic testing. the investigation team collected acute-phase and subsequent whole blood specimens from possible case-patients. samples were centrifuged in the local government community clinic, and the separated serum was stored in liquid nitrogen. the investigation team collected acute-phase and subsequent whole blood specimens from possible case-patients. samples were centrifuged in the local government community clinic. samples were transported to the IEDCR laboratory in liquid nitrogen. case-patients, except 1, were either too sick or too confused to respond. the field team selected multiple appropriate proxy respondents for interview. we used conditional logistic regression to estimate association between exposure and NiV infection. seven (88%) of 8 people who met the case definition for probable or confirmed NiV infection died. four cases constituted an initial peak, and a second-generation outbreak of 4 cases appeared after contact with the initial case-patients. 7 patients with sporadic cases of NiV infection, 6 of whom died, 5 had history of drinking raw date palm sap in the month preceding illness onset. one case-patient attended to a family member who was hospitalized at FMCH with an illness unrelated to encephalitis for 3 days, 4 days before the onset of illness. another case-patient was a physician in training at FMCH. in the adult medicine ward was 32 days, and the time from his contact with the 2 children with NiV infection to illness was 2\u20134 days. two NiV genomic sequences obtained from 2 of 14 meningoencephalitis patients that the physician had been in contact with did not match the NiV genomic sequence of the physician\u2019s isolates. case-patient A frequently visited case-patient A during his illness. case-patients E and F took him to the hospital. case-patients were supported by case-patient F, and distance between faces was 1 foot. case-patients had symptoms similar to those of case-patient A, and died on January 27 or January 28, 2010 after 4\u20138 days of illness. the mean age of the case-patients and controls was similar. cat 1 (6) 7 (13) 0.4 (0.1\u20133.9) 0.45 Fruit bat 0 0 Undefined Undefined Physical contact with sick animal Cow 0 4 (7) Undefined Undefined Goat 1 (7) 1 (2) 0.9 (0.4\u20132) 0.76 Chicken 0 9 (16) Undefined Undefined Duck 1 (7) 3 (5) 1.2 (0.1\u201315) 0.89 Had seen bats in or around residence at night 12 (80) 39 (70) 1.2 (0.1\u201315) 0.89 Drank raw D 328 meningoencephalitis cases-patients were reported by surveillance physicians in Faridpur. of these, 12 had IgM against NiV (12%), including 4 from the outbreak area. 68 persons gave a blood sample for NiV laboratory diagnosis. four cases constituted an initial peak, and a second-generation outbreak of 4 cases appeared after contact with the initial case-patients (Figure 2).
