{"summary": "the threat of new human influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics has increased over the past decade. the virus is an enveloped virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae. the virus is capable of rapid genetic variation and host species shift. influx of protons alters the core so that M1 and the vRNPs can dissociate. fusion still occurs but the core does not uncoat, nor dissociate from the cytosolic surface of the endosome. the results show that the drop in pH and the gradual change in overall ionic milieu in maturing endocytic vacuoles play central roles in virus infection. egg-grown, purified influenza A virus strain X31 (H3N2) was purchased from Virapur. X31 was subjected to two ultracentrifugation steps using 10 to 40% sucrose step gradients. viral bands were harvested, pooled, and diluted in formulation buffer (40% sucrose, 0.02% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2). anti-IAV M1 (goat) was obtained from ViroStat. mouse anti-UUKV nucleoprotein antibody 8B11A3 was a kind gift from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. section electron microscopy (EM), a549 cells were grown on coverslips. Virus was bound to precooled cells for 1 h on ice, directly fixed (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate at pH 7.2, 50 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM CaCl2) for 30 min. samples were sectioned into 50- to 60-nm thin slices. X31 fusion assay was labeled with R18 and a self-quenching concentration of SP-DiOC18. purified IAV was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. X31 diluted in PBS was labeled with R18 at a final concentration of 0.42 M for 1 h at RT. labeled virus was bound to EDTA-detached and precooled cells for 1 h on ice. cell pellet with bound virions was resuspended in 100 l PBS.

Virus was bound to precooled cells for 1 h on ice, washed extensively with cold PBS, and immediately fixed with 4% FA for 20 min at RT. cells were stained with WGA-AF594 (1:250) for 30 min at RT, incubated in blocking solution (1% BSA, 10% FCS in PBS) representative images were acquired by confocal microscopy using a 100 objective. for quantification, 16 (4 4) images of each well were acquired with an MD2 microscope using a 20 objective. the specific uncoating signal was quantified for 1,000 cells with ImageJ. the bottom layer contained 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 150 mM NaCl, and a general protease inhibitor. the same gradient setup was used, except the total salt concentration was kept at 135 mM. the mixture was centrifuged for 150 min at 21,000 rpm and 12\u00b0C. lysed for 20 min at RT with 0.1% NP-40 in MNT buffer for PK-based limited proteolysis (LiP) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in MNT buffer for trypsin-based LiP. peptides were incubated at RT for the times indicated below. cells were washed after EGF binding, shifted to 37\u00b0C, and loaded with 20 M membrane-impermeant version of the APG3 salt (diluted in ddH2O) for 30 min. to visualize APG3 fluorescence over time following internalization, cells were incubated with nocodazole (30 M in DMSO) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. X31 was pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in DMEM-based buffers adjusted to the indicated pH values. half of the samples were neutralized by addition of HEPES (1 M, pH 9.5) (white bars) both sets were subjected to the acid-bypass infection assay. X31 was pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in buffers adjusted to pH 7.4 or 5.8. supplemented with 120 mM indicated monovalent cations. the total ionic strength was kept constant. X31 was diluted in 1 ml MNT (20 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris) buffer. purified X31 was diluted in 1 ml MNT (20 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris) buffer. vRNPs were detected by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against IAV PB2. protein band intensities were normalized to those at pH 7.4 without NP-40. protein band intensities were normalized to those at pH 7.4 with 135 mM Na+ and NP-40. cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% GlutaMAX. viral bands were harvested, pooled, and diluted in formulation buffer. stocks of the WSN strains were prepared as previously described (7). anti-IAV M1 (goat) was obtained from ViroStat. mouse anti-UUKV nucleoprotein antibody 8B11A3 was a kind gift from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Stockholm. samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in 2% OsO4, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with 0.5% uranyl acetate. dehydration, embedding, and thin sectioning were performed as previously described. purified IAV was labeled with R18 and a self-quenching concentration of SP-DiOC18. X31 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was labeled with R18 and a self-quenching concentration of SP-DiOC18. labeled virus was bound to EDTA-detached and precooled cells for 1 h on ice. the cell pellet with bound virions was resuspended in 100 l PBS. fusion was initiated by lowering the pH to the desired values. cells were incubated in permeabilization buffer (0.1% saponin, 1% BSA, 10% FCS in PBS) for 20 min at RT, followed by indirect immunofluorescence using mouse monoclonal anti-IAV NP (HB-65, 1:100) as a primary antibody and anti-mouse antibody labeled with AF488. fusion medium (DMEM, 50 mM citric buffer) adjusted to pH 5.0 (IAV, UUKV, VSV) and pH 5.2 (SFV) acid-bypass control samples were incubated for 2 min at 37\u00b0C with warm stop medium. cells were immediately shifted back on ice, washed twice with cold infection medium, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in stop medium. a small volume of purified IAV was added to a larger volume of pH buffer. the volume needed to reach pH 7.4 was determined by titration for every fresh pH or cation buffer used on the same day as the experiment. Virus was bound to precooled cells for 1 h on ice, washed extensively with cold PBS, and immediately fixed with 4% FA for 20 min at RT. cells were stained with WGA-AF594 (1:250) for 30 min at RT, incubated in blocking solution for 30 min at RT. representative images were acquired by confocal microscopy using a 100 objective. for quantification, 16 (4 4) images of each well were acquired with an MD2 microscope using a 20 objective. the specific uncoating signal was quantified for 1,000 cells with ImageJ. glycerol layers were aspirated, and the pellet was dissolved in 40 l sample buffer (NuPAGE LDS) the gels were fixed in 50% methanol\u201310% acetic acid and stained with colloidal Coomassie. the gels were scanned and quantified by using Quantity One software. the protein concentration of the lysates was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit. LiP was performed by adding PK to the protein extract at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 and incubating the mixture for 5 min at RT. the reaction was stopped by addition of reducing sample buffer containing 2 mM PMSF. cells were washed after EGF binding, shifted to 37\u00b0C, and loaded with 20 M membrane-impermeant version of the APG3 salt. to visualize APG3 fluorescence over time following internalization, cells were incubated with nocodazole (30 M in DMSO) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C together with APG3. both sets of samples were subjected to the acid-bypass infection assay. X31 was pretreated for 1 h in DMEM-based buffers adjusted to the respective pH values at 37\u00b0C, neutralized, and added to A549 cells. cell borders were visualized by staining with WGA. X31 was pretreated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C under the indicated conditions, neutralized, and bound to A549 cells for 1 h on ice. cells were fixed, washed, and left unpermeabilized. fusion was induced as described for the acid-bypass infection assay. X31 was diluted in 1 ml MNT (20 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris) buffer. purified X31 was diluted in 1 ml MNT (20 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris) buffer. vRNPs were detected by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against IAV PB2. protein band intensities were normalized to those at pH 7.4 without NP-40. acid-induced fusion of IAV at the PM of A549 cells failed to support efficient infection. a technique that allows controlled penetration of viruses into the cytosol directly through the plasma membrane (PM) without the involvement of the endocytic pathway. d virus to cells on ice, samples were shifted to 37\u00b0C. fusion was initiated by lowering the pH to the indicated value. fluorescence dequenching of R18 was normalized to 0.1% Triton X-100. X31 strain of IAV (H3N2) and A549 cells were exposed to pH 5.0 for 60 to 90 s at 37\u00b0C before fixation. electron-dense patches were commonly observed to be associated with the cytosolic surface of the PM. acid-bypass fusion of X31 led to a 75% decrease in infectivity compared to that by normal infection. we used a lower amount of virus (MOI, 5) following pH 5.0-induced fusion. the fraction of infected cells was determined after 14 h. d IAV was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in DMEM-based buffers. the pH was adjusted to values in the range of 7.5 to 5.0, followed by acid-bypass infection. the level of infectivity of IAV preincubated equaled (or even exceeded) the level observed after normal endocytic entry. at pH 6.4, the maximum level was reached after 90 min. the slow conversion explained why priming did not occur during less than 2 min of acidification needed to trigger fusion during acid bypass. we found that acid-bypass infection by another strain of virus was also elevated when the virus was primed in vitro. cells were incubated for 5 min (M1) and 30 min (NP) after fusion. strong M1 staining could be detected throughout the cytoplasm. NP was present as spots in the cytoplasm largely free of M1. measure for viral uncoating was determined by measurement of total fluorescence per cell. Virus was pretreated and fused at the PM of A549 cells. after 5 min incubation in CHX-containing stop medium, cells were fixed and stained. cells were fixed for 5 min (M1) and 30 min (NP) after acid bypass and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence. samples were analyzed as described in the legend to panel A. Bars, 20 m. unprimed CCCP-loaded virus did not infect cells more efficiently. but incorporation of the protonophore caused a dramatic increase (20-fold) infectivity of unprimed X31 after acid bypass. this was twice the level obtained by normal entry of untreated IAV. this was about 60% higher than the infectivity obtained after bypass with primed IAV. preincubation in a pH 5.8 buffer with a high concentration of K+ (120 mM K+, 10 mM Na+) enhanced IAV infection to a level 2.5-fold over the level observed with DMEM-based buffer (Fig. 4A). this rise in infection was linear with increasing K+ concentration up to 120 mM. valinomycin-treated viruses exposed to a high K+ concentration during priming were twice as infectious as control viruses primed in the absence of the ionophore. the flow of K+ through the viral membrane improved priming over and beyond the function of M2 as a cation carrier. at a low K+ concentration, the increase in infection was negligible. CP-containing viruses doubled the level of infectivity. this confirmed that both H+ and K+ are needed for efficient priming. the result also showed that the M2 channel as such is not required for priming. the conductance for the two cations is artificially supported by ionophores. the gradient contains a nonionic detergent (NP-40) to remove the viral membrane by solubilization as the virus sediments toward the bottom. exposure to a pH below 6.0 causes the dissociation of M1 (26). we adapted this method to X31 and WSN viruses. the presence of KCl increased the potency of core disassembly. it was tested using mixtures of NaCl and KCl. it was found that 50 mM KCl was sufficient to cause 80% dissociation. solubilized in vitro-primed and unprimed X31 viruses were digested with PK at neutral pH and RT. a ratio of the abundance of quantified peptides was obtained by comparing acid-primed viruses to unprimed viruses. X31 was pretreated at 37\u00b0C, neutralized, and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Tx-100; 20 min at RT) the tryptic peptide intensities of primed and unprimed samples were compared. differences in susceptibility to PK cleavage are reflected by the fold changes of quantified LiP peptides from M1, NP, and HA. all three peptides were mapped to areas inside or flanking the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains. the increase in PK susceptibility of M1 and NP upon priming most likely result from irreversible changes in conformation or protein-protein/protein-RNA interactions. increased green fluorescence was found in vesicular structures in the perinuclear cytoplasm. the dye colocalized with fluorescently labeled EGF 60 to 70 min after internalization. at this time point, EGF is typically found in LEs in A549 cells (55). we measured the vesicular APG3 mean fluorescence intensity over time. intensities increased up to 30 min following APG3 uptake. cells were treated with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole. X31 was bound to cells on ice, washed, and incubated for 60 to 90 s. fusion was initiated by lowering the pH to the indicated value. fluorescence dequenching of R18 was measured over time. in vitro HA acidification was assessed using a conformation-specific antibody (A1) targeting only the acidic form of HA (blue line, open circles) fusion capacity was determined by applying a FACS-based fusion assay (blue line, closed circles) Kinetics of pretreatment prior to acid-bypass infection. fusion leads to dilution of the dye, and fluorescence dequenching can be used to monitor virus fusion (52\u201354) at the optimal pH of 5.0, we measured a dequenching efficiency of 60 to 70% compared to the maximum value induced by detergent addition. the half-time of fusion was 20 s. a bunyavirus, acid-bypass infection was higher than that after normal endocytic entry. exposure to pH 6.5 to 5.4 elevates acid-bypass infection efficiency. one possible reason for the low acid-bypass infectivity was that the virus core had not been exposed to the mildly acidic milieu that leads to priming. fusion assay measured the dequenching of R18-DiOC18-labeled X31 upon acid-induced fusion. the pH threshold observed in both assays was in accord with the values determined for the H3 subtype (62). in vitro priming experiments were restricted to pHs of 5.8 and higher. exposure of virus particles to a mildly acidic pH in vitro elevated their infectivity after acid bypass. starting at pH 6.5, the effect became more prominent with decreasing pH until the threshold pH of HA activation was reached. the associated changes occurred slowly and were, in part, irreversible. fusion was induced as described for the acid-bypass infection assay. cells were incubated for 5 min (M1) and 30 min (NP) after fusion in the presence of CHX-containing stop medium. cells were fixed and stained for M1 and NP, respectively. IAV was either left untreated (condition 1) or pretreated with amantadine (condition 2) or CCCP (condition 3) for 5 min at RT. CCCP was further present during the 2-min fusion step but excluded from subsequent incubation in stop medium. we used a recombinant, amantadine-sensitive H1N1 strain called WSN(AS) to test the effect of the protonophore CCCP. this proton translocator enables H+ to cross lipid bilayers along their electrochemical gradient. the infectivity was twice the level obtained by normal entry of untreated IAV and about 60% higher than the infectivity obtained after bypass with primed IAV. the highest elevation in infectivity after bypass (17-fold) was reached when CCCP was employed in the absence of amantadine. if M2 was blocked, the increase in infectivity dropped to 10-fold. this suggested that M2's role in the process extended beyond proton transport. valinomycin-treated viruses exposed to a high K+ concentration during priming were twice as infectious as control viruses primed in the absence of the ionophore. valinomycin-treated viruses exposed to a high K+ concentration during priming were twice as infectious as control viruses primed in the absence of the ionophore. amantadine alone, there was no infectivity after priming. addition of valinomycin to the amantadine-inhibited viruses did not increase infectivity. this indicated that the flux of K+ alone without an influx of protons does not induce priming. CCCP, valinomycin, or a combination of both did not increase the normal level of IAV infection. our data indicated that not only the pH but also the K+ concentration affected the priming of IAV. when combined with a low pH, it doubled the efficiency of core uncoating. at pH 5.5, most of the M1 and NP dissociated from the sedimenting cores. a clear difference compared to NaCl emerged when the gradient pH was lowered to 5.8. at mildly acidic pH, KCl dissociated the cores more efficiently. in vitro acid-primed and unprimed X31 viruses were digested with trypsin at neutral pH and RT. complete degradation of M1 was more rapid when virions were preacidified, as detected by Western blot analysis. the reaction was stopped by addition of reducing SDS sample buffer containing 2 mM PMSF. samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and lysed with 0.1% NP-40 (20 min at RT) the tryptic peptide intensities of primed and unprimed samples were compared. peptides were mapped to areas inside or flanking the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains. PK was preacidified in the presence of low (5 mM) and high (120 mM) K+ concentrations. the linker region was even more susceptible to proteolysis. no changes were detected for NP and HA. the K+ concentration increases along the endocytic pathway. the dye has previously been applied to monitor cytoplasmic K+ concentrations. cells were incubated in the presence of nocodazole together with APG3 for 30 min. cells were exchanged to fresh nocodazole-containing medium for imaging time. vesicular APG3 mean fluorescence intensity increased over time. priming is initiated when the incoming virus encounters a pH of 6.5 (or lower) in early endosomes (EEs) or early macropinosomes. optimal priming in vitro resulted in a dramatically elevated efficiency of core uncoating, vRNP import into the nucleus, and infectivity. ance measurements of M2 reconstituted in liposomes have shown a transport rate of 10 protons/s/channel at pH 6.0 (79) it was recently shown that efficient acidification of the lumen of M2-containing liposomes is possible only due to M2-mediated efflux of K+ (or Na+) through the M2 channel (38) exposure of IAV to pH 5.8 in a low-K+-concentration buffer resulted in irreversible changes at the C terminus of M1. this was in agreement with previous data indicating that while the N-terminal part of M1 does not change after acidification, a peptide corresponding to a sequence linking the N- and C-terminal domains undergoes a conformational change in vitro. changes in the proteolytic accessibility of NP upon priming could be due to either the release of M1 from the vRNPs or rearrangements within the vRNP bundle. the incoming IAV is exposed to a 10-fold or higher concentration of lumenal K+ and a corresponding drop in the Na+ concentration. a low pH and a high K+ concentration revealed additional changes in the C-terminal part of M1. these changes were not observed in NP, which might be due to the low sequence coverage (40%) in MS measurement achieved. this setup was difficult to distinguish whether the remaining M1 was lost from compact bundles of vRNPs. IAV is probably not the only virus that requires core priming in endosomes. the dissociation of VSV core proteins occurs in a similar, low-pH-dependent manner (91). vaccinia virus (VACV) infectivity was enhanced upon pretreatment of the virus at low pH. incoming viruses may respond not only to low pH but also to other ions present in the lumen of endocytic vacuoles. cellular K+ channels have been listed among the hits in small interfering RNA screens of cell proteins that support IAV infection."}
