{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 originated from evolutionarily divergent primate lentiviruses. their natural hosts are chimpanzees (SIVcpz) and sooty mangabey monkeys (SIVsmm), respectively (17, 24, 60) native HIV-1 Env trimer uses several nonredundant strategies of immune evasion to avoid antibody recognition and neutralization. this results in neutralizing-antibody titers in plasma against autologous virus strains that can be quite high but generally show limited breadth and potency against heterologous primary HIV-1 strains. human neutralizing MAbs specific for HIV-1 have proven to be invaluable reagents for probing the structure, antigenicity, and neutralization susceptibility of HIV-1. this surprising observation could inform our understanding of the relevance of different SIV- and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-macaque infections. the isolation and characterization of 14 new MAbs from 9 patients with chronic HIV-2 infection using EBV transformation of human B cells or direct molecular cloning of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes from memory B cells. we used competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and differential neutralization patterns to categorize the 15 MAbs in groups with generally nonoverlapping reactivities. the memory B cells were enriched from purified human B cells by positive selection using anti-CD27 microbeads. the cells were seeded at 100 cells per well in 96-well U-bottom microplates. after 2 weeks, the supernatant fluid was collected from each well and screened for HIV-2 gp120 glycoprotein binding.

MAbs were tested for binding at 5 g/ml in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1% (vol chimeric clones p7/SNAG-HIV-21871/5-5 and p7/SNAG-HIV-21871/5-5 were made by inserting the V4 or V5 sequence of HIV-21871/5-10 into the proviral clone p7/SNAG-HIV-21871/5-5. a gp160 ectodomain gene fragment containing the desired substitution was first generated by recombinant PCR. the PCR products were digested and ligated into the p7/SNAG vector using restriction enzymes SnaB1 and AgeI (31). the 293T cell-grown virus stocks were first titrated on TZM-bl reporter cells (8129; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) as previously described (11). the medium in the wells was replaced with 100 l virus-plasma mixture. after 48 h of incubation, the cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was measured. the luciferase activity was defined as the luciferase activities in medium-only and virus-only wells. IC50 titers were 0.007 g/ml, 0.003 g/ml, and 0.028 g/ml respectively. three cross-competition binding patterns distinguish HIV-2 MAbs. the 15 MAbs were tested against one another in competitive binding ELISAs. s (6.10B and 1.4H) also showed similar but not identical patterns of neutralization that distinguished them from the other MAbs. the potencies of the 7 MAbs in neutralizing different subsets of the 14-virus test panel were notable. 12A P 0.007 0.141 0.007 0.003 0.002 0.094 0.782 HIV-21871/5-5 P 0.012 0.947 >1 >1 >1 >1 >1 >1 0.183 0.038 HIV-21871/5-10 P 0.003 0.046 0.008 0.010 0.006 0.053 0.042 HIV-21871/5-14 P 0.008 0.220 0.032 0.019 0.023 >1 >1 HIV-21871/5-9 6.10F exhibited the greatest potency and breadth of neutralization (mean IC50, 0.009 g/ml) of the 15 HIV-2 MAbs tested, 6.10F exhibited the greatest potency and breadth of neutralization (mean IC50, 0.009 g/ml) the residue T318 was required for linear and cyclic peptide binding. but the residues L319, G322, L323, and F325A mutants lost infectivity. alanine scanning the V3 region of HIV-27312A exhibited 6.10F sensitivity reduced by more than 5-fold. 1.4B cross-competed with 6.10F and CG-II MAbs for HIV-2 gp120 binding. it showed a neutralization pattern similar but not identical to that of 6.10F. 1.4B reacted strongly with a cyclic V3 peptide, 319-CLMSGLVFHSQPINKRC-333. CG-II neutralizing MAbs are potent and broadly reactive against diverse primary HIV-2 strains, as well as multiple strains of SIVsmm/SIVmac. previous work suggested that the epitope of 1.7A may be restricted to the carboxy half of gp120 and may involve V4 (10), but a precise definition of the epitope and its location was not possible. substitutions between the two variants specifically affected the 1.7A epitope. previous studies indicated that the 1.7A binding site was in the carboxy half of gp120. we constructed chimeric env gp160 genes in which the V4 and V5 regions of HIV-21871/5-5 were replaced with corresponding regions of HIV-21871/5-10. 1.7A neutralization against HIV-21871/5-5, HIV-21871/5-10, and HIV-27312A. cleavage site of V8 protease (10, 27) is indicated by the arrow. residues (N409 and P411) contributing to the site mutagenesis and alanine scanning on HIV-27312A are also indicated. 1.7A, alanine scanning followed by neutralization sensitivity testing was performed on the V3-C3-V4-C4 regions of the HIV-27312A Env glycoprotein. four mutants (W406A, Q415A, H416A, and N417A) showed greater than 100-fold reduction in neutralization sensitivity. a Y418F mutant revealed 10-fold-lower sensitivity than the parental strain, HIV-27312A. three CG-II MAbs, 9.1A, 18.9G, and 20.3D, showed dependence on all four residues. the mutant R333A reduced neutralization sensitivity to MAb 18.9G by more than 100-fold. the mutant G322 reduced neutralization sensitivity to MAb 17.9C by 13-fold. the CG-III MAbs (6.10B, 1.1F, 1.4H, and 19.11F) showed a distinct pattern of cross-competition binding and neutralization compared with other neutralizing MAbs that were tested. we also screened the HIV-27312A Env V3 mutants (G322A, L323A, N331A, and R333A) that were resistant to neutralization mediated by 6.10F and/or 1.4B. sCD4-induced gp120 binding of 19.11F and 1.4H. no enhancement in binding of 6.10B and 1.1F to the gp120 glycoprotein occurred in the presence of sCD4. all 15 MAbs bound monomeric HIV-2 gp120 glycoprotein based on ELISA. none of the 15 MAbs bound HIV-1SF162 gp120 with or without preincubation with sCD4. two antibodies exhibited binding patterns that overlapped CG-I and CG-II (1.4B) or CG-I and CG-III (19.11F) CG-I MAbs (1.7A, 5.9D, and 7.4H) showed virtually identical neutralization profiles that distinguished them from the other MAbs. cross-competition pattern of HIV-2 MAbs aB.6.10F, biotin-labeled MAb 6.10F. b++, competition (>70% inhibition). c+, competition (50% to 69% inhibition). d0, no or insignificant competition (30% inhibition). CG-I MAbs 6.10F and 1.4B MAbs recognize overlapping linear epitopes in the V3 loop. of the 15 HIV-2 MAbs tested, 6.10F exhibited the greatest potency and breadth of neutralization (mean IC50, 0.009 g/ml) two synthetic peptide libraries containing 643 15-mer peptides were designed to cover the entire ectodomain of the HIV-27312A Env glycoprotein. they were used to test for 6.10F binding, suggesting that the epitope corresponds to the linear sequence 318-(T)LMSGLVF-325. the reactivity of each peptide in the linear (A and C) or cyclic (B and D) peptide library against 6.10F and 1.4B is represented in bar graphs. the sequences of peptides with significant binding are shown. the most important region is highlighted in red. 1.7A is the prototype of a large group of CG-II neutralizing MAbs. they are potent and broadly reactive against diverse primary HIV-2 strains. previous work suggested that the epitope of 1.7A may be restricted to the carboxy half of gp120 and may involve V4. no specific binding was observed, suggesting that 1.7A, 5.9D, and 7.4H recognize a conformational epitope. two closely related HIV-2 Env clones, HIV-21871/5-5 and HIV-21871/5-10, showed distinct sensitivities to 1.7A neutralization. both retained sensitivity to 1.7A, suggesting that the ENKP peptide is not a direct binding epitope of 1.7A. we also asked if the additional N-linked glycosylation site (NGS) in HIV-21871/5-5 V4 shielded the 1.7A epitope by generating a NGS mutant, HIV-21871/5-5 N409A. alanine scanning followed by neutralization sensitivity testing was performed on the V3-C3-V4-C4 regions of the HIV-27312A Env glycoprotein. four mutants (W406A, Q415A, H416A, and N417A) showed greater than 100-fold reduction in neutralization sensitivity. a Y418F mutant revealed 10-fold-lower sensitivity than the parental strain, HIV-27312A. mutants in the V3 base (R333A), the V4 region (W402) and the N terminus of the C4 region (I423 and Q425) also affected 5.9D and 7.4H neutralization. 1.4B neutralization was not affected by the critical 1.7A-related mutations W340A, W406A, Q415A, H416A, N417A, Y418F, and Y418W. to MAb 18.9G by more than 100-fold and to MAb 10.3G by 9-fold. the mutant G322 reduced neutralization sensitivity to MAb 17.9C by 13-fold. residues W340 and R333 in the N terminus of C3 were important to some, but not all, CG-II MAbs. we tested 6.10B, 1.1F, 1.4H, and 19.11F for the ability to block sCD4 binding to HIV-2ST gp120 glycoprotein by ELISA. 6.10B and 1.1F efficiently blocked sCD4 binding by >90%, whereas 19.11F and 1.4H showed little or no effect. wells with HIV-2ST gp120 immobilized in 2.6C-coated plates were preincubated with 10 g/ml HIV-2 MAbs or buffer, washed, and then incubated with sCD4. similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments. all 15 MAbs potently neutralized the group A primary HIV-2 strains. 10 out of 15 MAbs potently neutralized the group B primary HIV-2 strain HIV-2UC1 (median IC50, 0.028 g/ml) PINKR-333 in the HIV-27312A V3 loop by pepscan analysis. these mapping results likely explain the neutralization resistance to these MAbs observed in some HIV-2 strains. substitutions L323W in HIV-2MVP11971-16 and V324K in HIV-2MVP151321-3 lie within the epitope of 6.10F. two HIV-1 MAbs, 447-52D and F425 B4e8, recognize a similar region on the HIV-1 V3 loop (1, 11, 63) the V3 loops in HIV-1 and HIV-2 Env are both highly immunogenic in vivo. primary HIV-2 Envs lack such masking both in the context of the native HIV-2 Env trimer. two previous studies showed early viral escape mutants involving the C terminus of V4 and the N terminus of C3. the immunodominance and antigenicity of HIV-2 V4 contrast with HIV-1, where V4 has not been found to be a common target of NAbs. we asked if the extent of antibody somatic hypermutation or the length of CDRH3 might be responsible. gene family analysis of HIV-2 MAbsa MAb CG Heavy chain IGHV IGHD IGHJ CDRH3 length VH mutation frequency (%) 6.10F I 4-59*01 IR1*01R 6*03 19 14 3-11*01d 4*01d 5 14.77 5.9D II 1-69*09 3-03*01 1*01 17 19 1-33*01d 4*01d 9 12.88 7.4H II 1-69*09 3-03*01 1*01 17 19 a gene family analysis was performed on nucleotide sequences using IMGT Joinsolver database (76) b Gene family analysis of the VRC series was reported previously (77); gene family analysis of the PGT series (PGT121 to -123, -125 to -128, -130, -131, -135 to -137, and -141 to -145) was reported previously using Kabat definition (69); the CDRH3 lengths were adjusted to the IM antibodies by quaternary steric hindrance, hypervariability of peptide sequences that are surface exposed, and conformational masking. how HIV-2 persists in vivo in the face of these potent and broadly reactive NAbs is unknown. the possibility of cell-to-cell virus transmission has been suggested. findings suggest that the HIV-2 Env glycoprotein may exist in a conformational state more akin to those of laboratory-adapted strains of HIV-1 that lack the full benefits of conformational masking. a reduction in glycosylation in HIV-2 could result in a more open \u201cglycan shield\u201d surrounding V4, thereby allowing better antibody access and neutralization. clones derived from it with IC50 titers range from 0.001 to 1.0 g/ml. such analyses can be an important adjunct to vaccine protection studies."}
