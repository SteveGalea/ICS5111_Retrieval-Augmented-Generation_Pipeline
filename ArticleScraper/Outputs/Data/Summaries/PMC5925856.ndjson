{"summary": "acute exacerbation (AE) is the most severe complication of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. there are no currently proven beneficial management strategies for patients with idiopathic and triggered AE-IPF [5]. signs revealed a temperature of 37.0 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and O2 saturation of 93% on room air. he was initially diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and was admitted for antimicrobial therapy. no significant bacteria were detected in sputum smear and culture test. a chest CT scan showed new bilateral widespread consolidation and ground-glass opacity superimposed on a background honeycomb pattern. he was diagnosed with AE-IPF triggered by Aspergillus empyema. a case of AE-IPF triggered by Aspergillus empyema has been described. the new 2016 definition and diagnostic criteria for AE-IPF include any acute, clinically significant respiratory deterioration characterized by evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormality. pulmonary aspergillosis is a major complication of interstitial pneumonia. there is no established standard therapy for Aspergillus empyema [17] despite the high mortality rate, there is no established standard therapy for aspergillus empyema. retrospective study for AE-IPF showed 3-month survival was significantly better in patients treated with pirfenidone than in a control group [25] further research and discussion are needed to determine whether immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroid should be performed in AE-IPF."}
