{"summary": "bacterial expression of viral protein 6 (VP6) of porcine rotavirus (PRV) and generation of rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the VP6 protein. a discrimination ELISA was established to distinguish PRV from a panel of other porcine viruses. VP1 was partially accessible to iodination in single-shelled particles. the accession degree of VP1 to the immune system may affect the reaction of anti-PRV to VP1 protein. VP3 is a minor structural protein that may comigrate with VP4 in many gel systems. the cloned VP6 gene was 1356 bp containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding 397 amino acids. the sequence was submitted to GenBank and was allocated a GenBank accession number (JN977137). RNA-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of PRV DN30209 (lane 1). Lane 2 is negative sample. phylogenetic tree constructed based on these PRV VP6 amino acid sequences. analysis of VP6 expression and immunoreactivities of its antibody. eukaryotically expressed VP6 was further analyzed by IFA. the antibody reacted with VP6-expressing cells; in contrast, no green signal was detected in mock-transfected cells. the antibody was generated by inoculating rabbit with VP6 expressed from E.coli. Western blot of VP6 protein is judged as positive and shown as a curve. bacterial protein (negative control) and VP6-bearing bacterial protein were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. their blot results are shown in lanes 2 and 3 respectively. discrimination ELISA was established using the anti-VP6 antibody. several control viruses were included in the ELISA to determine the specificity of the ELISA. results showed that the anti-VP6 antibody had significant reactivity with PRV. the cloned VP6 gene was 1356 bp containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding 397 amino acids. the sequence has been submitted to GenBank and was allocated a GenBank accession number (JN977137). RNA-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of PRV DN30209 (lane 1). Lane 2 is negative sample. Figure 3. VP6 amino acide-based phylogenetic tree. analysis of VP6 expression and immunoreactivities of its antibody. anti-VP6 antibody was generated by inoculating rabbit with VP6 expressed from E.coli. however, this antibody reacted with VP6 protein transiently expressed on cells. this confirms that bacterially expressed VP6 can be used as a good immunogen. western blot of VP6 protein shown in lanes 2 and 3 respectively. pVAX-VP6 antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody were incubated. discrimination ELISA was established using the anti-VP6 antibody. the result showed that the anti-VP6 antibody had significant reactivity with PRV. there was no positive P/N value among other controls. the viral total RNA was extracted with a commercial kit. the reverse transcription mixture included 5 L of RNA (1 g), 1 L of primer VP6-2 (10 pmol), 4 L of 5RT-PCR buffer (TaKaRa, China),0.5 L of RNase inhibitor, 1 L of dNTP (10 mM/each), 1 L of each primer (10 pmol), 4 L of dNTP (2.5 mM/each), 0.25 L of each primer (10 RNA of the PRV was extracted by mixing the virus suspension in PBS or PBS (negative control) with an equal volume of an extraction buffer (0.02 M Tris\u2013HCl pH7.4, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 5 M EDTA, 4% sucrose and 0.04% bromophenol blue) the resulting supernatant was subjected to RNA-PAGE to detect and analyze the genome of rotavirus avirus C WD534tc USA Human rotavirus C Moduganari Nigeria Human rotavirus B WH-1 China Rotavirus C stain Wu82 China Procine rotavirus A OSU USA Human rotavirus A Gottfried USA The grouping, name and origin of the PRV isolates used in this study are provided. isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce protein expression. the expressing protein designated as Pro-VP6 was subjected to gel-purification, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and renaturation by dialysis according to our previously reported protocols. eniamine dihydrochloride substrate (100 L/well) was added and incubated for 15 min. dilution of antiserum to Pro-VP6 or control serum was 1:24, 1:25, 1:26, 1:27, 1:28, 1:29, 1:210, 1:211 or 1:212. the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. immunoreactivity of the anti-VP6 antibody to other control viruses was established. p0.05 and p0.01 were defined as statistically significant and statistically very significant respectively. amplification of VP6 gene of PRV was recently isolated in a pig farm in Heilongjiang province, northeastern China. the PCR product was purified and subjected to DNA sequencing. RNA-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) RNA of the PRV was extracted by mixing the virus suspension in PBS or PBS (negative control) the resulting supernatant was subjected to RNA-PAGE to detect and analyze the genome of rotavirus. procine rotavirus A CRW-8 Australia Procine rotavirus A RU172 India Procine rotavirus A 4F China Procine rotavirus A DN30209 China Rotavirus B stain Bang373 Bangladesh Human rotavirus B219 Bangladesh Procine rotavirus C Cowden USA Human rotavirus C Moduganari Nigeria Human rotavirus B WH-1 China Rotavirus C stain Wu82 China Procine rotavirus A O pET30a-VP6 was transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) Rosetta. the transformed E.coli was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. the same bacteria transformed with empty vector was used as control. the wells were incubated with serially diluted polyclonal antibodies at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the plates were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase (1:5000 dilution in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, after three washes with PBST. the cells were fixed with 4% PFA (polyformaldehyde) in PBS at room temperature for 20 min and quenched with 0.1 M glycine in PBS. after three washes with PBST, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.
