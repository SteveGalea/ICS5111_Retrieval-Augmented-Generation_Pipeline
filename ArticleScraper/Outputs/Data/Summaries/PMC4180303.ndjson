{"summary": "the relationship between viruses and host cells has been much studied in the Netherlands. in the 1960s, the focus was on the biology of bacteriophages as well as on viruses from higher eukaryotes. in the 1960s, the focus was on the biology of bacteriophages as well as on viruses from higher eukaryotes. in the 1980s, a similar approach was taken by Berns at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. in this environment, the Dutch entered the gene therapy arena. Valerio was a pioneer in this field and has been among the first to clone the adenosine-deaminase gene and its cDNA. retroviral vectors were used for transfer of the ADA gene into hematopoietic stem cells. these studies offered hope for a cure for ADA-SCID patients. this application of gene therapy has been a trailblazer ever since. adenovirus has been the prime oncolytic virus in Dutch preclinical research on viral anticancer agents. adenovirus has been the prime oncolytic virus in Dutch research on viral anticancer agents. Dutch oncolytic adenovirus research focused on increasing lytic replication in cancer cells and spread in solid tumors. p53 tumor suppressor protein promoted adenovirus-induced cell death resulting in more effective tumor eradication. the oncolytic adenovirus RNAi can also be used to modulate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. there is a high medical need to treat advanced cancers. virus delivery methods are being sought that allow systemic administration to reach tumor metastases. mutant adenoviruses obtained by bioselection showed improved systemic antitumor efficacy (Kuhn et al., 2008) or increased blood persistence and enhanced antitumor efficacy (Gros et al., 2008). such bioselections will further be facilitated by the use of error-prone adenovirus DNA polymerase mutants for generating the genetic diversity. adenovirus infection was found to compromise the homing capacity of adipose stem cells in mice bearing orthotopic human glioma xenografts. it is not known whether the cargo virus should be replication competent in the MSC or that the MSC merely hand off the virus particles to which they were exposed. only two replicating oncolytic viruses have reached the stage of clinical evaluation in the Netherlands. adenovirus Ad5-Delta24RGD is evaluated for treatment of glioblastoma. coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is normally unable to infect human cells. inclusion in MHV genome of an expression cassette encoding the fusion protein allowed infection of EGFR-expressing tumor cells. administration of this virus in mice bearing lethal intracranial EGFR-expressing gliomas could prolong the survival of the treated mice compared with mock-infected or control virus-infected mice. reoviruses can recruit an alternative high-affinity receptor to infect neurons in the murine central nervous system. reoviruses can enter via a route that is distinct from the route used in monolayer cultures of the same cells. this could be attributed to the action of extracellular factors as incubation of wild-type reoviruses with conditioned medium from spheroid cultures converted the viruses to particles that are infectious. in oncolytic virus therapy, the immune system is both a foe and a friend. it may frustrate efficient infection, replication, and spread of the therapeutic viruses. terminology for this form of cancer treatment is shifting from oncolytic virus therapy to viro-immunotherapy. studies into the antitumor immune stimulatory role of adenoviruses have lagged behind other oncolytic viruses because of the species specificity of human adenovirus. studies into the antitumor immune stimulatory role of adenoviruses have lagged behind other oncolytic viruses because of the species specificity of human adenovirus. adenovirus therapy has been shown to induce an immune response against the tumor cells in which it resides. this was demonstrated to occur upon administration of adenovirus vectors in a syngeneic rat model for colorectal liver cancer. another approach in which an adenovirus is employed as an effective vaccine vehicle is the CD40-mediated DC-targeted vaccine. reovirus treatment was also shown to decrease the frequency of immune-suppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells. similar data have been obtained with various other oncolytic viruses, including measles virus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), parvovirus. antigen-presenting cells take up TAAs released by the tumor cells. this cytokine-driven proinflammatory response compromises the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by enhancing the expression of MHC as well as co-stimulatory molecules involved in antigen presentation. adenovirus-mediated cell killing has been reported to be apoptosis independent. also indirect cell killing, by targeting of the tumor vasculature, contributes to immunogenicity of the tumor. es encoding proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been extensively studied in preclinical and clinical studies. also, the insertion of T-cell costimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB ligand, CD80, and CD40 ligand has been evaluated. treatment with a GM-CSF-armed oncolytic herpes virus resulted in clinically stable disease in 3/26 treated patient in a phase I study. the actual therapeutic benefit needs to be confirmed in larger clinical trials. combination of virotherapy and immunotherapy provides for effective virus-induced oncolysis and release of antigens. the costimulatory agent effectively enhances antitumor immune responses. oncolytic viruses have been combined with CTLA-4 blockade in various preclinical models. intertumoral variability in response to any given anticancer therapy reflects underlying (epi)genetic heterogeneity within tumor type. virus modulate and exploit host cell machinery to produce viral progeny and induce cell death. mutations and alterations in the underlying pathways may influence the efficiency of this process. enhancing T-cell activation strategies should ultimately delineate tumor profiles predicting the optimal oncolytic virus and optimal immune-stimulating strategy for a particular tumor. authors acknowledge the ZonMw Translational Gene Therapeutic Program, the technical science Foundation (STW), the Dutch
