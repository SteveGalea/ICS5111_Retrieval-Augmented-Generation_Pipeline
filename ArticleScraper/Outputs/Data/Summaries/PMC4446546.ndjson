{"summary": "the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) resulted from ARI remains to be a common and serious illness. a large number of viral and bacterial organisms are responsible for CAP. a large number of viral and bacterial organisms are responsible for CAP. the resequencing microarray, depending on hybridization between probes attached to the array, offered detailed microbial characterization and broad-range pathogen detection. the target sequence generated by the hybridization between closely overlapping probe sets and complementary fragments was compared with a sequence database. this technology has been applied for high-resolution multiplexed diagnostics for clinical syndromes with similar symptoms. participants for radiologically verified CAP were enrolled from Beijing Pneumonia Surveillance. the data on all hospital admissions, other important medical events, culture results of mycoplasma and viral infections were collected. complete nucleic acid of microorganisms and human cells from NPAs was extracted and purified using the masterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification kit. purified DNA and RNA were frozen at 80\u00b0C in 15 l aliquots for the following PCR. the amplification reactions were carried out in a Px2 Thermo Cycler (Thermo Electron Corp, Vantaa, Finland) with the same reaction conditions as previously described (Shen et al., 2013). RPM-IVDC1 processing The products from five multiplex PCR assays were pooled together and subjected to purification (Qiagen, Germany), processing, and hybridization in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 ( these targets included S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae. qRT-PCRs targeted other regions of the same gene or other genes different from RPM-IVDC1 targets. a positive and negative control in each set PCR assay was included.

RPM-IVDC1 processing The products from five multiplex PCR assays were pooled together and subjected to purification (Qiagen, Germany), processing, and hybridization in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640. hybridization was performed at 49\u00b0C for 12 h, which was much shorter than the time previously reported resequencing microarray adopted. qRT-PCRs targeted other regions of the same gene or other genes different from RPM-IVDC1 targets. a positive and negative control in each set PCR assay was included. all the qRT-PCR methods were reported previously.

Table 6. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for the RPM-IVDC1. the positive results for M. pneumoniae were found in age group of 5 to 14 years (26.3%, 5/19) and of 15 to 24 years (15.0%, 3/20). the detection rate of M. pneumoniae among the male (14.6%) was obviously higher than the female patients (4.8%). a viral etiology was found in 53 patients (48%), 12 of whom had more than one viral species identified. a viral etiology was found in 53 patients (48%), 12 of whom had more than one viral species identified. the results of confirmatory qRT-PCR failed to identify 4 specimens that were positive for M. pneumoniae by qRT-PCR. nine of 10 Staphylococcus spp. mecA positive samples were confirmed by qRT-PCR and one was false positive. the results were confirmed by mycoplasma culture. the sensitivities, specificities, and PPVs were shown in Table 6. the number of specimens positive for K. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis was too small to allow for a realistic evaluation of sensitivities. the resequencing assay showed excellent specificities for these organisms, ranging from 97.9 to 100%. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were detected in 68.2 and 22.7% of this age group, compared with 25 (22/88) and 8.0% (7/88) of the other groups. the positive results for M. pneumoniae were found in age group of 5 to 14 years (26.3%, 5/19) and of 15 to 24 years (15.0%, 3/20) the previously reported RPM-IVDC1 assay offered a sensitive, accurate, and specific identification for multiple respiratory tract viruses infection. however, the ability of this assay to diagnose bacterial infection was not validated. however, the ability of this assay to diagnose bacterial infection was not validated. some uncommon types of Haemophilus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Neisseria spp. were identified. the targeted sequence of adenylate cyclase (adk) gene could be used to identify H. influenzae by the sequence alignment. the targeted sequence of outer membrane protein (skp) gene could be used to detect Haemophilus spp. at species-level. the wide coverage of respiratory pathogens by RPM-IVDC1 assay enabled it an ideal tool for real-world diagnostics and surveillance. the detection of these atypical bacteria (e.g., M. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae) might be of great predictive value for diagnosing the etiologic agent. a total of two samples were identified as Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. the advantage of sequence alignment avoided resulting in false-positive for S. pneumoniae. the classical mecA gene was not restricted to S. aureus but was commonly found in other Staphylococci such as, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. pseudintermedius. eight of 14 samples positive for M. pneumoniae were found in the age group of two to 14 years. nine of 14 positive results were found among male patients. the phenomenon may be attributed to the limited sample size. the interpretation of testing results may be complicated due to the commensal colonization of the upper respiratory tract and the difficulty of obtaining a high-quality specimen. the quantitative assay might be necessary to accurately identify patients with true pneumococcal disease because most commensal microflora appeared to be present at low titers.
