{"summary": "the GenSkew algorithm [1] calculates ratio values of the six nucleotide combinations (C vs G, G vs A, U vs G, U vs A, C vs A, and U vs C) in predefined windows and steps along a sequence. the skew plots can be interpreted as \u201cnucleotide compositional signatures\u201d of the viral genomes. nucleotide sequences of the single-stranded RNA genomes of coronavirus, picornavirus, and HIV (reference strains and unclassified species) were downloaded from the ViralZone database. nucleotide sequences of the single-stranded RNA genomes of coronavirus, picornavirus, and HIV (reference strains and unclassified species) were surprisingly similar but not identical. negative skew value, the same but positive skew value is true for these nucleotides in the reverse order (N2 versus N1) algorithms converting skew data into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix are provided as Additional File S1. multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral, flaviviral, picornaviral, and HIV genomes was obtained by means of MAFFT [11]. skew values at the ultimate 3\u2032 end of the genome represent a reliable measure of the pairwise nucleotide compositional bias of the rubella virus genome. the same is true for G vs A (216.24) and U vs C (213.37), and the skew endpoint values for C vs G and U vs A are 56.39 and 2.31, respectively. the skew lines (N1 N2)/(N1 + N2) are shown of the rubella virus genome sequence (Figure 1(a)) and the same sequence after 10 consecutive cycles of nucleotide randomization (Figure 1(b)). overlapping windows are plotted on the X-axis against the corresponding skew values cumulatively on the Y-axis. the neighbor-joining tree shows a consistent clustering of the HIV-1 subtypes (red), the coronaviruses (black) and the flaviviral species (blue) the picornaviruses (green) are significantly less resolved. a bipartition can be observed in the cluster tree based on Euclidean skew distances. the lower group with the human 229E, NL63, and OC43 coronaviruses displays U vs C skew values increasing from 140 to 201. the unclassified bat-Rousettus isolate is found near the Vespertilio coronavirus. tree of coronavirus genomes based on nucleotide skew values (a) or nucleotide substitution (b) can be discerned in the skew-based tree. upper clade with U vs C proportions decreasing from 120 to 31. lower clade with U vs C proportions decreasing from 201 to 140. tree of flavivirus genomes based on nucleotide skew values (a) or nucleotide substitution (b) reps of the flaviviruses are colored red (dengue virus and pestivirus), green (flavivirus), blue (tick-borne flavivirus), light-blue (insect-specific flavivirus) and magenta (pegivirus) tree of picornavirus genomes based on nucleotide skew values (a) or nucleotide substitution (b) trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering. scale bars are in skew units or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. mean skew values of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 subtype RNA genomes. HIV-1 subtype RNAs display much lower StDEV of skew values compared with those of other viruses. nucleotide profiles are shown of the nucleotide sequence before Figure 1(a) and after 10 consecutive cycles of randomization Figure 1(b) the profiles are nearly identical because skew profiles are determined solely by nucleotide composition. nucleotides C and G win over A (steep positive slope) and the U-nucleotide loses from C and G (steep negative slope) by approximately the same proportion. skew values at the ultimate 3\u2032 end of the genome (position 489) represent a reliable measure of the pairwise nucleotide compositional bias of the rubella virus genome. overlapping windows are plotted on the X-axis against the corresponding skew values cumulatively on the Y-axis. the algorithm outlined above can be applied to sets of sequences provided that one carefully preserves the order of nucleotide comparisons as well as the normalization of window and step sizes to gain 500 cumulative skew values. cleotide [14] and the Flaviviridae display enhanced purine proportions in the first codon positions. the genomes of picornavirus species do not display such a prominent compositional feature. the skew algorithm is able to discern viral families by giving credit to unique compositional features typical of a virus family. a bipartition can be observed in the cluster tree based on Euclidean skew distances. upper group containing the human 229E, NL63, and OC43 coronaviruses displays U vs C skew values increasing from 140 to 201. the two unclassified isolates are italicized. the trees were constructed by neighbor-joining clustering. the scale bars are in skew units. reps of flaviviruses are colored red (dengue virus and pestivirus), green (flavivirus), blue (tick-borne flavivirus), light-blue (insect-specific flavivirus), yellow (hepacivirus), and magenta (pegivirus). the five unclassified flavivirus genomes are italicized. the scale bars are in skew units (Figure 5(a)) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. the reference sequences of HIV-1 subtypes show much less compositional divergence than corona-, flavi-, and picornaviruses. 86.34 124.36 StDev 46.67 33.47 21.40 24.00 43.15 45.22 Flavivirus AVG 43.38 38.95 44.53 5.01 3.66 1.19 StDev 29.92 53.33 32.36 59.98 71.05 25.50 Picornavirus AVG 9.48 32.05 37.12 2.81 24.10 26.49 StDeV 62.05 45.85 40.06 39.51 95.34 unclassified HIV-1 subtypes were not found in the ViralZone database. a bipartition can be observed in the cluster tree based on Euclidean skew distances. upper group containing the human 229E, NL63, and OC43 coronaviruses displays U vs C skew values increasing from 120 to 31. tree, upper clade with U vs C proportions decreasing from 120 to 31. lower clade with U vs C proportions decreasing from 201 to 140. trees were constructed by neighbor-joining clustering (NJ) and by maximum likelihood phylogeny (ML) the five unclassified flavivirus genomes are italicized. the trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering. the scale bars are in skew units or estimate the number of nucleotide substitution. the scale bars are in skew units (Figure 5(a)) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. the reference sequences of HIV-1 subtypes show much less compositional divergence than corona-, flavi-, and picornaviruses. the nucleotide skew profiles are nearly identical to the average skew value with small standard deviation. 124.36 StDev 46.67 33.47 21.40 24.00 43.15 45.22 Flavivirus AVG 43.38 38.95 44.53 5.01 3.66 1.19 StDev 29.92 53.33 32.36 59.98 71.05 25.50 Picornavirus AVG 9.48 32.05 37.12 2.81 24.10 26.49 StDeV 62.05 45.85 40.06 39.51 95.34 81.95 HIV unclassified HIV-1 subtypes were not found in the ViralZone database. the topology based on Euclidean skew distances is surprisingly similar (but not identical) to the topology based on regular evolutionary analysis (coronavirus, flavivirus, and picornavirus) this is remarkable because branch nodes in evolutionary trees predict equal skew values of both sequences. each node in this consensus tree is decorated with the frequency number (%) that reflects the level of bootstrap support. resampling of sites in a sequence prior to skew analysis does not affect the skew data vector.
