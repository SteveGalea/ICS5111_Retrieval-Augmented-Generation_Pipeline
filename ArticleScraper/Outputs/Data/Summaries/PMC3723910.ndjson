{"summary": "systems biology brings advanced bioinformatics and computational tools to bear on important health problems. these predictive tools are important because global profiling methods are becoming routine approaches for examining entire systems. network analysis has proven useful for analyzing protein-protein, protein-DNA, and kinase-substrate interactions, as well as for genetic interactions among genes. bottlenecks appear to bridge distinct regions of a network. it remains unclear which of these topological features is the most effective predictor of regulatory function for any given network construction approach or biological context. we have generated large-scale time courses of transcriptome and proteome data derived from influenza virus and SARS-CoV infected human bronchial epithelial cells. our datasets include high and low pathogenicity strains of both influenza and SARS-CoV viruses. performance of the resulting models was tested in either an in vivo mouse model (influenza virus) or an ex vivo human primary lung epithelial model (SARS-CoV) genes with conserved regulation in the new system were prioritized as conserved regulators for the respective virus infection. compendia of all data for each virus type were formed and used for all subsequent analysis. for influenza data, we applied the fold change filter to time points at or before 12 hours. this filtering scheme resulted in 13789 DE genes in influenza virus-infected cells. network edges were compared to predicted transcription factor \u2013 target database. results show number of genes that exhibited statistically significant overlap between their network neighbors and perturbed genes from the siRNA targeting study. vertices in the top 200 genes of the integrated network showed only minor shifts in betweenness ranking. vertices in the top 200 genes of the SARS-CoV betweenness ranking showed large jumps in ranking positions. six of these genes have been previously shown to be associated with SARS/virus infection.

Xpred rankings are shown in Table S3 (SARS-CoV) and Table S4 (influenza virus) to determine if these genes showed enrichment in functional categories, we used GO term enrichment analysis on genes with the highest Xpred scores in each of the two virus datasets. this intersection represents genes from each virus dataset that are both behaviorally conserved across different systems.

CREB5 was ranked #1 in the combined SARS-CoV ranking (out of 7186), while ATF3 was ranked #8. the overlap between the influenza virus and SARS-CoV conserved regulators appears to highlight the importance of the inflammatory response in both viruses. the role of TNF and TNFAIP3 in inflammation is well known. infections For influenza virus, Calu3 infections and sample preparation for transcriptomics of VN1203 and NL602 are described in detail in [17]. clonal population of Calu3 cells was sorted for high levels of expression of the SARS-CoV cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [48]. wild type infectious clone derived SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV), icSARS-CoV ORF6 and Bat-SRBD were derived from the baric laboratory\u2019s infectious clone constructs. genome fragments were amplified in E. coli, ligated, and purified prior to in vitro transcription reactions to synthesize full length genomic RNA. cultures were washed with 1XPBS and 200uL of mock, icSARS-CoV, icSARS-CoV ORF6 or Bat-SRBD inoculum (MOI 2) added to the apical surface. cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours, the inoculum removed and unbound viruses removed by washing three times with 1X PBS. quantitative LC-MS datasets were processed using the PRISM Data Analysis system [55], which is a series of software tools developed in-house. the peak intensity values (i.e. abundances) for the final peptide identifications were processed in a series of steps using MatLab\u00ae R2010b. network inference compendia were used as input to the Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) software [3] using assessment of mutual information to generate a matrix representing the pairwise relationships between all genes. we generated influenza networks using multiple cutoffs, calculated betweenness for all vertices in each network, and several functional gene lists. expressed genes compare to a control condition for each knocked-down condition. a p-value representing the statistical significance of the overlap between the differentially expressed genes identified based on the knocked down profiles was calculated using the right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test. for influenza, we used the VN1203 data as HP, and the Ca04 and NL602 strains as LP. with this approach, the DE behavior of each gene is collapsed into a single value for all temporal stages of the infection process. we only included these time points in the DE ranking to avoid incorporation of secondary regulatory effects in our analysis. the \u201cGSEA preranked\u201d setting in the GSEA software was used to determine enrichment of gene sets at the top and bottom of a preranked list of genes [30]. either the custom set of 7 influenza-related gene sets, or the set of msigdb gene set names with a match to the words \u201cviral\u201d or \u201cvirus\u201d was used as the reference gene set collection. the FDR corrected enrichment significance values were converted to 1* log10, and these values were averaged over all gene sets the top 500 ranked genes from the betweenness/degree/DE combined ranking were chosen as additional influenza virus regulators. for regulatory targets, merged proteome/transcriptome network from both viruses were used to derive adjacency matrices. raw proteomics data can be accessed at the PNNL Biological MS Data and Software Distribution Center in the Browse Available Data folder. raw proteomics data corresponding to peptide identifications used to populate the AMT tag database are available at the PRoteomics IDEntification database. tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from previously de-identified airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery under University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. infections For influenza virus, Calu3 infections and sample preparation for transcriptomics of VN1203 and NL602 are described in detail in [17]. human airway epithelium cultures were generated by provision of an air-liquid interface for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized cultures. wild type infectious clone derived SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV), icSARS-CoV ORF6 and Bat-SRBD were derived from the baric laboratory\u2019s infectious clone constructs. media was collected to determine viral titers at each time point for each well. cells were either washed in 1XPBS, harvested in TRIzol (Invitrogen) or washed 3 times in cold 150 mM bicarbonate buffer, lysed for 15 minutes in 8M urea and stored at 80C (protein) sample type by LC-MS/MS analysis [51], [54] of each SCX fraction and LC-MS analyses were performed on each individual unfractionated sample to generate quantitative data using identical chromatographic and electrospray conditions as for LC-MS/MS analyses. data were collected over the mass range 400\u20132,000 m/z. compendia were assembled for transcriptome and proteome datasets. the missing values of a given experimental condition were filled in with the average value for the replicates present for that condition. proteins for which one or more conditions showed more than half missing values were discarded. p-values were calculated from z-scores derived from the size of database overlap. a p-value representing the statistical significance of the overlap between the differentially expressed genes identified based on the knocked down profiles was calculated using the right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test. the absolute value of the difference at each significant time point was summed for each gene yielding a DE score. for influenza, we used the VN1203 data as HP, and the Ca04 and NL602 strains as LP. a large number of genes show a response to influenza virus infection in the first 12 hours. converted proteome edge entries were simply added to transcriptome edge entries. all vertices in the networks were then assessed for betweenness and degree centrality. each ranked list of genes was resampled with replacement. inferelator-based Modeling The Inferelator software was used to infer critical regulatory influences in our datasets. the top 500 ranked genes from the betweenness/degree/DE combined ranking were chosen as additional SARS-CoV regulators. the top 500 ranked genes from the betweenness/degree/DE combined ranking were chosen as additional influenza virus regulators. models from Calu3 and the regulator expression levels from the non-Calu3 data were used to improve the comparability of the mouse dataset. only days 1 and 2 post-infection were used in the comparison, despite data from days 4 and 7 being also present. raw quantitative proteomics data can be accessed at the PNNL Biological MS Data and Software Distribution Center. all data sets and associated metadata have been submitted to Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR, http://www.viprbrc.org).
