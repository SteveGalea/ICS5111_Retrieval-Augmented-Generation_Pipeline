{"summary": "the ectodomain of FIPV-UU4 S protein was fused with a trimerization domain of T4 fibritin followed by a V5 tag and a His6 tag at the C terminus to replace the transmembrane helix. the expected molecular mass of the homotrimeric recombinant protein is 465 kDa. all previously reported cryo-EM structures of coV S proteins have adopted compact ellipsoidal shapes of which the host receptor-recognizing S1 subunits pack against the spring-loaded coiled-coil S2 subunits. local resolution analysis indicated that the propeller-like regions of the EM map were less defined compared with that of the core regions. accumulated dose, e/2 48 30 Particles 102,586 191,810 Map resolution, 3.3 3.7 Map-sharpening B factor, 2 90 143 3DFSC (sphericity) 0.66 Model composition Nonhydrogen atoms 32,115 Protein residues 3,735 Ligands 219 B factor, Protein 170.75 Ligand 150.62 Model validation MolProbity score 2.12 EMRinger score 2.62 CC (mask) 0.79 d 99 we defined 5 distinct domains within the S1 subunit: domain 0 (residues 1 to 275), domain A (residues 276 to 540), domain B (residues 541 to 695), and domain D (residues 755 to 791) the S2 subunit consists of an S2\u2032 cleavage site (residues 969 to 978), a fusion peptide (re a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer, namely ca. 200 kDa for a trimer. a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer, consistent with the 192-kDa glycan contribution. glycan structures that were confirmed by glycopeptide analysis with high confidence are shown schematically with the individual symbols defined (Right) some glycosylation sites exhibit heterogeneous glycan structures, which are stacked onto each other at the same site. the glycan compositions were inferred from molecular masses alone. they were annotated using the standard Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans as high-mannose (Man9GlcNAc2) and core-fucosylated biantennary complex-type N-glycans. the reconstituted glycan EM densities were mostly limited to 1 or 2 N-acetylglucosamine moieties linked to the asparagine side chains due to their intrinsic dynamics. a number of well-defined glycan densities could be traced and modeled with up to 7 monosaccharide residues. N1218 and N949 indicated that the major glycoforms correspond to an M9 high mannose and a nonsialylated, fucosylated biantennary complex-type glycan structure. we attributed this to a core fucose (Fuc) which is consistent with and fully corroborated by the corresponding glycopeptide MS/MS spectrum. the identities of individual N-glycosylated residues within 1 protomer are indicated in green, magenta, and orange. the same views of the overall glycosylation model are shown (Upper Right) with the same coloring scheme as in Fig. 2B. the only 3 N-glycans in domain B are located on N547, N585, and N590, all of which are distant from the putative RBMs. a schematic view of the overall structure indicates the absence of N-glycans in the putative RBMs. domain 0 of FIPV-UU4 S protein lacks the conserved tryptophan residues that galectins use to bind -galactoside through CH\u2013 interactions. ill-defined electron density was indicative of local dynamics such that the putative carbohydrate-binding pocket may still be accessible in solution (SI Appendix, Table S4) glycan array data suggest that positive recognition and binding by domain 0 prefer a minimum Gal(13)GalNAc-core structure sialylated at the 6 position of GalNAc. the additional presence of sialylation at the 3 position of Gal (compound 70) actually inhibited the binding slightly. coVs share conserved sequences and structures of their S2 subunits. the S2 subunit of FIPV-UU4 is structurally similar to that of HCoV-NL63 and porcine deltacoronavirus. FIPV-UU4 has a short S2\u2032 activation loop with only 1 N-glycan (N949) located upstream of the cleavage site. another N-glycan stemming from the other monomer (N841\u2032) is in close proximity to the cleavage site. the coronavirus S2 subunit was analyzed by the ConSurf server. the red arrow indicates the S2\u2032 activation loop. an additional S2\u2032 cleavage site (863RSSR) of HCoV-NL63 is highlighted in blue. the homotrimeric recombinant protein was overexpressed in a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line. the expected molecular mass of the homotrimeric recombinant protein is 465 kDa. however, size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle static light scattering indicated an apparent molecular mass of 722 kDa. the 3.3- cryo-EM map of FIPV-UU4 S protein shown in side view (Left) and top view (Right) with the 3 protomers colored in gold, red, and gray. regions that were resolved by cryo-EM, namely HR2, TM, and CT, are shown in light gray. the high-resolution EM map enabled ab initio model building and refinement to generate an atomic model of FIPV-UU4 S protein. the 3 monomers are intertwined through extensive interactions between the conserved S2 subunits. the 3 S1 subunits form the propeller blades. the S2 subunit consists of an S2\u2032 cleavage site (residues 969 to 978), a fusion peptide (residues 979 to 1055), and 2 heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) corresponding to residues 1056 to 1156 and 1342 to 1403, respectively. the model of the 4 loop segments (residues 1 to 61, 391 to 410, 781 to 7 a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer. a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer. a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer. some glycosylation sites exhibit heterogeneous glycan structures. positions predicted to be N-glycosylated but not experimentally verified are indicated by dashed lines. mass spectrometry-identified high-mannose and complex-type glycans are colored in green and magenta. annotated using the standard Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans as high-mannose (Man9GlcNAc2) and core-fucosylated biantennary complex-type N-glycans. a clear protrusion next to the stem HexNAc was observed. both D and F were derived from the 3.3- map (DPC dataset) a number of well-defined glycan densities could be traced and modeled with up to 7 monosaccharide residues. in the case of N357 and N1218, we could resolve the densities that correspond to 2 GlcNAcs and up to 5 mannoses. this is indicative of these 2 sites being mostly glycosylated by high-mannose-type structures. EM density protruding from the side chain of N949 revealed additional density next to the first GlcNAc moiety linked to N949. we attributed this to a core fucose (Fuc), which is consistent with and fully corroborated by the corresponding glycopeptide MS/MS spectrum. 33 out of 37 predicted N-linked glycosylated sites were identified, including 18 and 15 sites in the S1 and S2 subunits. the identities of individual N-glycosylated residues within 1 protomer are indicated in green, magenta, and orange. the same views of the overall glycosylation model are shown (Upper Right) with the same coloring scheme as in Fig. 2B. domain 0 exhibits major conformational rearrangements between FIPV-UU4 and HCoV-NL63. the only 3 N-glycans in domain B are located on N547, N585, and N590. domain 0 of FIPV-UU4 S protein lacks conserved tryptophan residues. the putative carbohydrate-binding pocket in domain 0 is sequestered by a long loop in the cryo-EM structure. however, the ill-defined electron density was indicative of local dynamics. glycan array data suggest that positive recognition and binding by domain 0 prefer a minimum Gal(13)GalNAc-core structure sialylated at the 6 position of GalNAc. the additional presence of sialylation at the 3 position of Gal (compound 70) actually inhibited the binding slightly. coVs share conserved sequences and structures of their S2 subunits. the S2 subunit of FIPV-UU4 is structurally similar to that of HCoV-NL63 and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV), respectively. these 2 N-glycans may provide steric hindrance for proteolysis of the S2\u2032 activation loop, thereby changing the protease activation requirements and host cell tropism (2). the fusion peptide is colored red, cyan, and indigo. hek293-expressed recombinant FIPV-UU4 S protein was used to immunize mice. the mouse serum was subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of clinical serotype I FIPV-infected cat tissues. the result showed positive cytoplasmic signals in macrophages associated with granulomatous lesions. glycosylation of virus envelope proteins helps shield their antibody-neutralizing epitopes as a way to evade host immunity. the role of the absent glycan shield at the corresponding putative RBMs in FIPV-UU4 S protein should be further investigated. domain 0 of fIPV-UU4 S protein is densely decorated with high-mannose-type glycans. viral envelope or S proteins also exhibit lectin activities to recognize host surface glycans in trans. a number of coVs have been reported to exhibit hemagglutinin activity with some preference for sialylated oligosaccharides. sites were confirmed on the ectodomain of the trimeric S protein. sites were identified on N1092 and N1218 of the Th1 and/or Th2 epitopes. viral protein glycosylation might determine the host tropism (41), immunogenicity, and pathogenicity (42\u201346) HEK293 cells stably expressing FIPV-UU4 S protein were washed by Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco) 2 times prior to inoculation into 9 175T flasks. each containing 350 mL FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Gibco) was cultured in the CELLSPIN System (INTEGRA Biosciences) at 37 \u00b0C for 5 2,436 micrographs were collected with defocus ranging between 1.8 and 2.8 m. accumulated exposure of 48 e/2 distributed over 32 frames. atomic coordinates of FIPV-UU4 S protein have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 20 min. the supernatant was filtered through a membrane with a pore size of 0.22 m. the eluent was concentrated using Vivaspin 20 (GE Healthcare) with 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff. 2,436 micrographs were collected with defocus ranging between 1.8 and 2.8 m. grid preparation was the same as aforementioned for defocus phase-contrast cryo-EM. grid preparation was the same as aforementioned for defocus phase-contrast cryo-EM data collection. grid preparation was the same as aforementioned for defocus phase-contrast (DPC) cryo-EM data collection. 1,405 micrographs of FIPV-UU4 S protein were collected using a 300-keV Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher) with an exposure time of 2.27 s and pixel size of 0.85. the atomic coordinates of FIPV-UU4 S protein have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under ID code 6JX7."}
