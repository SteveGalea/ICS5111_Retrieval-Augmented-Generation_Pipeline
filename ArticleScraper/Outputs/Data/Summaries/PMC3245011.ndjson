{"summary": "virus outbreaks tend to occur every several years in the human population (1\u20134). identification of the causative agent and comparative genomic analysis can be critical to limiting the spread of the virus and identifying suitable treatment options. 'wet lab' experimentation of viral isolates is also important. ViPR contains a wealth of integrated information for a large number of virus families that are pathogenic specifically to humans. this is in contrast with the NCBI viral genome project, which provides sequence data for all viruses (7) or the human Immunodeficiency Virus sequence database. the goal of the BRC program is to provide the necessary data, bioinformatics tools and workflows. e Database (11), >2900 structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; www.pdb.org) (12) and >59 000 Gene Ontology annotations (GO, www.geneontology.org) (13) are updated with each bimonthly release and are directly searchable using intuitive web-based user interface. SFs are categorized as structural (e.g. alpha helices), functional (e.g. active sites), immune epitopes and sequence alteration positions. initial SF definitions for each characterized region have been inspected and validated by domain experts to ensure accuracy. SFVT analysis can rapidly identify genotypic polymorphisms that correlate with a specific phenotype at a finer level of granularity than previously possible. the user begins by selecting a virus family on the home page (Supplementary Figure S2) ViPR has been designed to manage the unique genomic structural and data type characteristics associated with different virus families. the CDC has recently demonstrated that the travel history of US residents having been clinically diagnosed with DENV between 1999 and 2000 validates such an explanation. we will extend the CDC study by performing an in-depth comparative genomics analysis of all DENV serotype 1\u20134 isolates taken between the years of 1999 and 2000. a specific query is constructed for all DENV 1\u20134 records, isolated from humans, between the years 1999 and 2000. in June 2011, this specific query returned 82 whole genome records (8 DENV-1, 33 DENV-2, 33 DENV-3 and 8 DENV-4) from eight countries (Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) archaeopteryx phylogenetic tree viewer can be used to visualize, explore and manipulate the resulting tree using typical actions such as re-rooting, select subtrees, branch swapping, etc. a -strand structure in the DENV-2 E protein, named Dengue_Virus_2_Beta-straind_617(8), spanning positions 617\u2013624 of the polyprotein. a -strand structure in the deNV-2 E protein (PDB: 1OK8) in the ViPR implementation of the Jmol structure viewer. the output from this tool has been validated using a previously published sequence set divided into two groups based on phylogenetic tree topology (32). for the current use case, the DENV-2 polyprotein sequences matching the original search criteria are divided into two groups with 9 and 21 strains. the meta-CATS analysis identified 37 homologous positions that significantly differ between the two defined DENV-2 lineages. ta-strand_617(8) SF identified in current scientific use case. meta-CATS analysis identified 37 amino acid variations that significantly distinguish these DENV-2 lineages, including one located within a known -strand of the E protein. additional investigation will be required to determine whether sequence differences in any of these individual positions affect the secondary structure of the involved protein. ly determined immune epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; www.iedb.org) (11), >2900 structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; www.pdb.org) (12) and >59 000 Gene Ontology annotations (GO, www.geneontology.org) (13) are updated with each bimonthly release and are directly searchable using intuitive web-based user interface.

SFs are categorized as structural (e.g. alpha helices), functional (e.g. active sites), immune epitopes and sequence alteration positions. defined SFs and VTs are found on the respective Protein Details pages. SFVT analysis can rapidly identify genotypic polymorphisms that correlate with a specific phenotype at a finer level of granularity than was previously possible. ViPR includes >64 000 genomic segment sequences from GenBank (9), >220 000 protein sequences from UniProt (10), >1400 experimentally determined T-cell and B-cell epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) all these data are updated with each bimonthly release and are directly searchable using intuitive web-based user interface.
