{"summary": "the lectin DC-SIGN is known to be the major M. tuberculosis receptor on human dendritic cells. if DC-SIGN interacts with M. tuberculosis, variation in this gene might have a broad range of influence in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. tiological agent of tuberculosis tops the world health organization list of deaths due to a single infectious agent. less than 10% of infected individuals develop the disease. host-related factors influence host susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. esion and as a pathogen recognition receptor plays an important role in many DC functions, such as DC-T cell interaction and DC migration [16,17]. besides its cellular recognition role, DC-SIGN serves as pathogen uptake receptor and mediates interactions with a plethora of pathogens other than M. tuberculosis [18] TB patients were bacteriologically-confirmed (smear-positive and/or culture-positive) to present pulmonary tuberculosis. their mean age ( standard deviation) was 36.7 10.9 y, and 51.8% were male. controls were unrelated healthy individuals from the same community. unphased genotypic data were converted into haplotypes using the accelerated EM algorithm implemented in Haploview v3.1 [35] to evaluate accuracy of the algorithm, haplotype reconstruction was performed in parallel using the Bayesian statistical method [36]. eight haplotype-tagging SNPs were selected to genotype the entire panel of 711 individuals. potential population stratification was tested by genotyping 25 unlinked SNP markers in the entire study cohort. TB patients were bacteriologically-confirmed (smear-positive and/or culture-positive) to present pulmonary tuberculosis. their mean age ( standard deviation) was 36.7 10.9 y, and 51.8% were male. the annual risk of infection in this suburb was estimated at 2.5% in 1987. unphased genotypic data were converted into haplotypes using the accelerated EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm implemented in Haploview v3.1 [35] to evaluate the accuracy of the EM algorithm, haplotype reconstruction was performed in parallel using the Bayesian statistical method [36] implemented in Phase v.2.1.1. the alleles 871A (odds ratio [OR]: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.29\u20132.66) and 336G (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.08\u20132.02) increase the risk of developing TB in our cohort. stratification between cases and controls can be a confounding factor. the use of admixed populations in association-mapping studies can be very useful to identify disease-causing genetic variants that differ in frequency across parental populations. however, when the admixture event is too recent, allelic frequencies can differ coincidentally among cases and controls. the 871G and 336A forms corresponded to the derived allele in humans. the 871G is absent in African populations whereas it reaches high frequencies (20%\u201340%) in European and Asian populations. the 871G is absent in sub-Saharan africans. TB has been endemic in Europe for several hundred years, whereas in africa it has probably been rare before contact was initiated with Europeans [41\u201343]. we suggest that the protective alleles 871G and 336A increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of genetic adaptation to a longer period of TB exposure. allele has been shown to affect an Sp1-like binding site and modulate transcriptional activity in vitro by increasing the levels of expression. increased DC-SIGN expression is markedly induced in alveolar macrophages in active TB patients and that M. tuberculosis is preferentially phagocytosed by DC-SIGN\u2013expressing macrophages in these individuals. the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills between 2 million and 3 million people a year. almost one-third of the world's population, or 2 billion people, are thought to be infected with the bacterium. but only about 10% of infected individuals become sick. a number of research groups are studying these genetic factors. some variants of the gene were more common in the group of healthy individuals. the study lends more support to the notion that DC-SIGN is a key player in the control of infectious diseases. a number of research groups are studying these genetic factors. some genes have previously been identified that seem to increase a person's risk of getting sick with TB. authors of this study work on a molecule that plays a role in infection of cells in the lung by the Mycobacterium. world health organization pages on TB: http://omni.ac.uk/browse/mesh/D014376.html OMNI pages on TB: http://omni.ac.uk/browse/mesh/D014376.html Medline PLUS pages on TB: http://medlineplus.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tuberculosis.html The disease kills between 2 million and 3 million people each year. researchers compared make-up of gene for DC-SIGN in all participants. some variants of gene were more common in healthy individuals. study lends more support to notion that DC-SIGN is key player in the control of infectious diseases."}
