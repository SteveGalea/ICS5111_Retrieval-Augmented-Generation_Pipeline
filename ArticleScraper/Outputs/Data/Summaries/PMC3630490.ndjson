{"summary": "emerging infectious disease (EID) can be defined as \u2018an infectious disease whose incidence is increasing following its first introduction into a new host population' emergence in humans is caused by pathogens of animal origin, so-called zoonoses. cross-over events may occur between non-human species including domestic animals and wildlife. human actions that modulate the interplay between pathogens, hosts and environment are at the basis of almost all EID events. for each of the three groups, we will argue how the emergence process is driven by specific sets of causal factors. the framework contributes to understanding the effects of human actions that pave the way for the three distinct emergence scenarios. drivers of disease emergence modulate the interplay between pathogens, hosts and environment. changes in the host\u2013environment and the disease ecology are key to creating novel transmission patterns and selection of novel pathogens with fitter genetic traits. pathogen invasiveness is determined by the combination of pathogen traits, including opportunism and evolvability. the three distinct emergence categories represent the full range of disease emergence scenarios. the rainbow spectrum reflects the full range of possible disease emergence scenarios that can be categorized as emergence in a new host, with new traits or in a new area. pathogens that become dispersed over distances with saltation, across physical barriers in the landscape. climate and weather and land use changes may play a role as drivers. emergence in a novel host includes all events ranging from incidental spill-over to emerging spill-over events. pathogens with apparent pandemic potential have never made it past spill-over events or short human-to-human transmission chains, e.g., Ebola, HEV and monkeypox viruses. adaptation in the novel host is often required for successful infection and subsequent sustained transmission between new hosts. pathogens prone to emerge in a novel host A species jump require utmost pathogen evolvability. pathogens with good environmental survival or transmitted by a range of arthropod vectors may stand a higher chance of infecting new host types than sexually transmitted pathogens. emergence in a novel host depends on the contact rate between the reservoir host and the novel host. major flare-up of disease in a reservoir host can increase spill over to other host types. adaptation in the novel host is often required for successful infection and subsequent sustained transmission between new hosts. the probability of adaptation success is influenced by the number of primary infections, the initial R0, the number of genetic changes required and the pathogen evolvability. s with good environmental survival or transmitted by a range of arthropod vectors may stand a higher chance of infecting new host types than sexually transmitted pathogens. certain pathogens are more prone to periodic species jumps and may again do so in the future. a mere five mutations would render this virus air-borne transmissible. pathogen with novel traits can emerge as a result of mutation or because a latent trait with superior fitness becomes selected for, unlocking host resources that would otherwise remain out of reach. emergence of Nipah virus in pigs and subsequently humans triggered by fruit bats foraging fruit trees near pig farms. pathogens prone to display novel traits in the same host tend to feature a high mutation rate and/or a capability of acquiring novel genetic material through re-assortment or recombination. virulence in RNA viruses is correlated with diversity of quasispecies, a collection of viruses with related sequences generated by mutation. plasmid containing new Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase is easily transferable by horizontal gene transfer. it has conferred carbapenem resistance to many different Entero-bacteriaceae species. the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in microbial communities is not new, but in response to the presence of antimicrobials, the frequencies of these genes may increase through horizontal gene transfer. pathogens with novel traits may find ready access to human hosts via the food chain, through the handling of live animals, via aerosols emitted by animals in the intensive production units, in wet markets, or related to waste disposal. pathogens with novel traits may find ready access to human hosts via the food chain. global fisheries production is undergoing a rapid scaling-up. examples include the emergence of virulent strains of Flavobacterium columnare, Yersina ruckeri and infectious salmon anemia virus in intensively reared salmon. the optimal virulence level may differ for each pathogen\u2013host\u2013environment configuration. pathogens prone to display novel traits in the same host tend to feature a high mutation rate. virulence in RNA viruses is correlated with diversity of quasispecies. recombinant cassava mosaic virus UgV caused a very severe disease in cassava in the late 1980s in sub-saharan Africa. bacteria capable of acquiring novel genetic material through horizontal gene transfer can obtain virulence factors, toxins and/or acquire antimicrobial resistance. pathogen characteristics that optimize transmission in specific food production chains or host meta-populations may be selected for. a 'winner takes all' scenario may occur if a pathogen is much fitter than its progenitors. examples of aggressive pathogens featuring environmental robustness include the H5N1 HPAI virus, E. coli bacteria including E. coli O157:H7 and the infectious bursal disease virus. one example forms a novel methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain that emerged in humans in the Netherlands in 2003. one example forms a novel methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain that emerged in humans in the Netherlands in 2003. advancements in biomedical technology can in rare cases lead to the emergence of a pathogen through an unexpected route of transmission. emergence may entail an expanding range, so-called \u2018geographic expanders' or \u2018geographic jumps\u2019, pathogens that access novel areas and host resources through saltation dispersal. long distance jumps usually governed by chance, as only few pathogens, vectors or infected hosts find access to the novel landscape. extinction may easily occur by chance, even if the R0 of the pathogen in the new landscape is greater than 1. infected host populations or vectors becoming newly established upon arrival may drive a local range expansion of pathogens. a gradual expansion of the geographic range may entail adjustment to an only slightly different landscape, at least during the initial phase. a gradual expansion of the geographic range may entail adjustment to an only slightly different landscape. pathogens prone to emerge in a novel geographic area. pathogens with flexibility are more dispersive and prominent in this disease emergency category. pathogens with flexibility are more prominent in this disease emergency category. globalization of fisheries production and supply explains how white spot disease in shrimps became first introduced in Mozambique from Asia in 2011. the framework presented here comprehensively categorizes the great diversity of EID agents and events on the basis of the changes in the interplay between pathogens, hosts and environment. pathogens fit several emergence categories. for example, influenza A viruses collectively have shown capable of species jumps, virulence jumps, and inter-continental scale invasions. the divide between an existing and emerging disease complex is not always clear. all currently existing pathogens have switched host species, spread geographically and underwent character changes. in some cases, precise information on changes in pathogen genetics, host specificity, transmission modes, incidence and pattern or invasion dynamics relative to the pre-emergence situation is missing. in poor countries, the fight against old and new diseases would present a twin objective."}
