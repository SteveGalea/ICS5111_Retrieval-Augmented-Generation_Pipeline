{"summary": "duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common single-gene disorders in humans, affecting 1 in 3500\u20135000 newborn males. symptoms start to emerge around the age of 2\u20135 years that includes difficulty in walking resulting in patients being wheelchair-bound by the age of 12\u201313 in most cases. the most commonly used option to ameliorate DMD symptoms is the administration of a high dose of glucocorticoids [11]. there are extensive side effects deteriorating the quality of the patient\u2019s life [11]. Variation in the severity of the disorder opened gateways to various therapeutics to ameliorate the severity to a milder phenotype, which is BMD [12]. multi-exon skipping enables us to choose the truncated dystrophin protein which is more functional [24]. multi-exon skipping enables us to choose the truncated dystrophin protein which is more functional [24]. a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic Repeat/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated approach has been demonstrated to remove Dmd exons 52\u201353 systemically in mdx4cv mice with a nonsense mutation in dystrophin exon 53 [26]. a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic Repeat/CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated approach has been demonstrated to remove D morpholino oligomers (PMOs, morpholinos) are one of the most promising AOs. chemical modifications are made to the backbone by replacing the phosphodiester backbone by phosphorodiamidate linkages making PMOs unrecognizable to the nucleases thus greatly enhancing the stability. several PMOs targeting other DMD exons are currently under clinical trials that target exons 42, 52, 53 and 55 [50] an advantage of PMOs is that they have a charge-neutral backbone and as such cell-penetrating moiety can be easily conjugated. vivo-morpholinos (vPMOs) possess a cell-penetrating octa-guanidinium dendrimer. ine X-linked muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model harbors a point mutation in intron 6 that leads to exon 7 being deleted. restoration of the ORF requires exons 6\u20138 being spliced out. AOs are designed so that they bind to exons 6 and 8 causing them to be skipped. 3-PPMO with a total concentration of 12 mg/kg was administered 4 times consecutively to CXMD dogs. exons 6\u20138 were skipped along with the spontaneous deletion of exon 9 which does not disturb the ORF. immunohistochemistry of the myocardium muscles revealed that dystrophin-positive fibers were observed 2 weeks after the last systemic injection. exons 3\u20139 and exons 45\u201355 are found to be mutational hotspots in the DMD gene, covering approximately 7% and 47% of patients, respectively. a 27-year-old male exhibited an asymptomatic phenotype with a deletion of exons 3\u20139 [30,36]. there are 3 ABS in the N-terminal domain (ABS 1--3) skipping of exons 3\u20139 covers the mutational hotspot. it seems a promising therapeutic target. however, further studies are required to test the therapeutic efficiency of skipping exons 3\u20139. del. ex3\u20139 retained ABS1; corrected del. ex6\u20139 retained ABS2; corrected del. ex7\u201311 retained all three. del. ex3\u20139 was the most effective of the 3 strategies by generating a truncated protein lacking amino acids 32\u2013320. dosage of 10-vPMO cocktail targeting exons 45\u201351 and exons 53\u201355 was administered every 2 weeks that showed to efficiently induce skipping of exons 45\u201355. systemic delivery also ensured improved muscle function with no detectable immunoreaction compared to non-treated mice. 41% of myofibers expressed dystrophin when exons 52\u201353 were excised. systemic delivery of the dual vectors ensured dystrophin expression in 34% of the total cardiac myofibers in the heart after 4 weeks post-transduction. modifications are made to the phosphate backbone and the sugar rings that can change the solubility, potency, binding and stability. these modifications protect AOs from nuclease degradation, preventing the interaction of spliceosome machinery with regions of the AO. previous experiments carried out using PMOs have successfully demonstrated the restoration of dystrophin expression in multiple muscle groups following systemic delivery. eteplirsen rescued dystrophin levels in the range of 0.28% of healthy muscle. no adverse effects, immune activation or hypersensitivity have been reported. eteplirsen has a weak evidence supporting its effectiveness in terms of restoring dystrophin expression. the canine X-linked muscular dystrophy model harbors a point mutation in intron 6 that leads to exon 7 being deleted. AOs are designed such that they bind to exons 6 and 8 causing them to be skipped thereby correcting the reading frame. a dose of 120 mg/kg weekly for 5 weeks showed an increase in dystrophin-positive fibers. an improvement in histopathology was observed when the dosage was increased to 240 mg/kg weekly for 7 weeks. clinical grading of the morpholino treated dogs also showed an improvement in walking and running abilities. multi-exon skipping of exons 3\u20139 and exons 45\u201355 are found to be mutational hotspots in the DMD gene, covering approximately 7% and 47% of patients. a 27-year-old male showed an asymptomatic phenotype with a deletion of exons 3\u20139. mutations in the 5\u2032 actin binding region are normally associated with a severe BMD phenotype. the deletion of exons 3\u20139 may produce low quantities of the structurally stable protein. however, further studies are required to test the therapeutic efficiency of skipping exons 3\u20139. del. ex3\u20139 iPSCs targeted introns 5 and 7 and the subsequent deletion of exons 6\u20139. del. ex7\u201311 iPSCs by targeting introns 6 and 11 and the subsequent deletion of exons 7\u201311. the effectiveness of intra-muscular and systemic administration of vPMOs to skip the entire region comprising of exons 45\u201355 was tested in mdx52 mice [37,38]. a dosage of 10-vPMO cocktail targeting exons 45\u201351 and exons 53\u201355 with 6\u201312 mg/kg in total was administered every 2 weeks that showed to efficiently induce skipping of exons 45\u201355. sgRNAs direct Cas9-mediated cleavage of DNA within intronic regions before exons 52 and 53. DNA repair using non-homologous end joining resulted in the deletion of 45 kb of genomic DNA and 330 bp in the encoded mRNA. antisense-mediated exon skipping therapy is a therapeutic strategy developed from the mid-90s. but some barriers are still prevalent especially the nature of personalized therapy. current regulations require each of the AO cocktail components and all possible cocktail combinations to undergo toxicological testing, creating regulatory barriers. the study used iPSCs modified by this gene-editing system. iPSCs may pose a safety concern for clinical applications. however, the success of multi-exon skipping relies on future investigations."}
