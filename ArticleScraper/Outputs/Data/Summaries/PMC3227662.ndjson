{"summary": "viruses, released as cell-free virions from an infected cell, transmit to distant cells and tissues. this spreading pathway contributes to wide-ranged diffusion of cell-free viruses. however, direct infection to a neighboring cell is considered beneficial for the virus in terms of evasion from the host anti-virus defense. the cell-to-cell transmission can be categorized into two manners based on the state of infecting viruses, either cell-free or cell-associated virions. influenza virus, belonging to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, is one of the most serious zoonotic pathogens. a conformational change in the mature HA is induced by a conformational change in the mature HA. HA is triggered at low pH in the endosome, allowing viral ribonucleoprotein complexes to release into the cytoplasm. HA plays a critical role in initiation and progression of influenza virus infection. ant influenza virus spreads from an infected cell to adjacent cells forming infected cell clusters. progeny virions remain associated on surface of infected cell even after budding. then progeny virions could be passed to adjacent uninfected cells. the fluorescence pattern overlapped with the localization of NP derived from the EGFP gene of the NA-deficient influenza virus. the virus can be used to investigate the NA-independent infection pathway of influenza virus. uninfected MDCK cells were infected with the NA-deficient influenza virus at MOI of 0.0001. a single GFP-positive cell was found at 1 hour after starting monitoring. cell-to-cell transmission pathway of influenza viruses is less sensitive to neutralizing antibody. immunofluorescence analyses were performed with cells infected with wild-type influenza virus at 18 hpi using anti-NP antibody and anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) the level of viral spreading was indicated in the graph by measuring NP and GFP derived from wild-type and NA-deficient virus. -deficient influenza virus at MOI of 0.0001 in the presence or absence of 50 M amantadine or 50 g/ml oseltamivir phosphate. amantadine at the concentration of 50 M almost completely inhibited the production of progeny virions. the size of infectious foci was measured with axioVision Release 4.7.2 imaging software (Carl Zeiss) other influenza virus strain, influenza virus A/Udorn/72, was used instead of influenza virus A/WSN/33 because influenza virus A/WSN/33 is highly resistant to amantadine. a single administration of amantadine, fluorescent foci formed some clusters and expanded in a time-dependent manner. the formation of infected cell clusters was observed with co-administration of amantadine and oseltamivir. cell-to-cell transmission occurs on the apical cell membrane. vRNP complex itself is not incorporated in infected cells by adjacent cells. polarity in the influenza virus budding in the transmission pathway is apical. confluent MDCK cells were prepared in transwell inserts and infected with the NA-deficient influenza virus at MOI of 0.0001. after virus adsorption, the antiserum was added from apical or basolateral side. the antiserum added from the apical side could block the cell-to-cell transmission of the NA-deficient influenza virus. the amount of segment 3 viral RNA (vRNA) encoding PA was determined quantitatively by RT-PCR. then, using a mutated primer for PCR, we could introduce a Stu I site only in the PCR products derived from the wild-type sequence. re-infection with the second challenging virus hardly occurs in the absence of oseltamivir. segment 3 of ts53 has a substitution mutation from U to C at the nucleotide position of 701. PCR products were digested with Stu I and separated through 8% PAGE. at 3 hours post superinfection of wild-type virus, total RNA was extracted. cell clusters consisting of 5\u201310 infected cells in an MDCK cell monolayer suggest influenza virus can spread to some extent in the presence of oseltamivir. the NA-deficient influenza virus contains a mutated NA segment, in which the NA coding region including a sialidase catalytic domain was replaced with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene [29] NA-deficient influenza virus was generated by reverse genetics. incubation at 37\u00b0C for 36 hours, immunofluorescence analyses were performed. the virus spreads through cell-to-cell transmission. a polyclonal antibody with the neutralizing activity against influenza virus particles inhibited infection of cell-free viruses to less than 50% at the concentration of 0.03%. the NA-independent transmission of the NA-deficient influenza virus was blocked only when neutralizing antibody was present at the concentration of 0.3%. this results indicated that the NA-independent transmission of influenza viruses is less sensitive to the neutralizing antibody. in the absence of the NA activity, virus spreading from an infected cell to adjacent cells was dramatically suppressed by omission of trypsin from the experimental condition. the GFP fluorescence derived from NA-deficient influenza virus appeared in a single cell at 24 hours post infection. this virus did not spread, but rather disappeared during subsequent 24 hours. the size of infectious foci was measured with axioVision Release 4.7.2 imaging software (Carl Zeiss) the size of infectious foci was clearly different from each other (p0.01) amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus by preventing the translocation of vRNP complexes from endosomes to the cytoplasm. oseltamivir has no effects on viral replication itself but inhibits the release of cell-free virions from infected host cells. polarity in the influenza virus budding in the cell-to-cell transmission pathway is apical. antibody was added to infected MDCK cell monolayer from apical or basolateral side. antiserum added from apical or basolateral side could block transmission. a progeny virion is temporarily bridged by HA between an infected cell and adjacent uninfected cells. the cell-associated progeny virion may have an opportunity to re-infect the previously infected cell compared to a cell-free progeny virion in the general spreading. ts53 virus has a substitution mutation from U to C at the nucleotide position of 701 in the PA gene. oseltamivir appears to suggest that the re-infection had occurred. cDNA was reverse-transcribed with the primer PA-895-rev. cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers, PA-895-rev and PA-695-cut. absence of oseltamivir phosphate was shown in the graph. black bar, in the absence of oseltamivir phosphate, indicates S.D. from 3 independent experiments. the progeny virions of HCV are trapped between infected and uninfected cell membranes at the tight junction. virions fuse with and penetrate uninfected target cells at the tight junction [31]. the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus has not been discussed well. the viral spreading in the absence of oseltamivir appears to be much faster compared to the viral spreading in the presence of the drug. the NA activity prevented progeny virions from entering cells which virus came from. the cell-to-cell transmission started in early phase of infection, and the virus spread through diffusion of cell-free viruses. virions are involved in the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus. they enter into adjacent cells through endocytosis and low pH-dependent membrane fusion using Claudin-1 [8]. the strategy for influenza virus appears to be similar to that for HCV. the limited but distinct level of infection followed by replication could provide some opportunity to generate influenza virus variants. the existence of cell-to-cell transmission pathway gives a caution when NA inhibitors are used, because NA inhibitors may not be sufficient to completely block the spread of influenza virus in local microenvironments. a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 was purchased from Invitrogen. a polyclonal antibody against influenza A virus was obtained from 2-month-old female rabbit immunized with 250 g of purified virions of influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 [54]. recombinant viruses were harvested from the cell surface using bacterial NA derived from Clostridium perfringens (sigma) at 24 hours post transfection, recombinant viruses were harvested using bacterial NA derived from Clostridium perfringens. ts53 virus has a substitution mutation from U to C at the nucleotide position of 701 in the PA gene. RT-PCR ts53 virus has a substitution mutation from U to C at the nucleotide position of 701 in the PA gene. total RNA was reverse-transcribed with PA-895-rev (5\u2032-TTAATTTTAA) cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers, PA-895-rev and PA-695-cut (5\u2032-TCTCCCGCCAAACTTCTCAGGCC-3\u2032) the cDNA was partially corresponding to segment 3 positive sense RNA between nucleotide sequence positions 678 to 700 except for nucleotide positions 696 and 697. rabbit polyclonal anti-NP antibody was used as a primary antibody for indirect immunofluorescence assay. a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 was purchased from Invitrogen. 293T cells were transfected with seven pol I plasmids for production of all vRNA segments of influenza virus A/WSN/33. transIT-293 (Mirus) was used for transfection. at 24 hours post transfection, recombinant viruses were harvested using bacterial NA derived from Clostridium perfringens (sigma) s were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with a secondary antibody. the coverslips were then incubated at room temperature for 5 min with 3 M 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and finally mounted on glass plates. cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope. the level of viral genome replication is no difference between wild-type and ts53. total RNA was reverse-transcribed by reverse transcriptase (TOYOBO) with PA-895-rev (5\u2032-TTAATTTTAAGGCATCCATCAGCAGG-3\u2032) the cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers, PA-895-rev and PA-695-cut (5\u2032-TCTCCCGCCAAACTTCTCAGG-3\u2032) MDCK cells were infected with influenza virus A/Udorn/72 at a MOI of 0.001 PFU per cell. at 36 hpi, the culture supernatant was collected and then its virus titer was determined by plaque assays. each result was represented by a value relative to that in the absence of the drug. MDCK cells were infected with the NA-deficient influenza virus at MOI of 0.0001 in the absence of trypsin. after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours, a single GFP-positive cell was detected. this cell and neighborhood cells was traced during the period from 24 hpi to 48 hpi at interval of 1 hour."}
