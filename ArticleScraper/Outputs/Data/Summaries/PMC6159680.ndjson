{"summary": "rats were acclimated for 14 d after arrival, prior to surgical manipulation. all rats were individually housed in individually ventilated shoebox caging with direct-contact bedding. we used 5 catheter materials (Table 1) in this study. polyurethane, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and silicone catheter tubing samples were obtained from Access Technologies (Skokie, IL), and microrenathane tubing was a gift from Amanda Fisher. the animals were anesthetized by using isoflurane inhalation (5% induction, 2% to 3% maintenance) the animals were anesthetized by using isoflurane inhalation (5% induction, 2% to 3% maintenance) the sites were scrubbed aseptically 3 times with the alternating use of povidone\u2013iodine and 70% isopropyl alcohol. catheter tubing samples were cut into 7-cm segments to measure capillary uptake. each segment was fitted with a small polyurethane bead at 3 cm from one end. fluid was lightly wicked from the short end by using laboratory tissue paper. tubing was threaded through a blunt 17-gauge luer dispensing needle. arrows indicate from top-down: aluminum plug, 7 cm length of catheter, luer stub needle, microcentrifuge tube containing blue glycerol-based dye. catheter on the left was exposed directly to air, whereas catheter on the right was given a white petrolatum-mineral oil coating. syringes were sealed with rubber gaskets removed from their respective plungers. rubber plungers were vented by puncturing and placement of a short length of intramedic polyethylene tubing. in some cases, a 3-cm length of intramedic polyethylene tubing was used as a protective sheath by sliding it over the wet liquid bandage or Krazy Glue. the first patency check was performed after a 2-d surgical recovery period. then the catheter was flushed with saline, and locked with fresh sodium citrate. a catheter coated with liquid bandage could reasonably be expected to remain patent for 4 d between flushes. 0.1 mL blood was drawn into a discarded syringe, flushing with 0.4 mL bacteriostatic saline, and locking with 0.15 mL 4% sodium citrate. all subsequent patency checks occurred at 4-d intervals until loss of patency or 24 d (26 d after surgery) clot length was estimated when possible. rats were acclimated for 14 d after arrival, prior to surgical manipulation. all rats were individually housed in individually ventilated shoebox caging with direct-contact bedding. polyurethane, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and silicone catheter tubing samples were obtained from Access Technologies (Skokie, IL) microrenathane tubing was a gift from Amanda Fisher (Department of Anesthesia, IN University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) the animals were anesthetized by using isoflurane inhalation (5% induction, 2% to 3% maintenance) fur was shaved from the incision sites, and the sites were scrubbed aseptically 3 times. a ventral cervical skin incision (1.5 cm) was made right of the midline of the necks and lightly anterior to the level of the clavicle. catheter tubing samples were cut into 7-cm segments to measure capillary uptake. each segment was fitted with a small polyurethane bead at 3 cm from one end. fluid was lightly wicked from the short end by using laboratory tissue paper. arrows indicate from top-down: aluminum plug, 7 cm length of catheter, luer stub needle, microcentrifuge tube containing blue glycerol-based dye. catheter on the left was exposed directly to air, while catheter on the right was given a white petrolatum-mineral oil coating. arrow indicates air gap purposefully placed between locking solution and dye to prevent mixing. the wet tissue was carefully positioned flush against the inner wall of the syringe. the tissue was sealed with rubber gaskets removed from their respective plungers. to equilibrate air pressure, the rubber plungers were vented by puncturing and placement of a short length of intramedic polyethylene tubing. the first catheter patency check was performed after a 2-d surgical recovery period. then the catheter was flushed with saline, and locked with fresh sodium citrate. the second patency check occurred 3 d after the first, until the catheter lost patency. in total, the catheter was checked for patency on days 2, 5, 9 and 14. 0.1 mL blood was drawn into a discarded syringe, flushing with 0.4 mL bacteriostatic saline, and locking with 0.15 mL 4% sodium citrate. all subsequent patency checks occurred at 4-d intervals until loss of patency or 24 d (26 d after surgery) clot length was estimated when possible. rank test was used to compare catheter patency between the 2 groups. dye migrated 39.7 0.3 mm (mean SE) in the polyurethane catheters. renathane performed comparably to polyurethane for the first 48

greatest migration of dye among the materials tested. all treatments were considered safe and convenient to perform in a surgical setting. 4% sodium citrate-locked polyurethane catheters were exposed to ambient temperature and humidity. 4% sodium citrate-locked polyurethane catheters were exposed to ambient temperature and humidity untreated. mineral oil reduced dye migration to just under half the distance of untreated control catheters. a polyethylene sheath over the liquid bandage coating further reduced dye migration to nearly the level of white petrolatum\u2013mineral oil. white petrolatum-mineral oil performed better than a polyethylene sheath with liquid bandage. four animals from the liquid bandage group were excluded from this analysis. in one rat, the surgical clip became detached, and the catheter became irreparably damaged during a patency check. two catheters in the liquid bandage group remained patent and undamaged at the conclusion of the study (20 d) humidity decreased dye migration by about 35% (P 0.05) in both polyurethane and renathane catheters, humidity decreased dye migration by about 35%. glycerol locking solution reduced dye migration by more than 50%. in the Dry condition, catheter was locked with 4% sodium citrate, 50% glycerol and exposed to ambient temperature and humidity. in the Glycerol Lock condition, catheter was locked with sodium citrate and exposed to ambient temperature and humidity. all variables were tested concurrently within each of 3 separate experiments. cyanoacrylate adhesive is safe and quick-drying but proved unsuitable due to its fluidity and inability to coat the catheters evenly. polyethylene tubing was an external \u2018sheath\u2019 with either liquid bandage or cyanoacrylate adhesive acting as an intracatheter sealant. untreated catheters received an external layer of white petrolatum\u2013mineral oil or liquid bandage or a polyethylene sleeve (Sheath) affixed with either liquid Bandage or cyanoacrylate. white petrolatum\u2013mineral oil reduced dye migration to just under half the distance of untreated control catheters. a polyethylene sheath with cyanoacrylate adhesive was not significantly better than sheath with liquid bandage. white petrolatum-mineral oil performed better than a polyethylene sheath with liquid bandage. all treatments performed better than the control group. evaporation of lock solution causes blood to infiltrate into catheter tip. polyurethane and renathane exhibited the most migration of dye. polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene exhibited the least migration of dye. polyurethane has a water-vapor permeability more than 80 times higher than polyethylene. dye migration was substantially greater in polyurethane than polyethylene catheters. results support practices by research animal vendors who extend patency during shipment. glycerol is found in locking solution formulations where its hygroscopicity8 likely confers resistance to evaporation. the mixture of glycerol with blood made it difficult to visually assess the precise volume of blood drawn. this situation is problematic because it is difficult to directly quantify microRNA or exosomes in small volumes of plasma. the application of liquid bandage was able to extend the patency of sodium citrate-locked polyurethane catheters flushed at 4-d intervals. although thromboses were still observed in the treated catheters during patency checks, they were smaller and easier to remove. it is worth noting that the patency may also be compromised by the growth of fibrin around the intravascular catheter,5 which begins at the site of vascular incision21,25. reducing the number of times a catheter must be flushed has advantages. sodium citrate can be toxic to the animal at high exposure18. heparin may be flushed directly into the blood circulation of the animal. a polyethylene sheath was placed over an implanted polyurethane catheter coated with liquid bandage. overnight, the sheath became detached and was unable to be recovered. this effect may render the sheath unviable."}
