{"summary": "differentiation therapy has been considered a promising approach for the treatment of AML since 1970s. in 1980s, the successful use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that elicited complete remission (CR) of more than 90% of APL patients has brought differentiation therapy from theoretical exploration to clinical application. dasatinib significantly inhibited the growth of a variety of AML cell lines and primary blasts when treated alone or in combination with cytotoxic or molecular-targeted agents. also reported to promote ATRA-induced differentiation of non-APL primary AML cells to ATRA. dasatinib alone could not promote leukemic cell differentiation. MEK inhibitors inhibited dasatinib-triggered phosphorylation of STAT1. also abrogated dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells. results suggest novel mechanism associated with the differentiation-induction effect of dasatinib. at least 20 000 cells were analyzed for each data point. Apoptosis was detected by FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I. cells were stained with the indicated primary antibodies-STAT1 (Santa Cruze, CA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated second antibody and 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 h at room temperature. each incubation step was followed by three washes with PBS. the PCR protocol consisted of thermal cycling as follows. initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s using an Eppendorf epGradient Mastercycler. in all experiments, two negative controls were carried through all steps. infectious Lentivirus was produced by cotransfecting 293T cells with shRNA-expressing lentiviral plasmids together with the packaging plasmid pR8.9 and envelope plasmid pMD.G. Supernatants containing infectious virus particles were collected 48 h after transfection. at least 20 000 cells were analyzed for each data point. Apoptosis was detected by FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit. HL60 cells treated with dasatinib or vehicle were examined and cytospined onto slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 10% FBS for 10 min. each incubation step was followed by three washes with PBS. PCR protocol consisted of thermal cycling as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s using an Eppendorf epGradient Mastercycler. in all experiments, two negative controls were carried through all steps. pLKO.1 lentiviral STAT1 shRNA set (RHS4533, including 5 clones) and pLKO.1 empty lentiviral vector (RHS4080) were purchased from Open Biosystems. pLKO.1 non-target shRNA control plasmid was purchased from Sigma. dasatinib induced the expression of CD11b, a myeloid differentiation marker, in a dose-dependent manner. in consistence with previous study, dasatinib-induced differentiation was paralleled by G0/G1 phase arrest. dasatinib-induced CD11b expression was already detectable as early as 24 h. the population increased to 48% and 68% at 72 h and 120 h. also, dasatinib-induced G0/G1 phase arrest was also in line with the differentiation progression. NB4 cells were treated with different concentrations of dasatinib for the indicated times. the percentages of CD11b expression cells were determined as described. data presented are the mean SD of three independent experiments. b significantly decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705). phosphorylation of STAT3 (S727) and STAT5 (Y694) was almost undetectable after 3 h treatment. dasatinib treatment induced the redistribution of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. the experiments were repeated three times and the data show the representative results. cells showed markedly reduced NBT positive cells after dasatinib treatment compared with Vector and Non-target shRNA-expressing cells. STAT1-knockdown HL60 cells also showed significantly reduced CD11b expression after dasatinib treatment. *** P.001 (C) CD11b expression was measured by flow cytometer. data presented are the mean SD of three independent experiments. phosphorylation of p38 was transiently abolished within 1 h. dasatinib-induced HL60 cells differentiation could not be abrogated by JAK inhibitor AG490. HL60 cells were treated with dasatinib (10 M) for 72 h. PD98059 significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced CD11b expression in both cells. PD98059 also significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced G0/G1 phase arrest. the activation of MEK and ERK was successfully inhibited by PD98059. HL60 cells were treated with dasatinib (10 M) in the presence of PD98059 (20 M) for 72 h. NB4 cells were treated with dasatinib (5 M) in the presence of PD98059 (10 M) for 48 h. the percentages of CD11b expression cells were determined as described. dasatinib induced the expression of CD11b, a myeloid differentiation marker, in a dose-dependent manner. in consistence with previous study, dasatinib-induced differentiation was paralleled by G0/G1 phase arrest. dasatinib-induced expression of CD11b was in a dose-dependent manner at low concentrations (1.25 and 2.5 M) however, high concentrations (5 and 10 M) of dasatinib did not induce an enhanced expression of CD11b. this could be attributed to dasatinib-induced increase of hypodiploid cells at 72 h. dasatinib induces differentiation of NB4 cells. NB4 cells were treated with different concentrations of dasatinib for indicated times. the percentages of CD11b expression cells were determined as described. phosphorylation of STAT3 (S727) and STAT5 (Y694) was determined by immunofluorescence assay. the expressions of two direct STAT1 target genes were tested by real time PCR. dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was virtually detectable at 0.5 h. representative fluorescence microphotographs showed a translocation of STAT1 from cytoplasm to nucleus. expression of CXCL-10 and RIG-G and IRF-1 mRNA was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. expression of GAPDH was used as the internal control gene. STAT1-knockdown HL60 cells also showed significantly reduced CD11b expression after dasatinib treatment compared with Vector and non-target shRNA-expressing cells. the results indicated that knockdown of STAT1 in HL60 cells resulted in a significantly decreased differentiation response to dasatinib stimulation. b expression was measured by flow cytometer. cells were collected onto slides by cytospin, stained by Wright\u2013Giemsa stain. the data are representative of three independent experiments. dasatinib-induced differentiation could not be abrogated by AG490. HL60 cells were treated with dasatinib (10 M) for 72 h. expressions of p-MEK, p-ERK, p-STAT1(Y701) and p-STAT1(S727) were analyzed by Western blotting. PD98059 significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced CD11b expression in both cells. HL60 cells were treated with dasatinib (10 M) in the presence of PD98059. PD98059 also significantly inhibited dasatinib-induced G0/G1 phase arrest. HL60 and NB4 cells were treated with dasatinib in the presence of PD98059. the percentages of CD11b expression cells were determined as described. data presented are the mean SD of three independent experiments. tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 was significantly down-regulated by dasatinib, while the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was unaffected. tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was down-regulated by dasatinib, while the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was unaffected. dasatinib-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 may disrupt apoptotic signal pathway. phosphorylation of STAT3 may disrupt apoptotic signal pathway caused by the decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation. previous studies have shown that dasatinib-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 (Y701 or S727) was significantly activated in dasatinib treated AML cells. SFKs have been reported to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. dasatinib significantly induced the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. this phenomenon could be partly explained by the fact that dasatinib is also a weak RAF inhibitor. atinib\u2019s biological effect on AML differentiation may provide some molecular theoretical basis for clinical application when dasatinib is combined with other target based drugs in leukemia therapy."}
