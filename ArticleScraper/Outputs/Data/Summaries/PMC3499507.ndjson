{"summary": "nucleolus is a highly ordered subnuclear compartment organised around genetic loci called nucleolar-organising regions (NORs) formed by clusters of hundreds of rDNA gene repeats organised in tandem head-to-tail repeat [1], [2] the nucleolus is dedicated to RNA-polymerase-I-directed rDNA transcription, rRNA processing mediated by small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (soRNPs) and ribo the nucleolus is also the target of viruses including HIV-1, hCMV, HSV and KSHV. both their sequences encompass a nucleolar localisation signal (NoLS) overlapping with their nuclear localisation signal (NLS), which governs their nucleolar localisation [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [31]. two major studies by Machienzi et al. have revealed important functional links between HIV-1 replication and the nucleolus [49], [50]. first, they could inhibit HIV-1 replication and Tat transactivation function using a TAR decoy specifically directed to the nucleolus. a similar approach, with an anti-HIV-1 hammerhead ribozyme fused to the U16 small nucleolar RNA and therefore targeted to the nucleolus, could dramatically suppress HIV the functionality of TAP-Tat was confirmed by transfecting Jurkat TAP-Tat and TAP cells with a luciferase reporter gene vector under the control of the HIV-1 LTR. this resulted in a highly enriched population of transduced cells presenting different expression levels of the transgene (Figure 1B) SILAC analysis of Jurkat-T cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. NTAP-Tat (36 kDa) was detected using anti-HIV-1 Tat antibody.

PP1 accounts for 80% of the ser/Thr phosphatase activity within the nucleolus. PP1 was found to be potentially enriched by 1.52-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat. PP1 was also identified as part of the in vitro nuclear interactome. yBX1 YBX1, the DNA/RNA binding multifunctional protein was enriched by 1.38-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat. tyrosine kinase ZAP70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) was enriched by 1.24-fold in the nucleolus expressing Tat. the pro-apototic signaling molecule, Caspase 10 (CASP10), was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat-Tat cells. ADAR1 Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat-Tat cells (0.78-fold) node degree connection analysis of our network identified HIV-1 Tat as the most connected protein. a total of 146 proteins have been previously described to interact with Tat. aver the third of these proteins exhibit an increase in fold ratio change. ribosomal biogenesis We initially focused on ribosome biogenesis. we could observe a general and coordinated increase in the abundance of ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus by Tat expression. several proteins involved in rRNA processing exhibited an overall increase in nucleolar accumulation upon Tat expression. the only three proteins that were significantly depleted from the nucleolus upon expression of HIV-1 Tat were RBMX (0.89-fold), HNRNPA2B1 (0.84-fold) and SNRPA (0.81-fold). several investigations showed expression alteration in cellular splicing factors in HIV-1 infected cells [96], [96]. the 26S proteasome is composed of the 20S core particle (CP) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP) CP can associate with the 11S RP to form the immunoproteasome. the consequences of these interactions include the competition of Tat with 11S RP or 19S RP for binding to the 20S CP. ubiquitin-protein ligase UHRF1 (1.13-fold), UBC (1-fold) and two Ubiquitin-specific-peptidases, USP30 (1.28-fold) and USP20 (0.06-fold) Upon HIV-1 Tat expression, we observed the coordinated nucleolar enrichment of several cellular factors associated with DNA replication and repair pathways. apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APEX1) (1.29-fold) knockdown was found to inhibit HIV-1 infection by more 60%. HMGA1 interact with HIV-1 Integrase and is part of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex. PFKP catalyzes the irreversible conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. at the end of the glycolytic pathway, PKM2, in its tetrameric form, is known to generate ATP and pyruvate. LDHB diverts the majority of the pyruvate to lactate production and regeneration of NAD+. phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) (1.41-fold), cytidine-5-prime-triphosphate synthetase (CTPS) (1.74-fold) catalyses conversion of UTP to CTP. ribonucleotide reductase large subunit (RRM1) (1.56-fold) we compared Jurkat TAP-Tat with Jurkat-tat, a cell line stably expressing untagged Tat. both cell line exhibited comparable HIV-1 LTR activity following transfection with pGL3- LTR. NTAP-Tat (36 kDa) was detected using anti-HIV-1 Tat antibody. NTAP-Tat overlaps with fibrillarin (green), HIV-1 Tat (red) and DAPI (Blue or in grey contrast on the top left panel) 85 million cells from each culture were harvested, pooled and their nucleoli were isolated. each step of the procedure was closely monitored by microscopic examination. nucleolin (110 kDa) and Fibrillarin (34 kDa) were found to be highly enriched in the mixed nucleolar fraction. data from the mass spectrometry analysis was deposited in the Tranche repository database. we annotated the quantified proteins using the toppGene Suite tools. the best-represented biological processes included transcription (24%), RNA processing (23%), cell cycle process (13%) and chromosome organisation (15%) nucleophosmin (NPM1/B23), C23, FBL, nucleolar protein P120 (NOL1), and nucleolar protein 5A (NOL5) could reflect specific nucleolar reorganization and altered activities of the nucleolus. ribosomal protein L13 1.74 CTPS CTP synthase 1 1.70 HINT1 histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 1.66 DPYSL2 Dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 1.66 IMPDH2 IMP (inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate) dehydrogenase-like 2 1.63 MYH9 Myosin heavy chain, type A 1.63 GNB1 Guanine nucleot 68 YWHAG 14-3-3 protein gamma 0.60 DBN1 Drebrin 0.29 RPL35A 60S ribosomal protein L35a 0.06 USP20 Ubiquitin specific peptidase 20 Ratios over one correspond to proteins with an increase in abundance. ration less than one correspond to proteins with a decreased abundance. cleolar detection level was low, we increased separately the amount of total protein loaded to 20 g. the threshold of protein abundance changes can be determined statistically and would then highlight the larger abundance changes. we next focused on both enriched or depleted individual proteins with activities associated with HIV-1 or Tat molecular pathogenesis. pRb protein displayed a 1.4-fold change in the nucleolus upon Tat expression. pRb can be hyperphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated upon Tat expression. previous studies have demonstrated Tat-mediated activation of STAT3 signaling. tyrosine kinase ZAP70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) was enriched by 1.24-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat [76]. Tat expression could promote the relocalisation of ZAP70 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, with a distinct enrichment in the nucleolus. ADAR1 belongs to the in vitro HIV-1 Tat nuclear interactome. PP1 accounts for 80% of the Ser/Thr phosphatase activity within the nucleolus. PP1 was found to be potentially enriched by 1.52-fold in the nucleolus of Jurkat cells expressing Tat. the hyperphosphorylation of pRB triggers in its translocation into the nucleolus [71]. pRB is also associated with an increase in ribosomal biogenesis and cell growth. two recent studies have described Matrin 3 as part of ribonucleoprotein complexes. adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat-Tat cells. ADAR1 over-expression up-regulates HIV-1 replication via an RNA editing mechanism. centrality analysis revealed a threshold of 23.7 interactions per protein. the network is organised in a hierarchical architecture [92] where connected nodes are part of highly clustered areas maintained by few hubs around HIV-1 Tat. proteins were organized according GO biological processes and KEGG pathways identified by the toppGene Suite tools. red and green denotes proteins with increased or decreased nucleolar abundance. we identified and quantified 55 proteins out of 108 known spliceosomal proteins. these include the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins U1, U2 and U5, Sm D1, D2, D3, F and B, and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. the only three proteins that were significantly depleted from the nucleolus upon expression of HIV-1 Tat were RBMX (0.89-fold), HNRNPA2B1 (0.84 ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major proteolytic system of eukaryotic cells. the 26S proteasome is composed of the 20S core particle (CP) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP) CP can associate with the 11S RP to form the immunoproteasome. addition of Tat promoted the dissociation of the 19S subunit from the 20S proteasome, followed by the distinct enrichment of the 19S-like complex in nuclear extracts. we quantified UBA1 (1.36-fold), the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UHRF1 (1.13-fold), UBC (1-fold) and two Ubiquitin-specific-peptidases, USP30 (1.28-fold) XRCC5 (Ku80) knockdown decreased retroviral integration and Tat-mediated transcription. apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APEX1) knockdown was found to inhibit HIV-1 infection by more 60%. glycerate kinase 1 (PGK1)S (1.57-fold), glucose phosphate isomerase (1.45-fold), triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) (1.37-fold), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoglyceric acid mutase (PGAM1) catalyze the irreversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate in IMPDH2 (1.66-fold), a rate-limiting enzyme at the branch point of purine nucleotide biosynthesis, leads to the generation of guanine nucleotides. in parralel, we noted the increased abundance of phosphoserine aminotransferase PSAT1 (1.90-fold), an enzyme implicated in serine biosynthesis, which has been linked with cell proliferation in vitro. oW (Pescadillo Bop1 WDR12) complex essential for maturation of large ribosomal subunit was significantly depleted from the nucleolus of Jurkat TAP-Tat cells. however, the other PeBoW complex components, Pes1 (0.94-fold) and WDR12 (1.1-fold), were not affected by Tat expression. we identified and quantified 55 proteins out of the known spliceosomal proteins. co-factors were distinctively enriched in the nucleolar fraction of Jurkat cells expressing Tat. heat-shock can cause the HSP90 and HSP70 to relocalise to the nucleus and nucleolus [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], corroborating our proteomic quantitative approach. the consequences of these interactions include the competition of Tat with 11S RP or 19S RP for binding to the 20S CP, which resulted in the inhibition of the proteasome activity [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111]. a recent study demonstrated that in the absence of Tat, proteasome components are associated to the HIV-1 promoter and proteasome activity limits transcription. replication factor C1 (RFC1) and RFC2 (1.31- and 1.28-fold respectively) showed an increased fold change. RFC4 was severely depleted (0.69-fold) from the nucleolar fraction upon Tat expression. XRCC6 associates with viral preintegration complexes containing HIV-1 Integrase. phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1)S (1.57-fold), glucose phosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) (1.45-fold), triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) (1.37-fold), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (1.17-fold) and phosphoglyceric acid mutase (PGAM1) (0.89-fold) in we have characterised the significant enrichment of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) (2.11-fold), which branches of the glycolysis pathway to generate NADPH, ribose-5-phosphate an important precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides. IMPDH2 (1.66-fold), a rate-limiting enzyme at the branch point of purine nucleotide biosynthesis, leads to the generation of guanine nucleotides -1 relies extensively on the host cell machinery for its replication. the viral regulatory protein is known to interact with an array of cellular proteins. the viral regulatory protein is known to modulate cellular gene expression and signaling pathway. we have selected and employed a polyclonal population of Jurkat T-cells expressing Tat at different levels. this heterogeneity in Tat expression levels might reflect Tat stochastic expression described during viral replication [153]. ribosomal proteins and enzymes associated with ribosomal biogenesis were in the top 20 most enriched nucleolar proteins. this effect appears to be specific to HIV-1 Tat since transcription inhibition by Actinomycin D resulted in the overall depletion of ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus [9]. the presence and potential roles of molecular chaperones in the nucleolus have been highlighted by Banski et al. we also noted the marked nucleolar enrichment of enzymes belonging to the nucleotide synthesis pathway. we also noted the concomittant nucleolar enrichment of enzymes belonging to the nucleotide synthesis pathway. nucleotide metabolism enzymes are associated with the nucleus, but glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm. glycolytic enzymes, such as PKM2, LDH, phosphoglycerate kinase, GAPDH, and aldolase, also have been reported to display nuclear localization and bind to DNA. the mechanisms of Tat-mediated segregation and compartimentalisation of proteins in or out of the nucleolus may depend on factor(s) inherent for each protein and the nature of their relationship with Tat. we could observe cases where Tat upregulated the expression of proteins which resulted in a general increase of theses proteins throughout the cellular compartments including the nucleolus. phosphorylation is induced by Tat following enriched proteins, pRb, PP1 and STAT3. these enzymes account for the majority of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation activity in the nucleolus. phosphorylation status determines subcellular distribution, thus providing a potential mechanism for their redistribution by Tat. gen strain, Ponti et al, analysed the effects of Tat on ribosome biogenesis. they observed a defect in pre-rRNA processing associated with a decrease in the level of 80S ribosomes. however, the different cellular system employed combined with the 3 days heat-shock induction make their results difficult to compare with ours. the changes in nucleolar protein abundance have highlighted the extensive and coordinated nucleolar reorganization in response to Tat constitutive expression. our findings underscore that Tat expressing T-cells exhibit a unique nucleolar proteomic profile. this may reflect a viral strategy to facilitate the progression to robust viral production. this further increases our confidence in our experimental strategy.
