{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral pneumonia in children worldwide. a maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. maternal immunization against influenza, tetanus, and pertusiss has been shown to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in preventing disease in infants. influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with decreased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. an RSV illness episode was defined as the presence of any symptoms occurring for a minimum of one day with a mid-nasal swab obtained and RSV detected on PCR assay. clinical and sociodemographic data were collected at enrollment and weekly visits. birthweight was included in the analysis if obtained within the first 72 hours after birth. 3693 pregnant women were enrolled and followed from April 2011 to May 2014. 944 nasal swabs were collected during 3554 person-years of follow-up while pregnant or postpartum. a respiratory virus detected in 556 (59%) of these swabs. in number of other children in the household (P = 0.80), use of an open indoor cookstove (P = 0.09) or presence of household members who smoked (P = 0.73) comparison of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of women with and without RSV infection. seven (50%) mothers sought care at local health care facilities. of these, two visited a medicine shop and five saw a practitioner. no mothers with RSV infection died. onavirus (n = 1; 20%), rhinovirus (n = 2; 40%), human metapneumovirus (n = 1; 20%), and bocavirus (n = 1; 40%) effect of RSV infection in pregnancy on birth & infant outcomes All seven women with RSV illness during pregnancy delivered live born infants. infant gest age (weeks)c 37 (34, 42) 40 (28, 42) Stillbirth 0 (0) 63 (2) Low birthweighta 1 (20) 678 (25) Pretermc 2 (29) 469 (13) Small-for-gestational-age 1 (20) 1495 (55) Six month weight (g)d 7180 (5070, 8530) 6740 (1540, 11720) Six month length (cm)d 65 (61, 68) 64 (41, 76) median differences in RSV viral load between mothers and infants was 1.9 log10 copies/mL (range, 1.5\u20133.5). median differences in RSV viral load between mothers and infants was 1.9 log10 copies/mL (range, 1.5\u20133.5). the color intensity of the box represents the number of participants with symptoms, with each box representing one day. the median RSV viral load was 4.1 log10 copies/mL (range, 2,2.3\u20138.5) an additional respiratory virus was detected in five illness episodes. aAvailable for 5 infants born to women with RSV and 3391 live born infants born to non-RSV mothers. bAvailable for 7 infants born to women with RSV and 3612 live born infants born to non-RSV mothers. 2 infant-mother pairs had RSV detected on the same day. 4 of their infants also had RSV. the infant and mother had RSV four weeks apart. a potential vaccination strategy would be similar to the pertussis strategy. a phase II trial of a maternal RSV vaccine candidate was recently found to be safe and immunogenic in non-pregnant women of childbearing age. the median duration of fever was only two days, and total symptom duration was four days. this is in contrast to a case report of pregnant women with RSV at an academic medical center in the united states. milder cases of febrile RSV disease without fever can have adverse effects on maternal and infant outcomes. symptomatic febrile RSV illness during pregnancy and after delivery was rare among mothers in south Asia."}
