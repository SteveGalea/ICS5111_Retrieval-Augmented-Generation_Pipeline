{"summary": "changes in mRNA abundance are often triggered in mammalian cells during viral infection. this decay contributes to viral immune evasion, increases availability of host translation machinery, and facilitates temporal viral gene regulation [7\u201311]. accelerated mRNA decay is not broadly counteracted by increased transcription-based repopulation, but instead leads to a more extensive shutdown of cellular gene expression. in uninfected cells expressing muSOX, this Pol II repression phenotype is linked to differential trafficking of RNA binding proteins (RBP) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. depletion of cellular exonucleases suggests additional mechanisms contribute to transcriptional repression during infection. mRNA decay-linked decrease in nuclear levels of several transcription factors, including key Pol II subunits. location on replicating viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional effects of mRNA decay. MHV68-infected cells showed promoter-proximal loss of Pol II at 86% of loci compared to mock-infected cells. loss of Pol II occupancy was primarily due to muSOX-induced mRNA decay, as this signal loss either did not occur or was reduced at 67% of these loci during infection with MHV68. eq antibody, 8WG16 [27] saw a similar decrease in Pol II levels at the promoter with both antibodies and a decrease in the Rplp0 gene body Pol II occupancy. each row of the heat map displays pol II occupancy of one gene from -1000 to +1000 in 25 bp bins. genes are ranked by the Pol II-transcription start site (TSS) proximal signal in mock infected cells. pressed host genes during MHV68 infection from the ChIP-seq data. students paired t-test on raw % input values. Mock is compared to MHV68 R443I infection on the left. the difference in regression line slopes between MHV68 and mock infected cells was more marked when comparing pol II promoter occupancy. this is consistent with data from previous studies that found no defect in serine 2 phosphorylation of elongating Pol II and no consistent change to Pol II elongation during MHV68 infection. pol II removal from host transcripts is not impacted by MHV68 infection or by RNA decay. pol II ChIP was performed on mock and MHV68 infected MC57G cells treated with the indicated siRNAs. mRNA decay factors are depleted in the nucleus in an RNA decay dependent manner. Pol II subunits are depleted in the nucleus of MHV68 infected cells in an RNA decay dependent manner. a heatmap showing normalized reporter ion abundance of all 12 Pol II subunits in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where light blue represents lower abundance. we examined classes of proteins that increased or decreased in a host shutoff dependent manner in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (S2 B-D) the nucleus-specific changes included decreased levels of 7 subunits of Pol II, the general transcription factor (GTF) TFIIB, and the large subunit of the GTF TFIIA. pol II occupancy at viral genes is not affected by RNA decay. herpesviral genes are transcribed in the nucleus by mammalian Pol II. this could be similarly subjected to mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression observed across the host genome. Pol II ChIP-qPCR signal is similar across gene bodies. three regions of the ORF54 and ORF37 gene were assayed by qPCR. this was true for both WT and R443I infections. mRNA decay causes increased trafficking of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. the majority of infected cells displayed increased nuclear PABPC compared to unreactivated or uninfected cells as measured by immunofluorescence (IF). however, PABPC did not appear to be excluded from replication compartments. d to imunofluoresence (IF) analysis at 27 hpi using antibodies against PABPC and Pol II. RCs were identified in cell nuclei as regions that contained Pol II but stained poorly for DAPI. IF was performed on KSHV-positive iSLK cells reactivated for 48 h. Pol II occupancy of both integrated viral promoters was repressed upon transfection with muSOX and vhs. the MHV68 M7 viral promoter driving puromycin resistance was lentivirally integrated into 293T cells. a non-MHV68 promoter escapes repression on the viral genome. to test this, we measured the Pol II occupancy and transcriptional potential of the CMV promoter, which drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression on the MHV68 genome. however, in either a plasmid context or when integrated into 293T cells, the CMV promoter is strongly repressed during muSOX-induced mRNA decay. 293T cells were transfected with muSOX or a GFP control fused to the cell surface glycoprotein Thy1.1 with an intervening P2A ribosome skipping sequence. RNA was isolated by biotin-streptavidin pull down. levels of newly transcribed RNA from the indicated genes were measured by RT-qPCR. latent infection does not promote mRNA turnover, and thus we transfected muSOX into these cells to stimulate mRNA turnover in the absence of lytic replication. the viral genome per se does not confer protection from transcriptional repression; instead, features linked to lytic genome amplification in replication compartments facilitate robust Pol II recruitment. MHV68-infected cells showed promoter-proximal loss of Pol II at 86% of loci compared to mock-infected cells. MHV68-infected cells showed promoter-proximal loss of Pol II at 86% of loci compared to mock-infected cells. the phosphorylation state of the CTD was recognized by the ChIP-seq antibody, 8WG16 [27]. we saw a similar decrease in Pol II levels at the promoter with both antibodies and a decrease in the Rplp0 gene body Pol II occupancy. each row of the heat map displays Pol II occupancy of one gene from -1000 to +1000 in 25 bp bins. pol II levels were assayed near the TSS of two repressed host genes during MHV68 infection from the ChIP-seq data. mock is compared to MHV68 MHV68 infection on the left and to MHV68 R443I infection on the right. the difference in regression line slopes between MHV68 and mock infected cells was more marked when comparing Pol II promoter occupancy. this is consistent with data from previous studies that found no defect in serine 2 phosphorylation of elongating Pol II and no consistent change to Pol II elongation during MHV68 infection. pol II removal from host transcripts is not impacted by MHV68 infection or by RNA decay. Pol II ChIP was performed on mock and MHV68 infected MC57G cells treated with the indicated siRNAs. accelerated mRNA decay by the coordinated activity of muSOX and Xrn1 causes RNA binding protein relocalization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. we multiplexed these TMT labeled fractions and subjected them to quantitative liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) we observed the expected increase in nuclear levels of the RNA binding proteins PABPC1 and LARP4 in cells infected with WT MHV68 compared to mock or R443I infected cells. we examined classes of proteins that increased or decreased in a host shutoff dependent manner in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the nucleus-specific changes included decreased levels of 7 subunits of Pol II, the general transcription factor (GTF) TFIIB, and the large subunit of the GTF TFIIA. muSOX-induced mRNA degradation during MHV68 infection causes both RNA binding protein relocalization and depletion of multiple components of the cellular transcriptional machinery. pol II occupancy at viral genes is not affected by RNA decay Herpesviral genes are transcribed in the nucleus by mammalian Pol II. the average Pol II signature across 82 viral ORFs between -500 and +500 around the transcription start site was comparable in cells infected with viral genes are not susceptible to RNA decay-dependent Pol II repression. sequence tags were plotted as a histogram in 25 bp bins for -500 to +500 around the TSS. Pol II ChIP-seq coverage across 5.5 kb of the MHV68 genome. replication compartments in the nucleus selectively enrich for factors required for viral replication. mRNA decay causes increased trafficking of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. however, PABPC did not appear to be excluded from replication compartments. MHV68 infected 3T3 cells were subjected to imunofluoresence analysis at 27 hpi using antibodies against PABPC and Pol II, and stained with DAPI. RCs were identified in cell nuclei as regions that contained Pol II but stained poorly for DAPI. herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) endonuclease vhs. viral promoter sequences are insufficient to escape transcriptional regulation. MHV68 M7 viral promoter driving puromycin resistance was lentivirally integrated into 293T cells. a non-MHV68 promoter escapes repression on the viral genome. to test this, we measured the Pol II occupancy and transcriptional potential of the CMV promoter, which drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression on the MHV68 genome. in either a plasmid context or when integrated into 293T cells, the CMV promoter is strongly repressed during muSOX-induced mRNA decay, similar to host genes. 293T cells were transfected with muSOX or a GFP control fused to the cell surface glycoprotein Thy1.1 with an intervening P2A ribosome skipping sequence. levels of newly transcribed RNA from the indicated genes were measured by RT-qPCR. latent infection does not promote mRNA turnover, and thus we transfected muSOX into these cells to stimulate mRNA turnover in the absence of lytic replication. we also observed an RNA decay-induced repression of Pol II occupancy at the latent viral promoter LANA while the viral K1 promoter was repressed in 4 out of 5 experiments. the replicating viral genome recruit Pol II with similar efficiency during normal or accelerated mRNA decay. this protection is lost upon relocation of the viral promoters into the host genome or when the viral genome is in a latent state. the reduction in Pol II and general transcription factor protein levels during MHV68 infection at least partially underlies the ensuing Pol II occupancy defect on the host genome. Influenza A virus reduces Pol II subunit levels through direct binding of Rpb1 by the viral polymerase, leading to decreased Pol II occupancy at host genes. RNA viruses do not depend on Pol II for viral transcription. pol II appears to be most strongly affected at the stage of recruitment. transcription termination suggests that MHV68 does not induce termination defect and run-on transcription of host genes that occurs during infection with HSV-1. early data showed that while the endogenous mouse -globin locus was transcriptionally repressed during HSV-1 infection, its expression was rescued upon integration of the -globin gene into the HSV-1 genome. at least one of these proteins, PABPC, was shown to be associated with transcriptional repression. this indicates that selective exclusion of PABPC from these compartments is not the mechanism by which the viral genome escapes repression. we hypothesize that either the state of viral DNA or other protective features of the replication compartment confers escape from transcriptional repression. we hypothesize that the \u2018open\u2019 state of viral DNA during lytic replication plays an important role in facilitating Pol II recruitment under conditions of accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA decay. it is possible that the open state of the DNA, particularly late in infection, also contributes to the relatively uniform occupancy of Pol II across MHV68 genes. it will be interesting to investigate if the general chromatin state of the host genome also changes in infection. pGL3-kLANA was made by amplifying the KSHV LANA promoter sequence. pGL3-kLANA was introduced into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL3. cells and transfections MC57G mouse fibroblast cells (ATCC), 293T cells (ATCC) and NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS 293T cells expressing the kLANA-puromycin cassette were transfected with 1 g pGL3-kLANA-puromycin using polyJet, then selected with puromycin for random integration events. muSOX and GFP were each expressed from a vector containing an upstream Thy1.1 sequence separated from muSOX or GFP by a P2A ribosome skipping site. transfected cells were then passed over a column to enrich for RNA (300 g) was incubated in biotinylation buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 5 mM EDTA) and 5 g MTSEA-biotin (Biotium #90066), rotating at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. phenol:chloroform was extracted and precipitated with isopropanol. western blotting cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors [Roche]) cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM cDNA was quantified using iTaq Universal SYBR Mastermix. iSLK-Bac16 cells were plated on coverslips (5 x 104 cells/well of a 12-well), reactivated 24h later with doxycycline and sodium butyrate. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) ChIP was performed from 15 cm plates of cells. 3 x 106 MC57G or 293T cells were plated 24 h before infection. cells were harvested 24 h after infection or transfection. crosslinked cell pellets were mixed with 1 mL fractionation buffer. beads were washed with low salt immune complex (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% Triton-x-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS), high salt immune complex (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% Triton-x-100, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS), lithium chloride immune complex (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 a custom index was made of the mm10 and MHV68 genomes with Bowtie2 build. tdf files were made from bam files and indexes made from those bam files. analysis of mapped reads was performed with HOMER. annotatePeaks was run in the\u2013hist mode to assess composite Pol II occupancy across the viral genome. cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using membrane filters as previously described. samples were digested overnight at 37\u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.3 at a 1:50 trypsin:protein ratio. peptides from all three biological replicates were labeled with a 6-plex TMT kit following the scheme in Fig 3A. pooled peptides were fractionated by 2D StageTip as described [23]. the nuclear channels (126 \u2013 128) and cytoplasmic channels (129\u2013131) were analyzed in separate Proteome Discoverer studies. a fully tryptic search against a mouse Uniprot database was performed. the mass spectrometry proteomics data reported in this paper have been deposited at the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository. pCDEF3 muSOX (Adgene 131695) and vhs (Addgene 131696) and SOX have been previously published. 293T cells were treated with 1 g/mL doxycycline and 1 mM sodium butyrate. lentivirus was made from 2nd generation plasmids at a MOI 1 for 2 hours with 4 g/mL polybrene (Fisher) 293T cells were infected with KSHV by reactivating iSLK-Bac16 cells for 48 h and then spinfecting cell-free virus onto a monolayer of 293T cells. 3 million MC57G cells were nucleofected with a 100uL Neon tip to knockdown Xrn1 or Dis3L2 using a pool of 4 siRNAs or a non-targeting control using 10 L of 20 M siRNA. samples were eluted twice with 65\u00b0C wash buffer.
