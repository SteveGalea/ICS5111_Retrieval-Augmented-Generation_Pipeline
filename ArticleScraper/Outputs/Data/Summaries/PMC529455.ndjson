{"summary": "the first four fellows to complete a clinical ethics fellowship discuss their experiences. they describe the goals, structure, participants and activities of the fellowship. they identify key elements for succeeding as a clinical ethicist and sustaining a clinical ethics program. a clinical ethics fellowship is perceived by some to be one of the ways in which necessary core competencies can be acquired [2] clinical ethics experience may assist individuals in the development of their abilities to identify and analyze ethical problems, use reasonable clinical judgment, communicate effectively, negotiate and facilitate when there is conflict, and act as a resource for healthcare professionals. the JCB offers two bioethics graduate programs. the fellowship provides multi-site clinical ethics opportunities at both specialty and general hospitals. each fellow rotated through four of the JCB's eight affiliated teaching hospitals. the JCB is the largest multi-disciplinary group of in-hospital ethicists in Canada. the fellowship provides multi-site clinical ethics opportunities at both specialty and general hospitals. candidates must have a graduate degree in bioethics or a professional degree with significant bioethics training. a minimum of one day per week was spent working at the JCB. the fellows received a monthly stipend that was sufficient for covering basic costs of living. the fellowship focuses on developing models of clinical ethics practice in diverse healthcare settings. the weekly meetings and case conferences were a resource for the clinical ethics fellows to receive collegial support and networking opportunities. the weekly seminars featured local, national and international speakers on a wide range of topics. fellows were encouraged and mentored to participate in a wide range of activities. fellows mentor graduate bioethics students by including them in consultations. each fellow was exposed to a wide variety of consultation experiences. fellows participated in policy and guideline development, although these activities consumed less time than educational and consultation duties. the first fellows were accepted into the JCB's clinical ethics fellowship program. Paula Chidwick and Laurie Hardingham were the first fellows accepted into the fellowship program. Karen Faith completed a master in science majoring in bioethics. fellowship aims to develop exemplary models of clinical ethics practice in diverse healthcare settings. activities include research and practice collaborations, sharing of ideas and resources, strategic planning and policy discussions. fellows actively participated as full members of the group in these meetings. fellows collaborated and co-presented with the hospital ethicist. they also provided background literature, developed presentation materials and other resources for the Clinical Ethics Group on specific ethical issues as requested. fellows mentor graduate bioethics students by including them in consultations. each fellow was exposed to a wide variety of consultation experiences. the number of consultations varied from one site to another. Paula Chidwick and Laurie Hardingham were the first fellows accepted into the JCB's clinical ethics fellowship program. she completed an ethics internship at Sunnybrook and women's college health sciences JCB. she has taught philosophy and ethics at the University of Calgary and Mt. royal college. the fellowship helped prepare fellows to make the transition to clinical ethicists. the focus of this fellowship was clinical practice. a fellow recalls a case involving a family having a very difficult time coming to terms with a loved one. fellows honed their mediation, communication and negotiating skills in observing and responding to conflicts pertaining to patient care decisions. they developed political, practical and conflict resolution skills in both observing and responding to conflicts pertaining to healthcare decisions. clinical ethicists shared personal experiences of morally distressing situations. they modeled the need for broad consultation through the JCB consultation group and debriefing with colleagues as a way to cope with stress. the skills that were nurtured and developed during the fellowship mirror the ethical assessment skills, process skills and interpersonal skills. clinical ethics is a relatively young field that continues to evolve and define itself. fellows learned common misperceptions of the clinical ethicist's role included that of moral expert, judge of right and wrong, legal expert, risk manager, ethics police, ombudsperson, locus of ethics for the institution and final decision-maker. traits such as self-knowledge and self-awareness influenced their own self-care practices. clinical ethicists upheld an ethical position in the face of considerable opposition. the traits deemed important by the fellows reflect many of the character traits that are considered to be prerequisites to successful healthcare ethics consultation [2,11]. a clinical ethics program needs to be integrated throughout the organization. clinical ethicists are best able to succeed in this capacity when they develop collaborative relationships with other service providers in the healthcare settings. one clinical ethicist had particular expertise in pediatric settings and was called upon often by colleagues when an ethical challenge concerned the care of neonates or children. fellows were not allowed into particular hospitals until infection control restrictions were lifted. full-time three-month block placements for fellows have been implemented at some hospital sites rather than the split workweek. fellows also faced challenges of being available, flexible and accommodating. fellows exposed to stylistic and theoretical differences in the way clinical ethics was practiced when working with ethicists who entered the field through diverse academic and clinical backgrounds. the fellowship helped prepare fellows to make the transition to clinical ethicists by providing real-time clinical opportunities. the fellowship helped prepare the fellows to make the transition to clinical ethicists by providing real-time clinical opportunities. \"everything be done\" was defined by the family to include CPR and admission to intensive care. the fellow was uncomfortable with the decisions made without directly hearing the patient's voice. fellows became familiar with the fast-paced clinical environment and culture, the healthcare providers' values and practices. clinical ethicists honed their mediation, communication and negotiating skills. they learned to use wisdom or judgment, particularly in establishing credibility, gaining trust and responding to challenges regarding their role and duties. fellows participated in educational and practice activities to support their skill development. clinical ethicists were called upon to do ethics consultations, provide information and share expertise in various areas of ethical concern. clinical ethicists' organizational ethics activities included the development of policy, guidelines and procedures, collaborative initiatives with other departments and professionals and strategic planning. traits such as self-knowledge and self-awareness influenced their own self-care practices and ability to manage work demands and work related-stress. the traits deemed important by the fellows reflect many of the character traits that are considered to be prerequisites to successful healthcare ethics consultation. clinical ethicists cannot work in isolation and need the support of a network of colleagues both within and outside of the field of ethics. clinical ethicists are best able to succeed in this capacity when they develop collaborative relationships with other service providers in the healthcare settings for example, risk management, pastoral care and social work. the clinical ethics fellowship assisted fellows in developing their own understanding of what \"bioethics is\" the one-year practical learning experience in clinical ethics was perceived by the fellows as an excellent way for them to begin to understand what it means to be a clinical ethicist. fellows were exposed to stylistic and theoretical differences in the way clinical ethics was practiced when working with ethicists who entered the field through diverse academic and clinical backgrounds. the potential for such differences to become a barrier to learning and building trust within the clinical ethicist/fellow relationship. each of the first four fellows has obtained a position as a clinical ethicist in a healthcare setting. a clinical ethics fellowship that is applicable to individuals from a variety of backgrounds appears to be a viable educational option. author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. authors wish to acknowledge Sue MacRae, Deputy Director, Joint Centre for Bioethics and Barbara Secker, Clinical Ethicist, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute for their editorial and substantive comments."}
