{"summary": "a 4-hour experiential training program was delivered to frontline health care professionals who would be expected to care for a patient with EVD. the program occurred in a simulation center with multiple flexible spaces and consisted of demonstration, multiple skills practice sessions. the questionnaire assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: donning and doffing PPE, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and management of a contamination breach. a simulation laboratory-based program was used as the foundation training for frontline staff in the correct use of PPE for clinical care activities. the program was designed to ensure the safety of staff, patients, and the general public by training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) program includes disaster exercises, semester-long courses for professional students, web-based simulation exercises, and large-scale high-fidelity curricula that utilize human simulators and actors. participants will actively do and doff PPE, learn and practice the management of biosafety level 4 hazardous waste. the curriculum described hereafter is a 4-hour fundamental interprofessional training course designed for potential EVD caregivers. the course consists of a concise didactic session and observation of a demonstration of donning/doffing EVD-required PPE. participants role-model expected care activities for this patient population. up-to-date protocols are being taught as recognized by the institution. participants are asked to delay specific questions regarding the protocols until they are actively participating in the don/doff exercise. the environment in which the PPE is worn will necessitate enhanced teamwork. the narrator reads the checklist slowly and methodically. the safety monitor assists participants in the active exercise of donning/doffing PPE. the checklists were developed based on the BWH protocol for Ebola management. mannequin should have an IV arm with a primary IV set infusing saline through an infusion pump. a 2-mg infusion of magnesium sulphate should be available. mannequin should have a urinary catheter, a catheterization start kit, and drainage bag. the rest of the room should appear as a patient isolation room. one faculty member should suffice to perform as the patient and observe for later debriefing. if a second faculty member is available, that would be of additional benefit. setup requires ample room marked by tape to mimic both a hot zone and a warm zone. appropriate doffing accessories (chlorine-based wipes, armless stationary stool, waste containers, and receptacle for PPE) should be available. up-to-date protocols are being taught as recognized by the institution. participants are asked to delay specific questions regarding the protocols until they are actively participating in the don/doff exercise or until the end of the program. the environment in which the PPE is worn will necessitate enhanced teamwork. up-to-date protocols are being taught as recognized by the institution. participants are asked to delay specific questions concerning the protocols until they are actively participating in the don/doff exercise. the environment in which the PPE is worn will necessitate enhanced teamwork. the narrator reads the checklist sequentially as the safety monitor assists the clinician in the donning/doffing procedure. the safety monitor assists participants in the active exercise of donning/doffing PPE. two faculty members are needed at each station to assist in learning activities. individual requirements of the three stations follow. mannequin should be placed on a table or in bed wearing a nonrebreathing mask. mannequin should be placed on a table or in bed wearing a nonrebreathing mask. mannequin should be ventilated with a bag-mask ventilator and intubated orally. mannequin should have an IV arm with a crystalloid infusion for drug administration. a 2-mg infusion of magnesium sulphate should be available. a dressing and tape should be available as well. a urinary catheter, a catheterization start kit and a drainage bag should be available. the mannequin will be placed on typical linens with an absorbable underpad. equipment to initiate and secure a peripheral IV and an IV infusion pump must be present. the rest of the room should appear as a patient isolation room. mannequin is dressed in hospital garb and is laying at 45\u00b0 in a bed with a blanket covering it. the mannequin will have a urinary catheter with a drainage bag that has 700 ml of fluid simulating urine hanging off the side of the bed. faculty may refer to protocols for such tasks included in this publication. but the principle learning objective is that participants are able to perform already-known tasks within the confines of the PPE. debriefing The debriefing consists mostly of a facilitated discussion by participants on what the expected and unexpected consequences of having the PPE in place were on their ability to perform basic patient care tasks. two-hundred and twenty health care professionals participated in the training. the survey assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: management of a contamination breach, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and donning and doffing PPE. 97% rated the faculty as good or outstanding, and 97% rated the faculty as good or outstanding. the program was successfully deployed and well received by the health care professionals in our institution. participants were instructed that if a suspected breach occurred, they would be directed by their trained observer. confidence increased in the system of donning and doffing in pairs with an observer guiding. simulation case.docx mep-12-10433-s001.zip (299.5KB, zip) All appendices are peer reviewed as integral parts of the original Publication."}
