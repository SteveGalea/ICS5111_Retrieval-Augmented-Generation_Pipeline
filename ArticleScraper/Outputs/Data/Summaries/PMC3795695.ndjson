{"summary": "adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide range of infections at mucosal sites. HAdV vectors are widely used for the study of cellular processes. they are chosen as gene and vaccine delivery vehicles for clinical use. to understand basic mechanisms of HAdV induced inflammation, it is important to understand modes of HAdV entry into various cell types. caveolin-1 and -2 are found in most cell types, while caveolin-3 is present only in muscle cells. Knockout of the gene for caveolin-1 in mice also reduces caveolin-2 expression. caveolae-like structures were identified as possible pathways of viral entry for SV40 in 1989 [15], but SV40 entry via caveolae was recently disputed [16]. existing evidence suggests entry begins with a binding of the adenovirus capsid fiber knob to a cellular receptor such as the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) [38], CD46 [39,40], or in particular for viruses causing epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, GD1a glycan [41]. this secondary interaction is thought to induce a host cell signaling cascade resulting in clathrin mediated end V-D37 co-localized to a greater degree with caveolin-1 than with LAMP1 (p=.0068) in A549 cells HAdV-C2 co-localized predominantly with caveolin-1 (p=.02) HAdV-C2 failed to infect corneal cells in culture, and in A549 cells co-localized predominantly with caveolin-1. HAdV-D37 co-localized predominantly with caveolin-1. HAdV-D37 co-localized predominantly with caveolin-1. HAdV-C2 was not seen in corneal cells. the chemical PP2 (10 M) was used to inhibit Src kinase activity. at both 30 min and 1 hr post infection, viral entry appeared nearly completely blocked by pretreatment with either MCD or RGD. PP2 (10 M) was used to inhibit Src kinase activity. MCD pretreatment prevented virus from entering the cells at 30 min and 1 hr post infection as compared to no pretreatment. PP2 treatment did not effect caveolin-1 levels in infected cells. fractions 9-11 were enriched with caveolin-1, indicating the presence of caveolae. fractions 9-11 were enriched with caveolin-1, indicating the presence of caveolae. a pathway mediated by caveolin-1, and involving Src kinase, is an important route of HAdV entry into human corneal cells. for both fractions, the quantity of viral DNA was reduced by MCD pretreatment (*p.05) there was no difference in E1A expression between virus infected cells and those pretreated with MCD but replenished with cholesterol. the data presented is representative of four experiments each run in duplicate. a siRNA oligo against caveolin-1 reduced its expression in corneal cells to 5% of normal (p=.0002, Figure 4A) Western blot analysis after siRNA transfection also showed reduction in caveolin-1 protein as compared to untransfected or control siRNA. HAdV-D37 infection of corneal cells after caveolin-1 knock down by siRNA reduced IL-8 expression by 50%. confocal microscopy performed at 30 min, 1 hr, and 24 hr post infection. western blot analysis of wild type and caveolin-1-/- mice corneas. showed increased pSrc at 1 and 24 hr post infection compared to wild type mice. caveolin-1 -/- mice did not show increased pSrc even after 24 hr infection. infected mice corneas showed 60% less CXCL1 expression compared to wild type corneas. ELISA data suggest HAdV-D37 enters corneal cells at least in part via caveolae, in an integrin dependent and Src kinase mediated pathway. caveolae are submicroscopic, membrane associated vesicles found abundantly in some but not all mammalian cells. each caveolae contains approximately 140-150 caveolin-1 molecules [74] membrane-associated vesicles in human corneal fibroblasts labeled well with antibody against caveolin-1. within 30 min after viral adsorption, many caveolin-1 expressing vesicles were seen to contain virus. the size of the caveolin-1 containing vesicles in corneal cells ranged from 80-140nm in diameter. therefore some vesicles appeared to accommodate the 90 nm diameter adenovirus. tron microscopy for caveolin-1 (E, F) was performed on cells infected as above. cells stained for caveolin-1 showed binding of 10 nm gold particles to flask-shaped vesicles. virus (arrows) can be seen within vesicles also associated with gold particles. HAdV-37 uses caveolin-1 to enter human corneal cells. human corneal and A549 cells grown on slide chambers were infected with HAdV-D37 (red) cells were stained with caveolin-1 or LAMP1 antibodies. HAdV-D37 co-localized with CTXB at all time points. at 30 min after warming, HAdV-D37 and CTXB co-localization was observed. primary corneal cells were pretreated with MCD (5 mM) to deplete cholesterol prior to infection with HAdV-D37. western blot analysis of detergent free lipid raft preparations revealed increased caveolin-1 in lipid rafts from virus infected cells. caveolin-1 was seen at much lower levels and only in the 5th fraction of mock infected cells. in cells that were MCD treated prior to virus infection, caveolin-1 was reduced. HAdV-D37 enters corneal cells via caveosomes. blots show increased caveolin-1 and pSrc upon viral infection. PP2 treatment did not effect caveolin-1 levels in infected cells. a pathway mediated by caveolin-1, and involving Src kinase, is an important route of HAdV entry into human corneal cells. HAdV-D37 uses primarily caveolin-1 to enter corneal cells. we cannot exclude alternative possible effects of MCD on clathrin mediated mechanisms. MCD pretreatment reduced the presence of viral DNA in both endosomal fractions. a siRNA oligo against caveolin-1 reduced its expression in corneal cells to 5% of normal. HAdV-D37 infection of corneal cells after caveolin-1 knock down by siRNA reduced IL. siRNA and scrambled (sc)RNA were generated and transfected into human corneal cells. real-time RT-PCR for caveolin-1 mRNA confirmed successful reduction of caveolin-1 message (95%) as compared to scRNA transfected cells (*p=.0002) XCL1 protein expression was reduced in caveolin-1 -/- mice as compared to wild type mice. caveolin-1 is important to viral entry, kinase activation, and subsequent chemokine expression. tology of PP2 or DMSO (control) pretreated corneas at 16 hr post infection with HAdV-D37 or buffer control shows a reduction in keratitis with chemical inhibition of Src kinase. PP2 reduced corneal inflammation as assessed by histology 4 days post infection. SV40 was reported to use the caveolar pathway to enter cells [15,72], but was later observed to use a caveolae independent pathway [16,60,73] each caveolae contains approximately 140-150 caveolin-1 molecules [74] to confirm caveolin associated viral entry into corneal fibroblasts, we performed ultrastructural studies with and without viral infection. icles in the same cells were much less abundant and no clathrin staining vesicles were seen to contain virus. these results confirm that HAdV-D37 uptake into human corneal fibroblasts occurs in vesicles containing caveolin-1. specimens were stained with uranyl acetate and Sato\u2019s lead stain, and viewed by transmission electron microscopy. clathrin-dependent endocytosis is used by pathogens as a gateway to cellular entry. most well studied mechanism of receptor-mediated entry is clathrin-dependent endocytosis. caveolae are ubiquitous on the surface of cells, particularly in fibroblasts. HAdV-D37 appears to rely on lipid raft mediated, caveolin-1 associated endocytosis. in corneal stromal cells, HAdV-D37 appears to rely on lipid raft mediated, caveolin-1 associated endocytosis. in vitro data suggest a role for Src kinase in the caveosome during viral entry. JC virus enters cells via clathrin mediated endocytosis. other polyomaviruses enter cells using uncoated vesicles independently of both caveolin and clathrin. mice were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (85 mg/kg) and xylazine (14 mg/kg) mice were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (85 mg/kg) and xylazine (14 mg/kg) mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation prior to removal of corneas for histology. cells were partially fixed in 0.05% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in PBS containing 2% FBS, and permeabilized in solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100. images were taken in a leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 63x glycerol immersion objective. mouse corneas were harvested at various time points after HAdV-D37 injection. cells were stained with antibodies to caveolin-1, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) LAMP1, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 488-CTXB, (Invitrogen, OR) 500l fractions were collected and the protein concentrations measured. lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pSrc to identify phosphorylated Src in LR along with the LR marker caveolin-1. post nuclear supernatants were then mixed with an equal amount of 62% sucrose. nm was transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 48 hr post transfection, cells were infected with HAdV for 2 hr. cells were then analyzed for caveolin-1 and IL-8 message using real-time RT-PCR. real-time PCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green master mix. total RNA was extracted from caveolin-1 or scrambled siRNA transfected cells. total RNA was then treated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C for 1hr. two g of the RNA treated RNA was subject to reverse transcription.
