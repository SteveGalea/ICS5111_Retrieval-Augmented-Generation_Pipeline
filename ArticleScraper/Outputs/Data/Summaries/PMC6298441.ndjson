{"summary": "protein microarrays have facilitated a rapid, systematic and high-throughput approach to probing an entire pathogens' proteome or fraction thereof for immunoreactivity. they have aided in the discovery of potential diagnostic markers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-coronavirus. the majority of these arrays have been manufactured using either the E. coli-based or the wheat germ cell free in-vitro transcription/translation expression system. the largest to date includes 30% of the entire P. falciparum proteome (13\u201317) invasive P. falciparum merozoite would be accessible targets for protective antibodies (33). we extracted literature to identify multiple potential surface-associated merozoite proteins (32\u201334, 38\u201343) and added new proteins that were identified as immunogenic in adults from malaria-endemic countries. we expressed and purified these proteins and printed them on a custom microarray. gene expression Plasmids containing codon-optimized genes of interest were either obtained from the plasmid repository Addgene. predicted signal peptides and transmembrane domains were excluded and the serine or threonine amino acid residues in all potential N-linked glycosylation sites were substituted with alanine. proteins were subsequently expressed using the Expi293 expression system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Expi293F cells were cultured to a density of 2.0 106 cells/ml. cells were transfected with expression vectors using the Expifectamine 293 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with 8% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 125 rpm. proteins were reduced with 40 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), alkylated with 80 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) and precipitated using cold acetone. Peptides were desalted using P10 c18 pipette ZipTips (Millipore) the top 10 most intense ions were selected for ms2 and fragmented with higher-energy collision fragmentation using normalized collision energy of 28. the top 10 most intense ions were fragmented with higher-energy collision fragmentation using normalized collision energy of 28. these ions were subsequently excluded for the next 20 s. CD data (ellipticity in mDeg) were normalized for protein concentration and the number of residues yielding the mean residue ellipticity in mDegcm2dmol1res1. the mass spectrometry raw files generated and analyzed in the current study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium51. the first control spots were Alexafluor647 human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) that served as landmarks demarcating the four edges of each mini-array (4 spots to match the edges of each mini-array) the last sets of controls were the CD4, MBP, and GST proteins (1 spot each) to control for any potential antibody reactivity against the tags. slides were carefully assembled onto the hybridization cassette and sealed using silicone gaskets (ARYC) to form leak-proof individual wells. wells were washed thrice with 0.1% Tween 20/HEPES buffered saline. non-specific binding to the slide surface was prevented by blocking with 200 l of 2% BSA/0.1% Tween 20/HBS for 2 h at room temperature while rotating on a microarray hybridization station. a pre-determined concentration for each recombinant protein was either heat-treated at 80\u00b0C for 10 min or left untreated and coated overnight at 4\u00b0C on 96-microwell ELISA plates. wells were washed four times in PBST and blocked at room temperature with 1% skimmed milk (marvel)/PBST for 5 h. five serum samples from adults residing in Sweden reported no travel to malaria-endemic regions and designated malaria nave sera (MNS) were used as negative controls. an additional serum pool from Kenyan adult residents was designated malaria immune sera (MIS) h et al. (34), Raj et al. (43), Polley et al. (40, 45), Kimbi et al. (46), Metzger et al. (47), Taylor et al. (41), and Burghaus and Holder (48), for inclusion in the KILchip v1.0. these proteins are known or predicted to be anchored or associated with the surface of merozoites, secreted from its apical organ Expi293F cells were cultured to a density of 2.0 106 cells/ml. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with 8% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 125 rpm. a minority of proteins were expressed in E. coli using pGEX-2T and pMAL-c2X vectors. LC-MS/MS Analysis, Protein Validation, and Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy Five to fifteen g of purified recombinant proteins were denatured in 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0 (Sigma) proteins were reduced with 40 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), alkylated with 80 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma) and precipitated using cold acetone. the top 10 most intense ions were selected for ms2. the top 10 most intense ions were fragmented with higher-energy collision fragmentation using normalized collision energy of 28. a maximum of two unique peptides for a protein was considered a positive identification. the raw CD data (ellipticity in mDeg) were normalized for protein concentration and the number of residues yielding the mean residue ellipticity [] in mDegcm2dmol1res1. the raw files generated and analyzed in the current study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium51 (PXD011746) each mini-array contained 384 features (printed spots) at a volume of 400 pl per spot. recombinant P. falciparum proteins (n = 111) and controls (n = 17) were printed on each mini-array in triplicate. printing was carried out at 50% relative humidity and at 18\u00b0C. slides were incubated overnight at 18\u00b0C in the arrayer after printing. salt scan was carried out at a high photomultiplier at the 532 nm wavelength (green channel) to verify post-printing quality and at the 635 nm wavelength (red channel) slides were scanned using a genepix 4,000 B scanner coupled to the GenePix Pro & Microarray Acquisition and Analysis Software (Molecular Devices) four slides fitted into a 4 24 hybridization cassette (Arrayit Corporation ARYC), thus accommodating 84 samples per cassette and 336 samples per hybridization workstation (ARYC) each of which contains 4 hybridization cassettes. protein printing buffer (30% glycerol/PBS, 9 spots) was used as the third set of controls. each mini-array contained a total of 384 features. 333 derived from 111 P. falciparum recombinant proteins. non-specific binding to the slide surface was prevented by blocking with 200 l of 2% BSA/0.1% Tween 20/HBS for 2 h while rotating on a microarray hybridization station. wells were washed thrice and incubated with 150 l of donkey anti-human fragment specific Alexafluor647 for 3 h at room temperature followed by three washes. individual wells were washed and incubated with 100 l of either test sera or monoclonal antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. wells were washed four times in PBST and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 100 l of the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 1%Marvel/PBST. the reaction was stopped with 30l of 2M H2SO4 per well and the absorbance read at 492 the protocol was approved by SERU, reference number KEMRI/SERU/CGMR-C/001/3139. five serum samples from adult residents of Kilifi, Kenya were used as negative controls. 111 P. falciparum proteins, 21 of which were novel targets, were successfully printed onto KILchip v1.0. protein fragments corresponded to polymorphic variants of MSP1 (n = 7), MSP2 (n = 3), MSP3 (n = 1) and SURFIN4.2 (n = 2). MSP3, MSPDBL1 N-terminus, MSPDBL1 C-terminus, MSPDBL2 C-terminus, 2 extracellular loops of PF3D7_0629500, Pf SEA1, SURFIN 4.2 3D7A, SURFIN 4.2 3D7B and the C-terminus of SURFIN 4.2. %Thirteen polymorphic variants of the P. falciparum merozoite proteins MSP1, MSP mAb 5.2 (62), mAb 2AC7 (63, 64) and mAb QA1 (64) showed no reactivity when the target antigen was heat-denatured. low or negligible reactivity was observed between monoclonal antibodies and off-target recombinant proteins. a decrease in immunoreactivity was observed when the proteins were heat-denatured. 75 region II (mAb R218), MSP1 (mAb 5.2), MSP4 (mAb 2.44), RH5 (mAb QA1 and mAb 2AC7) and rat CD4 domain (OX68) were used to measure reactivity against recombinant proteins by ELISA. low/negligible reactivity was observed after heat-denaturation of the recombinant proteins. commercial human IgG (green), while none was detected against the printing buffer (yellow) when probed with MIS, high levels of antibody reactivity against multiple P. falciparum proteins were clearly visible. when probed with MIS, negligible antibody reactivity was observed. the median (minimum-maximum) fluorescence intensity (MFI) responses to AMA1, MSP2 and MSP3 were 23629 (1426-64840), 4762 (733-37025), and 2105 (72-4069), respectively in the Kenyan adults. reactivity against all P. falciparum proteins was low at 44 (4-914) and 28 (-2-994), respectively. a comparison of antibody responses to triplicate readings of AMA1, MSP1 and MSP2 was measured in 66 serum samples from adults living in the malaria endemic region of Kilifi, Kenya. a strong positive correlation of >0.98 was observed in all three-way scatter plots tested for the three antigens. results from 12/111 (10%) of the proteins printed on the array are shown in Figure 7. curves to the majority of proteins were comparable indicating the detection of responses up to 3 months post printing without significant variation. 40,000 to 60,000 all had an optical density value of 4.0 (red box) all had an optical density value of 4.0 (red box), the upper limit detectable by ELISA. a comparison of antibody responses to 12 antigens measured simultaneously in KILchip v1.0 and individually by ELISA. two antigens (MSP2-CH150/9 and PF3D7_0424400) were printed twice to serve as internal controls. proteins were either selected from the literature or from a combination of proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. @Technical controls for the assay included Alexafluor647 human IgG, purified human IgG and protein printing buffer. a subset of the well-studied proteins were evaluated using monoclonal antibodies targeting conformational and disulfide-constrained epitopes. native and heat-denatured recombinant proteins tested for reactivity against malaria immune sera (MIS), malaria nave sera (MNS) and 5 monoclonal antibodies targeting conformational-dependent epitopes. all recombinant proteins demonstrated high reactivity with their respective monoclonal antibodies only. KILchip v1.0 Specificity To confirm specificity of antibody detection, individual mini-arrays were probed with the following positive and negative controls. strong fluorescence was detected on each mini-array for the landmarks (blue) and commercial human IgG (green), while none was detected against the printing buffer (yellow) high reactivity to AMA1, MSP2 (3D7), and MSP3 (3D7) and low reactivity to Rh5 and RIPR was observed in serum samples from adult residents of Kilifi. antibody reactivity to selected, previously characterized proteins varied in order AMA1 > MSP2 > MSP3 > Pf RH5 > RIPR. intra- and inter-assay variability was tested using 66 serum samples. antibody measurements between protein spot replicates tested in the same assay and on the same day were strongly positively correlated, Spearman's R > 0.9770, p 0.0001. protein stability on KILchip v1.0 measured responses to the same batch of microarray slides over a 3 months period using the reference reagent, MIG. slides were printed on the same day, with identical printing conditions and the same batch of recombinant proteins. a strong positive correlation coefficient was observed between antibodies measured by KILchip v1.0 and the standard ELISA, P 0.0001. sixty-seven percent of the proteins tested had a correlation coefficient R above 0.8. a wider dynamic range of antibody measurement was evident in the protein array as observed for AMA1. strong fluorescence was detected on each mini-array for landmarks (blue) and commercial human IgG (green), while none was detected against the printing buffer (yellow) when probed with MIS, high levels of antibody reactivity against multiple P. falciparum proteins were clearly visible. when probed with MIS, negligible antibody reactivity was observed. intensity of antibody reactivity varied in order AMA1 > MSP2 > MSP3 > Pf RH5 > RIPR. median (minimum-maximum) fluorescence intensity responses to AMA1, MSP2 and MSP3 were 23629 (1426-64840), 4762 (733-37025), and 2105 (72-4069), respectively. activity was measured repeatedly on five separate microarray slides. the average signal intensities against individual proteins were highly reproducible. a comparison of antibodies to triplicate readings of AMA1, MSP1 and MSP2 was measured in 66 serum samples. we observed no significant differences in the slopes for all 6 pairwise comparisons for 79/111 (71%) proteins (T-test; p > 0.05). of the 32 proteins whose slopes differed significantly from each other, eight proteins had a single curve that differed while 24 proteins had 2 or more significantly different slopes. results from 12/111 (10%) of the proteins printed on the array are shown in Figure 7. a subset of samples whose MFI values ranged from 40,000 to 60,000 all had an optical density value of 4.0 (red box), the upper limit detectable by ELISA. a strong positive correlation of >0.8 was observed in 8 of the antigens (A\u2013H), while four antigens (I\u2013L) showed a correlation coefficient between 0.65 and 0.78. the chip is durable, easily stored and transported, and can be shared between laboratories. other protein microarrays have been in existence since the early 2,000 s. none has been designed and developed from africa specifically to study naturally acquired immunity against P. falciparum malaria merozoites. KILchip v1.0 is a sensitive tool for the detection of P. falciparum specific antibody responses. antibody measurements were stable on KILchip v1.0 up to 3 months post-printing. this is probably due to the addition of 60% glycerol to the recombinant proteins at the time of printing. the DBL domains of MSPDBL1 and MSPDBL2 have been previously obtained in soluble recombinant form using the baculovirus expression system. however, a higher response to these proteins expressed in the wheat germ cell-free expression system has been reported in children in Papua new Guinea. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. we observed no differences in the background signals when malaria nave sera were tested against recombinant proteins grouped according to their expression levels. we observed no differences in the background signals when malaria nave sera were tested against recombinant proteins grouped according to their expression levels. protein bands for PF3D7_1343700 and PF3D7_0629500_SEG2 were not readily visible on a coomassie stained SDS gel. protein bands for AMA1 and CD4-hexa-histidine tags were included as controls."}
