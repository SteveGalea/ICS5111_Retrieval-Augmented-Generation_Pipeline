PDCoV and TGEV infection levels on pAPN-deficient and reconstituted ST cells quantified by flow cytometry. infection levels are shown normalized to parental ST cell infection. experiments were repeated four times; averages are shown. pAPN expression rendered HeLa and Vero cells susceptible to PDCoV infection. pAPN expression rendered them susceptible to PDCoV infection at levels similar to those observed on ST cells. PDCoV can infect cell lines of galline and human origin. PDCoV infects cells of human and avian origin. the integrity of the mutant cell line was confirmed by Western blotting. PDCoV infects cells of human and avian origin. PDCoV S1 binding was observed to cells expressing hAPN or gAPN. PDCoV S1 binding was observed to cells expressing hAPN or gAPN. PDCoV S1 binds to APN of human and avian origin. mFc-tagged PDCoV S1 and S1B fusion proteins were incubated with equimolar amounts of mFc-tagged PDCoV S1 and S1B fusion proteins. mFc-tagged PDCoV S1 and HCoV-229E control proteins specifically interacted with porcine and human APN. PDCoV S1B showed clear binding to hAPN and gAPN. gAPN was higher relative to pAPN, suggesting differences in affinity. two of these domains are known to be targeted by the S1 subunits of other CoV species. cell surface expression of the constructed APN chimeras was confirmed via staining by control CoV S1 proteins (Fig. 5B) or via detection of the C-terminally added HA-tag. fAPN recognition by PDCoV S1B remained below the detection level after exchange with human domain IV. PDCoV S1B interacts with the catalytic domain of APN (domain II) cells were transfected with plasmids encoding human, feline or chimeric APN proteins. samples were stained with a donkey -mouse Cy5 conjugate (1:200) PDCoV can use an exceptional range of mammalian as well as avian APN molecules as an entry receptor in vitro.

PDCoV S1 and S1B domain bind to pAPN. HeLa cells mock-transfected or transfected with a plasmid encoding pAPN. equimolar amounts of PDCoV S1 or S1B proteins were incubated. pAPN is a functional Entry Receptor for PDCoV. PDCoV can replicate in swine testis (ST) cells with supplemental trypsin (23). pAPN is a functional entry receptor for PDCoV. constituted knockout cells were inoculated with PDCoV or TGEV at a MOI of 1. cells were fixed and permeabilized 16 hpi and stained using a PDCoV-specific antiserum or a TGEV-specific monoclonal antibody. infection levels are shown normalized to parental ST cell infection. pAPN can be employed by PDCoV S to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion. pAPN expression rendered HeLa and Vero cells susceptible to PDCoV infection at levels similar to those observed on ST cells. the presence of pAPN enhances production of infectious PDCoV particles. the integrity of the mutant cell line was confirmed by Western blotting. PDCoV infects cells of human and avian origin. the results were confirmed in an independent experiment. porcine (LLC-PK1, PKFA, ST, ST APNKO, SK6, PD5, and PK-15) cell lines with PDCoV or APN-dependent control viruses (TGEV or HCoV-229E) at a MOI = 2.0 for 1 h assessed infection levels by immunostaining. PDCoV S1- and S1B bind to HeLa cells overexpressing galline and human APN. equimolar amounts of PDCoV S1 and S1B fusion proteins were incubated with equimolar amounts of PDCoV S1 and S1B fusion proteins. coV S1B was tested in 96-well plates coated with ectodomains of hAPN and gAPN. PDCoV S1B displayed clear binding to hAPN and gAPN. no binding by either of the two proteins was observed to gAPN. PDCoV S1B binding to hAPN was lost upon exchange of domain II for the feline equivalent. fAPN recognition by PDCoV S1B remained below detection level after exchange with human domain IV. pAPN crystal structure determined by Santiago et al. (PDB ID code 5LDS) pAPN binding regions of HCoV-229E, TGEV, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) are indicated, as previously reported. PDCoV S1B interacts with the catalytic domain of APN (domain II) analysis by solid-phase binding assay showed that PDCoV recognizes this APN ortholog, albeit to a low level. expression of human or feline APN rendered cells susceptible to HCoV-229E infection. expression of porcine or feline APN enabled infection with TGEV. cells were inoculated with PDCoV, HCoV-229E, or TGEV at a MOI = 1 for 1 h. infection experiments were performed twice; pictures of a representative experiment were shown. PDCoV employs domain B of its S1 subunit to engage host APN as a receptor for cell entry. PDCoV infection appears to be restricted to the swine enteric tract (55), indicating factors other than receptor distribution play a role in CoV tissue tropism. PDCoV shares its APN receptor with several members of the Alphacoronavirus genus, including TGEV and HCoV-229E. PDCoV has access to cells of an exceptionally diverse range of species by binding to an interspecies conserved domain on APN. this resembles the situation for MERS-CoV, which recognizes its entry receptor DPP4 via a conserved binding site facilitating recurring zoonotic infections from its dromedary reservoir without the need for host receptor adaptation. pigs are the second largest livestock species (69) and acted as intermediate hosts for zoonotic viruses (70, 71), emphasizing the need for studying the zoonotic potential of the PDCoV and its surveillance in so far unappreciated potential reservoirs. nal anti-dsRNA (J2) was purchased from Scicons.
