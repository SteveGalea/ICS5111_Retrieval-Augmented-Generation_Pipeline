{"summary": "many of these rooms were eventually used in the management of patients infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus. many of these were eventually used in the management of patients infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus. two simplified, one-tenth scale (110) models were designed and constructed. all the dimensions of the models were taken from full-scale models. each tank was designed to accommodate single- and double-sliding doors. the movement controller chip was manually programmed to allow the figure and doors to move at realistic human walking speeds. the edges around the door module (including the door and surrounding wall partition) were carefully sealed, manually, with Vaseline\u00ae Petroleum Jelly (Unilever, London, UK) to prevent any leakage of food dye. a syringe catheter was used to mix the food dye carefully within the chamber to ensure a relatively uniform dye distribution. three cameras were used to obtain video images: a Nikon D7000 with a 28\u2013105 mm Nikkor AF lens in manual mode (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY), at 24 frames per second (fps) a larger clearance in front of the figure was required for the hinged. a different door module was inserted and the edges sealed with Vaseline\u00ae. the tank was drained of water (now coloured with food dye) and cleaned. water-tank models were designed and constructed, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 (CYS Engineering & Trading, Singapore) the scale models were taken from full-scale models that were being constructed at the same time by collaborators at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH), and their collaborators. images taken just before the addition of the colored food dye to one of the chambers in the experimental water-tank. one tank was designed to accommodate single- and double-sliding doors, the other single- and double-hinged doors, as the door-opening mechanisms were significantly different for these two types of doors. the tank was full, to allow any air bubbles to escape through small drainage air-holes that were drilled into the roof along its edge. any remaining bubbles were manually suctioned using a 30 ml or 50 ml syringe and small-bore catheter that was passed through these air-holes. the tank was back-lit using a lighting rig that consisted of a bank of 18 spotlights arranged in a 3-row by 6-column grid the figure would accelerate almost instantly to its designated scaled-down walking speed, slide towards the door. it would then stop just before the door to allow it to open, before passing through the doorway to enter the room. the doors would then close behind it, completing the programmed movement cycle. the kinematic viscosities of water at 20\u00b0C and air at 25\u00b0C are 1.004106 m2/s and 15.6106 m2/s respectively. for the hinged-doors in air and water, their equivalent linear velocities must also scale as Uair/Uwater = Lair\"air/Lwater\"water = 1.55, so that the ratio of the angular velocities are related as\"air = 0.155\"water, or\"air/\"water = doors, both slow (Table 1, Videos S3\u2013S4) and fast (Table 2, Figures 5 and 6) angular velocities were investigated. the effect of these door-opening motions on the movements of the food dye were much more dramatic. the fast parameters were approximately twice those of the slow parameters. single-hinged door - slow 0.58 (0.89) \u2013 98.2 (15.22) double-hinged door - slow V1* = 0.35 (0.55) V2* = 0.25 (0.39) \u2013 86.4 (13.4) similar to single-hinged door, but with larger volume effluxes. double-sliding door snapshots were taken with respect to the following events, rather than at specific times: food dye movement due to door-opening motions alone then with any initial manikin movement \u2013 manikin interaction and any entrainment food dye movements once the manikin had come to rest at its destination position. single-hinged door(out of room) - fast 0.77 (1.19) 184.68 (28.63) double-hinged door(out of room) - fast 0.71 (1.1) V2* = 0.88 (1.36) 163.07 (25.28) all movement parameters are shown in Table 2 for these double-hinged door \u2018fast\u2019 scenarios. A. Manikin moving into the isolation room (seen from outside, V1 = 0.79 in water (1.22 in air) m/s, angular velocity = 184.68 in water (28.63 in air) deg/s. kin moving into the isolation room (seen from inside), V2 = 0.88 in water (1.36 in air) m/s, angular velocity = 163.1 in water (25.3 in air) deg/s. kin moving out of the isolation room (seen from inside), V = 0.73 in water (1.14 in air) m/s; angular velocity = 163.1 in water (25.3 in air) deg/s. study used tracer gas (SF6) and measured how its concentration changed when a technician exited the isolation room into an adjoining anteroom and then the outside corridor. the results showed that the concentration of the tracer gas decreased dramatically, as measured by a \u2018dilution factor\u2019 that was defined by the authors. however, the types of doors used for the isolation and anterooms (i.e. hinged or sliding) were not described, though it was probably a hinged door design. a severe case of adult chickenpox (i.e. primary varicella zoster virus, VZV, infection) managed in a negative pressure isolation room (with no anteroom) caused an infection of a non-immune nurse whose only contact with the patient was when he stood outside the room for at least 2 minutes, several times a day, handing supplies to the patient. study extends this model and tests double and sliding-door options. it suggests an adult of 1.7 m height, 0.3 m width and 0.15 m depth walking through the doorway produces an air volume flux of 255 L/s, with an attached wake of 76\u2013230 L/s. this suggests that a human body wake may be as much as that produced the motion of a single hinged-door. the manikin movement through the doorway did induce the escape of particle tracers to the outside of the room. this phenomenon is also confirmed in this study \u2013 the movement of the human figure through the doorway does induce some backflow/backwash of food dye out of the room. study shows sliding doors induce much less airflow across the doorway than hinged-doors. single-doors cause less disturbance than double-doors. the movement of a single healthcare worker through the doorway induces additional airflow. study examined the number of viable bacteria found on hospital door handles in high traffic areas in a tertiary referral hospital in the uk. the traditional lever-style handles were the most highly contaminated. however, in most cases when sliding doors are installed, they are often controlled by automated detection systems. the doors were programmed to open in various combinations involving the moving manikin (simulating a healthcare worker) entering/leaving the isolation room. details of the movement parameters used for the door and manikin motions are included within the video. no simulated ventilation was present in these baseline experiments."}
