{"summary": "innate immune response and subsequent inflammatory reaction rely on evolutionarily conserved receptors termed pattern-recognition receptors. receptors can be expressed at the cellular membrane (Toll-like receptors) 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6), in acidic endosomes (TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9) or in the cytoplasmic compartment (the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated kinase) the TRAF family is composed of seven members, TRAF1 through TRAF7. they all share a C-terminal TRAF domain, which mediates self-association and interaction with receptors or signalling proteins. all mammalian TRAFs localize to the cytoplasm except TRAF4. a model was then proposed in which TRADD simultaneously organizes FADD and RIP1-mediated NF-B signalling on one hand and TRAF3- and TANK-mediated IRF-3 signalling on the other. this possible mechanism of action requires further investigation to determine how TRAF3 is recruited to the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS upon viral infection. p115 and sec16A may exert a similar function through the ER-to-Golgi transport compartments. overexpression of p115 or sec16A increased the type I IFN response. their knockdown impaired the induction of antiviral genes. p115 and sec16A are new scaffold proteins involved in the establishment of the antiviral state. p115 and p115, two proteins involved in ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking, were found to associate with TRAF3 immunocomplexes with a high confidence. hek293 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-TRAF3 or pcDNA3-FLAG alone. p115 to EGFP-Sec16A and (F) Myc-TRAF3 to FLAG-p115 were coexpressed in 293T cells. the interactions between FLAG-TRAF3 and myc-p115 or EGFP-Sec16A were clearly detected. TRAF3 localizes to the ER-to-Golgi transport compartments and behaves like a cis-Golgi matrix protein. only Myc-p115 was found to be enriched in FLAG-TRAF3 immunocomplexes. p115 is known to colocalize to the NH2 terminus of the cis-Golgi protein GM130. cellular localization of FLAG-p115 can be visualized with the conventional ERGIC marker, ERGIC53. no significant colocalization was detected between TRAF3 and the ER marker calnexin (Figure 2A, panel 6), the lysosomal compartments and the mitochondrial network (Figure 2A, panel 8). cells were stained for endogenous TRAF3 and GM130 (panel 1) or endogenous TRAF3 and ERGIC53 (panel 2) before analysis via confocal microscopy. the nuclei were stained utilizing DAPI. bars represent 5 m. microtubule depolymerization is known to result in the reorganization of the Golgi complex into characteristic mini-stacks. however, FLAG-TRAF3 was detected to colocalize with GM130 and p115 in cells treated with nocodazole. results from our pharmacological experiments and confocal microscopy strongly suggest that TRAF3 localized to ER-to-Golgi transport compartments. coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells revealed that immunocomplexes containing p115 are detected only with full length TRAF3. a strong interaction was detected between FLAG-TRAF3 Y440/Q442A and Myc-p115 or EGFP-Sec16A. one of three independent experiments with similar results is shown. co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing the association of EGFP-Sec16A and Myc-p115 to FLAG-TRAF3 deletion mutants when coexpressed in 293T cells. arrows indicate the relocalization and the colocalization of the Golgi apparatus with TRAF3 upon treatment. similar observations were made in cells infected with RIG-I inducers, Sendai virus (SeV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza virus. p115 and sec16A associate with TRAF3 following cytosolic RNA and DNA sensor activation. whole-cell lysates (HeLa cells) were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays using TRAF3 (H-20) antibody followed by immunoblotting for the presence of p115, Sec16A, TBK1 and TRAF3. GM130 positive punctae do not colocalize with TRAF3. the majority of these punctae do not colocalize with TRAF3. this effect was severely compromised by reducing the expression level of sec16A or p115. p115 and sec16A were silenced in HeLa cells as described in (A) and infected with SeV for indicated periods of time. immunoblot analysis against p115, Sec16A, TRAF3 and seV proteins are also shown. Hec1B cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-IFN (250 ng) for 24 h and infected with SeV (200 HAU/ml) for 16 h. luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-IFN (250 ng), empty vector or MAVS or TRIF (25 ng) along with indicated plasmids (250 ng) for 24 Sec16A and p115 influence the type I IFN antiviral response. the results suggest a role for the ER-to-Golgi compartment in the type I IFN antiviral response. we overexpressed both proteins in Hec1B cells and assessed NF-B and IRF-3 transcription factor activation. p115 and sec16A positively participate in a type I IFN response. p115 and sec16A influence the type I IFN antiviral response at the transcriptional level. data are expressed as fold-induction following SeV infection (16 h) over the corresponding non-infected condition. one of three independent experiments with similar results is shown. p115 and sec16A were expected to blunt TRAF3-dependent transcriptional activation. transfection of increasing amounts of p115 or Sec16A effectively blunted TRIF-, RIG-I-, and MAVS-induced IFN promoter activation. the phosphorylation state of IRF-3 and the expression of ISG54 were readily observed upon seV infection. the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and the expression of ISG54 were readily observed upon seV infection. the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and the expression of ISG54 were readily observed upon seV infection. RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-qPCR using primers for ifn, ifit1, oas1. data are means +/ S.D. (n = 3); * Significantly below the induction response. stringent statistical filtering was performed using SAINT. proteins detected with AvgP0.7 were manually inspected for frequency of detection across a database of 1000 AP/MS analyses. p115 and sec16A were found to associate with TRAF3 immunocomplexes with a high confidence. co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed the association of Myc-p115 to EGFP-Sec16A and (F) Myc-TRAF3 to FLAG-p115 when coexpressed in 293T cells. the interactions between FLAG-TRAF3 and Myc-p115 or EGFP-Sec16A were clearly detected. the TRAF3 interactome network identified by functional proteomics suggests the presence of at least a fraction of TRAF3 in close proximity to the Golgi network. only Myc-p115 was found to be enriched in FLAG-TRAF3 immunocomplexes. FLAG-TRAF3 localizes to the ER-to-Golgi transport compartments and behaves like a cis-Golgi protein. no significant colocalization was detected between TRAF3 and the ER marker calnexin (Figure 2A, panel 6), the lysosomal compartments (Figure 2A, panel 7) and the mitochondrial network. EGFP-Sec16A and calnexin (panel 1), EGFP-Sec16A and FLAG-p115 (panel 2), EGFP-Sec16A and FLAG-TRAF3 (panel 3) and FLAG-TRAF3 and endogenous Sec16A (panel 4). a colocalization of FLAG-TRAF3 with endogenous Sec16A at ERES distributed in the cytoplasm could be observed. endogenous staining of TRAF3 revealed that the majority of TRAF3 proteins localized to the juxtanuclear region containing both the cis-Golgi marker GM130 and the ERGIC marker ERGIC53. microtubule depolymerization is known to result in the reorganization of the Golgi complex into characteristic mini-stacks, which appear as punctate structures throughout the cell. molecule lacking its N-terminal RING or the C-terminal TRAF domain lacks antiviral activity. removal of the N-terminal Ring Finger domain resulted in TRAF3 molecules that no longer colocalize with the Golgi marker GM130. coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells revealed that immunocomplexes containing p115 are detected only with full length TRAF3. co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing the association of EGFP-Sec16A and Myc-p115 to FLAG-TRAF3 deletion mutants when coexpressed in 293T cells. the bottom panel is a linear representation of TRAF3 deletion mutants and their capacity to interact with p115. intracellular delivery of poly I:C or dsDNA mimicry agent poly dA:dT resulted in disorganization of the ribbon-like structure of the Golgi apparatus. similar observations were made in cells infected with RIG-I inducers, Sendai virus (SeV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza virus. p115 and p115 were enriched with p115 and sec16A. the induced association of TBK1 with TRAF3 closely mirrored the presence of p115 and sec16A. p115 and sec16A are required for the proper positioning of TRAF3. reducing the expression level of Sec16A or p115 led to a drastic disorganisation of the Golgi paralleled by a relocalization of TRAF3. however, the majority of these GM130 positive punctae do not colocalize with TRAF3. this effect was severely compromised by reducing the expression level of Sec16A or p115. nM siRNA duplexes that specifically target Sec16A (panels 3 and 4) or p115 (panels 5 and 6) stained for MAVS and endogenous TRAF3 upon no treatment (panels 1, 3 and 5) or SeV infection (200 HAU/ml) for 4 h. one of three independent experiments with similar results is shown. the ability of the TRAF3-AKKFF mutant to mediate TRAF3-dependent synergistic activation of the IFN promoter was drastically reduced. the ability of the TRAF3-AKKFF mutant to mediate TRAF3-dependent synergistic activation of the IFN promoter was drastically reduced. extracts from transfected Hec1B cells were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using indicated antibodies. the results suggest a role for the ER-to-Golgi compartment in the type I IFN antiviral response. sec16A and p115 influence the type I IFN antiviral response at the transcriptional level. the enhanced promoter activation was entirely dependent on the presence of TRAF3. p115 and sec16A positively participate in a TRAF3-dependent type I IFN response. p115 and sec16A influence the type I IFN antiviral response at the transcriptional level. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were left uninfected or infected with SeV (200 HAU/ml) for 16 h. relative luciferase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods. one of three independent experiments with similar results is shown. the ER-to-Golgi compartment plays upstream of IRF-3 in type I IFN signalling. loss-of-function experiments were conducted to further confirm the implication of p115 and sec16A in the type I IFN response. cells were left untreated (Ctl) or stimulated with poly I:C (2.5 g/ml), poly dA:dT (1 g/ml) or SeV (200 HAU/ml) for 6 h to 8 h. RNA was extracted and analysed by RT-qPCR using primers for ifn, ifit1, oas1. TRAF3 conceivably has the capacity to associate with endosomal compartments enriched in TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 receptors. however, how TRAF3 associates with MAVS upon RLH activation remains unanswered. sec16A and p115 are found in immunocomplexes containing TRAF3, but not TRAF2 or TRAF6. inactivation of TRAF3 by deletion of its N-terminal RING finger domain and the C-terminal TRAF domain displaces TRAF3 from the ER-Golgi transport compartments. peptide impairs TRAF3 recruitment to the cis-Golgi and diminishes the type I IFN response. sec16A or p115 also increases TRIF-mediated IFN promoter activation, reinforcing the role for the ER-to-Golgi vesicular compartment in TLR3 and TLR4 signalling. in response to DNA virus infection, it traffics from the ER to the cis-Golgi apparatus. the ER-to-Golgi transport compartment seems to also host several proteins involved in type I IFN signalling. how these proteins cooperate with TRAF3 at the ER-to-Golgi transport compartments is currently unclear and will be the objective of future studies. plus-stranded RNA viruses have the ability to induce cytoplasmic membrane rearrangements that facilitate their replication. poliovirus-infected cells accumulate membranous vesicles derived from COPII vesicles [65]. the precise role for this internal membrane rearrangement in the virus propagation and virus-host interaction requires further investigation. mitofusin 2 was shown to inhibit RLH pathway signalling by interacting with the C-terminal of MAVS. signalling at the Golgi apparatus and endosomes has been observed for different types of membrane-bound receptors. the anti-GFP (monoclonal 1218) antibody and the polyclonal goat anti-GFP antibody were obtained from ABCAM (Cambridge, MA) and US Biological (Swampscott, MA) the polyclonal anti-Sec16A and p115 antibodies were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories and Santa Cruz. the pFLAG-TRAF3 mutant with C-terminal retention motif AKKFF was generated by PCR and subcloned in pCDNA3.1 (+) and pMRX-ires-puro. poly I:C was transfected with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) at final concentrations of 1.0 to 2.5 g/ml.
