{"summary": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is one of the most refractory of all lung diseases lacking effective therapy. acute exacerbation is defined as clinically significant deterioration of unidentifiable cause. etiology of acute exacerbation of IPF has yet to be elucidated. the contribution of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF has not been determined yet. we previously reported the heterogeneous remodeling of CD34-positive alveolar capillaries in the lungs of patients with IPF [15] the alveolar capillaries were decreased in fibrotic lesions, but increased in nonfibrotic alveolar septa around the fibrotic lesions. the surgical biopsies of ten patients with stable IPF and the autopsied lungs of eight patients with IPF who died after acute exacerbation were obtained at Tohoku University Hospital. the disease-free lung tissues autopsied from three patients without any chronic lung diseases were also examined as controls. each BALF sample was subjected to virus isolation by the microplate method [21] at the Virus Research Center at the National Hospital Organization (Sendai, JAPAN) the supernatant fraction was inoculated into cultured cells of human embryonic fibroblasts. monoclonal antibodies against human HMGB1 (1 : 3,000, Shino-test), thrombomodulin (TM1009, 1 : 100, Nichirei Co., Tokyo, Japan) and antihuman von Willebrand factor factor (vWF) monoclonal antibody (F8/86, 1 : 1,000, Nichirei) were incubated with a primary antibody in a moist chamber at 4\u00b0C for overnight and were further reacted with a the percentages of the distribution area of the cells immunoreactive for thrombomodulin among those immunoreactive for CD34 were estimated from 30 randomly selected color images. a significant difference was defined as P.05. All values were represented as the means SEM. pooled data of the HMGB1 concentration in 16 samples from 7 patients showed a gradual increase of HMGB1 after acute exacerbation. only HMGB1 was increased in positive correlation with HMGB1. inflammatory mediators in the BALF of IPF patients after acute exacerbation. yncytial virus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, coronavirus, mumps virus, or metapneumovirus. immunohistochemical expression of HMGB1 in the lung tissues of 18 patients with IPF was compared between two patient groups. in the autopsied lung tissues, intense cytoplasmic staining for in the surgical lung biopsies of patients with stable IPF, 33.3 5.6% of the cells were positive for HMGB1 without a significant difference compared with the autopsies. most of these cells with HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the case of the surgical biopsies exhibited nuclear staining. the cells producing MCP-1 coincided with the cells having cytoplasmic HMGB1 expression. the intense expression of RAGE was chiefly observed in epithelial cells and to a lesser extent in capillary endothelial cells. othelial expression of thrombomodulin was apparently decreased in the autopsied lung tissues of IPF patients after acute exacerbation. no significant difference was found between stable IPF patients and normal controls in terms of thrombomodulin reactivity against CD34. the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was serially sampled two to four times after acute exacerbation from each IPF patient (n = 8) none of these patients were mechanically ventilated during the treatment. we measured the concentrations of HMGB1 and 18 other inflammatory cytokines. HMGB1 and MCP-1 continued increasing even after steroid therapy. a 69-year-old male had been followed up without immunosuppressive therapy against acute exacerbation before administration to the hospital. no mechanical ventilator was used for treatment; he died 5 months later. the pooled data of the HMGB1 concentration in 16 BALF samples obtained from 7 patients showed a gradual increase of HMGB1 even after the steroid therapy for acute exacerbation. double immunostaining for HMGB1 and CD34, a marker of alveolar capillary endothelial cells, clearly revealed the distribution of these cells. in contrast, only nuclear staining for HMGB1 was observed in the surgical lung biopsies of the patients with stable IPF. in the surgical biopsies of patients with stable IPF, 33.3 5.6% of the cells were positive for HMGB1 without a significant difference compared with the autopsies. however, most of these cells with HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the case of the surgical biopsies exhibited nuclear staining. the cells immunoreactive for HMGB1 (a) and MCP-1 (b) in the consecutive sections of the autopsied lung tissues of IPF patients who died after acute exacerbation (bars = 100 m) the intense immunoreactivity of RAGE, the receptor of HMGB1, was observed in type I alveolar epithelial cells in these lungs (c), bar = 100 m; (d), bar = 10 m. no significant difference was found between stable IPF patients and normal controls in terms of thrombomodulin reactivity against CD34. the lung tissues which were surgically biopsied from a patient with stable IPF were double immunostained for HMGB1 (in brown) and CD34 (in red) (a) the consecutive sections were stained for HMGB1 (in brown) and thrombomodulin (in red) (bars = 100 m) the gradual increase of HMGB1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after acute exacerbation suggests several plausible roles in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF. the concentration of HMGB1 was low at the initial onset of acute exacerbation, because the concentration of HMGB1 was low at the initial onset of acute exacerbation. the loss of RAGE contributes to pulmonary fibrosis [31], the increase of HMGB1 in alveolar fluids itself may induce fibrogenesis through other HMGB1 receptors. the gradual increase of MCP-1 in positive correlation with HMGB1 may also contribute to fibroproliferation [34, 35], which is thought to be involved in the regenerative effects of HMGB1. HMGB1 and MCP-1 are increased in the lungs of IPF patients after acute exacerbation. decreased expression of thrombomodulin, an intrinsic inhibitor of HMGB1, may exacerbate alveolar damage and fibrogenesis."}
