{"summary": "MARV Angola (MARV), Ebola virus Makona-WPGC07 and Kikwit 95 (EBOV), TAFV, RESTV Reston08-A, SUDV, and BDBV were used in the growth kinetics experiments. cell lines were cultured as described elsewhere and included hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) kidney cells. all cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates and infected for 1 hour. supernatants were sampled at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after inoculation. cell viability measured by determining number of viable cells during multiple passages at 3 temperature conditions. cell lines were cultured as described elsewhere. cell lines included hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) kidney cells. all cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates and infected for 1 hour. supernatants were sampled at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after inoculation. cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus. cell viability measured by determining number of viable cells during multiple passages at 3 temperature conditions. BDBV replicated on all bat cell lines at 96 hours after inoculation. MARV, 9.9 106 TCID50/mL (HypNi/1.1) and 1.36 105 TCID50/mL (AJ). vero end titers at 1.36 107 TCID50/mL (EpoNi/22.1) and 7.48 106 TCID50/mL (AJ) a virus Makona-WPGC07 and MARV replication kinetics were assessed on additional bat cells lines, EFK, RE05, and Tb-lu-1. end-point titers varied between 4.89 106 log10TCID50/mL (HypNi/1.1) and 2.47 104 log10TCID50/mL (Tb-lu-1) with Vero end titers at 2.47 106 log10TCID50/ titers determined by end-point titration in quadruplicate in vero E6 cells. stars indicate complete cytopathic effect and loss of cell adherence. there was no significant difference in live cell count for HypNi/1.1 between 37\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C/41\u00b0C. however, there was a significant difference in live cell count at 41\u00b0C by 96 hours, with the mean percentage of live cells declining to below 20% by 72 hours. replication kinetics of Ebola virus Makona-WPGC07 and MARV were determined under 3 temperature conditions. MARV reached end-point titers of 1.25 106 log10TCID50/mL at 37\u00b0C, 1.11 106 log10TCID50/mL at 37\u00b0C/41\u00b0C. no significant differences in end-point titers by temperature were observed with MARV. MARV, EBOV Kikwit 95, TAFV, RESTV, SUDV, and BDBV replicated on all bat cell lines. end-point titers at 96 hours after inoculation varied as follows. TCID50/mL (EpoNi/22.1) and 6.31 102 TCID50/mL (AJ) were assessed on additional bat cells lines. Ebola virus Makona-WPGC07 and MARV replication kinetics were assessed on additional bat cells lines, EFK, RE05, and Tb-lu-1. supernatants harvested at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after inoculation. stars indicate complete cytopathic effect and loss of cell adherence. geometric mean titers were calculated from 3 independent experiments. there was no significant difference in live cell count for REO5 between 37\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C/41\u00b0C. however, there was a significant difference in live cell count at 41\u00b0C by 96 hours. a statistically significant difference in end-point titer was detected between 37\u00b0C and 41\u00b0C. MARV reached end-point titers of 1.25 106 log10TCID50/mL at 37\u00b0C, 1.11 106 log10TCID50/mL at 37\u00b0C/41\u00b0C, and 1.03 106 log10TCID50/mL at 41\u00b0C on RE05. no significant differences in end-point titers by temperature were observed with MARV. EBOV Makona-WPGC07, EBOV Kikwit 95, TAFV, RESTV, SUDV, and BDBV replicated efficiently in cells derived from Egyptian fruit bats. inability of EBOV to replicate in cells originating from straw-colored fruit bats is due to an inability of the EBOV glycoprotein to bind to the endosomal receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 [29]. researchers have long speculated about the ability of bats to harbor extremely lethal viruses for humans without apparent morbidity and mortality. a side effect of adaption to flight involves changes in metabolic rate, immune response, and body temperature, all of which can affect viral infection."}
