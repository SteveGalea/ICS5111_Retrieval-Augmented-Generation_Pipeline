{"summary": "peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) were soon identified as enzymes catalyzing protein folding step at peptidyl bonds preceding proline residues. intense searches revealed that PPIases are a superfamily of proteins consisting of three structurally distinguishable families with representatives in every described species of prokaryote and eukaryote. reports on solely PPIase-dependent biological roles remain virulence factors are highly specialized determinants shaped by the adaptation of the pathogen to its host niche, e.g., toxins, secretion systems, and their effectors or receptor binding proteins. some others, such as hydrolases, transporters, or chelators, are more general in their biological function and distribution among pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. the free energy difference between the trans conformer of a peptidyl-prolyl bond and its cis isomer is about 0.5 kcal/mol. this causes peptidyl-prolyl bonds to slow down protein dynamics by a factor of 100 during folding and denaturation (2). the effect of peptidyl-prolyl isomerization on folding could be observed in small peptides. a small protein of approximately 10 kDa was discovered and named parvulin (18\u201320) it was later shown that parvulins can be inhibited by the small 1,4-naphthoquinone derivative juglone (21). despite their clear-cut enzymatic activity, their cellular and physiological functions remain enigmatic. in vitro or in vivo observable phenotypes of mutants and PPIase-protein interactions seem to be independent of the enzymatic property. deletion of the PPIase domain or diminishment of its activity by amino acid substitutions had no or little impact on protein-protein interactions and chaperoning activities. however, many reported deletion mutants show no or very subtle phenotypic changes under laboratory conditions. the amino acid preceding the proline (i.e., position P1) is often crucial for the enzymatic activity and selectivity. the bacterial homolog Mip of Legionella pneumophila lacks the preference for leucine and can isomerize peptides with a lysine residue at P1 comparably well. a novel type of PPIase (FCBP) which contains an FKBP and a cyclophilin domain was also discovered in protozoan parasites. a novel type of PPIase (FCBP) which contains an FKBP and a cyclophilin domain was also discovered in protozoan parasites. in eukaryotes, PPIases are located in the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in bacteria, PPIases can be divided roughly into soluble and membrane-bound subgroups. soluble PPIases are either cytosolic or, in Gram-negative bacteria, periplasmic (47) ER-resident protein FKBP65 is highly expressed during embryonic development. expression ceases during adulthood but increases after lung injury. many FKBPs were later found to be expressed at much higher degrees in brain tissue, with neuroprotective or neuroregenerative properties. smallest representatives of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, e.g., the 12-kDa hFKBP12, the 18-kDa human CypA protein, and the 10-kDa parvulin from Escherichia coli, reveal only a single PPIase domain. most common among these are tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), which contribute to the assembly of multiprotein complexes by mediating protein- hFKBP12 lost its specificity for leucine or phenyalanine residues on P1. it was able to isomerize Lys-Pro, Ala-Pro, and Glu-Pro bonds equally well. the same observation could be made even when chaperone domains of unrelated proteins were used. several PPIases are upregulated by stress factors, such as heat or cold shock, due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins under these conditions. in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, several PPIases are upregulated by stress factors, such as heat or cold shock, due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins under these conditions. research on bacterial PPIases concentrated more on protein folding during translation and secretion. in eukaryotic systems, much research has been done to identify interaction partners within signal transduction pathways where PPIases seem to play pivotal roles. pA (PDB entry 1Q6U) shows the characteristic -helix wrapped by a five-stranded -sheet. the space between the helix and the -sheet forms the enzymatically active hydrophobic pocket. representatives of all three families can be found to different extent in bacteria. TF is a modular protein with a central FKBP domain flanked by an N-terminal ribosome binding domain with chaperone activity and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. it associates with ribosomes via its N-terminal domain, in a 1:1 ratio, whereby the association with nascent peptides lasts longer than the association with ribosomes. the periplasmic PPIase SlyD of Gram-negative bacteria consists of an N-terminal PPIase domain and a C-terminal nickel binding domain. in E. coli, SlyD mutations confer resistance toward the phage X174. in coli, SlyD is also involved in the maturation of nickel-containing hydrogenases independently of its PPIase activity. the periplasmic parvulin domain is devoid of PPIase activity. it is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane facing outside. in e. coli and many Gram-negative bacteria, there is also a second periplasmic parvulin. the first characterized protozoan PPIases were cyclophilins of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum (95\u201397). apicomplexans possess large numbers of cyclophilins (from 7 in Cryptosporidium to 15 in Toxoplasma), which are diverse in their cellular localization and domain composition (41). 8 of the 11 putative cyclophilins and cyclophilin-like proteins of P. falciparum were analyzed after recombinant production. only two of those, P. falciparum Cyp19A (PfCyp19A) and PfCyp19B, displayed in vitro PPIase activity, while all had chaperone functions preventing thermal aggregation of the model protein substrates rhodanese and citrate a possible explanation is that additional secreted TgCyp18-specific substrates of T. gondii contribute to the induction of IL-12 production by dendritic cells. a similar immunomodulatory effect was also observed in the case of a secreted 19-kDa cyclophilin of the coccidian parasite Neospora caninum. the first group is the small apicomplexan-specific cyclophilins. they appear to be present in all genera except Cryptosporidium (41) but their monophylogeny is still questionable. all identified representatives are predicted to be cytoplasmic, except for TgCyp38. localizationa Additional domain(s) and function(s)b Small apicomplexan-specific cyclophilins B. bovis BbCyp28.6 (5477723) Cytoplasm C-terminal extension with no known homology P. falciparum PfCyp26.4 (811077) Cytoplasm ND T. gondii TgCyp31.8 (052840) Apicoplast N-terminal apicoplast localization signal Plasmod the smallest representative in T. cruzi, Cyp19, and its homolog in other Tryponosoma species, CypA, have been expressed recombinantly and characterized enzymatically. the main cyclophilin is the homolog of CypA and has a molecular mass of approximately 18 kDa. the parasites are extracellularly more resistant to CsA than others. the number of identified and analyzed FKBPs and parvulins in protozoan parasites is small. the only FKBPs analyzed in detail are PfFKBP35 of P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax FKBP35 (PvFKBP35) the first identified parvulin-like protein was an immunodominant antigen of T. gondii, TgMIC5, which was localized in the secretory organelle (microneme) of the infectious tachyzoites (121). besides that protein, TcPin1 and TcPar45 of T. cruzi are the only parvulins described for protozoan parasites (124\u2013127). RNAi knockdowns of TcPar45 and TbPar42 resulted in growth defects in procyclic parasites (125, 127) a preference for peptides containing phosphorylated serine or threonine residues preceding the target proline could be proven, which is also known for other parvulins (127, 128) in cyclophilins, an eight-stranded antiparallel -barrel is flanked by an -helix on each side. in parvulins, the -sheet core is surrounded by four -helices. the space between the helix and the -sheet forms the enzymatically active hydrophobic pocket. ases in E. coli, i.e., FkpA, PpiA, and FklB, are periplasmic leads to the assumption that in Gram-negative bacteria the presence of the outer membrane and the additional compartment requires a larger repertoire of accessory folding proteins. even the free-living bacterium with the smallest genome, Mycoplasma genitalium, possesses TF (69). the association with nascent peptides lasts longer than the association with ribosomes. nascent polypeptides exit the ribosomes unfolded, with great accessibility of isomerization-prone peptidyl-prolyl bonds. however, this property was not dependent on the enzymatic activity. SurA is a periplasmic protein central to the transport into and correct assembly of many -barrel proteins in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. it has a modular structure with one or two parvulin domains, among which only the C-terminal one has enzymatic activity. however, the PPIase domain is very often negligible for in vivo activity. cyclophilins of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum are the first characterized protozoan PPIases. the first characterized protozoan PPIases were cyclophilins of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum (95\u201397). apicomplexans possess large numbers of cyclophilins, which are diverse in their localization and domain composition (41) cyclophilin-like proteins of P. falciparum and T. gondii have the most complicated infection cycles. this diversity is far from being explored to its fullest extent. it can be speculated that the occurrence of additional cyclophilins may reflect the complexity of the corresponding life cycle. induction was due to the interaction of TgCyp18 with chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). binding to CCR5 was independent of the PPIase activity. mutants with diminished PPIase activity failed to induce IL-12 production by dendritic cells. three different groups of cyclophilins, as identified by Kr\u00fccken et al. (41), may be extremely interesting for future antiparasitic therapy strategies. the first group is the small apicomplexan-specific cyclophilins, which seem to be present in all genera except Cryptosporidium (41) the third group contains Plasmodium-specific large cyclophilins with multiple nuclear localization signals and coiled-coil protein interaction domains. single representatives of this group were identified in P. falciparum and its close relative Plasmodium yoelii (41). trypanosoma cruzi, whose genome encodes 15 paralogs of this family, encodes 15 paralogs in the mass range of 19 to 110 kDa. the sequence diversity of the remaining seven genes was too high, preventing a solid classification. ishmania donovani is the pathogen causing visceral leishmaniasis. the unusually low cytosolic concentration of LdCyp (LdCyp) is thought to be a reason for increased CsA tolerance. biological functions appointed to LdCyp include the disaggregation and reactivation of adenosine kinase. no strong colocalization of FKBP35 with calcineurin could be observed in cells. in the ring stage it is localized mainly to the cytosol. in the trophozoite and schizont stages it is translocated into the nucleus. pin1 is localized in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. a preference for peptides containing phosphorylated serine or threonine residues preceding the target proline could be proven, which is also known for other parvulins. the involvement of SurA in pathogenic processes was analyzed most extensively in the Enterobacteriaceae (83) SurA facilitates the correct assembly of many outer membrane proteins (OMPs), including outer membrane protein A (OmpA), type I pilus components, the maltose transporter (LamB) and the two siderophore receptors FhuA and FecA. yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes self-limiting gastrointestinal disorders. yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes self-limiting gastrointestinal disorders. deletion of surA causes defect in correct localization of IcsA. lyase PnlH is devoid of a -barrel structure typical for OMPs or an acylation signal. its targeting to the outer membrane was instead shown to be dependent on its highly hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence. the authors of that study showed that the chaperone activity of SurA is not restricted to -barrel proteins. the main adhesin of the betaproteobacterium Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough. it led to the identification of Par27, a novel type of parvulin, by affinity chromatography (146) it was shown that Par27 has PPIase and chaperone activities, which probably have pleiotropic effects on virulence. virulence in the complemented deletion strain (151) is astonishingly similar. for both mutants, adherence to epithelial and endothelial cells was significantly reduced. for both mutants, adherence to epithelial and endothelial cells was significantly reduced. the bacterium attempts to compensate for the loss of the chaperone activity of TF. several glycosyltransferase genes responsible for the production of glucans which mediate cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion were downregulated. a decrease in biofilm formation was observed when glucose was used as the sole carbon source. the deletion of TF negatively affected the tolerance of the bacterium toward heat and ethanol, as well as its persistence in the organs of infected mice. however, the exact mechanisms behind these phenotypes are still not known. a rather indirect contribution of TF is most likely (159) cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) can stimulate this transition rather than having an antiparasitic action. this transition is dependent on the presence of the secreted cyclophilin Cyp19 of the parasite (163). cyclophilins are the most prominent group of infection-related host PPIases. the most prominent group of infection-related host PPIases are, again, the cyclophilins. cyclophilins exert proinflammatory and chemotactic activities. no direct interaction between CD147 and LmCypA could be observed due to absence of heparin binding domains in this protein. the main focus of the research on host cyclophilins and infection certainly lies on viruses. the majority of the research points to an intracellular role of cyclophilins during viral infections. virus mimivirus encodes a cyclophilin without measurable PPIase activity that localizes to the surface of the mature virion. viral integrase catalyzes recombination of cDNA genome of the virus with the host genome. this bacterium transforms its host by translocating a nucleoprotein complex into the cytosol via its type IV secretion system. the complex consists of a single-stranded DNA and the covalently bound endonuclease VirD2. a distinct domain in VirD2 could be spotted as important for cyclophilin binding. systematic analysis conducted by using site-directed amino acid substitutions revealed that all four probable cyclophilin target sites with the consensus sequence Gly-Pro-Xaa-Leu are important for binding of ROC1 and subsequent activation (191). ROC1 serves as a molecular switch that isomerizes the prolines from trans to cis conformation and, by this, activates AvrRpt2 (191). arginine residues have a moderate effect on the PPIase activity of these proteins but efficiently inhibited the interaction with calcineurin. leukotoxin (LKT) of Mannheimia haemolytica is the causative agent of fibrinous and necrotizing pleuropneumonia in cattle. host CypD is a central regulator of mitochondrial integrity. it can influence the outcome of infections caused by intra- or extracellular pathogens. a protective effect of CsA on intoxication by the experimentally constructed chimeric toxin LFNDTA could be observed. botulinum, CDT of Clostridium difficile, and iota toxin of Clostridium perfringens were shown to be facilitated by host CypA (202) by using the C2I subunit of botulinum toxin in coprecipitation experiments. it was identified as a further PPIase capable of binding binary toxins and promoting their translocation into the cytosol. SurA facilitates the correct assembly of many outer membrane proteins (OMPs) including outer membrane protein A (OmpA), type I pilus components, the maltose transporter (LamB) and the two siderophore receptors FhuA and FecA. surA affects the expression of OMPs without influencing the amounts of secreted substrates of the type III secretion system, the main virulence determinant (142). in the enteropathogenic organism Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, SurA affects the expression of OMPs. the authors of the study showed that the chaperone activity of SurA is not restricted to -barrel proteins. one of these is HP0175, which was isolated from the culture supernatants of in vitro-grown Helicobacter pylori. this secreted PPIase is also one of the five immunodominant antigens detected in gastroduodenal ulcers (48) a homolog of Par27 was discovered in the periplasm of the epsilonproteobacterium and intestinal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. the functional homolog of SurA of Gram-negative bacteria is PrsA of Gram-positive bacteria, which is associated with the membrane. adherence to epithelial and endothelial cells was significantly reduced. the uptake by macrophages was increased, which resulted in a colonization deficiency in murine pneumonia models. for both mutants, adherence to epithelial and endothelial cells was significantly reduced. several glycosyltransferase genes responsible for the production of glucans were downregulated. a decrease in in vitro biofilm formation was observed when glucose was used as the sole carbon source. further virulence traits, such as genetic competence and acid and peroxide tolerance, suffered by the deletion of ropA (155). virulence-associated phenotypes of PPIases of parasitic protozoa are depicted. this is related to the fact that very few PPIases have been analyzed in detail. this is also related to the fact that very few PPIases have been analyzed in detail. cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) can stimulate this transition rather than having an antiparasitic action. this activation is dependent on the presence of the secreted cyclophilin Cyp19 of the parasite (163) the earliest observation of a cyclophilin in an infection-related process was made in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated LPS-stimulated macrophages. the earliest observation of a cyclophilin in an infection-related process was made in vivo inflammatory response and in vitro chemotactic activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. human CypA and CypB bind the capsid protein of HIV-1 (169) the majority of the research points to an intracellular role of cyclophilins during viral infections. in HIV-1, binding of CypA to three Gly-Pro sites, at amino acids 90, 157, and 224, could be seen. mimivirus, a parasite of free-living amoeba, encodes a cyclophilin without measurable PPIase activity. viral integrase catalyzes the recombination of the cDNA genome of the virus with the host genome. the viral integrase is first phosphorylated by the host kinase Jun N-terminal protein kinase. three Arabidopsis cyclophilins, CYPA, ROC1 and ROC4, were identified. a distinct domain in VirD2 could be spotted as important for cyclophilin binding. the interactions were sensitive to CsA treatment, which also inhibited the transformation of the host cells with the T complex. three of these sites surround the catalytic triad of Cys122, His208, and Asp226. ROC1 serves as a molecular switch that isomerizes the prolines from trans to cis conformation and, by this, activates AvrRpt2 (191). besides these nice studies, recent reports indicate that plant PPIases are crucial actors of plant immunity and infectious processes. mPTP is a core protein of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) mPTP is activated by mPTP in a PPIase-dependent way. this results in mitochondrial swelling, loss of membrane potential, and eventually, necrotic or apoptotic cell death. bacterial binary toxins consist of a receptor subunit which binds to host cells and triggers the uptake of the binary toxin complex into the host cell by endocytosis. the receptor domain is activated and forms a pore for the translocation of the enzymatically active subunit into the cytosol. this translocated subunit then modifies host proteins and exerts the actual toxic activity. in coprecipitation experiments, FKBP51 was identified as a further PPIase capable of binding binary toxins and promoting their translocation into the cytosol. it is certainly of major interest whether host PPIases facilitate the translocation of these proteins via their enzymatic activity or, rather, chaperone-like interaction. lamydia psittaci Mip-like protein Immunodominant in convalescent guinea pigs 212 Chlamydophila pneumoniae CpMip Failure of formation of inclusion bodies in presence of FK506 213 Coxiella burnetii CbMip Cross-reactive with polyclonal anti-Mip for LpMip 210 Legionella longbeachae LlMip Replication defect in localization not confirmed 223, 224 Xanthomonas campestris Mip Influences protease activity and exopolysaccharide production. smaller lesions on infected leafs 229, 230 Trypanosoma cruzi TcMip Secreted into the supernatant, involved in infection of HeLa cells 44, 232 Leishmania infantum Mip Secreted virulence factor 231 a Phenotypes of deletion several Mip-like PPIases were also identified in the obligate intracellular pathogens of the genera Chlamydia and Chlamydophila. the first reported among these, the Mip protein of Chlamydia trachomatis, is a lipoprotein which is mainly present on elementary bodies (215, 216) surface-exposed Mip-like proteins are also present in the important human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoea further Mip-like PPIases were characterized in the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the nosocomial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila, and the enteropathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. a deletion of the gene caused a significant reduction in the efficiency of bacteria to invade HeLa cells. the secretion of the virulence-associated autotransporter protease EspP of enterohemorrhagic E. coli is dependent mainly on SurA and the periplasmic chaperone/protease DegP. however, under heat shock conditions, part of the translocation process can be taken over by FkpA. mip of Legionella pneumophila The FKBP Mip was the first genetically identified virulence factor of L. pneumophila shown to be relevant for intracellular infection. deletion of the genetic locus harboring mip resulted in reduced intracellular replication rates in human macrophages and protozoa. the dimeric nature is probably decisive for in vivo action of Mip-like PPIases. a monomeric mutant exerted far less enzymatic activity in an RNase T1 folding assay (242). this helix confers Mip the flexibility it needs for binding different substrates as a dimer. a or human macrophages and blood monocytes as if wild-type mip had been used. either additional properties other than PPIase activity are important for Mip action during intracellular infection or the residual enzymatic activity of the mutant proteins was still sufficient for exerting PPIase-dependent phenotypes. the monomer retained enzymatic activity comparable to that of wild-type Mip in peptide folding assays. the impact of Mip on systemic infection could be demonstrated in guinea pigs. this also suggests a role for Mip in the extracellular virulence of L. pneumophila. P290 is completely localized on the surface, and hence ideally situated for interacting with Mip. as assessed by competitive binding to immobilized collagen IV and coprecipitation studies using rapamycin as an inhibitor, P290 binds to the active domain of Mip. ary and quaternary structures of the NC1 domains are not relevantly influenced by this interaction (247) the latter finding is comprehensible and again supports the idea that Mip acts primarily as an adhesin within the context of Legionella-ECM interaction. this is substantial for the targeted design of alternative treatments. ER membrane releases Ca2+ into the cytoplasm upon binding the messenger IP3. it is involved in regulation of autophagy in the model protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum (251, 254). the contribution of Mip to intracellular infection might be interference with the host autophagy machinery. mip-like PPIase of burkholderia pseudomallei (BpML1) is a saprophytic betaproteobacterium that is widely distributed in tropical habitats. the disease can progress acutely, remain chronic, or, in some cases, even be asymptomatic (260, 261) BpML1 influences several virulence-related traits, including resistance to low pH, survival in macrophage-like and epithelial cells, swarming due to flagellation, and extracellular protease activity. a mutant was significantly attenuated in a mouse infection model (261) mip of Legionella pneumophila The FKBP Mip was the first genetically identified virulence factor of L. pneumophila shown to be relevant for intracellular infection. mip is a 24-kDa basic protein which exists as a homodimer on the outer membranes of bacteria. the N-terminal domain is globular and facilitates dimerization via a methionine knot. this dimerization mechanism via the mirror image-like interaction of hydrophobic amino acid pairs is typical for dimeric bacterial PPIases. the dimeric nature is probably decisive for the in vivo action of Mip-like PPIases. monomer retained enzymatic activity comparable to that of wild-type Mip. but in protein folding experiments with denatured RCM-T1 as substrate, a significant loss in activity was observed. only the Tyr185Ala mutant with 1 to 2% PPIase activity failed to complement the mutant. a probable in vitro chaperone activity of Mip is dependent on dimerization via its N terminus as the major facilitator of interactions associated with protein folding. the impact of Mip on systemic infection could be demonstrated in guinea pigs, where Mip contributes to the dissemination of bacteria. a 13-mer peptide was identified with the help of a peptide array consisting of overlapping peptides resembling the complete sequences of the two most dominant isomers of collagen IV in human lung tissue, 1 and 2. in lung tissue, collagen IV is typically built with two 1 isomers and one 2 isomer. mip-NC1 interaction is positioned more in the periphery, hence questioning a PPIase action of Mip on P290 or collagen IV. this simulation showed that the Mip dimer is able to interact with two NC1 domains, via their P290 sequences within the trimeric NC1 complex. the tertiary and quaternary structures of NC1 are not relevantly influenced by this interaction (247) hFKBP12 binds the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) together with calcineurin, hFKBP12 also binds the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), forming a ternary complex and regulating its activity (249, 250) L. pneumophila has several type IV secretion system-dependent effectors that bind host phosphoinositides and actively participate in the host phosphoinositol metabolism. also, secreted phospholipases of L. pneumophila are active in the lung tissue, as shown for phospholipase A in the guinea pig infection model (259) BPSL0918 functions as a chaperone, with probable impacts on outer membrane integrity and stress tolerance. unlike Mip, BpML1 lacks the long -helix and the N-terminal dimerization domain. however, the PPIase domains of both proteins reveal 40% identity. the researchers were able to observe pronounced flexibility of the crucial active side residues Asp44 and Tyr89. this was not obvious in a crystal structure of hFKBP12 with 0.92- resolution. the rest of the ligand-binding residues remained in one conformation. globular domain facilitates dimerization via a methionine knot in which Met38 and Met42 of one monomer interact with Met42 and Met38 of the other monomer. the dimerization mechanism is typical for dimeric bacterial PPIases and is repeated as a leu-Val knot in FkpA of E. coli and a Val-Leu knot in FKBP22 of Shewanella sp. SIB1. the same variants of mip were used to complement mip mutants. they behaved in infection studies of amoeba or human macrophages and blood monocytes. either additional properties other than PPIase activity are important for Mip action during intracellular infection. the impact of Mip on systemic infection could be demonstrated in guinea pigs. in the extracellular milieu within the lung, bacteria are confronted mainly with epithelial cells and, even more, with components of the extracellular matrix. sembling the complete sequences of the two most dominant isomers of collagen IV in human lung tissue, 1 and 2, according to the published crystal structure of the NC1 domain (PDB entry 1LI1), P290 is completely localized on the surface, and hence ideally situated for interacting with Mip. the first indication that the PPIase activity is probably of secondary significance was gained from NMR studies of the complex in solution. the mip dimer is able to interact with two NC1 domains via their P290 sequences within the trimeric NC1 complex. the tertiary and quaternary structures of NC1 are not relevantly influenced by this interaction. the latter finding is comprehensible and again supports the idea that Mip acts primarily as an adhesin within the context of Legionella-ECM interaction. hFKBP12 also binds the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3). IP3R forms a Ca2+ channel within the ER membrane. it releases Ca2+ into the cytoplasm upon binding the messenger IP3. this is involved in regulation of autophagy in the model protozoan. mip-like PPIase of burkholderia pseudomallei (BpML1) is a saprophytic betaproteobacterium. it is a major threat due to its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. the disease can progress acutely, remain chronic, or, in some cases, even be asymptomatic. BpML1 is enzymatically active and is the second most thoroughly analyzed Mip-like PPIase. however, unlike Mip, BpML1 lacks the long -helix and the N-terminal dimerization domain. however, the PPIase domains of both proteins reveal 40% identity. virulence factors are generally considered nonessential and benefit pathogens only in the aspects of host colonization and disease. anti-infective drug design approaches are undergoing a rethinking process and are focusing more and more on virulence factors. virulence factors can be of great use for identification or design of specific inhibitors of Mip-like PPIases. this requires the integration of information derived from structural data with information about PPIase-protein interactions in order to discover novel and specific inhibitors. a specific inhibitor of parvulin-like PPIases was missing at the time of their discovery. juglone, a secondary metabolite of chestnut trees, was also identified by screening of a library of natural compounds (271\u2013274) nature remains one of the most important sources for looking for PPIase inhibitors. mainly hydrophobic part is solvent exposed. this creates a unique \u201ceffector domain\u201d that enables FKBP12 to bind to calcineurin (269, 282) this creates a unique effector domain that enables FKBP12 to bind to calcineurin. an even better substitution for the pyran ring turned out to be 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl, as in the case of VA-10,367. a cyclohexan derived from (R)-()-carvone substituting for the pyran residue achieved a Ki (app) of 0.5 nM, and thus was as good as FK506, with a Ki (app) of 0.4 nM (284). omimetic inhibitor, -naphthyl-Pro-Phe-Val-phenyl tetrapeptide, was identified as the best inhibitor, with a Kd value of 0.8 M. a compound resembling a Leu-Pro-tyrosyl tripeptide displayed the highest affinity to FKBP12, with a Ki (app) value of 8.6 M (288). structure B showed promising results as an inhibitor, with an IC50 of 6 M. a peptidomimetic inhibitor resembling a -naphthyl-Pro-Phe-Val-phenyl tetrapeptide was determined to be the best inhibitor, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.3 M. several peptidomimetics containing a trans-substituted alkene in place of a proline were produced and tested for PPIase-inhibitory activity. some of the most innovative structures with FKBP-inhibitory capacity were identified by two different screening strategies. in two recent publications, small-molecule inhibitors of Mip and BpML1 were identified and tested for PPIase-inhibitory activity. both structures had the pipecoline ring in common, but in structure B this group was replaced by a sulfonamide anchor (283, 292) the suitability of both structures for Mip was analyzed by molecular docking. a pure (S)-enantiomer of structure B (S-4c) had a slightly higher inhibitory activity toward Mip than that of its racemic mixture, 4c (IC50 of 6 M versus 9 M) it was also shown, with the help of the derivative 4d (IC50 = 28 M), that an extended aromatic group improved the inhibitory potential. it was also tested in an infection assay and compared to rapamycin. crystal structures of Mip (PDB entry 1FD9), TcMip (PDB entry 1JVW) and BpML1 (PDB entry 2Y78) have been generated (232, 238, 263). hFKBP12 (PDB entry 1FKG) is considered primordial and is used for comparative structure-based approaches (283) in hFKBP12, the hydrophobic cleft is sterically occupied by residues His87, Pro88, Gly89, and Ile90. another structural variation is observed in the cleft base, formed by the residues between Phe46 and Glu54. this suggests adding a large hydrophobic group, such as a benzyl ring to C-43 and an ethyl group to C-44 of rapamycin, to produce the majority of the differences are outside the active site, with a marked difference right in the vicinity of the pocket. the accessibility of the pocket is sterically hindered, allowing the design of smaller inhibitory molecules with Mip-discriminatory capacity. Trp134 and Pro131 of P290 occupied the hydrophobic cleft. the average B factor was 200 due to the high degree of flexibility of the terminal residues. this again hints to the importance of areas around the catalytic cleft for the design of target discriminating drugs. a new cyclic variant of P290, CPPCLSGFSSLWC, was tested in a molecular docking simulation. a new cyclic variant of P290, CPPCLSGFSSLWC (mutations are shown in italics), was tested in a molecular docking simulation. it was found that the B factor of this variant was improved. the activity of P290 and its derivatives opens up the possibility of inhibiting Mip-like FKBPs of other pathogens. it has been shown that nonimmunosuppressive derivatives of FK520 also have antiparasitic activity on P. falciparum cultures. structure of D44 was identified using structure-based in silico screening of a small-molecule database and verified by in vitro tests. the efficacy of D44 could be confirmed in PPIase assays, where it exhibited inhibition of FKBP35 proteins of both species, with IC50s of around 130 nM. human FKBP12 and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin were not affected at concentrations as high as 10 M. juglone, a secondary metabolite of chestnut trees, was also identified by screening of a library of natural compounds (21) for cyclophilins, there are already natural analogs present (272\u2013274) for FKBPs, there are already natural analogs present (272\u2013274) l with Tyr82, and the hemiketal hydroxyl interact with asp37. this creates a unique effector domain that enables FKBP12 to bind to calcineurin. this creates a unique effector domain that enables FKBP12 to bind to calcineurin (269, 282). a cyclohexan ring substituting for the pyran residue (285) achieved a Ki (app) of 0.5 nM, with a Ki (app) of 0.4 nM (284). a cyclohexan derived from (R)-()-carvone substituting for the pyran residue (285) peptidomimetic inhibitor, -naphthyl-Pro-Phe-Val-phenyl tetrapeptide, has a Ki (app) of 7.9 M (286). a step-by-step approach resulted in the identification of a peptidomimetic inhibitor, -naphthyl-Pro-Phe-Val-phenyl tetrapeptide, with an IC50 of 0.3 M (287). s were tested in protease-coupled PPIase assays. the (S)-enantiomer of structure B showed promising results as an inhibitor, with an IC50 of 6 M. further efforts basically affirmed the importance of the keto amide bond for the ligand-FKBP interaction. the most promising compound out of this study was a leu-Pro-tyrosyl tripeptide, which had a Ki (app) of 8.6 M (Fig. 4D) the most promising compound out of this study was a leu-pro-tyrosyl tripeptide. FK506 and rapamycin exert their immunosuppressant action by binding to human FKBP12 (16, 17) this effect was not due to inhibition of the PPIase activity by either of them (276, 277). interaction with FKBP12 occurs via a \u201cbinding domain\u201d of FK506. the bifunctional nature of FK506 inevitably opened the way for the design of more specific drugs with only PPIase-inhibitory properties. the core of the binding domain of FK506 consisting of the pipecolinyl ring and the keto amide group was kept as the scaffold for acyclic derivatives of FK506. novel FKBP inhibitors identified by synthetic approaches (A to D) and by screening of databases and compound libraries (E to H) and pipecolinic acid derivatives as inhibitors of Mip (I to K) the best alternative to the keto amide group was shown to be a sulfonamide group with a Ki (app) of 160 nM. N-benzyl-oxycarbonyl-Pro-Pro was identified as the best inhibitor, with a Kd value of 0.8 M. Steroids such as 5-pregnan-3,20-dione, with a Kd value of 7 M, were also detected as novel lead structures. novel class of FKBP inhibitors was introduced in which a bicyclic ring system coupled via a thioester bond to a pyridine was employed. but the efficiency of this type of compound was clearly below those of FK506 and VA-10,367 (286) novel structures were also generated with the aim of designing peptidomimetic inhibitors. the first strategy involved using the docking program SANDOCK to evaluate the structures in compound libraries for their suitability as FKBP inhibitors. the second strategy employed the screening of a compound library containing structurally diverse secondary metabolites to identify new lead structures. small-molecule inhibitors of Mip and BpML1 were identified and tested for PPIase-inhibitory activity. they combined data from structural studies with computer-assisted docking methods. both structures had the pipecoline ring in common. cycloheximide-N-ethylethanoate, previously identified as an inhibitor of FKBP12, is also a potent inhibitor of BpML1 (263). cycloheximide-N-ethylethanoate interacted with BpML1 in a way similar to that with a probable protein substrate. hFKBP12 (PDB entry 1FKG) is considered primordial and is used for comparative structure-based approaches (283). the catalytic cleft is formed by Trp59 at the base of the cleft. the residues Phe46, Glu54, Val55, Ile56, Tyr82, and Phe99 line up along the sides of this hydrophobic pocket. a benzyl ring to C-43 and an ethyl group to C-44 of rapamycin produce a derivative which is too bulky to bind to hFKBP12 but still able to bind to TcMip (232) the same structural deviations also apply for Mip, and to a certain degree for BpML1. a model based on molecular docking suggested that P290 interacts over its full length with Mip, whereby the catalytic cleft is occupied mainly by Trp134 and partially by Pro131. the average B factor, reflecting the mean square displacement of residues within a complex, was calculated as 59.08 for P290. mip is shown as a blue surface, with residues that were classified as being part of the interaction surface (2 > 12 Hz) colored red. the color coding of P290 reflects the flexibility of the residues according to their calculated B factors. a new cyclic variant of P290, CPPCLSGFSSLWC, was tested in a molecular docking simulation. it was found that the B factor of this variant was improved by 5%. the activity of P290 and its derivatives opens up the possibility of inhibiting Mip-like FKBPs of other pathogens. BP35 is the most devastating parasite-related disease worldwide. the constant increase in resistance against current therapeutics necessitates the identification of new druggable targets. it has been shown that nonimmunosuppressive derivatives of FK520 also have antiparasitic activity on P. falciparum cultures. proteins of both species, with IC50s of around 130 nM, whereas human FKBP12 and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin were not affected at concentrations as high as 10 M. the interaction of D44 with FKBP35 of P. falciparum and P. vivax was also analyzed by NMR. structure A contained the previously mentioned keto amide moiety. in structure B this group was replaced by a sulfonamide anchor (283, 292) the suitability of both structures for Mip was analyzed by molecular docking. cycloheximide-N-ethylethanoate, previously identified as an inhibitor of FKBP12, is also a potent inhibitor of BpML1. cycloheximide-N-ethylethanoate interacted with BpML1 in a way similar to that with a probable protein substrate. ln157 in Mip and Met61 in BpML1 without any major structural consequences. the same is true for Phe46, which aligns with Ala151 of Mip and Thr112 of TcMip. this degree of conservation points out that targeting only the enzymatically active pocket will not deliver sufficiently discriminating drug candidates. surface topological comparison of hFKBP12 (yellow) (A) and the C-terminal PPIase domain of Legionella Mip (purple) (B) reveals discriminatory features. in hFKBP12, the accessibility of the pocket is sterically hindered. lytic cleft is occupied mainly by Trp134 and partially by Pro131. the rest of P290 performs a turn and projects out of the enzymatic cleft. this conformation of P290 is stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between Pro131CO and Trp134NH. single amino acid substitutions, cyclization of P290, and use of d-amino acids were chosen as strategies. no variants synthesized by using d-amino acids were bound by Mip, suggesting that it stereoselectively binds its target. a shorter cyclic version containing only the core residues 131PSGW134 flanked by two cysteines had a binding strength of only 5% on the peptide microarray, compared to P290. a new cyclic variant of P290, CPPCLSGFSSLWC, was tested in a molecular docking simulation. it was found that the B factor of this variant was improved by 5% and that its solvent-exposed surface was reduced by 7% the amino acids His87 and Ile91, in the 5-6 loop of human FKBP12, are replaced by Cys106/105 and Ser109/108 respectively, in these plasmodial species. the authors of that study screened a three-dimensional (3D) virtual database and identified the substance D44, consisting of a purine-like ring system and a phenyl ring linked by a thio-acetamide linkage (294). these interactions seem to cause structural movements of Phe65/64 and Trp78/77. they form the basis of the enzymatically active hydrophobic pocket of FKBP35. a lead anti-infective targeting PPIases should restrict its inhibitory activity to bacterial PPIases in order to avoid immunosuppressive side effects. peptide derivatives, small synthetic molecules, and derivatives of known natural products have been identified as nonimmunosuppressive inhibitors. the fact that peptide derivatives, small synthetic molecules, and derivatives of known natural products have been identified as nonimmunosuppressive inhibitors shows the versatility of structural possibilities."}
