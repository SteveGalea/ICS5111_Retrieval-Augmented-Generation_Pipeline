{"summary": "despite decades of vaccine development, infectious diseases continue to be the major cause of mortality in much of the world. the roadblocks to global vaccination programs include prohibitive costs of goods and delivery, use of needles, waste disposal, cold-chain requirements. solutions include developing efficient vaccines that are stable at ambient temperatures that can be applied needle-free with minimal waste. delivery to the skin using microneedles poses an attractive means of immunization. adenoviral vectors and live measles virus vaccine have been successfully administered and induced both CD8+ T cell and antibody responses. despite the recent advent of commercial prophylactic HPV L1 VLP-based vaccines targeting the major high-risk cancer-causing types, the high cost of production and requirement for refrigeration make these vaccines inaccessible to the individuals in low resource settings. precedence exists for microneedle-mediated delivery of plasmid DNA to the skin resulting in expression of the encoded reporter genes and vaccine antigens. this suggests that HPV PsV delivered to the skin using microneedles can induce immune responses to both the HPV capsid and to the antigens delivered by microneedles. the fusion protein gene was codon-modified based on a consensus sequence of F and was introduced into the same expression vector as M/M2. the sequence can be found here: http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/lco/target.htm. female 6\u20138-week-old BALB/c and CB6F1 mice were housed in the NIAID and NCI animal care facilities under pathogen-free conditions. animals were humanely euthanized by carbon dioxide according to the current IACUC-approved documents. images were acquired on an IVIS 100 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 min on medium binning. standardized regions of interest were created around the positive signal. animals received three immunizations and were cervicovaginally challenged with HPV16-Luc PsV as described above. HPV16-SeAP samples were co-incubated with serially diluted sera for 1 h on ice. the samples were then placed onto pre-plated 293TT cells. EC50 (serum titer) was calculated using the average of 6 wells of no-antibody controls to represent 100% SeAP activity. 100 l of 1:10 diluted test sample and positive control were added to each well in triplicate. plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1:18,000), HRP-conjugated goat anti-IgG2a (1:8,000) and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgM (1:20,000) supernatants were inoculated onto 80% confluent HEp-2 cell monolayers in triplicate and overlaid with 0.75% methylcellulose in 10% EMEM. the monolayers were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. all plots were generated in Excel or GraphPad Prism v5.0. all plots were generated in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) the dip coating procedure was performed using a specially designed apparatus. the apparatus has a chamber with coating solution and a microneedle holder attached to motorized linear stages. the coating procedure was repeated 8 times to build up a sufficiently thick film. microneedles were placed for 2 min into the skin on the backs of anesthetized mice. animals received three immunizations, each three weeks apart. cervicovaginally challenged with 108 IU of HPV16-Luc PsV. all RSV challenge studies consisted of challenging animals with 107 PFU of rAd5-M/M2 (100 l) intranasally and evaluating protection as previously reported [28]. bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by inserting the endotracheal tube through the incision in the trachea into the nasopharynx. the serum titer was then defined as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution at which the HPV-SeAP PsV activity had been reduced by 50%. the EC50 was calculated and an inhibition curve was generated using GraphPad Prism software v5.0 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA, USA) the rate of color change in mOD min 1 was read at a wavelength of 405 nm every 9 s for 5 min, with the plates shaken before each measurement. the mean mOD min 1 reading of duplicate wells was calculated, and the background mOD min 1 was subtracted from the corresponding well. surface and tetramer staining of lymphocytes Lymphocytes were isolated from right lung with Fico-Lite (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA, USA) and tetramer-stained with KdM282\u201390 or I-AbM209\u2013223. samples were stained according to the protocol for the surface and tetramer staining described below. immunization was performed with a high dose (3 g) and a low dose (0.3 g) in the absence of adjuvant. animals were immunized three times, each three weeks apart. vaccination using microneedles or syringe injection generated similar levels of nAb. a group of animals receiving an intramuscular injection of VLPs rinsed off of the microneedles was added to ensure immunogenicity was retained during the coating process. the group was not challenged in order to serve as a negative control group for luminescence. the current HPV vaccine formulation contains L1-only VLPs. microneedles were coated with a PsV preparation encapsidating a plasmid encoding the RSV fusion protein (HPV16-F PsV) the L1 content was measured by Western blot and determined to be 25 ng L1/array. animals were immunized with 10 (250 ng), 3 (75 ng) or 1 (25 ng) microneedle array(s) three times, each three weeks apart. the control arm received 10 microneedles coated with coating buffer only. mice were cervicovaginally challenged with 108 IU of HPV16-Luc. luciferase-expressing particles rinsed from microneedles were capable of delivering a plasmid in vitro as indicated by transduction of GFP expression into the cell. only 20% of the particles remained on the microneedles after 30 s of inoculation. uncoated microneedles (Uncoated MN) containing no PsV were used as a negative control. for animals receiving the bifurcated needle treatment (BF needle) or the needle scratching treatment (scrape), 1x109 IU of the same preparation was added to the skin immediately after skin traumatization. the average radiance is shown below each individual animal. low levels of HPV16 L1 Ab were detected in all groups except the uncoated microneedle and scrape groups. further, in vivo protection from HPV challenge was observed in all but these same two groups. a single administration of HPV16 PsV-coated microneedles was capable of eliciting sterilizing immunity against HPV. mice were challenged intranasally with 107 pfu of RSV A2. after 5 days RSV titers were measured in the (B) lung and (C) nose by RSV plaque assays. induction of M/M2-specific T-cells by HPV PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles. only the groups immunized with 10 microneedle arrays showed higher increases in CD8+ T-cell and significant increases in CD4+ T-cell responses. only the groups immunized with 10 microneedle arrays showed higher increases in CD8+ T-cell responses. intramuscular immunization was performed with a high dose (3 g) and a low dose (0.3 g) in the absence of adjuvant. animals were immunized three times, each three weeks apart. HPV16 L1 VLPs are immunogenic after coating onto microneedles. animals were vaccinated with two different doses (3g and 0.3g) of HPV16 L1 VLPs. sVs are applied by microneedles In vivo HPV PsV-mediated gene delivery requires both the HPV major (L1) and minor (L2) proteins. current HPV vaccine formulation contains L1-only VLPs, therefore it was important to determine whether HPV L1 neutralizing immunogenicity was not adversely affected. the induction of HPV neutralizing antibodies is not diminished when the HPV capsid is configured for use as a gene delivery system. the control arm received 10 microneedles coated with coating buffer only. three weeks after the last immunization, serum was drawn. lyophilized luciferase-expressing PsV proved equally effective at gene delivery when compared to previously frozen particles using in vivo vaginal challenge model. only 20% of the particles remained on the microneedles after 30 s of inoculation. the coated microneedles were incubated with monolayers of HEp-2 cells. the cells were examined 24 hours later to determine the percentage of infected cells. in animals inoculated with 10 microneedles, the signal peaked two days post-administration at levels that were much higher than background. these data indicate that a dose response is detectable and that HPV PsV coated onto microneedles are capable of delivering a gene in vivo to the skin. in vivo protection from HPV challenge was observed in all but these same two groups. p = 0.02) and the nose (p = 0.04) of animals immunized with 10 microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-F PsV. serum antibodies specific for RSV F protein were detected three weeks after the last immunization with microneedle arrays. one month after microneedle immunization, mice were divided into two groups. one was challenged with RSV and the other was boosted with a low-dose (107 pfu) of recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 vector (rAd5-M/M2) IM. only the groups immunized with 10 microneedle arrays showed higher increases in CD8+ T-cell and significant increases in CD4+ T-cell responses. the data describes the use of HPV PsV as vaccine delivery vehicles for a combination vaccination strategy. the PsV were resistant to freeze drying, lyophilization and coating onto microneedle arrays, retaining both the conformation-dependent epitopes required for inducing neutralizing antibodies and the ability to transduce genes of other antigens. the current approach has potential to facilitate DNA delivery of genes expressing other vaccine antigens. if delivered to the genital mucosa, equivalent immune responses could be elicited with naked DNA compared to a 10,000-fold lower dose. microneedle arrays used in this study were small and limited in their ability to deliver higher doses of vaccine compared to more recently developed technology such as patches and hollow microneedles. dissolvable microneedle patches composed of water-soluble excipients represent perhaps the most promising alternative technology. amount of HPV L1 protein coated onto each microneedle was determined by western blot. 10 microneedle arrays and five microneedle arrays from two representative preparations were each rinsed into 50 l of 1xPBS. 108 IU of HPV16-Luc was administered. animals were imaged 48hrs later for luciferase activity."}
