{"summary": "in both acute and chronic crises, external assistance originates from the most-developed countries. in both acute and chronic crises, external assistance generally originates from the most-developed countries. acute crises cause unstable or dangerous conditions suddenly and unexpectedly, which demand timely intervention. an infectious disease becomes pandemic when it affects large numbers of people across a very wide area, such as on multiple continents. pandemics may stem from natural causes or from the accidental or intentional release of biological warfare agents. despite occasional failures, the international community has repeatedly seen the benefits of such cooperation War and Genocide War. this form of politically motivated violence has occurred in every society\u2019s history. its characteristics include extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality. human-caused horrors such as wars and genocide are not pandemics. the suddenness of natural disasters triggers profound feelings of empathy. the media play to people\u2019s skewed risk perception. the media play to people\u2019s skewed risk perception. deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the only current pandemic. future pandemics will inevitably result from novel influenza strains. they may also stem from viral hemorrhagic fevers. 5.6 billion people (2011), or 80% of the world\u2019s population live in areas with threats to water security. water crisis occurs when the available potable, unpolluted water within a region is less than needed. contaminated water is the biggest killer of children in sub-Saharan Africa. 33 of 193 countries have critically inadequate food supplies. at the beginning of 2009, around 963 million people were undernourished or chronically hungry due to extreme poverty. up to 2 billion people lacked food security intermittently. filariasis 5,941,000 Leishmaniasis 1,974,000 Schistosomiasis 1,707,000 Human African trypanosomiasis

to safe drinking water for about 884 million people. there is still inadequate access to safe drinking water for about 884 million people and for sanitation and waste disposal for 2.5 billion people. the world community has ignored many lesser known, \u201cneglected tropical diseases\u201d (NTDs), because climate, vectors and reservoir hosts restrict them primarily to tropical regions. the world has largely ignored the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended strategic interventions that could control, prevent and even eliminate various NTDs. a 1967 United Nations Protocol expanded this definition to include persons who have fled war or other violence in their home country. the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa also includes people who have left their countries of origin due to acts of external aggression, occupation, domination by foreign powers. non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d that can make progress toward the MDG objectives. most NGOs follow the money, and most NGOs follow the money. most of the world\u2019s major financial giants cancelled up to $55 billion in debt owed by

problematic area concerns the criteria for when and why we intervene. the ideal criteria for intervention are needs driven. aid must strive to reduce future vulnerabilities to disaster. it is the right of people affected by disaster or armed conflict to have:64 Life with dignity. it is the state\u2019s primary role and responsibility to provide assistance when people\u2019s capacity to cope has been exceeded. the ICRC believes that it will be interpreted and applied in conformity with international humanitarian law. a wide range of secular and non-secular humanitarian agencies helped develop the Sphere Project\u2019s humanitarian Charter. the ICRC believes it will be interpreted and applied in conformity with international humanitarian law. researchers should maintain confidentiality and privacy, subjects should receive study results, and redundant research should be minimized. lack of evidence-based criteria for disaster interventions raises ethical concerns about when, why and how we should respond to humanitarian catastrophes. human rights law derives from advisory declarations and conventions. the nature of and actions taken during governmental/supragovernmental interventions follow international humanitarian law or the law of armed conflict. it is forbidden to kill or injure an enemy who surrenders or who is hors de combat. the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for by the party to the conflict. the emblem of the red cross or the red Crescent is the sign of such protection and must be respected. a series of advisory declarations and (binding) conventions make up the balance of international human rights law. the nature of and actions taken during governmental/supragovernmental interventions follow international humanitarian law or the law of armed conflict. the law of war proper, the Geneva Conventions, and subsequent treaties and protocols (1864 to 2005) parties to a conflict and members of their armed forces do not have an unlimited choice of methods and means of warfare. it is prohibited to employ weapons or methods of warfare of a nature to cause unnecessary losses or excessive suffering. Neither the civilian population as such nor civilian persons shall be the object of attack. it is forbidden to kill or injure an enemy who surrenders or who is hors de combat. the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for by the party to the conflict which has them in its power. the emblem of the red cross or the red Crescent is the sign of such protection and must be respected. sections will review progress toward the MDGs related to food and water insecurity and to preventing and treating debilitating endemic and pandemic infectious diseases. the data are official government-supplied statistics supplemented by information from international agencies. the international community has had even less success in preventing armed conflicts. current conflicts that cause at least 1,000 deaths/year are taking place in Columbia, Afghanistan, Somalia/Somaliland, Pakistan, Mexico, South Sudan/Sudan, Syria, and Iraq. the proportion of people using an improved water source rose from 76% in 1990 to 89% in 2010, with more than 2 billion people gaining access to improved drinking water sources. the UN estimates that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity. 46 Six million children die of hunger every year\u201417,000 every day. the momentum in addressing this devastating disease is slowing, largely due to inadequate resources and increasing plasmodium resistance. there is no data on another MDG indicator, the proportion of febrile children less than 5-years old who were treated with appropriate antimalarial drugs. sub-saharan africa has made the most progress, with an 85 per cent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2010. the UN has failed to report any progress either in providing access to affordable essential drugs in developing countries or in increasing the proportion of people with access to affordable essential drugs on a sustainable basis. improvements should include: educating governments and the public about the best response to disasters. international rules for \"humanitarian (military) interventions\" remain so unclear that most interventions occur only after countless lives are lost. the international community must supply ongoing and sufficient funding to address chronic crises of food and water insecurity and prevention and treatment of endemic infectious diseases."}
