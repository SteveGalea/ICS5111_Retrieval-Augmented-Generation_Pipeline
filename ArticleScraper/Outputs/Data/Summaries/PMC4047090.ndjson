Western Blot Analysis Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis on 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. after blotting, the membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies. the region\u2013aa 338 to aa 434 of PRRSV NSP2 has been shown to be dispensable for viral replication. the chimeric virus designated as RvMyc-JXwn and its parental virus RvJXwn were serially passaged in MARC-145 cells. confocal microscopy analysis showed that the chimeric virus was rescued successfully and the foreign 3xMyc tag could be stably maintained in the virus for at least 10 passages in vitro. the growth kinetics of the fifth passage of chimeric virus RvMyc-JXwn and its parental virus RvJXwn were drawn using microtitration infectivity assays. data are meansstandard deviations (error bars) from three independent trials. no significant difference between the recombinant virus and the parental virus (p>0.05) infected cells harvested at 48 h post-infection were immunopricicipitated with monoclonal antibody against Myc. at least 13 bands of proteins specifically precipitated in myc-tagged RvMyc-JXwn were detected. the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in 8% and 15% SDS-PAGE respectively. proteins were separated by 8% (A) and 15% (B) SDS-PAGE and visualized by sliver staining. the numbers on the right lane show the differential protein bands between RvMyc-JXwn- and RvJXwn-infected MARC-145 cells. pathways involved in infectious disease (117 proteins), translation (55 proteins), immune system (52 proteins), signal transduction (48 proteins), nervous system (37 proteins), replication and repair (28 proteins), cell communication (22 proteins), cell growth and death (21 proteins) we further focused on the enriched KEGG Pathways of the identified proteins associated with BAG6 and AIF1. the results showed that both BAG6 and AIF1 could be readily detected only in the presence of NSP2 but not in the presence of empty vector. the endogenous BAG6 and AIF1 could be detected in RvMyc-JXwn-infected cells. ARC-145 cells were infected with the recombinant virus RvMyc-JXwn and its parental virus RvJXwn. lysates were prepared at 48 h post-infected and subjected to IP with anti-Myc antibody. the immunoprecipitated samples were detected with antibodies against BAG6 and AIF1 by Western blot. the confocal microscopy analysis showed that Myc and N protein were present in the cells. both the confocal microscopy analysis and the sequence analysis showed that, the chimeric virus was rescued successfully. the chimeric virus was stably maintained in the virus for at least 10 passages in vitro. the expression level of NSP2 increased during PRRSV infection, and reached a peak at 48 h post-infection. the results showed that the expression level of NSP2 increased during PRRSV infection, and reached a peak at 48 h post-infection. infected cells harvested at 48 h post-infection were immunopricicipitated with monoclonal antibody. 617 cellular proteins were identified by further LC-MS/MS analysis. 285 proteins with high Confidence Icons (p0.01) were used for bioinformatics analysis. a summary of these proteins interacting with PRRSV NSP2 is given in. biological regulation (7.63%), biological process regulation (7.60%) and response to stimulus (6.60%) were enriched in biological process category. most enriched subclasses in cellular component included cell (17.38%) and cell part (17.38%), organelle (16.17%) and organelle part (17.38%), macromolecular complex (10.76%), membrane-enclosed lumen (9.04%). the cellular proteins BAG6 and AIF1 were detected in the L1 and L7. the amplified cDNAs of porcine BAG6 and AIF1 genes were sequenced. the sequences of porcine BAG6 and AIF1 genes have been submitted to GenBank. the endogenous BAG6 and AIF1 could be detected in RvMyc-JXwn-infected cells, but not in RvJXwn-infected cells. these results confirmed that PRRSV NSP2 were able to interact with the cellular proteins BAG6 and AIF1. 293FT cells were co-transfected with 6 g of the indicated plasmids. host interactions are a considerable way for exploring the mechanisms associated with viral pathogenesis and host anti-virus response. the NSP2 of PRRSV is the largest nonstructural protein, as well as recognized as the most variable region in the genome of PRRSV, with a number of substitutions, insertions and deletions. 285 host cellular proteins that interact with NSP2 were identified in RvMyc-JXwn-infected cells by the combined IP and LC-MS/MS. a significant proportion of the enriched KEGG pathways, including 20 enriched KEGG pathways and 117 proteins, were shown to be associated with the infectious disease. previous studies have demonstrated that PRRSV has a predilection for infecting immune cells and driving immunosuppression and the persistent infection in pigs. however the mechanisms associated with the PRRSV-induced immunosuppression are still poorly understood. GG pathways including 10 enriched KEGG pathways and 37 proteins were also found in the NSP2 interaction network. the nervous symptom can be observed in PRRSV-infected pigs. the virus can be isolated from the brain tissues of infected animals. a series of studies have described that BAG6 is a master regulator of tail-anchored (TA) protein quality control [57]. some proteins can be delivered to the ER membrane [59], [60], whereas others can be degraded by BAG6-associated ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway [61], [62]. the interactions between PRRSV NSP2 and porcine BAG6 or AIF1 were further confirmed by co-IP. the pivotal process of AIF1-inducing apoptosis is that mitochondrial AIF1 translocates to nucleus and induces chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation. NSP2 of PRRSV is the largest nonstructural protein, as well as recognized as the most variable region in the genome of PRRSV. the functions of NSP2 OUT domain on deconjugating ISG15 and an ubiquitin-like molecule in IFN pathway have been documented [42]. 285 host cellular proteins that interact with NSP2 were identified in RvMyc-JXwn-infected cells by the combined IP and LC-MS/MS. a significant proportion of the enriched KEGG pathways, including 20 enriched KEGG pathways and 117 proteins, were shown to be associated with the infectious disease. the synthesis of subgenomic RNA is translated from the subgenomic mRNA [11], [37], [46], [47]. previous studies have demonstrated that PRRSV has a predilection for infecting immune cells and driving immunosuppression and the persistent infection in pigs. however the mechanisms associated with PRRSV-induced immunosuppression are still poorly understood. the NSP2 functions on the induction of immunosuppression and persistent infection induced by PRRSV. KEGG pathways including 10 enriched KEGG pathways and 37 proteins were also found in the NSP2 interaction network. the nervous symptom can be observed in PRRSV-infected pigs. 17 cellular proteins involved in the pathway of protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. one protein-BAG6 is also called BAT3 (HLA-B-associated transcript 3) or Scythe. a series of studies have described that BAG6 is a master regulator of tail-anchored (TA) protein quality control. apoptosis pathway-associated protein (AIF1) is a mitochondrial flavoprotein contributing to caspase-independent cell death [66] and plays a key role in mediating poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-dependent cell death [67], [68]. the pivotal process of AIF1-inducing apoptosis is that mitochondrial AIF1 translocates to nucleus and induces chromatin condensation and both BAG6 and AIF1 could interact with NSP2 of PRRSV. these findings generate new view on complicated molecular mechanisms in PRRSV-driven apoptosis. enriched KEGG Pathways of the PRRSV Nsp2 interacting proteins."}
