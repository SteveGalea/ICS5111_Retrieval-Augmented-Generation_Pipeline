{"summary": "two noncanonical mechanisms, 1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (1PRF) and programmed ribosomal readthrough (PRT), circumvent stop codons for the expression of carboxy-terminal extension products. in 1PRF, the elongating ribosome shifts back 1 residue at a 7-residue slippery sequence upstream of the stop codon and then continues translating in the new reading frame. despite 25 years of study, the specific mechanism(s) that mediates the critical ratio of recoding to termination products remains unresolved. for 1PRF, pseudoknotted structures are proposed to compromise the translocation process by forming a physical barrier that blocks the mRNA entrance channel. stability of the stem of simple RSE hairpins has also been suggested to serve a similar function in promoting PRT and 1PRF (17, 19, 21). isance RNA-RNA interactions are required for efficient 1PRF in pea enation mosaic virus RNA 2 (PEMV2), barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) and Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (21, 26\u201329) and for PRT in carnation italian ringspot virus and Tobacco necrosis virus D (30, 31) the TCV RSE is located just downstream of the p28 amber termination codon. it contains two asymmetric internal loops, one of which pairs with the apical loop of the terminal 3\u2032-end Pr hairpin. hairpins in the location of the SLA relative to the RSE are conserved in the Tombusviridae (see Fig. 2). a short conserved sequence just downstream from the recoding site is required for efficient PRT. this sequence is similar to the sequence previously found at the gag-pol junction in gammaretroviruses (38, 39) uncapped RNA transcripts (1 pmol) were translated in 10 l of wheat germ extract. the reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h. the dried gel was exposed to a phosphorimager screen. in vitro SHAPE, 6 pmol of in vitro-transcribed, full-length TCV gRNA was denatured for 5 min at 65\u00b0C, snap-cooled on ice, and then incubated in folding buffer at 37\u00b0 for 20 min. reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 35 min, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 8 l 0.5 Tris-EDTA buffer. 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7; final concentration, 5 mM) was added to the protoplasts for base modification or an equal volume of DMSO was added as a negative control. unmodified WT TCV was used to generate dideoxy sequencing ladders. cells were collected by centrifugation; total RNA was extracted; and the RNA was resuspended in H2O. the reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. the dried gel was exposed to a phosphorimager screen and was scanned by a fluorescent image analyzer (Fujifilm) band intensity was quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 35 min, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 8 l 0.5 Tris-EDTA buffer. primers complementary to TCV positions 940 to 964, 875 to 894, 839 to 862, and 995 to 1018 were used for probing the RSE, stem-loop A, and downstream region structures. unmodified WT TCV was used to generate dideoxy sequencing ladders. cells were collected by centrifugation; total RNA was extracted; and the RNA was resuspended in H2O. all SHAPE structure mapping was conducted in duplicate, independent experiments. a member of the genus Tombusvirus is a member of the genus Panicovirus. m1 and m2 mutations (m1+m2) were compensatory, with accumulation increasing (over m1 levels) to 71% of WT accumulation. the structure of the RSE must form an alternative structure without S1 and with an internal pseudoknot. mutations in loops and mutations designed to be compensatory in stems were generated throughout the hairpin. levels of mutant gRNAs were also assessed in protoplasts. mutating the terminal loop (m3) or the base pair just below internal loop L3 (m6, m7) did not affect readthrough or gRNA accumulation in vivo. match to GC and AU (m14) enhanced readthrough to 275% of the WT level. the latter result correlates with published reports indicating that strengthening the stability of RSE lower stems positively impacts PRT and 1PRF (17, 21) a similar 5-base purine-rich sequence follows the stop codon between the gag and pol genes in the murine leukemia virus. the two alterations together (m20) reduced readthrough to 13% or 16% of WT readthrough, respectively. both base pairing and the identity of G821 and/or C986 are important for readthrough. m24 should restore the S1 stem and maintain the pseudoknot. the noncompensatory nature of the residues in stem S1 suggests that one or more of the conserved guanylates downstream of the amber codon are required for efficient readthrough. SHAPE (selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) was used to structurally map the SLA/RSE region in full-length TCV gRNA prepared in vitro. gRNA that contained mutations in the Pr loop designed to disrupt the long-distance interaction was used. this necessary tertiary interaction also was not detected in gRNA prepared in vitro. the first three lanes are nucleotide ladder lanes. I, IM7 treated; D, DMSO treated. m14 and m25+m26 share similar structural alterations in upper 3\u2032 S2 and lower L2 regions. gRNA that was capable (WT) or incapable (GDD) of amplification was subjected to SHAPE at 40 h postinoculation (40 hpi), since plant viruses are restricted to initially inoculated protoplasts. cells were treated with 1M7 (a membrane-permeant electrophile that generated an in vitro SHAPE profile identical to that with NMIA), followed by cell lysis, total-RNA extraction, and primer extension. the in mutant gRNA was subjected to in vitro SHAPE profiles. all four S1 3\u2032-side cytidylates were changed to guanylates. however, no change in the flexibility of the 5\u2032-side guanylates was detected. mutations in the RSE pseudoknot do not result in detection of the pseudoknot in in vitro-synthesized gRNA. the first three lanes are nucleotide ladder lanes; N, NMIA treated; D, DMSO treated. specific locations in the RSE are marked by brackets. mutations on the 3\u2032 side of S2 were no longer flexible, suggesting that the majority of the S2 stem was now forming. in m25+m26 gRNA, the mutated residues on the 3\u2032 side were no longer flexible, suggesting that the majority of the S2 stem was now forming. the upper portion of S2 and the lower portion of L2 contained large numbers of residues with enhanced flexibility, including G783. mutated residues on the 5\u2032 side of S2 are flexible in m25. mutated residues on the 3\u2032 side of S2 retain WT-like flexibility. m25+m26 gRNA was significantly altered when either the S2 stem formed or the alternative pairing of S2 residues was disrupted. a region upstream of SLA is implicated in alternative pairing with RSE S2 residues. no discernible differences were detected either upstream or downstream of this region. mutation of residues 720 to 735 did not by itself result in the formation of the phylogenetically conserved S2 stem. SHAPE mapping of the RSE and SLA regions in mutant gRNAs prepared in vitro. the first three lanes are nucleotide ladder lanes. the blue bracket delineates the region upstream of SLA containing the m27 mutations. m28 mutations in gRNA showed significant disruptions on both sides of the S5 stem. structural changes very similar to those found for m28 were evident in the S1+S2 region of the extended SLA. m30 mutations in the upper stem S6 of SLA enhanced the flexibility of several S6 stem residues without discernibly affecting the flexibility of the remainder of the SLA. m28 and m29 cause alterations in residue flexibility in lower L2 and adjacent upper S2 (3\u2032) similar to those caused by m14, m25+m26, and m27. m29 and m30 reduced gRNA levels in protoplasts to 48% and 28% of WT levels. the 5\u2032 hairpin, known as stem-loop A, is within 10 nt of the amber termination codon. the 3\u2032 hairpin is an unbranched structure with two large, asymmetric internal loops (L2 and L3) of which L2 is engaged in the long-distance interaction with sequences at the 3\u2032 end. the guanylate nearly always participating in the terminal base pair at the base of the GC-rich lower stem (S1). internal loop mutation m1, which disrupts the putative pseudoknot, reduced the synthesis of p88 by 97% in WGE. stem S1 mutation m2, which would convert GC to G:U pairs in S1 and the putative pseudoknot, did not affect readthrough. mutations in loops and mutations designed to be compensatory in stems were generated throughout the hairpin. mutating the three base pairs just below L3 (m8, m9) reduced PRT to background levels, whereas the compensatory mutation (m10) restored p88 synthesis to WT levels. the combination of the two alterations was compensatory for gRNA accumulation in vivo. base alterations were chosen for being silent in the encoded RdRp. codon usage was similar to that of the WT residue. in vitro translation of full-length WT and mutant gRNAs in WGE. both base pairing and the identity of G821 and/or C986 are important for readthrough. the three guanylates in positions +1, +2, and +3 were converted to cytidylates (m21) and the opposing cytidylates were converted to guanylates (m22) SHAPE detects flexible residues whose 2\u2032 OH can form covalent bonds with NMIA. this is an impediment for reverse transcriptase-mediated primer extension. residues with moderately high to high reactivity with NMIA are shown in red. SHAPE mapping of the RSE and SLA regions in gRNA accumulating in vivo at 40 hpi. the gel in panel C is a longer run of the samples shown in panel B. m25+m26 (compensatory mutations in the lower S2 stem) gRNA. m34 mutations that disrupt the long-distance interaction are shown. SHAPE mapping of the RSE region in m14 gRNAs prepared in vitro. cells were treated with 1M7 (a membrane-permeant electrophile that generated an in vitro SHAPE profile identical to that with NMIA), followed by cell lysis, total-RNA extraction, and primer extension. the in vivo SHAPE profile for the RSE region at this time point was very similar to the in vitro SHAPE profile. the structure of the RSE region in the in vitro-synthesized gRNA did not represent a kinetically RNA was subjected to in vitro SHAPE (Fig. 5B) no change in the flexibility of the 5\u2032-side guanylates was detected. however, the mutated L3 residues were no longer flexible. m32+m33 mutant showed little change in flexibility from that with m32 alone. mutant gRNAs were generated in m25, m26, and m25+m26 gRNAs. mutated residues on the 3\u2032 side of S2 were no longer flexible. in m25+m26 gRNA, the mutated residues on the 3\u2032 side were no longer flexible. the locations of mutations (m25 and m26) generated in full-length TCV gRNA are shown. the locations of mutations (m25 and m26) are color coded as described in the legend to Fig. 4A. the SHAPE profile of m14 gRNA showed structural changes in this region similar to those of m25+m26 gRNA. readthrough was enhanced in m14 gRNA (Fig. 3) and depressed in m25+m26 gRNA (Fig. 6B and D) no difference in L2 flexibility from that in WT gRNA was found in m34 or m25+m26+m34 gRNA. the mutated region in m27 gRNA became more flexible. mutation of residues 720 to 735 did not result in the formation of the phylogenetically conserved S2 stem. this flexibility signature is not directly associated with the formation of the phylogenetically conserved S2 stem. m28 gRNA caused several residues to gain flexibility on the opposing (3\u2032) side of the stem. m28 mutations increased the flexibility of residues in the S5 stem. m28 mutations increased the flexibility of residues in the S5 stem. m30 mutations in the lower half of the basal SLA structure enhanced the flexibility of several S6 stem residues without discernible affecting the flexibility of the remainder of the SLA. the most prominent conformation of the RSE is proposed to be the \u201cactive\u201d form, which must convert to the active form for readthrough. m28 and m29 cause alterations in residue flexibility in lower L2 and adjacent upper S2 (3\u2032) similar to those caused by m14, m25+m26, and m27. m28 and m29 caused minor (20%) increases in p88 translation in WGE. m30 reduced gRNA levels in protoplasts to 48% and 28% of WT levels. at least two large, asymmetric internal loops engaged in an important long-distance interaction with the 3\u2032 end (28, 30, 31) this RNA bridge had been proposed to form an atypical pseudoknot in the RSE that functionally replaces the pseudoknot commonly found in animal virus RSEs. the function of the long-distance interaction is not a simple substitution for a local H-type pseudoknot. conserved sequence (cons) at the PRT site in tombusvirids is highlighted. gammaretroviruses engaged in PRT of amber codons are structurally conserved. the conserved sequence is highlighted. hairpins in the same location as SLA are predicted to form upstream of RSEs in all tombusvirids examined. a hairpin in this location was previously reported in BYDV (26), as well as in umbraviruses (21) and coronaviruses (33), where they serve as repressors of recoding. m27 mutations disrupted four of the pairing partners for the 5\u2032 side of RSE S1+S2. this suggests that it may also be necessary to free the 3\u2032 side of the RSE S1+S2 stem from its paired location before the S1+S2 stem can form. this suggests that it may also be necessary to free the 3\u2032 side of the RSE from its paired location before the S1+S2 stem can form. ribosome pausing and insertion of a tRNA that decodes the amber stop codon may be widespread. the presence of alternative structures has been suggested by SHAPE structure modeling of the RSE region in full-length HIV in vitro. sequence found in a minority of SARS-CoV isolates maintain the structure of both SLA and the extended stem. current models proposed to explain how RSEs mediate either 1PFR or PFT at the precise ratios found in infected cells require the assumption that all sequences necessary for regulating recoding are encompassed within the recoding site. conserved residues were also identified downstream of the amber termination codon. gammaretroviruses share a similar conserved sequence downstream of their amber termination codon at the gag-pol junction (UAG GGN NGN) PERV, porcine endogenous retrovirus; OHEV, Odocoileus hemionus endogenous virus; FLV, Feline leukemia virus; BEV, Baboon endogenous retrovirus; MDEV, Mus dunni endogenous virus; RfRV, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum retrovirus. a possible basal structure proposed previously (38, 39) hairpins in the same location as SLA are predicted to form upstream of RSEs in all tombusvirids examined. a hairpin in this location was previously reported in BYDV (26), as well as in umbraviruses (21) and coronaviruses (33), where they serve as repressors of recoding. strong conservation of a hairpin just upstream of the recoding site suggests a role for this hairpin in both readthrough and frame m28 mutations disrupted four pairing partners for the 5\u2032 side of RSE S1+S2. this suggests that it may also be necessary to free the 3\u2032 side of the RSE from its paired location before the S1+S2 stem can form. genetic evidence clearly demonstrated that an RSE containing the S2 stem is critical for recoding in vitro. the presence of alternative structures has been suggested by SHAPE structure modeling of the RSE region in full-length HIV in vitro. the previously proposed two-helix model (9, 47, 48) was missing upstream and downstream sequences that together generate a more complex structure. muLV also has basal and active conformations of its RSE (50, 51) current models proposed to explain how RSEs mediate either 1PFR or PFT at precise ratios found in infected cells require the assumption that all sequences necessary for regulating recoding are encompassed within the recoding site and downstream RSE (13, 20, 25). repressive/regulatory upstream hairpins might be key components in the formation of alternative basal forms of RSEs."}
