{"summary": "Bordetella bronchiseptica colonization is widespread in swine populations. it is the primary cause of bronchopneumonia and in older pigs contributes to secondary pneumonia. it promotes colonization by toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida, which leads to severe progressive atrophic rhinitis. genome sequencing was prepared from bacteria grown overnight at 37\u00b0C. genome was assembled using a combination of Roche GS (FLX and FLXplus) and Illumina GAIIx sequencing. genome was assembled using MIRA v3.4.0 and the Roche GS De Novo Assembler v2.6 to achieve 87 total genome coverage. Automated annotation using Prokka v1.7 (20) identified a total of 4,853 predicted protein coding sequences (CDSs), 3 rRNA operons, 1 transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) and 54 tRNAs. the Illunina HiSeq short read sequence has been deposited at the European nucleotide archive."}
