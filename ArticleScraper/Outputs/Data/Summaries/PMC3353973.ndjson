{"summary": "fusion is driven by specialized proteins which act through a common mechanism. the more prevalent \u201cclass I\u201d fusion proteins harbor two heptad repeat (HR) regions which are central to the process, the first in the N-terminal region adjacent to the fusion peptide (HRN) and the second in the C-terminal region, immediately preceding the transmembrane domain. peptide-based antivirals in viral fusion proteins can be easily identified directly from genomic information, through computer programs like LearnCoil [20] or MultiCoil [21], [22]. putative HRN and HRC peptides in viral fusion proteins can be easily identified directly from genomic information, through computer programs like LearnCoil [20], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. cholesterol tagging of an HRC peptide from the paramyxovirus human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) also increased its antiviral potency. the cholesterol-tagged peptide now acquired the ability to also inhibit the rubulavirus SV5 [43], both fatal in humans. jugated C34 was undetectable in plasma after 6 h, 130 nM of C34-Chol was still detectable 24 h after the injection. a concentration 300-fold higher than the IC90 measured against multiple HIV-1 strains. a single anchoring moiety is sufficient for proteins considerably larger in size. multimeric fusion inhibitors have a monomer size of 35\u201340 amino acids. despite the trimeric structure of the fusion intermediate, the maximum benefit of multimerization is achieved at the level of dimer, with little \u2013 or even no \u2013 additional benefit in trimeric inhibitors [46], [47]. peptide precursors (HPIV-P1, HIV-P1) to the maleimide-functionalized core 9 were prepared by using bromoacetyl anhydride instead of 4-maleimido-butyric acid. however, it turned out to be difficult to control the competition between reactivity of the core and hydrolysis of the bromoacetyl group. peptides show potent antiviral activity Against Different Enveloped Viruses. peptide efficacy in vivo is directly correlated with inhibition of viral fusion and cell-to-cell spreading. ineffective at blocking cell-to-cell fusion were not effective in the natural host. we used a cell-to-cell fusion assay using cells co-expressing the envelope viral glycoproteins of HPIV3 and NiV. this is our most stringent in vitro assay to evaluate peptide efficacy. fusion is shown as a function of the (log-scale) concentration of peptide. the cholesterol-tagged dimer is considerably more potent than the cholesterol-tagged monomer, which in turn is 10-fold more potent than the untagged inhibitor. the dimeric-cholesterol tagged inhibitor is 10-fold more potent than the cholesterol-tagged monomer. the cholesterol-tagged peptides are highly effective at blocking viral entry. the increased potency due to dimerization could be appreciated in the cell-to-cell fusion assay of figure 2 and 3. IC50 for HIV-P2 = 31.1236 nM and 60.1484 nM on IIIB and BaL. the monomeric cholesterol-tagged inhibitor is comparably potent. the comparable potency of the cholesterol-tagged monomer and dimer suggest that we have reached the previously identified potency plateau for very high-affinity inhibitors. the infected hamsters were observed daily for clinical signs (prostration, neurological signs) and variations in temperature and weight. treatment with the peptide resulted in survival of one of the five animals. treatment with the peptide resulted in survival of one of the five animals. a single anchoring moiety is sufficient for proteins considerably larger in size [50] than large copy number multimeric inhibitors with a monomer size of 35\u201340 amino acids. findings suggest that despite the trimeric structure of the fusion intermediate, the maximum benefit of multimerization is achieved at the level of dimer, with little \u2013 or even no \u2013 additional benefit in trimeric inhibitors. dimeric cholesterol-tagged fusion inhibitors were prepared via conjugation of the cysteine-containing peptide precursors (HPIV-P1, HIV-P1) to the maleimide-functionalized core 9. the corresponding functionalized core was prepared by using bromoacetyl anhydride instead of 4-maleimido-butyric acid. the reaction was straightforward, and it proceeded rapidly in good overall yield. the peptide derived from the sequence of HPIV3 is effective on both HPIV3 and NiV. however, the cholesterol-tagged inhibitor was not yet potent enough because it required sequence optimization to display activity in vivo. fusion inhibitors able to inhibit viral entry but inefficient at blocking cell-to-cell fusion were not effective in the natural host [45], [54] based on these data we decided to use a cell-to-cell fusion assay using cells co-expressing the envelope viral glycoproteins of HPIV3 and NiV. the cholesterol-tagged dimer is considerably more potent than the cholesterol-tagged monomer, which in turn is 10-fold more potent than the untagged inhibitor. in this case, the dimeric-cholesterol tagged inhibitor is 10-fold more potent than the cholesterol-tagged monomer, while the untagged monomer and untagged dimer show similar (lower) potency. nM for the cholesterol tagged monomer and 4.361.3 nM for the cholesterol tagged dimer are highly effective at blocking viral entry. the increased potency due to dimerization could be appreciated in the cell-to-cell fusion assay of figure 2 and 3. the untagged HR-derived peptide is 150-fold and 6,000-fold on the two strains. the monomeric cholesterol-tagged inhibitor is comparably potent, with IC50 = 8070 pM and 360330 pM on IIIB and BaL. the infected hamsters were observed daily for clinical signs (prostration, neurological signs) and variations in temperature and weight. all the untreated animals were euthanized within 7 days after infection due to neurological disease. treatment with the peptide resulted in survival of one of five animals. optimization of the length of the linker joining the monomers may provide considerable increase in potency. chemoselective pairs may prove superior in terms of reactivity and yield. other chemoselective pairs may prove superior in terms of reactivity. antiviral activity against live Nipah virus In the plaque reduction assay, serial dilutions of peptides in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Invitrogen) were added for 1h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. supernatants were replaced by 2ml of 1.6% of Carboxymethylcellulose in DMEM containing 3% of FCS. plates were incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 CCR5, CXCR4 and integrated reporter genes for firefly luciferase (Luc) and E.coli -gal were seeded into 96-well flat bottomed plastic plates at 1104 cells/well. cells were seeded into 96-well flat bottomed plastic plates at 1104 cells/well and were incubated for 1 h in a total volume of 50 l. the PBMC were seeded at 1.4106 cells/ml in 100 l per well in 96-well plates. the PBMC were seeded at 1.4106 cells/ml in 100 l per well. a serially diluted inhibitor immediately prior to inoculation with the test virus was added. i.p injections of peptide (2 mg/kg) for 10 days, starting from the day of infection, or left untreated. group of 5 animals were treated daily by i.p injections of peptide (2 mg/kg) for 10 days.
