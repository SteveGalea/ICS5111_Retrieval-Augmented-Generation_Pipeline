{"summary": "we analysed codon usage and related indices using 18,000 coding sequences retrieved from H. manillensis RNA-Seq data. results We identified four highly preferred codons in H. manillensis that have G/C-endings. different columns represent different value types, and their specific meanings were shown at the beginning of each column. this file contains all the calculated RSCU values of each sequence and the first 2 PCA factors. the stop codons were not included and thusly this file has 62 columns."}
