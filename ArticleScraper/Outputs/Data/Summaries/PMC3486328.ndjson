{"summary": "polyomavirus capsid interacts with TLR4 on antigen-presenting cells to trigger type 1 or type 2 cytokine responses depending on allelic differences in TLR4. this results raise the possibility that polymorphisms in human TLR4 contribute to the development of diseases linked to human polyomavirus infections. antibodies to the Stem of Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Elicited by Engineered VLPs Neutralizing antibodies directed against the conserved stem of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) suggest development of a universal vaccine may be possible. this work establishes a foundation for engineered VLPs as novel immunogens. prion protein (PrPC) posttranslational modifications on the propagation of synthetic prions made solely from bacterially expressed recombinant PrP (rPrP) inoculating rPrP amyloid fibrils into transgenic mice coexpressing wild-type and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchorless PrPC."}
