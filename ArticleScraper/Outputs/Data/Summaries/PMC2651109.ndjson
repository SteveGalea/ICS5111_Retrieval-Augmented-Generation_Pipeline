{"summary": "in the first half of the twentieth century, the \"colds\" or upper respiratory tract infections that caused worsening of asthma symptoms were largely presumed to be caused by a hypersensitivity or allergy to the bacteria that were considered to be responsible for these infections. bacterial immunotherapy containing bacterial extracts was used substantially in the prophylaxis against asthma exacerbations from the 1920s to the late 1950s. hygiene hypothesis suggests early exposure to bacterial products may prevent allergic sensitization and asthma because the immune system has been steered toward the Th1 pathway of CD4 development and away from a Th2 phenotype. the hygiene hypothesis would have been to have given bacterial allergen immunotherapy containing endotoxin to young children. a cohort of over 95,000 children enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program were followed over their first five viral seasons until the age of 5 1/2 years. this population represents approximately one-quarter of the births each year in that state. this population represents approximately one-quarter of the births each year in that state. children who were 121 days (95% CI, 108\u2013131 days) old at the winter virus peak had the greatest risk of developing clinically significant bronchiolitis. the timing of infant birth predicted the likelihood of developing childhood asthma as defined by ICD-9 code or medication use for asthma. the area under the curve is equal to the asthma prevalence of the population. compared to children who were 365 days old at the winter virus peak, there was a 29% increase in chances of developing high-risk childhood asthma. a common genetic predisposition could lead to both severe winter viral bronchiolitis and asthma. the other is that an environmental exposure such as winter viral infection leads to asthma. the data presented does not rule out either of these possibilities. analysis of respiratory tract secretions revealed viruses were present 90% of the time that wheezing illnesses occurred in the first three years of life. rhinovirus was the virus most frequently detected (48%), followed by RSV (21%), parainfluenza viruses (12%) in approximately 10% of the respiratory tract secretions. rhinovirus detection in the respiratory tract secretions during wheezing illness during the first year of life was associated with a statistically significant increased odds ratio for having an asthma diagnosis at age 6. there was a further increase in the odds ratio of having asthma at age 6 associated with rhinovirus in the respiratory tract secretions during wheezing illnesses at age 2 (OR 6.5) and age 3 (31.7) determinants of severe RSV-induced disease include surfactant protein A, surfactant protein D, toll like receptor (TLR) 4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-9, IL-10, IL-8, IL-13, and RANTES. genetic association studies suggest variation in specific genetic loci confer susceptibility to severe RSV-induced illness. innate immunity (IFNA13, IL15, STAT1, and TLR8), adaptive immunity (CD28 and STAT1), and allergic asthma (MS3A2, ADAM33, IL4R, and IL17) genes associated with severe disease include those involved in cytokine production (IFNA13, IL15, IL10, and IL17) and cytokine receptor signaling (IL4R, IL9R, and STAT1) 206 previously healthy children were not preselected based on a family history of allergy or asthma. despite this, there was an extraordinary high percentage of children enrolled in RBEL who were physician diagnosed with asthma at age 6. there was no difference in cytokine generation between those who had severe RSV bronchiolitis and those who were not given an asthma diagnosis. asthmatic subjects had significantly increased chest symptoms, increased fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF), and increased methacholine reactivity in response to experimental rhinovirus infection. subjects with greater IFN- and IL-10 production by peripheral blood CD4 cells had decreased viral loads and decreased upper respiratory tract symptoms. cytokine production with near concurrent exposure to the major allergen from the dust mite species Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [58] was associated with early synergistic NF-kB translocation induction. this synergistic increase in epithelial cell production of IL-8, an important neutrophil chemotactic and survival factor. 4% of those vaccinated with the vaccine had RSV-associated upper respiratory tract illness compared to 25% in the control groups. a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial needs to be conducted to fully understand the effect of anti-RSV immunoglobulin on the later development of asthma. innate immunity is present in adult asthmatics compared to nonasthmatic counterpart. Deficiencies in innate immunity are also present in adult asthmatics. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
