Fraction 1 (0.8 g) showed significant activity compared to the other three fractions. was further separated over RP-column chromatography on a C18\u2013125 55\u2013105 um column and eluted with 30% acetonitrile to yield three fractions. quantification of PGG concentration in whole crude ethanol extract was performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system. mobile phase consisted of 2.5% acetic acid in 82% acetonitrile. flow rate was isocratic at 1.4 mls/minute; column used was a 5 um 300A 4.6 100 mM C-18 Venusil ABS. a working solution of resazurin was prepared in sterile PBS, phenol red (0.5 mg/mL), and added (15% v/v) to each sample. a continuous hLDH-A assay using recombinant full length human LDHA (amino acids 1\u2013332) with N terminal His tag. the reaction was started with a solution containing the substrate pyruvate (final concentration = 3 mM) and a reading was taken intermittently over 60 minutes at 340 nm using a 96-well microplate reader. the supernatant was discarded using ice-cold sterile PBS at 4\u00b0C. the membranes were washed in TTBS and incubated in 2\u00b0 goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1 : 500) in 2% nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1.5 Hr at RT. peroxidase was detected with Sigma FAST DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) with a metal enhancer cobalt chloride. images were scanned using an Epson St the protein was then subjected to energy minimization following the gradient termination of the Powell method for 10,000 iterations using MMFF94s force field. the protein was then subjected to energy minimization following the gradient termination of the Powell method for 10,000 iterations using MMFF94s force field. hLDH-A inhibition by solvent extracts (PE: petroleum ether, EA: ethyl acetate) hLDH-A inhibition by further fractionation of the ethyl acetate fraction. data represent hLDH-A activity as % control and are expressed as the mean SEM. the molecule is identified as PGG (1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose) the melting point was determined on a Mel-Temp II apparatus. 1H NMR spectra were 7.146, 7.085, 7.061, 7.012, 6.985, 6.933, 6.279, 6.939, 5.652, 5.622, 4.878, 4.796, 4.665, 4.524, and 4.235. nut extract (250 g/mL) = 24.88 0.85 g/mL), n = 4. data show predicted competitive binding of PGG (Figure 4(a)) within NADH binding cofactor site. the data represent hLDH-A activity as % control (NADH oxidation) at 60 minutes and are expressed as the mean SEM. the data represent hLDH-A activity as % control (NADH oxidation) at 60 minutes. the data are presented as the average rate of reaction: NADH oxidized over 60 minutes at RT and displayed as the mean SEM, n = 4. In order to determine the effects of PGG in vitro, a human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) lysate was evaluated for the baseline expression of hLDH-A. the data represent cell viability/metabolism and lactic acid produced by MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (5.0 106 cells per well) low serum [2%] phenol-free media supplemented with amino acids at 24 hours. the data represent cell proliferation as % control. the RGC extract as a whole is equally capable of inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells [34] and as a cytostatic agent [7]. Moreover, its medicinal value has been described in the scientific literature for its multidimensional therapeutic value. it also confirms the ability of PGG to inhibit hLDH-A which is a therapeutic target in particular given its role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. hLDH-A can trigger aggressive forms of malignancy, increase metastases, and initiate chemoresistance all of which correlate to low survival rates. hLDH-A knockdown, or lowering the functional capacity of hLDH-A, can lead to suppressed tumor growth and metastasis. hLDH-A at the NADH cofactor docking site blocked proliferation. future research will be required to determine cause-effect relationship between hLDH-A inhibition and biochemical metabolic or process related effects in tumor cells."}
