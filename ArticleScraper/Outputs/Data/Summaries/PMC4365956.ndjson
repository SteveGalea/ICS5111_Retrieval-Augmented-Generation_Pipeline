{"summary": "literature search The purpose of this article is to provide a critical review of the research on the epidemiology of suicide among Chinese older adults. the study design was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. studies eligible for inclusion were studies assessing suicide risk and protective factors. -comes Key Findings Hong Kong Sun, 2011 [37] PS 56,088 comm older adults 65+ Dep Age, edu, monthly expenditure, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical, activity, body mass index, health status, self-rated health SD Depressive symptoms were associated with suicide Men: HR=2.03(0.96\u20134.29) Women: HR = 2.36(1.31\u20134.24) indicated suicidal idea before their fatal acts (68%) Tsoh, 2005 [41] CC 224 older adults aged 65+ SDE, circumstances of the suicide act, SA SDE, Circumstances of the suicide act and suicide intent, psychiatric morbidities SA Current major dep OR=59.2(6.4\u2013546.6), past SA OR=39.1(1.2\u20131,244.7), arthritis OR=22.6(3.2\u2013157.3), living with children OR=0.2 Suicidal thoughts Sex, edu, religious belief, employment status, marital status, living arrangement, and family monthly income SI Dep OR=15.47 (9.76\u201324.53), lower level of edu OR=2.04 (3.31\u20131.25), community participation in the past 6 months OR=1.72 (1.07\u20132.96) Risk and Protective Factors Associated with Suicidal Ideation, Suicide Attempts, and Death by Suicide in Chinese Aging Population older adults 60+ in china Edu, marital status, economic condition SDE SD Educational level was lower (X2=16.1,P=0.001), partner-lost rate was higher(X2=5.9,P=0.015), medical cost was higher(X2=7.2,P=0.03) family income was lower(X2=10.0,P=0.02) in accident death elderly.
