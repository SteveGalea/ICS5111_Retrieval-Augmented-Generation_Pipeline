{"summary": "infection of mosquito cells can persist without detriment to the host. but infection of vertebrate cells is usually associated with cell death. SFV and Sindbis virus (SINV) are most-studied members of their genus. nsP1 induces the formation of filopodia-like structures on the plasma membranes (PMs) of infected cells. in its free form, nsP2 induces cytotoxic effects, such as shutting down cellular transcription and translation. nsP3 has been shown to localize to cytoplasmic granules. each spherule represents a site of viral RNA synthesis (24, 25), but the exact copy number, stoichiometry, and locations of different nsPs within the alphavirus RCs are unknown. the spherules are internalized via an endocytic process that requires a functional actin-myosin network. they can subsequently fuse with each other and with lysosomes of infected cells ( changes in total proteome of CHIKV-infected cells (27) or nucleolar proteome in coronavirus-infected avian cells (28, 29), to analyze changes in endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrion contacts induced by human cytomegalovirus infection (31), and to identify host proteins associated with picornavirus RNAs (32) hnRNP K has also been shown to interact with the SINV SG RNA (38), whereas another cellular protein, HuR, binds to the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of genomic and SG RNAs of SINV (39) but not CHIKV (40). genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screening identified numerous CHIKV nsP-interacting proteins (41). the isolation of membranes roughly corresponding to viral replication organelles has been achieved only for a few positive-strand RNA viruses. in both cases, more than a hundred host proteins that displayed significant increases or decreases in abundance upon virus infection were identified. 108 HeLa cells were mock infected or infected with SFV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 h p.i., medium containing infectious virus was replaced with medium containing dextran-covered magnetic nanoparticles. the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) one hour later, the cells were scraped, collected, and precipitated by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 min. the remaining cells were then removed and lysed with Laemmli lysis buffer. the remaining PNS was used for magnetic enrichment by a high-gradient magnetic separator and appropriate separation columns. each column was washed with 3 ml of PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA-PBS) the bound material was eluted with a BSA-PBS solution. in reverse setup, L-HeLa cells were infected with SFV at an MOI of 1, and H-HeLa cells were mock infected. in both setups, the cells were collected at 12 h p.i., and Mag-prot fractions were prepared. for each experiment, samples from L-HeLa and H-HeLa cells were combined at a 1:1 ratio. the gating shows the percentage of ZsGreen-positive vesicles in P15 and magnetic fractions obtained from infected cells. in panels C, D, E and F, the data from one of three reproducible experiments are shown. Flow cytometry. the samples for flow cytometry were prepared essentially as described above. the reactions were carried out at 30\u00b0C for 90 min. RNA was purified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and separated on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel. the gel was dried on a vacuum dryer. cells were denatured in urea lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and 10 mM HEPES [pH 8.0]) the proteins were reduced for 1 h at 20\u00b0C in a 1 mM dithiothreitol solution. the reaction mixture was incubated for 4 h at room temperature. the LTQ-Orbitrap Classic mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with the full scan in the Orbitrap followed by consecutive MS/MS scans in the LTQ. up to five data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired in linear ion trap for each Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) full-scan spectrum. each fragmented ion was dynamically excluded for 60 s. an online version of the STRING database was used (52) to generate a protein interaction network. the proteins were grouped according to their functions using the software program DAVID (53, 54) and the UniProtKB database (http://www.uniprot.org). the obtained VRP stocks were determined by counting the number of infected HeLa cells displaying mCherry fluorescence. the cells were grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes. at 50% confluence, they were infected with SFV or with UV-inactivated SFV at an MOI of 5. the viability and growth of transfected cells were analyzed using the xCELLigence system (Roche) to perform the luciferase activity assay, siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were infected with SFV, CHIKV, or SINV VRPs. siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were infected with SFV at 48 h p.t. at an MOI of 5. aliquots of medium were harvested; the viral titers in the collected samples were determined. 108 HeLa cells were mock infected or infected with SFV at a multiplicity of infection. at 1 h p.i., medium containing infectious virus was replaced with medium containing dextran-covered magnetic nanoparticles. one hour later, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) both samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. laemmli buffer was added to the P15 fraction obtained from one of the samples. the pelleted material from the second one was resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer supplemented with 15% glycerol. 15-synth, P15-synth, and Mag-synth probes were stored at 80\u00b0C. they were used for the analysis of SFV replication organelles. the setup used in quantitative proteomics experiments. gating shows the percentage of ZsGreen-positive vesicles in P15 and magnetic fractions obtained from infected cells. cells were infected with SFV-nsP3-ZsGreen (47) and were not separated into -prot and -synth samples. primary antibodies against nsP1, nsP3 (48), nsP2, nsP4 (3), hnRNP C (ab97541; Abcam), PCBP1 (R4030; Sigma-Aldrich), hnRNP K (ab52600; Abcam), Lamp2 (ab25631; Abcam), ATP1A1 (ab7671; Abcam), calreticulin (NB600-103; Novus RNA was purified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and separated on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel. the gel was dried on a vacuum dryer and the incorporated radioactivity was detected using a Typhoon Trio instrument (GE Healthcare). magnetic fractions from infected and mock-infected H-HeLa and L-HeLa cells were obtained as shown in Fig. 2B. electrospray ion source (Proxeon) was loaded on the self-packed fused silica emitter. the peptides were separated with a 150-min gradient from 2 to 40% of B (A, 0.5% acetic acid; B, 0.5% acetic acid\u201380% acetonitrile) the peptides were separated with a flow rate of 0.7 l/min using a flow rate of 200 nl/min. analysis was limited to peptides with a length of six or more amino acid residues and a maximum of two miscleavages. a maximum false-discovery rate of 1% was allowed at both the peptide and protein levels. an online version of the STRING database was used (52) chikV- and SINV-based replicon vectors were generated and packaged into the corresponding VRPs. chikV- and SINV-based replicon vectors, designated CHIKV-nsP3-Rluc-SG-Ffluc-2A-mCherry, were generated and packaged into the corresponding VRPs. a sample was loaded on a glass slide, covered with a cover glass. siRNA transfection and the luciferase activity assay were performed. each well received 1.5 pmol total siRNA. Val residue 226 of E1 is responsible for inefficient entry of CHIKV into HeLa cells. however, this defect does not affect replication and transcription of CHIKV-nsP3-Rluc-SG-Ffluc-2A-mCherry, lacking the corresponding region. method originally used for studies of proteins involved in endocytosis. method involves feeding cells with dextran-covered magnetic nanoparticles. these nanoparticles incorporate into lysosomes that can then be purified by magnetic isolation. SFV CPV-1s frequently contain endocytosed gold particles. ATP1A1, a PM marker, and calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker. all SFV nsPs were detected in lysate, P15-prot, and Mag-prot fractions from infected cells. the relative quantities of all ns proteins in the Mag-prot fraction were somewhat reduced. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that approximately 15 to 20% of membranous structures in the P15 fraction from SFV-nsP3-ZsGreen-infected cells were positive for ZsGreen. magnetic purification resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in their abundance. a majority of these structures could not originate with the ER or PM. magnetically purified fraction (Mag-synth) was used in the assay. a similar yield of RNA strands was also gained when the magnetically purified fraction (Mag-synth) was used. magnetic enrichment, which uses mild treatments, did not damage RNA synthesis capacity of RCs. the forward experiment was performed twice, and the reverse experiment was performed once. the cells were harvested at 12 h p.i., which corresponds to the late stage of infection when large virus replicase organelles are formed around the nucleus but cells do not show major cytopathic effects. one-third of these proteins were RNA-binding proteins. some other proteins involved in protein folding (e.g., HSP90AA1 and TCP1 ring complex), cytoskeleton (e.g., PFN1 and tubulins), and translation (Fig. 4).

SILAC-based proteomics approach is suitable for identifying cellular proteins that colocalize and/or interact with alphavirus RCs. nsP2-mediated cessation of host transcription has been shown to cause nonspecific redistribution of different RNA-binding proteins in BHK-21 cells during the late stage of SINV infection. however, no relocalization was observed for hnRNP C (67) in uninfected cells. PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K colocalize with SFV nsP3 and dsRNA. the cells were fixed at 8 h p.i., permeabilized, and probed with antibodies for dsRNA (blue) and SFV replicase (anti-nsP3; red) SFV-infected and mock-infected cells were fixed at 8 h p.i., permeabilized, and probed with antibodies for Lamp2 and SFV replicase (anti-nsP3; red) cells were also probed with anti-PCBP1 (A), anti-hnRNP M (B), anti-hnRNP C (C), or anti-hnRNP K (D) antibodies. this migration does not reveal the functional significance of BP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K were performed using HeLa cells at 48 h p.t. Fig 7. Effects of PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K silencing on SFV replicon vector. hnRNP K specifically binds to SG but not genomic SINV RNA. PCBP1 silencing resulted in an approximately 2-fold reduction in Rluc and Ffluc expression throughout the experiment. expression levels increased approximately 3-fold and 5-fold in hnRNP M- and hnRNP C-silenced cells. hnRNP C silencing accelerated SFV multiplication and increased the final SFV titers 3- to 4-fold. by 6 h p.i., the titer of virus released from the cells transfected with the corresponding siRNAs was approximately four times higher than the titer obtained from control siRNA-transfected cells. these data are consistent with the prominent effect that silencing those proteins has on SFV replicon-mediated protein RNA-transfected cells at 4 h p.i. were taken as 1 (1). the experiment was repeated three times; data from one representative experiment are shown. expression of reporter proteins depend on virus entry, viral RNA synthesis, and protein translation. the effects of hnRNP C silencing were similar except that no effect on RNA replication was detected at 4 or 6 h p.i. this discrepancy is most likely attributable to the higher sensitivity of the reporter-based assay when performed using a low MOI. RCs and CPV-1s, as well as the pathways used for the biogenesis of RCs and CPV-1s, are similar between SFV and SINV (24, 25) the sets of host proteins that interact or colocalize with the SFV replicases also clearly overlap (Table 1). however, these observations do not unequivocally indicate that all cellular factors affect the infection cycles of different alphaviruses in the same manner. hnRNP K silencing on CHIKV and SINV infection was opposite to that observed for SFV. PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K silencing affects CHIKV and SINV replicons. a method originally used for studies of proteins involved in endocytosis (59) could be used to isolate functional viral replication organelles. this method involves feeding cells with dextran-covered magnetic nanoparticles, which incorporate into lysosomes that can then be purified by magnetic isolation. SFV CPV-1s frequently contain endocytosed gold particles if the particles are introduced into the growth medium after infection. approximately 15% of lysosomes were captured using magnetic enrichment. at the same time, this fraction was clearly depleted of the Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-1 subunit (ATP1A1), a PM marker, and calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER marker) all of the SFV nsPs were detected in lysate, P15-prot, and Mag-prot fractions from infected fluorescence microscopy of magnetically purified samples revealed that the obtained membranous structures had a vesicular appearance. more than half of vesicles from SFV-nsP3-ZsGreen-infected cells were positive for ZsGreen. magnetic purification resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in their abundance. RNA synthesis assay performed in presence of [-32P]CTP. no reduction in RNA synthesis was detected. magnetic enrichment was faster than ultracentrifugation-based fractionation. reciprocal experiments were performed using heavy (H) and light (L) HeLa cells. in the forward experiment, H-HeLa cells were infected and L-HeLa cells were mock infected. in the reverse experiment, L-HeLa cells were infected and H-HeLa cells were mock infected. in the reverse experiment, the cells were harvested at 12 h p.i. seventy-eight proteins met all of our criteria. one-third of these proteins were RNA-binding proteins. some other proteins involved in protein folding (e.g., HSP90AA1 and TCP1 ring complex), cytoskeleton (e.g., PFN1 and tubulins), and translation (Fig. 4).

RNA-binding proteins colocalize with SFV replication organelles. nsP2-mediated cessation of host transcription has been shown to cause nonspecific redistribution of different RNA-binding proteins. a small but clearly detectable protein fraction was present in the cytoplasm. the protein almost exclusively colocalized with dsRNA and SFV nsP3. the only exception was PCBP1, which was also detected in granule-like structures that were not colocalized with SFV nsP3 or dsRNAs. images were obtained using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. one optical slice is shown at each panel. white bars, 5 m. Fig 6. Colocalization of PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K with lysosomal marker Lamp2 and SFV replicase. transfection with control siRNA did not affect the protein levels. none of the siRNA mixtures had cytotoxic effects on the transfected cells. all subsequent experiments aimed at revealing the effects of reduced levels of PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K on SFV replicon vector. the SFV-nsP3-Rluc-SG-Ffluc replicons used in this assay expressed Rluc fused to nsP3 from genomic RNA and Ffluc from mRNAs synthesized from the SG promoter. this replicon design was chosen because hnRNP K specifically binds to SG but not genomic SINV RNA. hnRNP M or hnRNP C silencing significantly increased the amounts hnRNP M silencing accelerated SFV multiplication and increased the final SFV titers 3- to 4-fold. effects of hnRNP C silencing on viral multiplication could not be detected using the one-step growth curve assay. the results of quantification were normalized to the amount of genomic RNAs in control siRNA-transfected cells at 4 h p.i., which was taken as 1 (1). the experiment was repeated three times; data from one representative experiment are shown. the expression of reporter proteins (Fig. 7B) and the release of infectious virus progeny depend on virus entry, viral RNA synthesis, and protein translation. PCBP1-silenced cells at 4 h p.i. whereas silencing of hnRNP K expression resulted in a slight activation of SFV replication at both 4 and 6 h p.i. hnRNP M silencing was similar except that no effect on RNA replication was detected at 4 or 6 h p.i. SFV belongs to the same serogroup as CHIKV, whereas SINV belongs to a different serogroup (1). RCs and CPV-1s are similar between SFV and SINV (24, 25) the sets of host proteins that colocalize with the SFV replicases also overlap. hnRNP K silencing affects CHIKV and SINV infection in the same way as SFV. hnRNP K was found to function as an activator for CHIKV and SINV infections. hnRNP K silencing affects CHIKV and SINV replicons. viruses require the engagement of factors encoded by the host. a large fraction of the host proteins subverted is unique to each virus. changes in protein levels in cellular compartments are more likely to occur if a protein is involved in virus replication. itation experiments with viruses expressing tagged nsP3 (35) however, there is only a small overlap between the lists of host proteins that bind nsP2 identified by pull-down (36) or genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screening (41). this discrepancy is common for most if not all viruses (34) and indicates that neither of the approaches identifies all of the players that are important for virus-host interactions. magnetic isolation has an advantage over ultracentrifugation-based separation. lysosomes would not be present in purified samples unless they fuse with endosomes formed after the addition of magnetic beads. this method resulted in rapid and efficient purification of organelles that contain SFV ns proteins. in a very recent study of the total proteome of CHIKV-infected cells, only 8 cellular proteins were found to be upregulated while 37 were downregulated (27). however, changes in the total proteome of infected cells and those in cellular compartments converted to virus replication organelles are different. several proteins identified by this approach have been previously shown to be associated with SINV replication. the 13 analyzed proteins affected viral replication, and these proteins altered viral replication by less than 2.5-fold (46). we cannot rule out the possibility that the proteins studied here had strong effects on alphavirus infection by pure chance or due to the specific selection of RNA-binding proteins. many host RNA-binding proteins that are important for positive-strand RNA virus replication have natural functions unrelated to viral RNA synthesis (82, 83) in uninfected cells, PCBP1 and PCBP2 localize to nuclei, where they regulate splicing and mRNA stability (83), and these proteins are also found in processing bodies (68). these proteins have been thoroughly studied in the context of PV infection. silencing of hnRNP C has positive effects on viral RNA synthesis. hnRNP C silencing reduced the synthesis of reporter proteins expressed from genomic and SG RNAs of the SFV replicon but failed to affect or only minimally affected viral RNA synthesis. hnRNP M and hnRNP C are factors that restrict alphavirus replication. this finding parallels the results of a recent study by Cristea et al. hnRNPs harbor a wide spectrum of functions, ranging from the regulation of mRNA transcription to the regulation of mRNA localization. despite common structural elements, each hnRNP displays different functions. despite common structural elements, each hnRNP displays different functions. supplementary material Supplemental material supp_87_18_10295___index.html (800B, html)."}
