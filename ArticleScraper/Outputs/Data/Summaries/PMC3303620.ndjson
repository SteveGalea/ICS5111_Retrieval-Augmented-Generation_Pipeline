{"summary": "infected cells were transfected with plasmids or linear DNA fragments containing a selection marker flanked by sequences homologous to the target locus. this process allowed the deletion or mutation of the gene of interest in the virus genome. however, purification of resulting recombinant viruses was laborious. a number of methods have been developed that allow the generation of virtually any mutation in a virus genome. within a few days, genes or sequence elements can be removed. luciferase reporter genes can be inserted which allows tracking of the virus in live animals. mutagenesis techniques can be used for the removal of the mini-F from viral genomes upon reconstitution in eukaryotic cells. a transfer vector is generated that harbors the mini-F cassette flanked by sequences identical to the insertion site in the virus genome. a method previously published by Hirt (1967) uses fractionated precipitation with SDS and NaCl to separate viral from cellular DNA. resulting linearized DNA may be removed by incubation with -exonuclease, an enzyme that exclusively digests linear DNA, leaving circular DNA intact. this approach allows an enrichment of circular virus DNA, and BAC-containing bacteria are selected using antibiotic resistance genes present in the mini-F backbone. the mini-F replicon can be inserted into herpesvirus genomes by direct ligation [29] for this purpose, concatemeric virus DNA is isolated from infected-cells and cleaved with a restriction enzyme that cuts only in a single locus within the virus genome. the resulting full-length viral genome is then ligated with a linearized mini-F vector containing compatible DNA ends. xviruses do not produce a circular form of the virus genome during replication. this poses a major hurdle for the transfer of the recombinant poxvirus constructs into E. coli. infected cells are treated with isatin--thiosemicarbazone that promotes accumulation of nonresolved genomic concatemers. expression of viral genomic RNA can be facilitated by cellular RNA polymerase II under the control of the major immediate-early promoter of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) a T7 promoter can be employed to drive the expression of viral RNA, where T7 polymerase is either stably expressed in the cell line used for virus reconstitution or delivered in trans by transfection or using vaccinia virus as a delivery vehicle. a transfer vector is generated that harbors the mini-F cassette flanked by sequences identical to the insertion site in the virus genome. a recombination event is either transfected into virus-infected cells or is co-transfected with virus genomic DNA. cells producing recombinant viruses can be visualized by fluorescent markers such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) BAC clones are routinely analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to ensure the integrity of the virus genome. the insertion site of the mini-F is sequenced to determine if mutations that are present may have occurred in the recombination process. the cost of high-throughput sequencing has dropped dramatically. ligation and transformation procedures for large BAC vectors are very inefficient. but unlike herpesviruses, poxviruses do not produce a circular form of the virus genome during replication. this poses a major hurdle for transfer of the recombinant poxvirus constructs into E. coli. viral RNA is isolated from infected cells and cDNA synthesized using reverse transcriptase. full-length genomic cDNA can be purified by gel electrophoresis. fragments of the genome can be transcribed into cDNA and combined by ligation to obtain a complete virus genome. transfection into susceptible cells of viral RNA transcribed in vitro usually allows virus reconstitution. cDNA clones of viral RNA segments are combined into a BAC vector. BACs available for members of Various herpesvirus Families 3.1. koi herpesvirus and channel catfish herpesvirus have been cloned into mini-F vectors. BAC systems are available for at least 27 herpesvirus species that infect hosts as diverse as fish, birds, and humans. for many of these herpesviruses, several strains have been cloned as BACs. herpes simplex virus 2 HSV-2 human herpesvirus 2 155 kbp [21] Herpesvirus of turkey HVT Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 160 kbp [22] Marek's disease virus MDV Gallid herpesvirus 2 178 kbp [23] Pseudorabies virus PRV Suid herpesvirus 1 142 kbp [24] Simian varicella virus SV several full-length poxvirus genomes of the genus Orthopoxvirus have been cloned into BAC vectors. the first BAC construct was generated for the vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve. one for its more virulent parental strain, chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara. cloning of cDNA sequences into expression vectors allows maintenance and manipulation of the RNA virus genomes. however, in case of large nonsegmented RNA viruses, the capacity of regular plasmids is often not sufficient. cDNAs of several nonsegmented viruses were inserted into mini-F vectors. common species names, corresponding acronyms, taxon names, genome sizes, and references for the first BAC construct of every species are given. in 1997, the first virus BAC system was developed for the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), one of the largest herpesviruses with a genome size of 230 kbp [14] BAC systems are available for at least 27 herpesvirus species that infect hosts as diverse as fish, birds, and humans. for many of these herpesviruses, several strains have been cloned as BACs, allowing the maintenance and manipulation of laboratory strains.

BAC Mutagenesis One major advantage of virus BAC systems is the availability of well-established genetic tools that allow random and specific modifications of the virus genome in E. coli. the integration of Tn is mediated by the transposase (tnpA) and resolvase (tnpR) gene products of the transposon system. transposons such as Tn1721 have been developed with a strong preference for circular DNA. long homologous sequences of 500 bp to 3 kbp are required for recombination events. however, as repetitive sequences are present in many viruses, RecA expression can lead to rapid destabilization of viral BAC clones. for this reason, BACs are usually maintained in RecA-deficient E. coli strains. Negative selection markers can be used to suppress nonresolved BAC clones. rspL [65], sacB [66] and tetR [67] can be used to suppress nonresolved BAC clones. a shuttle plasmid is inserted into the target sequence via recombination of homologous sequences. red and recE/T recombination systems are targeted for mutagenesis. pKD46 can be cured from bacteria by its temperature-sensitive replication mechanism. pKD46 can be cured from bacteria by its temperature-sensitive replication mechanism. the red or RecE/T mutagenesis system usually uses PCR products that contain a positive selection marker. the short homologous sequences needed for targeted insertion can readily be inserted by 5\u2032 overhangs of the primers used for PCR amplification. the PCR products are then electroporated into E. coli that harbor the desired BAC construct. expression plasmids can be used to transiently express the recombinases. alternatively, a number of E. coli strains, such as EL250 and EL350, harbor an inducible form of the cre or flp gene in the chromosome are available. galK converts 2-deoxy-galactose to a toxic metabolite, 2-deoxy-galactose-1-phosphate. this property is used in the second recombination step. two other two-way selection markers, thyA and tolC, can be used in bacteria lacking the corresponding gene product. a positive selection marker is amplified by PCR using primers with 30 to 50 bp extensions that are homologous to the target site in the BAC. this PCR product is electroporated into recombination-competent bacteria that harbor the BAC clone. the resistance gene cassette remains in the BAC and cannot be used for the mutagenesis of a second locus in the construct. en passant mutagenesis can be used for consecutive modifications of any locus in a BAC construct. one approach uses a transfer construct that contains the soi and a positive selection marker flanked again by two loxP or FRT recognition sites. the selection marker can be removed by the induction of the Flp or Cre recombinase. a transfer construct is generated by the insertion of a positive selection marker, an adjacent I-SceI site, and a sequence duplication into a unique restriction site within the soi. the sequence duplications allow a second Red recombination resulting in the removal of all operational sequences [6, 77]. Existing transfer constructs can be used for the insertion of soi into any target sequence. en passant mutagenesis is an alternative technique that allows sequence editing of the target site. the selection marker cassette with an adjacent I-SceI is amplified by PCR using primers that contain homologous sequences for the insertion into the target sequence. the desired modifications are included in the center of the duplicated sequences present within primers used for PCR amplification of the selectable marker cassette. transposons such as Tn1721 have been developed with a strong preference for circular DNA. the phenotype of mutagenized, BAC-derived viruses can be subsequently analyzed and can be used for genome-wide screens. recombinase is only transiently expressed during the mutagenesis procedure. the system makes use of vectors that harbor the desired modifications flanked by sequences homologous to the target site in the BAC construct. the plasmid regularly harbors a positive and negative selection marker. a shuttle plasmid containing a temperature sensitive origin is repressed by a temperature increase to 42\u00b0C. negative selection markers can be used to select BAC constructs that lost the shuttle plasmid. the system allows the insertion of short and long sequences that can be used for the development of vector vaccines. two systems utilize double-strand DNA (dsDNA) ends as substrate for the recombination reaction. the first component is the Gam protein that protects dsDNA ends from degradation in bacteria. the last component is the single-strand binding protein Beta or RecT. uses PCR products that contain a positive selection marker and sequences homologous to the target site in the BAC construct. the PCR products are then electroporated into E. coli that harbor the desired BAC construct. mutagenesis techniques have been developed that often combine Red or RecE/T with other recombination systems. a red recombination cassette is inserted into the target site. resulting clones are selected for the presence of the positive selection marker. illegitimate recombination events removing the counterselection marker can result in many false positive clones. two other two-way selection markers, thyA and tolC, can be used in bacteria lacking the corresponding gene product. the method is based on the insertion of a positive selection marker cassette with an adjacent 18 bp I-SceI restriction site. the resulting dsDNA ends of the BAC serve as a substrate for a second Red recombination of duplicated sequences. the PCR product is electroporated into recombination-competent bacteria. resistance gene cassette remains in the BAC and cannot be used for the mutagenesis of a second locus in the construct. en passant mutagenesis can be used for consecutive modifications of any locus in a BAC construct. one approach uses a transfer construct that contains the soi and a positive selection marker flanked again by two loxP or FRT recognition sites. the construct is inserted into the target site by Red recombination. sequence duplications allow a second Red recombination resulting in the removal of all operational sequences. existing transfer constructs can be used for the insertion of soi into any target sequence. the advantage of the techniques described in this section is that they allow the removal of selection marker. alternative technique allows sequence editing of target site is en passant mutagenesis. selection marker with adjacent I-SceI is amplified by PCR using primers that contain homologous sequences for the insertion into the target sequence and duplications for the removal of the marker cassette. s from transfected BAC DNA can be dependent on the presence of T7 polymerase that is provided to the transfected cell in trans. this can have negative effects on virus replication as the additional mini-F sequences might challenge the packaging capacity of the herpesvirus capsid [87] homologous sequences in the repair vector can recombine with sequences up- and downstream of the mini-F resulting in the removal of all vector sequences. bacterial plaques that lost the mini-F sequences can be detected by the loss of visual markers encoded in the mini-F. antiparallel duplication allows stable maintenance and modification of the BAC in E. coli. mini-F sequences are completely removed from the virus genome by two intra- or intermolecular recombination events facilitated by recombinases in eukaryotic cells. recombinant virus can be reconstituted by transfection of purified virus BAC DNA or in vitro transcribed RNA into susceptible eukaryotic cells. uses the Cre/loxP or FLP/FRT recombination system. for removal of the mini-F sequences, loxP or FRT sites are inserted at either end of the mini-F sequences. Upon transfection, Cre or FLP facilitates removal of the mini-F sequences. removal of mini-F via Duplications Another method that allows complete removal of the mini-F replicon uses sequence duplications that are inserted into the virus genome. an intramolecular recombination event during virus DNA replication allows the removal of all bacterial sequences, thus restoring the original insertion locus in the virus. well-established mutagenesis techniques described in this paper facilitate a site-specific manipulation of the virus genome in E. coli. several strategies can be used to introduce any desired modification."}
