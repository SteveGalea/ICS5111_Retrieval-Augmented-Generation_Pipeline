{"summary": "2 speckled seals (Phoca hispida), a 1-year-old male seal and 1.5-year-old female seal, were found displaying neurologic signs (backward head) the rest of the seals were raised in the same pools and fed a diet of frozen smashed fish. cubated with the fourth passage of brain homogenate showed cytopathic effect (F) and fluorescence (H), indicating the presence of JEV antigen. many mature virions and proliferative vesicles were observed in the endoplasmic reticulum of JEV-infected cells (J) we cultured cells in Dulbecco-modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. we observed cytopathic effects (cell swelling and detachment, intercellular space dilatation) with the fourth passage of brain homogenate supernatant (Figure 1, panels E, F) we obtained the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR sequences using the 5\u2032 RACE and 3\u2032 RACE Systems for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends kits. the complete genome sequence of JEV Seal-Anheal-2017 was 10,965 nt in length, encoding a 10,299-nt single open reading frame flanked by a 96-nt 5\u2032 UTR. we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the E gene sequence of Seal-Anheal-2017 with those of 24 JEV strains of different genotypes. results showed that Seal-Anheal-2017 grouped with genotype I, sharing the highest nucleotide sequence homology (99.09%) with XJ69. isolate from a seal with lethal encephalitis, china, 2017 compared with 24 JEV strains of different genotypes and species origins. we constructed the tree using the neighbor-joining method and MEGA5.05 (https://www.megasoftware.net). Reliability of the branching orders was evaluated by the bootstrap test. pig farms are located several miles away from the aquarium. wild pigs had never been reported in the area. the virus might have been transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes."}
