{"summary": "mouse (Mus musculus) G6PD shows the highest homology (93%) compared with human (Homo sapiens) G6PD, followed by zebrafish (Danio rerio, 74%), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster, 61%), nematode (C. elegans, 56%), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 45%), and bacteria (Escherichia coli RNAi knockdown technique was employed to inhibit endogenous G6PD expression. by measuring G6PD status, mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity in G6PD-RNAi knockdown (Gi) C. elegans. g6pd mRNA level (relative to ef-1:elongation factor 1) was determined by real-time PCR. g6pd activity was measured by enzymatic assay and protein expression was determined by western blot (inlet) G6PD knockdown enhances oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage in C. elegans. fluorescence of G6PD-RNAi knockdown (Gi) C. elegans was subtracted by background and normalized with mock. a majority of eggs produced by Gi C. elegans were unable to hatch compared with mock (10% of mock, P0.005, n=60) this dramatic observation is consistent with a previous report that G6PD knockdown induces embryonic lethality in C. elegans. cIs39 mock (3.7 per gonad, n=60) demonstrates that reduction of G6PD increases germ cell apoptosis. high oxidative stress has been associated with reduced brood size in C. elegans. the total egg production was significantly reduced in mock and Gi C. elegans compared with untreated control (72% of mock control, P=0.013 and 67% of Gi control, P=0.022, respectively) no significant difference was found in the second half of egg-laying period. bar represents egg production from day 3 to day 4 post-treatment. ##P0.005 indicate significant difference compared with untreated mock. the egg production was determined in mock, g6pd(RNAi), mek-1 and mek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutants. #P0.05 indicates significant difference compared with untreated G6PD-knockdown C. elegans. the egg production of the mek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant was indistinguishable to that of Gi C. elegans (P=0.471, n=60). the egg production of the mek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant was indistinguishable to that of Gi C. elegans (P=0.471, n=60). cep-1, pmk-1, mek-1, sek-1 mutants and their double mutants with G6PD-RNAi knockdown (Gi) C. elegans High degree of conservation in G6PD gene from nematode to human G6PD is ubiquitously present. elegans G6PD shows high degree of conservation with other G6PD homologues. asterisk represents fully conserved residues, colon represents conservation between groups of strongly similar properties. RNAi knockdown technique was employed to inhibit endogenous G6PD expression. G6PD knockdown in mock C. elegans is reproducible in the generation of a viable G6PD-deficient animal model. g6pd mRNA level was determined by real-time PCR. oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage were determined. 8-OHdG level was significantly increased in Gi C. elegans compared to mock (1.5-fold, P=0.005, N=6). this finding is consistent with a previous report in G6PD-deficient cell model. the brood size derived from the first generation of Gi hermaphrodite was significantly reduced. this finding indicates that G6PD is required for maintaining normal egg production. majority of eggs produced by Gi C. elegans were unable to hatch compared with mock (10% of mock, P0.005, n=60) the number of apoptotic germ cells in bcIs39 Gi C. elegans was significantly increased by 2-fold (7.4 per gonad, P=0.04, n=80) compared with bcIs39 mock (3.7 per gonad, n=60) reduction of G6PD increases germ cell apoptosis. at 5 mM H2O2, the total egg production of mock and Gi C. elegans was not significantly affected compared with untreated control. no significant difference was found in the second half of egg-laying period (day 3 to day 4). the black bar represents egg production from day 1 to day 2 post-treatment. the white bar represents egg production from day 3 to day 4 post-treatment. the stack bar represents total egg production post-treatment. the egg production was determined in mock, g6pd(RNAi), sek-1 and sek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutants. the egg production was determined in mock, g6pd(RNAi), mek-1 and mek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutants. sek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant showed further decrease of egg production (42% of Gi C. elegans, P0.001, n=70) also, the egg production of the mek-1 mutant was indistinguishable to that of Gi C. elegans (P=0.471, n=60) k-1 and mek-1 play essential roles in the modulation of hatching in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans embryos. the hatching was determined in mock, cep-1, pmk-1, mek-1, sek-1 mutants and their double mutants. the low hatching of eggs from G6PD-knockdown C. elegans provides strong evidence to the notion that G6PD is indispensable for embryonic survival in C. elegans. however, the underlying mechanism on how G6PD status affects embryonic survival is largely unknown. in the current study, short-term H2O2 enhances germ cell apoptosis in mock C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner. however, the fact that H2O2 cannot further enhance germ cell apoptosis in G6PD-deficient C. elegans suggests that it may be due to the buildup of endogenous oxidative stress in the oocytes that enhances germ cell apoptosis. decreased NADPH reduces the activity of a yet to be identified sensor. decreased production of sensor-derived ROS activates mek-1 or sek-1 through negative regulation. loss of function of mek-1 or sek-1 negates deleterious effects on hatching due to G6PD deficiency in C. elegans p53 (cep-1) and MAPK pathways. p38 MAPK pathway is associated with diverse cellular functions, including immunity, apoptosis, stress response, and cell fate determination. the nsy-1-sek-1 cascade of p38 MAPK signaling is essential in the environmental response in C. elegans. a recently identified NADPH sensor is shown to negatively regulate NF-B function. a dual oxidase-derived oxidative burst is essential for extracellular matrix modification of sea urchin eggs during fertilization. p38 and ERK/MAPK have been shown to block bovine preimplantation embryogenesis. the parental G6PD-knockdown C. elegans is viable and shows no major growth defect. the parental G6PD-knockdown C. elegans is viable and shows no major
