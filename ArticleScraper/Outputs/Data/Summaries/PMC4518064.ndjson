{"summary": "introduction Doxycycline (doxy) is a second-generation tetracycline antibiotic approved for use in the united states since 1967. it can be used to treat intracellular infections as diverse as Plasmodium falciparum, Chlamydia spp., and Mycoplasma spp. Cefovecin, Convenia (Zoetis, Inc.), a cephalosporin formulation that lasts for 2 weeks, has found wide use in companion animals. nonhuman primates do not reabsorb this drug in the kidney. nonhuman primates do not reabsorb this drug in the kidney, and its half-life is not extended in these species. liposomes have long been studied as a drug delivery system. variations in liposome composition, formation, and loading methodology may lead to strikingly different drug concentrations and release kinetics for a particular drug. rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized with intracardiac injection of commercially available euthanasia solution. blood collection and injection of drugs were performed under isoflurane anesthesia administered via facemask to effect. doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of either 33 or 8.25 mg/ml. 250 l was added to the lipid swelled in sulfuric acid, followed by 53.6 l of 5 M NaOH in 1 M citrate buffer. liposomes prepared from DPPC and cholesterol were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959) the plate was developed in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide 65:25:4 v/v/v. the plate was dried and stained with iodine vapor. a 3-cc syringe and a 22-gauge needle were used to draw 0.5-ml blood samples from the ventral tail artery. blood was placed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing glass shards to provide a nidus for clot formation and retraction. blood was drawn prior to injection from each of the 17 rats. sample or standard was added to a 0.4-ml internal standard solution. the processed samples were vortexed for 5 seconds and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 15,000g. the mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in deionized water (A) and acetonitrile (B) the tissue standard curve was accepted if the measured concentration in at least four out of six standards was within 15% of the actual concentration. Approximately 1 g of tissue was weighed within 0.02 g and added to the internal standard solution (500 ng/ml oxytetracycline final concentration) the homogenates were vortexed and held for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. the fixed tissue was cut, placed in cassettes, and placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin until processed. the pathologist reading the slides was blinded to the group and origin of the tissues. cells were allowed to adhere to 24-well plates for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C. doxy was determined by two methods, colony-forming unit counts were taken at 24 and 48 hours. cells were stained with propidium iodide for fluorescence microscopy counts. the total cells and infected cells were counted at 24 and 48 hours. all blood collection and injection of drugs were performed under isoflurane anesthesia administered via facemask to effect. four weeks after drug injection, rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized with an intracardiac injection of commercially available euthanasia solution. sterile water at a concentration of either 33 or 8.25 mg/ml was added to the lipid swelled in sulfuric acid, followed by 53.6 l of 5 M NaOH in 1 M citrate buffer. a single tube of liposomes was loaded either on a rotating shaker for 24 hours at 22\u00b0C or in a water bath at 55\u00b0C for 1 hour. the plate was developed in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide 65:25:4 v/v/v. the developed plate was dried and stained with iodine vapor. blood was placed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube to provide a nidus for clot formation and retraction and was centrifuged. blood samples were drawn prior to injection from each of the 17 rats administered STD-doxy. the mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in deionized water (A) and acetonitrile (B) the mobile phase gradient started at 100% A from 0 to 0.5 minutes, with a linear gradient to 40% A at 3.5 minutes, followed by a linear gradient to 100% A at 4.5 minutes, with a total run time of 6.5 minutes. the homogenates were vortexed and held for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. two milliliters of 20% trichloroacetic acid solution were added to the homogenate and vortexed. then it was sonicated for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 2500g for 20 minutes. the sample or standard was loaded with 2.5-ml 5% methanol in deionized water. cells were seeded into 24-well culture plates at a density of 1.8 105 cells/well. cells were allowed to adhere to plates for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. cells were overlaid with the same medium supplemented with different concentrations of either STD or DPPC LE-doxy. idium iodide for fluorescence microscopy counts. total cells and infected cells were counted at 24 and 48 hours. plates were not counted if microscopic growth was so heavy. a mixture of 80 mol 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or 80 mol sphingomyelin (sphing) and 40 mol cholesterol was dried by removing chloroform, dissolved in 1 ml of sterile tert-butanol. a 250-l aliquot was dispensed into each of the four separate tubes. a single tube of liposomes was loaded either on a rotating shaker for 24 hours at 22\u00b0C or in a water bath at 55\u00b0C for 1 hour. the liposomes were diluted in 4 ml of normal saline (Baxter International, Deerfield, IL), sedimented at 1000g for 10 minutes in a centrifuge. an aliquot of the liposome suspension was suspended in 0.9% w/v NaCl cellulose dialysis tubing was prepared by boiling in three changes of EDTA and sodium carbonate. tubing was rinsed in distilled water and stored in 30% ethanol at 5\u00b0C. blood samples were drawn from each of the 17 rats administered STD-doxy. blood samples were drawn at 1 hour and 4, 8, and 24 hours. rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia and were monitored until awake. the mobile phase gradient started at 100% A from 0 to 0.5 minutes. a linear gradient to 40% A at 3.5 minutes followed by a linear gradient to 100% A at 4.5 minutes. separation was achieved at 40\u00b0C with a 50 2.1 mm 5 M column. two milliliters of 20% trichloroacetic acid solution were added to the homogenate and vortexed, followed by 10 ml of citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 4) then it was sonicated for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 2500g for 20 minutes. the sample or standard was loaded, the SPE cartridges were washed with 2.5-ml 5% methanol in deionized water, and 1.25 ml of 1 cells were seeded into 24-well culture plates at a density of 1.8 105 cells/well. cells were allowed to adhere to plates for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. treatments were done in triplicate, and medium without the drug was used as a control. the microplate Alamar blue assay was used to determine the efficacy of STD and DPPC LE-doxy in a cell-free system as a comparison. the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the serum and liver concentrations of doxy and to compare cell counts and numbers of colony-forming units. a doxycycline concentration of either 8.25 or 33 mg/ml was added to the liposome mixture. the DPPC LE-doxy made with 8.25 mg/ml leaked less than 45% of the loaded doxy at the 100-hour time point. the DPPC LE-doxy made using 8.25 mg/ml leaked less than 45% of the loaded doxy at the 100-hour time point. in vitro leakage of liposomes loaded with 33 mg/ml doxy (squares) or 8.25 mg/ml doxy (diamonds) in DPPC-cholesterol liposomes. time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 1 hour for DPPC, sphing, and STD-doxy. the plateau concentrations for DPPC and sphing LE-doxy were 0.2 g/ml. rats were administered STD-doxy at 5 mg/kg (circles), DPPC LE-doxy (squares), or sphing LE-doxy (triangles) at 50 mg. blood samples were taken before injection for control and from 1 to 336 hours (14 days) after injection. serum was separated, removed, and stored at 20\u00b0C until assayed. the pathologist who evaluated the samples (R.S.) was blinded to the group assignments. skin samples were classified as having no lesions, histiocytosis, or miscellaneous inflammation. noninjected 2/8 (25) 0/8 (0) 1/8 (12.5) DPPC Injected 0/14 (0)a,b 5/14 (35.7) 2/14 (14.3) Noninjected 3/14 (21)c 0/14 (0) 5/14 (35.7) Sphing

includes foamy cytoplasm of histiocytes with intensely stained nuclei (D, arrow), and accumulation of histiocytes was not limited to any one group of liposome-injected rats. the two rats administered standard doxy that had grossly visible inflammatory lesions in the first week postinjection did not have any lesions apparent during collection at 4 weeks postinjection. the untreated control wells grew to 600,000 J774A.1 cells after doxy was noncytotoxic to uninfected J774A.1 macrophage cells (A and B) and M. smegmatis\u2013infected J774A.1 macrophage cells (C and D) at 24 (A and C) and 48 (B and D) hours after culture. black bars indicate STD-doxy, and gray bars indicate LE-doxy. there were no live cells left in the wells containing 1 g/ml STD-doxy or in the 0 g/ml control at 48 hours. there were significantly more live-infected cells in the wells containing 2 g/ml STD-doxy compared with 2 g/ml STD-doxy. the negative control and concentrations from 1 to 16 g/ml STD or DPPC LE-doxy had between 10 and 20% in MIC 90 for intracellular M. smegmatis in the J774A.1 cells of both STD and DPPC LE-doxy was 2 g/ml. MIC 90 for intracellular M. smegmatis was 16 g/ml. the optimal concentration of doxy loaded into the DPPC liposomes was obtained using 4 ml of 8.25 mg/ml doxy loaded into liposomes containing 3.0 M sulfuric acid loaded for 24 hours at 22\u00b0C. the average percentage capture (n = 3) was 43.87. a doxycycline concentration of either 8.25 or 33 mg/ml was added to the liposome mixture. the DPPC LE-doxy made with 8.25 mg/ml leaked less than 45% of the loaded doxy at the 100-hour time point. both LE-doxy in DPPC and sphing would make viable preparations to perform initial pharmacokinetics studies in rats. after injection, time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 1 hour for DPPC, sphing, and STD-doxy. the MRT of DPPC was highest at 111.78 hours, followed by sphing (56.00 hours) and STD-doxy (6.86 hours).

STD-doxy has a bioavailability of over 80%. mice infected with Chlamydia trachomatis received intramuscular injections of cationic liposomal doxy for 30 days using a 10 g/ml solution. the Cmax was 218.75 g/ml at 48 hours (sera), 18.25 g/ml at 24 hours (liver) and 2.3 g/ml at 12 hours (genital organs) we found few statistically significant differences between the groups. we concluded that the LE-doxy preparations were safe to be given at a dose of 50 mg/kg s.c. in rats. the values obtained reflect the expected substantial size of liposomes made by this method. macrophage-origin cells took more than 24 hours to phagocytize enough liposomes to have a maximum effect: cytotoxicity in the case of clodronate and bacterial killing in the case of doxy. DPPC LE-doxy is effective against cell-associated infection with M. smegmatis for a longer period of time than STD-doxy. two novel formulations of LE-doxy reached measurable and potentially effective concentrations."}
