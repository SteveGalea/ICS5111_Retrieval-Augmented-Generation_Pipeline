{"summary": "ribosomes and initiation and termination factors are designed for accurate interpretation of these signals. some animal virus mRNAs contain RNA structures that direct the assembly of a translation-competent ribosome without the need for a complete set of initiation factors or a 5\u2032 cap. frameshift element in mRNA consists of a slippery sequence upstream of the stop codon and a secondary structure in close proximity to the slippery sequence (23, 29, 44) other retroviruses, including the feline and murine leukemia viruses, utilize stop codon suppression (43, 54, 55) a two-hybrid library of mouse cDNAs derived from NIH 3T3 cells fused to the Gal4 activation domain (3) was tested in a three-hybrid screen described previously (4). the RNA bridge consisted of the MoMLV pseudoknot (PK) RNA fused to the MS2 phage RNA stem-loop. cells were transfected with 1 g of reporter DNA and 1, 3, or 6 g ribosomal protein expression vector. all transfections were adjusted with empty vector DNA to contain the same total amount of DNA per well. dual-luciferase assays were performed with a Promega dual-luciferase kit. luciferase signal, \u201cwild-type\u201d represents signals from expression of plasmids containing the native recoding sequence and \u201ccontrol\u201d represents signals from plasmids designed to eliminate recoding elements. plasmids were designed to eliminate recoding elements and allow maximum expression of both luciferases. cDNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with a superscript III first-strand synthesis kit for RT-PCR. assays were run on a 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) 293T cells were transfected with 1 g pNCS DNA and a complete MoMLV provirus. Western blots were probed with mouse anti-Flag and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody. a two-hybrid library of mouse cDNAs derived from NIH 3T3 cells fused to the Gal4 activation domain (3) was tested in a three-hybrid screen. cell lysates from transfections were transferred to opaque 96-well plates. for transfections done in the 96-well format, cells were lysed with 20 l passive lysis buffer. 20 l from each well was transferred to opaque 96-well plates. assays were read on a Berthold or Omega plate reader using 100 l of luciferase reagent. values from each interval of firefly and Renilla luciferase were summed in the Omega Mars data analysis program. myc-tagged ribosomal proteins and human cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1-myc-His-A and pFlag-2 M. cloning was completed using sequence and ligation-independent cloning protocols adapted from reference 34. natants by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose\u2013phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-55 rotor for 2 h. protein levels of cell lysates were normalized by a Bradford assay. Western blots were probed with mouse anti-CA monoclonal antibody. screen tethers an RNA bridge to the reporter gene via a LexA binding protein fusion. the RNA bridge consisted of the pseudoknot fused to tandem MS2 coat protein binding sites expressed in plasmid pIIIA/MS2-2. the DNA was introduced into yeast strain L40-coat. plasmid contained the same moMLV sequence with a glutamine codon replacing the wild-type stop codon. cell lysates were prepared 24 h posttransfection and assayed successively for the two luciferase enzymes. readthrough efficiencies were similar to those obtained with larger inserts. a DNA construct expressing small ribosomal protein 3a (mRPS3a) was tested in parallel. transfection with the mRPS3a DNA did not result in an increase in readthrough. mRPL4 effects on readthrough of moMLV gag-pol junction are cell line dependent. mRPL4 did not increase readthrough in several human cell lines tested. luciferase signals indicated that transfection efficiencies or expression levels did vary from cell to cell. but there was no significant correlation between basal reporter levels and responsiveness to mRPL4. readthrough was increased by hRPL4, although to a lesser degree than by mRPL4. mRPL4 enhancement is distinctive among ribosomal proteins. transfection of 293A cells with cDNAs encoding these proteins resulted in no significant increase in readthrough. constructs for mRPS20 and mRPL7 induced smaller, less striking increases in readthrough. to monitor expression levels of key ribosomal proteins, we prepared constructs encoding N-terminally Flag-tagged versions of mRPL4 and mRPS3a. the proteins expressed from these constructs were also hard to detect, though immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting allowed their visualization. we obtained several commercial antibodies specific for human and mouse RPL4 and examined lysates by Western blotting. transfection of increasing levels of mRPL4 cDNA resulted in proportional increases in levels of mRPL4 mRNA accumulating in the cells. similar experiments in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in an increase in mRNA levels over the basal levels in untransfected cells of at least fourfold. we hypothesized that the increased levels of transcript may not lead to increased levels of protein. the genome of the alphavirus Sindbis virus uses a leaky termination sequence, a UGA stop codon followed by a cytidine, to control the ratio of its structural proteins. a control plasmid was constructed with correction of the reading frame to eliminate the need for frameshifting and downstream reporter expression at about 6% of the level of the control. the effects of mRPL4 are not limited to suppression of termination or dependent on a specific pseudoknot structure. mRPL4 also increased readthrough for the Sindbis virus recoding sequence when transfected at high levels. the raw values of luciferase induced by this reporter construct were below the levels reliably above background. we suspect that the low levels of expression from this construct may be due to rapid turnover of the mRNA by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. mRPL4 did not increase luciferase reporter levels into the meaningful range of the assay. mRPL4 did increase readthrough of the hyperactive pseudoknot mutant to even higher levels. mRPL4 increases readthrough of all stop codons. previous studies on the moMLV gag-pol junction showed readthrough could occur with any of the three stop codons (15). mRPL4-mediated increase in gag-pol readthrough impairs viral replication. mRPL4-mediated increase in gag-pol readthrough impairs viral replication. mRPL4-mediated increase in gag-pol readthrough impairs viral replication. at the highest levels of mRPL4 cDNA, virus yields were reduced as much as 10-fold. overexpression of the control mRPS3a protein had no effect on CA levels compared to the basal levels seen with virus alone. the region containing the MoMLV gag stop codon and pseudoknot sequence (MoMLV-PK) was cloned into plasmid p2luc between Renilla and firefly luciferase coding sequences. this plasmid contained the same moMLV sequence with a glutamine codon replacing the wild-type stop codon. the results showed a dose-dependent increase in readthrough that correlated with the amount of mRPL4 DNA transfected. a DNA construct expressing small ribosomal protein 3a (mRPS3a) was tested in parallel. transfection with the mRPS3a DNA did not result in an increase in readthrough. mRPL4 increased readthrough in many, but not all, cell lines tested. differences were not attributable to species or lineage of cell types. mRPL4 did not increase readthrough in several human cell lines tested. mRPS3a as a negative control and showed no increase in readthrough. the variety in responses suggests that readthrough may be modulated by other unknown cellular factors. readthrough may be modulated by other unknown cellular factors. mRPL4 enhancement of readthrough is distinctive among ribosomal proteins. the proteins chosen included several with known extraribosomal functions. transfection of 293A cells with cDNAs encoding these proteins resulted in no significant increase. transfection of overexpression constructs of key ribosomal proteins did not cause decreases in the raw reporter luciferase values. the proteins expressed from these constructs were also hard to detect, though immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting allowed their visualization. the addition of this tag also abolished enhancement. luciferase analysis of moMLV readthrough in HEK 293A cells transfected with mRPL4 cDNA expression construct or the L4-FS construct and the MoMLV pseudoknot reporter pair. the data are from a representative experiment. Error bars correspond to standard deviations of averages derived from triplicate luciferase readings. transfection of the L4-FS DNA into 293A cells did not increase readthrough over basal levels. increased readthrough is likely caused not by the mRPL4 transcript but by the mRPL4 protein itself. mRPL4 enhances translation of other functional viral recoding sequences. a control plasmid replaced the UGA stop codon with CGA to allow maximum translation of the reporter. the UGA C tetranucleotide sequence promoted suppression of termination at a significant rate, about 3% of the control. mRPL4 increased readthrough for the Sindbis virus recoding sequence when transfected at high levels. ase assay of mRPL4 hypoactive and U38A hyperactive moMLV pseudoknot mutant and control reporter constructs cotransfected with 1, 3, or 6 g of mRPL4 cDNA construct. the raw values of luciferase induced by this reporter construct were below the levels reliably above background. mRPL4 did not increase the luciferase reporter levels into the meaningful range of the assay. the mutant has been shown to be hypoactive, yielding reduced readthrough. mRPL4 did not bring the levels into the useful range of the assay. mRPL4 did increase readthrough of the hyperactive pseudoknot mutant to even higher levels. mRPL4-mediated increase in gag-pol readthrough impairs viral replication. mRPL4-mediated increase in gag-pol readthrough impairs viral replication. overexpression of mRPL4 showed a strong and dose-dependent inhibition of CA levels in the medium. at the highest levels of mRPL4 cDNA, virus yields were reduced as much as 10-fold. overexpression of the control mRPS3a protein had no effect on CA levels. mRPS3a cDNA expression construct probed with rat anti-CA polyclonal antibody. decoding occurs in the decoding center of the ribosome, located in the small subunit. it is thought to be governed predominately by the 18S rRNA (16S in prokaryotes) the mRPL4 protein exhibiting the ability to modulate readthrough was first identified in a screen for pseudoknot-binding proteins as expressed in yeast. mRPL4 alters the equilibrium between two interconverting conformations of the pseudoknot, selectively stabilizing the acidic conformation. it is therefore not clear whether the enhancing activity depends on direct binding of the pseudoknot by mRPL4. eukaryotic RPL4 occupies a similar position, although there appears to be no direct contact between RPL4 and the decoding center. it is unlikely that RPL4 overexpression acts in the context of its normal position in the ribosome; overexpression would not be expected to lead to overexpression of all other ribosomal subunits. mRPL7 and mRPS20 showed a modest increase in readthrough over basal levels. but all other proteins tested had no effect whatsoever on readthrough. some aspect of mRPL4 provides for an unusually, and perhaps uniquely, potent enhancement of recoding. mRPL4-increased readthrough is important for virus replication. disruption of correct gag:Gag-Pol stoichiometry is likely to interfere most directly with virion assembly. mRPL4 overexpression can indeed limit the ability of the virus to assemble. the similar overexpression of a control ribosomal protein showed no such inhibition of virion production. these results are consistent with a block to virion assembly in the face of abnormal precursor levels."}
