{"summary": "a significant number of infections are due to viruses, of which influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the most common. the increased recognition of the burden of viral respiratory disease in older adults has been made possible by the development of new diagnostic molecular techniques (4\u20136) sputum added approximately 11% to the diagnostic yield for many of the common respiratory viruses (19). sputum is viscous and difficult to process, making its use in a clinical microbiology laboratory with automated equipment impractical. a sterile swab was dunked in the straight sputum for several seconds. the swab was then swirled in 700 l of sterile distilled molecular-grade water. the same sample was then subjected to the dunk and swirl method. ovirus (HMPV) were subjected to RT-qPCR. RNA was extracted from 250 l of NTS and sputum samples. cDNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription using a conserved forward primer. the multiplex real-time RT-PCR (FilmArray) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Salt Lake City, UT) a subset of sputum samples randomly selected from archived samples collected in 2008-2012 were then prepared using the above dunk and swirl method. 300 l of the sample was tested for the following 10 viruses: flu A (23 samples), influenza B (3 samples), RSV A (22 samples), OC43 (20 samples), coronavirus 229E nose and throat swabs were collected by sequentially sampling each naris with a single sterile cotton swab, sampling the throat with a second swab, and placing the two swabs in a single tube containing 3 ml of viral transport medium. the nasal sample was obtained by inserting the swab approximately 1 in. into the nasal cavity and rubbing firmly in a circular motion on the nasal septum and lateral wall a sterile swab was dunked in the straight sputum for several seconds. this swab was then swirled in 700 l of sterile distilled molecular-grade water. the swab was withdrawn after excess fluid was removed. RNA was extracted from 250 l of NTS and sputum samples using a commercial phenol-chloroform preparation (LS Stat; Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) for each virus, the extracted RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription using a conserved forward primer and nucleotides. the product was then treated with uracil N-glyconase (UNG) the lower limit of detection (LLOD) of the filmArray assay was compared to that for the in-house uniplex RT-PCR assay for Flu A, Flu A, HMPV, and OC43. unknown samples were then compared to the established standard curve. differences between the groups were analyzed using Fisher's exact 2-tailed test of independence for discrete variables. 124 (41%) were positive in both the NTS and sputum samples, 105 (35%) were positive by the sputum sample alone, and 73 (24%) were positive by the NTS alone. the majority of patients with positive NTS-only illnesses did not have sputum samples available. the LLODs for the filmArray RT-PCR assay and in-house uniplex assays were similar for HMPV, OC43, Flu A, and RSV A within a single 10-fold dilution. the LLODs for the filmArray assay were 50, 2.6, 3,300, and 95 TCID 50/ml of virus, respectively, for the uniplex assays. six samples of sputum diluted 1:1 with sterile water and three samples of undiluted sputum were evaluated with the filmArray system. two of the 1:1 sputum dilutions and all of the three undiluted sputum samples resulted in invalid assays. qPCR was performed on sputum samples which tested positive by the filmArray assay and their corresponding NTS samples. quantitative PCR viral loads in straight sputum, dunked sputum and NTS samples. each solid circle represents a sample with detectable viral RNA. interval bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of the mean viral load for each virus. the individual viral loads in the NTS samples were lower than those in the corresponding dunked sputum samples. the viral loads of 5 NTS samples were near the LLOD, while all the sputum viral loads were in the readily detectable range. light gray bars represent NTS samples, and dark gray bars represent dunked sputum samples. quantitative PCR of straight sputum samples, dunked sputum samples, and NTS samples collected with flocked swabs. each solid circle represents a sample with detectable viral RNA. interval bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of each mean viral load. s of viral and bacterial infections of 72% and 91%, respectively, in 76 children hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia using induced sputum samples in an automated multiplex RT-PCR for viral detection (25). dunk and swirl method is simple and quick and does not involve additional costs for separate RNA extraction. a comparison of the NTS samples and corresponding dunked sputum samples revealed higher viral loads in almost all dunked sputum samples. sputum testing may allow viral detection when the viral load in the sample is below the limits of detection. combined testing will require further study to ensure that there are no inhibitors in the sputum sample which would negate an otherwise positive NTS sample. sputum samples processed by the dunk and swirl method work very well in a fully automated PCR system for respiratory viral detection. in adults with respiratory illnesses, sputum samples can be used as an adjunct to traditional NTS samples to increase the diagnostic yield."}
