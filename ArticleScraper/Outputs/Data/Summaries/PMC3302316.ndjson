{"summary": "BVs are distinguished by their large, segmented double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes and symbiotic association with parasitoid wasps in the family Braconidae. each species of wasp carries a genetically unique BV which is transmitted only vertically to offspring as an integrated provirus. BVs do not replicate in host insects, but infection is vital for wasp survival. us inanitus and Sanger sequencing approximately 5,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (9) were transcripts with homology to 24 known genes from nudiviruses; a genus of large dsDNA viruses that is closely related to the Baculoviridae. BV virions morphologically resemble nudiviruses (43) nudivirus-related transcripts in M. demolitor and all wasp genes are highly expressed during replication of a BV. these data represent the first deep sequencing analysis of both viral and wasp genes during replication of a BV. ovaries from stage 1 to 4 female pupae and adult female wasps were prepared by homogenizing them in 1 DNase buffer (0.5 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) after filtration through a 0.45-m filter, 1 l of Ambion Turbo DNase was added to some samples for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, while others were not DNase treated. primers were cloned into pSC-A-amp/kan (Stratagene) and propagated in Escherichia coli. after overnight culture, plasmid DNA was then isolated using the Fermentas GeneJet plasmid miniprep kit and quantified. each of these plasmids was then used to make absolute standard curves to determine the abundance of integrated genomic DNA B, episomal genomic B, the empty B locus, and EF ovaries were collected, processed, and examined as previously described. RNA isolation, library preparation, and transcriptome sequencing were performed for each wasp developmental stage. each sample internally replicated 4 times. use of the longer-read algorithm improved the percentage of mapped reads over short-read algorithms. if multiple matches were found for a single read, bwa-sw chose the reported mapping location at random. Counts of aligned reads could therefore be summed for all possible alternative transcripts of a single locus to give the raw number of reads mapping to a locus for each sample. two ultra-high-abundance genes (vp39 and 17a) were fragmented during assembly due to excessive read coverage. orthologous genes among the M. demolitor transcripts were identified by tblastn alignment of the best query protein to the transcript. transcripts were searched with HMMs built for all nudivirus core genes using the nudivirus orthologs from all currently sequenced nudivirus genomes. the translated transcript sequence was searched against the Pfam-A database using HMMER 3.0 hmmscan (20) only hits with scores above the trusted cutoff were used. cDNA concentrations were quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. the corresponding cDNA for each gene of interest was PCR amplified. a total of 66,425 transcripts were deposited in geneBank. the last-stage wasp larva emerges from the host's body on day 7. pupae enter stage 2, which is distinguished by wasps having dark red eyes, 3 or 4 black stripes on the dorsal side of the thorax, and a white abdomen. pupae emerge from the cocoon as day 1 adults. DNA pellets were resuspended in 30 l of H2O and diluted 1:50 with water for use as the template. PCRs were run using a Bio-Rad thermocycler and 25-l reaction volumes containing DNA (10 ng) from day 5 adults as the template, DNA primers (6.25 pmol), and 1.25 units of Hotmaster Taq polymerase (5 Prime) qPCR mixtures containing 1 l of DNA template were then run using a Rotor-Gene 3000 cycler (Corbett) per-ovary copy numbers were calculated by multiplying the qPCR estimate of copy number by the dilution factor and elution volume and dividing by the number of ovaries used in each sample. libraries were clustered on one lane at 6 pM followed by 100 cycles of paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq system. reads were filtered for quality by removing those that had 90% of bases with >Q10 quality scores. high-quality reads were assembled using velvet v1.1.04 and Oases v0.2.21 (60), with k-mer length 51, and parameters cov_cutoff = 3, min_trans_length = 200, ins_ transcripts with homology to baculovirus or nudivirus genes (pif-1, p74, lef-8, HzNVorf9-1 and -2, and HzNVorf64) were fragmented in assembly into two or more different contigs. others had frameshift mutations which suggested that they were inactivated. phylogenetic reconstruction of evolution of orthologous protein-coding sequences was performed by maximum likelihood analysis using RAxML PROTCATLG (with the LG substitution matrix) and 1,000 bootstrap replicates, with the CIPRES online resource (42). HMM searches for conserved protein domains. translated transcript sequence was searched against the Pfam-A database of HMMs using HMMER 3.0 hmmscan (20) only hits with scores above the trusted cutoff were used. cDNA concentrations were quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. 66,425 transcripts were deposited in geneBank with accession numbers JO913492 through JO979916 and JR139425 through JR139430. BV replication in calyx cells of the wasp ovary consists of three major events. the encapsidated genome of MdBV consists of 15 segments (A to O), which are individually packaged into virions. the abundance of episomal segment B began to rise in stage 3 pupae. however, it did not reach a maximum until adult wasps were 6 days old. we also first detected products for the segment B \u201cempty locus\u201d in stage 3 pupae. the data for each wasp stage derives from two or three independently collected ovary samples. TEM micrographs of MdBV nucleocapsids and virions during particular phases of replication. arrows indicate regions in the nucleus where MdBV particles are being assembled in proximity to virogenic stroma. amplification of DNA containing proviral segment B began in stage 2 pupae. virion formation and packaging of episomal segment B began in stage 3 pupae. replication in stage 3 and 4 pupae was higher than that in day 1 adults. 66 loci correspond to known intergenic regions or ORFs in MdBV genomic DNAs that are packaged into virions. some of these reads arose from low-level contamination by MdBV genomic segments that were massively amplified during replication. some genes in the MdBV encapsidated genome are expressed in M. demolitor adults (11) 69\u201377% of genes shared among species were present in the data set we generated. this analysis also suggested that all of the highly expressed genes in ovaries were sampled, because random transcript sequencing results in highly expressed genes being sequenced more often by chance than genes expressed at low levels (32). vlf-1 encode capsid proteins conserved between nudiviruses and baculoviruses. four other nucleocapsid proteins present in all baculovirus genomes were absent from the M. demolitor ovary transcriptome. however, we did identify homologs of predicted structural genes HzNVorf9, HzNVorf106, HzNVorf140, and PmV hypothetical protein. 5, 6, 10 144 98 NS Late gene expression, capsid protein, DNA packaging HzNVorf140 (vlf-1b) 3488 88 0 6.4e08 Nudcleocapsid protein, DNA packaging 2966 197 0 1.9e05 Nudcleocapsid protein, DNA packaging 2965 519 0 2.2e08 Nudcleocapsid protein, DNA packaging 38K 318 511 2 4.0e05 Nucleo ac92 5801 95 0 1.5e06 Structural protein ac92 5801 95 0 6.9e08 Sulfhydryl oxidase 2756 162 0 1.30E08 HzNVorf64 1,043 12 7.9e08 Unknown HzNVorf94 318 511 2 4.0e05 Unknown HzNVorf128 1167 107 85 NS, not significant. demolitor genome by counting the number of unique amino (9 peptide sequences) and carboxy (8 peptides) terminal ends present in our data set. vlf-1 and integrase (also known as vlf-1a and vlf-1b, respectively) and HzNVorf140 (16) homologs identified in M. demolitor more likely arose prior to or after acquisition by the wasp. many of these loci, including the viral integrase and helicase, all of the pif genes, and all of the other predicted structural genes were expressed at near-zero levels in early pupae and adults. a much larger proportion of the viral loci were either more highly (100 RPKM 1,000) or much more highly (RPKM > 1,000) expressed in adult than in stage 1 pupal ovaries. expression of lef-4, lef-9, and the helicase gene began in last-day larvae. expression of p74 did not begin until pupae reached stage 3. transcript abundance for each gene also declined between day 1 and day 5 adults. the first category of genes in this regard consisted of orthologs for any of the 28 non-nudivirus genes recently identified by proteomic analysis of CiBV virions. we identified 7 orthologs in total with transcript abundance for 6 being more abundant in adult ovaries. the 58b ortholog we identified did not differ in abundance between pupae and adults, and transcript abundance of 58b also did not differ between prereplication- and active-replication-stage ovaries in C. in 210 0 8.5E09 417 35a CBA62630.1 None 129 0 5.8E09 420 35a CBA62630.1 None 249 0 9.2E08 615 (transcript 4, 9) 35a CBA62630.1 None 277 0 2.7E05 576 97a CBA62572.1 None 334 0 7.5E08 937 97b. transcripts with mean RPKM values were 50 in adult calyces. 920 were upregulated in adults while 40 were downregulated. this yielded 165 loci that we classified as strong candidates for direct or indirect roles in MdBV replication.

RPKM values for dnapol were higher in pupae, while no significant differences were detected between treatments for dnapol and. we also identified transcripts containing a DNA polymerase B2 domain, including several whose best BLAST hit was to a DNA polymerase B2-containing ORF from another BV-carrying wasp (Glyptapanteles flavicoxis) (15).

HzNVorf9, HzNVorf106, HzNVorf140, and PmV hypothetical protein were identified from Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 1 (Hz-1) (14) and Penaeus monodon baculovirus (MBV) the predicted structural genes were also identified by proteomic analysis of CiBV particles from the wasp Chelonus inanitus (54). protein, DNA packaging 38K 318 511 2 4.0e05 Nucleocapsid protein vp91 4098 210 0 7.5e08 Nucleocapsid protein vp39 4,109 3 6.2e06 Nucleocapsid protein p74 1,320 2 1.1e07 Per os infectivity pif-1 382 0 6.4e09 Per os infectivity pif-2 226 448 0 9.4e nudivirus/baculovirus-like homologs (vlf-1, integrase, odv-e56, ac92, odv-e66, and HzNVorf9) were present in more than one contig. we estimated that 8 or 9 paralogs of odv-e66 exist in the M. demolitor genome. vlf-1 and integrase arose from an older duplication of vlf-1 in the nudivirus ancestor of BVs. most nudivirus/baculovirus-like genes are strongly upregulated during MdBV replication. read mapping for each replicate was successful for 90.2% of reads. lef-5, vlf-1 and vlf-1 were abundantly expressed in pupae and adults. we then compared the RPKM values for the nudivirus/baculovirus genes to the RPKM values for all other loci, which we designated as wasp genes. results showed a strong bias in the proportion of nudivirus-like genes that are abundantly expressed during MdBV replication relative to wasp genes. expression of lef-4, lef-9, and the helicase gene began in last-day larvae or stage 1 pupae. expression of p74 did not begin until pupae reached stage 3. transcript abundance for each gene also declined between day 1 and day 5 adults. the 58b ortholog we identified did not differ in abundance between pupae and adults. the 35a locus we identified consisted of 3 transcripts, suggesting the duplication of this gene in M. demolitor. the second category of genes consists of those located in a region of a wasp chromosome. multiple wasp genes are strongly upregulated during BV replication. 920 loci were upregulated in adults while 40 were downregulated. expression levels indicated as in Table 1. 165 loci were more abundant in adults than in pupae. 41 of these loci shared significant identity with known genes. 30 shared identity with other hypothetical genes in databases.
