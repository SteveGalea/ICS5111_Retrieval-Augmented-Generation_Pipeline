{"summary": "two open reading frames encoded by the 12.7-kb genome of prototypic hypovirus CHV-1/EP713 contain N-terminal leader papain-like protease domains. protease p29 is released from the N-terminal portion of a 69-kDa precursor polypeptide, p69, encoded by ORF A to form p29 and p40 (5, 6), cell-free translation studies indicated that p29 processing occurs during translation (5) p29 and p48 are the products of an intragenomic duplication event. p48 is not dispensable for viral replication. but when supplied in trans, p48 can rescue a mutant virus lacking the p48 coding region, p48 (16). the RNA silencing mutant strain containing a disruption of the Dicer gene dcl2 (dcl2) was generated in the study described in Segers et al. (18). mutants were grown for 7 or 10 days in potato dextrose broth at 22 to 24\u00b0C. nucleotide region Note Not1F and KF/KR primers Not1F ggatccgcgcGCCTATGGGTGGTCTACA 1\u201314 The NotI sequence is in lowercase; the CHV-1/EP713sequence is in uppercase 1KF ATCTCTCGGCCATTGTAG 979\u2013996 2KF CACGACCCGGTTGAGGTC 1976\u20131993 3KF GGAAATGGATCTATGGTC e primers p48-341S-F CGAAGAGAGCTTCGAGCTCTTGTTC 3128\u20133158 The Cys-to-Ser point mutation site is underlined p48 cleavage site primers p48-388S-F. the CHV1/EP713 sequence is in uppercase; the GSG linkerer is in lowercase; the CHV1/EP713 sequence is in uppercase. the p48 is in uppercase p48-His-R gtggtgatgatgatgatgACCGCTACCTGTTCGCCACACTTCAATAGGTCG 2378\u20132401 The 6His tag is in lowercase; the GSG linker is underlined; the p48 is in uppercase Point mutations were introduced for p48 catalytic and cleavage site residues using a subcloned p48 coding domain. plasmid pRFL4-p48 (C341S:H388S:G418R), pRFL4-p48 (C341S:H388S:G418R), pRFL4-p48(C341S:H388S:G418R), pRFL4-p48(C341S:G418R), pRFL4-p48(C341S:H388S individual isolates were sequenced to confirm that the deletion mutations were maintained. the resulting plasmid, p29-p48(C341S:H388S:G418R)-blunt, was digested with restriction enzymes AscI. plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes MreI and NheI. resulting fragments were used to replace corresponding fragment in plasmid pRFL4. individual isolates were sequenced to confirm deletion was still present. cDNA clones were generated using a Monsterscript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit. primer 12.5KR was used to prime cDNA synthesis starting at the 3\u2032-terminal end of the viral RNA. PCR was subsequently performed using primer set 1KF-5KR to generate a 4-kb product that was sequenced. total nucleic acid was extracted sequentially twice with phenol-chloroform and once with chloroform. the extracted nucleic acid samples were treated with RQ1 DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) to eliminate fungal chromosomal DNA, followed by two rounds of phenol-chloroform extractions, ethanol precipitation and resuspension in double-distilled water. the antigen used to generate antibody B1 included all of the p48 coding region and extended 150 codons past the p48 Gly418-Ala419 cleavage dipeptide. commercial antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis of p48 proteins containing the 6His epitope tag. CHV-1/EP713 cDNA proceeded by the T7 polymerase promoter and flanked at each end by NotI sites cloned into a modified pTZ19 vector. individual point mutations were introduced at either Cys162 or His215 to generate plasmids pRFL4-p29(C162S) and pRFL4-p29(H215S), respectively. 88\u201312705 p29 protease primers p29-162S-F GGGCAGGGCTACTCGTATCTCTCGGCC 963\u2013990 The Cys-to-Ser point mutation site is underlined p29-215S-F GACCATGTTTATTCCGTGGTCCGAC 1122\u20131149 The His-to-Ser point mutation site is underlined p48 cleavage site primers p48-418R-F p29 primers ascI-p29-F atcgatggcgcccGCCTATGGTCTACATAGG 1\u201322 The p48 is in lowercase; the GSG linker is underlined; the p48 is in uppercase p48-His-R gtggtgatgatgatgACCGCTACCTGTTCGCCACACTTCAATAGGTCG 2378\u20132401 The 6His tag is in lowercase; the GSG link individual point mutations were introduced at Cys341, His388, and Gly418 in pUC-p48. the mutated pUC-p48 plasmids were sequenced to confirm all mutations. the fragments were digested with restriction enzymes MreI (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) and NheI (New England BioLabs) plasmid pRFL4-p48 (C341S:H388S:G418R)-blunt was digested with restriction enzymes ascI and NheI. resulting plasmid was designated pRFL4(p29)-p48(C341S:H388S:G418R) tope tag between amino acid residues 14 and 15 within the p48 coding region of wild-type RFL4 and the triple mutant RFL4-p48(C341S:H388S:G418R) viral cDNAs. the resulting plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes MreI and NheI. individual isolates were sequenced to confirm that the desired deletion was still present and that no additional point mutations were accidentally generated. infection of fungal strains with hypovirus CHV-1/EP713 and mutant viruses initiated by electroporation-mediated transfection of fungal spheroplasts with synthetic transcripts generated in vitro from SpeI-linearized viral cDNA clones. cDNA clones of the viral replicative form double-stranded RNA isolated from mutant virus-infected strains were generated through the use of a Monsterscript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit cultures used for viral RNA and protein analysis were grown in 200 ml of PDB for 7 days. mycelium was harvested by filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. total protein extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared according to the method of Parsley et al. (23) using TEDS-C extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mM NaCl, 1% [wt/vol] CHAPS) commercial antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis of p48 proteins containing the 6His epitope the p29 catalytic residues were mapped by in vitro studies to Cys162 and His215 with cleavage at the Gly248/Gly249 dipeptide (5, 7, 8) similar analyses identified Cys341 and His388 as the essential p48 catalytic residues with self-cleavage occurring between Gly418 and Ala419 (9. the catalytic residues of both p29 and p48 were mutated to se p29 mutant viral RNA accumulation was measured as described in Materials and Methods. deletion of 88% of the p29 coding domain (p29 virus) was shown previously to reduce viral RNA accumulation by more than 50% (21) a similar colony morphology and growth phenotype was observed upon infection by the CHV-1/EP713 wild-type and p29 protease mutant viruses. western blot analysis with anti-p29 antibody showed that the processed p29 protein found in extracts from the dcl2 strain was replaced by the unprocessed p69 protein in p29 protease mutant virus-infected cell extracts. cl2 strain (lane 2) showed a large accumulation of viral protease p29. mutation of catalytic residues resulted in an apparent absence of mature p29 and a buildup of unprocessed p69. total protein levels were diluted 50-fold compared to protein extracted from isolates infected with p29 protease mutant viruses. morphology of EP155 and dcl2 strains transfected with RNA transcripts corresponding to wild-type CHV-1/EP713 and p48 protease mutant viruses. infection of strain EP155 with CHV-1/p48(C341S), CHV-1/p48(C341S:H388S) produced a fungal phenotype similar to that of CHV-1/EP713-infected colonies. s on viral RNA accumulation was examined by real-time RT-PCR. mutant virus RNAs were found to accumulate to substantially lower levels than wild-type virus RNA. the double mutant virus showed the largest decrease; a greater than 80% reduction. the p48 protein was diluted 10-fold compared to mutant p48. the p48 protein was not detected in protein extracts from an uninfected dcl2 isolate. the mutation at the p48 cleavage site does not prevent processing in the infected cell. infection of EP155 with the CHV-1/p48(G418R) mutant virus resulted in a hypovirulent phenotype similar to wild-type CHV-1/EP713. when the p48 mutant viruses were introduced into dcl2 spheroplasts, infected fungal isolates displayed a faster growth rate and increased pigmentation. e tags were introduced into the p48 coding domain just after Thr14 in the following mutant viruses. the p48 coding domain was deleted from the plasmid encoding the mutant virus to generate a CHV-1/p29-p48(C341S:H388S:G418R) mutant virus. processing of mutant p48 protein is independent of virus-encoded papain-like protease activities. p48 processing can also occur through an alternative nonviral, host-dependent pathway. the p29 essential catalytic residues were mapped by in vitro studies to Cys162 and His215 with cleavage at the Gly248/Gly249 dipeptide (5, 7, 8) similar analyses identified Cys341 and His388 as the essential p48 catalytic residues with self-cleavage occurring between Gly418 and Ala419 (9. mutant p29 catalytic residues did not significantly alter EP155 or dcl2 colony morphology or pigmentation compared to dcl2-infected isolates. deletion of 88% of the p29 coding domain (p29 virus) was shown previously to reduce viral RNA accumulation by more than 50% (21) dcl2 strain serves as a useful experimental tool because of the increased accumulation of CHV-1/EP713 RNA and proteins, the absence of DI RNAs, and the stability of recombinant viruses. a similar colony morphology and growth phenotype was observed upon infection by the CHV-1/EP713 wild-type and p29 protease mutant viruses. the dcl2 strain (lane 2) showed a large accumulation of viral protease p29. mutation of catalytic residues resulted in an apparent absence of mature p29 and a buildup of unprocessed p69. total protein levels were diluted 50-fold compared to protein extracted from isolates infected with the p29 protease mutant viruses. morphology of EP155 and dcl2 strains transfected with RNA transcripts corresponding to wild-type CHV-1/EP713 and p48 protease mutant viruses. infection of strain EP155 with CHV-1/p48(C341S) produced a fungal phenotype similar to that of CHV-1/EP713-infected colonies. the effect of the p48 protease mutations on viral RNA accumulation was examined by real-time RT-PCR. mutant virus RNAs were found to accumulate to substantially lower levels than wild-type virus RNA, with the double mutant virus showing the largest decrease. p48-related proteins were not detectable by Western blotting in extracts prepared from strains EP155 infected with the p48 mutant viruses. the p48 protein was diluted 10-fold compared to mutant p48 before loading the gel. the p48 protein was not detected in protein extracts from an uninfected dcl2 isolate (lane 5) p48/ORF B cleavage site does not prevent processing in the infected cell. cl2 fungal strains were transfected with RNA transcripts derived from p48/ORF B cleavage site mutant virus cDNA plasmids. infection of EP155 with a CHV-1 virus containing a mutation to the protease residues and the cleavage site residue results in an increase in fungal pigmentation. when the p48 mutant viruses were introduced into dcl2 spheroplasts, the in immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti-6His antibody confirmed processing of the epitope-tagged p48 for each of the p48 mutant viruses. accumulation of the tagged p48 protein was considerably lower in extracts from p48 mutant virus-infected mycelia than from WT virus-infected mycelia. mutant p48 protein is independent of virus-encoded papain-like protease activities. p48 processing can also occur through an alternative nonviral, host-dependent pathway. dcl2 fungal isolate transfected with RNA transcripts. essential autocatalytic and cleavage site residues required for p29 and p48 cleavage in vitro were dispensable for viral replication but contributed to optimal viral RNA accumulation. the dispensability of p29 and p48 autoproteolytic activity for hypovirus replication was unexpected. catalytic cysteine for PL2pro of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV229E) was found to be lethal. the autoproteolytic activity for the paralogous PL1pro was dispensable. similar mutations of the protease domain, PCP, in the adjacent nsp1 completely blocked viral RNA replication. autocatalysis by p29 and p48 is dispensable for viral replication. p48 protease underwent duplication to form the p29 progenitor. mutation of p29 catalytic residues would eliminate p29 processing. p48 processing would continue through the alternative cellular pathway. both the autocatalytic release and the alternative cellular processing of p48 operate during hypovirus infection. disruption of the latter reduces viral RNA replication efficiency while disruption of the latter is lethal."}
