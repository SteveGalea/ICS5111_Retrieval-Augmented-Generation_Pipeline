{"summary": "in the 1970s, the united states army developed live Ad vaccines to prevent acute respiratory disease caused by AdHu4 and AdHu7.1. in 1993, a 23-year-old man with cystic fibrosis homozygous received the first in vivo gene therapy with an E1-E3-deleted rAd vector expressing the normal human CFTR. in recent decades, Ads have been widely applied as vaccine carriers since they are capable of eliciting T and B cell human Ads include more than 50 serotypes classified into subtype A to G. chimpanzee Ads have more than 6 serotypes. most people have been infected and high neutralizing antibody titers were detected among the population. the core proteins mainly include proteins V, VII, X, and they mainly function as the DNA-associated proteins. the VII protein plays a key role in the manipulation of DNA. many Ads can be engineered for laboratory or clinical use. the recombinant Ads can be replication-incompetent or replication-competent. many other receptors for the entry of Ad have been found. some reports revealed that the uptake of Ad virions could use lipid rafts or caveolae as entry route. a review article suggested that when the Ad virions were coated with charged polymers, the entry routine might be changed accordingly. the fully gutted Ad vectors were developed with containing the replication origin and packaging signals while most of the viral coding sequences were deleted. the fully gutted Ads can only be amplified with the appearance of helper virus. a study of SIV Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice vaccinated with AdHu5, AdHu26 and AdHu35 showed that AdHu5 was more immunogenic than AdHu26 and AdHu35. but AdHu26 and AdHu48 produced more terminally differentiated phenotypes of T cells than AdHu5 in rhesus monkeys. the immune complexes of AdHu5 and anti-AdHu5 antibodies could activate the dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells100 which might serve as the targets for HIV infection. other improved strategies have been tested, including the regimen of DNA prime with AdHu5 boost. HIV vaccines based on the rAdHu35 expressing the HIV-1 envelop antigen have been studied. 192 healthy, HIV-uninfected participants were recruited and divided into one of following groups. the participants received three doses of 4 mg DNA or just one dose of 1010 pu rAd at the first 2 month. the highest dose vaccine groups were 100% protected from the heterologous lethal challenge of different subtypes of influenza virus. the highest dose vaccine groups were 100% protected from the heterologous lethal challenge of different subtypes of influenza virus. a new regimen induced high HI titers compared with unprimed individuals. a novel chimpanzee Ad termed as AdC68 was used as the microRNAs expression vector and tested in mice. the results showed high antibody titers and CD4+T cell responses were induced in vaccinated animals. the vaccinated groups had a higher survival rates than the control groups after challenged with lethal Ebola virus. the animals were only primed with rAd\u2013GP/NP and challenged 28 days later. the chimpanzee Ad serotype 3 (cAd3) is based on the other serotypes. 20 volunteers were recruited and divided into 2 groups. the rAds induced well specific antibody responses and T-cell responses, with higher levels of responses in the high dose group. a tetravalent dengue virus vaccine based on the rAds was tested in non-human primates. the animals produced high-titer antibodies that could neutralize all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. the protection effectiveness was better in dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges than in dengue-2 and dengue-4 challenges. human serotypes of Ad, such as AdHu5, have been extensively used for vaccine development mainly due to their excellent immunogenicity and safety. the rare human serotypes of Ads or non-human-originated Ads such as chimpanzee Ads have been extensively tested in both preclinical research and clinical trials. -p53 intratumorally on days 1 and 3 of each week at a daily dose of 2 1012 vp or methotrexate once weekly at a starting dose of 40 mg/m2 and each treatment cycle includes 21 days. the vector was well tolerated and the anti-tumor activities were significant. antigen specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and the secreted REIC protein in the tumor generated a proper microenvironment for inducing of activated dendritic cells. 128 RNAi technology is widely used in the downregulation of the specific gene's expression by sequence-specific degradation of the RISC complex. the application of RNAi technology based on Ads may be extremely effective since the small RNA molecules can be steadily expressed. the human heregulin- (HRG) was inserted into the HI loop of AdHu5 fiber without adverse effect on the Ad growth or yields. other studies showed that the fiber-modified Ads had specific tropism to different cancer cells, which may provide a new strategy for Ad based cancer therapy. the vaccine regimen included priming with 1010 vp rAd and some mice boosted 2 months later. the pre-clinical study showed that Ads expressing M2e within HVR1 of hexon induced higher magnitude and avidity of M2e-specific antibody responses than those carrying M2e within HVR4. the penton base and pIX were tested for antigen-incorporation in some studies. but the penton base was rarely incorporated with foreign antigens. most of the Ad species are rarely pathogenic to humans. human Ads include more than 50 serotypes classified into subtype A to G, and chimpanzee Ads have more than 6 serotypes. most people have been infected and high neutralizing antibody titers were detected among the population. the late genes are responsible for the lysis of the host cells. the core proteins include proteins V, VII, X, and they mainly function as the DNA-associated proteins. the VII protein plays a key role in the manipulation of DNA. the VIII proteins provide bonds between the peripentonal hexons and are involved in the stability of the capsids. many Ads can be engineered for laboratory or clinical use. recombinant Ads can be replication-incompetent or replication-competent. a review article suggested that when the Ad virions were coated with charged polymers, the entry routine might be changed accordingly. compared with other viral vectors such as lentivirus, retrovirus and adeno-associated virus, Ads are highly immunogenic and can induce robust innate and adaptive immune responses. the fully gutted Ad vectors were developed with containing the replication origin and packaging signals while most of the viral coding sequences were deleted. the fully gutted Ads can only be amplified with the appearance of helper virus. a study of SIV Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in mice vaccinated with AdHu5, AdHu26 and AdHu35 showed that AdHu5 was more immunogenic than AdHu26 and AdHu35. but AdHu26 and AdHu48 produced more terminally differentiated phenotypes of T cells. antibody complexes of AdHu5 and anti-AdHu5 could activate dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells100 which might serve as the targets for HIV infection. other improved strategies have been tested, such as the regimen of DNA prime with AdHu5 boost. HIV vaccines based on the rAdHu35 expressing the HIV-1 envelop antigen have been studied. 192 healthy, HIV-uninfected participants were recruited and divided into one of following groups. the participants received three doses of 4 mg DNA or just one dose of 1010 pu rAd at the first 2 month. the mice were immunized intramuscularly with 1010 PFU of rAds twice at 4-week interval. the highest dose vaccine groups were 100% protected from the heterologous lethal challenge of different subtypes of influenza virus. a new regimen induced high HI titers compared with unprimed individuals. the new regimen induced high HI titers compared with unprimed individuals. a novel chimpanzee Ad termed as AdC68 was used as the microRNAs expression vector. the vaccinated animals were challenged with lethal Ebola virus. the animals were only primed with rAd\u2013GP/NP and challenged 28 days later. they still had high survival rates with either low or high doses of challenged virus. in a clinical trial of cAd3 based Ebola vaccine, 20 volunteers were recruited and divided into 2 groups. the volunteers in each group received the rAds expressing the GP protein from both Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus. a tetravalent dengue virus vaccine based on the rAds was tested in non-human primates. the animals produced high-titer antibodies that could neutralize all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. the protection effectiveness was better in dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges than in dengue-2 and dengue-4 challenges. human serotypes such as AdHu5 have been extensively used for vaccine development mainly due to their excellent immunogenicity and safety. the rare human serotypes of Ads or non-human-originated Ads such as chimpanzee Ads have been extensively tested in both preclinical research and clinical trials. patients were randomly treated with either Ad-p53 intratumorally on days 1 and 3 of each week at a daily dose of 2 1012 vp or methotrexate once weekly at a starting dose of 40 mg/m2. the results revealed that the vector was well tolerated and the anti-tumor activities were significant. REIC induced tumor-associated antigen specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. the secreted REIC protein in the tumor generated a proper microenvironment for inducing of activated dendritic cells. 128 RNAi technology is widely used in downregulation of the specific gene's expression by sequence-specific degradation of the RISC complex. the human heregulin- (HRG) was inserted into the HI loop of AdHu5 fiber without adverse effect on the Ad growth or yields. the fiber-modified Ads showed enhanced infection of cells expressing the cognate receptors HER3/ErbB3 and HER4/ErbB4. s with wild-type or M2e-modified hexon with influenza A virus NP as a transgene product were also tested in the study. the vaccination regimen included priming with 1010 vp rAd and some mice boosted 2 months later. the vaccine regimen included priming with 1010 vp rAd. epitope 8 (Epi8) in five distinct sites of fiber was immunized in the mice. the results showed that the FG-loop and HI-loop inserted sites were better than the other insertion sites in fiber. the penton base and pIX were tested for antigen-incorporation in some studies. human adenovirus rAd recombinant Ad DSG2 desmoglein 2 HIV human immunodeficiency virus. human adenovirus rAd recombinant Ad DSG2 desmoglein 2 HIV human immunodeficiency virus."}
