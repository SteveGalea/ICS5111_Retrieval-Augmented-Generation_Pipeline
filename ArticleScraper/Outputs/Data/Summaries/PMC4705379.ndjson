{"summary": "crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. CCHFV is one of the most widely spread tick-borne viral infection of humans. CCHFV is one of the most widely spread tick-borne virus of humans. NSs have been shown to induce caspase activation and apoptosis. NSs proteins in the Bunyaviridae family exhibit sequence similarity with a known proapoptotic protein, reaper, from Drosophila (7). CCHFV induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis (22) and modulates both intrinsic as well as extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in hepatocyte cells.

DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (10 units/ml penicillin and 10 g/ml streptomycin) all cells were maintained in a 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. PCR products for different constructs were cloned into pXJ40myc vector. the cell lysates were washed three times with cold 1 PBS, resuspended in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) the cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, nal anti-calnexin antibody was used to detect equal amounts of loaded sample. caspase-3/7 activity assay was measured using the homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer. s of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-fmk), caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk), caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-fmk), or a negative control (Z-FA-fmk) were replaced with fresh medium containing 10 m of the respective cell-permeable caspase inhibitors 6 h post-transfection. cells were incubated with anti-myc (rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclo for cells incubated with both anti-myc and anti-mtTFA antibodies, the goat anti-mouse IgG and the goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies and incubated for 1 h. images were captured with an Olympus FluoView FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. mice were immunized with five doses of synthesized KLH-NSs(48\u201392) and KLH-NSs(120\u2013150) peptides. the primary dose was a mixture of equal volumes of both peptides (200 g each peptide) with complete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) the blood was collected from the mice, and serum was obtained by spinning down the cells. cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (10 units/ml penicillin and 10 g/ml streptomycin) all cells were maintained in a 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. the cells were washed three times with cold 1 PBS, resuspended in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) the cells were subjected to Western blot analysis and apoptotic as a rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody was used to detect equal amounts of loaded sample. caspase-3/7 activity assay was measured using the apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer. treatment with 10 m of inhibitors of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-fmk), caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk), caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-fmk), or a negative control (Z-FA-fmk) Approximately 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis and apoptotic assays. CCHFV-infected cells were infected with CCHFV and subjected to Western blot analysis. NSs was detected in the infected cells at 72 h.p.i., whereas it was below the detection limits at 48 h.p.i. densitometric analysis of NSs band intensities normalized to calnexin. in transfected cells, a significant increase in NSs expression was also observed upon MG132 treatment. this indicates that NSs is subjected to proteasomal protein degradation. NSs (green) and nucleocapsid protein (NP, red) were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) three independent experiments were performed, with a representative set of images shown here. cells were used for subsequent experiments involving caspase-3/7 activity. cell lines used were vero E6 (A and B), HeLa (C and D) and 293FT (E and F) the apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay was used to measure the activation of caspase-3/7 in three different cell lines that support CCHFV replication. the extent of NSs-induced apoptosis was inhibited significantly by all three caspase inhibitors but not by the irrelevant peptide (Z-FA-fmk) the cells were treated with an irrelevant peptide (Z-FA-fmk) or caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 inhibitors (Z-DEVD) Western blot analysis was performed to determine expression levels of myc-NSs (top panel), the cleavage of endogenous PARP (center panel), and levels of endogenous actin as a loading control. the results are expressed as mean S.D. caspase-3/7 activity for cells expressing both proteins was around five times higher than that of cells expressing full-length NSs. cleavage of PARP was significantly higher in cells expressing NSs(48\u2013140) and NSs(93\u2013140) compared with cells expressing full-length NSs. empty vector, Bax, NSs, or single alanine substitution mutants. NSs(93\u2013135)-induced caspase-3/7 activity was comparable with that of NSs(93\u2013140), indicating that residues 136\u2013140 do not have a role in NSs-induced apoptosis. alanine scanning was used to determine the key residues important for the apoptotic activity of NSs. triple alanine substitution mutants between 125\u2013136 amino acids residues were prepared. of four NSs mutants, two mutants were still functional in inducing apoptosis. NSs L126V mutant was found to be as active as wild-type NSs. NSs cleaved PARP suggesting residue Leu-126 is not essential in apoptosis. NSs disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential by triggering extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. A, myc-NSs was transfected into vero E6 cells. subcellular localization of NSs was detected by anti-myc antibody. the subcellular localization of transiently transfected myc-NSs (B) and myc-NSs L127A and L135A (C) was detected by anti-myc antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green). mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (red), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). at least three independent experiments were performed, with Western blot analysis was performed to determine expression levels of CCHFV NSs. however, there was unequal loading of samples, as reflected by the level of calnexin. normalization of NSs band intensities to those of calnexin by densitometric analysis revealed that there was more NSs protein in cells treated with MG132. western blots shown represent one of three independent experiments. NSs (green) and nucleocapsid protein (NP, red) were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) cells transfected with empty vector showed a significantly lower cleavage of PARP. therefore, 293FT cells were used for subsequent experiments involving caspase-3/7 activity. the cell lines used were vero E6 (A and B), HeLa (C and D) and 293FT (E and F) caspase-dependent, NSs-induced apoptosis involves the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are initiator caspases of the extrinsic and intrinsic signaling cascades. a caspase-8 activity assay was performed using cells treated with TNF- + CHX as a positive control. the cells were treated with an irrelevant peptide (Z-FA-fmk) or caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 inhibitors (Z-DEVD-fmk, Z-IETD-fmk, and Z-LEHD-fmk, respectively) the results are expressed as mean S.D. NSs(48\u2013140) and NSs(93\u2013140) were functionally active in inducing apoptosis. caspase-3/7 activity for cells expressing both proteins was around five times higher than that of cells expressing full-length NSs. cleavage of PARP was significantly higher in cells expressing NSs. NSs mut1 (TLL(125\u2013127)AAA), NSs mut2 (AVL(131\u2013133)AAA), or NSs mut4 (ALT(134\u2013136)AAA) (E); empty vector, Bax, NSs, or single alanine substitution mutants like NSs T125A, L126A, L127A, L135A, or T136A (I) expressing NSs(93\u2013130) had significantly lower level of caspase-3/7 activity. NSs(93\u2013125) was found to be completely inactive. alanine scanning was used to determine key residues important for apoptotic activity of NSs. NSs L126A protein expression could not be detected in transfected cells. successful expression was achieved with the NSs L126V mutant. NSs L126V was found to be as active as wild-type NSs. NSs disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. mitochondria in NSs-transfected cells could be stained with anti-mtTFA antibody. NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and localizes within mitochondria. NSs protein did not show MitoTracker staining, which further confirms that NSs disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells. the subcellular localization of transiently transfected DN-GRIM19-HA was detected by anti-HA antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green). the subcellular localization of transiently transfected DN-GRIM19-HA was detected by anti-HA antibody and Alexa Fluor 4 NSs was detected in the infected cells at 72 h.p.i., whereas it was below the detection limits at 48 h.p.i. the western blot analysis showed that there was unequal loading of samples. however, the Western blot analysis showed that there was unequal loading of samples, as reflected by the level of calnexin. western blot analysis was performed to determine expression levels of CCHFV NSs and calnexin as a loading control. NSs (green) and nucleocapsid protein (NP, red) were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. infected cells were also subjected to an immunofluorescence assay. cells overexpressing NSs protein or Bax had significantly higher levels of caspase-3/7 activity than the vector control cells. the cleavage of endogenous PARP, a substrate of activated caspase-3/7, was clearly observed in cells overexpressing NSs. NSs induces apoptosis via the Intrinsic and Extri. non-toxic, cell-permeable peptide caspase inhibitors bind irreversibly and specifically to activated caspases. caspase-8 and caspase-9 are upstream of caspase-3 in the cascade. caspase-8 and caspase-9 are initiator caspases of the extrinsic and intrinsic signaling cascades. the apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay was used to measure the activation of caspase-3/7 in 293FT cells that were transfected with empty vector or NSs. the cells were treated with an irrelevant peptide (Z-FA-fmk) or caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 inhibitors (Z-DEVD-fmk, Z-IETD-fmk, and Z-LEHD-fm cleavage of endogenous PARP and levels of endogenous actin as loading control. pXJmyc vector transfected NSs into 293FT cells. NSs(48\u2013140) and NSs(93\u2013140) were functionally active in inducing apoptosis. caspase-3/7 activity for cells expressing both proteins was around five times higher. s(93\u2013140) (A); empty vector, Bax, NSs(93\u2013140), NSs(93\u2013135), NSs(93\u2013130) or NSs(93\u2013125) (C); empty vector, Bax, NSs, or triple alanine substitution mutants such as NSs mut1 (TLL(125\u2013127)AAA), NSs mut2 (LRA(128\u2013130)AAA), NSs NSs(93\u2013135)-induced caspase-3/7 activity was comparable with that of NSs(93\u2013140), indicating that residues 136\u2013140 do not have a role in NSs-induced apoptosis. NSs(93\u2013125) was found to be completely inactive, as reflected by the abrogated caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved PARP. NSs L126A and Thr-136 are not involved in NSs-induced apoptosis. however, cells overexpressing NSs L127A and L135A had a significantly lower level of caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved PARP. successful expression was achieved with the NSs L126V mutant, which was almost equivalent to that of wild-type NSs. expressing the NSs protein did not show any MitoTracker staining. another set of cells was transfected with anti-mtTFA antibody. NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and localizes within mitochondria. dominant-negative mutant of GRIM19 was used as a positive control because its overexpression has been shown to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential. most of the cells overexpressing DN-GRIM19 showed no MitoTracker staining. NSs disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells. CCHFV NSs protein is composed of 150 amino acid residues. secondary structure of NSs was predicted by PSIPRED. cells were infected with CCHFV and subjected to Western blot analysis. SW13 cells were mock-infected or infected with CCHFV. either left untreated or treated with MG132, followed by cell harvesting at 48 and 72 h.p.i. western blot analysis was performed to determine expression levels of CCHFV NSs and calnexin. plasmid, empty vector as a negative control, and pXJmyc-Bax as a positive control. cells overexpressing NSs protein or Bax had significantly higher level of caspase-3/7 activity than the vector control cells. cleavage of endogenous PARP, a substrate of activated caspase-3/7, was clearly observed. NSs induces Apoptosis via the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Pathways Apoptosis may be triggered by two primarily different signaling pathways. non-toxic, cell-permeable peptide caspase inhibitors that bind irreversibly to activated caspases (29, 30), namely caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-fmk), caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk), and caspas cells treated with TNF- + CHX showed a significantly higher level of caspase-8 activity. NSs induces apoptosis via both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay was used to measure activation of caspase-3/7 in 293FT cells transfected with empty vector or myc-NSs. Western blot analysis was performed to determine expression levels of myc-NSs (top panel), the cleavage of endogenous PARP (center panel) and levels of endogenous actin as a loading control. the results are expressed as mean S.D. the apo-one homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay was used to measure the activation of caspase-3/7 in 293FT cells that were transfected with empty vector, Bax, NSs, NSs(48\u2013140), or NSs(93\u2013140) (A); empty vector, Bax, NSs(93\u2013140), NSs(93\u2013135), NSs(93\u2013130), or NSs(93\u2013125) (C); three more proteins, NSs(93\u2013125), NSs(93\u2013130) and NSs(93\u2013135), were examined for their abilities to induce apoptosis. NSs(93\u2013135)-induced caspase-3/7 activity was comparable with that of NSs(93\u2013140), indicating that residues 136\u2013140 do not have a role in NSs-induced apoptosis. leu-126, leu-127, leu-135, and Thr-136 residues were prepared to determine the residues important for the apoptotic activity of NSs. two mutations, T125A and T136A, had no effect on the apoptotic activity of the NSs protein. however, cells overexpressing NSs L127A and L135A had a significantly lower level of caspase-3/7 activity and cleaved PARP. mitoTracker red was used to stain mitochondria in live cells because its accumulation is dependent on the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential. cells overexpressing the NSs protein did not show any MitoTracker staining, which indicates that NSs disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential. NSs co-localizes in mitochondria and disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential. DN-GRIM19 was used as a positive control because its overexpression has been shown to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential. most of the HeLa cells overexpressing DN-GRIM19 showed no MitoTracker staining. NSs disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells. pXJmyc-NSs L127A and pXJmyc-NSs L135A showed MitoTracker staining. this indicates that these two mutants are not able to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential. CCHFV suppresses caspase activation at early stages of the infection and induces host cellular pro-apoptotic molecules at late stages post-infection. CCHFV NSs protein induces caspase-3/7 activation and PARP cleavage. this is the first time that NSs protein has been shown to induce apoptosis. NSs protein of the same genus can delay cell death by counteracting IRF-3-mediated apoptosis. caspase-dependent NSs-induced apoptosis involves both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. CCHFV NSs has been predicted to possess a transmembrane helix domain (118\u2013135 amino acids) that contains the leu-127 and leu-135 residues important for CCHFV NSs-induced apoptosis. NSs of hepatitis C virus has been reported to associate with the mitochondria of infected cells, contributing to an increase in reactive oxygen species, leading to apoptosis (43). on the other hand, NSm of the same virus integrates into the mitochondrial outer membrane and exerts an antiapoptotic function. CCHFV NSs co-localizes with mtTFA. NS4A of the hepatitis C virus activates caspase-8 and -9. p7 protein of the hepatitis C virus activates caspase-8 and -9 to induce apoptosis. ectopic expression of NSs wild-type and mutant proteins induces apoptosis."}
