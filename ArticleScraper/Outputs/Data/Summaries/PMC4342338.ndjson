{"summary": "the genus Flavivirus includes an unusually large number of taxonomically recognised species. the genus also includes a large and increasing number of unclassified or \u201ctentative\u201d species. pathogenic mosquito- and/or tick-borne flaviviruses cause a variety of clinical diseases in a wide range of vertebrate species. the first mammalian viruses to be identified included 4 arboviruses. three of them were flaviviruses: louping ill virus, yellow fever virus and dengue virus. this has had a deep and long-lasting influence on the development of virological research and more specifically, on taxonomy. current phylogenies recognise three major groups in addition to the ISFVs. the TBFV are sub-divided into pathogenic flaviviruses primarily associated with Ixodes spp. and apathogenic flaviviruses associated with Ornithodorus spp. ticks that feed on or parasitize, seabirds. the genus Flavivirus also includes 2 highly divergent genetic lineages not associated with any recognized group in the ninth report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [7], represented by Tamana bat virus [TABV] [11] and Ngoye virus [14]. Recently, another highly divergent lineage, Mogiana tick virus [MGTV], was isolated in Brazil [24]. awan virus was amplified in vero cell cultures. RNA was either extracted using the BioRobot EZ1 or RNA-Now. PCR was targeted at the E, NS3 and NS5 gene-conserved regions. the 5\u2019-terminal region of the genome was obtained using an E-gene specific reverse primer and a forward degenerate primer in the 5\u2019UTR designed using an alignment of available 5\u2019 UTRs of Culex-spp. associated flavivirus sequences (5\u2019-CULEX-S1: 5\u2019-AGwiGTTCryCTGyGTGArCT-3\u2019; position 1\u201321 of the Japanese encephalitis virus genome) Sequence analysis Sequences were refined using Sequencher 4.8 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) and combined with other flavivirus sequences available in the Genbank database. complete polyprotein ORF amino acid alignments were generated using both Clustal W2 [32,33] and MUSCLE [34] available at the EMBL server. a maximum clade credibility tree was summarised using Tracer v1.4.1. a range of nucleotide analyses were also conducted. a second data set of polyprotein ORF flaviviruses was compiled. the common ancestor of all South American YFV strains represents the lower boundary for the slave trade introduction. this node is therefore assumed to be older than 150 years. the beAST analysis was run for 20 million generations and diagnosized using Tracer. three viruses tentatively assigned to the genus Flavivirus, TABV [11], Ngoye virus [14] and Mogiana tick [24] virus were not included in analyses because they are genetically too divergent to be incorporated withoutambiguities using currently-available methods [10]. Viruses MBFVs included were all subcultured at least once in C6/36 cells. long-range PCR was conducted to complete the sequencing of gap between the E to NS3 genes, and NS3 to NS5 genes using the cMaster RTplusPCR system (Eppendorf) long-range PCR was conducted to complete the sequencing of gap between the E to NS3 genes. new complete polyprotein ORF sequences were performed using the Ion PGM Sequencer (Life Technologies SAS, Saint Aubin, France) [31] and a random reverse transcription-amplification protocol. reads, of minimum length 30 nucleotides, were trimmed using CLC Genomic Workbench 6.5 (QIAGEN Company) phylogeny of the ORF \u2018global genus\u2019 amino acid dataset was investigated. only posterior probabilities of 0.9 are included. tree is midpoint rooted. bar, 0.3 substitutions per site. time-calibration of the evolutionary history was based on the recognised slave-trade introduction of YFV to Brazil [12,44,45] the divergence of the South American YFV from the African YFV strains represents the upper boundary for the introduction. this node is assumed to be older than 449 years. nodes of interest are listed by black and red branches/nodes respectively. biogeographical data available ecological data, geographical dispersal patterns, host association and pathogenicity for all mosquito-borne flaviviruses were retrieved from the CRORA viral database. phylogenetic analysis Fig. 1 presents a phylogenetic tree based on all the sequence data yielding the highest posterior probabilities out of all analyses performed. the tree is based on amino acid sequences aligned using ClustalW2. ENTV and SOKV have been shown to replicate in C6/36 mosquito cells in vitro. the NKVSL that form a genetically distant clade do not replicate in mosquito cells. the addition of the complete ORF sequences of BCV, JUTV and PPBV corroborates and extends our knowledge. our analysis, based on complete ORF sequence data, confirmed this division of MBFVs into 2 major epidemiologically distinct vector groups. the vector was originally unknown for CHAOV (China) and BJV (Senegal) but these viruses have also been recently described in other locations [58]. CPCV CPCV is a bird-associated virus, isolated in brazil from the blood of the black-faced black-faced virus. CPCV CPCV is a bird-associated virus, isolated in brazil from the blood of the black-faced virus. YAOV, KOUV and KOUV represent ancestral lineages of WNV in the phylogenetic tree. YAOV has been isolated in africa in the Cameroon, central African Republic, Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast from birds, mammals and both Culex and Aedes mosquito species. KOUV was isolated in Senegal from rodents and also from a human following a laboratory infection. MVEV and ALFV share the same ecological niche and are considered to be a single species. MVEV causes hundreds of human cases of encephalitis annually in australia. there is only one unconfirmed case of mild polyarticular disease. NTAV NTAV was originally isolated in Uganda. the strain provisionally designated IPD/A was collected in the Cameroon region of Africa in 1966. this virus differs by only 0.08% in nucleotide sequence when compared with the original strain that was sequenced. STRV has only been isolated from Aedes vexans mosquitoes. KOKV was also isolated from Culex annulirostris [48] both in australia and papua new Guinea. STRV is not known to cause human pathology. the evolutionary origins and dispersal patterns of many of the flaviviruses can be tentatively deduced by considering their association between phylogenetic clustering and geographic location. all the clades are rooted by Old World Aedes-spp. associated viruses. to provide formal support for these observations, we performed a separate Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic estimate identifies, with high confidence, 11 independent nodes that represent introductions of mosquito-borne virus lineages (identified as A to E, F1\u20135 and G1\u20132) from the OW to the NW. table 1 summarizes the credible intervals for each node (or 95% HPD interval) divergence between OW ancestral deNV and NW strains is estimated to have occurred 1087 [1610\u2013649] years ago. the divergence between TBEV and European TBEV is estimated to have occurred about 572 [844\u2013328] years ago. the first outbreak of WNV in North America occurred in august 1999 in New York. the ancestral lineage of POWV in the NW has diverged to produce 2 lineages [79,84] namely the current POWV lineage and a variant that adapted to deer ticks, currently referred to as deer tick virus (DTV) this is depicted in Fig. 2 as node H, where the ancestral lineage is displayed in black on the assumption of an OW origin. TMRCA estimates for the other 6 NW lineages suggest that these viruses could have been introduced to the NW more than one thousand years before the initiation of historic commercial and slave trading across the Atlantic Ocean. TMRCA estimates for the other 6 NW lineages suggest that these viruses potentially could have been introduced to the NW more than one thousand years before the initiation of historic commercial and slave trading across the Atlantic Ocean. ancestral lineages emerged and dispersed eastwards into Asia. the TMRCA of the OW NKV, Apoi virus (APOIV) pre-dates all other recognised NKVSL. the TMRCA of the OW NKV, Apoi virus (APOIV) pre-dates all other recognised NKVSL. eukaryotic-1 frameshift site typically consists of a'slippery' heptanucleotide sequence fitting the consensus motif X_XXY_YYZ. A-site anticodon re-pairs from XXY to YYY, thus allowing for perfect re-pairing except at the wobble position. eukaryotic-1 frameshifting is stimulated (typically to a level between 1% and 50%) by the presence of a 3' stable RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or stem-loop, that is separated from the slippery heptanucleotide. ribosomes are positioned on the codons encoding the 8th and 9th amino acids of NS2A. substitutions that preserve the base-pairings in stem 1 (blue) or stem 2 (red) of the pseudoknot are indicated in pale blue and orange respectively. CPCV maintains the shift site but multiple possible 3'-proximal structures could be predicted. SLEV sequences lack a suitable shift site at this genomic location. analysis of nucleotide conservation at synonymous sites has previously been successful in identifying additional coding ORFs overlapping internal regions of the polyprotein ORF. a selection of these analyses is presented in Figs. 4 and 5. the predicted overlapping ORF in the DGV/LAMV clade is much shorter in DGV than in other members of the clade. the long form of the ORF is indicated. p-values can not be directly compared between different clades. most flaviviruses exhibit enhanced synonymous site conservation at the 5' end of the polyprotein ORF. this is associated with non-coding elements such as functional RNA structures involved in replication and/or translation enhancement. some flaviviruses exhibit localized regions of statistically significantly enhanced synonymous site conservation in internal regions of the polyprotein ORF. in the CHAOV-LAMV-DGV-ILOV clade enhanced synonymous site conservation is apparent in the region encoding NS2B. this is associated with a conserved G_GAU_UUU slippery heptanucleotide and a 3'-adjacent predicted stem-loop structure that stimulates-1 PRF in dual reporter assays. a dramatic and statistically significant peak in synonymous site conservation in an internal region was observed in one other frameshifting is predicted to occur on a conserved G_GUU_UUU heptanucleotide (orange) in the NS2A-encoding region, stimulated by a 3'-adjacent stem-loop structure. the-1 frame stop codon is indicated in red. a statistically significant peak in synonymous site conservation was also observed in the NS3-encoding region of TBEV and related flaviviruses. phylogenetic analysis Fig. 1 presents a phylogenetic tree based on all the sequence data yielding the highest posterior probabilities out of all analyses performed. the tree is based on amino acid sequences aligned using ClustalW2. there are high levels of support at all nodes. ENTV is an African virus isolated from the insectivorous migratory bat species. it seems reasonable to propose that SOKV emerged in africa and dispersed to Asia via transmission across areas of overlapping bat habitats. NKVSL that form a genetically distant clade do not replicate in mosquito cells. enies, the MBFVs were previously divided into 2 major groups reflecting their vector associations (i.e., Aedes- and Culex-associated groups), the principal vertebrate host and associated diseases. additional ISFV-like MBFVs became available for phylogenetic analysis. these viruses form two distinct groups that diverge from the previously recognised groups Aedes spp.-associated and Culex spp.-associated MBFV. the branching pattern of the tree implies that they emerged after the Aedes spp.-associated virus lineage but before the Culex spp.-associated virus lineage. this is compatible with 2 independent events during which these MBFVs lost their ability to infect vertebrate cells. YAOV, KOUV and WNV YAOV represent ancestral lineages of WNV in the phylogenetic tree. YAOV has been isolated in africa in the Cameroon, central african Republic, Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast from birds, mammals and both Culex and Aedes mosquito species. MVEV and ALFV share the same ecological niche and are considered to be a single species. MVEV causes hundreds of human cases of encephalitis annually in australia. there is only one unconfirmed case of mild polyarticular disease. TMUV, STWV, STWV and the recently described duck egg drop syndrome virus are closely related southern Asian strains. they are phylogenetically distinct from ITV and BAGV. they also cause severe disease pathologies in domestic birds. STRV is not known to cause human pathology, whereas KOKV is also isolated from Culex annulirostris. CPCV CPCV is a bird-associated virus, isolated in Brazil from the blood of the black-faced antbird. this virus has never been found in mosquitoes. the sequences of two viruses isolated in eastern Europe and Russia were also included in the phylogenetic analysis because they are related to, but show significant divergence, from WNV. the phylogeny supports previous suggestions that WNV has an African origin, as the African YAOV roots the WNV group. NTAV, ITV, TMUV and STWV are bird-associated viruses that cause encephalitis in poultry and wild birds. both viruses appear to have evolutionary origins in Africa. BAGV was recently identified as the aetiological agent of bird fatalities in birds in southern Spain. positive human serological evidence in many regions of africa confirms that NTAV does infect humans. both AROAV and NJLV were isolated from sentinel hamsters in south America. NJLV has also been isolated from Culex spp., mosquitoes. STRV has only been isolated from Aedes vexans mosquitoes. many new ISFVSL have been isolated and their sequence data are consistent with the concept that they should be classified as a fourth major group of flaviviruses. this is not surprising considering that the likely mosquito vectors of the two viruses, Coquillettidia and Mansonia spp., are considered by morphological data to be sister groups. the maximum clade credibility tree has strong branching support for most of the clades; all nodes had high posterior probabilities (> 0.95) except those labelled with a star (*) time-calibration was based on the principle that YFV was introduced from the Old World into the New World during the slave-trade [12,44,45] divergence between OW ancestral deNV and NW strains is estimated to have occurred 1087 [1610\u2013649] years ago. similar estimates for divergence are consistent with concept of human introduction of these viruses into the NW via the slave trade and other commercial exchanges. divergence between TBEV and LIV/SSEV occurred about 572 [844\u2013328] years ago. the first outbreak of WNV in north America occurred in august 1999 in new york. in the OW, the eastward dispersal of WNV seems to have occurred many years earlier. the ancestral lineage is depicted in Fig. 2 as node H, where the ancestral lineage is displayed in black on the assumption of an OW origin. the TMRCA estimates for the other 6 NW lineages suggest that these viruses could have been introduced to the NW more than one thousand years before the initiation of historic commercial and slave trading across the Atlantic Ocean. node E of Fig. 2 displays a TMRCA of 9400 years, which represents the common ancestor of the NW Aroa virus (AROAV) and Kokobera virus (KOKV) groups. the ILHV group emerged presumably in Africa and dispersed westward to the NW and eastward to Australia, in the OW. the TMRCA of the OW NKV imply that an ancestral lineage dispersed eastwards out of Africa before emerging the NKVs were introduced to the NW on at least two independent occasions. it has been suggested that these NKVs could have been introduced into the Americas during the Miocene/Pliocene period, possibly by migrating rodents and/or bats. XX represents any three identical nucleotides; YYY represents AAA or UUU; and Z represents A, C or U; and underscores separate zero-frame codons. some deviations from the canonical XXX of the slippery site are tolerated in the P-site, including UCC in some members of the JEV serogroup. the resulting 52 amino acid 'transframe' polypeptide is not cleaved at the NS1|NS2A cleavage site. the overlapping ORF displayed a constant length (43 codons) for all viruses within the JEV serogroup. the overlapping ORF displayed a constant length (43 codons) for all viruses within the JEV serogroup. a nucleotide alignment of putative stimulatory elements responsible for the-1 PRF is presented in Fig. 3b. the slippery heptanucleotide Y_CCU_UUU is absolutely conserved for CPCV, YAOV and KOUV as with other members of the JEV group except for SLEV. Fig 4. Synonymous site conservation analysis for selected flavivirus clades. alignments of 249 JEV serogroup, 49 NTAV/TMUV clade, 89 DENV, 6 DGV/LAMV clade and 29 CxFV/QBV clade polyprotein ORF sequences were analyzed. de, 6 WESSV/SEPV clade, 56 YFV, and 144 POWV/TBEV clade polyprotein ORF sequences were analyzed for synonymous site variability as decribed previously. the accession numbers of all sequences used in the analysis are available on request. enhanced synonymous site conservation is apparent in the NS2A/2B-encoding region. the overlapping ORF ranges from 270 to 293 codons in CxFV, QBV, PCV, NAKV and Cx theileri flavivirus, and 253 to 257 codons in KRV, CFAV, HANKV, AEFV and Ochlerotatus flavivirus. a dramatic and statistically significant peak in synonymous site conservation in an internal region was observed in one other clade of flaviviruses. this could represent an overlapping non-coding RNA element or yet another-1 PRF site. the overlapping ORF has just 7 codons, with the termination codon embedded within the predicted stem-loop structure. site conservation was also observed in the NS3-encoding region of TBEV and related flaviviruses. but the degree of conservation was relatively modest compared to what is typically observed at a PRF site. instead, it appears to correspond to a small conserved RNA stem-loop structure. NKVs share a common ancestor. the analysis confirms previous suggestions that the flaviviruses evolved from ancestral Aedes-associated viruses [8,12] but the recent discovery of several new viruses included in the ISFV-like group now reveals the possibility of two potentially new viruses. flaviviruses seem able to lose or acquire a variety of genetic traits. this is illustrated by acquisition of the requirement for a tick or mosquito vector. loss of ability to infect vertebrate cells, exemplified by the ENTV group. insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs) Until about 10 years ago, only one ISFV, cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), was recognised. at least 9 genetically distinguishable ISFVs have been isolated and their sequences determined. this compares with the genetic distance between the three current genera in the family Flaviviridae. our estimates are more accurate for the recent historical period than for the deepest nodes of the trees, and for mosquito-borne viruses than for tick-borne or no-known vector flaviviruses. the ancestral history provided clear indications that multiple introductions of viruses have occurred from the OW to the NW during relatively recent millenia. unless there is a matching, but largely unsampled flavivirus diversity in the NW, this remains the most plausible interpretation of their phylogenetic distribution. we do not consider our estimates to be a precise historical record of flavivirus evolution, but it does allow us to distinguish 2 major temporal periods during which flaviviruses may have been introduced from the OW into the NW. the most recent and persuasive example of an OW introduction to the NW was the spectacular appearance of west Nile virus (WNV) in august 1999. it is considered possible that WNV was inadvertently introduced into North America either via infected birds or mosquitoes transported to the new york area by air transport. the TMRCA for these introduced viruses predates the period of slave trading. other predicted introductions are presented in Fig. 2 nodes-C, B and D for ILHV/ROCV, SLEV and CPCV. if birds were a major cause of virus introduction into the NW, it seems surprising that viruses such as WNV have only been successfully introduced once. studies on Arenaviruses and Hantaviruses originally led to the development of the concept that viruses have co-evolved with their rodent hosts over time-scales of millions of years. but more recent studies do not support this concept since for hantaviruses, estimates of virus divergence are in the order of thousands of years. frameshifting in the MBFVs and ISFVs was previously reported that members of the JEV serocomplex express a transframe fusion protein, NS1', via-1 PRF. the frameshift-stimulatory elements\u2014a'slippery' heptanucleotide sequence and the potential to form a stable 3'-adjacent pseudoknot structure\u2014are conserved in all recognised members of the JEV serocomplex with exception of SL the acquisition of PRF at internal regions of the polyprotein ORF appears to be a common (though not ubiquitous) theme of flavivirus evolution. with the addition of 14 new flavivirus ORF sequences, the estimation of phylogenies via Bayesian methods, plus biogeographic and bioinformatic considerations. NW NKVSL ranged from 4000 to 14000 years ago. viruses could have dispersed to the NW thousands of years before transoceanic trading was taking place. it is now established that OW human populations (presumably of both Asian and European origin) became established in the Americas during the period of TMRCA estimates. we propose that the distinct differences of the ISFVs justify their inclusion as a separate genus in the family Flaviviridae. possible mechanisms of virus transfer between mosquito species include the diffusion of viruses between larvae at sites shared by different mosquito species. biting midges could become infected when taking blood meals from infected mosquitoes. the ancestral history presented in Fig. 2 provides clear indications that multiple introductions of viruses have occurred from the OW to the NW during relatively recent millenia. unless there is a matching, but largely unsampled flavivirus diversity in the NW, this remains the most plausible interpretation of their phylogenetic distribution. past few decades viruses are still being dispersed via human movement and commercial transportation. support for the concept that DENV can be included with YFV also comes from the known presence of the American genotype dengue viruses in South America that have African ancestral lineages. an ancestral virus present in the OW could have been introduced into the NW via rodents or migratory birds. other predicted introductions are presented in Fig. 2 nodes-C, B and D for ILHV/ROCV, SLEV and CPCV. NKVSL Apoi virus is an OW virus isolated in Japan from apodemus mice. the NKVSL Apoi virus roots all other NKVSL. modV was isolated in North America from Peromyscus mice. JUTV was isolated in south America. the uncertainty in the TMRCA is quite significant. there are clearly two periods of emergence, i.e. an \u201cancient period\u201d in the order of magnitude of thousands of years ago. estimates for the \u201cancient period\u201d including estimates for NKSL, are based on a single calibration event of an Aedes vectored virus (YFV) during the \u201crecent period\u201d. the CPCV sequence also lacks the potential to form the canonical JEV-serogroup 3' RNA stable pseudoknot that is associated with highly efficient-1 PRF (20\u201350%; [89]) potential frameshift sites have also been bioinformatically predicted for NOUV, CHAOV, LAMV and KEDV. similar introductions occurred eastwards from africa to australia. there have been far more introductory movements of flaviviruses than we have described here."}
