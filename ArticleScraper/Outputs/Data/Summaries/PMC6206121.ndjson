{"summary": "active surveillance was completed on 47 households in rural coastal Kenya over 6 months during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season. NPSs from 6 households were screened for 15 respiratory viruses. the remainder of households only for the most frequent viruses observed. the study period spanned from 8 December 2009 to 5 June 2010. households were eligible if they had an infant born since the end of the previous RSV epidemic in the study location. the study period spanned 1 complete RSV season. a detection rate of >5% were considered prevalent and constitute targets taken forward for screening of all the NPS collections. a week-delimited data on virus detections were plotted to show the temporal distributions and co-circulation at sampling, individual, and household level. the crude household and individual attack rates were stratified by age, symptom status, household size, and gender. the full assay targets were RSV A and B, rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza virus (PIV types 1\u20134), influenza (types A, B, and C) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) RESULTS Baseline Characteristics The median occupancy in the 47 households was 8 members (range, 4\u201337) the average age of the members in each household was 15.5 (95% confidence interval, 13.2\u201317.9) years. the baseline characteristics of the 6 households that were screened for all the 15 respiratory targets were similar. the proportion of samples that were virus positive was higher for specimens collected while the individual had symptoms compared with specimens collected during asymptomatic periods (52.0% [275/529] vs 25.4% [589/2315], respectively; 2P.0001).

RV, AdV, HCoV, and RSV were the most prevalent respiratory viruses. they were found in all the 6 households, infecting at least 1 member. they were taken forward as the prevalent targets for screening of the NPS collection. of the HCoVs detected, 627 (49.2%), 399 (31.3%), and 212 (16.6%) were single infections of OC43, NL63, and 229E. 36 (2.8%) had mixed HCoV strains. frequency distribution of virus infections in the community during the study period is shown for the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen. each household had a median of 6 (range, 3\u20137) detected over the study period. a higher median number (9 [range, 8\u201315] of targets were detected for the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen. of the 7 selected virus targets, each household had a median of 6 (range, 3\u20137) detected over the 6-month study period. adenoviruses had a consistently high prevalence with no apparent peak times. prevalence of RV was at its peak in January, gradually declined over the study period, and was at its lowest at the end of May 2010. from the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen, similar seasonal patterns were observed. the individual risk of infection was 93.4% (451 individuals), 80.1% (387), 71.6% (346), 61.5% (297) and 37.1% (179) for any virus, RV, HCoV, and RSV, respectively. the individual risk of infection was 61.7% (298 individuals), 49.5% (239), 34.0% (164), 27.3% (132), and 22.0% (106), respectively. any Virus Rhinovirus Adenovirus Coronavirus RSV Age, y 1 55 53 (96.4) 52 (94.5) 28 (50.9) 42 (76.4) 31 (56.4) 1\u20134 82 80 (97.6) 79 (96.6) 64 (78.0) 64 (78.0) 41 (50.0) 5\u201314 163 157 (96.3) 144 (88.3) 118 (72.4) 125 (76.7) 66 (40.5) 37 (78.7) 27 (57.4) Sibling 170 162 (95.3) 141 (82.9) 113 (66.5) 129 (75.9) 60 (35.3) No. of individuals per HH 4\u20137 95 93 (97.9) 84 (88.4) 66 (69.5) 75 (78.9) 48 (50.5) 8\u201310 120 109 (90.8) 100 (83.3) 87 (72.5) 77 (64.2) 26 (21.7) 11\u201316 144 135 (93.8) 110 (76.4) 77 (53.5) 97 data from the 47 households with 483 participants are presented. 16928 samples collected were tested. 2844 samples from 6 households (80 individuals) with full respiratory virus screen. the proportion of samples that were virus positive was higher for specimens collected while the individual had symptoms compared with specimens collected during asymptomatic periods. of the 2844 NPS collections screened, the number positive, by pathogen, was 302 (10.6%) for RV, 270 (9.5%) for AdV, 217 (7.6%) for RSV, 63 (2.2%) for PIV, 13 (0.5%) HMPV, and 11 (0.4%) for influenza. human coronavirus 6 (100.0) 58 (72.5) 217 (7.6) 47 (100.0) 346 (71.6) 1274 (7.5) OC43 5 (83.3) 45 (56.3) 116 (4.1) 44 (93.6) 215 (44.5) 651 (3.8) NL63 4 (66.7) 35 (43.8) 95 (3.3) 33 (70.2) 163 (33.7) 418 (2.5) 229E 3 (50.0) 7 (8.8) 8 (0.3) 30 (63.8) 119 the number of individuals with at least 1 infection of any of the target viruses was 75 (93.8%), 62 (77.5%), 57 (71.3%), 58 (72.5%), 52 (65.0%), 37 (46.3%), 11 (13.8%), and 8 (10.0%), respectively. the temporal infection profile for the 6 households showing positive samples for each member is shown in Figure 1. of the 16928 NPS collections, 4259 (25.2%) were positive for 1 or more of the selected respiratory virus targets. of the virus positives, 3687 (86.6%) were single virus detections, 526 (12.4) were dual, and 45 (1.1%) were triple. the frequency distribution of the viruses circulating in the community during the study period is shown for the 6 households with full respiratory virus screen vs the 47 households with select respiratory screen. for comparison, Figure 2C illustrates the frequency distribution of virus infections in pediatric (5 years old) pneumonia admissions to Kilifi County Hospital over the same period [6]. panels A\u2013C represent the screening for common respiratory pathogens in all the 47 households. panels D\u2013F show full screening in the six households. adenoviruses had a consistently high prevalence with no apparent peak times. nasopharyngeal swabs were rarely detected throughout the 6-month study period. the individual risk of infection was 93.4% (451 individuals), 80.1% (387), 71.6% (346), 61.5% (297), and 37.1% (179) for any virus. the pattern of attack rates according to relationships was similar to that of the age groups. for the symptomatic infections, only RSV showed a significant association by household size. for symptomatic infections, only RSV showed a significant association by household size. infant 47 46 (97.9) 45 (95.7) 26 (55.3) 37 (78.7) 27 (57.4) Sibling 162 157 (96.9) 154 (95.1) 124 (76.5) 124 (76.5) 87 (53.7) Cousin 124 116 (93.5) 100 (80.6) 76 (61.3) 91 (73.4) 56 (45.2) Mother 46 45 (97.8) 35 (76.1) 29 (63.0) 27 (58.7) 16 (34.8) Father 30 25 (8 the bold values indicate statistical significance based on 2 test (P.05) abbreviations: HH, household; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; HCoV, human coronavirus; RV, rhinovirus. study identified OC43 as the most common HCoV strain. some of the pathogens were uncommon, and it is likely that a seasonal peak of some viruses fell outside the study period. peak occurrence of influenza (A or B) is in the second half of each year. individuals in larger households (>7 members) had lower attack rates than in smaller households. this pattern was significant for RV, AdV, and RSV. this may be related to the structure of households, which comprise 1 or more building units. the molecular screen of these specimens revealed continuous and considerable respiratory virus circulation and infection frequency in this population. the remarkable frequency of virus infections of multiple species and strains lend itself to an ecological analysis of interactions that may be influential in virus ecology. the etiology of respiratory disease and immunological burden of respiratory viruses in children is worthy of further study. sydney"}
