{"summary": "the human adenoviruses in the Mastadenovirus genus are classified into 7 species A-G. at least 51 different serotypes have been described to date. adenoviruses are the cause of an estimated 5\u201310% of febrile illnesses in children worldwide. phylogenetic analyses of adenoviruses from greater apes reveal that they fall precisely into human adenoviral species B, C, and E [7] virochip has been previously successful in detection of novel outbreak viruses such as the SARS coronavirus [22], [24] and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. the index case, a healthy adult titi monkey, presented on may 14, 2009 with cough, lethargy, and decreased appetite. despite aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, the animal developed severe respiratory distress and was humanely euthanized 5 days later. in the interim period, 3 healthy titi monkeys had been relocated from a separate building. only 4 monkeys survived, even though the majority of sick animals consisted of apparently healthy adults and juveniles. none of the 133 rhesus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) housed in the same building became sick during the outbreak. photomicrograph of H&E stained liver tissue showing a severe diffuse necrotizing bronchopneumonia characterized by the presence of hemorrhage and intranuclear inclusions (arrows). the results were similar in all titi monkeys and were characterized by diffuse, consolidated pneumonias. microarrays were analyzed using ranked Z-scores to assess the highest-intensity viral probes. 4 of the top 80 probes on the Virochip corresponded to adenoviruses. other viruses or viral families with 4 probes among the top 80 were less likely to cause pneumonia and hepatitis. the 4 Virochip probe sequences are aligned with the corresponding sequence in the TMAdV genome. the actual coverage achieved by deep sequencing as determined by alignments to the fully sequenced genome of TMAdV is much higher (red) va, conjunctival swabs, oral swabs, and nasal swabs were negative from a throat swab from an asymptomatic animal whose other 5 cage mates had become sick. in addition, nasal swabs were negative in 3 asymptomatic, minimal-risk titi monkeys housed in a separate building. serum samples from at-risk asymptomatic or affected surviving monkeys were negative for TMAdV by PCR (Table 1). to assess potential TMAdV shedding, stool samples collected from all cages housing titi monkeys. adenovirus PCR was performed on a TMAdV-positive clinical sample, a TMAdV culture, and a human adenovirus B culture (as a positive control) three of the 5 primer pairs, designed to detect human respiratory adenoviruses B, C, and E, failed to amplify TMAdV. the complete genome of TMAdV was found to be 36,842 base pairs in length, with a base composition of 20.8% A, 29.8% C, 29.8% G, and 19.6% T, and a GC content of 59.6%. the deduced genomic structure of TMAdV was similar to that of other mastadenoviruses. logenetic analysis was also observed when looking individually at the hexon, polymerase, penton base, and fiber genes. among the major adenovirus genes, the DNA polymerase and hexon are more conserved, whereas the E1A and fiber are more divergent. the significant overall sequence divergence of TMAdV from known human and simian adenoviruses is highlighted. the scanning nucleotide pairwise identities of representative adenoviruses with TMAdV are shown. the window size is 400 bp with a step size of 40 bp. the high level of sequence divergence in TMAdV held true at the amino acid level as well. the closest phylogenetic relative to TMAdV in GenBank overall was SAdV-3. no evidence for recombination of TMAdV with other adenoviruses at either the whole-genome or individual gene level. 66.5% 68.1% 72.4%

neutralization determinant for adenoviruses, the epsilon determinant (29) is formed by loops 1 and 2 in the hexon protein. the epsilon determinant of TMAdV was significantly divergent from that of other mastadenoviruses. only one individual at the CNPRC reported becoming ill during the titi monkey outbreak. symptoms began near the onset of the outbreak, although whether they began prior to or after identification of the index case is unclear. nineteen serum samples from 15 at-risk affected (symptomatic) titi monkeys were tested. 2 monkeys mounted a vigorous neutralizing Ab response to TMAdV. affected titi monkeys exhibited a wide range of neutralizing Ab titers. fourteen of 40 asymptomatic titi monkeys tested (35%) had antibody to TMAdV. one of the 14 asymptomatic titi monkeys with positive Ab titers was located in the minimal-risk building. only 1 of 36 rhesus macaque samples was positive, with an Ab titer of 116. index case, a healthy adult titi monkey, presented on may 14, 2009 with cough, lethargy, and decreased appetite. despite aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, the animal developed severe respiratory distress and was humanely euthanized 5 days later. a second case presented 4 weeks later near the entrance to the building. 133 rhesus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) became sick during the outbreak. none of the old world monkeys from surrounding outdoor colonies of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were sick during the outbreak. titi monkeys were characterized by diffuse, consolidated pneumonias. some livers, spleens, and lymph nodes were found to be abnormally enlarged. virochip identification, PCR screening and electron microscopic confirmation of TMAdV. microarrays were analyzed using ranked Z-scores to assess the highest-intensity viral probes. 4 of the top 80 probes on the Virochip corresponded to adenoviruses. other viruses or viral families with 4 probes among the top 80 were less likely to cause fulminant pneumonia and hepatitis. coverage map of deep sequencing reads corresponding to TMAdV. x-axis refers to nucleotide position along 37k genome. fragment shared 86% nucleotide identity with closest

negative in 3 asymptomatic, minimal-risk titi monkeys housed in separate building. serum samples from at-risk asymptomatic or affected surviving monkeys were negative for TMAdV by PCR. stool samples collected from all cages housing titi monkeys 2 months after outbreak were analyzed by PCR. swab samples from rhesus macaques were negative for TMAdV by PCR. PCR was performed on a TMAdV-positive clinical sample, a TMAdV culture, and a human adenovirus B culture (as a positive control) three of the 5 primer pairs, designed to detect human respiratory adenoviruses B, C, and E, failed to amplify TMAdV. the complete genome of TMAdV was found to be 36,842 base pairs in length, with a base composition of 20.8% A, 29.8% C, 29.8% G, and 19.6% T. the deduced genomic structure of TMAdV was also similar to that of other mastadenoviruses. otide pairwise identity plots revealed that among the major adenovirus genes, the DNA polymerase and hexon are more conserved, whereas the E1A and fiber are more divergent. the significant overall sequence divergence of TMAdV from known human and simian adenoviruses is highlighted by the findings. the scanning nucleotide pairwise identities of representative adenoviruses with TMAdV are shown. the window size is 400 bp with a step size of 40 bp. the x-axis refers to the nucleotide position along the 37 k genome. bootscanning analysis revealed no evidence for recombination of TMAdV with other adenoviruses at either the whole-genome or individual gene level. adenoviruses may have been recombinated with other adenoviruses at either the whole-genome or individual gene level. 68.3% 74.0% 33.3% 60.0% HAdV-36 (species D) 20.8% 30.0% 38.1% 63.3% 65.9% 68.3% 73.6% 33.1% 61.9% HAdV-4 (species E) 26.3% 32.6%* 37.1% 62.8% 67.9% 69.8% 72.7% 30.6% 63.3% SAdV-22 (species E) 27.5%* 31. the epsilon determinant is formed by loops 1 and 2 in the hexon protein. amino acid identities in loop 1 varying from 30.6% to 44.8%. in loop 2 varying from 54.4% to 67.0%. only one individual at the CNPRC reported becoming ill during the titi monkey outbreak. symptoms began near the onset of the outbreak, although whether they began prior to or after identification of the index case is unclear. the researcher initially developed symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) nineteen serum samples from 15 at-risk affected (symptomatic) titi monkeys were tested. 2 monkeys mounted a vigorous neutralizing Ab response to TMAdV. affected titi monkeys exhibited a wide range of neutralizing Ab titers. one of the 14 asymptomatic titi monkeys with positive Ab titers was located in the minimal-risk building. only 1 of 36 rhesus macaque samples was positive, with an Ab titer of 116. the 1 antibody-positive rhesus serum sample was negative by specific PCR for TMAdV. new adenovirus, TMAdV, is the cause of the outbreak. adenovirus strains such as HAdV-14 and HAdV-D22/H8 (otherwise known as HAdV-D53) are known to arise from adenovirus strains. bootscanning analysis failed to show evidence of recombination. the bootscanning analysis, however, failed to show evidence of recombination. despite its isolation from affected titi monkeys, we were unable to propagate TMAdV in both established (BSC-1) and primary (PMK) monkey kidney cells. virulence of TMAdV in healthy and apparently immunocompetent titi monkeys is highly unusual for infections by adenovirus. severe infections from human adenoviruses are more commonly associated with older age, immunosuppression, and chronic underlying conditions. the closest identified phylogenetic relative to TMAdV among the complete genomic sequences available in GenBank is a rhesus monkey adenovirus, SAdV-3 (Fig. 4; Table 2). serological evidence for cross-species adenoviral transmission events between different nonhuman primate species has been previously reported in the literature. pleurisy has been specifically reported in association with certain human adenovirus infections. the clinical presentation, time of illness concurrent with the onset of the outbreak, and presence of neutralizing Abs in convalescent serum all strongly point to primary infection of the researcher. the decreased levels of neutralizing Abs to TMAdV in the researcher (132) are consistent with a recent study showing much higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in chimpanzees than in humans with adenovirus infections. 2 of 81 random adult blood donors exhibited borderline titers of neutralizing antibody to TMAdV. no evidence of cross-reactivity was found with HAdV serotypes 1 through 35. the study highlights the need to monitor adenoviruses closely for outbreak or even pandemic potential. sera from random blood donors were obtained from the Blood Systems Research Institute (San Francisco, CA); sera were derived from affiliated donor banks in California (Blood Centers of the Pacific, San Francisco, CA), Nevada (United Blood Service, Reno, NV) and de-identified prior to analysis. no new animals have been introduced into either colony for over 2 years. the remaining 6 titi monkeys were housed in an animal building greater than 500 yards from the at-risk population. the outbreak lasted approximately 3 months from may to august 2009. titi monkeys died from 3\u201324 days after appearance of clinical signs. 3-m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined by light microscopy. tissue fragments were excised from paraffin blocks of lung, deparaffinized, and processed as previously described. high-intensity probes to simian adenoviruses not seen by Virochip analysis. genomes of many simian Ads, including SAdV-3 and SAdV-18, were not sequenced until after 2004 [7], [49] and thus their genomes are not as well-represented on the Virochip microarray. slides were scanned at 3 m resolution using an Agilent DNA microarray Scanner. the TMAdV-specific quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Stratagene MX3005P real-time PCR system using a 25 L master mix. conditions for the PCR reaction were 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. a standard curve for the TMAdV PCR assay was calculated from 3 PCR replicates at each dilution of nucleic acid extracted from the spiked matrix. probit analysis of results from 6 PCR replicates of 7 serial log dilutions (from a starting concentration of 1.2105 copies/mL) was performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) by probit analysis, the 95% limit of detection for TMAdV was 781 reads were aligned using BLASTN alignments (word size = 11, E-value = 1105) and TBLASTX (word size = 11, E-value = 1105) to the genome sequence of SAdV-18. each read consisting of 67 nucleotides, for a total of 800 megabases of sequence. all 95 fully sequenced unique adenovirus genomes were first downloaded from GenBank. multiple sequence alignments were then performed on a 48-core Linux system. trees were constructed after bootstrapping to 1000 replicates by neighbor-joining method in Geneious [54], [56] n green monkey kidney epithelial cell lines and PMK (primary rhesus monkey kidney) cells are routinely maintained at the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory. media consisting of Hank's medium (for A549 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for BSC-1 cells) were supplemented with 1nonessential amino acids. as a control for each serum sample, 55 L of culture media and 55 L of serum were mixed. 4,000 cells in 100 L of media were added to each well of a 96-well plate. cells in the plate wells were observed for evidence of CPE every other day for 1 week. annotated, whole-genome sequence of TMAdV has been submitted to GenBank (accession number HQ913600) deep sequencing reads have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession number SRA031285). the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC) is a part of the National Primate Research Centers Program. at the beginning of 2009, the CNPRC maintained a colony of 74 titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) and a colony of 4,500 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) no new animals have been introduced into either colony for over 2 years. personnel entering titi monkey rooms needed to pass within 20 feet of macaque enclosures. staff compliance of this policy may have been compromised. clinical samples were sent to an outside laboratory. Virochip analysis The current 860 k Virochip microarrays used in this study contain 19,058 70mer probes representing all viral species in GenBank. four probes derived from 2 different Adenoviridae genera (SAdV-23, PAdV-A, HAdV-5, and FAdV-D) yielded an adenovirus signature on the Virochip that was found to be TMAdV. Virochip microarrays were analyzed with Z-score analysis [18], hierarchical cluster analysis [50], and E-Predict, an automated computational algorithm for viral species prediction from microarrays. only Z-score analysis, a method for assessing statistical significance of individual Virochip probes, yielded a credible viral signature. nucleoside triophosphates (dNTPs; 12.5 mM), 0.5 L of each primer (10 M), 0.5 L SYBR green, 0.5 L of Taq polymerase (invitrogen, CA), and 1 L of extracted nucleic acid were purified on a 2% agarose gel. conditions for the PCR reaction were 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s the 95% limit of detection for TMAdV was 781, 377, or 35 viral genome equivalents/mL for serum, stool, or oral swab samples. whole-genome sequencing To facilitate whole-genome sequencing of TMAdV, we prepared amplified cDNA/DNA libraries for deep sequencing from lung tissue and a lung swab sample from 2 different monkeys using previously published protocols. -value = 1105) and TBLASTX (word size = 11, E-value = 1105) were used to assemble portions of the TMAdV genome with Geneious software (version 3.6.5) [54] using the SAdV-18 genome as a reference sequence. aligning reads were also used to design PCR primers to close remaining gaps in the TMAdV genome. all 95 fully sequenced unique adenovirus genomes were first downloaded from GenBank. multiple sequence alignments were then performed on a 48-core Linux system. trees were constructed after bootstrapping to 1000 replicates by the neighbor-joining method in Geneious [54], [56]. d with 1nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin/mL and 100 g of streptomycin/mL. clinical samples were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min4000 g. cell culture media were changed to maintenance media with 2% FBS. 100 L of mixture were inoculated into appropriate wells containing 4,000 cells per well. the entire plate was placed in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator. cells in the plate wells were observed for evidence of CPE every other day for 1 week. analysis of the hexon, polymerase, penton base, and fiber genes of TMAdV is performed. the branch corresponding to TMAdV is highlighted in boldface red. the branch corresponding to TMAdV is highlighted in boldface red."}
