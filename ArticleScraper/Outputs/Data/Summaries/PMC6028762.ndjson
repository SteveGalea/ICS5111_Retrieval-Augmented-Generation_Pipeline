{"summary": "the proportion of people in the united states who are members of at least two ethnic groups is projected to increase to 10% by the year 2050. this makes addressing health disparities and health inequities in minority populations increasingly more difficult. mHealth in the united states has the ability to increase prevention and health education in health disparate communities. mobile health (mHealth) can present opportunities for researchers and program developers to capitalize on the existing cultural behaviors of their target populations. mobile cellular subscriptions have reached 90% of the world\u2019s population and have reached nearly 80% of the global population living in rural areas. mHealth interventions have become increasingly common in low-income and third world countries. the proportion of people in the u.s. who are members of at least 2 ethnic groups will increase 10% by the year 2050, complicating assessments of health disparities. recent technology trends in the u.s. indicate mobile phone usage and smartphone adoption rates by those experiencing the highest rates of health disparities are increasing. as of 2011, non-white mobile phone users were found to text more often than white mobile phone users. those with lower levels of income and education were found to text more often than those with higher levels of income and education. smartphone owners (mean 52.0; median 20) also send and receive a significantly larger number of texts per day than owners of more basic phones. mHealth in the united states mobile phone use has become a part of daily life for most people in the united states. mobile cellular subscriptions have reached 90% of the world\u2019s population and have reached nearly 80% of the global population living in rural areas. mHealth interventions have become increasingly common in low-income and third world countries. mobile phones are a more cost-effective way to access health information for those of a lower socioeconomic status. mobile technologies have potential to ameliorate the management of chronic diseases and smoking cessation while simultaneously improving communication. 80% of all american mobile phone owners text, 92% of american smartphone owners text, and US SMS users text, on average, 35 texts per day. mHealth: text messaging and mobile apps are gaining momentum in the united states. the lowest rates of high-speed internet access at home compared those who classify themselves as white. this has significantly increased from 2000 to 2010. a doubling of internet use from 11% to 21% has increased from 11% to 21%. keywords related to historically underserved and minority populations, health, and mHealth technology were used to create a total of 18 preselected search phrases. a total of 18 preselected search phrases were created for the systematic literature review. the systematic literature review results were organized and reported based on identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion criteria. the matrix method was also used for papers that met the inclusion criteria following review of the abstract and full papers. a coding matrix was created with rows and columns summarizing key sections in each article. health, and mHealth technology were used to create a total of 18 preselected search phrases. the complete list is available in Textbox 1. systematic literature review results were organized and reported based on identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion criteria. a coding matrix was created with rows and columns summarizing key sections in each article. authors, title, journal, year, purpose, study design, theoretical constructs, demographic characteristics of the study participants. 1 study addressed Korean American women. the 2 most commonly included issues were diabetes and sexual, reproductive, and maternal and child health. other key issues included influenza vaccinations and health. study aimed to test the feasibility of enrollment, participation, and retention of young black men in a SMS text message program for HIV prevention. a total of 67% of control group members completed the assessment and program; 63% of intervention group members completed the assessment and program. study presented unforeseen challenges in relation to motivations for participation and communication. participants sought prenatal care information on the web (5%), alcoholic consumption decreased after confirmation of their pregnancy (3% to 1%), consumption of 3 or more servings of fruit a day increased (3%), and tobacco use decreased in the last 30 days (6% to 1%). participants were 3 times more likely to believe they were more prepared to be a new mother. y program read the messages and planned on continuing with the program despite disruption of the mobile service. over two-thirds of the women had no month to month mobile phone plan, which affected response rate and message reception. participants were randomly assigned to one of the 2 physical activity interventions for 8 consecutive weeks. participants self-reported their physical activity levels, psychosocial variables, and satisfaction of the program. participants in the study also self-reported their physical activity levels, psychosocial variables, and satisfaction of the program. study looked at 3 behaviors: proportion of condom-protected sexual acts in 6 months and 90 days before assessments, number of sexual episodes while participants were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. fewer participants had chlamydia infections in the experimental group than in the condition group, 20% reduction rate, and also fewer gonococcal infections (48 to 54). the study included 75 participants with 1 group receiving an average of 26 calls, 2.2 times per week. an average of 10 phone calls per week were completed. challenges included difficulty reaching participants and phone numbers becoming disconnected. study was conducted by Steinberg et al to examine the correlation between IVR self-monitoring and weight change among black women. intervention participants were asked to self-monitor their behavior and change goals via weekly IVR phone calls. participants with an IVR completion of 80% showed higher weight loss numbers than participants with less than 80% completion rate. 23% of participants received pap tests, 83% satisfied with the program. 97% said they would recommend the program to others. text messaging to motivate exercise is common in the Latino population. data were collected for 44 weeks from 789 people, making up 161 households. they received SMS text messages twice a week, urging them to report if anyone in the household was sick. if participants reported they were ill, a home visit was conducted to obtain a nasal swab. the most prevalent demographic variables included being a female (woman), urban and/or metropolitan setting, and having participants aged between 15 and 30 years. 9 of the 16 studies focused on populations who classify themselves as African American or a mix of populations who classify themselves as African American and Latino and/or Hispanic. only 8 of the 16 studies used SMS text messaging as a communication strategy. men received SMS text messages 3 times a week for 12 weeks about nutrition and sexual health. follow-up assessments performed after 12 weeks and afterward. HIV Prevention: The 411 for Safe Text project is an mHealth intervention that utilized SMS text messages to deliver HIV prevention program among 60 young black men aged between 16 and 20 years. the men in the study received SMS text messages 3 times a week for 12 weeks about nutrition (control group) and sexual health (intervention group), with follow-up assessments performed after 12 weeks and afterward. text4baby mobile health program sent text messages that offered just-in-time tips geared at improving prenatal and postpartum health outcomes in disparate women. participants sought prenatal care information on the web (5% to 1%), alcoholic consumption decreased after confirmation of their pregnancy (3% to 1%), consumption of 3 or more servings of fruit a day increased (3%), and tobacco use decreased in the last 30 days (6% to 1%). text4baby program: an opportunity to reach underserved pregnant and postpartum women. 9 out of 10 participants read the messages and planned on continuing with the program despite disruption of the mobile service. over two-thirds of women had no month to month mobile phone plan. 5% enjoyed the video and enjoyed being able to watch the videos on their phone wherever they went. disadvantages included damaged mobile phones, stolen mobile phones, misplacing login information, and server issues. an alternative identified to accessing the videos via their emails included the creation of a mobile app. participants were recruited from 3 clinics in Atlanta, GA, including african american adolescent girls aged 14 to 20 years. all participants received primary treatment and were split into 2 groups to receive supplemental treatment to help the effects of the primary treatment. the experimental group (n=343) was provided an STI intervention plan and was contacted by telephone every 8 weeks for 36 months. 67 participants completed the 6-month program with follow up. one-third of participants reported well-controlled diabetes, one-third reported moderately controlled diabetes, and one-third reported poorly controlled diabetes. at 6 months of the program, participants were performing self-foot care and exercise. a total of 63% reported having sex at the age of 13 years or younger. a total of 23.7% of teens reported to having more than one partner within the past 3 months. 37% of teen, ages 14-15, reported to having concurrent sexual partners. a focus group with 13 women from the target population was developed according to the community-based participatory research approach. the focus group determined the target populations\u2019 actions, motivators, and barriers. participants received personalized texts about cervical health and screenings at their specified times for 7 consecutive days. study consisted of 60 low-income women who had breast cancer and cancer-related pain. participants in the intervention group received phone calls twice a week. control group received usual care of pain and symptom management given by the clinic. researchers designed a randomized control trial where parents of the target population would receive SMS text messages promoting influenza vaccines. parents received a series of automated SMS text messages over 5 weeks featuring educational information specific to the child\u2019s age, which provided notification of upcoming vaccine clinics. researchers conducted a randomized control trial assigning 238 participants to both comparison (text) and intervention (video) groups. if participants failed to watch the video by a particular benchmark in the week, reminders were made to account for possible attrition and track intervention fidelity. participants self-reported their physical activity levels, psychosocial variables, and satisfaction of the program. the other group delivered the intervention by mailing brochures to participants\u2019 homes. participants self-reported their physical activity levels, psychosocial variables and satisfaction of the program. fewer gonococcal infections (48 to 54), fewer condom use and fewer sexual acts. STI maintenance interventions in adolescents are critical because the population is at such high risk. participants classified themselves as African American and lived in urban community. study gathered information on teens\u2019 values, social support, self-efficacy, trouble with the law, and sexual activity. 30 males and 29 females, aged 14 to 18 years, were recruited. one-third of participants were African American and two-thirds were Latino. participants were asked to self-monitor their behavior and change goals via weekly IVR phone calls, which lasted 2 to 4 min on average. participants with an IVR completion of 80% showed higher weight loss numbers than participants with less than 80% completion rate [29] participants were to be 50 years or older with one or more atherosclerotic risk factors. the trial consisted of a questionnaire to measure physical activity and time active. participants then received 30 text messages using software that allowed confirmation receipts of text messages. authors found that mobile phone use is common in the Latino population. if anyone in the household was ill, a home visit was conducted to obtain a nasal swab. if a patient showed symptoms, it took a median of 2 days for them to receive a nasal swab. this is important when we compare the potential of mHealth in underserved, low SES populations. mHealth has proven to be a potential route in reducing the incidence and prevalence of health disparities among our disadvantaged and underserved populations. most of the current apps are developed from the perspective of the health care system versus public health interventions to underserved communities. 7 of the studies in this review were randomized control trials and 3 were pilot studies that provided little to no information about the long-term effectiveness of mHealth strategies relating to that topic area. only 4 of those studies incorporated theories from health education and behavior, identified as Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Transtheoretical Model, and the Health Belief Model [23]. mHealth has potential for influencing behaviors within public health and health education, particularly with regard to underserved and minority populations due to increased access to smartphones. more research studies need to be conducted in the united states using SMS text messaging and additional mHealth strategies such as mobile apps gamification. mobile services are being used to disseminate locally-generated and locally-relevant educational and health information. there is evidence to suggest that this type of benefit could save lives in rural communities. this highlights the need for similar mHealth interventions to benefit this population subgroup. most of the current apps are developed from the perspective of the health care system for the general population versus public health interventions to underserved communities. research regarding the use of mHealth interventions for the populations that need it the most remains sparse. only 4 studies incorporated theories from health education and behavior. this highlights the need for newer health behavior models applicable to mHealth interventions. the review is limited by the nature of the literature search. mHealth has potential for influencing behaviors within public health and health education. more research studies need to be conducted in the united states using SMS text messaging and additional mHealth strategies such as mobile apps gamification, and mobile Web (mWeb) there is evidence to suggest that this type of benefit could save lives in rural communities. this highlights the need for similar mHealth interventions to benefit this population subgroup."}
