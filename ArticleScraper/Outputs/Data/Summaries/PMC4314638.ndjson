ELISAs were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. after 3 washes with TBST, the blots were incubated in secondary HRP\u2013conjugated anti\u2013mouse/rabbit IgG. after washing with TBST 3 times, the membranes were developed with a chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit. beta actin was used as an endogenous reference for normalization. animals Sprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing 200\u2013250 g were obtained from the department of laboratory animal science of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. the rats were euthanized after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. the lungs were removed and washed with 30 mL ice\u2013cold serum\u2013free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. the cells at 80\u201390% confluence were harvested by treating with 0.25% trypsin\u2013 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) the cells at 80\u201390% confluence were harvested by treating with 0.25% trypsin\u2013 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. an invalid RNA interference sequence (5\u2032\u2013GAAGCCAGATCCAGCTTCC\u20133\u2032) was used as the negative control. the corresponding oligonucleotide templates of the shRNAs were chemically synthesized. each ligation mixture was transformed into competent strain DH5. normal or lentivirus-infected (LV\u2013Ace2 or LV\u2013shRNA\u2013Ace2) were seeded into 96\u2013well plates (1 104 cells/well) and incubated with serum\u2013free DMEM for 24 h. PMVECs, whether normal or infected, were then pretreated (or not) with 100 nM A779 for 2 h and then stimulated (or not) with 1 mg/mL LPS for 48 h cells were harvested, washed 3 times with PBS, centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min, and resuspended in 500 L of binding buffer (0.1 M Hepes/NaOH, 1.4 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) the cell suspension was subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur. the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris\u2013buffered saline (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4)/0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. the blots were probed with a primary antibody against rat ACE (1:400), ACE2 (1:500), ERK1/2 (1:400), SAPK/JNK (1:500), phosphorylated P65 for cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 + LPS group) the rate of apoptosis was 37.60% (P 0.05) but this was significantly lower than that of PMVECs infected with shRNA\u2013ACE2 treated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group; 85.85%; P 0.05). ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (53.80%) and the LPS group (55.07%) effects of ACE2 and Mas\u2013receptor antagonist A779 on cytokine secretion in PMVECs. LPS\u2013induced IL\u20131 and TNF\u2013 secretions were significantly inhibited by ACE2 overexpression. effects of ACE2 and Mas\u2013receptor antagonist A779 on AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137) secretion in PMVECs. Ang\u2013(1\u20137) levels in the LPS group were significantly higher than that of the PBS control group (10.99 4.03 ng/mL; P 0.05) LPS exposure for 48 h caused a significant increase of AngII. increase of Ang\u2013(1\u20137) was markedly attenuated by ACE2 overexpression. but, Ang\u2013(1\u20137) level was not affected by A779 pretreatment. PS group; 10.12 2.80 ng/mL) were slightly less than these levels in the LPS group (15.49 3.41; P > 0.05), and those of the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (16.23 5.17 ng/mL) were only slightly higher. effects of ACE2 and Mas\u2013receptor antagonist A779 on ACE2/ACE ratio. ACE2/actin and ACE/actin levels were significantly lower in normal PMVECs treated with A779 prior to LPS (a779 + LPS group; 0.2187 and 0.5462; P 0.05 for both) the ACE2/ACE ratio was also notably lower in the A779 + LPS group compared to the control group. PMVECs transduced with shRNA\u2013Ace2 and incubated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group) had significantly higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, but levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK were similar. ACE2 overexpression effectively reduced LPS\u2013induced p38 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation levels, but ERK1/2 phosphorylation was unaffected. levels of phosphorylated p38 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group were markedly lower (P 0.05) there was no obvious difference in these levels between the ACE2 + A779 + LPS and LPS groups. phosphorylation level in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group was only slightly less in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group. PMVECs transduced with shRNA\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS (shACE2 + LPS group) had significantly higher NF\u2013B p65 phosphorylation levels and lower IB expression levels. ACE2 overexpression effectively reduced LPS\u2013induced NF\u2013B p65 phosphorylation levels and reversed IB levels. the IB levels in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group were approximately similar to that of the LPS group, but was significantly increased compared with the A779 + LPS group. the cells were pre\u2013incubated with MAPK signaling pathway specific inhibitors SB203580, PD98059, or SP600125 before LPS stimulation. the apoptosis of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS was not significantly increased by SB203580 or PD98059 pretreatment. the apoptosis levels of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS were significantly higher than that of the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group. 779 + LPS + SB203580 and 84.03% in the A779 + LPS group. pretreatment with specific MAPK signaling inhibitors did not affect LPS\u2013induced cytokine secretion in PMVECs. pretreatment with SP600125 significantly suppressed cytokine secretion. the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group were significantly inhibited by SP600125 pre\u2013incubation. ACE2 + LPS (A), shACE2 + LPS (B), A779 + LPS (C) and ACE2 + A779 + LPS (D) were not affected by SB203580, or PD98059. tosis was 37.60% (P 0.05), but this was significantly lower than that of PMVECs treated with LPS. LPS exposure caused a significant apoptosis in PMVECs but was attenuated by ACE2 overexpression and aggravated by ACE2 downregulation. LPS\u2013induced IL\u20131 and TNF\u2013 secretions were significantly inhibited by ACE2 overexpression, but further promoted by ACE2 knockdown. there was no significant difference between ACE2 + A779 + LPS and LPS\u2013treated cells in the levels of cytokines. effects of ACE2 and Mas\u2013receptor antagonist A779 on AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137) secretion in PMVECs. Ang\u2013(1\u20137) levels were significantly higher in PMVECs infected with LV\u2013Ace2 receiving LPS (ACE2 + LPS group; 27.29 3.97 ng/mL). the increase of AngII was markedly attenuated by ACE2 overexpression. the upregulation of Ang\u2013(1\u20137) was further increased by ACE2 overexpression. but Ang\u2013(1\u20137) level was not affected by A779 pretreatment. ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (16.23 5.17 ng/mL) were only slightly higher (P > 0.05; Fig. 3B, 3D) effects of ACE2 and Mas\u2013receptor antagonist A779 on the ACE2/ACE ratio in PMVECs Relative to the normal PMVECs in PBS (control group) ACE2/ACE ratio was significantly lower in the A779 + LPS group compared to the control group. ACE2/actin and ACE/actin levels of the normal cells treated with LV\u2013Ace2 were significantly higher compared to the control group. ACE2/actin was significantly higher in the A779 + ACE2 + LPS group. ACE2 overexpression effectively reduced LPS\u2013induced p38 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation levels. downregulation of ACE2 in LPS\u2013exposed cells obviously enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, but failed to change p38 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. 779 + LPS group were markedly lower (P 0.05), there was no obvious difference in these levels between the ACE2 + A779 + LPS and LPS groups. phosphorylation level in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group was only slightly less in the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group (P > 0.05), but significantly higher than that of the LPS group. ACE2 overexpression effectively reduced LPS\u2013induced NF\u2013B p65 phosphorylation levels and reversed IB levels. downregulation of ACE2 in LPS\u2013exposed cells obviously enhanced NF\u2013B p65 phosphorylation levels. effects of MAPKs specific inhibitors on LPS\u2013induced apoptosis in PMVECs. cells were pre\u2013incubated with MAPK signaling pathway specific inhibitors SB203580, PD98059, or SP600125 before LPS stimulation. only pretreatment with SP600125 significantly inhibited LPS\u2013induced apoptosis in normal, ACE2 transduced PMVECs. apoptosis of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS was not significantly increased by SB203580 or PD98059 pretreatment. the apoptosis levels of cells infected with LV\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS were significantly higher than that of the ACE2 + A779 + LPS group. pretreatment with specific MAPK signaling inhibitors did not affect LPS\u2013induced cytokine secretion in PMVECs. pretreatment with SP600125 in the PMVECs transduced with shRNA\u2013Ace2 and stimulated with LPS significantly suppressed cytokine secretion. ACE2 + LPS (A), shACE2 + LPS (B), A779 + LPS (C) and ACE2 + A779 + LPS (D) groups. pretreatment with A779 significantly increased, but SB203580 and PD98059 slightly reduced. SP600125 significantly attenuated, IL\u20131 and TNF\u2013 secretions. ACE2 acts as a counter-regulator of ACE in regulating production of AngII and Ang\u2013(1\u20137)33. ACE2 treatment protected mouse lungs from severe acute injury13. ACE2 expression in lung tissue was downregulated in a mouse ARDS model. many reports suggest that AngII exerts pro\u2013inflammatory effects by inducing the release of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species through the AT1 receptor. Ang\u2013(1\u20137) binds to the specific G\u2013protein\u2013coupled receptor Mas to counteract AngII function (i.e., vasodilatory, anti\u2013growth, and anti\u2013proliferative effects) ACE2 overexpression significantly blocked LPS\u2013induced activation of the p38 and JNK pathways, which was strikingly prevented by administration of the Mas receptor blocker. this suggests that ACE2 is protective against LPS\u2013induced apoptosis of PMVECs and inflammation, perhaps through the Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas pathway. ACE2/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas may have a protective effect on LPS\u2013induced apoptosis and inflammation in PMVECs, mainly through inhibition of the JNK pathway. ACE2 overexpression significantly inhibited LPS\u2013induced activation of the NF\u2013B and degradation of IB protein, which was strikingly reversed by the Mas receptor antagonist. NF\u2013B cascade is pivotal to the intracellular signaling pathway involved in apoptosis and the inflammatory response. activation of NF\u2013B is central to the regulation of pulmonary inflammation. inhibition of ERK or p38 protects against LPS\u2013induced lung injury. apoptosis by administration of Ang\u2013(1\u20137) in ACE2\u2013deleted PMVECs exposed to LPS in vivo should be addressed. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
