{"summary": "the biosensor was designed based on the crystal structures of the cellular 2-5A receptor RNase L (22, 24). the N-terminal ANK domain of RNase L is sufficient for 2-5A sensing. in a single ANK protomer, the N and C termini in cis are separated, but on dimerization of two ANK domains, the N and C termini become positioned in trans next to each other. fluc modified the overlapping split junction N416/C415 with a nonoverlapping junction. the sensor was encoded as one polypeptide, which simplified its use compared with usual two-protein split systems. we optimized the reporter by engineering the linker regions. Y312A mutant served as a control. data are mean SE pooled from at least three independent experiments. NS, nonsignificant; *P 0.05; **P 0.01; ***P 0.001; ****P 0.0001. the difference between expression of V6 and expression of Y312A was not significant. the difference between expression of V6 and expression of Y312A was not significant. the biosensor exhibited a robust response to poly-IC in OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells. in contrast, the response was lost in OAS3-KO cells. it has been proposed that RNase L may be activated by local production of 2-5A (30) at discrete sites inside cells. the pathways of 2-5A and IFNs are closely interconnected. 2-5A stimulates 2-5A production by transcriptionally inducing the OASs. 2-5A can amplify (36) and suppress (37) IFN- protein production. qRT-PCR analysis of ISG expression in A549 cells after poly-IC treatment vs. untreated controls. data are mean SE from three biological replicates. Western blot and autoradiography analysis of nascent protein synthesis in A549 cells labeled with puromycin or 35S metabolic labeling after treatment with poly-IC for the indicated times. nascent protein synthesis in WT and RNase L knockout (RNL-KO) A549 cells after treatment with poly-IC for the indicated times. translation before ISG induction was also present in HeLa cells. translational arrest ahead of ISG induction was also present in HeLa cells. Puromycin Western blot (Upper) and RNA nano-ChIP (Lower) analysis of translation and 28S rRNA cleavage in poly-IC\u2013treated (1 g/mL) A549 cells. qRT-PCR analysis of ISG expression in WT and RNL-KO A549 cells treated with conditioned media from poly-IC\u2013treated (1 g/mL) A549 cells. anisomycin was added to arrest all protein synthesis, and the cells were kept for another 3 h. anisomycin treatment was continued to keep the cells translationally arrested. anisomycin was compatible with IFN sensing by nave cells. type I and type III IFNs are synthesized by translation-arrested cells. poly-A+ RNA-seq profile analysis of IFN mRNA expression in A549 cells treated with poly-IC (1 g/mL for 9 h) data were mapped to hg19 assembly and plotted. in a single ANK protomer, the N and C termini in cis are separated. but on dimerization of two ANK domains, the N and C termini become positioned in trans next to each other. on 2-5A binding, the head-to-tail configuration of the ANK domains brings the N and C termini in proximity. range of 2-5A and V6 concentrations from 10 nM to at least 1 M for V6 and 3 M for 2-5A. control mutation Y312A removed key 2-5A\u2013sensing tyrosine (24). reporter V6 had sufficient sensitivity to detect low amounts of 2-5A. the poly-IC treatment conditions were selected to produce cleavage of 28S rRNA. 28S rRNA cleavage was noticeable after 1 h of poly-IC treatment. the luminescence increase began at approximately 30 min of poly-IC treatment. expression of Y312A was not significant. similar expression was also demonstrated by basal luminescence (P = 0.16) the availability of live cell 2-5A sensor provides an opportunity to evaluate 2-5A accumulation in individual cellular compartments in situ. to this end, we engineered tagged versions of V6 with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) both variants localized to the expected sites. 2-5A synthesis was readily observed over a range of poly-IC concentrations. transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) measured by qPCR of OAS1/2/3/L developed with a lag of 2\u20134 h. data are mean SE from three biological replicates. the 4 h time point with 1 g/mL poly-IC had two replicates. several measurements use four replicates. basal OASs are sufficient and solely responsible for protecting mouse myeloid cells from murine coronavirus (39). basal OASs appear to be sufficient for 2-5A production, providing a mechanistic explanation for the 2-5A source ahead of the IFN response. IFN- and - Escape the Translational Shutoff Caused by 2-5A. 2-5A rapidly stops basal protein synthesis. media showed antiviral activity and ability to induce ISGs. qRT-PCR analysis of ISG expression in WT and RNL-KO A549 cells treated with conditioned media from poly-IC\u2013treated (1 g/mL) A549 cells (Lower) data are mean SE pooled from three biological replicates. anisomycin was compatible with IFN sensing by nave cells. a control experiment showed that anisomycin had a mild stimulatory effect on ISG mRNAs due to an unknown mechanism. this effect acted in the opposite direction of blocking IFNs. western blot analysis of pSTAT1 levels in CHO reporter cells for type I IFN (Upper) and type III IFN (Lower) reporter cells were treated with conditioned media from A549 cells incubated with 1 g/mL poly-IC and anisomycin. mammalian translation is the mechanistic target of a number of clinically important compounds, including rapalogs and INK128-based inhibitors of the kinase mTOR (45). we expect that the 2-5A biosensor can be adapted to aid the discovery of such RNase L modulators. the 5\u2032-UTRs of the IFNs are small (50\u2013100 nt) and have few uORFs and m6A motifs. most likely, IFNs evade the action of RNase L by a mechanism that does not rely on uORFs and m6A elements. mechanisms based on regulation of the ribosomal activity are also unlikely. RNase L is poised to sense dsRNA located at remote sites in the cytosol and in the nucleus. a similar polysomal disaggregation is observed in the ISR (51) and during inhibition of the 5\u2032-cap complex assembly by blockers of the kinase mTOR (52). IFNs evade the action of RNase L by a mechanism that does not rely on uORFs and m6A elements. these considerations limit the scope of possible mechanisms and suggest that selective IFN translation may result from transcriptional induction of their mRNAs. the reporter protein was designed by fusing two halves of Fluc encoding amino acids 1\u2013416 (N-Fluc) and 417\u2013550 (C-Fluc) to the N and C termini. for cell work, an N-terminal FLAG tag was added."}
