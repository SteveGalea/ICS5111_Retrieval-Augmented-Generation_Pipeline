{"summary": "the study identified 8 case-patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection in the united states. the median age of case-patients was 43 years (range 22\u201353 years); 4 were women. three (38%) patients visited a healthcare facility during their travel in the 10 days before illness onset. 4 patients stayed at a hotel associated with a well-defined SARS cluster (7). findings suggestive of a lower respiratory tract infection developed in all 8 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS. 0 (0) Cough 8 (100) 2 (25) Sputum production 4 (50) 0 (0) Dyspnea 8 (100) 1 (13) Rales 5 (63) 0 (0) Diarrhea 6 (75) 0 (0) *SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus; NA, not available. the first abnormal chest radiograph was obtained a median of 7 days after onset of symptoms. six patients had an abnormal chest radiograph when first evaluated. three patients also received oseltamivir; none was treated with ribavirin. patients were significantly more likely than controls to have visited a healthcare facility during their travel. dyspnea, hypoxia, rales, vomiting, and diarrhea were more common among SARS-CoV\u2013positive patients than SARS-CoV\u2013negative controls. case-patients were also significantly more likely to report fever as an initial symptom (8/8 versus 29/65; p 0.01) and to have an abnormal chest radiograph at the time of first evaluation (6/8 versus 12/52; p patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS were more likely than controls to have dyspnea, hypoxia, and rales. patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS were more likely to manifest dyspnea and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. gastrointestinal symptoms, dyspnea, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates may warrant a higher level of suspicion for SARS-CoV infection. patients with findings of only upper respiratory tract infection may be unlikely to have SARS. small number of persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS in the united states limited our power to identify independent clinical predictors of SARS-CoV infection."}
