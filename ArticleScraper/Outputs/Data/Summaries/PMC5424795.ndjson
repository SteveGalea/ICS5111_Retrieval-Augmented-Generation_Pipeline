CNGA1 is known to be indispensable for channel activation, while CNGB1a plays mostly regulatory structural roles. a mouse knockout of CNGB1 and GARP2 caused structural alterations and slowly progressive retinal degeneration. CNGB1 splice variant possesses 141 glutamic acids. native GARP1 and GARP2 purified from bovine rod photoreceptors were shown to be typical IDPs. the life cycle of the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb causing wilt disease in a wide range of crops includes three vegetative phases. one of the genes tagged in a pathogenicity encoded a glutamic acid-rich protein (VdGARP1), which shared no significant similarity to any known proteins. KIBRA is a large (1,113 residues) protein that serves as a potential regulator of the Hippo/SWH signaling pathway that restricts proliferation and promotes apoptosis. KIBRA has 111 glutamic acids and possesses two N-terminal WW domains, an internal C2-like domain and a Glu-rich stretch. the majority of glutamates are located within the C-terminal Glu-rich region (residues 170\u2013239), 43% of which are glutamate residues. other members of the SH3BGR family were found in humans. the N-terminal half of the protein is responsible for the protease activity. the highly charged C-terminal part of the protein was not required for this activity. there are 111 glutamic acids and 108 lysines in ABRA. pGZr is a 230 amino-acids long glycine, glutamine, and glutamic acid-rich repeat (GZ) repeat protein that is encoded by a large nested open reading frame located in the EBNA1 mRNA. pI 3.81) contains 237 glutamic acids, 179 glutamines, 114 prolines and 90 aspartic acids. in the Epstein\u2013Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus the repeat domains were shown to enhance the stability of EBNA1 and LANA1. the EG-EA repeat has no effect on the stability of HVS ORF73 or its rate of translation. the motif EEAEEAEEE of HVS ORF73 was sufficient to cause a reduction in recognition of ORF73 by CD8+ CTL. 107 residue-long protein contains 56 glutamic acids, 30 alanines, 24 valines, 20 prolines, 18 serines and 15 lysines. this protein contains 56 glutamic acids, 30 alanines, 24 valines, 20 prolines, 18 serines and 15 lysines. it has been concluded that the glutamic acid-rich protein was one of the proteins upregulated after harvesting. the N-terminal Cp190 fragment containing the BTB/POZ domain and the D-rich region was shown to be involved in regulation of the Cp190 interaction with insulator complexes. the 131 glutamic acids are not equally distributed within the protein, with the N-terminal half containing just 26 glutamic acids and the remaining 105 glutamates being concentrated within the C-terminal half of Cp190. the lack of ability of the full length Pcp4l1 to interact with calmodulin was ascribed to its nine-residue glutamic acid-rich sequence that lies outside the IQ motif in Pcp4l1. a single point mutation at the 69th position of the human leukocyte antigen DP 1 chain (HLA-DPB1), where lysine is substituted by a glutamic acid, makes the carriers more susceptible to CBD. the disease is caused by a single point mutation in the -globin chain of hemoglobin where the hydrophilic and negatively charged amino acid glutamic acid is replaced by the hydrophobic amino acid valine at the sixth position. the rates of homogeneous nucleation were shown to be enhanced by 1010 when the initial concentration was increased by 50% non-polymerizing hemoglobin. all disease-causing mutations occur in one or more RPGR isoforms containing the C-terminal exon open reading frame 15 (ORF15) 55% occur in a Glu-rich domain within exon ORF15, which accounts for only 31% of the protein. a major player in this pathway is a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor protein. a single point mutation at the 69th position of the human leukocyte antigen DP 1 chain (HLA-DPB1) makes the carriers more susceptible to CBD. the disease is caused by a single point mutation in the -globin chain of hemoglobin where the hydrophilic and negatively charged amino acid glutamic acid is replaced by the hydrophobic amino acid valine. mutations in a Glu-rich domain of RPGR Retinitis pigmentosa account for 15\u201320% of RP cases in Caucasians. RP is caused by mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa gene which accounts for 15\u201320% of RP cases in Caucasians. RP is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene which accounts for 15\u201320% of RP cases. renosum is one of the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. the disease is caused by the alterations in the pathway that links the members of the proline-rich, glutamic acid-rich, serine-rich and threonine-rich (PEST) family of protein tyrosine phosphatases (which are critical regulators of adhesion and migration) to their substrates. overabundance of glutamic acids defines the extended conformation of native coils and native pre-molten globules. it is crucial for function of entropic bristle domains and several chaperones."}
