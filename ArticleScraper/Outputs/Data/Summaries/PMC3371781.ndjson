{"summary": "the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. she had a history of diabetes mellitus. a cardiac murmur had been noted 8 years earlier. BACTEC 9240 system yielded a slow-growing, gram-negative microbe. blood was subcultured onto Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. this microbe was lost after 2 subcultures, and no isolate is available. we describe the seventh reported case of well-documented infectious endocarditis. a Veillonella species was the sole pathogen and the first due to V. montpellierensis. all previously reported cases were due to either V. dispar (9,10), V. parvula (11), or V. alcalescens (6\u20138). Veillonella species isolated Age Sex Infected valve Preexisting valvular disease Echo vegetation Specimen site Duration of illness before diagnosis. the seventh case of endocarditis due to Veillonella spp. identified by PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA gene. the first case of endocarditis due to V. montpellierensis reemphasizes the usefulness of molecular methods."}
