{"summary": "two intertwined and highly branched tubular systems are designed to optimize exposure of blood to oxygen. one conducting air and the other conducting blood must develop in a coordinated way to generate the millions of functional alveolar gas-exchange units. this sequence of events is tightly controlled by the concerted action of growth factors, transcription factors, and mechanical forces. BMP receptors phosphorylate and thus activate their Type-I partners. the receptor-regulated Smad proteins 1, 5 and 8 translocate to the nucleus. they regulate expression of their target genes, synergistically with other transcription factors. the association of mutations in genes encoding for BMPRII and ALK1 with the development of two genetic vascular diseases. the BMP signaling pathway has also been implicated in the regulation of adult lung homeostasis and tissue repair following injury. ectopic expression of gremlin by adenovirus mediated gene transfer in the lung of adult rats

untreated and vehicle (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, D2650) treated lungs were used as controls. 106 cells (106/ml) were cultured in 12-well plates (Nunc, 150628) coated with Bovine collagen (Nutacon, 5409) for 24 hours. cultures were rinsed with MCDB-201 to remove detached cells. colonies of epithelial cells were formed and infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either

was discarded and cells were re-suspended in HBSS++ and counted with a hemocytometer. EpCampos-CD31neg-CD45neg-CD34neg cells were separated into eGFPneg, eGFPlow and eGFPhigh. each of these populations were separated by sorting into eGFPneg, eGFPlow and eGFPhigh. in vitro cultivation of sorted epithelial cells in Matrigel was done as previously described. treatment of the Mlg cells with SB431542 for 24 hours led to substantial increase in FGF10 mRNA synthesis. results and discussion Spatiotemporal pattern of expression of the BRE-eGFP reporter during lung development. eGFP expression was confined to the endothelial cells of the large pulmonary vessels and the developing vascular network in the parenchyma. from E13.5 onwards robust eGFP expression was detected in both proximal and distal epithelial compartments. eGFP expression was detected in cuboidal epithelial cells of the developing saccules. as lung morphogenesis approached completion, the eGFP signal was reduced. in adult mice, few eGFPpos cells were detected scattered in the epithelium of bronchi and large airways. expression of Id2 mRNA did not correlate with levels of eGFP expression. treatment of embryonic lung explants with either BMP- or TGF-receptor inhibitors resulted in either suppression or augmentation of BRE-eGFP transgene expression. values represent mean SEM of seven individually analyzed experiments. groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. nuclei stained with antibodies to eGFP, CD31 and VEGF mRNA expression. values represent mean SEM of six SB431542-treated, seven LDN193189-treated and thirteen vehicle treated explants per group. canonical BMP pathway activity is known to be regulated by cell type-specific Smad-interacting transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors. a safer assessment of canonical BMP pathway should combine analysis of several known BMP target genes and pSmad1/5/8 immuno-stainings when this is technically possible. the majority of eGFPpos cells at E12, E14.5 and E17 were also eGFPpos. at P1, 40% of the CD31pos cells were eGFPpos, from P15 onwards the number of eGFPpos-CD31pos cells declined and in the adult they were undetectable. strong eGFP expression was detected in the developingsub-epithelial SMC layer of the proximal airways from E14.5 to P1. the eGFP expression, which involved only a portion of the sub-epithelial SMCs, was undetectable by P15. it has been proposed that sub-epithelial SMCs originate from a pool of sub-mesothelial, FGF10-expressing, mesenchymal cells. eGFP expression was clearly detected in the SM22apos zone only after embryonic stage E13.5. the findings are consistent with the notion that canonical BMP signalling does not involve primitive SMCs. strong eGFP expression was detected in the trachea and primary bronchi as early as E10\u2013E12.5 [33], consistent with the demonstrated role of BMP signaling in trachea development. a zone of eGFPpos-CC10pos cells appeared to separate the CC10pos epithelial population from the eGFPpos airway regions. postnatal expansion of CC10pos regions in the conducting airways was accompanied by a gradual reduction of the eGFPpos regions. eGFPpos-CGRPpos cells formed 'caps' over clusters of CGRPpos cells. eGFPpos-CC10lowcells formed 'caps' over clusters of CGRPpos cells. eGFPpos-CC10lowcells were separated from the eGFPneg-CC10pos cells. one model suggests that mesenchymal derived FGF10 induces Bmp4 expression by the distal epithelium to limit, in an autocrine manner, Fgf10-mediated bud outgrowth [45], [50] the other model proposes that Bmp4 produced by the distal epithelium acts in an autocrine manner to limit proliferation of distal epithelial buds, and in a paracrine manner. the BRE-eGFP reporter is activated in mesenchyme-free epithelial buds cultured in matrigel. distal endodermal buds and mesenchyme were isolated by micro-dissection. bright field and fluorescence images from same colonies were acquired at time 0 and 8 hours. the bre-eGFP reporter is not active in the distal endoderm. eGFP expression was highly increased in lung parenchyma of the BRE-eGFP mice during the saccular and alveolar stages. eGFP expression was highly increased in lung parenchyma. eGFP staining during pseudoglandular stage was confined to endothelial cells and peri-bronchial smooth muscle cells of the proximal airways. pro-SpCpos epithelial cells in the distal airways were uniformly eGFPneg at this developmental stage. BRE-eGFP transgenic animals stained for eGFP and pro-SpC. eGFPneg-spCpos and eGFPpos-spCpos cells were stained with DAPI. eGFPneg-spCpos and eGFPpos-spCpos cells were stained. canonical BMP signaling in the distal lung epithelium could explain the dramatic distal lung phenotype of animals with disrupted BMP signaling in the distal lung epithelium [15], [16], [18], [19]. the conclusion that canonical BMP signaling becomes crucial for lung epithelial cell development at the cannalicular stage is consistent with earlier genetic studies. BrdUpos cells accounted for 6.7% of the surface airway epithelium in conducting airways. this pattern is compatible with the findings of Giangreco et al. [56] and Rawlins et al. [57]. EGFPneg, eGFPlow and eGFPhigh cells from either EpCAMpos sub-population were isolated using a cell sorter. the purities of the sorted sub-populations were: for Sca1neg: eGFPneg. cells from each indicated sorted sub-population represent mean SEM of eight independent experiments compared with one-way analysis of variance with Bonferoni's post-hoc test. eGFPlow and eGFPhigh cultures were incubated for additional four days. MLg feeder cells in a 3-dimensional Matrigel culture system [38] involved co-culture of the cells in Matrigel for eight days in the presence of the TGF receptor inhibitor SB431542 (10 M) the clonogenic capacity of both Sca1low and Sca1neg cells correlated with the expression levels of the BRE-eGFP reporter with the corresponding eGFPhigh populations exhibiting highest clonogenic capacity. eGFPneg-BrdUpos cells detected in the developing lungs could represent the former type. the randomly distributed eGFPneg-BrdUpos cells could represent the latter type of progenitors. the decline in eGFP expression in the lungs of adult BRE-eGFP transgenics may reflect just that. bleomycin causes epithelial cell death, acute inflammation and fibro-proliferative remodeling of the peripheral lung. naphthalene treatment had caused a large reduction in CC10pos cells in the airways, an increase in the number of CGRPpos cells per NEB. eGFP reporter is reactivated in the airways of BRE-eGFP transgenic animals after injury of their bronchial epithelium by naphthalene eGFPpos-CGRPpos, eGFPpos-CC10low and eGFPpos-CC10low cells remained stable. up to day-2, the increase in eGFPpos airway epithelial cell numbers involved CGRPpos and CGRPneg-CC10lowcells. eGFP and CC10 expression recapitulated pattern observed during early lung development. bleomycin is an anti-cancer drug, which induces lung injury and fibrosis [60]. treatment of adult BRE-eGFP animals by intra-tracheal administration resulted in substantial reactivation of the eGFP reporter in type-II pneumocytes (Pro-SpCpos) confocal images of tissue sections stained for eGFP, SpC and T1lowcells show eGFP expression in bre-eGFP and BRE-lacZ reporters. BRE-eGFP reporter was active already at E11, reached maximum levels around birth, thereafter declining to minimal levels in the adult. eGFP expression was detected in sub-epithelial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) located at the proximal regions of the developing airways. eGFP expression was detected in both proximal and distal compartments. eGFP expression was detected in cuboidal epithelial cells of the developing saccules. as lung morphogenesis approached completion, the eGFP signal was reduced. few eGFPpos cells were detected scattered in the epithelium of bronchi and large airways. expression of Id2 mRNA did not correlate with levels of eGFP expression. treatment of embryonic lung explants with either BMP- or TGF-receptor inhibitors resulted in either suppression or augmentation of BRE-eGFP transgene expression. values represent mean SEM of seven individually analyzed experiments. groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI. values represent mean SEM of six SB431542-treated, seven LDN193189-treated and thirteen vehicle treated explants per group. canonical BMP pathway activity is known to be regulated by cell type-specific Smad-interacting transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors. a safer assessment of canonical BMP pathway should combine analysis of several known BMP target genes and pSmad1/5/8 immuno-stainings when this is technically possible. at P1, 40% of the CD31pos cells were eGFPpos, from P15 onwards the number of eGFPpos-CD31pos cells declined. EGFP expression with similar kinetics was observed in the endothelial cells lining the large blood vessels. strong eGFP expression was detected in the developingsub-epithelial SMC layer of the proximal airways from E14.5 to P1 (Figure 3A and Figure S1 & S2) the eGFP expression, which interestingly involved only a portion of the sub-epithelial SMCs, was undetectable by P15. proximal portion of the SM22apos zone and eGFP expression clearly detected in the SMApos zone only after embryonic stage E13.5. strong eGFP expression was detected in the trachea and primary bronchi as early as E10\u2013E12.5 [33], consistent with the demonstrated role of BMP signaling in developing airway epithelial cells. a zone of eGFPpos-CC10pos cells appeared to separate the CC10pos epithelial population from the eGFPpos airway regions. postnatal expansion of CC10pos regions in the conducting airways was accompanied by a gradual reduction of the eGFPpos regions. eGFPpos-CGRPpos cells were detected close to the tips of airway branch-points in close proximity to neuro-epithelial bodies (NEBs) eGFPpos-CC10lowcells formed \u201ccaps\u201d over clusters of CGRPpos cells. eGFPpos-CC10lowcells formed \u201ccaps\u201d over clusters of CGRPpos cells. mal derived FGF10 induces Bmp4 expression by the distal epithelium. it acts in an autocrine manner to limit proliferation of distal epithelial buds. the other model proposes that Bmp4 produced by the distal epithelium acts in an autocrine manner to limit bud outgrowth. the BRE-eGFP reporter is activated in mesenchyme-free epithelial buds cultured in matrigel. distal endodermal buds and mesenchyme were isolated by micro-dissection. bright field and fluorescence images from same colonies were acquired at time 0 and 8 hours. enchyme on the activation of the canonical BMP pathway reporter illustrates the importance of the crosstalk between epithelial and vascular cells during early lung development. we cannot conclusively rule out for the moment activation of the BRE-eGFP reporter at the tips of the early branching endoderm. eGFP staining during pseudoglandular stage was confined to endothelial cells and peri-bronchial smooth muscle cells of the proximal airways. the cells at this stage of development are thought to be immature type-II pneumocytes. BRE-eGFP transgenic animals stained for eGFP and pro-SpC. eGFPneg-SpCpos and eGFPpos-SpCpos cells were counterstained with DAPI. eGFP reporter is activated in two epithelial domains, namely the proximal airways and the distal developing alveolar sacs. this could explain the dramatic distal lung phenotype of animals with disrupted BMP signaling in the distal lung epithelium [15], [16], [18], [19] 6.7% of the surface airway epithelium were uniformly distributed throughout the airway tree. this pattern is compatible with the findings of Giangreco et al. and Rawlins et al. [57]. eGFPneg, eGFPlow and eGFPhigh cells from either EpCAMpos sub-population were isolated using a cell sorter. the purities of the sorted sub-populations were: for Sca1neg: eGFPneg (gate P7, 90%), eGFPlow (gate P8, 85%), eGFPhigh (gate P9, 90%); for Sca1low: eGFPneg ( ues represent mean SEM of eight independent experiments compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferoni's post-hoc test. the matrigel cultures were incubated for additional four days. Linneg-EpCAMpos-Sca1neg cells cultured in this way gave rise primarily to large cystic epithelial colonies. clonogenic capacity of both Sca1low and Sca1neg cells correlated with expression levels of the BRE-eGFP reporter with the corresponding eGFPhigh populations exhibiting highest clonogenic capacity. previous studies have provided evidence for two types of airway epithelial progenitors. one randomly distributed in the airways that maintain normal epithelial homeostasis and responds to minor injuries of the epithelium. the eGFPpos epithelial cells could represent the latter type of progenitors. eGFP reporter is reactivated in the airways of BRE-eGFP transgenic animals after injury of their bronchial epithelium by naphthalene. naphthalene treatment had caused a large reduction in CC10pos cells in the airways, an increase in the number of CGRPpos cells per NEB and a substantial increase in eGFP reporter activity. naphthalene-induced eGFPpos airway-epithelial cells expressed as average number of cells per mm airway length. values represent mean SEM of 4\u20135 individually analyzed naphthalene-treated animals per group at each time point. eGFPpos-CGRPpos, eGFPpos-CC10low and eGFPpos-CC10low cells showed a gradual increase in the number of eGFPpos bronchial treatment of adult BRE-eGFP animals by intra-tracheal administration of bleomycin resulted in substantial reactivation of the eGFP reporter in type-II pneumocytes (Pro-SpCpos) from day-4 onwards both cuboidal and squamous eGFPpos cells were found in the alveolar regions. the canonical BMP pathway is re-activated during early lung development. it bears resemblance to the activation of this pathway during early lung development. the bre-eGFP reporter is reactivated in mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds. BRE-eGFP expression peaks around birth and returns to very low levels upon completion of lung development. severe depletion of Clara cells in the adult lung by naphthalene treatment leads to re-expression of the eGFP reporter around NEBs and terminal bronchioles, areas known to harbour airway progenitor cells. ral map of canonical BMP signalling during lung development and adult tissue injury repair will facilitate interpretation of earlier genetic studies. ease isolation of living eGFPpos i.e. BMP responding, subpopulations of lung cells by cell sorting will greatly facilitate definitive clarification of the mechanisms of action of this signaling system. confocal images of tissue sections prepared from E11, E12, E13.5 and E14.5 BRE-eGFP transgenic lungs stained for eGFP, SM22a and SMA. the white dashed rectangles in each lane correspond to identical tissue areas. images of tissue sections prepared from the explants described above stained for eGFP (green stain) eGFP expression in the FGF10 and BMP4 treated explants were counterstained with DAPI. note the strong upregulation of eGFP expression in the FGF10 and BMP4 treated explants. confocal images show the transitional zone between the eGFPpos-CC10neg and eGFPneg-CC10pos domains of the airways. the image depicting NEBs is obtained from a section sequential to those depicting CC10 and eGFP expression. the images demonstrate that only a small number of type-I pneumocytes are eGFPpos. the forward and reverse primers are designed with the Beacon Designer v7.01 software."}
