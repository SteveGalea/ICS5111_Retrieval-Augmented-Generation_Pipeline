{"summary": "the geographic scope of the survey was defined as the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all 27 member states of the. European Union (EU) plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. in 2007 and 2009/2010, questionnaires were administered to officials representing these Competent Bodies for Scientific Advice in each member state. level data were pooled to compute summary statistics for the 2007 and 2009/2010 surveys. a two-sample test of equality of proportions was applied to compare the proportions of respondents with positive and negative responses between the two survey rounds. a two-sample test of equality of proportions was applied to capture minor changes between the two surveys. vector-borne diseases 29 25 (86) 29 25 (86) 1 Borreliosis (Lyme disease) 30 25 (83) 28 22 (79) 0.91 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever 27 10 (37) 27 8 (30) 0.56 Chikungunya fever 29 5 (17) 29 15 (52) 0.048 Dengue fever 29 5 (17) 29 11 (38) 0.07 Human granulocytic anaplasmosis \u2014 24 7 (29) \u2014 Leish no data for 2007; the list of pathogens was expanded in 2009/2010. responses were recorded on a Likert scale with five response options. respondents in northern and central Europe thought climate change is likely to affect TBE. respondents in southern Europe expected effects on west Nile fever. experts also reported an increase in geographic distribution and seasonality of several insect-, tick-, and rodent-borne diseases in their countries in the previous decade. 0 21 9/21 12/21 0 16 5/16 11/16 0 17 3/17 14/17 0 Chikungunya fever 12 2/12 10/12 0 11 0 11/11 0 12 1/12 11/12 0 Hantavirus infections 17 8/17 9/17 0 16 3/16 13/16 0 14 1/14 13/14 0 12 2/12 10/12 0 Leishmaniasis. countries of the south reported expansion in the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., west Nile fever; Figure 2A) both local range contraction and range expansion were reported in the case of leishmaniasis in Portugal (Table 2). Approximately three-fourths of country experts believed that food-borne diseases would be affected by climate change in the future. almost one-third (9 of 28) of country experts reported an observable increase of food-borne diseases over the last decade. but few attributed the food-borne disease outbreaks to climate change. only 9 of 27 respondents indicated their countries had completed a national assessment specifically focused on the potential health impacts of climate change. 17/29 (58) are there plans to alter current vector-borne disease surveillance and control programs to address the threats of climate change. this includes changing the frequency or location of monitoring and surveillance programs to detect changes in geographic range or incidence. y-axis represents the EEA countries, which included 27 EU member states plus Norway and Iceland, with exception of Lichtenstein. incomplete data are due to missing information. expert assessment pools informed opinion and can add support for findings it corroborates while reducing support for findings it does not. expert judgment can help policy makers prioritize areas for action and make informed decisions. this is especially important for epidemiology of climate change. experts reported changes in their countries in the seasonality of hantavirus (Figure 1C) leishmaniasis transmitted by sandflies is currently prevalent only in southern Europe, where the experts did not consider it likely to be affected by climate change. experts in northern and eastern Europe considered these diseases likely to be affected by climate change. a total of 23 countries reported one or more water-borne disease outbreaks due to drinking water contamination in the last decade, with 12 reporting five or more outbreaks. survey respondents did not attribute food-borne outbreaks in their countries to climate change, despite evidence of strong correlations between temperature and disease incidence reported in the literature. the ability to adapt depends on a number of factors, such as surveillance information, human resources, available technology, institutional capacity, social equity, and political will. experts can be vulnerable to recall bias, susceptible to institutional or disciplinary biases, shaped by recent disease outbreaks. experts in this study were officially nominated as the point person for climate change in their country (ECDC 2011), as is standard practice for other infectious disease programs within the ECDC. borne diseases where the causal link has a range of potential confounders. national climate change assessments were reported mainly from western Europe. most noticeable was the need to improve current surveillance of infectious diseases."}
