{"summary": "a great number of DNA sequences are now available from web-based databases. the characteristics of these sequences have been extensively studied. many works are devoted to the so-called metagenomic analysis of DNA sequences. many methods relying on a gene's nucleotide or oligonucleotide composition for the detection of HTs are available (22\u201332) a web service has recently been made available for the comparison of tetranucleotide usage patterns in DNA sequences. the current version results from a substantial redesign that developed into the GENSTYLE workspace. three dedicated toolboxes have been implemented for collecting, selecting and processing sequences. the sequence analysis toolbox is made for Identification of the origin of short DNA fragments. the user's workspace can be loaded with sequences of interest. the user's sequences can be selected through the GENSTYLE companion database browser. a tutorial is available online. distances to the sequence of interest are expressed in an arbitrary unit (AU) it can be seen that the sequence belongs to the SARS Virus (d = 11) the closest species are PEDV and PTGV corona viruses."}
