{"summary": "PPV infects and numerously replicates in boar testicle, which results in damage of swine testicle in vivo. PPV infection suppressed Bcl-2 expression, enhanced Bax expression and translocation to mitochondria, decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. further studies showed that PPV infection caused ROS accumulation. inhibition of ROS could reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential and block ST cells apoptosis."}
