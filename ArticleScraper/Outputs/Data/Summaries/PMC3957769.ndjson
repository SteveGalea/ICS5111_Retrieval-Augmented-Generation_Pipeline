{"summary": "JD is a chronic enteric disease affecting cattle, sheep, and goats. it is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. control programs for JD have been implemented in many countries. most assays have been compared to solid medium culture methods with lower sensitivities than that of Bactec liquid culture (8). due to the cryptic nature of the disease, estimates of the true diagnostic sensitivities and specificities for most tests for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis are lacking. the HT-J test eliminated several labor-intensive aspects of DNA purification. it replaced them with a semiautomated procedure in a 96-well plate format. this reduces the time required to perform the test, but it significantly reduces the risk of cross contamination due to manual handling. mycobacteria were reconstituted from lyophilized stock in 0.1 ml sterile water and inoculated into radiometric Bactec 12B culture vials containing PANTA (BD Biosciences) for all M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains, the radiometric culture vials were supplemented with egg yolk and mycobactin J. is 316v (C strain) + 2 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis Telford (S strain) + 3 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST1 4 M. aviumc ST9 5 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST11 6 M. aviumc ST12 7 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST15 8 M. avium subsp. aviumc intracellulare ATCC 14470 27 M. intracellulare ATCC 13950 28 M. kansasii ATCC 12478 29 M. gordonae ATCC 19530 30 M. parafortuitum ATCC 19686 31 M. phlei ATCC 11758 32 M. scrofulaceum ATCC 19981 33 M. terrae ATCC 15755 34 M. thermoresistibile ATCC 19527 35 M. triviale ATCC for fecal spiking experiments, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis organisms were subcultured on modified Middlebrook 7H10 agar slopes. a single-cell suspension was prepared by vortexing for 5 min and then passing the suspension through a 26-G needle and filtering through a sterile 8-m filter. the integrity of the filter was checked before proceeding. qPCR to detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in fecal samples were performed as previously described (18, 19). fecal samples were collected from animals, put in labeled ster. a single fecal sample was tested from each of 1,330 beef cattle. the herds were selected opportunistically, and convenience samples were collected and tested between 6 January 2010 and 11 November 2011. the majority were extensively grazed cattle. all herds except one in Tasmania had a low prevalence of infection. samples from unexposed herds were obtained from farms in regions of Australia where JD was not known to be present at the time of the study. the number of farms represented is uncertain. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-exposed (507 samples from 15 flocks) and -unexposed flocks (89 samples from 1 flock) the flocks were selected opportunistically, and convenience samples were collected or retrieved from archives and tested between 27 October 2010 and 11 November 2011. sheep have consistently yielded negative results (with fecal culture and serological methods) in tests for JD over 10 years. fecal DNA extraction was termed the HT-J test. the top 3 to 5 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube containing 10 ml 0.85% (wt/vol) sterile saline. the tube was shaken vigorously to mix the suspension thoroughly and then allowed to settle for 30 min. the supernatant was discarded without dislodging the pellet, and 600 l of modified lysis/binding solution was added. magnetic bead DNA purification was undertaken using a kit (BioSprint 96 one-for-all vet kit; Qiagen) the fecal supernatant in lysis/binding solution (400 l) was transferred to the lysate plate along with 40 l proteinase K and 300 l magnetic bead mix. three additional deep 96-well plates and one standard 96-well plate were labeled and prepared. optimization of the primer concentration in the range of 100 to 600 nM was performed. a 5-step standard curve of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic DNA was included in every qPCR experiment (10-fold serial dilutions over the range of 10 to 0.001 pg/reaction) the limit of detection (LOD) was determined from the standard curves obtained from 12 experiments. results derived from 12 standard curves of duplicate reactions (n = 24 data points/concentration) with template concentrations from 0.0005 pg to 10 pg of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) genomic DNA/reaction. the acceptable Tm range was determined using data from all controls and all samples. negative fecal controls gave negative results in both replicates of the DNA extract. positive fecal controls gave positive results in both replicates, and IS900 qPCR data were accepted. a fecal sample was classified as HT-J test positive using a range of criteria for consideration of the qPCR data from replicate DNA extracts performed for each fecal sample. the exact binomial confidence limits were calculated (Minitab Statistical Software) McNemar's test for paired observations was used for comparison of the fecal culture method and the HT-J method (28). mycobacteria were reconstituted from lyophilized stock in 0.1 ml sterile water and inoculated into radiometric Bactec 12B culture vials containing PANTA. the radiometric culture vials were supplemented with egg yolk (obtained aseptically from fresh commercial eggs sold for human consumption) DNA from mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis strains was a kind gift from the National Institute of Animal Health, Japan. Purified genomic DNA was quantified using spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 1000; Thermo Scientific), diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/l in nuclease-free water. avium subsp. aviumc ST28 15 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST29 16 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST31 17 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST38 18 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST54 20 M. avium subsp. aviumc ST62 23 M. avium subsp. avium TMC715 24 M. sp.f AM1 IS900-likeg 44 Mycobacterium sp.f AM3 IS900-likeg 46 Mycobacterium sp.f AM5 IS900-likeg 47 Mycobacterium sp.f IWGMT90236 IS900-likeg 48 Mycobacterium sp.h JD00/266 IS900-likeg 50 M. scrofulaceum-likeh Vic-1 IS900-likeg 51 M. scroful the integrity of the filter was checked before proceeding. a 1:100 dilution of the suspension was examined. the 26-G needle aspiration and filter steps were repeated until a single-cell suspension was achieved. fecal samples were tested from calves (12 months of age) experimentally inoculated with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. the samples were stored at 4\u00b0C prior to and during transit to the laboratory, avoiding unnecessary delays in transit. a single fecal sample was tested from each of 1,330 beef cattle. it represented 15 exposed herds (n = 870 cattle) and at least 8 unexposed herds (n = 460 cattle) the majority were extensively grazed cattle. a total of 596 fecal samples were obtained from extensively grazed mixed-sex predominantly adult Merino sheep representing both M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-exposed (507 samples from 15 flocks) and -unexposed flocks. the flocks were selected opportunistically, and convenience samples were collected or retrieved from archives. an annual lamb vaccination program began in 2002 using the Gudair vaccine (Zoetis Australia) sheep in all age classes on each of the 12 properties had been vaccinated, with a drop in the prevalence of fecal shedders recorded compared to prevaccination prevalence (25). fecal samples from sheep were tested from trials performed at the university of Sydney. the fecal suspension was prepared by adding 1.2 g (dry weight) or 1.5 g (moist weight) of feces to a 15-ml sterile culture tube containing 10 ml 0.85% (wt/vol) sterile saline. the tube was shaken vigorously to mix the suspension thoroughly and then allowed to settle for 30 min, with a gentle flick after 5 min. the pellet was resuspended by repeated aspiration using a sterile plastic transfer pipette. the full volume was transferred to a 2-ml conical-base screw-cap tube containing 0.3 g of zirconia/silica beads. the bead tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 3 min, the supernatant (600 l) was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube. qPCR for IS900 was performed using an automated magnetic particle processor (MagMAX Express-96; Life Technologies) the contents of the individual wells of the elution plate were stored in 200-l tubes at 4\u00b0C if qPCR was to be performed within 24 h. the reaction mixtures each contained 5 l template DNA, forward and reverse primers (250 nM final concentration) threshold was set in each run based on the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic DNA standard curve using the qPCR analysis software (MxPro; Stratagene) the raw data were presented as the DNA quantities derived from the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic DNA standard curve to obtain normalization of the data between runs as distinct from quantification (15). paratuberculosis-specific IS900 sample results had a mean Tm of 89.1\u00b0C. the primer-dimer artifact was seen in the no-template controls (NTC) and samples with no specific template, and it was not competitive with the specific product. amplification efficiency of the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic DNA standard curve was between 90 and 110%. repeatedability was assessed using a paired t test on DNA quantities of all individual qPCRs from two replicate HT-J experiments. the 95% upper and lower limits of agreement for these were calculated from the difference in the log10 DNA quantity between the results for sample replicates. samples with one positive replicate and one negative replicate were classified as negative 83.8 98.9 60.4 99.6 2 DNA extracts tested in duplicate. samples with one positive replicate and one negative replicate were classified as negative 85.6 97.8 63.1 97.6 3 DNA extracts tested in single wells 84.7\u201385.7 97.8\u201398.9 61.3\u201362.2 98.5\u201398.7 4 DNA extracts tested in duplicate. average DNA quantity of the replicates used to determine result fecal samples were known to contain low levels of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. they were stored as aliquots at 20\u00b0C or 80\u00b0C. DNA quantity detected by qPCR was greater for samples stored at 80\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C. the qPCR primer concentration was optimized. primer-dimer artifact was seen particularly in samples with no template. an experiment was conducted to confirm that the 96-well plate-based magnetic particle DNA purification method was robust and not subject to cross-contamination. the genomic DNA was isolated, quantified, and 10 ng was added to each qPCR. only the S and C strain M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates gave a positive result, with CT values of 19.0 1.5. the HT-J test was able to detect as few as 10 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis organisms per gram of feces. the results were reproducible in a replicate experiment. a plot of the variability in DNA quantity for the two independent HT-J tests showed that the majority of the replicate HT-J tests had DNA quantities within 1 log10 of each other. the results for replicate HT-J assays on 34 individual fecal samples. samples 1 and 8 had a DNA quantity detectable in only 1 or 2 of the 8 replicate qPCRs. for such samples, subsampling the same DNA extract will often lead to inconsistent detection of target DNA for stoichiometric reasons (15). a total of 1,330 bovine fecal samples and 596 ovine fecal samples were tested. sensitivity and specificity values for the HT-J assay relative to culture were dependent on the cut point imposed on the data. fecal samples collected from populations that were not exposed to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis were culture positive. 98.9% from sheep were negative in the HT-J test. results suggest both tests are highly specific. fecal samples from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-unexposed herds/flocks HT-J test result by sample type No. of Bactec culture results Relative specificity (% [95% CI]) positive 0 2 2 Negative 0 458 458 Total 0 460 460 Sheep samples 98.9 (93.90\u201399.97) Positive 0 1 1 Negative 0 88 88 the likelihood of obtaining a positive HT-J test result was correlated with the number of live M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells per gram of fecesa. both of the HT-J-positive results in the unexposed cohort had low levels of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic DNA. all exposed cattle herds that returned at least one culture-positive result were identified as positive by the HT-J test. culture-positive samples were identified in 13 sheep flocks, all of which were identified as positive by the HT-J test. the majority of HT-J-positive results were in the low to medium DNA quantity ranges. a trial was conducted using cattle fecal samples known to contain low levels of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. these were extracted with different method variants to evaluate suspensions of 0.3 g feces in 1 ml saline or 1.5 g feces in 10 ml saline. feces in 10 ml saline and a ratio of 1:3 for suspension in lysis buffer. the cut point for the determination of a positive result is shown as a horizontal line at 103 pg. ND, not detectable (no CT). the controls included in the HT-J extraction method were a process control, a positive fecal control, a negative fecal control, and a buffer control on the 96-well extraction plate incomplete sequence alignments were identified for both forward and reverse primers in mycobacterium intracellulare. a panel of 51 mycobacterial isolates, including environmental and pathogenic strains, were tested using the IS900 qPCR assay. only the S and C strain M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis isolates gave a positive result. the range of detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was assessed using fecal samples spiked with known quantities of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells. both the C and S strains of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis were included in this experiment. a total of 34 exposed cattle (n = 15) and sheep (n = 19) samples were analyzed in two replicate experiments. a paired t test of DNA quantities from all replicates indicated the results were not significantly different. the results were identical for all 15 cattle samples and 18/19 sheep samples. a DNA extract was prepared from each sample and tested in quadruplicate in two separate qPCR experiments. samples 1 and 8 had a DNA quantity detectable in only 1 or 2 of the 8 replicate qPCRs. a total of 1,330 bovine fecal samples and 596 ovine fecal samples were tested. the samples included animals across a spectrum of disease from uninfected to early subclinical and clinical disease. a result was classified as positive only when both replicate qPCRs were within the correct Tm range (89.1 1.5\u00b0C; Fig. 1C) and had a DNA quantity of 0.001 pg. of the fecal samples that were culture positive, 99.6% from cattle and 98.9% from sheep were negative in the HT-J test. the rates of detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in feces for the HT-J and Bactec culture tests were not significantly different (P > 0.05). results of the HT-J test relative to liquid radiometric (Bactec) culture for bovine and ovine fecal samples from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-unexposed herds/flocks HT-J test result the likelihood of a sample being culture positive was strongly related to the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis DNA quantity detected in the sample. 25% of samples with a low quantity of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis DNA quantity were culture positive, while 25% of samples with a low quantity of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis DNA quantity were culture positive. HT-J and culture results for samples from three cattle farms with different disease prevalence: high prevalence (A), medium prevalence (B), and unexposed (C) to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. sample numbers (animal no.) are shown along the x axis. the HT-J test enables rapid reporting of results with a similar rate of detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-positive samples as that of fecal culture in liquid medium. the first was related to the handing of the fecal samples and identified storage at 80\u00b0C rather than 20\u00b0C was required for greatest sensitivity. magnetic bead DNA purification methods generally lead to lower carryover of contaminants or potential PCR inhibitors from a sample. critical components for the qPCR assay were identified by Kawaji et al. (14) as primer sequence and high annealing temperature (68\u00b0C) qPCR assay was modified to use a relatively inexpensive mastermix. the qPCR test based on the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic DNA standard curve was comparable to that reported by Kawaji et al. (14), as was the analytical sensitivity of the HT-J test for the detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in spiked fecal samples. alternative criteria, including those that consider test results with a single positive replicate to be positive, were adopted. m was specified as a range and needed to be determined for other mastermixes and qPCR machine platforms. the selection of the 0.001-pg cut point was determined using a rigorous epidemiological approach, based on the probability of misclassification of the disease status while prioritizing high specificity. this DNA quantity is equivalent to approximately one-fifth of a M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genome; however, the target gene (IS900) this is reflected by the range of culture incubation times to peak growth index (GI) in radiometric culture (3 to 12 weeks), for which the number of weeks to peak GI is inversely proportional to the number of viable M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in the sample (20). however, we acknowledge that the samples evaluated in this study are not truly representative of paratuberculosis prevalence. p. paratuberculosis (so-called heavy or super shedders) are likely to be detected by most protocols for direct fecal PCR (42) and a range of other antemortem tests (43). however, it is epidemiologically and diagnostically important to be able to detect very low numbers of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. most infected animals in a flock/herd are subclinical cases (12) avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection is capable of detecting all infected cattle or sheep due to the epidemiology and pathogenesis of JD (12) the HT-J test detects a set of animals that may overlap but is not equivalent to those detected by fecal culture."}
