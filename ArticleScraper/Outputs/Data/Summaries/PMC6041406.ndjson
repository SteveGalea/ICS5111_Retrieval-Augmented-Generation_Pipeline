{"summary": "in dogs, cerebellar infarcts are uncommonly reported and associated with vestibular signs. common clinical signs of PICA infarcts are vestibular (balance loss, vertigo, and nystagmus) (3). an MRI study of the brain was performed 24 h after the onset of neurological signs. a single, sharply-demarcated focal cerebellar lesion was identified in the caudal third of the right cerebellar hemisphere and lateral medulla oblongata. arrowheads highlight the lesion, which has restricted diffusion (hyperintensity) on the DWI and a reduced ADC (hypointensity), typical of an acute infarct. the cat was hospitalized for monitoring and supportive care. brain MRI showed a focal well-defined hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted and T2 FLAIR sequences in the caudal left cerebellar hemisphere. a thin rim of contrast enhancement was seen around the margin of a cerebellar folium. MRI images show a focal well-defined hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted (A) and T2 FLAIR sequences (B) caudally in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Molecular diffusion is restricted on DWI images (C) and corresponding ADC map (D) RT-PCR for infectious diseases (Toxoplasma gondii, feline coronavirus and feline herpesvirus) in CSF was negative. the cat's neurological status progressively improved over 4 days. at 1 month follow-up no neurological signs were observed. a single, sharply-demarcated focal cerebellar lesion was identified in the caudal third of the right cerebellar hemisphere and lateral medulla oblongata. a single, sharply-demarcated focal cerebellar lesion was identified in the caudal third of the right cerebellar hemisphere and lateral medulla oblongata. the lesion is wedge-shaped, hyperintense and confined to the right cerebellum. arrowheads highlight the lesion, which has restricted diffusion (hyperintensity) on the DWI and a reduced ADC (hypointensity), typical of an acute infarct. toxoplasma gondii serology in blood (IgM and IgG) was negative. brain MRI showed a focal well-defined hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted (A) and T2 FLAIR sequences (B) caudally in the caudal left cerebellar hemisphere. Molecular diffusion is restricted on DWI images (C) and corresponding ADC map (D). an 8-year-old male neutered Persian cat was presented for neurological evaluation of acute onset vestibular ataxia and abnormal mentation. physical examination revealed a grade II/VI systolic heart murmur but otherwise unremarkable. a poorly defined area of homogeneously increased T2 signal intensity (arrowheads) compared to normal cerebellar gray matter is affecting the caudal aspects of the cerebellar vermis and right cerebellar hemisphere. no neurological signs were observed and therapy was discontinued. MRI findings in this case series corresponded to neurological localization and were typical of previously reported acute non-hemorrhagic infarcts. focal wedge-shaped T1-weighted isointense, T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintense lesion (11) MRI techniques provide additional diagnostic support in distinguishing between acute and historic lesions. in both reported cases of feline RCA infarction, concurrent predisposing disease (pulmonary adenocarcinoma and cardiac disease) was present. complete screening for concurrent disease in the present cases was declined in two cases. no abnormalities were detected on cardiac auscultation in these two cases."}
