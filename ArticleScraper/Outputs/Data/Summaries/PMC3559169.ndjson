{"summary": "local infectious disease events have the potential to develop rapidly into international public health emergencies. rapid detection and analysis of and timely response to infectious diseases worldwide are crucial for the prevention and global spread of infectious diseases. the current system involves point-of-care laboratories that often do not have supplies or the capacity needed for diagnosis. global access to a single genomics technology or other cross-compatible technologies will provide diagnostic laboratories at the point-of-care with a standard approach to diagnosis. using whole genome sequence information for clinical diagnosis and surveillance, linked with clinical and epidemiologic information, would create a common, universal and sustained database. software development must become more rapid and permit point-of-care professionals to rapidly evaluate data and interpret results. the cost of whole genome sequencing technologies is dropping precipitously, and the most immediate bottlenecks result from a lack of tools critical for Internet-based data analysis. a single technology applicable to different disciplines (e.g., bacteriology, virology, parasitology) and domains (human, food, animal, environment) would facilitate global cross-cutting collaboration and information exchange. such a global system would provide information across the multitude of microbial variants, and provided appropriate clinical and epidemiologic information is collected. a fundamental shift in the current paradigm of infectious disease detection would result in more cost-effective diagnosis and surveillance. several online and free-to-use tools are under development (17\u201319), and more will surely follow. standards should be developed by scientists, health worker, and relevant agencies. a group addressing the need for global data-sharing for rapid response to public health emergencies recently analyzed some of these potential obstacles. the key to success in translating recent developments in sequencing technology into efficient clinical and public health practice is to capture needs and expectations from all involved stakeholders. by linking their needs to those for national, regional, and global public health, a coordinated technology shift would be possible. in developing countries, current diagnostic methods involve a wide variety of methods. whole genome sequencing could become a simple one-fits-all tool. increased global collaboration and information exchange will enable rapid and coordinated response to novel and known health threats."}
