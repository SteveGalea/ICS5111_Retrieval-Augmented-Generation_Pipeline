{"summary": "RNAs can easily become trapped in thermodynamically stable intermediates that are misfolded and inactive. it is believed that RNA remodeling proteins play pivotal roles in nearly all processes involving RNA molecules. RNA chaperones do not require ATP binding or hydrolysis for their remodeling activities. viral RNAs (vRNAs) contain multiple cis-acting elements that play pivotal roles in vRNA replication and translation. they require RNA helicases or chaperones to aid in proper folding and re-folding. vRNA templates can be efficiently re-utilized to synthesize more progeny vRNA strands. enterovirus 2CATPase encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into separate structural and nonstructural proteins. the multifunctional protein 2CATPase is the most conserved and complex but the least understood. this protein appears to associate with vRNA in the vRNA replication complexes in infected cells. EV71 2CATPase is similar to other viral SF3 helicases in both motifs and structures. the structure of EV71 2CATPase was predicted using the HMMSTR/Rosetta server. eukaryotically expressed EV71 2CATPase functions as an RNA helicase that unwinds RNA helices from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 in an ATP-dependent manner. helix unwinding activity was detected via gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9200 imager. helix unwinding activity was detected via gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9200 imager. enterovirus 2CATPase is similar to other viral SF3 helicases in both conserved motifs and structures. EV71 2CATPase contains a core helicase region and the conserved SF3 signature A, B, and C motifs, similar to the other SF3 helicases. structural alignment of EV71 2CATPase and AAV2 Rep40 shows that the predicted HC domain of 2CATPase is structurally similar with the counterpart region of Rep40. the predicted ATP binding site of 2CATPase is also exposed to the exterior and perfectly overlapped with the structurally determined ATP binding site of Rep40. andem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. in total, four proteins (MBP-2CATPase, -tubulin, actin and cytochrome P450) were identified with FDR value of 0.97%. majority (97.8%) of all the spectra obtained in the purified protein sample were originated from MBP-2CATPase. EV71 2CATPase, a short hexachloro fluorescein (HEX)-labeled RNA and a long non-labeled RNA were annealed to generate a standard RNA helix substrate with both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 single-stranded protrusions. the helix unwinding assay was conducted by incubating the RNA helix substrate with purified MBP-2CATPase, followed helix unwinding activity detected via gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9200 imager. Lane 1, reaction mixture without 2CATPase; lane 2, boiled reaction mixture without 2CATPase; lane 3, complete reaction mixture with MBP alone; lane 5, complete reaction mixture with MBP-fusion EV71 2CATPase; lane 6, complete reaction mixture with MBP-fusion HCV NS3. EV71 2CATPase directs both 5\u20323\u2032 and 3\u20325\u2032 unwinding of RNA helices. each substrate was then incubated with 2CATPase for the helix unwinding assay. results showed that EV71 2CATPase could unwind either the 3\u2032- or 5\u2032-protruded helix. native (lanes 1 and 4) or boiled reaction mixture (lanes 2 and 5) was used as a negative or positive control. the blunt-ended RNA helix (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-2CATPase (20 pmol) the helix unwinding activity of 2CATPase can be promoted by the presence of ATP. EV71 2CATPase possesses both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent helix unwinding activities. the standard RNA helix (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-2CATPase in the absence or presence of the indicated NTPs (5 mM) (B) or in the presence of increasing concentrations (0\u20136 mM) of ATP. EV71 2CATPase possesses both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent helix unwinding activities. the ATPase activity of EV71 2CATPase was strictly Mg2+-dependent. this protein was almost unable to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of Mg2+. 2CATPase retains partial helix unwinding activity in the absence of Mg2+ or any divalent ions (Fig 4G, lane 3; S4D Fig, lane 3). EV71 2CATPase prefers neutral pH as an optimal reaction condition. previous studies reported that the ATPase activity of poliovirus 2CATPase can be inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) [26], which is a potent inhibitor of enterovirus VPg-uridylation and vRNA replication. this protein could still unwind a portion of the RNA helix even at high concentrations of GnHCl. 2CATPase unwounds the 3\u2032-protruded helix in the absence or presence of ATP. the helix unwinding activity of 2CATPase on the 5\u2032-protruded helix is independent of its ATPase activity. EV71 2CATPase unwinds the 3\u2032-protruded RNA helix more efficiently than the 5\u2032-protruded one in the presence of ATP. the 3\u2032-protruded helix substrate was reacted with MBP-2CATPase (20 pmol) in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. EV71 2CATPase destabilizes structured RNA strands and stimulates annealing RNA chaperones. two 42-nt complementary RNA strands formed defined stem-loop structures. one strand was 5\u2032 HEX-labeled, and the other was not labeled as indicated. 2CATPase destabilizes structured RNA strands and stimulates annealing. the two strands were 1:1 mixed (0.1 pmol each) and reacted with 5 pmol each indicated protein. the hybridization assay as in (B and C) was performed in the absence of 5 pmol MBP-fusion EV71 2CATPase for different reaction times (5\u201320 min) a canonical hammerhead ribozyme enhancement assay was used to further verify and characterize the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 2CATPase. the presence of 2CATPase effectively enhanced ribozyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. the ribozyme is a 58-nt unlabeled RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. the HEX-labeled 16-nt cleavage product (blue) was detected via denaturing gel electrophoresis and scanning. non-ribozyme supplementation in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of 2CATPase was used as a negative control. the loss of helix unwinding resulted in the complete loss of helix unwinding in the absence of ATP. the helix unwinding activity of 2CATPaseCTD was partially restored. the helix unwinding activity of 2CATPaseCTD was partially restored. EV71 2CATPase facilitates enteroviral (+)RNA synthesis in vitro. it has been proposed that during vRNA replication of (+)RNA viruses, replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA must be unwound [45] the presence of increasing amounts of 2CATPase was unable to promote (+)RNA synthesis. the primer was absent, 3Dpol was unable to mediate RdRP activity. 2CATPase facilitates 3Dpol-mediated enteroviral RNA synthesis in vitro. the relative RNA production was determined by comparing the RNA product level in the presence of the indicated amount of MBP-2CATPase at each time point with the RNA product level in the absence of MBP-2CATPase at 30 min. the in vitro transcribed (-)RNA template and primers were preannealed and reacted with recombinant 3Dpol and DIG RNA labeling mix in the absence of increasing amounts (1\u201310 pmol) of 2CATPase helicase-defective GK134AA mutation disrupts ATPase and helicase activity of 2CATPase. mutant EV71 RNA transcripts were transfected into human RD cells. virus production was detected via immunofluorescence staining of EV71 VP1. EV71 transcript in RD cells 24 h.p.t. was detected via immunofluorescent staining of EV71 VP1 with anti-VP1 antibody (green) the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the merged image represents the digital superimposition of green and blue signals. 2CATPase encoded by another enterovirus exhibits similar activities. the 5\u2032-protruded RNA helix (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-fusion CAV16 2CATPase (20 pmol) in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lanes 4\u20137) of increasing concentrations of ATP as indicated. structural alignment of EV71 2CATPase and AAV2 Rep40 shows that the predicted HC domain of 2CATPase is structurally similar with the counterpart region of Rep40. EV71 2CATPase is similar to other viral SF3 helicases in both conserved motifs and structures. in-gel digestion and high-performance Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. in total, four proteins (MBP-2CATPase, -tubulin, actin and cytochrome P450) were identified with FDR value of 0.97%. majority (97.8%) of all the spectra obtained in the purified protein sample were originated from MBP-2CATPase. a short hexachloro fluorescein (HEX)-labeled RNA and long non-labeled RNA were annealed to generate a standard RNA helix substrate with both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 single-stranded protrusions. the helix unwinding assay was conducted by incubating the RNA helix substrate with purified MBP-2CATPase, followed by gel electrophoresis. the helix unwinding activity was detected via gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9200 imager. the helix unwinding activity was detected via gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9200 imager. each helix substrate was reacted with each indicated protein (20 pmol) EV71 2CATPase directs both 5\u20323\u2032 and 3\u20325\u2032 unwinding of RNA helices. each substrate was then incubated with 2CATPase for the helix unwinding assay. results showed EV71 2CATPase could unwind either the 3\u2032- or 5\u2032-protruded helix. helix unwinding activity of 2CATPase can be promoted by presence of ATP. ATP promotes helicase activities in a dose-dependent manner. helix unwinding activity of 2CATPase can be promoted by the presence of ATP. EV71 2CATPase possesses both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent helix unwinding activities. results indicate that the helix unwinding activity of EV71 2CATPase needs the participation of ATP or other NTPs. EV71 2CATPase possesses both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent helix unwinding activities. the ATPase activity of EV71 2CATPase was strictly Mg2+-dependent. this protein was almost unable to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of ATP. 2CATPase retains partial helix unwinding activity in the absence of Mg2+ or any divalent ions (Fig 4G, lane 3; S4D Fig, lane 3). EV71 2CATPase inhibited both activities in a dose-dependent manner. ase exhibited the highest helix unwinding activity with pH 7.5. previous studies reported that the ATPase activity of poliovirus 2CATPase can be inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) [26], which is a potent inhibitor of enterovirus VPg-uridylation and vRNA replication. EV71 2CATPase contains both helix unwinding directionality and ATP dependency. results showed that the 2CATPase unwound the 3\u2032-protruded helix in an ATP-dependent manner. the unwinding activity of 2CATPase on the 5\u2032-protruded helix is independent of its ATPase activity. EV71 2CATPase unwinds the 3\u2032-protruded RNA helix more efficiently than the 5\u2032-protruded one in the presence of ATP. results consistent with previous observation that 2CATPase unwinds the 3\u2032-protruded RNA helix more efficiently than the 5\u2032-protruded one in the presence of ATP. EV71 2CATPase destabilizes structured RNA strands and stimulates annealing RNA chaperones. two 42-nt complementary RNA strands formed defined stem-loop structures. of the two, one strand was 5\u2032 HEX-labeled, and the other was not labeled. 2CATPase destabilizes structured RNA strands and stimulates annealing. the two strands were 1:1 mixed (0.1 pmol each) and reacted with 5 pmol each indicated protein. the hybridization assay as in (B and C) was performed in the absence of 5 pmol MBP-fusion EV71 2CATPase for different reaction times (5\u201320 min) as indicated. a canonical hammerhead ribozyme enhancement assay was used to further verify and characterize the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 2CATPase. the presence of 2CATPase effectively enhanced ribozyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. the ribozyme is a 58-nt unlabeled RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. the RNA substrate was incubated with the ribozyme in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 2) of increasing amounts (0.1\u20132 pmol) of MBP-2CATPase as indicated. the HEX-labeled 16-nt cleavage product (blue) was detected via denaturing gel electrophoresis and scanning. the loss of 2CATPase CTD resulted in the complete loss of helix unwinding in the absence of ATP. the helix unwinding activity of 2CATPaseCTD was partially restored in the presence of ATP. EV71 2CATPase facilitates enteroviral (+)RNA synthesis in vitro. the presence of 2CATPase significantly promoted the synthesis of (+)RNA strands from the (-)RNA template by 3Dpol. the presence of 2CATPase was dose dependent. 2CATPase helicase activity is not to directly enhance the RdRP activity of 3Dpol or smoothen the template. when the primer was absent, 3Dpol was unable to mediate RdRP activity. 2CATPase facilitates 3Dpol-mediated enteroviral RNA synthesis in vitro. eled) products from the experiments in (B) were measured via bio-Rad Quantity One software. the relative RNA production was determined by comparing the RNA product level in the presence of the indicated amount of MBP-2CATPase at each time point with the RNA product level in the absence of MBP-2CATPase at 30 min. AA mutation in the motif A of poliovirus 2CATPase resulted in the inhibition of virus growth. the mutation disrupted the ATPase and helicase activity of 2CATPase. RNA replication was measured via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 24 and 48 hours post-transfection. EV71 transcript in RD cells 24 h.p.t. was detected via immunofluorescent staining of EV71 VP1 with anti-VP1 antibody (green) the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the merged image represents the digital superimposition of green and blue signals. 2CATPase encoded by another enterovirus exhibits similar activities. the 5\u2032-protruded RNA helix (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-fusion CAV16 2CATPase (20 pmol) in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lanes 4\u20137) of increasing concentrations of ATP as indicated. previous studies have shown that the ATPase activity of 2CATPase could be inhibited by GnHCl. dRP-mediated vRNA synthesis from vRNA template in vitro abolished EV71 RNA replication and virus production. 2CATPase-mediated RNA remodeling activities are also conserved in CAV16. the RNA genomes contain multiple cis-acting elements, including the 5\u2032 cloverleaf, 3\u2032 UTR-poly(A), internal origin of replication (oriI or cre), internal ribosomal entry site and the cloverleaf at the 3\u2032-end of (-)-vRNA [53\u201355]. these highly structured RNA elements play indispensable roles in the replication, translation, and encapsidation of enteroviral RNAs [23,24, 2CATPase from EoV, an insect picorna-like virus, possesses an ATP-independent RNA chaperone activity but not helicase activity [30]. this observation obviously contradicts the indispensable role of the motif A \u201cGKS\u201d in the ATPase and helicase activities of defined SF3 helicases, including EV71 2CATPase. RNA helicases and ATP-independent RNA chaperones are recognized as the two distinct classes of RNA remodelers. enteroviral 2CATPase can function as both a typical RNA helicase and an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. a popular model proposed to explain the mechanism is the \u201centropy or disorder transfer\u201d in which certain intrinsic disordered or unstructured regions of RNA chaperones can transfer their disorder or entropy to RNA molecules. many RNA chaperones, such as HIV-1 Vif, Tat and nucleocapsid, flavivirus core protein, hantavirus N protein, and cypovirus VP5, have been predicted to contain multiple intrinsic disordered regions the middle core domains are highly conserved in enteroviruses and other picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and foot-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) the RNA helicase function of enteroviral 2CATPase relies on the conserved helicase motifs and ATPase activity, while specific structural characteristics are the basis of its RNA chaperoning function. plasmids were subjected to pFastBac baculovirus system to express recombinant proteins with an MBP fused at the N-terminal. expression and purification of recombinant proteins performed as previously described. the figure of the EV71 2CATPase 3D structure and the structural alignment with AAV2 Rep40 (PDB ID code 1U0J) were drawn by PyMOL program 1.1 (DeLano Scientific LLC, South San Francisco, CA) of the two strands, one was labeled at the 5\u2032 end with hexachloro-fluorescein (HEX), and the other strand was unlabeled.
