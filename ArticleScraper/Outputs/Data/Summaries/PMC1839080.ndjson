{"summary": "phylogenetic analysis of large DNA viruses is often difficult due to the presence of horizontal gene transfer events. the recent composition vector approach, not sensitive to such events, is applied here to reconstruct the phylogeny of 124 large DNA viruses. gene mosaicism of phages has been known for a long time. the high substitution rate of viruses also limits sequence-based methods from revealing distant evolutionary relationships. some attempts have been made to combine viral structure and function characteristics and genomic information of their hosts into sequence information [11,17] we present a phylogenetic analysis of large DNA viruses with the CV method [20,27,28] and discuss their relationships at a deep level. the results are mostly consistent with the biologist's systematics with only a few outliers. the results are mostly consistent with the biologist's systematics with only a few outliers. the unclassified dsDNA viruses are indicated by grey. one of the largest families in dsDNA viruses, Baculoviridae, is composed of two genera, Granulovirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus. poxviridae The division of Poxviridae into two subfamilies is the same as in the systematics of ICTV. ECTV and CPXV are the most divergent within the cluster Orthopoxviruses in ChPV, ECTV and CPXV are the most divergent. the rest two ungulate herpesviruses within Rhadinoviruses, AIHV-1 and EHV-2, are divergent from others. but another ungulate herpesvirus, BoHV-4, clusters closely to HHV-8 and CeHV-17. all Iridoviruses except IIV-6 fall into one cluster in fig. 1. DPV locates between Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus but not very close to each of them. DPV locates between Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus but not very close to each of them. DPV is consistent with dissimilarities in sequence comparisons between OsHV-1 and herpesviridae. the two genera, Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus, both comprise viruses from a variety of hosts locate between another two genera, Mastadenovirus whose hosts are mammals. this variety of host origin supports the hypothesis that interspecies transmission may have occurred [29] our analysis apparently provides equal support to the last two hypotheses as postulated by Herniou [30], without comparing the division time of viruses and their hosts. the division of Poxviridae into two subfamilies Chordopoxvirinae (ChPV) and Entomopoxvirinae (EnPV) is similar to in ICTV's systematics of ICTV. the Gamma-subfamily consists of two genera, Lymphocryptovirus and Rhadinovirus. the rest two ungulate herpesviruses within Rhadinoviruses, AIHV-1 and EHV-2, are divergent from others. but another ungulate herpesvirus, BoHV-4, clusters closely to HHV-8. several unclassified viruses are analyzed for hints for their possible taxonomic statuses. DPV locates between Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus but not very close to each of them. DPV locates between Suipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus but not very close to each of them. CV method could circumvent the ambiguity of choosing orthologs especially for viruses because substitution rate of viruses is high and only a few number of universal common genes could be found. combining many genes could reduce sampling error and converge phylogenies on correct solution with good support. we used two sets of data in our previous analysis on bacteria. one is based on whole genomes, and the other is a set of ribosome proteins. the method could be a well supplement to the traditional methods. the additional file 1 lists the dsDNA viruses used, their abbreviations, and the NCBI accession numbers. the main steps of the method are: collect all amino acid sequences of a species. a random background needs to be subtracted from these frequencies by using a Markov model of order (K - 2). CV method avoids the problems caused by HGT on the application of prokaryotic phylogeny by using whole genome sequences. but its application on classification of small DNA viruses may be affected by HGT because of relative shorter genome length. authors' contributions LG carried out the molecular phylogenetic studies, participated in the design of program, and drafted the manuscript."}
