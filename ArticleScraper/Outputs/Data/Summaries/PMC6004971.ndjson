{"summary": "142,891 #vaccine tweets were manually coded. all 201 tweets with 100 or more retweets were manually coded. no significant differences occurred in retweet frequency among antivaccine tweets. social media has become a major mode of communication, through which dissemination of information is easier than ever. 21% of all US adults use Twitter, with 42% of those users visiting the platform daily. a minority of users are openly skeptical about vaccines and advocate against vaccination. a twitter user\u2019s friend count is the number of Twitter users whom the user follows on twitter. a Twitter user\u2019s favorite count is the number of likes the user has ever given to other people\u2019s tweets. retweet count is highly skewed with only very few tweets having high retweet count. it is likely that tweets with high retweet count are read by many and may have influence over the knowledge, attitudes, or perceptions of many users. hypothesis 2: Different categories of contents among antivaccine #vaccine tweets differ in their retweet count. we were also interested in the source of information in the provaccine and antivaccine #vaccine tweets. #vaccine dataset was retrieved using Twitter Application Programming Interface (API; Online Supplementary Materialsa) the data contain 142,891 tweets from Twitter with the hashtag #vaccine. data were stratified by month, and a random 1% sample of tweets was collected from each month. tweets that were identified as \u201cantivaccine\u201d (n = 325) were further manually coded into 2 themes that are not mutually exclusive. any antivaccine tweets that did not fall into either of the 2 themes were labeled as miscellaneous (tweets that are antivaccine but do not meet any of the content categories) the original dataset contained 194,259 tweets. tweets with a threshold of greater than or equal to 100 retweets were grouped by subset from the original dataset for further analysis. any tweet that was coded \u201cyes\u201d for Categories 1 and 2 was coded as Category 3. any tweet that did not fall into Category 1 or 2 was coded as Category 1. a new categorical variable of content was thus created. each content category was manually coded as a binary variable (0 = no, 1 = yes) antivaccine sentiment refers to tweets that explicitly communicated to readers that a vaccine is a safe and effective way of preventing diseases. antivaccine sentiment refers to tweets that expressed skepticism or denial of vaccines as a safe and effective way of preventing diseases. the data were dichotomized as either below the geometric mean (labeled as 0) or not (labeled as 1). the short URLs of provaccine sentiment tweets and antivaccine sentiment tweets were resolved using R to their original URLs. antivaccine sentiment refers to tweets that expressed skepticism or denial of vaccines as a safe and effective way of preventing diseases. a total of 1344 tweets in English with categorized sentiments were analyzed. tweets that were identified as \u201cantivaccine\u201d (n = 325) were further manually coded into 2 themes that are not mutually exclusive. the data were dichotomized as either below the geometric mean (labeled as 0) or not (labeled as 1). the cutoff value of = 0.05 was chosen a priori for statistical significance. each content category was coded as a binary variable (0 = no, 1 = yes) both EBB and MEG independently, manually coded all 201 tweets. values for all content categories were > 0.8, implying a good interrater reliability. the original dataset contained 194,259 tweets. tweets with a threshold of greater than or equal to 100 retweets were grouped by subset from the original dataset for further analysis. any tweet that was coded \u201cyes\u201d for Categories 1 and 2 was coded as Category 3. any tweet that did not fall into Category 1 or 2 was coded as Category 1. a new categorical variable of content was thus created. of tweets with URL links therein were observed among the 4 categories (2 = 3.0012, degrees of freedom = 3, p = 0.3914) a Content category of tweet Frequency (%) of tweets with URL in the category Example Descriptive statistics of the 1% stratified random sample of #vaccine tweets All 1344 (100) 621 (46.2) subcategories of antivaccine sentiment are not mutually exclusive. an antivaccine tweet may meet the criteria of multiple subcategories. tweets deemed irrelevant or whose sentiment was unable to be determined. tral 7067.41 1345 361 3102.5 9 415,830 Antivaccine 14,766.92 2105 689 6182 11 247,004 Users\u2019 friend count All 3651.98 771 302.75 2054.75 0 157,038 Provaccine 2075.51 696.5 280 1836 0 121,919 Neutral 2306.17 698 231.5 1664 0 154,537 Antivaccine 8181.03 1362 4 antivaccine tweets received more retweets than provaccine tweets and neutral tweets. antivaccine tweets received more retweets than provaccine tweets. retweet frequency of tweets posted by users with high follower count was 3.88 times. a total of 411 URL links were identified in 436 provaccine tweets. a total of 296 URL links were identified in 325 antivaccine tweets. a total of 296 URL links were identified in 325 antivaccine tweets. one in 5 tweets mentioned the global vaccination improvement/efforts (21%;

ION analyzed two datasets of vaccine-related tweets. retweet frequency of random tweets in the #vaccine corpus. antivaccine tweets received 4.13 times as many retweets as neutral tweets. provaccine tweets received 1.58 times as many retweets as neutral tweets. sources of information (URL domains) identified in the sample of #vaccine tweets can help public health professionals understand through which platforms people are gathering their information about vaccines. this could reflect the growing trends that individuals rely on social media as their main source of news and information, compared with direct visits to Web sites of media or health organizations. the #vaccineswork dataset found distrust of the industry and government agencies that communicate provaccine scientific messages. the results added further evidence to the literature that people with antivaccine sentiment obtain and share information from alternative sources. however, simply releasing more scientific information online through Web sites and social media may not help. retweet frequency is only one of several metrics used to measure engagement of social media users with the original posts. some fake accounts or Internet \u201cbots\u201d could artificially boost the retweet frequency of some tweets. antivaccine tweets and provaccine tweets were 4.1 and 1.6 times more likely to be retweet-ed than provaccine tweets. #vaccines-work tweets did not find evidence of differences in retweet frequency."}
