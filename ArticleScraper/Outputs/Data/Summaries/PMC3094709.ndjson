{"summary": "a growing interest in the use of naturally occurring compounds with chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties for the treatment of cancers. apoptosis is a gene-regulated phenomenon induced by many chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment. the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is considered very useful in the management and therapy as well as in the prevention of cancer. species of this genus is Scutellaria baicalensis. it is used as a source of flavonoids in traditional Chinese medicine. recently, it has been shown that flavonoids from S. baicalensis could arrest some tumor cell lines and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. anticancer researches have not yet been conducted on S. litwinowii root extract. in an attempt it is sought to study the cytotoxic properties of S. litwinowii root extract on some common cancer cell lines. adenocarcinoma of the stomach is the seventh most common cause of cancer death. the plant was identified by Mr M.R. Joharchi, in FUMH. dry powdered roots (100 g) of S. litwinowii were extracted with methanol (4 0.5 l) and were then concentrated at 50\u00b0C under reduced pressure to dryness. the concentrated extract was then extracted with an equal volume of n-hexane, three times, to give a fraction containing non-polar compounds, such as lipids. cells were seeded at 5000 cell per well onto 96-well culture plates. for each concentration and time course study, there was a control sample that remained untreated and received the equal volume of medium. cell viability was determined using a modified MTT assay [26, 27] Floating and adherent cells were cultured overnight in a 24-well plate and treated with S. litwinowii for 24 h. 750 l of a hypotonic buffer (50 g ml1 PI in 0.1% sodium citrate + 0.1% Triton X-100) were harvested and incubated overnight in the dark. the concentrated extract was then concentrated at 50\u00b0C under reduced pressure to dryness. the solution was successively partitioned between CH2Cl2, ethylacetate (etOAc) and n-butanol (n-BuOH) and finally water. all the isolated fractions were subjected to cytotoxic and apoptosis assays. cells were seeded (5000 cell per well) onto flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates. they were allowed to grow for 24 h followed by treatment with total extract (5\u20131000 g ml1), n-Hexane (5\u2013160 g ml1), defatted fraction (6.25\u20131280 g ml1), CH2Cl2, EtOAc, n-BuOH, H2O soluble fractions (5\u2013160 g m cytotoxicity of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii was examined on malignant cell lines. toxicity started at a concentration as little as 80 g ml1 and the dose inducing IC50 against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 was calculated 216.1, 250.0, 723 and 243.9. the IC50 of the defatted extract against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 was 372.0, 888.1, 1150 and 567.5 for 24 h. the IC50 of the defatted extract against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 was 372.0, 888.1, 1150 and 567.5 for 24 h. dose-dependent growth inhibition of malignant cell lines by CH2Cl2 fraction (5\u2013160 g ml1) after 24 h. viability was quantitated by MTT assay. apoptosis following treatment with CH2Cl2 fraction of S. litwinowii (50 g ml1) was measured with PI staining and flow cytometry, aiming to detect the sub-G1 peak resulting from DNA fragmentation. Flow cytometry histogram of positive control in which cells were cultured in serum free medium and of CH2Cl2 fraction-treated cells were studied. concentrations of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii (5\u20131000 g ml1) for 48 h. result showed this extract decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. toxicity started at a concentration as little as 80 g ml1 and the dose inducing IC50 against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 was calculated 216.1, 250.0, 723 and 243.9 respectively. 888.1, 1150 and 567.5 for 24 h respectively. results are mean SD (n = 3). ***P.001 compared to control. cell line Fraction n-Hexane CH2Cl2 EtOAc n-BuOH H2O AGS >300 121.2 3.1 >300 >300 >300 HeLa >300 40.9 2.5 >300 >300 >300 MCF-7 >300 115.9 3.5 >300 >300 >300 PC12 >300 64.5 3.4 >300 >300 >300 >300 >300. toxicity started at a concentration as little as 80 g ml1. the dose inducing IC50 against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 was calculated 216.1, 250.0, 723 and 243.9, respectively. results are mean SD (n = 3). the IC50 values of this fraction against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 cell lines after 24 h were determined, 121.2 3.1, 40.9 2.5, 115.9 3.5 and 64.5 3.4 g ml1 respectively. the other fractions showed no prominent cytotoxicity on the cell lines tested. IC50 values were expressed as the mean SD (n = 3). the CH2Cl2 fraction could inhibit the proliferation of cells that is comparable with baicalein. cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects of S. litwinowii on different cancer cell lines were investigated. cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects of S. litwinowii on different cell lines were investigated. apoptosis is an important homeostatic mechanism that balances cell division and cell death and maintains the appropriate number of cell in the body. a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis controls normal organ development. baicalein is a flavone isolated from the plant Scutellariae radix. this flavonoid has modulating effects on drug metabolizing enzymes. further studies are needed to fully recognize mechanisms involved in cell death."}
