{"summary": "avian influenza (AI) is a major zoonotic viral disease that causes significant adverse impacts on poultry production, the global trade, and public health [1\u20134]. despite decades of research and control efforts, the incidences and severity of AI outbreaks have not been alleviated but rather increased. some countries have incorporated vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs. live viral-vectored vaccines can induce a broader range of protection compared to IIV. but they have several shortcomings including reduced efficacy due to preexisting immunity to the viral vector. in humans, LAIV has been used for more than a decade. pc4-LAIV is attenuated and does not transmit from chicken to chicken. the high level of immunogenicity of pc4-LAIV is due to the deficiency of its NS1 in antagonizing the induction and signaling pathways of type I interferon. single vaccination with pc4-LAIV was highly immunogenic and protective in chickens vaccinated at 1 day and 3 weeks of age. pc4-LAIV was better than IIV, and adaptive immune responses appeared to depend on the type of vaccine. neither of the vaccines could provide full protection against heterologous challenge virus. leghorn chickens were housed in a BSL2 facility with forced air ventilation and adequate air exchanges to prevent ammonia build up. the birds were kept in large cages (2592 sq. inch) before infection and transferred to model 934\u20131 isolators (900 sq. inch) four 1-day-old birds were split into three groups (LAIV, IIV, and unvaccinated) each bird in the LAIV group was intranasally vaccinated with 1106 EID50 doses of the vaccine virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final volume of 200 L. the CK/NJ/02 virus shares 87.5% amino acid sequence similarity in the HA1 protein with wildtype TK/OR/71 (H7N3) virus. at 3 and 5 days post-challenge, six or seven birds from each group were euthanized to harvest tracheal tissue for titration of the challenge virus titers. the prime-boost groups (LAIV-LAIV, LAIV-IIV, and IIV-IIV) received priming and boost vaccinations at 1 day and 3 weeks of age. the birds were bled at 4 and 5 weeks of age to measure post-vaccination serum antibody titers. gene expression levels were calculated as fold changes over the unvaccinated control group. chickens were bled via wing veins and the blood was incubated overnight. HI test was conducted in accordance with the recommendation of the world organization for animal health (OIE) tear samples were collected using a competitive ELISA kit. three different ELISA kits were used to detect antibodies in tears. 96 well microtiter plates were coated with purified whole inactivated TK/OR/71 H7N3 virus at 4\u00b0C overnight. the following day, the plates were warmed to room temperature for 2 hours. from this point onward, all manipulations were done at room temperature. the birds were kept in large cages (2592 sq. inch) before infection and transferred to Model 934\u20131 isolators (900 sq. inch) the birds were humanely euthanized when they displayed symptoms such as ammonia build up. euthanasia was actualized by exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) based on age and body size, 1\u201310 animals were placed in the euthanasia chamber connected to a CO2 source. the CO2 flow was set at 10\u201330% displacement of chamber volume/minute. birds were checked for an absence of breathing and lack of heartbeat. the unvaccinated control group did not receive any treatment. the ISA 70 adjuvant does not have non-specific antiviral effects. all birds were monitored for clinical symptoms and behavioral changes. unvaccinated, single dose (groups 1d LAIV, 1d IIV, 3w LAIV, and 3w IIV), and prime-boost (groups LAIV-LAIV, LAIV-IIV, and IIV-IIV) the single vaccination groups were vaccinated only once at 1 day or 3 weeks of age. the live vaccine, LAIV, derived from TK/OR/71 (H7N3) virus was administered through intranasal route, while inactivated vaccine, a mixture of inactivated TK/OR/71 (H7N3) virus and adjuvant was administered into subcutaneous area. each bird was intranasally vaccinated with 1106 EID50 doses of the vaccine virus. at 1 and 3 days post-vaccination, five birds from each group were euthanized to collect trachea and spleen samples for use in transcriptional analysis. at 14 dpv, 10 birds were randomly selected from each group and serum and tear samples were collected to measure systemic and mucosal antibody responses. the CK/NJ/02 virus had been used in our previous studies. unvaccinated, single dose (groups 1d LAIV, 1d IIV, 3w LAIV, and 3w IIV) and prime-boost (groups LAIV-LAIV, LAIV-IIV, and IIV-IIV) were vaccinated only once at 1 day (1d LAIV and 1d IIV) or 3 weeks (3w LAIV and 3w IIV) a mixture of inactivated TK/OR/71 (H7N3) virus and adjuvant was administered into subcutaneous area. transcriptional analysis Trachea and spleen samples were homogenized in Trizol reagent. total RNA was extracted as previously described. serum showed a HI activity in dilution of 21 or higher. cross HI test was conducted on live or beta-propiolactone-inactivated virus. the percent antigenic relatedness was calculated as previously described by archetti and Horsfall. Influenza virus-specific IgG response was measured using the same kit described for IgG except that the secondary antibody was replaced with 10000 fold diluted HRP-labeled anti-Chicken IgA (chain specific) the level of IgG or IgA was represented as raw OD values. the avidity index was defined as the OD with urea treatment / OD without urea x100. the avidity index was defined as the OD with urea treatment / OD without urea x100. the most consistent and apparent changes were observed in ISGs, 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS and Mx genes. both vaccines were able to induce a significant upregulation of 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS in 1 dpv trachea and spleen tissues. but there was no significant difference between the two vaccine groups. the bars represent log2 fold change in transcription level of ISGs and IFN genes. dpv = days post-vaccination. pre-challenge antibody levels in serum and tears at 14 dpv. both laIV and IIV vaccinations induced significant amounts of IgG antibodies. levels of induction of IgA was higher in the IIV group than in the unvaccinated group. only the LAIV group had significant IgA levels compared to the unvaccinated group. chickens were challenged with 1106 EID50 doses of a heterologous virus. CK/NJ/02 (H7N2) is heterologous to TK/OR/71 (H7N3) based on differences in HA1 sequences and low cross-reactivity of serum HI antibodies. a significant reduction in challenge virus replication was observed in the unvaccinated control group. more than half of birds in the IIV group (5/7) were virus positive with a median titer of 103.96 EID50 Equivalent /ml. the effect of antisera production method on the percent antigenic relatedness value between TK/OR/71 and CK/NJ/02 (H7N2) antigens. tracheas were collected and washed with 2 ml of PBS. the replication level of challenge virus was determined by qRT-PCR. titers are expressed as median egg infectious doses per ml of tracheal wash supernatant. all but one bird in the 3w IIV group seroconverted to homologous viral antigen by 1-week post vaccination (wpv) the median titer reached 24 HI units. the 3w IIV group (29 HI units) had a higher titer than the 3w LAIV group (26 HI units) laIV-IIV groups showed higher seroconversion rates (100%) for homologous and heterologous strains compared to the IIV-IIV group. the performance of the LAIV-IIV regimen was outstanding in terms of inducing the most rapid seroconversion and the highest HI serum antibody titers compared to the other groups. HI titers against heterologous antigen were about 20-fold lower than homologous titers when hyper-immune sera prepared by IIV vaccination were used. the difference between the vaccine and heterologous challenge strains was lower in sera from the groups primed with LAIV (LAIV-LAIV and LAIV-IIV) the bars and lines represent the average and standard deviation of Log2 HI titers at 5 weeks of age (5 wpv for 1d IIV and 1d LAIV; 2 wpv for 3w LAIV and 3w IIV) numbers indicated above the bars and lines show average HI titer differences obtained by subtracting heterologous titers from homologous strains. the LAIV-LAIV group showed consistently high mucosal antibody responses across all three ELISA tests. the single vaccination regimens administered at 3 weeks of age showed a trend similar to the 1-day-old vaccination result. no differences in anti-NP or IgG antibodies and higher IgA responses in LAIV groups compared with IIV groups. the 3w LAIV regimen was significantly protective despite its inability to induce heterologous HI antibodies. chickens were challenged with heterologous virus and tracheal swabs were taken at 2 and 4 days post challenge to determine the level of challenge virus replication. serum antibody avidity (compare 1d LAIV vs 1d IIV, 3w LAIV vs 3w IIV, and LAIV-LAIV vs IIV-IIV) was the highest index of 100%. serum HI antibodies were collected at 2 or 5 weeks post vaccination. both vaccines were able to induce a significant upregulation of 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS in 1 dpv trachea and spleen tissues. despite having a lower magnitude of upregulation in the IIV group compared to the LAIV group. the bars represent log2 fold change in transcription level of ISGs and IFN genes. Error bars represent meanSD (n = 5 birds per group) dpv = days post-vaccination. pre-challenge antibody levels in serum and tears at 14 dpv. induction of IgA was observed in both vaccinated groups. only the LAIV group had significant IgA levels compared to the unvaccinated group. CK/NJ/02 (H7N2) is heterologous to TK/OR/71 (H7N3) based on differences in HA1 sequences and low cross-reactivity of serum HI antibodies. the median challenge virus titer of the unvaccinated control group was about 1 log lower than the unvaccinated group. the cross HI test between vaccine strain (TK/OR/71, H7N3) and challenge strain (CK/NJ/02, H7N2) was conducted separately among antisera produced by live virus infection. the cross HI test result was converted into percent antigenic relatedness as follows. challenge virus was determined by qRT-PCR. titers are expressed as median egg infectious doses per ml of tracheal wash supernatant. dpv trachea and spleen samples by both types of vaccinations showed a significant downregulation of 2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS gene transcription was induced by IIV vaccination. overall, ISG transcription was upregulated in both types of tissues at 1 dpv and reduced or downregulated at 3 dpv. the anti-NP ELISA kit is based on an inhibitory ELISA format. it detects any kind of antibodies that bind to the NP protein. vaccinated groups had significantly higher NPRI values than the unvaccinated group. asterisks indicate significant differences compared with unvaccinated group. CK/NJ/02 (H7N2) is heterologous to TK/OR/71 (H7N3) based on differences in HA1 sequences and low cross-reactivity of serum HI antibodies. the median challenge virus titer of the LAIV group was about 1 log lower than the unvaccinated group. no virus was detected from more than half of the birds in the LAIV group (4/7). more than half of birds in the IIV group (5/7) were virus positive. r2 = cross HI titer of H7N3 antisera to H7N3 antisera to H7N2 antigen / HI titer of H7N2 antigen to H7N2 antigen. study 2 was designed to determine whether the beneficial effects from each vaccine can be exploited to produce a more efficacious vaccination regimen. single (non-prime-boost) vaccinations (1d LAIV, 1d IIV, 3w LAIV, and 3w IIV) compared with single (non-prime-boost) vaccinations (1d LAIV, 1d IIV, 3w LAIV, and 3w IIV) compared with single (non-prime-boost) vaccinations (1d LAIV, 1d IIV, 3w LAIV, and 3w IIV) single vaccinations could induce homologous seroconversion in all birds at 5 weeks of age (5 wpv for 1d IIV and 1d LAIV; 2 wpv for 3w LAIV and 3w IIV) the prime-boost regimen was administered at 1-day and 3 weeks of age, respectively. the individual and median HI titers are illustrated as symbols and horizontal lines. cross-reactivity of serum antibodies with homologous and heterologous viral antigens. on average, HI titers against heterologous antigen were about 20-fold lower than homologous titers. cross-HI test calculated the percent antigenic relatedness (R %) as previously described. we found consistently higher R values in antisera produced by live CK/NJ/02 (H7N2) virus infection than vaccination with inactivated vaccine. tear samples were collected at 5 weeks of age (5 wpv for 1d IIV and 1d LAIV; 2 wpv for 3w LAIV and 3w IIV) to measure antibody levels. the NPRI and OD values shown on the y-axis were normalized to the mean value of the unvaccinated group. CK/NJ/02 virus was used as the heterologous challenge virus. the protective efficacy was assessed in terms of the ability of the vaccine regimen to reduce challenge virus replication in trachea. the avidity was lower in younger (2 week old) birds compared to older (5 week old) birds. the laIV-IIV prime-boost regimen stood out by having a highest index of 100%. at 3 weeks of age, there was a clear difference between single vaccination regimens of live and inactivated vaccines (3w LAIV versus 3w IIV) all but one bird in the 3w LAIV group seroconverted to homologous viral antigen by 1-week post vaccination (wpv) and the median titer reached 24 HI units. at the same time point, three out of eight birds in the 3w IIV group failed to show homologous seroconversion. serum antibody response to homologous (TK/OR/71 (H7N3)) and heterologous (CK/NJ/02 (H7N2)) strains at 4 and 5 weeks of age. four weeks of age corresponded with 4 wpv for 1d IIV and 1d LAIV. 5 weeks of age corresponded with 5 wpv for 1d IIV and 1d LAIV. the difference of HI titer between the vaccine and heterologous challenge strains was lower in sera from the groups primed with LAIV (LAIV-LAIV and LAIV-IIV) the HI titer difference between the two strains at 2 wpb was 22.2 HI units in LAIV-LAIV group. HI titer differences in other groups were 24 HI unit or higher, except 1d LAIV group (22.3 HI units) numbers indicated above the bars and lines show average HI titer differences obtained by subtracting heterologous titers from homologous titers. all groups that received vaccination at 3 weeks of age had higher levels of total anti-NP and IgG antibodies compared with the unvaccinated control group. Fig 7 shows that vaccination with LAIV, as a priming or booster vaccine, resulted in induction of significantly higher levels of IgA responses. single vaccination regimens administered at 3 weeks of age (3w IIV and 3w LAIV) showed a trend similar to the 1-day-old vaccination result. no differences in anti-NP or IgG antibodies and higher IgA responses in LAIV groups compared with IIV groups. CK/NJ/02 virus was used as the heterologous challenge virus. the 3w LAIV regimen was significantly protective (Fig 8) despite its inability to induce heterologous HI antibodies. chickens were challenged with heterologous virus and tracheal swabs were taken at 2 and 4 days post challenge to determine the level of challenge virus replication. serum samples collected at 2 or 5 weeks post vaccination at 1 day of age or 2 weeks post boost-vaccination (5 weeks of age) were tested for their avidity as previously described. a prime-boost vaccination regimen utilizing both live and inactivated vaccines elicited a robust activation of systemic and mucosal adaptive immune responses. we previously showed that the ability of NS1-truncated LAIV candidates to induce a rapid development of adaptive immune responses was strongly associated with upregulation of 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS and Mx genes. similar pattern of ISG expression was observed in birds vaccinated at 1 day of age, especially in trachea at 1-day post-vaccination. serum antibody response does not always correlate with protective efficacy of live vaccines. underlying mechanism of serum antibody-independent viral clearance by live vaccines is postulated to be driven by mucosal IgA or CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses. the vaccination of 1 day old chickens with adenovirus vectored H5 and H7 influenza vaccine could induce IgA response in lachrymal fluid and increased interleukin-6 expression without inducing detectable levels of serum antibodies. there were clear differences between the protective efficacy of LAIV and IIV in 1-day-old chickens. 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later. the LAIV-IIV regimen was remarkably synergistic in enhancing cross-reactivity with the heterologous antigen. the mean heterologous HI titers induced by LAIV were at least 7 times higher than the mean HI titers of 1d LAIV and 3w IIV groups combined. antigenic relatedness was higher with serum produced by live CK/NJ/02 (H7N2) virus infection relative to hyper-immune serum produced by a matched IIV. however, the antibodies produced by live viral infection seem to have a stronger cross-reactivity to heterologous antigen. a single dose of LAIV is able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of conventional IIV. a single dose of LAIV is able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of conventional IIV."}
