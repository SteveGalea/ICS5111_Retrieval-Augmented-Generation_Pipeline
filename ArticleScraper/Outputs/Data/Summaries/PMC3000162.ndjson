{"summary": "a physician from southern china who stayed on the 9th floor of a hotel during this period is believed to have been the source of infection for this patient and the index patients of outbreaks in Vietnam and Canada. the patient had oral temperature of 37.6\u00b0C and was lethargic. the chest was clear to auscultation. nasopharyngeal aspirates swab taken on day 7 of hospitalization showed viral particles of 100 nm with widely spaced, club-shaped surface projections characteristic of coronaviruses. nineteen of these 20 patients were admitted to our hospital for treatment and isolation. the demographic profiles of the index and 19 contact cases are shown. the median age of patients was 28 years. all were previously healthy, except one who had diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal failure. Lymphopenia, as defined by a cell count of 1.5 x 109/L, was present in 18 of 20 patients. other common laboratory abnormalities included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, mild hyponatremia, mild hypokalemia, and raised hepatic transaminases. the most common pattern noted initially was interstitial infiltrates at the base of the right lung. the most common pattern noted initially was interstitial infiltrates at the base of the right lung. the most common pattern noted initially was interstitial infiltrates at the base of the right lung. nasopharyngeal aspirates in 4 of 10 patients. the clinical course of the illness is shown. in 11 patients, oxygen saturation fell below 95%, and supplemental oxygen was instituted. six of these patients subsequently required mechanical ventilation. levofloxacin or a combination of intravenous ceftriaxone and a macrolide were prescribed to 6 and 14 patients. most were prescribed from day 10 to day 14 of symptoms. patients with ARDS were supported aggressively with intubation. median age of patients was 28 years, except one who had diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal failure and one who had a history of childhood asthma. median incubation period was 4 days (estimated range 2\u20138 days) median period from onset of symptoms to admission was 6 days (range 0\u20139 days) Lymphopenia, as defined by a cell count of 1.5 x 109/L, was present in 18 of 20 patients. other common laboratory abnormalities included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, mild hyponatremia, mild hypokalemia and raised hepatic transaminases. mmol/L)a 3.2 (1.5) 2.9 (1.9\u20138.5) Creatinine (25\u2013100 umol/L)a 65.4 (12.4) 65 (39\u201388) Sodium (135\u2013145 mmol/L)a 134.9 (2.8) 135 (131\u2013141) Potassium (3.5\u20135.0 mmol/L)a 3.5 (0.3) 3.6 (2.8\u20134) aThe laboratory results of Patient 20, who had end-stage renal failure, were not in 11 patients, oxygen saturation fell below 95%, and supplemental oxygen was instituted. six subsequently required mechanical ventilation for worsening respiratory failure. all patients were initially treated with either. levofloxacin or a combination of intravenous ceftriaxone and a macrolide were prescribed to 6 and 14 patients. most were prescribed from day 10 to day 14 of symptoms. patients with ARDS were supported aggressively with intubation and mechanical, pressure-controlled ventilation. the index patient infected at least 20 others over a period of several days. a coronavirus was identified on electron microscopy of nasopharyngeal aspirates in our index patient and several of her contacts and is therefore likely to be responsible for this outbreak. ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with known activity against some RNA viruses. a number of patients recovered without use of ribavirin. evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed to advocate the use of ribavirin."}
