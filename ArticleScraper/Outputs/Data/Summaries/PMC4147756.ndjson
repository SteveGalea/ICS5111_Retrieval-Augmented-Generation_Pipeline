{"summary": "microbes have evolved to survive in every type of condition on our planet. many are not harmful, but a few cause life threatening diseases. a large number of microbes have yet to be characterized than are known. traditional methods for identifying pathogens require culturing of bacteria or viruses and detecting them using phenotypic, biochemical, or serological tests. many microorganisms are very difficult to culture or may not grow at all and therefore they cannot be identified using traditional techniques. as many as 99% of all microbial species are estimated to fall into this category. traditional methods for detecting and identifying pathogens require culturing of bacteria or viruses and detecting them using phenotypic, biochemical, or serological tests. traditional methods for identifying pathogens require culturing of bacteria or viruses and detecting them using phenotypic, biochemical, or serological tests. some of the recent molecular detection methods can be performed at once, thus allowing a range of characteristics to be rapidly and simultaneously determined. some of these techniques provide immediate results, but many require extensive computational approaches for analysis and interpretation of the data. recent technologies like DNA microarray, metagenomics, and next generation sequencing are dependent on computational methods and algorithms for handling sequence data. Roche NimbleGen provides long-oligo probes (70 mers) and like eArray, has flexible design capability for advanced gene expression analysis. primer3 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/genomesoftware/other/primer3.html) is commonly used software for designing primers and probes in the development of microarrays. hybridization makes detection of disease causing pathogens possible with high speed, sensitivity, and specificity. DNA microarrays have the capability to screen all the known pathogens and also yet to be identified pathogens simultaneously. metagenomics is a derivation of conventional microbial genomics. it bypasses the requirement for obtaining pure cultures for sequencing. this process begins with sample and metadata collection. the metagenomics RAST server (http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org) provides a new paradigm for the annotation and analysis of metagenomes. different taxonomic classifications can be used for identification and different species identifications may be generated. every genome that goes into the ERGO system is annotated from scratch. more than 450 of the genomes are available for subscription or as part of a stand-alone ERGO server package from Integrated Genomics. next-generation sequencing platforms have made possible massively parallel sequencing without the need for lengthy electrophoresis. two approaches for next-generation sequencing are superior in their ability to perform the task on massively parallel arrays that is made possible by high performance lasers and high resolution detectors. new technologies based on physical sequencing, like nanopore sequencing (oxford nanopore technologies) and a single molecule DNA image based sequencing that is claimed to generate 20 kb plus reads are under development. genome variability and evolution within the host can be tracked over short periods of time. whole-genome sequencing of microbes has revolutionized the methods by which these organisms are studied. it is now possible to sequence entire bacterial and viral genomes by whole genome sequencing. DNA-pyrosequencing has focused on hypervariable regions within small ribosomal-subunit RNA genes. specific hypervariable regions have preferentially been used to identify different classes of bacteria via pyrosequencing. microbes have evolved to survive in every type of condition on our planet. many are not harmful, but some cause life threatening diseases. recent advances in sequencing technologies are raising the possibility of complete understanding of microbial and environmental interactions."}
