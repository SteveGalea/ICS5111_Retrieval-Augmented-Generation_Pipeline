{"summary": "the virus is enveloped with a genome consisting of 8 single-stranded RNA segments in negative orientation. Segments 5 and 6 encode two surface glycoproteins: the Fusion (F) protein and Haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in the HE, the haemagglutinin function destroys the sialic acid bonds promoting virus release [7,8]. non-virulent HPR0 variants of ISAV [4,34\u201338] provide an opportunity to create a comparative model to understand how specific mutations influence surface protein function and virulence in relation to pathogenic strains. virulent ISAV strains may arise from a reservoir of full length non-pathogenic HPR0 through deletion events in the HE gene HPR [4,39,41,43]. lysine (K) in position 276 and arginine (R) in 267 have been proposed. deletions within the HPR were suggested to influence the separation between HE and F proteins with a shorter stalk region resulting in higher fusion levels. sequence insertions near the putative cleavage sites have also been reported. this study aimed at understanding how particular HE and F protein mutations influence specific steps of the ISAV fusion process by using surface glycoproteins from a non-virulent HPR0 genotype as a comparative model. Primers used to generate aa substitutions in the Nevis F protein. Mutated codons are in bold and underlined in each DNA sequence. aa 266\u2013267 12 aa insertion AACAAAGGGGTTGAAGTTGTATT F-Mut- Q266P 266 Substitution Fw AAATACAACTTCAACCCGAGAGCATTCCCAGG Rev CCTGGGGGTTGAAGTTGTATT F-Mut- Ins 2 266\u2013267 10 aa insertion TTCGGACACTCTGTGCACAAGCTTAACCAGAGA Plasmid encoding for the complete cell culture and transfection Chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE-214, ATCC 1681) were cultured, and transfected as described previously [33] using a Neon 10 l kit (Invitrogen), and a total of 2 g DNA per reaction (0.5 g for HE and 1.5 g for the F protein) the same cell solution was dispensed in different cultures including 96 and 48 well plates and 8-well chamber slides. the HE and F-Nevis proteins were also cultured in the presence of 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 M of calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) in both calcium free and calcium containing media. final results were expressed as Firefly luciferase (FF) levels and correspond to the average of independent triplicate experiments. blots were stained using ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham) and visualised with the C-Digit Blot Scanner. results were corrected against the intensity of the actin-beta controls. 67A 267 Substitution Fw CCAGGAGAAGCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT 3 substitutions (G252S, Q266L and Q266P) were generated. from the SK779/06 segment 6 template, 1 mutant HE harbouring an HPR2 deletion was designed using a Q5 site directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the same cell solution was dispensed in different culture plates including 96 and 48 well plates and 8-well chamber slides. the same cell solution was dispensed in different culture plates including 96 and 48 well plates. the same cell solution was dispensed in different culture plates including 96 and 48 well plates. protein fractionation CHSE-214 cells were cultivated on 25 cm2 culture flasks. protein concentrations from each membrane fraction were measured using a ND 1000 nanodrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Thermo Fisher) Western blotting Samples were adjusted to 10 g of protein and mixed with 25 l of loading buffer. ts 4.0 (Lico Biosciences) was used to quantify intensity of each blot. results were corrected against the intensity of the actin-beta controls. percentages illustrate the influence of the F protein mutations or the HE HPR deletion on proteolytic cleavage activity. mutant glycoprotein were measured using dual antibody staining on living cells, fluorescent microscopy and image analysis. they were obtained from triplicate measurements, from three separate experiments. expression levels of each mutated protein were compared with that of the corresponding wild type (WT) protein (in bold) olytic cleavage was examined by western blot using an anti-f polyclonal antibody to visualise the F1 subunit band at 30 kDa (B) similar aa substitutions demonstrated the same findings for the F protein of the Norwegian Glesvaer isolate. an increase in proteolytic cleavage activity was also observed for F-Mut- Q266P, F-Mut- Ins. 1 and F-Mut\u2013 Ins. 2 compared to the WT F-SK779/06 (Fig 3B, lanes 4, 5 and 6), but not for F-Mut- G252S and F-Mut- Q266L. mutant HE and mutant HE and F proteins were co-expressed with mutated F proteins. proteolytic cleavage was examined by western blot (B and D) percentages were obtained by comparing the blot intensity of the group containing a deleted HPR HE and the one from the WT HE SK779/06. 4 out of 6 groups of glycoproteins with a deleted HPR HE showed a higher proteolytic cleavage activity than those of the corresponding groups with a full length HPR HE. in the absence of exogenous culture treatments, 4 out of the 6 groups of glycoproteins with a deleted HE also displayed a higher proteolytic cleavage activity than those of the corresponding groups with a full length HPR HE. fusion activity of HE and F-Nevis protein was measured as described before in presence of various concentrations of calcium ionophore A23187 in calcium free (A) and calcium containing media (B) the activating protease for ISAV fusion was calcium dependent. HRs positions were predicted using the program LearnCoil-VMF. Arrows indicate important aa positions in the proteins. substitutions and insertions introduced into the mutant F proteins (A) and the deletion in the mutant HE (B) are in bold and underlined. proteolytic cleavage still occurred in the presence of the R267A substitution as indicated by the 30 kDa F1 subunit visible in the western blot (Fig 2B, lane 2). the K276A substitution completely abrogated proteolytic cleavage as illustrated by the absence of the F1 subunit band (Fig 2B, lane 2). constructs encoding 5 mutant F proteins were created from the WT HE-SK779/06 protein sequence and co-expressed with the homotypic HE. all 3 substitutions (F-Mut- G252S, F-Mut- Q266L and F-Mut- Q266L) enhanced significantly the fusion activity of the mutant F proteins. an additional HE mutant with an HPR deletion was generated from the WT full length HE-SK779/06 and co-expressed with the different mutated F proteins based on the F-SK779/06 protein. Fusion activity was assessed following addition of exogenous trypsin and low pH. 4 out of the 6 groups of glycoproteins with a full length HPR HE showed a higher proteolytic cleavage activity than those of the corresponding groups with a full length HPR HE. the same groups containing a full length HPR HE had a poor ability to trigger fusion when the cell monolayers were left untreated (Fig 4C, in grey), while the groups consisting of an HPR deleted HE were capable of moderate but significantly higher levels of fusion untreated cell monolayers expressing the HE and F-Nevis protein were cultured with various doses of calcium ionophore A23187. fusion levels detected in the absence of A23187 confirm previous findings that HPR deleted HE from a WT pathogenic strain co-expressed with its homotypic F protein can trigger fusion without the addition of exogenous trypsin. ISAV surface glycoprotein mutations shape the interaction between the attachment and F protein which ultimately influences viral fusion. this may contribute to the different degree of virulence and tissue/cell tropism reported for HPR0 and HPR deleted ISAV genotypes. a non-polar side chain prevented key steps of the hydrolytic reaction to occur. this prevented proteolytic cleavage and subsequent fusion. this provided strong evidence that K276 is the true proteolytic cleavage site in the ISAV F protein. variations in the 3 aa immediately upstream of the cleavage site greatly influence the cleavage by trypsin in different HA subtypes. insertion 2 (AY853944) occurred through recombination of the F gene with a partial sequence of segment 3 [58], and insertion 1 (EU449768) with a part of segment 2 [36]. similar observations were made with the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain ISAV3-89 [80] the mutant HPR0 HE with a deleted HPR provided information specifically on this early fusion triggering phase where the HE primes the F protein prior to cleavage. fusion results under different culture conditions suggest that the HPR length may influence the structural rearrangement of the HE stalk following receptor binding. a similar situation has been reported for NDV, although intracellular cleavage is limited by the presence of a single basic residue at the cleavage site [46,53] this leads to the F protein being cleaved and fusion triggered only when trypsin and low pH are applied at the cell surface [53,90] this would explain why the same ISAV F proteins coupled with a full length HPR HE did not show any fusion activity when cell monolayers were left un this indicated that the protease involved in the processing of ISAV F protein was calcium dependent. this indicated that it belongs to the proprotein convertase family or equivalent in teleost fish. however, the results also suggested that the variations in fusion activities could not be directly attributed to differences in proteolytic cleavage abilities. fusion protein of viruses carrying full length HPR HE may be activated by ubiquitous host cell proteases present in a wider array of tissues. this would allow viruses to fuse and replicate in a wider range of cells and tissues and cause a systemic infection that may lead to mortality. HPR deletion influenced the ability of HE to prime the F protein and promote fusion activation by an ubiquitous host protease. future work is still needed to fully characterise the fusion mechanisms affected by these mutations."}
