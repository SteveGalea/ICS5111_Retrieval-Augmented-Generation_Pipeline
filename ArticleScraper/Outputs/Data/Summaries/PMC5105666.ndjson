{"summary": "gB, gD, gH, and gL are present in all herpesviruses. entry is initiated by binding of a virus to an appropriate receptor on the surface of the host cell. gB, gH, and gL are present in all herpesviruses. gH/gL does not resemble a viral fusion protein and regulates the fusogenic activity of gB. the four HSV-1 glycoproteins essential for entry are also sufficient for cell-cell fusion when coexpressed in transfected cells in presence of a gD receptor. but whether they are sufficient for viral entry is unknown. BHK (a gift from J. White [University of Virginia]), 293T (a gift from J. M. Coffin [Tufts University]) and B78H1 (a gift from R. J. Eisenberg and G. H. Cohen [University of Pennsylvania]) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 250 g/ml of Geneticin. all cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. mouse anti-HSV-1 gB monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) SS10 and SS55 were gifts of H. Browne and R. J. Eisenberg. mouse anti-HSV-1 gH/gL MAb LP11 was a gift of H. Browne. virions were isolated from the supernatant by pelleting through a 20% sucrose cushion at 100,000 g in an SW28 rotor. resuspended in 10% sucrose in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl (HN buffer) band purified and concentrated by band purification using a 20 to 60% step gradient at 40,000 g for 12 to 16 h. the recombinant virus expresses ICP8 with C-terminal GFP in the Kos1.1 background (25). Western blot analysis was used to confirm the presence of specific VSV and HSV-1 proteins in virions. VSVG-BHLD, VSVG-G, and HSV-1 KOS8GFP were added equally to both cell types and visualized 16 to 24 h later by microscopy. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) the medium was replaced 2 h later and the cells were incubated overnight before visualization by fluorescence microscopy. in PBS was prepared by autoclaving 58% (wt/wt) solution of PEG 6000. cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at 1 105 cells/well. the medium was replaced with cold DMEM containing 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. 29 cells (25) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 400 g/ml of Geneticin. all cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. pCMV-VSVG was provided by J. white. VSVG-G encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP) instead of VSV-G. cells were washed 3 times using phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium (PBS++) and incubated in DMEM containing 5% FBS for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were infected with VSVG-G at an MOI of 3 to 5 IU/cell for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in serum-free DMEM. supernatants were cleared by two rounds of centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and stored at 80\u00b0C until further purification. gB MAb SS10 diluted 1:20, rabbit anti-mouse secondary PAb diluted 1:100, and protein A conjugated to 5-nm gold particles. Labeled samples were stained using 1% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) solution, pH 7.4. VSVG-BHLD and VSVG-G were preincubated with anti-VSV-G (8G5F11) at 1 g/ml. SS55 (anti-gB) in ascites fluid was used at a 1:100 dilution. the percentage of GFP-positive cells was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. VSVG virions can be pseudotyped with a glycoprotein of interest through transcomplementation. cells are transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the glycoprotein gene. VSVG-G is pseudotyped with the native fusogen G. no VSV-G was detected in VSVG-gB preparations. virions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by gelCode blue staining (A) or by Western blotting (B) Molecular mass standards (kDa) are labeled on the left, and the proteins are labeled on the right. gB, gD, gH, and gL are sufficient for cell-cell fusion. 293T cells were cotransfected with four plasmids and then infected with the VSVG-G helper virus. gL binds Coomassie stain poorly even in purified gH/gL preparations. Virions pseudotyped with the HSV-1 glycoproteins gB, gD, gH, and gL (VSVG-BHLD) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by gelCode blue staining (A) or by Western blotting (B and C) VSVG-BHLD virions were purified from 293T cells. VSVG-BHLD virions entered C10 cells efficiently as judged by GFP expression. entry was dependent on the presence of a gD receptor because the virions were unable to infect the parental B78H1 cells. entry of VSVG-BHLD virions, like that of HSV-1, requires a gD receptor. entry of VSVG-BHLD virions is blocked by neutralizing antibodies. antibodies also reduce fusion of cells transiently expressing the four entry glycoproteins. both SS55 and LP11 reduced entry of VSVG-BHLD virions. VSVG-BHLD, VSVG-G, or HSV-1 KOS8GFP virions were incubated with antibodies anti-gH/gL MAb LP11, anti-VSV-G MAb 8G5F11, or anti-gB MAb SS55. cells were fixed in 4% PFA-PBS, and GFP expression was quantified using FACS. each experiment was performed in triplicate and normalized to no-antibody controls. VSVG-BHLD virions require gB, gH/gL, and gD. each of the four HSV-1 entry glycoproteins, gB, gH/gL, and gD, are required for entry into the C10 cells. western blotting was used to confirm the presence of gH. VSVG-BHLD virions require gB, gH/gL, and gD for entry into C10 cells. virions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by gelCode blue staining. Molecular mass standards (kDa) are labeled on the left, and proteins are labeled on the right. gB, gD, gH, and gL are necessary for entry of VSVG-BHLD virions. the increase in infectivity of VSVG-BHLD virions in the presence of PEG is probably due to PEG-forced entry of particles that are normally incapable of entry. the presence of HSV-1 gB in VSVG-gB preparations was verified by Western blotting with anti-gB PAb R68 (Fig. 1B) no VSV-G was detected in VSVG-gB preparations, even at a high exposure (data not shown) gB alone is insufficient for cell-cell fusion (23), so it was not surprising that VSVG-gB virions were unable to enter cells. in contrast, cells cotransfected with HSV-1 gB, gD, gH, and gL undergo robust fusion with cells bearing gD receptors. gL binds Coomassie stain poorly even in purified gH/gL preparations. gL is present in purified VSVG-BHLD virions despite low signal from the R137 blot. gL is present in purified VSVG-BHLD virions despite low signal. VSVG-BHLD virions entered C10 cells efficiently as judged by GFP expression. entry was dependent on the presence of a gD receptor because the virions were unable to infect the parental B78H1 cells. entry of VSVG-BHLD virions, like that of HSV-1, requires a gD receptor. B78H1 cells lack any known gD receptors, while C10 cells derived from B78H1 stably express gD receptor nectin-1. entry of VSVG-BHLD virions is blocked by neutralizing antibodies. antibodies against HSV-1 entry glycoproteins inhibit entry of VSVG-BHLD virions. VSVG-BHLD infection is blocked by anti-HSV-1 antibodies. both gB and gH/gL are required for entry of VSVG-BHLD virions. cells were fixed in 4% PFA-PBS, and GFP expression was quantified. ectodomain to synthetic lipid vesicles (37), and its binding site (37) is located in the vicinity of the fusion loops. SS55 could thus inhibit entry and fusion by interfering with the gB fusion loop insertion into membrane. VSVG-BHLD virions require gB, gH/gL, and gD. VSVG-BHLD virions require gB, gH/gL, and gD for entry into C10 cells. the anti-gH/gL PAb R137 reacts poorly with gL. gL is not expressed on the cell surface (33) or incorporated into HSV-1 virions. only VSVG-BHLD virions were capable of infecting C10 cells. this is the first time the VSVG pseudotyping system has been extended beyond two proteins. the VSVG-BHLD virions successfully infected a gD receptor-bearing cell line. it is well known that the four HSV-1 entry glycoproteins mediate fusion of cells transiently expressing these proteins. the process of viral entry into a cell differs from cell-cell fusion in several regards. mutations in herpesvirus entry glycoproteins have been shown to have distinct effects on viral entry versus cell-cell fusion. entry of VSVG-BHLD virions required the presence of gD receptor on the target cells and was sensitive to inhibition by neutralizing antibodies against gB or gH/gL. the roles of these so-called nonessential glycoproteins have not yet been fully elucidated. but some of these may play important roles during viral entry into specific cell types (8)."}
