{"summary": "the 36 chest radiographs were obtained at 32 to 230 days with a median follow-up of 43 days. follow-up chest radiographs were normal in 23 out of 36 (64%) patients. patients with lung fibrosis had significantly greater number of ICU admission days (19 8.7 days; P value = 0.001), older age (50.6 12.6 years; P value = 0.02), higher chest radiographic scores, chest radiographic deterioration patterns and peak lactate dehydrogenase levels were noted in the patients with lung fibrosis. Survivors of ARDS have a clinically significant reduction in health-related quality of life. this may have important clinical implications for understanding the sequelae of the disease and contribute to the future management of affected patients. chest radiographic findings and computed tomographic findings of 36 out of 55 patients obtained during the active phase of the infection have previously been published. the current study focused on retrospective analysis of follow-up chest radiographic findings of the 36 patients after they had recovered from MERS-CoV. a third reviewer (S.G.L., with 40 years of experience) served as the arbitrator and made the final decision. a dedicated radiology picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstation was used for the evaluation of the chest radiographs from our study population. a hilar lymphadenopathy was considered to be present when there was an increase in the size and opacity of the hilum with a lobulated hilar contour and obscuration of the interlobular artery. if any other thoracic abnormalities not included in the aforementioned categories were detected on follow-up chest radiographs, the reviewers were instructed to record them. type 1 disease progression represents initial radiographic deterioration followed by improvement. at least two radiographic peaks separated by a period of mild remission. type 4 progression is defined as progressive radiographic deterioration. the treatment protocol for non-ICU patients suspected of having MERS-CoV was empiric treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) until screening for respiratory viruses excluded influenza A and H1N1. the same patient management policy was followed, but the choice of antibiotics was broader. thoracic radiologists with 20 (K.M.D) and 8 (K.D.) years of experience of interpreting chest radiographs independently reviewed all chest radiographs which had been randomized prior to the evaluation process. the reviewers reached a decision on the final interpretation by consensus. reticular opacity (i.e., fibrosis) was defined as linear opacities forming a mesh-like pattern. follow-up chest radiographs were also evaluated for presence of pleural thickening, effusion, or pneumothorax. the chest radiographic score of MERS-CoV infection can be obtained by dividing each lung into three zones and evaluating the levels of involvement in each zone. the scores for all six zones per chest radiograph are added together to yield a cumulative chest radiographic score ranging from 0 to 24, depending upon the involvement of the lung parenchyma. results study cohort There were no significant gender differences between the two groups (p = 0.41) group 2 patients with evidence of lung fibrosis were significantly older (p = 0.02) than group 1 patients and had a significantly greater number of ICU admission days (p = 0.001) the right upper lobe in three (8%) patients, left lower lobe in three (8%) patients, right middle lobe in two (5.5%) patients and lingula in two (5.5%) patients. the remaining lung fibrosis involved multiple zones in two (5.5%) patients. the remaining lung fibrosis involved multiple zones in two (5.5%) patients. a follow-up frontal chest radiograph obtained at day 230 shows bilateral multiple irregular reticular lines of fibrosis. a 24-year-old female with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), serial radiographs showing bilateral ill-defined ground-glass opacities. a frontal chest radiograph obtained at day 168 shows bilateral multiple irregular reticular lines of fibrosis along with obscured lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm and costo-phrenic angle in the same side due to pleural thickening. no other additional thoracic abnormalities were observed on follow-up chest radiographs in our study population. the mean SD, median and range of lung fibrosis development of 12 patients were 82.4 66 days 44 days, and 32\u2013230 days respectively. follow-up chest radiographs were normal in 23 of 36 (64%) patients. abnormal chest radiographic findings were detected in 13/36 patients. a 58-year-old male with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), serial radiographs showing irregular reticular lines of fibrosis. a follow-up frontal chest radiograph obtained at day 5 shows ground-glass opacities in the right lower and left mid zones. the rest of the lung is completely free of any irregular reticular lines of fibrosis. follow-up frontal chest radiograph obtained at day 19 shows bilateral sub-pleural ground-glass opacities with occasional air space consolidations. a 24-year-old female with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), serial radiographs showing ground-glass opacities. pleural thickening was seen in two patients and it was located in the right lower and left lower lobes. the association of lung fibrosis was highest (67%) in the Type 2 radiographic deterioration pattern, followed by the Type 3 (25%, P = 0.01) radiographic deterioration pattern. the peak lactate dehydrogenase level was also higher in group 2 than in group 1. the normal range of lactate dehydrogenase level at our institution is 121\u2013214 U/L. the incidence of lung fibrosis seen in our study population is higher than the rate (10%) of lung fibrosis seen in patients who recovered from swine influenza pneumonia. however, the incidence (33%) of lung fibrosis seen in patients who recovered from MERS-CoV is similar to the incidence (38%) of lung fibrosis detected in patients who recovered from SARS. lung fibrosis develops in patients who recovered from MERS-CoV. the exact triggers which initiate the lung fibrotic process remain unknown. if infection plays a causal role in the process of pulmonary fibrosis, therapeutic strategies may be effective in modifying the course of this dreadful condition. a future study focusing on follow-up CT findings in patients who recovered from MERS-CoV would be valuable in this regard. a future study focusing on a long-term follow-up would be helpful for understanding the full spectrum of the sequelae of this new lung infection. financial support and sponsorship Nil.
