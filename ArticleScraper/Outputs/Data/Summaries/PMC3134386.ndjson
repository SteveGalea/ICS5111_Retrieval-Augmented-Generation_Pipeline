{"summary": "smallpox was one of the most deadly diseases in human history with a mortality rate of up to 50%. vaccinia virus played an essential role as an effective vaccine in inducing protective immunity against smallpox. the fear of variola virus being deliberately released in potential bioterrorism attacks and the increasing use of vaccinia as vaccine vectors for other diseases such as AIDS have led to more recent studies aimed at understanding the protective immune responses induced by the smallpox vaccine. vaccinia vaccine vaccinia Tiantan (VTT) was propagated in vero cells and then purified by repeated freezing and thawing and centrifugation through a 36% sucrose cushion. a plaque-forming assay was titrated on vero cells by a plaque-forming assay using crystal violet staining. each group of nine mice was inoculated with an optimal dose of 106 PFU VTT through one of four different routes. another group of nine mice received a placebo as controls. each subgroup of three mice was divided into three subgroups. serum dilution factor is a serum dilution factor that achieves 50% of viral inhibition. an IC50 value is a serum dilution factor that achieves 50% of viral inhibition. for each experiment, pooled sera were subjected to the assay. the titer of viral neutralization was determined by calculating the percent reduction of infected cells showing GFP positive expression. an IC50 value is a serum dilution factor that achieves 50% of viral inhibition. MVTT-S is an attenuated VTT variant which is not lethal in mice. a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay was applied to determine the humoral immune responses against the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. a modified VTT that contains a GFP (MVTT-GFP) expression cassette was constructed. a flow-cytometry-based assay was used to test the serum neutralization activity against VTT. the titer of viral neutralization was determined by calculating the percent reduction of infected cells showing GFP positive expression. four groups of mice were inoculated with an optimal dose of 106 PFU VTT via s.c, i.m., i.n., and i.o. routes. another group received a placebo as controls. the animals were tested for the production of anti-VTT Nabs. rum samples were tested three weeks after the VTT vaccination. pooled sera contain an equal amount of serum of each vaccinated mouse. the X-axis represents the serum dilution factor whereas the Y-axis indicates the percentage of viral inhibition. the average IC50 value of mucosal groups (i.n. and i.o.) is about 4.4-fold higher than that of i.m. and s.c routes (1 : 2331 versus 1 : 529, P.01) randomly selected individualmiceof each group were tested with consistent results obtained. ten groups of vaccinated mice were challenged with MVTT-S six months after the vaccination. each mouse received 2 106 PFU of MVTT-S, the highest possible dose based on our viral stocks, via the i.n. or i.o. routes, respectively, which mimic the natural transmission of the variola virus. i.o. and i.n. VTT vaccinations protected mice completely against heterologous routes of i.n. and i.o. MVTT-S challenges. MVTT-S challenges resulted in high levels of anti-S Nabs in VTT-nave or nonvaccinated mice after the second challenge. the less protection of s.c. vaccinated mice is related to lower levels of anti-VTT neutralizing antibodies induced. MVTT-S causes transient viremia and infection in mice as we recently described [19] our efforts to detect live challenge virus around three weeks after each challenge in all groups were unsuccessful. serum samples collected three weeks after the second MVTT-S challenge were tested in this experiment. pooled sera contain an equal amount of serum of each vaccinated mouse in each group. the X-axis represents the serum dilution factor whereas the Y-axis indicated the percentage of viral inhibition. i.m. (1 : 3288, 1 : 2065, and 1 : 4555, with an average of 1 : 3303), and i.n. (1 : 5249, 1 : 5141, and 1 : 4937, with an average of 1 : 5109), and i.o. (1 : 4742, 1 : 6838, 1 : 2601, with an average of 1 : 4727), respectively. pooled sera contain an equal amount of serum of each vaccinated mouse. the X-axis represents the serum dilution factor. the Y-axis indicates the percentage of viral inhibition. the experiment was repeated twice with similar results obtained. higher levels of Nabs were induced via the i.n. and i.o. inoculations. serum dilution factors based on the IC50 value were 1 : 711, 1 : 2370, 1 : 428, and 1 : 32. the i.o. group developed higher levels of antivaccinia Nabs compared to the early time point. the i.o. group developed higher levels of lasting antivaccinia Nabs. the i.o. group developed higher levels of lasting antivaccinia Nabs compared to the early time point. ten groups of vaccinated mice were challenged with MVTT-S six months after the vaccination. the values of anti-S IC50 are in bold whereas the values of anti-VTT IC50 are not. each mouse received 2 106 PFU of MVTT-S, the highest possible dose based on our viral stocks. pooled sera contains an equal amount of serum of each vaccinated mouse. the X-axis represents the serum dilution factor. the Y-axis indicated the percentage of viral inhibition. the experiment was repeated twice with similar results obtained. we speculated that at least partial significant protection was achieved by the s.c. VTT vaccination. this value was determined by comparing the anti-S mean value of the s.c. vaccinated group versus control group (1 : 14261, 1 : 8251, and 1 : 21523, with an average value of 1 : 14678) i.m., i.n., and i.o. vaccination conferred partial significant protection against MVTT-S challenges. serum dilution factors based on IC50 value via different routes of prevaccination were 1 : 14261 > 1 : 9369, 1 : 936, or 1 : 2732 respectively. the first MVTT-S challenge boosted the levels of anti-VTT Nabs significantly. the average serum dilution factor of antivaccinia Nabs among i.m., i.n., and i.o. pre-VTT-vaccinated mice had reached comparable levels with IC50 values of 1 : 3303, 1 : 5109, and 1 : 4727, respectively. this P value was calculated from the average values of anti-VTT Nabs recalled anti-VTT Nabs were sufficient to block completely the mucosal (i.n. and i.o.) but not the systemic (i.m.) MVTT-S challenges. serum samples collected three weeks after each of the two MVTT-S challenges were included in this experiment. the i.n. and i.o. vaccination protected animals completely from two consecutive mucosal challenges of the MVTT-S strain via either homologous (i.n. and i.o.) or heterologous (i.o. and i.n.) routes. as controls, s.c. VTT vaccination did not achieve full protection against i.m., i.n., or i.o. MVTT-S challenges. antigen can be retained in the draining lymph nodes for extended periods of time. we did not conduct a direct comparison between intradermal (i.d.) vaccination with other routes because i.d. vaccination did not induce high levels of Nabs in previous studies. traditional VV challenge models involved the use of highly pathogenic and lethal dose viruses for challenges, which require special biosafety containments. mucosal VTT vaccination elicited protection against homologous and heterologous routes of mucosal MVTT-S challenges. findings are relevant to smallpox prevention because vaccination likely provided a protective barrier at the dominant portal of variola viral entry, in the mucosa. i.n. or i.o. MVTT-S challenges overcame preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through s.c. VTT vaccination for inducing anti-S Nabs. i.n. or i.o. MVTT-S challenges overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through s.c. VTT vaccination. the mucosal route of vaccination may also be crucial for the generation of highly protective T-cell-mediated immunity. a study demonstrated that protection against lethal respiratory vaccinia challenge requires both respiratory mucosal TEM cells and central memory T cells."}
