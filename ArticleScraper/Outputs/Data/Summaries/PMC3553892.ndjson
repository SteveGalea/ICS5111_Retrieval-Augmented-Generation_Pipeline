{"summary": "4-month-old male cat presented with lethargy, amaurosis, pyrexia, pneumonia, and seizures. hematology analysis revealed neutrophilia with hypersegmented neutrophils and lymphopenia. cat was humanely euthanized due severe clinical manifestations. tissue lesions were characteristic of severe, diffuse, nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis associated with chromatolysis of neurons, satellitosis, and gliosis with perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, mainly lymphocytes. the endothelium of affected blood vessels was swollen, with prominent mononuclear perivascular cuffing (HE) gene partial sequences were obtained from all positive samples. TK gene partial sequences were obtained from all positive samples. each sequence was aligned with homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous s from neuroinvasive herpesviruses retrieved from GenBank with CLUSTAL/W in Bioedit 7.0.9.0 (4). a phylogenetic tree for the nucleotide sequences was generated with the neighbor-joining distance algorithm. a 99.5% nucleotide identity and 100% amino acid identity among sequences determined in the present study. aqueous humor and effusion cells were concentrated at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the total RNA was extracted from the supernatants of organs and pellets. aqueous humor and effusion cells were concentrated at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the cat was not infected with rabies virus. the infection causes mainly upper respiratory tract and ocular disease in cats worldwide. the infection is followed by fever, depression, and anorexia. equid herpesvirus 1 has been associated with a higher amplitude and longer duration of viremia. other neuroinvasive herpesviruses are associated with life-threatening diseases in humans. this is the first report of nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis caused by FHV-1."}
