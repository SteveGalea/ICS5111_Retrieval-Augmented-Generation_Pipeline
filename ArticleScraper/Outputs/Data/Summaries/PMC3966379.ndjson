{"summary": "dromedary camel serum samples were systematically sampled in the surrounding area in 2003 (collection 4, n = 151) and in 2013 (collections 1A, 1B, 2, and 3; n = 500) the total number of camels in that area was 360,000 in 2010 (22) animals in collection 1B were born and raised at the Dubai Central Veterinary Research Laboratory. goat anti-llama fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013labeled antibody was used. dilutions of 1:20 and 1:40 were also tested for negative serum samples. at 37\u00b0C with a 50 L virus\u2013serum mixture. assays were terminated by fixation with 8% paraformaldehyde. dilutions were defined as serum dilutions reducing cytopathic effects in 2 parallel wells. all serum samples obtained during 2003 and 2013 were stored at 80\u00b0C until further analysis. 16 serum samples from bactrianus camels in zoologic gardens in germany included in the study. serum samples were used at dilutions of 1:20\u20131:5,120. secondary detection was conducted by using goat anti-llama fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013labeled IgG (1:200 dilution; Agrisera, V\u00e4nnas, Sweden). all neutralization tests were performed in a 96-well format. the 11 camel serum samples were titrated in a 2-fold dilution series. the reactivity pattern of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S) was compared against that of the human CoV-OC43 spike protein (OC43-S) 35 3,921 1,726 640 40 \u2013 5 >10,240 320 65,535 7,247 2,306 >5,120 2,560 160 6 5,120 640 65,535 5,069 2,098 2,560 640 160 7 >10,240 160 65,535 7,179 2,198 >5,120 640 40 8 5,120 320 65,535 55,826 2,412. serum samples tested against overexpressed MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S), overexpressed human coV-OC43 spike protein (OC43-S) and vero cells infected with MERS-CoV (MERS-V) fluorescence intensities were evaluated as follows: \u2013, negative; +, weakly reactive; ++, reactive; +++, strongly reactive. the use of whole virus provides additional structural and nonstructural protein antigens, including envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and diverse replicase proteins. cross-reactivity was possible with this assay (15) in the tested panel of camel serum samples, vIFA titers corresponded well to titers determined by rIFA. a total of 89.0%\u2013100.0% of serum samples in 4 collections showed positive results. all 667 camel serum samples from the united arab Emirates and Germany were initially screened at dilutions of 1:80. a total of 89.0%\u2013100.0% of serum samples in 4 collections showed positive results. 177 175 (98.9) 24 (13.6) 74 (41.8) 79 (44.6) 1B 2013 2/M, F A, J Animals raised at CVRL 5 0 5 (100.0) 0 0 2 2013 2/M, F 2\u20138 y Racing camels 100 89 (89.0) 55 (55.0) 3 (3.0) 42 (42.0) 3 2013 2/M. serum samples had neutralizing titers 640. a total of 19.2% (23/120) of MERS-CoV\u2013neutralizing serum samples had concomitant neutralizing activities against BCoV. a total of 24.2% (94/389) had concomitant neutralizing activities against BCoV. cDNA fragments of 182 nt and 404 nt identified sequences 99% identical with BCoV strain Mebus. amplicons from both animals were 97% identical at nucleotide level with BCoV strain Mebus. antibodies were detected in serum samples obtained in 2013 and in serum samples obtained >10 years earlier. dromedarius camels should be less susceptible than dromedarius camels to MERS-CoV. differences in antibody prevalence might reflect restricted geographic distribution of the virus. this corresponds to previous finding of relatively lower prevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV in camels from the canary islands. human coVs 229E and NL63, which form 2 closely related sister taxa, do not show cross-neutralization and concordantly form 2 different species by genetic criteria. final confirmation will depend on the identification of virus sequences in camelids. potential sources include bats of the family Vespertilionidae, in which a virus with a close phylogenetic relationship with MERS-CoV has been detected. a recent investigation of civet cats in china identified viruses with close relationships to the bona fide ancestor of SARS-CoV. viruses from civet cats were still more closely related to human SARS-CoV than even the closest bat-borne virus. if camelids should function as intermediary hosts in a similar manner, we should expect a virus in camelids that has a closer phylogenetic relationship with any bat-borne CoV."}
