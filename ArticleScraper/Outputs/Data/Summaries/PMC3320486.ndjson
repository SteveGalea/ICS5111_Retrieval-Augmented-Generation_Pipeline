{"summary": "samples were tested for influenza virus A and B; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4; and adenovirus by direct or indirect immunofluorescence or virus isolation. samples were also tested for human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, and HCoV 229E and OC43 by virus isolation and RT-PCR. the first RT-PCR assay was a 1-step simple RT-PCR that amplified a 255-bp fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of HCoV-NL63 by using the following primers. the second assay was a 1-step multiplex RT-PCR that amplified the same 255-bp fragment of the N gene of HCoV-NL63. each RT-PCR test included water controls that were treated identically to the virus samples throughout and was performed with usual precautions to avoid contamination. RT-PCR products were subject to electrophoresis on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. the comparative analytical sensitivities of these simple and multiplex RT-PCR assays were previously studied on prototype strains by analyzing serial 10-fold dilutions of positive control for RT-PCR products were purified by using exoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA) the nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene were compared with the 2 prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences available in GenBank (NL63-Amsterdam1: NC005831 and NL: AY518894). the age distribution of the patients infected by HCoV-NL63 was identical to the age distribution of the sample. positive specimens were collected throughout the study period; no epidemic was observed. more than one third of patients infected by HCoV-NL63 had severe lower respiratory tract infection (6 bronchiolitis and 1 pneumonia) all of them recovered completely. phylogenetic analysis shows that the isolates from France are a divergent group containing sequences with different markers. of the 4 novel agents, HMPV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and CoV-HKU1, identified recently, 3 were coronaviruses (1,3,7\u20139) the potential to infect other species has been described for bovine coronavirus and is suspected to have caused the SARS outbreak (10,11) multiplex RT-PCR simultaneously detected the classical human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63) we detected 1 co-infection by HCoVs NL63 and OC43 and 3 HCoV-OC43\u2013positive samples. a cross-protective immune response could explain why these 2 human coronaviruses do not circulate at same time. human coronaviruses, except SARS-CoV, generally cause disease much like the common cold. they have also been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions, especially in frail patients (4,16) no clear evidence exists that human coronaviruses, except SARS-CoV, cause enteric illness. HCoVs NL63, 229E, and OC43 that we developed is a useful tool to facilitate the routine detection of these pathogens. this project was supported by the European Commission EPISARS contract (No. SP22-CT-2004-511063) and the Programme de Recherche en R\u00e9seaux Franco-Chinois (\u00e9pid\u00e9mie du SRAS: de l'\u00e9mergence au contr\u00f4le)."}
