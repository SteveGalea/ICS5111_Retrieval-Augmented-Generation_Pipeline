{"summary": "the etiologic agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) it can infect chickens at all ages and replicate in many tissues. it can infect chickens at all ages and replicate in many tissues. antigen capture enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (AcELISA) can be used for antigen detection of clinical samples. specific MAb against Taiwan IBV strain 2575/98 showed specificity to Taiwan IBV strains but had no cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain H120. the MAb was used to establish a type-specific blocking ELISA to detect Taiwan IBV infection effectively. the MAbs against S1 would be useful in developing an antigen-capture ELISA test for antigen detection or a competitive ELISA test for antibody detection for IB in poultry. the other ten strains from five different genotypes were selected for cross-reaction analysis. mouse myeloma SP20 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. preparation of whole viral antigen of IBV IBV Sczy3 strain was propagated in 9- to 11-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. recombinant plasmid was sequenced by the T4 DNA ligase (Takara Biotechnology) the recombinant plasmid was sequenced by PCR and restriction enzyme (RE) digestion. the recombinant plasmid was sequenced by Shanghai Sang-gong Biological Engineering Technology & Services (Shanghai, China) the pooled fraction containing the recombinant proteins was successively dialyzed against PBS with 6 M urea, 4 M urea, 2 M urea, and 0 M urea. each concentration was dialyzed for 6 h. each of the concentrations was dialyzed for 6 h. hybridoma culture supernatants of primary clones were screened by whole viral antigen-based indirect ELISA. hybridoma cells from wells with a positive signal were further subcloned by limiting dilution for at least three rounds and screened by indirect ELISA. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 100 L/wells of purified whole viral antigen. the color reaction was developed by adding 100 L/well of ready-to-use substrate (Sigma) the plates were kept in the dark at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of 50 L/well of 2 M H2SO4 to stop the reaction. the wells with OD greater than the cut-off value were considered positive for the presence of anti-IBV antibodies. anti-S1 MAbs were coated in 96-well plates with 1 g/well overnight at 4\u00b0C. whole viral antigen of Sczy3, uninfected allantoic fluid and BSA was coated in the same conditions as the positive, negative and blank control. the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS for 2 h. monolayers of primary CEK cells were prepared from the kidneys of 18-day-old chicken embryos. the kidney cells were dispersed with 0.25% Trypsin, washed three times, and seeded in 24-well plates. cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. anti-S1 MAbs, equal volumes of 100 TCID50 of 20th generations of Sczy3 and serial 2-fold dilutions of purified anti-S1 MAbs were mixed and kept at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 0.2 mL of the virus-antibody mix and 0.2 mL of DMEM with 2% FBS were then transferred into CEK cell cultures. mouse myeloma SP20 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the allantonic fluids of inoculated eggs were harvested after 48 h incubation and the virus particles were further purified using differential velocity centrifugation. the amplified S1 gene was ligated with the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a (+) by the T4 DNA ligase (Takara Biotechnology) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cell. expression, purification, and identification of recombinant plasmid was achieved by PCR and restriction enzyme (RE digestion) the suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. the supernatant was then loaded into hisTrap FF crude Columns. the pooled fraction containing the recombinant proteins was dialyzed against PBS with 6 M urea, 4 M urea, 2 M urea, and 0 M urea. boosters of 0.15 g purified whole viral antigen virus in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) in total volume of 200 L were administered. seven days later, the mice received a final booster immunization with 0.05 g purified virus. three days later, the splenocytes were collected from immunized mice. one hundred L of culture supernatant from each well of the hybridoma plate were transferred to a corresponding well in the ELISA plate. after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the color reaction was developed by adding 100 L/well of ready-to-use 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma); the plates were kept in the dark at room temperature for 15 min followed by 50 L/well of 2 M H2SO the ascites fluids were collected when the mice were on the verge of death. the ascitic fluid containing the MAbs was purified by protein L Resin. the isotype of purified anti-S1 MAbs were determined by antigen-mediated ELISA using a mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagents kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. dilution of allantonic fluid containing IBV-Sczy3 strain was inoculated into CEK monolayer cells to cultivate the cell-adapted strain. monolayers of primary CEK cells were prepared from the kidneys of 18-day-old chicken embryos. the cells were dispersed with Trypsin, washed three times, and seeded in 24-well plates. dilution of the cell-adapted stock virus that causes CPE in half of the cultures was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. equal volumes of 100 TCID50 of the 20th generations of Sczy3 and serial 2-fold dilutions of purified anti-S1 MAbs were mixed and kept at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 0.2 mL of the virus-antibody mix and 0.2 mL of DMEM with 2% FBS were then transferred the size of the recombinant fusion protein was estimated to be approximately 46.0 kDa including the amino acids in the vector. western blot (A) and SDS-PAGE (B) analysis of recombinant fusion protein pET-S1 and His protein were separated with 12% polyacrylamide. Isotyping analysis showed that MAbs 1C8 and 2C10 were both of IgM isotype. Specificity analysis showed that both MAbs 1C8 and 2C10 did not react with NDV or AIV subtypes H9 and H5. cross-reaction analysis showed that both MAbs 1C8 and 2C10 could react with other 10 IBVs classified into five genotypes. 2C10 and 2C10 were 1:2.82 and 2C10 respectively. CEK cells maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 14 h. CEK cells were infected with 20th generation of Sczy3 at 37\u00b0C. the virus strain Sczy3 used in the present study was isolated in 2009 from a broiler in sichuan province. it was classified to QX genotype, and it was the prevalent genotype in sichuan province and worldwide. these MAbs were group-specific and could be used for diagnostic assays against IBVs. they also provide new material for immunotherapy of IB and identification of linear neutralization epitopes on S1 protein."}
