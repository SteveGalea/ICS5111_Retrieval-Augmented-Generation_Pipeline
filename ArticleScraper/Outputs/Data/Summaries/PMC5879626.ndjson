{"summary": "co-infecting parasite species can interact with one another, potentially altering both within-host infection dynamics [1\u20133] and between-host transmission. changes in infection dynamics within hosts can alter host disease severity and/or duration [8,11,12] despite the important consequences of co-infection, the potential interactions among parasites are rarely considered in either clinical settings or during the design of infection control programmes. in a previous study of the parasite community of wild rabbits, we described a range of interspecific interactions, including the interaction between two gut nematodes. we infer what the immune interaction of each parasite group will be with its host, and hence the likely immune relationship between the groups, based on a known example of a co-infection interaction. this is the first empirical attempt to predict the consequences of a hitherto untested interspecific interaction using data from different host and parasite species. not all parasitic nematodes are equal in the immune responses that they stimulate, or that affect them [15,16]. this is, to our knowledge, the first empirical attempt to predict the consequences of a hitherto untested interspecific interaction. trichostrongylus spp. browses on intestinal mucosa and bacteria and shows limited invasion and penetration into host tissues. nematodes tend to produce shorter-lived infections than those of blood-feeding species, being more rapidly and effectively controlled by the host. faecal samples were analysed using a modified McMaster technique. animals were then treated with a mixture of Abamectin and Praziquantel, Levamisole and Benzimidazole. animals were blood-sampled via jugular venepuncture to provide a baseline immune and health status measure. contortus and/or 1500 larvae of T. colubriformis were given doses as an additive dose. differential dosing was used because of the different size and pathogenicity of the two helminth species. animals were kept on raised slatted floors to prevent self-reinfection. ed to determine the total number of worms of each species infecting each animal. samples of abomasal and jejunal tissues (4 cm2 squares) were fixed in Bouin's solution. hypobiosis does not occur in the strain of T. colubriformis. previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were conducted on the abomasal and jejunal measures of immune responses in the abomasum and jejunum. one animal was removed from each group prior to the 6-week sample point due to ill health unrelated to the helminth infections. all scores were treated as numeric data and scaling was applied. the measures of the abomasal immune responses were compared between the H. contortus mono- and co-infection groups. treatment group, time of sampling and their interaction were the explanatory variables. faecal samples were analysed using a modified McMaster technique. animals were blood-sampled via jugular venepuncture to provide a pre-infection baseline immune and health status measure. animals were then assigned to one of four treatment groups using a stratified random assignment. animals in the co-infected and mono-infected groups were each infected twice weekly for 10 weeks with 300 larvae of H. contortus and/or 1500 larvae of T. colubriformis. differential dosing was used because of the different size and pathogenicity of the two helminth species, T. colubriformis. the number of worms in subsamples was then counted to determine the total number of worms of each species infecting each animal. samples of abomasal and jejunal tissues (4 cm2 squares) were fixed in Bouin's solution for later histological analysis. the concentration of IgG1 antibodies against H. contortus and against T. colubriformis L3 antigens was determined using previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. one animal was removed from the control group prior to infection due to ill health, leaving a sample size of 39 sheep for each of these two groups. the abomasal and jejunal measures of immune responses were compared. the measures of the abomasal immune responses were compared between the H. contortus mono- and co-infection groups. the measures of the jejunal immune responses were compared between the co-infection groups. cor-infection affects Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus. there were more adult T. colubriformis worms in co-infected sheep than in T. colubriformis-only infections. the predicted number of (a) T. colubriformis adult worms by time post-initial infection and infection group and (b) H. contortus hypobiosed larvae by infection group. the arrow represents the last day of larval dosing and the grey arrow represents the first day by which the last larval dose may have reached adulthood. co-infection affects host cellular immune responses Trichostrongylus colubriformis infects the jejunum. all immune measures positively loaded onto PC axis 1 (PC1). PC1 was subsequently used in the GLM analysis and transformed. abomasel immune measures loaded positively onto PC1 explaining 62% of the variance. PC1 was subsequently used in the GLM analysis and transformed. the results shown in the figures are back-transformed. jejunal immune responses shown as bootstrapped number of eosinophils, goblet cells, globule leucocytes and score of goblet cells with granules. treatment groups offset by 1 day to aid visualization. error bars are the 95% confidence intervals. co-infection affects Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus. there were more adult T. colubriformis worms in co-infected sheep. a total of 30 000 infective larvae were given to each sheep. haemonchus contortus was also affected by co-infection, but differently compared with T. colubriformis. the number of adult H. contortus arrested larvae in co-infections was not affected. the predicted PC1 values in the co-infected animals were significantly lower than in the T. colubriformis-only infection group. this means that the jejunal immune response induced by T. colubriformis was suppressed in co-infected animals. all abomasel immune measures loaded positively onto PC1 explaining 62% of the variance (electronic supplementary material, S8). PC1 was subsequently used in the GLM analysis and transformed (Ln(PC1 + 3) resulting in a normal distribution of the model residuals. treatment groups offset by 1 day to aid visualization. grey squares represent T. colubriformis mono-infection, solid black circles H. contortus mono-infection and crossed diamonds co-infection. the concentration of anti-H. contortus IgG1 was significantly different. the presence of H. contortus resulted in comparatively more T. colubriformis adult worms in co-infected sheep. this is consistent with previous studies that have shown the anti-T. colubriformis immune response acts first against incoming larvae. fewer arrested larvae in co-infected animals demonstrate co-infection still has a negative effect on H. contortus (figure 2). in natural infections, arrested larvae resume development to adulthood during periods of host stress. the loss of H. contortus arrested larvae appears to be immune-mediated. the host immune response to T. colubriformis and H. contortus in mono-infections is well documented. our hypothesis for the interaction between the sheep nematodes was based on data from a different host and different parasite species. despite extensive prior study of these parasites in sheep, the interactions we correctly predicted had never previously been hypothesized. this suggests that our predictive framework is neither host nor parasite species-specific. there is less information available to support the grouping of mucosal-browsing nematodes. the only immune function studies conducted appear to be on T. colubriformis and T. retortaeformis. it will be interesting to determine whether other members of the group also stimulate and are controlled by a classic Th2 response. production losses owing to T. colubriformis are likely to be greater in sheep co-infected with H. contortus. transmission of T. colubriformis could be substantially higher owing to the higher worm burdens and prolonged infection in such co-infections. the current study offers an alternative mechanism for classification by using taxonomy and more easily identified parasitological traits, to act as a proxy for the immune traits. we have demonstrated that we can successfully use these traits to predict the immunologically based interaction of two parasite groups. this work therefore proposes a general framework for predicting the relationships between other parasite groups. authors' contributions J.L. devised and managed the project, conducted the statistical analyses and in conjunction with M.E.V. wrote the manuscript. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
