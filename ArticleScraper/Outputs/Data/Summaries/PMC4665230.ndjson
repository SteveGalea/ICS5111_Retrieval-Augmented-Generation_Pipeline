{"summary": "we recently developed and characterized models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection based on well-differentiated pediatric primary airway epithelial cells derived from pediatric bronchial (WD-PBECs) or nasal (WD-PNECs) brushings (1, 2). the mechanisms by which RSV causes disease and is capable of repeated infections in humans remain an enigma. IFN-s induce antiviral states by signaling through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL-28R and IL-10RA. this activates signal transduction through the Jak/STAT pathway in a manner virtually identical to IFN-/. this activates signal transduction through the Jak/STAT pathway in a manner virtually identical to IFN-/. we found that RSV-induced IL-29 secretion from WD-PBECs reflected IL-29 secretions in lower airway samples from RSV-infected infants. these RSV-induced secreted factors also demonstrated prophylactic antiviral activity against RSV, although with lower potency than against SeV. cassette consisting of the eGFP ORF-NS1 gene end signal-NS1 gene start signal into an antigenomic cDNA (D53) of RSV at the position of the NS1 ATG. the eGFP containing D53 was then used to recover recombinant RSV in BSR-T7 cells as described previously (20, 24, 25) the production of recombinant RSV expressing eGFP in place of NS1 and NS2 cultures were incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the last rinse was retained as the 2-h virus titration point. every 24 h thereafter, apical rinses and basal medium were collected to determine virus growth kinetics and IFN responses. the mouse anti-Mx and pSTAT1 (pY701) MAbs were detected with Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Invitrogen, 1:500) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were detected with Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) conditioned medium experiments were performed by transferring basal medium from mock (CMCON)-infected or RSV-infected WD-PBEC cultures incubated with (CMRSV+IL-29) or without (CMRSV) neutralizing antibody against IL-29. fresh WD-PBECs or vero cells were treated before or after infection with IFN-1/IL-29 (Peprotech, United Kingdom) all RSV-infected infants were confirmed as having mono-infections by using a multiplex virus reverse transcriptase-PCR strip for 12 respiratory viruses. data obtained in vitro are presented as means the standard errors of the mean (SEM), and skewed data were log transformed before comparisons were made using the Student paired t test or GraphPad Prism 5.0. rA2-eGFP and rA2-NS1/2-eGFP stock production and titrations were performed in vero cells. the rescue, characterization, stock production, and titration of rSeV/eGFP were previously described. WD-PBECs were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cultures were permeabilized with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 (vol/vol) for 2 h. cultures were blocked with 0.4% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. fluorescence was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. IL-29 (IFN-1), pan-IFN-, and IFN- concentrations in WD-PBEC basal media were measured using human IFN-1 ELISA kits. fresh WD-PBECs or Vero cells were treated before or after infection with IFN-1/IL-29 (Peprotech, united Kingdom) antiviral effects were determined by measuring eGFP fluorescence and/or virus growth kinetics. the data from RSV-infected and control children were compared using a Mann-Whitney t test and GraphPad Prism 5.0. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS RSV infection induces an antiviral state in WD-PBECs. WD-PBECs (n = 3 donors) were mock infected or infected with rSeV/eGFP. at 72 hpi, RSV- and mock-infected cultures were superinfected with rSeV/eGFP (MOI 0.1) eGFP expression was quantified every 24 h by measuring the percentage of green pixels in three different microscope fields. IL-29 concentrations in basolateral medium from RSV-infected WD-PBECs were significantly increased compared to controls. IL-28A concentrations in basolateral medium from WD-PBECs were significantly increased compared to controls. mock-infected cultures harvested at 24 and 96 hpi were measured. values are means the SEM. **, P 0.01. secreted factors, including IL-29, are implicated in the RSV-induced antiviral state. hpi, the basal medium of mock (CMCON)- or RSV-infected cultures incubated with (CMRSV+IL-29) or without (CMRSV) neutralizing antibody against IL-29 (10 g/ml) was transferred into the basal compartment of fresh cultures from the same individual donor. twenty-four hours later, the cultures were infected with rSeV/eGFP (MOI 0.1) rSeV/eGFP growth kinetics were significantly reduced following pretreatment with both IL-29 doses. these reductions, even at the higher dose, were lower than those evident after CMRSV pretreatment. WD-PBECs were pretreated with IL-29 (100 or 1,000 pg/ml) or mock treated. eGFP expression was quantified every 24 hpi. CMCON and CMRSV were transferred to uninfected cultures. at 72 hpi, the basal medium of mock (CMCON)- or RSV-infected cultures was transferred into the basal compartment of fresh cultures from the same individual donor. twenty-four hours later, the cultures were infected with rA2-eGFP (MOI 0.1) WD-PBECS (n = 3 donors) were infected with RSV BT2a at an MOI of 0.01. at 2 or 24 hpi, infected cultures were treated with IL-29 (100 ng/ml) the virus growth kinetics presented in panels C and D were determined by titrating RSV in apical washes every 24 h after infection. NS proteins antagonize IL-29-mediated antiviral effects in WD-PBECs. the relative resistance of RSV to IL-29 suggested efficient antagonism in WD-PBECs. pretreatment with 1 ng of IL-29/ml had no effect on rA2-eGFP replication. rA2-NS1/2-eGFP does not infect WD-PBECs efficiently. rA2-eGFP does not infect WD-PBECs efficiently. a surrogate for virus replication kinetics was quantified by measuring the percentage of eGFP coverage of three to five microscope fields at each time point. the data are represented as means the SEM eGFP area (percentage of the whole image) pSTAT1 fluorescence intensities were similar in both infected and noninfected cells. pSTAT2 protein was significantly diminished, while the MxA/B proteins were virtually absent in RSV-infected compared to surrounding noninfected cells. antagonism of the RSV-induced antiviral responses was restricted to infected cells. WD-PBECs were either mock- or RSV-infected (MOI 0.1) for 96 h. cultures were fixed and stained for either MxA/B (A), pSTAT1 (C) or pSTAT2 (E) WD-PBECs (n = 3 donors) were mock infected or infected with rSeV/eGFP (MOI 0.1) after 72 h, the cultures were superinfected with rSeV/eGFP (MOI 0.1) after 72 h, the cultures were superinfected with rSeV/eGFP (MOI 0.1) IFN-1/IL-29 is the predominant IFN following RSV infection in vivo and in vitro. previous work from us and others reported little or no IFN-/ secretion. IL-29 was evident after RSV infection of primary airway epithelial cells in vitro. type III IFN, but not type I IFN, is detected after RSV infection in vivo and in vitro. lower airway samples from infants hospitalized for severe RSV infection were analyzed for pan-IFN- (A), IFN- (B), IL-29 (C), or IL-28A (D) by ELISA. the data are presented as means the SEM. eGFP expression and rSeV/eGFP growth kinetics indicated factors secreted from RSV BT2a-infected WD-PBECs were responsible, in part, for the antiviral effects. eGFP expression was quantified every 24 h by measuring percentage of green pixels in five random microscopic fields. IL-29 attenuates rSeV/eGFP replication in WD-PBECs. WD-PBECs (n = 2 to 3 donors) were pretreated with 100 or 1,000 pg of IL-29/ml. rSeV/eGFP growth kinetics were significantly reduced following pretreatment with both IL-29 doses. eGFP expression was quantified every 24 hpi by measuring the percentage of green pixels in three random microscopic fields. eGFP expression was quantified every 24 hpi by measuring the percentage of green pixels in three random microscopic fields. WD-PBECs (n = 2 to 3 donors) were infected with RSV BT2a (MOI 4) or mock infected. twenty-four hours later, the cultures were infected with rA2-eGFP (MOI 0.1) pretreatment with 100 ng of IL-29/ml significantly reduced RSV replication. IL-29 did not demonstrate therapeutic potential against RSV. NS proteins antagonize IL-29-mediated antiviral effects. rA2-NS1/2-eGFP grew efficiently in WD-PBECs. replication of NS1 and/or NS2 was virtually abrogated. this result precluded the use of WD-PBECs to address antagonism. rA2-eGFP or rA2-NS1/2-eGFP titers at 96 hpi were measured. the data are presented as means the SEM log10TCID50/ml. IL-29 treatment or CMRSV treatment induced MxA/B expression in WD-PBECs. however, when CMRSV was pretreated with anti-IL-29, MxA/B expression was virtually abrogated, demonstrating that MxA/B induction following CMRSV treatment was in large part mediated by IL-29. WD-PBECs were either mock infected, RSV BT2a infected (MOI 0.1) for 96 h. cultures were fixed and stained for MxA/B (red), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) ocal images show typical staining from WD-PBECs derived from three different individual donors. fluorescence was quantified by dividing the raw integrated density by the area of >120 individual cells. DISCUSSION Innate immune responses are critical first lines of defense against virus infection. s, particularly IL-29, but not IFN-/, were detected in WD-PBECs. a major finding of our study is the preponderance of IL-29 and the absence of detectable IFN-/ in lower airway samples from RSV-infected infants. the lack of detectable IFN-/ in CMRSV is consistent with earlier clinical observations. antagonists were deleted, the paramyxovirus PIV5 failed to activate the IFN- promoter, suggesting that members of the Paramyxoviridae are very inefficient at inducing IFN-/ responses. the corollary is that the antagonistic capacities of these viruses likely evolved to cope with IFN-s, rather than IFN-/, responses. we found no evidence that IL-29 has therapeutic potential against RSV. however, we present evidence that IL-29 has prophylactic potential against RSV. this is of particular interest for individuals at risk for severe illness due to RSV infection. a primary infection with RSV would result in the induction of an antiviral state in the airway epithelium that may greatly compromise the capacity of subsequent viruses to infect and replicate. this is consistent with a recent study showing that infection with multiple respiratory viruses correlated with less severe disease (52)."}
