{"summary": "the most recent document, Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Respiratory Disease, was published in 1986 (1). the date of publication of the most recent document was roughly 3 years after Kary Mullis\u2019 initial work on PCR technology. since then, the practice of clinical microbiology has significantly changed, mostnotably with the development of molecular approaches that have increasingly replaced traditional methods for diagnosis of respiratory viruses. nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), nasal swabs (NS), nasal washes (NW), oropharyngeal and throat swabs (OPS/TS), sputa, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, bronchoalveolar washes (BAW), and other lower respiratory tract specimens are covered. current document the document discusses the diagnosis and characterization of emerging respiratory viral pathogens. it also discusses the diagnosis and characterization of emerging respiratory viral pathogens. the document is an ASM-sponsored Practical Guidance for Clinical Microbiology. this consensus document is structured to cover a wide range of practice settings. the document outlines the epidemiology and clinical impact of acute respiratory viral infections. the current document focuses strictly on viruses that cause acute respiratory infections, related syndromes, or disease processes. the primary focus of this document is pathogens with well-documented causal effects for acute respiratory infections. influenza A virus (FLUA), influenza B virus (FLUB), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) A and B, respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), rhinoviruses (RVs), respiratory adenoviruses (ADVs), human metapneumovirus (PIVs) 1 to 4 and coronaviruses (CoVs) acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are among the most common infections reported worldwide. lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) accounted for more than 90% of all DALYs. transmission via fomites from self-inoculation of the respiratory tract mucosa is the second most common route of infection. large (10 to 100 m in diameter) aerosolized droplets can transmit viruses from the index case to a new host in close proximity (0.9 m) small (10 m in diameter) aerosolized droplets can carry viral particles to new hosts several meters away (1.8 m) dsDNA No Yes (11) 14\u201330 days (18) Contact, droplet (11, 335) Coronaviruses Coronaviridae (333, 334) Linear, nonsegmented (+) ssRNA Yes (11) 1 h\u201328 days (18, 336) Airborne, contact, droplet, standardd (11, 337) Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses Picornaviridae (333, 334) Linear, nonsegmented (+) ss d Isolation precautions vary by coronavirus type; the listed precautions are specific to SARS-CoV. changes in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase may impact transmission of influenza viruses. close contact in living environments facilitate transmission to the elderly. acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to these viruses is indistinguishable from illness due to bacteria on the basis of clinical presentation alone. in many cases, acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to these viruses is indistinguishable from illness due to bacteria on the basis of clinical presentation alone. multiplex NAAT-based assays are available for hMPV detection. ia EV-D68 is associated with severe respiratory illness outbreaks in the u.s. (2014). many panels cannot distinguish between EV and RV or detect all types of EV. PIVs 1\u20134 Bronchiolitis, bronchitis, common cold, laryngitis, otitis media, pharyngitis, pneumonia PIV 1 and PIV 3 are the most common types causing bronchitis. multiplex NAAT-based assays are available for RSV, and some of them provide subgroup information on RSVA and -B Bronchiolitis. in infants, the immune system is still developing. lack of complete immune memory, reduced innate and adaptive immunity, and physiological differences in airways compared to those in adults increase susceptibility to viral infections and disease severity. infection with RSV has been attributed to a decrease in memory CD8+ T-cell function (44, 45) immunosuppressed patients with profound and prolonged reduction in T-cell immunity are at increased risk for severe disease from viral infection (46, 47) genetic polymorphisms of innate immune effectors, such as TLR-4, are associated with increased susceptibility to severe respiratory viral infection. the one health concept works to improve the health of humans and nonhuman animals while ensuring the protection of the natural environment. clinicians and laboratorians should remain aware of the potential impact of one health human-animal interfaces. recent examples include human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with camel exposure (83), swine variants of FLUA (84), pandemic FLU (pdm09), avian FLUA (e.g., clinicians and laboratorians should have a firm understanding of respiratory viruses. understanding the circulation patterns of viruses will influence the predictive value of respiratory virus testing. a complicated global viral circulation pattern shows that some viruses maintain consistent seasonality. respiratory infections (ARIs) are among the most common infections reported worldwide. lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) accounted for more than 90% of all DALYs. respiratory virus (e.g., FLUA) transmission may also be enhanced under specific environmental conditions, such as low temperature and low humidity (19\u201321) it is important for laboratorians and clinicians to be aware of likely transmission routes used by respiratory viruses. c Isolation precautions can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/guidelines/isolation-guidelines.pdf. changes in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase may impact transmission of influenza viruses. children attending day care are at increased risk for respiratory infections (all etiologies), especially at the start of entry into day care (27), and can be a potential source of RSV infection for premature infants. there is significant overlap in clinical symptoms associated with the different viruses causing respiratory illnesses. multiplex NAAT-based assays include EV are available for hMPV detection. hMPV Bronchiolitis, bronchitis, common cold, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia hMPV infection is associated with a substantial burden of hospitalizations and outpatient visits. multiplex NAAT-based assays are available for RV detection. ryngitis, pneumonia The leading pathogen causing common cold and the most common viral cause (8%) of pneumonia in adults in the u.s. new tab a Abbreviations: ADV, adenovirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; EV, enterovirus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; FLU, influenza virus; PIV, parainfluenza virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; NAAT, nucleic acid amplification test. the host response to viral infections relies on elements of both the innate immunity and the adaptive immunity. in older adults, increased susceptibility to viral infections, age-dependent vaccine effectiveness and more severe disease have been attributed to waning innate and adaptive immunity. in older adults, increased susceptibility to viral infections, age-dependent vaccine effectiveness (43) and more severe disease have been attributed to waning innate and adaptive immunity. most acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) affect sites in the upper respiratory tract, including the larynx, nasal cavities, nasopharynx, oropharynx, throat, sinuses, conjunctiva, and inner ear. LRTIs affect deeper structures below the larynx, including the trachea, bronchus, and bronchoalveolar site. respiratory infections (ARIs) are among the most common infections reported worldwide. lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) accounted for more than 90% of all DALYs, with approximately 35% of cases occurring in children less than 5 years old. transmission via fomites from self-inoculation of the respiratory tract mucosa is the second most common route of infection (17) nonenveloped viruses are more likely to cause infection via direct contact. nonenveloped viruses are more likely to cause infection via direct contact, as they are more stable in the environment than enveloped viruses. c Isolation precautions can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/guidelines/isolation-guidelines.pdf. the listed precautions are specific to SARS-CoV. children attending day care are at increased risk for respiratory infections (all etiologies) and can be a potential source of RSV infection for premature infants. there is significant overlap in clinical symptoms associated with the different viruses causing

complete immune memory, reduced innate and adaptive immunity, and physiological differences in airways compared to those in adults (35) increase the susceptibility to viral infections and disease severity. most acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) affect sites in the upper respiratory tract, including the larynx, nasal cavities, nasopharynx, oropharynx, throat, sinuses, conjunctiva, and inner ear. urTIs affect deeper structures below the larynx, including the trachea, bronchus, and bronchoalveolar site. phagocytosis of viruses result in production of several proinflammatory molecules, including interleukin-1, IL-18, defensins, collectins, type I interferons alpha/beta, and immunoglobulin A. the lack of complete immune memory, reduced innate and adaptive immunity, and physiological differences in airways compared to those in adults increase the susceptibility to viral infections and disease severity. infection with RSV has been attributed to a decrease in memory CD8+ T-cell function (44, 45) immunosuppressed patients with profound and prolonged reduction in T-cell immunity are at increased risk for severe disease from viral infection (46, 47) genetic polymorphisms of innate immune effectors, such as TLR-4, are associated with increased susceptibility to severe respiratory viral infection (48, 49) clinicians and laboratorians should remain aware of the potential impact of one health human-animal interfaces to allow for the emergence of new human respiratory viral pathogens. recent examples include human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with camel exposure (83), swine variants of FLUA (84), pandemic FLU (pdm09), avian FLUA (e.g., H7N9) (85), and severe acute respiratory syndrome infectious diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published consensus guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in 2007. in the guidelines, they outline specific microbiological testing recommendations and discuss how to take an appropriate travel history to support the diagnosis of pneumonia. the IDSA and the pediatric infectious diseases Society published combined guidelines for the management of CAP in infants and children older than three months. testing for respiratory viral infections with a rapid, highly sensitive, and specific assay is recommended. antiviral therapy should be started as early as possible in children with moderate to severe CAP when FLU is circulating. with febrile respiratory symptoms (regardless of onset date) and immunocompetent and immunocompromised hospitalized patients with fever and respiratory symptoms. the IDSA \u201cClinical Practice Guideline for Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis in children and adults\u201d provides guidance on clinical presentations to identify patients with viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis (97). the American Society for Transplantation Infectious Diseases guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ADV in solid organ transplant patients were published in 2013 (100) the guidelines emphasize that pediatric patients had the highest incidence of ADV infection, at 6.25%, which carried an organ-specific risk level (liver > heart > kidney) disseminated disease (involvement of two or more organs) was associated with subgroups A (serotype 31), B2 (serotypes 11, 34, and 35), C (serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6), and F (serotype 40). detection of ADV is not necessarily indicative of a disease process cause by ADV. patients at risk from

FLU. providers should (104) perform testing only if results will change clinical management, (ii) understand the limited sensitivity and false-negative rates of rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs), (iii) consider NAAT if clinical suspicion is moderate to high, and (iv) consider empirical antiviral therapy. the u.s. CDC guidelines outline the steps taken to define and investigate a respiratory outbreak of unknown origin (105). Detection and characterization of the pathogen are key steps allowing for effective clinical management, infection prevention and control practices, and defining the time period of the outbreak. the most recent version of the MERS-CoV biosafety guideline was released as 'Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). activities appropriate for BSL-2 facilities using standard BSL-2 practices included molecular testing of extracted nucleic acid and final packing of specimens for transport to diagnostic laboratories. u (H7N9) virus released by the CDC (111), and updated for novel FLU strains (116). specimens should be collected as early as possible after symptom onset (ideally within 7 days) laboratory testing may play a more important role in the management of severely ill patients and the immunocompromised and less of a role in the management of immunocompetent adults and children. laboratory testing may help in supporting public health investigations (e.g., emerging pathogen investigations and outbreak investigations, and infection control functions. the IDSA and the pediatric infectious diseases Society published combined guidelines for the management of CAP in infants and children older than three months. testing for respiratory viral infections with a rapid, highly sensitive, and specific assay is not routinely required in this population. the group suggested that treatment not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. the IDSA \u201cClinical Practice Guideline for Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis in children and adults\u201d provides guidance on clinical presentations to identify patients with viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis (97). bacterial rhinosinusitis is defined as any of the following (i) >10 days of symptoms without improvement and with onset of high fever (102\u00b0F [39\u00b0C], (ii) high fever with purulent nasal discharge or facial pain during the first 3 to 4 days the ATS guidelines outline specific microbiological testing recommendations and discuss how to take an appropriate travel history to support the diagnosis of pneumonia. the document identifies respiratory viruses as an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in outpatients and inpatients. no recommendations were provided for the use of antivirals against PIVs, ADVs, hMPVs, or CoVs in pediatric CAP. the IDSA released guidelines on the diagnosis, institutional outbreak management, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment of FLU in adults and children. the guidelines recommend testing for common respiratory viral infections with nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, or aspirates. use of multiplexed NAAT improves the diagnostic capacity by testing for a variety of targets. the diagnosis and management of ADV in solid organ transplant patients was published in 2013 (100) the guidelines emphasize that pediatric patients had the highest incidence of ADV infection, at 6.25%, which carried an organ-specific risk level. 10.5% of those with self-limited viremia after transplant later developed ADV-associated respiratory symptoms within the first year. the American Society for Transplantation Infectious Diseases guidelines indicate that NAAT on a blood sample may be used successfully to monitor therapy. ribavirin should not be routinely used to treat ADV infections even though some subtype C viruses may respond to ribavirin treatment (100). guidelines from the Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia addressed the diagnosis and treatment of RSV, PIVs, hMPV, RVs, and CoVs in patients with leukemia and those undergoing HSC transplants. the group had several recommendations regarding diagnosis of upper and lower tract community-acquired respiratory viruses. NAAT is recommended over antigen detection or culture as the test of choice for identifying these viruses. for patients with lower tract infection or critical illness, expanded testing for hMPV and ADV (and potentially other rare causes of lower tract disease [e.g., RVs and CoVs] is suggested. the PGCM document recommends the application of rapid tests to support treatment decisions, bed management, and implementation of infection prevention and control measures (e.g., barrier precautions, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccination) the authors of this document emphasize that the test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values) should be taken into account. a wide variety of respiratory specimens may also be collected. the majority of activities for identification via NAAT can be done in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facility in a biosafety cabinet (BSC) using enhanced precautions. lower respiratory tract specimens included BAL fluid, tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, and sputum. upper and lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected within 7 days of symptom onset. nasopharyngeal aspirates could be combined in same transport container. the American Society for Transplantation Infectious Diseases guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ADV in solid organ transplant patients were published in 2013 (100) the guidelines emphasize that pediatric patients had the highest incidence of ADV infection, at 6.25%, which carried an organ-specific risk level (liver > heart > kidney) disseminated disease (involvement of two or more organs) was associated with subgroups A (serotype 31), B2 (serotypes 11, 34, and 35), C (serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6), and F (serotype 40). detection of ADV is not necessarily indicative of a disease process cause by ADV. patients at risk from respiratory virus infection (FLU, RSV, hMPV, and PIVs) at all transplant stages from preengraftment to late phase. no recommendations were made for use of palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV prevention in HSC recipients 4 years of age. treatment and decisions for deferral of chemotherapy or HSC transplant. evidence to support use of first-line or routine diagnostic tests for FLU, RSV, and PIV. ribavirin alone was recommended for patients with PIV infection. in 2016, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine approved a clinical practice paper for the vaccination, diagnosis, and treatment of FLU. providers should (104) perform testing only if results will change clinical management, (ii) understand the limited sensitivity and false-negative rates of rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs), (iii) consider NAAT if clinical suspicion is moderate to high, and (iv) consider empirical antiviral therapy. the u.s. CDC guidelines outline the steps taken to define and investigate a respiratory outbreak of unknown origin (105). Detection and characterization of the pathogen are key steps allowing for effective clinical management, infection prevention and control practices, and defining the time period of the outbreak. the most recent version of the MERS-CoV biosafety guideline was released as 'Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). activities appropriate for BSL-2 facilities using standard BSL-2 practices included molecular testing of extracted nucleic acid and final packing of specimens for transport to diagnostic laboratories. u (H7N9) virus were released by the CDC (111), and these were later updated for novel FLU strains (116). Specimens should be collected as early as possible after symptom onset (ideally within 7 days) lower respiratory tract specimens included BAL fluid, tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, and sputum. upper and lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected within 7 days of symptom onset. nasopharyngeal aspirates could be combined in same transport container. positive predictive value for laboratory-confirmed influenza in returning travelers can vary widely depending on the seasonality of infection and method of detection. patients who should be tested for FLU infection include (i) symptomatic hospitalized patients, (ii) cases where diagnosis of FLU will affect patient management and (iii) cases where FLU testing would affect infection prevention and control or management of close contacts. the lack of prompt identification of risk factors in patients presenting to the ED allowed spread between patients and staff at several hospitals. early identification and upfront screening procedures could have isolated the index patient and reduced the number of contacts, thus limiting the spread of infection (121). this is consistent with mathematical modeling showing that rapid identification of index cases is the most important factor in reducing spread of infection. NAAT is the most sensitive method of detection, and sampling as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms is considered ideal for healthy individuals. a delay in specimen collection following onset of respiratory symptoms will negatively impact the sensitivity of laboratory tests to detect a pathogen. the presence of comorbidities can significantly alter viral shedding times. the presence of comorbidities can alter the duration of shedding. the strain of virus or subtype or coinfection with different viruses can also influence shedding patterns. analysis of historical data is confounded by growing evidence that infection prevention and control practices for respiratory viruses may not be uniformly followed. the need for N95 masks can be controversial, and local infection prevention and control procedures should be followed to minimize aerosolization and risk of health care worker infection. a collection of multiple different types may be necessary to identify specimens that most reliably result in detection of the pathogen. other, atypical specimens such as blood or stool may also be suggested for collection (156\u2013158). the literature describing their efficacy in detection is variable (372\u2013374) b +++, specimen type has high detection rates for the indicated virus. ++, specimen type is acceptable for viral detection, but sensitivity may be reduced due to the sampling or testing method used for detection. lower respiratory samples are additionally recommended for enhanced detection. sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage/wash, and lung tissue may be considered. lower respiratory tract specimen types vary in their ability to detect specific viral etiologies. sputum may be considered an appropriate specimen for sampling the lower respiratory tract in some patients. for respiratory viruses are not validated by the manufacturer for sputum or other lower respiratory tract samples. sterile saline should be placed in a sterile container with a small amount of sterile saline to keep it moist. procedural variability for specimen collection makes comparison of the performances of these off-label specimens difficult. sample collection from the upper respiratory tract may be easiest. but upper tract sampling may not detect viruses causing lower tract disease. clinicians should ask about travel history and animal exposure that could be consistent with acquisition of an emerging pathogen. NAAT is the most sensitive method of detection, and sampling as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms is considered ideal for healthy individuals. most viral targets can be effectively identified in the first 2 days after symptom onset, and a delay in specimen collection following onset of respiratory symptoms will negatively impact the sensitivity of laboratory tests. some preliminary studies propose a 30-day period for ADV infection in children and for RV infection in infants as a definition of a single case. however, the temporal definition of a new viral infection should be assessed in the clinical context. the presence of comorbidities can significantly alter viral shedding times. bronchoscopy, sputum induction, endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, nebulizer treatment, airway suction, tracheostomy, chest physiotherapy, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation are currently unknown (142). a recent analysis of practices in multiple states found low practice adherence, with many health care workers unsure of when appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn. a combination of different specimen types can improve the sensitivity of NAATs (149\u2013155) but this must be balanced in such a way to maintain high detection rates. a collection of multiple different types may be necessary to identify specimens that most reliably result in detection of the pathogen. a combination of different specimen types can significantly increase the yield for viral detection. the literature describing their efficacy in detection is variable (372\u2013374) b +++, specimen type has high detection rates for the indicated virus. sensitivity may be reduced due to the sampling or testing method used for detection. use of a flocked swab with a liquid viral transport medium may additionally improve viral detection (161, 151, 155) flocked swabs may provide an alternative to proper nasopharyngeal specimens. lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage/wash may be considered in cases where the patient may be infected with an emerging pathogen (173, 174) sputum is a more difficult specimen type to use in the laboratory. specimen viscosity and higher rates of PCR inhibition make sputum a more difficult specimen type to use in the laboratory. most FDA-cleared assays for respiratory viruses are not validated by the manufacturer. shedding estimates can further direct best collection guidelines for respiratory specimens. differences may be due to differences in study designs, differences in specimen types, and differences in detection technologies between studies. a delay in specimen collection following onset of symptoms will negatively impact the sensitivity of laboratory tests to detect a pathogen. there are no standard \u201ccase definitions\u201d on how long positive respiratory virus results detected by NAAT should be considered part of the same infection event. some preliminary studies propose a 30-day period for ADV infection in children and for RV infection in infants as a definition of a single case. however, the temporal definition of a new viral infection should be assessed in the clinical context. the direct risk to health care workers who are collecting upper and lower respiratory tract specimens by different aerosol-generating procedural methods is currently unknown. the need for N95 masks can be controversial, and local infection prevention and control procedures should be followed to minimize aerosolization and risk of infection. selection of specimen type depends on patient age, patient willingness to undergo a specific procedure, clinical presentation, the nature of the potential pathogen, and the appropriateness of the specimen type. a collection of multiple different types (OPS, NS, NPS, BAL fluid, etc.) may be necessary to identify specimens that most reliably result in detection of the pathogen. specimen storage information provided by the laboratory should indicate storage temperature, retention time, and stability of the specimens. results for nasal specimens are not included in this table because the literature describing their efficacy in detection is variable (372\u2013374) the combination of an NS and an OPS in adults and children has a yield equivalent to that of NPS/NPA (10, 151, 155) use of a flocked swab with a liquid viral transport medium may additionally improve viral detection (161, 168, 169) flocked swabs may provide an alternative to proper nasopharyngeal specimens. sputum may be an appropriate specimen for sampling the lower respiratory tract in some patients (178\u2013180) but data are limited. most FDA-cleared assays for respiratory viruses are not validated by the manufacturer for sputum or other lower respiratory tract samples. samples should be collected as early as possible from patients following onset of illness. sample collection from upper respiratory tract may be easiest, but upper tract sampling may not detect viruses causing lower tract disease. cell culture was long considered the gold standard for virus isolation and identification prior to availability of molecular assays. culture approaches may inadvertently propagate emerging pathogens. but maintaining cell culture capabilities in public health laboratories remains important for identification of unknown or emerging pathogens. the quality of DFA/IFA assays is impacted by specimen quality and collection method (171). DFA/IFA technologies are labor-intensive, require a skilled technologist to read and interpret results, require a fluorescence microscope, and are subject to reader error. some argue that the lower sensitivity can identify \u201cclinically relevant infections\u201d in some patient populations.

Molecular target amplification assays are susceptible to false-positive results caused by contamination. false-positive results may occur at any step in sample collection and processing. a laboratory worker infected with a respiratory virus may act as a contaminating vector in the laboratory. open systems (where extraction, amplification, and/or detection stages are exposed to the environment) and closed systems (where extraction, amplification, and detection are completed within a single compartment not exposed to the environment) have different contamination control requirements. staff training protocols and laboratory standard operating procedures (SOPs) should emphasize the organization of workflow process. laboratorians should develop processes to monitor large-scale contamination. low-level contamination events may be identified as an excessive or unusual amount of low-level positive specimens. laboratorians should have a sense of the coinfection rates within their settings. the use of molecular approaches has traditionally been accompanied by higher supply costs than for antigen- or culture-based methods. modern molecular technologies provide improved performance characteristics compared to culture and/or culture-based methods. viral load samples taken on day 3 postonset may have a stronger association with clinical outcome than samples taken on day 0, 1, or 2 (246). the current laboratory-developed viral load assays have multiple problems, including lack of an international standard, lack of standardized technology, and lack of consensus on specimen types. the most appropriate patients to test may vary depending on the health care setting. many studies show questionable utility in testing adult outpatients for viruses other than FLU. in lung transplant patients, the detection of one or more viruses using a respiratory virus panel in a BAL fluid sample during the first year after transplant has also been associated with significantly faster development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (256). Intensive care unit (ICU) patients may be another appropriate patient population for respiratory viral multiplex panel testing. multiplex panels used as a routine test ordering choice can remove some of the confusion or indecision described by clinicians when ordering tests for small numbers of viral targets individually. however, given that these panels are expensive, demonstration that the results impact patient care help justify the increased cost to the laboratory. in patients 3 months to 21 years old, panel use has been associated with decreased length of stay. multiplexed respiratory virus panels may have significant costs for implementation. health care administrators need to be made aware of the indirect and direct benefits of panels. coinfections are defined as the detection of more than one virus in a patient specimen. coinfections of two or more viruses were identified in approximately 18% of infants with an acute respiratory illness. other viruses, such as RV, hMPV, and PIVs, were also codetected. the impact of mixed infection on patient outcomes is still under debate. detection of RSVA and FLUA had decreased sensitivity in panel tests compared to that with singleplex NAAT (279) also, detection of ADV in multiplex panels often has decreased sensitivity compared to that with in-house NAAT assays (280) of note, only respiratory species of ADV (B, C, and E) will be detected in multiplex panels. multiple assays are now emerging in the marketplace. users should consult up-to-date resources for a list of waived products. benefits include ease of use and reduced process steps compared to older molecular assays. this section focuses on Choosing Wisely and discusses (i) which testing options might be suitable to perform depending on needs, (ii) what laboratories can do when resources are limited, (iii) how the importance of preanalytics plays into the testing decision being made. the following sections describe key steps in ensuring that health care workers choose respiratory tests appropriately. results can include cost, TAT, infection prevention and control decisions, antibiotic administration, antiviral administration, inpatient LOS, rates of admission to the hospital, referrals, and ancillary testing (chest radiography or other laboratory testing) many institutions are implementing test algorithm changes in part due to evidence-based medicine and outcome data. clinicians may use subtyping data to place patients in cohorts in health care settings with low bed-to-patient ratios. many providers have historically relied on RADTs, culture, or direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) testing for the detection of respiratory viruses. laboratorian may reconsider test algorithms and use random-access test systems. some algorithms may improve cost-effectiveness by offering a less-expensive upfront singleplex assay for FLU or duplexed or triplexed assays, including FLU and RSV. however, algorithms will vary by institution, time of year, and prevalence of influenza. draft guidance documents surrounding LDT use were released by the FDA in 2014. as of 2016 to 2017, the FDA proposed a \"risk-based, phased-in approach\" the proposed framework would place each LDT into a specific risk class (305) the role of cell culture is limited Cell culture was long considered the gold standard for virus isolation and identification prior to the availability of molecular assays. cell culture has a lower sensitivity than molecular techniques (191, 192), the turnaround time and hands-on time required to perform cell culture are increased. cell culture approaches may inadvertently propagate emerging pathogens. however, maintaining cell culture capabilities in public health laboratories remains important for identification of unknown or emerging pathogens. commercial and standardized clinical reagents are available for select respiratory pathogens. DFA and IFA assays have significantly reduced sensitivity and specificity. some argue that the lower sensitivity can identify \"clinically relevant infections\" in some patient populations. 58\u201380

purchased until 12 January 2018 and used until the kit expiry date. manufacturers were expected to monitor kit reliability and provide updates to users. some assays are unable to differentiate between FLUA and FLUB. the first step in NAAT requires extraction, purification, and preservation of target organism nucleic acids. extraction technologies should be able to cleanly isolate both high-quality viral RNA and DNA and, depending on the assay, to additionally sample human nucleic acids to allow the detection of human genes. a validation plan should consider a variety of factors, including the frequency of specimen type being tested and the risk that specimen types may not be compatible with the assay. the requirement for verification of additional specimen types is outlined in the College of American Pathologists\u2019 Microbiology Checklist, Molecular Microbiology, MIC.64810. contamination may occur when specimen integrity is breached during the collection process or when integrity is breached during early handling processes in the laboratory. the greatest risk of contamination is from amplicons created (and possibly aerosolized) during previous molecular runs. assays that incorporate manual postamplification processing present the highest risk of contamination to the laboratory. laboratory standard operating procedures (SOPs) should emphasize the organization of workflow process (such as unidirectional flow, separate areas for pre- and postamplification processing, regular decontamination of work areas with bleach, strict adherence to use of aerosol resistant pipette tips. physical separation of workspaces dedicated to different assay steps (e.g., pre-PCR and post-PCR) can also decrease the risk of contamination (221) and is recommended for open systems, but it is not necessary for closed systems. laboratorians should have a sense of the coinfection rates within their settings. sporadic contamination events may be missed due to sampling bias. molecular assays for respiratory viruses also have excellent positive predictive values. the use of molecular approaches has traditionally been accompanied by higher supply costs than for antigen- or culture-based methods. modern molecular technologies provide improved performance characteristics compared to culture and/or culture-based methods. multiple extraction methods may be employed for respiratory virus detection. heat-mediated lysis is an approach where target organisms are lysed or homogenized to release target nucleic acids (216) this approach is used in some commercial NAATs. manual extraction using phase separation, capture via magnetic beads may also be used. internal amplification controls should be added to all specimens except in assays where inhibition rates of the NAAT have been shown to be below acceptable limits. commercial NAAT kits are designed to flag invalid results (when internal controls fail), but require manual checks and result review to detect invalid specimens. commercial assays using either real-time reporters or array-based detection are designed to minimize risks of amplicon contamination. multiple amplicon sterilization processes have been established to decrease the chance of amplicon carryover in molecular assays. laboratory practices to decrease contamination are either recommended or not required (217, 221\u2013223, 228) laboratorians should develop processes to monitor contamination events. low-level contamination events may be identified as an excessive or unusual amount of low-level positive specimens. sporadic contamination events may be missed due to sampling bias. some FDA-cleared assays have specific recommendations for environmental monitoring. sporadic contamination events may be missed due to sampling bias. negative effects on patient management have not been identified. positive effects on patient management include decreased patient isolation times (238), length of stay (239), administration of antibiotics and oseltamivir (240), and duration of antibiotic therapy (241). multiplexing of molecular assays was traditionally restricted by the number of targets that could be efficiently amplified within a single reaction vessel (247\u2013249). however, development of new technologies with improved multiplexing capabilities has allowed detection of multiple virus targets from a single sample (251\u2013253) oncology identified community-acquired respiratory virus infection as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in oncology patients 103. testing for FLU, RSV, PIV, and other prevalent community-circulating viruses in all oncology patients presenting with symptoms is suggested. transplant patients may also be an appropriate patient population for multiplex testing. panel testing may allow for identification of pathogens associated with specific risks in pediatric patients. this may include increased risks for asthma and wheezing in critically ill patients (259) or a lack of FEV1 improvement in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients (260). a variety of commercial and FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic tools are currently available. a significant decrease in the duration of antibiotic use and the number of chest radiographs was observed in an adult tertiary care center. outpatient outcomes were assessed at a Connecticut VA Center that used an on-demand respiratory panel. outpatients were divided into those with FLU detected, those with a non-FLU virus detected, and those with no pathogen detected. coinfections with bacteria and viruses were identified in 40% of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization (272). coinfections of two or more viruses were identified in approximately 18% of infants with an acute respiratory illness. tract infections is associated with increased length of stay (LOS) (275) in patients with ADV-RSV coinfections compared to RSV single-virus infections. a major drawback of commercially available molecular test panels is the inability to differentiate closely related viruses or to detect all targets with equivalent sensitivity. there is currently no practical gold standard to determine whether ADV detection in the respiratory tract is causal or incidental (284). the availability of newly developed CLIA-waived NAAT assays that detect FLUA/B or both FLUA/B and RSV is increasing. a recent review of POC testing, including NAAT, identifies several barriers to understanding the benefits of point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses. implementation of rapid nucleic acid testing could be associated with decrease in number of hospital admissions, length of stay, duration of antimicrobial use, droplet contact days, total isolation days, and receipt of antibiotics (238\u2013241). multiplexing of molecular assays was traditionally restricted by the number of targets that could be efficiently amplified within a single reaction vessel (247\u2013249). multiplexing of molecular assays was traditionally restricted by the number of targets that could be efficiently amplified. infectious viral etiologies were widely varied and included both single and mixed infections. testing for FLU, RSV, PIV, and other prevalent community-circulating viruses in all oncology patients presenting with symptoms is suggested. transplant patients may also be an appropriate patient population for multiplex testing. panel testing may allow for identification of pathogens associated with specific risks in pediatric patients. this may include increased risks for asthma and wheezing in

hospitalization (272) coinfections of two or more viruses were identified in approximately 18% of infants with an acute respiratory illness; RV was the most common coinfecting virus; other viruses, such as ADV, hMPV, and PIVs, were also codetected (270). an increased risk of life-threatening disease was identified in patients with ADV-RSV coinfections compared to RSV single-virus infections (274) in a secondary outcome analysis, FLU-RSV coinfections had an increase in LOS compared to RSV single-virus infections (274), while ADV coinfections were more likely to be associated with the need to treat with supplemental oxygen than were ADV single-virus infections (276). enterovirus D68 may require altered patient management compared to seasonal EV strains. detection of nonrespiratory ADV in the respiratory tract can precede systemic infection in immunocompromised children (283). there is currently no practical gold standard to determine whether ADV detection in the respiratory tract is causal or incidental (284). a recent review of POC testing identifies several barriers to understanding the benefits of point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses. implementation of rapid

both single and mixed infections. testing for FLU, RSV, PIV, and other prevalent community-circulating viruses in all oncology patients presenting with symptoms (103) is suggested. pneumonia has previously been used as a selection criterion in the absence of accurate hospital location data. panel testing may allow for identification of pathogens associated with specific risks in pediatric patients. this may include increased risks for asthma and wheezing in critically ill patients (259) or a lack of FEV1 improvement in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients (260). a significant decrease in the duration of antibiotic use and the number of chest radiographs was observed in an adult tertiary care center. outpatient outcomes were assessed at a Connecticut VA Center that used an on-demand respiratory panel. outpatients were divided into those with FLU detected, those with a non-FLU virus detected, and those with no pathogen detected. coinfections may make up a significant proportion of total viral cases within a population. coinfections with bacteria and viruses were identified in 40% of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. second virus in infants with lower respiratory tract infections is associated with increased length of stay (LOS) in another study, an increased risk of life-threatening disease (e.g., intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death) was identified in patients with ADV-RSV coinfections compared to RSV single-virus infections (274), while ADV coinfections were more likely to be associated with the need to treat with supplemental oxygen. enterovirus D68 may require altered patient management compared to seasonal EV strains. detection of nonrespiratory ADV in the respiratory tract can precede systemic infection in immunocompromised children (283). coinfections are defined as the detection of more than one virus in a patient specimen. coinfections of two or more viruses were identified in 18% of infants with an acute respiratory illness; RV was the most common coinfecting virus, but other viruses, such as ADV, hMPV, and PIVs, were also codetected. the impact of mixed infection on patient outcomes is still under debate. detection of RSVA and FLUA had decreased sensitivity in panel tests compared to that with singleplex NAAT (279) also, detection of ADV in multiplex panels often has decreased sensitivity compared to that with in-house NAAT assays (280) of note, only respiratory species of ADV (B, C, and E) will be detected in multiplex panels. multiple assays are emerging in the marketplace and may have similar test characteristics. users should consult up-to-date resources for a list of waived products. benefits include ease of use and reduced process steps compared to older molecular assays. the following sections describe key steps in ensuring that health care workers choose respiratory tests appropriately. to provide high-quality, cost-effective laboratory services, it is imperative to understand the clinical needs of the end users when considering solutions for detection of respiratory viruses. many institutions are implementing test algorithm changes due to evidence-based medicine and outcome data. a single solution might not work for all patient populations or specialties of care. a single solution might not work for all patient populations or specialties of care. clinicians may not voice concerns about lack of subtype information. subtyping matters only when circulating subtypes have different patterns of resistance to antiflu drugs. many providers have historically relied on RADTs, culture, or direct fluorescent-antibody testing for the detection of respiratory viruses. laboratorian may reconsider test algorithms and use a batched testing platform. some algorithms may improve cost-effectiveness by offering a less-expensive upfront singleplex assay for FLU or duplexed or triplexed assays. some algorithms may improve cost-effectiveness by offering a less-expensive upfront singleplex assay for FLU or duplexed or triplexed assays. primary care providers, characteristics of the patient population, clinical practice settings, required test turnaround time, availability and expertise of nonlaboratory staff to perform POC testing. the laboratory, along with infectious diseases physicians, should engage these providers to completely understand the provider/patient need. early engagement with the provider and operational stakeholders is paramount to successful test implementation. a single solution might not work for all patient populations or specialties of care. in choosing wisely, regardless of the test or the ability to be reimbursed, the emphasis should be on what the provider will do with the result and how implementation will impact the clinical outcome, the quality of care given to the patient. more recently, FDA-cleared and CLIA-waived NAATs with sensitivities and specificities have become available. complex multiplex PCR assays are often restricted to hospital settings and reserved for the most ill patients with associated comorbidities. laboratorians should work with clinical partners and manufacturers to establish risk-based algorithms which can be used to determine appropriateness of testing. a risk assessment approach to determine populations most effectively served by acute respiratory virus testing can be used to identify the level of test complexity for patients. proposed framework would place each LDT into a specific risk class. new methods such as rapid antigen detection techniques, DFA tests, and viral culture have been replaced by more rapid and sensitive NAAT assays. laboratorians should understand risks and benefits of using LDTs and potential regulations restricting their use. the number of antiviral agents with FDA approval is limited. the use of aerosolized ribavirin can pose health hazards to health care workers. the use of aerosolized ribavirin can pose health hazards to health care workers and is not easy to deliver to patients. adamantanes block the activity of the M2 protein (active only against FLUA) and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the only drugs that are effective for the prevention or treatment for influenza. two NA inhibitors, oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, are licensed in many countries. antiviral testing is not a routine test, and the time required to undertake such testing limits the clinical relevance of this testing in most patient populations. antiviral testing may be required for epidemiological studies as well as cases of failure in prophylaxis. the use of multiple agents to treat respiratory viral infections has been described. the only approved agent is ribavirin (in aerosolized form) the use of aerosolized ribavirin can pose health hazards to health care workers and is not easy to deliver to patients, making it a less-than-ideal treatment choice. the adamantanes block the activity of the M2 protein (active only against FLUA) and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the only drugs that are effective for the prevention or treatment for influenza. two NA inhibitors, oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, are licensed in many countries. antiviral testing is not a routine test, and the time required to undertake such testing limits the clinical relevance of this testing in most patient populations. one patient population that may benefit from this testing is patients who shed virus for long periods of time and do not improve after treatment. current procedural terminology (CPT) is a set of guidelines, codes, and descriptions used to elucidate and standardize services by health care professionals. the codes for microbiology and virology are established through the Pathology Coding Caucus (PCC) of the American Medical Association. crosswalking occurs when a new test is determined to be similar to multiple existing test codes, portions of an existing test code, or an existing test code. reimbursement compliance is a system in place to ensure that the testing being performed is medically relevant for the clinical situation. price reductions were to be implemented at 10% in each of the next 3 years, followed by a 15% reduction for the following 3 years, until the established weighted median price is hit. the status of these new fees was in question as of January 2018. laboratory-developed tests will still be required to compensate for testing gaps that often need to be filled quickly. effective communication between clinicians and the laboratory is still essential to quickly identify highly transmissible emerging pathogens."}
