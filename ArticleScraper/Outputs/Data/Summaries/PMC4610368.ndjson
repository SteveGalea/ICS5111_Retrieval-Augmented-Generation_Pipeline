{"summary": "CDC develops regulations and/or recommendations for the use of respiratory protection in health care settings. CDC develops recommendations for the use of respirators to reduce the spread of disease in health care settings. the most commonly used type of respirator in health care settings are NIOSH certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) the service life of all filters on NIOSH-approved respirators is limited by considerations of hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance. in workplaces that could produce high cumulative particulate filter loading, the service time for N95 FFRs should only be extended beyond 8 hr of use. ator models in the FDA database were cleared after 2005. the factors that a health care employer considers in formulating FFR use policies are also different from employers in industrial settings. despite this concern, FFRs are reused under certain conditions in health care. the first time extended use of FFRs was identified as an option was during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. both extended use and limited reuse of FFRs allow the employer to reduce its consumption of FFRs, prolonging existing supplies during a pandemic or respiratory pathogen outbreak or save money. key scientific and policy issues are highlighted along with considerations for policy makers to weigh when making decisions. most (22/31 = 71%) of the surgical N95 respirator models in the FDA database were cleared after 2005. the factors that a health care employer consider in formulating FFR use policies are also different from employers in industrial settings. the first time extended use of FFRs was identified as an option was during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. both extended use and limited reuse of FFRs allow the employer to reduce its consumption of FFRs, prolonging existing supplies during a pandemic or respiratory pathogen outbreak. key scientific and policy issues are highlighted along with considerations for policy makers to weigh when making decisions. specialized infection control guidance was published as either interim or final recommendations. this strategy provided a diversity of respiratory pathogens for analysis. these situations include two recent outbreaks/pandemics (2004 SARS and 2009 H1N1 flu), two routine situations (TB and seasonal influenza), and two pathogens of concern. a respirator classified as disposable can be reused by the same HCW as long as it remains functional. contact isolation precautions are only needed if extrapulmonary lesions are draining. contact transmission of TB is thought to be highly unlikely. shortages were reported during both the 2004 SARS outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. half of the hospital managers interviewed (n = 48) reported shortages of FFRs during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak due to increased demand and supplier lag time in filling orders. CDC also addressed concerns about a shortage of FFRs during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. extended use and reuse were largely based on the type of infection control precautions or transmission mode(s) associated with that pathogen. the institute of medicine (IOM) addressed (26) the reusability of facemasks. the IOM also identified key knowledge gaps that served as a catalyst for increasing awareness of the research needs. filter media Most N95 FFRs contain a polypropylene electret filtering medium within the layers of a FFR. the electret filtering medium has been shown to capture and retain a majority of airborne biological particles compared to the layers next to the face. recommended replacement life for electret filters in air cleaning systems is typically 3 months of normal use. only a few studies have been done to verify FFR performance in extended use or reuse type scenarios. 5 simulated donnings reported a reduction in the strap load for each successive donning. the majority of the reduction occurring after the first donning. the best levels of fit were observed for the first five donnings. infectious bioaerosols are hard to detect and differentiate from non-infectious bioaerosols. assuring compliance during all periods of exposure in the health care setting is challenging. researchers found that FFR use caused no or minimal increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and transcutaneous carbon dioxide. they also found that 2 hr of continuous FFR use at low-moderate work rate did not cause a change in core body temperature, and there was no significant increase in FFR deadspace heat or humidity after the first hour. 9 of 10 study participants (nurses) were willing to wear FFRs for the entirety of two full 12-hr shifts. the nurses tolerated FFR continuous wear for an average of 223 min on day 1 and 145 min on day 2 and experienced little physiological burden. however, discomfort increased with time, and the nurses reported feeling more short of breath the longer they wore respiratory protection. FFR extended use of greater than 4 consecutive hours is unlikely in most settings. it is often cited against allowing extended use and limited reuse. assessing the level of risk of self-inoculation associated with touching a used FFR is complex. in one study, influenza aerosol concentration, breathing rate of the wearer, time of patient interaction/FFR use, and particle retention efficiency of the FFR were used as inputs to a linear model. the model calculated that CFFR would be approximately 4500 influenza viruses given an influenza aerosol concentration of 12,000 viruses m\u20133, a breathing rate of 1.140 m3hr\u20131, a particle retention efficiency of the FFR of 0.991, and a 20-min patient interaction/FFR use studies in the early 1990s found that fungi and certain bacteria could grow on filters made of cellulose because they are capable of digesting cellulose. however, modern (post-1995) FFRs are made of polypropylene, which cannot serve as a nutrient for bacteria. pH1N1 was detected on FFRs for up to 6 days with an average of 90% reduction (1 log) in viability during this time period. similar findings were found using MS2 phage as a surrogate for respiratory viruses. there are now a few surgical N95 FFRs incorporating antimicrobial technologies. one device has been cleared by the FDA with claims of 8 hr of continuous use. however, none of these devices has been evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature. an unpublished conference presentation reports the transfer efficiency of a bacterium, Bacillus atrophaeus, from a FFR to synthetic skin as 0.005% and 0.05% for touching and rubbing respectively. other microbial transfer studies for porous surfaces have shown similar results. an estimated 4.5 pathogens were transferred to the hands of the HCW during the user seal check step and 1 pathogen for each touch involving a fingertip. a full assessment that takes into account these steps is beyond the scope of this commentary. extended use is considered minimal risk for typical patient interactions. reusing FFRs provides multiple opportunities for the hands of HCWs to come in contact with any infectious microbes on the respirator surface. this involves a higher level of risk compared to extended use. the highest reaerosolization of 0.21% occurred with a droplet nuclei challenge. a droplet challenge led to reaerosolization of less than 0.0001%. findings consistent with earlier studies that examined reaerosolization of bacteria and inert particles. a specialized face mask containing electret filter media was worn in one study (92) to successfully collect infectious virus from the exhaled breath of symptomatic test subjects. proper labeling, training, and education can be effective at limiting any inadvertent sharing of FFRs during reuse. recommended replacement life for electret filters in air cleaning systems is typically 3 months of normal use. only a few studies have been done to verify FFR performance in extended use or reuse type scenarios. s of FFRs measured restorative forces of straps for five simulated donnings. the majority of the reduction occurring after the first donning. fit factors of 6 models were measured by 10 subjects up to 20 times. studies in other workplaces have assessed protection over extended periods of continuous use by measuring the WPFs. no evidence of reduced protection as a function of time was noted in these studies. the scientific studies provide evidence that extended use is unlikely to reduce protection afforded by a FFR. filtering medium has been shown to capture and retain a majority of airborne biological particles compared to the layers next to the face and farthest from the face. the electret filtering medium has been shown to capture and retain a majority of airborne biological particles compared to the layers next to the face and farthest from the face. a study found that samples from 19 of 21 N95 FFR models stored for up to 10 years had expected levels of filtration performance. Fit Fit is a measurement of the efficacy of the seal between the FFR and the face of the wearer. some studies have analyzed strap performance and fit for multiple donnings. study design could be considered an extended use scenario covering three patient encounters. five subjects with initial fit factors greater than 200 registered simulated workplace protection factors greater than 400. three subjects with initial fit factors less than 200 had simulated workplace protection factors ranging from 132 to 326. researchers found that extended use caused no or minimal increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and transcutaneous carbon dioxide. they also found that 2 hr of continuous FFR use at low-moderate work rate did not cause a change in core body temperature. long 27 HCWs could tolerate multiple bouts of 2-hr-long extended use periods. only 16 and 18 of the 27 subjects using those two models were able to complete all four 2-hr use periods. most reported reason for stopping use was head and facial discomfort. data suggest some models may be more suitable for reuse. but this discomfort will likely be tolerable for most HCWs. continuous use over extended periods of time up to 12 hr is unlikely to harm workers. Nicas and Jones modeled four influenza virus exposure pathways. a similar approach is used below to estimate the potential fomite hazard. factors that influence the risk of self-inoculation directly associated with handling a contaminated FFR include the quantity of respiratory pathogens deposited on the FFR surface. the use of engineering controls such as local exhaust ventilation might reduce CFFR by up to 71%. previous recommendations suggested the use of a surgical mask or faceshield on top of a FFR to reduce CFFR. however, previous work has identified a number of potential concerns. influenza remained viable for 8 hr on FFR samples, but infectivity dropped below detection limits at 24hr. both viruses survived longer on nonporous surfaces than on porous ones. research has been conducted on cleaning and disinfecting procedures for FFRs for possible reuse by the same HCW. the practice is not currently recommended and therefore is not a viable solution at this time to reduce the fomite potential of a reused FFR. a simple model for estimating the amount of pathogen transferred from the FFR to the hands of HCWs uses CFFR (the number of pathogens on the FFR as discussed above) no peer-reviewed sources are available on the transfer efficiency of relevant pathogens from a FFR to skin and others surfaces. the contact area of the hands depends upon the action of the HCW. the total surface area of the volar portion of the fingertips has been estimated to be 7.34 cm2(85) however, when implementing FFR reuse, the proper donning process requires a user seal check step, which requires the user to cover the entire FFR surface. the model developed by Nicas and Sun indicates that each successive step in the fomite pathway further reduces the number of infectious pathogens reaching the site where infection can occur. in theory, extended use should not present a significant self-inoculation hazard, as ideally, the HCW's hands should never come in contact with the contaminated filtering surface. in one study, influenza aerosol concentration, breathing rate of the wearer, time of patient interaction/FFR use, and particle retention efficiency of the FFR were used as inputs to a linear model to estimate influenza contamination levels inside and on the surface of the FFR. an increase in any parameter results in higher levels of CFFR (i.e., total number of pathogens on the FFR) studies in the early 1990s found that fungi and certain bacteria could grow on filters made of cellulose because they are capable of digesting cellulose. however, modern (post-1995) FFRs are made of polypropylene, which cannot serve as a nutrient for bacteria. this was not considered a concern because contact transmission for TB is unlikely. inactivation of 6 bacteriophage spiked on a N95 FFR surface was highly sensitive to environmental conditions, with a 1 log reduction over 24 hr at 40% relative humidity versus 4 log reduction over 24 hr at 60% relative humidity. there are now a few surgical N95 FFRs incorporating antimicrobial technologies that have been cleared by the FDA as medical devices. one device has been cleared by the FDA with claims of 8 hr of continuous use. however, none of these devices has been evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature for claims regarding their ability to reduce fomite potential. no peer-reviewed sources are available on the transfer efficiency of relevant pathogens from a FFR to skin and others surfaces. however, an unpublished conference presentation reports the transfer efficiency of a bacterium, Bacillus atrophaeus, from FFRs to synthetic skin as 0.005% and 0.05% for touching and rubbing. an estimated 4.5 pathogens were transferred to the hands of the HCW during the user seal check step and 1 pathogen for each touch involving a fingertip. step in the fomite pathway such as transfer of viable pathogens from hands to respiratory tract ports of entry, transport of viable pathogens to the site of infection. the Rebmann study(47) reported that HCWs touched or adjusted their FFR on average 10\u201320 times per 12 hr. shift. extended use is considered minimal risk for typical patient interactions (Table II) when coupled with training and education to reinforce proper use (e.g., don't touch the FFR surface) the highest reaerosolization of 0.21% occurred with a droplet nuclei challenge. a droplet challenge led to reaerosolization of less than 0.0001%. findings consistent with earlier studies that examined reaerosolization of bacteria and inert particles. sharing FFRs among HCWs could result in a secondary risk if at least one of the users is infectious. proper labeling, training, and education can be effective at limiting any inadvertent sharing of FFRs during reuse. medical devices are cleared by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. medical devices are intended to be worn by operating room personnel during surgical procedures. some surgical N95 respirator models are cleared by the FDA with claims of being a single-use device. limited reuse should only be considered after consultation with the surgical N95 respirator manufacturer and local hospital infection professionals. some knowledge gaps remain to be filled further enhancing an understanding of the risks involved with FFR extended use and limited reuse. the authors acknowledge that the evidence discussed above is not always as sufficient as desired to develop evidence-based policy decisions. in the interim the available evidence can be useful for policy-based and pragmatic public health decision ideologies. policy makers should use the best evidence available to them, even when it has substantial limitations. extended use offers a lower risk of self-inoculation compared to limited reuse. training and education should be stressed to reinforce the need for strict adherence to guidance to minimize unnecessary contact with the FFR surface and strict adherence to hand hygiene practices. guidance should emphasize the need for the employer to consult with the respirator manufacturer regarding the maximum number of donnings or uses suggested for the models used in that location. authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to members of the NPPTL H7N9 working group."}
