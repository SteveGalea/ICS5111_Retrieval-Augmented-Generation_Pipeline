{"summary": "clinical disease ranges from an acute febrile illness lasting 4\u20137 d (classic dengue fever) to a more severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), characterized by fever, hemorrhagic manifestations, and increased vascular permeability with leakage into interstitial spaces (21,28). a primary infection with one serotype of DENV induces lifelong immunity to that serotype. human antibody response was evaluated by analyzing the quality of antibodies in the sera of DENV-immune individuals (4,14,31,39,40) in the last couple years, several groups have generated and characterized human (h)MAbs by stimulating memory B cells obtained from DENV-immune donors in vitro. antibodies against DIII are a minority in human immune sera and among isolated hMAbs (1,8,29) b-cell bulk cultures and isolation of hMAbs Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed twice. PBMCs were stimulated with 2.5 g/mL R848 (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) and 1000 U/mL recombinant human (rh IL-2) these cells were then added to a 24-well plate. cells were plated at 100 cells/well in 96-well plates. they were maintained with bi-weekly stimulation with CpG, rhIL-2 and transferrin. supernatants were regularly collected and tested for antibody secretion. 384-well microplates were coated overnight with 20 ng/well DENV-1-4 E or DENV-2 NS1 protein (Hawaii Biotech), a 1:40 dilution of deNV-1-4-infected or uninfected (control) Vero cell lysate. x-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that these proteins retain a native-like structure (3). the suspension of fixed cells was then sonicated on ice in a sonic dismembrator. the supernatant was collected, aliquotted, and frozen at 80\u00b0C. control antigen was prepared similarly from uninfected Vero cell monolayers. negative controls consisted of culture fluid grown in parallel with no virus. plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 90 min. antibodies #27 and #41 were added to the wells for 1 h. ocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human IgG (F-9006; Sigma-Aldrich). Approximately 2104 cells were analyzed for each sample. data were collected on a BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences) washed three times with 1PBST (10 mM phosphate buffer [pH 7.2], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 10 min, each followed by incubation in anti-human IgG-HRP-conjugated antibody solution. blot was visualized with a chemiluminescent HRP-conjugated antibody detection reagent. 0.5105 cells per well were serially diluted in MEM containing 1% BSA supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. each well was washed with 1 mL of PBS containing 10% FBS. an aliquot of cells was either permeabilized with Cytofix/CytoPerm for 20 min or left unpermeabilized. the cells were stained with MAbs against human IgM and IgG. PBMCs were stimulated with 2.5 g/mL R848 (invivoGen, San Diego, CA) and 1000 U/mL recombinant human (rh) IL-2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) cells were then added to a 24-well plate. after 7 d at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, ELISpot assays were performed. the wells were coated with 100 L anti-human IgG (15 g/mL, MT91/145; Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. a 1:40 dilution of deNV-1-4-infected or uninfected (control cell lysate) the recombinant proteins were expressed in Drosophila sp. S2 cells. they are known to bind to native conformation-dependent MAbs. x-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that these proteins retain a native-like structure (3). the virus inoculum was removed after 1.5 h, and fresh medium was added after washing the cells twice with PBS. the medium was harvested, cleared of cellular debris by low-speed centrifugation, aliquotted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. hMAb recognition of DENV-infected cells by flow cytometry. cells were infected with DENV-1 or DENV-3 (MOI 0.2) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. DS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using a 12.5% denaturing gel. proteins were electro-transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the membrane was blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk in 1PBS. the plates were blocked with 1% BSA for 90 min. one set of plates was incubated with 8 M urea for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. both sets of plates were washed and incubated with anti-human IgG-HRP. cells were pipetted to break up any clumps and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. the cells were stained with a 1:100 dilution of the DENV-specific antibody 2H2 (Millipore), followed by a 1:200 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody (Sigma) PBMCs were cultured in the presence of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 for 7 d to activate memory B cells to secrete antibody. we detected DENV E-specific ASCs in PBMCs from 5/5 donors and NS1-specific ASCs in 4/5 donors. the undiluted supernatants from the stimulated PBMC cultures were tested by ELISA in triplicate for recognition of recombinant DENV-1 \u20134 E and DENV-2 NS1 proteins. we then wanted to isolate memory B-cell-derived hMAbs from these donors for more in-depth characterization of their serotype specificity and neutralization potency. 9/40 were serotype-specific and bound DENV-3 antigen only. we then tested the supernatants for recognition of DENV rE and rNS1 proteins. of the 17 antibodies that recognized the rE protein, 6 (36%) were serotype-specific. antibodies from donor 2 were determined by ELISA (n=3) to be (B) serotype-specific, or (C) serotype-cross-reactive to DENV E protein. hMAbs #27 and #41 were able to recognize the inactivated lysates of DENV-1 and 3, but not DENV-2 or 4 antigens consistently. monoclonal antibodies from donor 2 recognize DENV. lack of recognition of rE and rNS1 proteins of DENV by MAbs #27 and #41. supernatants from wells #27 and #41 were next tested for reactivity to DENV in a non-reducing Western blot. both MAbs #27 and #41 had a higher avidity index to DENV-3\u2013inactivated lysate. the overall avidity index to conA-immobilized infectious DENV was lower compared to the inactivated lysates. both MAbs #27 and #41 also had a higher avidity index to DENV-3 virions. dilutions of MAbs #27 and #41 show infection in presence of 1:1000 dilutions. both MAbs had higher avidity to DENV-3 compared to DENV-1. both MAbs had lower avidity to DENV-3 compared to DENV-1, with poor neutralizing activity in vitro. the cells were stained with a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-human antibody. the cells were stained with a secondary FITC-conjugated antibody alone. we examined the phenotype of the EBV-transformed B cells from donor 2. PBMCs were cultured in the presence of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 for 7 d to activate memory B cells to secrete antibody. we then used supernatants from R848-stimulated PBMCs to assess whether the breadth and serotype cross-reactivity of antibodies to DENV proteins detected by ELISpot were also reflected in antibodies secreted by memory B cells. the undiluted supernatants from the stimulated PBMC cultures were tested by ELISA in triplicate for recognition of recombinant DENV 1\u20134 E and DENV-2 NS1 proteins. supernatants were collected from these wells every 2 wk and tested by ELISA to define the major antigens they recognized. we found that 31/40 hMAbs were able to bind more than one dengue antigen. 9/40 were serotype-specific and bound DENV-3 antigen only. we then tested the supernatants for recognition of DENV rE and rNS1 proteins, the major targets of anti-DENV antibodies. antibody serotype cross-reactivity to inactivated antigen lysate preparations of DENV-1\u2013 through DENV-4\u2013infected or uninfected Vero cells. antibody from donor 2 were determined by ELISA (n=3) to be (B) serotype-specific, or (C) serotype-cross-reactive to DENV E protein. two MAbs (#27 and #41) were potentially binding to the prM protein. monoclonal antibodies from donor 2 recognize DENV. lack of recognition of rE and rNS1 proteins of DENV by MAbs #27 and #41. supernatants from wells #27 and #41 tested for reactivity to DENV. we speculated that MAbs #27 and #41 would have different avidities to DENV-1\u2013 and DENV-3\u2013inactivated lysates. this could reflect the serotype of virus the donor was infected with. both MAbs #27 and #41 also had a higher avidity index to DENV-3 virions. tralization did not reach 100%, but plateaued between 40 and 50% for MAb #27 and between 50 and 60% for MAb #41. both MAbs had higher avidity to DENV-3 compared to DENV-1. both MAbs had lower avidity to DENV-3 compared to DENV-1, with poor neutralizing activity in vitro. hMAbs #41 (A\u2013F) or #27 (G\u2013I) were stained with a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-human antibody. representative staining of uninfected (C) and infected (F and I) cells with the secondary FITC-conjugated antibody alone is shown. we characterized two antibodies that did not bind rE protein produced in Drosophila cells, but bound reduction-sensitive epitopes on the E protein derived from whole virus or virus-infected cell lysates. the findings are in accord with several recent reports that have characterized hMAbs from DENV-immune donors. de Alwis et al. characterized three MAbs that strongly neutralized DENV infection in vitro. they found that they bound complex epitopes that were expressed only when the E protein was assembled as a virus particle (7). the findings are interesting since this donor reported travel to northern Thailand in 1987. phenotyped B cells secreted anti-DENV antibodies that recognized conformation-sensitive E epitopes was CD19+CD20+CD27+IgG+. CD19 and CD20 expression was maintained on B cells during the process of immortalization. further studies are needed to understand how the properties of hMAbs from DENV-immune donors relate to the properties of serum antibody. CD27 expression has been reported to be downregulated following EBV transformation (22); therefore, it is possible that memory B cells secreting MAbs #27 and #41 downregulated CD27."}
