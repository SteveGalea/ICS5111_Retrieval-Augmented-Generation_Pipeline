RNA from biological samples is reverse transcribed to produce cDNA. the two samples are then mixed and hybridized onto a spotted microarray slide. the slide is washed, it is scanned at two different wavelengths. for the image shown, the test sample was labeled with Cy5 and the control sample was labeled with Cy3. for the image shown, the test sample was labeled with Cy5 and the control sample was labeled with Cy3. microarrays for a large number of species are available [10,11]. a lot of information about microarray technology can be ascertained. a number of resources can be referenced to the goals of the experiment. microarray experiments are typically constructed using one of several different design layouts including loop, reference, and saturated. the loop design is relatively simple and involves minimizing the number of duplicates while retaining pertinent comparisons. failure of a single array can greatly magnify error and statistical variance. this setup can become costly if the goals of the experiment require multiple comparisons to be made. the saturated design involves making every possible comparison exactly once. there are two main platforms to consider when designing microarray experiments. spotted microarrays and oligonucleotide microarrays are ideal for time-course experiments. oligonucleotide microarrays are ideal for time-course experiments. a number of approaches can be taken to minimize external variables such as discrepancies in growing and preparing biological samples. the preparation of control samples used in a microarray experiment is typically not critical, but the samples must be stable throughout the experiment and be reproducible. selective methods such as mitotic shake-off have also been used due to questions about the validity of whole-culture methods. a single microarray experiment evaluates the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. it would be extremely impractical to verify each and every gene using any of the methods listed above. a number of key genes are verified depending on the purpose and scope of the experiment. normalization can be thought of as the first level of filtering applied to the data. essentially, normalization accounts for differences in labeling efficiencies and detection levels for the fluorescent dyes as well as differences in quantity/quality of RNA samples. the graph illustrates inherent differences between the dyes in terms of labeling and detection efficiencies due to the characteristics of each dye. Using regression techniques, the best-fit slope is calculated and modified to be equal to one by adjusting gene intensities. each point in the graph represents a single spot on a hybridized microarray. four different algorithms (when applied to the same data set) can generate vastly different groupings; each providing a different perspective on patterns present in the data. each algorithm segregates the data differently, based on specific parameters and conditions. k-means clustering aims to partition gene expression data into a specified number of disjoint clusters. k-means clustering aims to partition gene expression data into a specified number of disjoint clusters. each gene is placed in one of the clusters initially specified and distances between clusters are calculated. this method is reliable and relatively simple and therefore is useful in analyzing data for which there is some prior knowledge such as classifying serotypes or strains. the plot generated from PCA allows patterns in data to be visualized by examining the proximity of clusters. evaluating microarray data with specific genes or groups of genes in mind. infrequently, studies were undertaken for other purposes such as gene discovery or examining distinct cellular properties. however, in recent years, the number of studies utilizing microarrays has increased greatly. the arrays used in this study were designed to detect a multitude of polymorphisms between the two strains. Adaptive mutations were identified by linking polymorphisms to the evolved parental strain [29] researchers applied their method to yeast strains adapting to a changing glucose-galactose feed. researchers compared murine hearts infected with the virus against non-infected murine hearts. oligonucleotide microarrays were used to characterize unknown samples from water treatment centers. microarrays were constructed to target 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from several groups of nitrifying bacteria. studies are being conducted to explore the feasibility and implementation of similar methods for other pathogens. the availability of custom arrays designed to probe a small subset of genes (usually several hundred) has also enhanced the potential utilization of microarray technology. researchers at the national cancer institute used microarrays to organize biopsy samples of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma from more than 200 patients [44]. they identified 3 subgroups with varying expression of 17 distinct genes; constructing a model capable of predicting survival rates following chemotherapy [44]. microarrays may very well provide a means of avoiding these procedures by establishing criteria that can be used to verify consistency and reproducibility. the variability associated with a single gene can exceed levels needed to verify or validate biological processes. this is because the variability associated with a single gene can exceed levels needed to verify or validate biological processes. is and microarrays were used to identify genes involved in the acclimation of changing visible light in cyanobacteria. researchers found approximately 80 proteins with different levels between cells grown in green light vs. red light as well as 17 genes not previously thought to be regulated by light. a number of these genes had homologs in other organisms. the present text aims to illustrate the strengths, weaknesses, and application of microarrays, especially to those unfamiliar with the technology. the term microarray is both descriptive and somewhat ambiguous as it is commonly used to describe a variety of platforms including protein microarrays and tissue microarrays. the probes in spotted arrays are oligonucleotides, complementary DNA (cDNA) or fragments of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. each type conferring different properties to the spotted array. oligonucleotide microarrays are hybridized with only one sample. probes can consist of cDNA, oligonucleotides, fragments of PCR products, restriction-enzyme digested fragments, oligomers, or expressed sequence tags. the same public databases are referenced for sequencing information. labeled with Cy5 and the control sample is labeled with Cy3. black represents no binding (i.e. no signal), green indicates greater binding of the control sample than of the test sample referred to as down-regulation. red indicates greater binding of the test sample than of the test sample referred to as up-regulation. microarrays are continually refined to enhance reproducibility and detection levels of weak signals by modifying the positioning and sequences of the spotted arrays. ESTs are essentially unique segments of cDNA identical to a portion of a gene, thereby acting as binding domain. however, valuable information can still be ascertained by hybridizing samples onto arrays designed for others. microarray experiments are typically constructed using one of several different design layouts including loop, reference, and saturated. the loop design involves minimizing the number of duplicates while retaining pertinent comparisons. the saturated design involves making every possible comparison exactly once. oligonucleotide microarrays are ideal for time-course experiments. oligonucleotide microarrays are ideal for time-course experiments. oligonucleotide microarrays are ideal for time-course experiments. a simple search online will reveal a multitude of companies that manufacture microarrays and allow customers to construct their own custom arrays using specialized software. internal controls check for the quality of the printed microarray whereas external controls account for performance in terms of sensitivity and robustness. whole-culture methods such as serum starvation and DNA arrest are typically used. selective methods such as mitotic shake-off have also been used. synchronization is critical in order to assign distinct expression patterns to specific genes. replicates should be performed using RNA samples prepared at the same time under the same conditions. a combinatorial approach is usually needed to verify the results generated from microarray experiments. the latter generates relative expression levels whereas the latter generates absolute expression levels [1,6] a number of normalization techniques can be applied to microarray data. the most commonly used are: total intensity, regression, and ratio statistics. all three of these techniques assume that for some group of genes on the array, the average expression ratio is equal to one. the measured intensities are in arbitrary units. each point in the graph represents a single spot on a hybridized microarray. the red line is the best-fit line calculated for the data with a slope that is close to unity. cDNA microarrays hybridized with human cells grown under varying conditions. each algorithm segregates the data differently, based on specific parameters and conditions. this type of clustering is popular due to its simplicity and ability to visualize the data. k-means clustering aims to partition gene expression data into a specified number of disjoint clusters. k-means clustering aims to partition gene expression data into a specified number of disjoint clusters. a distance metric is used in these calculations and can be specified by the user. the plot generated from PCA allows patterns in data to be visualized by examining the proximity of clusters. the method implements a series of calculations to best separate the data and project that final analysis onto a 2 or 3 dimensional plot. hypothesis testing aims to establish statistical significance associated with divergent findings. microarray analysis revealed a group of nine genes were over-expressed during exposure to nitric oxide. of these nine genes yhb1 which detoxifies nitric oxide, was the most highly expressed [28] evolutionary studies using microarrays have gained prominence with the use of species-specific arrays in parallel. invasive strains to isolates from healthy people using cDNA microarray constructed from 7 previous sequencing projects. ten dominant lineages were identified; each with a distinct group of genes with potential functions related to virulence and resistence. evolutionary divergence must have occurred early on [30] ys were used to compare infected HeLa cells over time. a microarray was constructed to target 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from several groups of nitrifying bacteria. the results were classified using statistical methods in order to develop a procedure to test for specificity with diagnostic application. microarray experiments are conducted in a series of steps with each step being distinct and in a particular order. new chips equipped with electronic circuitry are circumventing a number of these steps particularly sample labeling. a number of companies and research facilities now offer specialized arrays. researchers analyzed an Escherichia coli strain, A49, with a mutation in the rnpA gene making it sensitive to temperature. under varying growth conditions, researchers found a number of genes differentially expressed. this is because the variability associated with a single gene can exceed the expression levels of individual genes. a paper published in 2003 used microarrays together with other experimental techniques to decipher a pathway responsible for regulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a pro-inflammatory protein associated with arthritis and pain. a continuation of this work was published in 2005 further illuminating the pathway and possible feedback mechanisms with important therapeutic implications. the researchers designed a modified hlyA gene to reduce the rate of translation by incorporating rare codons leading to the same amino acid sequence. the study indicated it was possible to engineer cells using an approach that combined genomics and proteomics. the strength of the technology rests on the several factors including ease of use, availability of platforms and lower cost relative to other exploratory methods. microarrays only present a snapshot of the transcriptome which is constantly changing and responding to cellular needs and signals. differentially expressed genes may not translate into varying protein levels with functional implications. complexity of microarray analysis makes it exceedingly difficult to ascertain meaningful data without clearly defined goals or targets. authors' contributions PJ formulated the content, performed the literature search, and drafted much of the manuscript.
