{"summary": "PRRS is an enveloped, positive-sense ssRNA virus. the virus encodes two long non-structural polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. innate immune response recognizes viral infections through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger type I IFN expression through the activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors and Toll-like receptors. RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) form a known receptor for intracellular viral dsRNA. PRRSV 3CLSP inhibits IFN- production stimulated by Sendai virus (SeV) through mediation of MAVS cleavage. pigs do not invoke a type I IFN response. 3CLSP inhibits the promoter activation of IFN-, IRF3 and NF-B. 3CLSP inhibits the promoter activation of IFN-, IRF3 and NF-B. 3CLSP disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signalling for activation of both IRFs and NF-B. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding 3CLSP and pRL-TK together with IRF3\u2013Luc and NF-B\u2013Luc reporter plasmids. 3CLSP effectively antagonizes IFN- production by impairing the activation of IRF3 and NF-B signalling HEK-293T cells were induced to IFN- expression by serine protease activity. 3CLSP mutants did not significantly inhibit SeV-induced activities of the IFN- promoter. MAVS acts as a shared bridge protein between IRF3 and NF-B signalling. PRRSV 3CLSP disrupted RIG-I/MDA5 signalling for activation of both IRFs and NF-B. plasmids (3 g) and 3CLSP expression plasmids (0.5 g) were transfected with flag-tagged MAVS expression plasmids. the cells were collected and analysed by Western blotting. mutant vectors of 3CLSP (H39A, D64A and S118A) lost ability to cleave MAVS. hek-293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged MAVS expression plasmids. cells were lysed at 32 h post-transfection and analysed by Western blotting. 3CLSP preferentially cleaves glutamic acid/glycine (E/G), glutamic acid/alanine (E/A) and/or glutamic acid/serine (E/S) bonds of viral polyproteins and cellular targets. the cleavage product of N-terminal, Flag-tagged MAVS is predicted to be a 37 kDa product. intact MAVS is predicted to be about a 55 kDa product encoding 3CLSP-mediated MAVS cleavage is involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged WT MAVS or MAVS mutants (E268A, E274A and E288A) along with 3CLSP or an empty vector. PRRSV 3CLSP-induced MAVS cleavage fragments exhibit impaired type I IFN signalling. the N-terminal CARD domain, proline-rich (PRO) domain and C-terminal TM domain are required for induction of type I IFN. PRRSV 3CLSP inhibits the promoter activation of IFN-, IRF3 and NF-B. cells were treated with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the porcine IFN- promoter. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with a luciferase reporter plasmid. 3CLSP disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signalling for activation of both IRFs and NF-B. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding 3CLSP and pRL-TK together with IRF3\u2013Luc and NF-B\u2013Luc reporter plasmids. 3CLSP effectively antagonizes IFN- production by impairing the activation of IRF3 and NF-B signalling 3CLSP activity is essential for nsp4 inhibition of IFN- production. activity of 3CLSP is abolished by any mutation to the amino acids in the catalytic triad. 3CLSP activity is essential for nsp4 inhibition of IFN- production. PRRSV 3CLSP blocks IFN- expression by cleaving MAVS MAVS is a crucial adaptor protein in the antiviral signalling pathway. MAVS acts as a shared bridge protein between IRF3 and NF-B signalling. PRRSV 3CLSP cleaves MAVS at 32 h after co-transfection. hek-293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged MAVS expression plasmids. at 32 h after co-transfection, the cells were collected and analysed. 3CLSP activity is responsible for MAVS cleavage. hek-293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged MAVS expression plasmids. the cells were analysed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-MAVS antibody. proteasome pathways, MAVS expression plasmids and plasmids encoding 3CLSP were transfected into HEK-293T cells. at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 8 h. the results showed that neither z-VAD-FMK nor MG132 affected MAVS cleavage by 3CLSP. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged WT MAVS or MAVS mutants (E268A, E274A and E288A) along with 3CLSP or an empty vector. the cells were lysed at 32 h post-transfection and analysed by Western blotting. PRRSV 3CLSP cleaved MAVS at E268, which is located between the PRO domain and TM domain. two MAVS cleavage mutants, the N-terminal fragment (aa 1\u2013268) and C-terminal fragment (aa 269\u2013540) of MAVS were constructed. neither fragment (aa 1\u2013268 and aa 269\u2013540) was capable of efficiently activating any of the three promoters. nsp4 antagonizes IFN- expression through 3CLSP-mediated MAVS cleavage. results indicated that the cleavage site is at E268. type I IFNs are secreted cytokines and have multifunctional roles in antiviral defence and adaptive immunity. cleavage of the adaptor protein MAVS is important to mediate host innate immune activity. canine hepacivirus NS3 serine protease and coxsackievirus B 3Cpro can cleave the adaptor proteins MAVS and TRIF. 3CLSP-mediated cleavage of MAVS was identified as an alternative molecular mechanism of type I IFN evasion used by PRRSV. MAVS is composed of an N-terminal CARD domain, PRO domain and C-terminal TM domain. this cleavage renders MAVS incapable of activating the IFN- promoter. nsp4 blocked the IFN signalling pathway by cleaving MAVS. PRRSV 3CLSP can inhibit IFN- expression by impairing the activation of both IRF3 and NF-B. 3CLSP-mediated proteolytic cleavage of MAVS was directly involved in the inhibition of type I IFN activation and cleavage of MAVS. expression plasmids for WT RIG-I (pEF-Flag-RIG-IN), its constitutively active mutant (pEF-Flag-RIG-IN) have been described elsewhere. empty vector control was designated'mock' firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) the data are presented as relative firefly luciferase activities normalized to Renilla luciferase activities (mean sd) mouse mAbs against Flag and haemagglutinin were obtained from beyotime Institute of Biotechnology.
