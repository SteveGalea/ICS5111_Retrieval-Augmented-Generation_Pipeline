{"summary": "the positive sense RNA genome of JV is organised into ORF1 (non-structural proteins), ORF2 (major capsid protein) and ORF3 (minor capsid protein) the lack of a cell culture system for studying JV replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing. JV is a type I genogroup III (GIII) norovirus which is closely related to the type II GIII bovine noroviruses Newbury agent 2 and Dumfries. the GIII noroviruses are responsible for causing enteric disease in cattle [2], [5] and, thus, likely share a similar tissue tropism to the human-associated enteric noroviruses. the encoding sequence within the 5\u2032 region of JV ORF1 (5\u2032GS) shows a high level of divergence. this is mainly attributed to the presence of several proline-encoding polypyrimidine tracts within the region predicted to encode a 35 kDa N-terminal protein. the predicted size of N-terminal proteins relative to the size of the respective 2C proteins differs within the genus. a 3C protease-mediated cleavage event within the N-terminal protein (37 kDa) was described for camberwell virus, a genogroup 2 norovirus, yielding proteins of 22 kDa and 15 kDa [17]. the N-terminal protein of noroviruses corresponds to the 2AB region in picornaviruses. 5.3 kDa is unique among the noroviruses that have been studied in this way. the in vitro transcription and translation profile for JV was therefore studied in more detail. there are no major reaction products synthesised prior to the 1 hr point. the 19 kDa protein was identified as the 3C-like protease. the antisera used to detect the MNV N-term protein recognised 3 products. one was predicted molecular weight at 39 kDa and the other two bands migrated as a 45 kDa doublet. bi-cistronic constructs were made with a cap dependent 5\u2032 EGFP cistron and a 3\u2032 lacZ cistron under the translational control of either the JV 5\u2032GS (pEGFP-C1/JV5\u2032GS/lacZ) or an authentic EMCV IRES (pEGFP-C1/IRES/lacZ) both constructs were able to direct translation of the EGFP cistron effectively as expected. multiple translation termination codons (polySTOP) were inserted into the JV genome within the 3B-encoding region, downstream of the 5\u2032GS, to halt translation at a defined point. a mutation of the critical cysteine residue within the 3C region of JV successfully inactivated the 3C protease. a large, >200kDa uncleaved polyprotein is yielded following TNT\u00ae. this is in agreement with the initiation of translation occurring at nucleotide 22. it is not possible to determine whether translation of intracellular VPg-bound viral RNA initiates at nucleotide 22. the V5 epitope originates from the P and V proteins of the SV5 paramyxovirus [29] for which a commercially available monoclonal antibody is used for detection. a new product, approximately 42 kDa in size, was visible. lysates of cells transfected with wild type JV and JV/V5 RNA were subjected to western blot using the anti-V5 antibody. a protein of approximately 42 kDa in size was visible in cells that had been transfected with JV/V5 RNA. the appearance of the 42 kDa V5 product confirms ORF1 translation and activity of the 3C protease in vivo. the consistent appearance of the N-term/V5 protein suggested that it is stable and insensitive to degradation by viral and host cell proteases. a recent study described a similar anomaly when investigating proteolytic processing in the murine norovirus MNV-1. NV-1-infected cell lysates only the 43\u201345 kDa doublet and a large 115 kDa precursor could be detected. it is also possible that the N-term protein may be modified in some way leading to a shift in observed molecular weight. it is not known why the JV N-term was previously not detected in in vitro transcription and translation studies prior to the insertion of the V5 epitope. the study of Jena virus offers a potential animal model of enteric noroviral infection. however, until a permissive bovine cell and/or organ culture systems is established analysis of molecular mechanisms underpinning viral replication and pathogenesis rely upon in vitro systems. the lack of an N-terminal protein encoded by the JV 5\u2032GS, predicted to be 35.3 kDa, is unique among the noroviruses that have been studied in this way. the in vitro transcription and translation profile for JV was therefore studied in more detail. the 19 kDa protein was identified as the 3C-like protease. antisera used to detect the MNV N-term protein recognised 3 products. one was predicted molecular weight at 39 kDa and the other two bands migrated as a 45 kDa doublet. if the 3\u2032 cistron is translated in addition to the 5\u2032 cistron then the sequence of interest is said to have IRES-like properties. bi-cistronic constructs were made with a cap dependent 5\u2032 EGFP cistron and a 3\u2032 lacZ cistron under the translational control of either the JV 5\u2032GS (pEGFP-C1/JV5\u2032GS/lacZ) or an authentic EMCV IRES (pEGFP translation initiation in JV ORF1 was predicted to be the ATG encoding methionine at nucleotide position 22 as it is situated in a favourable context for translation initiation. multiple translation termination codons (polySTOP) were inserted into the JV genome within the 3B-encoding region downstream of the 5\u2032GS. the major product generated by JV 3Cmut/polySTOP was calculated to be 103kDa in size. this is in agreement with the initiation of translation occurring at nucleotide 22. it is likely given the favourable context in which the initiation codon is situated. the 14aa V5 epitope encoding sequence was cloned in frame into the JV cDNA construct at nucleotide position 123 (JV V5) the epitope originates from the P and V proteins of the SV5 paramyxovirus [29], for which a commercially available monoclonal antibody is used for detection. a new product, approximately 42 kDa in size, was visible (Figure 5, lane 2). cells transfected with wild type full length JV RNA were negative for fluorescence. a protein of approximately 42 kDa in size was visible in cells that had been transfected with JV/V5 RNA. the appearance of the 42 kDa V5 product confirms ORF1 translation and activity of the 3C protease in vivo. cell lysates were analysed by Western blot using the anti-V5 antibody. the consistent appearance of the N-term/V5 protein suggested it is stable and insensitive to degradation by viral and host cell proteases. N-term existed as a 45 kDa doublet, in addition to the predicted size of 38 kDa. but only the 43\u201345 kDa doublet and a large 115 kDa precursor could be detected. it is also possible that the N-term protein may be modified in some way leading to a shift in observed molecular weight. human norovirus infection has been shown to be the leading cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis. there is currently no cell culture system available to facilitate viral replication. ethical considerations have hindered progress in establishing a permissive human organ culture system. pEGFP-C1/JV 5\u2032 GS/lacZ coding sequence was amplified from the pSV--Gal reporter vector (Promega) using bio-X-Act DNA polymerase. primers 5\u2032 GS F (5\u2032-AACTGCAGATCT TAATAAGTGAATGACGAT-3\u2032), containing the BglII restriction site (bold) and two in-frame translation termination codons. the lacZ amplicon was ligated to the intermediate pEGFP-C1/IRES vector following restriction enzyme digest of both amplicon and vector with HindIII and ApaI restriction enzymes. the ligated DNA used to transform E.coli Top10 was verified by sequencing. round 1 used the primers JV F1 (5\u2032-CGTCTCAGGGTTGATACT-3\u2032) and JV Mut 1 (5\u2032-GCAACCACCGTCACCAG-3\u2032), yielding a 222 bp amplicon. round 2 used the primers JV Mut 2 (5\u2032-CTGGTGACGGTGGTTGC-3\u2032) and JV R2 (5\u2032-TTCCTGGGAGGAAGTT-3\u2032), yielding a 651 bp ampli each oligo (1 g) was incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP to phosphorylate the 5\u2032 termini. after purification the polySTOP duplex was ligated to Eco47III digested JV 3Cmut, and ligated DNA was used to transform E.coli Top10. the duplex contained the unique restriction site MluI to assist screening of recombinant clones. in vitro coupled transcription and translation was performed using the TNT\u00ae Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) the 35 S-Methionine was replaced with 1 mM unlabelled Methionine (2 l) the beads were resuspended in 500 l 1 RIPA buffer and once with 500 l PBS. the experiments were performed more than once to confirm the results. capped RNA was synthesised using the mMessage mMachine\u00ae Capped RNA Transcription kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cells were seeded onto 19 mm coverslips in 6 well trays and were transfected with RNA. lysates were incubated for 15 min on ice followed by sonication to shear genomic DNA. equal protein content from JV V5 and JV FLC lysates were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. membrane was probed using anti-V5 monoclonal antibody at manufacturer's recommended dilution. the pEGFP-C1/JV 5\u2032 GS sequence was amplified from the cDNA clone. the lacZ coding sequence was amplified using bio-X-Act DNA polymerase. the primers 5\u2032 GS F (5\u2032-AACTGCAGATCT TAATAAGTGAATGACGAT-3\u2032), containing the BglII restriction site (bold) the pIRES2-EGFP vector was amplified using bio-X-Act DNA polymerase. the primers IRES Bgl F (5\u2032-ACTCGAAGATCT TAATAGAGCTTCGAATTCTGC-3\u2032), containing the SacI restriction site (bold) the lacZ amplicon was ligated to the pEGFP-C1 vector follwing restriction enzyme digest of both amplicon and vector with HindIII and ApaI restriction enzymes round 1 used the primers JV F1 (5\u2032-CGTCTCAGGGTTGATACT-3\u2032) and JV Mut 1 (5\u2032-GCAACCACCGTCACCAG-3\u2032), yielding a 222 bp amplicon. round 2 used the primers JV Mut 2 (5\u2032-CTGGTGACGGTGGTTGC-3\u2032) and JV R2 (5\u2032-TTCCTGGGAGGAACAAGTT-3\u2032), yielding a 651 bp each oligo (1 g) was incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP to phosphorylate the 5\u2032 termini, pooled and heated to 75\u00b0C for 15 min. ligated DNA was used to transform E.coli Top10. the duplex contained the unique restriction site MluI to assist screening of recombinant clones. in vitro coupled transcription and translation was performed using the TNT\u00ae Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) for non-radiolabelled reactions the 35 S-Methionine was replaced with 1 mM unlabelled Methionine (2 l) reaction products were analysed by SDS-PAGE. cells were seeded into a 12 well tray at approximately 40\u201350% confluence. cells were transfected with no DNA (negative control), pSV--Gal (control for -galactosidase activity), pEGFP-C1/JV 5\u2032 GS/lacZ and pEGFP-C1/IRES/lacZ (control for -glactosidase activity) using the superfectTM transfection reagent.
