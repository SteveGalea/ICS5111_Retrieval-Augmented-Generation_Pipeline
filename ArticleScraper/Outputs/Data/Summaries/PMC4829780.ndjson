{"summary": "the alarmingly rapid spread of MERS in Korea is attributed to several factors including absence of a government plan against contagious diseases. the government\u2019s failure at early response, lack of communication with expert organizations and limitations in the current health and medical system. the outbreak has been contained with no additional new cases for over 70 days. the government declared a de facto end to the MERS outbreak on July 28. if traditional oriental medicine doctors with insufficient clinical experience are allowed to use modern medical devices, the danger of such recklessness will be completely borne by the patients. the Korean government is basically promoting unlicensed medical practices."}
