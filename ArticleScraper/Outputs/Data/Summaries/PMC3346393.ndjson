{"summary": "human norovirus (HuNoV) is the leading cause of food-borne illnesses in the united states. this virus is highly contagious, with an estimated medium infectious dose of 18 viral particles (50) the virus titers are high during peak shedding, with a load of approximately 10 to 11 log10 genomic equivalents (GE)/g in stool samples (5, 6), and shedding can persist for weeks after the symptoms have resolved (48). NV infections show different clinical manifestations compared to HuNoVs. it replicates in the intestine and causes weight loss and diarrhea in immunocompromised mice. the other commonly used surrogate is feline calicivirus (FCV) heat is commonly used for food preparation and processing. chlorine is used to disinfect water and wash leafy greens. alcohol is the major disinfection reagent for skin and surfaces. porcine SaV cowden strain was propagated in a porcine kidney cell line, LLC-PK (ATCC CRL-1392, currently ATCC CL-101) the cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% antibiotics, and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the 1% or 10% fecal suspension in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) of HuNoVs was used for virus stability studies. the FCV F9 strain was a gift from Louise Harris. the culture supernatants of FCV had a titer of 7.29 0.38 log10 TCID50/ml by observation of CPE and were used in the virus inactivation studies. the cytoplasm of the cells was stained red and observed using a light microscope. RNA was extracted by using a 5 MagMAX-96 Viral 1 kit and a MagMax Express magnetic particle processor. real-time quantitative RT-qPCR (RT-qPCR) was developed for the detection of porcine genogroup III (GIII) SaVs. the 20-l RT-PCR mixture included 2 l of sample RNA, 400 M deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 200 nM each primer, and 100 nM the probe. the reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min. the assay was sensitive, detecting 10 genomic equivalents (GE) per reaction (20 l) the detection limit of this assay is 10 GE per reaction (20 l) the reaction was performed by using the same oneStep RT-PCR kit and thermocycler as described for the SaV RT-qPCR. IC RNA was used as an artificial template in the above-mentioned SaV or GII NoV RT-qPCR. porcine SaV-infected cell culture supernatants were incubated at 56\u00b0C in a water bath for 30 min or 2 h. a 10% fecal suspension of the human NoV/GII.4/HS194 strain was placed on ice. each RNA sample was tested in triplicate for RT-qPCR. 100 l of virus solution was added to 900 l of sodium hypochlorite solution or control water and mixed well. one hundred microliters from the water control tubes was sampled and stored at 4\u00b0C (time zero [T0] samples) the tubes were incubated at room temperature with rocking at low speed for 30 min. each RNA sample was tested in triplicate by RT-qPCR. the infectious SaV was titrated in duplicate in the IHC infectivity assay. the treated samples were titrated on the same day that the experiment was performed. each experiment was performed in triplicate, with each performed in triplicate. Virus-inoculated lettuce leaves were incubated in a pH 5.0 buffer. they were removed from the bags to sterile petri dishes, dried in a biohazard hood for 1 h, and stored at 4\u00b0C for 1 week. a binomial test was performed to determine whether binding of virus to lettuce was significant. the culture supernatants of MNV had a titer of 5.68 0.29 log10 TCID50/ml. the culture supernatants were tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. they were used for virus stability studies and lettuce experiments. this strain was confirmed by RT-PCR with primers described by Park and Sobsey (41) cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% antibiotics, and 10 mM HEPES. FCV was propagated in CRFK cells in medium with 2% FBS as reported previously. serum to virus-like particles (VLPs) of porcine SaV (16) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG(H+L) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies. the substrate aminoethylcarbazole (AEC; AEC staining kit, Sigma) was used for color development. a plasmid DNA containing the sequence target the beginning of the major capsid VP1 gene. the 20-l RT-PCR mixture included 2 l of sample RNA, 400 M deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 200 nM each primer, and 100 nM the probe. the reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min. the one-step TaqMan RT-qPCR assay for the detection of GII NoVs was performed using the same oneStep RT-PCR kit and thermocycler as described for the SaV RT-qPCR. the detection limit of this assay is 10 GE per reaction (20 l) 5-TTGCAGTGGGCTTACATGGCGATAGCTA-Iowa black RQ was labeled with Cy5, whose emission wavelength is distant from that of 6-FAM (521 nm) the amount of IC RNA added to each reaction mixture generated a threshold cycle (CT) value of 28 to 29. the reaction was performed by using the SmartCycler system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) the SaV culture supernatants were diluted 1:10 in 1% human normal stool suspension in PBS to obtain a similar viral RNA titer, 9 log10 GE/ml. the commercial bleach (Clorox Co., CA), purchased locally, contained 5.7% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), corresponding to the typical free-chlorine level of 5 to 15%. the undiluted SaV had an infectious virus titer of 6 log10 TCID50/ml. the 10-fold-diluted SaV had an RNA titer of 9 log10 GE/ml. two concentrations of ethanol were prepared in autoclaved milli-Q water. the treated virus was serially diluted 10-fold (5.4% or 6.3% ethanol) and 100-fold (0.54% or 0.63% ethanol) in PBS to dilute ethanol to avoid further inactivation. samples from 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions were tested. each pair of samples included the virus+buffer+lettuce group. the virus+buffer group consisting of 100 l of culture supernatants diluted in buffer. lettuce in buffer without lettuce was tested as a mock control. RNA levels of porcine SaV and HuNoVs did not change after 30-min treatment compared to the levels for the controls. 30-min and 2-h treatments reduced infectious SaV by 2.38 0.18 and >4.00 0.53 log10 TCID50. porcine SaV and human noV/GII.4/HS194 strains were treated with two commonly used concentrations of ethanol (60% and 70%, vol/vol), mimicking the practical contact time for ethanol/alcohol disinfection. the treated samples were further diluted 100-fold immediately after experiments. porcine SaV and HuNoV GII.4/HS194 and GII.12/HS200 strains were treated with different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (2.5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/liter) at room temperature for 30 min. RT-qPCR results underestimated efficacy of ethanol disinfection of SaV. RT-qPCR results underestimated the efficacy of chlorine disinfection of SaV. porcine SaV and HuNoV GII.4/HS194 and GII.12/HS200 strains were incubated with different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (2.5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/liter) porcine SaV, FCV, and MNV showed different resistances to different physicochemical treatments. the resistances of the three viruses to heat treatment (56\u00b0C) were compared in parallel. after 2 h of incubation at 56\u00b0C, the infectious viral titers of all three viruses became undetectable. infectious SaV and MNV became undetectable after 60% ethanol treatment for 30 s at room temperature. FCV had a minor log10 reduction of 0.75 0.20. both SaV and MNV became undetectable when the ethanol concentration increased to 70%. the three viruses showed similar log10 reductions in virus titer following treatment with the two concentrations of NaOCl (P 0.05). the three viruses showed similar log10 reductions in virus titer following treatment with the two concentrations of NaOCl (Table 2). significant binding of SaV to lettuce occurred exclusively at pH 5.0. the binding proportion and 95% confidence level were both >50% (P 0.0002) after storage at 4\u00b0C for 1 week, the lettuce pieces still appeared fresh. virus+buffer group 0 3 3 2 1 2 No. in virus+buffer group no. in virus+buffer+lettuce group (no binding) 10 7 1 10 13 9 a Seven experiments, with three replicates per experiment. binding proportions (95% confidence levels) were as follows. 30-min and 2-h treatments reduced infectious SaV by 2.38 0.18 and >4.00 0.53 log10 TCID50, respectively. RT-qPCR results underestimated the efficacy of heat inactivation of SaV. porcine SaV and human noV/GII.4/HS194 strains were treated with two commonly used concentrations of ethanol (60% and 70%, vol/vol), mimicking the practical contact time for ethanol/alcohol disinfection. the treated samples were further diluted 100-fold immediately after experiments. porcine SaV and HuNoV GII.4/HS194 and GII.12/HS200 strains were treated with different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (2.5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/liter) the same phenomenon occurred when another normal human fecal suspension was used to dilute the SaV. porcine SaV and HuNoV GII.12/HS200 and GII.4/HS194 RNA became undetectable only after sodium hypochlorite concentrations were increased to 200 mg/liter. but the cell culture infectivity assay showed that SaV lost infectivity at the lowest concentration (2.5 mg/liter) of sodium hypochlorite. the resistances of the three viruses to heat treatment were compared in parallel. after incubation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min, MNV and SaV were detected at reduced titers (2.42 0.67 and 2.38 0.18 log10 reductions, respectively) compared to controls, and FCV was almost undetectable. undetectable and FCV was detected occasionally at very low levels (1.00 to 1.33 TCID50/50 l) both SaV and MNV became undetectable when the ethanol concentration increased to 70%, but FCV still had a minor log10 reduction of 0.91 0.27. compared the resistances of SaV, FCV, and MNV to chlorine treatments (2.5 mg/liter and 10 mg/liter of NaOCl) depending on pH, we incubated lettuce pieces and SaV in buffers with different pHs (3.0 to 8.0) at each pH, except for pH 7.0, the overall SaV titer of the virus+buffer group was higher than that of the virus+buffer+lettuce group. if the virus titer was higher than that of the virus+buffer+lettuce group, this indicated no binding of virus to lettuce. the initial virus concentration was 3.7 log10 TCID50/ml. for the virus+buffer group, titers with different numbers of asterisks differ significantly. virus titers at pH 5.0 and pH 3.0 were significantly higher and lower than those at pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 respectively (P 0.05) no significant differences in virus titers among buffers at pH 4.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. several culturable-but-not-ideal viruses have been used as noV surrogates to study virus disinfection. these viruses showed different resistances to physicochemical treatments compared to HuNoVs. however, compared to HuNoV, SaV was more resistant to 60% and 70% ethanol treatments. \u00b0C were in opposition to those reported earlier, in which it took 3.5 min and 6.7 min for MNV-1 and FCV, respectively, to achieve 1 log inactivations. the difference could be due to the different MNV strain (S7 strain) or the different period of incubation time (30 min and 2 h) that we used. RT-qPCR tends to underestimate disinfection efficacy compared to infection. RT-qPCR for virus disinfection studies has been recognized by many researchers (43) this is because most disinfection agents act on the capsid that protects the viral RNA, and in many cases, inactivation has little or no effect on the viral RNA. an infectious virus particle should possess an intact viral RNA genome. it should maintain its integrity to protect the RNA and attach to the receptor of a cell to initiate infection. other methods have been suggested, such as using histoblood group antigen (HBGA)-like immunomagnetic beads. porcine SaV bound significantly to lettuce leaves around its pI, but not at pH 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. the results suggest that near the pI, virions precipitate to form aggregates that may facilitate binding of virus to lettuce. porcine SaV and HuNoVs have similar resistances to low pH, high temperatures, and chlorine. it is likely that none of the three viruses can fully recapitulate the characteristics of HuNoV stabilities. several culturable-but-not-ideal viruses have been used as noV surrogates to study virus disinfection. these viruses showed different resistances to physicochemical treatments compared to HuNoVs. however, compared to HuNoV, SaV was more resistant to 60% and 70% ethanol treatments. FCV grows to 2 log10-higher infectious titers than MNV and SaV. RT-qPCR tends to underestimate disinfection efficacy compared to infectivity assays. inactivation treatments, such as pasteurization, cause little or no damage to the viral RNA. real-time PCR usually targets 150-nt fragments of the viral genome. real-time PCR usually targets 150-nt fragments of the viral genome. it likely underestimates inactivation efficiency. an infectious virus particle should possess an intact viral RNA genome. its capsid should maintain its integrity to protect the RNA and attach to the receptor of a cell to initiate infection. other methods that can detect RNA from intact viral particles have been suggested. porcine SaV bound significantly to lettuce leaves around its pI, at pH 5.0, but not at pH 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. results suggest that near the pI, virions precipitate to form aggregates that may facilitate binding of virus to lettuce. poliovirus was recoverable until day 7 (31), and coronavirus remained infectious for at least 14 days (34) one week in the refrigerator is the general storage time for lettuce. contamination is vital for prevention of food-borne NoV or SaV outbreaks."}
