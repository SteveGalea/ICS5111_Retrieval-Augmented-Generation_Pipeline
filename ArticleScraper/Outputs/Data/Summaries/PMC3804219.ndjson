{"summary": "human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) were identified in the 1960s. a third novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the causal agent during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses infection among different populations of Sao Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) from 2001 to 2010, we retrospectively looked for the presence of HCoVs in different populations of Sao Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) from 2001 to 2010, to assess the prevalence that HCoVs infections have on different groups of Brazilian patients. patients with a clinical diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) defined by the presence of respiratory symptoms who did not fulfill ILI definition were considered to have ARI. hospitalized patients suspected of 2009 H1N1 Influenza A infection presenting fever 38 \u00b0C, cough and dyspnea. one step RT-PCR assays were undertaken in a 50 L reaction volume containing 10 L RNA-extract, 10 L 5x QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 2 L dNTP mix. positive and negative controls were included in each PCR experiment. Specimens analyzed included 414 from nasopharyngeal swabs (Labor Swab Import, Brazil), 208 from nasal aspirations and 465 from nasal lavages. 50 adults attended by general-practice physicians among community population patients registered by the Medical Department Outpatient Office during 2001\u20132003. study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sao Paulo Federal University. amplification of a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene was performed. PCR-products were verified on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV-light. results Coronaviruses were detected in every month except January with a 20.3% peak on winter months (July) coronaviruses-positive cases were found from patients ranging in age from 2 months to 80 years, with a median age of 33 years. the majority (59%) was female. twenty percent of coronaviruses-infected patients presented underlying diseases other than cardiac and/or transplanted conditions. coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation, reported in 86%, 80% and 49% of positive cases. fever was less found among both renal and patients under stem cell transplantation program when compared with the other groups. 0 0 28.5 15.0 25.0 Headache 100.0 100.0 0 0 46.4 18.9 25.0 Diarrhea 0 0 0 0 2.6 25.0 Myalgia 83.3 90.9 9.0 0 32.1 17.9 25.0 Note. HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two group of patients. coronaviruses can display a typical biennial seasonality different than occur with other respiratory viruses. the prevalence of 11.5% found in our study corroborated with other research that identified coronaviruses as responsible for 10\u201330% of common colds and 0.3\u20139% associated with pneumonia. ing conditions other than cardiac/transplantation were observed among 20% of coronaviruses-infected patients. the higher prevalence of coronaviruses-infected cases found in specific at-risk group patients pointed to the relevance of coronaviruses causing respiratory tract illness."}
