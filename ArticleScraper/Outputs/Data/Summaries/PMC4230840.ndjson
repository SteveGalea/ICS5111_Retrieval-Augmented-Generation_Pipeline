{"summary": "infectious diseases remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity globally. approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses. the global economic burden due to zoonotic diseases is very high. potential losses from a pandemic influenza outbreak could be US$3 trillion. zoonoses are major obstacles to poverty alleviation, affecting 1,000,000,000 livestock keepers. zoonoses are a major concern globally, but impact in less developed countries is disproportionately high. 360 scientists from 35 nations met at the UN Conference Center in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) to inaugurate the first international Congress on pathogens at the human animal interface (ICOPHAI) recently, the second ICOPHAI held in porto de galinhas, Brazil, (14\u201317 August 2013) attracted representatives of academic institutions and organizations from 59 different countries that presented 278 high-quality scientific studies. key priority thematic areas that address One Health were presented. TB-complex mycobacteria were isolated at different rates (18%\u201382%) in wild animals. transboundary migration and migration across continents are additional risk factors that remain major means of transmission. the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double to nearly 800 million people by 2030. the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis among HIV/AIDS patients is often high. other parasitic microorganisms such as Cryptosporidium can be a source of debilitating, prolonged diarrhea in immunosuppressed patients. the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in all sectors including humans, veterinary care, and horticulture was stated as a key measure that needs to be taken towards prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance. the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in all sectors including humans, veterinary care, and horticulture was stated as a key measure that needs to be taken towards prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance. a strong laboratory network is a key component of any meaningful prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. an adequate surveillance system, including a strong laboratory network, is a key component of any meaningful prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. reexamination of how existing systems are structured, resourced, and managed. consumption, implementation, and genetics C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Japan, Ethiopia, US, and The Netherlands Government Implementation (4) 3 1 VPH use, biosecurity assessment, and health facility renovation/upgrading Bangladesh and Ethiopia One Health (6) 3 3 Development, implementation, strategies, VPH curriculum, and zoological parks Cameroon, Portugal, Scotland, and US Disease Surveillance and Outbreak Investigation (12) 3 9 Wildlife, livestock, Anthrax outbreak Bolivia, Ethiopia, Uganda, education and training in risk analysis and all aspects related to the application of sanitary and phytosanitary standards are highly needed. the systematic application of quality control systems following the WHO, FAO, and OIE guidelines are critical in ensuring risk management decisions. the development of capable diagnostic facilities is paramount for dealing with infectious diseases. there is a critical need for shorter, easier-to-deliver, safe, and low-cost antimicrobial regimens for resistant bacterial pathogens. congress delegates recognized that operationalizing One Health will enable collaborators to more effectively address and reduce the burden of zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide. the congress identified four areas for capacity-building needs, mainly directed at low-resource settings.
