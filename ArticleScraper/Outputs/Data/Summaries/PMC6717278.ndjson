{"summary": "THP-1 cells are an established model for studying HCMV latency and reactivation (16\u201319) IE1 and IE2 proteins were detected immediately after infection but decreased to levels below the limit of detection between 2 and 5 dpi. IE1 and IE2 are expressed during HCMV reactivation but do not arise from the MIEP. THP-1 cells were infected with TB40/E WT HCMV (MOI = 2). at day 5, cells were treated with TPA or a DMSO control. primer pair detects transcripts arising from the MIEP (transcript UTR136) (22) or the 5\u2032 distal promoter (dP) (23). the same primer pair readily detected abundant MIEP-derived transcripts during productive infection in fibroblasts. the absence of MIEP-derived transcripts following reactivation stimulus suggests that the re-expression of IE1 and IE2 is driven by alternative promoters. UL123 (IE1) and UL122 (IE2) transcripts derived from intronic promoters predominate following reactivation stimulus. the distal promoter (dP), the major immediate early promoter (MIEP), intronic promoter 1 (iP1), and intronic promoter 2 (iP2) give rise to transcripts encoding full-length IE1 and IE2. transcripts originating from iP1 and iP2 were predominately derived from iP2 between 1 and 5 dpi. iP2 transcripts were robustly induced following TPA treatment. iP1-derived transcripts increased after reactivation stimulus. the intronic MIE locus promoters are dispensable in fibroblasts for expression of lytic cycle transactivators and for virus replication. both iP1- and iP2-derived transcripts accumulated poorly following reactivation stimulus during iP1 infection. iP2-derived transcripts were detected at very low levels, if at all, in all infections. iP mutant viruses fail to express IE1 and IE2 following reactivation stimulus in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were infected with TB40/E WT, iP1, iP2 or iP(1 + 2) (MOI = 2) for 5 d. RNA was isolated, and RT-qPCR was performed to monitor accumulation of iP1-, iP2-, and MIEP/dP-derived transcripts relative to H primary CD34+ HPCs are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d cell type for modeling HCMV latency and reactivation in vitro. pure populations of infected (GFP+) CD34+ HPCs were seeded by extreme limiting dilution onto fibroblasts in a cytokine-rich media to promote differentiation and reactivation. viable CD34+ HPCs were seeded by limiting dilution onto monolayers of permissive fibroblasts in a cytokine-rich media to promote myeloid differentiation (reactivation, dark gray) an equivalent number of cells was mechanically lysed and seeded in parallel to determine the infectious virus present prior to reactivation. iP2-derived transcripts are the most abundant following TPA treatment in THP-1 cells. iP2-derived transcripts predominated following reactivation of WT virus. iP2-derived transcripts were detected at a low level even during latent period. IE1 and IE2 proteins accumulated rapidly following TPA treatment. the viral protein pUL138 (a suppressor of viral replication that promotes latency) (20, 21) is detected at 1 dpi and then re-expressed following the reactivation stimulus. the accumulation of UL123 and UL122 transcripts following infection and reactivation in THP-1 cells was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) the expression of UL123 and UL122 transcripts corresponded to protein levels at 1 dpi and following reactivation. iP-derived transcripts lack noncoding exon 1 found in MIEP-derived mRNAs but encode the complete set of distal exons necessary to synthesize full-length IE1 or IE2 proteins. iP1 and iP2 transcripts derived from intronic promoters predominate following reactivation stimulus. transcripts indicated were quantified relative to H6PD by RT-qPCR. welch\u2019s correction was used to account for unequal variance (*P value 0.05) iP1- and iP2-derived transcripts were predominately derived from iP2 between 1 and 5 dpi. recombinant viruses containing deletions surrounding the transcription start sites of iP1 (iP1), iP2 (iP2), or both iP1 and iP2 [iP(1 + 2)] replicated with similar kinetics and to similar peak titers as the parental wild-type (WT) virus. iP1- and iP2-derived transcripts accumulated poorly following reactivation stimulus during iP1 infection. the iP mutant virus infection also accumulated reduced levels of the early viral proteins pUL44 and pUL135, suggesting a global defect in re-expression of viral gene expression. the failure of the recombinant viruses to reactivate could not be attributed to a defect in maintenance of latent infection. PCR using primer pair specific to the noncoding 2.7 region of the HCMV genome relative to standard curve using the bacterial artificial chromosome clone of TB40/E. bars represent fold change over the number of viral genomes present at day 1 for each virus. the intronic promoters are required for reactivation of HCMV from latency in CD34+ HPCs. CD34+ HPCs were infected with TB40/E WT, iP1, iP2 or iP(1 + 2) expressing GFP as a marker for infection for 24 h. RT-qPCR was performed to quantify discrete MIE transcripts relative to H6PD. iP2-derived transcripts are the most abundant following TPA treatment in THP-1 cells. iP2-derived transcripts predominated following reactivation of WT virus. reactivation is driven by newly identified promoters within intron A of the MIE transcriptional locus (22). reactivation of these intronic promoters results in a striking defect in re-expression of viral genes and genome replication in the THP-1 and the primary CD34+ HPC model. the readout for reinitiation of viral gene expression in THP-1 cells is total IE protein in a pooled population of cells in which only 30 to 50% of the cells were initially infected. the extreme limiting dilution assay used to quantify the number of latently infected CD34+ cells required to produce viral progeny is of greater sensitivity and is inherently subject to more donor variability. iP-derived transcripts contain multiple alternative AUG translation start sites. such regulatory elements are common in viruses and appear to regulate translation in a similar manner. alternative promoters play an important role in tailoring gene expression for various cell lineages, tissue types, and developmental stages. potential mechanisms for promoter switching could include differences in the basal transcription machinery among different cell types, cell type-specific transcription factors, or epigenetic modifications to the viral genome. understanding the regulation of alternative promoters may pave the way for development of improved vaccines and gene therapy vectors. cells were cultured for 5 dpi in nontissue culture-treated 6-well plates. cells were pooled and centrifuged at 120 g for 7 min and then resuspended at 0.5 million cells per mL. cells from each experimental group were pooled and centrifuged at 120 g. at 24 hpi, viable CD34+ HPCs were seeded by limiting dilution onto monolayers of permissive MRC-5 fibroblasts. an equivalent number of CD34+ HPCs were mechanically disrupted and seeded in parallel to quantify infectious virus present prior to reactivation. cells were washed in PBS at 24 h post TPA/DMSO treatment. fresh media was added to the culture at 1 mL for every 0.5 million cells. cells that remained in suspension after 24 h of treatment were removed with 2 PBS washes. centers were quantified 14 d later by extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA)"}
