{"summary": "significant advancements in the field of molecular diagnostics have occurred since the first reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for detection of influenza virus was described in 1991 (131). Continual improvements in technology and assay chemistry have allowed development of molecular assays with high sensitivities and specificities. viral propagation in culture is also required for antiviral susceptibility testing using neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) assays. disadvantages of culture include delayed availability of results (3 to 14 days) and a significantly lower sensitivity. the R-Mix Too system combines the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A549 cell lines. they are excellent for isolation of respiratory viruses and have the advantage of not supporting the growth of the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. shell vial-based techniques with hybrid cell lines were widely used by a large number of laboratories that did not have access to molecular assays during the pandemic. serology is a valuable tool for conducting seroepidemiological studies. serology can help to establish a diagnosis of novel or seasonal influenza virus infections beyond the period when culture and/or PCR tests would be positive. a recent study used a combination of HAI and microneutralization titers (HAI titer of 20 and MN titer of 40) of a single convalescent-phase serum sample. the authors suggested that although useful for conducting large-scale seroprevalence studies, an HAI titer cutoff of 40 alone may therefore underestimate the number of 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus-infected persons. serologic assays have been and will continue to be used for antigenic characterization of circulating and novel influenza viruses. viral isolation remains an essential skill to be maintained and available in reference laboratories for antigenic characterization of circulating and novel influenza viruses. the R-Mix shell vial system combines a human adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) and mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) the shell vial system combines the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A549 cell lines. serology antibodies to influenza virus appear after 2 weeks and peak 4 to 7 weeks after infection. a 4-fold change or increase in influenza virus antibody titers in paired acute- and convalescent-phase samples obtained at least 2 weeks apart establishes the serologic diagnosis of influenza. serology can help establish a diagnosis of novel or seasonal influenza virus infections beyond the period when culture and/or PCR tests would be positive. an HAI assay titer of 40 has been associated with a 50% or more reduction in risk of influenza virus infection or disease in susceptible populations. a recent study reported a highest sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 96%, respectively, for adults under 60 years of age. serologic studies were critical for evaluating the immunogenicity of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A vaccines. serologic assays have been and will continue to be used for antigenic characterization of circulating influenza viruses. reported sensitivities (51, 121), their high specificities and positive predictive values during peak influenza season allow early confirmation, facilitate timely treatment decisions, and enable improved patient care. the high specificities of rapid tests were utilized advantageously during the pandemic to facilitate specific detection of influenza virus in patients presenting with clinically indistinguishable influenza. range from 20% to 90%, varying widely with the populations studied and with study methodologies. interstudy differences in the comparator gold standard used (PCR or culture), definitions of ILI used, duration of illness prior to collection of specimens, and differences in subtypes tested and rapid assays. low negative predictive values should also be taken into consideration when rapid tests are used in settings where significant transmission of influenza virus occurs. improvements in RIDT design that overcome these shortcomings will represent significant advances in POC diagnostics. a true increase in sensitivity may require inclusion of monoclonal antibodies with better coverage for the novel strain. rapid antigen tests currently available in the united states are designed to detect influenza A and B viruses, and some can further differentiate the two types. influenza A virus and absence of detection of seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 subtypes by this test led to subsequent testing that confirmed the unsubtypable strain to be a novel virus. the development of multiplex point-of-care assays that have the ability to subtype can clearly play a critical role in timely detection of novel strains. only 2 of the 5 CLIA-waived tests (QuickVue influenza A+B test and BinaxNOW influenza A&B test) can detect and distinguish between influenza A and B viruses. 1 (SAS FluAlert A) can detect both but not discriminate between influenza A and B viruses. development and availability of more CLIA-waived test kits will facilitate increased utilization of these tests. influenza A virus and other viruses representing all 16 HA subtypes, all 9 NA subtypes, and both of the currently circulating lineages of influenza B virus. successful development of such devices would be a significant advancement toward the goal of developing sensitive, rapid point-of-care devices. improvements in assay Sensitivity Sensitivities of rapid antigen assays have been shown to correlate directly with viral loads in clinical specimens. a pandemic subtype is using a monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus and antibodies to the nucleoproteins (NP) of the seasonal influenza A and B viruses. the development of rapid antigen assays that can differentiate influenza A and B viruses would be an important advancement in POC diagnostics for influenza. rapid antigen tests specifically detect the pandemic subtype (23, 81, 86) point-of-care assays that have the ability to subtype can clearly play a critical role in timely detection of novel strains and future pandemics. development and availability of more CLIA-waived test kits with better resolution of influenza virus types and subtypes will facilitate increased utilization of these tests. automation A significant disadvantage of currently available RIDTs is the subjective test output, making interpretation of weak positive results difficult for unskilled and even skilled test users. the majority of current assays are based on the PCR amplification format. advantages of PCR assays over more conventional viral culture-based diagnostics for influenza include significantly higher sensitivities and short turnaround times. subtyping of influenza A virus was not performed routinely by the majority of clinical laboratories. the goal of this subtyping was to ascertain the relative prevalence of subtypes circulating at the onset of each year's influenza epidemic. subtype determination assumed new levels of clinical and public health relevance and importance, varying with the different phases of the pandemic. the role of subtyping in future pandemics will be determined by qualitative (subtypes and antiviral susceptibilities) and quantitative (relative prevalence) characterization of influenza A viruses circulating nationwide in the spring and summer of 2009. the role of subtyping in future pandemics will be determined by the clinical spectrum, morbidity, and mortality associated with a novel virus. subtype-guided antiviral choices should be made carefully in context of pathogenicity and clinical profile of a novel virus. subtype-guided antiviral choices should be made carefully in context of pathogenicity and clinical profile of a novel virus. reassortment of currently circulating strains may continue to be detected by existing assays. subtyping can be valuable in several routine nonpandemic scenarios. ii) for characterizing strains that cause unusual, severe, or prolonged disease. open system platforms allow rapid development and implementation of new assays or modification of preexisting singleplex or multiplex assays. specific assays for detection of the pandemic subtype were developed and launched in several clinical laboratories with preexisting expertise for molecular testing within weeks of public availability of viral sequences. real-time systems have several advantages due to detection of amplicons in real time. xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) FDA-cleared assay. absence of detection of H1 and H3 subtypes was initially presumed to be indicative of the pandemic subtype. lack of H1/H3 signal was subsequently discerned as a result of mutations in the H3N2 strain resulting in failure of detection. influenza virus strains that falsely tested positive for the HA target were shown to have significantly higher fluorescence than pandemic H1 influenza virus. this report highlights the importance of extensive clinical evaluations of preexisting assays that do not specifically target a novel virus to discover such issues. limited availability of strains of the novel agent can be a significant problem. nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and, most recently, simple amplification-based assay (SAMBA) have been described (91, 105, 129, 132) loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based assays. the ability to detect SNPs makes it valuable not only as a diagnostic tool (with subtyping abilities) but also as one that facilitates surveillance for novel types and subtypes as well as ongoing mutations in the hemagglutinin gene. a recent study described a SAMBA using isothermal amplification and visual detection on a dipstick. the low sensitivities of these tests have been well documented to lead to significant health care burdens when the tests are used inappropriately. in recent years, few PCR-based systems have been developed and received FDA clearance for moderate complexity settings. real-time RT-PCR geneXpert Dx or GeneXpert Infinity system

of clinical laboratories. the goal of this subtyping was to ascertain the relative prevalence of subtypes circulating at the onset of each year's influenza epidemic. subtype determination assumed new levels of clinical and public health relevance and importance, varying with the different phases of the pandemic. elucidation of the clinical spectrum, epidemiology, and high-risk groups, and potential morbidity and mortality associated with the virus. subtype determination was critical for directing limited supplies of antivirals to the appropriately infected group of patients. in subsequent but still early phases of the pandemic, subtyping became less important and unnecessary for most non-high-risk outpatient clinical specimens. subtype-guided antiviral choices should be made carefully in the context of the pathogenicity and clinical profile of a novel virus. subtype-guided antiviral choices should be made carefully in the context of the pathogenicity and clinical profile of a novel virus, which may dictate the level of specificity required for diagnosis. type reassortment of currently circulating strains may continue to be detected by existing assays. subtyping can be valuable in several routine nonpandemic scenarios. subtyping can be valuable in several routine nonpandemic scenarios. subtype determination assumed new levels of clinical and public health relevance and importance. the need and role for influenza virus subtyping can be discussed in the context of (i) its role during the recent and future pandemics and (ii) its role in routine (nonpandemic) clinical situations. subtyping became less important and unnecessary for most non-high-risk outpatient clinical specimens. seasonal influenza virus was previously recognized to circulate at minimal levels between annual epidemics. higher levels were documented to be circulating nationwide in the spring and summer of 2009, likely a function of enhanced surveillance and testing volumes. strategy used by several laboratories is the detection of a conserved target to type influenza virus strains and a more variable target to specifically detect one or all of the circulating subtypes. the success of this strategy relies critically on the ability of the assay to detect the M target. the success of this strategy relies critically on the ability of the assay to detect the M target. unusually prolonged clinical illness and persistent viral shedding in non-high-risk group patients could indicate increasing virulence and/or development of resistance. subtype determination is recommended for specific situations such as during institutional outbreaks and infection control investigations. the role of subtyping in future pandemics will be determined by qualitative (subtypes and antiviral susceptibilities) and quantitative (relative prevalence) characterization of influenza A viruses circulating at the onset and subsequent phases of the pandemic. the role of subtyping in future pandemics will be determined by the clinical spectrum, morbidity, and mortality associated with a novel virus. the success of this strategy relies critically on the ability of the assay to detect the M target. this gene is the most conserved gene in the influenza virus genome, but mutations in the gene are well described. automation and high throughput are additional features that are highly desirable for molecular platforms in hospital-based clinical laboratories with large sample testing volumes. automation decreases hands-on technician time and steps and technical errors and facilitates additional runs and higher throughput. despite significant advancements in the field, few systems exist that allow fully automated and integrated molecular detection. open platform systems are of particular relevance for influenza diagnostics. these include the ability for quantitative detection, a shorter turnaround time, decreased technician time, and lowered risk of contamination due to detection without the need for postamplification steps. xTAG RVP test's package insert states that it can detect the matrix gene of 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus but cannot identify the hemagglutinin gene of this virus in clinical specimens. a retrospective review of raw data for all specimens positive for influenza A virus in clinical laboratory runs over a 7-month period (September 2009 to April 2010) showed that a small but significant number of patients (5%) with the 2009 pandemic virus had a positive or no-call result for the limited availability of strains of the novel agent can be a significant problem. limited availability of strains of the novel agent can be a significant problem. few laboratories have the capabilities and resources to develop their own molecular assays. several studies using clinical samples have shown comparable sensitivity and specificity to those of RT-PCR assays for influenza virus (95, 108) the method uses 2 or 3 pairs of primers that bind to 6 to 8 sites on viral cDNA and amplify nucleic acid under isothermal conditions. the total assay time ranges from 1 to 1.5 h. the method was evaluated using clinical samples and reported to have a sensitivity and specificity of 95.3% and 99.4%, respectively, using quantitative real-time PCR as the gold standard (130) it requires extraction of nucleic acid prior to amplification and detection, which adds to its complexity. amplification-based assays appear to have the potential to fill a long-needed niche for rapid point-of-care detection without compromising sensitivities and specificities. singleplex PCRs high Influenza A virus M gene, influenza B virus NS gene, and H1-, H3-, H5-specific HA genes. one-sample cartridges FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) system (Idaho

however, it does not specifically detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus. only 3 FDA-cleared molecular assays for influenza existed. a large number of assays (n = 16), the majority of which were manufacturer developed, gained EUA status from the FDA for use as IVDs for detection of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (45). the first of these EUAs, granted on 27 April 2009 for the use of the previously FDA-cleared CDC RT-PCR assay for detection of the novel virus, detected the influenza A virus M gene and specifically detected the HA genes of the seasonal H1 and H3 subtypes the EUA process put in place to facilitate a more expeditious validation certainly helped expand molecular testing capacity during the pandemic. only 4 of 16 EUA tests obtained FDA clearance for use as an IVD for detection of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus. only four have a CLIA classification of moderate complexity. these include the Verigene RVNATSP test (Nanosphere Inc., Northbrook, IL), the filmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) test system (Idaho Technology, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT), the Cepheid Xpert Flu assay (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and the Liat influenza A/B assay (Iquum Inc. the ability to launch laboratory-developed assays in a clinically useful time frame will be critically dependent on the availability of open platform systems. the ability to meet laboratory surge capacity during pandemics will require advancements in automation, multiplexing capability, and throughput. the first fully integrated and automated open platform system available for in-house development was the Jaguar system. BD Max6 system is a 2-color system that allows moderate-level multiplexing. it has the potential to allow significantly greater levels of multiplexing, again through its melt feature and more channels. there are other emerging technologies capable of high-level multiplexing (7, 91), but these are high-complexity and labor-intensive systems. the first fully integrated and automated open platform system available for in-house development was the Jaguar system (HandyLab Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), which became available in 2008. a laboratory-developed multiplex assay for influenza A and B viruses and RSV developed on this system was used to screen hundreds of samples a day in a large clinical laboratory early during the pandemic (3). the availability of technologies that can be used to develop and modify laboratory-developed assays for novel pathogen detection in a clinically useful time frame will be of increasing importance. despite nationwide surveillance being in place, the 2009 pandemic strain is estimated to have circulated unrecognized for weeks (96) before its detection. the recent pandemic demonstrated the excellent collaboration between private and public health laboratories. assays developed in local sentinel laboratories were validated by state laboratories within days after the emergence of the pandemic in communities. delays in testing and reporting results can lead to significant underrepresentation of influenza activity at a regional level. ared influenza assays can vary in performance characteristics for detection of a novel strain. the first case of the novel influenza virus infection was diagnosed by an investigational rapid antigen test during a clinical study in southern California, not at a sentinel PCR surveillance site. early detection is critical to containment and reduction of morbidity and mortality during a pandemic. assays developed in local sentinel laboratories were validated by state laboratories within days after the emergence of the pandemic in communities. this allowed accurate reporting of numbers of positive patients by public health officials by including results from private local laboratories. delays in testing and reporting results can lead to significant underrepresentation of influenza activity at a regional level, particularly during outbreaks of a novel virus. four antiviral drugs are currently licensed and approved for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections. oseltamivir and zanamivir are active against both influenza A and B viruses. the drugs differ in their routes of administration, age groups they are approved for. the 2005-2006 season led to the recommendation that these drugs no longer be used for prophylaxis or treatment of influenza (19). a sudden and unexplained increase in H1N1 resistance to oseltamivir, from 0.7% in the 2006-2007 season to 10.9% in the 2007-2008 and >99% of strains circulating in the 2008-2009 influenza season, necessitated reinstitution of this class in the 2008-2009 season to combination treatment regimens. antiviral susceptibility testing is not routinely available in clinical laboratories. this significant temporal variation in prevalence of resistance to the limited antiviral medications available for influenza has important public health and clinical ramifications. testing of viral isolates alone without matching clinical specimens has the potential to overestimate resistance, as discussed below. the decision to implement routine influenza virus antiviral resistance testing in clinical laboratories would best be made in the context of local molecular epidemiology of influenza. 1N1 isolates, from 1% (n = 1,753) to 28% (n = 25) of isolates studied during 3 consecutive influenza seasons from 2007 to 2009. the use of an adamantane for prophylaxis or treatment in the subset of patients who were infected with such strains with adamantane or dual antiviral resistance would be ineffective and have the potential to further select resistant subpopulations. zanamavir is currently available only via a compassionate care protocol. a recent study showed a remarkably high prevalence of oseltamivir resistance (33%) in immunocompromised patients (n = 12), with more than half of the resistant viruses being detected at early time points. the availability of sensitive and specific antiviral susceptibility tests with rapid turnaround would be of great value to clinicians for optimizing management of influenza in these select clinical populations. testing a small subset of all influenza virus-positive samples over the course of a season in clinical or local public health laboratories would likely better reflect local resistance trends and optimize antiviral usage. the NA enzyme inhibition assay is the traditional method for detecting influenza virus resistance and uses cell culture-grown virus. the endpoint outcome (reduced susceptibility or resistance) can be ascertained regardless of the molecular pathogenesis of such resistance. erroneous interpretation of influenza A virus isolates as NAI resistant for patients with mixed influenza A and B virus infections. the sensitivities of phenotypic assays are lower than those of molecular assays, with 25% resistant mutants required for a significant increase in IC50. improvements in the sensitivities of NA enzyme inhibition assays themselves have been described recently, through improvements in curve fitting analyses that can lead to sensitivities comparable to that of pyrosequencing (30). assays for detection of molecular markers of resistance use sequencing or PCR technologies to identify known or novel markers rapid sensitive quantitative detection makes this technology particularly valuable for antiviral resistance testing in a clinical context. antiviral-resistant mutants can vary from being minor to being dominant in clinical specimens over the course of prolonged infections. pyrosequencing has demonstrated sensitive detection of resistant mutants present at 10% in viral mixtures. the significance of this limit of detection remains to be determined. the clinical relevance of various proportions of sensitive and resistant viral populations in any given patient is unknown. real-time RT-PCR assays reliably detected mixed populations at percentages down to 0.1% H274Y variant component or 1% wild-type component in viral nucleic acid extracts. assays with such excellent analytical sensitivities offer the advantage of detecting mutations in samples with viral loads that are too low to be detected by pyrosequencing. resistance in the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus remains rare (1%) zanamivir resistance has been reported rarely, with just one resistant influenza B virus reported for a zanamivir-treated immunocompromised patient (52, 53) the role of antiviral susceptibility testing in routine clinical testing would benefit from continued discussion. four antiviral drugs are currently licensed and approved for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections. oseltamivir and zanamivir are active against both influenza A and B viruses. the drugs differ in their routes of administration, age groups they are approved for. a sudden and unexplained increase in H1N1 resistance to oseltamivir, from 0.7% in the 2006-2007 season to 10.9% in the 2007-2008 and >99% of strains circulating in the 2008-2009 influenza season. the decline in adamantane resistance in H1N1 viruses to 0.4% and continued high levels of resistance (99.8%) in H3N2 viruses, the predominant subtype in circulation that year, precluded adamanta antiviral susceptibility testing is not routinely available in clinical laboratories. it is important to consult regional and national influenza surveillance data on types and subtypes of influenza viruses circulating at a given time. this surveillance is conducted by the CDC, using specimens submitted from various national sites. the decision to implement routine influenza virus antiviral resistance testing in clinical laboratories would best be made in the context of local molecular epidemiology of influenza. some epidemiologic and clinical scenarios that would warrant a closer look at the advantages and role of resistance testing. 28% of isolates studied during 3 consecutive influenza seasons from 2007 to 2009. the use of an adamantane for prophylaxis or treatment in the subset of patients who were infected with such strains with dual antiviral resistance would be ineffective. some epidemiologic patterns can be envisioned to better indicate routine testing than others. zanamavir is currently available only via a compassionate care protocol. a recent study showed a remarkably high prevalence of oseltamivir resistance (33%) in immunocompromised patients (n = 12), with more than half of the resistant viruses being detected at early time points in the course of infections. the availability of sensitive and specific antiviral susceptibility tests would be of great value to clinicians for optimizing management of influenza in these select clinical populations. testing a small, predefined subset of all influenza virus-positive samples over the course of a season in clinical or local public health laboratories would likely better reflect local resistance trends and optimize antiviral usage. clade 2B was adamantane susceptible and oseltamivir resistant. clade 2C was adamantane resistant and oseltamivir resistant. clade 2C was adamantane resistant and oseltamivir resistant. clinical situations that would greatly benefit from timely antiviral susceptibility results include cases of severely ill patients with poor clinical responses and prolonged viral shedding while on antivirals and immunocompromised patients. zanamavir is the only antiviral class available for currently circulating strains. detection of resistance would greatly facilitate timely changes in antiviral therapy in such cases. some places use CT values from real-time PCR runs as a surrogate to follow viral loads, with a decrease of 3 CT values indicating an increase of 1 log in viral load. currently available influenza virus PCR assays are not valid for quantitative purposes. resistance is particularly prone to such evolution given its association with a surface protein. Enhanced sampling on a local level would help to monitor any evolution in resistance patterns and provide an opportunity to detect and control the spread of any emergent resistant strains. quasispecies that could affect IC50s in functional assays would be important in using this assay. the method remains an essential technique for determining the role of any novel mutations identified by sequencing of samples obtained from patients suspected to have antiviral resistance. however, confirmation of its role as a marker of resistance would require phenotypic studies. pyrosequencing can reliably, accurately, and quantitatively detect mutants present at as low as 5 to 10% prevalence in mixed viral populations. pyrosequencing can reliably, accurately, and quantitatively detect mutants present at as low as 50% prevalence in mixed viral populations. pyrosequencing-based assays have clinical and phenotypic significance. further studies to optimize drug doses for prophylaxis and treatment would have the potential to advance the current knowledge and management of antiviral resistance in influenza virus. real-time RT-PCR assays can detect mutations in samples with viral loads that are too low to be detected by pyrosequencing. a novel Q136K mutation in the NA gene was identified in 9 prepandemic H1N1 virus isolates but not in their original specimens. isance to all 4 NAIs tested was noted by pyrosequencing for viruses propagated in MDCK cells but not in matching clinical specimens (101). this discrepant detection in isolates but not clinical specimens suggests that the variants either occurred in very small proportions in the primary clinical specimens, below the limits of detection of pyrosequencing (5 to 10%), or reflected genetic variability introduced during passage in culture (100). the role of antiviral susceptibility testing in routine clinical testing would benefit from continued discussion. one approach may be to do targeted enhanced surveillance of resistance in high-risk populations (children, immunocompromised patients, and those with underlying respiratory morbidity) assays for detection of molecular markers of resistance are lower than molecular assays, with 25% resistant mutants required for a significant increase in IC50. the method remains an essential technique for determining the role of any novel mutations identified by sequencing of samples obtained from patients suspected to have antiviral resistance. pyrosequencing can reliably, accurately, and quantitatively detect mutants present at as low as 5 to 10% prevalence in mixed viral populations. the technology is used to identify and detect molecular markers of antiviral resistance in seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses (6, 32), H5N1 virus (33), 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (31), and influenza B viruses (115). minor resistant populations identified early in the course of infections are shown to have clinical and phenotypic significance. further studies to optimize drug doses for prophylaxis and treatment would have the potential to advance the current knowledge and management of antiviral resistance in influenza virus. pyrosequencing-based assay design requires prior knowledge of the locations of mutations. real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of the H275Y (in N1 numbering) mutation that is associated with oseltamivir resistance. a potential feature of real-time RT-PCR assays is their increased sensitivity over that of pyrosequencing assays. mutation on NAI susceptibility and conferred cross-resistance to all 4 NAIs tested was noted by pyrosequencing for viruses propagated in MDCK cells but not in matching clinical specimens (101). this discrepant detection in isolates suggests that the variants either occurred in very small proportions in the primary clinical specimens, below the limits of detection of pyrosequencing (5 to 10%), or reflected genetic variability introduced during passage in culture (100). the role of antiviral susceptibility testing in routine clinical testing would likely benefit from continued discussion. one approach may be to do targeted enhanced surveillance of resistance in high-risk populations. pyrosequencing has emerged as a useful sequencing technique in recent years. rapid sensitive quantitative detection makes this technology particularly valuable for antiviral resistance testing in a clinical context. rapid detection of resistant mutants directly in clinical specimens would enable timely therapeutic changes. additional advantages include (iv) automation and the capacity for high throughput. pyrosequencing has demonstrated sensitive detection of resistant mutants present at 10% in viral mixtures. the significance of this limit of detection remains to be determined. the clinical relevance of various proportions of sensitive and resistant viral populations in any given patient is unknown. a recent study described the development of a real-time PCR assay that reliably detected mixed populations at percentages down to 0.1% H274Y variant component or 1% wild-type component in viral nucleic acid extracts. assays with such excellent analytical sensitivities offer the advantage of detecting mutations in samples with viral loads that are too low to be detected by pyrosequencing. resistance in the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus remains rare (1%) all resistant isolates analyzed to date have been reported to have the H275Y mutation. zanamivir resistance has been reported rarely, with just one resistant influenza B virus reported for a zanamivir-treated immunocompromised patient (52, 53)"}
