{"summary": "a respiratory focus is a common presentation for patients with severe combined immunodeficency (SCID) a two-month-old male infant of nonconsanguineous Mexican Mennonite descent presented to a rural hospital for respiratory distress treated with nebulized budesonide. he was readmitted two months later with respiratory distress and failure to thrive. he was afebrile, with an arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on 0.25 L/min of oxygen. significant examination findings included tachypnea (respiratory rate 50 to 60 breaths/min), with tracheal tug and intercostal indrawing. a two-month-old boy of nonconsanguineous Mexican Mennonite descent was seen for an apneic spell, cyanosis and increased work of breathing. he was discharged without any home oxygen requirements and returned with fever, cough and increased work of breathing. family history revealed eight infant deaths from \u2018fungal infections\u2019. bloodwork showed hemoglobin level of 88 g/L, a white blood cell count of 5.2109/L, neutrophils 5109/L, lymphocytes 1.2109/L and a platelet count of 480109/L. the patient was started on high-dose trimethprim-sulfamethoxazole. an immunodeficiency evaluation revealed an undetectable IgA level of 0.05g/L. bloodwork revealed a hemoglobin level of 101 g/L, a white blood cell count of 10.8109/L, neutrophils 5.06109/L, lymphocytes 3.76109/L and platelet count of 480109/L. a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for entero/rhino/metapneumovirus. an immunodeficiency workup revealed an undetectable immunoglobulin (Ig) A level 0.04 g/L (normal range 0.05 g/L to 1.20 g/L), a very low IgG level of 0.99 g/L (normal range 2.80 g/L to 16.0 g/L) and normal IgM 0.19 g/L (normal range 0.14 g/L to 1.40 g/L) a two-month-old family history revealed eight infant deaths from 'fungal infections' none of these infants had received a formal diagnosis of SCID. the parents were from the same Mexican Mennonite colony. genetic testing found a homozygous mutation in the CD3 delta gene that confirmed the etiology of SCID. more than 10 gene mutations involving cytokine receptors, antigen receptors, intracellular signalling and T cell apoptosis have been identified to be causative for SCID. the invasive procedure of a thymic biopsy can be used to demonstrate the dysplastic nature of a SCID thymus. patients with SCID typically have low to absent TREC, making it a more sensitive marker than the overall lymphocyte count of a complete blood count for detecting SCID. the current literature almost exclusively describes the status of NBS for SCID in the united states. however, with the recent implementation of NBS for SCID in Ontario in 2013, it will be interesting to follow the outcomes of this novel Canadian program. one month post-transplant, he deteriorated with an aggressive human metapneumovirus infection and died at 9.4 months of age. his respiratory status continued to deteriorate, with respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus infection. the patient died at 3.4 months of age. a low lymphocyte count (2000/L) can be helpful as well in making the diagnosis. as many as 20% of patients with SCID can have a normal lymphocyte count."}
