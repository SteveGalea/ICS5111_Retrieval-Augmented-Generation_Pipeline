{"summary": "antibiotic resistance is on the rise, and newly emerging infectious diseases have become so important that the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention publishes a journal under this name. when a multiantibiotic-resistant emerging pathogen causes an outbreak, several infectious agents could have been linked to a food source. the enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype O157:H7 serotype showed this food link. a total of 3,842 cases were reported, including 2,987 cases of laboratory-confirmed E. coli gastroenteritis with 18 deaths. 855 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) led to 35 fatal outcomes. the outbreak started on may 8, peaked on May 22, and was declared finished by July 4. all 31 cases that could be interviewed had consumed uncooked sprouts (11) a sprout producer in lower Saxony, germany, was infected with the epidemic strain O104:H4. a seed supplier could be linked to 15 cases of O104:H4 infections in Bordeaux, france. bacteria in the VBNC state do not grow on microbiological media but regain cultivability when resuscitated after stress relief. there is so far no direct evidence that E. coli O104:H4 is found in the VBNC state in nature. the first analyzed genome sequence was from the University of G\u00f6ttingen. 454 DNA libraries were sequenced with the Genome Sequencer Flex system. data from the Ion Torrent sequencing system (51) and a data obtained using PacBio RS DNA sequencers (71). the two prophages in the sequenced O104:H4 strain C227-11 shared sequence identity over two-thirds of their lengths. only the prophage inserted in chromosomal gene wbrA contained the stx2a gene. the high degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the prophages suggests a horizontal gene transfer event. the sequencing of strains from the pathogen was carried out in a community-wide approach using the internet in a creative way. the annotation of the sequenced genomes from the pathogen was conducted in a community-wide approach using the internet in a creative way. this approach elicited curiosity-driven analyses from four continents. the largest and most relevant is the HUSEC collection. the collection includes 524 hemolytic uremic syndrome-associated enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains. no O157:H7 strains were detected in cattle feces. classical STEC was found in one-quarter of the animals. a number of virulence factors have been described for EAEC strains. virulence factors include adhesins (e.g., aggregative adherence fimbriae [AAF/I to -III]), heat-stable enterotoxin, transporters, and other secreted proteins (e.g., the serine protease autotransporter Pic, which has mucinase activity). virulence genes from stx2 and long polar fimbriae (LPF) and EAEC strains (AAF/I, AggR transcription regulator, dispersin Aap, Pic protein, and Shigella enterotoxin Set1) (7). the latter are mostly carried on the virulence plasmid pAA (10) phages are morphologically and genetically very heterogeneous (30, 56), but all conserve a genetic organization similar to phage lambda. all carry the stx operon downstream of the phage late genes (41). stx expression is under the control of the late genes (63). stx expression is under the control of the late genes (63). transduction and not phage conversion could have happened within the intestine of humans (8). infectious Stx phages are also found in several extraintestinal environments (fecally polluted water, soil, commercially purchased vegetables, or minced meat) pic is a serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) proteins. some EAEC strains cause mucus hypersecretion (reminiscent of the mucoid diarrhea induced by Shigella) pic promotes intestinal colonization in streptomycin-treated mice. s. Shiga toxins interact via subunit B with their cellular receptor (Gb3 [globotriaosylceramide]) in the host cell, the Stx A-subunit cleaves the rRNA at a specific position. this leads to the inactivation of the protein machinery and results in cell death. a group selected a specific human monoclonal antibody against the A subunit of Shiga toxin 2 in piglets infected with O157:H7 (83) piglets developed diarrhea followed by fatal neurological symptoms, while 85% of the antibody-treated piglets survived the infection. a human monoclonal antibody was applied in the recent german outbreak. 77 patients were given Eculizumab (77) for a disease with related pathophysiology (thrombotic thrompocytopenic purpura), plasma exchange is an efficient treatment. this treatment mode was also tried during the recent outbreak in five adults with HUS. no significant difference was seen between the oral receptor decoy and the placebo group for primary and secondary outcome variables. a pyrrolidin derivative inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase and thus reduces the Gb3 receptor level in kidneys. a mutation in the recA gene is a critical gene for SOS induction of Stx2 toxin production. the use of antibiotics for the management of human infection is controversial. antibiotic treatment significantly increased the risk of developing HUS. bifidobacterium breve prevented lesions in the ileum, kidney, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. different species of bifidobacteria differed in their protective properties. phage cocktail lysed the cells from the outside without infecting the cells. phages lysed the food items when maintained at refrigeration, but not at room temperature. meat contaminated with moderately high O157 counts was freed from food pathogen by phage application. enterocin from Enterococcus faecalis showed weak activity against O157:H7 on soybean sprouts (15). a weak although statistically significant reduction was seen when antagonistic E. coli was given at a high dose (80). a group of investigators developed a concept that is halfway between bacteriocins and phages: R-type pyocins (81). placebo-treated piglets developed diarrhea followed by fatal neurological symptoms. 85% of the antibody-treated piglets survived the infection. clinical trials have not yet been conducted with antibodies against Shiga toxins. the neurological symptoms improved significantly in a prospective noncontrolled trial. a pyrrolidin derivative inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase and thus reduces the Gb3 receptor level in kidneys. the smallest, safest, and cheapest Stx inhibitor is zinc. zinc reduced fluid secretion, mucosal adherence, villus blunting, and Stx toxin production. antibiotics induced the bacterial SOS response. a prospective cohort study of 71 children hospitalized with O157:H7 diarrhea showed a decrease in intestinal pathogen count, weight gain, and less kidney damage than seen in infected controls. bifidobacterium breve prevented body weight decrease and death (0% versus 90% in the infection control) compared a Bifidobacterium longum strain that showed protective activity in an O157:H7 mouse disease model with a Bifidobacterium adolescentis strain that lacked this trait. the authors then analyzed what factors prevented the translocation of Stx2 into the blood. one specific transporter mutant showed less acetate production in the gut and partial loss of protection. only low fecal titers of phages were seen in steers that received phage orally. oral T4-like coliphage in sheep reduced the O157 counts in the cecum and rectum (72) but no influence of orally applied phage on the fecal O157 titer was observed. pyocins kill target cells by binding to the cell and punching a hole into the cell envelope. this hybrid pyocin killed O157:H7 in vitro and degraded the O157-specific O-antigen (LPS)"}
