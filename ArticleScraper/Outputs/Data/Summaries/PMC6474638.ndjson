{"summary": "inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes responsible for caspase-1 activation. caspase-1 proteolytically cleaves interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 precursors (pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18), leading to the release of mature forms. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a two-step process. studies investigating the role of NLRP3 inflammasome have yielded controversial results [17\u201320], leading to the conclusion that NLRP3 inflammasome might play a dual protective or detrimental role at different stages of influenza A virus infection. this virus is one of the leading causes of respiratory tract disease in both children and adults. this multiprotein complex exerts a deleterious effect during HMPV infection in mice by triggering IL-1 release. targeting NLRP3 inflammasome as well as IL-1 may be of interest for the development of new therapeutics against HMPV infections. NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers IL-1 and IL-18 production in THP-1 and J774.2 cells. THP-1 cells were differenciated into macrophages using PMA (100 ng/ml) the viral titers were determined by immunostaining. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protects mice against HMPV disease. NLRP3 inflammasome plays a detrimental role during HMPV infection. no mortality and a less important weight loss were observed in mice. mice inoculated with NLRP3 inflammasome at sublethal or LD50 doses showed no difference in lung viral titers between MCC950-treated and control groups. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition attenuates inflammation in HMPV-infected mice. IL-18 levels were not different between MCC950-treated and DMSO-treated mice. by contrast, IL-1 levels in HMPV-infected mice were significantly decreased upon MCC950 treatment. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition also reduced the alteration of pulmonary capillary permeability and leukocyte recruitment. mice were inoculated with HMPV at sublethal (3 x 105) or LD50 doses (5 x 105 PFU per mouse) NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protects mice against HMPV disease by exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. IL-18 levels were unaltered during in vivo infection. no difference in survival and weight loss between IL-18BP-treated and non-treated mice was observed during HMPV infection. NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HMPV. IL-1-/- and C57BL/6 (IL-1+/+) mice were inoculated with HMPV at a LD50 dose (2 x 106 PFU per mouse) the animals were monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days. IL-1+/+ mice showed less weight loss and mortality compared to IL-1+/+ mice without MCC950 treatment on day 5 post-infection. other parameters including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, IL-18, leukocyte differentiation and viral replication did not differ between IL-1+/+ and IL-1+/+ mice. caspase-1 was detected in both cell lysates and supernatants at 1 h. was only present in the cell supernatants at 24 h post-infection. this indicates that caspase-1 was rapidly cleaved and released into the supernatants. no difference in IL-1 and TNF- levels as well as leukocyte differentiation was observed on day 5 between HMPV SH- and HMPV-infected mice. however, a significant decrease of IL-1 was seen on day 1 in the HMPV SH group. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and SH protein deletion attenuated inflammation and lung injury. mice were inoculated or not with HMPV at a LD50 dose (5 x 105 PFU per mouse) the animals were monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days. the animals were monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days. NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers IL-1 and IL-18 production in HMPV-infected THP-1 and J774.2 cells but has no effect on the viral replication. NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers IL-1 and IL-18 production in HMPV-infected THP-1 and J774.2 cells. the viral titers were determined by immunostaining. values were shown as mean S.E.M (unpaired Student t-test, n = 5 per group per experiment) no IL-1 was detected in NLRP3 KO BMDM cells following HMPV infection. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protects mice against HMPV disease. oculated with HMPV at sublethal or LD50 doses (5 x 105 PFU per mouse) mice inoculated with NLRP3 inflammasome showed no difference in lung viral titers. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition attenuates inflammation in HMPV-infected mice. interferon (IFN)-, IL-6, and TNF- levels in BAL were significantly decreased upon MCC950 treatment. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition also reduced the alteration of pulmonary capillary permeability and leukocyte recruitment. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition protects mice against HMPV disease by exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. this anti-inflammatory effect seems to be virus dose-dependent. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition decreased more efficiently inflammatory parameters in the case of sublethal dose than LD50 dose of virus. NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of HMPV. mice were inoculated with IL-18BP at a lethal dose (106 PFU per mouse) mice were monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days after infection and euthanized if humane end points were reached. MCC950 treatment was repeated for the next two days (1 time/day) the animals were monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days after infection and euthanized if humane end points were reached. values are shown as mean S.E.M or average percent survival. NF-, IL-18, leukocyte differentiation and viral replication did not differ between IL-1+/+ mice, IL-1-/- and IL-1+/+ treated with MCC950 mice. the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of HMPV seems to predominantly occur via IL-1 secretion. THP-1 cells were differenciated into macrophages using PMA. at 1 or 24 h post-infection, cell lysates and supernatants were harvested. no difference in viral replication between HMPV and HMPV SH was observed. lack of SH protein promotes attenuated pathogenicity of HMPV. THP-1 cells were differenciated into macrophages using PMA (100 ng/ml) and then infected or not with HMPV or HMPV SH. the lungs and BAL were harvested on day 5 post-infection. IFN-, IL-6, total protein and leukocyte recruitment were evaluated in the lungs. the contribution of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses occurs through its role as a trigger of only inflammation [12, 15, 18, 19] or both inflammation and viral replication [9, 10, 16, 17, 37] this finding is consistent with two other studies which have also shown that NLRP3 inflammasome did not impact on viral replication during influenza and chikungunya diseases [21, 38] NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for the secretion of only IL-1 and IL-18 in infected cells. inhibition decreased levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF- and IFN- in infected mice. inflammatory parameters including alteration of pulmonary capillary permeability, leukocyte recruitment and lung histopathological scores also decreased upon NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition was found to decrease IL-6 and IFN- levels in BAL from BALB/c mice. IL-6, IFN- and TNF- levels in BAL from BALB/c mice were strongly higher than those from C57BL/6 mice on day 5 post-infection. IL-18 secretion was unaltered during infection and had no influence on the pathogenicity of HMPV in mice. polymorphonuclear neutrophils were abundant on day 1 and lymphocytes were dominant on days 3 and 5 post-infection. NLRP3 inflammasome activation generally employs a two-step mechanism. RNA viral components responsible for triggering this pathway have been identified in several viral infections such as influenza virus M2 and PB1-F2 proteins [53\u201355], measles virus V protein [56], RSV SH protein [39], encephalomyocarditis virus and rhinovirus 2B proteins (57, 58), coronavirus E protein [59] and enterovirus 71 3D protein [60]. the evolution of HMPV infections was not different between HMPV SH- and wild-type HMPV-infected mice receiving MCC950 treatment. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition had no influence on the pathogenesis of HMPV SH. mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in animal research facility. mice were anaesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane vaporized. individual body weight and clinical signs were used to monitor animal health and response to infection. the recombinant HMPV strain C85473 SH were grown in LLC-MK2 cells. titers were expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. full-length genomic cDNA of HMPV A1/C-85473 strain was generated by RT-PCR using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase and amplified by Phusion DNA polymerase. plasmid was amplified using specific primers designed to match before the SH gene start sequence (5\u2019-GGGACAAGTAGTTATGGA-3\u2019) MEM supplemented with 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids. transfected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for four days. cell lysates and supernatants were harvested at 1; 24; 48 and 72 h. BMDM iWT and iNLRP3KO cells in 24-well plates were washed in PBS and inoculated with Opti-MEM (mock), wild-type HMPV or SH HMPV at a MOI of 0.1 in Opti-MEM + 0.0002% trypsin. after 3 h adsorption at 37\u00b0C, inocula were removed and changed by fresh cell culture medium DMEM high glucose + 10% FBS and to block NLRP3 inflammasome activation, MCC950 (5 mg/kg) [21, 71] was mixed and administered intranasally. DMSO (Sigma Aldrich) served as control. this treatment was repeated once a day for two consecutive days during infections. for differential cell counts, 100 l of suspended cells were spun onto a slide. slides were then air-dried and stained with may-Grunewald Giemsa solutions. results were expressed as picogram per milliliter of BAL. cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature. supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed twice with D-PBS plus 2% FBS. cells were first incubated on ice for 30 min with fixable viability stain 510. the concentrations of protein in cell lysates and supernatants were determined using Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay. equal protein amounts were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked using 5% BSA (Sigma Aldrich) primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat (R&D systems) or 1:5,000 HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mous scores represent consensus between the two observers. results were expressed as lung total inflammatory scores. survival data were analyzed using log-rank test. vaporized at concentrations of 3\u20134% and oxygen flow rate adjusted to 1.5 l/min. individual body weight and clinical signs were used to monitor animal health. mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation upon loss of 20% of initial body weight. the recombinant HMPV strain C85473, a clinical isolate, and the recombinant HMPV strain C85473 SH were grown in LLC-MK2 cells. titers were determined by immunostaining and expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. plasmid was amplified using specific primers designed to match before the SH gene start sequence. linear DNA was phosphorylated and ligated with the T4 Ligase. the newly generated HMPV SH genomic plasmid was validated by complete sequencing prior to transfection. in vitro viral infections J774.2 or THP-1 cells were treated with 10 M of MCC950 [26] and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. the cells were then inoculated with wild-type HMPV or HMPV SH at a MOI of 0.001. in vivo viral infections, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and IL-18 inhibition A preliminary study has been carried out to determine the sublethal, LD50 and lethal doses of virus in mice.
