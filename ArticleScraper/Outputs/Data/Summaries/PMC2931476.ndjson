{"summary": "deliberative forums were carried out with members of the south Australian community. participants allocated scarce resources of antiviral drugs and pandemic vaccine. participants were divided on the acceptability of social distancing and quarantine measures. a second significant aspect of national pandemic planning is the use of isolation, quarantine and social distancing measures. these measures, along with heightened hygiene compliance, appear to be amongst the very limited tools available to buy the time needed to produce and distribute an effective vaccine [3-5] deliberative inclusive processes have been proposed as an anticipatory tool. policy makers may question the validity of citizen-driven decisions when the citizens have limited access to information to adequately inform those decisions. a small representative sample of the population can deliberate with conscience and arrive at a decision which is informed, but also reflective of community values. forum 1 met for one-day whereas forum 2 was over 2 days. only forum 1 and the second day of forum 2 are reported here. participants were asked to assume that the influenza virus would cause moderate case morbidity across age groups and moderate case mortality. in pandemics, the usual epidemiology of flu may be reversed, so young adults get more disease than the elderly. participants were asked to deliberate using a series of six scenarios. if she goes into quarantine voluntarily she will be unable to work for up to seven days and it may be longer if she becomes ill. if she goes into quarantine she will be unable to work for up to seven days. the premier has closed all schools and childcare services in the state. families are placed on a roster to provide care for up to 15 children. the arrangement continues for about four weeks until the busiest part of the sowing season is over. forum participants were based on systematic reviews summarising available evidence about pandemic influenza containment and management strategies. a forum with 9 participants, which was older and with more females (n = 6) than males (n = 3) the distribution of demographic identifiers for forum 1 was similar to that for forum 2. one person on her flight developed a fever on the flight, but it is not yet known if the person is infected with the pandemic strain of influenza. her husband is still travelling and Miriam knows there is no food in the house. her religion requires that the body be buried within 24 hours. the Premier is considering closing schools. year 12 exams are in five weeks. health care workers, researchers and laboratory staff dealing with pandemic influenza. people aged 2-30, police and prison staff, paramedics and emergency response personnel. groups that would be in high demand for their services in a pandemic ranked as socially interactive. PI = pandemic influenza The forum quickly realised that the numbers in these groups were more than could possibly be covered by the limited stockpiles then available. the forum discarded vulnerable groups such as asylum seekers and those considered peripheral to the preservation of society. the forum regarded the military as a useful resource which could assist with policing, medical and paramedical services, transport, essential services, chaplaincy and crude manpower and logistical support. some of the participants were not entirely comfortable with the choices they had to make under the constraint of limited resources. forum members were reassured that the Government had made preparations. but were concerned that they were neither aware of these preparations. forum said it was the Government's duty to inform them of the risks. the forum recognised that quarantine and social distancing measures, while serving some good purposes, might also undermine others. participants felt more strongly than others about opportunities for sporting and religious groups to meet. participants compiled a list of areas in which support could be provided. they were then asked to nominate the level of support that should be provided. they were divided on whether social distancing and quarantine measures were acceptable. the forum unanimously agreed that some level of sanction or penalty should be applied to people who violated quarantine or social distancing orders. most (9/12) considered monitoring the activities of those who had infringed quarantine or social distancing requirements was acceptable. participants were divided on the acceptability of social distancing and quarantine measures. PI = pandemic influenza The forum quickly realised that the numbers in these groups were more than could possibly be covered by the limited stockpile then available. some groups, such as prisoners, were considered to be at lower risk since their incarceration might be considered a form of social distancing. forum participants explicitly excluded the elderly and chronically ill from the list. they expressed the opinion that elderly people would prefer a younger person have priority access to the vaccine or antiviral drug. the forum wished to uphold a life style that ensured personal independent living. forum viewed the military as a useful resource which could assist with policing, medical and paramedical services, transport, essential services, chaplaincy and crude manpower and logistical support. one of the participants chose to dissent from the consensus opinion and prioritised sick people and their contacts and children in the top three. the forum recognised that quarantine and social distancing measures would create social and emotional burdens which would influence people's willingness and capacity to comply with restrictions. participants expressed a range of views when discussing whether quarantined David should be allowed to go to his wife's funeral. the forum recognised that quarantine and social distancing measures, while serving some good purposes, might also undermine others. JAMES: if you are going to allow social gatherings, you have to allow all religious groups to do it. RAELENE: to people who are religious it is not a necessity. participants were less supportive if they considered that the risk was remote geographically. the forum was asked to nominate a range of enforcement measures. they were assuming adequate financial, household and psychological support would be in place before these measures would be imposed. participants were willing to impose strict sanctions on those who did not comply. the forum was divided with respect to the need for quarantine and social distancing measures. some of the participants were in favour of mandatory quarantine and social distancing measures. others considered that a policy of voluntary quarantine and social distancing should be adopted. the forum was divided on how important such opportunities would be to the maintenance of community functioning. some participants felt more strongly than others about opportunities for sporting and religious groups to meet. JAMES: spiritual wellbeing is pretty important during times of crisis like pandemics. the forum was asked to nominate a range of enforcement measures. participants were assuming adequate financial, household and psychological support would be in place. they were willing to impose strict sanctions on people who did not comply. current management plans for pandemic influenza in australia focus on health management, business continuity and information for individual households preparing for a pandemic. current management plans for pandemic influenza in australia focus on health management, business continuity and information for individual households preparing for a pandemic. forum 1's recommendation that the community be better informed and prepared for a pandemic. the findings give an indication of possible community responses, if quarantine and social distancing measures be mandated by law. if adequate financial, household and psychological support is available, the community may accept a range of measures. participants identified the importance of preparing the community in advance. such preparation could lay the groundwork for effective communication in a pandemic. this would moderate the potential for media overstatement and fear mongering. questions have also been raised about the capacity of citizens' juries to elicit rational deliberation [31]. we would suggest that deliberative forums such as the ones described in this study can form the basis for broader engagement with the community around the evidence. the fluViews project pre-publication history is available at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10/501/prepub Acknowledgements We acknowledge the members of the FluViews team: Christine Andrews, Peng Bi, Ann Koehler and Heather Petty."}
