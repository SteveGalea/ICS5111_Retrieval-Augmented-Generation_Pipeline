Sequencing was performed by a commercial service of Invitrogen Co. 1275 (36.8%) were found positive for one single virus. 112 (3.2%) were infected by more than one virus. 21.1% of patients tested were found positive for Inf- A, -B, or -C. Throat swabs of 3460 patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms during 2010\u20132011 were collected and screened for influenza (Inf), parainfluenza (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses. in 558 cases positive for influenza A, 85.13% and 0.72% were identified to be seasonal influenza H3N2 and H1N1 respectively. 14.15% were found to be 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1. 62 cases were identified to be positive for HCoV. human bocavirus (HBoV)-positive case number of each month from March 2010 to February 2011 and the monthly detection rate (% of monthly detected cases) were shown. the total infection rate of common respiratory virus in children is 41.6% (701 positive out of 1686 pediatric subjects), compared to 38.7% (686 positive out of 1774 adult subjects) in adults. positive patients were clinically diagnosed as lower respiratory tract infection. 9 (15.5%) of the HBoV-positive patients were clinically presented as acute upper respiratory tract infection. a 77-year-old patient with acute exacerbation of COPD was found infected by HBoV without the presence of any other 6 respiratory viruses tested in this study. HBoV-positive adult outpatients were more likely to be co-infected with influenza than adult outpatients. but HBoV-positive adult outpatients were more likely to be co-infected with other viruses than adult outpatients. the reason may lie in the high influenza infection rate in adults. 58 cases were detected as HBoV-positive. no outpatient/emergency 215 years old children were detected positive. influenza was the most common co-infecting virus. despite the high co-infection rate, in as high as 67.24% HBoV-positive patients, no other screened common respiratory virus was found. in as high as 67.24% HBoV-positive patients, no other screened common respiratory virus was found. Totally 112 cases were detected as more than one virus positive from 3460 patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms. 8 cases were triple virus positive, 19 cases were co-infection of HBoV and other viruses. different strains of HBoV1 were clearly divided into three groups. representative strain of group I and group II was the prototype strains ST1 and ST2 respectively. most Chinese strains obtained from respiratory specimens belonged to group I. strains based on full length (A), complete NS1 (B), NP1 (C), and VP1/VP2 (D) gene sequences were used. phylogenetic trees based on GZ4785 (labeled with red triangle), GZ9081 (labeled with blue diamond), and other HBoV1 reference strains. linage linage GZ9081 was a recombinant of parental strains ST1 and CU74. two trees of the relevant strain were constructed respectively on the recombinant region and non-recombinant region. it was very probable that GZ9081 was an HBoV1 intra-genotypic recombinant. inf- A, -B, or -C (median age 25 years), 7.7% for RSV (median age 0.91 years), 4.2% for AdV (median age 5 years), 3.5% for PIV (median age 1.2 years), 2.7% for HMPV (median age 2 years), and 2.6% for HCoV (median age 3 years) HBoV DNA was detected in 58 samples (1.68%) (median age 1.5 years) by real-time inpatient 1660 150(9.04) 83(5.00) 236(14.22) 67(4.04) 60(3.61) 88(5.30) 48(2.89) Infants 913 91(9.97) 63(6.9) 203(22.23) 48(5.26) 38(4.16) 33(3.61) 36(3.94) Children 474 45(9.49) 19(4.01) 24(5.06) 18(3.8) 13(2.74) 36(7.59) 11(2.32) Adults in 558 cases positive for influenza A, 85.13% and 0.72% were identified to be seasonal influenza H3N2 and H1N1 respectively. 14.15% were found to be 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1. 62 cases were identified to be infected by 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. the total infection rate of common respiratory virus in children is 41.6% (701 positive out of 1686 pediatric subjects) the infection rate of pediatric patients was higher than adult patients (P0.05) except influenza virus, which tended to infect adults. HBoV tended to mostly infect infants younger than 2 years of age. a 77-year-old patient with acute exacerbation of COPD was found infected by HBoV without the presence of any of other 6 respiratory viruses tested in this study. clinical characteristics of HBoV-positive outpatients/emergency cases were compared with those of HBoV-positive inpatients. the HBoV positive rate in outpatients/emergency was 0.56% (10 out of 1800 outpatients/emergency cases Outpatient/emergency Inpatient Infant/children (%) Adult(%) Infant(%) Children(%) Adult(%) Patients, total no. 299 1501 913 474 273 HBoV-positive no. 5 5 36 11 1 HBoV-positive Male/Female 2/3 3/2 26/10 6/5 1/0 HBoV-positive Mean temperature(\u00b0C) 38.28 38.86 38.11 37.84 37.5 HBoV-positive patient Diagnosis no outpatient/emergency 215 years old children was detected positive for HBoV. there were only 2 columns listed as infant/children and adult in outpatient/emergency patients. no correlation was found between co-infection and clinical symptoms. among the 19 HBoV co-infection cases, 14 was diagnosed as lower respiratory tract illness. co-infection cases of 7 common respiratory viruses including Inf, PIV, RSV, HMPV, HCoV, AdV and HBoV. HCoV, HMPV, AdV 1 (0.89) Influenza (Inf), parainfluenza (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus (HCoV), adenovirus (AdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) were screened during 2010\u20132011 in Guangzhou, china. Totally 112 cases were detected as more than one virus positive from 3460 patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms. most Chinese strains obtained from respiratory specimens belonged to group I. no genotypic differences existed between the phylogenetic trees based on the 3 HBoV ORFs (NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2) and the complete genome of 23 HBoV1 strains. Swedish prototype strains ST1 and ST2, American strain CRD2, JPOC07\u2013511, Thai strains CU6 and CU74, Taiwanese strains TW925_07, TW2715_06 and TW2717_06, Chinese strains HK1, HK19, WLL\u20131, WLL\u20132, CZ643, FZ1, FZ40, BJ3064, BJ3722, GD-HBoV-571, GD-HBoV-5 two trees of the relevant strain were constructed on the recombinant region (position: 1\u20131272+4385-end) and non-recombinant region (position: 1272\u20134385) it was very probable that GZ9081 was an HBoV1 intra-genotypic recombinant. metapneumovirus was screened at the same time to understand their co-infection status with HBoV. the overall monthly distribution of HBoV and other 6 common respiratory viruses were typical, in accordance with the epidemics of respiratory viruses in tropical/subtropical areas like Guangzhou. study found 6 HBoV-positive adult cases in 1774 adult patients with upper respiratory tract infection. prevalence rate was in accordance with those previously reported for adults. HBoV may cause exacerbation in adults with basic or primary pulmonary disease like COPD. complete genome sequence of 2 HBoV strains were obtained in our study. gene analysis showed high identity (98.8%) between each other. phylogenetic analysis showed that different strains of HBoV1 can be divided into three groups. a recombinant detection program was performed to analyze GZ9081. the result confirmed that GZ9081 was an intra-genotype of HBoV1 recombinant, originated from the parental strains ST1 and CU74. this is the first recombinant strain of HBoV1 reported in china. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); (D) adenovirus (AdV); (E) human metapneumovirus (HMPV); (F) human coronavirus (HCoV). table S1 The primers used for Inf, PIV, RSV, HMPV, HCoV and AdV screening."}
