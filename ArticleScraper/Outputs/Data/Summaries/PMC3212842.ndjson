{"summary": "96 suspected poultry farms in china were diagnosed for avian infectious bronchitis (IB) survey. 221 IBV strains were confirmed by dwarf embryo test and RT-PCR assay. by virus recovery trials, 187 of the isolates caused the birds died or distressed from nephritis. some researchers reported that satisfactory cross protection could be provided by appropriate vaccine programs against genetically or antigenically unrelated IBVs. the disease continues to emerge and cause serious production problems, even occurred in routinely vaccinated layer and breeder flocks in china. 58 strains were isolated in early summer (April and May) 99 strains were isolated in fall and winter (from September to January) the ages of flocks at the time of the outbreak varied between 4 and 70 days. most of the chicks were listless and huddled together, showed appetite and weight lose. the birds were validated to be no virus detected by virus isolation through tracheal swabs after two weeks of challenge test. the results indicated that combined immunization with vaccine XZB and YL6 used in chickens could induce prevention against the infection of nephropathogenic IBV. the protection effect of XZB (vaccinated once or twice) was weaker. Isolated IBV strains during 2008-2010 were confirmed by RT-PCR. 214 strains isolated from broilers and 7 strains from broiler breeder. ages of flocks at the time of the outbreak varied between 4 and 70 days. virus recovery tests indicated 84.6% (187/221) isolates caused serious kidney lesions, which were presented with swollen specked kidney and distended ureters filled with uric acid. the other isolates caused respiratory system signs. group 5 days old 10 days old 17 days old 24 days old 1 2.32 1.242 21.73 7.406 364.41 37.253a 851.34 58.734a 2 2.32 1.221 22.75 7.306 477.76 31.132a 1316.26 87.820b 3 2.12 1.226 19.69 6.121 471.73 4.436a 1612.38 69.443b 4 2.11 1.222 2.63 8.481 2.12 2.855b IB is one of the most common and difficult-control poultry diseases in china. the clinical cases caused by vaccination failure raised the importance to investigate the circulating nephropathogenic IBVs and select the candidate vaccine strain against the infections. the inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine (YL6) can satisfactorily prevent the vaccinated birds against the infections. the commercial vaccine was consisted of H120 strain and W93 strain, the latter one was nephropathogenic strain, but attenuated and started for vaccination in 1990s. the embryos dying within 24 hours of inoculation were screened to be nonspecific deaths. the isolates caused stunting, dwarfing, curling of the embryo or the presence of urates in the mesonephros after 5 days incubation. all of the animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Guangdong Province on the review of Welfare and Ethics of Laboratory Animals. YL6 strain isolated from Yulin city of Guangxi province in 2009 was selected for preparation of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine. the detailed vaccination procedures were shown in Table 2. Group 4 was reared as vaccine-negative control. blood samples were collected on day 5, 10, 17 and 24. broilers were inoculated intranasally with routine XZB at 5 days of age. vaccinated intramuscularly with 0.2 ml of inactivated vaccine YL6 at 10 days of age. 96 suspected but vaccinated flocks from eastern, southern, southwestern and central china. five 1-day-old SPF white Leghorn chickens were intranasally inoculated with each isolate. the dead birds were necrospied for lesions of respiratory tract or nephritis. all the survivors were sacrificed and necrospied. the harvested viruses were inactivated with 2/1000 formaldehyde for 36 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by testing for absence of infectivity by embryo inoculation, adjuvanted with mineral oil. eighty 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were housed in biosecurity isolators under quarantine conditions in wen's Foodstuff Group Company. all chickens at 24 days old were infected by intranasal instillation of 105 EID50 of virulent nephropathogenic HY51 strain isolated from Heyuan city of Guangdong province in may 2009. the virus isolation was carried out through tracheal swabs after three weeks post challenge. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript. this work was supported by the Fund from Guangdong Momentously Scientific and Technological Project."}
