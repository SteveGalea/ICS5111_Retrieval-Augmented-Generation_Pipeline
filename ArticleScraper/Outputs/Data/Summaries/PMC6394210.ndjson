{"summary": "effective ventilation and infection prevention and control measures in the form of droplet and airborne isolation in healthcare institutions underscore the contribution of these modes of pathogen dispersion. recent outbreaks such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlight major gaps in our ability to assess and determine risk. cross-disciplinary collaborations across human and animal health, microbiology, engineering, aerobiology, infection control, public health, and industrial hygiene are essential. a network approach has proven successful in other cross-disciplinary fields, including one health and eco-health. potentially infectious bioaerosols are pertinent to a wide range of pathogens, some of which may be endemic and cause sporadic infections and outbreaks. field has been stimulated by advances in other areas which have been applied to the study of infectious bioaerosols. these include: enhanced detection by molecular methods, principally real-time and quantitative PCR, next-generation sequencing, metagenomics, and biosensors. ongoing research has also facilitated the development of procedures and protocols for experimental work, including artificial aerosols. the physical and chemical aspects of aerosols may be beneficial to understanding conditions for controlling bioaerosol dispersion (36\u201338). pathogens such as viruses may vary with respect to isoelectric points, possibly imparting different charges to infectious bioaerosols which may affect their behavior (39, 40). bioaerosol particles are predominantly responsible for person-to-person transmission. there may also be differences between pathogen populations in the infected host vs. what is emitted into the air. this could feed back into more fundamental work on bacterial or viral determinants of transmission, as well as lead to novel means for surveillance and mitigation. infrastructure biocontainment of infectious particles is the first consideration when aerosolizing human and/or animal pathogens in an experimental setting. the development of sampling devices and techniques optimized to preserve pathogen viability would significantly advance the utility of studying bioaerosols for risk assessment and management. multiple investigators have published small studies on the recovery of viral RNA emitted by naturally infected humans using different approaches for recruitment, sampling, processing, and detection. the results are difficult to compare and standing alone, are of limited statistical significance (45, 59\u201361) analysis of bioaerosol data for risk assessments and risk management is needed. lack of data for more common, lower consequence pathogens represents missed opportunities to build a contextual and impactful body of knowledge during inter-outbreak and inter-pandemic periods. biosensors have the potential to fill this gap and integration into aerosol sampling devices is under development (26). a standardized approach to aerosol sampling is challenging and requires substantial efforts to select the best sampling strategy to minimize sampling biases, optimize sample concentration and organism retrieval while preserving integrity. bioaerosols et a\u00e9robiologie (Bioaerosols and Aerobiology) developed at the Universit\u00e9 Laval in. Qu\u00e9bec may help close this gap further given the opportunity to expand reach. microbiologists, aerobiologists, engineers, and epidemiologists have made only incremental progress. a synergistic and pluralistic approach is required for action-driven research which effects change. a networked approach will lead to context-specific follow-on research. field of bioaerosol studies grows, applications will diversify, along with novel technologies for remote sampling and point of care testing yielding results in real time. this stands to mitigate the spread of nefarious pathogens and contribute to early warning and response measures."}
