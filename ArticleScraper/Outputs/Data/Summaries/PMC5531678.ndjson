{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. the virus also includes yellow fever (YFV), west Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV) and japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) eukaryotic cells activate kinases (HRI, GCN2, PKR and PERK) that phosphorylate eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha) to ease cellular injury or, alternatively, to induce apoptosis. the major components of SG are untranslated mRNAs, eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF2), the 40S ribosomal SG assembly lowers the cytosolic availability of components of the cellular translation machinery and functions as a platform that connects stress and antiviral innate responses. viruses have evolved a plethora of strategies to guarantee their replication by preventing or blocking SG assembly in infected cells. l bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion cytotoxicity assay [21] to produce viral stocks, vero cells were infected with ZIKV strain PRVABC59/2015. a stock with a viral titer of 2 x 107 was used in the experiments. stress was induced using 500 M sodium Ars (NaAsO2; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h [24], 300 nM Pateamine A (a kind gift from Jerry Pelletier, McGill University) for 1 h, 1 mM sodium selenite (Na2SeO3; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h and 2mM dithiothreitol for 1 h [25] blotting at 1:10,000; rabbit anti-GADD34 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) used for western blotting at 1:1000. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals and used at 1:5,000. stained cells were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI. laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica DM16000B microscope. images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ImageEM EM-charges coupled device (CCD) camera. a stock with a viral titer of 2 x 107 was used in the experiments. for immunofluorescence assays, 7.5 x 104 Vero or U2OS cells were seeded on 18 mm diameter coverslips the day prior infection. after this period, the viral inoculum was removed by aspiration. eIF2-dephosphorylation inhibitors Salubrinal (Sigma-Aldrich) and Sal003 (a kind gift from Colin Crist, McGill University) were used at final concentrations ranging from 5 to 75 M by the time described in each experiment. mouse anti-eIF2 (Cell Signaling Technology) was used for western blotting at 1:1,000. rabbit anti-GADD34 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for western blotting at 1:1000. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals and used at 1:5,000. cells were blocked using Roche Blocking Solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. primary antibodies were applied followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody in blocking solution. images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ImageEM EM-charges coupled device (CCD) camera. ZIKV recruits TIAR to sites of viral RNA replication. vero cells were infected with ZIKV with an MOI of 0.5 and 6, 12 and 24 hours after. nascent viral RNA was labeled with BrUTP. immunofluorescence/laser scanning confocal microscopy (IF/LSCM) using a 40X objective lens; B. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and the viral protein NS1 was detected by immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy. no alteration was observed in the levels of SG-nucleating proteins between mock and infected cells. mock-infected (blue arrows) and eIF4G-infected cells (red arrows) exhibited SG assembly at a rate of 0.61% and 0% respectively. similar results were observed when U2OS cells were used in place of vero cells (S1 Fig) a natural product isolated from a marine sponge disrupts the translation initiation by hyperactivating the eIF4A helicase and disrupting the eIF4F complex. SG assembly was determined by colocalized puncta of TIAR and eIF4G and infected cells were identified by the presence of the viral protein NS1. at least 150 cells in each condition were analyzed. Sodium selenite promotes the assembly of type II SG that differ from canonical SGs in their morphology, composition and mechanism of assembly. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody specific for eIF2 phosphorylation at S51. high levels of eIF2 phosphorylation (40-fold increase) were observed in mock-infected and untreated cells treated with Ars. however, levels of eIF2 phosphorylation were consistently lower (10.5-fold increase) vero cells were mock-infected or infected with ZIKV with an MOI of 0.5 or mock-infected and treated at 24 hpi with 500 M Ars for 1 h to induce cellular stress. asterisks represent the statistically significant difference between mock and ZIKV-infected cells. SG assembly was determined by TIAR puncta and infected cells were identified by the presence of NS1. blockage of SG assembly correlates with lower levels of p-eIF2 upon DTT treated in mock-infected cells. phospho(P)-eIF2, eIF2 (total) and actin by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. eIF2 dephosphorylation is modulated by ZIKV. SGs were induced in 23.16.5% of ZIKV-infected cells treated with Ars. this value increased to 47.87.0% in cells treated with salubrinal prior to Ars-induced stress. values of p-eIF2 fold change were normalized by the corresponding eIF2 levels of the same condition. at 24 hpi were treated with 75 M salubrinal for 3 h. oxidative stress was induced by treatment with 500 M Ars for 1 h. lubrinal produce only 4.9% of the infectious viral particles produced by control cells. a dose-dependent decrease in NS1 expression was observed in salubrinal treated cells. vero cells were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 0.5 or mock-infected. TIAR was evenly distributed throughout mock-infected cells. eIF4G was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm. but in infected cells, TIAR was still found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus but also concentrated in foci in the perinuclear region. no alteration was observed in the levels of G3BP-1, TIAR and PABP between mock and infected cells. the results indicate that ZIKV infection does not induce changes in the levels of SG-nucleating proteins. similar results were observed when U2OS cells were used in place of Vero cells. SG assembly was determined by colocalized puncta of TIAR and eIF4G. infected cells were identified by the presence of viral protein NS1. 97.5% of infected cells presented TIAR and eIF4G puncta. SG assembly was determined by IF/LSCM staining for the SG markers TIAR and eIF4G. SG assembly was determined by colocalized puncta of TIAR and G3BP-1. no significant difference was observed in the assembly of SG between mock and infected cells treated with Se. phosphorylation of eIF2 is strongly induced in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells. phosphorylation of eIF2 is strongly induced in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells. in contrast, in infected cells, the phospho-eIF2 signal is visibly weaker. cellular stress was determined by IF/LSCM staining for SG markers. infected cells were identified by the presence of the NS1 viral protein. ZIKV infection blocks SG assembly and phosphorylation of eIF2. the reduced levels of p-eIF2 in infected cells are a result of an interference downstream the activation of the eIF2 kinases. vero cells were infected with ZIKV with an MOI of 0.5 or mock-infected and treated at 24 hpi with 2mM DTT. our results show that are GADD34 levels are significantly higher in ZIKV-infected cells as compared to uninfected cells. we treated cells with salubrinal and its derivative sal003, small molecules that selectively inhibit the PP1/GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of phospho-eIF2. ZIKV modulates eIF2 dephosphorylation. A. Vero cells were infected with ZIKV or mock-infected. at 24 hpi, cells were lysed and cells were lysed. at least 150 cells in each condition were analyzed. asterisks represent the statistically significant difference between mock and ZIKV-infected cells. cell viability of mock-infected cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. B. representative result of the plaque forming assay in A; C. Cell lysates were analyzed for NS1 and -actin by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. SG assembly independently of the eIF2 kinase activated by stress [19]. the reasons why these differences were observed remain to be determined. phosphorylation of eIF2 is a key regulator of mRNA translation initiation. the level of phospho-eIF2 is modulated by the activities of kinases and phosphatases. eIF2 phosphorylation prevents the recycling of the eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet ternary complex. treatment of cells with salubrinal causes accumulation of phospho-eIF2. treatment of cells with salubrinal inhibits dephosphorylation of eIF2 without increasing eIF2 kinase activity. treatment of salubrinal-infected cells with salubrinal inhibits viral replication. infected cells could act in synergy with PP1/GADD34 inhibition. this ability may reflect one of the many strategies that ZIKV has evolved to control the host stress response. elucidation of the interaction of viral components with host factors involved in SG assembly may provide new insights into pathology of ZIKV infection. values presented in the graph are normalized against the total amount of eIF2 in the cell lysate and represent fold change. the untreated mock-infected cells were arbitrarily set to 1."}
