{"summary": "public health infectious disease surveillance employs two strategies to detect cases and outbreaks of communicable diseases. laboratory-based surveillance relies on non-laboratory data. conventional laboratory assays fail to detect a causative agent in approximately 40% of gastroenteritis and as many as 60% of encephalitis cases. metagenomics has proven useful in investigating novel species and strains [9-11], outbreaks [12,13] and complex diseases [14,15] in recent years. metagenomics can detect pathogens at very low abundance and be performed directly from clinical samples [16] or even single cells [17] an enhanced molecular approach can be used in which PCR-based analyses designed to capture a wider array of targets are employed. these include single or multiplexed PCR assays for conserved regions within a species or genus [18,19], differentially labeled nucleic acid probes, and direct sequencing of PCR products [20-22]. rpoB and cpn-60 offer enhanced taxonomic resolution compared to rRNA [31,32] rpoB and cpn-60 offer enhanced taxonomic resolution compared to rRNA [31,32] Approximately 50% of sequences generally have no significant homology to known proteins in databases (dark matter) Approximately 50% of sequences generally have no significant homology to known proteins in databases (dark matter) primers are specific to conserved genes, such as 16S rRNA, chaperonin-60 (cpn-60) or chaperonin-60 (hsp-90) or the RNA polymerase (rpoB). the extraordinary genomic diversity of viruses precludes the amplification of universally conserved genes. leveraging conserved gene families across bacteria, fungi, protists or viruses, shotgun metagenomics can potentially catalogue all of the microbes present in a sample. extracted material is sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform. these databases must contain all known sequences from all organisms rather than a set of sequences from a single gene family. the human microbiome project (HMP) has used PCR primers to target conserved gene families. the amplicons are specific to different microbial species. the sequences are compared to a reference database of the conserved gene to identify the species and/or genus associated with each sequence. unbiased sequence-independent shotgun metagenomics is better suited to the task of identifying unknown organisms in a sample of interest. unbiased sequence-independent shotgun metagenomics can potentially catalogue all of the microbes present in a sample by sequencing all the nucleic acid extracted from a specimen. shotgun metagenomics studies have identified several novel pathogens from clinical samples. a recent notable discovery is the bas-Congo virus, a rhabdovirus that was associated with a 2009 hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the african Congo. cellular material is first removed using filtration or centrifugation to maximize recovery of virions. cellular material is first removed using filtration or centrifugation to

unknown etiology Lower cost per bp Decreasing read bioinformatics analysis is often performed using a staged approach. the hundreds of thousands to millions of short reads generated must be computationally transformed into meaningful data reflective of the presence of the microbes of interest. more permissive parameters may enable the identification of species that are divergent from the reference organism, but may also lead to incorrect taxonomic assignments. a strategy to identify novel sequence reads by using paired-end information to increase iteratively the size of contigs. the microbial fraction of nucleic acid in a clinical sample can be extremely small, as most of the DNA present is often of human origin. if human DNA is removed, the small amount of microbial nucleic acid remaining will require newer techniques in sequence library construction. multiple next-generation sequencing platforms are available. but the two most commonly used methods in metagenomics studies are Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis and Roche/454 pyrosequencing. the choice of platform depends on the sample being sequenced, the questions being asked, and the laboratory\u2019s budget and capacity. metagenomic samples GS Junior System 500 35 Mb 10 hours 1 105 Desktop machine Errors in homopolymeric regions Fastest output is helpful for urgent public health issues Fastest run time of

Very fast run time Errors in homopolymeric regions. an experienced bioinformatician designed an in-house data analysis pipeline. it is sometimes handled by software embedded in the DNA sequencer itself. reads that remain after filtering can be directly compared to microbial reference sequence databases or assembled de novo into larger clusters of contiguous sequence reads. s of known classification has recently been developed and successfully implemented to identify two novel arenaviruses in snakes [72]. public health infectious disease surveillance requires a priori knowledge of the pathogen of interest, in that there must be a validated test for the pathogen, and it must be included in the laboratory\u2019s test portfolio. conventional laboratory testing might remain negative even after multiple samples are collected and multiple tests are conducted. metagenomics detected both HPV type 6 and putative novel HPV types, as well as the molluscum contagiosum virus, all of which would have gone undetected using conventional techniques. a single metagenomics experiment can now be performed for less than $200 Identification of pathogens that are present at very low levels It is now possible to perform metagenomics studies from a single cell. metagenomics has characterized the healthy microbiomes of 242 individuals, collecting microbial nucleic acids from 18 body habitats from five sites. the HMP has characterized the healthy microbiomes of 242 individuals, collecting microbial nucleic acids from 18 body habitats. metagenomics provides the opportunity to compare taxonomic and functional differences between the microbes present in healthy individuals and those with a range of conditions, from acute infections to chronic diseases of both known and unknown etiology. despite these difficulties, association studies provide valuable information about the nature of dysbiotic microbiomes. akin to early bacteriological DAS studies, only culturable fungal species associated with illnesses have been studied in detail. recently, targeted DAS of 18S rRNA revealed that the species diversity of the endogenous fungal community is richer than previously assumed [87]. study showed metagenomics\u2019 utility in identifying \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019. same study demonstrated metagenomics\u2019 utility in identifying \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019. authors able to identify co-infections not detected by conventional testing. metagenomics can detect contaminants from cell cultures, reagents and laboratory equipment Contaminants may be incorrectly associated with the disease of interest Negative controls must be used. researchers must consider the plausibility of the findings Results must be independently validated Privacy Host nucleic acids are almost always sequenced in metagenomics studies. metagenomics can provide a foundation for more targeted quantitative analyses on larger cohorts in order to differentiate between the microorganism(s) driving the disease and non-pathogenic commensals. despite these caveats, all new discoveries must initially arise from novel and unexpected findings, but they must be followed up with appropriate control samples. metagenomics-based approaches may become front-line diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the public health setting. multiple conventional diagnostic tests are often used, potentially leading to unnecessary costs and delays in diagnosis. instead, metagenomics might be used as a single comprehensive screening test for potential pathogens, both known and novel, as well as to assess the state of an individual\u2019s microbiome. metagenomics has been exercised primarily in the realm of academic research rather than at the frontlines of public health. standard metagenomic protocols are necessary for testing and analyzing samples and for inter-laboratory comparison of results. as whole-genome sequencing technologies decrease in price and increase in speed and simplicity, however, it is expected that metagenomics approaches will be applied more often in public health emergencies."}
