{"summary": "coronaviruses infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species. all contain envelope-anchored spike proteins that mediate viral entry into host cells. spikes bind to host receptors through their S1 subunits and fuse viral and host membranes through their S2 subunits. spikes are the most divergent among all coronavirus proteins. the pre-fusion structures are present on mature virions and have a clove-like shape with three S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric S2 stalk. the post-fusion structures are the membrane-fusion state and have a dumbbell-like shape with three S2 subunits forming a six-helix bundle structure. the structures of S2 from different genera are similar in both the pre- and post-fusion states. IBV spike ectodomain was cloned into pFastBac vector (Life Technologies Inc.) it was expressed in insect cells using a honeybee melittin signal peptide and C-terminal GCN4 and His6 tags. EM [36] was used to collect 2,000 total movies at 37,700x magnification. each movie had a total accumulated exposure of 53.66 e/2 fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms exposure. 1,400 best images were manually selected. the structural model of the IBV spike in the pre-fusion state was refined using Phenix [43] with geometry restrains and three-fold noncrystallographic symmetry constraints. the final model was analyzed with MolProbity [44] and EMRinger [45]. cells were incubated with recombinant IBV S1-CTD containing a C-terminal His6 tag (40 g/ml) at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-His6 antibody. the cells were then analyzed for the binding of IBV S1-CTD using flow cytometry. expression and purification of IBV spike ectodomain was synthesized. it was cloned into pFastBac vector (Life Technologies Inc.) with codons optimized for insect cell expression. aliquots of IBV spike ectodomain were applied to glow-discharged CF-2/1-4C grids. the automated software SerialEM [36] was used to collect 2,000 total movies at 37,700x magnification and at a defocus range between 1 and 3 m. each movie had a total accumulated exposure of 53.66 e/2 fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms exposure. the initial model of IBV spike ectodomain was obtained by fitting the seven parts (S1-NTD, S1-CTD, two parts of SD1, two parts of SD2 and S2) into the cryo-EM density map of IBV spike. the structural model of the spike in the pre-fusion state was refined using Phenix [43] with geometry restrains and three-fold noncrystallographic symmetry constraints. cells were incubated with recombinant IBV S1-CTD containing a C-terminal His6 tag (40 g/ml) at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-His6 antibody for 30 minutes. total surface area and buried surface area of coronavirus S1-CTDs were calculated using the PISA server at the European Bioinformatics Institute. the spike proteins used for the above analysis were not included in the above analysis because the former contain at least one S1-CTD in the \u201cstanding up\u201d state. the latter contains long stretches of missing residues in its S1 domains, both of which interfere with the above analysis. the exact location of FP is uncertain. the range of FP used for making figures is consistent with a previous structural study on -genus mouse hepatitis coronavirus spike [18]. in the post-fusion structure of trimeric S2, three copies of HR1 and three copies of HR2 would refold into a six-helix bundle structure. a fusion peptide (FP) would insert into the target membrane. the exact residue range of coronavirus FP remains unknown. structural elements of subunit A are colored in the same way as in Fig 1D. subunits B and C are colored in light purple and light pink. all structures are viewed from the side. structure of S1-NTD from -genus human coronavirus NL63 (PDB ID: 5SZS) contains two copies of S1-NTDs (i.e., S1-NTD1 and S1-NTD2) but S1-NTD2 was used in structural comparisons with the S1-NTDs from the other genera. the sugar-binding domain in IBV spike is its S1-NTD [51] no structural information is available for complexes of coronavirus S1-NTDs and their sugar ligand. coronavirus S1-NTDs originated from host galectins. structural development of the ceiling is a possible indicator for evolution of S1-NTDs in the direction of - and -genera, then the -genus, and finally the -genus. we performed quantitative structural comparisons of S1-NTDs from different genera by calculating the Z-score and r.m.s.d. -coronavirus S1-NTDs from four genera form evolutionary spectrum. structure of IBV S1-CTD is significantly different from the structures of S1-CTDs from the other genera. core structures of -coronavirus and -coronavirus S1-NTDs are standard -sandwich folds. in both the - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs, three short discontinuous loops are located in the same spatial region. in -coronavirus S1-CTDs, a long continuous subdomain is located in this spatial region and functions as the lone RBM. to investigate the function of IBV S1-CTD, we performed two assays. first, we carried out an IBV-spike-mediated pseudovirus entry assay in the presence of recombinant IBV S1\u2013CTD. to this end, retroviruses pseudotyped with IBV spike (i.e., IBV pseudoviruses) were used to enter host cells. coronavirus S1-CTDs from the - and -genera all use the additional structural features on the edge of their core structure as their RBMs. the core structures and the RBM regions of S1-CTDs are both divergent among different genera. the core structures and the RBM regions of S1-CTDs are both divergent among different genera. -CTDs are the closest, -coronavirus S1-CTDs are the farthest, and -coronavirus S1-CTDs fall in the middle. the evolution of the RBMs may have led to the following functional outcomes. -coronavirus S1 also takes the cross-subunit packing mode. the RBMs of - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs are involved in the intra-subunit packing. - and -coronavirus S1 both take the intra-subunit packing mode. in both - and -coronavirus spikes, the RBMs of their S1-CTDs and the ceiling of their S1-NTDs have evolved to facilitate the cross-subunit packing. these additional structural features further evolved to gain other functions: the RBMs of S1-CTDs recognize diverse protein receptors, while the ceiling of the S1-NTDs either protects the sugar-binding site or recognizes a new protein receptor. the structure and function of IBV S2 are highly similar to those of the other coronavirus genera. in the pre-fusion structure of IBV S2, HR2 is disordered, whereas HR1 and FP each consist of several -helices and connecting loops. the structural and functional similarities of coronavirus S2 from different genera suggest evolutionary conservation of coronavirus S2. the structural and functional similarities of coronavirus S2 from different genera suggest evolutionary conservation of coronavirus S2. the exact location of FP is uncertain. the range of FP used for making figures is consistent with a previous structural study on -genus mouse hepatitis coronavirus spike [18]. the exact residue range of coronavirus FP remains unknown. biochemical studies have identified a region in coronavirus FP that associates with membranes. structural elements of subunit A are colored in the same way as in Fig 1D. subunits B and C are colored in light purple and light pink respectively. the core structure is a twelve-stranded -sandwich. structure of S1-NTD from -genus human coronavirus NL63 (PDB ID: 5SZS). S1-NTD2 was used in structural comparisons with the S1-NTDs from the other genera because it occupies the same location as the S1-NTDs from the other genera in quaternary structures of the spikes. the sugar-binding domain in IBV spike is its S1-NTD [51] no structural information is available for complexes of coronavirus S1-NTDs and their sugar ligand. coronavirus S1-NTDs originated from host galectins. structural development of the ceiling is a possible indicator for evolution of S1-NTDs in the direction of - and -genera, then the -genus, and finally the -genus. the structural development of the ceiling is also involved in the quaternary packing of S1, which will be discussed later in this paper. -coronavirus and -coronavirus S1-NTDs are standard -sandwich folds. -coronavirus and -coronavirus S1-NTDs are both standard -sandwich folds. despite these dramatic structural differences, the S1-CTDs from all genera share the same structural topology. in -coronavirus S1-CTDs, a long continuous subdomain is located in this spatial region and functions as the lone RBM. in -coronavirus S1-CTDs, a long continuous subdomain is located in this spatial region. retroviruses pseudotyped with IBV spike were used to enter host cells. in the absence of recombinant IBV S1-CTD, IBV pseudoviruses entered DF-1 cells efficiently. recombinant IBV S1-CTD reduced the efficiency of IBV pseudovirus entry into DF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. the core structures and the RBM regions of S1-CTDs are both divergent among different genera. the RBMs are three short discontinuous loops for - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs, two reinforced loops for -coronavirus S1-CTDs and a single continuous subdomain for -coronavirus S1-CTDs. the evolution of the RBMs may have led to two functional outcomes. the diversity of the RBMs from three short loops to two extended loops. the reinforced RBM regions in both - and -coronavirus S1-NTDs facilitate quaternary packing of S1. -coronavirus S1 also takes the cross-subunit packing mode. the RBMs of - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs are involved in the intra-subunit packing. - and -coronavirus S1 both take the intra-subunit packing mode. 1-CTDs and the ceiling of their S1-NTDs have evolved to facilitate cross-subunit packing. these additional structural features further evolved to gain other functions. the ceiling of the S1-NTDs either protects the sugar-binding site or recognizes a new protein receptor. coronavirus spike S2 is locked in the pre-fusion state because of the structural restraint from S1. the packing between S1 and S2 in IBV spike is the same as those in -coronavirus spikes. coronavirus spikes from four different genera are divergent, and their evolutionary relationships pose a major puzzle in the virology field. a critical piece missing is the structure of -coronavirus spikes, preventing a clear understanding of the evolutionary relationships among coronavirus spikes. partial ceiling in -coronavirus S1-NTDs and extensive ceiling in -coronavirus S1-NTDs are also involved in the quaternary packing of S1. coronavirus S1-CTDs from different genera are very diverse, but still form an evolutionary spectrum with - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs at two ends. coronavirus spikes from different genera form evolutionary spectrum. -coronavirus spike is the closest, -coronavirus spike is the farthest. -coronavirus spike is the farthest, and -coronavirus spike is the intermediate.
