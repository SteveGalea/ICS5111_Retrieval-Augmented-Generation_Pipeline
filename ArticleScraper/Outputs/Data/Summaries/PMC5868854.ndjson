{"summary": "zoonotic pathogens are zoonotic pathogens that can cause severe acute respiratory distress and neurological disease in humans. NiV was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory and neurological disease in pigs in 1998\u201399 that led to infections in humans in Malaysia (283 cases) and Singapore (11 cases) with a CFR of 38%. the use of ferrets as experimental models of infection has gained interest since the publication of the ferret transcriptome and draft genome [16\u201318], which opened the doors to performing whole-genome gene expression analysis in this animal model. we have performed a systematic characterization of HeV, NiV-B and NiV-M infection in a well-established lethal challenge model in ferrets. the majority of animals succumbed of infection by day 6\u20138 pi with a lethal dose 50% (LD50) for HeV, NiV-B and NiV-M of 5, 32 and 22 TCID50, respectively. several ferrets receiving low infective doses (10 or 102 TCID50) displayed no clinical signs throughout the period of observation. a serial sacrifice study was performed using groups of 5 ferrets challenged with 5,000 TCID50 of each virus via the IN route. on day 5 pi, the animals showed the first signs of disease. in terms of gross pathologic changes, NiV-M and HeV-infected ferrets displayed small pinpoint hemorrhages by day 5 pi. henipavirus infected ferrets showed a progressive increase in levels of viral RNA over time in all organs. henipavirus strains showed a progressive increase in levels of viral RNA over time in all organs. ferrets infected with NiV-B (grey), NiV-M (black solid) and HeV (black dashed) on various days post infection. compared to NiV-M, significant higher levels of RNA were detected in the trachea, OB, FB, and spleen. viral RNA were detected in nasal washes for all viruses by 3 dpi. shedding of NiV-M and HeV was significantly higher in nasal washes. no significant differences in viral shedding were observed between the 3 virus strains. the lungs of infected ferrets with HeV and NiV-B showed a progressive increase in differentially expressed genes until 5 dpi. gene activation occurred later during NiV-B infection as compared to HeV, paralleling the later development of clinical signs observed in NiV-B infection. gene expression profiles in lung tissue of ferrets infected with HeV and NiV-B. ferrets were infected with 5,000 TCID50 of HeV and NiV-B. by 5 dpi, the two viruses display very similar profiles of gene activation both qualitatively and quantitatively. macrophage markers (CD14, CD40, CD80, CD86, CD274 and LY96) showed marked upregulation at 5 dpi during both HeV and NiV-B infection. levels of lymphocyte markers (CD2, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD4, CD7, CD8A, CD8B and CD27) remained mostly unchanged in the lung tissue during infection with both viruses. expression landscape of genes with growth factor activity is split towards up- and down regulation. gene enrichment score (Fisher\u2019s exact test p-value) of the cell cycle KEGG Pathway throughout the infection. gene classification of differentially expressed genes in the lung tissue. gene expression profiles in the brain of ferrets infected with HeV and NiV-B. gene expression profiles in the brain of ferrets infected with HeV and NiV-B. gene expression profiles in the brain of ferrets infected with 5,000 TCID50 of HeV and NiV-B. group of 4 animals were challenged with 10-fold dilutions (10, 102, 103, or 105 tissue culture infectious dose 50%, or TCID50) of these three henipavirus strains. clinical signs were first noticeable on day 5 post infection (pi) and included development of fever, labored breathing, mild paralysis, generalized tremors and subcutaneous edema. a first study using different infective doses of the three viruses was performed to establish the LD50 of each virus in ferrets. survival rates are shown for 6-week old ferrets (n = 5 per group) that were infected with different doses of NiV-M, NiV-B and HeV. NiV-M and HeV-infected ferrets showed small pinpoint hemorrhages by day 5 pi. small areas of hemorrhagic lesions by day 5 pi progressed into large hemorrhagic lesions in the moribund animals by day 6\u20137 pi. lung weights were significantly increased in all infected ferrets. viral RNA was detected in all tissues collected at necropsy by quantitative RT-PCR. all three henipavirus strains showed a progressive increase in levels of viral RNA over time in all organs. samples from 5 animals per group were analyzed at each time point. infected ferrets were infected IN with 5,000 TCID50 of HeV, NiV-B and NiV-M. levels of viral RNA were determined in nasal, oral and rectal swabs and urine. low levels of viral RNA were detected in nasal washes for all viruses by 3 dpi. shedding of all 3 viruses was also detected in urine. the nave ferrets that were co-housed with the infected animals showed no evidence of weight-loss or clinical signs. no virus specific antibodies were detected by ELISA or neutralization assay. the activation of antiviral responses during NiV-B occurred at a later time-point (0 upregulated ISGs by 3 dpi, and 32 by 5 dpi) the activation of other immune-related gene categories, including Cytokine Activity, Leukocyte Chemotaxis, Jak-STAT Signaling Pathway and Complement and Coagulation Cascades, also reached their highest degree of activation by 5 dpi. up- and down-regulated genes were subjected to functional classification. for each time-point, up- and down-regulated genes were subjected to functional classification. a selected group of gene categories from 1Gene Ontology and 2KEGG Pathways are shown. mRNA levels of CD3E and CD8A were also found to remain unchanged. those from CXCL10, OAS1 and IFN showed a progressive increase. gene members of the TGF-beta, Wnt/beta-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways were also downregulated. gene classification of differentially expressed genes in lung tissue. gene expression profiles in the brain of ferrets infected with HeV and NiV-B. gene expression profiles in the brain of ferrets infected with HeV and NiV-B. ized at 3 and 5 d.p.i. (n = 3 per group, except for HeV_D5 with n = 2) and together with an uninfected control group (n = 2). genetically distinct henipavirus strains in Malaysia (NiV-M), Bangladesh (NiV-B) and australia are associated with differences in clinical outcome and transmission patterns. we also observed that the lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen were important targets of infection, suggesting multiorgan failure was a likely cause of death. this is in accordance with previous studies showing a lack of transmission in the presence of viral shedding. henipavirus infected epithelial cells produce type I interferon responses [29] that activate the antiviral responses, and cytokines that activate different components of the humoral and cellular innate immune responses. the early activation of interferon responses is critical to control viral infections. the onset of inflammatory responses is mediated by the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway. it is initially activated by the viral sensing mechanisms (RIG-I/MDA5 and TLR3) within the infected cells and later amplified and sustained by the inflammatory activity in the infected tissue. the development of tissue damage also coincided with the onset of clinical signs. the infection with HeV and NiV-B did not modify expression levels of lymphocyte markers in the lung tissue by 5 dpi. these results point to a deficit or delay of lymphocyte activity in the lung. the local regulatory environment may contribute to this possible deficit in the influx of lymphocytes into the lung. infection with HeV and NiV-B results in downregulation of genes related to the cell cycle, extracellular matrix components and metallopeptidase genes in the lung tissue. if confirmed, the latter scenario would bear resemblance to that observed in measles infection. henipaviruses can infect lymphoid organs. henipavirus infection is characterized by a progressive increase in expression levels of ISGs and genes related with the innate immune responses. this is in accordance with previous observations in hamsters where IL-1 and TNF- expression in the brain correlate with an increase in blood brain-barrier permeability and development of neuroinflammation. lymphocyte markers by RNA-seq and RT-PCR do not allow to reach conclusions regarding the influx of lymphocytes into the brain tissue. additional experiments will be necessary to determine the exact profile of lymphocytes that migrate into the brain tissue and to establish their role in henipavirus pathogenesis. a myriad of organs, including the central nervous system, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, bladder and blood (schematic representation of the data from HeV infection) in the lung tissue, the virus presents high growth rates and only after the inflammatory responses become fully active, the levels of virus stabilize but without significantly decreasing. gene expression data strongly suggest that lymphocytes are not migrating and expanding in the affected tissues. al cells orchestrate and amplify the cytokine and chemokine responses leading to systemic immune activation. the early activation of interferon responses in IFNA-R-/- mice leads to the loss of the resistance to henipavirus infection that wild-type mice naturally possess. the onset of inflammatory responses is mediated by the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway. initiation of adaptive immune responses is a sequential process that includes antigen capture, processing and presentation. the influx of lymphocytes into the infected lung tissue is commonly observed during experimental infections in vivo. this process is detectable during influenza infection in mice by 4 dpi. henipavirus infection caused lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes and promoted susceptibility to bacterial co-infection [42] henipaviruses to spread to lymphoid tissues, including the infection of lymph nodes [42] and the infection of the spleen [43] have been previously linked to a subsequent loss of immune responsiveness. infection with HeV and NiV-B results in progressive downregulation of genes related to the cell cycle, extracellular matrix components and metallopeptidase genes in the lung tissue. further downregulation of genes belonging to the TGF, Wnt/-catenin and hedgehog signaling pathways. henipavirus infection is characterized by a progressive increase in expression levels of ISGs and genes related with the innate immune responses. this is in accordance with previous observations in hamsters where IL-1 and TNF- expression in the brain correlate with an increase in blood brain-barrier permeability. Fig 6 recapitulates the major findings in terms of viral spread across body compartments and host responses during henipavirus infection in ferrets. the molecular mechanisms governing henipavirus pathogenesis remain unknown. these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which henipavirus infection induces changes in the host response in lung and brain. animals were anesthetized by chamber induction (5 liters 100%O2/min and 3 to 5% isoflurane) temperature transponders were implanted subcutaneously in the back of the ferrets. groups of 4 animals were challenged intranasally (IN) with 10, 102, 103, or 105 tissue culture dose leading to a 50% cytopathic effect (TCID50) of NiV-M, NiV-B or HeV in 200L sterile PBS,100L for each nare. animals were monitored daily for clinical signs, body weight loss and temperature. whole blood samples were collected in 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. whole blood was collected in 560 l of AVL viral lysis buffer (Qiagen, Inc) qRT-PCR components were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR components were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer and 5 l of RNA was added to each reaction. the following thermocycling parameters were used to calculate TCID50 equivalents in the samples. gene expression profiles by Illumina sequencing 100mg of each tissue were collected in 1ml of Trizol, homogenized and preserved at -70\u00b0C until further processing. the resulting cDNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA prep kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) gene expression by real-time PCR analysis cDNA was generated using the ImProm II kit (Promega) gene levels were normalized to those from house-keeping gene beta-actin. the viruses were propagated on vero cells (CCL-81; ATCC) in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with L-Glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone; Logan UT) at 37\u00b0C in humidified CO2 incubator (5%). infected ferrets were euthanized upon signs of severe disease (moribund, labored breathing, paralysis) and nave ferrets were euthanized 21 dpi. group of 5 ferrets were infected IN with 5,000 TCID50 of NiV-M. 60 l of RNAlater (Qiagen, Inc) was stored in 1 ml of RNAlater (Qiagen, Inc) for RNA extraction. RNA was completely removed and tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of Trizol (Sigma) RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Inc) using the CFX96 Real Time system combined to a C1000 Thermalcycler (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA) data were analyzed with the BIO-RAD CFX manager software (version 2.0) cDNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) ferret transcriptome MusPutFur V1 (NCBI accession number AEYP00000000.1) [16] was filtered so that genes with multiple splicing variants only retained the sequence of their first variant. each experimental group is composed of 3 animals, except for the brain tissue of the control group (n = 2) and of brain tissue of HeV-Day 5 (n = 2). gene levels were normalized to those from the house-keeping gene beta-actin. the average bodytemperature is shown in degrees celcius, per day and per group of ferrets infected with NiV-B, NiV-M or HeV and compared with controls. gene expression in lung and brain of henipavirus infected ferrets. mRNA expression in lung and brain at various days post infection."}
