{"summary": "most viral pathogens encode type I fusion proteins, such as HIV-1 gp41 or influenza virus hemagglutinin (4). these molecules are typically trimeric and mediate membrane fusion by forming a six-helix bundle that pulls the viral and cellular membranes together. both types of FPs are essential for virus infection and share some features, e.g., they are hydrophobic and between 15 and 30 amino acid residues in length. ous fragment of 1-antitrypsin, named VIRIP, directly targets the viral gp41 FP to inhibit HIV-1 entry (9) synthetic peptides corresponding to the HIV-1 gp41 FP have membrane-perturbing activity that can be quantified in hemolysis assays. structural nuclear magnetic resonance analyses revealed that the large hydrophobic surfaces of the FP and VIRIP or VIR-576 show a remarkable complementarity. one derivative (VIR-576) that showed about 2 orders of magnitude improved antiviral efficacy was tested in a phase I/II clinical study in treatment naive HIV-1-infected individuals with high viral loads (11) intravenous infusion of VIR-576 reduced the mean plasma viral load by up to 98% without causing severe adverse effects. one interesting feature of VIRIP-based inhibitors was the high barrier to HIV-1 resistance. the amino acid changes reduce sensitivity to both VIRIP derivatives in a cumulative manner. but even the combination of all seven reduced the susceptibility of R5 HIV-1 to VIR-576 in primary cells only 4-fold. also, the four late changes reduced HIV-1 sensitivity to inhibition. all subsequent mutations (M3 to M7) are located in relative close proximity to the FP sequence at the N terminus of gp41. all mutations are of conservative nature, presumably to preserve Env function in the resistance mutants. seven mutations were introduced in the Env protein of the well-characterized X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 strain. to assess possible coreceptor dependencies, we also inserted all mutations into a derivative of NL4-3 containing the V3 loop region of HIV-1 92TH014.12. the first four accumulating mutations (M1, M1-2, M1-3, and M1-4) had modest effects on the susceptibility of X4 HIV-1 NL4-3 to VIR-353. the addition of the fifth mutation (T244S) clearly enhanced VIR-353 resistance. the combination of all seven changes resulted in a 23-fold increased IC50 of 6.26 M. X4-tropic HIV-1 constructs containing 4 amino acid changes showed a plateau in their dose-response curves. however, the mutations selected by serial passage of X4-tropic HIV-1 (13) also reduce the susceptibility of R5 virus to inhibition. effects of all Env alterations on VIR-576 inhibition were relatively modest. even the combination of all seven changes reduced viral susceptibility only 4-fold (IC50 4.85 M) compared to the parental R5 HIV-1 strain (IC50 1.28 M) IC50 of VIR-353 from 0.27 M to 0.61 or 0.77 M, respectively. these two alterations had also the strongest effect on susceptibility of X4 HIV-1 to VIR-576 inhibition. the impact of individual amino acid changes on inhibition of R5 HIV-1 by VIR-353 and VIR-576 was even weaker. TZM-bl reporter cells provide a convenient and commonly used means for quantitative analyses of HIV-1 infection. however, they were derived from the cervical HeLa cancer cell line (18) that is usually not susceptible to HIV infection and might not faithfully reflect effects in primary human cells. up to 25-fold increases in IC50s were measured in the indicator cell line. but only between 3.5- and 10-fold effects were measured in PBMCs. essentially all mutations affect viral susceptibility to inhibition by VIRIP derivatives in a cumulative manner. the results were confirmed in human PBMCs. all but the M2 mutation reduced virion infectivity. mutations in gp41 (M1, M4, M6, and M7) impaired virion infectivity in PBMC cultures more significantly than those located in gp120 (M2, M3, and M5) VIR-353/576 resistance is associated with delayed and/or attenuated HIV-1 replication. mutations selected late during long-term passage in cell culture restore viral fitness. mutations selected late during long-term passage in cell culture restore viral fitness. infections were performed using RT activity-normalized virus stocks. essentially each of the seven cumulative changes in the HIV-1 Env protein contributed to decreased sensitivity to inhibition by VIR-353/576. however, the impact of the three initial mutations on VIRIP resistance and Env function was modest. TZM-bl reporter cells were infected with infectivity-normalized X4 HIV-1 NL4-3 mutants carrying the indicated cumulative mutations in Env. infection rates were determined 3 days later. most mutations are located in close proximity to the gp41 FP domain. a colorimetric fusion assay was first described by Cavrois et al. (21). Virus particles containing cumulative, as well as individual, mutations in Env and additionally the -lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) hybrid protein were generated by cotransfection of HEK293T cells. incubation was sufficient for maximum fusion and hence used in subsequent studies. jurkat cells were inoculated with X4 HIV-1 containing the BlaM-Vpr hybrid protein for 1 h on ice. virus was washed off and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for the indicated time period. fusion values at baseline (0 h) were subtracted. all subsequent mutations (M3 to M7) are located in relative close proximity to the FP sequence at the N terminus of gp41. all mutations are of conservative nature, presumably to preserve Env function in the resistance mutants. mutations in close proximity to the gp41 FP are shown in the surface representation. mutations include M5 (T244S), M3 (V489I), and M7 (N625K). to further investigate their impact on HIV-1 susceptibility to VIRIP-based inhibitors. the first four accumulating mutations (M1, M1-2, M1-3, and M1-4) had modest effects on the susceptibility of X4 HIV-1 NL4-3 to VIR-353. the addition of the fifth mutation (T244S) clearly enhanced VIR-353 resistance. the combination of all seven changes resulted in a 23-fold increased IC50 of 6.26 M. NL4-3 construct, the initial two alterations (V570I and A433T) had modest effects. subsequent changes of V489I, L545M, and T244S clearly reduced susceptibility to VIR-353 inhibition. however, R5-tropic HIV-1 constructs containing 4 amino acid changes showed a plateau in their dose-response curves. substitutions resulted in 25-fold reduced susceptibility of X4 HIV-1 to VIR-575 inhibition (IC50 11.14 M) even the combination of all seven changes reduced viral susceptibility only 4-fold compared to the parental R5 HIV-1 strain (IC50 1.28 M) 244S and M7 (N625K) had the most significant impact increasing the IC50 of VIR-353 from 0.27 M to 0.61 or 0.77 M, respectively. these two alterations had also the strongest (i.e., 3.1- and 4.7-fold) effect on susceptibility of X4 HIV-1 to VIR-576 inhibition (Fig. 3A and B, middle right) n are mean values obtained from triplicate infections indicate differences from the parental HIV-1 NL4-3 constructs. TZM-bl reporter cells provide a convenient and commonly used means for quantitative analyses of HIV-1 infection. up to 25-fold increases in IC50s were measured in PBMCs. but only between 3.5 and 10-fold effects were measured in PBMCs. essentially all mutations affect viral susceptibility to inhibition by VIRIP derivatives in a cumulative manner. HIV-1 constructs containing 4 amino acid substitutions were most severely attenuated and 5- to 10-fold less infectious than the parental virus. mutations in gp41 (M1, M4, M6, and M7) impaired virion infectivity in PBMC cultures more significantly than those located in gp120 (M2, M3, and M5) values represent mean values obtained from triplicate infections. VIR-353/576 resistance is associated with delayed and/or attenuated HIV-1 replication. mutations selected late during long-term passage in cell culture restore viral fitness. infections were performed using RT activity-normalized virus stocks. essentially each of the seven cumulative changes in the HIV-1 Env protein contributed to decreased sensitivity to inhibition by VIR-353/576 but also to decreased viral infectivity and replication. TZM-bl reporter cells were infected with infectivity-normalized X4 HIV-1 NL4-3 mutants carrying the indicated cumulative mutations in Env. infection rates were determined 3 days later. most mutations are located in close proximity to the gp41 FP domain. fusion studies of the parental X4 HIV-1 strain showed that 2 h of incubation was sufficient for maximum fusion. fusion kinetics of RT normalized X4 HIV-1 constructs showed clearly delayed fusion kinetics and efficacy, and subsequent mutations had further attenuating effects. jurkat cells were inoculated with X4 HIV-1 containing the BlaM-Vpr hybrid protein for 1 h on ice, virus was washed off and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for the indicated time period. fusion was determined after overnight staining with CCF2 by flow cytometry analysis. essentially all seven amino acid changes across the viral Env glycoprotein previously identified contribute to partial HIV-1 resistance to VIRIP derivatives VIR-353 and VIR-576. we further demonstrate that significant VIR-353/576 resistance is associated with grossly impaired HIV-1 infectivity and replication fitness in PBMC cultures. the effects of the mutations were consistent for both VIRIP derivatives and types of target cells (TZM-bl and PBMC) however, some quantitative differences were noted. for X4 HIV-1 the effect of the cumulative mutations on VIR-353 and VIR-576 sensitivity was more pronounced in TZM-bl cells than in PBMCs. interaction studies suggest that VIRIP-based inhibitors target the gp41 FP (9, 11, 26) none of the seven mutations is located in the FP region (13, 14) the results of Est\u00e9 et al. called this into question since none of the seven mutations is located in the FP region (13, 14) gp41 loop B and helix segments A and C rearrange into a long helix A-C (HR1) that inserts the FP into the cellular membrane. mutants 1 and 4 in loop B might directly influence this rearrangement. Mutation 7 is located in loop E that connects HR1 and HR2. mutations in C4 (M2, A433T) and C5 (M3, V489I) may alter its accessibility. a similar substitution (A558T) was identified in an independent study. several alterations (M3-V489I, M4-L545M, M5-T244S, and M7-N625) that are well apart in the linear Env sequence are located in very close proximity to the gp41 FP. initial attempts to generate VIRIP-resistant HIV-1 variants involved the generation of mutants containing random changes in two to three amino acid positions across the entire gp41 FP region. mutations in gp120 may render HIV-1-resistant against fusion inhibitors targeting the six-helix bundle formation of gp41 (28) changes outside the target region of gp41 affecting the coreceptor tropism can reduce viral susceptibility to CCR5 antagonists (30\u201332) VIR-353-resistant HIV-1 derivative remained fully sensitive to T20 and the CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor (AMD3100) mutations conferring resistance to VIRIP derivatives affect viral susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies or chemokines. occurrence would take substantially longer time periods and come at more severe fitness costs compared to other HIV-1 inhibitors. studies show that VIRIP-based inhibitors do not show cross-resistance to other antiretroviral agents (9) and were safe and effective in a clinical trial (11). the genetic barrier to resistance is high and associated with grossly impaired viral infectivity and replication fitness. studies on VIRIP-based inhibitors might pave the way toward analogous inhibitors of other dangerous enveloped viruses. injectable peptide drugs showing similar efficacy as VIR-576 in HIV-infected individuals would represent an enormous progress in the treatment of some human pathogens. mutations were generated using splice overlap extension PCR. env cassettes were cloned back into X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 (pBR_NL4-3) and its R5-tropic derivative where the V3-loop region of Env has been replaced by that of HIV-1 92TH014.12 (16). mutants were dissolved in 150 mM natrates. hek293T cells were seeded in 2 ml of medium in 6-well plates or in 20 ml medium in 75-cm2 flasks. hek293T cells were seeded in 2 ml of medium in 6-well plates. before transfection the next day, cells showed a confluence of 60 to 80% medium was changed. medium was replaced with fresh supplemented DMEM (2.5% [vol/vol] FCS) at 24 h after a medium change, the viral supernatant was harvested, briefly centrifuged (3 min, 1,300 rpm) to remove cellular debris. on the following day, 80 l of medium was added, and the cells were infected by adding 20-l virus stocks normalized for RT activity. 500,000 Jurkat cells were incubated with 1.0 ml of RT activity-normalized virus stocks at 4\u00b0C on ice for 1 h. cells were washed three times with cold PBS, resuspended in supplement RPMI 1640, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for various time periods. 5-l aliquots were dropped on Whatman filters, dried, washed three times with 2 SSC (1 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) and dried again at 65\u00b0C. the filters were stored in a cassette with a film at 4\u00b0C overnight. mutants were introduced into X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 (pBR_NL4-3) and its R5-tropic derivative where the V3-loop region of Env has been replaced by that of HIV-1 92TH014.12 (16). after introduction and verification of all mutations, env cassettes were sequenced to verify correctness. VIR-353 (LEAIPCSIPPCFLFNKPFVF) and VIR-576 (LEAIPCSIPPEFLFGKPFVF)x2 were prepared by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis as described previously (9, 11) and subsequently purified by reversed-phase chromatography. identity and homogeneity of the products were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, capillary zone electrophoresis, electrospray mass spectroscopy, and hek293T cells were seeded in 2 ml of medium in 6-well plates or in 20 ml medium in 75-cm2 flasks. before transfection the next day, cells showed a confluence of 60 to 80% medium was changed. medium was replaced with fresh supplemented DMEM (2.5% [vol/vol] FCS) after 6 to 16 h of incubation. 500,000 Jurkat cells were incubated with 1.0 ml of RT activity-normalized virus stocks at 4\u00b0C on ice for 1 h. the cells were washed three times with cold PBS, resuspended in supplement RPMI 1640, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for various time periods. a standard virus stock of known p24 antigen concentration and the samples of interest were diluted in PBS (1:3 to 1:5) the samples (5 l) were mixed with 25 l of RT mixture consisting of 2.5 ml of RT master mix, 10 l dithiothreitol, and 2.5 l of P32 isotope. aliquots were dropped on Whatman filters, dried, washed three times with 2 SSC (1 SSC is 0.15"}
