{"summary": "two types of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a commercial shell vial viral culture were performed to identify causative agents in pediatric patients. results positive samples from 220 total samples by two multiplex PCRs were 52.7% and 46.4%. adenovirus (AdV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIFV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been identified as significant pathogens in community-acquired and nosocomial respiratory infections. IAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract nucleic acid. the 220 nucleic acid extracts were kept in a deep freezer at - 75\u00b0C until analysis. the labopassTM kit was designed to detect 12 types of viruses. the final reaction volume was 50 L composed of 40 L premixture. HCoV, EnV, PIFV, RhV, and RSV operated at 42\u00b0C for 60 min. 200 L specimens were inoculated into the re-feed medium and 1.0 mL R-Mix ReadyCells. after overnight incubation at 35\u00b0C, cell monolayers of the shell vial were washed and fixed with acetone. if virus-specific fluorescence was noted by screening, virus identification was performed using individual monoclonal antibodies staining. all 220 pediatric patients were admitted with symptoms of severe lower respiratory infection. low respiratory viral infections were diagnosed through physical examinations, chest X-rays, blood tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) the SeeplexTM RV detection kit B is designed to detect IFV A, IFV B, RSV A, RSV B, rhinovirus (RhV), and HCoV OC43/HKU1. each PCR was conducted in a final reaction volume of 20 L containing 3 L of cDNA, 3 L of 8-methoxypsoralen (MOP) solution, 4 L of 5RV Primer, and 10 L of 2master mix. the PCR products were analyzed by identifying bands with a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. the PCR protocol was 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by 35 cycles of 60\u00b0C for 1.5 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min, followed by a 10 min final extension at 72\u00b0C. the labopassTM kit was designed to detect 12 types of viruses. the final reaction volume was 50 L composed of 40 L premixture and 10 L nucleic acid. 200 L specimens were inoculated into R-Mix ReadyCells and centrifuged at 700g for 60 min at room temperature. if virus-specific fluorescence was noted by screening, virus identification was performed using individual monoclonal antibodies staining (IFV A and B, AdV, PIFV 1,2,3 and RSV) the LabopassTM RV detection kit identified 116 viruses which were the sum of AdV (n = 14, 12.1%), HBoV (n = 4, 3.4%), HCoV 229E/NL63 (n = 5, 3.7%), IFV A (n = 8, 5.9%), IFV B (n = 9, 6.6%), HMPV (n = 2, 1.5%), PIFV 1 (n = 0, 0%), PIFV 2 (n = 0, 0%), PIFV 3 ( 103 samples showed a positive multiplex PCR of AdV, IFV, PIFV, and RSV. the shell vial culture assay showed 93 positive samples of the total 103 samples (positive rate 90.3%) there were two samples which showed 2 kinds of viruses. adenovirus (AdV), influenza virus (IFV), parainfluenza virus (PIFV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were detected in pediatric patients with viral pneumonia. ten samples of culture negative but any multiplex PCR positive were further analyzed. the labopassTM RV detection kit showed 46.4% positivity. 103 samples were proceeded shell vial cultures. vial culture assay showed 93 positive samples of the total 103 samples. positive viral culture rate from the SeeplexTM RV detection kit was 96.1%. positive viral culture rate from the LabopassTM RV detection kit was 77.7%. multiplex PCR positive but viral culture negative samples were further analyzed by sequencing. the results are shown in Table 3. The corresponding viruses were identified with a homology of 91-100%. the virus culture is still considered the gold standard for respiratory virus detection. but it has limitations in turnaround time, specimen transport, and storage conditions in maintaining the infectivity of the virus. the labopassTM RV kit detected more HMPV than the SeeplexTM RV kit for IFV and RhV. the PCR method could detect viruses two times more, compared with virus culture. the discrepancy might be caused by multiplex PCR limitations. multiplex PCR can be the first choice for detection of respiratory viruses in a clinical laboratory. other complementary efforts such as viral cultures and sequencing methods could be selectively proceeded."}
