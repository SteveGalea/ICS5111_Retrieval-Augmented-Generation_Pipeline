{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic infection that spills over from the dromedary camel reservoir to humans. it causes severe respiratory disease in humans with a case fatality rate of approximately 35%. the virus is endemic in dromedary camels across the Middle East, Africa and parts of South Asia. the force of infection (FOI) is defined as \u2018the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected per unit time\u2019. FOI can be estimated from disease prevalence data [15], and the product of FOI and the number of susceptible individuals will yield estimated incidence [16]. Previous studies on other pathogens have used prevalence data to estimate FOI and derive incidence in a population of interest [18, 19] a multi-level sampling strategy was employed. the overall sample size was 1421 camels from 83 herds. a list of households and the number of camels owned in each selected sublocation was used as the sampling frame. herds are defined primarily as camels that are raised extensively. differences between pastoral and ranch production systems exist in how breeding stock are sourced, migration and marketing of camels and camel products. the study area consisted of the five main camel-producing counties in Kenya, as determined previously [23], excluding those where travelling and sampling were not possible due to security concerns. the overall sample size was 1421 camels from 83 herds, with a probability sampling of herds from each county. individual animal data collected included age and sex. differences between pastoral and ranch production systems exist in how breeding stock are sourced. cross-sectional seroprevalence study included samples from 1421 dromedary camels from 83 herds in five counties. the overall individual-level seroprevalence was 63.7% (95% confidence interval 61.2\u201366.2%) at the herd level, 86.7% of herds had at least one seropositive camel. at the herd level, 86.7% of herds had at least one seropositive camel. county Isiolo 313 403 77.7 (73.6\u201381.7) Laikipia 27 181 14.9 (9.7\u201320.1) Marsabit 274 370 74.1 (69.6\u201378.5) Nakuru 7 50 14.0 (4.4\u201323.6) Turkana 284 417 68.1 (63.6\u201372.6) Age 1 60 157 38.2 (30.6\u201345.8) 1\u20132 107 223 48.0 (41.4\u201354.5) 2\u20133 95 infection estimates and AIC values of three models for pastoral and ranching camel herds in Kenya Pastoral herds Ranching herds Model FOI estimate AIC Constant FOI 0.47 790.58 0.039 34.24 Linear FOI 1 year 0.626 777.38 0.060 35.83 1\u20132 years 0.471 0.040 2\u20133 years 0.316 0.021 3+ years 0.161 0.001 Quadratic FOI 1 year 0.686 764. cross-sectional seroprevalence study included samples from 1421 dromedary camels from 83 herds in five counties. the overall individual-level seroprevalence was 63.7% (95% confidence interval 61.2\u201366.2%) at the herd level, 86.7% of herds had at least one seropositive camel (95% CI 79.5\u201394.0%) Camel seroprevalence by county, age and sex No. sampled % Positive (95% CI) County Isiolo 313 403 77.7 (73.6\u201381.7) Laikipia 27 181 14.9 (9.7\u201320.1) Marsabit 274 370 74.1 (69.6\u201378.5) Nakuru 7 50 14.0 (4.4\u201323.6) Turkana 284 417 68.1 (63.6\u201372.6) Age 1 60 157 38 3 show the observed mean seroprevalence for each age group with 95% confidence intervals. table 4 lists the sample size (number of observations) and seroprevalence per production system and age group. no camels tested positive among the 1 and 2\u20133 year age groups. % Positive (95% CI) 1 year 143 42.0 (33.9\u201350.0) 14 0 1\u20132 years 203 51.2 (44.4\u201358.1) 20 15 (0.6 to 30.6) 2\u20133 years 143 66.4 (58.7\u201374.2) 13 0 >3 years 803 78.8 (76.0\u201381.7) 82 12.2 (5.1\u201319.3) work in pastoral herds in northern Kenya has reported breeding females live to an average of 19 years. male calves are either slaughtered shortly after birth, or at about 4 years of age. dams of suckling calves also shed MERS-CoV, placing dams in the oldest age group. farming herds only used communal water sources, while ranching herds mostly kept herds within a fenced area. both of these management characteristics affect contact with other (potentially infectious) animals. the data from pastoral herds best fit an age-dependent model, while ranching herd data fit the age-independent model. this may reflect differences in herd management and structure. cross-sectional survey used multi-stage probability sampling. however, logistical constraints and convenience sampling led to a wide variation in the sampling fraction by county. inaccurate seroprevalence estimates in turn may affect the validity of FOI calculations. distribution of within-herd seroprevalence among pastoral and ranching herds is wide (0\u2013100%) and bimodal, with a cluster of low seroprevalence herds and a large cluster of high (>50%) seroprevalence herds. this distribution indicates that perhaps there are other factors within pastoral herds that also influence transmission risk."}
