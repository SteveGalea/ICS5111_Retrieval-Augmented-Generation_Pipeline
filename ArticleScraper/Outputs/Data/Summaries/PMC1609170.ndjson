{"summary": "the spike (S) protein is one of the best characterized proteins of SARS-CoV. it plays a key role in SARS-CoV overcoming species barrier and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans. the process of adaptive evolution of S protein and the exact positively selected sites associated with this process remain unknown. three specific replacements were only found between 03-human SARS-CoVs and strains from 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic group. selective sweep may also force evolution of S genes before the jump of SARS-CoVs into human hosts. residues at these positively selected sites are associated with receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion. two domains, S1 (residues 14\u2013680) and S2 (residues 681\u20131,255) were identified in SARS-CoV S protein. previous works indicated that interspecies transmission may be due to the acquisition of mutations in S protein which allows human infection. the process of adaptation of S protein to human receptors remains unclear. positive selection on S genes of SARS-CoV during the whole outbreak from 2002 to 2004. the average values ranged from 0.36 to 0.69 among all models. the likelihood values and parameter estimates of 45 S gene sequences from six models implemented in program codeml are listed in Table 1. model code lnL dN/dS Estimates of parameters 2l Positively selected sites M0

during whole epidemic was simplified into three epidemic groups: 02\u201304 interspecies, 03-early-mid, and 03-late epidemic groups. each group includes 15 unique S gene sequences after deleting duplicate sequences (Table S1, see additional file 2). 0 = 0.00000, = p1 = 0.99407 (p2 = 0.00593), 0 = 0.00, 1 = 0.38, 2 = 66.02 (13.28) M1a (NearlyNeutral) -5334.74 0.35 p0 = 0.65391 (p1 = 0.34609)

vs. M8). three selection models: M2a, M3 and M8 detected same positively selected sites on S genes. only the results from M8 are shown in Table 3. 25 and 16 sites were detected under positive selection ( > 1) in 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic group. the underlines represent the sites locating in receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues: 318\u2013510) of S1 domain or in heptad repeat (HR)1 (residues: 889\u2013972)-HR2 (residues: 1142\u20131185) region of S2 domain. positive selection tends to selectively influence certain functions of S protein. the fish's exact test was performed for HR1\u2013HR2 vs. RBD, and HR2 vs. RBD respectively. the 04-pcSARS-CoVs diverged from 03-pcSARS-CoVs after the split between 03-pcSARS-CoV and 03-huSARS-CoV. variants N479K and T743A may favor viral adaptation to palm civet. probability values and parameter estimates for 45 S gene sequences from six models implemented in program codeml are listed in Table 1. the average values ranged from 0.36 to 0.69 among all models, showing the evidence of purifying selection. 0.50712 (p2 = 0.05948), 0 = 0.12, 1 = 0.13, 2 = 9.68 (13.28) 75T 239S 244T 311G 479R 609L 613E 743R 765V

interspecies and 03-early-mid epidemic groups. the results for this group were consistent with purifying selection (with values of 0.25\u20130.26). 2a (PositiveSelection) -5319.78 0.77 p0 = 0.99407,

03-early-mid epidemic groups at the level of posterior probability > 0.50. ly-mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection ( > 1) at significant level of Bayes factor > 50. positive selection tends to selectively influence certain functions of S protein. results suggest positive selection tends to selectively influence certain functions of S protein, but not others in each epidemic group. the 04-pcSARS-CoVs diverged from 03-pcSARS-CoVs after the split between 03-pcSARS-CoV and 03-huSARS-CoV. the comparison of amino acid sequences between 03-pcSARS-CoV and 03-huSARS-CoV found two additional variants, L609A and V765A, which may favor viral adaptation to palm civet. confirmed that the S gene undergoes strong positive selection. identified 12 positively selected amino acid sites during the whole SARS outbreak. positions 239, 239, 244, 311, 479, 609, 613, 743, 743, 765, 778, 1148, and 1163 appeared to be exposed on the surface of S protein [9,24]. the two steps together result in the establishment of stable infection necessary for efficient spread within human hosts. the collection of SARS isolates was reclassified into three epidemic groups: 02\u201304 interspecies, 03-early-mid, and 03-late epidemic groups. positive selection prefers influencing receptor-binding function in 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic group. in 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic group, four positively selected sites 479, 609, 743 and 765 appeared to be fixed in 03-early-mid epidemic group. two positively selected amino acid substitutions (N479K and T743A) are likely to play a role in viral receptor switch. residue 743A (alanine) from 03-pcSARS-CoV appeared less potent against huSARS-CoV [34], suggesting that residue 743 may influence viral receptor tropism via a way different from ACE2 binding. however, the influence of residue 743 on potential interaction between S protein and DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNL remains unknown. selective sweep drives adaptive evolution of S gene from animals to humans. sites 778 and 1163 were located in the S2 domain of S protein. a strong neutralizing epitope containing residues 1055\u20131192 also implicated the possible role of residue 1163 in neutralizing antibodies. 78 sites are unlikely to participate in the viral adaptation process due to their location outside RBD and S2 domain regions. a total of 12 sites (75, 239, 244, 311, 479, 609, 613, 743, 765, 778, 1148 and 1163) in S protein were detected under positive selective pressure. 8 sites are exposed on the surface of S protein. the 03\u201304 epidemic phase represented the re-emergence of SARS in human patients (04-huSARS-CoV) and palm civets (04-pcSARS-CoV). the other two S sequences of SARS-like-CoVs isolated from bats were used as the outgroup of phylogenetic tree. 03-huSARS-CoVs and 04-pcSARS-CoVs clustered together, diverging from the clade formed by 03-huSARS-CoVs. this suggests that the origin of 03-huSARS-CoVs should be a virus strain, which was prevalence in palm civets or other animals before November 2002. the 02\u201303 epidemic phase included SARS-CoV sequences from animals (palm civets and the evolutionary process of S proteins during the whole SARS epidemic was simplified into three epidemic groups. each group might represent a unique epidemic phase in the whole SARS outbreak including initial animal-to-human transmission phase, adaptation to human receptor phase and subsequent lineage fixation phase. the null models M0, M1a and M7 fix the ratios between 0 and 1, and do not allow the presence of positively selected sites. the alternative models M2a, M3 and M8 account for positive selection by using parameters, which estimate greater than 1. 0.1 level of significance was used for both SLAC and FEL. default significant level of Bayes factor > 50 was used for REL. results of 45 sequences represent the whole SARS outbreak. phylogenetic analysis, tree construction and recombination analysis After deletion of identical sequences, only 45 distinctive sequences out of 100 S sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic tree of S gene was obtained by using ML (maximum likelihood) and NJ (neighbor-joining) (MEGA 3.0) [43] methods. the origin of 03-huSARS-CoVs should be a virus strain, which was prevalence in palm civets or other animals before November 2002. the 02\u201303 epidemic phase included SARS-CoV sequences from animals (palm civets and a raccoon dog) and the 03\u201304 epidemic phase contained 04-huSARS-CoV and 04-pcSARS-CoV. the evolutionary process of S proteins during the whole SARS epidemic was simplified into three epidemic groups. each group might represent a unique epidemic phase in the whole SARS outbreak including initial animal-to-human transmission phase, adaptation to human receptor phase and subsequent lineage fixation phase. the null models M0, M1a and M7 account for positive selection by using parameters, which estimate greater than 1. the alternative models M2a, M3 and M8 account for positive selection by using parameters which estimate greater than 1, and allow for the variable along codon sequence. 0.1 level of significance was used for both SLAC and FEL. default significant level of Bayes factor > 50 was used for REL. in the process of analysis, we failed to obtain the results of 45 sequences. all strains of 03-early-mid epidemic and 03-late epidemic groups were isolated from human patients. two outgroup sequences (B24 and B41) were isolated from horseshoe bats."}
