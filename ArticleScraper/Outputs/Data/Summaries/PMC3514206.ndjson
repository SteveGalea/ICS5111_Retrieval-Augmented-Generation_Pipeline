{"summary": "the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed. the 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine. other Salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions. the molecular characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give isolates collected. the most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin aggregative fimbria. water buffalo calves are more frequently affected by gastroenteritis than bovine calves. mortality rates as high as 70% in water buffalo species vs. 50% in bovine. water buffalo represents a suitable model to study causative agents of gastroenteritis. S. enterica serovars most frequently isolated were Typhimurium (n=13), Muenster (n=7) and Give (n=7). other recovered serovars were Derby (n=5), 4 Bovismorbificans (n=4), Newport (n=4), monophasic S. Typhimurium (B:4,12:i:-; n=3), Blockley (n=2), Meleagridis (n=2), Umbilo invA, sspH2, stfE, ipfD, bcfD, stbD, fimA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD, sopB were present in all the strains. the sopE gene was not found in any of these strains. a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp. (25%) in diarrheic water buffalo calves. the highly variable distribution of the observed serovars confirms the absence of a serovar specifically adapted to water buffalo. the definitive phage type 104 (DT104), which has often been associated with multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains with ascertained zoonotic potential, does not seem to be widely spread in water buffalo. the presence of more pathogens in the same subject might suggest that diarrhea in water buffalo calves can be characterized by a multifactorial etiology. the presence of more pathogens in the same subject might suggest that, as for other animal species, diarrhea in water buffalo calves can be characterized by a multifactorial etiology. S. Typhimurium and monophasic Typhimurium strains were further characterized by the molecular detection of 24 genes coding for virulence factors. the genetic characterization included five loci (avrA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD, and sopB) located on SPI 1\u20135, respectively [8], eight loci (gipA, gtgB, sopE, sodC1, gtgE, the three monophasic S. Typhimurium strains exhibited three different genotypes. however, the isolates with identical genotype displayed different phage types suggesting the presence of 13 different strains. protein TGCACGGGGAAAACTACTTC 436 [9] TGATGGGCTGAAACATCAAA sspH1 Salmonella secreted protein H2 GCACAACTGGCTGAAGATGA 203 This study TTTCCCAGAGACGGAACATCTC gtgE SPI2 type III secreted effector protein AGGAGGAGTAAAGGT 1114 [11] GTAGAACTGGTTTATGAC sodC1 Periplasmmic Cu, the loci invA, safC, bcfC, fimA and ssaQ were present in all the strains. the genes gipA, gogB, sspH2, sodC1, gtgE, spvC, stfE, ipfD and pefA were not found in any of these isolates, while the remaining loci were variably distributed. plasmidic spvC locus was absent in all the analyzed isolates. fimbrial genes and the SPI 1\u20135 genetic markers were discretely represented. molecular profiles allowed to identify 6 different genotypes out of the 7 S. Muenster isolates, and 5 different genotypes out of the 7 S. Give isolates. invA, safC, bcfC, fimA and ssaQ were present in all the strains. the genes gipA, gogB, sspH2, sodC1, gtgE, spvC, stfE, ipfD and pefA were not found in any of these strains. chromosome is likely to be horizontally acquired, and variably associated with enhanced invasion and intracellular survival within both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. loci pefA and spvC were absent in all the monophasic S. Typhimurium, S. Muenster and S. Give strains. the prophage virulence genes included in this study exhibited a variable distribution among the isolates tested. these loci were mostly present in S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium rather than in S. Muenster and S. Give isolates. strain #92 was the most virulent in mice in in vivo experiments. agfA gene coding for a thin aggregative fimbria involved in colonization of host intestinal epithelial cells. strain was isolated from one of the subjects with necrotic-ulcerative enterocolitis. the isolated Salmonella spp. were serotyped according to the Kaufmann-White scheme. the isolated Salmonella spp. were serotyped according to the Kaufmann-White scheme. coli hemolytic activity was evaluated by growing colonies on blood agar base. virulence factors (lt-heat-labile toxin, st-heat-stable toxin, stx1-Shiga toxin 1, stx2-Shiga-toxin 2, eae-intimin, cnf-cytotoxic necrotizing factor, and cdt-cytolethal distending toxin) were detected by three strains (S. Typhimurium #16, S. Typhimurium #92, S. Typhimurium #12) were selected for an in vivo analysis of virulence by using the Competitive Index (CI) resulting from mixed infections. two strains were selected that exhibited the highest and lowest number of virulence factors. CI was calculated using the formula: CI = output (strain A/strain B)/inoculum (strain A/strain B) all animal handling and sampling procedures were performed under the conditions of the local ethics committee meeting the requirements of Italian legislation. virulence factors (lt-heat-labile toxin, st-heat-stable toxin, stx1-Shiga toxin 1, stx2-Shiga-toxin 2, eae-intimin, cnf-cytotoxic necrotizing factor, and cdt-cytolethal distending toxin) were detected by molecular assays. for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. competition assays in mice Groups of five age matched (8\u201310 weeks old) female BALB/c mice used in this study were purchased from Charles River. at 4 (IP) or 7 (os) days after infection, mice were sacrificed, spleens were aseptically removed, and bacteria were counted by plating serial dilutions (output) the ratio of two strains in the input and in the output was evaluated by picking and transferring 200 colonies on selective plates."}
