{"summary": "the family Coronaviridae is now organized into two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. CCoV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus and forms a unique species, Alphacoronavirus 1, along with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) and its derivative, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) (1, 2). the aim of the present study is to report the detection of pantropic CCoV in some European countries. a total of 354 carcasses of dogs that died after displaying systemic disease consisting of fever, leukopenia, depression, enteritis, respiratory distress, and/or neurological signs were sampled from 2009 to 2011. all RNA extracts were subjected to a previously established TaqMan-based reverse transcription-PCR assay for rapid detection and quantification of CCoV RNA (16), with minor modifications. a one-step method was adopted using Platinum quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen srl, Milan, Italy) CCoV-F 16 TTGATCGTTTTTATAACGGTTCTACAA + 6585\u20136611a 99 CCoV-I/II CCoV-R AATGGGCCATAATAGCCACATAAT 6660\u20136683a CCoV-Pb FAM-ACCTCAATTTAGCTGGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGT CCoV-IIa 174-268 CAACATGTAACCTTTGTGTGTGATCTGC 13002\u201313029c CCoV-IIb RT-PCR VNVF This study ACTTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTATACAATCTTAAACA 5660\u20135686a a Oligonucleotide position in reference to the sequence of CCoV-Ia strain 259/01 (GenBank accession number AF502583 samples that tested positive for CCoV-II were subjected to gel-based RT-PCR assays targeting the spike (S) protein gene and using primer pair 20179/INS-R-dg or 20179/174-268 (8). PCR products were detected by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and visualization under UV light. infected cells were monitored daily for the occurrence of a cytopathic effect (CPE) after 5 days of incubation, they were tested for CCoV antigen by an immunofluorescence assay using a monoclonal antibody targeting the Alphacoronavirus 1 nucleocapsid protein. sequences were manually edited and analyzed using the bioEdit software package (18) rotaviruses (23), caliciviruses (24), canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) (25, 26), canine distemper virus (28), canine minute virus (29), canine minute virus (29), canine minute virus (29), and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) total of 354 carcasses of dogs that died after displaying systemic disease consisting of fever, leukopenia, depression, enteritis, respiratory distress CCoV positive No. of dogs CCoV-IIa positive Dogs Internal organs France 92 57 11 7 Hungary 75 18 7 7 Italy 69 12 7 6 The Netherlands 27 12 4 2 Belgium 4 3 1 1 Bulgaria 1 0 0 0 Total 354 124 33 24 RNA extraction.

CCoV RNA was detected in 124 (35.02%) out of 354 sampled dogs. the remaining strains were recognized as TGEV/CCoV recombinant viruses (CCoV-IIb) oV (CCoV-IIa positive in internal organs) were generally low, ranging from 1.20 101 (liver of an Italian dog) to 8.16 105 (lung of a Hungarian dog) copies l1 of template were detected in the bladder and lymphoid tissues of infected dogs. each symbol represents a clinical sample; bars indicate the median values. despite the absence of common markers, most pantropic viruses except two French strains (322/09 and 45/10-6) were closely related to each other. these viruses showed a close genetic relatedness to reference strains CB/05 and 450/07. CCoV-IIa enteric strains Insavc-1 (D13096), BGF10 (AY342160) and 03-3684 (FJ009113); CCoV-IIb 341/05 (EU856361), 174/06 (EU856362), 430/07 (EU924790), and 118/08 (EU924791); CCoV-I 23/03 (AY307021); and feline corona s were characterized as CCoV-IIa (19.35% of the CCoV-positive dogs) the remaining strains were recognized as TGEV/CCoV recombinant viruses (CCoV-IIb) that can occasionally spread to internal organs. the highest median CCoV titers were detected in the bladder and lymphoid tissues of infected dogs. despite the absence of common markers, most pantropic viruses except two French strains (322/09 and 45/10-6) were closely related to each other, displaying nucleotide and amino acid identities ranging from 92% to 100% and from 90.5% to 100%, respectively. phylogenetic analysis of pantropic CCoV based on the partial 5\u2032 end of the spike protein gene of Alphacoronavirus 1. CCoV-IIa pantropic strains CB/05 (DQ112226) and 450/07 (GU146061); CCoV-IIa enteric strains Insavc-1 (D13096), BGF10 (AY342160), and 03-3684 (FJ009113); an italian dog was coinfected by CPV-2c and CRCoV. only four dogs (one French, one Belgian, one Hungarian, one Italian) were shown to have single infections by pantropic CCoVs. however, the identification of CPV-2 prevents any definitive association between pantropic CCoV and the death of the infected dogs from being established. two french viruses were more closely related to enteric CCoVs than to other pantropic viruses. these viruses were recovered from dogs housed in the same breeding kennel. both dogs were coinfected with CPV-2b. practitioners and scientists should be adequately alerted about the circulation of pantropic CCoV strains. a possible explanation is that in most cases clinical samples and carcasses had not been properly stored before the virus isolation attempts."}
