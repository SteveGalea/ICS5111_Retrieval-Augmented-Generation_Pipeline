{"summary": "SARS presents as an atypical pneumonia that often leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, the main cause of death. there is no effective therapeutic strategy or preventive vaccine available for the treatment of SARS. ACE2 expression is consistent with the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. innate immune response plays an essential role in the inhibition of viral infection. many genes involved in the innate immune response, such as those encoding lactoferrin (LF), S100A9 and Lipocalin 2, participate in SARS-CoV clearance. LF is able to prevent the internalization of some viruses by binding to HSPGs. LF can block the infection of SARS pseudovirus by binding to HSPGs. this suggests it may exert a protective role in host immune defense against SARS-CoV invasion. fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2. pQCXIX, gag/pol and gag/pol plasmids were co-transfected. viral supernatants were harvested and filtered through screens with 0.45-m pore size. unbound pseudovirions were removed by three washes with PBS. cells were cultured with fresh DMEM with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. tests of HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells were performed by the same method.

GFP-expressing cells in total population were analyzed by flow cytometry. the relative viral infection ratio was measured by comparing the percentage of GFP expressing cells to that of the control. HSPGs act as primary binding sites, promoting viral docking. murine coronavirus uses HSPGs as a receptor for cell entry. this suggests that HSPGs may also play an important role in the process of SARS-CoV infection due to the similarity of the spike protein structures of these two viruses. HSPGs play an important role in the process of SARS-CoV cell entry. anchoring sites permit initial contact between SARS-CoV and host cells. LF blocks the infection of SARS-CoV by binding to HSPGs. LF does not disrupt the interaction between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor in vitro. but LF inhibits spike protein binding to HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells. the target molecules on the cell membrane that LF interact with are HSPGs.
