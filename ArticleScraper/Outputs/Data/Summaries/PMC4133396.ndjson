{"summary": "SARS-CoV spread to more than 30 countries within six months, infecting 8000 people with an average mortality of 10% [1] after July 2003, only a few community and laboratory-acquired cases have been reported. by now, 701 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been diagnosed in several countries. phipathic -helix that oligomerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes [11]\u2013[13]. E protein is present within virions in very small amounts. it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) it actively participates in virus budding, morphogenesis and trafficking. PDZ domains are protein\u2013protein recognition sequences, consisting of 80\u201390 amino acids that bind to a specific peptide sequence (PBM), usually located at the end of the carboxy-terminus of a target protein [25]\u2013[27]. PDZ domains are found in thousands of proteins and are widespread in eukaryotes and eubacteria [29]. p38 MAPK inhibitor showed a significant increase in survival after infection with SARS-CoV. a set of recombinant SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM were generated using an infectious cDNA encoding a mouse adapted (MA15) SARS-CoV causes morbidity, mortality and pulmonary pathology. SARS-CoV-E-wt represents the wild type sequence. in SARS-CoV-E-PBM and SARS-CoV-E-mutPBM, E protein PBM was eliminated by deletion or point mutations, reducing or maintaining the full-length protein. PBM reached similar titers at 72 hpi, both in Vero E6 cells and in DBT-mACE2 cells. this result indicated that SARS-CoV E protein PBM was not essential for efficient virus growth in vero E6 cells. body weight (Figure 2A) and mortality (Figure 2B) of each mouse were monitored daily. mice infected with the viruses in which E protein PBM was abolished (mutPBM) or deleted (PBM) showed moderate or no weight losses, respectively, and 100% survival in both cases. elimination of E protein PBM led to virus attenuation in vivo. mutant potPBM in which 4 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal domain were mutated to alanine. lung pathology was examined in infected mice at 2 and 4 dpi. no obvious gross lesions or changes in weight were observed in lungs. lungs of mice infected with recombinant viruses were highly edematous. lung sections were collected at 2 and 4 dpi, stained with hematoxylin and eosin. pulmonary histopathology scores for edema and cellular infiltrates were quantified. mice infected with recombinant viruses showed minimal epithelial damage. 319 genes were differentially expressed in mice infected with mutPBM compared to wt. most downregulated genes in mutPBM versus wt infections clustered within wound response and inflammatory and defense response pathways. most significant genes present in at least one of these groups were serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), chemokine (C-X-C motif) lig differential expression of cellular genes identified in the microarray was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis using RNA from the lungs of mice infected with viruses with or without E protein PBM. rRNA was used to normalize the data [36], [37] using both microarray and RT-qPCR. candidate genes that were downregulated in mutPBM infected mice were grouped on Gene Ontology terms. numbers indicate the fold change for each gene in mutPBM versus wt-infected mice. expression of inflammatory cytokines evaluated by RT-qPCR. all 13 recovered syntenin cDNAs interacting with the E protein carboxy-terminus contained the same two PDZ domains present in the cellular syntenin. sequence of SARS-CoV E protein and the region containing amino acids 36\u201376 (SARS-CoV ECT) was used as bait for the yeast two-hybrid screening. mediated through the E protein PBM, vero E6 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding an N-terminal HA-tagged syntenin. non-transfected cells were used as control. syntenin or E protein were immunoprecipitated using extracts of infected cells using an HA specific monoclonal antibody. syntenin was mainly localized at perinuclear regions as previously described. infection with the mutPBM virus led to N protein cytoplasmic localization. syntenin was mainly detected in the nucleus of cells transfected with an empty plasmid. syntenin colocalized with E protein in the perinuclear region. syntenin accumulated in the cytoplasm of 98.5% of the cells infected with the parental virus. the activation of p38 MAPK was studied by Western blot analysis at 2 dpi. a phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38) specific antibody was used to detect the active form. Actin served as loading control. phosphorylated p38/total p38 MAPK ratio in wt, E, PBM, mutPBM and potPBM infected mice at 2 dpi (C) or vero E6 cells at 24 hpi (D) Error bars represent the means of three mice analyzed for each condition. histone H3, total p38 MAPK and actin were used as controls. syntenin levels in the cytosol fraction were increased during wt infection. mutPBM virus retained the ability to mislocalize a substantial amount of syntenin to the cytoplasmic fraction. histone H3 (H3), total p38 MAPK (Total p38) and actin were analyzed. as controls, histone H3, total p38 MAPK and actin were analyzed. p38 MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blot. siRNAs specifically designed to inhibit syntenin expression were used in mock-infected cells or infected with the parental virus. rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected mice were treated with a control buffer or SB203580, a highly specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK. mice treated with the inhibitor showed 100% survival and no signs of clinical disease. survival increased to 80% as compared with non-treated mice. 16-week-old mice were mock-infected or inoculated intranasally with 100,000 pfu of wt virus. at 4 hpi and every 12 h from days 1 to 8, mock pfu of wt virus. at 4 hpi and every 12 h from days 1 to 8, mock h from days 1 to 8. mutated or truncated (SARS-CoV-E-PBMs) were generated using an infectious cDNA encoding a mouse adapted (MA15) SARS-CoV-MA15 causes morbidity, mortality and pulmonary pathology. in SARS-CoV-E-PBM, abbreviated as PBM, the last 9 amino acids of E protein were deleted, truncating the carboxy-terminus, and eliminating the PBM. PBM+ and PBM represent the presence or absence of a PBM within E protein sequence, respectively. subconfluent monolayers of vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells were infected with wt, E, PBM, mutPBM and potPBM viruses at an MOI of 0.05. 16-week-old female BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with recombinant viruses. weight loss (A) and survival (B) were monitored for 10 days. data represent two independent experiments with 5 mice per group. elimination of E protein PBM led to virus attenuation in vivo. mutant potPBM in which 4 amino acids in carboxy-terminal domain were mutated to alanine, conserving consensus residues in the PBM was still virulent. titers in the lung were determined at 2 and 4 dpi. lungs of mice infected with recombinant viruses were highly edematous, with profuse hemorrhagic areas leading to significant lung weight increase at 4 dpi. 16-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 100,000 pfu of wt, E, PBM, mutPBM and potPBM. lung sections were collected at 2 and 4 dpi, stained with hematoxylin and eosin. pulmonary histopathology scores for edema and cellular infiltrates were quantified. mice infected with recombinant viruses containing functional E protein PBM showed interstitial and peribronchial cell infiltration. 319 genes were differentially expressed in mice infected with mutPBM compared to wt. of these, 218 genes were found to be upregulated and 101 genes were downregulated. most of the downregulated genes in mutPBM versus wt infections clustered within wound response and inflammatory and defense response pathways. 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used to normalize the data [36], [37] using both microarray and RT-qPCR. we identified genes differentially expressed in the lungs of mice infected with viruses with or without E protein PBM. Viruses lacking E protein PBM induced a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines. a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the carboxy-terminal domain of SARS-CoV E protein. a random-primed cDNA library from human lung was screened. the interaction was classified with a high confidence score (predicted biological score of B) the region containing amino acids 36\u201376 (SARS-CoV ECT) was used as bait for the yeast two-hybrid screening. numbers at the bottom indicate the amino acids at the beginning and the end of the different domains. blot analysis using E and HA specific antibodies revealed that E protein coprecipitated with syntenin in cells infected with recombinant viruses containing the wt or potential E protein PBM (Figure 5C). this results indicate that the last 4 amino acids of SARS-CoV E protein form a functional PBM that, in the context of virus infection, mediate its association with the cellular protein syntenin. vero E6 were mock-infected or infected with the wt virus at an MOI of 0.3 (A) or transfected with an empty plasmid (E) or a plasmid expressing SARS-CoV E protein (+E) (B) at 24 hpi and 24 hours post transfection, respectively, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and E or N proteins (red) and syntenin (green) were labeled syntenin accumulated in the cytoplasm of 98.5% of the cells infected with the parental virus. in cells infected with the mutPBM virus only 51.5% showed syntenin in the cytoplasm. syntenin partially colocalized with SARS-CoV E protein, and was redistributed to perinuclear regions. p38 MAPK activation was studied in infected cells. to this end, vero E6 cells were mock-infected or infected with recombinant viruses with an E protein with or without a PBM. p38 MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blot at 24 hpi. mutPBM virus retained the ability to mislocalize substantial amount of syntenin to the cytoplasmic fraction. mutPBM virus retained the ability to bind SARS-CoV 3a protein to the cytoplasmic fraction, possibly due to the ability of E protein to bind SARS-CoV 3a protein. syntenin relocalization from nucleus to cytoplasm mediated p38 MAPK activation was studied. levels of histone H3, total p38 MAPK and actin were used as controls. syntenin was only detected when the syntenin was overexpressed. a plasmid encoding a HA-tagged syntenin (HA-syntenin) and the presence of syntenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus and active p38 MAPK were detected by Western blot at 24 hpt. as controls, histone H3, total p38 MAPK, and actin were analyzed. at 24 hpt, cells were mock-infected or infected with the parental virus at an MOI of 0.3. syntenin mRNA levels were significantly reduced in syntenin-silenced cells. this silencing was found to have a higher apparent impact on the reduction of this protein in the cytoplasm. mice treated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor showed 100% survival. survival increased to 80% as compared with non-treated mice. p38 MAPK activation is an important factor for SARS-CoV-induced disease. at 4 hpi and every 12 h from days 1 to 8, mock hpi and every 12 h from days 1 to 8 mock-infected and wt-infected mice were intraperitoneally injected with SB203580. the active phosphorylated (p-HSP27) and total HSP27 amounts were quantified by western blot analysis. mutant viruses containing altered or deleted E protein PBM sequences were generated using an infectious cDNA clone encoding a SARS-CoV adapted to efficiently grow in mice. recombinant viruses lacking E protein PBM were attenuated in vivo, causing minimal lung damage, and no mortality in infected mice. recombinant viruses lacking E protein PBM were highly pathogenic causing 100% mortality. the expression of genes involved in the innate immune response was significantly reduced in mice infected with SARS-CoV lacking E protein PBM. the interaction of syntenin and SARS-CoV E protein was specifically mediated by a functional PBM located in the last 4 amino acid of the E protein. p38 MAPK activation was significantly reduced in mice infected with viruses lacking E protein PBM. p38 MAPK activation correlated with the acquisition of an attenuated phenotype in SARS-CoV lacking the PBM. syntenin and PALS1 interaction with E protein might provide different and even complementary contributions to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. aviruses tolerate amino acid changes in the carboxy-terminus of E protein. alanine substitutions in MHV E protein carboxy-terminal residues were apparently lethal, since no virus was recovered. however, it has not been excluded whether other viral proteins different from E provide alternative PBMs. infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) the delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells expressing mACE2 receptor (DBT-mACE2) were generated in our laboratory. blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies specific for HA tag (dilution 110,000;
