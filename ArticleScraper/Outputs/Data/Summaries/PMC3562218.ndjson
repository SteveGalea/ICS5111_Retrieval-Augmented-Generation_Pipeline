{"summary": "ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital respiratory disorder characterized by abnormal ciliary motility leading to chronic airway infections. qualitative evaluation of ciliary beat pattern based on digital high-speed videomicroscopy analysis has been proposed. primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare congenital respiratory disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:15\u201330,000 live births. the diagnosis of PCD is usually based on the detection of abnormal motility and ultrastructural defects found in most of the cilia. patients TEM analysis of cilia, NOn measurement and study of ciliary beat pattern were performed in 34 patients consecutively referred to our PCD diagnostic center. patients with unfeasible TEM and NOn measurement were excluded from the study. Ciliary ultrastructural results expressed as a percentage of abnormal cilia among the total number of cilia analyzed [16]. for each ciliary ultrastructural study, axonemal abnormalities were quantified. the ultrastructural phenotype was defined by the main ultrastructural defect (involving the dynein arms or microtubules) each movie was composed of 1,800 frames with a definition of 256 192 pixels. each movie was composed of 1,800 frames with a definition of 256 192 pixels. Pixel size was (0.13 0.13) m2. video sequences were played back frame by frame in order to determine three points characterizing the complete cycle of each cilium. five time-points were defined at the tip of the cilium corresponding to the steps of one beating cycle. global frequency, power stroke duration and recovery duration, the pauses after the active and recovery strokes, total pause, cilia length and beating angle were also calculated. in cartesian coordinates P i P j = x i - x j 2 + y i - y j 2 *The angle of beating, P 1 P 0 P 2, is given by the law of cosines. the non-PCD group was defined by a combination of > 90% abnormal cilia with NOn 100 nl/min. the inconclusive group was defined by discordant TEM and NOn results. comparison of age, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PaO2 between the three groups was performed using a statistical software package. the presence of bronchiectasis and situs inversus were assessed on high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) scan in all patients. patients with unfeasible TEM and/or NOn measurement were excluded from the study. ciliated edges were recorded with a digital camera (PixeLINK A741, Ottawa, Canada) at a rate of 355 frames per second. each movie was composed of 1,800 frames with a definition of 256 192 pixels. each movie was composed of 1,800 frames with a definition of 256 192 pixels. quantitative analysis of ciliary beat pattern In each patient, the percentage of beating ciliated edges was first determined. in each of the 20 areas, an epithelial edge with a majority of cilia beating was scored 1; an edge with half of cilia beating was scored 0.5 and an edge with a minority of cilia beating was scored 0. The percentage of beating ciliated edges was defined as the sum of the scores divided by 20. videomicroscopy parameters of ciliary beat pattern of a cilium were measured. the three positions of the cilium (base of the cilium, P0, positions of the tip before the active and recovery strokes, P1 and P2 respectively) and the five time-points of beating (start and arrival of the active stroke, t1 and t2 respectively, and start of the following cycle, t5) were measured. weighted area swept per second = % of beating edges P 1 P 0 P 2 / 2 L c 2 f g 1 second. ciliary dyskinesia score was inferred for each patient. five time-points were defined at the tip of the cilium corresponding to the steps of one beating cycle. start and arrival of the active stroke (t1 and t2, respectively), start and arrival of the recovery stroke (t3 and t4) and start of the following beating cycle (t5) were measured. global frequency, power stroke duration and recovery duration, the pauses after the active and recovery strokes, total pause, cilia length and beating angle were also calculated. the weighted area swept per second = % of beating edges L c P 1 P 0 P 2 / 2 L c 2 f g 1 second. ciliary ultrastructure and NOn measurement was used as the \"gold standard\" for PCD diagnosis. group was defined by 20% of abnormal cilia with NOn 100 nl/min. inconclusive group was defined by discordant TEM and NOn results. ciliary ultrastructure and NOn measurements were considered normal. 8 patients presented more than 70% normal cilia associated with abnormal NOn (100 nl/min) the abnormal NOn level was always confirmed by a second NOn measurement performed at least six months later. no significant difference was observed between the three groups for age, FEV1, FEV1/VC and PaO2. 33 Childhood Y N Nd CB RS 98% 93% 99 Group: Non-PCD 11(F) 26 Childhood N N N Nd CB Normal 69% 70% 78 12(F) 27 Childhood N N Y CB SOM RS 83% 72% 96 13(M) 41 Childhood N N N Y CB SOM RS 86% 75% 95 14(M) 32 Birth N N N Nd CB SOM RS 50% 85% 77 15(F) 20 Adult 1% 66% 68 32(F) 34 Childhood Y N Y CB RS 31% 44% 64 33(F) 36 Childhood Y N Y CB SOM RS 70% 92% 93 34(M) 21 Birth N N Nd CB SOM RS 79% 83% 90 Abbreviations: PCD, primary ciliary dyskinesia; F, female; M, male; N, no; Y, yes; SI, situs inversus; CB 11.1 100 ODA N 9 100 100 0 0 3 0.0 0.0 6 100 ODA N 10 100 100 0 0 3 0.0 0.0 13 100 ODA N Group: Non-PCD 11 0 0 0 0 0 53.3 184.6 809 7 No N 12 10 0 10 0 0.25 82.8 267.8 260 1.5 No N 13 5 0 5 0 0.15 53.7 148.2 219 2 No N 14 5 0 5 0 eous N 31 70 0 70 0 2.1 29.3 97.9 1 0 No N 32 55 5 45 5 1.40 28.6 90.1 1 10 Heterogeneous Poor 33 0 0 0 0 0.0 76.0 242.8 262 55 ODA+IDA Poor 34 60 15 40 5 1.55 5.7 17.8 6.4 22 CC N Abbreviations: Vi, Virtually immotile; St, Stiff; Ci, Circular; NOn, nasal all digital high-speed videomicroscopy parameters tested were significantly different between the PCD and non-PCD groups. the weighted distance traveled by the cilium per second and the weighted area swept per second by the cilium had the best AUC (0.984 and 0.977, respectively). cilium tip per second was weighted by the percentage of beating ciliated edges. the symbols of the non-PCD and non-PCD groups represent the mean values standard deviation. in the inconclusive diagnosis group, the beat frequency tended to be lower in patients with outer dynein arm defects. PCD was confirmed with absence of dynein arms affecting most of the cilia combined with a low level of NOn. in the non-PCD group (15 patients), ciliary ultrastructure and NOn measurements were considered normal. in the inconclusive diagnosis group (9 patients), no conclusion could be reached because of discordant results between TEM and NOn. 28 Childhood N N Nd CB SOM RS 90% 75% 95 8(M) 47 Childhood Y Y Y Y CB SOM RS 102% 78% 83 9(F) 46 Birth Y Y Y Nd CB SOM RS 100% 75% 96 10(F) 33 Childhood Y N Nd CB RS 98% 93% 99 Group: Non-PCD 11(F) 26 Childhood N N Nd CB Normal 69% 70% 78 12( SOM RS 50% 66% 77 29(M) 59 Adult N N Y CB RS 86% 69% 96 30(M) 44 Childhood N N Y CB SOM RS 81% 78% 107 31(F) 26 Childhood Y N Y CB RS 31% 44% 64 33(F) 36 Childhood Y N Y CB SOM RS 70% 92% 93 34(M) 21 Birth N N N N Nd CB SOM RS 7 5 50 0 1.4 5.8 16.0 34 100 IDA+NL N 6 75 30 45 0 2.03 5.2 12.9 4.2 100 ODA N 7 10 5 5 0 0.25 27.1 87.9 59.8 100 ODA N 8 100 90 10 0 2.95 0.6 1.8 11.1 100 ODA N 9 100 100 0 0 3 0.0 0.0 6 100 ODA N Group: non-PCD 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 53.3 0.0 0.0 17 6.5 Heterogeneous N 28 60 45 15 0 1.75 9.1 27.3 15 14 Heterogeneous Poor 29 20 0 20 0 0.5 30.3 85.6 93 21 ODA N 30 90 90 90 0 0 0 0 2.7 0.0 0.0 5 30 Heterogeneous N 31 70 0 70 0 2.1 29.3 97.9 1 0 No N 32 55 5 45 5 1.40 28.6 90.1 1 10 patients presented very heterogeneous results with a percentage of normal beat patterns ranging from 8 to 100% and a ciliary dyskinesia score ranging from 0 to 2.7. all digital high-speed videomicroscopy parameters tested were significantly different between the PCD and non-PCD groups. in the inconclusive diagnosis group, the quantitative parameters provided by digital high-speed videomicroscopy were helpful to orientate the diagnosis of PCD in 6/9 patients. in four patients, mean weighted distance traveled per second was below the 100% specificity cutoff, supporting the diagnosis of PCD and for two patients, this parameter was above the 100% sensitivity cutoff. ciliary ultrastructure and NOn measurement were used as a reference method for diagnosis of PCD. TEM analysis of cilia was combined with TEM analysis in order to more accurately define the PCD and non-PCD groups. however, the variants of PCD with normal ciliary ultrastructure are clearly a limitation of such a gold standard as TEM alone misses the diagnosis. digital high-speed videomicroscopy can be used to develop quantitative parameters that objectively characterize ciliary beat pattern. the average duration of a complete assessment (including video recording and analysis) is about one hour per patient. the mean ciliary beat frequency measured in this study was significantly lower in PCD patients than in non-PCD patients with chronic airway infections. quantitative analysis concluded to the non-PCD diagnosis with a 98% sensitivity and the qualitative evaluation showed a low dyskinesia score (0.25) in 1/11 patients (# 7) with a conclusive PCD diagnosis, qualitative evaluation showed a low dyskinesia score (0.25) while the quantitative parameters were just below the threshold of 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity. the proposed method is a trial to get a better classification of PCD. in the inconclusive group, the proposed parameters can be helpful to assess the diagnosis of PCD while the measurement of ciliary beat frequency alone is not helpful. using this type of procedure could reclassify two patients as possibly excluded PCD (patients # 26 and 33) and four patients as possibly confirmed PCD (patients # 27, 28, 30 and 34) this type of selection would decrease by almost one third the indications for TEM analysis in patients with suspected PCD. this pilot study should promote additional studies on a larger series of patients. d\u2019imagerie de l\u2019Institut Jacques Monod, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Paris 7) for his help in the development of digital high-speed videomicroscopy.
