{"summary": "inflammation is a critical event in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and cancer. increased levels of adhesion molecules may contribute to the recruitment of PMNs to the various regions of the lung during the inflammation process. the catalytic gp91phox subunit is partially regulated by the assembly of the catalytic gp91phox subunit with the regulatory subunits. the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen, generating superoxide anions and other forms of ROS as by-products. elevated levels of ROS have been shown to activate signal transduction cascades and to drive the expression of adhesion molecules. physicochemical properties of curcumin have improved. this includes a reduction in compound particle size, the formation of a high-energy amorphous state, and the induction of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. the improvement in drug release has enhanced the antioxidant and anticancer effects of CURN.

CURN inhibits TNF--induced lung inflammatory responses. A549 cells were pretreated with 50 M CURN, CURH, DPI (10 M) or Tanshinone II A(10 M) for 1 h, and then incubated with 30 ng/ml TNF- for 24 h. the data are expressed as meanS.E.M. of three independent experiments. NOX2 consists of membrane catalytic subunits gp91phox and p22phox. p47phox, p40phox, p67phox, and a small GTPase Rac plays a critical role in the acute activation of NOX. the p47phox regulatory subunit plays a critical role in the acute activation of NOX. the fluorescence intensity (relative DCF fluorescence) was measured. A549 cells were pretreated with antioxidants (NAC, APO and DPI) for 1 h. the levels of ICAM-1 protein were determined by Western blot. effects of CURN pretreatment on phosphorylation of p-ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 were compared with that of CURH. pretreatment with CURN, NAC and DPI also resulted in a significant decrease in TNF-induced MAPKs phosphorylation. CURN decreases AP-1 activation in TNF-treated A549 cells. CURN decreases AP-1 activation in AP-1 and NF-B cells. the CURN caused down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression in TNF-stimulated A549 is mediated by inhibition of AP-1 activation. CURN reduced ICAM-1 expression in the lung alveolar epithelial cells in TNF-injected mice. CURN prevents TNF-induced acute lung inflammation in vivo. mice were intraperitoneally injected with CURN or CURH (200 mg/kg) for 1 h, followed by acute challenged with TNF-(0.75 mg/Kg) by laryngoscopy for 24 h. TNFR1 antibody, ICAM-1 antibody, CURN and CURH for 1 h prior to TNF- (0.75 mg/kg) treatment. CURN distribution in the lung is higher, suggesting a better anti-inflammatory effect compared to that observed with CURH. CURN reduces ICAM-1 expression in TNF-treated cells. compared effects of CURN and CURH on TNF-induced ICAM-1 expression. similar results were also observed in human pulmonary endothelial cells. CURN inhibits TNF-induced in ICAM-1 gene and protein levels in A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated with CURN (0\u2013100 M) for 24 h. levels of ICAM-1 protein were determined by Western blot. CURN inhibits TNF-induced NADPH oxidase activity and ROS generation ROS have been implicated in initiating inflammatory responses in the airway through the activation of transcription factors such as NF-B and AP-1. a fluorescent probe was used to determine the generation of ROS in these cells. p47phox phosphorylation and translocation were inhibited by CURN and APO. however, CURH showed no effects on p47phox phosphorylation and translocation. pretreatment with CURN, DPI, and APO also resulted in a reduction in NADPH oxidase activity in response to TNF-. the membrane fractions were prepared and subjected to Western blot. CURN, CURH, 10 M DPI, and 100 M APO(100 M) were pretreated with 50 M CURN, CURH, 10 M DPI, and 100 M APO for 1 h, and then incubated with 30 ng/ml TNF- for 30 min. CURN inhibits TNF--modulated MAPKs activation in A549 cells. no similar effects were observed with that using CURH. CURN imparts stronger inhibitory effects than CURH on phosphorylation. gel-shift assays were performed to determine the effects of CURN and CURH on AP-1 and NF-B activation in TNF--treated A549 cells. pretreatment with CURN for 24 h inhibited an increase in AP-1 binding activity, whereas binding was significantly increased after TNF- treatment for 30 min. untreated cells or from cells with or without 24 h pretreatment were tested for (A) AP-1 and NF-B DNA binding activity by EMSA. cells were pretreated with 50 M CURN, CURH or 10 M DPI for 1 h, and then incubated with 30 ng/ml TNF- for 24 h. the levels of ICAM-1 protein were determined by Western blot. mice were attenuated by intraperitoneally of TNFR1-antibody, ICAM-1-antibody, CURN, but not by CURH. CURN prevents TNF-induced acute lung inflammation in vivo. single dose of CURN and CRUH in mice with TNF-induced lung injury. CURN can distribute greater amounts of curcumin in the lung tissues. CURN can increase curcumin uptake in lung cells, and result in better antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. the low level of water solubility of curcumin has become a major limiting factor in preclinical dissolution testing for drug and health food applications. for curcumin to exhibit its therapeutic effects in the human body, a person is required to swallow between 12 and 20 g of curcumin per day. binding activity of the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 to TNF-stimulated lung epithelial cells was not observed using CURH treatment. CURN treatment results in a decrease in the ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 1B) but only partially affects monocyte adhesion and leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 5C) NOX is a multi-subunit enzymatic complex responsible for the production of superoxide caused by the monoelectronic reduction of oxygen using NADPH or NADH. transfection with siRNAs of NOX2 and p47 phox can block expression of ICAM-1 in response to TNF-. phosphorylation of p47phox acts as the organizer of NOX2 complex. CURN reduced ICAM-1 expression through inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity and p47 phox activation in the membrane fraction of TNF-treated A549 cells. CURN, but not CURH, markedly inhibited TNF-induced MAPKs phosphorylation, which may be mediated through its potent antioxidant activities. we first confirmed the involvement of NF-B and AP-1 in TNF-induced ICAM-1 expression by incubation with inhibitors of Bay117082 and Tanshinone IIA. we demonstrated that binding of NF-B and AP-1 to the ICAM-1 promoter was increased by TNF- and that pretreatment with CURN significantly attenuated TNF--induced AP-1 binding activity. peritoneally injected CURN results in a higher curcumin level distribution in the lungs compared to that using CURH. this suggests that CURN can increase the cell uptake in the lungs and then show better anti-inflammatory activities than CURH."}
