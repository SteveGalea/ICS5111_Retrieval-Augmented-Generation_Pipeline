{"summary": "the weekly proportion of laboratory tests that are positive for influenza is used in public health surveillance systems. sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. the sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32\u201334%), varying from 30\u201340% depending on the season and region. the recommendation to collect more ideal specimens is likely to improve diagnostic sensitivity. the performance characteristics of currently available tests for influenza vary considerably. the overall sensitivities of these tests when used in routine practice are also dependent on the type of specimen collected, the age of the patient and point in their illness in which they are sampled. fluWatch surveillance data does not provide the total number of tests by age. culture accounted for 44% of the diagnostic tests with RT-PCR, rapid antigen tests and direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) the weekly number of influenza negative tests attributed to RSV is given by 7 RSVp w., and similarly for adenovirus and PIV. for each positive influenza A test, an additional 5 tests above baseline were performed and found to be negative. sequential testing may occur if a rapid test for influenza is negative. the laboratory then performs PCR or culture testing. in young children with a respiratory illness in the winter, rapid tests for RSV infection may be performed first. influenza A was confirmed in all age groups and sporadic cases were confirmed in all age groups. infants and children under the age of 5 years accounted for 25% of the influenza A positive tests, and persons over the age 65 years another 35%. regression model allows simultaneous estimation of effects of influenza activity on the number of influenza-negative tests while controlling for other factors. the weekly number of influenza negative tests attributed to RSV is given by 7 RSVp w., and similarly for adenovirus and PIV. sensitivity for adenovirus and adenovirus given by 1/ 8 and 1/ 9 respectively. 1/ 7 - 1/ 9 were not interpreted as estimates of the sensitivity for other viruses. a rapid test for influenza is negative and the laboratory then performs PCR or culture testing. positive tests suggest false negative results contributed to the large number of negative tests during periods of influenza activity. the sensitivity for influenza A testing averaged 33.7% (with model-estimated 95% confidence intervals of 33.3\u201334.1) estimates of sensitivity by influenza season were obtained by estimating separate 5,y parameters, one for each season. seasonal differences may be due to irregular reporting and the tendency of data irregularities to bias the model parameters 5,y towards the null, or sensitivity towards 1. testing appears to have been elevated for a number of weeks in January 2000 during the peak of the 1999/2000 A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) season in which respiratory admissions were unusually elevated [26], [27], and in December 2003, when an elevated risk of paediatric deaths associated with the A/Fujian/411/02 strain [28] was identified. the baseline accounts for routine tests in the hypothetical absence of influenza, RVS, adenovirus and parainfluenza activity. the blue area corresponds to tests attributed to influenza, with the light blue area corresponding to tests confirmed positive for influenza. the weekly proportion of tests confirmed positive for influenza peaked each season at 15 to 30%. samples are taken from a variety of clinical settings and processed with a variety of procedures across the country. variation in the indications for diagnostic testing may vary across the country. a large proportion of negative test results was expected. the accuracy of diagnostic tests is known to be affected by the quality of the specimen [10], [11], its handling, the timing of collection after symptom onset, and the age of the patient [14], [15]. for most laboratory tests, specimen procurement within 72 hours of from the onset of symptoms is recommended [6], yet patients often present much later in the course of illness. over two relatively mild years, 20% of admissions for acute respiratory infections (including influenza) in adults aged 20\u201364 years were attributed to influenza, and 42% for seniors [1]. it would have been helpful to analyze data based on each specimen sent for testing. attribution of an influenza negative test that was actually co-infected with influenza would have to be split between the viruses. estimates of the burden of illness drive planning for preventive and therapeutic interventions. it is important to improve all aspects leading to improved diagnostic accuracy."}
