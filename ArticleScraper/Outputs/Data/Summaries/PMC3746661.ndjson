{"summary": "Patrinia villosa (PV) is a commonly used Chinese medicinal plant. it grows in eastern, central, southern and southwest areas of china. it has been widely used in the Chinese medicinal formula. Lee et al (2008) used multiplex bead array analysis to measure plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines in 50 healthy controls. they finally found IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- were significantly elevated in PID patients before antibiotic treatment than after treatment. however, IL-8 was not significantly different between healthy controls and PID patients. all the animals were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University (Hangzhou, China) the animals were kept in a room under environmentally controlled conditions of 222\u00b0C and a 12h light\u201312h dark cycle. all the animals were acclimatized at least a week. the thickness of each ear was measured by vernier calipers. percent inhibition was calculated: inhibition (%)=(VcVt)/Vc100%, where Vc and Vt respectively represented the average paw volume of the model-control rat and the rat under drug treatment. sterile pre-weighed cotton pellets (501 mg) were implanted in the lumbar region of each rat through an incision. the PV group was orally administrated EPV at 0.08g/kg and DEX group was orally administrated dexamethasone at 1.44mg/kg for 7 consecutive days. the pelvic inflammation models were induced by injecting 0.08ml of 20% phenol mucilage into the right uterus of rats. 15 days after the model rats were established, they were randomly divided into four groups. the PV group was orally administrated EPV at 0.55g/kg and DEX group was orally administrated saline at 8ml/kg for 28 days respectively. all the animals were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University (Hangzhou, China) the animals were kept in a room under environmentally controlled conditions of 222\u00b0C and a 12h light\u201312h dark cycle. all the animals were acclimatized at least a week. the thickness of each ear was measured by vernier calipers. percent inhibition was calculated: inhibition (%)=(VcVt)/Vc100%, where Vc and Vt respectively represented the average paw volume of the model-control rat and the rat under drug treatment. six rats were ether anaesthetized after shaving off the fur. the PV group was orally administrated EPV at 0.08g/kg. the CON group was orally administrated saline at 8.44mg/kg for 7 consecutive days. villosa group (PV), dexamethasone group (DEX group) and model-control group (CON group) with N=6 in each group. percent inhibition was calculated: inhibition (%)=(VcVt)/Vc100%. test drugs were administrated orally 1h prior to the carrageenin injection. cotton pellet induced granuloma test The method of Trnavsky et al.(1965) was used in the test. the effects of PV on the serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- in the model rats with pelvic inflammation models were induced by injecting 0.08ml of 20% phenol mucilage into the right uterus of rats. the other 24 rats were used as the pelvic inflammatory model rats. results and Discussion Ear edema test in mice Both of DEX and EPV showed potently inhibitory effects in the ear edema test. PV had significant anti-inflammatory effects with a inhibition percentage of 784%, 804% respectively at 0.25h and 0.5h. the significant difference was set at a p 0.05, compared with the CON group; b p 0.05, compared with the DEX group. the serum IL-6 levels of PV group, DEX group and NOR group were significantly lower than those of the CON group (P0.05), and the serum IL-6 levels of PV group were significantly lower than those of the CON group (P0.05). the serum IL-8 levels of PV group, DEX group and NOR group were significantly lower than those of the CON group (P0.05) the serum IL-8 levels of PV group were significantly higher than those of the CON group (P0.05) the significant difference was set at ap 0.05, compared with the CON group; b p 0.05, compared with the NOR group. ear edema test, carrageenin-induced paw edema test, cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and acetic acid-induced writhing test all showed that PV had strong anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. ear edema test in mice showed potently inhibitory effects in the ear edema test. the significant difference was set at ap 0.05, compared with the CON group; b p 0.05, compared with the DEX group. from 3h to 5h, the inhibition rate of DEX group decreased. EPV showed significantly inhibitory effects on the writhing numbers. PV had more eminent effects than DEX (Table 2). the serum levels of TNF-, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly lower than those of the CON group. the significant difference was set at ap 0.05, compared with the CON group; b p 0.05, compared with the NOR group; c p 0.05, compared with the DEX group. the main bioactive compounds of PV are saponins and volatile substances. the results of the ear edema test, carrageenin-induced paw edema test, cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and acetic acid-induced writhing test all showed that PV had strong anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. the dosage of PV for all the activities evaluated is based on the results of the preliminary experiments."}
