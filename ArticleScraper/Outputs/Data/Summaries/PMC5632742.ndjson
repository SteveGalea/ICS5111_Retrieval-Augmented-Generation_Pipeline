{"summary": "fibroblasts are present in all tissues but predominantly in connective tissues. their origin is mesenchymal, and, depending on their localization, they have multiple morphologies. they may be flattened, elongated or of a certain spindle-shape. fibroblasts should be considered sentinels against microorganisms or microbial components. innate immune system is first line of response to pathogens. recognition of pathogens is mediated by TLRs, which recognize specific pathogens associated molecular patterns. the flagellin of gram-negative bacteria can be recognized by TLR5 and TLR7. TLR8 recognizes single-stranded viral RNA and TLR9 identifies viral and bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) unmethylated CpG motifs. expression of TLR10 has been induced by exposure to Helicobacter pylori. the synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) mimics the response to bacterial DNA. fibroblasts express TLR4 in the presence of the hyphae or conidia of Fusarium solu. fibroblast sentinels demand, \"Where are you going, bad boy (pathogen)\" they shoot antimicrobial peptide-reaching pathogens. LL-37 is capable of eliminating extra- and intracellular S. aureus. limbo-corneal fibroblasts produced -defensin hBD-1 and cathelicidin LL-37 when stimulated with mycobacteria. corneal fibroblasts secreted hBD-2 in the presence of intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia spp., while corneal fibroblasts expressed DEFA-3, which is an -defensin. the fibroblasts secrete molecules important to the immune response with respect to antimicrobial activity. the fibroblasts said, \"we have and effective weapon against the pathogens. We are amazing cells!\" the sentinel fibroblasts released the alarm (proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines) to notify the remaining cells. the proteins secreted by the cells of the innate or adaptive immune response. the interferon gamma (INF) is an important cytokine directed against both intracellular and extracellular pulmonary pathogens. monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, lymphocytes, mast cells, paneth cells, mesenchymal intestine cells, and keratocytes can produce TNF. cytokines regulate monocyte and leucocyte trafficking and induce migration to peripheral sites of the pathogen challenge. the sentinel fibroblasts have other instruments with which to defend against intruders and to stimulate cell proliferation as growth factors. the sentinel fibroblasts say their communication method with the gremmie members was the best. the fibroblasts synthesize VEGF, promote the recruitment of cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, and induce inflammatory neovascularization. the growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) play roles in immune responses, survival, cancer pathogenesis, proliferation of macrophages, erythrocytes, eosinophils, megakaryocytes. fibroblasts recruit inflammatory cells in response to microorganisms and induce cellular proliferation. innate immune system is first line of response to pathogens. microbial recognition, activation of signaling pathways, and activation of an effector mechanism. the flagellin of gram-negative bacteria can be recognized by TLR5 and TLR7. TLR8 recognizes single-stranded viral RNA and TLR9 identifies viral and bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) unmethylated CpG motifs. fibroblasts are functionally active (TLR1 to TLR9, but not TLR10). can induce TLR corneal and gingival fibroblast expression, such as an LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the tetra-acylated lipid A LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the LPS from Escherichia coli. the synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) mimics the response to bacterial DNA. fibroblast sentinels demand, \"Where are you going, bad boy (pathogen)\" they shoot antimicrobial peptide-reaching pathogens. LL-37 is capable of eliminating extra- and intracellular S. aureus. limbo-corneal fibroblasts produced -defensin hBD-1 and cathelicidin LL-37 when stimulated with mycobacteria. corneal fibroblasts secreted hBD-2 in the presence of intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia spp. fibroblasts secrete molecules important to the immune response with respect to antimicrobial activity. fibroblasts say, \"we have and effective weapon against the pathogens. we are amazing cells!\" the interferon gamma (INF) is an important cytokine directed against both intracellular and extracellular pulmonary pathogens. the interferon gamma (INF) is an important cytokine directed against both intracellular and extracellular pulmonary pathogens. limbo-corneal myofibroblasts synthesize IL-6 in the presence of poly I:C [23] limbo-corneal myofibroblasts synthesize IL-6 in the presence of poly I:C. inflammatory and autoimmune activity provides different responses to tissue damage, fever, tumor necrosis, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. cl9, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 are involved in the cellular migration of natural killer cells (NK), macrophages, T cells, neutrophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. previous data had suggested the capacity of fibroblasts to induce chemokines when there was a microbial infection and to cause recruitment of inflammatory cells. epidermal fibroblasts challenged with supernatants from planktonic cells of S. aureus. this information indicates the ability of the fibroblasts to synthesize VEGF. the growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor play roles in immune responses, survival, cancer pathogenesis, proliferation of macrophages, erythrocytes, eosinophils, megakaryocytes. fibroblasts are stromal cells that play an important role in establishing a response against microorganisms. fibroblasts are stromal sentinel cells that possess \u201cweapons\u201d as TLR\u2019s to recognize microbial agents."}
