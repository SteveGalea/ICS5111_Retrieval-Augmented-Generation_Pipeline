{"summary": "existing algorithms for QC of LC-MS-based untargeted proteomics data are not designed for streaming applications (14) but for comparison to the state-of-the-art, QC-ART is compared with several existing algorithms and results are compared in a post-hoc fashion to determine if QC-ART performs as well as better than existing approaches in a dynamic manner. QC-ART QC-ART is an algorithm that uses a dynamic linear model to flag anomalies while accounting for typical instrument change over time. if the data appear anomalous in the context of the baseline set, the sample is flagged for follow up by a technician. QC-ART is more accurate than traditional PCA methods at identifying outlying observations. rPCA is more accurate than traditional PCA methods at identifying outlying observations. obis distance is used to score the instrument runs transformed to the rPCA space. the resultant scores, called QC-ART scores, are not guaranteed to follow a distribution; therefore, cutoff values based on percentiles of a common distribution are not appropriate. previous QC methods assume a static linear model to the QC metrics, which implicitly assume the mechanism generating the data is unchanged throughout the course of the experiment. QC-ART scores can be translated to probabilities by using the probability distribution function implied by the static and dynamic models. probabilities derived from the static model are interpreted as the probability that an extreme LC-MS analysis occurred given the baseline data only. the probability threshold used to identify outlying instrument runs is chosen by the user. QC-ART QC-ART is an algorithm that uses a dynamic linear model to flag anomalies while accounting for typical instrument change over time. only metrics that can be computed in a rapid fashion are used to perform this task in near-real time. rPCA was used to identify a subset of initial variables in conjunction with domain expertise associated with common sources of altered LC-MS data quality. for label-free proteomics data, only the NIST QC metrics are used. static and dynamic linear models are used to define threshold values for the QC-ART scores. the threshold values are chosen to control the probability of a false positive, i.e. a good quality instrument run was flagged as being of poor quality. isolated large scores are interpreted as a single instrument run. QC-ART scores can be translated to probabilities by using the probability distribution function implied by the static and dynamic models. probabilities derived from the static model are interpreted as the probability that an extreme LC-MS analysis occurred given the baseline data only. a score akin to a p value is used to identify samples that may be outliers. Fig. 1 illustrates the generic workflow for QC-ART. once data collection has started, variables are computed for each instrument analysis in near-real time. the model is fit using a baseline set of data, and as each new sample is analyzed by the instrument, it is immediately scored. rPCA is more accurate than traditional PCA methods at identifying outlying observations. the resultant scores, called QC-ART scores, are not guaranteed to follow a distribution. previous QC methods assume a static linear model to the QC metrics. static and dynamic linear models are used to define threshold values for the QC-ART scores. the threshold values are chosen to control the probability of a false positive, i.e. a good quality instrument run was flagged as being of poor quality. existing post-hoc QC Algorithms RMD-PAV is a post-hoc analysis technique used to identify outlier LC-MS data based on all of the quantified peptide peak intensities. the observed peptide peak intensities are summarized as an abundance distribution represented by a set of statistical metrics, such as median and skewness. the model is fit using a baseline set of data, and as each new sample is analyzed by the instrument, it is immediately scored. if the data do not show any anomalous behavior in the context of the baseline set, then the sample is flagged for follow up by a technician. rPCA is more accurate than traditional PCA methods at identifying outlying observations. the resultant scores, called QC-ART scores, are not guaranteed to follow a distribution; therefore, cutoff values based on percentiles of a common distribution are not appropriate. static and dynamic models are used to define threshold values for the QC-ART scores. the threshold values are chosen to control the probability of a false positive, i.e. a good quality instrument run was flagged as being of poor quality. isolated large scores are interpreted as a single instrument run that warrants further investigation. QC-ART is compared against RMD-PAV and InSPECtor for both data sets. a total of 141 LC-MS runs were performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. 28 LC-MS analyses identified as potentially outlying (4). QC-ART and RMD-PAV method achieved larger true-positive rates for the same false-positive rate over a limited range of cutoff values. the area under the curve is 0.820 for QC-ART, 0.823 for RMD-PAV and 0.816 for InSPECtor. QC-ART is able to achieve comparable levels of accuracy as both post-hoc techniques but in real-time. the variables used by QC-ART to identify instrument runs of poor quality are described in Table I. the variables derived from the reporter ion file (top section) are used only when available, iTRAQ instrument runs. RT-Duration RT_MSMS_Q4 The interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration. the first ten fraction sets of data collected after instrument cleaning, calibration and running an independent QC sample were treated as the baseline for all future instrument runs. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters, drop in instrument performance, gap in analysis and (5) diluted samples. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters, (3) drop in instrument performance, (4) gap in analysis and (5) diluted samples. QC-ART correctly flagged the poor-quality test runs in July 2015. a full set of samples seemed to be too concentrated and was then diluted before reanalysis, which led to differences in data quality. QC-ART did not identify the diluted samples in late April 2016. QC-ART could identify the poor-quality test runs in July 2015, and the diluted samples in April 2016. this is likely because data acquired just before it was included in the baseline set. QC-ART could not identify the last group of instrument runs before the gap in January 2016. the inSPECtor outlier scores were computed using a neighborhood size of 10. some of the diluted samples were correctly flagged to be of poor quality. but the large shift in instrument performance at the end of the cohort prevents RMD-PAV from identifying many of the other phenomena of interest during this study. the average pairwise correlation between the peptide abundance vectors for each sample is used in place of the average group correlation defined in Equation (1) of Matzke et al.(4). the large group of samples with scores above the threshold starting in may 2016 suggests that RMD-PAV could recognize that data processed at the end of the study differ systematically from data collected at the beginning of the study. however, the data collected just before the gap does not look to be of poor-quality based on RMD-PA peptide in this region was determined to be GQYCYELDEK. it corresponds to amino acid residues 177\u2013186 of human vitronectin. this peptide lacks methionine residues, which are easily oxidized and usually set as a possible modification location. oxidation on cysteine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues was recently identified. results showed enrichment in oxidations of cysteine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues. oxidation on cysteine, tryptophan, tyrosine and proline residues was recently identified by an unbiased database search analysis of HEK293 proteome. a total of 141 LC-MS runs were performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. the data were expertly curated, and 28 LC-MS analyses identified as potentially outlying (4). the same five statistics were used to summarize each LC-MS run. QC-ART and RMD-PAV perform comparably across the range of possible cut-off values. compared with QC-ART and RMD-PAV, the InSPECtor method achieved larger true-positive rates for the same false-positive rate over a limited range of cutoff values. area under the curve for each method is 0.820 for QC-ART, 0.823 for RMD-PAV and 0.816 for InSPECtor. each of the resulting 62 TEDDY samples was fractionated into 24 fractions, resulting in 1488 individual samples for LC-MS/MS analysis. the remaining iTRAQ channel (119) was not used. the variables used by QC-ART are described in Table I. interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration RT_MSMS_Q1 The interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration RT_MSMS_Q1 The interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration. a set of instrument runs collected during peak instrument performance were chosen. new baseline is needed, which allows the method to correctly identify instrument runs of poor quality without negatively impacting the false alarm rate. if an instrument run was known or later judged to be of poor-quality, its value was not used to update the dynamic threshold model. for future studies employing QC-ART, flagged samples will be reanalyzed immediately. in January 2016, the instrument behavior dropped significantly (labeled \u201cDrop in instrument performance\u201d) and led to a period of instrument recalibration and cleaning (labeled \u201cGap\u201d). in April 2016, a full set of samples seemed to be too concentrated and was then diluted before reanalysis. QC-ART correctly flagged the poor-quality test runs in July 2015. the poor-quality test runs in July 2015 have very large scores. the scores leading up to the gap in January 2016 increased as the instrument performance drops. QC-ART can also be used as a post-hoc data quality tool. the upward trend in outlier scores starting in January 2016 indicates that InSPECtor could detect the degradation in instrument performance before the gap in early 2016. based on the chosen 95% threshold, InSPECtor identified the poor-quality test runs in July 2015 and data from some of the diluted samples in may 2016. the RMD-PAV scores were derived from the pooled reference sample data because the data from the individual samples exhibited unwanted variation because of biological differences between the donors. the suggested group average correlation variable typically used by RMD-PAV was replaced with a global average correlation. however, the data collected just before the gap does not look to be of poor-quality based on RMD-PAV scores. the sequence of a peptide in this region was determined to be GQYCYELDEK, which corresponded to amino acid residues 177\u2013186 of human vitronectin. this peptide lacks methionine residues, which are easily oxidized and usually set as a possible modification location. the final oxidation counts were normalized by the total number for each amino acid. the results showed enrichment in oxidations of cysteine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues. oxidation on cysteine, tryptophan, tyrosine and proline residues was recently identified by an unbiased database search analysis. QC-ART scores are plotted in an interactive dot plot along with dynamic and static thresholds to identify instrument runs that may require further evaluation. the source code used by the online application to implement the QC-ART method is freely available as the R package QCART on GitHub. the inSPECtor method was implemented with a neighborhood size of ten to parallel the baseline choice for QC-ART. results for other baseline sizes are given in supplemental File S1. QC-ART and RMD-PAV perform comparably across the range of possible cut-off values. a total of 2252 plasma samples from 368 donors were pooled together by donor. each 8-plex iTRAQ set was fractionated into 24 fractions. the remaining iTRAQ channel (119) was not used. interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration RT_MSMS_Q4 The interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration RT_MSMS_Q4 The interval for the fourth 25% of all MS/MS events divided by RT-Duration. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters and drop in instrument performance. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters, (3) drop in instrument performance, (4) gap in analysis and (5) diluted samples. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters, (3) drop in instrument performance, (4) gap in analysis and (5) diluted samples. s the number of ions entering the ion trap; (3) inserting a dead volume in the LC tubing; (3) changing the mass spectrometer S-lens from 69 to 25%; (4) increasing the number of microscans, which reduces the overall number of collected spectra. QC-ART correctly flagged the poor-quality test runs in July 2015. two new baselines were chosen in October 2015 and again after the gap in experimental runs in early 2016. both retraining periods coincide with significant instrument maintenance. the poor-quality test runs in July 2015 have very large scores. the scores leading up to the gap in January 2016 increased as the instrument performance drops. the change in instrument performance over time cannot be detected with the InSPECtor method. the instrument runs starting in march 2016 do not appear to be different from those that occurred much earlier in the study. the upward trend in outlier scores starting in January 2016 indicates that InSPECtor could detect the degradation in instrument performance before the gap in early 2016. the iTRAQ 8-plex configuration used for this study creates results for six individual samples and a pooled reference sample. the iTRAQ 8-plex configuration creates results for six individual samples and a pooled reference sample. the suggested group average correlation variable typically used by RMD-PAV was replaced with a global average correlation. a thorough manual inspection was carried out for several LC-MS runs with similar behavior. only small differences were observed in peak intensities and overall shape of the total-ion chromatogram. some regions revealed different peak distributions compared with corresponding fractions in different iTRAQ sets. methionine, cysteine, tryptophan and tyrosine oxidations have been described in specific oxidative stress conditions. oxidation on cysteine, tryptophan, tyrosine and proline residues was recently identified by an unbiased database search analysis of HeLa and HEK293 proteome (29) QC-ART scores and thresholds are computed using default parameter values. advanced users can manipulate tuning parameters such as the baseline size and the proportion of variability explained by the principal components. QC-ART scores were computed using the same five statistics except for the group-wide correlation coefficient. the first ten LC-MS runs that were not suspected of being outliers were used as the baseline for QC-ART. the inSPECtor method was implemented with a neighborhood size of ten to parallel the baseline choice for QC-ART. a subset of 2252 plasma samples from 368 donors were pooled together by donor. each 8-plex iTRAQ set was fractionated into 24 fractions. each of the resulting sets was fractionated into 24 fractions. the variables used by QC-ART are described in Table I. skew Skewness of the blank reporter ion channel File I121_median Median of the reference reporter ion channel WAPIC_skew Skewness of the weighted average percent intensity correction Missingness Percentage of missing data over all ions P_2C Number of tryptic peptides. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters, (3) drop in instrument performance, (4) gap in analysis and (5) diluted samples. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs with deliberately mistuned instrument parameters, (3) drop in instrument performance, (4) gap in analysis and (5) diluted samples. iTRAQ sets 16 and 17 test runs were flagged as poor-quality datasets. we also collected 10 samples using deliberately mistuned mass spectrometry parameters and liquid chromatography gradient. the mistuned parameters were: (1) changing the mass spectrometer front lens voltage from 8 to 6, which affects the number of ions entering the ion trap; (2) inserting a dead volume in the LC tubing, which affects the chromatographic performance. two new baselines were chosen in October 2015 and again after the gap in experimental runs in early 2016. the poor-quality test runs in July 2015 have very large scores, with the scores leading up to the gap in January 2016 increasing. QC-ART could identify the last group of instrument runs before the gap in January 2016. study was analyzed by the InSPECtor and RMD-PAV methods in a post-hoc fashion, i.e. the respective methods are applied once all the samples were analyzed at least once. the change in instrument performance over time cannot be detected with the InSPECtor method. the peptide reporter ion intensity data for each sample within each fraction set was extracted using MASIC (24) the full data set was reduced so only the initial analysis of each iTRAQ set was retained. the iTRAQ 8-plex configuration used for this study creates results for six individual samples and a pooled reference sample. QC-ART flagged the LC-MS/MS run based on all three-baseline choices using both the dynamic and static thresholds. a thorough manual inspection was carried out for several LC-MS runs with similar behavior. oxidation on cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine and proline residues was recently identified. oxidation on cysteine, tryptophan, tyrosine and proline residues was recently identified by an unbiased database search analysis. QC-ART is a novel and powerful real-time QC tool. its flexibility sets it apart from existing QC methods. the researcher simply uploads their data to the application. QC-ART scores and thresholds are computed using default parameters. QC-ART is equally or more accurate than RMD-PAV and InSPECtor. but the QC scores for each sample were available immediately after peptide identification and other data processing was completed. the inclusion of NIST variables such as BPMZ skew, MS1 2B and P 2C allowed QC-ART to identify samples that were prepared incorrectly. QC-ART is an important addition to the existing proteomics QC toolkit. QC-ART can significantly reduce the amount of time required to identify and re-run samples that may have been subject to unwanted sources of variability."}
