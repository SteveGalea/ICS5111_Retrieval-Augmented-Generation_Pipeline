{"summary": "ovine lymphatic cannulation model characterizes in vivo cellular immune response. liposomes facilitate delivery of antigen to antigen-presenting cells. liposomes facilitate the delivery of antigen to antigen-presenting cells. liposome formulations were injected subcutaneously in the area drained by the pre-femoral lymph node at 500 l per injection using a 25-gauge needle. the liposome formulations and CpG were kindly provided by Pfizer Animal Health, now Zoetis Research and Manufacturing (Parkville, Vic., Australia) the pre-femoral lymph nodes of merino sheep were removed at 1 year of age. a secondary surgery was performed where a heparin-coated polyvinyl chloride cannula was inserted into the pseudoafferent lymphatic vessel of the sheep. eight sheep with reliable flow of afferent lymph were used in this study. cells were resuspended at 1 107/ml in Qiazol (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg, The Netherlands) for RNA analysis and FACS, samples were prepared by resuspending 3 106 afferent lymph cells in 25 l Fc-block. antibodies used were anti-MHC II-Pacific blue (clone 49.1, locally produced), anti-CD14-A700 (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), anti- RNA quantity was measured using a Nanodrop (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and RNA quality as assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) afferent lymph cells before and 72 hr following vaccination with liposome alone and liposome + CpG. the targeted minimum number of reads per sample was 20 million reads (see Supporting information, Table S1). analysis of RNA sequencing data Sample sequencing reads were aligned to the complete sheep genome using star v20201 (default parameters, see ref. 17). cDNA was synthesized from RNA using a Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit. cDNA was synthesized using primer 3 software on annotated ovine mRNA sequences. real-time PCR was performed on individual samples in triplicate. liposome formulations were injected subcutaneously in the area drained by the pre-femoral lymph node at 500 l per injection using a 25-gauge needle. pre-femoral lymph nodes of merino sheep were removed at 1 year of age. afferent lymph cells were collected before injection ( 2 hr) and 72 hr after injection. cell pellet was washed with 10 ml ice-cold PBS + 2 mm EDTA. cell pellet was resuspended in 9 ml ice-cold wash buffer twice. cell receptor-FITC (clone 86D, locally produced), anti-CD45R (clone 20.96, locally produced) and anti-mouse IgG1 coupled to phycoerythrin were sorted using an Influx cell sorter. cellular RNA was extracted from total afferent lymph cells and sorted afferent lymph cells using an RNeasy micro kit. libraries were generated with 100 ng total RNA using the Truseq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) clusters were generated using on-board clustering on the Illumina Hiseq1500; 1 100 bp single read Rapid Mode sequencing was performed on the Illumina Hiseq1500 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. expression data were overlayed on a custom map created in Pathway Map Creator. real-time PCR was performed on the RNA sequencing samples. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using a Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit. results Composition of afferent lymph 72 hr following vaccination with liposome alone or liposomes incorporating CpG Afferent lymph is composed of lymphocytes, DC and monocytes. Approximately 10% of the lymphocyte population was not identified using these markers. liposomal CpG induced a significant increase in the percentage of monocytes in afferent lymph at 72 hr when compared with liposome alone. Vaccination with the OVA liposome + CpG formulation induced the differential expression of 125 genes in afferent lymph cells 72 hr after injection. this gene was identified as a novel protein coding gene (Table1). 78 genes were differentially expressed in the CpG group compared with the liposome alone group at this time-point. total number of DE* genes 1 125 78 Number of genes related to immune system 0 80 53 Number of genes related to other systems 0 19 12 Number of genes with unknown function 0 9 1 Number of genes unknown 1 17 12 * DE = differentially expressed, where P 005, false discovery rate 001 and 15-fold mean fold change was required to reach significance. liposome + CpG induced significant up-regulation of many antiviral genes. most highly expressed include IFIT3, IFIT2, ISG17, IFIT1, ISG20, IFI44, MX1, BATF2, IFI6 and PKR. fibronectin-1 (FN-1) was down-regulated following liposomal CpG injection. only fibronectin-1 (FN-1) was down-regulated (Fig.3c) liposomal CpG injection characterized by up-regulation of genes. RNA was extracted from SIRPhigh DC, SIRPlow DC, monocytes and lymphocytes sorted from afferent lymph before injection (2 hr) and 72 hr after liposomal CpG injection. the lymphocyte population demonstrated the greatest increase in expression of genes IFIT3, RIG-I, TLR-9, PSMA2, CLEC4F, IL6, CXCL10 and IL17A genes at 72 hr. gene expression was calculated by normalizing experimental gene expression with the housekeeping gene GAPDH. ND indicates gene not detected in the cell type at that time-point. data expressed as mean SEM of four individually analysed animals. no significant changes in the percentage of lymphocyte subsets was observed following injection with both formulations. global gene expression profile of afferent lymph cells within treatment groups was calculated from RNA sequencing data. real-time PCR was performed to validate differential gene expression analysis. a subset of genes that were shown to be differentially expressed or unchanged in the RNA sequencing data set were also investigated with real-time PCR on the same samples. results are presented as log2 fold change from pre-injection at 72-hr time-point of three animals in the liposome and liposome + CpG groups. liposome + CpG induces the differential expression of a broad range of immune genes within afferent lymph cells. genes were allocated to functional groups based on literature and Metacore analysis. results are presented for three animals in the liposome + CpG group. liposomal CpG injection showed the greatest increase in expression (716-fold) only fibronectin-1 (FN-1) was down-regulated. up-regulation of genes involved in the apoptotic network. afferent lymph interleukin-27 (IL-27) and IL-1 were the only inflammatory cytokines differentially expressed 72 hr following liposomal CpG injection (Fig.3e). IL-1 was 43-fold up-regulated following liposomal CpG injection (Fig.3e). PSMA2, a gene involved in antigen processing and presentation,27 is uniquely expressed by all DC. CLEC4F was induced at 72 hr in all cell populations excluding the SIRPlow DC. a significant increase in expression was observed in monocytes at 72 hr. liposomal CpG is a more potent adjuvant in sheep than liposomal poly(I:C) but it was unclear whether this was due to the poly(I:C) adjuvant, liposomes or the depot effects of the oil. this study quantitatively shows the global transcriptional signatures in non-manipulated afferent lymph cells as they migrate from the site of injection into the lymphatics 72 hr after injection. injection with liposomal CpG induces a global transcriptional profile in afferent lymph that is reflective of the in vivo innate immune response to viral and bacterial infection. the up-regulation of multiple interferon effectors is required to induce a functional Th1 immune response capable of combating viral or bacterial infection. innate lymphoid cells (ILC) have been shown to play significant roles in tissue immunity and the innate response to pathogens. innate lymphoid cells (ILC) have been shown to play significant roles in tissue immunity and the innate response to pathogens. lymphocytes are key mediators of information transfer from the periphery to the lymph node during the innate response to vaccination. the peak activation of TLR-signalling genes in response to CpG and poly(I:C) has been shown to occur between 24 and 48 hr after injection, returning to baseline expression by 72 hr. these results begin to unveil the transcriptional pathways induced by CpG that result in the late activation and maturation of monocytes and DC in afferent lymph. this study also reveals a significant increase in PSMF1, a gene that encodes the protein for the proteasome inhibitor PI31 subunit that is involved in MHC class I cross-presentation. the most heavily down-regulated gene 72 hr after injection of liposomal CpG was IL-1. this gene is most commonly associated with activation of the inflammasome. liposomal CpG preferentially induces a mechanism that down-regulates the inflammasome while still providing pro-inflammatory signals. imm0144-0518-sd3.docx (21.3KB, docx) Table S3.
