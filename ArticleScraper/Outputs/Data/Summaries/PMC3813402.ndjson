{"summary": "we enrolled 2207 children, aged 2 years, hospitalized with bronchiolitis at 16 sites during the winters of 2007 to 2010. inpatient apnea was ascertained by daily chart review. age was corrected for birth 37 weeks. apnea is a life-threatening complication of bronchiolitis and has been associated with younger age, prematurity, and a parental report of apnea. low or high respiratory rates or low oxygen saturation on presentation were associated with subsequent apnea in the hospital. patients with comorbidities were not excluded. consent and data collection forms were translated into Spanish. the institutional review board at all participating hospitals approved the study. polymerase chain reaction assays were conducted as singleplex or duplex 2-step real-time PCR. real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was used for the detection of RNA and DNA respiratory viruses. mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis were also sought by real-time PCR. multivariable logistic regression was conducted to evaluate independent predictors of inpatient apnea. factors were tested for inclusion in the model if they were found to be associated with the outcome in unadjusted analyses (P.20) or were considered potentially clinically significant. wards and the ICU aimed to enroll 20% of our total sample from the ICU. enrollment stopped until the beginning of the next month. all patients were treated at the discretion of the treating physician. the site investigators completed the daily chart reviews by responding to the question: \u201cHas patient experienced apnea\u201d. missing data were attributed to having no daily inpatient form available (n = 31, 1.4%) or no response to the inpatient apnea question on any daily inpatient forms (n = 20, 0.9%) 24all real-time PCR assays were tested in duplicate and samples with incongruent values were retested. to reduce carryover contamination, sample preparation, RNA/DNA extraction, cDNA, and amplification were performed in separate areas. all PCR runs had extraction and reagent positive and negative controls. the median age of the 2156 children in the analysis cohort was 4 months (IQR, 2\u20139 months), 59% were boys, and 62% were white. 108 infants (5%; 95% CI, 4%\u20136%) had documented apnea. birth weight 2.3 kg (5 pounds), reported apnea, low (30 and 30\u201339) and high (>70) respiratory rates and oxygen saturation 90% during the preadmission visit. the independent risk factor with the largest OR for apnea during the hospital stay was corrected age 2 weeks. however, 17 (16%) infants with apnea had a corrected age of 6 months. 24 h 580 27 27 1\u20133 d 913 43 37 4\u20137 d 444 21 25 >7 d 143 7 9 Exposure to therapeutics within the week preceding the clinic visit Bronchodilators 816 39 23.001 Inhaled/nebulized steroids 170 8 8.87 Systemic steroids 232 11 10.90 Acetaminophen 1151 56 38.001 Antibiotics 414 20 11.03 TABLE 2.
