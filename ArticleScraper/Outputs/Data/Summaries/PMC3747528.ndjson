{"summary": "most of those acute outbreaks are caused by newly emerging viruses, such as avian influenza virus H5N1 in 1997, bat-origin SARS coronavirus hCoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003, swine-origin influenza virus (pdmH1N1) in 2009, novel SARS-like coronavirus hCoV-EMC in 2012 and 2013 and even the avian-origin influenza virus (H7N9) in 2013 anti-influenza drug is neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir were both approved in 1999 for treatment and preventive use for acute uncomplicated flu caused by influenza A and B. influenza viruses mutate so frequently, they can adapt to most novel mild selection stresses. both viruses A/pdmH1N1/2009 and A/pdmH7N9/2013 are mostly sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir. it is almost impossible to produce a timely and sufficiently effective vaccine to prevent the potential oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses outbreaks. hemagglutinin and hemagglutinin-mediated influenza virus entry are encoded by the fourth segment of negative-stranded RNA genomes in influenza A or B viruses. HA0 undergoes an extra- or intra-cellular cleavage process into HA1 and HA2. three pairs of subunits HA1 and HA2 form fusogenic homotrimer HA. after viral assembly, progeny viruses bud out by exocytosis. receptor binding pocket of HA1 recognizes terminal sialic acids in host cell. the fusion allows the release of viral ribonucleocapsid (vRNP) into cytoplasm of an infected cell. the change of host tropism from avian to human is mainly dependent on receptor binding preference of influenza virus. avian influenza viruses barely overstep the barrier to infect human. two mutations in the avian influenza virus change the receptor binding preference from the -2,3-linked SAs to the -2,6-linked SAs. those two mutations occur naturally in the 1918 pdmH1N1 and 2009 pdmH1N1 viruses capable of efficient transmission between human without losing their lethality. avian H5N1 subtype viruses do have the potential to acquire mammalian transmissibility by reassortment in current agricultural scenarios. antivirals targeting HA HA mediates viral entry process, therefore HA inhibitors could block the initial step of viral life cycle, even inducing neutralization of influenza viruses. antigenic epitopes in the globular head of HA1 typically elicit strain-specific responses. current flu vaccines mainly provoke antibodies that target the head region of HA1 therefore they expire very fast. otherwise, receptor binding sites of HA1 are more conserved. conserved linear epitope (FIEGGWTGMVDGWYGYHH) targeted by those neutralizing mAbs is part of the FP domain in HA2. CR6261 exhibits broad neutralizing activity against H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes and protects mice from lethal H1N1 or H5N1 virus. mAbs binding to fusion peptide (FP) domain were able to inhibit viral fusion and replication in vitro and in vivo. mAb CR6261 represents another more important type of HA2-based antibodies. DAS181 is a 46 kDa recombinant fusion protein, composed of a sialidase catalytic domain derived from Actinomyces viscosus fused with an epithelial surface-anchoring domain (28). elimination of host receptors or inhibition of HA0 cleavage could also block viral entry function. mucous protease inhibitors (32) can inhibit the cleavage of HA0 and thus viral infection in both cell models and animal models. injection of bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor, protease peptide, has been applied to treat the symptoms of bleeding. however, it was withdrawn from the clinical application after the study found that the drug could increase mortality in 2008. a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses, including HPAI strains (H5N1), with in vitro EC50 values range from 0.04 to 0.9 nM (28). these findings highlight the potential broad spectrum activity of DAS181 against novel and drug-resistant influenza virus strains. inhibitors of HA0 hydrolysis interrupt correct folding of HAs in progeny influenza viruses, therefore elicits nonfunctional HA conformation to block viral entry peptide drugs targeting HA are developing very fast in recent two decades. HA-based peptide vaccine is suggested a promising prophylaxis for influenza. peptides targeting HA are promising candidates as antiviral drugs. peptides c01 and c03 with N-sterol peptides (C18-peptides), derived C18-c01 and C18-c03 respectively. the alkyl groups of the two peptides were able to promote the formation of peptide assembly that ensure multivalent binding with SA-containing receptors. fusion-inhibitory peptide derived from HA2 allows the peptide enter the endosome during virus-induced endocytosis. peptides c01 and c03 are promising candidates as antiviral drugs. peptides c01 and c03 have similar inhibitory mechanism to EB. the alkyl groups of the two peptides were able to promote the formation of peptide assembly that ensure multivalent binding with SA-containing receptors. the peptides could inhibit the infection of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus with IC50 values of 3.2 and 6.5 M, respectively. small molecules targeting HA1 Based on the fact that SA is HA receptors, SA-based inhibitors can be exploited as potential anti-HA agents. monovalent SA analogs would be unable to compete with highly multivalent interactions between viruses and host cells. fusion-inhibitory small molecules block influenza virus entry. researchers found three small compounds, CL-61917, CL-385319 and CL-62554, which can inhibit the infection of H1- and H2- subtype influenza viruses with IC50 reaching micromole level (44). they found a critical residue mutation in HA2 stem region near FP region and may prevent HA2 reconformation triggered by acidification. TBHQ-resistant mutants revealed that TBHQ mainly interacts with HA2 stem region. TBHQ stabilizes the prefusion structure of HA2 at fusogenic pH. TBHQ can stop the infection of H14-subtype influenza virus rather than H5N1. researchers at Bristol Myers Squibb identified a novel influenza virus fusion inhibitor, BMY-27709, which inhibited A/WSN/33 virus replication with IC50 at 3-8 M. ly-180299 inhibits infection of A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) strain by affecting an early step of viral replication (56) a cheap and widely available anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, may inhibit infection of several viruses including influenza virus in vitro. however, a finished randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial also showed that chloroquine does not prevent infection with influenza virus (59). the flavonoids from the elderberry extract bind to H1N1 virions and block viral entry. curcumin, the widely used spice and coloring agent in Indian food, was proved to be a good virus entry inhibitor targeting HA with EC50 value approximately 0.47 M (63). small molecules targeting HA2 undergo irreversible rearrangement at acidic pH. fusion-inhibitory small molecules block influenza virus entry. arbidol is the only influenza entry inhibitor accessible in market. -385319 targets a cavity in HA2 stem region near FP domain. this means that the binding pocket is formed progressively during interactions between CL-385319 and HA. by occupying this pocket, CL-385319 stabilizes prefusion conformation of HA2 at fusogenic pH, thus inhibiting the rearrangement required for membrane fusion. researchers from Shionogi Discovery Research Laboratories found a few fusion-inhibitory small metabolites, stachyflin and its derivatives, extracted from fermented broth medium of botryoid ear mould (51). stachyflin stops the viral fusion by blocking HA2 conformational change triggered at low pH. the pH of inactivation of LY-180299 resistant mutants was increased by 0.3-0.6 pH unit, compared with the wild-type viruses. these compounds are modified from a salicylamide-based HA inhibitor cis-2-hydroxy-N-(5-hydroxy-1,3,3-trimethyl cyclohexylmethyl)-benzamide (57) researchers at peking union medical college found chloroquine is highly effective in treating avian influenza A H5N1 virus infection in an animal model if used for therapeutic purpose after infection (60). natural products targeting HA In addition to synthesized or semi-synthesized small molecules, some natural molecules also possess good inhibitory activities. anti-influenza agents from natural products, especially those from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are promising lead compounds. the clarified crystal structures of HAs provide resourceful information of the pH-induced rearrangment of HA."}
