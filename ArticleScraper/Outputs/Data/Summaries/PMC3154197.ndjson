{"summary": "DNA microarray testing has emerged as a promising new technology for broad-spectrum virus detection. a microarray could be viewed as an extended pathogen panel covering all viruses and bacteria, increasing the chance of the correct identification of one or several pathogens even in situations without any prior knowledge or suspicion about the etiology. the Phi29 polymerase has the highest processivity rate reported. the average length produced is >10 kb compared to 3 kb by the Taq polymerase. however, the Phi29 polymerase cannot amplify RNA or short DNA fragments (2000 bp) RNA viral genomes were segmented double-stranded. clinical samples were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, serum, cervical smear, faeces, skin lesion and tracheal aspirate (TA) techniques used for routine diagnostic analysis were in-house real-time PCR assays. the viral NA was extracted using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA kit (Invitrogen) the extracted viral NA was eluted with 20\u201330 l DNase/RNase-free sterile water, and stored at 20\u00b0C or immediately used. ten microliters of GenomiPhi reaction were added, containing Phi29 polymerase and random primers, and the reaction incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 12 hours. the reaction was terminated by incubation at 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. 14 l of extracted viral NA was inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. 10 l of the VILO cDNA reaction was added to 10 l of ligation mix. the reaction was terminated by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. for the multi-HPV (6, 16, 53, 61) positive sample, only HPV 6- and 16-specific PCR's were performed before and after Phi29-amplification. in-house real-time PCR's were used for HPV103, Picobirnavirus, Rota C and Dengue subtypes (1, 2, 3 and 4) labelling and microarray hybridization was performed at NimbleGen Systems-Iceland, Iceland, or in-house at SSI, Denmark. labelled DNA was isopropanol precipitated and the pellet washed, dried, reconstituted and quantitated. bacterial sequences and viruses have fewer than 20% of probes detected out of those expected. conditional and unconditional log-odds scores were plotted in a bar graph format [19]. the conditional log-odds scores show the contribution from a target that cannot be explained by another, more likely target above it. the unconditional score illustrates that some very similar targets share a number of probes. RNA viral genomes were segmented double-stranded: Rotavirus A (Rota A, 11 segments), (ii) (+)single-stranded: Astrovirus, Sapovirus, Dengue 1, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Enterovirus (EV) techniques used for routine diagnostic analysis of viruses were in-house real-time PCR assays. the viral NA was extracted using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA kit (Invitrogen) the extracted viral NA was eluted with 20\u201330 l DNase/RNase-free sterile water, and stored at 20\u00b0C or immediately used. Thirty microliters of Repli-g reaction mix, containing Phi29 and random primers, was added and the reaction incubated at 30\u00b0C for 3 minutes. the reaction was terminated by incubation at 65\u00b0C for 16 hours. the reaction was terminated by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. the DNA was stored at 80\u00b0C or immediately used for microarray analysis. in-house real-time PCR's were performed for the quantification of virus. 's were used for HPV103, Picobirnavirus, Rota C and Dengue subtypes (1, 2, 3 and 4), and previously published assays for JCV [23], GB virus type C (24) and human Adenovirus C (HAdV-C) [25]. thermal cycling was performed in a thermal cycler (Mx3005P) hybridization was performed in a NimbleGen Hybridization kit (Roche NimbleGen) microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B Scanner. additional stringency criteria were applied to exclude bacterial sequences and viruses having fewer than 20% of probes detected out of those expected. a mean of intensities for each probe-set was calculated. outlier intensities within each probe-set were filtered out when signals were more than 3 standard deviations from the mean of the probe-set. a signal threshold was defined as the 99th percentile of the random control intensities, and every probe-set mean containing more than 10 signals above this threshold was considered a positive signal. filtration left large amounts of human gDNA still present in a HSV1+ sample (Ct = 22), while DNase treatment reduced the \u00df-actin signal 1000-fold (Ct = 32) this was accompanied by a much larger fold increase after Phi29-amplification compared to without DNase treatment (e.g. 88,292 compared to 1176), resulting in lower Ct-values and more viral DNA available for downstream analysis. the WTA performed on a HCV+ serum sample resulted in a 200,000-fold increase in signal compared to only 3-fold without ligation. the highest fold increase was detected for the circular viruses JCV, BKV and HPV. the fold increase in PCR signal for gDNA (-actin) was analysed in samples representing all 7 types of clinical samples. WTA-amplified samples were purified and typical yield after 8 hours of WTA was 25 g. the described WTA amplification method amplifies both DNA and RNA viruses. cir Cervix(6) 35-12 14106 Cervix(16) 35-16 250106 Polyomaviridae BKV 5.1 kb, cir Urine 37-16 133106 Polyomaviridae JCV 5.1 kb, cir CSF 27-7 564106 dsRNA Reoviridae Rota A 17.4 kb, seg Faeces 12-4 330 (+)ssRNA Astroviridae Astrovirus 6.5 kb d Only HPV6- and HPV16-specific real-time PCR's were performed. e Sapovirus from a double-positive Astrovirus/Sapovirus faeces sample. the conditional log-odds scores show the contribution from a target that cannot be explained by another, more likely target above it. the unconditional score illustrates that some very similar targets share a number of probes. 707.9 105/120 TTV 700.3 104/113 Sapovirus+ Faeces Sapovirus 301.0 49/141 HAdV-C 675.0 173/682 TTV 858.0 199/214 TTV midi 698.7 167/177 TTV-like mini 699.4 175/235 Dengue 1+ Serum Dengue type 1 719.6 92/109 Dengue type 2 403.3 59/110 Human endogenous retrovirus 333.2 26 type C; EV, Enterovirus; RSV, Respiratory Syncytial virus; TA, tracheal aspirate; n.d., none detected. viruses from the Anelloviridae family were found in 10 out of 13 clinical samples. the Sapovirus+ faeces sample was found to be positive for Picobirnavirus (dsRNA) and negative for Rota C (dsRNA) by PCR. two separate microarray experiments detected GBV-C ((+)ssRNA) in the HCV+ sample. the dengue 1+ sample was found to be positive for both Dengue-1 and Dengue 2 in the microarray analysis. four amplifications were selected for microarray analysis (BKV3, BKV4, BKV5 and BKV6) and hybridized to the LLMDA. the human genomic sequence SSX3 (synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint 3) was used as a hybridization control and had the same signal intensity in all 4 microarrays. from as little as 5 copies input (1000 copies/ml) of BKV genomes the Phi29 108 11011 2106 - BKV2 819,400 5.71010 4100 - BKV3 419,700 11011 2100 Yes BKV4 15,810 1.71010 80 Yes BKV5 892 1.9108 5 Yes BKV6 119 11 910 0.6 No BKV7 73 0 0.4. microarray detection range for Phi29-amplified BKV+ samples. quantitative analysis of viral DNA or human gDNA before and after pre-treatment or Phi29-amplification was done by real-time PCR (Figure 1 and Table S1). only centrifugation and filtration left large amounts of human gDNA still present in a HSV1+ sample (Ct = 22), while DNase treatment reduced the \u00df-actin signal 1000-fold (Ct = 32) this was accompanied by a much larger fold increase after Phi29-amplification compared to without a clinical sample was pre-treated with centrifugation and filtration only. the \u00df-actin content was measured by real-time PCR. Negative control was water used as a PCR control. the lowest increase in signal was seen for Rota A found in faeces (Table 1) due to large quantities present already before amplification. the fold increase in PCR signal for gDNA (-actin) was analysed in samples representing all 7 types of clinical samples. b Fold increasec dsDNA Herpesviridae HSV1 152 kb, lin lesion 27-13 305,000 Herpesviridae HSV2 155 kb, lin lesion 27-15 185,000 Papillomaviridae HPV16 7.9 kb, cir Cervix 26-18 24,000 Papillomaviridae HPV6,16,53,61d 7.9 kb, cir Cer a Viruses are grouped based on nucleic acid content, according to the Baltimore Classification. b Difference in Ct-value in virus-specific real-time PCR before and after Phi29-amplification. only HPV6- and HPV16-specific real-time PCR's were performed. only Astrovirus was detected by the microarray analysis. results from the microarray data analysis of WTA-amplified clinical samples. conditional log-odds scores represent unconditional and conditional scores. 95 BKV+ Urine BKV 598.4 105/121 TTV-like mini 359.7 65/107 JCV 91.0 5/9 JCV+ CSF JCV 635.1 103/125 TTV 730.2 110/116 Rota A+ Faeces Rota A 3351.9 498/696 Picobirnavirus 67.5 49/80 Rota C 284.6 35/39 Astrovirus+Sapovirus+ Faeces Astrovirus 707.9 105/120 T TV, Torque Teno Virus; HSV2, Herpes Simplex virus 2; HPV, Human Papillomavirus; JCV, JC Polyomavirus; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; Rota A, Rotavirus A; HAdV-C, human Adenovirus C; GBV-C, GB virus type C; EV, Enterovirus; RSV, Respiratory Syncytial virus; n.d., none HPV103, Picobirnavirus, HAdV-C, GBV-C, JCV, Rota C and Dengue 2) were tested with virus-specific PCR for confirmation. the HPV103 (cir dsDNA) detected in the HPV16+ sample is not present on the microarray used for routine HPV diagnosis (Genomica) instead its presence was confirmed using a HPV103-specific PCR. 1000 copies/ml of BKV (BKV1-BKV5) were amplified with yields from 1.01011 to 1.9108 copies/ml of BKV. total input of viral copies per 50 l Phi29-reaction for these two samples were 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. amplification of samples containing 200 copies/ml resulted in loss of reproducibility and low yields. sample before Phi29a After Phi29a Input per Phi29-reactionb Detected by LLMDA BKV1 4108 11011 2106 - BKV2 819,400 5.71010 4100 - BKV3 419,700 11011 2100 Yes BKV4 15,810 1.71010 80 Yes BKV5 892 1.9108 5 Yes BKV6 119 11 910 0.6 No BKV7 73 0 the correct DNA or RNA virus was detected in 14 out of 14 samples. we can correctly detect multiple subtypes of a virus present in a sample. EV-A (Coxsackievirus A6) was clearly detected without any cross-hybridization towards any other species. HAdV-C is a dsDNA virus (Adenoviridae) found together with the (+)ssRNA virus Sapovirus (Caliciviridae) there was a false detection of virus in 3 samples, but they were all within the same family as previously tested for in the routine analysis. they could be explained by cross-reactivity between the probes targeting one species with other species in the same viral family. the microarray could be useful in e.g. diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases, or of respiratory illnesses with combined viral and bacterial components. it could also be of great value for epidemiological surveillance, where clinically unimportant viruses or viruses with unknown consequence could be found. this assay replaces hundreds of PCR reactions with just one reaction. it can combine both viral and bacterial diagnostics. both gDNA and RNA viruses can be analysed using the same protocol.
