{"summary": "sporadic pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was identified as the cause of sporadic but mild human illness in California and Texas. pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus consisting of North American and Eurasian components was identified as the cause of sporadic but mild human illness in California and Texas. as of 15 June, 6241 cases including 108 deaths have been reported as laboratoryconfirmed because of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Mexico. returning travelers have also seeded cases in 74 other countries, including 35 928 confirmed cases globally. the first time series consists of early reports of suspected influenza infection from all hospitals in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area between 15 March and 30 April. this data included dates of selfreported onset of symptoms and hospitalization for approximately 3798 suspect cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 variant. the three remaining time series correspond to the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases (C), nonpandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A cases (A) and noninfluenza cases (N). this method initially estimates the time series of infection dates and the rates of removal through recovery, death or hospitalization. the infectious period of a case may be curtailed by hospitalization or selfisolation prior to recovery or death. we therefore directly estimated the distribution of removal rates via either natural causes or intervention. unreported asymptomatic cases 12 remained infectious until recovery. we estimate a reproduction number of 151 (95% CI 132\u2013171). for confirmed cases, it is 143 (95% CI 129\u2013157) for confirmed cases, it is 143 (95% CI 129\u2013157) the apparent peak (Figure 1, curve A) between 19 April and 10 May likely does not correspond to a seasonal influenza epidemic peak. the surprisingly synchronous changes in noninfluenza A cases (curve N) suggests that some of the fluctuations may be caused by extrinsic factors rather than underlying transmission dynamics. the ratios of the number of nonpandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A cases on 18 April (from time series A in Figure 1) to the number of nonpandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A cases in each subsequent day were calculated [blue curve (B)] the procedure was repeated replacing the number of nonpandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A cases with noninfluenza A cases (time series N in Figure 1) the results of which are shown in magenta curves in (A the parameter with greatest impact on estimated reproduction number over the range assessed is the latency period. the results suggest that the estimates of R for the second segment of the adjusted time series are in agreement with the first segments of both time series S and C. if the time series representing confirmed cases is not adjusted for extrinsic factors, a wider confidence interval will be achieved. pandemic (H1N1) 2009 shows a larger proportion of mild or asymptomatic infections, communitybased propagation and a lower case fatality than SARS. we believe that comparison with SARSCoV will yield critical policy implications for public health intervention. pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is a new zoonotic pathogen and antigenically distinct from previous human or swine H1N1 viruses. there may be some preexisting immunity limiting its pandemic potential. even a new variant of human influenza virus within a given subtype can significantly exacerbate seasonal morbidity and mortality. public health evaluation and interpretation of data D.
