{"summary": "alphaviruses are a group of globally distributed arthropod-borne RNA viruses. they are most commonly maintained between mosquito vectors and avian hosts. in humans, symptoms of alphaviral infections range from fever, rash, nausea and polyarthritis to fatal encephalitis. there are 31 currently recognized alphavirus species that divide into eight phylogenetic groupings with SINV being the type species. the divergence of the terrestrial alphaviruses is marked by the new and old world viruses. the genus is endemic on six continents. rate host has been identified, suggesting there is an unrecognized number of alphavirus species inhabiting ecological niches. the recently discovered virus is apparently restricted to the invertebrate host, and in mammalian cells exhibits defects in both viral protein expression and RNA replication. alphaviral genomic RNA is translated to yield the P1234 polyprotein. after infection the alphaviral genomic RNA is translated to yield the P1234 polyprotein. P123 and nsP4 initiate the synthesis of the minus-strand replicase complex. the P23 polyprotein is exceptionally short-lived, with a presumed half-life of a few seconds. non-structural protein regulation of RNA synthesis Translation of the alphaviral genomic RNA to yield the membrane-associated viral RNA synthetic complex results in the production of the non-structural polyprotein. the majority of the translation events, as much as 90 %, produce the P123 polyprotein. the P123/nsP4 RNA synthetic complex can be short-lived. existing data indicate that an individual P123/nsP4 complex may synthesize as few as a single minus-strand RNA molecule before being further processed. Cleavage of the P123 polyprotein into nsP1 and P23 effectively marks the functional transition between the synthesis of negative-sense to positive-sense RNAs. implied nsP2 may act as a transcription factor associating with the subgenomic promoter to recruit the RNA synthetic complex. the template for positive-sense RNA synthesis is the minus-strand; however, evidence suggests that the template remains double-stranded. the nsP1/P23/nsP4 replication complex is capable of synthesizing both the genomic and subgenomic RNA species from the nascent minus-strand RNAs. however, the P23 intermediate is exceptionally short lived and can only be detected following mutation of the 2/3 cleavage site. further proteolytic cleavage to yield the individual nsP1/nsP2/nsP3/nsP4 non-structural proteins results in the study of alphavirus RNA synthesis would benefit from a model for how and when the non-structural proteins interact. a number of host factors have been implicated to be involved; however, many have yet to be identified. RNA interference (RNAi) co-knockdown of two of the proteins identified, G3BP1 and G3BP2, resulted in an increase in non-structural protein production. however, viral RNA synthesis was only minimally affected. role of hnRNP K has also been investigated and found to play a significant role in SINV RNA synthesis. RNAi knockdowns of all four proteins had an effect on alphavirus RNA replication and/or protein expression. nsP3 has been shown to bind to cellular ampiphysin-1 and -2, indicating a role for nsP3. the length of the RNA template appears to influence the spherule size during SFV replication. recent studies have shown that the RNA synthetic complexes are assembled and form spherules at the host plasma membrane. these structures are then incorporated into CPVs through endocytosis. however, the cytoskeletal association of nsP3 suggests it plays a role in the formation of CPVs. the spherule plays a role in stabilizing the complex once the polyprotein is cleaved. nsP1 was thought to require host lipids for capping activity. but these activities have since been seen in membrane-free nsP1 preparations. the P123 polyprotein and nsP4 are incapable of RNA synthesis until proteolytic processing releases the nsP4 component of the polyprotein. processing of the polyprotein results in the liberation of the nsP1 component forming the nsP1/P23/nsP4 replicase. positive-sense RNA synthetic complexes must regulate the synthesis of genome and subgenome from the same minus-strand template. nsP2 may act as a transcription factor associating with the subgenomic promoter to recruit the RNA synthetic complex. nsP2 may be involved in regulating template recognition, leading to differential association of the template RNA with specific individual binding sites on nsP4. however, the nsP1/P23/nsP4 replication complex is exceptionally short lived and can only be detected following mutation of the 2/3 cleavage site. co-immunoprecipitation experiments have found evidence for interactions between nsP1 and nsP4 and between nsP1 and nsP3, although the significance of these interactions for complex activities is not known. study would benefit from a model for how and when the non-structural proteins interact, and what functions these interactions facilitate. RNA interference (RNAi) co-knockdown of two of the proteins identified, G3BP1 and G3BP2, resulted in an increase in non-structural protein production. however, viral RNA synthesis was only minimally affected. hnRNP K was enriched in the membrane fraction of infected cells. RNA binding assays demonstrated direct binding of hnRNP A1 to genomic and subgenomic promoter probes. in vitro RNA synthesis assays showed hnRNP A1 to be required. RNAi knockdowns of all four proteins had an effect on alphavirus RNA replication. specific protein determinants of spherule formation remain unknown. similarities of viral proteins to known curvature-inducing proteins have not been observed. nsP3 has been shown to bind to cellular ampiphysin-1 and -2. cytoskeletal association of nsP3 suggests it plays a role in the formation of CPVs. despite advances, the specific role membranes play in RNA synthesis itself remains somewhat speculative. it is likely that the membrane structures act as scaffolds and effectively increase the concentration of replication factors at the sites of synthesis. an amphipathic helix and palmitoylation act to anchor the nsP1 protein to the host membrane. enzymic activities of purified SFV nsP1 were found to require lipids. however, the requirement for lipid association in regard to nsP1 enzymic activities seems to vary amongst members of the genus. alphavirus non-structural proteins show nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4. nsP1 is responsible for the addition of the 5\u2032 cap to viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs after the preparation of the. nascent RNA by the triphosphatase activity of nsP2 has been ascribed to nsP1. nsP1 mutants lacking MTase activity or GTase activity are non-viable. nsP1 is known to be important for minus-strand RNA synthesis. mutations in nsP1 have been shown to negatively affect minus-strand synthesis without negatively impacting the enzymic properties of nsP1. nsP2 was initially described as consisting of two domains, an N-terminal helicase domain, which also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity. the C-terminal protease domain shows similarity to known cathepsins. however, the MTase-like domain lacks the active-site residues responsible for enzymic activity. nsP2 functions as a helicase to unwind RNA secondary structures. the helicase activity of nsP2 is dependent on the NTPase activity of the N-terminal domain. a second activity of nsP2 that specifically pertains to viral replication is the RTPase activity associated with the N-terminal domain. phosphate from the 5\u2032 end of nascent positive-sense RNAs to yield a diphosphate moiety at the 5\u2032 terminus. the RNA appears to be dependent on the same active site as the NTPase activity. the inhibition of NTPase activity by mutation or chemical inhibition results in the loss of RTPase activity. the efficiency of cleavage in cis or in trans gives rise to different activities over the infectious cycle. early in infection the concentration of non-structural proteins is low and cis cleavage is thus favoured. later when the concentration of protease is high trans cleavage increases. cleavage efficiency of the protease is different for each of the three junctions. cleavage of the 1/2 junction in cis has been observed in both SINV and SFV. the protease activates the protease for trans cleavage of the 2/3 junction. cleavage of the 2/3 junction is more rapid than that of the other junctions. nsP2 from SFV and VEEV did not indicate significant differences in substrate specificity. for both SFV and VEEV the cleavage of the 1/2 and 3/4 junctions was found to be highly efficient. the cleavage of the 2/3 junction was poor. the context in which the cleavage site is presented influences the capacity of the particular site to be cleaved. nsP2 acts as a transcription factor for subgenome synthesis by binding to the subgenomic promoter. the temperature-sensitive mutation ts4 was found to decrease subgenomic RNA synthetic activity specifically. minus-strand template has not been shown and ts4 also alters the protease activity of nsP2. the shift to non-permissive temperature was found to dissociate ts4\u2013nsP2 from replicative complexes. additional temperature-sensitive mutations were characterized in nsP2. the alphavirus unique domain (AUD) contains a macrodomain with homologues across the domains of life. the macrodomain exhibits nucleic acid binding and phosphatase capabilities. the macrodomains of CHIKV and VEEV were found to bind to DNA, RNA and polyADP-ribose. genetic manipulations within the AUD have resulted in defects in minus-strand and subgenomic RNA synthesis, polyprotein processing, and neurovirulence. the mechanism of these defects has yet to be determined. nsP3 is characterized as being hypervariable, exhibiting poor conservation between alphaviruses in terms of length and sequence composition. work by Foy et al. (2013b) demonstrated that phosphorylation state of hypervariable domain of VEEV nsP3 did not affect virus replication in vertebrate cells, but was important for replication in mosquito cells. also it has been shown that the hypervariable domain is responsible for the formation of virus-species specific complexes in infected cells. the 70 kDa nsP4 protein is solely responsible for the RNA synthetic properties of the viral replicase complex. the nsP4 protein contains the core RdRp domain and motifs. nsP4 is targeted for degradation by the N-end rule pathway. nsP4 exhibited TATase activity and was capable of de novo RNA synthetic activity only after the addition of other viral non-structural proteins supplied from mammalian cell membrane fractions. mutations have indicated that determinants for RNA synthesis exist within nsP4. r binding in nsP4 as residues of nsP4 were found to contact the subgenomic and genomic promoters as determined by RNA cross-linking experiments. nsP1 The 60 kDa alphavirus nsP1 protein primarily serves two functions during alphavirus replication. purified SFV nsP1 has been shown to be functional in the absence of lipids. however, the requirement for lipid association in regard to nsP1 enzymic activities seems to vary amongst members of the genus. this may be due to the alternative functions of nsP1 during alphavirus infection. nsP1: MTase, methyltransferase; GTase, guanylyltransferase. nsP1: MTase, methyltransferase, guanylyltransferase. nsP1: MTase, methyltransferase, guanylyltransferase, guanylyltransferase. sates from cells with individually expressed nsP1 found the GTase reaction catalysed by nsP1 to be distinct from the typical eukaryotic GTase reaction. nsP1 was found to require S-adenosylmethionine to link to GTP and acid hydrolysis of nsP1-GMP yielded 7MeGMP and not GMP. nsP1 mutants lacking MTas nsP1 is known to be important for minus-strand RNA synthesis. mutations have been shown to negatively affect minus-strand synthesis. nsP2 The 90 kDa alphavirus nsP2 protein serves multiple important functions during virus infection. a third domain resembling a MTase fold shows structural similarity to the FtsJ MTase. the nsP2 MT-like domain lacks the active-site residues responsible for enzymic activity. the second putative domain appears to function in promoter selection. the helicase activity of nsP2 is dependent on the NTPase activity of the N-terminal domain. mutations in the Walker A motif ablated helicase activity in both recombinant and tissue culture models. recent data indicates that the helicase activity of nsP2 likely acts in coordination with the polymerase activity of nsP4. the protease responsible for the processing of the non-structural polyproteins has been shown to be functionally discrete from the nsP2 functions described above. however, the activities of the protease are modulated by other domains of nsP2 and nsP2 containing polyproteins. in SINV, each junction has been found to be cleavable in trans. cis/trans and preference shifts of the protease result in specific cleavage timing. when P123 and P1234 are translated at the start of infection cleavage in cis of the 3/4 junction produces the initial non-structural protein species, P123 and nsP4. the 2/3 junction is distant to the protease active site of nsP2. newly translated non-structural proteins are cleaved into P12 and P34. at this later stage of infection the concentration of protease competent for cleavage of the 3/4 junction (P23, P123, P1234) is rapidly processed away. the macrodomain of nsP3 and the N terminus of nsP2 are necessary for substrate positioning in order for cleavage of the 2/3 junction to occur. these amino acid positions of the polyprotein cleavage sites are described below using the Schechter and Berger nomenclature. the cleavage site requirements were tested biochemically using SFV nsP2pro, and P1, P2 and P3 were found to be important. tests using synthetic substrates and purified protease domains from SINV, SFV and VEEV found that nsP2pro recognized and cleaved SFV's 1/2 junction, but no other cross-species recognition was identified. nsP2 functions as a helicase to unwind RNA secondary structures formed during viral RNA replication. the helicase activity of nsP2 is dependent on the NTPase activity of the N-terminal domain. a severable helicase domain is not present. the activity of nsP2 is responsible for the removal of the -phosphate from the 5\u2032 end of nascent positive-sense RNAs to yield a diphosphate moiety at the 5\u2032 terminus. the RNA appears to be dependent on the same active site as the NTPase activity, as the inhibition of NTPase activity by mutation or chemical inhibition results in the loss of RTPase activity. cis cleavage of 1/2 appeared to be inefficient, at least in SINV. early in infection the concentration of non-structural proteins is low. cis cleavage in cis or in trans gives rise to different activities over the infectious cycle. iljeva et al. argue that slow 1/2 cleavage in cis produces delay in processing. cleavage of the 1/2 junction in cis, with 30 min half-life, produces delay in processing. cleavage of the 1/2 junction in both SINV and SFV is temporally regulated. cleavage of artificial substrates by purified protease domains of nsP2 from SFV and VEEV did not indicate significant differences in substrate specificity. for both SFV and VEEV the cleavage of the 1/2 and 3/4 junctions was found to be highly efficient. italics have been used for designation of residues around protease cleavage sites. the context in which the cleavage site is presented influences the capacity of the particular site to be cleaved. nsP2 acts as a transcription factor for subgenome synthesis. direct binding of nsP2 to subgenomic promoter on minus-strand template has not been shown. ts4 also alters protease activity of nsP2. mutations in nsP2 have been shown to exhibit defects in initiation of minus-strand synthesis. the alphavirus nsP3 protein has three recognized domains: the macrodomain, the alphavirus unique domain (AUD) and the hypervariable region. the alphavirus macrodomain exhibits both nucleic acid binding and phosphatase capabilities. this finding is in contrast to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus macrodomain which exhibited low phosphatase activity. genetic manipulations within the AUD have resulted in defects in minus-strand and subgenomic RNA synthesis, polyprotein processing, and neurovirulence. nsP3 is characterized as being hypervariable, exhibiting poor conservation between alphaviruses in terms of length and sequence composition. mutations of the phosphorylation sites exhibited mild effects on viral growth kinetics and RNA synthesis in culture. work by Foy et al. demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of the hypervariable domain of VEEV nsP3 did not affect virus replication in vertebrate cells, but was important for replication in mosquito cells. nsP4 protein is solely responsible for the RNA synthetic properties of the viral replicase complex. the nsP4 protein contains the core RdRp domain and motifs. nsP4 is targeted for degradation by the N-end rule pathway. full-length nsP4 exhibited TATase activity and was capable of de novo RNA synthetic activity only after the addition of other viral non-structural proteins supplied from mammalian cell membrane fractions. mutations have indicated that determinants for RNA synthesis exist within nsP4. residues of nsP4 were found to contact the subgenomic and genomic promoters as determined by RNA cross-linking experiments. mutations of regions identified as binding specifically to either the genomic or subgenomic promoters were found to abrogate the corresponding RNA synthetic activity. the 5\u2032 end of the genome, or its complement in the 3\u2032 end of the minus-strand, contains two conserved sequence elements. there is one in the 60 nt 5\u2032 UTR and the 51 nt CSE within nsP1 coding region. the complementary sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the minus-strand is also predicted to be structured. cularization of template RNAs for initiation of copying has been identified as a strategy by which other positive-sense RNA viruses regulate their RNA synthesis and translation. studies using chimeric SINV/SFV RNA templates found that the 51 nt CSE is likely an enhancer element for RNA synthesis, while the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 elements from the same virus species are necessary for RNA replication. chimeras of 5\u2032 UTR and 51 nt CSE from SINV and SFV found adaptive mutations that relieved inhibition RNA synthesis through AU additions at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. however, some of the adaptive AU additions functioned in vertebrate but not mosquito cells, suggesting host-specific factor involvement. these studies begin to illuminate the complexities of interactions between viral/host factors and the 5\u2032 cis-acting elements during RNA synthesis. the 3\u2032 13 nt of the CSE and a poly(A) tail of at least 11 residues were found to be most critical for minus-strand synthesis. these analyses were extended to determine the initiation site of minus-strand synthesis. this suggests that polyadenylation of alphavirus plus-strand RNAs is not templated in contrast to previous reports. the promoter for subgenomic synthesis, active solely in the minus-strand, lies partially in this region and partially in the nsP4-coding region. the 5\u2032 UTR of the subgenomic RNA is also derived from this sequence. secondary structures present in the 5\u2032 UTR have been shown to prevent the recognition of the viral RNAs. a polymorphism at position 5 of the SINV genome and position 3 of the VEEV genome correlate with increased pathogenicity of these viruses. a similar arrangement of secondary structures can be observed proximal to the frameshift site of the 6K/TF structural protein (Chung et al., 2010; Firth et al., 2008, 2011). a stem\u2013loop structure 3\u2032 adjacent to the U6A motif enhances the ribosomal frameshifting, resulting in the production of TF. SFV lacks an identifiable local secondary structure proximal to the U6A motif. a 600 nt fragment derived from within the coding region of nsP1 interacted specifically with the SINV capsid protein. this region, which spanned nt 945\u20131076 of the genome, was shown to bind capsid protein and a 68-residue capsid-derived peptide. EEEV, WEEV and VEEV contain packaging signals within nsP1 (VEEV nt 856\u20131150) that consist of four to six predicted stem\u2013loop structures marked by a GGG conserved sequence motif at the base of each loop. disruption of the stem\u2013loops or mutation of the conserved GGG sequence reduces packaging efficiency relative to WT virus. alphaviral 3\u2032 UTR have been identified using SINV that regulate the stability of viral RNAs during infection. the relative stability of SINV RNAs appears to be dependent on the stage of infection. the half-lives of incoming viral genomes vary greatly from those synthesized during active infection. stability of this structure and ability of polymerase to access promoter is thought to be important for regulation and initiation of RNA synthesis. the 51 nt CSE in the nsP1-coding region forms two stem\u2013loops. RNA synthesis, templated by the genomic RNA, initiates at its 3\u2032 end, 5\u2032 elements must be involved. chimeras of 5\u2032 UTR and 51 nt CSE from SINV and SFV found adaptive mutations that relieved inhibition RNA synthesis through AU additions at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. this suggests circularization mediated in part by the 5\u2032 UTR element is necessary for minus-strand synthesis. this suggests circularization mediated by the 5\u2032 UTR element is necessary for minus-strand synthesis. the 3\u2032 end of the genome contains the largest UTR, in the range of several hundred nucleotides. the final 19\u201320 nt before the poly(A) tail comprise the 3\u2032 CSE. these elements are presumed to contain the core minus-strand promoter. genomes lacking significant portions of this element are capable of producing progeny by a novel repair mechanism. genomes with deletions to the 3\u2032 CSE, UTR and/or poly(A) tail were introduced into cells and viable progeny were recovered from many of these. truncation of the promoter beyond nucleotides 19 to +5 from the transcription start site abolished activity. additional enhancer elements and contextual effect were identified by studies using dual-promoter viruses. a polymorphism at position 5 of the SINV genome and position 3 of the VEEV genome correlates with increased pathogenicity of these viruses. the presence of a stem\u2013loop RNA secondary structure immediately adjacent to the opal stop codon has been reported to influence readthrough, thereby generating the P1234 polyprotein. characterization of the translational enhancer revealed the presence of a secondary structure downstream of the initiating methionine of the SINV subgenomic RNA. it imparts resistance to the shutoff of host translation mediated by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2. this feature is apparently absent from other members of the genus, notably VEEV and CHIKV. a 600 nt fragment derived from within the coding region of nsP1 (nt 721\u20131306) interacted specifically with the SINV capsid protein. this region, which spanned nt 945\u20131076 of the SINV genome, was shown to bind capsid protein and a 68-residue capsid-derived peptide. the alphaviral 3\u2032 UTR exhibits a remarkable level of sequence diversity. a notable feature of the alphaviral 3\u2032 UTRs are the repeat sequence elements (RSEs), which differ in their primary sequence and organization across the members of the genus. the precise functions of the RSEs are largely unclear. a major question regarding alphavirus RNA synthetic complexes relates to the precise structural arrangements that underlie the functions observed. nsP3 has cell-type-dependent functions that may be important for virus replication in different tissues and hence for pathogenesis. the role of host factors in RNA synthesis and regulation of viral RNA function remains to be elucidated. the involvement of host factors in RNA synthesis and regulation of viral RNA function is also an area that is only just beginning to be explored. level of the vector."}
