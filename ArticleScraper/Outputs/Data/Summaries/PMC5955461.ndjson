{"summary": "rotavirus is the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea. it mainly attacks children younger than 5 y old, resulting in 114 million diarrheal episodes and 453,000 infant deaths annually. the development of effective antiviral therapies is indispensable to combat this pathogen. mTOR belongs to a member of the serine/threonine phosphatidyl inositol 3\u2032 kinase-related kinase family (PIKK) mTOR controls capped-dependent translation of both cells and viruses via inducing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 to promote the formation of a functional eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F) complex. PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway as a potential antiviral target is involved in the infection of a broad spectrum of viruses including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV),19 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),20 HIV 21 and human cytomegalovirus. we also used 3 dimension (3D) cultures of primary human intestinal organoids for modeling rotavirus infection. ly294002 for 48 h resulted in 93.5 1.7% (n = 4; P 0.05) reduction of viral RNA. ly294002 could also significantly suppress rotavirus RNA secretion. treatment with 0.1, 1 and 5 M LY294002 could vigorously inhibit rotavirus protein synthesis. ly294002 (48 h) potently inhibited viral genomic RNA in SA11 rotavirus infected Caco2 cells measured by qRT-PCR. each bar represents the TCID50/mL (mean SEM) each bar represents the TCID50/mL (mean SEM) each bar represents the TCID50/mL (mean SEM) one (No 8198) out of 3 clones showed potent knockdown based on western blot results. caco2 cells with mTOR knockdown or scrambled shRNA were inoculated with SA11 rotavirus. viral genomic RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR 48 h post inoculation. western blot assay indicated that rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis was potently inhibited by rapamycin treatment. rapamycin lost its anti-rotavirus activity in mTOR silenced Caco2 cells. mTOR knockdown inhibited rotavirus genomic RNA determined by qRT-PCR. treatment with rapamycin (48 h) inhibited SA11 rotavirus genomic RNA in human intestinal organoids determined by qRT-PCR. treatment with rapamycin (48 h) inhibited patient-derived rotavirus (isolate 1\u20135) genomic RNA in human intestinal organoids determined by qRT-PCR. treatment with 10 nM rapamycin resulted in a significant reduction of viral RNA replication. this was further validated in 5 patient-derived strains by inoculation of Caco2 cells or human intestinal organoids with stool samples from rotavirus-infected patients. this results have demonstrated that efficient infection of rotavirus requires mTOR. rotavirus infection did not directly affect expression levels of key components the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR inhibits rotavirus infection. treatment with BEZ235 significantly inhibited SA11 rotavirus VP4 protein in human intestinal organoids. 4E-BP1, but not S6K, is a downstream effector of mTOR in sustaining rotavirus infection 4E-BP1. we first studied its potential involvement by lentiviral RNAi mediated loss-of-function assay. caco2 cells with the best knockdown of 4E-BP1 resulted in 62.4 6.1% reduction of SA11 rotavirus viral RNA 48 h post-inoculation. al effect was abolished in 4E-BP1 KO MEFs transfected with 4E-BP1 plasmids having 5 mutations of the phosphorylation sites (4E-BP1\u20135A) of note, the inhibitor of S6K did not affect rotavirus infection. 4E-BP1 but not S6K is a downstream effector of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in sustaining rotavirus infection. 4E-BP1 mediates rapamycin-induced autophagy that inhibits rotavirus infection. 4E-BP1 mediates rapamycin-induced autophagy that inhibits rotavirus replication. the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I (hallmark of autophagy induction) was upregulated by rapamycin treatment. starvation inhibited rotavirus mRNA and viral protein synthesis. LC3-I and LC3-II protein levels were examined by western blot analysis. protein samples were extracted from Caco2 cells treated with indicated concentrations of rapamycin (48 h) Western blot detected that upregulated ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I by starvation was abolished in 4E-BP1 knockout (/) MEFs. LC3 gene associated with the autophagosome membrane was silenced with 10 integrating lentiviral RNAi vectors. beclin1 knockdown increased rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis detected by western blot assay. beclin1 knockdown increased rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis detected by western blot assay. treatment with 1 and 5 M LY294002 for 48 h resulted in 93.5 1.7% (n = 4; P 0.05) and 81.0 6.8% (n = 4; P 0.05) reduction of viral RNA. ly294002 could also significantly suppress rotavirus RNA secretion. t-mTOR, p-Akt (S473), p-S6 (S240/244) and p-4E-BP1 (T70) protein levels and total protein levels under the treatment of indicated concentrations of LY294002 (48 h) in Caco2 cells. each bar represents the TCID50/mL (mean SEM) each bar represents the TCID50/mL (mean SEM) one (No 8198) out of 3 clones showed potent knockdown based on western blot results. caco2 cells with mTOR knockdown or scrambled shRNA were inoculated with SA11 rotavirus and viral genomic RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR 48 h post inoculation. western blot assay indicated that rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis was potently inhibited by rapamycin treatment. rapamycin lost its anti-rotavirus activity in mTOR silenced Caco2 cells. mTOR knockdown inhibited rotavirus genomic RNA determined by qRT-PCR. treatment with rapamycin (48 h) significantly inhibited SA11 rotavirus replication in Caco2 cells. each bar represents TCID50/mL (mean SEM) each bar represents the TCID50/mL (mean SEM) rapamycin, human intestinal organoids infected with SA11 rotavirus treated with 10 or 100 nM rapamycin for 48 h. this led to vigorous inhibition of phosphor-Ser-240/244 S6. this resulted in a significant reduction (75.9 5%, n = 5; P 0.01) of viral RNA replication. Western blot assay detected p-mTOR (S2448), p-p70S6K (T389), p-Akt (S473) and p-S6 (S240/244) and the corresponding total proteins after 48 h incubation with indicated concentrations of BEZ235 in Caco2 cells. treatment with BEZ235 (48 h) significantly inhibited SA11 rotavirus genomic RNA in human intestinal organoids quantified by qRT-PCR. 4E-BP1 but not S6K, is a downstream effector of mTOR in sustaining rotavirus infection 4E-BP1 is one of the important downstream elements of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. 4E-BP1 KO MEFs transfected with 4E-BP1 wild-type (4E-BP1-WT) plasmids. this antiviral effect was abolished in 4E-BP1 KO MEFs. the inhibitor of S6K did not affect rotavirus infection (Figure S4). 4E-BP1 mediates rapamycin-induced autophagy that inhibits rotavirus infection. rapamycin treatment did not affect the protein expression of IRF1 or IRF7 in Caco2 cells and MEFs. mTOR is the main inhibitor of autophagy. starvation (EBSS medium containing 1mM pepstatin A and E-64-d solution) stimulated the autophagy process in Caco2 cells. LC3-I and LC3-II protein levels were examined by western blot analysis. protein samples were extracted from Caco2 cells treated with indicated concentrations of rapamycin (48 h) LC3-II to LC3-I by rapamycin was abolished in 4E-BP1 knockout (/) MEFs (n = 6, mean SEM, *P 0.05, **P 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). to demonstrate the role of autophagy in rotavirus infection, we applied RNAi knockdown of key components of the autophagy machinery. beclin1 knockdown increased rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis detected by western blot assay. beclin1 knockdown increased rotavirus genomic RNA determined by qRT-PCR. NS1 activates the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85:P110) holoenzyme. white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) stimulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, the downstream element of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. blocking PI3K by its inhibitor could vigorously inhibit infection of numerous viruses. inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity. PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway functions by phosphorylation of its downstream effectors including ribosomal protein S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) and 4E-BP1 to upregulate cap-dependent mRNA translation. key autophagy related genes have been well studied in regulating virus infections with different model-of-actions. several autophagy related genes can promote both innate and adaptive immune response to combat viral infection. pharmaceutical blocking PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibits phosphorylation and activation of its downstream targets including p70S6K and 4E-BP1. autophagy itself exerts anti-rotavirus effect. immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from 4E-BP1 wild-type (+/+) and 4E-BP1 knockout mice were cultured in DMEM (invitrogen-Gibco, Breda, The Netherlands) intestinal tissues were vigorously shaken in 8 mM EDTA for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, followed by removing the EDTA solution. biopsies were re-used for repeated collection of organoids were cultured in culture medium at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. culture medium was refreshed every 2\u20133 days, and organoids were passaged every 6\u20137 d.
