{"summary": "the literature on climate effects is expanding in response to concerns about global climate change. the significance of the methods and data available is not only confined to the technical aspects; methods and data also impact on the formulation of the specific scientific questions, their selection, and the development of hypotheses. a disease-free situation is the combination of negligible pathogen population in, and/or negligible exposure of susceptible individuals to, the pathogen reservoir. infections arise from increased interactions of exposed susceptibles with the pathogen reservoir. this can be caused by a growth in the pathogen population (driven, for example, by temperature) and/or larger exposure to the pathogen. the different routes of transmission are: A) Drinking water borne; B) Water washed (reduced water access); C) Water based; D) Foodborne through water; E) Water infecting wounds Bathing water Respirat. medical water or solutions Acanthamoeba polyphaga Protozoan Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis.

Describe the limitations of the methods identified by the authors Papers were clustered according to the methodology used. Describe the limitations of the methods identified by the authors. the full list of search terms is in the Supporting Information, S2 Text. papers were reviewed by two people (GL and GN) as the pool of returned papers was quite large, we decided to not use additional specific search terms for pathogens. this would require a subjective list of potential pathogens. based models (e.g. mechanistic compartmental models or agent based models), statistical analysis of empirical data (e.g. time series analysis) etc. 3) Is the method applied to investigate the effect of climate change or weather or both. assess if there is a preferential use of the methods towards particular disease/pathogen and identify possible explanations. a significant proportion (approximately 20% of papers) focused on unspecified water-associate pathogens. the next significant categories were papers that looked at diarrheal illness as a broad category based on health service data that did not include pathogen-specific information. studies on cholera were associated with low and middle income countries. Cryptosporidium spp. and Campylobacter spp. were more likely reported in high income countries that have good laboratory-based passive surveillance systems. Fig 5 is perhaps the most objective way of representing the methods used in the reviewed papers as it is based simply on the technical keywords recorded by their authors. the entries in Fig 6 and in S1 Table in the supporting information do not reflect an established \u201ctaxonomy\u201d of the methods. PBM Key aspects of the cluster potentially relevant to study the impact of weather/climat change Compartmental models, Spatial Compartmental Models (SIR, SIB, SIBR, etc.) based on a partition of the entire population into key epidemiological categories, for example Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered individuals [14] exposure-response relationships relate magnitude of a stressor to the response of the receptor (e.g. probability of getting infected) the effect of weather/climate on the exposure-response curve can be direct (e.g. an increase in water load due to rainfall results in a diluted concentration affecting the response) human mobility is often neglected in epidemiological models, however, a small proportion of PBM-papers incorporate human mobility. all the reviewed papers focus only on short-term human mobility Human mobility will be likely affected by changes in the environmental and socio-economic factors arising from climate change. hydrodynamics models can take into account variations, due to e.g. rainfall, in the spatio-temporal exposure to the pathogen caused by variations in the contact with contaminated water. Agent Based Models mimic the bio-physical processes with a computationally-aided set of autonomous, interacting agents. a key advantage is their ability to resolve heterogeneity in a population (which is not necessarily grouped into compartments) these are particularly useful when the mathematical approach is less tractable. most studies control bias from temporal trends and seasonal patterns not necessarily due to weather. some allow for residual autocorrelation either using (S)ARIMA or ad hoc approaches. but it is unclear how much they could be relied on to predict impact of climate change. a few studies employed Hybrid time series-PBM studies. these are applications of \u201ctime series susceptible-infectious-recovered (immune)\u201d PBMs. these approaches have promise to inform dependence of disease on climate and climate change. infected people can excrete pathogens, and feedback into the environment compartment. for some infections there is no excretion and thus no feedback into the environment compartment (e.g. Legionella) ten percent of PBM-papers included person-to-person transmission via contacts between susceptible and infected persons. many studies in the regression tradition used ad hoc approaches for this. Spatial methods for linking datasets use geographical information systems (GIS) to link disease data with information on socio-economic indicators, temperature and rainfall (or proxy indicators), and vegetation and land use data within the same geographical framework. more than 70% of studies included observed or modelled temperature and/or rainfall/precipitation data in their analysis. a smaller proportion of studies included other environmental factors (e.g. relative humidity, vapor air pressure, evaporation) and socio-economic indicators in the analysis. around 40% of the methods explicitly included the effects of seasonality. the lack of inclusion of relevant factors in the methods was the most common limitation acknowledged by the authors. the authors identified reporting bias as a key limitation. in almost 20% of papers, the authors identified reporting bias as a key limitation. cholera can be acquired from contamination of household water storage containers, food preparation, direct person-to-person contacts, and/or via contact with environmental reservoir. cholera can be acquired from contamination of household water storage containers, food preparation, direct person-to-person contacts, and/or via contact with environmental reservoir. a range of methods have been proposed, including nonlinear time series approaches linked with wavelet analysis. a common problem with these methods is that they are sensitive to the particular situation under investigation, such as country, age and social group. a common problem with these methods is that they are sensitive to the particular situation under investigation, such as country, age and social group. collinearity may generate numerical problems, i.e. instability of parameter estimates and inflated variance of the estimated regression coefficient. collinearity often makes it impossible to attribute the effects on the response variable to the individual predictor variables [38] methods for detecting and removing collinearities include clustering. cluster-independent methods (e.g. selection of uncorrelated Variables, Sequential Regression), latent variable regressions (e.g. selection of uncorrelated variables), latent variable regressions (e.g. Partial Least Squares, Dimension Reduction Techniques). sources of temporal lag include time required for potential growth of pathogen population in the environment, exposure dynamics, incubation period, and delays in reporting. further complications can arise from feedback from the infected population to the pathogen reservoir. the required time tres depends on a range of environmental and microbiological factors specific to the pathogen under investigation. tinc (the time between infections and symptoms onsets) is associated with patient\u2019s physiology, whose distribution depends on the type of infection. for only a proportion of these cases further diagnostic testing will be conducted. this introduces a further time lag, tdet, between the time when infected individual approaches the health system. agent based models (ABM) are used to simulate controlled processes in epidemics. they can identify multiple sources (physiology, environment, behaviour) of time lags and their statistical distributions. seasonality is expected to be an important driver of pathogen evolution. water-associated disease outbreaks could be point-source, affecting a relatively small population. quantitative methodological studies applied to longer term climatic effects are limited. extreme events, such as prolonged droughts, are expected to have a major impact on infectious diseases dynamics. many of these are classified as NTD [2\u20134] e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Leptospira spp., Schistosoma spp. and Salmonella spp. Fig 4 shows the countries where the studies were based. a good proportion of these theoretical process-based models did not link their study with any data for diseases occurring in a particular country. the most commonly used methods can be grouped into two main clusters. each dot corresponds to a reviewed paper; the brown bubbles correspond to the keywords describing the techniques. the size of the bubble increases (logarithmically) with the number of papers citing the keyword. a close inspection of Fig 5 suggests that a substantial number of papers in the PBM clusters employed \u201cDose-Response Model\u201d. the most common, general methods used in the reviewed papers (listed in S1 Table in the supporting information) the same principle guided the structure of Table 3, which presents some key features of the clusters of methods. the acronyms (SIR, SEIR, SIB etc.) reflect the specific epidemiological compartments considered. these models typically uses differential equations to estimate the number of individuals in each compartment at any time. other techniques such as difference equations could be employed. stability analysis studies if all sufficiently small disturbances away from the equilibrium solution (e.g. a fixed or periodic population), damp out in time [86]. this property depends on the parameter of the system and a variation of a parameter of the system can lead to a transition from disease free equilibrium to an endemic situation. hydrodynamics models can take into account variations, due to e.g. rainfall, in the spatio-temporal exposure to the pathogen caused by variations in the contact with contaminated water or in the concentration of the pathogen dispersed in the water. many PBM address these processes by allowing infection transmission. these studies seek to directly explore the dependence of disease patterns over time on preceding and concurrent weather. some studies control bias from temporal trends and seasonal patterns not necessarily due to weather. some allow for residual autocorrelation either using (S)ARIMA or ad hoc approaches. spatial methods cover three main areas: descriptive or visual presentation of data (choropleth maps, GIS), tests for global or local clustering (Moran\u2019s I, spatial scan statistics) and analysing point data to estimate the intensity of spatial processes [92\u201394] methods are becoming increasingly popular as they allow estimations of parameters and associated uncertainties for large classes of complex models. most PBM are based on compartmental models, i.e. a subdivision of the entire population into relevant epidemiological categories, such as susceptible, infected, and recovered people. time series regression (TSR) analysis is one of the most common methods used by the papers reviewed to analyse temperature and rainfall exposures as they can vary over time. many studies used generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) often included terms allowing for over-dispersion. only 9% of the reviewed papers applied the methodology to study the effects of climate, i.e. long-term averages of weather such as El Nio cycles (these applications are not mutually exclusive); and 7% used modelled future climate projections. around 40% of the methods explicitly included the effects of seasonality (intra-annual climate variability) only a small proportion of the methods explicitly modelled the pathogen dynamics in the wider environment or the specific water reservoir. the poor quality of the data was another important source of limitation according to the authors. the authors identified the absence of underlying mechanistic explanation as a problem in about 10% of the studies. in 10% of papers, the authors highlighted that the methods were calibrated only for a specific situation. Fig 4 shows the countries where the studies were based. a good proportion of these theoretical process-based models did not link their study with any data for diseases occurring in a particular country. the country with the most studies (about 10% of papers) was Bangladesh. the size of the bubble increases (logarithmically) with the number of papers citing the keyword. for visual purposes only, i) the technical keywords describing methods used by only one paper are not displayed. the graph was produced by using the i-graph package[13] in R. Process-Based Models (PBM), which are typically described by mechanistic compartmental models [14], time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE) the same principle guided the structure of Table 3, which presents some key features of the clusters of methods. however, we did not discuss methods such as \u201cDescriptive Statistics\u201d and \u201cSurvey/Surveillance/Sampling\u201d since these were too generic in terms of their use for investigating the effect of weather and/or climate change on water-associated diseases. models are fully specified by a set of parameters (e.g. transmission, recover, mortality rate etc.) that regulate the transition from one compartment to another. many of these parameters depend on environmental variables such as temperature. a change in the environmental parameters (e.g. mean temperature, rainfall) might lead to a transition from disease free equilibrium to an endemic situation or to a variation in the periodicity. the reproductive number, i.e. the number of secondary cases arising from a primary case under certain conditions, depends on the set of parameters. Model with person-to-person Transmission and also person-to-environment transmission Person-to-person is an additional mode of transmission of many water-associated diseases, e.g. cholera. effects of climate and weather can have an indirect impact on these additional modes of transmission, for example by changing the population size (e.g. due to increased urbanization) and rates of contact among people. these studies seek to directly explore the dependence of disease patterns over time on preceding and concurrent weather. most studies control bias from temporal trends and seasonal patterns not necessarily due to weather, and other measured time-varying risk factors. some allow for residual autocorrelation either using (S)ARIMA or ad hoc approaches. descriptive or visual presentation of data (choropleth maps, GIS), tests for global or local clustering (Moran\u2019s I, spatial scan statistics) and analysing point data to estimate the intensity of spatial processes [92\u201394]. GIS allows disease data to be linked to datasets on the basis of geographical location and time. most PBM are based on compartmental models, i.e. a subdivision of the entire population into relevant epidemiological categories, such as susceptible, infected, and recovered people [14]. the population dynamics of each category is usually governed by a system of non-linear differential equations. this class of models has been extended to stochastic, spatial and age-specific models. many studies used generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) often included terms allowing for over-dispersion. residual variation in the response variable was modelled as a Poisson distribution, followed by negative binomial. most common exposure factors were temperature and rainfall. more than 70% of studies included observed or modelled temperature and/or rainfall/precipitation data in their analysis. around 40% of the methods explicitly included the effects of seasonality (intra-annual climate variability) a small proportion of papers included the effects of El Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO). the methods explicitly modelled the pathogen dynamics in the wider environment or the specific water reservoir. the method could be potentially applied to investigate their effects. the authors identified reporting bias as a key limitation. the authors identified the absence of underlying mechanistic explanation as a problem in about 10% of the studies. the methods were calibrated only for a specific situation (e.g. a limited region) the findings were not generalizable. the key challenge ahead is increasing awareness of the drivers of disease and a deeper integration with fields such as microbiology. identifying dose-response curves to use as input for modelling, potential coexistence of human-to-human transmission, and social science. a key task is often to identify the main risk factors/disease determinants. collinearity can generate numerical problems, i.e. instability of parameter estimates. a common source of collinearity is the highly correlated climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall. Dormann et al. [38] conducted a systematic review of methods to deal with collinearity and a simulation study evaluating their performance. this scenario requires an understanding of the relationships between the different predictor variables, e.g. the dependence of humidity on temperature and rainfall, e.g. [41], or between the response variable and one or more predictor variables, e.g. the dependence of Salmonella growth on temperature. the method, applied to the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak [47], integrates population dynamic models with Profile Likelihood approach. the problem of collinearity is removed by fixing the value of one or more parameters, and then estimating the remaining ones by maximizing the (log-) likelihood of the associated model. literature on microbial risk assessment framework (hazard identification, dose-response relationships, exposure assessment, quantitative risk characterization) the effect of exposure events is distributed over a time interval. a general statistical framework can simultaneously represent non-linear exposure\u2013response dependencies (due to, for example, depletion of susceptibles) and delayed effects. analysis of the time lag between environmental/climatic variables and infections was a common task encountered in this Review. none of the methods used distinguished the different sources of time lag. in most cases the assessment was based on trial and error methods. the importance of and challenges in understanding the effects of seasonal drivers and climate variability on the dynamics of infectious diseases are not repeated here. further challenges arise from potential changes in seasonal patterns of the drivers, for example due to control measures, and aperiodic time-varying factors. spatial studies included temporal dynamics, for example to study the spread of cholera in a particular region due to rainfall. cholera can be acquired from contamination of household water storage containers, food preparation, direct person-to-person contacts, and/or via contact with environmental reservoir. identifying a potential signature for the particular pathways in the patterns of diseases is perhaps the ideal goal. the key challenge ahead is increasing awareness of the drivers of disease. social science (e.g. to identify and include in the methods social contacts, patterns of mobility, adaptation, etc.) and ecology (e.g. to understand and incorporate the dynamics of free living organisms in water) collinearity may generate numerical problems, i.e. instability of parameter estimates and inflated variance of the estimated regression coefficient. collinearity often makes it impossible to attribute the effects on the response variable to the individual predictor variables [38] a systematic review of methods to deal with collinearity and a simulation study evaluating their performance. the methodologies assessed include clustering (e.g. principal component analysis-based clustering), cluster-independent methods (e.g. selection of uncorrelated Variables, Sequential Regression), latent variable regressions (e.g. Principal Component Regression, Partial Least Squares, Dimension Reduction Techniques) and a range of approaches that may be less sensitive to collinearity. the method, which is suitable for a limited subset of the parameters, provides a better understanding of the relationship between different parameters. sources of the temporal lag include time required for potential growth of pathogen population in the environment, exposure dynamics, incubation period, and delays in reporting. infections are typically revealed after the incubation period, tinc, (the time between infections and symptoms onsets), which is associated with patient\u2019s physiology. after symptoms start, only a proportion of the infected individuals seeks medical assistance. for only a proportion of these cases further diagnostic testing will be conducted and recorded in the public health system. involving the wider community via community-based studies and citizen science could help in identifying the different sources of the temporal lag from the start of the pathway to infection to disease detection. this information could be used as inputs for agent based models (ABM) to simulate controlled processes in epidemics. i.e. studying conditions for pathogen invasion and establishment in systems characterized by fluctuating environmental forcing. mechanistic approaches reviewed here were in most cases deterministic compartmental models, which are strictly only valid for large epidemics. extreme events, such as prolonged droughts (months or years) and heavy rain events (days or weeks) are expected to have a major impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases. the two clusters resemble the groups of explanatory and predictive models. many modelling studies provide maps of the risk of a disease, i.e. they make predictions, by calculating the Basic Reproductive Number. this research has the common limitations of any systematic review. an important one is the possibility we have missed relevant studies due to the failure of the search engine or studies written in languages other than English. this technique is less feasible when the initial pool of documents is as large as in current case. incorporating information on human behaviour and socio-economic factors can help reduce reporting bias. the integration of infection data with long-term, national-scale, environmental and land use data is an important growing approach. emergence, risk, spread, and control of infectious diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. these include climate and environmental change, land-use variation, and changes in population and human behaviour. emergence, risk, spread, and control of infectious diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. the findings of this Review can assist scientists in the critical selection and development of methods for quantifying the effects of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. inter-connections between human health, the environment, and also animal health as advocated by the one health holistic vision [82] are increasingly recognized. involving the wider public via community-based studies and citizen science could help in identifying the different sources of the temporal lag from the start of the pathway to infection to disease detection. surveys could be used by public health institutions to gather data on patient behaviour, symptom onset, food and water exposures, and the location of the potential sources of infection. inter-connections between human health, the environment, and also animal health are increasingly recognized. incorporating information on human behaviour and socio-economic factors can help reduce reporting bias. emergence, risk, spread, and control of infectious diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. emergence, risk, spread, and control of infectious diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. this includes climate change, land-use variation, and changes in population and human behaviour. high resolution, zoomable image
