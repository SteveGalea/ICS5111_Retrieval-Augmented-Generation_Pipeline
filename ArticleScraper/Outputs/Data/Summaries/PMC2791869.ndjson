{"summary": "world health organization declared phase 6 of novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. by the end of September 2009, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. the return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. many countries have established a stockpile of antivirals for the treatment of the sick. there are a number of possible public health measures that may be used to stop or slow down the spread. border control has been extensively discussed in this context to delay the international spread of influenza. to construct possible baseline scenarios we used some of the estimates of properties of the novel virus that have been published based on data from the initial outbreak in Mexico by Fraser [11] similar estimates for R0 and a little higher estimates for the generation time were found in the USA [13]. to model a possible evolution of an epidemic in Germany including assumptions about importation and domestic spread. imported cases limited to 120 imported cases per day. the exponential growth rate was determined by assuming an \u201cimport-R0\u201d of 1.1 and the same generation time as for the transmission inside Germany. for an R0 of 1.58 the point estimate of the timing of the peak after introduction of the first case would be 10 to 11 weeks. the peak of the epidemic is delayed for an assumed R0 of 1.58 and 5 imported cases per day when the first 500 cases are managed with a combination of intensive case-based measures (CCM1). the effect of the number of household focused interventions (CCM2) on the delay of the peak is dependant on the basic reproduction number R0 and the sensitivity of the surveillance system. CCM2 for following 0 cases 5,000 cases 10,000 cases A CCM1 Ro Case detection rate Case detection rate Case detection rate 10% 30% 50% 10% 30% 50% 50% 5 imported cases/day for first 100 1.34 7 15 19 21 164 >180 24 >180 >180 1.58 4 10 16 10 42 >180 11 49 >180 2.04 3 7 11 5 17 48 5 18 56 for first 500 1.34 12 40 74 22 172 >180 24 >180 >180 1.58 6 20 47 10 43 >180 11 50 >180 if R0 is as low as 1.34 it is much easier to delay the peak. the effect of CCM1 and CCM2 can delay the peak at most by 8 weeks (57 days) but only when case detection rate is high (50%) the maximum number of antivirals, however, can be estimated. the exponential growth rate was determined by assuming an \u201cimport-R0\u201d of 1.1 and the same generation time as for the transmission inside Germany. for an R0 of 1.58 the point estimate of the timing of the peak after introduction of the first case would be 10 to 11 weeks. the peak prevalence of the population infected would be 4.3%, for the total attack rate of the population infected 44.8% and for the population diseased 38.5%. 7 67.6 10.2 4.3 6.9 symptomatic 7 58.1 8.8 4.1 6.7 The other importation scenarios lead to very similar characteristics. effect of the number of household focused interventions (CCM2) on the delay of the peak is dependant on the basic reproduction number R0 and the sensitivity of the surveillance system. the number of imported cases (column A), the number of CCM1 and CCM2 treatments, R0 and the case detection rate (10%, 30% or 50%) for first 100 1.34 7 15 19 21 164 >180 24 >180 >180 1.58 4 10 16 10 42 >180 11 49 >180 2.04 3 7 11 5 17 48 5 18 56 for first 500 1.34 12 40 74 22 172 >180 24 >180 >180 1.58 6 20 47 10 43 >180 11 50 >180 2.04 effect of R0 All of the above calculations are very sensitive to the value of R0. if R0 is as low as 1.34 it is much easier to delay the peak. effect of CCM1 and CCM2 can delay peak at most by 8 weeks. but only when case detection rate is high (50%) increasing number of cases/day (R0 = 1.1) for first 100 1.34 9 18 23 22 72 94 25 89 126 1.58 5 15 23 11 45 90 12 51 111 2.04 3 9 17 5 19 53 5 21 61 for first 500 1.34 13 34 42 22 74 97 25 90 129 1.58 7 25 44 11 46 92 12 52 113 2.04 3 12 29 5 19 54 5 21 61. if the household members of 10,000 cases are given antiviral prophylaxis this would amount to another 10,0003 ( = 30,000) treatment courses. if the household members of 10,000 cases are given antiviral prophylaxis this would amount to another 10,0003 ( = 30,000) treatment courses, in total 37,500 treatment courses. a number of factors are important when effects of public health interventions are considered. the rate of seeding has significant impact on the delay that can be achieved by the interventions. the sensitivity of the surveillance system to detect cases is important. we have provided a number of different scenarios (case detection rates of 10, 30 and 50%) addressing how the described interventions may impact the epidemic. but many pieces of information are uncertain and may change due to real changes of the virus and its epidemiology. despite the many possible pitfalls and caveats of our study we believe that we have demonstrated the possible impact of a sequential strategy on the spread of the novel influenza virus A/H1N1. we assumed that at the outset of the epidemic the entire population is fully susceptible to infection with the influenza A/H1N1 virus. children were 2.06 (95% confidence interval 1.60\u20133.31) as susceptible as adults. they found that 86% (95% confidence interval 69%\u2013100%) of the infected persons become symptomatic. model does not incorporate assumptions about severity of disease or how severity might alter infectiousness. modelled four scenarios: in the first and second, CCM1 is maintained for the first 100 cases followed by 5,000 or 10,000 cases with a CCM2 strategy. for this purpose we varied the proportion of recognized imported cases from 0%, 10% and 30% to 50%. the assumed sensitivity of the surveillance system reflects the probability (10%, 30% or 50%) to detect domestic cases. the virologic and epidemiologic characteristics are similar to the epidemic in Mexico. they distinguished children (15 years of age) and adults (> = 15 years of age) and found that children were 2.06 (95% confidence interval 1.60\u20133.31) as susceptible as adults. we modelled four scenarios: in the first and second, CCM1 is maintained for the first 100 cases followed by 5,000 or 10,000 cases cared for with a CCM2 strategy. in the third and forth, CCM1 is maintained for 500 cases followed by 5,000 or 10,000 cases with a CCM2 strategy, respectively. the prevalence is calculated as proportion of infectious persons among the total population in the respective age group. the \u201cmost likely\u201d Ro of 1.58 from the study of Fraser et al. (Science, 2007) was used and case detection rates of symptomatic cases were set to 10% and 30%, respectively. reproduction numbers of 1.34, 1.58, and 2.04 are set to 30%. the case detection rate is set to 30%."}
