{"summary": "GOAT6 is a polytopic integral membrane protein required for the octanoylation of ghrelin, a weight- and glucose-modulating peptide hormone produced primarily in the stomach, upper gastrointestinal tract, and brains of vertebrates (1\u20133) GOAT6 is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily (20), which is composed of many multispanning membrane proteins from prokaryotes and GOAT octanoylates serine-3 of proghrelin in the ER lumen after signal peptide cleavage. a range of fatty acids can be processed by GOAT, and the most likely acyl donors are acyl-CoAs (reviewed in Ref. 34). GOAT has been proposed to contain eight transmembrane helices (TMs) (2). this has not been experimentally investigated. the topology of GOAT is critical to defining its detailed structure and mechanisms. er methods, such as TMHMM version 2.0 (40), TMpred (41), SOSUI (42), TopPred (43), and MEMSAT version 3 (44) gave very different results from species to species, even between the highly conserved human and mouse GOATs. both servers run a number of algorithms to make better predictions. however, the results from both servers were similarly inconsistent between species and thus hard to interpret. internally V5-tagged GOAT clones were prepared using fusion PCR (50) individual point mutants were made using a modified QuikChange protocol. asn-free and Lys-free GOAT were made in one round of polymerization. candidate TM-6 was found to be non-TM. candidate TM-6 was found to be non-TM. antibodies used were mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:500; Sigma), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma F7425), mouse anti-V5 (1:5000; Invitrogen), mouse anti-Myc 9E10 (1 g/ml), mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Molecular Probes), and rabbit anti-SSR1 (2 g/ml; Sigma HPA011276; recognizes residues 230\u2013286) image layouts were done in Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Illustrator CS6. coverslips were treated as above except fixation was in methanol for 20 min at 20 \u00b0C. synthesis Peptide synthesis was performed using the Fmoc strategy. GOAT purification mouse GOAT with a C-terminal TEV-3xFLAG tag was expressed in SF9 cells at 3\u20136 106/ml in 1\u20136-liter aerated spinner flasks using a 72-h baculoviral infection with a multiplicity of infection of 10. microsomes were collected at 120,000 g for 2\u20136 h, flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 \u00b0C. 3 g of purified, tag-cleaved mouse GOAT was desalted using PLRP-S 300A/10\u201315-m material (Polymer Labs/Agilent) packed in a pipette tip pre-equilibrated with 12% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA; washed three times in the same buffer; and eluted with 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. 2 pmol of GOAT samples in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.0008% FC-16 were diluted to 0.8, 0.3, and 0.1 A280. results from other cells were similar; results from other cells were similar. 25 g of SF9 microsomes (BCA) in 50 l of HBS (pH 7.0) was incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 5 min with 10 m C-terminally biotin-tagged human ghrelin (ghrelin-27-biotin), 60 m palmitoyl-CoA, and 1 m [3H]octanoyl-CoA (high specific activity; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) beads were washed three times with HBS + PI with 0.1% FC-16. eluted with 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma) in the same buffer and separated with SDS-PAGE. GOAT sequences were identified using BLASTp and tBLASTx searches. both missed TMs predicted by MemBrain and MEMSAT-SVM. TM propensity plots were overlaid on multiple-species alignment. cell culture HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) N-H1-3, and N-H1-3 constructs start with Met-56 and ATG codons. C-H10-11 and C-H11 are truncated after residues 357 and 399 respectively. asn-3 and Asn-6 of this sequence are glycosylated in IBV-M. cells were transfected 8\u201316 h after plating, and incubated for 40 h. cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. fixative was then quenched using PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 0.2% sodium azide. untransfected cells were stained identically, and primary antibodies were omitted. DNA was stained prior to imaging with Hoechst 33285 (0.1 g/ml, 5 min) coverslips were mounted using glycerol with 100mm N-propyl gallate. GO-CoA-Tat, GO-Tat, and GO-CoA-Tat F4BP were prepared as described previously (8). amide-linked ghrelin analogs were prepared in which Ser-3 in ghrelin was replaced with Alloc (allyloxycarbonyl) protected 1,2-diaminopropionic acid, orthogonally deprotected using palladium catalysis, and then reacted with octanoic microsomes were resuspended in 10 volumes of HBS + PI. microsomes were collected at 120,000 g for 2\u20136 h, flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen. supernatant was bound to pre-equilibrated FLAG-agarose in batch for 1\u20133 h. 3 g of purified, tag-cleaved mouse GOAT was desalted using PLRP-S 300A/10\u201315-m material. 2 pmol of GOAT was spotted in a sinapinic acid matrix in either 50% ethanol, 0.1% TFA or 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. GO-CoA-Tat F4BP was exposed for 10 min, ghrelin-28-Oct-F4BP for 2 min, and ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine for 15 min. samples were then analyzed on SDS-PAGE, blotted for biotin, and stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Invitrogen) as a loading control. beads were washed with 25 ml of TBS + 0.1% SDS on small columns. each1200-l cross-linking reaction contained 5 m GO-CoA-Tat F4BP and 5 mg of total microsome protein from either GOAT-3xFLAG containing microsomes. a battery of topology prediction servers were queried with GOAT sequences from various organisms, starting with mouse and human sequences. a multiple sequence alignment was submitted wherever possible. the results from both servers were inconsistent between species and thus hard to interpret. GOAT-3xFLAG was cloned into the CAG vector as described previously (8) with a modified multiple-cloning site. internally V5-tagged GOAT clones were prepared using fusion PCR. all clones were sequence-verified using the Bac2Bac system (Invitrogen) all clones were sequence-verified using the Bac2Bac system (Invitrogen) all clones were fully sequence-verified. cells were washed twice with ice-cold KHM, moved to room temperature, and fixed as above. antibodies used were mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:500; Sigma), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma F7425), mouse anti-V5 (1:5000; Invitrogen), mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Molecular Probes), mouse anti-GFP (1:1000); rabbit anti-SSR1 (2 g/ml); as controls, untrans image layouts were done in Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Illustrator CS6. GO-CoA-Tat, GO-Tat, and GO-CoA-Tat F4BP were prepared as described previously. ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine, 7,7\u2032-diazooctanoic acid was used at this step. synthesized peptides were purified using a reversed-phase C-18 column. the final concentrations of the compounds in aqueous solution were determined by amino acid analysis. supernatant was solubilized for 1\u20133 h with 1% Fos-Choline 16 (FC-16; Anatrace) supernatant was bound to pre-equilibrated FLAG-agarose in batch for 1\u20133 h and then transferred to a column. washed with HBS + PI + 0.05% FC-16 and with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.005% FC-16 2 pmol of GOAT was spotted in a sinapinic acid matrix (Laser BioLabs) in either 50% ethanol, 0.1% TFA or 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. calibration was with AB SCIEX C3 standards (5\u201317 kDa) in adjacent spots. microsomal GOAT Octanoyltransferase Assay SF9 microsomes containing GOAT-3xFLAG and control microsomes from empty vector SF9 cells were prepared as above. 25 g of SF9 microsomes (BCA) in 50 l of HBS (pH 7.0) was incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 5 min with 10 m C-terminally biotin-tagged human ghrelin (ghreli 0.4\u201340 g sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) or buffer was added to each sample and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. samples were bound to pre-equilibrated anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) overnight. pred II (47) and polyPhobius (48) can use a multiple sequence alignment as input. these algorithms predict only seven and eight TMs, respectively. both missed TMs predicted by MemBrain and MEMSAT-SVM. asn-free and Lys-free GOAT were made in one round of polymerization using MISO mutagenesis. N-terminal deletion N-H1 starts with a Met at residue 32. C-H10-11 and C-H11 are truncated after residues 357 and 399 respectively. 200,000 HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips, transfected 8\u201316 h after plating. cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, fixative was then quenched using PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 0.2% sodium azide (PBS/gly) for selective permeabilization, dishes were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold KHM (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Roche Applied Science 11814460001), rabbit anti-SSR1 (2 g/ml; Sigma HPA011276; recognizes residues 230\u2013286) untransfected cells were stained identically, and primary antibodies were omitted. GO-CoA-Tat, GO-Tat, and GO-CoA-Tat F4BP were prepared as described previously (8). amide-linked ghrelin analogs were prepared in which Ser-3 in ghrelin was replaced with Alloc (allyloxycarbonyl) protected 1,2-diaminopropionic acid, orthogonally deprotected using palladium catalysis. GOAT Purification Mouse GOAT with a C-terminal TEV-3xFLAG tag was expressed in SF9 cells at 3\u20136 106/ml in 1\u20136-liter aerated spinner flasks using a 72-h baculoviral infection with a multiplicity of infection of 10. microsomes were collected at 120,000 g for 2\u20136 h, flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 \u00b0C. 3 g of purified, tag-cleaved mouse GOAT was desalted using PLRP-S 300A/10\u201315-m material. 2 pmol of GOAT was spotted in a sinapinic acid matrix (Laser BioLabs) in either 50% ethanol, 0.1% TFA or 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. 300 mm NaCl, and 0.0008% FC-16 were diluted to 0.8, 0.3, and 0.1 A280, corresponding to 6.8, 2.6, and 0.9 m. results from other cells were similar; results from other cells were similar. tagged human ghrelin (ghrelin-27-biotin), 60 m palmitoyl-CoA, and 1 m [3H]octanoyl-CoA. beads were washed with 25 ml of TBS + 0.1% SDS on small columns and then scintillation-counted. 16 GOAT sequences were identified and, in the cases of dog, green anole, and chicken, annotated. most individual algorithms and consensus prediction servers gave very different results from species to species. two more recently developed programs, MemBrain (54) and MEMSAT-SVM (55), stood out in consistency of results across species. bioinformatic analysis of GOAT sequences identifies 12 candidate TMs. shown is GOAT multiple sequence alignment across 16 species. for clarity, TMs and loops are numbered in accordance with our final model. MEMSAT-SVM predicts this region as one long TM in all cases. no signal peptide is predicted for GOAT by MemBrain, MEMSAT-SVM, PolyPhobius, or SignalP (56) permeabilization with digitonin revealed cytosolic but not lumenal epitopes. full permeabilization with Triton X-100 (TX-100) revealed all accessible epitopes. two dishes were stained for proteins with known cytosolic and lumenal epitopes. mouse GOAT clones were made with various internal and terminal epitope tags. the V5 tag was installed at the N and C termini and at all internal positions except for 8c and 8d. to ensure that the internal tag did not perturb overall topology, \u201cflipping\u201d the C terminus to the opposite side of the membrane, all clones contain a constant C-terminal 3xFLAG tag. bic c6 does not cross the membrane. we suggest that this segment represents a reentrant loop. the internal tagged proteins were expressed well. this was probably due to masking of the epitope rather than an expression problem. ghrelin was added to 25 g of total microsome protein in a 50-l reaction for 10 min at 30 \u00b0C. each bar represents an average of duplicates; error bars, S.D. D, selective permeabilization of mouse GOAT with three different epitope tags and an additional internal Myc tag. selective permeabilization with insertion of single epitope tags demonstrated that GOAT has an odd number of TMs, confirmed the existence of 9 of 12 predicted TMs, and suggested that one TM domain was a reentrant loop. using this method, we were unable to conclusively determine the topology around position 9 or the location of the conserved His-338. fusion of the SUC2-HIS4C to C termini (without truncation) has been shown to cause incorrect C-terminal localization in some cases. a very large protein insertion can further perturb the overall topology. this is a novel dual purpose topology reporter. a strong consensus glycosylation site could provide a consistent context for oligosaccharyltransferase, increase sensitivity for immunostaining and immunoblotting. it could also be readily installed in-frame in the context of a full-length protein of interest. we tested a series of additional residues on either side, resulting in the sequence GYLNVTYV as a strong prediction. dase F, and its C terminus was cytosolic and thus not glycosylated. the technique also confirmed localizations of all internal positions. position 9 was found to be lumenal by both peptide-N-glycosidase sensitivity and selective permeabilization. positions 8a and 8b are not shown; no full-length GOAT could be detected from these constructs. in C, two additional positions were tested in loop 8 (8c and 8d) and both expressed well and confirmed cytosolic location. GOAT with V5Glyc tag installed in positions 8a and 8b did not result in full-length protein, so positions 8c and 8d were tested with this tag. in a mass spectrometry experiment, we observed a peptide corresponding to ubiquitylation at residue Lys-141, suggesting cytosolic localization. GOAT topology model as an 11-TM protein with one reentrant loop. GOAT purified from SF9 cells produces three distinct bands upon SDS-PAGE when the proteins are maximally separated and Coomassie-stained. the middle band is generally absent from immunoblots (Fig. 8E) and may represent a co-purified protein. the banding pattern did not change in response to hydroxylamine and hydrazine treatment of GOAT. the banding pattern did not change in response to hydroxylamine and hydrazine treatment of GOAT. anti-FLAG immunoblot of GOAT-3xFLAG in SF9 cells shows multiple bands are not due to post-translational modification on asparagine or lysine or at residue Cys-368 or Ser-309. treatment with hydrazine or hydroxylamine does not alter the banding pattern of purified GOAT. mouse GOAT used in this experiment was eluted from FLAG resin using 100 mm glycine, pH 3.5, TEV-cleaved GOAT has a molecular mass of 50.6 kDa. as a monomer or dimer in micelles, the predicted mass would be 123 or 174 kDa. this size does not allow clear determination of whether purified GOAT is a monomer or dimer. a minor species with a mass of 44,428 Da was found. the lower GOAT band is a protein with N terminus Met-56. the lower GOAT band is a protein with N terminus Met-56. the start codon for N-H1-2 is Met-56; for N-H1-3 and N-H1-4, a Met was installed in place of residues 81 and 109, respectively, as the first residue of the construct. all deletion mutants have a C-terminal TEV-3xFLAG. mutation of Met-56 removes the lower band from mouse GOAT. a recorded human coding SNP specifies this polymorphism (rs7813902) both clones performed identically in our assays. we migrated with the lower band in the full-length construct. but none of the mutants were active. mouse GOAT has only three loops where central installation of NXS or NXT motifs would also allow sufficient spacing from the membrane for potential glycosylation by oligosaccharyltransferase. in loops 5 and 6, we installed sites on both sides of the reentrant helix (I149N and Q191N, NRS in both cases) GOAT is a biotinylated analog of the bisubstrate inhibitor of GO-CoA-Tat. a 15-kDa cross-linked fragment was detected in both anti-FLAG and biotin blotting. a partial proteolysis of cross-linked microsomal GOAT reveals a 15-kDa cross-linked fragment. microsomes were solubilized, digested with trypsin, and isolated using anti-FLAG beads. samples were then immunoblotted using streptavidin or anti-FLAG beads. ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine is an acyl ghrelin product analog photocross-linker. coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining is used as a loading control. we synthesized two ghrelin product analogs with photocross-linking moieties. GOAT was then cross-linked with these three analogs alone or in the presence of an excess of the indicated unlabeled competitors. both product cross-linker analogs competed by GO-CoA-Tat. results suggest that the location of the photoreactive groups does not affect analog binding. acyl ghrelin and acyl ghrelin could also compete. TM-1, -5, -8, and -9 were predicted to be either a TM or a reentrant loop, depending on species. TM-7 predicted to be one long TM in 13 of 16 species, but in dogs, horses, and green anoles, it predicts this region as one TM and one reentrant loop. GOAT protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (38) dog and green anole sequences were identified and annotated from their genomes. chicken annotation was corrected to include the first exon (TM-1 and -2) TM-8 and TM-9 are predicted to be two separate TMs by MemBrain in 14 of 16 species. mouse GOAT bearing a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag is localized to the ER in HeLa cells. all constructs have a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag as an internal control. two dishes were stained for proteins with known cytosolic and lumenal epitopes. position 8b was added later due to masking of V5 epitopes installed at 8a. positions 8c and 8d were added with V5Glyc tags. the GOAT N terminus contains a non-cleaved internal signal sequence. clones were made with various internal and terminal epitope tags. the GOAT C terminus was consistently localized in the cytosol in all constructs, with the 3xFLAG tag readily detectable. the ability to detect the V5 tag varied from construct to construct. both positions 5 and 6 were found to be cytosolic, suggesting that the strongly predicted, hydrophobic c6 does not cross the membrane. a new tab Selected human GOAT constructs recapitulate mouse GOAT results. a selective permeabilization of human GOAT constructs bearing the indicated internal Myc epitope tag with constant C-terminal 3xFLAG tags. all SF9 constructs have C-terminal TEV-3xFLAG-His tags. 5-Myc construct showed GOAT activity within 3-fold of the untagged version. this suggests that the 5-Myc epitope tag was tolerated. the 3xFLAG tag caused artifactual cytosolic localization of the GOAT C terminus. fusion of the SUC2-HIS4C to C termini (without truncation) has been shown to cause incorrect localization in some cases. a very large protein insertion can further perturb the overall topology. the V5Glyc tag is a novel dual purpose topology reporter. this tag was designed using the NetNGlyc server8 to provide a consistent context that can be glycosylated if located in the ER lumen. only lumenal asparagines in the appropriate context and spaced far enough from the membrane can be N-glycosylated. this could provide a consistent context for oligosaccharyltransferase, increase sensitivity for immunostaining and immunoblotting. tag is 36 amino acids long, and its complete sequence is GKPIPNPLLGLDST-GYLNVTYV-GKPIPNPLLGLDST. we then installed the V5Glyc tag at all previously reference positions in mouse GOAT and used it to probe topology by gel shift immunoblotting. the N terminus of GOAT was lumenal with complete glycosylation, removable by peptide-N-glycosidase F. c tags and a constant C-terminal 3xFLAG tag were lysed 20 h after transfection. only lumenal positions can be glycosylated, and peptide-N-glycosidase F treatment cleaves off the oligosaccharide. positions 8a and 8b are not shown; no full-length GOAT could be detected. a variety of alternate glycosylation signal sequences were installed at the GOAT N terminus. a mutation creating a consensus NX(S/T/C) glycosylation site was not glycosylated. GOAT with V5Glyc tag installed in positions 8a and 8b did not result in full-length protein. the most conserved region across all MBOAT residues is shown as yellow stars. the figure design is modified from the output of MEMSAT-SVM. the middle band is generally absent from immunoblots. mobilities of the top and bottom bands when GOAT was produced were identical. we found that the two predominant bands did not change when all lysines or all asparagines were removed from GOAT by conversion to alanine residues. GOAT alone has a calculated molecular mass of 50.6 kDa. empty FC-16 detergent micelles are 72.5 kDa and do not result in UV absorbance signal at the concentration used. fringes over time are shown in progression from red to black. we analyzed purified mouse GOAT in FC-16 detergent micelles. the solution contains a mixture of detergent micelles containing GOAT and empty detergent micelles. the empty micelles are 72.4 kDa for FC-16, with an aggregation number of 178 detergent molecules/micelle (Anatrace) Approximately 90% of the signal in the sample fit to a single peak at 1.9 S, which was normalized to 5.4 S when taking into account the temperature correction factor (20 \u00b0C, water) this sedimentation behavior corresponds to an approximate molecular mass of 110 kDa, consistent with monomeric GOAT in FC-16. all mutants have a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag. GOAT proteins are labeled 46A and 46T. expression levels are reduced by 5\u201310-fold for mutants. Met-56 is predicted to be the last (lumenal) residue in TM-2. recovery of the lower band suggests that GOAT lacking its first two TMs might be stable. we therefore made constructs for baculoviral expression from which the first, first two, first three, and first four helices had been removed. asn-27 is at the cytosolic border of TM-1 and asn-366 is in the middle of the cytosolic loop between TM-9 and -10. Conserved Asn-307 is in an NXS motif but is both cytosolic and not predicted to be glycosylated. GOAT was found to be ubiquitylated by electrospray mass spectrometry. a trypsin site was not cleaved and a shift corresponding to GG isopeptide linkage. this is consistent with cytosolic localization, because ubiquitylation can only occur on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (67). a partial proteolysis of covalently photocross-linked mouse GOAT reveals a 15-kDa cross-linked fragment. GO-CoA-Tat F4BP was photocross-linked to microsomal mouse GOAT-3xFLAG or to control microsomes (Ctrl; from empty-virus infected cells) microsomes were then solubilized, digested with trypsin, and isolated using anti-FLAG beads. GO-CoA-Tat F4BP (C), ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine (D) and ghrelin-28-Oct-F4BP (E) were cross-linked to purified, solubilized mouse GOAT in the presence of an excess of the indicated unlabeled competitors. ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine and ghrelin-28-Oct-F4BP behaved similarly to each other but distinctly from the bisubstrate. both product cross-linker analogs were competed by GO-CoA-Tat. this suggests that their binding to GOAT overlaps where the bisubstrate binds. two more recently developed programs, MemBrain (54) and MEMSAT-SVM (55), stood out in consistency of results across species. results from both programs were nearly identical, including predicted helical boundaries, except where described below. c6-RL, candidate 6 reentrant loop; this region was found to be non-transmembrane, probably a reentrant loop. highly conserved asn-307 and invariant His-338 residues are highlighted in green. additional highly conserved MBOAT residues are highlighted in green. a mouse GOAT bearing a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag is localized to the ER in HeLa cells, as seen by co-localization with co-transfected CFP-KDEL. two dishes of HeLa cells were transfected with a GOAT cDNA bearing an internal V5 or Myc epitope tag. to test the topology predictions, we designed GOAT constructs containing N-terminal and C-terminal tags. GOAT constructs were generated with internal epitope tags inserted in the loops between candidate TMs, aligning to gaps where possible. position 8b was added later due to masking of V5 epitopes installed at 8a. clones were transfected with constructs of interest and either fully permeabilized with Triton X-100 or selectively permeabilized at the plasma membrane with digitonin. both proteins were detected with triton X-100 permeabilization, but only the cytosolic SSR1 epitope was detected with digitonin permeabilization. both positions 5 and 6 were found to be cytosolic, suggesting that the strongly predicted, hydrophobic c6 does not cross myc tag was strongly detected at positions 8a and 8b, with clear cytosolic localization. Neither V5 nor Myc tag was visible at positions 9 or 11b. the proteins were expressed, as seen by 3xFLAG staining. the construct with a Myc tag at position 8b also has a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag. to confirm the cytosolic localizations of positions 5 and 8, we made parallel constructs in human GOAT, repeated the selective permeabilizations and expressed them in SF9 cells for activity assays. the V5Glyc tag allows sensitive readout of topology by both glycosylation gel shift and selective permeabilization immunofluorescence microscopy. we wanted to leverage the fact that N-linked glycosylation only occurs in the ER lumen. however, glycosylation is context-sensitive, requiring both appropriate sequence context for recognition. the V5Glyc tag is a novel dual purpose topology reporter. it is a neutral, hairpin-like tag containing an optimized 8-residue consensus for N-linked glycosylation. only lumenal asparagines in the appropriate context can be N-glycosylated. synthetic V5Glyc sequences in the centers of lumenal loops 2 and 4 on GOAT. we found that NXS was at best weakly predicted to be glycosylated. but NXT was stronger, with NVT optimal but still only with 62% confidence. we iteratively tested a series of additional residues on either side. positions 8a and 8b were tested in loop 8, 8c and 8d. both were full-length and found to be cytosolic. a summary of all topology data is presented in Table 1. GOAT bearing the indicated internal V5Glyc tag was used, and all constructs have a constant C-terminal 3xFLAG tag. loop 8 is longer, so three constructs were generated. none of these epitopes could be glycosylated, consistent with cytosolic locations. GOAT topology model as an 11-TM protein with one reentrant loop. confirmed TMs are shown in green, spanning the ER membrane (gray) we suggest that the hydrophobic region of GOAT c6 predicted to be a TM domain may be a reentrant loop. the lower band was absent from the blot for the modular V5Glyc tag. but present at a smaller molecular weight in the C-terminal FLAG blot. this split suggested that the two bands represent GOAT proteins with different N termini (i.e. with two distinct translational start sites) coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of purified mouse GOAT reveals three bands. four identical lanes of mouse GOAT were used as input for electroelution. bands in A are stable species, not interconverting gel artifacts. e or hydroxylamine does not alter the banding pattern of purified GOAT. mouse GOAT was incubated overnight at indicated temperatures and concentrations with hydrazine and hydroxylamine (pH 8.0) eluted from FLAG resin using 100 mm glycine, pH 3.5, and retains the C terminus of the 3xFLAG tag. GOAT in its FC-16 micelle is 140.7 kDa. this size does not allow clear determination of whether purified GOAT is a monomer or dimer. this size does not allow clear determination of whether purified GOAT is a monomer or dimer. lower GOAT band is a protein with N terminus Met-56. a, MALDI-TOF of intact, purified tag-cleaved mouse GOAT. expected molecular weights (MW) with the indicated start codons are inset. mutation of Met-56 removes the lower band from mouse GOAT. expression levels are reduced by 5\u201310-fold for mutant constructs. expression levels are reduced by 5\u201310-fold for mutant constructs. expression levels are reduced by 5\u201310-fold for mutant constructs. the lower band was no longer detectable in any of these mutants. the expression of the mutant proteins was lower than that of WT. the lower band was no longer detectable in any of these mutants. neither mutant GOAT could be glycosylated by NetNGlyc. mutants I290N, L293N, and R298N were predicted to be glycosylated. loop 10 (20 residues) already contains Asn-366. a partial proteolysis of cross-linked microsomal GOAT reveals a 15-kDa cross-linked fragment. GO-CoA-Tat F4BP was photocross-linked to microsomal mouse GOAT-3xFLAG or to control microsomes (Ctrl; from empty-virus infected cells) synthetic scheme to make ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine an acyl ghrelin product analog photocross-linker. photolabile diazirine was installed at the 7-position of the octanoic acid side chain. biotinylated lysine was installed at the C terminus of ghrelin-28. cross-linking moieties in the lipid (ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine; Fig. 10B) and on the adjacent residue in the peptide chain (ghrelin-28-Oct-F4BP) were then cross-linked with these three analogs alone or in the presence of an excess of the following unlabeled competitors. GO-CoA-Tat, acyl ghrelin, desacyl g 16 GOAT sequences were identified and, in the cases of dog, green anole, and chicken, annotated. two more recently developed programs, MemBrain and MEMSAT-SVM, stood out in their consistency of results across species. TM-7 is predicted to be one long TM by MemBrain in 13 of 16 species. but in dogs, horses, and green anoles, it predicts this region as one TM and one reentrant loop. bioinformatic analysis of GOAT sequences identifies 12 candidate TMs. no signal peptide is predicted for GOAT by MemBrain, MEMSAT-SVM, PolyPhobius, or SignalP (56). this method predicts that the GOAT N terminus is lumenal and its C terminus is cytosolic. all constructs have a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag as an internal control. permeabilization with digitonin revealed cytosolic but not lumenal epitopes. full permeabilization with Triton X-100 (TX-100) revealed all accessible epitopes. mouse GOAT clones were made with various internal and terminal epitope tags. the internal tag was installed at the N and C termini and at all internal positions except for 8c and 8d. to ensure that the internal tag did not perturb overall topology, \u201cflipping\u201d the C terminus to the opposite side of the membrane. both positions 5 and 6 were found to be cytosolic, suggesting that the strongly predicted, hydrophobic c6 does not cross the membrane. we suggest that this segment represents a reentrant loop. the C-terminal part of the protein was more challenging, with the V5 tag undetectable at position 8a, 8b, 9, or 11b. this was probably due to masking of the epitope rather than an expression problem. ghrelin was immobilized on streptavidin-linked polyacrylamide beads. each bar represents an average of duplicates; error bars, S.D. D, selective permeabilization of mouse GOAT with three different C-terminal epitope tags. GOAT with V5 or 3xMyc tags repeated selective permeabilization. these epitopes were all found to be cytosolic. GOAT has an odd number of TMs, confirmed the existence of 9 of 12 predicted TMs. this DTR is a very large modification of 130 kDa. it is inconvenient to clone in-frame without using yeast homologous recombination. fusion of the SUC2-HIS4C to C termini has been shown to cause incorrect C-terminal localization in some cases. a much smaller, flexible hairpin-like DTR consisting of two V5 epitope tags flanking a strong consensus glycosylation site could provide a consistent context for oligosaccharyltransferase. we queried the NetNGlyc server, a neural network-based N-glycosylation prediction tool, with candidate synthetic V5Glyc sequences in the centers of lumenal loops 2 and 4. the N terminus of GOAT was lumenal with complete glycosylation, removable by peptide-N-glycosidase F, and its C terminus was cytosolic and thus not glycosylated. the technique also confirmed localizations of all internal positions, both for those that led to weaker expression. position 9, immediately adjacent to the His-338 residue, was found to be lumenal by both peptide-N-glycosidase the anti-FLAG blot in D shows an additional band present (gray arrow) not seen in the anti-V5 blot for the N-terminal construct and position 1. positions 8a and 8b are not shown; no full-length GOAT could be detected from these constructs. in C, two additional positions were tested in loop 8 (8c and 8d) GOAT with a Myc tag installed in positions 8a and 8b did not result in full-length protein, so positions 8c and 8d were tested with this tag. a peptide corresponding to ubiquitylation at residue Lys-141 suggests cytosolic localization. EMSAT-SVM is an Alternate Start Codon in mouse GOAT. the two predominant bands from SF9 cells have a nearly identical size difference. the upper band was absent from the blot for the modular V5Glyc tag but present at a smaller molecular weight in the C-terminal FLAG blot. alanine residues were removed from GOAT by conversion to alanine residues. the banding pattern did not change in response to hydroxylamine and hydrazine treatment of GOAT. this suggests that multiple banding did not arise from fatty acid esterification. anti-FLAG immunoblot of GOAT-3xFLAG in SF9 cells with the indicated mutations shows that multiple bands are not due to post-translational modification on asparagine or lysine or at residue Cys-368 or Ser-309. treatment with hydrazine or hydroxylamine does not alter the banding pattern of purified GOAT. solution contains a mixture of detergent micelles containing GOAT and empty detergent micelles. the empty micelles are 72.4 kDa for FC-16, with an aggregation number of 178 detergent molecules/micelle (Anatrace) the predicted mass would be 123 or 174 kDa. ting the data using the program dC/dT+ calculated a similar S value. a minor species with a mass of 44,428 Da was found, consistent with a protein initiated at Met-56. the lower GOAT band is a protein with N terminus Met-56. the start codon for N-H1-2 is Met-56; for N-H1-3 and N-H1-4, a Met was installed in place of residues 81 and 109, respectively, as the first residue of the construct. mutation of Met-56 removes the lower band from mouse GOAT. expression levels are reduced by 5\u201310-fold for mutant constructs. the size of the construct co-migrated with the lower band in the full-length construct. however, none of the deletion mutants were active. the two different human GOAT clones have Thr or Ala at position 46. Conserved Asn-307 is in an NXS motif but is both cytosolic and not predicted to be glycosylated. GOAT has only three loops where central installation of NXS or NXT motifs would also allow sufficient spacing from the membrane for potential glycosylation by oligosaccharyltransferase. ubiquitylation can only occur on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (67). GOAT active site is photocross-linked by a biotinylated analog of the bisubstrate inhibitor of GO-CoA-Tat containing UV-activatable benzoylphenylalanine. microsomes were solubilized, digested with trypsin, and isolated using anti-FLAG beads. biotin cannot be removed from GO-CoA-Tat F4BP during trypsin digest. smaller tag-cleaved species may have fallen below the limit of detection. ghrelin-28-Oct-F4BP was cross-linked to purified, solubilized mouse GOAT in the presence of an excess of the indicated unlabeled competitors. we synthesized two C-terminally biotinylated ghrelin product analogs with photocross-linking moieties in the lipid (ghrelin-28-Oct-diazirine; Fig. 10B) both product cross-linker analogs competed by GO-CoA-Tat and acyl ghrelin. these results suggest that the location of the photoreactive groups does not significantly affect analog binding. GOAT, ACAT1, and ACAT2 have slightly similar topologies, but ACAT2 is quite different than the other three. all four MBOATs have in common that the invariant histidine (His-338) is lumenal or buried in the ER membrane near the lumen; this was also shown for partially mapped yeast MBOATs Ale1p and Are1p (68). these results are surprising considering that ACAT2 has 10 regions predicted to be transmembrane or reentrant by MemBrain. some of the non-TM hydrophobic regions were modeled as reentrant loops. however, the positions chosen should have efficiently interrogated these locations. it is possible, therefore, that ACAT2 has a distinct topology compared with the other MBOATs. the quaternary structure of GOAT has not been investigated previously. we show that purified GOAT in detergent micelles is a monomer. this suggests that GOAT can bind ghrelin and analogs as a monomer."}
