{"summary": "DENV has four closely related antigenically distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, which differ by 25 to 40% at the amino acid level. no relationship was observed between the extent and pattern of DENV-1 genetic diversity and disease severity, immune status, or level of viremia. chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) were exchanged between GII.4-1987 and GII.4-2006 strains by exchanging amino acids in putative epitopes. epitope A amino acids contributed significantly to the GII.4-1987 blockade response. a genome-wide approach was used that included 25 complete genome sequences from this study. recombination contributed to the emergence of the pandemic GII.4 variant, New Orleans 2009, and a newly identified GII.4 variant, termed Sydney 2012. a novel human coronavirus EMC (hCoV-EMC) is highly pathogenic. receptors did not facilitate transduction, suggesting that MERS-CoV uses a novel receptor for entry into human cells. TMPRSS2 and endosomal cathepsins activate EMC-S for virus-cell fusion."}
