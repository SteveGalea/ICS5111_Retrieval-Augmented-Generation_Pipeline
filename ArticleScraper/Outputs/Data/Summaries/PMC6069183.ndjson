{"summary": "synonymous virus genome recoding is being investigated as a new strategy for generating novel live attenuated vaccine candidates. recoding involves the introduction of hundreds or thousands of nucleotide substitutions, which minimize the risk of phenotypic reversion via point mutations or through recombination with homologous sequences. synonymous virus genome recoding was used to demonstrate that a synonymous position in sequence space can affect poliovirus evolvability and pathogenesis. it is presently unclear whether HIV-1 sequences have evolved to optimize both protein coding and DNA/RNA sequences. the HIV-1 genome exhibits a striking bias toward enrichment of A-rich codons. protease gene included 38 synonymous mutations (13% of the protease sequence) no substitutions were introduced into the first 40 amino-terminal protease nucleotides overlapping the carboxy terminus of the gag p6 reading frame. these 38 substitutions were chosen to improve protease gene codon pair bias (6) without modifying its codon bias or folding free energy (10). all slopes values were statistically tested against the WT value. only WTG48L and MAXG48L displayed a higher replication capacity than that of the WT in the presence of ATV. Xp32 showed more resistance to ATV and DRV than that of WTp32. these differences were not significant (P = 0.4816 and P = 0.3451, respectively). the virus did not show an impaired capacity to develop phenotypic resistance to PIs. the substitutions were detected only in the recoded MAX protease. other accompanying substitutions were also detected only in the MAX virus. this finding indicates that the MAX protease may explore sequence space. 0 L23I 0.8 0 0 V32A 76.3 0 53.3 59.9 V32I 10.1 24.0 2.9 23.8 V32T 0.65 0 0 0 0 L33F 0 0 0 P39Q 0.9 0 0.9 0 K45I 0 10.2 6.0 0 K45R 0 0.8 0 0 M46I 12.1 0 1.1 10.4 G48L 0 0 0 22.4 I we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce these mutations into both the WT and MAX protease backgrounds. we found that the five generated mutants displayed comparable ATV IC50s in both backgrounds. only the WTG48L and MAXG48L variants showed a lower replication capacity in the absence of drug. 48L 14.4 0.5 (8.1) MAXG48L 14.4 1.4 (8.1) WTQ58E 4.6 2.5 (2.6) MAXQ58E 5.6 3.8 (3.2) WTI84V 1.3 0.9 (0.7) MAXI84V 1.5 0.8 (0.8) WTL89I 1.5 0.5 (0.8) MAXL89I 2.1 0.6 (1.2) we compared the overall population nucleotide diversities of the WT and MAX proteases after 32 passages in the absence or presence of ATV or DRV. however, the MAX populations always displayed significantly higher diversity (P 0.0001) in either synonymous or nonsynonymous mutations. reversions of the starting synonymous substitutions introduced into the MAX protease in either the presence or absence of PIs. results showed that MAX viruses displayed higher population genetic diversity after 32 passages in cell culture. previously reported that polioviruses with synonymously mutated capsids were less mutationally robust and displayed an attenuated phenotype in an animal model. but that study did not focus on how synonymous mutations might affect the development of escape mutations to overcome specific selection pressure targeting a precise virus gene. in some cases, the different mutant repertoire within the MAX protease background can easily be explained by proximity within the corresponding sequence space (e.g., for the G16E and L89I mutations) however, the explanation for the difference is not readily apparent. the I89L mutation requires two nucleotide substitutions in the WT background and only one in the MAX background. this differential access to the protein sequence space may affect adaptive pathways. however, almost no reversions of the synonymous substitutions introduced into the MAX protease following propagation in the absence or absence of PIs. the used WT virus corresponded to the HIV-1 HXB2 strain (GenBank accession number K03455) the synthetic MAX HIV-1 protease was generated by PCR amplification with a protease-deleted HXB2 infectious clone. infected cells were incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. to quantify viral replication, we measured the HIV-1 capsid p24 antigen concentration in 200-l aliquots of supernatant. libraries of 558-nucleotide (nt) DNA fragments were ligated to the Illumina adapters by using a Kapa HyperPrep kit (Roche), a SeqCap adapter kit A (Roche) and a SeqCap adapter kit B (Roche) the products were purified using Kapa Pure beads (Roche) fastq files were demultiplexed using amplicon oligonucleotides. oligonucleotides were trimmed at both ends. reads with multiple indeterminations were removed, and deletions were repaired. n values vary from 0 (no complexity) to 1 (maximum complexity) (55). phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using the MEGA6 software package. cell culture supernatants were harvested at 3, 5, and 7 days posttransfection. the HIV-1 p24 antigen concentration surpassed 500 ng/ml as measured by the Genscreen HIV-1 Ag assay (Bio-Rad) values were expressed as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) as previously described. aliquots of culture supernatant were collected at passages 1 and 32. PCR products were the starting material for ultradeep sequencing. libraries of 558-nucleotide (nt) DNA fragments were purified using Kapa Pure beads. fastq files were obtained from the MiSeq system by index and pool. the 2 300 paired-end reads were overlapped to reconstruct the amplicons. reads with multiple indeterminations were removed, and deletions were repaired. Shannon's entropy values were calculated as follows: Sn = i (piln pi)/ln N. phylogenetic reconstructions were also performed using the MEGA6 software package."}
