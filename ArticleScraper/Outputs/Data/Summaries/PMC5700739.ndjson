{"summary": "the evolution and recombination of the coronaviruses in this region are still unknown. surveillance on the prevalence and the virus variation of HCoVs circulation in this region is conducted. a total of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from cross-border children. coronaviruses shared conserved gene sequences in S and RdRp. mutants of the epidemic strains were detected, suggesting continuous monitoring is in need among cross-border children."}
