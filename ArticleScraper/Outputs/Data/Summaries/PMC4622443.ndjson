{"summary": "the \u201cSilver Anniversary\u201d Antibody Engineering & Therapeutics meeting will be kicked off with a dynamic, audience-participatory workshop on antibody drug development. the workshop will conclude with 2 case studies. the first, by Dorina Saro, will focus on product development. this workshop brings together a number of experts who will present key knowledge-based advances to optimize target binding for increased specific activity. Christopher Thanos (Halozyme Therapeutics) and Sanjay Khare (ImmunGene, Inc.) will discuss advances in ADC targeting. the session highlights novel insights and important advances in the selection or engineering of antibodies that bear great promise for the development of improved immunotherapies. the meeting will open with keynote presentations by five luminaries in the field of molecular therapeutics development. new antibody phage display technologies have proven useful for selecting high quality, reliable and renewable antibodies. new scaffolds for anti-peptide antibodies for PTMs, and a new automation platform for large-scale antibody selections. ston BioConsulting, LLC and Stephen D. Gillies (Provenance Biopharmaceuticals) will open the session by orienting the audience with some background on ICs and the overall field. the session marks a pivotal juncture for these singular immunotherapeutics, and will include presentations on the latest advances in IC engineering. Dario Neri (ETH Z\u00fcrich) will describe their vigorous activities on the engineering of advanced ICs that utilize IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 for the treatment of different diseases. he will also discuss their progress in clinical studies. he will describe insights with patients that are sometimes distinct from mouse model-derived conclusions. Ekkehard Moessner is the head of protein engineering for Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development. he will discuss their progress in development of a novel class of ICs that include an optimized IL-2. they have tried to separate the cytokine contributions from ADCC by making antibody fusions with or without the Fc region. a different approach will be presented by Michael Gallo (Innovative Targeting Solutions) who has generated antibodies against the GLP-1 receptor and Glucagon receptor, two class B GPCRs. a different approach will be presented by Stefan Zahn (Novo Nordisk) the current lack of standardized, renewable and low-cost protein affinity reagents impedes progress in biomedical research. this session will update participants on a number of initiatives intended to produce and distribute such reagents. Andrew Bradbury will provide his insights to the problems existing with research antibodies. Roberto D. Polakiewicz will discuss the current problem of inadequate validation of marketed research antibodies. he will present new strategies for effective discovery and validation of high quality mAbs. the initiative is to generate and distribute standardized, renewable and low-cost protein affinity reagents to the scientific community. cMetxEGFR bispecific antibody was shown to increase target engagement of investigational antibodies in the brain by over 50-fold compared to the parent antibody. the importance of using the final format for bispecific discovery approaches will be illustrated with surprising results found during the selection. autoantibodies are directed against epitopes localized on the first or second extracellular loop of the membrane-spanning hormone receptors and act like the corresponding agonists. the functional AABs prevent the receptor desensitization normally seen if the receptors were stimulated for a longer time with the agonists. lead isolation, affinity maturation strategies and preclinical data for the antibody therapeutics will be discussed. a modified LCAT protein with Fc fusion (mLCAT-Fc) exhibited enhanced enzyme activity, improved manufacturability, and desirable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. a panel of novel agonistic human anti-LCAT antibodies suitable for therapeutic development will also be discussed. recombinant antibody-toxin fusion protein targets MSLN with a de-immunized 24-kD fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin. RG7787 is effective against both quiescent and proliferating tumor cells and has shown potential for clinical development in triple-negative breast and gastric cancers. the technology renders tumors susceptible to immune attack by mimicking viral infection and engaging a potent T-cell response. in vitro and in vivo work will be used to demonstrate proof-of-concept. a new approach in directing CARs against multiple myeloma will be presented. results from in vivo fluorescence and radionuclide imaging of S100A8/A9 expression indicate that S100A8/A9 has utility as new target for diagnostic imaging of immunosuppressive inflammation. the work is ground breaking because early detection, localization and monitoring of inflammation are crucial for tailoring individual therapies. mark Hogarth (Burnett Institute) will discuss recent data identifying critical functional polymorphisms between human and macaque FcR. an anti-CD19 antibody was derived that inhibits B cell function without inducing depletion. an anti-IgE antibody exploits FcRIIb's role in antigen clearance. the approval of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) for the treatment of melanoma represent the first of what will likely be a large panel of clinically-approved antibodies capable of modulating the immune response. blocking inhibitory receptors to promote immune responses against cancer and blocking activating receptors to diminish autoimmune responses represent the most obvious applications. a novel approach to inhibit the suppressive activity of Tregs will be presented by Michael Saunders (arGEN-X) antibodies targeting critical epitopes on GARP expressed on the surface of Tregs block its ability to bind TGF--1. the anti-GARP antibodies block its ability to bind TGF--1, which plays a key role in Treg-mediated immunosuppression. /CD154 pathway, anti-IL6 or possibly infusion of T regulatory cells to increase belatacept efficacy in the prevention of renal transplant rejection. many cancer patients fail to respond to these therapies. Vaccinex, Inc. will provide details of an antibody discovery platform that enables efficient mammalian cell-based expression of a library of human antibodies in full-length IgG format. Upon infection of mammalian cells, the antibody is incorporated into newly produced virus and displayed on the surface of the host cell. this approach combines the advantages of virus panning and cell sorting into one technology. b plus anti-PD-1 demonstrate extremely promising activity in patients with advanced malignant melanoma. ado-trastuzumab emtansine targets activated EGFR and delivers a cytotoxic payload. the commercial pipeline of antibody therapeutics is highly dynamic. the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows deep analysis of immune repertoires. this year's antibody engineering and therapeutics conference will focus on immune repertoire technology and data analysis. Sara D\u2019Angelo (Los Alamos National Laboratory) will discuss NGS data-analysis tools. he will present his analysis of NGS data from murine bone marrow and splenocytes. his analysis reveals biased VH gene-segment usage among these B-cell subsets. this is the first time a hemophilia treatment has been reported at this antibody conference. the molecular design of the molecule will be discussed along with preclinical and early clinical data. Ronit Mazor will present data for a redesigned immunotoxin with T Cell epitope mutations that minimize patient toxicity and immunogenicity. he will present data for a redesigned immunotoxin with T Cell epitope mutations that shows high cytotoxicity to cells isolated from cancer patients. stiakova (Pfizer) will present interesting results from studies of 2 antibodies to myostatin (GDF-8), a negative regulator of muscle growth. dupilumab blocks Th2 inflammation in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic asthma."}
