{"summary": "hantaviruses are rodent-borne, negative stranded, RNA viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, which may cause two types of disease in humans. hantavirus infection causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), characterized by renal failure and bleeding complications. study from Sweden reported increased risk for acute myocardial infarction shortly after PUUV infection. endothelial cells, also target cells for hantaviruses and major regulators of coagulation and inflammation, play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. siero et al., 1992; Mackow and Gavrilovskaya, 2009) ranging from increased clinical markers of a stressed endothelium in vivo to increased permeability and decreased HUVEC integrin ligand migration in vitro. integrin 3, experimentally proven to be the receptor for hantavirus infection, is abundantly present on the surface of endothelial cells. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were harvested from umbilical veins. cell pellet was re-suspended in HUVEC medium (human endothelial-SFM medium; Invitrogen, Life Sciences, USA) cell suspensions were cultured in flasks pre-coated with 20 g/ml of fibronectin. only cells up to passage four, from one specific donor, were used for this study. identity of the endothelial cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using Ulex europeus lectin, anti-CD31 and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) staining and immunoblot. infected cells were homogenized in DMEM (10% w/v) and 100 l was added onto a 70\u201380% monolayer of veroE6 cells. cells were washed three times and incubated with fresh veroE6 medium for an additional 5 days. infected cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Life Sciences) the medium did not contain FCS but was supplemented with 4% sterile filtered bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma Aldrich, USA) PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and bands of correct size were collected for DNA gel extraction. DNA fragments were cloned into the pCR4 vector using the recombinant vector (QIAGEN) at least five colonies were collected for further analyses. platelets were pelleted for 15 min at 700 g at 25C. platelets were washed twice and resuspended with modified hepes buffer. cells were incubated for 30 min at 37C/5% CO2 with PBS 0.05% H2O2. es virus infection (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2010), a pull down assay was designed. we first coated ELISA plates with PUUV or a control virus (VSV; 100 l of 106 virus particles in DMEM at 4C overnight) cells were washed five times with PBS and the bound platelets were quantified. E6 medium were incubated with a polyclonal PUUV serum (1:50) from a healthy volunteer (also 1:50) the following platelet binding steps and CD41 detection were the same as in the earlier experiments. OD 450 nm value was measured using a Tecan ELISA reader. Thrombin generation in platelet-poor plasma was measured directly on HUVEC surface. cells were washed three times with RPMI and 80 l freshly thawed plasma was added to the monolayer. incubation was used as a blanc control and anti-CD3 antibody (1:500) incubation as an isotype control. statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.01 for Windows. endothelial cells containing 10% human serum (Lonza), 20% filtrated FBS (Lonza), penicilin/streptomycin 100 U/ml, 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor and 10 ng/ml of endothelial cell growth factor (Peprotech, USA) only cells up to passage four, from one specific donor, were used for this study. antibodies and conjugate were diluted in dilution buffer. dilution buffer consisted of 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2% NaCl and 1% normal goat serum. supernatant was discarded and cells were washed three times. confluent monolayers were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or 3, with infectious and inactivated (BPL-inactivated) virus or a normal medium control for 60 min at 37C in 5% CO2. cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Life Sciences) RNA run-off transcripts were generated using a segment amplified with pan-hantavirus degenerative PCR primers from. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and bands of correct size were collected for DNA gel extraction using the recombinant vector (QIAGEN) at least five colonies were collected for further analyses. PUUV were homogenized in DMEM (10% w/v) and 100 l was added onto a 70\u201380% monolayer of veroE6 cells. cells were washed three times and incubated with fresh veroE6 medium for an additional 5 days. titer was determined using immune peroxidase reaction. infected cells were washed three times with PBS to block endogenous peroxidases. cells were incubated for 60 min with polyclonal rabbit anti-PUUV nucleoprotein antibody. percentage of infected cells was determined by manual counting. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and bands of correct size were collected for DNA gel extraction. DNA fragments were cloned into the pCR4 vector using the recombinant vector (QIAGEN) at least five colonies were collected for further analyses. platelets were pelleted for 15 min at 700 g at 25C. platelets were washed twice and resuspended with modified hepes buffer. cells were incubated for 30 min at 37C/5% CO2 with PBS 0.05% H2O2. ELISA plates coated with PUUV or a control virus (VSV; 100 l of 106 virus particles in DMEM at 4C overnight) cells were washed five times with PBS and the bound platelets were quantified by using a platelet detection antibody (anti-CD41a 1:500 in dilution buffer) the following platelet binding steps and CD41 detection were the same as in the earlier experiments. blood was collected in 0.105 M (end concentration) sodium citrate tubes (BD-plymouth, UK) to block platelet activation. platelets were pelleted for 15 min at 1300 g at 25C. a pull down assay was designed to test if changes in CD41a expression was related to direct binding between PUUV and platelets. ELISA plates were coated with PUUV or a control virus (VSV; 100 l of 106 virus particles in DMEM at 4C overnight) cells were washed five times with PBS followed by platelet incubation (107 platelets) ELISA plates were coated with an anti-platelet antibody (1:500 in PBS at 4C overnight), followed by incubation with fresh isolated platelets. hantavirus detection antibody (mouse mAB anti-PUUV-glycoprotein 1:500) followed by conjugate addition and TMB reaction steps. plates were fixed with 4% formalin and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-TF antibody (1:500) followed by incubation with the respective conjugate (1:500). after washing TMB was added for substrate reaction and reaction was stopped after 10 min by addition of 0.5 M of sulphuric acid. OD 450 nm value was measured using a Tecan ELISA reader. Thrombin generation time was defined as the time at half-maximal OD. thombin generation time was defined as the time at half-maximal OD. cells were washed three times with RPMI and 80 l freshly thawed plasma was added to the monolayer. on the same plate a serial dilution of recombinant TF (Innovin; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany) in the absence of cells. non-infected cells showed no red peroxidase staining, confirming specificity of the PUUV-staining. PUUV immune peroxidase (IPOX) staining and viral copy numbers after infection with a multiplicity of. Mock infected cells (A,B) showed no red peroxidase staining for PUUV nucleoprotein after 24 (A) and 48 (B) hours. infection with MOI 3 resulted in more infected cells after 24 h (E) which increased slightly at 48 h (F) analysis of viral replication showed a more than 2-log increase of viral copy numbers in both supernatant (G) and cell lysates (H), suggesting active viral replication increased CD41a expression after Incubation of Platelets on HUVEC upon PUUV Infection Gavrilovskaya et al. (2010) reported the potential of Hantaan and Andes virus to bind quiescent platelets via 3 integrin. this observation is of much importance in further understanding the alterations in primary hemostasis and its role in disease mechanisms in HFRS we decided to confirm this mechanism for PUUV using a different approach. HUVEC incubated with PUUV showed a trend to increased platelet CD41a expression. increased optical density (OD) of CD41a was measured 24 (A) and 48 (B) hours after infection. platelets adhere better to PUUV virus particles compared to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; A; Mann\u2013Whitney U p 0.0022) when virus was captured with a PUUV glycoprotein antibody (B), platelets were able to bind to the captured virus based on the significant increase in PUUV detection OD. PUUV was incubated on ELISA plates with wells coated with a monoclonal IgG2 specific for the glycoprotein of PUUV. by this approach significantly more platelets bound to the wells where PUUV was captured compared to wells with no PUUV capture. PUUV detection was significantly higher in the wells incubated with PUUV compared to VSV. increased thrombin generation was confirmed by incubation with a goat-anti human HRP labeled conjugate and subsequent TMB reaction. TF expression was significantly increased with an almost twofold increase in OD value 48 h post infection. cells infected with PUUV also showed an increased TF concentration when the cell lysates of PUUV infected wells were compared to the control wells. the MOI 0.5 infection led to higher levels of TF on the HUVEC surface only after 48 h post infection (one way ANOVA; p 0.05) when compared to mock. shortened TGT 48 h post infection (one way ANOVA p 0.001) to study potential changes in regulators of fibrinolysis we first measured PAI-1 levels in the cell-free supernatant and supernatant of cell lysate. the total PAI-1 antigen was significantly increased 48 h post infection (Kruskal\u2013Wallis; p 0.05) with MOI 3. panel B shows the PAI-1 vitronectin complex levels in HUVEC infected with PUUV (black) or non-infected controls (white) after 48 h of infection PAI-1 vitronectin levels were increased compared to the mock infection (Mann\u2013Whitney U p = 0.03; B) the number of viral RNA increased significantly (2-Log) after 48 h (Kruskal-Wallis; p = 0.0028), in the supernatant as well as in the cell lysate, confirming active viral replication. analysis of viral replication showed a more than 2-log increase of viral copy numbers in both supernatant (G) and cell lysates (H) the viral copy numbers in the supernatant or cell lysate of HUVEC incubated with BPL inactivated virus served as a control for non-replicating virus. Efficient inactivation was confirmed by negative IPOX staining of the HUVEC incubated with PUUV. increased CD41a expression after Incubation of Platelets on HUVEC upon PUUV Infection. virus free VeroE6 medium (negative control) at 24 h post infection. difference in CD41a expression was also significant between MOI 3 infected wells and the BPL inactivated virus control. HUVEC incubated with BPL did show a trend to increased platelet CD41a expression. platelets infected with PUUV showed no alteration in VWF activity. for this purpose we performed an in-house developed platelet pull down-assay using quiescent platelets. more platelets adhered to virus-coated plates compared to a virus control. PUUV was incubated on ELISA plates with wells coated with a monoclonal IgG2 specific for the glycoprotein of PUUV or with a control antibody. by this approach significantly more platelets bound to the wells where PUUV was captured compared to wells with no PUUV capture. PUUV detection was significantly higher in the wells incubated with PUUV compared to VSV. wells coated with PUUV were incubated with human serum with proven PUUV neutralizing IgG antibodies. the anti-CD41 expression in the wells with a blocking step was comparable to that of the negative control, which consisted out of plates coated with 5 days old vero E6 virus free medium. a goat-anti human HRP labeled conjugate and subsequent TMB reaction. TF concentration showed a statistically significant increase for MOI 3 at 24 h compared to the negative control and the HUVEC infected with MOI 0.5. the MOI 0.5 infection led to higher levels of TF only after 48 h post infection (one way ANOVA; p 0.05) when compared to mock. increased levels of PAI-1 and PAI-1-Vitronectin Complexes in HUVEC Supernatant after Infection with PUUV Important proteins show close interactions with the pathogenic hantavirus receptor 3 integrin. panel B shows the PAI-1 vitronectin complex levels in HUVEC infected with PUUV (black) or non-infected controls (white) after 48 h of infection PAI-1 vitronectin levels were increased compared to the mock infection (Mann\u2013Whitney U p = 0.03; Figure 5B). PUUV infection increases binding of platelets to the surface of HUVEC compared to control cells. increased CD41a detection could also be due to increased expression of CD41a on platelets after 30 min incubation. hantaviruses tested specific binding of platelets to PUUV particles. this seemed to be a specific binding between virus and platelets. this could be reversed by the addition of PUUV neutralizing antibodies. our experiment showed a trend to increased number of platelets bound to the BPL-inactivated virus treated cultures. this suggests active replication was unnecessary and inactivated virus might also bind to integrins present on both endothelial cells and platelets. increased TF production during infection could lead to increased clotting and consumptive coagulopathy or even DIC. increased TF expression has been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of other viral hemorrhagic fevers. natant of PUUV infected cells further strengthens this hypothesis. authors pledge further evaluation of interaction between 3 integrin, PAI-1, vitronectin and hantaviruses.
