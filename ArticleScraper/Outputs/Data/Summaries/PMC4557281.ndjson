{"summary": "the mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) firstly isolated from humans in 1951 commonly infects humans, but is pathogenic only in children. most infections result in only mild illness or are asymptomatic. recent discoveries have raised concern about future zoonotic reovirus infections in humans. the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in multi-cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, protein synthesis, and proliferation. the PI3K/Akt pathway appears to be associated with the host cell immune response to counteract viral infection. a large number of viruses rely on activation of the pathway for their replication. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by the influenza virus regulates an early step during viral entry. this impairs dimerization of IRF-3 and reduces IRF-3-dependent promoter activity. reovirus virions can use both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. all media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics. all the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. reovirus serotype I Lang (T1L), reovirus serotype II Jones (T2J) and reovirus serotype III Dear were propagated in L929 cells. Guinea pigs were infected by instilling 0.1 mL of 107 PFU in each nostril of the anesthetized animal. the antiserum was collected from infected animals 3 weeks later. for the HI test, 0.1 mL of 0.85% NaCl containing 4 units of hemagglutinin was added to 0.1 mL of serial twofold dilutions of serum in 0.85% NaCl. Plaques were fixed with 1 mL of 10% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. the cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature followed by two washes with water. membranes were incubated with IRDye 800DX conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or IRDye 800-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:8000; Rockland Immunochemicals) the membranes were visualized and analyzed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) serum-starved A549 cells were treated with LY294002 (10\u201350 M), wortmannin (0.1\u20135 M), chlorpromazine (5\u201350 M), genistein (50\u2013300 M), PP2 (30 M), PP3 (30 M), or solvent DMSO (0.4%, v/v). at 30 min post-infection, the phosphorylation of Akt, Gab1 and FAK in the lysates was quantified by Western blo denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, primer annealing at 54\u00b0C for 30 s, and DNA extension at 72\u00b0C for 20 s. relative quantification of gene expression was analyzed using the 2\u2013CT method. the cells (5 104) grown in 48-well plates were transfected with 0.4 g/well of a reporter plasmid, 0.4 g/well of an empty plasmid and 0.2 g/well of expression plasmid. cells were infected with reovirus and Sendai virus (SeV, positive control) 12 h after transfection. EMSY (sc-45565-SH), IFITM1 (sc-44549-SH), and ISG15 (sc-43869-SH) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. the siRNA targeting p85 (sc-39125) and clathrin (sc-35068) was ordered from Cell Signaling Technology. the cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for 48 h. monolayers were covered with 2 ml of 1% Bacto Agar (DIFCO) and serum-free medium 199 (Irvine Scientific) containing 10 g/ml TLCK-treated -CHT (Sigma-Aldrich) the plate was photographed 2 to 4 days later to determine the plaque titer. fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. all virus stocks were purified using CsCl gradients. loss of infectivity of the UV-irradiated virus was confirmed by plaque assay. PC/04 was identified by hemagglutination inhibition following published procedures (Rosen, 1960) Guinea pigs were infected by instilling 0.1 mL of 107 PFU in each nostril of the anesthetized animal. for the HI test, 0.1 mL of 0.85% NaCl was added to 0.1 mL of serial twofold dilutions of serum in 0.85% NaCl. Plaques were fixed with 1 mL of 10% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. then the agar overlays were peeled off and the cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature followed by two washes with water. membranes were incubated with IRDye 800DX conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or IRDye 800-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:8000; Rockland Immunochemicals) after three washes in TBST buffer, the membranes were visualized and analyzed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) ved A549 cells were treated with LY294002 (10\u201350 M), wortmannin (0.1\u20135 M), chlorpromazine (5\u201350 M), genistein (50\u2013300 M), PP2 (30 M), PP3 (30 M), or solvent DMSO (0.4%, v/v). at 30 min post-infection, the phosphorylation of Akt, Gab1 and FAK in the lysates was quantified by Western blot analysis denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, primer annealing at 54\u00b0C for 30 s, and DNA extension at 72\u00b0C for 20 s. the relative quantification of gene expression was analyzed using the 2\u2013CT method. cells (5 104) grown in 48-well plates were transfected with 0.4 g/well of a reporter plasmid, 0.4 g/well of an empty plasmid and 0.2 g/well of expression plasmid. cells were infected with reovirus and Sendai virus (SeV, positive control) 12 h after transfection. the siRNAs targeting p85 (sc-39125) and clathrin (sc-35068) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. the siRNA targeting FAK (6472s) was ordered from Cell Signaling Technology. the cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for 48 h. the plate was photographed 2 to 4 days later to determine the plaque titer. cells (5 104) grown in 48-well plates were transfected with 0.4 g/well of pISRE-TA-Luc reporter plasmid and 0.05 g/well of pRL-TK plasmid. cells were treated with 10 g/mL anti-IFNAR1 and 20 g/mL of anti-IFN lambda R1. the two new mammalian reoviruses used in this study were isolated from bats in 2003 (B/03) and civets in 2004 (MPC/04), respectively. both were isolated from apparently healthy animals in a surveillance study after the outbreak of SARS. phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that the B/03 strain belonged to serotype I and that the MPC/04 strain belonged to serotype III. Akt phosphorylation in B/03-infected cells at each time point reached higher levels than in B/03-infected cells. similar results were obtained in 293T cells (Figure 2C) and vero cells (Figure 2D) lysates from reovirus-infected cells were harvested at the indicated time points. phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) was detected by Western blotting. the results were confirmed in three independent experiments. serum-starved A549 cells were pre-incubated with LY294002 (LY; 10\u201350 M), wortmannin (Wort; 100 nM\u20131 M) or DMSO (0.4%, v/v) for 1 h and infected with MPC/04 (A,B) or B/03 (C,D) at a MOI of 5. A mock-infected lane was included in each panel as a negative control. Chlorpromazine (Chl), an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, completely suppressed Akt phosphorylation at a concentration of 10\u201350 M (Figures 4A,B) and inhibited reovirus RNA production (Figure 4I). clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for the induction of PI3K/Akt early in infection. cells pretreated with 50 M Chl or 200 M Gen for 1 h or transfected with 15 pmol/well of negative control (Negative siRNA) or clathrin siRNA for 12 h were infected with MPC/04 (E) or B/03 (G) at a MOI of 5. after 30 min, cells were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE. PP2, a selective Src-kinase family inhibitor that blocks integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation, abolished the phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK and serine 473 of Akt with both B/03 and MPC/04 infection. PP3, an inactive analog of PP2, had no effect on FAK or Akt phosphorylation. p-FAK, FAK, phosphorylated FAK (Tyr397; p-FAK), p-Akt (Ser473), total Akt and GAPDH levels were determined by Western blot analysis. p-FAK, FAK, p-Akt (Ser473), Akt and GAPDH levels were determined as for (A) PI3K/Akt signaling was required for reovirus replication. both viral RNA transcription and viral titers were measured after PI3K inhibition. pretreatment with ly294002 significantly increased reovirus replication. A549 cells were transfected with 4 g/well of shAkt or shCtrl for 24 h. cells were then infected with MPC/04 or B/03 at a MOI of 5. expression of Akt1 was determined by qPCR analysis and Western blot analysis. the growth of MPC/04 and B/03 in cells transfected with shAkt was compared with that in mock-transfected cells. the results showed that knockdown of Akt promoted the replication of both viruses at 72 and 96 h p.i. PI3K/AKT Inhibits Viral Replication Via Increasing IFN-stimulated Genes Expression. plaque assays in vero cells revealed knockdown of Akt formed larger plaques than mock-transfected cells. knockdown of Akt formed larger plaques than mock-transfected cells. reovirus infection-mediated induction of ISRE was independent of IFN production. Vero cells were transfected with 4 g/well of shAkt, transfected with 4 g/well of shCtrl or left untransfected for 24 h. cells were then infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5 or mock infected at 12 h post-transfection. 549 cells were cotransfected with pISRE-TA-Luc, RLTK and shAkt or shCtrl (negative control) 12 h after transfection, the cells were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5 or mock infected at 12 h p.i. infection of MPC/04 or B/03 also resulted in the phosphorylation of EMSY. overexpression of EMSY repressed the induction of ISRE (data not shown) and promoted viral replication. downregulation of EMSY by RNAi promoted the induction of ISRE. the two new mammalian reoviruses used in this study were isolated from bats in 2003 (B/03) and civets in 2004 (MPC/04) both were isolated from apparently healthy animals in a surveillance study after the outbreak of SARS. phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that the B/03 strain belonged to serotype I and that the MPC/04 strain belonged to serotype III (Figure 1). Akt phosphorylation in MPC/04-infected cells began after approximately 5 min. this was faster than the time required (approximately 15 min) in B/03-infected cells. similar results were obtained in 293T cells (Figure 2C) and vero cells. lysates from reovirus-infected cells were harvested at the indicated time points. the viral stock, filtrate, pellet and supernatant were used to infect A549 cells. at 30 min p.i., cell lysates were harvested. pretreatment with LY (50 M) or Wort (0.1 M) completely inhibited reovirus infection-induced Akt phosphorylation. Knockdown of p85 reduced the level of p-Akt at 30 min p.i. Activation of PI3K/Akt is Associated with Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis. cellular endocytosis play key roles in the activation of PI3K/Akt. Chlorpromazine (Chl) completely suppressed Akt phosphorylation at a concentration of 10\u201350 M (Figures 4A,B) the levels of p-Akt (Ser473), total Akt and clathrin were determined by Western blot analysis. 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with MPC/04 (E) or B/03 (G) at a MOI of 5. PP2, a selective Src-kinase family inhibitor that blocks integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation, abolished the phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of FAK and serine 473 of Akt. PP3, an inactive analog of PP2, had no effect on FAK or Akt phosphorylation. serum-starved A549 cells were pretreated with 10 M PP2 or PP3. expression of p-FAK, FAK, p-Akt (Ser473), Akt and GAPDH was determined. cells were transfected with 15 pmol/well of negative control (Negative siRNA) or FAK siRNA. p-Akt (Ser473), Akt and GAPDH levels were determined as for (A) the results were confirmed in three independent experiments. PI3K/Akt pathway Regulates Viral Replication. cells were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of LY294002, wortmannin or DMSO for 1 h. they were then infected with each drug for 24 h. expression of Akt1 was determined by qPCR analysis and Western blot analysis. 549 cells were transfected with shRNA control (shCtrl) and Akt shRNA (shAkt) constructs. after infection with MPC/04 and B/03, plaques for A549-shAkt were analyzed. knockdown of Akt promoted replication of both viruses at 72 and 96 h p.i. activation of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) was detected during reovirus infection. both viruses triggered the ISRE (Figure 7C) and downregulation of Akt by RNAi nearly abolished activation of the ISRE. cells were co-transfected with pISRE-TA-Luc and RLTK or shAkt or shCtrl. the cells were treated with anti-IFNAR1 and -IFN lambda R1 antibodies 12 h after transfection. cells were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5 or SeV. luciferase activities were determined at 12 h p.i. using a luciferase assay kit. cells were infected with MPC/04 and B/03 at a MOI of 5 or mock infected at 12 h post-transfection. seV infection was included as a positive control. the activated PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to the induction of a set of ISGs through the regulation of the EMSY transcriptional repressor. overexpression of EMSY repressed the induction of ISRE (data not shown) and promoted viral replication. both infections significantly increased the transcription of IFITM1, ISG15 and Viperin. the activated PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to the production of a set of ISGs through the EMSY transcriptional repressor. Akt is phosphorylated early in MPC/04 and B/03 infection in a PI3K-dependent manner. Akt phosphorylation is triggered and/or mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. reovirus is isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of humans and animals. no mutation in amino acid sequence was detected between the genomes. 1-integrin-mediated PI3K/Akt activation is induced by vaccinia virus at 20 min p.i.. blockage of PI3K/Akt activation did not affect reovirus absorption and entry. PI3K/Akt activation inhibited reovirus replication via up-regulating some of the ISGs. reovirus T1L showed higher virulence than T3D in mice. ovirus infection up-regulated the transcription of ISGs, namely IFITM1, ISG15 and Viperin. blockage of the PI3K/Akt pathway in reovirus infection inhibited reovirus replication. reovirus infection did not induce a high production of IFN-. the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in regulating reovirus replication and presumably in pathogenesis. this new finding will help us to better understand the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the general virus-host interactions."}
