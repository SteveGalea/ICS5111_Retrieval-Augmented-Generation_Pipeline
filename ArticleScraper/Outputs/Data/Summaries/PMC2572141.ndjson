{"summary": "influenza viruses encode for up to 11 viral proteins. NS1 has been identified as the main type I IFN antagonistic factor. NS1 inhibits vRNA-mediated induction of the transcription factors. type III IFN comprises IFN1, -2, and -3. all classes of IFN bind to different receptors. the antiviral activity of type I IFN is mediated by a set of IFN-induced genes (ISGs) PKR and the OAS1/RNaseL system are capable of inhibiting cellular and viral translation. the large T-antigen of murine polyomavirus binds to JAK1 and inhibits downstream signaling. the VP24 of Ebola virus (EBOV) binds to karyopherina-1 thereby blocking nuclear accumulation of STAT1. the level of induction of SOCS-3 by HSV-1 seems to determine whether infection turns to acute or persistent progression [31] for HCV it has been suggested that upregulation of SOCS-3 may contribute to the non-responsiveness of HCV patients to IFN therapy [33], [36]\u2013[38]. in A549 cells both virus- and IFN-induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation was markedly reduced. similar patterns were observed upon stimulation of cells with IFN or upon infection with other viruses, such as the human influenza virus A/Victora/3/75 (H3N2). this phenomenon could also be detected in other epithelial cells such as the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (Figure 2E) HEK293 cells were transfected with 500 ng plasmid DNA for expression of viral NP, M, NS, (A) PA, PB1 and PB2 (C) genes. expression of influenza viral proteins was monitored with antibodies against NP, M1, NS1, PA, PB1 or PB2. expression of influenza virus proteins does not result in reduced STAT1 phosphorylation. the inhibitory effect correlated with the accumulation of viral proteins. these proteins are known to bind to vRNA/RNPs or interfere with the RNA-mediated innate immune response. tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are known to mediate dephosphorylation of both, JAKs and STATs. phosphatases could act via an indirect mechanism by dephosphorylation and inactivation of JAKs resulting in an attenuated phosphorylation of STATs. the overall activity of tyrosine phosphatases in infected cells was not elevated compared to uninfected cells. phosphatases do not mediate inhibition of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected cells. phosphatases do not mediate inhibition of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected cells. SOCS-3 mRNA expression Phosphorylation of STATs in the IFN signaling cascade may not only be counter-regulated by phosphatases but also by other cellular factors, such as proteins of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. A549 cells were infected with PR8 (MOI = 5) or stimulated with 100 U/ml human IFN (D) for 3 hours. cDNA was analyzed in quantitative real time PCR to assess mRNA amounts of IFN (B), SOCS-1 (A), SOCS-3 (A, D, F), OAS1 (D) or MxA (D) mediated by IFN Virus mediated SOCS-3 gene induction at early stages of infection. this appeared to occur concomitant with an immediate and strong induction of IFN. this prompted us to analyze whether SOCS-3 transcription might be induced due to an auto- or paracrine action of IFN expressed during infection. RNA from uninfected A549 cells served as a negative control. transfection of RNA from uninfected cells did not result in an increase of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 gene transcription. but transfection of RNA from virally infected cells led to strongly elevated SOCS-3 mRNA amounts. cDNA was analyzed in quantitative real time PCR to assess amounts of SOCS-1 (A), SOCS-3 (A, E, G) and IFN (B, F) mRNA levels. mRNA was normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and calculated as n-fold of untreated cells. induction of SOCS-3 by viral 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA is mediated by auto- or paracrine action of de novo synthesized IFN. cells were stimulated with viral RNA after treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin at two different concentrations. mRNA was still induced to the same extent in presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor. induction of IFN mRNA was monitored as a control. transcription is markedly reduced in IKK2KD expressing cell lines. both, SOCS-3 and IFN mRNA levels were strongly reduced. cDNA was subjected to quantitative real time PCR. mRNA levels of SOCS3 (A, C, E, G) or IFN (B, D, F, H) were assed by specific primers. to further verify that influenza virus induces SOCS-3 via an RNA sensory pathway. induced IL-1b or TNF in the induction of SOCS-3 knock out results in enhanced constitutive STAT1 phosphorylation. this is supported by the observation that neither expression of IL-1b or TNF is significantly induced upon virus infection. we analyzed mouse cells with a targeted deletion of the SOCS-3 gene [56]. total RNA was isolated at different time points p.i. from infected wild type and knock out cells and monitored for induction of SP110, IRF-1 and OAS1. mRNA levels of all three representative ISGs were elevated in SOCS-3 knock out versus wild type cells at almost every time point during the course of infection. supernatants were taken 6 p.i. and used for stimulation of wild type MEF. control wild type MEF were stimulated with 500 U/ml mouse IFN for 15 minutes. cells were harvested and analyzed for the amount of STAT1 and phospho-STAT1. A549 wt cells were transfected with PR8 (MOI = 0.01) (A) or A/Victoria/3/75 (MOI = 0.001) (B) for the indicated times. in (D) the highly susceptible cell line HEK293 was transfected with either pSUPER empty vector or pSUPER-mSOCS-3 for 48 h. in the absence of SOCS-3, infection leads to a stronger activation of STAT1. this leads to enhanced expression of ISGs and reduced virus titers. this highlights the important role of virus induced SOCS-3 to limit the type I IFN-induced antiviral response program. at1 and STAT2 phosphorylation was markedly reduced (Figure 1A) similar patterns were observed upon stimulation of cells with IFN or upon infection with other viruses. this phenomenon could also be detected in other epithelial cells such as the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (Figure 2E) HEK293 cells were transfected with 500 ng plasmid DNA for expression of viral NP, M, NS, (A) PA, PB1 and PB2 (C) genes. the pol II constructs in use also give rise to expression of second reading frames in the NS, M and PB1 genes (NS2, M2, PB1-F2) out of 11 viral proteins of PR8 we choose the nucleoprotein (NP), the NS1 protein, the matrix protein (M1) and the subunits of the viral polymerase, PA, PB1 and PB2. these proteins are known to bind to vRNA/RNPs or interfere with the RNA-mediated innate immune response. expression of none of the viral proteins resulted in a significant decrease of IFN-induced STAT1 or STAT2 phosphorylation tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are known to mediate dephosphorylation of both, JAKs and STATs. infected cells or cells infected with PR8 for 10 h were incubated with increasing amounts of this compound 10 min prior to stimulation with IFN. this time point of infection was chosen because we observed considerable inhibition of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in the course of infection. phosphatases do not mediate inhibition of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected cells. phosphatases do not mediate inhibition of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected cells. SOCS proteins are described to have high affinity for JAK and STAT proteins. they inhibit the transmission of IFN and IFN induced signaling. mRNA levels of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 differed notably in the time course. cDNA was analyzed in quantitative real time PCR to assess mRNA amounts of IFN (B), SOCS-1 (A), SOCS-3, (A, D, F), OAS1 (D) or MxA (D) to detect SOCS-3 protein expression (C) cells were infected for time points indicated or left uninfected. CS-3 transcription might be induced due to an auto- or paracrine action of IFN expressed during infection. as a control we monitored expression of genes that are typically induced by IFN. mRNAs were readily upregulated upon IFN treatment. transfection of RNA from uninfected cells did not result in an increase of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 gene transcription. however, transfection of RNA from virally infected cells led to strongly elevated SOCS-3 mRNA amounts. this dose dependent induction of SOCS-3 by stimulation with increasing amounts of RNA from infected cells corresponds with a gradual decrease in the ability of this RNA to induce STAT1/2 phosphorylation. mRNA was normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and calculated as n-fold of untreated cells, arbitrarily set as 1. In (C) cells were treated as in (A) and (B) and monitored for phospho-STAT1 and phospho-STAT2 band intensities in (C) influenza viral RNA carries a triphosphate group at its 5\u2032 terminus that was previously shown to be a major pathogen pattern that triggers cellular signaling [46] SOCS-3 mRNA was still induced to the same extent in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, providing the ultimate proof that de novo protein synthesis is not required for SOCS-3 induction. this raises the question, which RNA-induced signaling pathways are responsible for SOCS-3 expression. transcription is markedly reduced in IKK2KD expressing cell lines. mRNA levels of SOCS-3 and IFN mRNA levels were strongly reduced. mRNA levels of SOCS3 were assessed for control purposes. the NS1 protein is known to block RNA dependent signaling and NFB activation. infection of cells with the mutant virus resulted in a more pronounced and sustained, albeit delayed induction of SOCS-3. this isogenic wild type strain differs from the PR8 wild type virus used in the other experiments shown here. lysates of these cells were assessed for STAT1 phosphorylation. both cell types showed no phosphorylation of STAT1 in the uninfected state. phosphorylation is due to altered secretion of IFN or other STAT1-activating cytokines. mRNA levels of all three representative ISGs were elevated in SOCS-3 knock out versus wild type cells at almost every time point during the course of infection. this indicates that enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation in infected SOCS-3 deficient cells results in elevated expression of ISGs. wild type MEF and knock out MEF were infected with PR8 (MOI = 5) for the indicated times. efficiency of viral propagation is affected by SOCS-3 expression levels. both wild type and knock out cells were infected with PR8 (Figure 8A) or the strain A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2). HEK293 was transfected with either pSUPER empty vector or pSUPER-mSOCS-3 for 9 h. for (A), (B), (C) and (D) progeny virus titers were determined from supernatants of infected cells by means of plaque assay. NS1 proteins are structurally related polypeptides of 26 kDa (A/NS1) and 32 kDa (B/NS1), which are abundantly expressed in infected cells. this is accomplished through their non-structural NS1 proteins that are structurally related polypeptides of 26 kDa (A/NS1) and 32 kDa (B/NS1). this is accomplished through their non-structural NS1 proteins that are structurally related polypeptid we could not detect any significant gene induction by IFN in A549 cells. instead we observed a significant up-regulation of SOCS-3 by viral 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA. this appears to occur through the RNA-mediated activation of the IKK/NF-B pathway, most likely activated by the RNA sensor RIG-I. IRF-3 is a factor suppressed by the NS1 protein. recently it was reported that IFN-induced gene expression responses are potentiated in cells, which lack the NF-B factors p50 or p65. this mechanism might be cell type dependent since we could not observe similar effects in the cell types used here. the only discrepancy of this work and the study of Pothlichet et al. is that they show a dependence on the type I IFN receptor. this may be due to the different virus-strains and cell types used. at least some influenza A virus strains are able to suppress type I IFN signaling by a mechanism involving NF-B dependent activation of SOCS-3 expression, which negatively affects STAT phosphorylation. this adds a new aspect to our knowledge of strategies used by influenza A virus to antagonize type I IFN responses. human umbilical vein embryonic cells (HUVEC) were grown in endothelial growth medium (EGM, Lonza) for infection, cells were washed and infected with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) dilutions were prepared using infection medium. Sodium vanadate was added to the virus-containing infection medium. cells were stimulated with IFN for 15 minutes. RNAs used as control were mock-treated replacing CIAP by glycerol. different RNA species and analogues were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (L2000) according to manufacturer's instructions.
