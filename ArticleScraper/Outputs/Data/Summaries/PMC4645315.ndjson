{"summary": "IBV is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus, a group of viruses from the order of Nidovirales. it is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis, which can spread to the gastrointestinal or the urogenital tract. despite widespread application of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, infectious bronchitis remains one of the most reported diseases. accessory proteins of coronaviruses play an important role in resistance to the IFN-induced antiviral response. the accessory proteins of coronaviruses are small proteins (50 to 300 amino acids [aa]) that are not essential for virus replication in vitro (21). chicken embryonic kidneys (CEK) were aseptically removed from 17- to 19-day-old chicken embryos. resulting cells were seeded at 4 105 cells/cm2 in a 1:1 mix of medium 199 and F10 medium (Invitrogen) all cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. IBV was amplified on CEK cells and Sindbis virus (SinV) was amplified on BHK cells. all viruses were titrated on the respective cell type on which the experiment was performed. the percentage of nuclei showing translocation of (phospho-)STAT1 in both infected and uninfected cells was calculated based on >500 cells from multiple images. CEK, DF-1, or Vero cells at 100% confluence were pretreated for 6 h with different concentrations of recombinant chicken IFN- or IFN- produced in HEK293 cells (26) l of RNA using the SYBR green one-step kit (Bio-Rad) in a bio-Rad CFX96 PCR apparatus. l of RNA against the nucleocapsid gene of IBV were as previously published. samples were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli loading buffer, clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 5 min, and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. proteins were transferred onto a Whatman Protran nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) by semidry blotting. blotted membranes were blocked overnight in 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. chicken embryonic kidneys (CEK) were aseptically removed from 17- to 19-day-old chicken embryos. a cell suspension was obtained by trypsinization of kidneys for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. all cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. in the 3ab virus, open reading frame (ORF) 3a and all except the final 17 nucleotides of ORF 3b have been deleted (22) the presence of second-site mutations and the absence of protein expression were verified. all viruses were titrated on the respective cell type on which the experiment was performed. cells were imaged using a Zeiss Primo Vert microscope and Axiovision software. the presence of (phospho-)STAT1 in the nucleus was quantified in wells. the percentage of nuclei showing translocation of (phospho-)STAT1 was calculated based on >500 cells from multiple images. reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed on 5 l of RNA using a bio-Rad CFX96 PCR apparatus. the forward primer was GAAGAAAACCAGTCACAC, and the reverse primer was TTACCAGCAACCCACAC. vero cells in 24-well plates at 90% confluence were infected with IBV Beau-R at an MOI of 1. at 18 hpi, cells were stimulated with human IFN- (10,000 U/ml) for 30 min. samples were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli loading buffer, clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 5 min. Chemiluminescence of bound anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody was detected with WesternBright ECL (Advansta) and visualized using Lumni-film (Roche). Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 6.0 or IBM SPSS 19. accessory protein 3a confers resistance to treatment of IBV with type I IFN. primary chicken embryo kidney cells and Vero cells were prestimulated with IFN (1,000 U/ml) for 6 h and subsequently infected with Sindbis virus (SinV) or IBV (Beau-R) at an MOI of 0.1. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and stained for dsRNA (red) or IBV-N (green) titers in non-IFN-treated wells are displayed for each virus. CEK cells were infected with the indicated viruses. at 2 hpi, inoculum was removed and cells were incubated with IFN. accessory proteins of IBV contribute to resistance to IFN. we stimulated CEK cells with a high concentration of IFN. titers of ScAUG3ab more than that of either ScAUG5ab or the parental Beau-R virus. to further investigate IFN sensitivity of ScAUG3ab, we stimulated DF-1 cells with increasing concentrations of IFN- or IFN-. accessory proteins 3a and 3b could play an important role in conferring resistance of IBV to treatment with type I IFN. accessory proteins 3a and 3b contribute to resistance to type I IFN. the proteins interfere with signaling of IFN in a manner similar to that of the accessory protein corresponding to ORF 6 of SARS-CoV. the proteins block IFN signaling through inhibition of nuclear translocation of STAT1. white arrowheads indicate nuclear accumulation of STAT1. black arrowheads indicate absence of STAT1 accumulation in the nucleus. each bar indicates the mean percentage of nuclei showing translocation of STAT1. in noninfected cells, treatment with IFN- led to translocation of STAT1 in more than 90% of the cells. the inhibition seen in IBV-infected cells was time dependent. in noninfected cells, treatment with IFN- led to translocation of STAT1. fected for 12 h or 24 h with IBV and in the last 6 h of infection treated with IFN-. at later time points, IBV strongly inhibited the IFN-mediated production of luciferase. we interpret inhibition of luciferase activity as the result of a reduction in IFN-mediated ISG54 promoter activity. Western blot analysis of noninfected and IBV-infected monolayers. staining was performed using antibodies against STAT1 and Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1. number below the blots indicate the intensities of the bands. in IBV-infected cells, translocation of pSTAT1 was severely reduced. we also observed reduced levels of cytoplasmic pSTAT1 in noninfected cells. a cross section of IBV-infected areas versus noninfected areas confirmed the general lack of pSTAT1 signal. phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of pSTAT1 are inhibited to the same extents by all three viruses. phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of pSTAT1 are inhibited to the same extents by all three viruses. we investigated to which extent ScAUG3ab and ScAUG5ab would inhibit IFN-mediated activation of the ISG54 promoter. the inhibition of phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1 as well as activation of the ISG54 promoter is independent of the accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b. arrowheads indicate absence of accumulation of pSTAT1 in the nucleus. each bar indicates the mean (+SD) percentage of nuclei showing translocation. asterisks indicate significant differences with respect to noninfected cells. firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase. bars indicate means (+SD) of triplicate wells of a representative example of 3 biological replicates. IBV is relatively resistant to treatment with type I IFN. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and stained for dsRNA (red) or IBV-N (green) at an MOI of 0.1. at 2 hpi, cells were washed to remove inoculum, and medium with IFN was added. at 18 hpi, supernatant was sampled and titrated. titers in the supernatant were determined at 18 hpi and are expressed as fold change relative to non-IFN-treated wells infected with the same virus. double asterisks indicate significant differences (P 0.01) between ScAUG3ab virus and other viruses as assessed by a two-way ANOVA. IFN treatment reduced titers of ScAUG3ab more than that of either ScAUG5ab or the parental Beau-R virus. this suggests that the absence of 3a and 3b would increase sensitivity of IBV to IFN treatment. accessory proteins 3a, 3b, or both are responsible for increased IFN sensitivity. we infected DF-1 cells with individual mutants for either accessory protein 3a or 3b (ScAUG3a and ScAUG3b) and infected them with either accessory protein 3a or 3b (ScAUG3a and ScAUG3b) vero cells were infected with IBV and translocation of STAT1 was induced at 6 and 18 hpi. IFN-induced translocation of STAT1 was strongly reduced in IBV-infected cells. white arrowheads indicate nuclear accumulation of STAT1. black arrowheads indicate absence of STAT1 accumulation. the percentage of nuclei showing translocation of STAT1 was determined in noninfected (non-inf.) and in IBV-infected (IBV-inf) cells within IFN-treated wells. each bar indicates the mean percentage of nuclei showing translocation of STAT1. noninfected cells were infected for 12 h or 24 h with IBV. treatment with IFN- led to translocation of STAT1 in more than 90% of the cells. degrees of translocation of STAT1 were comparable between IBV-infected and noninfected cells. IFN-mediated production of luciferase inhibited the transcription of ISGs. IBV inhibited the transcription of ISGs by inhibiting translocation of STAT1. only phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) can associate with STAT2 and IRF9 to form the transcription factor ISGF3. staining was performed using antibodies against STAT1 and Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1. numbers below the blots indicate the intensities of the bands, expressed as fold ratio relative to the IFN-stimulated, noninfected sample. a cross section of IBV-infected areas versus noninfected areas confirmed the general lack of pSTAT1 signal in IBV-infected cells. we found that IBV prevents IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT1. the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV mediates inhibition of STAT1 translocation. nuclear translocation of pSTAT1 was inhibited to the same extents by all three viruses. degrees of nuclear translocation of pSTAT1 in noninfected cells within infected monolayers were comparable between the three viruses. we quantified the percentage of infected cells in microscopic images. IBV accessory proteins are not required for inhibition of STAT1 translocation and ISG promoter activation. western blot analysis of IBV-infected (MOI of 1; 18 hpi) and noninfected vero cells mock treated or treated with IFN- for 30 min. double asterisks indicate significant differences (P 0.01) with respect to noninfected cells. for each virus, at least 500 cells divided over 10 microscopic fields were analyzed. the gammacoronavirus IBV has evolved multiple strategies to antagonize the innate immune response. the coronaviruses MHV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and IBV have all been shown to induce modest and delayed transcription of Ifn (8, 31) we found that propagation of IBV was reduced by 0.5 to 2.5 logs upon pretreatment with IFN (1,000 U) and less than 0.5 log upon IFN posttreatment, suggesting that IBV is relatively resistant to IFN especially, when the infection has already been established. SARS-CoV has been shown to inhibit STAT1 translocation as early as 8 hpi. MHV did not inhibit IFN-mediated translocation of STAT1-GFP at 9 hpi. MHV inhibited IFN-mediated ISG expression at 11 hpi. coronavirus accessory proteins have been shown to antagonize the IFN response at various steps. for example, proteins 4a and 4b of MERS and 3b of SARS inhibit activation of Ifn. accessory proteins also antagonize the antiviral effect of IFN. accessory protein 3a has been shown to colocalize with dsRNA in chicken cells. this could indicate that 3a may prevent the dsRNA-mediated activation of the OAS RNase L pathway. coronaviruses induce extensive remodelling of intracellular membranes. 3a of IBV could stabilize IBV-induced membrane structures. the absence of 3a would then lead to destabilization of the membrane structures. additional research is required to identify how exactly the accessory protein 3a counteracts the type I IFN response."}
