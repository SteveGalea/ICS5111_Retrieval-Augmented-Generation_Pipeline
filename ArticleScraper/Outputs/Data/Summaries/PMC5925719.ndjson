{"summary": "INTRODUCTION Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a wide range of clinical signs in humans, from asymptomatic to acute febrile illness (DF) to severe hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndromes (DHF/DSS) (1). it is a major public health problem in developing tropical countries and has been continuously spreading to new geographical areas (2\u20135) current laboratory methods to aid diagnosis include virus isolation and detection of viral nucleic acid (e.g., reverse transcriptase PCR [RT-PCR]), NS1 antigen, or virus-specific antibodies (e.g., neutralization test, IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [MAC-ELISA], and indirect IgG ELISA) a mobile Pockit PCR laboratory can be easily established with several simple and easy-to-perform field-deployable nucleic acid extraction methods. the reagent set was derived from the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR system reported previously. 10-fold serial dilutions of the DENV stock were made in maintenance medium. each dilution was done in duplicate. each dilution was done in duplicate. 195 archived serum specimens from clinically suspected dengue patients were collected in 2012 for routine diagnosis using RT-PCR methods. 21 of the deNV-negative serum samples were spiked with tissue culture fluids of a DENV strain. 216 samples were tested for comparisons between the Pockit dengue virus reagent set and reference qRT-PCR. the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR system (43) was used as described in the user manual. the default program included an RT step at 50\u00b0C for 10 min and an iiPCR step at 95\u00b0C for about 30 min. the results were shown on the display screen at the end of the program. qRT-PCR RT-iiPCR DENV-1 102 5/5 5/5 DENV-2 5/5 5/5 DENV-1 101 5/5 5/5 DENV-4 5/5 5/5 DENV-1 1 0/5 3/5 DENV-2 5/5 5/5 DENV-1 1 0/5 3/5 DENV-4 5/5 5/5 DENV-1 1 0/5 5/5 DENV-1 1 0/5 3/5 DENV-2 5/5 5/5 DENV-4 5/5 5/5 DENV-1 1 0/5 the target sequences of the Pockit dengue virus reagent set in the 3\u2032 untranslated region were highly conserved among the available sequences of DENV-1, -2, and -3. the interference and reproducibility analysis tests were done with DENV-2 (representing DENV-1, -2, and -3) and DENV-4. the virus was diluted in RPMI medium (Gibco-Life Technologies) containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) and was added to the cell at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. each dilution was done in duplicate. CK9500004 strain was from the Taiwan Center of Disease Control, Taipei, Taiwan. the encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus A, influenza virus B (Yamagata strain), human coronavirus NL-63, enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus A16, herpes simplex virus 1, herpes simplex virus 2, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B virus samples tested were local clinical samples identified nucleic acid extraction was done on a taco mini system (GeneReach Biotech) using a Taco preloaded DNA/RNA extraction kit. 200 l of the sample was added into the first well of the extraction plate. CDC DENV-1\u20134 real-time RT-PCR assay (47) contained 4 sets of oligonucleotide primers and 4 dually labeled 5\u2032 fluorescent TaqMan probes. the reaction was performed with a superScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit without 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine. the target sequences of the Pockit dengue virus reagent set in the 3\u2032 untranslated region were highly conserved among the available sequences of DENV-1, -2, and -3. the interference and reproducibility analysis tests were done with DENV-2 (representing DENV-1, -2, and -3) and DENV-4. each sample was subjected to nucleic acid extraction in triplicate by the taco mini method. nucleic acids were tested with the Pockit dengue virus reagent set. deNV-negative human serum samples spiked with biological concentrations of EDTA, hemoglobin, cholesterol, heparin, bilirubin, or human genomic DNA were tested. deNV-negative samples spiked with four different titers, i.e. moderately positive (10 the limit of detection [LoD] [100% LoD]), low positive (1 LoD), high negative (0.1 LoD), and mock (negative), respectively. DENV-2 and -4 were tested, as the PCR target regions were highly conserved among DENV-1, -2, and -3. the detection rates were all 3/3 for the moderately and low-positive samples. some were 2/3 for the high-negative samples, as expected. a panel of serum samples spiked with DENV to four titers, i.e., negative, high negative, low positive, and moderately positive. the tests were done at three laboratories in Taiwan. a total of 720 tests were performed. 1.9 102 PFU/ml, 4 at 1.9 PFU/ml, and 3 at 0.19 PFU/ml were tested. 121 were positive and 95 were negative by both PCR assays. compared to reference qRT-PCR assay, the Pockit assay had 100% positive agreement. endpoints were 10 and 1 PFU/ml for DENV-1 and 1 PFU/ml for DENV-2 and -3 with both PCR assays. the Pockit assay had detection endpoints with the four serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) and did not react with the 14 viruses. DENV-negative human serum samples spiked with biological concentrations of EDTA, hemoglobin, cholesterol, heparin, bilirubin, or human genomic DNA were tested. the detection rates were all 3/3 for the moderately and low-positive samples, and some were 2/3 for the high-negative samples. two operators tested all samples in triplicate once a day for 5 days at each site. 720 tests were performed, and detection rates were as expected. 195 serum samples collected from dengue-suspected patients in 2012 were tested. 21 DENV-negative human serum samples spiked with different concentrations of a DENV-4 isolate. compared to reference qRT-PCR assay, the Pockit assay had 100% positive agreement. DENV-1\u20134 real-time RT-PCR data are from reference 47. DISCUSSION Good clinical diagnosis and management can improve the recognition of severe dengue warning signs, such as impending intravascular leakages. rapid NS1 antigen test allows early DENV detection at points of care. the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR described previously had excellent analytical sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. the results showed high agreement with the qRT-PCR to detect DENV RNA in serum samples from dengue-suspected patients (100%; CI95%, 98.81% to 100%; = 1; = 1; = 1; n = 216) the taco mini method can greatly reduce hands-on time and minimize inconsistencies in extraction efficiency due to human errors. the combination of the field-deployable taco mini system and the PCR device (Pockit; 31 by 26 by 15 cm [W by D by H]; 2.1 kg) is available in a durable suitcase. mosquitoes can be infected by DENV through a blood meal obtained on a viremic individual. the 50% infectious doses of DENV-2 for female A. aegypti mosquitoes were found at >104 PFU/ml blood meal (56). surveillance of the pathogen in the vector populations has been used to follow virus circulation and/or emergence. serotyping of DENV currently relies on RT-PCR methods. development of RT-iiPCR reagents for DENV serotyping is under way."}
