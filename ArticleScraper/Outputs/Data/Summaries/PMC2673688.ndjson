{"summary": "all influenza type A viruses originate from aquatic birds. successful introduction of these avian viruses into the human population has led to influenza pandemics of historical significance. documented evidence of transmission of avian influenza viruses directly from birds to humans is rare. avian influenza viruses are adapted for replication in the avian enteric tract at 40\u201341\u00b0C. a temperature gradient clearly exists in which the surface temperature of the proximal large airways (i.e., nasal and tracheal) average 32+/0.05\u00b0C. proximal airways likely represent a predominant site for human influenza virus inoculation. avian glycoproteins, HA and neuraminidase (NA) may mediate temperature-dependent effects on viral growth. in vitro, we used an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium. this model closely mimics the morphological and physiological features of the human airway epithelium in vivo. human and avian influenza virus infection of human ciliated airway epithelium at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. we have now compared human and avian influenza virus infection and growth in HAE at temperatures reflective of the proximal airways. infection of HAE by avian, but not human, influenza viruses is restricted at temperatures of the proximal airways. comparison of multi-cycle virus growth in HAE inoculated with either A/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C (closed triangles) or 37\u00b0C (open triangles) and A/Dk/Eng/62 at 32\u00b0C (closed circles) or 37\u00b0C (open circles) both at MOI0.01. a loss of titer was also observed for A/Dk/Eng/62 at 32\u00b0C. a loss of titer was also observed for A/Dk/Eng/62 at 32\u00b0C. AK levels were first detected at 48 hrs pi for a/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. titers of human and avian influenza viruses were not detected 3 hrs pi. levels of antigen in residual viral inocula were below the limit of antibody detection. for A/Victoria/3/75, a few isolated cells were positive for viral antigen by 6 hrs pi at 37\u00b0C, but by 24 hrs pi considerable numbers of antigen-positive cells were detected. A/Victoria/3/75, A/Dk/Eng/62 antigen was detected in only a few cells 24 hrs pi at either temperature. however, an apparently small difference in titer as is seen at 24 hrs pi may correspond to a larger difference in the number of cells positive for viral antigen. avian influenza viruses infect fewer human airway epithelial cells in comparison to human influenza virus at 37\u00b0C. HAE infected with A/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C or A/Dk/Eng/62 at 37\u00b0C all showed desquamation of the superficial layer of columnar epithelial cells by 120 hrs pi. similar cytopathology has been reported for influenza virus infection of HAE in vitro and for clinical human influenza virus infection in vivo. avian influenza virus restriction at 32\u00b0C is independent of avian virus strain. growth of human-derived influenza viruses tested was not significantly different between 32/33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. titers were determined by plaque assay in (A) and (B) and by TCID50 assay for (C) and (D) no significant differences in growth between temperatures were found for either A/Eng/26/99 or A/Udorn/307/72. the avian influenza virus strains used in this study were selected at random, with no selection for a temperature-dependent phenotype. we propose that low temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses, but not human influenza viruses, may be broadly characteristic of avian influenza viruses. the extent of restriction may be variable between different virus strains. avian influenza viruses, but not human influenza viruses, are restricted for infection and growth in HAE at the lower temperature of 32\u00b0C. 'avianization' of human virus polymerase restricts growth in HAE at both 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. the presence of glutamic acid at PB2 627 (avian-like) has been reported to account for lower replication of avian influenza strains in mammalian cells. the PB2 mutant did not show a significant difference in titer between the two temperatures (1.5 logs; Figure 4Ai) the PB2 mutant virus infected a similar percentage of cells compared to wild-type virus at 24 hrs pi. wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 growth curves at 32\u00b0C (closed triangles) and 37\u00b0C (open circles) are repeated in each panel. data represent mean titer across 3\u20138 cultures +/SE. significance is noted (p0.05) where viral titer obtained for the mutant or reassortant virus at 32\u00b0C was statistically different from all other viral titers. avian influenza viruses with avian-like glycoproteins display restricted replication and spread at 32\u00b0C in HAE. a reassortant virus in which the Victoria NA was replaced by that of the avian virus A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 to generate Vic+Chick N1. a 2.5 log decrease in virus growth was determined for the PB2 mutant virus at 32\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C at the 24 hr time point. however, unlike the PB2 mutant virus, the difference between replication at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C was also significant at the 48 hour time point. this mutant virus with avian virus-like sialic acid usage spread less efficiently. the double glycoprotein-altered virus was profoundly restricted at 32\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C. titers for the wild-type virus differed by less than 0.5 logs between temperatures. the level of restriction observed for the double mutant was greater than that observed for either virus containing each of these mutations/substitution individually. avian influenza virus glycoproteins dictate cell tropism and restrict growth of virus in HAE at 32\u00b0C. recombinant viruses contained HA and NA pairs that had not co-evolved. reassorted influenza viruses on a common genetic background, possessing human or avian glycoproteins with co-evolved pairings. ciliated cell tropism of avian influenza viruses dictates by properties of viral glycoproteins. results correlate with increased sialic acid binding preference of avian HA for 2,3-linked SA and to the presence of 2,3-linked SA on ciliated cells in HAE [8],[13],[14]. PR8+Vic HA/NA grew at 37\u00b0C to identical titers as PR8+Vic HA/NA at 32\u00b0C recapitulating our data obtained for wholly human (A/Victoria/3/75) and wholly avian (A/Dk/Eng/62) viruses. PR8+Chick HA/NA generated titers that were >2 logs less than titers obtained for this virus at 37\u00b0C at both 24 and significance is noted (*p0.05) where viral titers or AK levels obtained for PR8+Chick HA/NA at 32\u00b0C were statistically different from all other titers/AK measurements. AK levels obtained for PR8+Chick HA/NA at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C were statistically different. human and avian influenza virus infection of human ciliated airway epithelium at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. we have compared human and avian influenza virus infection and growth in HAE at temperatures reflective of the proximal airways. k/Eng/62 (H4N6) was measured and compared over time. growth kinetics and mean peak titers of A/Victoria/3/75 and A/Dk/Eng/62 reached 2.3108 pfu/ml and 4.7107 pfu/ml respectively, respectively, by 48 hours post-inoculation. data shown represents mean fold change over adenylate kinase activity. significance is noted (*p0.05) where AK levels obtained for A/Dk/Eng/62 at 32\u00b0C were statistically different from all other titers/AK measurements. increasing levels of AK between 48 and 96 hrs pi were directly associated with continually decreasing viral titers. a relationship between the kinetics of virus growth in HAE and the level of CPE also suggested that CPE was a consequence of viral replication. this assertion is supported by the fact that trends in viral titers at a given time point are mirrored in AK levels detected 48 hrs later. en face photomicrographs of HAE inoculated with either A/Victoria/3/75 or A/Dk/Eng/62 at 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C fixed at 6, 24, 48 and 72 hrs pi. scale bar equals 100 m. HAE cultures infected with A/Victoria/3/75 at 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C exhibited loss of integrity of the epithelium. the extent of injury and time of onset varied. cytopathology has been reported for a/Udorn/307/72 influenza virus infection of HAE in vitro. avian influenza virus restriction at 32\u00b0C is independent of avian virus strain. avian influenza virus restriction at 32\u00b0C is independent of avian virus strain. avian influenza virus restriction at 32\u00b0C is independent of avian virus. growth of both human-derived influenza viruses tested, A/Eng/26/99 (H3N2) and A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2), was not significantly different between 32/33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. these two additional human influenza virus strains showed even less difference in titer between temperatures than was determined for A/Victoria/3/75. analysis of growth of avian influenza virus, A/Dk/Sing/97 (H5N3) at 37\u00b0C showed similar growth kinetics to that of A/Eng/26/99 (H3N2), reaching titers of 7105 pfu/ml and 1.6106 pfu/ml, respectively. at 32\u00b0C, A/Dk/Sing/97 (H5N3) failed to grow at all (Figure 3C) titers were significantly decreased at 33\u00b0C vs. 37\u00b0C at 24, 48 and 72 hrs pi. however, only at 37\u00b0C did A/VN/1203/04 approach similar peak titers as the human A/Udorn/307/72 virus by the end of the 72 hr time course. lack of obvious CPE in sharp contrast to A/Udorn/307/72 that obliterated the epithelium by 72 hrs pi the presence of glutamic acid at PB2 627 (avian-like) has been reported to account for the lower replication of avian influenza strains in mammalian cells. we generated a recombinant A/Victoria/3/75 virus containing the PB2 K627E mutation and compared its growth with that of the isogenic wild-type virus in HAE at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. the amino acid residue at PB2 627 influences viral fitness in HAE. it does not confer to a human virus the temperature-dependent phenotype of avian influenza virus infection in human airway epithelium. a one-way ANOVA model showed no significant differences between the wild-type virus and PB2 mutant at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C at 48 hrs pi. we hypothesized that glycoprotein function could be responsible for the restricted infection of avian influenza viruses at the lower temperature of 32\u00b0C. mutations in HA previously shown to switch sialic acid usage from 2,6 to 2,3 linkages were introduced to generate the Vic-226-228HA virus. reassortant virus in which the Victoria NA was replaced by that of the avian virus A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 to generate Vic+Chick N1. replication measured for the wild-type virus was slightly compromised at lower temperature, noticeable at 24 hrs pi. titer decreased at 32\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C at 24 hrs pi. the double glycoprotein-altered virus was still significantly restricted at 72 hrs pi. titers for the wild-type virus differed by less than 0.5 logs. analysis of viral antigen positive cells at 72 hrs by en face staining of infected HAE indicated compromised spread of Victoria (226-228HA)+Chick N1 which was more severe at 32\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C. determination of CPE during these experiments revealed that the double glycoprotein-avianized virus only produced CPE at 72 hrs pi when experiments were performed at 37\u00b0C. wild-type human virus produced CPE earlier and at both temperatures. avianizing the human virus HA by mutation or substitution (in the presence or absence of an avian NA) recapitulated the cell-type tropism exhibited by wholly avian influenza viruses in HAE [13],[14]. we then determined if avianizing the human virus HA by mutation or substitution (in the presence or absence of an avian NA) recapitulated. ining pattern for wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 was identical to that of PR8+Vic HA/NA. arrows mark ciliated cells infected with either wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 or PR8+Vic HA/NA. arrows mark non-ciliated cells infected by these viruses. avian influenza viruses at 32\u00b0C can be mimicked by inserting avian envelope glycoproteins into human influenza viruses. adenylate kinase activity in apical washes of virus-infected HAE expressed as fold-change over adenylate kinase activity in mock-inoculated HAE +/SE. PR8+Chick HA/NA infection at 32\u00b0C did not result in substantial AK release until 96 hr pi. increased AK activity was detected in cultures inoculated with this virus at 37\u00b0C. kinetics of AK induction demonstrated that again, AK was consequential to viral replication. avian and avian influenza viruses are restricted for infection and growth in HAE at 32\u00b0C but not 37\u00b0C, while human viruses infect and grow efficiently at both temperatures. the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways only support efficient and robust infection of the ciliated airway epithelium. a temperature specific effect was found [24],[42] in non-differentiated epithelial cells. a temperature specific effect was found in non-differentiated airway epithelial cells. avian influenza viruses that possessed a lysine at position 627 are restricted for growth at 32\u00b0C. avian-like surface glycoproteins were modestly restricted compared to wild-type viruses at 37\u00b0C. wide-spread infection throughout HAE was even observed for viruses in which their endogenous HA was replaced or mutated to preferentially bind 2,3 SA. recombinant viruses were based on an avian strain that yielded relatively low titers. tion of 2,3 SA-binding viruses in HAE at 32\u00b0C was not due to a discrepancy in SA expression since HAE maintained at either 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C expressed similar levels of 2,6 and 2,3 SA. in conjunction with the HA, the sialidase activity of NA is crucial for successful virus penetration of mucus layers for initial infection and subsequent release of progeny virions from infected cells. this is especially critical both in vivo and in H wild-type avian viruses and human viruses with avian or avian-like glycoproteins eventually reached high titer at 32\u00b0C at later time points. the efficiency of infection and replication of a virus that inoculates the airway epithelium is likely a critical factor in determining whether the virus is capable of establishing infection in a host. the clinical pathology findings for humans infected with H5N1 do report distal airway infection in ciliated bronchioles and lung regions. avian influenza viruses present in the distal airways may still be unable to spread to proximal airway regions without additional adaptation to cooler temperatures. the inability of avian influenza viruses to establish infection and spread in these regions would be predicted to reduce the frequency of successful zoonotic transmission. tracheobronchial epithelial cells isolated from airway specimens from patients without underlying lung disease were provided by the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), Philadelphia, PA. primary cells derived from single patient sources were expanded on plastic to generate passage 1 cells. plated at a density of 3105 cells per well on permeable Transwell-Col (12-mm diameter) supports (Corning, Inc.) mutants in either the wild-type A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/24 (H1N1) background were generated from cloned cDNA in 293T and MDCK cell co-cultures. mutants were generated in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/24 (H1N1) genetic background. the last two reassortant viruses were generated by substituting segment 4 and segment 6 from PR8 with those from either A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 (H7N1) the multi-basic cleavage site in the avian H7 HA gene used in these studies was removed prior to rescue of these recombinant viruses for safety. fluorescence images were obtained using a leica DMIRB inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with cooled-color charge-coupled-device digital camera. the percentage of the epithelium positive for viral antigen as an index of percentage of infected cells was quantified over 5 images per culture. Detection of 2,3 and 2,6 linked sialic acids HAE maintained at either 32\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 72 hrs prior to sialic acid detection were washed, blocked with 3% BSA/PBS++ and probed with biotinylated SNA or MAA lectins. immunohistochemistry HAE fixed in methanolacetone, were probed en face with antibody against viral NP (Chemicon, Inc.; 1100) and jugated goat-anti-mouse IgG2b (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1500) sections prepared with mounting media (EMD Chemicals, Inc.); images captured using a leica DMIRB inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled color charge-coupled-device digital camera (MicroPublisher; Q-Imaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). primary cells derived from single patient sources were expanded on plastic to generate passage 1 cells. plated at a density of 3105 cells per well on permeable Transwell-Col supports. polarized cultures resemble in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium. mutant viruses were generated in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background. last two reassortant viruses were generated by substituting segment 4 and segment 6 from PR8 with those from either A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/Chick/Italy/1347/99. virus inoculum was diluted in PBS and applied to the apical surface of HAE for 2 hrs at either 32\u00b0C, 33\u00b0C, or 37\u00b0C. cultures incubated at 32\u00b0C, 33\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for the duration of the experiment. fluorescence images were obtained using a leica DMIRB inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with cooled-color charge-coupled-device digital camera. percentage of epithelium positive for viral antigen as an index of percentage of infected cells was quantified over 5 images per culture. immunohistochemistry HAE fixed in methanolacetone, was probed en face with antibody against viral NP (Chemicon, Inc.; 1100) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1500), then embedded in paraffin. sections (5 m) were prepared and reprobed for viral antigen using standard immunofluorescence protocols. Statistical analysis Linear mixed models were fitted to repeated measurements of log-transformed viral titer over time that included effects for the four treatment groups (defined by virus and temperature) in a small number of cases, there were only two treatment groups (defined by virus and temperature) and fewer than eight time points."}
