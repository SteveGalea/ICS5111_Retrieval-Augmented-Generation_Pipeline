{"summary": "type I interferon (IFN) system provides first line of host defense against virus infection. the newly synthesized IFN acts upon infected cells and on neighboring uninfected cells. a dynamic equilibrium between virus replication and antiviral action of the immune system is established in an infected animal. a few general principles of the antiviral actions of ISGs have emerged from these studies. a few general principles of the antiviral actions of ISGs have emerged from these studies. recent pathogenesis studies using genetically altered mice have revealed another unexpected feature. sicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and mouse hepatitis virus (11, 16\u201318) are highly susceptible to neuropathy caused by this virus (11) in this model, neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) present in the olfactory bulb of the brain are directly infected in the nasal cavities of mice. in Ifit2/ mice, VSV efficiently spread to neurons in other parts of the brain, causing death within 6 to 7 days after infection. if the LNs are depleted of macrophages, 60% of the infected mice develop ascending paralysis. the wt mice were protected because Ifit2 blocked efficient infection of the sciatic nerve that innervates the LN. wild-type mice were obtained from Taconic Farms. all animal procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. all infections were subcutaneous injections into the left hind-leg footpad. mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital; blood was removed from organs by cardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. tissue or organs were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) popliteal lymph nodes were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight for complete fixation. submerged in 30% sucrose\u2013PBS overnight for cryoprotection. 10-m sections were cut at 18\u00b0C in a leica CM1900 cryostat. modified Eagle medium with Liberase TL (Roche) and DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were then strained into single-cell suspensions with 100-, 70-, and 40-m-pore-size sieves. then 2 106 cells/labeling sample were resuspended in 200 l of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer. compared unlabeled samples (as controls) with marker-labeled samples. results are presented as \"percent cell type marker-positive cells, out of all GFP-positive cells\" IFNAR/ mice (lacking Ifnar1) were a gift from Kaja Murali-Krishna. all animal procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. all infections were subcutaneous injections into the left hind-leg footpad. mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital; blood was removed from organs by cardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. tissues or organs were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. zen in liquid nitrogen, weighed, and pestle/tube homogenized (Kimble/Kontes) in PBS. anesthetized mice were perfused with 10 ml of PBS, followed by perfusion with 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde\u2013PBS for fixation. eight popliteal wt or Ifit2/ lymph nodes were pooled to make single cell suspensions. cells were digested in 2.5 ml of modified Eagle medium with Liberase TL (Roche) and DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were then strained into single-cell suspensions with 100-, 70-, and 40-m-pore-size sieves. FlowJo v9 (Tree Star, Inc.) software was used for analysis of VSV/GFP-positive cells. the results are presented as \"percent cell type marker-positive cells, out of all GFP-positive cells\" we used a previously characterized model of subcutaneous infection with the virus into the footpad of the left hind leg (21). in this model, VSV is captured by the macrophages present in SCS of the popliteal lymph node near the site of infection. IFN acts upon the intranodal neurons to prevent VSV infection of the PNS and the CNS neurons. VSV-infected cells in popliteal LNs were detected microscopically by immunostaining of the viral P protein of wt-VSV or by fluorescence of GFP. the infected cells were all localized to the SCS at the outer rim of the LN. the bottom panels show the localization of active viral gene expression in wt and Ifit2/ popliteal lymph nodes by fluorescence microscopy of VSV-encoded GFP (arrowheads) 14 h after VSV/GFP footpad injection. expression in LN sections of infected wt mice showed that Ifit2 was induced in almost all cells. but IFN secreted by the infected cells induce Ifit2 expression in other cells as well. no Ifit2 was detected in the LN of Ifit2/ mice. mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN-stimulated genes. IFN- protein production in popliteal lymph nodes after VSV infection of wt and Ifit2/ mice, as measured by ELISA. dashed lines indicate the threshold of detection. viremia ensued, and the virus spread into many organs, including the brain, by 1 to 2 days p.i. in wt mice, IFN produced by cells in the LN acts upon cells in the SN to induce Ifit2 at 1 day p.i. there were abundant quantities of virus later after infection. in wt mice, there was little virus in the SN, with exception of a few escapees. VSV-N RNA levels in wt and Ifit2/ sciatic nerves were plotted on log scale. RNA was measured at 8 days after infection by real-time RT-PCR. all VSV RNA levels were plotted on log scale. by 8 days p.i., the majority of the mice were paralyzed. there was no detectable virus in either tissue of wt mice. but there were high virus titers in the SC and brain of Ifit2/ mice. wt mice were strongly infected by a footpad infection model. wt mice showed an increase to ca. 15% of wt mice displaying paralysis. wt mice showed a distribution pattern similar to Ifit2/. we used a previously characterized model of subcutaneous infection with the virus into the footpad of the left hind leg (21) in this model, VSV is captured by the macrophages present in SCS of the popliteal lymph node near the site of infection. the macrophages recruit pDCs to jointly produce type I IFN. IFN acts upon the intranodal neurons to prevent VSV infection of the PNS and the CNS neurons. wt-VSV-infected cells in popliteal LNs were detected microscopically by immunostaining of the viral P protein of wt-VSV (red in the upper panel of Fig. 2A) wt-VSV-infected cells were localized to the SCS at the outer rim of the LN. the top panels show the localization of active viral gene expression in wt and Ifit2/ popliteal lymph node sections 14 h after VSV footpad injection. the bottom panels show the localization of active viral gene expression in wt and Ifit2/ popliteal lymph node sections. mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN-stimulated genes Ifit2 and Ifit1 in lymph nodes of wt and Ifit2/ mice at 14 h after footpad infection. mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN-stimulated genes Ifit2 and Ifit1 in the popliteal lymph nodes of wt, Ifit2/, and IFNAR/ mice at 14 h after footpad infection, measured by real-time RT-PCR. IFN- protein production in popliteal lymph nodes after VSV infection of wt and Ifit2/ mice, as measured by ELISA. dashed lines indicate the threshold of detection. viremia ensued, and the virus spread into many organs, including the brain, by 1 to 2 days p.i. in wt mice, IFN produced by cells in the LN acts upon cells in the SN to induce Ifit2 at 1 day p.i. there were abundant quantities of virus later after infection. in wt mice, there was little virus in the SN, with exception of a few escapees. 2 mRNA (A) and VSV-N RNA (B) levels in popliteal lymph nodes and sciatic nerves of wt, Ifit2/, and IFNAR/ mice. all VSV RNA levels were plotted on log scale. RNA was measured at 8 days after infection by real-time RT-PCR. by 8 days p.i., the majority of the mice were paralyzed. there was no detectable virus in either tissue of wt mice. but there were high virus titers in the SC and brain of Ifit2/ mice. in the current footpad infection model, all rear (caudal) brain regions of paralyzed Ifit2/ mice, including the cerebellum, were strongly infected. by increasing the dose of infection by 35-fold, we observed an increase to ca. 15% of wt mice displaying paralysis. the presence of IFNAR in both hematopoietic and stromal compartments, including the local nerves, is necessary to prevent viral pathogenesis. the presence of IFNAR in both hematopoietic and stromal compartments, including the local nerves, is necessary to prevent viral pathogenesis. the threshold of virus inoculum to which they succumb is lower (21) than that required for pathogenesis in Ifit2/ mice. it remains to be seen whether Ifit2 is also the effector protein against other rhabdoviruses, such as rabies virus, and other unrelated neurotropic viruses. SN of only a very small percentage of mice accumulated virus in their SNs. ifit2 blocked virus entry via the neuronal endings innervating the LN. the long delay between LN replication and the appearance of the virus in the SN could be due to its slow kinetics of transport or the limits of the sensitivity of our assay for viral RNA detection. in wt mice, the virus replicated similarly well in all regions of the brain. in contrast, in wt mice, overall VSV replication was much lower. this indicated that Ifit2 might be preferentially protecting the cerebellum. Ifit1, but not Ifit2, recognizes mRNA 5\u2032-caps that lack 2\u2032-O-methylation of their first ribose and inhibits translation. many viral mRNAs do not contain 2\u2032-O-methylated caps, but are subject to Ifit1-mediated restriction. Ifit2 is not required to protect other tissues from VSV infection. other ISG knockout mice using different routes of VSV infection will be required to further explore the basis of the tissue specificity of ISG actions."}
