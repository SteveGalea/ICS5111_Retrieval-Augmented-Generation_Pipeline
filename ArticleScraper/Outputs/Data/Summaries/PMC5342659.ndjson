{"summary": "HFMD is a febrile exanthematous disease that occurs in children 5 years of age. the clinical signs include vesicles on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, buccal mucosa, tongue, buttocks. in severe cases, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, myocarditis, encephalitis and even death1,2. there are no drugs available for the prevention and treatment of HFMD. a major saponin of this herb, astragaloside, has been shown to possess anti-cancer, anti-fatigue, anti-coxsackie B virus, and anti-inflammatory effects. however, to date, its anti-EV71 activity has not been well investigated. we observed that Rheum emodin protects host cells against EV71 infection. the TCID50 was determined by the Reed-Muench method23. cytopathic effects were observed once per day until the experimental endpoint was reached. cytopathic effect For observing the cytopathic effects, cells were grown on a culture dish and infected by EV71 for 24 h. the morphological changes were observed and microscopic photographs were taken. cells were fixed in 1 mL of cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4 \u00b0C. resuspended in staining buffer (50 g/mL PI [Sigma] and 20 g/mL RNase in PBS) the PI-stained cells were then analyzed using FACS (FACScan; BD) at least 10 000 cells were counted for each sample. membranes were detected with corresponding primary and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. the membranes were then reacted with 5-bromo-4-chloro-39-indolylphosphate (BCIP) and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) substrate (Sigma) the anti-CDK 2 (Boster) and anti-cyclin A2 (Proteintech) mice or rabbit antibodies were prepared in our laboratory amplification was carried out using an ABI Prism 7000 for 40 cycles. the fold changes were calculated relative to GAPDH using the Ct method. between-group differences were assessed using Student's t-test. infection Cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 at an MOI of 1 for 2 h. after 2 h of virus adsorption, cells were washed with PBS once and then fresh culture medium was added. cells were grown on a culture dish and infected by EV71 for 24 h. the morphological changes were observed and microscopic photographs were taken. intracellular virus and total virus were made up to 5 mL with DMEM medium and subjected to repeated freezing and thawing for three cycles. intracellular virus and total virus were obtained by centrifugation at 30 000 rounds per minute for three hours. the intensity of the bands was calculated by ImageJ (NIH ImageJ) the value of the Con/Drug refers to the intensity of the VP1 protein band from the control group/the intensity of the VP1 protein band of the drug treatment group in the supernatant, intracellular and total virus. MRC5 cells were treated with Rheum emodin, Artemisinin, and Astragaloside at various doses to confirm their ability to inhibit cell growth. the lungs can also be infected by the EV71 virus in vivo24. the range of concentrations for Rheum emodin (0 to 82.15 mol/L), Artemisinin (0 to 75 mol/L) and Astragaloside (0 to 85 mol/L) did not affect cell survival. the results indicate the meanSD of one experiment and were representative of three independent experiments. the anti-viral effects of Rheum emodin, Artemisinin or Astragaloside were due to their cytotoxic effects. there were no effects for cell viability or morphology in the infected cells compared with mock-infected cells. Rheum emodin possessed the ability to protect host cells from EV71 viral damage. Artemisinin or Astragaloside were unable to achieve the same results. cell growth was visualized by light microscopy at 22 h. twenty-two hours after treatment with 29.60 mol/L of Rheum emodin, 50 mol/L of Astragaloside or 50 mol/L of Artemisinin, cells were stained with Hoechst 33258. the results were from one experiment and were representative of three independent experiments. the results are standardized using GAPDH RNA as a control and normalized to 100 in control cells. the results indicate the meanSD of one experiment and were representative of three independent experiments. VP1 expression was determined after growth in control medium (\u2013) or drug medium (+) at 26 h and 36 h post-infection.

MRC5 cells were treated with Rheum emodin, Artemisinin, and Astragaloside at various doses to confirm their ability to inhibit cell growth. after 48 h of treatment, the concentrations with inhibitory ratios below 10% ranged from 0 to 82.15 mol/L. the range of concentrations for Rheum emodin (0 to 82.15 mol/L), Artemisinin (0 to 75 mol/L) and Astragaloside (0 to 85 mol/L) did not affect cell survival. MRC5 cells were incubated with 0, 1, 5, 25, 50, 75, or 85 mol/L. the results indicate the meanSD of one experiment and were representative of three independent experiments. 29.6 mol/L of Rheum emodin, 50 mol/L of Artemisinin and 50 mol/L of Astragaloside were chosen based on previous results to treat mock-infected cells for 22 h. Rheum emodin, Artemisinin and Astragaloside inhibited the appearance of condensed and bright nuclei induced by EV71 infection. neither artemisinin nor astragaloside inhibited cell death induced by EV71 infection. MRC5 cells were mock-infected (mock) or infected with EV71 (infected) at an MOI of 1. Twenty-two hours after treatment with 29.60 mol/L of Rheum emodin, 50 mol/L of Astragaloside or 50 mol/L of Artemisinin. intracellular EV71 RNA levels were detected in control medium (Con) or drug-containing medium-treated MRC5 cells by real-time quantitative PCR. results are standardized using GAPDH RNA as a control and normalized to 100 in control cells. Western blotting shows the effects of emodin, artemisinin and astragaloside on EV71 protein expression. VP1 expression was determined after growth in control medium (\u2013) or drug medium (+) at 26 h and 36 h post-infection. infected+con Infected+Rheu Infected+Arte Infected+Astra TCID50/mL 3.16109 2.37102 3.16109 3.16109 Infected, infected EV71; con, control; Rheu, Rheum emodin; Arte, Artemisinin; Astra, astragaloside Table 2. EV71 virus induced cell cycle arrest at S phase to promote viral replication. artemisinin treatment decreased S phase from 54.08%1.24% to 47.65%0.23% (P0.01) after EV71 infection. astragaloside treatment also induced a decrease from 50.74%1.13% to 46.01%1.16% (P0.01) post-EV71 infection. control medium (Con) and 50 mol/L of Artemisinin (Arte) treatment for 22 h (D) control medium (Con) and 50 mol/L of Astragaloside (Astra) treatment for 22 h (F) control medium (Con) and 29.60 mol/L of Rheum emodin treatment (Rheu) for 10 h (E) MRC5 cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 at a MOI of 1 for 2 h. two hours later the cells were treated with drugs that lasted for 34 h. Cyclin A2 and CDK2 expression was detected by Western blot analysis. inflammatory factor released after cell death34,35,36. emodin inhibits cell death caused by EV71 virus infection. this ultimately inhibits the loss of host function and inflammatory occurrence. EV71 induced cell cycle arrest in S phase to facilitate viral production10. but emodin decreased the amount of S phase favored by EV71 to increase the ratio of G0/G1 phase compared with the control treatment. in may be effective against single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that favor S phase. these results further prove our understanding of the EV71 viral pathogenic mechanisms."}
