{"summary": "study was to investigate the relationship between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of SARS-CoV infection and its role in prognosis of patients with lung interstitial fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis. TT genotype, CT and CC were found associated with a protective effect on SARS with ORs(95%CI) of 5.33(1.39\u201320.45) femoral head necrosis with OR(95%CI) of 6.42(1.53\u201326.88) and adjusted OR was 8.40(95%CI 1.76\u201340.02) in cured SARS patients compared to CC genotypes. but these SNPs may not affect interstitial lung fibrosis in cured SARS patients. a number of studies had shown that the TNF- promoter polymorphism had a significant effect on its transcriptional activity [6,7]. a number of studies had shown that the TNF- promoter polymorphism had a significant effect on its transcriptional activity. cytokines involved in pathogenesis of lung fibrosis have been found to over-expressed in regenerated type II pneumocytes in human lung. cytokines have been found to over-expressed in regenerated type II pneumocytes in human lung. femoral head necrosis was also observed in this population. 66 individuals had no contact history with SARS patients. 55 could be classified into severe and light SARS. this population also had the history of hormone therapy. genemic DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction Leucocytes were isolated within 12 h of blood collection using Percoll reagent. PCRs contained 5 l(6.7 M) forward primer 5'-GATGGACTCACCAGGTGAG-3', 5 l(6.7 M) reverse primer 5'-CTCATGGTGTCCTTTCCAGG-3'. a thermal cycler sequenced the fragments in double directions using forward primer 5'-GATGGACTCACCAGGTGAG-3' and reverse primer 5'-CTCATGGTGTCCTTTCCAGG-3. the heterozygote genotype of each SNP site manifested as a single peak. methylprednisolone, deltadehydrocortisone and dexamethasone dosage were calculated into methylprednisolone using the following equation: 4 mg methylprednisolone = 5 mg deltadehydrocortisone = 0.75 mg dexamethasone. patients with interstitial lung fibrosis were diagnosed by respiratory experts. PCRs contained 5 l(6.7 M) forward primer 5'-GATGGACTCACCAGGTGAG-3', 5 l(6.7 M) reverse primer 5'-CTCATGGTGTCCTTTCCAGG-3', 5 l buffer [150 mm (NH4)2SO4, 500 mM Tris-Cl(pH = 8.8), 500 M EDTA-Na2,15 mM MgCl2,100 mM -Mercaptoethanol], total of 75 SARS patients, 41 health care workers and 66 individuals were included in this study. all the populations were Chinese Han ethnic. the mean age was 35.0 years for SARS, 35.7 for health care workers and 30.1 for individual controls. the CT genotype was less frequent in SARS group when compared with individual controls at the -204 locus (X2 = 4.20, P = 0.04) the genotype was associated with a protective effect on SARS with OR(95%CI) of 0.95(0.90\u20130.99) (Table 2).
