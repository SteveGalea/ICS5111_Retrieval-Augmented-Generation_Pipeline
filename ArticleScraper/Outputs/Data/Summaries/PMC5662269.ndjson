{"summary": "the genus Ebola virus (Ebolavirus) is a member of the Filoviridae family. it is characterized by a severe course, general intoxication, and a high mortality rate reaching 90%. the genus is a member of the Filoviridae family. a specific heterologous (horse) immunoglobulin against Ebola fever was developed at the Virology Center of the Research Institute of the Russian Defense Ministry. the immunoglobulin had 100% protective activity in experiments with monkeys. after 2 years, several vaccines had been developed. the breakthrough came in 1995, when an article by V.E. Volchkov et al. was published. it was shown that RNA editing by viral polymerase resulted in several GP forms. of which only 20% were the full-length envelope antigen GP [12], the same study found that GP expressed in eukaryotic cells undergoes extensive glycosylation. cellular immunity plays a key role in the formation of protective immunity to the Ebola virus. directed depletion of CD8+ cells in monkeys immunized against EVD caused a decrease in vaccinated protective immunity. 80% of the animals died despite the high titers of common IgGs and NtAbs in peripheral blood serum. phase 3 clinical trials of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine have now been completed. vaccines encoding GP of the Zaire (1995 Kikwit) and Sudan Ebola virus have demonstrated efficacy in a series of preclinical trials in primates. the vaccine induced a high level of GP-specific antibodies associated with protection in primate studies. 575.5 (6 months) 6,110 (Day 28 after boosting) 674.1 (12 months after boosting) High: 1,305.7 (Day 28) 197.9 (6 months) 11,825 (Day 28 after boosting) 856.8 (12 months after boosting) Pain at the injection site [41] ChAd3 Low (2 1010 vp) High (2 1011 vp) EBOV: SUDV: 18,474 (Day 21) Pain at the injection site [41] ChA group 3 (5 1010 vp) Group 4 (1 1011 vp) Boosting: MVA 2 108 vp EBOV; SUDV; MARV; TAFV GMT: Priming Group 1: 295.0 (Day 28) Group 2: 204.6 (Day 28) Group 3: 555.8 (Day 28) Group 4: 1,493.6 (Day 28) Boosting: 9,279.6 (Day 28) Pain at the injection site [39] rVSV Site DNA Priming: Group (4.0 mg) EBOV; SUDV; MARV GMT: Group: 31.0 (Day 28) Pain at the injection site [46] VSV+Ad5 Group 1: Priming VSV 1.25 107 PFU Boosting Ad 1.25 1011 vp Group 2: Priming VSV 2.5 107 PFU Boosting Ad 2.5 1011 vp EBOV Group 1: 33.51 (Day 21) 343.1 (Day 28) 2,540 (Day the presence of Ad5 antibodies before vaccination was shown to lead to the induction of a lower GP-specific humoral and T-cell response after vaccination. however, clinical trials in china demonstrated that the use of a high dose of an Ad5-based vaccine may reduce the negative effect of pre-existing immunity on the formation of a GP-specific immune response. heterologous vaccination with an Ad3 (Ad3 + Ad3)-based vector results in 100% short-term protection (5 weeks), but with this vaccination regimen, protection decreased to 33% in 8 months. heterologous vaccination enabled a amplification of both the humoral and cellular immune responses. recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GP) and human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad-GP) were tested in primates. no serious adverse events (AEs) occurred during the vaccine safety study. the EVD vaccine developed and produced at the Gamaleya Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology was licensed in the Russian Federation in 2015. this indicates that the use of heterologous vaccination neutralizes the negative effect of pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5-based vaccine vectors. a timely drive against global threats to public health is possible only if the efforts of political leaders, WHO experts, and key pharmaceutical players are consolidated. the combined work of experts from different fields enabled the fast introduction of novel advanced vaccines into practical medicine."}
