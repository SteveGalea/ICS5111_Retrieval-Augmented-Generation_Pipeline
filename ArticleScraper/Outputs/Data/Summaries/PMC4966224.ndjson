{"summary": "MERS is a disease of the lower respiratory tract and is characterized by high mortality. majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia. human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles associated with disease. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using STATA 12.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) differences in the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 allele frequencies between two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test separately for all alleles and P 0.05 was considered statistically significant, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. ds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using 2 2 tables. most patients were male and old with very high mortality. HLA-DRB1*11:01 carried a significant association with severe MERS in this Saudi cohort. these alleles are common in the Korean population[9] where the second biggest outbreak of MERS infection occurred. conflicting results on HLA association were reported in SARS infection; a closely related emerging corona virus."}
