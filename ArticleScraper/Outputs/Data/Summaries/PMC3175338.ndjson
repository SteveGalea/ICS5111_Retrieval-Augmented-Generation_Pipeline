{"summary": "1, 2 The ongoing discovery of new respiratory viruses continues to provide detailed information on potential pathogens to clinicians. one study of viral coinfection using standard culture methods and serological and molecular detection methods determined increased rates of hospitalizations in children with dual respiratory virus infections. the impact of multiple viruses on the severity of clinical illness is unclear. laboratory data collection Samples were stored at 70\u00b0C until evaluated using quantitative realtime PCR for adenovirus (AdV) DNA and reversetranscription PCR for the following RNA viruses. quantitative assays were compared with standard curves generated by the amplification of known numbers of DNA plasmids. the study was approved by the Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital Institutional Review Board. Statistical analyses Quantitative variables were described using mean or median. differences in means were tested using twosided t tests. quantitative PCR results were expressed as RNA or DNA copies per ml of original sample. negative results were not due to poor extraction or inhibition of the PCR assay. ICD9 discharge and admission codes were grouped using the complex chronic condition categories previously described by Feudtner et al. 21. multivariate linear regression (for continuous outcomes) and logistic regression (for binary outcomes) were used to compare clinical correlates of disease severity between children with single virus illnesses. at least one virus was detected from 566 children (63% of study population). at least one virus was detected from 566 children (63% of study population). the majority of children with multiple virus illnesses were admitted to an inpatient, nonICU ward (n = 64; 62%), followed by 37 children (36%) who were evaluated and discharged from the emergency room. multiple viruses were more common in children aged 6\u201324 months (n = 58/301, 27%) compared with children aged 0\u20136 months of age (n = 18/257, 11%; P 0001) in a subanalysis of children with underlying chronic conditions, PIV3 viral quantity was significantly lower in multiple virus illnesses than in single virus illnesses. aCoV quantitation available for subtypes 229E and OC43 (n = 15) only. fected children were consistent among all three age groups evaluated. average respiratory rate in single virus illnesses increased by 16 breaths per minute compared with children with multiple virus illnesses. no differences were observed when comparing rates of antibiotic use, fever above 38\u00b0C, or abnormal radiographic findings. antibiotics used 403 (45) 201 (44) 42 (41) 089 (058, 138; 061) 088 (056, 137; 057) Bronchodilators used 416 (47) 60 (59) 232 (50) 144 (093, 223; 010) 131 (082, 208; 024) Abnormal radiographic finding*** 202 (39) 113 (42) 22 (40) 090 (050, 163; 073) 087 (047, 161 older children (6\u201323 months) may be more likely to have had previous exposures to these respiratory viruses in an earlier season. increased severity 22 and increased immune response during a primary infection may discourage colonization by a second viral pathogen, leading to lowered prevalence of multiple viruses in this youngest group. several studies have reported no association between respiratory illness severity and multiple virus detections. an immune response to an infection with the first virus could modify the disease severity of a subsequently acquired virus, potentially by the induction of interferon and other antiviral response modifiers. multiple virus combinations of RSV, hMPV, PIV, Flu A, and AdV were more common in children 6\u201324 months of age. more severe illness severity was observed among multiple virus illnesses. we hypothesize viral load may serve as an important clue as to which virus in a mixed infection may have a greater influence on the clinical severity.
