{"summary": "RNA from each was prepared for next-generation sequencing. transcripts were annotated and relative abundance was calculated. major changes in transcript abundance occurred in response to infection with either PRRSV strain, each with over 630 differentially expressed transcripts. cine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide [1] as a result of both reproductive failure (late-term abortions and stillbirths) in pregnant sows and respiratory disease (pneumonia) in nursery and grower/finishing pigs. unknown agent in the PRRSV preparations that increased the severity of the clinical disease over what was expected for a \u201croutine\u201d PRRSV infection. PHFD was reproduced in china with virus derived from an infectious clone of the 2006 JXwn06 HP-PRRSV isolate [19] from which infectious virus (rJXwn06) was rescued. transcripts were found to be significant hits in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library and 633 were significant in the US PRRSV VR-2332 library. of those 632 significant hits within the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library 55 hits were up-regulated and 69 were down-regulated more than 3-fold. 568 of the 632 gene IDs mapped to the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. 165 were up-regulated while 148 were down-regulated. in the TBLN of control vs. VR-2332-infected pigs, 528 of the 633 gene IDs were up-regulated. three members of the S100 family (S100A9, S100A8, S100A12) of calcium-binding proteins localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells. involved in regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) a generator of reactive oxygen species and possible cause of hypoxia-mediated lung injury [26] top ten down-regulated transcripts included genes without projected HGNC symbols. CES1 liver carboxylesterase (ENSSSCG00000002825) and F1STY2_PIG thyroid hormone-responsive protein (ENSSSCG00000014888). wn06 US PRRSV VR-2332 Named gene Fold change (log2) SAA4 9.07171 SAA4 4.15255 RETN 6.89887 S100A9 6.41344 XDH 5.97329 S100A8 5.75953 ENSSSCG00000013369 5.72684 S100A12 5.37987 IL1R2 4.571 PADI4 4.48918 ENSSSCG00000001617 4.43141 DGAT2 granzyme A signalling, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells, IL-10 signalling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, IL-12 signalling and production in macrophages, complement system, interferon signalling, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, IL-17A signalling in fibroblasts, granzyme B signalling, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages, granzyme B the down-regulated network functions in the VR-2332 infected TBLN were associated with cellular function, maintenance, development and organization. the down-regulated network functions in the VR-2332 infected TBLN were associated with cellular function, maintenance, development and organization. tide Alignment Program (GSNAP) was used for alignment and genome construction. the RNASeq yielded 55,527,464 reads for the control. 43,263,207 reads for the HP-PRRSV, and 34,555,783 for VR-2332 libraries. gene annotation of all significant hits was carried out using a MySQL database matching the Ensmbl (Sscrofa9.56) chromosome location of aligned transcripts to gene names. gene IDs and log2 fold-change expression values for significant hits were then analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. in the TBLN of control vs. VR-2332-infected pigs, 568 of the 632 gene IDs mapped to the Ingenu gene ENSSSCG00000013369 F1S9C0_PIG serum amyloid protein (no HGNC annotation) down-regulated in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 TBLN vs. control were resistin (RETN) which is secreted by immune and epithelial cells and participates in the immune response by increasing transcriptional events. triglyceride synthesis is critical for formation of adipose tissue [28]. soluble galactose-binding lectin 12 (LGALS12), cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC), tumor suppressor candidate 5 (TUSC5), protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 1A (PPP1R1A), C-type lectin domain family 4 (C-type phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B also known as dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (PPP1R1B); potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 4 (KCNQ4) that is thought to play a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability; plexin domain containing 1 (PLXDC1); and adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1). the top functions identified with the Ingenuity Canonical Pathway list were: granzyme A signalling, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells. IL-10 signalling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, IL-12 signalling and production in macrophages, complement system, interferon signalling, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, granzyme B signalling, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages many up-regulated networks related to cell death and inflammatory response functions fit with the previously reported results [17,29] where HP-PRRSV strain rJXwn06 caused severe disease, resulted in up to 100X higher abundance of virus and produced an exacerbated release of cytokines. the down-regulated networks in the VR-2332 infected TBLN were associated with cellular function, maintenance, development and organization. transcriptional profiles of TBLNs from non-infected, HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and US PRRSV VR-2332-infected pigs provide insight into immune dysregulation elicited by the virus on host transcript abundance levels necessary for a effective immune response. at 13 dpi HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 inoculated pigs had an interstitial pneumonia that was significantly more severe than theVR-2332 inoculated group. new virulence mechanisms of PRRSV may improve the prospects for rational design of more effective vaccines to limit viral replication and shedding. pigs were also confirmed negative for porcine circovirus type 2 by quantitative real-time PCR. group 1 consisted of negative control pigs, which received an intranasal 2 ml sham inoculum of minimum essential media on 0 dpi. group 3 consisted of nave pigs (N = 8) that were placed in contact with group 2 swine on 2 dpi. al lymph nodes from in vivo HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 (N = 8), US PRRSV VR-2332 (N = 7), or sham-infected pigs (N = 8) harvested at 13 days post-infection. total cellular RNA was prepared as follows. integrity of the RNA was confirmed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 nano-chip. three files of transcriptome data from sham, HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and US PRRSV VR-2332 inoculated groups were aligned to the UCSC pig genome build using the GSNAP alignment program. the next step in the pipeline was to put the GSNAP output into the Cufflinks program and run it through three separate utilities or tools within the software package. differentially expressed genes were mapped to genetic networks available in the Ingenuity database and then ranked by score. IPA Tool gives the significance value of the differentially expressed genes, the other genes with which it interacts, and how the products of the genes directly or indirectly act on each other. cross-bred pigs were obtained from a u.s. high-health herd. they were free of PRRSV and influenza virus antibodies. pigs were also confirmed negative for porcine circovirus type 2. tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) from in vivo HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 (N = 8), US PRRSV VR-2332 (N = 7), or sham-infected pigs (N = 8) were harvested at 13 days post-infection. the integrity of the RNA was confirmed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano-chip. three files of transcriptome data from sham, HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and US PRRSV VR-2332 inoculated groups were aligned to the UCSC pig genome build using the GSNAP alignment program. the next step in the pipeline was to put the GSNAP output into the Cufflinks program and run it through three separate utilities or tools. the q-value was the false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p RNAseq analysis pipeline comprised of GSNAP for alignment and Cufflinks to determine if differential expression, and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant. IPA datasets representing genes with altered expression profile derived from RNAseq analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool. gene annotation was carried out using a MySQL database matching to the Ensembl Sscrofa9.56 reference genome. gene annotation was carried out using a MySQL database matching to the Ensembl Sscrofa9.56 reference genome currently supported by the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute) mention of trade names or commercial products in this article is solely for the purpose of providing specific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture."}
