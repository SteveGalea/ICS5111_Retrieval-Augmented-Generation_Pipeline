{"summary": "federal systems of government offer many advantages, including allowing for the distinctiveness of the regions within a nation to be recognized and for region-specific policy approaches to be developed. this characteristic of federal systems poses a dilemma when international treaties are signed by a federal government. the cooperation of regional governments (states, provinces, etc.) is necessary for compliance with the treaty. the new IHR requires all states parties to designate representatives to implement the surveillance, response, and notification requirements of the regulations. a decision-making instrument to assist in the identification of such events is included in the regulations. the changes formally empower the WHO to issue temporary and standing recommendations if an outbreak is classified as a public health emergency of international concern. these could include recommendations to issue travel restrictions for persons from affected areas. the realities of federations, and the fragmentation of powers within them, could become particularly problematic when attempting to operationalize the new IHR. there are several reasons why regional governments may not want to provide complete information on the nature of an outbreak. failure to report could have significant consequences, most importantly the delay of national and international responses to prevent the spread of the disease. the resistance of regional governments to sharing of information could leave a country susceptible to measures introduced by the WHO. two key federations, the us and australia, have not ratified the treaty. the problems federations have with compliance with international treaties can occur at several levels. the problems federations have with compliance with international treaties can occur at several levels. acrimony to which federations are susceptible would clearly not be acceptable if, at a time of crisis, it produced a dysfunctional response that resulted in the international spread of disease. the WHO, in turn, must make efforts to assist federations in this regard. the size and power of several federations in the world health organization require that the particular nuances of their governance structure be acknowledged and respected. failure to do so could threaten the long-term support of the IHR by key federations, such as the united states, India, and Russia."}
