{"summary": "the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. results Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission. the longer a nosocomial pathogen persists on a surface, the longer it may be a source of transmission and thus endanger a susceptible patient or healthcare worker. the literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine on the internet homepage of the national library of medicine without language restrictions. the search was done on 29 December 2005 and covered all years available in MedLine. citations in each study found during the main search were reviewed for potential relevance. standard textbooks on infection control, bacteriology and virology were examined for information. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of inanimate surface were included. mycobacteria \u2013 including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile \u2013 can also survive for many months on surfaces. spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for many months on surfaces. Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 \u2013 3 days [24, 27, 90] Proteus vulgaris 1 \u2013 2 days [90] Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 hours \u2013 16 months. only Staphylococcus aureus was found to persist longer at low humidity. longer persistence has been described with higher inocula [28], in the presence of protein [13], serum [13,24], sputum [30], or without dust [10]. Persistence of fungi Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. the influence of humidity on persistence has been described inconsistently. for entero- [32] and rhinovirus [33], high humidity was associated with longer persistence. adeno- [32,34], rota- [36,37], and poliovirus [34,35], conflicting results were reported. many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp. can survive on inanimate surfaces even for months. spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for many months on surfaces. Enterococcus spp. including VRE and VSE 5 days \u2013 4 months [9, 26, 28, 100, 101] Haemophilus influenzae 12 days [90] Helicobacter pylori 90 minutes [23] Klebsiella spp. 2 hours to > 30 months [12, 16, 28, 52, 90] Listeria spp. 1 day \u2013 months [15, 90, 102] Mycobacterium bovis > 2 months [13, 90] My only Staphylococcus aureus was found to persist longer at low humidity. low temperatures, e.g., 4\u00b0C or 6\u00b0C, also improved persistence of most types of bacteria. fungi Candida albicans as most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. the presence of serum or albumin, a low temperature, and high humidity have been described as leading to longer persistence. astrovirus, coxsackie-, influenzavirus, polio- and rotavirus can persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. a high inoculum of the nosocomial pathogen in a cold room with high relative humidity will have the best chance for long persistence. some studies have also identified factors influencing persistence. a low temperature, such as 4\u00b0C or 6\u00b0C, was associated with longer persistence for most bacteria, fungi, and viruses. transmission to hands was most successful with Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus (all 100%) [52], Candida albicans (90%) [53], rhino virus (61%) [54], HAV (22% \u2013 33%) [55], and rota virus (16%) [56,57] Contaminated hands can transfer viruses to 5 more surfaces [58] or 14 other subjects. our review supports current guidelines which recommend a disinfection of surfaces in specific patient-care areas in order to reduce the risk of transmission of nosocomial pathogens from inanimate surfaces to susceptible patients. most nosocomial pathogens can persist on inanimate surfaces for weeks or even months. 113] SARS associated virus 72 \u2013 96 hours [114] Coxsackie virus > 2 weeks [34, 111] Cytomegalovirus 8 hours [115] Echovirus 7 days [39] HAV 2 hours \u2013 60 days [35, 38, 41] HBV > 1 week [116] HIV > 7 days [117\u2013119] Influenza virus 1 \u2013 2 days [39, 43, 121, 120] Influenza virus 1 \u2013 2 days [42, 45]"}
