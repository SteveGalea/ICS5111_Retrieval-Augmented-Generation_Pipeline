{"summary": "pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor. it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in the united states. despite developments in the detection and management of PDAC, the five-year relative survival rate has not improved. enin signaling plays a pivotal role in maintaining cell stemness and crosstalk with the PI3K/AKT pathway. miR-27a is highly expressed in numerous types of cancers, including breast and ovarian cancers. but the role of miR-27a/FOXO1 in PDAC remains unknown. expression levels of FOXO1 were categorized as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d as follows: score 0-1, low expression; 2-3, high expression. all cells were maintained under standard culture conditions in culture medium recommended by the ATCC. western blotting Tissues and cells were lysed in WB/IP lysis buffer (P0013; Beyotime) nuclear proteins were extracted using lysis buffer (P0028; Beyotime) the cells were boiled in 5 loading buffer for 10 min, resolved by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 105 cells/well in 100 l culture medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. cells were washed twice with 1 PBS, resuspended, and fixed in 2 ml of 70% ethanol at -20\u00b0C. cells were stained with propidium iodide (BD) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. tumor size was measured once a week. cells (3 106/mouse) were injected into the livers of nude mice. cells were permeabilized in 0.3% triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) statistical analysis Data are expressed as the mean standard deviation. the final expression levels of FOXO1 were categorized as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d as follows: score 0-1, low expression; 2-3, high expression. all cells were maintained under standard culture conditions in culture medium recommended by the ATCC. western blotting Tissues and cells were lysed in WB/IP lysis buffer (P0013; Beyotime) the cells were boiled in 5 loading buffer for 10 min, resolved by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 105 cells/well in 100 l culture medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. cells were washed twice with 1 PBS, resuspended, and fixed in 2 ml of 70% ethanol at -20\u00b0C. cells were stained with propidium iodide (BD) tumor size was measured once a week. cells (3 106/mouse) were injected into the livers of nude mice. cells were permeabilized in 0.3% triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. results FOXO1 is downregulated in PDAC tissues and low FOXO1 expression correlate with clinical outcome. FOXO1 is downregulated and predicts poor patient prognosis in patients with PDAC. ectopic expression of FOXO1 significantly inhibited cell viability. FOXO1 overexpression impaired tumor formation in vivo. the expression of FOXO1 was negatively correlated with that of PCNA. ectopic expression of FOXO1 inhibits PDAC cell proliferation and growth. CCND1 expression significantly inhibited CCND1 but not CCNE1 expression in PDAC cell lines. CCND1 protein levels were decreased in the FOXO1-expressing BxPC3 and PANC1 stable cell lines. CCND1 expression was negatively correlated with FOXO1 expression. CCND1 expression is negatively correlated with FOXO1 expression in fresh PDAC tissues. CCND1 mRNA level is negatively correlated with FOXO1 expression in fresh PDAC tissues. CCND1 was negatively correlated with the expression of FOXO1. the findings suggest that FOXO1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion through Wnt/-catenin signaling. ectopic expression of -catenin partly rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation resulting from ectopic expression. overexpression of -catenin signaling rescues cell proliferation and invasion under FOXO1 ectopic expression in BxPC3 cells. overexpression of -catenin rescues the inhibition of cell invasion resulting from ectopic FOXO1 expression in BxPC3 (B) and PANC1 (C) cell lines. miR-27a overexpression substantially suppressed the activity of the reporter carrying the wild-type 3\u2019-UTR of FOXO1 but not that of the reporter carrying the mutant 3\u2019-UTR. luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-27a specifically targets FOXO1 in BxPC3 and PANC1 cells. inhibition of miR-27a inhibits BxPC3 (H) cell proliferation. miR-27a predicts poor prognosis in PDAC patients. ectopic expression of FOXO1 significantly inhibited cell viability in both BxPC3 and PANC1 cell lines. ectopic expression of FOXO1 significantly inhibited cell viability. downregulation of FOXO1 was correlated with PCNA, a well-accepted cell proliferation marker. ectopic expression of FOXO1 inhibited the invasion ability of BxPC3 and PANC1 cells. FOXO1 overexpression remarkably inhibited cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to S. therefore, we examined the expression of CCND1 and CCNE1. CCND1 protein levels were decreased in the FOXO1-expressing BxPC3 and PANC1 stable cell lines. CCND1 mRNA level of MYC in FOXO1-overexpressing BxPC3 and PANC1 stable cell lines. overexpression of FOXO1 inhibits Wnt/-catenin signaling activity in BxPC3 and PANC1 cells. elevated FOXO1 expression significantly inhibited Wnt/-catenin signaling activity. overexpression resulted in a robust decrease in nuclear -catenin. ectopic expression of -catenin rescues cell proliferation and invasion. -catenin rescues the expression of EMT markers under ectopic FOXO1 expression in BxPC3 (B) and PANC1 (C) cell lines. DNA methylation and microRNAs can drive tumor suppressor inhibition in cancer development. we found no CpG islands in the FOXO1 promoter region. miR-27a inhibitor significantly inhibited BxPC3 cell proliferation and PANC1 cell invasion. high miR-27a expression predicted dismal prognosis in PDAC patients. mRNA level is negatively correlated with miR-27a expression. despite efforts put in treating PDAC, clinical outcomes remain poor. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms from multiple perspectives is highly desirable. enin, a transcription factor activated by Wnt/-catenin signaling, decreased when FOXO1 was ectopically expressed. we found that elevated FOXO1 could promote -catenin entry into the nucleus to regulate CCND1 expression and thus promote cell proliferation."}
