{"summary": "virulence genes espP, irp, and fyuA were more common in resistant E. coli than in fully susceptible isolates. the virulence gene terZ was associated with calf diarrhea (P 0.01) enteropathogenic E. coli seems to be an uncommon cause of neonatal calf diarrhea in Swedish dairy herds. in practice, calf diarrhea should be regarded holistically in a context of infectious agents, calf immunity, management practices etc. enteric E. coli from healthy animals is therefore recommended as indicators for prevalence of resistance in animal populations [7,12-14] the role of enteropathogenic E. coli in NCD is only fragmentarily known [7,12-14] 6 and 3 diarrhoeic calves, out of 20 most recently born, should be sampled. case/control pairs should comprise calves of equal age. calves should not have been treated with antimicrobials within two weeks prior to sampling. all 25 selected E. coli isolates from each sample were phenotyped by biochemical fingerprinting. one isolate representing dominant phenotype was selected for testing of antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence genes. the quality control strain, E. coli ATCC 25922, tested in parallel with each batch of isolates, was on all occasions within acceptable ranges. the tested antimicrobials are, or have been, licensed for use in cattle in Sweden. MICs equal to or lower than the lowest concentration tested are given as the lowest tested concentration. MICs above the range of concentrations tested are given as the lowest tested concentration. MICs above the range of concentrations tested are given as the concentration closest to the range. a subset of isolates were tested for an additional 30 virulence genes (VT1, VT2, eae, beta, gamma, alpha, alpha, alpha, kappa, alpha, kappa, alpha, kappa, alpha, kappa, epsilon, fimA, fimB, fimC, fimH, fimE, fliC, katP, ter a multivariable model was constructed using manual stepwise backward logistic-regression analysis. variables with many missing values (> 20% missing observations) were not used in the multivariable analysis. potential confounders and intervening factors were considered in every model. case/control pairs should comprise calves of equal age. calves should not have been treated with antimicrobials within two weeks. calf age, breed and gender, calf management, age at weaning, feeding and rearing systems. all 25 selected E. coli isolates from each sample were phenotyped by biochemical fingerprinting. one isolate representing the dominant phenotype in each sample was selected for testing of antimicrobial susceptibility. the quality control strain, E. coli ATCC 25922, tested in parallel with each batch of isolates, was within acceptable ranges. the tested antimicrobials are, or have been, licensed for use in cattle in Sweden.

from their dam 24 h after birth (n = 48), 1-3 days after birth (n = 23) or after > 3 days (n = 21). only 9% of all participating calves had respiratory symptoms. none of the CD- calves had an affected

42%, 37.5%, 35%, 25% and 22% of the isolates. 87.5% of the isolates eae, espB, etpD, F41, hlyA, STa, STb, terE, terC, VT1, VT2e were absent multiresistance, including resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and sulphonamide, was more common (P 0.01) among isolates from CD+ calves. there was no significant association between antimicrobial resistance of the isolates and herd routines for use of antimicrobials. a calf in a larger herd (120 cows) was a CD+ calf than a calf in a smaller herd (120 cows) there was a higher risk that a calf in a larger herd was a CD+ calf than a calf in a smaller herd (120 cows), and that CD+ calves more often had E. coli isolates resistant to tetracycline. the only variable remaining with a P-value 0.05 in the model was herd size. the

terZ, terW, espP, irp, fyuA, fliC, and terA were found in 90% of the isolates. virulence genes terZ, terW, espP, terW, espP, irp, fyuA, EAST and astA were found in 46%, 42%. the gene terZ was significantly more often found in E. coli from CD+ calves than CD- calves (P 0.01) the virulence genes espP, irp, and fyu were not found in any isolate. 87.5% of the isolates were resistant to one or more substances. virulence genes of the virulence genes fimA, fimB, fimC, fimH, fliC, and terA were found in 90% of the isolates. there was no significant association between breed, gender, time to separation from dam and being a CD+ or CD- calf (P > 0.05). the gene terZ was significantly more often found in E. coli from CD+ calves than CD- calves (P 0.01). virulence genes espP, irp, and fyuA were more common among isolates. multivariable analysis Variables associated with being a CD+ or CD- calf. of these 72 variables 10 (with a P 0.20 and considered potential risk factors) were eligible for entering the multivariable analysis. there was a high correlation (r 0.70) between herd size and milk calf feeder. a total of 58 variables were screened in the univariable logistic regression analysis of variables associated with antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates. of these 58 variables 7 (with a P 0.20, and considered being potential risk factors) were eligible for the multivariable analysis. able analysis were selected to be eligible for the multivariable analysis. there was an increased risk of being a CD+ calf for a calf diagnosed at age 11 or 22 days old compared to calves diagnosed at 12-21 days old. there was a higher risk that a calf in a larger herd was a CD+ calf than a calf in a smaller herd (120 cows) the variable with the lowest P-value in the univariable analysis was selected to be eligible for the multivariable analysis. it was not possible to make any final multivariable model since the only variable remaining with a P-value 0.05 in the model was herd size. in dairy herds about one third of diarrhoeic calves (1-90 days) were treated with trimethoprim/sulfa, enrofloxacin or other antimicrobials. the total use of antimicrobials in the herds is unknown but there was no association between such routines and resistance. resistance was more common in E. coli from calves with diarrhea than in isolates from healthy calves. a higher prevalence of resistant E. coli in calves with diarrhoea could also be due to linkage between virulence genes and resistance genes as proposed by Martinez & Baquero. no association between virulence factor iucD and resistance to streptomycin, ampicillin, sulphametoxazole and trimethoprim in E. coli from dairy cows with mastitis. however, there was no association to single antimicrobials or resistance phenotypes. a decrease in the homogeneity of the faecal coliform flora has been shown in suckling pigs with diarrhea. biochemical fingerprinting was performed to increase the probability of selecting isolates of the pathogenic strain and thereby the probability of detecting virulence genes. in calves, there is no predominance of single clones even in diarrhea caused by enteropathogenic E. coli. larger herds were more likely to have calf group feeder in the present study. calf mortality in this study was higher than previously reported in Swedish herds. authors declare that they have
