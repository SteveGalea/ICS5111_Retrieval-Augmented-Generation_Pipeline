{"summary": "TDP-43 is a member of the heterogeneous ribonuclear protein group. it has a range of functions that affect gene expression including regulation of transcription, alternative splicing, microRNA biogenesis, and RNA transport and translation. under normal physiological conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly localized in the nucleus [6], but is synthesized in the cytoplasm [7] and is shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a transcription dependent manner [ transcriptomic changes were compared with RNA sequencing data from mice with reduced levels of TDP-43 after injection with an ASO against TDP-43 [14] transcriptomic changes were compared with RNA sequencing data from mice with reduced levels of TDP-43 after injection with an ASO against TDP-43. a tetracycline responsive promoter was used to drive expression of the tetracycline transactivator protein (Camk2-tTa) a tetracycline responsive promoter was used to drive expression of the tetracycline transactivator protein (Camk2a-tTa x tetO-NLS-hTDP-43). expression was repressed in bigenic mice (n = 4, 3 male) with a raw reads from both RNAseq experiments had their 3\u2019 Illumina v1.5 smRNA adaptors trimmed using cutadapt [17] were mapped to the mm9 Mus musculus genome build using Bowtie (version 0.12.7 with options\u2014time -k 100\u2014best\u2014strata -v 2 -p 3) [18] and were further filtered to a maximum mismatch rate of 0.06. background gene lists were the sets of genes meeting the minimum read count threshold (10 reads per million in at least one sample) to reduce redundancy, these results were passed to a Ruby script. to compute pathway fold changes, the refSeq IDs of genes in each pathway were matched with those from the DESeq2 results. all histone genes with no coverage were converted to 0.1, the lowest possible coverage, and histone values were divided by the normalization factors. the changes in canonical and variant histones were quantified with 2-sided t-tests between the 4 bigenic and 4 nontransgenic normalized geometric means. cDNA was generated using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) primed with either random hexamers or oligo-dTs for total RNA or polyadenylated RNA. biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system using custom-designed primers. gene expression values were determined by using the comparative CT method. the genes of interest were standardized to the geometric mean of 2 housekeeping genes (Gapdh and Actb) a tetracycline responsive promoter was used to drive expression of the tetracycline transactivator protein (Camk2-tTa x tetO-NLS-hTDP-43). expression was repressed in bigenic mice (n = 4, 3 male) with a doxycycline diet until 28 days of age at which time expression was induced by removal of the doxycycline diet. RNA was obtained 10 days later because this is eq data Raw reads from both RNAseq experiments had their 3\u2019 Illumina v1.5 smRNA adaptors trimmed using cutadapt [17] were mapped to the mm9 Mus musculus genome build using Bowtie. only uniquely mapping reads were considered for further analysis except for histone analysis. coverage of the protein-coding segment of the genome was computed using the bedtools genomecov [19] tool. a custom Python script was used to compute the number of CLIP hits and proportion of coverage of the CLIP hits over each genetic feature. to reduce redundancy, these results were passed to a Ruby script, available from the authors, to group functionally similar pathways together. all histone genes with no coverage were converted to 0.1, the lowest possible coverage, and histone values were divided by the normalization factors. the changes in canonical and variant histones were quantified with 2-sided t-tests between the 4 bigenic and 4 nontransgenic normalized geometric means. the remaining supernatant and pellet from the 1,000xg spin were then taken. cDNA was generated using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) primed with either random hexamers or oligo-dTs for total RNA or polyadenylated RNA. the genes of interest were standardized to the geometric mean of 2 housekeeping genes (Gapdh and Actb) immunoblotting The antibodies used for immunoblotting were rabbit polyclonal C1038 antibody against total TDP-43 [28], rabbit monoclonal anti histone H3 (Cell Signaling #4499P, Danvers, MA) and rat monoclonal anti HSP90 (Enzo 16F1, Farmingdale, NY). 1,146,050 uniquely mapped reads per sample were identified using DESeq2 [20], which identified 4,321 out of 10,601 genes meeting a minimum read threshold of 10 reads per million in at least one sample. of these genes, 2,166 were upregulated in the NLS mice compared to the control mice, and the remaining 2,155 were downregulated. pathway analysis was performed on the significantly up- and down-regulated genes in the bigenic mice compared to nontransgenic mice using NIH DAVID [25,26]. dimensional scaling and principal component analysis shows distinct global transcriptomic profiles for NLS-hTDP-43 mice. mice overexpressing NLS-hTDP-43 show splicing changes, we used DEXSeq [21] to search for differentially spliced exons. out of 250,620 exons analyzed, only 23 were identified as differentially spliced. Several transcripts regulate transcription and RNA processing. expression is associated with a reduction of endogenous nuclear mTDP-43 protein. the relative absence of splicing alterations in NLS-hTDP-43 mice suggests that at least some TDP-43 protein was present within the nucleus. the effects of transgene overexpression are mainly due to cytoplasmic gain of function. protein supports a gain of cytoplasmic function as one potential mechanism underlying the observed transcriptomic changes. n = 4 mice per category (4 bigenic, 2 monogenic, 2 non-transgenic) technique replicates were combined to analyze biological replicates of control mice versus TDP-43 ASO injected knockdown mice (n = 4, 4 female) Across these samples, we found a mean of 30,794,457 total reads, with a mean of 29,132,557 uniquely mapping. we were able to map more reads than the original study [14], which used an older version of Bowtie (0.12.2) multidimensional scaling and principal component analysis shows distinct global transcriptomic profiles for TDP-43 ASO knockdown (n = 4) and control ASO (n = 4) mice. 1,029 out of 250,620 exons are differentially expressed upon ASO knockdown. pathway analysis suggests that most of the transcriptomic effects due to ASO knockdown are associated with the wound response and neuronal death. only 495 and 202 were significantly down- or up-regulated in both datasets. the effects of overexpressing NLS-hTDP-43 seem to be distinct from those caused by a direct loss of TDP-43 function. however, many of the transcriptomic changes observed in NLS-hTDP-43 mice exhibit a low number of splicing changes. despite the low overlap with the splicing microarray analysis, this analysis supports the lack of alternative splicing events due to NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression. the low number of alternative splicing events identified in the NLS mice does not appear to be due to insufficient read depth or inappropriate choice of methodology. despite these technological differences, this analysis supports the lack of alternative splicing events due to NLS-hTDP-43 overexpression. the RNA sequencing protocol had a polyadenylation selection step. it is important to note that the RNA sequencing protocol had a polyadenylation selection step. but misprocessing of canonical histone transcripts can lead to aberrant polyadenylation. the canonical histones were upregulated in the bigenic mice. variant histones were slightly but significantly downregulated in the bigenic mice. the significant upregulation of canonical histones in this poly(A)+ selected dataset implies that these transcripts were aberrantly polyadenylated. RNA-seq and RT-PCR analysis validates RNA-seq results. except for histone transcripts (white filled symbols) which revealed distinct results when priming with random hexamers versus oligo-dT\u2019s. analysis of the HITS-CLIP data found that out of 28,661 protein coding genes, 7,697 genes had TDP-43 binding sites. transcripts were also enriched for TDP-43 RNA binding sites from the HITS-CLIP data. this suggests a direct role of TDP-43 in regulating these transcripts. survival of motor neuron (Smn) is also known to regulate histone 3\u2019 UTR processing [38]. Interestingly, Smn splicing is regulated by TDP-43 [30], and its transcript was significantly downregulated upon NLS-hTDP-43 expression in our dataset. to validate these changes in canonical histones were due to aberrant polyadenylation, we performed RT-qPCR on the same samples used for RNA sequencing. h4 was significantly downregulated in the bigenic mice when there was no poly(A)+ selection step. comparison of expression changes based on RNA-seq versus RT-qPCR showed a high correlation with the exception of random hexamer primed canonical histone genes. this confirms that NLS-hTDP-43 expression leads to differential expression of transcripts which regulate histone 3\u2019 UTR processing. on-dox refers to mice fed a doxycycline-containing diet until sacrifice. values are ratios of oligo-dT:random hexamer-primed expression. in remaining rows, values are random hexamer-primed expression values normalized to housekeeping genes. the change in Snrpe and Snrpd3 expression observed in bigenic mice off doxycycline was no longer observed in bigenic mice maintained on doxycycline. repressing transgene expression with doxycycline reverses the histone and 3\u2019UTR processing gene dysregulation in bigenic mice. these histologic changes were seen in all bigenic mice in which transgene expression was turned on for 3 months or longer. in contrast, nuclear changes were subtle or absent in mice with shorter lengths of transgene expression. these results corroborate the results of the transcriptomic analysis. LD-TDP were immunostained for TDP-43 protein and examined for changes in nuclear structure. nuclei of neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates appeared to be slightly larger than nuclei from adjacent uninvolved neurons. 133 nuclei associated with TDP-43 inclusions and 254 adjacent uninvolved nuclei were measured from 13 human cases. DESeq2 identified 4,321 out of 10,601 genes meeting a minimum read threshold of 10 reads per million in at least one sample as significantly differentially expressed. of these genes, 2,166 were upregulated in the NLS mice compared to the control mice and the remaining 2,155 were downregulated. only 23 out of 250,620 exons are significantly differentially expressed with Benjamini-Hochberg correct p-values of less than 0.05. pathway analysis was performed on the significantly up- and down-regulated genes in the bigenic mice compared to nontransgenic controls using NIH DAVID. mice overexpressing NLS-hTDP-43 show splicing changes, we used DEXSeq [21] to search for differentially spliced exons. out of 250,620 exons analyzed, only 23 were identified as differentially spliced. manual inspection of the 16 unique annotated, non-hypothetical genes in this set revealed these genes fall into two general categories. the relative absence of splicing alterations in NLS-hTDP-43 mice suggests that at least some TDP-43 protein was present within the nucleus, resulting in functional recovery from the loss of mTDP-43. the bigenic mice showed increased cytosolic levels of total TDP-43 protein. subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblot protein analysis reveals a similar level of nuclear total (human and mouse, h+m) TDP-43 levels between bigenic (+/+) and control (+/- or -/-) mice. but an increase in cytosolic TDP-43 levels in the bigenic mice. injected knockdown mice were able to map more reads than the original study. we only uniquely mapped about 50% of total reads compared to the newer version. 11,916 expressed genes in this dataset using the same minimum read count threshold as earlier. 1,029 out of 250,620 exons are differentially expressed upon ASO knockdown. pathway analysis suggests most of the transcriptomic effects are associated with the wound response and neuronal death. analysis with DESeq2 identified 3,714 genes as significantly differentially expressed. the effects of overexpressing NLS-hTDP-43 seem to be distinct from those caused by a direct loss of TDP-43 function. we performed an identical DEXSeq analysis on the RNA sequencing data from the TDP-43 ASO knockdown experiment. 1,029 out of 250,620 exons were significantly differentially spliced upon ASO knockdown. the low number of alternative splicing events identified in the NLS mice does not appear to be due to insufficient read depth or inappropriate choice of methodology. the main effects of NLS-hTDP-43 are due to a cytoplasmic gain of function rather than a nuclear loss of function. RNA sequencing protocol had a polyadenylation selection step. canonical histone transcripts can be subdivided into canonical versus variant transcripts. variant histone transcripts are normally polyadenylated. genic mice were slightly but significantly downregulated in the bigenic mice. variant histones were slightly but significantly downregulated in the bigenic mice. similar RT-qPCR validation with random hexamer priming confirms the upregulation in aberrantly polyadenylated histones. analysis of the HITS-CLIP data found that out of 28,661 protein coding genes, 7,697 genes had TDP-43 binding clusters in their exons, introns, 3\u2019 UTRs, or 5\u2019 UTRs. however, only one canonical histone transcript contained any significant TDP-43 binding sites (Hist1h2bc with 2 hits in the 3\u2019 UTR) gene Symbol Present in DESeq\"* Role Cpsf3 Yes Likely to interact with CPSF-73 for cleavage Cpsf3 Yes Endonuclease, cleaves histone pre-mRNAs Eri1 Yes Aids Slbp in stem loop binding, U7 snRNP stabilization Lsm10 No Part of U7 snRNP, process histone mRNA for splicing Nelfa Yes Particip transcript was significantly downregulated upon NLS-hTDP-43 expression. to validate changes in histone 3\u2019 UTR processing genes, we performed RT-qPCR on the same samples used for RNA sequencing to measure canonical histone transcripts. expression changes based on RNA-seq versus RT-qPCR showed a high correlation with the exception of random hexamer primed canonical histone genes. this confirms that NLS-hTDP-43 expression leads to differential expression of transcripts which regulate histone 3\u2019 UTR processing. this coincident with an upregulation in aberrantly polyadenylated canonical histone genes. in top two rows, values are ratios of oligo-dT:random hexamer-primed expression. in remaining rows, values are random hexamer-primed expression values normalized to housekeeping genes. repressing transgene expression with doxycycline reverses the histone and 3\u2019UTR processing gene dysregulation in bigenic mice. the results demonstrate that repressing transgene expression with doxycycline reverses the histone and 3\u2019UTR processing gene dysregulation. nuclear changes were subtle or absent in mice with shorter lengths of transgene expression. n = 21, ranging from 0 to 2 months of transgene expression. these results corroborate the results of the transcriptomic analysis. 133 nuclei associated with TDP-43 inclusions and 254 adjacent uninvolved nuclei were measured from 13 human cases. nuclei of neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates had a 31.4% larger cross-sectional area (75.66 m2) relative to nuclei of adjacent uninvolved neurons (57.56 m2) abnormal patterns of chromatin staining and nucleomegaly were also confirmed histologically. this suggests that a gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function affects nuclear dynamics. this suggests that a gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function affects nuclear dynamics. levels of total (mouse and human) TDP-43 protein were similar in nuclei of both bigenic and nontransgenic mice. the lack of transcriptomic similarity with the ASO knockdown suggests that the widespread degeneration and transcriptomic changes observed in the NLS-hTDP-43 expressing mice may be due to a toxic gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function. this is further supported by the paucity of splicing changes upon expression of NLS-h RT-PCR and CLIP analyses showed that cytoplasmic TDP-43 interacts with and alters the expression of several transcripts involved in histone 3\u2019 UTR processing. this suggests that canonical histone dysregulation may be a mechanism by which chromatin assembly pathways and nuclear dynamics are disrupted. the results of this study provide an improved understanding of the effects of a cytoplasmic gain of function. the mice expressing the NLS-hTDP-43 transgene suffered neurodegeneration without common cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregations [13]."}
