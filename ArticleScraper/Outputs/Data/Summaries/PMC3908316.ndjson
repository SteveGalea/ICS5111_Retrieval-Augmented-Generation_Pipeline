{"summary": "in australia there is public health concern relating to bats\u2019 role as reservoirs of Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABLV), which has clinical features identical to classical rabies. three deaths from ABLV have occurred in Australia. more than 60 viruses have been detected in bat tissue [3,4], with bats implicated as reservoir hosts for highly pathogenic Nipah, Hendra, Lyssa and Ebola viruses. bats have been identified as likely hosts of the recently emerged Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. 5% of tested Australian bats have evidence of ABLV infection. this increases to 20% for sick, injured or orphaned bats. ABLV may cause overt disease in bats, but abnormal bat behaviour is associated with ABLV. a representative sample of nsw residents aged 16 years and older were interviewed during may and may 2011 using a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. the sample consisted of people randomly selected in 2010 for a population health survey using an electronic telephone directory. second round interview questions explored how long ago the bat exposure had occurred; whether there were single or multiple bat exposures; and the respondents\u2019 reasons for handling the bat. a sample size of 800 was required to provide statistical significance of +/ 5% for dichotomous variables. interviews were conducted between 09.00 and 20.00, with up to seven call attempts made for each individual. first round interviews explored prior exposure to bats, including self-reported \u2018handling of bats\u2019, risk behaviours, and demographic data. a sample size of 800 was required to provide statistical significance of +/ 5% for dichotomous variables. results Fourteen hundred telephone numbers were called and 821 interviews completed. there were 166 refusals; 111 respondents did not meet the eligibility criteria; and 302 were unable to be contacted. follow-up interviews were completed with 39% (49/127) of respondents who stated that they had previously handled bats. 2.4 (3) 1.6 (11) 0.0362 20\u201329 years 17.9 (1010437) 5.1 (42) 6.3 (8) 4.9 (34) 30\u201349 years 35.4 (1995657) 26.2 (214) 24.4 (31) 26.5 (183) 50\u201364 years 22.5 (1267767) 31.8 (260) 37.0 (47) 30.9 (213) 65+ years 17.5 (985349) 35.1 (287) 29.9 (38) 36.1 (249) *4 people refused. respondents reported a range of reasons for handling bats. the most commonly provided reason was that the bat was either injured or sick. two respondents reported that they had handled bats in Bali, Indonesia. 35% (126/345) could not recall what advice was contained in the warning. 35% (121/345) said that the message was not to handle bats. a quarter of respondents indicated they would handle the bat. 32% (41/127) indicated that they would again handle a trapped or injured bat compared with 24% (165/694) of those who had never previously handled a bat (2 = 4.13, p = 0.0421) of respondents who reported previously hearing a warning about bats, 24% (83/345) stated that they would handle a trapped or injured bat if they encountered one. practices on receiving minor scratch or major scratch or bite Respondents were asked what actions they would take if they received a minor scratch or major scratch or bite. for minor scratches, 14% (117/821) of respondents indicated they would ignore the scratch, while 10% (85/821) reported they would wash the wound with water and 21% (171/821) would use an antiseptic. overall, 38% (311/821) said they would immediately seek medical care. 4.6 (82) 39.8 (276) 75.1 (521) 47.3 (163) 79.7 (275) 56.0 (65) 81.9 (95) Wash the wound with antiseptic 20.8 (171) 11.6 (95) 29.9 (38) 18.1 (23) 19.2 (133) 10.4 (72) 20.9 (72) 11.6 (40) 15.5 (18) 13.8 (16) Make a routine appointment to seek medical care 20.0 (164) 15.6 (128) 17.3 (22) 18.9 (24) 20.5 twenty one percent of male respondents (63/304) had handled bats compared with 12% (64/517) of female respondents (2 = 10.2, p = 0.0014) the one respondent who was a bat handler by profession reported no bites or scratches. the one respondent who was a bat handler by profession reported no bites or scratches. domestic pet attacked/retrieved bat 12 (6) Bat inside house/shed 16 (8) Injured or sick bat 29 (14) Exposure occurred during bat education event or visit to wildlife zoo (within Australia) 18 (9) Exposure occurred during visit to wildlife zoo or temple (Bali, Indonesia) 4 (2) Other exposure 10 (5) *Percentages do not add up to 100% as some respondents had multiple exposures. a quarter of respondents indicated they would handle the injured or trapped bat. of those who had previously handled bats, 32% (41/127) indicated they would again handle a trapped or injured bat compared with 24% (165/694) of those who had never previously handled a bat (2 = 4.13, p = 0.0421) 2.9 20 3.5 12 1.7 2 Release it 2.2 18 5.5 7 1.6 11 2.9 10 2.6 3 Cover it with a towel or net 2.1 17 3.2 4 1.9 13 2.3 8 3.5 4 Put it in a box 1.3 11 2.4 3 0.6 4 1.5 5 0.9 1 Not handle bat Phone an animal welfare organisation 54.9 451 49.6 63 55.9 388 55.1 190 56.0 65 Ignore it/leave it alone 15.7 129 respondents Previously handled have not handled bats Knowledge of ABLV Message of not handle bats Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Minor scratch or bite Major scratch or bite % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % (n) % the low number of known lyssavirus infections in the genus Lyssavirus has been attributed to the secluded nature of those bats associated with EBLV. rabies virus is the type species (serotype 1). 18% of exposures occurred during bat education events or visits to Australian wildlife zoos. however, there continues to be a risk of potential exposure to bat borne viruses in travellers to Bali, Indonesia. domestic pets were involved in 12% of exposures, highlighting potential for lyssavirus exposure in domestic pets. a quarter of respondents reported that they would handle an injured or trapped bat and 17% would use their bare hands. a small number (n = 27) still stated that they would handle a trapped or injured bat. the majority of calls were made during working hours, which may explain the overrepresentation of older persons and females. however, this bias would favour an under representation of bat exposures. the findings may not be representative of the total Australian population."}
