{"summary": "pathogen lineage is exposed to a novel environment (e.g. a new host species or an antimicrobial drug) in which fitness is reduced. pathogen lineage will go extinct unless it adapts quickly enough to improve its fitness and successfully invade this new environment. key mutations may occur in the reservoir or the novel environment. a new study has extended this comprehensive approach to a viral host jump. the aim is to characterize several traits associated with fitness for a more limited set of genotypes that comprise a putative pathway to emergence. a powerful complementary approach has tracked viral evolution in vivo by measuring changes in genotype frequencies. the correlation between within-host fitness and between-host fitness can be positive or negative. pathogens that infect numerous tissue types can exhibit complex relationships between fitnesses at the two scales. circulating strains of H5N1 avian influenza are within a few mutations of genotypes that transmit much more efficiently among mammals. theoretical study of pathogen emergence has previously focused on evolutionary invasion at the host population scale. an introduced pathogen exhibits weak transmission in the novel host environment, and must mutate to higher transmissibility before the transmission chain dies out. omissions separate the current theory from the empirical evidence. our aim is to create a tractable cross-scale model from which analytical insights and biological intuition can be derived. we represent the between-host scale using multi-type branching processes as in previous models. instead of assuming equal rates of mutation between all pairs of genotypes, we introduce a sub-model for within-host selection based on population genetic theory. evolutionary dynamics of pathogen populations at multiple scales can lead to substantial complexity, so it is necessary to make simplifying assumptions. each infected host has a single pathogen genotype at any point in time. parameters are marked with a subscript or superscript i corresponding to the pathogen genotype. the pathogen lineage may reach an 'emergence genotype' with R0(i) > 1, which has a non-zero chance of successfully invading the host population. we calculate the probability that the emergence genotype arises and successfully invades the host population, P(emergence) using techniques described below. in the SSWM limit, strong selection means that only beneficial mutations are considered, and mutation rates are sufficiently low that simultaneous mutation events can be neglected. in the SSWM limit, strong selection means that only beneficial mutations are considered, and mutation rates are sufficiently low that simultaneous mutation events can be neglected. the SSWM model for within-host evolution means that a higher relative fitness of a neighbouring genotype leads to a faster rate of substitution. the biological basis for this effect derives from the probability of fixation of a new genotype when it first arises within a host. the rate of substitution is faster when the relative fitness difference is large. we can derive an approximation for the probability of emergence. each factor of 1/(1 R0(i) is the expected number of infections in a subcritical chain of transmission initiated by a type-i individual in the absence of evolution. the approximation works well through most of the parameter range considered. we assume each infected host has a single pathogen genotype at any point in time. each pathogen genotype has two measures of fitness associated with it. at the within-host scale, the fitness of the pathogen corresponds to its ability to transmit through the population. the pathogen lineage may reach an \u2018emergence genotype\u2019 with R0(i) > 1, which has a non-zero chance of successfully invading the new host population. we calculate the probability that the emergence genotype arises and successfully invades the host population, P(emergence) using techniques described below. in the SSWM limit, strong selection means that only beneficial mutations are considered, and mutation rates are sufficiently low that simultaneous mutation events can be neglected. the simplicity of the SSWM limit arises because beneficial mutations go to fixation much faster than new mutations arise. the SSWM model for within-host evolution means that a higher relative fitness of a neighbouring genotype leads to a faster rate of substitution. the biological basis for this effect derives from the probability of fixation of a new genotype when it first arises within a host. a greater fitness advantage for the new genotype leads to a higher likelihood that it will fix after it arises. we can derive an approximation for the probability of emergence. each factor of 1/(1 R0(i) is the expected number of infections in a subcritical chain of transmission initiated by a type-i individual in the absence of evolution. the low mutation rate assumption allows us to neglect outcomes where more than one virus lineage reaches emergence. the approximation works well through most of the parameter range considered. in the first scenario, we consider a simple genotype space, and a basic set of qualitatively distinct fitness landscapes. the \u2018equal-rate\u2019 landscape arises when relative fitness gains are equal for each step, the \u2018fast\u2013slow\u2019 landscape when the first step yields greater fitness gain than the second, and the \u2018slow\u2013fast\u2019 landscape in the reverse case. at the within-host scale, we consider three fitness landscapes (figure 1a) we assume rates of recovery or death (di) are equal across genotypes. the rising reproductive numbers correspond to longer infectious periods 1/di. at the within-host scale, only pathways with increasing fitness are relevant under the SSWM framework. the equal-rate landscape is linear in log-scaled absolute fitness (figure 1b) the approximation (equation) shows that the probability of emergence is maximized when m1,2 = m2,3. this is because the product of substitution rates is maximized when the rates are equal. this in turn maximizes the overall probability of emergence. the equal-rate landscape gives the highest probability of emergence because it gives the fastest substitutions overall. results for fast\u2013slow (dashed line) and slow\u2013fast (dotted line) landscapes overlap almost exactly. when the intermediate between-host fitness is greater than the initial fitness (R0(2) > R0(1)), it is more advantageous for the pathogen to spend less time in the intermediate state. the slow\u2013fast scenario is more favourable for emergence (figure 3b) dotted and dashed lines represent the slow\u2013fast (bottom) and fast\u2013slow (top) from figure 1b. emergence as a function of the between-host fitness of the intermediate genotype, R0(2), for three within-host landscapes (solid line, equal-rate; dashed line, fast\u2013slow; dotted line, slow\u2013fast) fitness is negatively correlated with between-host fitness. the probability of emergence is low as the negative correlation becomes stronger. alternative pathways can lead to conflict between scales. the correlation is influenced by the fitnesses of genotypes B2 and B\u20322. the correlation is influenced by the fitnesses of genotypes B1 and B\u20322. a high within-host fitness w1 leads to a high probability of stepping towards emergence, but then the fitness w2 is only marginally higher, so the substitution rate m1,2 is slow. within-host fitness of genotypes B\u20322, B\u20321, B0, B1 and B2 were selected randomly, such that were drawn uniformly from the ranges. probability of emergence shows a positive association with the correlation between fitnesses across scales, though with considerable scatter. at the within-host scale, we consider three fitness landscapes. the \u2018equal-rate\u2019 landscape arises when relative fitness gains are equal for each step, the \u2018fast\u2013slow\u2019 landscape when the first step yields greater fitness gain than the second, and the \u2018slow\u2013fast\u2019 landscape in the reverse case. we define the \u2018equal-rate\u2019 landscape as the case that has equal gains in relative fitness when moving from the initial to the intermediate genotype, and from the intermediate to the emergence genotype. the \u2018fast\u2013slow\u2019 landscape has a greater fitness gain from the initial to the intermediate genotype than from the intermediate to the terminal genotype. m1,2 in the fast\u2013slow case is equal to m2,3 in the slow\u2013fast case and vice-versa. the equal-rate landscape is linear in log-scaled absolute fitness (figure 1b) the approximation (equation (2.2) shows that the probability of emergence is maximized when m1,2 = m2,3 = m2,3. we consider a set of jackpot landscapes at the between-host scale, with a range of fitness values for the initial (A1) and intermediate (A2) genotypes. equal-rate (solid line) landscape gives the highest probability of emergence because it gives the fastest substitutions overall. curves for the slow\u2013fast and fast\u2013slow cases to cross at R0(2) = 0.5, the fitness of the initial genotype. however, the crossing point is shifted slightly in favour of the fast\u2013slow scenario, reflecting an additional evolutionary benefit to spending more time in the A2 genotype than the A1 genotype. the vertical solid line marks the between-host jackpot scenario and the horizontal solid line marks the within-host equal-rate scenario. the horizontal solid line marks the within-host equal-rate scenario. the horizontal solid line marks the within-host equal-rate scenario. within-host selection favours the pathway that leads to extinction at the between-host scale. when within-host fitness is negatively correlated with between-host fitness, then the probability of emergence is higher as the lineage almost always evolves along the emergence pathway. measure the linear dependence between the fitnesses at the two scales. a high within-host fitness w1 leads to a high probability of stepping towards emergence, but then the fitness w2 is only marginally higher. a high within-host fitness w1 leads to a high probability of stepping towards emergence. within-host fitness of genotypes B\u20322, B\u20321, B0, B1 and B2 were selected randomly, such that were drawn uniformly from the ranges. probability of emergence shows a positive association with the correlation between fitnesses across scales, though with considerable scatter. within-host fitness plays an important role in evolutionary emergence. empirical research has started to measure fitness at multiple scales [7,8] and track cross-scale evolution [15,16,45] for pathogens linked to emergence events. our model provides the potential of coupling phenotypic data from experimental studies to pathogen genotypes detected in field surveillance. at the between-host scale, the absolute fitness of the current genotype (compared with the current fixed genotype) is the crucial measure, as it determines whether the transmission chain continues or goes extinct. differences stem from basic population dynamic properties of the emergence problem, which apply to emerging infections. an important future aim is to integrate the within-host population dynamics of the pathogen, which will influence the relative strength of selection versus drift. an important application is to study evolutionary change during transmission bottlenecks, which can be extremely narrow [56,57] so drift can act strongly. our results also give new perspectives into the population size component of the SSWM substitution rate. the relevant population size is the equilibrium abundance of infected target cells, not viral particles. further investigation of how within-host dynamics lead to shifts in viral genotypes is an important avenue to developing improved cross-scale models. studies have identified adaptive mutations that improve cell receptor binding in humans. these were found in viruses transmitted between humans, but not in civet isolates. a recent study of HIV-1 highlights the unexpected insights than can arise from considering sequence data across scales. our theoretical results show how relationships between fitnesses at multiple scales influence emergence. these approaches can yield insight on evolutionary dynamics of pathogens at within-host or between-host scales. the model introduced here represents a foundation for such an integrative cross-scale theory. the vector of extinction probabilities is the unique solution to G(e) = e in [0,1)k. for the landscapes considered in the text, we assume that, i.e. type k is an emergence genotype."}
