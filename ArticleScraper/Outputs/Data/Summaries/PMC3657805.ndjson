{"summary": "we surveyed serum specimens from 415 apparently healthy bats captured from five different countries (Guatemala, Cameroon, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Kenya) that represent 33 species, 26 genera, and seven families. a total of 58 bat-derived viruses was detected. 1,673 specimens collected between 2007 and 2011 from 1,615 bats representing 58 species, 44 genera, and eight families in seven countries worldwide were screened. genetic material of bat-derived viruses was detected in six of the eight families of bats tested, representing all major phylogenetic lineages of the chiroptera. both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses supported the clustering of these two genera into 11 strongly supported clades. all previously described viruses fall within the phylogenetic diversity of the bat-derived viruses described here. clade A viruses were distinct from, but most closely related to GBV-B. a bat was infected with both a hepacivirus (clade C) and a pegivirus (clade K) 83 bat-derived viruses are shown along with the clade designations (A to K); an asterisk indicates viruses for which the near full-length genome was obtained. BHV and BPgV genome sequences comprise at least 8,916 nt and encode precursor polyproteins of 2,842\u20133,469 aa in length. a comparison of predicted protein products indicated that the envelope (E) and the nonstructural proteins NS2 and NS5A were most variable, with less than 34.5%, 33.5%, and 20.4% (hepaciviruses) and 48.3%, 59.2%, and 37.7% (pegi NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. the structural and nonstructural proteins are shown in green and red. the region between E2 and NS2 is shown in light blue. a predicted protein of 7\u201328 kDa is present between E2 and NS2. the alternative GUG start codon is 41 nt upstream of the main C ORF. there is no in-frame stop codon that terminates the BHV PDB-829 ARF. the BHVs contain 8\u201311 of the 18 E2 cysteine residues strictly conserved among HCV genotypes. putative gene products after polyprotein cleavage are indicated in green for the structural proteins, red for the nonstructural proteins, light blue for the region analogous to the HCV-p7, and dark blue for the variable region (VR). putative gene products after polyprotein cleavage are indicated in green for the structural proteins. sequences ranging from 50 to 10,803 nt in length were identified in the positive pools. genetic material from 58 bat-derived viruses was detected. 78 positive sera/plasma, one lung specimen, and one rectal swab were tested. 83 bat-derived viruses were identified in the sera or plasma of infected bats. phylogenetic trees based on the complete helicase and RdRp coding sequences of a representative subset of these viruses, along with previously known hepaci- and pegivirus sequences, supported the clustering of these two genera into 11 strongly supported clades. the bat-derived pegiviruses identified in this study formed three distinct lineages (BPP = 1.0) the clades G and K viruses formed phylogenetically distinct clusters within the genus. clade H viruses clustered with previously identified GBV-D viruses (24). notably, the African, North American, and Asian bat pegivirus lineages were all paraphyletic. twenty near full-length genome sequences were generated. the bat hepaciviruses (BHVs) and bat pegiviruses (BPgVs) were identified. the BHV and BPgV genome sequences comprise at least 8,916 nt. NS5B were the most conserved with aa sequence identities in the range of 39.2\u201353.3% (NS3) and 35.3\u201346% (NS5B) for hepaciviruses and 43.8\u201378.7% (NS3) and 39.5\u201371.1% (NS5B) for pegiviruses. the genome organization and putative proteomic map of the bat-derived viruses is shown for each clade. the genome of the BHV PDB-829 in clade D contains a potential alternate reading frame (ARF) that overlaps the core protein-coding gene (SI Appendix, Fig. S7) the genome of the BHV PDB-829 in clade D contains a potential alternate reading frame (ARF) that overlaps the core protein-coding gene. predicted signal peptidase cleavage sites identified 18\u201321 aa downstream. further studies are necessary to determine whether the VR is part of E1 or encodes for a separate protein. translated envelope protein sequences (E1, E2) contain 5\u20139 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. study suggests bats are a major natural reservoir for both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses. hepaciviruses, formerly detected only in primates, were recently identified in horses and dogs (21\u201323) a long evolutionary history of these viruses in bats is further supported by the distribution across the different taxonomic groups of bats. the three distinct clades of BHVs that were all identified in Kenyan specimens were each associated with common insectivorous African bats (O. martiensseni and H. vittatus) the evolutionary history of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses is clearly more complex than previously thought. the evolutionary history of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses is clearly more complex than previously thought. hepaci- and pegiviruses in other mammalian taxa will be necessary to unveil the diversity, biogeography, epizootiology, and natural history of these viruses. the species of each animal was identified by field biologists and recorded. all bats captured were apparently healthy. samples of sera from bat specimens collected in africa and Guatemala were combined into 43 pools for nucleic acid extraction using the NucliSENS easyMAG. total nucleic acid was treated with DNase-I before random amplification and pyrosequencing (25). PCR primers were applied at 0.2 M concentrations with 1.5 L of cDNA (diluted 1:5) and HotStar polymerase (Qiagen) first round cycle conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 7 min; 15 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 65 \u00b0C for 35 s (1 \u00b0C per cycle) and 72 \u00b0C for 40 s; and 1 cycle at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. animals were collected with mist netting or hoop nets in caves and around human dwellings or from roost locations and foraging sites. bats captured in Bangladesh and Mexico were anesthetized using isoflurane or manually restrained, respectively. animals were safely released at the site of capture following sample collection. total nucleic acid was treated with DNase-I before random amplification. reads were clustered and assembled into contiguous fragments. all bat specimens were initially screened for viral genetic material in pools of 8\u201310 specimens. second round cycling conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 7 min; 35 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 48 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 40 s; and 1 cycle at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min. all PCR products were sequenced in both directions to confirm the presence of viral genetic material in samples."}
