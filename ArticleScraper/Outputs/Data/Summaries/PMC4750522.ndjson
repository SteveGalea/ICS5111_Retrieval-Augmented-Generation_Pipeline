{"summary": "study investigated public risk perception regarding influenza A(H7N9) and attitudes towards closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) before and after LPMs closed in Hong Kong. study investigated public risk perception regarding influenza A(H7N9) and attitudes towards closure of live poultry markets. nexus of second wave of human infections with H7N9 in 2013\u201314.4. a total of 110 human cases of H7N9 infection had been confirmed in Mainland China by 6 October 2014. by march 2014, Hong Kong had reported seven confirmed human cases of H7N9 infection. study examined attitudes towards LPMs and support for permanent closure of LPMs. subjects recruited using telephone interviews through random landline digital dialing. responses for these items were five-point ordinal scale ranging from \u20181 = strongly disagree\u2019 to \u20185 = strongly agree\u2019. one new item was also included in S4 to address respondents' intention to buy live poultry after LPMs reopened. as \u20181 = agree/strongly agree\u2019 versus \u20180 = strongly disagree/disagree/evens\u2019, we first dichotomized each attitudinal independent variable as \u20181 = agree/strongly agree\u2019 versus \u20180 = strongly disagree/disagree/evens\u2019. compared with the general population of Hong Kong,13 respondents in both S3 and S4 were more likely to be female, older and better educated (Table 1).

inconvenience caused by closing LPMs were significantly associated with their attitudes towards support for permanent closure of LPMs. perceived risk and anxiety regarding a newly emerging infectious disease are usually high during the early stage of an epidemic due to great uncertainty on the disease. chicken in Hong Kong increased by 35% between 2006 and 2009. live poultry sales declined by a

associated with support for permanent closure of LPMs. the study results may be subject to social desirability bias and recall bias because all measures were self-reported. the study results may be subject to social desirability bias and recall bias. two-thirds of respondents indicated they would not buy live poultry after the LPMs were reopened. only one-third would support permanent closure of LPMs. perceived risk and anxiety about a newly emerging infectious disease are usually high during the early stage of an epidemic due to great uncertainty. consumption of frozen (kept in a

chilled poultry was positively associated with support for permanent closure of LPMs. perception of personal susceptibility to H7N9 infection was persistently low. perceived severity of H7N9 infection substantially declined in Hong Kong population. support for permanent closure of LPMs remained low."}
