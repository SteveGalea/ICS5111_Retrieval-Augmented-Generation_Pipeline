{"summary": "mycoplasma pulmonis (MP) remains potentially important rodent pathogen causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM) two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased in animal facility of NISER, Bhubaneswar, and were kept in isolation for further investigation. both were found to be positive for MP after serological and molecular tests. sp. is a Gram-negative bacterium lacking a cell wall causing murine respiratory mycoplasmosis. this disease frequently goes undiagnosed due to subclinical nature. it becomes important to diagnose MP infection due to its potential interference with a wide variety of research. commonly observed clinical signs include sneezing, nasal discharge with dyspnea or rales, and also torticollis in the case of middle/internal ear infection Conventional colony of out-bred stocks of Wistar rat was housed in static cages. temperature and humidity ranging between 243\u00b0C and 40-70%. animals were exposed to 12 h light/12 h dark cycle as routine practice. euthanasia of experimental animals by overexposure to CO2 seemed most suitable for pulmonary studies. tracheal washings and infected lung tissue were collected during postmortem examination. a 26-gauge needle was cut blunt along the plastic hub and inserted into the trachea. about 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was flushed in and out of trachea. DNA extraction was done using 275 l of tracheal washing. 20 mg of lung tissue was done using SV Genomic DNA Purification System. the present incidence of MP infection was detected during routine health monitoring of animals. two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased thus kept in isolation for further serological, pathological, and molecular investigations. the whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms. ml centrifuge tube was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. serum was then stored for further analysis. tracheal washings and infected lung tissue were collected. DNA extraction was done using 275 l of tracheal washing. 20 mg of lung tissue was done using SV Genomic DNA Purification System. PCR was performed using species-specific primers for MP. rhea and ruffled hair coat both indicative of decreased grooming and not very specific to the disease diagnosed. affected lungs had faint-to-moderate red color lesions which were firm and wet in appearance. marked areas of gray hepatization coalescing at few spots. multifocal areas of red (yellow boundary) and gray hepatization (brown boundary) marked areas of congestion and pus-filled nodular lesions also visible grossly. heavy multifocal peribronchiolar accumulation of inflammatory cells indicated chronic bronchiolitis (Figure-2d-f) inflammatory cell infiltration along with hemorrhages was found along thickened alveolar septum (Figure-2d-f) affected lungs had faint-to-moderate red color lesions which were firm and wet in appearance. single or multiple lobes were found to be affected. no exudate was observed macroscopically over the surface. necropsy examination of other cases classified as moderate revealed diffuse dark red lesions indicating red hepatization whole of the lung. whole of the lung was found to be involved with fibrinopurulent exudates from the cut surface. tracheal washings were PCR analyzed using species-specific primers for MP. genemic DNA concentration was better from lung tissue (8.2 ng/l) than tracheal washing (2.1 ng/l) morphological alterations in lungs were observed on necropsy of the affected animal. however, severity and extent of lesions varied. moderately affected animals also showed similar lesions but with different patterns. the serological assay is not always considered very accurate due to the presence of cross-reacting antibodies or interfering substances that interact with assay components. a PCR assay allows the specific and rapid detection of this microorganism even in the early stage of the disease. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
