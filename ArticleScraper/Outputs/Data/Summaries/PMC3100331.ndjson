{"summary": "airborne aerosol transmission is believed to make a major contribution to the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis and measles. airborne aerosols have also been implicated in the transmission of diseases such as the common cold, chickenpox, rubella, influenza, pneumococcal disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome. the vuvuzela is a plastic blowing horn that has been adopted by sports fans to provide audible support for their team. the instrument is typically 60 cm in length, tapering from a bell end 11.5 cm in diameter to a mouthpiece of 2.5 cm. air from the lungs is expelled from the mouth through vibrating lips held against the plastic mouthpiece and out through the instrument. each volunteer shouted into a paper cone constructed to have the same 115mm diameter exhale opening as the vuvuzela. the velocity of air as it exited the devices was measured with a hot-wire anemometer and peak airflows were recorded. the duration of playing was recorded with a stopwatch. the great majority (97%) of particles captured from both the vuvuzela and the shouting cone were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter and small enough to enter the lower respiratory tract. the geometric mean (GM) particle diameter was calculated for each experiment. 3 Shout 1.8(0.7) 0.1(0.0) 1.2(0.1) 1.3(0.1) 0.9(0.1) Vuvu 1.4(0.1) 0.3(0.1) 220(260) 134(143) 1.2(0.1) F4 Shout 2.4(1.2) 0.2(0.1) 1.9(0.1) 1.8(0.1) 1.0(0.1) Vuvu 2.3(0.4) 0.3(0.1) 396(335) 263(280) 1.2( the mean duration for vuvuzela playing events was 2.1 sec (range: 1.25\u20133.90 sec) and the shouting lasted for an average of 2.2 sec (range: 0.96\u20134.72 sec) the peak velocity of air exiting the vuvuzelas was higher than from the shouting cone with a mean of 0.59 ms1 (range:0.12\u20131.80 ms1;) compared to a shouting mean of 0.18 ms1 (range: 0.07 aerosols were enumerated in six size categories according to the diameter of the particle. the great majority (97%) of particles captured from both the vuvuzela and the shouting cone were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter and small enough to enter the lower respiratory tract. 1.3(0.1) F2 Shout 3.9(0.7) 0.1(0.0) 6.5(0.5) 6.4(0.3) 0.9(0.0) Vuvu 3.1(0.9) 0.4(0.1) 1077(109) 680(44) 1.5(0.1) F3 Shout 1.8(0.7) 0.1(0.0) 1.2(0.1) 1.3(0.1) 0.9(0.1) Vuvu 1.4(0.1) 0.3(0.1) 220(260) 134( the mean duration for vuvuzela playing events was 2.1 sec (range: 1.25\u20133.90 sec) and the shouting lasted for an average of 2.2 sec (range: 0.96\u20134.72 sec) the peak velocity of air exiting the vuvuzelas was higher than from the shouting cone with a mean of 0.59 ms1. this was equivalent to airflow of 6.1 and 1.8 Ls1 respectively, for the vuvuzela and shouting. for shouting we estimated a peak aerosol concentration of 3,700 per litre or 7,000 particles per second (assuming peak flow volume of 1.8 Ls1) the data is in broad agreement with a recent study of particles exhaled by healthy adults during normal to deep breathing. the difference we observed between male and female volunteers might be explained by differences in their lung capacities. air blowing the vuvuzela may originate in either the lower or upper respiratory tract, or the mouth. the number of contaminated particles expelled will vary according to the pathogen, the site of infection and the extent of disease. some conditions are associated with changes in the rheology of respiratory secretions that might affect aerosol formation. particle counter used to assess concentration of particles recorded measurements at one second intervals. it is possible that peak values were not the maximum level of particle produced. the performance of individuals and production of aerosols may have been influenced by their respective lung capacities. vuvuzela has become popular in south africa, a country with the highest urban prevalence of tuberculosis in the world. there have been no reports of disease transmission from sharing vuvuzelas, or from transfer of non aerosolized respiratory secretions that collect inside the instruments. a number of measles cases were confirmed amongst visitors from other countries but evidence as to the source of their infections is not available. eight healthy volunteers, 4 males and 4 females working in the Research Centre participated. the experiments were conducted in a closed room free from drafts. the geometric mean size (GM) of particles was calculated for each experiment by fitting a log normal distribution to the particle size data at peak concentration. each individual shouted and blew the vuvuzela three times. data were collected on particle concentration every second in each experiment. the geometric mean size of particles was calculated for each experiment. each individual shouted and blew the vuvuzela three times. the confidence interval for the mean difference and p-value were based on a paired (one-sample) t-test. differences in the average particle size between vuvuzela and shouting were similarly assessed using a paired t-test."}
