{"summary": "despite advances in understanding acute gastrointestinal infections, important issues remain to be elucidated. despite advances in understanding acute gastrointestinal infections, important issues concerning epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and control of most persistent digestive symptomatologies remain to be elucidated. diarrhoea is classified into three different categories, namely acute watery diarrhoea (lasting several hours or days); acute bloody diarrhoea (synonymous: dysentery); and persistent diarrhoea (lasting 14 days or longer) diarrhoea is often referred to as an individual term applicable to diarrhoea lasting more than 4\u20136 weeks. helminths and intestinal protozoa play a major role as causative agents of persistent digestive symptomatologies. more than 5 billion people are at risk of neglected tropical diseases. the common soil-transmitted helminths (i.e. Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura) exhibiting the widest geographical distribution. NIDIAG proposes an integrated approach to this challenge. emphasis is placed on a patient-centred approach starting from the presentation at the primary health care level of a clinical syndrome that might be due to \u2018common\u2019 pathogens. three clinical syndromes will be investigated in the NIDIAG framework. symptomatology according to inclusion criteria for the syndrome of digestive disorders is likely to be caused by a large variety of infections, but also non-infectious diseases. for example, blood in the stool may be indicative of colorectal carcinoma or inflammatory disorders (e.g. Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis), but may also be a sign of Schistosoma mansoni (a helminth) or Entamoeba histolytica. the MEDLINE/PubMed search was focused on established laboratory tests as well as newer diagnostic methods. a symptomatology according to the inclusion criteria for the syndrome of digestive disorders is likely to be caused by a large variety of infections. the available literature was reviewed by three independent groups. results were compared, discussed and finally synthesised. a number of experts were consulted to complement the literature review. bacteria, intestinal protozoa, helminths and viruses may cause persistent digestive disorders in infected individuals Enteric pathogen Persistent diarrhoea Persistent abdominal pain Blood in the stool Bacteria Aeromonas spp. there is an ongoing debate whether these intestinal protozoa have pathogenic potential or should rather be seen as simple commensals of the gastrointestinal tract. the large number of available diagnostic tests for the selected pathogens is a challenge for providing the single most accurate method. the results are presented in Table 2 (bacteria), Table 3 (intestinal protozoa), Table 4 (helminths) and Table 5 (viruses) Specific issues on the diagnostic work-up are summarised in the following sub-chapters. ELISA for detection of toxin A and B Cell cytotoxicity assay for detection of toxin A and B Escherichia coli Enteroaggregative -a HEp-2 cell adherence assay. E. coli (EAEC) - a Culture on MAC agar ELISA. xin detection stla/stlbandltgenes [41] Diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) - a HEp-2 cell adherence assay (following incubation in Luria broth) - daaD gene [42] Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria. culture on TCBS agar - PCR for species differentiation (V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus). a Gram staining of stool samples can be useful to evaluate the presence of leucocytes, but is not helpful to differentiate between pathogenic bacteria and apathogenic microbial flora. wet mount smears (unstained or iodine stain) Concentration techniques (e.g. formalin-ether) Permanent stains (e.g. with trichrome, iron hematoxylin, Giemsa) Cryptosporidium spp. Entamoeba histolytica Stool microscopy (No routine procedure) ELISA: faecal antigen detection able to distinguish betweenE. histolyticaandE. dispar/moshkovskii(stool) PCR (in reference laboratories) diagnostic tests for important helminths that may cause persistent digestive disorders Infectious pathogen Diagnostic method Microscopy Stool culture Immunology Molecular biology (PCR) Reference(s) Cestodes Diphyllobothrium latum Stool microscopy - - PCR in research settings (for epidemiological purpose) microscopy of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, duodenal aspirate, skin biopsy Indirect fluorescent antibody test Trichuris trichiura Stool microscopy: egg detection - - ELISA to detect worm-specific antibodies or antigens in serum or stool PCR applied in research settings. cato-Katz method - RDT to detect CCA or CAA antigen in serum or urine (for S. mansoni) Ethyl-acetate or formalin-ether-based concentration techniques Stoll\u2019s dilution Sedimentation techniques FLOTAC (first experiences for S. mansoni) Miracidium-hatching test from stool samples. RT-PCR [95,96] Western Blot Norovirus Sensitivity 105-106 viral particles/ml - Antigen detection faecal samples (EIA) RT-PCR [91] Sapovirus - - - RT-PCR [91] The laboratory techniques are divided into different categories and recommended tests for each pathogen are highlighted. the inoculated media are usually incubated for 24\u201372 hours at 35\u00b0C at ambient atmosphere to allow the bacteria to form macroscopically visible colonies. after the incubation period, the agar plates are examined and morphologically suspicious colonies are identified using different biochemical identification panels or automated phenotypic identification systems. there is no international consensus on immunological assays for detection of Campylobacter spp. PCR assays, characterised by high sensitivity and specificity, have been developed for most of the aforementioned bacteria. however, integration into clinical routine testing is still limited. bone marrow aspiration is only rarely performed in tropical areas due to a lack of adequately equipped hospitals and laboratories. PCR assays have been developed for different antigens of invasive S. enterica serovars. a selective stool culture followed by tests for toxin production remains the diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard for C. difficile. PCR can only prove the presence of the toxin-encoding gene, but cannot distinguish between acute infection and asymptomatic carriage. a screening test should be performed to indicate the bacterium\u2019s presence in a stool sample. this procedure does not require an extensively equipped laboratory and generates accurate results within a few hours. multiplex PCR assays have become the test of choice with excellent sensitivity and specificity (>99%) atypical mycobacteria and atypical mycobacteria are an important cause of long-lasting diarrhoea and gastrointestinal complaints. histopathology often fails to distinguish between gastrointestinal tuberculosis and other granulomatous disorders. culture is the most sensitive technique and remains the diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard. different molecular biological assays have been developed for various mycobacteria, but lack sensitivity for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. microscopic detection of protozoan cysts and trophozoites has been the most widely used diagnostic approach. the formalin-ether concentration technique lacks sensitivity for several intestinal protozoan species as well as many helminths. sensitive EIAs detecting species-specific antigens in faecal samples have been developed. many of these assays are currently being integrated into parasitological reference laboratories as additional diagnostic tool to prove diagnosis in uncertain clinical cases. helminth eggs on microscopic stool examination is the reference test for most intestinal helminth species. direct stool examination after prior concentration (e.g. by formalin-ether concentration technique) is most commonly used. the Kato-Katz thick smear technique is widely used in epidemiological studies and anthelminthic drug efficacy evaluations. the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis is virtually indistinguishable by microscopy. despite all these constraints, microscopy is an invaluable tool for diagnostic medical parasitology. despite all these constraints, microscopy is an invaluable tool for diagnostic medical parasitology. multiplex PCRs can only diagnose a defined host of targeted pathogens. microscopy may sometimes detect unexpected pathogens that would have been missed by other diagnostic methods. most commonly employed are the Baermann funnel and the Koga agar plate. different PCR assays targeting the helminth\u2019s 18S rRNA [87] or 28S rRNA [147] subunit have been developed. first results are promising, but still need further validation in endemic settings. sensitivity fluctuates depending on infection stage and intensity. a single Kato-Katz thick smear does not influence the POC-CCA test results for S. mansoni diagnosis. PCR assays have been developed and are more sensitive than conventional parasitological and serological methods. presently, their use is restricted to specialised reference laboratories and research institutions outside endemic areas. more than 53 types of adenovirus are recognised which can cause a variety of clinical entities. in infected individuals, viral particles are shed in high concentrations. in general, virus isolation followed by serotyping remains the \u2018gold\u2019 standard for the detection of all serotypes. sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests in comparison to reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR have been reported to be comparably low. hBoV has not been isolated by cell culture or in an animal model. rapid antigen tests are currently not available. the relevance of coronavirus as a true human enteric pathogen is unclear. conventional virus isolation by cell culture can be done on human embryonal tracheal cells. electron microscopy is possible for stool samples but displays rather low sensitivity. RT-PCR methods are now widely available for the detection of viral genomes. however, sequence variation among the different enterovirus groups can lower the specificity. serological methods for the detection of enterovirus-specific antibodies are exclusively available in reference laboratories. a stool culture on selective media is the test of choice to detect enteric pathogens. different media (e.g. selective agar plates containing antibiotics and substances favouring the growth of the sought microorganism) are inoculated with a stool specimen to detect and isolate enteric pathogens. stool culture remains the diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard for enteric pathogenic bacteria disposing certain characteristics which enable them to be selected out of the normal gastrointestinal flora. other bacteria without such characteristics cannot be distinguished from apathogenic gut bacteria by culture methods alone. stool culture techniques remain mandatory to guide therapeutic interventions. novel molecular diagnostics are currently being developed and validated for many bacterial and viral pathogens. results obtained thus far are promising, but it remains to be elucidated whether such nucleic acid amplification tests can be employed on a larger scale in resource-constrained settings in the tropics. xin-producing strains may cause severe diarrhoea, which is most frequently seen in hospitalised patients who recently received antibiotic treatment. a selective stool culture followed by tests for toxin production remains the diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard for C. difficile. a laborious and technically difficult cell culture cytotoxicity assay is still regarded as an alternative reference standard. xigenic culture and PCR testing should always be performed when there is a high clinical suspicion despite negative test results. pathogenic E. coli strains that carry simultaneously virulence factors from different pathotypes may cause severe clinical outbreaks. pathogenic strains that carry simultaneously virulence factors from different pathotypes may cause severe clinical outbreaks. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria (e.g. M. avium) are an important cause of long-lasting diarrhoea and gastrointestinal complaints in HIV-infected individuals. culture is the most sensitive technique and remains the diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard. pulmonary tuberculosis has not been validated for gastrointestinal tuberculosis. a PCR assay targeting the genes whip1 and whip2 has been a major step forward. only highly specialised laboratories are able to grow T. whipplei on human fibroblast cells. inoculated media are usually incubated for 24\u201372 hours at 35\u00b0C at ambient atmosphere to allow the bacteria to form macroscopically visible colonies. the bacteria are isolated using different growth conditions, i.e. incubation at a higher temperature of 42\u00b0C in microaerophilic atmosphere. morphologically suspicious colonies are identified using different biochemical identification panels. there is no international consensus on immunological assays for detection of Campylobacter spp. and no globally validated and standardised approach. PCR assays, characterised by high sensitivity and specificity, have been developed for most of the aforementioned bacteria. however, integration into clinical routine testing is still limited. culturing blood and bone marrow is more sensitive, but bone marrow aspiration is only rarely performed in tropical areas due to a lack of adequately equipped hospitals and laboratories. PCR assays have been developed for different antigens of invasive S. enterica serovars, but still need further development before they can be more widely recommended. PCR can only prove the presence of the toxin-encoding gene, but cannot distinguish between acute infection and asymptomatic carriage. in clinical practice, an easily applicable two-step approach is recommended for rapid and reasonably sensitive diagnosis of C. difficile[109]. multiplex PCR assays targeting unique genes of EHEC/STEC, EIEC, EPEC and ETEC allow a rapid molecular characterisation of these pathogenic strains. these tests have overcome important drawbacks of the classical stool culture, which often detects only some important strains. culture is the most sensitive technique and remains the diagnostic \u2018gold\u2019 standard. different molecular biological assays have been developed for various mycobacteria. but lack sensitivity for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and have not been validated for gastrointestinal tuberculosis. microsporidia: intestinal protozoa Balantidium coli, Blastocystis hominis, Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis (syn.: Cystoisospora belli), species of microsporidia. microscopic detection of protozoan cysts and trophozo sensitive EIAs detecting species-specific antigens in faecal samples have been developed. for Cryptosporidium spp., E. histolytica and G. intestinalis, correct identification of intestinal protozoan pathogens is challenging even for experienced laboratory technicians and for some species even impossible. microscopic detection of protozoan cysts and trophozoites has been the most widely used diagnostic approach. a formalin-ether concentration technique lacks sensitivity for several intestinal protozoan species as well as many helminths. sensitive EIAs detecting species-specific antigens in faecal samples have been developed for Cryptosporidium spp., E. histolytica and G. intestinalis. many of these assays are highly sensitive and complement microscopic stool examination. direct microscopic examination is a cheap methodology. the microscope slides can rapidly be prepared for examination. microscopy remains the standard reference test for helminth species parasitising humans. microscopy results heavily depend on the quality of the slide preparation and on the experience of the laboratory technician reading the slides. the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis can rarely be found when using the aforementioned microscopy techniques, because its larvae already hatch in the intestine. most commonly employed are the Baermann funnel and the Koga agar plate. the technique is based on the nematode\u2019s hydrophily and thermophily. it provides results within a few hours and is the technique of choice according to the world gastroenterology Organization. immunological RDTs have been developed for detection of intestinal (S. mansoni) and urogenital schistosomiasis (S. haematobium) a single POC-CCA test is significantly more sensitive than a single Kato-Katz thick smear. ascaris lumbricoides, capillaria philippinensis, Diphyllobothrium spp., Hymenolepis spp., Taenia spp. and blood flukes (Schistosoma spp.) PCR assays are more sensitive than conventional parasitological and serological methods. presently, their use is restricted to specialised reference laboratories and research institutions outside endemic areas. microscopy is not very sensitive and especially infections of light intensity can be missed when only a single stool sample is analysed. multiple stool sampling, ideally over several consecutive days, increases the sensitivity [136], as well as the use of different concentration techniques. these techniques often require access to the power grid, a centrifuge and different chemical reagents. new molecular techniques, especially PCR assays, still need to be validated and further developed in different settings. disadvantages of current PCR tests are their high costs, risk of contamination, the need for high-technology laboratory equipment and constant electric power supply. a multiplex real-time PCR targeting a host of various pathogens is much more desirable than individual PCR assays for each parasite. the agar plates are stored for 48 hours in a humid chamber. the traces of the helminths can then be seen on the agar and the larvae can easily be collected for microscopic species identification. the recognition of strongyloidiasis and initiation of an effective treatment with ivermectin is essential to prevent potentially life-threatening events. circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) and circulating anodic antigen (CAA) can be detected in the serum and urine of S. mansoni-infected individuals using genus-specific monoclonal antibodies. a single POC-CCA test is considerably more sensitive than a single Kato-Katz thick smear. a concurrent S. haematobium infection does not influence the POC-CCA test results for S. manson diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis is based on virus isolation by cell culture, electron microscopy and rapid antigen tests. cell culture, electron microscopy and molecular-based methods require laboratories with sophisticated equipment, experienced staff and appropriate biosafety procedures. data on sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tools for virus identification in tropical settings are currently lacking. astrovirus eight serotypes of astrovirus are known. in childhood, astrovirus infection with serotypes 1 and 2 predominate. infection with the other serotypes occurs later in life (>4 years) calicivirus comprises two human-pathogenic genera, the norovirus and sapovirus [166] for both genera, virus isolation by cell culture is not possible. electron microscopy is rather insensitive and rarely detects the viruses if there are fewer than 106 viral particles/ml of stool suspension. enterovirus Enterovirus Enteroviruses belong to the family picornaviridae and comprise enterovirus group A to D [172] in general, enteroviruses can cause a broad spectrum of different clinical entities. Virus typing after isolation is traditionally accomplished by virus neutralisation. antigen detection by EIA methods is the current standard procedure for the rapid diagnosis of rotavirus infection. these assays are able to detect virus particles even if their concentration is below 104 particles/ml stool suspension. Molecular methods are also available [176,177]. astrovirus eight serotypes of astrovirus are known. in childhood, astrovirus infection with serotypes 1 and 2 predominate. infection with the other serotypes occurs later in life. viral shedding occurs for 14\u201370 hours but may be prolonged. calicivirus The family comprises two human-pathogenic genera, the norovirus and sapovirus [166]. for both genera, virus isolation by cell culture is not possible. Electron microscopy is rather insensitive and rarely detects the viruses if there are fewer than 106 viral particles/ml of stool suspension. the relevance of coronavirus as a true human enteric pathogen is unclear. conventional virus isolation by cell culture can be done on human embryonal tracheal cells. antigen tests for stool samples are not available for coronavirus. serological methods for the detection of enterovirus-specific antibodies are exclusively available in reference laboratories and cannot be used for rapid diagnosis. human rotavirus Rotavirus infection alone is believed to account for 453,000 deaths annually in children younger than 5 years. diagnostic work-up should include bacterial stool cultures on different selective media. microscopic examination of unstained (e.g. direct faecal smear, Kato-Katz thick smear and formalin ether-concentration method) and stained microscope slides (acid-fast stains) research must address all pathogen classes and should not be limited to one-dimensional approaches examining either bacteria or parasites only. this is of particular importance when different potential pathogens are found concurrently in one faecal specimen and the causative one(s) have to be differentiated. this is of particular importance when different potential pathogens are found concurrently in one faecal specimen. the NIDIAG consortium focuses on digestive disorders as discussed here, as well as on neurological disorders [23] and persistent fever [24]. such investigations will optimise the use of existing diagnostic tests and advance the development of new methods. all authors contributed to the manuscript, read and approved the final version. financial support This work is part of the NIDIAG network (Collaborative Project; http://www.nidiag.org) supported by the European Commission under the Health Cooperation Work Programme of the 7th Framework Programme."}
