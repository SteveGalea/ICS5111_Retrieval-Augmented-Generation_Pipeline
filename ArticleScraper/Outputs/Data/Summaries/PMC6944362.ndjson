{"summary": "people go through a complex process of collecting information, deciding what to do, and communicating with others about the effectiveness of their actions. social influence may interfere with personal experiences, making peer groups and group interactions important factors. good responsive and preventive strategies at both the individual and government levels are vital for saving lives. the method is widely used to analyze epidemics [14\u201317]. it integrates micro-macro relationships while accommodating agents\u2019 heterogeneity and their adaptive behavior. the core of a disease ABM lies in defining the learning methods that steer these two processes. the impact of individual vs group learning in groups is an under-explored domain in the development of ABMs of socio-environmental systems. the impact of individual vs group learning on a decision-making process in ABMs enhanced with ML is an under-explored domain in the development of ABMs. the article aims to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) What is the impact of social interactions on the perceptions and decisions of intelligent individuals facing a risk. we advance the existing cholera ABM (CABM) originally developed to study cholera diffusion [35]. the open-source code for the model code is available online. CABM is grounded in the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) in psychology [23,38]. household agents with high incomes do not take a risk and will buy safe water. the risk perception was updated using BN1, which depends on the agent memory (Me), the visual pollution at the water fetching point (VP) and the evidence of the severity of the epidemic based on communication from the media. a complex network approach illustrates the gradual processes from individual to collective learning in CABM. each stage is presented as a single network over which a given learning process spreads. each network in Fig 3 had the same set of nodes and connections to show how different processes can lead to different outcomes in the same network structure. agents in the group share the same decision, but the information on which this decision is based on varies considerably. individuals and groups may learn by either taking information from their social networks (i.e., have it as an additional source of information in their ML algorithms) or not. in isolated learning, agents learn independently within their groups, without exchanging any information with each other or with their neighbors. process 2b shows a situation in which individual household agents make decisions that account for interactions in their social networks. each household conducts a majority vote, allowing it to proceed with the option chosen by the majority of its members. the decisions of group leaders are adopted by the household agent. individual uses ML to update her risk perception and take protective actions based on her individual experience. RP&CA (D-I) RP and CA (BN1 & BN2) Majority vote (D) (decentralized group) Isolated (I) All agents in a group use ML to make decisions taking the experience of others into account. a group vote to evaluate the final risk perception for all group members. they run BN2 while considering past experience of others. each group randomly chooses a leader who uses ML to decide whether the disease risk is real. we ran a survey via a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Geohealth in two rounds (2016 and 2017) to gain data on individual behavior. participants were introduced to the problem of cholera disease, saw pictures of water, and were asked if they would use the water as it is (D1 in Fig 1) or use the water after boiling it (D3). CABM is an empirically and theoretically grounded model developed to study the 2005 cholera outbreak in Kumasi, Ghana. the open-source code for the model code is available online. CABM is grounded in the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) in psychology [23,38]. exposure to cholera takes place through the use of unsafe river water. agents can influence their exposure by selecting alternative water sources. they can either reduce exposure to zero or have no effect on infection risk. a complex network approach illustrates gradual processes from individual to collective learning in CABM. each stage is presented as a single network over which a given learning process spreads. each network in Fig 3 had the same set of nodes and connections to show how different processes can lead to different outcomes in the same network structure. group learning can be realized by introducing a single agent (leader) who uses ML to learn for the whole group to help it accomplish its group task (centralized) both individuals and groups may learn by either taking information from their social networks (i.e., have it as an additional source of information in their ML algorithms) a group\u2019s decision can be influenced by information retrieved from neighbors inside the group and neighbors outside the group but inside the community. each household conducts a majority vote, allowing it to proceed with the option chosen by the majority of its members. each agent group randomly chooses a leader who uses ML to make a decision. the leaders decide in isolation without communicating with others. the leaders decide in isolation without communicating with others. RP (BN1) as in M6 CA (BN2) as in M2 RP: Majority vote (D) (decentralized group) CA: Individual (In) Taking the experience of others into account, all agents in a group use BN1 to decide on disease risks. each group randomly chooses a leader who uses ML to decide whether the disease risk is real (RP) two communities in our dataset (#11 and #20) hosted only high-income households. each simulation was run for 90 days with a time step equal to one hour. participants were introduced to the problem of cholera disease, saw pictures of water, and were asked if they would use the water as it is (D1 in Fig 1). models M1 \u2013 M8 measured in terms of run time and the number of intelligent decision steps, i.e. when agents called their BN1 and/or BN2. the average and standard deviation of the results of these runs for each output measure were listed in Table 3. Output measures of the eight scenarios. RP(C-N), CA (In-N) Mean** 75 2,107* 37 136 44 462 0.75 SD 0.64 129 1.6 22 1.2 221 (*) representing 57% of total infected cases. behavioural changes can lead to different duration times of the epidemic. uses centralized learning for risk perception and individual interactive learning for coping appraisal, reported the fewest infected cases (2,107 against 1,621 in reality) this was followed by M2 (individual social learning) with 2,279 cases and M1 (individual isolated learning) with 2,457 occurrences. centralized groups had a less negative impact compared to decentralized ones. the number of agents that were supposed to go for risk perception daily was 15% of the total number of household agents. over the 90 days of the epidemic, 114,750 agents appraised their risk perception (using their BN1) over the 90 days of the epidemic, 114,750 agents appraised their risk perception (using their BN1) over the 90 days of the epidemic, 114,750 agents appraised their risk perception (using their BN1). the average number of agents with risk perception per simulated day was high (410 agents), there were only 6,840 steps in risk perception and the same number of steps when coping appraisal MLs were activated. M5 and M6 recorded the fewest steps across all models. group members individually assessed the coping appraisal (26,370 steps in M8 vs 6,840 steps in M5 and M6). first the hydrological sub-model was calibrated, followed by a calibration of the complete model [35]. to calibrate a scenario further, one would need risk perception data for that area for the duration of the epidemic. curve in M1 (In-I) is higher than M2 (In-N), leading to 11% more cases of disease. when the epidemic was at its peak, household agents in M1 responded very slowly, with BN1 delivering a wrong evaluation of risk perception. when the epidemic vanished, the number of agents with risk perception = 1 kept increasing. Fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of decision types over the study area in both M1 (In-I) and M2 (In-N) household agents in isolated learning were not aware of the cholera-infected cases in their neighbors\u2019 household. despite the same peak heights, the epidemic curves in the majority voting scenarios reported more infected cases than the other models. risk perception slowly grew when the epidemic was peaking (Fig 5c, 5d and 5e) and did not react to the peak in any way, which is unrealistic. majority voting led to unsecured decisions. household agents had different levels of exposure to the group members with which they voted. majority voting led to unsecured decisions. household agents in the middle-income level switched to boiling water or buying bottled water. those in the low-income level walked to another water fetching point (D2). 3.3 Impact of leaders (M5, M6, and M8) In centralized groups, one household agent is randomly selected to be the group leader. it is argued that group leaders may improve their performance if they model the responses to the situation the group faces. Isolated dictators in M5 are overestimated disease risks. if such a leader had his/her own bad experience with cholera, s/he would keep warning the group. centralized decisions making undermines heterogeneity in individual circumstances. Fig 8c shows the spatial distribution of different types of decisions. more household agents went for D3 and D4, which were considered to be the most protective decisions. making decisions individually does not pay off (M1 vs M2). household agents in M2 behaved according to the expected pattern. risk perception became amplified by media coverage and social interactions. only those who experienced cholera infection in households remained alert. majority vote is imperfect (M3, M4, and M7) in decentralized learning, groups of household agents vote for risk perception and coping appraisal. the final decision of the group is the output of the majority votes. this leads to an increase in the randomization of decentralized learning models. risk perception peaked when there was no longer a risk, i.e., in the last days of the simulation, as shown in Table 3. household agents ignored early signals of disease that occurred in just a few households. then they increased their awareness about risk only when most of them were already infected. the size of the pie represents the size of household agents with risk perception = 1. a majority vote forced low-income households to buy bottled water. a majority vote forced households to buy bottled water. a dictator making top-down decision about risk perception and coping strategy (M5 and M6) and an opinion leader evaluating risk perception top-down. the centralized group learning represented the processes well, as the leader alerted the group members about the disease. we cannot determine which of the models M5, M6, and M8 is the best. centralized decisions making undermines heterogeneity in individual circumstances, such as disease exposure or coping capacity. the size of the pie represents the size of household agents with risk perception = 1. 3.3.2 As an opinion leader (M8). Isolated dictators in M5 are overestimated disease risks. if such a leader had his/her own bad experience with cholera, s/he would keep warning the group. centralized decisions making undermines heterogeneity in individual circumstances. Fig 8c shows the spatial distribution of different types of decisions during the simulation. more household agents went for D3 and D4, which were considered to be the most protective decisions. however, communities pursued at least three types of decisions. in our simulation experiments, the structure of the groups is simple and is formed based on the spatial and socio-demographic characteristics of the agents. a careful evaluation of the social structures in the case study area should be conducted to generate trustworthy results. different political systems, the presence of tribes, and different ethnic groups or religious leaders require careful consideration of the social interactions in a model. in this article, it was not possible to define, which implementation (M1 \u2013M8) represented the situation in Kumasi most closely. however, such data are very scarce, not only for Kumasi but worldwide. that human behavior toward vaccination can change radically based on (fake) news it. including these factors and testing their impact on the behavior of agents may lead to more conclusions for policymakers to consider."}
