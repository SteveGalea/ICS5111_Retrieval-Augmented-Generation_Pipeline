NLR family are activated by specific bacterial peptides [44], similar to dengue [45] and RSV [46]. current observations with PBMCs need to be extended to hepatocytes. we could identify several GO terms specific to subclinical HEV infection when compared to NPR controls. a single pregnant woman with fulminant hepatitis E showed downregulation of defensin and S100 genes. at recovery defensin expression increased while that of S100 remained low. this observation of lowered innate immune response needs to be confirmed with a large series. antiviral activity through potentiation of neutralizing antibody response adds to possible mechanisms of alpha defensins-dependent immunity. response to vitamin D was uniquely associated with subclinical infection during 2nd trimester. CD1d alone was detected in self-recovering PR patients during the acute phase and was part of pregnancy-associated immunomodulation. in a transgenic HBV transfer mouse model, induction of acute hepatitis was mediated by CD1D-restricted immune response. for RSV, LCMV, CMV and HSV1, a beneficial effect was seen. the concordance in the expression at gene and protein levels emphasizes definite role of IFN in recovery even from fulminant disease. further studies are needed to explore the role / utility of this gene/molecule in modulation /treatment of severe disease. ical clustering of selected 384 immune-related genes identified as differentially regulated in early acute non-pregnant patients. the rows represent m RNA quantitation data (log2 transformed fold change) and the columns represent the RNA samples isolated from PBMCs. increased expression of specific genes is illustrated by red and green, respectively, while black indicates no change. significantly altered genes in acute (NPR-acute) and convalescent (NPR-conv) phase patients with HEV infection with pair-wise comparison with non-pregnant healthy controls (NPR-control).
