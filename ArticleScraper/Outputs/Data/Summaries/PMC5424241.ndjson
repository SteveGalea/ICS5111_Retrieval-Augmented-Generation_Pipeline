{"summary": "in developing countries, virulent NDV can cause mortality at rates as high as 80% among village flocks. in developing countries, virulent NDV can cause mortality at rates as high as 80% among village flocks. infections by lentogenic strains are rare but clinical signs associated with infections by lentogenic strains are nonspecific. clinical signs associated with infections by lentogenic strains are nonspecific and include ruffled feathers, anorexia, decreased egg production, and respiratory infection in birds with a compromised immune system. trachea is an ideal tissue to examine, as this is one of the initial sites of interaction with the virus. previous studies have shown that resistance to NDV has a genetic basis (22\u201325) lachrymal fluid was collected from each chicken prior to infection, at 2 days postinfection (dpi) and at 6 dpi for viral quantification. no NDV was detected in any of the birds prior to challenge or in any of the nonchallenged birds at all times. at 6 dpi, the Fayoumis had significantly less virus than the Leghorns. at 10 dpi, data are for 8 challenged Fayoumi chickens, 13 challenged Leghorn chickens, 6 nonchallenged Fayoumi chickens, and 8 nonchallenged Leghorn chickens (total n = 35) the ELISA sample-to-positive ratios at 10 dpi were significantly different (P = 0.0007) between the challenged and nonchallenged birds. the least-square means of the counts per million are shown for the challenged Fayoumis (n = 4) and Leghorns (n = 5). Error bars represent standard deviation of the means. the connecting letters report was generated with a Student t test. the responses of challenged and nonchallenged birds within each line were compared at each time point in the experiment. as time progressed, there were fewer differentially expressed genes (DE) between the challenged and nonchallenged birds in both lines. overall, more genes were upregulated than downregulated (Fig. 3). whole-blood cells were the most enriched cell type for both lines. at 6 dpi, the lines were the most dissimilar, which corresponds to the difference in DEG numbers. the results suggested a conserved response between the two lines. for all genes, the absolute LFC was >1 and the FDR was 0.05. contrasts were clustered by similarity on the basis of genes (blue text) that were upregulated (red), downregulated (green), or not DE (gray) in the challenged relative to the nonchallenged chickens. this pathway was activated in all contrasts (orange), as predicted by IPA. several key pathways were significantly activated at all time points in both lines. iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-B signaling, role of the nuclear factor of activated T cells in regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. these conserved pathways may be inherently crucial to the chicken's response to NDV in the trac the total number of genes in each pathway is found at the top of each bar. the orange lines represent the log(P value) of each pathway. the orange lines represent the log(P value of each pathway. direct comparison of the Fayoumis and Leghorns at 2 dpi gave more insight into the pathways and genes associated with resistance. the number of DEG between the Fayoumis and Leghorns was higher in the challenged birds than the nonchallenged birds. the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling pathway had the highest positive Z-score (Fig. 8) the height of each bar corresponds to the log(P value) associated with each pathway. the lower the transparency of each bar's fill is, the higher absolute value that the Z-score is. a contrast was written to compare the interaction between challenge and line at each time point. polypeptide, linker protein for immunoglobulin alpha and mu polypeptide precursors RefSeq peptide NP_989594 ENSGALT00000034032 5.11 0.00046 6 Uncharacterized protein UniProtKB/TrEMBL F1NSC7 ENSGALT0000009519 4.69 0.00052 6 Ig lambda chain V-1 region UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot P04210 ENSGALT0000009564 4.

IPA predicted the activation of actin cytoskeleton contraction and cell mobility. leukocytes use actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction for movement. if migrating cells become infected, a conundrum may be created. all birds succumbed to infection with velogenic NDV. the mean survival time was longer for the Fayoumis than the Leghorns at all four doses tested. as the time postinfection increased, the numbers of DEG between challenged and nonchallenged birds decreased. integrin signaling was more highly activated in the Leghorns than the Fayoumis. the impact of collagen was shown in two separate contrasts. the downregulation of collagen between challenged and nonchallenged Fayoumis gives more confidence in the importance of collagen at 2 dpi. chicken stem cells underwent rounds of selection with high titers of the La Sota strain. levels of expression of these selected cells led to increased levels of apoptosis and decreased neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction compared to those in the unselected cells. trachea transcriptome exposed potential key mechanisms of host resistance to NDV. the methods used in the present study were approved by the Iowa State University IACUC. Fayoumi (M 15.2) and Leghorn (GHs 6) chicken lines from Iowa State University Poultry Farm (Ames, IA) each have an inbreeding coefficient of >99.9%. the virus suspension was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until its use. at 21 days of age, half of the chickens were inoculated with 200 l of 107 EID50 of La Sota NDV. chickens that received the virus are referred to as \u201cchallenged\u201d blood samples collected prechallenge and at 10 dpi were centrifuged at 15 rpm for 5 min to collect the serum supernatant. the sample-to-positive ratio was calculated by subtracting the negative-control value from the average absorption value for each sample. the positive and negative controls were supplied with the Idexx kit. log copy number per 1 l of isolated viral RNA was calculated for the mean for each sample, which was run in duplicate. the log copy number of the NDV genome does not show the number of infectious particles. the quality of all samples was validated using the Fragment Analyzer. the Discovery Environment of iPlant Collaborative (54) was used for data processing. 80% of all base pairs within a read had a Phred quality score of 30 or higher. the six major contrasts were written to determine the significance of the interaction between line and challenge at each time. the differentially expressed genes identified in either chicken line were 1,688, 965, and 180 DEG at 2, 6, and 10 dpi, respectively. trachea is a heterogeneous tissue composed of multiple cell populations that likely change under different treatment conditions. transcript identifiers of the DEG (FDR 0.05) for each of the six major contrasts were converted into their associated gene names using BioMart software. the six gene lists were then input into the CTen database (60) the 48.48 integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) for a total of 2,304 sample gene tests. the genes were chosen to represent the range of log fold changes. not all genes were DE. the Fayoumi line originated from the Fayoum region of Egypt. the Leghorn line is representative of chickens from the U.S. egg-laying industry of the 1950s. at 21 days of age, half of the chickens were given access to water and feed. the nonchallenged group (2 rooms, n = 40) was given 200 l of 107 EID50 of La Sota NDV. the nonchallenged group was given 200 l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio was calculated by subtracting the negative-control value from the average absorption value for each sample. the positive and negative controls were supplied with the Idexx kit. a standard least-squares, effect leverage analysis in JMP (JMP Group Inc., San Francisco, CA) included the main effects of line, treatment, and line treatment. RNA was isolated from the tracheal epithelial cells using an RNAqueous kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) samples were then treated with DNase using a DNA-free kit (thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) the quality of all samples was validated using the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Ankeny, IA) the Illumina TruSeq adapter was recognized as an overrepresented sequence in some samples. for consistency, the adapter sequence and the individual multiplexing index were removed from all samples using the FASTX Clipper program. the remaining high-quality reads were used as input for the topHat2 aligner (55) for alignment to the Galgal4 reference genome. contrasts were written to determine the significance of the interaction between line and challenge at each time. the cpm was calculated by taking the number of reads that aligned to each viral gene. there was no statistically significant difference between the number of unmapped reads in the challenged Leghorns and Fayoumis at 2 dpi. identifiers of transcripts unrecognized by IPA were converted to a recognized identifier using biomart software. the genes used for pathway analysis had an FDR of 0.05 and an absolute log2 fold change (LFC) of >1, as estimated by the edgeR package. a total of 9.5% of the data, including those for four genes, were excluded. the correlation between the RNA-seq-generated LFC and the fluidigm Biomark HD system-generated LFC was determined."}
