{"summary": "osteoarthritis is characterized by bone marrow ischemia and cell death. CS is the most common cause of non-traumatic ON (3). at early stage, the patient may be asymptomatic but eventually pain and limitation of movements may develop. phospholipid antibodies and hypercoagulable profile were measured in all cases. patients were recruited from rheumatology clinic of a major referral teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran. complete blood count, lipid panel, anti-phospholipid antibodies and hypercoagulable profile were measured in all cases. femoral heads were targeted for ON screening purposes as they comprise the most frequent sites for CS-inducedtarting CS dose. the occurrence of ON was not correlated with the disease of the patient (p=0.3) the meanSD duration of steroid therapy was 4.7 1.6 months (range 2\u20138 months) and the meanSD starting CS dose was 41.9 9.4 mg (range 30-60 mg) a study on 539 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) taking high-dose steroid reported ON in 176 patients (32.7%) (3). occurrence of ON was about 15% among patients with multiple sclerosis (9) a survey on 337 patients revealed that high dose of steroid > 40 mg/day imposed a remarkably higher risk for ON than dose 40mg/day (17). different study population and ON stages (silent/symptomatic) might be the cause of variables in researches."}
