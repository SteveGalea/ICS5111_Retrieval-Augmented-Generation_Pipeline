{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA) it causes significant economic loss to the equine industry in the united states and other countries (2\u20138) in 10 to 70% of infected stallions shedding can continue for many years or even the remainder of the animal's lifetime (2\u20134, 18, 24\u201327). persistently infected stallions play a major epidemiological role since they constitute the natural reservoir for EAV and are responsible for the maintenance and perpetuation of EAV in equine populations. a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by this laboratory revealed that the ability of EAV to infect CD3+ T lymphocytes is strongly associated with four nucleotide changes in the CXCL16 gene located on equine chromosome 11 (41, 42) this is the first demonstration of a correlation between a viral carrier state and a host genetic component. however, it necessitates identification of the sites of viral persistence within the stallion reproductive tract and we have combined virus isolation, insulated isothermal reverse transcription-PCR (RT-iiPCR), single and dual immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) techniques to unequivocally demonstrate EAV tissue and cellular localization in the stallion reproductive tract during persistent infection. the peak for both nasal shedding and viremia occurred at a median of 6 dpi. the clearance of virus from blood mononuclear cells coincided with the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. all stallions seroconverted starting from 8 dpi. b Viral titers in semen correspond to ejaculates obtained by 726 dpi with exception of stallion E. values represent days postinfection (dpi) NA, not applicable; ND, not determined. two out of 8 experimentally infected stallions continued to shed EAV in their semen for 726 dpi (i.e., long-term persistently infected stallions) the remaining stallions shed virus in their semen for a variable period of time after experimental infection. EAV was isolated from several tissues of the reproductive tract of long-term persistently infected stallions. infectious virus could be recovered from either one or both vesicular glands in persistently infected stallions. infectivity titers were approximately 100-fold lower than those observed in the ampullae. three long-term persistently infected stallions failed to yield virus. virus was not isolated from any body tissues, including the reproductive tract. stallions stopped shedding virus in their semen during the course of the study. EAV antigen-positive lymphocytes were either present in inflammatory infiltrates or scattered in the lamina propria of the ampullae. some EAV-positive cells were large and resembled macrophages. the ampullae contained the highest number of EAV antigen-positive cells. EAV antigen-positive lymphocytes (arrowheads) were observed in close association with the glandular epithelium. rare stromal cells positive for EAV antigen (arrowheads) were observed. bars, 100 m (A, C, and D) and 50 m (B) EAV antigen-positive lymphocytes were identified by the expression of the T lymphocyte markers CD2, CD3, CD5 (data not shown) and CD8 (Fig. 4) and by the expression of the B lymphocyte marker CD21 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, viral antigen was not detected in CD4+ T lymphocytes or tissue macrophages and dendritic cells expressing either CD163 or Iba-1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1). electron-dense, spherical particles consistent with EAV virion morphology were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in thin sections from the ampullae of long-term persistently infected stallions. vesicles containing viral particles were observed in lymphocytes localized within inflammatory infiltrates. smaller particles ranging from 42 to 46 nm were also observed. stallion (L139) stopped shedding EAV in semen. stallion had fibrous adhesions between the tunica albuginea of the testis and the tunica vaginalis. a unilateral varicose pampiniform plexus and a unilateral suppurative epididymitis. microscopic findings included unilateral or bilateral, minimal lymphoplasmacytic orchitis and epididymitis with occasional perivascular cuffs and rare hemosiderophages. mild lymphoplasmacytic adenitis of bulbourethral glands with occasional foci of inflammatory cells. inflammatory lesions were infrequent in vesicular glands and prostate. CD3 immunostaining in cryosections from this tissue using a monoclonal antibody to CD3 (LN10) and a Bond polymer Refine Detection kit (inset, IHC with DAB) rare foci of mononuclear cells were present. IHC staining was performed using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific to macrophage markers. moderate numbers of foamy macrophages infiltrated the lamina propria of the ampullae. inflammatory response in the ampullae was further characterized by IHC. CD21+ B lymphocytes comprised of low numbers of CD2+, CD3+, and CD5+ T lymphocytes. CD21+ B lymphocytes were either absent or rare in this group. o Chemicals; 48 MHC-II CR3/43 IHC Dako; 117 Calprotectin/L1 MAC387 IHC AbD Serotec; 56 Epithelial and mesenchymal cells Pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 IFA eBioscience; 118 Vimentin V9 IFA eBioscience; IFA, immunofluorescent antibody staining. for CD25, immunohistochemical scoring is as follows: no specific positive cells; +/, rare presence of positive cells; +, 30 positive cells; +++, 31\u201380 positive cells; +++, 81\u2013200 positive cells; ++++, >200 positive cells. a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to tissue macrophages and dendritic cells was used for immunohistochemical characterization of these cells in response to EAV infection. macrophages, dendritic cells, microglial cells, especially during activated state. scavenger receptors CD163 and CD204 highly expressed in macrophages. calprotectin/L1, a marker for activation of macrophages shortly after recruitment from peripheral blood.

Glandular epithelial cells (cytokeratin positive) did not contain detectable amounts of EAV N protein despite the intimate association of EAV-infected intra- and subepithelial lymphocytes with the reproductive epithelium. this close association suggests that infectious virus may gain access to seminal fluid via these infected lymphocytes simply migrating across the glandular epithelium. EAV N antigen is readily detectable in vascular endothelial cells from small blood vessels. this resulted in an extensive panvasculitis, a hallmark of the acute phase of EAV infection. however, no other microscopic lesions except lymphoplasmacytic inflammation are associated with the carrier state. at present, the mechanisms that determine these differences are unknown. local immune suppression is likely to be enhanced by the strong influence of androgens in reproductive tissue homeostasis (85), which may also explain EAV's dependence on androgenic hormones during persistent infection. stromal cells expressing EAV undergo antigenic drift (26, 30) during the course of persistent infection in carrier stallions that could contribute to immune evasion. gen and containing viral RNA were detectable in semen for variable periods of time after the cessation of infectious virus shedding (86, 87) similar findings have also been reported in the case of other persistent viral infections such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (88\u201390) analysis of expression of CXCL16S and its unique receptor (CXCR6) in different cell types within the reproductive tract of carrier stallions is under way in this laboratory. in humans and mice, CXCL16 is expressed in a variety of cell types in different tissues and under different disease conditions (e.g., inflammation or neoplasia) high-passage-number rabbit kidney 13 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) with 10% ferritin-supplemented calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), penicillin and streptomycin (100 U/ml and 100 g/ml, respectively), and 0.25 g/ml of amphotericin B (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) the modified live virus (MLV) vaccine strain of EAV (ARVAC; Pfizer Animal Health, Inc., Kalamazoo, MI) was used as the challenge virus in the virus neutralization assay described below. stallions were humanely euthanized by pentobarbital overdose. the control group (stallions N105, N121, O103, and O113) remained unexposed and unvaccinated against EAV. serum, whole blood, and nasopharyngeal swabs collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 726 (preeuthanasia) days postinfection. nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. plasma and buffy coat cells were aspirated and placed in a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube. cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of EMEM and stored at 80\u00b0C. both right and left sides were sampled in case of paired organs. tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and paraffin embedded according to standard histological procedures. tissue specimens were placed in a plastic cryo-mold covered with O.C.T. compound. the designations proximal and distal are in reference to the relative distance to the inguinal ring, with proximal being closer to it. other body tissues were collected and examined. inflammatory lesions received a cumulative score based on their severity and distribution. the distribution was scored as follows: 0, negative; 1, focal (1 focus per tissue section); 2, rare foci (2 foci per tissue section); 3, occasional foci (3 to 4 foci per tissue section); and 5, diffuse. snap-frozen tissue sections (10 m) were mounted on positively charged Superfrost Plus slides. slides were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min and processed with a leica bond-Max automated staining system. sections were washed with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) and incubated with specific MAbs against CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD21, CD83, CD86. sections were counterstained and mounted as previously described.
