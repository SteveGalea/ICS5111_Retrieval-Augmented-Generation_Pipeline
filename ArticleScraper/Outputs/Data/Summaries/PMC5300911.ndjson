{"summary": "sex, age, neonatal history, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, heart rate, respiratory rate, the presence of fever, total duration of fever, oxygen saturation, laboratory parameters. results The study comprised 279 young children. of these, 26 had a chest radiograph revealing opacity (n=24) or atelectasis (n=2) a survey of clinical practices in the diagnosis and management of 17,397 children with bronchiolitis reported that 72% of them received chest radiographs6. there are several studies demonstrating that the majority of these chest radiographies done on children with bronchiolitis were read as negative. however, there are only 3 studies in the literature reporting risk factors for radiographic abnormalities among young children with bronchiolitis7,9,10. 279 young children were admitted with bronchiolitis during the study period. the study included sex, age, presence or absence of fever, laboratory data, and previous hospitalization for respiratory illnesses. a second senior staff radiologist read the initial 279 radiographs to confirm the expert reading. nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected at the time of hospitalization by carefully irrigating the young child's nostrils with sterile saline solution. total viral RNA was obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (300 L) by utilizing Viral Gene-spin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kits (iNtRON, seongnam, Korea) the reactions underwent 40 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 90 seconds at 60\u00b0C, and extension for 90 seconds at 72\u00b0C. the amplified specimens were analyzed on 2% agarose gels comprised of 0.5-g/mL ethidium bromide. hs-CRP>0.3 mg/dL, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a history of admission for respiratory illnesses, chest retraction, and wheezes were categorical variables. all statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS statistics ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) 279 young children were included in the study. clinical factors collected at the time of admission included sex, age, presence or absence of fever, laboratory data, and previous hospitalization for respiratory illnesses. all subjects underwent routine chest X-ray; blood samples were taken from subjects. total viral RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (300 L) using Viral Gene-spin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kits (iNtRON, seongnam, Korea) first-strand cDNA was manufactured by implementing Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kits (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) the chest radiographic findings were divided into benign or pathologic groups17. the findings were consistent with uncomplicated bronchiolitis. the sample size was assessed for a 95% confidence interval (CI) a history of admission for respiratory illnesses, chest retraction, and wheezes were categorical variables. all statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS statistics ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) a history of admission for respiratory illnesses was categorical variables. 4) were significantly higher in children with pathologic chest radiographic findings (n=26) than in those with benign chest radiographic findings (n=253) P value Male sex 9 (34.6) 105 (41.5) 0.49 Age under 3 months 3 (11.5) 43 (17.0) 0.58 Birth weight (g) 3.3 (3.2\u20133.5) 3.2 (3.0\u20133.5) 0.72 Birth height (cm) 49.5 (48.4\u201350.0) 48.8 (47.5\u201350.0) 0.67 history of admission due to respiratory illness 8 (30.8) 28 (11.1) 0.004 Chest retraction 2 (7.7) 39 (15.4) 0.28 Wheeze 12 (46.2) 137 (54.2) 0.43 White blood cell (/mm3) 9,860.0 (8,150.0\u201313,330.0) 10,410.0 (8,190.0\u201313,820.0) 0.59 Total eosinophil count (cells/mm3) 21 (0\u2013176) 96 (0\u2013246) 0.31 Virus detected 14 hs-CRP levels were a sensitivity of 80.8% (95% CI, 60.7\u201393.5), specificity of 48.5% (95% CI, 42.5\u201354.6), positive predictive value of 13.0% (95% CI, 8.3\u201319.2) and negative predictive value of 96.4% (95% CI, 91.7\u201398.8) for predicting pathologic chest radiographic findings. general characteristics of the study subjects The study population consisted of 279 children. the median age of the children was 8 months. only 26 of 279 children (9.3%) had pathologic chest radiographic findings on chest radiograph.
