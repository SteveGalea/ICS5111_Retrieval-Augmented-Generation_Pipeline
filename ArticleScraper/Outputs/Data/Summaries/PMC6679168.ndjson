{"summary": "four influenza virus types have been identified to date. type A is known to infect humans, as well as porcine, bovine and canine species. the main reservoir of the influenza A viruses is aquatic birds. HA, NA, and M2 are type I, type II, and type III membrane proteins. a layer of matrix protein 1 (M1) just underneath the membrane is the most abundant protein of the virus. IAV encodes 10\u201311 proteins: HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, PA, PB1, PB2, NS1, NS2, and PB1-F2. type A is known to infect humans, as well as porcine, bovine and canine species. the main reservoir of the influenza A viruses are aquatic birds. the seasonal flu caused by influenza A virus (IAV) in humans is a respiratory illness that is among the top ten leading causes of death in the united states. IAV and IBV have eight negative-sense RNA segments, each encoding one or two viral proteins. ICV and IDV consist of only seven gene segments each, and they do not encode envelope glycoproteins HA and NA. instead, they carry only one glycoprotein, HEF (haemagglutinin\u2013esterase fusion), which is unique to flu B. AM2 forms an acid-activated proton channel with an asymmetrical preference of proton conduction from the viral exterior (N-terminus) to the interior (C-terminus) the proton channel activity of AM2 is essential for two important roles. the channel activity of AM2 is crucial during viral maturation. functional motifs HxxxW (in AM2 and BM2) and YxxxK (in CM2 and DM2) are indicated in bold red font. other residues surrounding this motif also contribute to the dynamics and proton transfer equilibria in the channel. AM2 is essential for virus uncoating in the endosome and for pH equilibration between Golgi lumen and cytoplasm during virus protein transport. BM2 has only a small ectodomain [41,42] (Figure 1). the closed Trp41 tetrad dehydrates the His37 tetrad and raises the His37 deprotonation barrier. at a low pH, the positive charge increases and the Trp41 gate and the C-terminal helices open and become more hydrated. this lowers the His37 deprotonation barrier, increasing proton conductance. the His37 tetrad changes protonation state at a low pH. the gate opens due to the electrostatic repulsion between the biprotonated, positively charged histidine residues. the gate opens due to the electrostatic repulsion between the biprotonated, positively charged histidine residues. new single-molecule fluorescence experiments have detected interhelical motion in AM2 on a microsecond timescale. this is consistent with the proton conduction rate, and increased from a high to low pH with a transition midpoint in the range of those reported for the pKa of the His37 tetrad [81]. this is consistent with a range of studies that show that the AM2 tetramer is more dynamic at a low pH. this was attributed to the presence of a second titratable histidine, His27. this residue was suggested to increase the proton-dissociation rate of His19. this was confirmed by a two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) electrophysiological assay in Xenopus oocytes. asp44 stabilizes the AM2 proton channel via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. oocytes are subjected to low pHin and high pHout conditions. no outward current in the AM2 proton channel is observed. AM2 monomer consists of an N-terminal ectodomain (residues 1\u201324), an -helical (TM) domain (residues 25\u201346), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain (residues 47\u201397) that contains a highly conserved amphipathic helix (residues 51\u201359) AM2 has conserved HxxxW functional motif in its TM domain. his37 is responsible for proton selectivity and acid activation. other residues surrounding this motif also contribute to the dynamics and proton transfer equilibria in the channel. AM2 and BM2 share almost no sequence identity, with exception of an HxxxW motif in the TM domain. AM2 contains disulfide bonds and is palmitoylated and phosphorylated. BM2 is essential for virus uncoating in the endosome and for pH equilibration. protons rapidly diffuse to the His37 tetrad via an ordered water cluster. at a low pH, the positive charge increases and the Trp41 gate and the C-terminal helices open and become more hydrated. this lowers the His37 deprotonation barrier, increasing proton conductance. pKa value ranges from 4.9 to 6.6 depending on membrane composition. deprotonation of the His37 tetrad triggers a change back to the Cclosed conformation [55,68]. his37\u2013water proton exchange rate appears to be too fast to account for this (105 s1) [54], and additional factors may account for the low rate of proton conduction. recent single-molecule fluorescence experiments have detected interhelical motion in AM2 on a microsecond timescale, which is consistent with the proton conduction rate. pKa values of the tetrad in BM2 TM domain in lipid bilayers were found to be one pH unit lower than the pKa values of the AM2-equivalent His37 tetrad. this was attributed to the presence of a second titratable histidine, His27 (in the position occupied by Arg45 in AM2), separated by three residues from Trp23, forming a putative reverse WxxxH the tetrad forms a gate that physically occludes the C-terminal end of the pore, while Asp44 stabilizes the gate via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. oocytes are subjected to low pHin and high pHout conditions, no outward current in the AM2 proton channel is observed. CM2 is encoded by RNA segment 6 (M gene) of the influenza C virus [20], which produces a p42 protein precursor. CM1 and CM2 are obtained upon cleavage by a peptidase. CM2 is abundantly expressed in virus-infected cells, and a small amount is incorporated into the virus particles. CM2 protein is capable of modifying pH within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) a chimeric AM2 protein containing the CM2 transmembrane domain could partially restore the infectious virus production of an M2-deficient influenza A virus. CM2 protein may have a function similar to that of the M2 protein in virus uncoating. DM2 A new type of influenza virus, known as type D, has recently been identified in cattle and pigs. the proteome of IDV is closer to ICV than to IAV or IBV [2] and, correspondingly, CM2 and DM2 share similarities. neither CM2 nor DM2 contain an HxxxW motif, but a \u201cYxxxK\u201d motif has been proposed instead [110]. the YxxxK motifs in CM2 and DM2 are predicted to be functional motifs of these channels. the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. CM2 forms disulfide-linked dimers and tetramers via evolutionarily conserved Cys1\u2013Cys6\u2013Cys20 [97] and is post-translationally modified by N-glycosylation (Asn11), palmitoylation (Cys65), and phosphorylation [95,96,98] a chimeric AM2 protein containing the CM2 transmembrane domain could partially restore the infectious virus production of an the CM2 protein may have a function similar to that of the M2 protein in virus uncoating. however, the proton and chloride permeabilities have not been clearly dissected. DM2 A new type of influenza virus, known as type D, has recently been identified in cattle and pigs. neither CM2 nor DM2 contain an HxxxW motif, but a \u201cYxxxK\u201d motif has been proposed. the gating voltage of CM2 and DM2 was shown to be affected by modifications at the YxxxK motif. the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. other Influenza Viroporins IAV and IBV encode other viroporins. PB1-F2 and NB can interact with two mitochondrial proteins. NB protein is encoded by IBV at RNA segment 6. NB has been found to form ion channels when incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers. further studies on an NB-S20A mutant have resulted in altered proton permeability and channel gating. however, NB is not required for viral replication in cell culture. the lack of amantadine inhibition of BM2 may be explained by differences in lumen hydrophobicity in the two channels. however, the more hydrophilic channel of BM2 protein may not be able to accommodate a hydrophobic drug like amantadine. the low-affinity site is non-specific and localized at the membrane surface. the high-affinity site would be located inside the channel in between the four imidazole rings from His37 residues and the four indole rings from Trp41 [140]. BM2 is also inhibited by Cu(II) in a biphasic manner. inhibition of ENaC appears to be mediated by the C-terminus of M2. CFTR reduces the activity of the CFTR channel by alkalinizing the secretory organelle pH, thereby targeting CFTR for destruction via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. M2 blocks autophagosome fusion with lysosomes by interacting with Beclin-1 through the N-terminal 60 amino acids of M2. this interaction mimics a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, W/FxxI/L/V. BM2 was found to interact with Hsp40 through the C-terminal domain 1. tetherin (BST-2, bone stromal cell antigen 2) is an interferon-inducible antiviral host factor that restricts the release of many enveloped viruses by forming a proteinaceous link, tethering budding virions to the cell surface. it involves AM2 interaction with tetherin to downregulate its surface expression via the proteasomal pathway, probably mediated by AM2 extracellular and transmembrane domains. IAV is able to induce the relocalization of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. inhibition of Cav-1 correlates with decreased virus titers in IAV-infected cells [161] the 1 auxiliary subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, ATP1B1, was identified to interact with the cytoplasmic region of both AM2 and BM2. a stable ATP1B1-knockdown cell line was able to suppress influenza virus A/WSN/33 replication. the Rab11 pathway is known to be involved in the IAV budding process. it is a small GTP-binding protein that traffics proteins and vesicles between the trans-Golgi network, recycling endosome and apical membrane. otide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) is proposed to play an important role in the trafficking of viral proteins to the cell surface during the late stages of virus replication. the latter work reported that siRNA-mediated depletion of GBF1 correlates with (i) significant reduction in virus titers, (ii) reduced efficiency of VLP formation and (iii) altered intracellular localization of the viral envelope proteins HA and NA. however, while GBF1 has been reported to associate with PKR activation is inhibited by IAV to permit viral replication. during early stages of infection, AM2 stabilizes the Hsp40\u2013P58IPK complex. BM2 was found to interact with Hsp40 through the C-terminal domain 1. it is speculated that anxA6 may interact with the M2 cytoplasmic tail during membrane scission. it remains to be determined whether this interaction also affects the surface localization of M2 and other viral proteins. function of the host cellular Na,K-ATPase pump offers a promising antiviral treatment. infection with IAV/H1N1 and IAV/H5N1 has led to the downregulation of Na,K-ATPase in alveolar epithelium. the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 4 (UBR4) is a 600-kDa member of the UBR box. the vesicle transport protein Rab11 is a small GTP-binding protein that traffics proteins and vesicles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), recycling endosome and apical membrane. multi-subunit transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex mediates ER-to-Golgi transport. siRNA knockdown of TRAPPC6A increases M2 surface expression. TRAPPC6A overexpression has produced the opposite effect, suggesting that TRAPPC6A slows down M2 apical trafficking."}
