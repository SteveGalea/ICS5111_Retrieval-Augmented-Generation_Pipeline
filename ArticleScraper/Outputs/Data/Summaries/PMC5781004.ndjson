{"summary": "infected travellers may act as a vector for the influenza virus, 5, 6 introducing it into other communities, including their own upon return. influenza has the capacity to disrupt travel, and is capable of causing severe or even fatal illness. one study has shown that travellers experienced one influenza event per 100 personmonth abroad. strains from both hemispheres may circulate simultaneously in the tropics. the timing of influenza seasons and dominant strains may differ by continent, region and country. vaccinated travellers may not be adequately protected against influenza while travelling. the travel clinic provides travel health risk assessments and a clinical travel health service to residents of north London and further afield. a crosssectional study was conducted through a questionnaire-based survey completed by 155% (96/621) of all travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Clinic during the study period. the study period was kept quite short (1 month) to diminish the possible effect of publicity. a number of moderator variables were included to examine cognitiveintention and cognitivebehaviour relationships as both \u2018direct experience\u2019 and to increase the predictive validity of the planned behaviour. the intention is thought to reflect the motivation and willingness to try and achieve the goals. questionnaire was designed to assess behavioural intention, personal attitude, perceived knowledge and motivation. external behavioural and subjective norms could not be tested. behavioural intention, personal attitude, perceived knowledge and motivation could not be tested. Statistical analysis was compared using the Chisquare test or the Fisher exact test. continuous variables were compared by either the Student\u2019s \u2018t\u2019 test, or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test when the data were not distributed normally. a crosssectional study was conducted through a questionnaire-based survey completed by 155% (96/621) of all travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Clinic during the study period. the study period was kept quite short (1 month) to diminish the possible effect of publicity, which could bias the results. a number of moderator variables were included to examine the cognitiveintention and cognitivebehaviour relationships as both \u2018direct experience\u2019 and to increase the predictive validity of the planned behaviour. the behaviour is thought to reflect the motivation and willingness to try and achieve the goals. questionnaire was designed to assess behavioural intention, personal attitude, perceived knowledge and motivation. external behavioural and subjective norms could not be tested. behavioural intention, personal attitude, perceived knowledge and motivation could not be tested. variables included were those related to a travellers\u2019 socioeconomic and health status, to the travel itinerary itself and the cognitive factors generated from the questionnaire.
