{"summary": "in 2008, rotavirus and measles virus caused the deaths of 570,000 children under the age of five. in 2009, it was estimated that rotavirus infections alone resulted in $325 million in medical treatment costs and $423 million in societal costs each year [4] rotavirus infections alone resulted in $325 million in medical treatment costs and $423 million in societal costs each year. these nucleotide substitution rates span at least three orders of magnitude [5], [17] and do not correlate well with experimentally measured viral mutation rates [5]. recombination undeniably plays a role in shaping viral evolutionary dynamics and could inflate substitution rate estimates. 92 published Bayesian nucleotide substitution rate estimates for the structural genes of 35 different mammalian RNA viral species. 21 published Bayesian rates for RdRps or a non-structural gene of 14 different viral species. these rates span three orders of magnitude, ranging from 3.0105 to 1.5102 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. plots on the left show rates based on structural genes, while the plots on the right show those of non-structural genes. each black bar indicates the mean of each level, and the levels of each variable are sorted by increasing mean substitution rate. there were no apparent relationships between genomic properties and substitution rates. ANCOVA analyses were performed separately on the structural and non-structural gene datasets to determine which, if any, of seven factors significantly predict the nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses. the adjusted coefficient of determination was 0.73, indicating that over 70% of the substitution rate variability can be explained by the predictor variables. 1, 0.59) 0.0001

species-specific host range, and dsRNA genome architecture. target cells were the only significant predictors of log-transformed substitution rates for both structural and non-structural genes. coefficients are indicated by the same symbols used in Figures 1 and 2. dark coefficients correspond to significant substitution rate predictors. tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons were most significant substitution rate predictors. pod vectors was also found to be a significant rate predictor in one of the three analyses. a series of one-tailed t-tests was used to confirm which cell tropisms are associated with higher viral substitution rates than others. viruses that target epithelial cells were found to have significantly higher non-structural gene substitution rates than viruses that target neurons, hepatocytes, or leukocytes. these results were recapitulated in the control datasets that only used one rate per viral species. most of the viruses in this study that are classified as targeting leukocytes ultimately cause systemic infections. significance of viruses with each target cell in the left column is designated with a p-value from a one-tailed t-test. threshold for statistical significance ( = 0.01) was Bonferroni-corrected to account for multiple comparisons. log-scale mean nucleotide substitution rates of viruses that are transmitted through the fecal-oral/respiratory routes. those that are transmitted through the fecal-oral/respiratory routes are shown as the triangles on the right. the mean of each group is shown with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) except for non-neurotropic arboviruses. 92 published Bayesian nucleotide substitution rate estimates for the structural genes of 35 different mammalian RNA viral species. 21 published Bayesian rates for RdRps or a non-structural gene of 14 different viral species. these rates span three orders of magnitude. the levels of each variable by ascending mean substitution rate revealed similar patterns (i.e., the same ordering of levels) for both the structural (S) and non-structural (NS) datasets in three of these variables, excepting transmission route. viral substitution rates grouped according to target cell (panels 1A and 1B), transmission route (panels 1C and 1D), infection type (panels 1E and 1F), and host range (panels 1G and H) the plots on the left show rates based on structural genes. the plots on the right show those of non-structural genes. each black bar indicates the mean of each level, and the levels of each of these variables are sorted by increasing mean substitution rate. predictor (95% CI) Significance 1 0.73 Neurons 0.80 (1.01, 0.59) 0.0001 Leukocytes 0.56 (0.80, 0.33) 0.0001 Hepatocytes 0.24 (0.40, 0.08) 0.0004 Endothelial cells 0.18 (0.31, 0.05)

infection, species-specific host range, and ()ssRNA genome architecture. in the third ANCOVA, the base levels were leukocyte target cells, respiratory/vertical transmission route, acute infection, family-specific host range, and ()ssRNA genome architecture. targeting epithelial cells or neurons was found to be the most significant predictor of structural gene rates in each analysis where these were not the base levels. targeting neurons was found to be the sole significant predictor of substitution rates for the smaller non-structural gene dataset. tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons were the most significant substitution rate predictors (Tables S3 and S4). the results from these analyses were nearly identical to those from the structural gene analyses (Figure 4). a series of one-tailed t-tests was used to confirm which cell tropisms are associated with higher viral substitution rates than others. a series of one-tailed t-tests was used to confirm which cell tropisms are associated with higher viral substitution rates than others. significance of viruses with each target cell in the left column is designated with a p-value from a one-tailed t-test. threshold for statistical significance ( = 0.01) was Bonferroni-corrected to account for multiple comparisons. significant values are bolded. fecal-oral/respiratory transmitted viruses that target epithelial cells have significantly higher substitution rates than those that target other cell types. neurotropic arboviruses have significantly lower substitution rates than arboviruses that target other cell types. mutation rates measured as mutations per base per replication were only available for three viruses included in this study (poliovirus 1 [29], measles virus [30], [31], and influenza A virus [32]) these mutation rates were not significantly correlated with their corresponding substitution rate estimates (r = 0.69, P = 0.31 and r = 0.93, P = 0.25, for mutation rates measured as mutations per base per replication, respectively) shorter average generation times lead to more rounds of replication per year. a variety of intrinsic and ecological factors could plausibly alter the tempo of virus evolution by influencing the rate at which genetic diversity is generated, maintained, and fixed within viral populations. some have focused on genomic properties as drivers of substitution rate variation [14], [15], [17], [18], demonstrating a weak negative correlation between the genome lengths and substitution rates of RNA viruses [15], [17]. transmission mode and host range are frequently invoked as determinants of viral substitution rates [5], [41]. only one of our 15 ANCOVA analyses implicated transmission route as a significant substitution rate predictor. the observation that vector-borne viruses tend to evolve more slowly is qualitatively consistent with our results. dn/dS estimates based on structural genes of arboviruses were not significantly lower than those for non-arboviruses (P = 0.19). cell tropism is the most significant predictor of mammalian RNA virus substitution rate. no significant correlation between dN/dS and substitution rates. mutation rate variation among different cell types is not driving higher substitution rates in epithelial-infecting mammalian RNA viruses. mutation rate variation among different cell types is not driving higher substitution rates. RNA viruses have shorter generation times in faster dividing cells [54], [52], [53], but the associations between cell tropism and RNA virus generation time are less obvious. for at least some RNA viruses, viral genome replication is highly dependent on host cell proliferation, with RNA synthesis occurring at much lower rates in poorly proliferating cells. dn/dS estimates based on structural genes of arboviruses were not significantly lower than those for non-arboviruses (P = 0.19). dn/dS estimates based on structural genes of arboviruses were only moderately lower than those for non-arboviruses (P = 0.19). the evolution of alian RNA viruses is dominated by their high mutation rates [1], [13], [15]. weak negative correlations between genome lengths and viral substitution rates have been attributed to a relationship between mutation rate and substitution rate. a recent study found that infection of different cell types did not lead to differences in mutation rate. RNA viruses have shorter generation times in faster dividing cells [54], [52], [53], but the associations between cell tropism and RNA virus generation time are less obvious. RNA viruses do not depend on cellular replication machinery. RNA replication is highly dependent on host cell proliferation. the higher substitution rates of epithelial-infecting viruses predict increased evolvability and greater potential for emergence in novel host species [21] we excluded retroviruses because they are known to have highly variable substitution rates due to time spent integrated into DNA genomes, where they evolve at the rate of their hosts' genome. genomic architecture and ecology were obtained for all viruses with published substitution rates that met these criteria. dN/dS estimates were collected when available. each dataset was scanned for recombination using seven different algorithms. modeltest v3.7 [84] was used to determine best-fit model of nucleotide substitution for each dataset (by AIC) long-term nucleotide substitution rates were estimated using BEAST v1.5.4 [20] each dataset was run for at least 50 million generations. additional analyses were run for both the S and NS datasets with only one substitution rate per virus species. one-tailed t-tests were subsequently run in R v2.14.1 [87] to provide an additional measure of significant directional variation. only rates from single gene analyses were included, not those based on full genomes or multiple gene alignments. only rates produced by Bayesian coalescent analyses of datasets composed of at least 30 taxa, isolated over a minimum range of 15 years and spanning at least 40% of the analyzed gene were included. recombination events can lead to over-estimation of nucleotide substitution rates. each dataset was run for at least 50 million generations. each dataset was run with two different clock models (strict and uncorrelated lognormal) and three different demographic models (constant, exponential, and Bayesian skyline) ANCOVA analyses were run using SPSS Statistics v21 (IBM) with log-transformed mean substitution rates as the dependent variable and seven overarching predictor variables (target cell, transmission route, whether the infection is acute or persistent, host range, genome length, genome sense, and whether or not the genome is segmented) ized residuals are shown for each data point, or observation, included in the ANCOVA analyses. A and B show the residuals from the first analysis, C and D show residuals from the second analysis, and E and F show residuals from the third analysis. the one residual outside the interval is shown in red and labeled according to the virus abbreviations given in Table S1. table S1 Nucleotide substitution rates and characteristics of all viruses used in this study. abbreviations for viruses and genes are as in Table S1. corrections for invariant sites (+i) and a gamma distribution of rate heterogeneity (+G) were also included. for each multiple regression analysis, the overall adjusted R 2 () of the model is given along with significant predictor variables (P0.01) and their standardized coefficients () with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the first regression, the base levels were epithelial target cells, bites/scratches transmission route, acute infection, species-specific host range, and ()ssRNA genome architecture. the significance of viruses with each target cell in the left column having higher log scale mean substitution rates is designated with a p-value from a one-tailed t-test. the threshold for statistical significance (P0.01) was Bonferroni-corrected to account for multiple comparisons."}
