{"summary": "line list of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV occurred within the KSA from June 24, 2012, to July 25, 2014. this data set included information on age, sex, area of residence, the reason the case patient was tested for MERS-CoV. the case patient's most recently reported clinical status (hospitalized, home isolation, discharged, or deceased) infected individuals detected through active surveillance in each age class develop symptoms and die at the same rate as all (i.e., both detected and undetected) individuals infected with MERS-CoV who are the same age. case patients without symptoms severe enough to trigger testing still have a small (estimated) probability of their infections being detected by passive surveillance. sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine how sensitive the results were to temporal variations in reporting probabilities and the definition of active surveillance. MERS-CoV mortality The case fatality ratio was calculated as the number of deceased case patients divided by the total number of individuals infected with MERS-CoV. active surveillance policies varied between locations and by time over the course of the period examined. from mid-2013 to 2014, there was a general policy of testing home and hospital contacts of index case patients whether or not the contacts had symptoms (10, 11) the rate at which individuals infected with MERS-CoV develop severe symptoms and die is assumed to vary by age group. the symptomatic infection ratio is the rate at which MERS-CoV\u2013infected individuals in that age group either develop symptoms suggestive of MERS-CoV infection or die. all rates and probabilities were estimated using Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods with the RStan package. for 3% (24 of 721), the mode of detection was unknown. thirty-three percent of persons whose infections were detected through active surveillance died or were otherwise indicated to have developed symptoms consistent with the MERS-CoV case definition. the nave case fatality ratio has decreased over the course of the epidemic. as of July 25, 2014, there were a total of 1,548 (95% CI: 1,327, 1,883) people infected with MERS-CoV. reported cases likely comprised 47% (95% CI: 38, 54) of the total number of MERS-CoV infections. a total of 691 people with laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV had been reported to the KSA as having either recovered (i.e., been discharged) or died. the infection fatality ratio was estimated to be 22% (95% CI: 18, 25) among those 70 years of age or older. DISCUSSION We estimated that as of July 25, 2014, there were 1,528 MERS-CoV infections in KSA. nearly all persons with undetected infections were predicted to not have developed symptoms of MERS-CoV severe enough to trigger testing. the greatest risk is in individuals older than 60 years of age; persons in that age group have a higher than 60% chance of dying if infected. in a cross-sectional serosurvey, 15 of 10,009 sera collected in 2012 and 2013 from healthy individuals tested positive for anti\u2013MERS-CoV antibodies. at least 62% of symptomatic human case patients were going undetected as of 2013, a slightly higher rate than estimated here. a detailed investigation of the south Korean outbreak that resulted from a single imported case caused by exposure in the Middle East (21), fatality rates (20% and 21%, respectively) among secondary cases that asymptomatically infected individuals may shed less virus and thus be less likely to test positive for MERS-CoV infection. biases would lead to an underestimation of the true number of MERS-CoV infections in our model. serological and active surveillance methods must be implemented with this in mind from the start of the response to an emerging infection. such planning would increase the power of the approach taken here and lead to consistent estimates between approaches. a key challenge is to collect the relevant data in a coordinated and standardized way from the early stages of the outbreak. our work represents a sizeable population of individuals infected with the virus within the KSA. more refined estimates will require serological surveys or modifications to the surveillance system."}
