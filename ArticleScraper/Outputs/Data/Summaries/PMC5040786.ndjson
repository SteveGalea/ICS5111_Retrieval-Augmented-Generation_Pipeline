{"summary": "plasmid was purified from MR766 inoculum and used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome. authentic 5\u2032 end of the viral sequence was placed at the transcriptional initiation site of the cytomegalovirus promoter. an HDVr trims the viral genome to its authentic 3\u2032 end. tamase resistance gene (AmpR) and origin of replication (pUC ori) are also marked. the steps used to create the above plasmid involved cloning synthetic DNA gBlocks or RT-PCR products derived from viral inoculum. octagons and triangles above step v represent the positions of nonsense and frameshift mutations, respectively, when cloning each of these fragments. plasmid encoding inactivating GDD to GNN mutation in viral NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) catalytic active site [Pol()] could be stably propagated in bacteria. we transfected 293T cells with wild-type and Pol() MR766 plasmids. cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies against the ZIKV E and NS3 proteins. NS3 protein levels also increased over time in both wild-type plasmid-transfected and parental virus-infected cells. results confirm that both the wild-type and Pol() MR766 ZIKV plasmids were able to express viral proteins. protein levels were detected in a greater percentage of cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid. immunoblot analysis for ZIKV was performed with an antibody against NS3 on 293T cells at 1 to 4 days after transfection or infection. expression of NS3 in cells transfected with either the wild-type or the Pol() MR766 plasmid would require splicing of the viral RNA transcript. a single DNA product was amplified from wild-type plasmid transfected cells that was similar in size to the parental MR766 RT two product sizes were observed, representing the unspliced (1,083-bp) and spliced (1,216-bp) template. sequence analysis of bacterial plasmid clones of these RT-PCRs showed that all products from wild-type plasmid-transfected cell RNA lacked the inserted intron. no staining was observed in vero cells challenged with Pol() plasmid transfected 293T cell supernatant. rescued wild-type, Pol(), parental MR766, or mock-infected vero cells were immunostained for the ZIKV E (green) and NS3 (red) proteins and Hoechst counterstained (blue) representative images of vero cell plaque assays with wild-type rescued and parental MR766 viruses fixed and stained at the indicated days postinfection. a growth curve was performed to compare the growth curve kinetics of the wild-type rescued and parental MR766 viruses. the rescued and parental MR766 viruses were attenuated in comparison to the parental inoculum (5, 8) the rescued and parental MR766 viruses exhibited similar infectivities to those of the parental inoculum (5, 8) a retrospective analysis of plaque sizes in the publication by Shan et al. showed that their rescued 2010 Cambodia ZIKV produced plaques that were approximately 3.3-fold smaller than parental virus plaques at 4 days postinfection (5). however, we were able to detect slight attenuation of our rescued and parental virus. multicycle growth curve experiments were performed in which vero cells were infected (MOI of 0.01) for 1 h with either the rescued wild-type virus or cells were grown as previously described (14) in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml antibiotic-antimycotic (FBS); 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). titers were determined by CPE-based limited dilution assay on vero cells. ATCC MR766 isolate was identical to GenBank accession file HQ234498 (17) we based our plasmid off this sequence to be assured of working with an infectious virus sequence. however, HQ234498 does not include the full 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 MR766 untranslated regions (UTRs) we based these regions off the original AY632535 MR766 virus with one exception. a PCR product spanning the SacI and KpnI sites of pWNII-GFP was amplified with oligonucleotides ME-O-1751 and ME-O-1787. a plasmid with deletions of more than 1 kb within the SalI-to-BstBI region was chosen to proceed with cloning of the remaining 3\u2032 regions. plasmid was cloned into the NsiI and KpnI sites of the above plasmid. the deletions within the SalI-to-BstBI region appeared to occur at regions of repeated sequence, suggesting that they were created by recombination. we screened alternative strains of bacteria for ones that were less prone to this phenomenon. a gBlock bearing 15 nucleotides before and after the SalI and XhoI sites was synthesized with a silent G3127A mutation in the MR766 coding sequence. we termed this plasmid pCDNA6.2 MR766 Intron3127 HDVr with oligonucleotides carrying two nucleotide coding mutations in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) Plasmid-based ZIKV was produced in 293T cells by transfections performed in triplicate. one day prior to transfection, 5 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well polylysine-coated plates. supernatants from transfected cells were collected 1 to 4 days posttransfection and filtered. antibodies against NS3 (rabbit polyclonal antiserum 459, raised against a peptide representing amino acids 456 to 469 of the GenBank AAV34151 MR766 sequence) and actin (AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies. RNA was extracted from cells 48 h after transfection with the wild-type MR766 plasmid or Pol() plasmid or infection with the parental MR766 virus. the extracted RNA was used as a template for random hexamer-primed cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand synthesis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) 7.5 105 Vero cells were seeded in polylysine-coated 12-well plates in DMEM with 2% FBS. for infection, medium was replaced with 300 l of serial dilutions. after 2 h at 37\u00b0C, 1.5 ml 0.8% methylcellulose in DMEM with 2% FBS was added to each well."}
