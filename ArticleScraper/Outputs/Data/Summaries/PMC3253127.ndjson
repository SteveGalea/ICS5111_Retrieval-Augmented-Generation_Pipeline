{"summary": "infectious diseases have contributed to the decline and local extinction of several wildlife species, including African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) serious impacts on host populations most often occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant (often domestic) \u201creservoir\u201d hosts. if this is case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate, but pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important. reservoir hosts can be hard to recognise and in some cases there may be no external reservoir [8] population crashes and local extinctions of endangered africa wild dogs have been linked to canine pathogens such as rabies virus [9], [10], canine distemper virus [11], [12], and the bacterial pathogen Ehrlichia canis [13]. behavioural effects on contact patterns suggest intraspecific pathogen transmission is likely to be frequency-dependent rather than density-dependent [26] behavioural measures of exposure to six canine pathogens in african wild dogs coexisting with domestic dogs. wild dogs disappeared from the study area in the 1980s, but recolonised naturally in the late 1990s. wild dog density increased through the course of the study, rising from 0.009 adults and yearlings/km2 in 2001 to 0.034 adults and yearlings/km2 in 2009. wild dogs were immobilized by intramuscular administration of medetomidine. of these 90 animals, 16 were immobilized twice and three were immobilized three times to replace expired or damaged radio-collars. wild dogs fitted with radio-collars were monitored using aerial and ground-based telemetry. the ages of the remaining 45 wild dogs were estimated using a combination of tooth wear, pelage characteristics, reproductive state and social status. none of the wild dogs in this study had been vaccinated against any pathogen. domestic dogs were manually restrained and blood was collected from the cephalic vein into 10ml evacuated tubes. serum samples were screened for antibodies to canine distemper virus. animals with antibodies detectable at dilutions 18 were considered likely to have been exposed to the respective viruses. we used nine years of aerial radio-telemetry data to estimate the average frequency of contact between neighbouring wild dog packs per active period. we multiplied this frequency by the number of packs with home ranges overlapping or adjoining that of the sampled wild dog in the 12 months before sampling. this risk of contacting other packs was only estimated for wild dogs with known movement patterns over the previous 12 months. analyses were conducted using mixed logistic regression models. results are reported as odds ratios (OR) and related 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with doubling the values of the explanatory variables (risk factors) generalised linear mixed models GLMM, including pack identity as a random effect, were also used to explore correlations between the two measures of domestic dog contact risk. animals were captured and handled in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service, with permission from the Kenyan Ministry of Science and Technology. annual mortality of radio-collared adults and yearling wild dogs was 29%, with disease associated with 40% of known-cause deaths. wild dog packs occupied overlapping territories averaging 278 km2 (range 60\u2013718km2), with territory size unrelated to pack size. blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into 10ml evacuated serum separator tubes. blood samples were allowed to clot before being centrifuged. serum was then removed and aliquots were stored at 20\u00b0C. wild dogs fitted with radio-collars were monitored using aerial and ground-based telemetry. 63 bomas were sampled at 14 locations in the study area where free rabies vaccination was being provided annually. blood samples were allowed to clot before being centrifuged. serum was then removed and aliquots were stored at 20\u00b0C. animals with antibodies detectable at dilutions 18 were considered likely to have been exposed to the respective viruses. in primary statistical analyses, antibodies detectable at titres 120 were considered likely to indicate prior exposure. wild dogs with known movement patterns over the previous 12 months were radio-collared themselves or were known to have been members of a pack with at least one radio-collared member. domestic dog densities are higher on community lands than on commercial ranches [25], the land use type inhabited by each wild dog gave one measure of risk of contact. the lowest non-zero value was added to all values before taking the logarithms. data on repeated sampling of the same animals were used to investigate seroconversion. preliminary analyses used mixed logistic regression models. the three measures of intraspecific contact among wild dogs were correlated with one another. pack size increased over time, whether measured as the number of adults and yearlings. the estimated risk of contacting another wild dog pack likewise increased over time. canine pathogens Table 1 shows the proportions of wild dogs and domestic dogs with evidence of exposure to the six canine pathogens on their most recent sampling date. for all pathogens except rabies virus, seroconversion from negative to negative was observed, providing evidence of likely exposure to the pathogens in the course of the study. distemper virus 12 2 1 4 19 canine parvovirus 13 0 4 2 19 canine coronavirus 4 4 2 3 13 Ehrlichia canis 0 13 5 1 19 Neospora caninum 8 8 3 0 19

with domestic dogs. mothers' exposure to Neospora significantly increased the probability of exposure among their offspring in preliminary analyses. populations of both host species were exposed to all of the pathogens investigated. for all pathogens except rabies virus, seroconversion from negative to negative was observed, providing evidence of likely exposure to the pathogens in the study.

coronavirus age (in months) 1.07 (1.02\u20131.13) 0.009 days since 1 the proportion of wild dogs with evidence of exposure to canine coronavirus was higher in older animals, and also declined over time. the proportion of wild dogs with evidence of exposure to canine coronavirus was greater in small packs with greater opportunities for contact with domestic dogs. the lack of any association between wild dogs' exposure to coronavirus and their contact with domestic dogs is consistent with recent evidence suggesting wildlife may play an important role in maintaining this pathogen. the proportion of domestic dogs exposed to coronavirus was lower than the corresponding proportion of wild dogs. this suggests some wild dogs may have been contacting uninfected domestic dogs, perhaps explaining the lack of association between domestic dog contact and wild dog exposure. domestic dogs' exposure to several pathogens was elevated by contact with domestic dogs. behavioural measure of inter-pack contact was not significantly associated with exposure to any of the pathogens. domestic dogs function as reservoir hosts for these pathogens. rabies virus has the clearest record of causing mortality in wild dogs. domestic dog vaccination can fail to protect wildlife if conducted over too small an area. domestic dog vaccination can fail to protect wildlife if conducted over too small an area. canine distemper virus is less likely than rabies virus to require management. vaccination of domestic dogs might have no conservation benefit. if this virus seriously threatens a wild dog population, vaccination of domestic dogs might have no conservation benefit."}
