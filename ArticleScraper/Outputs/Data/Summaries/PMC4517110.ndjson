{"summary": "viroporins were first identified in 1978 after the observation that a viral infection could induce changes in the permeability of the host cell plasma membrane [1]. viroporins play a key role in the virus life cycle; deletion of a viroporin-encoding gene from a viral genome drastically diminishes viral fitness. Membrane Architecture Nieva et al. proposed a classification of viroporins from RNA viruses based on the number and orientation of their TM segments. each of these two classes can be divided into two minor groups according to their membrane topology. class II viroporins are generally produced from viral polyproteins through proteolytic processing, while class I does not require cleavage to reach their mature form [10,11] the differences between Class I and II viroporins go beyond the number and orientation of the TM segments. the putative transmembrane (TM) segments found by the G Prediction Server are highlighted in green (indicating a negative G value) the Lys residues within the TM segments are displayed in bold. PV1 Poliovirus 1, HCV Hepatitis C virus, CVB3 Coxsackievirus B3, SFV Semliki forest virus, SINV Sindbis virus, HRV Human rotavirus A. the figure shows the predicted G (kcal/mol) for each putative TM segment and the average G for class I and II viroporins. this is not a unique feature of the viroporins -helical hairpins. a turn propensity analysis reveals an area with an elevated turn propensity. this is not a unique feature of the 2B viroporin. most cellular membrane proteins encode in their Nt a short sequence known as signal sequence (SS) in the case of ER targeting the SS consists of a continuous stretch of hydrophobic residues (6 to 20) with one or more basic residues to one side of the hydrophobic core. the SRP transiently stop translation and subsequently dock the ribosome\u2013nascent chain\u2013SRP complex to the ER membrane via the SRP receptor (SR) post-translational targeting into the ER membrane uses cytosolic chaperones [29,30] that prevent protein misfolding. the mammalian cytochrome b5 can enter the ER membrane unassisted [31], demonstrating the possibility of an alternative machinery-free insertion mechanism. p7 is already inserted into the lipid bilayer when it adopts its mature form after proteolytic cleavage. however, current data suggest that nascent chains with the hydrophobic segment are not directed to the membrane through the SRP and should be inserted post-translationally. the translocon constitutes a channel between the cytosol and the ER lumen. it adopts in its closed configuration an hourglass shape with a \u201cplug\u201d in the narrowest point to maintain the permeability barrier of the membrane. this interaction triggers conformational changes in the translocon to accommodate the incoming polypeptide. the translocon exposes the nascent chain to the hydrophobic membrane core. it involves direct interaction between the segment to be inserted and the surrounding lipids. the favorable free energy of partitioning a hydrophobic side chain into the membrane is opposed by the unfavorable cost of partitioning the peptide bond. inter-helical hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions can facilitate the insertion of polar residues present in adjacent TM regions. the formation of inter-helical electrostatic interactions requires that the implicated helices move from the translocon into the membrane. each hydrophobic segment leaves the translocon and partitions into the membrane individually. class I viroporins must be hydrophobic enough (higher percentage of highly hydrophobic residues) to fulfill the process successfully. either polar residues that will end up facing the aqueous environment once the channel is formed must be inserted in the non polar membrane (stage I), or a hydrophobic surface is exposed to the water rich channel interior. this discrepancy in Lys residue content between class II and I viroporins may, once more, highlight differences in the mechanism of action and/or the type of pore that is formed by each viroporin class. class II are thought to disrupt membrane permeability by creating proteolipidic pores similar to those formed by melittin or pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax [67] most cellular membrane proteins encode in their Nt a short sequence known as signal sequence (SS) in the case of ER targeting the SS consists of a continuous stretch of hydrophobic residues (6 to 20) with one or more basic residues to one side of the hydrophobic core. in this case, the TM domain performs a dual function as a signal sequence and as membrane anchor domain. if there is no SS or TM segment at the Nt of the polypeptide, the SRP will not be able to direct the emerging nascent chain to the SR. post-translational targeting into the ER membrane uses cytosolic molecular chaperones [29,30] that prevent protein misfolding and keeps the newly synthesized in a translocation/insertion competent state until they reach the ER membrane. p7 is already inserted into the lipid bilayer when it adopts its mature form. however, current data suggest that nascent chains with the hydrophobic segment are not directed to the membrane through the SRP and should be inserted post-translationally. the translocon constitutes a channel between the cytosol and the ER lumen. it adopts in its closed configuration an hourglass shape with a \u201cplug\u201d in the narrowest point to maintain the permeability barrier of the membrane. the translocon is a channel between the cytosol and the ER lumen. in vivo, the process is facilitated by the translocon which exposes the nascent chain to the hydrophobic membrane core. the translocon channel into the membrane will depend on the amino acid composition, the TM segment orientation, and the length of the helix. the favorable free energy of partitioning a hydrophobic side chain into the membrane is opposed by the unfavorable cost of partitioning the peptide backbone. the cost of dehydrating the peptide bond is still elevated [55] and this must be compensated by the favorable energy of inserting a significant amount of hydrophobic side chains. inter-helical hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions can facilitate the insertion of polar residues present in adjacent TM regions. in class I viroporins the single TM domain must be able to direct and anchor the protein to the membrane by itself. no interactions with other TM segments that could facilitate the insertion are possible at this point. therefore, class I TM domains must be hydrophobic enough (higher percentage of highly hydrophobic residues) to fulfill the process successfully. class II viroporins are thought to disrupt membrane permeability by creating proteolipidic pores similar to those formed by melittin or pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax [67]. the presence/absence of Lys residues may indicate a difference in the type of pore constructed but also distinct route of insertion into the membrane. the strength of side chain hydrogen bonds in soluble and membrane proteins is in average 0.5kcal/mol and 0.6kcal/mol respectively. the formation of salt bridges and inter-side chain hydrogen bonds requires two polar amino acids with opposite polarity. the energy penalty of inserting a polar residue could be greatly eliminated. the hydrophobic effect is responsible primarily for the insertion into the membrane (stage I) the tertiary and quaternary structure of TM segments is dictated by a delicate balance of the remaining low energy forces. the nature of van der Waals forces requires a large contact area between the associating protein segments. in TM helical segments amino acids with small side chains favor the helix-helix contact interfaces. 1 2B and Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) p7 (both class II viroporins) TM segments can permeabilize membranes (no complementation with the soluble domains is required either in cis or trans) if the interaction is required for the activity, the TM segment is responsible for it. the influenza A virus is a negative sense RNA virus form the Orthomyxoviridae family. its genome comprises eight RNA segments. a cytoplasmic membrane proximal amphiphilic helix involved in budding. the M2 protein exist in a monomer-tetramer equilibrium. before the resolution of the protein structure, the TM domain was already identified as responsible for the channel tetramerization [89] and proton transport activity [90]. despite some differences, all the structures show a helical tetramer perpendicular to the membrane normal. monomers, from A to D are depicted in green, pink, pale orange and blue, respectively, using a cartoon representation. the side chains of His37 and Trp41 are highlighted in lines using the same color code. the N 2 proton is exposed to the aqueous environment on the C-terminal side. once the proton is released, the closed state is restored. despite all the work with the M2 viroporin there are still controversies on its tetramerization process. orins insert into the membrane individually, using a pathway determined by their specific sequence and structural characteristics. in a second step, viroporins homo-oligomerize forming higher order structures crucial for the porating activity."}
