{"summary": "the genome of EBOV, the most deadly species of EBOV, is 18,959 nucleotides (nts) in length and contains seven transcriptional units that direct synthesis of at least nine distinct primary translation products. EBOVs encode a multi-protein complex to carry out replication and transcription. a gradient of viral mRNAs is presumed to occur as in other NNS viruses. eIF-2P binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex. the 43S subunit binds to a 5\u2032-m7G cap on an mRNA and scans the 5\u2032-untranslated region downstream to a start codon where translation initiation occurs. vesicular stomatitis virus induces preferential translation of its own mRNAs over cellular mRNAs before eIF2P occurs. EBOV impairs PKR activation in HEK293 cells. in persistently infected mouse cells EBOV has been shown to induce PKRP and eIF2P. multiple factors contribute to the frequency of translation initiation at a uAUG versus a pAUG. the intercistronic space between the uORF and the pAUG is considered an optimal sequence. eIF2P promotes translation initiation at the pORF of select mRNAs possessing uORFs. EBOV reduces viral titers 10\u2013100-fold in cell culture. a uORF in the mRNA regulates polymerase expression in response to the status of the cellular innate immune response. EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs are long, compared to those of most other NNS RNA viruses. GFP levels by over 90% as compared to a capped version of the same mRNA. these data indicate that the EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs do not function as IRESes. they suggest that in infected cells they are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, consistent with the capped-nature of EBOV mRNAs. in vitro transcribed mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR. the NP, VP35, VP40 and VP24 5\u2032-UTRs resulted in GFP expression comparable to the -actin 5\u2032-UTR construct. the GP and VP24 5\u2032-UTRs modestly, but reproducibly, enhanced GFP expression relative to the -actin control. EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs or the -actin control 5\u2032-UTR were placed upstream of a reporter ORF. distances in nucleotides from the pAUG are indicated at the top. black boxes indicate uORFs out of frame with GFP, while white boxes indicate uORFs in frame with GFP. transfected cells described in B were determined for each sample. each sample was normalized to 18s rRNA. the same mRNAs transfected in B were transfected into primary human dendritic cells. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from the transfected 293T cells showed comparable levels of GFP mRNA in each group at the time of the analysis. in both 293T cells and DCs, ablation of the L 5\u2032-UTR uAUG resulted in a 6.32 and 5.59 fold increase, respectively, in GFP signal relative to its corresponding 5\u2032-UTR possessing a uAUG. equal copies of mRNA encoding GFP downstream of individual 5\u2032-UTRs described in 3A were transfected into 293T cells. at 2.5 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. each bar represents the mean of triplicate samples. each construct was cloned into an expression plasmid. equivalent amounts of each plasmid were transfected into 293T cells. this effect was much more dramatic when L was co-transfected with VP35. efficiency of translation initiation at the L uAUG is determined by its sequence context. mRNA reporter constructs were generated so that the uORF is fused in frame to GFP. the first construct (uORF-GFP) includes the first 46 nucleotides of the L 5\u2032-UTR. the middle construct (uORF-GFP SK) is identical to the first, but the uAUG is surrounded by a strong Kozak sequence (A at the 3 position and a G at the +4 position) the bottom construct includes the L 5\u2032-UTR, through the uAUG and the second codon of the uORF which was placed in frame with the GFP ORF. pORF translation is suppressed by a strong uAUG Kozak sequence in the L 5\u2032-UTR. the next construct has a strong Kozak sequence (A at the 3 position and a G at the +4 position, where the A of the AUG is designated as +1) the construct labeled \"uAUG STOP\" has a point mutation that incorporates a stop codon directly after the uAUG start codon. uUUG and uUCG ablate the uAUG start codon. the black box represents the L uORF sequence, while the gray box depicts the remainder of the overlapping uORF that consists of GFP-derived sequences. additional mutations were introduced to preserve the Kozak sequence at the 3 and +4 position such that they match that present in the wildtype L 5\u2032-UTR. we titrated the L expression plasmid (which lacks the native 5\u2032-UTR of L) small amounts of L plasmid resulted in a rapid increase in activity, but a two-fold increase in L plasmid from 400 to 800 ng dramatically reduced polymerase activity. this suggests there is an optimal amount of L required for polymerase activity. the ratio of vRNA to infectious virus was calculated by quantitative PCR. a recombinant EBOV lacking the uAUG is attenuated in cell culture. a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the uAUG was mutated to UCG. -UTR mutant showed slowed growth kinetics compared to the wildtype virus in both vero and a549 cells. this effect was more prominent in A549 cells where the mutant virus grew to approximately a 100-fold lower titer by day 7 post infection. we further confirmed the growth defect by infecting both cell lines at a higher MOI of 0.1. vRNA levels of the EBOV mutant virus were reduced compared to wildtype EBOV. differences in mRNA levels were similar for each of the seven transcriptional units at all times post infection. EBOV mutant virus is impaired for RNA synthesis at early times post infection. each data point represents the average of values from the six individual regions on the vRNA to ensure an accurate measurement. the uORF enhances L expression under conditions of cell stress Multiple stimuli including viral infection, UV irradiation, and treatment with chemicals can trigger cell responses that induce eIF2P. 293T cells were treated with DMSO or with four concentrations TG to induce eIF2P. in the same experiment, cells were harvested at 10 hours post treatment. the wildtype L 5\u2032-UTR suppressed luciferase signal relative to the L 5\u2032-UTR without a uAUG. further, cells transfected with L-FF and treated with TG showed a 2-fold increase in the firefly/Renilla ratio over a western blot of total eIF2 and eIF2P levels measured by western blot. 293T cells were transfected with pRLTK and the L-FF or the Lns-FF reporter constructs. each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of four replicates. we predicted that a strong Kozak sequence would increase translation initiation at the uAUG, decrease ribosome bypass, and suppress translation at the pAUG in response to cell stress. the uAUG modulates L translation and maintains EBOV replication in response to eIF2 phosphorylation in A549 cells. treated cells were normalized to 1 and this value was also used to normalize the values in the Lsk-FF and Lns-FF transfected cells. the untreated ATF4 transfected sample was also set to 1. C. Effect of TG on wt and 5\u2032-UTR mutant virus replication. the uORF suppresses translation initiation at the L pORF, but the uORF also allows levels of L translation to be maintained when eIF2P increases. this would allow virus replication to be maintained in the presence of a host cell innate immune response. EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs are long, compared to those of most other NNS RNA viruses. mRNA lacking a m7G cap reduced GFP levels by over 90%. these data indicate that the EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs do not function as IRESes. they suggest that in infected cells they are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, consistent with the capped-nature of EBOV mRNAs. the in vitro transcribed mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR. the NP, VP35, VP40 and VP24 5\u2032-UTRs resulted in GFP expression comparable to the -actin 5\u2032-UTR construct. a screen of EBOV 5' UTRs shows that the polymerase (L) 5'-UTR suppresses GFP expression compared to the -actin control 5\u2032-UTR. mRNAs used to assess the impact of 5\u2032-UTRs on translation efficiency were placed upstream of a GFP reporter ORF. each sample was normalized to 18s rRNA. the same mRNAs transfected in B were transfected into primary human dendritic cells (DC) data are the values from single transfections. Flow cytometry showed that each uAUG suppresses GFP signals. ablation of the L 5\u2032-UTR uAUG resulted in a 6.32 and 5.59 fold increase. in both 293T cells and DCs, ablation of the uAUG resulted in a 6.32 and 5.59 fold increase. equal copies of mRNA encoding GFP downstream of individual 5\u2032-UTRs described in 3A were transfected into 293T cells. at 2.5 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. each bar represents the mean of triplicate samples. mRNA (6783 nt long, encoding a protein of 2212 a.a.) each construct was cloned into an expression plasmid. equivalent amounts of each plasmid were transfected into 293T cells. this effect was much more dramatic when L was co-transfected with VP35. efficiency of translation initiation at the L uAUG is determined by its sequence context. mRNA reporter constructs were generated such that the uORF is fused in frame to GFP. the first construct (uORF-GFP) includes the first 46 nucleotides of. the middle construct (uORF-GFP SK) is identical to the first, but the uAUG is surrounded by a strong Kozak sequence (A at the 3 position and a G at the +4 position) the bottom construct includes the L 5\u2032-UTR, through the uAUG and the second codon of the uORF which was placed in frame with the GFP ORF. pORF translation is suppressed by a strong uAUG Kozak sequence in the L 5\u2032-UTR, but is not affected by a weak uAUG Kozak sequence. the next construct has a strong Kozak sequence (A at the 3 position and a G at the +4 position, where the A of the A of the A). two constructs predicted to have a weak Kozak sequence (uAUG WK1 and WK2) have mutations at the +4 and +4/+5 positions. uUUG and uUCG ablate the uAUG start codon. the black box represents the L uORF sequence, while the gray box depicts the remainder of the overlapping uORF that consists of GFP-derived sequences. additional mutations were introduced to preserve the Kozak sequence at the 3 and +4 position such that they match that present in the wildtype L 5\u2032-UTR. we titrated the L expression plasmid (which lacks the native 5\u2032-UTR of L) small amounts of L plasmid resulted in a rapid increase in activity, but a two-fold increase in L plasmid from 400 to 800 ng dramatically reduced polymerase activity. this suggests there is an optimal amount of L required for polymerase activity. vRNA was reverse transcribed with a vRNA specific primer. the relative vRNA copy number was calculated by quantitative PCR. a recombinant EBOV lacking the uAUG is attenuated in cell culture. the EBOV L 5\u2032-UTR mutant showed slowed growth kinetics compared to the wildtype virus in both Vero and A549 cells. this effect was more prominent in both cell lines where the mutant virus grew to approximately a 100-fold lower titer by day 7 post infection. the mutant virus grew to approximately a 100-fold lower titer by day 7 post infection. negative sense genomic RNA (vRNA) and mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. the primer pairs were validated with linearized plasmids encoding each of the seven EBOV genes. as early as six hours post infection, the vRNA levels of the EBOV mutant virus were reduced compared to wildtype EBOV. quantitative PCR was performed on these cDNA preparations to quantify relative amounts of vRNA in each sample. each data point represents the average of values from the six individual regions on the vRNA to ensure an accurate measurement. the wildtype L 5\u2032-UTR suppressed luciferase signal without a uAUG. also, cells transfected with L-FF and treated with TG showed a 2-fold increase in the firefly/Renilla ratio over a DMSO control. the uAUG modulates translation of the L pORF in response to eIF2 phosphorylation in 293T cells. western blot of total eIF2 and eIF2P levels measured by western blot. 293T cells were transfected with pRLTK and the L-FF or the Lns-FF reporter constructs. each data point represents the mean and standard deviation of four replicates. we predicted that a strong Kozak sequence would increase translation initiation at the uAUG, decrease ribosome bypass, and suppress translation at the pAUG. this sequence might also impair translational modulation at the pAUG in response to cell stress, consistent with studies examining the CHOP 5\u2032-UTR [47] the luciferase ratio of untreated cells transfected with L-FF was normalized to 1. the untreated ATF4 transfected sample was also set to 1. C. Effect of TG on wt and 5\u2032-UTR mutant virus replication. the L uORF suppresses translation initiation at the L pORF. but the uORF also allows levels of L translation to be maintained when eIF2P increases. this would allow virus replication to be maintained in the presence of a host cell innate immune response. uORFs regulate gene expression via a transcriptional gradient. genes at the 3\u2032 end of the negative-sense genome are transcribed more abundantly than those at the 5\u2032 end. this study provides evidence for an additional mechanism by which EBOVs may regulate viral protein levels. it suggests that an intact L uORF functions to maintain EBOV replication in the face of a cell stress response. the EBOV UTRs can be divided into three classes. first are 5\u2032-UTRs lacking uORFs which translated reporter mRNAs to levels comparable to the -actin 5\u2032-UTR-GFP mRNA (NP, GP, VP40, and VP24) the third group includes only the L 5\u2032-UTR, which strongly suppresses translation of the pORF, a suppression mediated by the L uAUG. the location of the uAUG in the L 5\u2032-UTR is critical for translation suppression. only one of four constructs with relocated uAUGs represses reporter translation. it is interesting that the uAUG is predicted to lie at the top of a stem-loop. the uORF arrangement of the EBOV L mRNA provides a mechanism to keep translation of L low while allowing its upregulation in the presence of eIF2P. this would effectively maintain L expression under cell stress conditions. the uAUG is critical to maintain virus titers in the presence of cell stress. a uAUG mutant virus was more sensitive to TG treatment. uORFs in the VP35, VP30 and VP24 mRNAs serve a similar purpose. regulation of eIF2P in response to eIF2P suggests that EBOV encodes mechanisms to respond to cell stress. recombinant EBOV mutant virus lacking the uAUG in the L 5\u2032-UTR could impair polymerase activity. the mutant virus never reached equivalent titers to that of wildtype EBOV. there is a clear delay in virus transcription and replication. without the uORF, L protein expression will be increased under basal conditions and will not be properly regulated under conditions of cell stress. nascent uORF peptides of fungi and yeast can interact with the ribosome during their translation to inhibit translation at the pORF. the mutation of the L uAUG significantly affects virus replication in cell culture. it will be of interest to determine whether the functions of the EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs described in this report influence the outcome of infection in vivo. templates for the firefly and Renilla luciferase were obtained from the plasmids pgl4.20 and pRLTK (Promega) each of the EBOV 5\u2032-UTRs (synthesized based on sequences from the strain Mayinga) were introduced in the multiple cloning site (MCS) between the firefly and Renilla luciferase sequences. plasmid of L fused to firefly luciferase-XhoI was constructed as: SacI-L 5\u2032UTR-L, amino acids 1 to 13-firefly luciferase-XhoI. buffy coats of anonymous donors were obtained from the New York Blood Center (Long Island, NY) 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-GFP-FLAG, pCAGGS-VP35-FLAG, or pCAGGS L 1\u2013505-FLAG by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) both cDNAs were then subjected to real time quantitative PCR with primers specific for GFP (Bio-Rad C1000 Thermal Cycler) lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C in a microcentrifuge. the membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, and then probed with a monoclonal mouse M2 -Flag primary antibody and a goat -mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) cDNA copy of the full length genome of EBOV (strain Mayinga) flanked by a T7 promoter and a hepatitis delta ribozyme and T7 terminator was cloned into pAmp. a subgenomic fragment of the genome was subcloned into pKan, the L uAUG mutated (a11547t, t11548c), and cloned back into cytopathic effect (after 7\u201314 days) supernatant was transferred onto fresh veroE6 cells. RNA from these stocks was isolated and the entire genome was sequenced to ensure there were no unwanted mutations. to measure viral RNA levels, total RNA was reverse transcribed in independent reactions with six primers. a bicistronic reporter construct was generated in the plasmid pCAGGS [81] and cloned between EcoRI and BglII sites. templates for the firefly and Renilla luciferase were obtained from the plasmids pgl4.20 and pRLTK (Promega) the resulting construct preserved the nucleotides coding for the first 11 amino acids of the L uORF. nucleotides coding for the C-terminal part of the uORF differed, as they were derived from both the SacI and GFP sequence. in vitro transcription of mRNAs encoding reporter genes. mRNAs were transcribed using random hexamer primers. the quality of the RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-GFP-FLAG, pCAGGS-VP35-FLAG, or pCAGGS L 1\u2013505-FLAG by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 24 hours post transfection, cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer. cells were treated with thapsigargin (TG, Sigma, Cat# T9033) and harvested at the indicated hours post treatment for a dual luciferase assay. the firefly/Renilla luciferase ratio was then determined for each group. a subgenomic fragment of the genome was subcloned into pKan. mutant rgEBOV and mutant rgEBOV-Mut were rescued in veroE6 cells. supernatant was transferred to fresh veroE6 cells after 7 days. mRNA was first isolated from total RNA (Invitrogen, cat# 610.06) to produce cDNA specific for messenger RNA, total RNA was reverse transcribed in independent reactions with six primers. real time PCR with validated primer pairs specific to the EBOV genome were developed to quantify the relative amounts of each RNA species. each day, supernatant was harvested and TCID50 titers were determined on Vero cells. each bar represents the means of triplicate samples.
