{"summary": "the aim of this study was to explore attitudes and behaviours of registered nurses and their colleagues around the adoption of standard precautions. a voluntary sample of 29 adults was recruited from the Australian nursing (n = 25) and midwifery (n = 4) workforce. participants were recruited through advertisement on notice boards and emails from unit managers. new strategies were needed to deal with the actual but also the feared transmission of HIV from patients to healthcare workers. these strategies included recommendations for the protection of clinical and laboratory staff (CDC, 1982) and advised staff to avoid direct contact of skin and mucous membranes with blood, blood products, excretions, secretions and tissue of persons judged likely to have AIDS. the application of SP is governed by the 2010 national health and medical research council guidelines (NHMRC, 2010) in australia, the application of SP is governed by the 2010 national health and medical research council guidelines (NHMRC, 2010) despite the demonstrated efficacy of using SP, staff fail to adhere to at least some, if not all, aspects of the guidelines. lack of adherence to guidelines can be described in Vaughan\u2019s (1996) terms as a deviance from established practice which, if not corrected, can become normalised behaviour. price and Williams (2015) argued that healthcare workers need to be made aware of any deviant behaviours and the concept of normalisation in order to amend their behaviours. a standardised interview guide was used across all interviews/focus groups. questions such as: are you aware of universal precaution (UP)/standard precaution (SP) guidelines. interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded with the permission of participants. participants were required to provide demographic data on their gender, age, profession and continuous years of practice since graduation. a standardised interview guide was used across all interviews/focus groups. staff deviate from components of guidelines such as gloving and handwashing. but this deviance is in contradiction to the fundamental requirements of SP. most participants stated that staff frequently used their judgement of the patient. some participants stated that adherence to the guidelines was not universal when dealing with blood. others said that adherence to the guidelines was not universal when dealing with faeces. but they were under the impression that the adoption of guidelines was mostly universal when dealing with faeces. some participants saw their job experience as providing a safety net against the risk of injury. others said adhering to SP in those circumstances was not necessary as they judged themselves as sufficiently skilled. participants said this acted as a negative influence on the observers' adoption of SP. the aim in this study was to ascertain attitudes towards and behaviours around their adoption of SP guidelines. staff attitudes and practice were also different when changing babies\u2019 nappies compared to handling older patients who were incontinent of urine or faeces. this differing perspective could be related to a biased perception of risk, where unrealistic optimism is often displayed when confronting familiar risks under volitional control. participants also reported making judgements about their own skill level. some participants said their skill and experience ensured they would not sustain an OEB during procedures such as venepuncture or cannulation. these comments might also reflect a sense of invincibility among these staff. the results of this qualitative study are limited to a small sample of nurses where the proportion of male participants (20.70%) was higher than that in the nursing workforce nationally (9.9%; Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2012). possible response bias must also be acknowledged among the nurses who volunteered to participate in these interviews. not to use SP is contrary to the guidelines. it is also the responsibility of management, the organisation and the leadership within the organisation to ensure staff comply in full with the guidelines. the discussion should also be part of regular staff performance planning and appraisal sessions."}
