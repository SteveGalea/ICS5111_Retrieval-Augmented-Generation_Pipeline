{"summary": "virus infects primarily via the orofacial route, where it undergoes rounds of lytic replication in the mucosal epithelium of the eyes, nose, and mouth. after entering the axonal terminals of innervating sensory neurons, the virus travels in a retrograde direction to the cell body, which resides in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) ISGs establish an antiviral state in the cell through inhibition of transcription and translation, stimulation of cytokine production, and promotion of apoptosis. uninfected cells can also respond to secreted exogenous type I IFN, establishing an antiviral state to further halt viral spread. importance of the IFN-driven antiviral response in combating HSV-1 has been demonstrated in humans with genetic impairments. autophagy is a catabolic process of cytoplasmic protein and organelle degradation. this can also be triggered by invading pathogens in a process known as xenophagy. other studies have shown an important role for type I IFN signaling in combating HSV-1 infection in neurons. the neurons infected by HSV-1 in vivo represent the neuronal heterogeneity of the adult murine trigeminal ganglia seen in vivo (37\u201340) to better dissect the antiviral response of neurons and gain perspective on responses to RNA virus infection. we also used the prototypic interferon-sensitive virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (41, 42), and the prototypic interferon-sensitive virus. resistance of HSV-1 to IFN- signaling in neurons is mediated by 34.5. this is in contrast to adult fibroblasts and BMDCs in which HSV-1 replication was significantly reduced. incubation at 37\u00b0C on a rotator in a solution of 5 mg/ml collagenase type II (Invitrogen) and 5.5 mg/ml neutral protease (Worthington) dissolved in HBSS. TGs were then triturated in neurobasal-A working medium consisting of Neurobasal-A (Invitrogen), 2% SM1 (StemCell), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin femurs were removed from mice that had been lightly perfused for TG neuronal isolation. cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3 million cells per well. samples underwent a freeze-thaw prior to determining the titer of supernatant and cell lysate combined. a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 (neurons) and 0.5 (fibroblasts) was used for all growth curves unless otherwise noted. III tubulin (Abcam), mouse anti-NeuN (A60; Millipore), mouse anti-ICP0 (Virusys), mouse anti-ICP8 (39S; kindly provided by David Knipe) and rabbit anti-HSV-1 (B0114, Dako) secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa 555 and goat anti mouse/rabbit Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) STAT1 staining was quantified and scored as the percentage of cells supernatants were harvested and processed on an IFN- ELISA-HS kit. neuron isolation and culture were normalized to cell number. TGs were harvested and digested in papain solution. Optiprep was first diluted to 50.5% with 0.8% sodium chloride. then combined with NB-A working medium to obtain gradient layers. neurons were counted and seeded at a density of 3,600 neurons/12-mm coated coverslip in a volume of 60 l. cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3 million cells per well. cells were differentiated through culture with RPMI 1640 (HyClone), 1% sodium pyruvate (HyClone), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals), 0.5% penn/strep, 1% l-glutamine (HyClone), and 15% granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating BMDCs were harvested and resuspended in medium without GM-CSF. cells were incubated with virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, agitating every 15 min. an MOI of 0.1 was used for all BMDC growth curves. ICP0 virus (dl1403) (59) was kindly provided by David Bloom. STAT1/ mice were generously provided by Joan Durbin and previously described. wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient in successive components of the antiviral signaling cascade. BMDCs controlled HSV-1 replication, while BMDCs deficient in antiviral signaling supported significantly higher viral titers. this pattern of results was also observed at lower MOIs. BMDCs derived from mice deficient in antiviral signaling (STING/, STAT1/, IRF3/7/, and IFN-R/) were seeded and infected at a density comparable to our experiments with TG neurons. for fibroblasts and an MOI of 20 for neurons achieved infection of approximately 1% of cells. the relatively high MOI needed to infect 1% of cultured neurons was consistent with previous findings. a comparison of strain 17 replication in WT and STAT1/ fibroblasts revealed no difference. in infected TG neuron and fibroblast cultures, there was minimal STAT1 nuclear localization in ICP8-positive or ICP8-negative cells 5 h postinfection. the relatively faint STAT1 staining in mock and infected fibroblasts is likely due to the large cell size and diffuse cytoplasmic STAT1 distribution. quantification of nuclear STAT1 staining shown in panel C. images were merged with nuclear stain (blue; Hoechst) and white arrowheads mark neurons as determined by phase contrast. compared to mock (unless noted by brackets by brackets) we subsequently tested whether exogenous IFN- exposure could induce STAT1 nuclear localization in infected fibroblasts. in TG neurons, we observed STAT1 nuclear localization in 41% of ICP8-positive and 83% of ICP8-negative neurons. these results are consistent with the ability of HSV to inhibit STAT1 translocation (15, 68) adult TG neurons and fibroblasts are limited in their ability to respond directly to viral infection but are capable of responding to exogenous IFN- through STAT1 nuclear localization. supernatants were collected at 24 hpi, and IFN- production measured by ELISA. data points represent the averages of the means from at least two independent experiments. exogenous IFN- effectively restricts VSV but not HSV-1 replication in TG neurons. TG neurons, fibroblasts, and BMDCs were untreated or pretreated with 12.5 units/ml IFN- for 18 h. cells were untreated or treated with IFN- and infected as described for panel A. we observed statistically significant restricted HSV-1 replication in BMDCs and fibroblasts with the addition of exogenous IFN- in a STAT1-dependent manner. the results showed no impact of IFN on HSV-1 titers were also obtained from experiments performed at an MOI of 2 in neurons. at 48 hpi, ICP0 expression was observed in approximately 60% of neurons in strain 17-infected cultures with or without IFN- and in 60% of neurons in untreated 34.5 mutant-infected cultures. only 15% of neurons were ICP0 positive in IFN--treated 34.5 mutant-infected cultures, consistent with decreases in viral titers described above. the role of 34.5 in promoting replication in IFN--treated neurons is only partly dependent on the control of autophagy. 34.5 also modulates the autophagic pathway through binding to the host protein Beclin 1 (19). 3 viruses replicated with or without IFN- treatment in STAT1/ neurons. this suggests that the large decrease in 34.5 mutant replication in IFN-treated neurons is a combination of a failure to counter autophagy as well as an inability to counter the IFN-driven antiviral state. BMDCs are well characterized in their ability to mount a robust and effective antiviral response. as expected (10), WT BMDCs controlled HSV-1 replication. BMDCs deficient in antiviral signaling supported significantly higher viral titers. HSV-1 strain 17 replication in WT (129SVEV) and STAT1/ BMDCs, TG neurons, and fibroblasts infected at an MOI of 0.1, 20 and 0.5 respectively. data points represent a total from at least three (for neurons) or two (for BMDCs and fibroblasts) independent experiments each performed in triplicate. TG neurons lack the capacity to mount an effective IFN-driven antiviral response. we exposed neurons, fibroblasts, and BMDCs to IFN-. one hour post-IFN- exposure, we observed STAT1 nuclear localization in 99% of BMDCs. exogenous IFN- but not viral infection causes STAT1 relocalization to the nucleus of TG neurons. cells were mock infected, treated with 12.5 units/ml IFN- for 1 h. images were merged with nuclear stain (blue; Hoechst) 100 cells were quantified in 3 replicates with 100 cells quantified. significance was evaluated by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttests. in TG neurons, we observed STAT1 nuclear localization in 41% of ICP8-positive and 83% of ICP8-negative neurons. these results are consistent with the ability of HSV to inhibit STAT1 translocation. fibroblasts may be more sensitive to exogenous IFN or HSV may be more efficient at blocking STAT1 nuclear localization in neurons. supernatants were collected at 24 hpi, and IFN- production measured by ELISA. data points represent the averages of the means from at least two independent experiments. Error bars represent SEM. ND, not detectable. s, and BMDCs were untreated or pretreated with 12.5 units/ml IFN- for 18 h. cells were infected with VSV at an MOI of 20, 0.5, and 0.1 respectively. data points represent the average of the means from at least two independent experiments. we used an HSV-1 strain lacking 34.5 (34.5 mutant) a neurovirulence factor capable of reversing establishment of the antiviral state and meditating resistance to IFN (16, 17) this is in contrast to a significant STAT1-dependent attenuation of 34.5 mutant replication in fibroblasts and BMDCs relative to strain 17. 34.5 neutralizes the antiviral impact of exogenous IFN- on HSV-1 replication in TG neuronal cultures. 129SVEV TG neurons were infected with st17 and the 34.5 mutant with or without pretreatment with 12.5 units/ml IFN-. the role of 34.5 in promoting replication in IFN--treated neurons is only partly dependent on the control of autophagy. 34.5 also modulates the autophagic pathway through binding to the host protein Beclin 1 (19). the resistance to IFN- in TG neurons is only partly dependent on control of autophagy by the 34.5 mutant. cells were untreated or treated with 12.5 units/ml IFN- for 18 h and then infected at an MOI of 20, and sample titers were determined at 48 hpi. adult fibroblasts showed limited STAT1 nuclear localization and IFN- production upon infection. but this pathway is counteracted by HSV and VSV. no difference in VSV or HSV-1 replication between untreated fibroblasts. in the absence of 34.5, HSV-1 is as sensitive to IFN as VSV. a virus lacking ICP0 showed no difference in replication in STAT1 and WT neurons with or without IFN. together these data suggest that the resistance of HSV to the neuronal antiviral response is specific to 34.5. limiting level of 34.5 expression during natural infections in vivo may contribute to the susceptibility of HSV-1 to innate defense. 34.5 also modulates autophagy through its Beclin-binding domain (BBD) (19), and this activity promotes HSV replication in the nervous system (24). IFN can promote survival of HSV-1-infected sensory neurons (72). lack of an effective autocrine response in infected neurons and requirement for paracrine IFN signaling may help ensure that the antiviral response acts to balance viral clearance."}
