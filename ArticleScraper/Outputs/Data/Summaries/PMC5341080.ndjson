{"summary": "4 years of pediatric severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) sentinel surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi, identified factors associated with clinical severity and coviral clustering. we assessed risk factors for clinical severity and conducted clustering analysis to identify viral clusters in children with viral codetection. in 2010, a monovalent vaccine campaign targeting 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) achieved 74% coverage in pregnant women and 7% of the overall population. an estimated 2.5% of children aged 15 years are HIV infected. SARI with warning signs was considered clinically more severe. admission to the hospital, chest recession, or blood oxygen saturation of 90%. hospital attendance (not admission) was required for study enrollment. informed consent was obtained from guardians of all study participants. denominators for HIV and age strata were derived by apportioning the total HIV prevalence among Malawian children aged 0\u201314 years [18] parsimonious models were developed by stepwise logistic regression. retaining age, sex a priori, and explanatory factors with a 2-sided P value of.05. Adjusted relative risk ratios were derived from these models. the HIV prevalence in children aged 5 years on QECH nonsurgical pediatric wards is estimated at 6%. 25.2% of patients have a malaria parasite\u2013positive blood slide. malaria presentations to the PAEU peak from December to May were screened. total nucleic acids were extracted from 300-L aliquots of each specimen. the quantity of nucleic acid used per reaction was 5 L for the centers for disease control and prevention. denominators for HIV and age strata were derived by applying age-specific HIV prevalence estimates to census figures for Blantyre District's population aged 0\u201314 years [18] the former were obtained by apportioning the total HIV prevalence among Malawian children aged 15 years [14] according to age distribution of pediatric HIV infections in Mozambique. in the nasopharynx of patients with viral codetection, we performed nearest-neighbor discrete hierarchical cluster analysis in patients with viral codetection. distance was based on similarity of viral pathogens detected in the nasopharynx of patients with SARI. eight of 17 HIV infections in cases aged 3 to 12 months (47.1%) were confirmed by PCR. PCR confirmed the number of cases aged 10\u201314 years. 131 (26.8).001 HIV positived 120 (5.6) 65 (4.2) 55 (9.8).001 80 (4.6) 48 (10.6).001 Weight-for-age z score 2 SDd 449 (20.9) 325 (20.2) 124 (22.9).169 353 (20.5) 98 (22.4).370 Malaria parasite positived 78 (3.5) 47 (2.9) 31 (5.3).007 52 (2.9) 27 (5.6) clinical featuref Recorded fever 1048 (46.4) 618 (37.3) 430 (71.1)001 708 (39.9) 340 (69.5)001 Fast breathing 1805 (79.8) 1318 (79.6) 487 (80.5)652 1398 (78.9) 407 (83.2)001 Vomiting/diarrhea 392 (17.4) 264 (15.9) 128 (21.2) 201 of 1835 cases (10.9%), rhinoviruses in 358 of 1835 (19.5%), adenovirus in 162 of 1835 (8.8%) in 542 of 1835 SARI cases (30%), no viral pathogen was detected. parainfluenza virus 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 2 3 39. parainfluenza virus 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 4 2 14. %b 29.0 40.6 27.3 52.5 62.3 70.6 55.3 66.7 79.7 52.6 42.9 30.4 51.7 35.9 42.9 93.2 29.5 40.8 Abbreviations: influenza virus\u2013positive SARI cases increased during the rainy season (January\u2013April) in all 4 years of surveillance. a second peak of influenza virus\u2013positive SARI cases, occurring during September\u2013October, was confined to 2013 and 2014. influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were most prevalent in 2012, in the latter half of 2013, and in 2014. peaks in the first half of the rainy season (January\u2013March; Figure 1). 1.4 (1.1\u20131.9).069 Age 3 mo to 6 mo 269 (12.0) 250 (12.6) 19 (7.6) Reference Reference 6 mo to 12 mo 576 (25.7) 536 (26.9) 40 (16.1) 0.9 (.5\u20131.6).959 12 mo to 36 mo 1071 (47.8) 943 (47.4) 128 (51.4) 1.6 (.9\u20132.8).084 1.7 (1.1\u20132.9).046 36 mo to 60 mo 241 (10.8) 198 077 2.1 (1.2\u20133.6).009 HIV statuse Negative 1973 (94.3) 1747 (94.2) 226 (95.4) Reference...

HIV exposure was associated with higher SARI incidence and greater SARI severity in HIV-uninfected children. influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and RSV were most prevalent viruses detected. yearly influenza vaccination should be considered in routine pediatric HIV clinical care.
