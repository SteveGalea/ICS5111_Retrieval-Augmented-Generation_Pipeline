{"summary": "a total of 457 fresh fecal samples were collected from piglets under 9 weeks old during 2013-2015 from organized (n=225) and unorganized (n=232) farms of manipur, meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. samples were processed for the isolation of E. coli and salmonella. this is the first systematic study of the coinfection of four important diarrheagenic bacterial and viral agents associated with piglet diarrhea in India. the region has the highest pig population in the country with 3.95 million compared to 10.29 million pig population in the whole country. infectious diarrhea of neonatal animals is one of the most common and economically devastating conditions encountered in the livestock industry. some of the diarrheas are self-limiting, some are associated with high morbidity, and others are associated with high mortality. in food animal species, an array of infectious agents including bacteria, viruses, and parasites cause acute and chronic diarrhea in piglets. coli, salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus coinfecting pathogens from piglets of organized and unorganized farms of four northeastern hilly states of India. samples were collected from diarrheic (n=339) and non-diarrheic (n=118) piglets including indigenous local (n=130) and crossbreed (n=327) piglets. samples were streaked directly on eosin methylene blue agar plates. characteristic pink-colored colonies were streaked on eosin methylene blue agar plates. colonies with characteristic metallic sheen were studied for their characteristics. Detection of Rotavirus Groups A and C was performed by targeting VP7 gene [22] and VP6 gene [23], respectively. specific primers were used for the detection of Picobirnavirus genogroup I. bacterial virulence genes of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, eaeA), Shiga-toxigenic E. coli (STEC, stx1, stx2), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (hlyA) were evaluated by multiplex PCR. 1X Tris-borate-EDTA buffer by electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/ml) DNA fragments were observed by ultraviolet transilluminator and photographed in a gel documentation system. all samples were processed for the isolation and identification of E. coli and Salmonella. fecal samples were screened for the presence of Rotavirus and Picobirnavirus. samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to prepare a 10% (w/v) fecal suspension. RNA was subjected to RNA-PAGE followed by silver staining as per standard procedure. oligonucleotides and PCR conditions used in the present study.

DNA fragments were photographed in a gel documentation system. a total of three samples were positive for coinfection with at least two pathogens. a total of three samples were positive for coinfection with at least two pathogens. one diarrheic sample was found positive for S. Typhimurium (stn), S. Typhimurium (invasive, invA gene), and Picobirnavirus GG1. two diarrheic fecal samples were found positive for both S. Typhimurium (stn) and STEC (stx2). the occurrence of coinfection was found to be most common during summer season (n=6; 4.68%), followed by winter (n=3; 2.27%), spring (n=1; 1.07%), and autumn (n=1; 0.96%), respectively. coinfection of at least two infectious pathogens is recorded in 2.4%. RVA is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in neonatal pigs compared to Type C. other researchers have detected porcine Rotavirus in diarrheic fecal samples in nursing, weaning, and post-weaning pigs either alone or in combination of other enteric pathogens. this is in agreement with our finding in which RVA was detected only in one diarrheic sample as coinfection with EPEC. crossbreed piglets recorded higher detection of mixed infection than local indigenous piglets. coinfection of enteric pathogens was found to be most common during the summer (June-August) in crossbreed than indigenous piglets population. a total of 11 diarrheic fecal samples were detected for a combination of at least two different enteric pathogens. this is suggestive of the fact that a number of enteric pathogens may cause diarrhea either singly or in combination. a number of enteric pathogens may cause diarrhea either singly or in combination. HK collected the samples and executed the isolation, biochemical, and molecular characterization work. HK, TK, PR, and PKS analyzed the data and monitored the results. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
