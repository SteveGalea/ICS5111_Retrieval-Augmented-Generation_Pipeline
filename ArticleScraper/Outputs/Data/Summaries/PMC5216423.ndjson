{"summary": "effective and safe vaccines capable of undergoing mass production provide the prospect of eradication of certain diseases. despite this, some recently introduced advanced vaccines are markedly more costly. eliciting protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to epitopes within conserved viral proteins is another means to the same end (7). the development of human viral vaccines and their licensing remain behind those achieved with animal vaccines. the term \u201cmultivalent/polyvalent\u201d refers to an agent that is effective against different types of the same organism. in general, an infection consisting of multiple pathogens is generally described as a multipathogen disease or simply multidisease. the following nomenclature is proposed to distinguish the different types of combined vaccines. we will compare and contrast the larger viral vectors that are likely to serve as backbones for future broad-spectrum multipathogen and multivalent vaccines. table 1 provides an overview of the current multivalent and multipathogen viral vector vaccines that are under investigation. challenge virus neutralized 82 HA of A/Netherlands/219/03 and A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 Into the E1 region Mice (BALB/c) i.m., 1 108 PFU i.n., 100 MID50 of influenza virus Egypt/08, TK/VA, G1/99, pH1N1, or X-31. human parainfluenza virus type 3 Measles, respiratory tract infection HA of MV Edmonston Between N/P, P/M, or HN/L genes Golden Syrian hamster i.n., 1 106 PFU Wild-type PIV3 (1 106 PFU) 100- to 1,000-fold reduction of PIV3 virus titers 49 Measles virus Measles, hepatitis B HBsAg and/or HBcA day 29, day 57 Measles, HIV Gag-Pol fusion protein and gp140dCFI (e1), or Gag-Pol fusion protein and gp140dV1/2dCFI (e2) of HIV-1 clade B G-P between H/L gene and e1/e2 between P/M Mice (IFNAR, CD46) i.p., 1 104 or 1 105 PFU (wk 0, wk 4) i i.n., 1 105 PFU SARS-CoV 100% of animals protected 90 Measles, SARS Nucleocapsid protein, spike glycoprotein (SARS-CoV Urbani) Between P/M genes Mice (IFNAR, CD46) i.p., 1 104 PFU (wk 0, wk 4, or wk 8) 91 Measles, dengue fever EDIII from E protein (aae 295 to 39 asterisk indicates a multivalent/polyvalent vaccine candidate. two asterisks indicate a vaccine candidate that advanced to phase 1 clinical studies. multidisease/multipathogen vector vaccine. key protective antigens from two or more pathogens in a single vector to immunize against several diseases. in this minireview, we will detail existing multipathogen and multivalent viral vector vaccines. we will draw a distinction between simple multipathogen vaccines where the vector itself forms a part of the protective agent (for example, recombinant vaccinia viruses with the theoretical but currently irrelevant potential to induce immunity to smallpox) the challenge virus was neutralized 82 HA of A/Netherlands/219/03 and A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 Into the E1 region Mice (BALB/c) i.m., 1 108 PFU i.n., 100 MID50 of influenza virus Egypt/08, TK/VA, G1/99, pH1N1 or X-31 Provide the same HA subtype was included in vaccine, the challenge virus was neutralized low dose group: 83.3%; medium/high dose group: 100% of animals protected Coxsackievirus group B Myocarditis Hexon protein L1 loop of AdV2 Between capsid protein P-1D and protease P-2A Mice (BALB/c) i.p., 5 105 TCID50 (a: day 0; b: day 0, day 14; c: day 0, day 14, day 28) p160 (HIV-1 isolate, 89.6), V3 loop deletion Between P/M or H/L Mice (IFNAR, CD46) i.p., 15 106 TCID50 85 Measles, HIV F4 antigen (= p24 [BH10], RT [HXB2], Nef [Bru-Lai], and p17 [BH10]) of HIV-1 subtype B Between P/M genes Mice (IFNAR, CD virus WNVc E protein (IS-98-STI) Between P/M genes Mice (IFNAR, CD46) 1 104 or 1 106 TCID50 (wk 0, wk 4) i.p., LD50 of WNV IS-98-ST1 100% of animals protected 89 Mice (BALB/c) 2 l pooled immune sera from IFNAR CD46 mice. i.p., 1 103, 1 104, or 1 105 TCID50 (wk 0, wk 4) i.p., 1 102 PFU CHIKV 06-49 (= 33 times LD50) 100% survival (immunized with 104 or 105 TCID50); 83% survival (immunized with 103 TCID50)** 26, 27 Modified vaccinia Ankara Influenza H5N1 strains* a wide variety of viruses have been investigated as single-pathogen vector vaccines. remarkably fewer have been used for multivalent and multipathogen applications. the viral vector has to meet several requirements to be considered suitable multipathogen or multivalent vectors. measles virus (MV) is an exclusively human pathogen. it is an enveloped virus in the family of Paramyxoviridae with a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. MV replication occurs strictly in cytoplasm of infected cells. recombinant rMVb2-HPV-L1 did not exhibit a reduced growth kinetic compared to that of the 'empty' MV. no difference in the immune response to MV was observed with the recombinant virus. a recombinant measles vaccine expressing chikungunya virus-like particles was generated using a helper cell line rescue approach (24) a recombinant measles vaccine expressing chikungunya virus-like particles was generated using a helper cell line rescue approach. all of the mice that were immunized with 103 TCID50 of MV-CHIKV were completely protected from CHIKV even when there was preexisting immunity to MV. all of the control mice injected with the MV Schwarz strain developed disease and died. the impact of preexisting anti-measles immunity on the MV-CHIKV vaccine candidate was investigated. the authors conclude that a phase 2 clinical trial is warranted to evaluate this promising vaccine candidate further. the cAdVax vectors are replication-defective adenovirus vector platforms with deleted E1, E3 and E4 genes. the cAdVaxES/Z vaccine candidate was able to induce SEBOV and EBOV Ebola-specific antibodies to both strain responses and cell-mediated immune responses. four different cAdVax vectors were designed, the EBO2 vector containing two copies of the nucleoprotein (NP) of ZEBOV, the EBO7 vector expressing glycoproteins (GPs) of EBOV and SEBOV, the M8 vector expressing the Ci67 and Ravn GPs, and the M11 vector expressing the Musoke GP and NP genes. all vaccinated primates were 100% protected against ZEBOV and SEBO vaccinated macaques were challenged with 500 PFU of ZEBOV, 800 PFU of SEBOV, or 800 PFU SEBOV followed by 1,100 PFU ZEBOV. the vaccine protected the vaccinated macaques after aerosol challenge with either virus in an otherwise lethal dose. the first vaccines against VZV were developed as early as 1984. presently used vaccines consisting of live attenuated VZV have been monitored for years and have demonstrated a high safety profile. the host range of VZV is restricted to humans, obstructing uncontrolled environmental spread. both vaccine candidates induced neutralizing antibodies against the VZV vector. the animals immunized with either vaccine candidate mounted slightly higher titers. only slight differences in the immune responses of both recombinant constructs were observed. a combined vaccination strategy, including PIV and MV, has been suggested. the viral backbone was generated from wild-type PIV3 through recovery from plasmid-borne cDNA using recombinant DNA technology. attenuated versions of wild-type PIV3 have been developed. six serotypes of group B coxsackievirus (CVB1 to CVB6) have been described. all CVBs incorporate four capsid proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. strong immune responses are generated following an infection (50) the CVB3-Ad2L1 vaccine candidate was able to induce anti-CVB3 and anti-Ad2 hexon L1 loop-neutralizing and -binding antibodies. preexisting anti-CVB antibodies boosted the immune response further and led to even higher levels of anti-Ad2 antibodies in mice. large genome size of VacV (190 kbp) allows insertion of large amounts of foreign DNA (25 to 30 kb) by homologous recombination, direct cloning, or bacterial artificial chromosome technology. vacia virus can also be applied via different routes (injection, oral) and induce long-lasting immunity. many unsuccessful efforts to develop vaccines for complex diseases can be overcome with a poxviral antigen presentation platform. rMVAtor carrying only the A/Vietnam/1203/04 gene was constructed. the monovalent candidate induced only poor hemagglutination inhibition titers for the homologous viruses. cross-clade immunity against 20 heterologous H5N1 clades was confirmed in guinea pigs that were vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine candidate. the poxviral vector seems to be an excellent delivery vehicle, as it has been proven safe and efficient in many monovalent recombinant vaccine candidates. rMVb2-HPV-L1 induced strong humoral immune responses against MV and HPV in transgenic interferon alpha receptor-deficient mice. rMVb2-HPV-L1 was injected intraperitoneally with rMVb2-HPV-L1 or the parental MV at day 0 and 4 weeks later with 105 PFU. a recombinant measles vaccine expressing chikungunya virus-like particles was generated using a helper cell line rescue approach. the recombinant virus is an alphavirus with a positive RNA genome and is transmitted by mosquitoes especially in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. a plaque reduction neutralization test showed CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies were induced. a challenge study with 100 PFU of CHIKV 06-49 was performed. all of the mice that were immunized with 103 TCID50 of MV-CHIKV survived. high dose (3.0 105 TCID50 per 1 ml) of MV-CHIKV suspended in HEPES buffer with ammonium sulfate, priorix, or placebo (sterile saline) on day 0 and 28. the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the blood of participants were lower in the low dose and Priorix vaccine groups than in the medium and high dose groups. the cAdVax vectors are replication-defective adenovirus vector platforms with deleted E1, E3 and E4 genes. the vectors are replication-defective adenovirus vector platforms with deleted E1, E3, and E4 genes. all vaccinated primates were 100% protected against ZEBOV and SEBOV. the three marburg virus species (36) were 100% protected against MARV. cynomolgus macaques were injected intramuscularly into cynomolgus macaques. macaques with equal mixture of M8 and EBO7 led to similar levels of antibodies against ZEBOV and SEBOV. the simultaneous administration of both vaccine candidates (M8 and EBO7) did not interfere with the levels of antibodies generated against ZEBOV or SEBOV. the use of replication-defective vectors reduces this risk but may not eliminate it completely. the first vaccines against VZV were developed as early as 1984. the first vaccines against VZV were developed as early as 1984. syncytium formation leading to cell detachment in MRC-5 cells. both vaccine candidates induced neutralizing antibodies against the VZV vector. only slight differences in immune responses of both recombinant constructs were observed. the parenterally administered standard MV vaccine harbors the risk of being neutralized during the first months of life by serum antibodies passively transferred from mother to baby. a new MV vaccine candidate bypassing this would be a valuable asset in infant vaccination schedules. six serotypes of group B coxsackievirus (CVB1 to CVB6) have been described. all CVBs incorporate four capsid proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. strong immune responses (cellular and humoral) are generated following an infection (50) murine immunogenicity studies were performed to investigate the potential of the CVB3-Ad2L1 vaccine candidate to generate a humoral immune response. the results showed that the CVB3-Ad2L1 vaccine candidate was able to induce anti-CVB3 and anti-Ad2 hexon L1 loop-neutralizing and -binding antibodies. the most widely used candidate for vaccine design is the vaccinia virus (VacV) this virus exhibits unique features that qualify it for use as an effective expression system and ideal recombinant vector. the large genome size of VacV (190 kbp) allows the insertion of large amounts of foreign DNA (25 to 30 kb) by homologous recombination, direct cloning, or bacterial artificial chromosome technology. deletion sites have been shown to function as insertion sites for foreign genes into the MVA genome. foreign genes can also be inserted upstream from endogenous poxviral promoters. fear of the next influenza pandemic has driven efforts toward the development of novel vaccines. MVtor-tri-HA vaccine candidate conferred complete protection from weight loss and death in immunized mice. cross-clade immunity against 20 heterologous H5N1 clades was confirmed after a serological surveillance study in guinea pigs that were vaccinated with the trivalent vaccine candidate. polyvalent and multipathogen viral vector vaccines hold great promise. they deliver multiple immunogens into the cells of the vaccinee. this route of antigen presentation holds the promise of long-lasting protection without numerous booster vaccinations. the enormous potential of viral vector vaccines drives the continuous development of novel expression vectors. the insertion of various transgenes into a vector is of course likely to lead to an impairment of virus replication. vaccine candidate into existing vaccine schedule will lead to major improvement in public health. this would pave the way for taking multipathogen and multivalent vaccine candidates from the bench into clinical settings."}
