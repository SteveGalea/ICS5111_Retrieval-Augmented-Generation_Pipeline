{"summary": "cross fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a rare type of renal dysplasia causing the kidneys to fuse so that both are located on the same side of the body. despite receiving intensive treatment, the cat died. a mature intact male Persian cat presented with a haemorrhagic nasal discharge and ascites. the cat was treated in a local veterinary clinic for several days but did not respond to therapy. there were no records for vaccination and anthelmintic treatment. thoracic radiography revealed mild, diffuse pulmonary infiltration mixed with an alveolar and interstitial pattern in the left cranial lung lobe. bacterial pneumonia was strongly suspected owing to the cat\u2019s clinical condition. renal dimensions (parenchymal thickness) of superiorly and tandemly situated kidneys were 27 36 (8.8) mm and 26 32 (8.1) mm respectively. ureter of the left ectopic kidney crossed over the midline. ureterovesical junctions were normally located. renal pelvic dilations were not clearly observed. cat was diagnosed with left-to-right CFRE complicated with FIP and respiratory tract infection. cat was treated with doxycycline (5 mg/kg PO q12h; Pifzer) and cefotaxime (40 mg/kg IV q8h; Kyungnam) with occasional nebulisation therapy for 1 week. clinical signs worsened with this intensive treatment and the cat died. a previous human study found that CFRE is twice as prevalent in men than in women. the affected cat in this study was male and had CFRE characterised by an inferior crossed fusion. findings of renal ultrasound in humans with CFRE are an anterior and/or posterior notch in the kidney with two ureters entering into the urinary bladder, an abnormal arterial supply and venous drainage, calyceal distortion, hydronephrosis and urolithisasis. the most common type of CFRE is inferior crossed fusion CFRE, in which the ectopic left kidney is positioned inferiorly and the orthotopic right kidney is positioned superiorly. yeloplasty for relieving pelviureteric junction obstructions and reimplantation of the ureter could be an option for cats with CFRE with recurrent upper urinary tract obstructions. hypertension has been reported in humans with CFRE and may occur as a result of aberrant arterial supply to fused kidneys. practitioners should include this anomaly as a case of a recurrent UTI or pelvic dilation in cats."}
