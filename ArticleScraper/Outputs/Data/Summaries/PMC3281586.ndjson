{"summary": "the first evidence that gene expression in HIV-1 also requires viral transacting factors came from experiments by sodroski et al. (1985a,b) the expression of reporter genes placed under the control of the viral LTR was dependent on a transactivating factor, which they named Tat. it quickly became apparent that TAR was not a typical transcription element. the diagram on the left shows the bases in TAR that are recognized by Tat in the TAR bulge region and by CycT1 in the TAR loop region (red bases) the structures at right show the conformational changes induced by Tat binding. the amino-terminal \u201cactivation\u201d domain of Tat binds to the CDK9 T-loop. urcher et al. (1990) postulated that a cellular cofactor interacts with the RNA loop. the first direct evidence that Tat might be regulating HIV-1 transcriptional elongation came from RNase protection experiments performed by Kao et al. a putative \u201cloop factor\u201d complex formation requires both the binding site and the loop sequence. your browser is not supporting the HTML5 video> element. you may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice. the structure shows that Tat forms extensive contacts both with the CycT1 subunit of P-TEFb and also with the T-loop of the Cdk9 subunit. the binding of Tat to P-TEFb induces significant conformational changes in CDK9 that constitutively activate the enzyme. NELF-E is highly restricted by the negative elongation factor NELF. NELF-E subunit is able to bind directly to TAR RNA. cell-free transcription studies have shown that NELF may be recruited to the HIV-1 provirus via its interactions with TAR. phosphorylation of Spt5 separates it from the rest of the complex and converts it into a positive elongation factor that stabilizes transcription complexes at terminator sequences. Tat and P-TEFb are able to stimulate HIV-1 elongation both through the removal of blocks to elongation imposed by NELF and DSIF. essential components of the 7SK RNP complex include HEXIM1 or HEXIM2, which inhibit the CDK9 kinase in a 7SK-dependent manner. the sequestration of P-TEFb in the 7SK RNP complex effectively prevents any basal transcriptional activation by Tat-independent recruitment of P-TEFb to the provirus. the core promoter is a powerful and highly optimized promoter. it includes three tandem SP1 binding sites (Jones et al. 1986), an efficient TATA element (Garcia et al. 1989) and a highly active initiator sequence (Zenzie-Gregory et al. 1993). proviruses assemble an ordered nucleosomal structure surrounding the promoter. epigenetic modifications of the provirus restrict transcription initiation. transcription from latent proviruses is restricted by high levels of histone deacetylases. the virus remains poised to resume its replication in response to triggers that stimulate transcription initiation and restore Tat levels. this switching mechanism crucially depends on the autoregulation of Tat; when Tat is expressed in trans from an ectopic promoter, HIV-1 proviruses become constitutively active. binds to the TAR RNA element encoded in the HIV-1 leader sequence. small changes in initiation efficiency, caused by epigenetic silencing or reductions in NF-B levels in the cell, reduce Tat levels and inhibit transcription, driving the HIV-1 provirus into latency. positive feedback by Tat results in a bistable switch. P-TEFb is the essential cofactor for Tat. there is a strict correlation between the ability of TAR RNA to bind to Tat. mutations in the apical loop of the TAR element that do not interfere with Tat binding also interfere with transactivation. wei et al. (1998) found that P-TEFb contains a cyclin component, CycT1, which can form a stable complex with CDK9, Tat, and TAR RNA. a set of novel CDK-9 protein kinase inhibitors were shown to be selective inhibitors of HIV-1 transcription. 61 into the murine CycT1 restored Tat-mediated transactivation. the crystal structure of a Tat:pTEFb complex was determined in 2010. the binding of Tat to P-TEFb induces significant conformational changes in CDK9 that constitutively activate the enzyme. the presence of hyperphosphorylated RNAP II and Spt5 allows enhanced transcription of the full HIV-1 genome. the majority of the P-TEFb in cells is found in a transcriptionally inactive snRNP complex containing 7SK RNA, HEXIM, and the RNA binding proteins MePCE and LARP7. RNA polymerase is highly enriched for phosphorylated Ser2 residues in the CTD. phosphorylation of Spt5 separates it from the rest of the complex and converts it into a positive elongation factor that stabilizes transcription complexes at terminator sequences. elongation factor ELL2 is critical both for basal HIV-1 transcription and Tat-mediated transactivation. P-TEFb activity is tightly regulated and the majority of the enzyme is sequestered into a large inactive 7SK RNP complex. essential components of the 7SK RNP complex include HEXIM1 or HEXIM2, which inhibit the CDK9 kinase in a 7SK-dependent manner. the 7SK RNP complex effectively prevents basal transcriptional activation by Tat-independent recruitment of P-TEFb to the provirus. the HIV-1 LTR includes multiple upstream DNA regulatory elements that serve as binding sites for cellular transcription initiation factors. each of these elements participate in the cooperative binding of the initiation factor TFIID and its associated TAF cofactors to the TATA element. signaling through the viral enhancer is essential to reactivate latent proviruses and support virus replication in primary T-cells. you may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice. insightful studies by Weinberger et al. and Burnett et al. have emphasized how stochastic fluctuations in Tat gene expression can act as a molecular switch. small changes in initiation rates can be experimentally mimicked by introducing mutations into the NF-B and Sp1 binding sites. all spliced mRNAs include the highly structured noncoding exon 1 that extends from the 5\u2032 cap to 5\u2032ss D1. the dark blue rectangles indicate open reading frames and are labeled with the gene names. mRNA isoforms containing neither exon 2 nor 3, or both exons 2 and 3 are shown as purple bars within the exons. splicing enhancers are designated by green bars and splicing silencers are designated by red bars. a few viral mRNA isoforms are also produced by inclusion of exons flanked by 3\u2032ss A1 and 5\u2032ss D2 (exon 2) and/or the exon flanked by analysis of HIV-1 mRNA species in virus-infected cells showed striking differences in the relative abundance of the different viral mRNA species. in general, HIV-1 3\u2032 splice sites are relatively inefficient in comparison to constitutive cellular 3\u2032 splice sites. splicing at 3\u2032ss A3 is repressed by an ESS element within exon 3 (ESSV) ed nef and rev mRNAs become the most abundant spliced mRNA species in the HIV-1-infected cell. the GAR ESE is selectively bound by several SR proteins. the most important player in the function of the element is SF2/ASF. splicing at the relatively weak 3\u2032ss A1 is required for high vif mRNA expression and inclusion of the noncoding exon 2. replication of these mutants exhibit greater sensitivity than wild-type virus to inhibition by the cellular restriction factor APOBEC3G. the dramatic effects of these splicing element mutations show that maximum virus replication requires tight regulation of splicing to balance mRNA and genome RNA production. the region of the HIV-1 env gene between 5\u2032ss D4 and 3\u2032ss A7 that contains the RRE is removed in the completely spliced mRNAs. full-length unspliced 9-kb, incompletely spliced 4-kb mRNA, and completely spliced 1.8-kb mRNAs are expressed at both early and late times. oligomerization of Rev on the RRE is highly cooperative. oligomerization of Rev on the RRE is approximately 500 times higher than Rev binding to the high affinity site alone. the NES is an extended unstructured region emerging from one face of the Rev molecule. the core arginine-rich RNA binding domains interact with the RRE. the NES interacts with the karyopherin family member Crm1. this destabilizes the Rev complex and releases factors from the RRE. in the Rev dimer, the arginine-rich RNA-binding helices are located at the ends of a V-shaped assembly. this allows the dimer to bind adjacent RNA sites and structurally couples dimerization and RNA recognition. cellular RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in the retention mediated by CRS/INS elements including poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1), heterogeneous ribonuclear protein A1 (hnRNP A1) and the heterodimer of two related proteins polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) and p54(nrb) cytoplasmic fate of unspliced HIV-1 RNA appears to be strongly the cleavage reaction requires mammalian cleavage factors CF1m, CF2m, and poly(A) polymerase. the cleavage reaction requires a duplicated set of AAUAAA and GU-rich core elements at the ends of the R sequences found in both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 LTRs. HIV-1 Translation Initiation Initiation of translation of eukaryotic mRNAs involves scanning from the 5\u2032 cap until an initiator AUG is recognized. some of the HIV-1 mRNA UTRs contain AUG sequences upstream of the authentic initiator AUG that interfere with translation initiation at the authentic AUG. in HIV-1, a 1 shift in the translational reading frame is required to shift from the Gag reading frame to the pro and pol reading frame. this frameshift occurs 5% of the time and results in the production of about one Gag-Pro-Pol precursor for every 20 Gag precursors synthesized. two essential cis-acting sequence elements located 200 nt upstream of the Gag termination codon are required for frameshifting. d bicistronic mRNA species encode both Env and Vpu; incompletely spliced mRNAs for Vif, Vpr, and a truncated 72 aa form of Tat. all spliced mRNAs include the highly structured noncoding exon 1 that extends from the 5\u2032 cap to 5\u2032ss D1. mRNA species designated by an \u201cI\u201d are incompletely spliced mRNA species. mRNA isoforms containing neither exon 2 nor 3, only exon 2 or 3 or both exons 2 and 3. locations of the known splicing regulatory elements in HIV-1 are shown as purple bars. there are intronic and exonic splicing silencers (ISSs and ESSs, respectively) which repress splicing. splicing at 3\u2032ss A3 is repressed by an ESS element within exon 3 (ESSV), which results in relatively low levels of vpr mRNA. GAR ESE activity is able to raise the levels of incompletely spliced env/vpu mRNAs and completely spliced nef and rev mRNAs. the GAR ESE is selectively bound by several SR proteins. the most important player in the function of the element is SF2/ASF. mutations of 5\u2032ss D2 that decrease affinity for U1 snRNP result in decreased inclusion of exon 2 and decreased levels of vif mRNA and Vif protein. the replication of these mutants exhibit greater sensitivity than wild-type virus to inhibition by the cellular restriction factor APOBEC3G. the dramatic effects of these splicing element mutations show that maximum virus replication requires tight regulation of splicing. fully spliced 1.8-kb mRNAs are constitutively exported to the cytoplasm. the region of the HIV-1 env gene between 5\u2032ss D4 and 3\u2032ss A7 that contains the RRE is removed in the completely spliced mRNAs. full-length unspliced 9-kb, incompletely spliced 4-kb mRNA, and completely spliced 1.8-kb mRNA oligomerization of Rev on the RRE is highly cooperative and results in an affinity approximately 500 times higher than Rev binding to the high affinity site alone. oligomerization of Rev on the RRE is highly cooperative. the NES is an extended unstructured region emerging from one face of the Rev molecule. the core arginine-rich RNA binding domains interact with the RRE. the NES interacts with the nuclear export complex containing CRM-1. the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP facilitated by the proteins RanGAP (Ran GTPase-activating protein) and RanBP1. this destabilizes the Rev complex and releases factors from the RRE. this destabilizes the Rev complex and releases factors from the RRE. a number of different cellular RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in the retention mediated by CRS/INS elements. the cytoplasmic fate of unspliced HIV-1 RNA appears to be strongly influenced by the choice of RNA export pathway. the AAUAAA signal is recognized by the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) the GU-rich motif is recognized by CstF. the cleavage reaction requires mammalian cleavage factors CF1m, CF2m, and poly(A) polymerase. HIV-1 Translation Initiation Initiation of translation of eukaryotic mRNAs involves scanning from the 5\u2032 cap until an initiator AUG is recognized. some of the HIV-1 mRNA UTRs contain AUG sequences upstream of the authentic initiator AUG that can interfere with translation initiation. aUG involves 5\u2032 cap-dependent ribosome shunting in which the scanning ribosome jumps over large regions of the mRNA before recognizing the correct initiation codon. in HIV-1, a 1 shift in the translational reading frame is required to shift from the Gag reading frame to the pro and pol reading frame. two essential cis-acting sequence elements located 200 nt upstream of the Gag termination codon are required for frameshifting. d features of transcription elongation control, RNA splicing, and RNA export still to be discovered. complexes between TAR RNA and the intact P-TEFb molecule have yet to be tackled. a challenging problem is to understand the coupling that occurs between transcriptional elongation, the regulation of splicing, polyadenylation, and RNA export. Tat and Rev are both required for active viral replication. they are essential for the emergence of viruses from latency."}
