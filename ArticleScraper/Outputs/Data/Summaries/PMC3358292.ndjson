{"summary": "ACE2 is a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). it degrades angiotensin (Ang) II to the seven amino acid peptide fragment Ang-(1-7). expression is especially high in the kidney, particularly within cells of the proximal tubule [3]\u2013[5]. the presence of urinary ACE2 has not been studied in renal transplant recipients. the principle objective of the present study was to determine if urinary ACE2 activity, protein, and mRNA can be detected in these patients. this study involved recruitment of human subjects as described below, with written informed consent. 50 other transplant recipients were patients without significant proteinuria. subjects excluded if they were taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, or renin inhibitors. a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and primary renal diagnoses were obtained. a standard curve was generated by performing 12 serial dilutions of human recombinant ACE2 (50 ng/ml), provided with the kit, with the limit of detection ranging from 0.391 to 25 ng/mL. the average intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for the assay was 2.9%, and the average inter-assay CV value was 8.7% (n = 10) Urinary Ang II and Ang-(1-7) levels were measured using a commercial peptide radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit that contains an Ang-(1-7)-selective polyclonal antibody. 125I-Ang II (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA, USA), essentially as described [16], [17] study subjects were 50 healthy controls (age >18 yrs), recruited from the hospital or research centre staff, with no history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes. at the time of enrollment, half of the transplant subjects (n = 50) were also enrolled in an ongoing randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of the ACE inhibitor ramipril on transplant outcomes. aliquoted and centrifuged at 12000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. results were corrected for urinary albumin concentration. ACE2 and ACE enzyme activity assays were measured using synthetic substrates. urine samples were centrifuged at 1000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. deglycosylated urinary ACE2 protein fragments were detected by western analysis. a linear regression model was constructed to identify potential explanatory variables for urinary ACE2 and ACE levels in the 100 transplant subjects. the dependent variable was the measure under study (e.g. ACE2 activity) the following explanatory variables were entered into the model. variables were forced in simultaneously and removed from the model if not statistically significant. uppressant therapy comprised of prednisone, a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate, ACR: urine albumin to Cr ratio, CNI: calcineurin inhibitor, and corticosteroid. urinary ACE2 protein by ELISA was significantly increased in transplant patients compared to controls. western analyses revealed a significant increase in urinary ACE2 protein in transplant patients compared to controls. y ACE2 protein by western analyses was performed on both urinary ACE2 bands (120 kDa and 90 kDa) the sum of the two bands was used for quantitative comparisons. there was no significant association between diabetes mellitus and urinary ACE2. urinary ACE2 protein levels by ELISA were significantly increased in subjects with diabetes pre-transplant (n = 21), compared to subjects who developed diabetes after transplant (n = 17; p = 0.024). the box represents 50% of the values (25th and 75th percentiles), with the upper bar representing the 90th percentile. recombinant human ACE2 protein (hACE2) used as a positive control. Lanes 1\u20133, No Diabetes. Lanes 4\u20136, Diabetes. Lane 7: recombinant human ACE2 protein (hACE2), used as a positive control. an increase in urinary ACR was associated with urinary ACE2 protein by ELISA. female gender was associated with higher urinary ACE2 mRNA levels in transplant patients. ACE activity was detected in 94% of urine samples of transplant patients. ACE mRNA was detected in 65% of urine samples of transplant patients. no significant difference between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. ACE appeared as a single band at 170 kDa, as expected (mACE, lane 7) (5). protein bands corresponding to ACE were absent when membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody alone. the box represents 50% of the values (25th and 75th percentiles), with the upper bar representing the 90th percentile and the lower bar representing the 10th percentile. the box represents the upper bar representing the 90th percentile and the lower bar representing the 10th percentile. age (years) 45 (36\u201350) 54 (42\u201362) Male gender (%) 26 65 eGFR (mls/min/1.73 m2) 79.0 (69.0\u201386.0) 48.5 (40.0\u201361.0) ACR (mg/mmol) 0.94 (0.67\u20131.43) 1.58 (0.61\u201320.63) Diabetes % 0 88 Years post-transplant N/A 3 (1\u20137) Primary cause of renal disease, % urinary ACE2 protein by ELISA was significantly increased in transplant patients compared to controls. western analyses revealed a significant increase in urinary ACE2 protein in transplant patients compared to controls. ACE2 was identified by western analysis as a protein doublet of 120 kDa. multiple linear regression using primary renal diseases as explanatory variables revealed a significant association between diabetes mellitus and urinary ACE2 in the transplant patients. the majority of these patients were taking insulin (31 out of 38, 81.6%), 6 (15.8%) were taking oral hypoglycemic agents, and only 1 patient (2.6%) was on dietary therapy alone. protein levels by ELISA were significantly increased in subjects with diabetes pre-transplant (n = 21), compared to subjects who developed diabetes after transplant (n = 17; p = 0.024). for each box plot, median values are indicated by the line within the box. the box represents 50% of the values (25th and 75th percentiles) urine samples treated with the deglycosylase enzyme PNGase F showed a reduction in the sizes of urinary ACE2 fragments to 85 kDa and 65 kDa. the state of glycosylation of the urinary ACE2 proteins at 120 kDa and 90 kDa was studied. urinary ACE2 mRNA levels in transplant patients (p = 0.004, Table 2). Multiple linear regression adjusting for common variables in transplant recipients. ACE was detected in 94% of urine samples of transplant patients as a protein band of approximately 190. ACE mRNA was detected in 65% of urine samples of transplant patients. no significant difference between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. box represents 50% of the values (25th and 75th percentiles) ACE were absent when membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody alone. increased urinary albumin/Cr was associated with urinary ACE protein. however, diabetes did not associate with increased urinary ACE activity. urinary ACE2 activity and ACE2 protein are increased in kidney transplant recipients. the presence of diabetes strongly associates with urinary ACE2 levels. ACE2 is expressed at relatively high levels in the kidney, particularly in the proximal tubule. no subjects were taking inhibitors of the RAS. age and gender had no influence on urinary ACE2 activity or protein levels. in patients with CKD Mizuiri et al. found no difference in urinary ACE2 levels. the use of immunosuppressive drugs in transplant subjects might regulate shedding of cells expressing ACE2 mRNA into the urine. ACE2 protein could originate at least partly from plasma (via filtration at the glomerulus), or it could be derived via excretion from renal cells. however, CKD patients in their study had significant albuminuria. proteomic analysis has identified ACE2 as one of the 1132 proteins present in urinary exosomes isolated from human urine. diabetes was significantly associated with urinary Ang II levels in transplant subjects, consistent with intrarenal RAS activation in diabetes [28]. limitations include the relatively small number of subjects, the absence of plasma ACE2 or ACE measurements, and the single time point for urinary ACE2, ACE and peptide assays. diabetes alone may contribute to increased urinary ACE2 levels, independent of transplant status."}
