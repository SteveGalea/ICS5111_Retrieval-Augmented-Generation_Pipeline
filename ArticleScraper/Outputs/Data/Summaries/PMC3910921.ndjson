{"summary": "DENV causes dengue with or without warning signs or severe dengue that can result in shock or death. the disease is induced by four different viral serotypes. infection with one serotype confers protective immunity to that serotype. the dsRNA family comprises cytoplasmic RNA helicases that share a homologous DExD/H box. the binding of dsRNA to PRRs activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). dsRNA receptors utilize adaptor molecules to facilitate signaling. Viruses have evolved strategies to evade the type I IFN response. some include influenza virus (by NS1 protein), hepatitis C virus (by VP35 protein), and Nipah virus (by W protein) members of the family Flaviviridae have evolved unique strategies to control the innate immune response. HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR3 (293/TLR3) were propagated as a confluent monolayer in tissue culture flasks. the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) transfection of 293/TLR3 cells was done using 1 g of plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a density of 3.6 105 cells/ml. cells were then cultured in 24-well dishes and after 12 h were stimulated with 10 g/ml poly(IC)/LyoVec. the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) after electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. rabbit anti-HA antibodies were washed three times for 5 min with TBST. blots were incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) cells were cotransfected with flag-IKK (1 g of DNA) and HA-NS2B/3, HA-NS2B/3-S135A. cells were precleared for 3 h with 20 l of agarose beads. coimmunoprecipitation procedures were conducted according to manufacturer's instructions. the images were observed with a Zeiss Observer Z1 confocal laser-scanning microscope coupled to a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta EC. the system was controlled using Zeiss ZEN 2009 software. the properties of the NS2B/3 cleavage site and preference sequences were searched for. the 293/TLR3 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at 4.5 105 cells/well. after 24 h, the cells were mock stimulated or stimulated to activate TLR3. the cells were lysed and stored at 80\u00b0C for subsequent Western blot analysis. plasmids encoding DENV2 protease NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A with impaired protease activity. transfection was done using 1 g of plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a density of 3.6 105 cells/ml. cells were then cultured in 24-well dishes and after 12 h were stimulated with 10 g/ml poly(IC)/Lyo blots were washed three times for 5 min with TBST, incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) antibody. the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (VDF) membrane. superSignal west Pico chemiluminescent detection methods (Pierce) were used to visualize proteins according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were grown overnight to 50% confluence on microscope coverslips and then fixed and permeabilized in cold acetone-methanol (1:1). the cells were permeabilized for 5 min in 0.5% Nonidet P-40. lysates (200 l) were precleared for 3 h with 20 l of agarose beads. the coimmunoprecipitation procedures were conducted according to manufacturer's instructions. a kit-supplied HA-tagged positive control was used to verify correct immunoprecipitation. we used the pattern search tool of Prosite with the motif [KR] (2,3)-[SGA], which represents two or three residues of Lys and/or Arg followed by any of Ser, Gly, or Ala. the protein-protein model of IKK and NS2B/3 was examined using the automatic docking ClusPro 2.0 server (29) the main phosphorylated residues are serine 386 (S386) and serine 396 (S396) (30) in this study, we tested IRF3 phosphorylation at S386, which has been suggested to be critical for IRF3 activation. poly(IC) stimulated IRF3 phosphorylation at residue S386. cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting 24 h postinfection (12 h poststimulation) the signals were evaluated by densitometry. cells that were infected but not stimulated showed no S386-IRF3 phosphorylation. however, the stimulation of noninfected 293/TLR3 cells resulted in S386-IRF3 phosphorylation. the results demonstrate nuclear translocation of IRF3 after TLR3 or RLR stimulation occurs in mock-infected cells compared to unstimulated control cells. however, in the DENV-infected/stimulated cells, RLR-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation was blocked. pS386-IRF3 cells were infected or mock infected with DENV. the cells were stimulated or not for TLR3 or RLR as indicated. the cells were stained with fluorescent, conjugated secondary antibodies. ated cells transfected with empty plasmid showed a 3.1-fold level of induction compared with negative-control cells. however, in lysates of NS2B/3-transfected cells stimulated for RLR, the induction of pS386-IRF3 was significantly reduced compared to positive-control cells that received only stimulation (P 0.05) NS2B/3 and IKK are a kinase involved in phosphorylating IRF3. cells were transfected with plasmids coding for HA-tagged NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A or were cotransfected with Flag-tagged IKK. once expression was confirmed, we tested whether any protein-protein interactions could be detected. 135A were positive for protein-protein interactions in both cases compared with controls. but the interaction of IKK with NS2B/3-S135A resulted in a stronger signal than the interaction with catalytically active protease. HA-tagged proteins were stained with a primary anti-HA antibody and a secondary PLA Minus probe. mmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays with either NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A. we detected a stronger interaction for IKK with NS2B/3-S135A. a portion of the expressed Flag-IKK was detected in NS2B/3-transfected cells. antibodies used were an anti-Flag antibody that can recognize the transfected protein and any N-terminal cleavage product and a monoclonal anti-IKK antibody that recognizes residues surrounding Val345. results show that IKK was equally expressed in cells transfected with NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A. asterisks represent a significant fold change compared to IKK-transfected cells. we overexpressed IKK in 293/TLR3 cells to evaluate if deNV antagonizes specific IKK-induced phosphorylation activity. the software modeled the three-dimensional (3D) structure of IKK using as a template the crystal structure of the kinase TBK1 (PDB ID, 4IM2) available in the Protein Data Bank. TBK1 and IKK are homologous proteins with similarly organized kinase domains and that share >70% amino acid sequence identity (37\u201339). the model was generated using the fully automatic ClusPro 2.0 protein-protein docking server. DENV blocks IRF3 phosphorylation of serine 386. Upon viral infection, TLR3 and RLRs are the major sensors that trigger IRF3 activation in response to stimulation. pS386-IRF3 protein levels normalized to GAPDH are shown in arbitrary units. each bar represents the mean SEM. C, negative control. human embryonic kidney cells with stable expression of TLR3 were infected. the inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation after in vitro DENV infection was confirmed. this suggests that DENV-induced inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation is widely associated with different DENV serotypes and strains. the phosphorylation of S386-IRF3 was not detected in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of DENV-infected/unstimulated cells. however, the virus failed to block TLR3-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. this pathway was chosen for study in all further experiments. ase complex NS2B/3 inhibits RLR-induced induction of pS386-IRF3 phosphorylation in human cells. a densitometric analysis of a pS386-IRF3 immunoblot showed a 3.1-fold level of induction compared with negative-control cells. however, in lysates of NS2B/3-transfected cells stimulated for RLR, the induction of pS386-I pS386-IRF3 protein levels normalized to GAPDH are shown as fold change compared to the positive control (+C) each bar represents the mean SEM. NS2B/3-associated inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation establishes relevance of studying interplay between the protease and kinases that directly activate IRF3. imaging of IKK in transfected cells expressing the active protease NS2B/3 revealed no red fluorescence. however, cells transfected with the catalytically inactive protease showed positive protein-protein interactions with endogenous IKK. the absence of red fluorescence reflects no protein-protein interaction. cells were lysed at 48 h posttransfection and extracts coimmunoprecipitated with antibody against HA. NS2B/3 protease performed a computational analysis to identify putative protease cleavage sites within the IKK sequence. we identified two putative cleavage sites in the ATP-binding region of the kinase domain. we then evaluated if IKK expression was regulated or showed cleavage products after NS2B/3 transfection or DENV infection. protease cleavage evaluation by Western blotting. cells were transfected with flag-IKK- and NS2B/3- or NS2B/3-S135A-encoding plasmids for 48 h. lysate (20 g) was analyzed using anti-Flag or anti-IKK antibody. lysates of cells were compared with lysates from cells that were transfected only. deNV infection caused a significant reduction in the IKK-associated kinase activity that phosphorylates S386-IRF3. human IKK and NS2B/3 (PDB ID, 2FOM) separated and docked. yellow residues represent the IKK protein kinase domain, orange residues represent the ATP-binding region, and gray residues are shown. protease was identified as a relevant viral protein in that process (26, 42) in the present study, we performed a series of in vitro and computational experiments to better understand the strategies that DENV employs to inhibit S386-IRF3 phosphorylation during infection. we also observed a moderate impact on S386 phosphorylation when the TLR3 pathway was stimulated. DENV inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation at S398 (44) results suggest that DENV can inhibit phosphorylation of at least two different serines of the IRF3 phosphoserine cluster necessary for its activation. the impact of HCV infection on the phosphorylation of both serines has also been assessed. recent studies identified deNV protease as an important viral protein related to the subversion of IRF3 phosphorylation at the S396 residue (42). this is in accordance with previous studies that identified the requirement of the catalytically active viral protease complex for reducing type I IFN production. both NS2B/3 and NS2B/3-S135A are able to interact with the kinase. but the interaction seems to be stronger than the interaction with the active protease. the interaction induces the cleavage of STING by a catalysis-dependent mechanism. interaction between IKK and NS2B/3 can be explained by two different events. one possible mechanism involves protease binding to IKK to induce its proteolytic cleavage. the second mechanism may be that the association of the viral protease with the cellular kinase interferes with the IKK activity domains. a similar mechanism of inhibition has been described in another positive-stranded RNA virus. the papain-like protease of coronavirus disrupts the assembly of the STING-MAVS-IKK/TBK1 complex (11) thus, further studies with IKK may reveal the mechanistic details that modulate this innate immune response."}
