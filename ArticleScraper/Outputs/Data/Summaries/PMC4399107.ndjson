{"summary": "the advent of inexpensive, ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing instrumentation has transformed microbial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) into a routine exercise in molecular biology. benchtop sequencers are now capable of producing up to 35 Mb (454 GS Junior), 2 Gb (Ion Torrent) or 15 Gb (Illumina MiSeq) of sequence per run and have a more-than-sufficient capacity for single-organism sequencing. the process of generating data by WGS is therefore no longer a time-limiting step. the first bottleneck is the absence of standard operational protocols for the acquisition of samples in conjunction with their contextual epidemiological information. these protocols should be formulated not only with an eye to the best scientific standards but also for the application of appropriate legal safeguards to respect individual privacy. the third bottleneck involves the improvement in data analysis procedures to convert floods of data into actionable results. in general, NGS has higher error rates than Sanger sequencing, but these higher rates are mitigated by repeated sequencing to establish a sequence consensus. SMRT sequencing was combined with circular library preparation. consensus sequence error rate dropped to within the limits achieved by other NGS technologies. reference guided and de novo are useful for rapidly assembling and annotating newly sequenced genomes. a detailed review of genome assembly can be found elsewhere (31). there are three components necessary for microbial forensic analysis with NGS data. first, a DNA sequence of the sample is needed (1), which could be a completed draft genome assembly, shotgun metagenomic sequences, or amplicon sequences. rapid advances in NGS have resulted in a situation in which rapid WGS of the causative microbe during an outbreak is practical (41) first responders should be aware of the power and limitations of WGS so that they know to obtain appropriate samples and contextual information. the resultant information is central to making correct decisions that are required in response to the outbreak. strains were identified as the laboratory Ames strain. the material was defined further as a B. anthracis Ames ancestor strain. the long and complex \u201cchain of custody\u201d resulted in challenges to the DNA evidence. biosurveillance information Indicators of the release of an infectious agent include the occurrence of disease in humans as well as detection of pathogens through surveillance systems. there is a need to coordinate public health, law enforcement, and national security activities under a common umbrella and to employ the recent advances in WGS as applied to microbial forensics during this concerted action. electronic health records (EHRs) throughout the united states can be used in informational surveillance to identify epidemics in their early stages. this surveillance includes new reporting requirements and coordination both nationally, within state and federal frameworks, and internationally (52\u201354) the disclosure of private health information without authorization for public health surveillance, investigations, and interventions, has legal and logistical consequences. the full scope of that action will depend on the national security protocol that is invoked. covered entities can release patient records to authorized federal officials. there are significant gaps in our understanding of how patient records may be used in a public health emergency. states that have passed legislation incorporating the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (a majority) have sweeping powers to deal with such a situation. the full extent of coordination among public health officials, law enforcement agencies, and national security officials will be context dependent and has not been fully resolved. a number of authors have described epidemiological indications that an outbreak may be caused by bioterrorism (67\u201371) a number of authors have described epidemiological indications that an outbreak may be caused by bioterrorism (67\u201371) Dembek et al. applied the test described by Grunow and Finke retrospectively to a number of case scenarios. it accurately identified the situations most likely to have resulted from bioterrorism but failed to identify deliberate attacks that involved common pathogens. the difficulty with this tool is that considerable investigation may be required before a valid assessment can be made. identification of the etiologic pathogen was the most important component of the scoring system. it concluded that WGS should be applied as soon as any suspicious indicator is identified. challenges that need to be addressed are the legal issues. key morphological variants were identified in samples gathered from the incident premises (10) culture-based approaches share two major limitations: the organism must be both (i) \u201cculturable\u201d and (ii) able to be isolated from the initial biological mixture in which it is collected, i.e., in a monoculture. amplification of \u201csignature\u201d DNA in samples by PCR can bypass the requirement for an organism to be isolated and grown in culture. MLVA has been used to genotype bacterial pathogens (87\u201389) these DNA repeat regions are prone to strand slippage occurring during DNA replication. in-depth sequencing of selected isolates can be used to identify appropriate MLST targets. we have analyzed several paradigmatic cases in which genomic microbiology has been used to identify the relevant technical, scientific, and legal challenges. the current strategy for biosurveillance is an \u201call-hazards\u201d approach. electronic health records (EHRs) throughout the united states can be used in informational surveillance to identify epidemics in their early stages. this surveillance includes new reporting requirements and coordination both nationally, within state and federal frameworks, and internationally. most developed states and countries have privacy statutes that dictate how patient records may be used. the full scope of that action will depend on the national security protocol that is invoked. covered entities can release patient records to authorized federal officials. there are significant gaps in our understanding of how patient records may be used in a public health emergency. state as well as federal laws may apply to patient record access. many records would not include WGS data even if this level of testing was taking place. the full extent of coordination between public health officials, law enforcement agencies, and national security officials will be context dependent. information indicative of the early phase of an \u201coutbreak\u201d will be available initially to public health officials who are trained to gather epidemiological evidence in order to contain disease and treat affected individuals. access to the current technologies used for microbial forensics, such as WGS, would be beneficial in an investigation of a routine outbreak as well as one that involves criminal activity. covered entities can release patient records to authorized federal officials for conduct of lawful intelligence, counterintelligence, and other national security proceedings. a full debate on the limits of emergency powers and how they may affect patient privacy has not occurred. there are significant gaps in our understanding of how patient records may be used in a public health emergency. the full extent of coordination between public health officials, law enforcement agencies, and national security officials will be context dependent. it is not clear what might happen if a public health emergency spans several states with different emergency criteria and regulations. it is unlikely that these problems will be addressed legislatively. a number of authors have described epidemiological indications that an outbreak may be caused by bioterrorism (67\u201371) a number of authors have described epidemiological indications that an outbreak may be caused by bioterrorism (67\u201371) Dembek et al. applied the test described by Grunow and Finke retrospectively to a number of case scenarios. it accurately identified the situations most likely to have resulted from bioterrorism but failed to identify deliberate attacks that involved common pathogens. the difficulty with this tool is that considerable investigation may be required before a valid assessment can be made, and by then crucial leads may be lost. identification of the etiologic pathogen was the most important component of the scoring system and concluded that WGS should be applied as soon as any suspicious indicator is identified. challenges that need to be addressed for WGS to be of use during an outbreak are the legal issues (discussed above) and the practicality of comprehensive sample collection and storage. culture-based approaches share two major limitations: the organism must be both (i) \u201cculturable\u201d and (ii) able to be isolated from the initial biological mixture in which it is collected, i.e., in a monoculture. 99% of bacteria cannot be cultured in the laboratory under any known conditions (77\u201379) multilocus sequence typing (MLST) targets DNA sequences under evolutionary pressure, to type microbial pathogens at the sequence level (92\u201395) seven genes were sequenced in multiple isolates, in order to type salmonella isolates causing infections in children and their companion animals. OUTBREAK OF ENTEROHEMORRHAGIC ESCHERICHIA COLI O104:H4 IN GERMANY (2011) E. coli strains are ordinarily commensal, enteric organisms, but several, such as enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) strains and Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains possess virulence factors that enable them to be pathogenic. rawde et al. used a rapid benchtop sequencing technology, open-source data release, and crowd-sourced analyses to reveal in 1 week that the strain responsible for this outbreak belonged to an EAEC lineage. the strain responsible for this outbreak belonged to an EAEC lineage and had acquired genes for Shiga toxin and antibiotic resistance. the source was a Shiga toxin-producing O104:H4 strain that recently acquired the toxin-encoding phage via natural lateral gene transfer. a deliberate introduction of a Shiga toxin-encoding prophage would likely have shown other features, such as the presence of cloning vectors. in future infectious disease outbreaks, WGS will be able to supply this type of information in real time. the outbreak demonstrates the vulnerability of our food chain and the potential health and economic consequences that can result from even limited product contamination. it also illustrates why unusual outbreaks involving endemic microbes must be taken as seriously as those involving potential agents of bioterrorism. sequencing of 11 EHEC O104:H4 isolates from the small number of French cases and identification of 19 divergent SNPs allowed a more nuanced perspective on this entire episode. the outbreak was first recognized in relation to salad products eaten in northern Germany. the outbreak quickly involved most of Europe. in the outbreak, sprout seeds imported from Egypt were implicated as the likely source. it was not until a week later that sprout seeds imported from Egypt were implicated as the likely source. some actions may have violated european law and/or constituted WTO violations (112) a test may not meet criminal prosecution standards but could provide adequate evidence for a public health decision during a rapidly progressing outbreak. an accelerated process is needed for the evaluation and approval of potentially useful tools in an outbreak. a metagenome is the complete collection of genetic material recovered directly from an environmental sample. a retrospective study found samples collected during the 2011 Shiga-toxigenic E. coli outbreak in Germany were sequenced in depth and analyzed by using a metagenomic approach. a sensitivity of 67% is low for a clinical diagnosis and may yet be too low for forensic attribution purposes. a single sample and the coincident occurrence of disease are not definitive evidence of causality. it is essential that multiple \u201csuspect\u201d and \u201cbackground\u201d samples be acquired to determine if there is a statistically significant link (126). a single sample and the coincident occurrence of disease are not definitive evidence of causality. a deliberate introduction of a Shiga toxin-encoding prophage would likely have shown other features, such as the presence of cloning vectors. in future infectious disease outbreaks, WGS will be able to supply this type of information in real time and hopefully will lead to a more rapid optimization of the mitigation strategies being employed. the outbreak demonstrates the vulnerability of our food chain. it also illustrates why unusual outbreaks involving endemic microbes must be taken as seriously as those involving potential agents of bioterrorism. only 238 sequence differences were observed between the outbreak strains C227-11 and TY2482 (107). the number of strains available for sequencing is critical for the epidemiological study of transmission pathways. the outbreak was first recognized in relation to salad products eaten in northern Germany. within 2 weeks, 12 european nations had reported outbreaks that might constitute a public health emergency of international concern. many countries acted proactively to remove cucumbers and tomatoes from stores and production, Russia issued a trade ban on Spanish cucumbers, and the Spanish cucumber and vegetable market suffered significant losses (estimated to be \u20ac200 million a week) some of these actions may have violated european law and/or constituted WTO violations (112) a test may not meet criminal prosecution standards but could provide adequate evidence for a public health decision during a rapidly progressing outbreak. an accelerated process is needed for the evaluation and approval of potentially useful tools in an outbreak. to accomplish this, it would require decisions to be reached about what minimum preliminary evidence is needed to deploy techniques that offer significant potential benefits in outbreak detection and control. a retrospective study found samples collected during the 2011 Shiga-toxigenic E. coli outbreak were sequenced in depth and analyzed by using a metagenomic approach. a sensitivity of 67% is low for a clinical diagnosis and may yet be too low for forensic attribution purposes. emergence of community-acquired and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has posed new public health risks. the strains combine antibiotic resistance, exceptional virulence, and person-to-person transmissibility. it is therefore no longer relevant to distinguish between hospital and community-acquired strains. sal Organism The MRSA strain (designated sequence type 2371 [ST2371]) was isolated in Cambridge, united Kingdom. it was clearly derived from ST22 (the MRSA sequence type that is the cause of 80% of United Kingdom hospital-associated MRSA infections) but also acquired the gene for the exotoxin Panton-Valentine leucocidin. the rate of evolutionary change would provide a sufficient phylogenetic signal to trace the transmission pathway of the bacterium during an epidemiological study (137, 138). at the Cambridge University Hospitals, samples were collected from neonates at the time of admission and twice weekly thereafter. the establishment of a \u201ccausal\u201d link required classic epidemiological surveys to identify possible asymptomatic carriers. the isolation of S. aureus DNA involved routine, selective, automated culture of S. aureus from a large number of clinical specimens prior to the outbreak. asymptomatic members of the community who carry the MRSA strain in question may increase sample noise. a particularly virulent or resistant strain may represent a public health emergency (52) that would justify further intrusion and mandatory treatment. a less virulent strain may not justify such controls. asymptomatic health care workers who carry the organism should be permitted to work with patients or even be in the hospital. the gene for the exotoxin Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is the cause of 80% of hospital-associated MRSA infections. the prophage carrying the genes encoding PVL had independently integrated into S. aureus genomes on several different occasions. the acquisition of these genes by the ST22 strain occurred by this mechanism (132) us isolates suggested evolutionary change would provide a sufficient phylogenetic signal to trace the transmission pathway of the bacterium during an epidemiological study (137, 138). at the Cambridge University Hospitals, samples were collected from neonates at the time of admission and twice weekly thereafter. the isolation of S. aureus DNA involved routine, selective, automated culture of S. aureus from a large number of clinical specimens prior to the outbreak. the multiplexing of WGS in these studies allowed large numbers of samples to be analyzed economically. a public health emergency (52) would justify further intrusion and mandatory treatment. a more virulent strain may not justify such controls. asymptomatic health care workers who carry the organism should be allowed to continue patient care as long as they adopt additional preventive strategies. characterization of a new infection is done only in the setting of a cluster of new cases or for epidemiologic research into the factors involved in tuberculosis spread. the main tool employed to contain tuberculosis outbreaks is an epidemiologic questionnaire that focuses on the characterization of the chain of transmission and subsequent chemotherapy for identified patients. tuberculosis in south africa only exacerbates concern for those unknowingly exposed to this bacterium. over a 3-year period, a relatively large number of tuberculosis cases occurred in a medium-sized community in Canada. from these data, authors estimated that Mycobacterium accumulates 0.5 single nucleotide polymorphisms per genome per year. the increased genetic resolution allowed the determination of the direction of transmission in outbreaks, reconstruction of the infection timeline, and identification of superspreaders (the treatment of whom would be essential to prevent future transmission) the increased genetic resolution allowed the determination of the direction of transmission in outbreaks, reconstruction of the infection timeline, and identification of superspreaders. 166 small tuberculosis clusters at high risk of metastasizing into larger outbreaks in low-incidence areas (166). MLST DNA sequencing projects suggest that the geographical variation in human M. tuberculosis is higher than was expected for this slow-growing and evolving bacterium (169). speaker disregarded requests to contact italian health officials at his destination. he was served with an isolation order only upon his return to the united states. the recent emergence of totally drug-resistant tuberculosis in south africa only exacerbates concern for those unknowingly exposed to this bacterium. study examined the utility of WGS for the identification of factors resulting in increased tuberculosis transmission. increased genetic resolution allowed the determination of the direction of transmission in outbreaks, reconstruction of the infection timeline, and identification of superspreaders. public health officials will need to make decisions about possible vaccination programs and isolation of affected individuals. 166 small tuberculosis clusters at high risk of metastasizing into larger outbreaks in low-incidence areas (166). MLST DNA sequencing projects suggest that the geographical variation in human M. tuberculosis is higher than was expected for this slow-growing and evolving bacterium (169). this mutation rate has been attributed to the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase used during virus replication (170, 171) this high rate of change results in a paraphyletic constellation of viruses in infected individuals similar to that occurring in human individuals infected with the RNA virus HIV. the recent outbreaks of infections with human RNA viruses document the importance of computer modeling for this type of WGS data in epidemics. the variation occurring within the host animal could otherwise have greatly decreased the ability of WGS to be as informative in RNA virus outbreaks (177). growth of FMDV in culture had left a unique molecular signature within the genome of the epidemic strain. early outbreak isolates contained both culture-specific mutations viral protein 3 amino acid 56 (VP356; histidine to arginine) and VP360 (aspartic acid to glycine), which favor heparin sulfate receptor binding. this supported the assumption that the 2007 United Kingdom epidemic was caused by an accidental release of a cultured virus. authors conclude that the immediate source of the 2011 outbreak had not been sampled and could not be determined. the identity of the FMDV reservoir is therefore in doubt, and extensive sampling of cloven-hoofed animals would have been needed. cottam et al. analyzed the FMDV nucleotide sequences from 21 infection sites over the 7 months of the 2001 United Kingdom outbreak. they determined the \u201cconsensus sequence\u201d of the virus population occurring in both infected animals and premises. this high mutation rate resulted in an average of 1.5 nucleotide changes occurring at each site every day. an FMDV-infected wild boar was discovered near the border between Turkey and Bulgaria. a strain circulating in south africa was the most probable source of the outbreak. the 2011 Bulgaria outbreak viruses were all closely related to viruses collected in Turkey during 2010. the identity of the FMDV reservoir is therefore in doubt. extensive sampling of cloven-hoofed animals at the border between Turkey and Bulgaria would have been needed to determine the source of the 2011 outbreak. a major challenge to the use of metagenomic samples in pathogen identification and characterization is the fact that parasites are typically present at only low copy numbers in the clinical and environmental samples available for analysis. new strategies for high-throughput enrichment combined with metagenomic sequencing enhance the detection of infecting bacteria. in situ hybridization-flow cytometry-cell sorting is a technique with the potential to preferentially isolate any target bacterium from a soil sample for NGS (192). Selective whole-genome amplification methods like those already practical for the small genomes of viruses such as FMDV are also undergoing rapid development for larger genomes and will soon also offer the option of culture-free sequencing of targeted genomes. software to assign reads (or assemblies) to a known organism is ultimately dependent on the availability of a high-quality reference genome database. in environmental metagenomic studies, reads or contigs are searched against databases in order to classify reads taxonomically for species identification and abundance estimation. the utility of interpretation software is dependent on a continuously updated database that would include pathogen genomes to detect the presence of a species. this would also contain a catalog of point mutations or genes that account for drug resistance, virulence, or marks of genetic engineering (206). the development of a bioweapon does not require genetic engineering. many countries have the technological potential to produce large amounts of pathogenic microorganisms safely. common pathogens can be genetically manipulated to cause higher morbidity or mortality rates, survive longer in the environment, be delivered with greater ease, and be resistant to common antibiotics. comparison of an outbreak strain with its nearest evolutionary neighbor can identify where a breakdown in the synteny occurs. Boundaries of the novel DNA can then be closely examined for evidence of unnatural genetic changes (suggesting that the bacterium has been genetically manipulated in order to create a bioweapon) rapid sequencing of 99 Ebola virus isolates involved in the 2014 outbreak showed that they arose from a single-crossover event from the natural host. this then allowed the focus to remain on containing human-to-human EBOV transmission in the current outbreak rather than on the identification of possible zoonotic sources of new transmissions. the improved resolution offered by WGS may provide greater clarity in many contexts. this \u201cimprovement\u201d may come into conflict with existing legal rules and protocols. however, this \u201cimprovement\u201d may come into conflict with existing legal rules and protocols. currently using laboratory assays that have never been validated for forensic applications. these tests may provide answers but not ones that would be admissible in a court of law. there will also be new privacy concerns and questions about individual liberties. new strategies for high-throughput enrichment combined with metagenomic sequencing could lead, even in large studies, to rapid culture-free NGS. alternative approaches might be useful for other complex sample sources. analysis of the outbreak was constrained by the lack of a comprehensive database containing sequences of contemporarily circulating strains from different locations. however, even in this example, comparison of sequences obtained from the Haitian epidemic with data on those circulating in Latin America, Africa, Bangladesh, and Nepal suggested an Asian origin. ed against databases containing sequences of known origin in order to make a proper identification (32, 202) reads or contigs are searched against databases in order to classify reads taxonomically for species identification and abundance estimation. individual algorithms employ different techniques to reduce computational burden of this process. new association studies are finding genetic determinants that affect virulence. it is important to recognize that the relevant reference population will not always be available in the standard databases (108) the probability of an apparent match depends greatly on the size of the reference database. new strategies for high-throughput enrichment combined with metagenomic sequencing could lead to rapid culture-free NGS. approaches that limit the amount of eukaryotic (host) CpG-methylated DNA combined with sequencing enhance the detection of infecting bacteria (188\u2013190) the dearth of contemporary (circulating) Vibrio cholerae strains that have been or are available for WGS is that of up-to-date, large-scale informatics databases. analysis of this outbreak was constrained by the lack of a comprehensive database containing sequences of contemporarily circulating strains from different locations. however, even in this example, comparison of the sequences obtained from the Haitian epidemic with data on those circulating in Latin America, Africa, Bangladesh, and Nepal suggested reads are searched against databases in order to classify reads taxonomically for species identification and abundance estimation (when a sample has a plurality of genomes) individual algorithms employ different techniques for reducing computational burden of this process. the number of random hits one can \u201cexpect\u201d by chance. the probability of an apparent match depends greatly on the size of the reference database. the development of a bioweapon does not require genetic engineering. WGS has been used very effectively to characterize interspecies or interstrain exchange of virulence factors (e.g., acquisition of the cytolytic toxin Panton-Valentine leucocidin by S. aureus sequence type 22 and Stx by Escherichia coli serotype O104:H4) in these outbreaks, a key consideration was the speed with which WGS can be used to identify virulence factors. a deliberate or accidental release of an organism may also be suspected if the genetic signature left by mass production can be detected within the whole genome sequence. recognition requires that analysts understand the potential consequences of production technology on the pathogen and can recognize the resulting molecular signature. the library of FMDV sequences allowed WGS to be used to identify the probable country of origin of the infection. however, an inadequate number of isolates was sequenced to test the epidemiological hypothesis that implicated fenugreek seed from Egypt as the outbreak source. the human microbiome project has just begun the formidable task of identifying the microbiota of humans. the legal system tolerated decisions made on conjectures and gaps in evidence. many laboratories are currently using laboratory assays that have never been validated for forensic applications. a microorganism's genome sequence contains all this information. rapid, inexpensive NGS has the potential to replace many of the above-mentioned labor-intensive procedures currently used in microbial forensics attributions."}
