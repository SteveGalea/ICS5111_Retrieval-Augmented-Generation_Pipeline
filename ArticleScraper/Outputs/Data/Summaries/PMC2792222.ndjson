{"summary": "the spike (S) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus. it is a potent target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. but the mechanism CoV pathogenesis in SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. a new recombinant virus derived from human might re-emerge as a new SARS-CoV type. a new recombinant virus derived from human might re-emerge as a new SARS-CoV type. both humoral and cellular immune responses appear to be crucial for the clearance of SARS-CoV infection. pathology in early stages of the disease proposes eliciting a SARS-CoV CTL response to clear the infection. a detailed understanding of the S protein-mediated CTL response is essential. development of effective treatments and vaccines against SARS-CoV depends upon the mechanisms of various immune effectors in protective immunity and identification of the protective antigens recognized by each. a novel SARS/S-specific, HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope was conserved. each candidate peptide was evaluated for its binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules using the T2 cell-peptide binding test. each candidate peptide was evaluated for its binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules using the T2 cell-peptide binding test. eight candidate peptides were predicted and synthesized, termed Sp1-8. peptides were further verified as having an absence of shared sequence homology with the human or murine proteins using the BLAST search engine. the candidate epitope peptides were shown in bold text. the threshold of HLA-A*0201-binding motif is 4% and the threshold of proteasomal and immunoproteasomal cleavage site is 8%. T2 cells lack the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). exogenous epitope peptides bind to the HLA-I molecules on the cell surface. higher-affinity peptides will induce more HLA-A*0201 expression on the cell surface than lower-affinity peptides. Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 induced more CD8+ T-cells that specifically produced IFN- in response to DCs pulsed with relevant peptides or positive control peptide in comparison to other groups. cytolysis observed were specific because the CTLs could not lyse T2 cells loaded with irrelevant peptides. peptide-specific CTLs were generated from the PBLs of HLA-A2.1+ healthy donors. resulting CTLs were tested for peptide-specific lysis using a standard 4-hour 51Cr release assay. results presented are from three independent experiments. peptide HBcAg(131-140) exhibited the most lytic capacity at each E/T ratio. of the three candidate peptides tested, Sp8 exhibited the most lytic capacity at each E/T ratio, comparable to the positive control peptide. Sp8 released the most IFN- following peptide stimulation. selection of potential HLA-A*0201 binding peptides derived from SARS-CoV/S protein. GD01 (AY278489), HKU-39849 (AY278491), HSR 1 (AY323977), Sin2500 (AY283794), Sin2679 (AY283796), Sin2748 (AY283797), Sin2774 (AY283798), TOR2 (AY274119), TWC (AY291451) and Urbani (AY278741). HLA-A*0201-restricted peptide S411-420 was used as a positive control for HLA-A*0201-binding ability. the positive control peptide, S411-420, bound HLA-A*0201 strongly (FI = 1.5), while the negative control HBcAg(131-140) peptide was used as a negative control. e-specific CD8+ CTLs from healthy human donors were stimulated in vitro by DCs loaded with the eight candidate peptides, positive control peptides S411-420, or negative control peptides HBcAg(131-140). T2 cells loaded with each of peptides were used as target cells in cytotoxicity assays. logous DCs were pulsed with 20 g/ml of the indicated peptides. Resulting CTLs were tested for IFN- release using an ELISPOT assay. results presented are from three independent experiments. the effector CTL cells were carried out following the re-stimulation. the cells were able to lyse three candidate peptides-pulsed J(A2/kb) cells. of the three candidates tested, Sp8 exhibited the most lytic capacity at each E/T ratio. on of peptide-specific IFN- was analyzed using ELISPOT assays. results presented were from three independent experiments. bulk CTLs released IFN- only in response to DCs pulsed with Sp6, Sp7, Sp8 and the positive control peptide. the eight predicted peptides were then verified via MHC peptide binding assay. plasmid encoding the full-length SARS-CoV S gene elicited strong CTL response in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice. this suggests the predicted candidate peptides were native epitopes, capable of priming CTL responses in vivo. previous studies used single methods, such as HLA-A2-binding peptide prediction or overlapping peptide strategy. predicted candidate peptides require additional validation methods to ensure accuracy. this may reflect the different stimulators used in these studies. a combination of two computer algorithms was used to identify potential HLA-A*0201-binding peptides within the S protein of the SARS-CoV strain. the predictive algorithm, \"ProPred1\"[31], allows the prediction of MHC binding sites in an antigenic sequence for 47 MHC class-I alleles. proPred1 also allows the prediction of the standard proteasomal and immunoproteasomales cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence. the simultaneous prediction of MHC binding and proteasomal cleavage sites leads to the identification of potential T-cell epitopes. peptides with a score exceeding 24 were selected in \"SYFPEITHI\" human TAP-deficient T2 cell line and BB7.2 cell line producing mAb against HLA-A2 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. BB7.2 cell line was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 4 g/L glucose, penicillin (5 104U/L) and streptomycin. RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, BRL) plus 10% calf serum and supplemented with 4 g/L glucose, penicillin (5 104 U/L) and streptomycin (50 mg/L) all cell lines mentioned above were kept at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. FI was calculated as follows: FI = [(mean FITC fluorescence with the given peptide - mean FITC fluorescence without peptide)/(mean FITC fluorescence without peptide)] human peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs were generated as described previously [28] with minor modifications. recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF-, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to the medium. DCs were pulsed with 20 g/ml peptide in the presence of 3 g/ml 2-microglobulin. after 24 to 48 hours 20 IU/ml human interleukin-2 (IL-2, Sigma) was added to the culture medium. g/ml 2-microglobulin was harvested and cultured in 6-well plates. induced cells were harvested and tested by cytokine determination and cytotoxicity assays. induced cells were harvested and tested by cytokine determination. peptide-pulsed T2 cells and/or J(A2/kb) cells were labeled with 51Cr sodium chromate (Na51CrO4, Perkin-Elmer Life Science, Boston, MA) for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours, cells were removed and plates processed as described in the instruction. only brown and/or blue colored spots with fuzzy borders were scored as spot-forming cells (SFCs) as a positive control, HBcAg(131-140)-loaded DCs, DCs alone, and medium were used as negative controls. the predictive algorithm, \"ProPred1\"[31], allows the prediction of MHC binding sites in an antigenic sequence for 47 MHC class-I alleles. the simultaneous prediction of MHC binding and proteasomal cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence leads to the identification of potential T-cell epitopes. ed peptide HBcAg(131-140) (AYRPPNAPIL) was used as a negative control. cells and cell culture HLA-A2+ individuals were selected by flow cytometry screening using the anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody BB7.2. chimeric molecule containing 1 and 2 domains from human HLA-A*0201 and 3 from mouse H-2Kb. cell line was maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, BRL) for experimental purposes, six to eight week-old mice were used. T2 cells were staining with FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-A2 mAb BB7.2. the peptide S411-420 and HBcAg(131-140) served as positive and negative control. the latter has been identified as mouse H2Kd epitope that has little binding affinity with HLA-A2 molecule. one-half of the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing double concentration of GM-CSF and IL-4. cells were harvested for analysis of surface phenotype at different stages of development. after five days of culture, DCs were harvested for subsequent experiments (90% pure as confirmed by analysis of relatively DC-specific phenotype. bone marrow-derived DCs were generated from transgenic mice as previously described [34,35] with some modification. induced cells were harvested and tested by cytokine determination and cytotoxicity assays. peptide-pulsed T2 cells and/or J(A2/kb) cells were labeled with 51Cr sodium chromate (Na51CrO4, Perkin-Elmer Life Science, Boston, MA) for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. a total of 100 l supernatant was collected from each well and radioactivity was counted with a gamma counter. effectsor cells (1 105) and stimulator cells (1 105) were seeded into 96-well polyvinylidene fluoride-backed microplates pre-coated with anti-IFN- mAb. only brown and/or blue colored spots with fuzzy borders were scored as spot-forming cells (SFCs) -A2/Kb cell lines respectively."}
