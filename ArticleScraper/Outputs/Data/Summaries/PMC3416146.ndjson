{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Vertebrate positive-strand RNA viruses are known to remodel the endomembrane system of the host cell. these membrane alterations are associated with the viral RNA replication complex. electron tomography has been used to generate three-dimensional images of virus-induced alterations. es, vesicles, and/or multivesicular bodies may be bound by a double-layer membrane and are often connected by a narrow channel to the surrounding cytosol. in animal cells, the ER is tightly associated with microtubules, and Golgi stacks in plant cells are singly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. ectopic expression of a single viral protein does not take into consideration the contribution of other viral proteins that are likely to affect the viral process under study. an infectious clone of turnip mosaic virus (genus Potyvirus) has been engineered to coproduce 6K2 as a fluorescent protein (15) pCambiaTunos/6KGFP and pCambiaTunos/6KmCherry were described previously. pBIN/20-ER-gk (41) was digested with AseI and pBIN. pCambiaTunos was digested with BamHI and PstI and ligated with similarly restricted pCambia/6K2 to obtain pCambia/6K2-PAGFP. the amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and PstI. the Agrobacterium tumefaciens suspension was diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.03 for secreted GFP (secGFP) and GFP-HDEL (61), to 0.1 for p241d-YFP (12), ERD2-GFP (47), GFP fused to the transmembrane domain of the rat sialyl transferase (ST-GFP) (9), and YFP-S photobleaching and photoactivation of GFP was done with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta system. ten to fifteen pulses of the 405-nm laser were sufficient to activate PAGFP. a 25-mW blue diode 405-nm laser was used at high output (50 to 100% transmission) samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide overnight at 4\u00b0C. the samples were washed four times in water, dehydrated in ethanol solutions (30%, 40%, and 50%), and block stained overnight in 1% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol at 4\u00b0C. sec24 was cloned into the pDONR222 vector by BP recombination. the cloned gene was then subcloned into the gateway compatible destination vector pEarlyGate104 (ABRC stock DB3-686) p241d-YFP (12), ERD2-GFP (47), GFP fused to the transmembrane domain of the rat sialyl transferase (ST-GFP) and YFP-Sec24, to 0.05 for the viral infectious clones. plants were kept for 3 or 4 days postagroinfiltration (dpa) in a growth chamber until observation. photobleaching and photoactivation of GFP was done with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta system. ten to fifteen pulses of the 405-nm laser were sufficient to activate PAGFP so that it produced very bright fluorescence emission. images were processed using Metamorph to quantify the average intensity of fluorescence (6.2r6). samples were washed four times in water, dehydrated in ethanol solutions (30%, 40%, and 50%), stained overnight in 1% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol at 4\u00b0C. semithin sections (1 m thick) were stained with an ultramicrotome Ultracut E of Reichert Jung. the largest section of this structure was estimated to be 16 m 4 m long (n = 30) by comparison, we calculated the nucleus diameter to be 12 m 3 m (n = 30). the globular structure was linked to the cortical ER by transvacuolar strands (Fig. 1B, white arrowhead), and 6K2-mCherry-tagged vesicles essentially devoid of the GFP-HDEL marker were seen traveling along these strands panel H shows coexpressed 6K2-mCherry, chloroplast autofluorescence, and their merged fluorescent signals, respectively. bars = 10 m. a white asterisk shows the position of the nucleus, and the white arrowhead points to the transvacuolar ER strand linking the globular structure with cortical ER. in healthy cells, ST-GFP and ERD2-GFP were found as Golgi bodies (9, 47) YFP-Sec24 in healthy epidermal leaves were characteristically distributed as punctate structures. YFP-Sec24 was also detected in the globular structure induced by the virus. globular structure contained several chloroplasts, with 6K2-GFP labeling their contours. TuMV infection inhibits protein secretion at the ER-Golgi interface. the ER, COPII coatamers, and golgi apparatus were heavily reorganized near the nucleus during TuMV infection. orescence emission by confocal microscopy at a 10 objective magnification. for a positive control for intracellular retention, we expressed GFP-HDEL. the fluorescence of secGFP was weak or undetectable due to the apoplast acidic pH (61, 62) infected cells producing 6K2-mCherry (E) are shown in panels D and E. the globular structure is not an isolated subcellular compartment. the perinuclear globular structure is generally a static entity. fluorescence returned to near prebleach level within less than 2 min. we bleached half of the globular structure and observed the same results. a cell harboring two different globular structures was chosen. the localized background level of green fluorescence observed prior to activation is attributed to the high concentration of CX-PAGFP in the globular structure. after less than 1 min, the fluorescence from CX-PAGFP became weak at the site of activation and in the globular structure. after less than 1 min, the fluorescence from CX-PAGFP became weak at the site of activation. inuclear globular structure was not restocked in viral components following photobleaching. the globular structure was dynamically connected to the bulk of the ER and Golgi apparatus. the globular structure is functionally linked to motile peripheral 6K2 vesicles. globular structure and peripheral 6K2 vesicles are functionally linked to motile 6K2 vesicles. time series images of 6K2-PAGFP expressed in cells produced 6K2-mCherry. arrowhead shows movement of one vesicle originating from globular structure. the morphology of YFP-Sec24 was similar to that observed in untreated cells. however, when YFP-Sec24 was expressed in infected cells, the COPII marker punctate structures were larger and were found to be more frequently clustered with the peripheral vesicles. the globular structure is produced in the presence of BFA. primary infection foci are characterized by concomitant green and red fluorescence. secondary infection foci show red fluorescence only. both gene cassettes are flanked by the left and right borders of the T-DNA. primary infection foci were characterized by concomitant green and red fluorescence. secondary infection foci exhibited red fluorescence only. cell-to-cell movement was observed 4 days after agroinfiltration. ER, Golgi bodies, COPII coatamers, and chloroplasts are amalgamated in a perinuclear globular structure during TuMV infection. disruption of ER-to-Golgi transport caused retention of 6K2 vesicles with COPII coatamers and blocked virus cell-to-cell movement. in noninfected cells, the cortical ER did not show any apparent modification. was estimated to be 16 m 4 m long (n = 30) by comparison, we calculated the nuclear diameter to be 12 m 3 m (n = 30). the globular structure was linked to the cortical ER by transvacuolar strands (Fig. 1B, white arrowhead) and 6K2-mCherry-tagged vesicles essentially devoid of the GFP-HDEL marker were seen traveling along these strands and the polygonal ER tub the morphology of the Golgi apparatus was analyzed using the cis-Golgi marker ERD2-GFP (47) and GFP fused to the transmembrane domain of the rat sialyl transferase (ST-GFP) (9), which is targeted to the trans-Golgi. in healthy cells, ST-GFP and ERD2-GFP were mainly found as Golgi bodies (9, 47) globular structure contained several chloroplasts, with 6K2-GFP labeling their contours. no detectable effect on morphology of cellular organelles and on endomembrane network was observed following agroinfiltration with an empty vector. TuMV infection inhibits protein secretion at the ER-Golgi interface. the protein accumulates intracellularly where it can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy. compared to secGFP alone, we observed higher average intensity fluorescence when secGFP was expressed in infected cells. high-magnification observations of secGFP in infected cells indicated that it was retained in the ER, with additional accumulation in the perinuclear globular structure. the perinuclear globular structure is not an isolated subcellular compartment. the perinuclear globular structure is generally a static entity. however, the ER and Golgi apparatus are highly dynamic organelles. photoactivable GFP (PAGFP) fused to the A. thaliana ER-resident protein calnexin (CX-PAGFP) (46) was used to monitor the dynamics of the ER membrane. expression of CX-PAGFP in cells that produced 6K2-mCherry was observed by confocal microscopy 4 days after agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana plants. the fluorescence from CX-PAGFP became weak at the site of activation and in the globular structure, suggesting rapid depletion of the pulsed activated protein. during a 15-min observation period, the fluorescence due to CX-PAGFP remained high in the globular structure, indicating that this compartment is a reservoir. the globular structure is functionally linked to motile 6K2 vesicles. 6K2 was also fused to PAGFP (6K2-PAGFP) and expressed in TuMV-infected N. benthamiana cells that produced 6K2-mCherry. Activation of 6K2-PAGFP occurred within the globular structure. time lapse images were taken using the plugin MTrackJ of ImageJ. the white circle in the Activation panel in panel A represents the activation spot. cells, the COPII marker punctate structures were larger and were found to be more frequently clustered with the peripheral vesicles than in the absence of the drug. the Pearson's correlation coefficient Rr values were 0.38 0.02 and 0.14 0.02 in the presence or absence of BFA, respectively. primary infection foci are characterized by concomitant green and red fluorescence. secondary infection foci show red fluorescence only. surface area of only the foci with red fluorescence was calculated. primary infection foci were characterized by concomitant green and red fluorescence. no delay in virus infection and virus production was observed. cell-to-cell movement was observed 4 days after agroinfiltration. disruption of ER-to-Golgi transport caused the retention of 6K2 vesicles with COPII coatamers. disruption of ER-to-Golgi transport caused the production of membrane-associated vesicular structures (5, 15, 17, 25, 53, 56) the perinuclear structure was not found in the perinuclear compartments for GFLV and CPMV, which is different from what is observed for GFLV and PVX. this noticeable discrepancy suggests the existence of different mechanisms for host endomembrane recruitment during infection. a defect in one of the Sec24 isomers causes a partial loss of function for the binding of cargo protein destined for secretion. the mutation led to impaired traffic of proteins at the ER-Golgi interface, accompanied with the formation of aberrant endomembrane clusters near the nucleus. the ER-Golgi interface does not play a direct role in the globular structure morphogenesis or functionality. this situation is analogous to what has been observed during coronavirus infection. production of peripheral 6K2 vesicles was not affected, although they showed increased overlap with the COPII marker Sec24. viral egress is initiated by the budding of 6K2 vesicles at ERES in the globular structure, which then traffic along the ER/microfilaments toward the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata for ultimate delivery of the virus into neighboring cells. at that point, some peripheral vesicles may be recycled back to the globular structure."}
