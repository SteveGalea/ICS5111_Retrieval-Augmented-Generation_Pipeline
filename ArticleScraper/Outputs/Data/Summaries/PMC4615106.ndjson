{"summary": "cellular functions are generally not impacted by sense errors, but nonsense, missense, and errors which change the reading frame tend to be deleterious. cis-acting mRNA elements have been found which cause elongating ribosomes to recode the mRNA sequence. reading frame is determined by recognition of a start codon by an initiator tRNA in the ribosome's decoding center. the three stop codons do not correspond to any tRNAs, this enables the release factor complex to initiate translation termination. translational recoding comprises the spectrum of events which occur when canonical translation is disrupted. programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting occurs during elongation. a PRF signal is defined as a cis-acting mRNA element that stochastically redirects translating ribosomes into an alternate reading frame. the downstream mRNA structure causes elongating ribosomes to pause while tRNAs are positioned over the slippery site. the weak homopolymer nucleotide sequences (poly-U or poly-A) are of particular interest in 1 PRF. the 5\u2019 (1) direction enables non-wobble base pairing. the ribosome denatures the pseudoknot, and translation elongation resumes in the 1 reading frame. a searchable database of predicted eukaryotic 1 PRF signals is available in the Predicted Ribosomal Frameshift Database (PRFdb), www.prfdb.umd.edu. a motif based search removes the assumption that frameshift events produce functional extended peptides. >99% of 1 PRF events direct ribosomes to termination codons within 30 codons. this triggers recruitment of the nonsense mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) complex to the mRNA, clearing the ribosome and initiating deadenylation of the 3\u2019 end. the mRNA then becomes a substrate for exonucleolytic degradation. mRNAs encode proteins involved in recruiting telomerase to shortened telomeres. the wide range of 1 PRF efficiencies promoted by these elements enabled characterization of a simple exponential decay function between 1 PRF efficiency and mRNA destabilizing activity. abrogation of 1 PRF in the EST2 mRNA resulted in cells with very short telomeres. as telomeres age, they progressively shorten, and at some point reach an intermediate, uncapped status. this recruits a complex containing the MRX complex (Mre11p, Rad50p, Xrs2p) plus Tel1p. failure to recruit telomerase leads to further telomere shortening, where they eventually resemble double-stranded breaks. telomerase recruitment to uncapped telomeres is controlled by relative stoichiometries of telomerase components in yeast. telomerase recruitment to uncapped telomeres is controlled by the relative stoichiometries of telomerase components in yeast. telomerase recruitment is less efficient and more telomeres progress rapidly to the DSB-like state. regulation of 1 PRF should be sequence-specific. regulation of 1 PRF should be sequence-specific. in the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), both 1 and 2 PRF are stimulated by the virus-encoded nsp1 replicase subunit that specifically interacts with sequence containing the slippery site. a growing body of evidence suggests such linkages may be forthcoming. the same mutation in ribosomal protein L10 (eL16) found in a significant fraction of patients with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) also promotes increased rates of 1 PRF. this suggests that somatically acquired mutations that affect 1 PRF may contribute to at least some cancers. 1 PRF was chosen because there are sufficient viral examples to enable the generation of heuristics. the first method is to search for allowable heptameric slippery sequences followed by strong downstream structure. this search is NP-complete27 and therefore computationally difficult. ribosomes to premature termination codons engendered the hypothesis that 1 frameshift signals function as mRNA destabilizing elements. this was initially validated in yeast cells using a well-defined viral frameshift signal. further analysis suggested a role for No-Go decay (NGD) as well. a +1 PRF signal in the yeast EST3 mRNA encodes a component of telomerase. the mRNA encodes a protein that \u201cdocks\u201d telomerase to chromosome ends. mRNAs encode proteins involved in recruiting telomerase to shortened telomeres. in unpublished studies, operational frameshift signals have been identified in at least 2 human messages encoding proteins required for telomere maintenance. it is estimated that diploid cells, which contain 64 chromosome ends, only contain 29 telomerase molecules. telomeres exist in a range of states, from long, and fully capped (by Rap1p, Rif2p, Rif1p trimers) to short and uncapped. the net effect is to \u201cimmortalize\u201d telomeres, resulting in longer lifespans, but at the cost of genome integrity. we propose that 1 PRF is used to maintain the correct stoichiometric ratios of telomerase components critical for telomerase recruitment. changes in the expression of any one of these components have dominant-negative effects on telomerase recruitment. operation 1 PRF signals have been identified in the STN1, CDC13, EST1 and EST2 mRNAs. telomerase recruitment is less efficient and more telomeres progress rapidly to the DSB-like state. regulation of 1 PRF should be sequence-specific. gene encodes dyskerin, protein that catalyzes conversion of uridines into pseudouridine in ribosomal rRNAs. hypo-pseudouridulated yeast and human ribosomes have lower affinities for tRNAs, resulting in greater rates of tRNA slippage at 1 PRF signals. X-DC is a member of a general class of diseases called ribosomopathies. mutations in ribosomal protein genes and genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. unpublished yeast based studies suggest translational fidelity defects including altered rates of 1 PRF may play important roles in this general class of diseases. new evidence links global defects in 1 PRF to growing number of human diseases. recent studies in yeast revealed the importance of this mechanism in telomere maintenance and cell-cycle control. current research suggests that may also be applicable to human cells."}
