{"summary": "all the patients suspected of suffering from H1N1 were admitted and isolated. all the patients on admission were tested for H1N1 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the virus isolated from affected cases had molecular features of North American and Eurasian swine, avian and human influenza virus,4-6 which was not previously detected in pigs or humans. there was also an increase number of the young population being affected as is the case when seasonal influenza is concerned. within 7 days of close contact with a confirmed case of H1N1 influenza A virus OR Resides in a community where there were one or more confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza A virus. Suspected case with an influenza test that is positive for influenza A, but is unsubtypable by reagents used to detect seasonal influenza virus infection OR Suspected case who died of an unexplained acute respiratory illness. patients with underlying risk factors, co-morbidity and hypoxia were admitted in high dependency area. patients were closely followed till they were discharged as per the ATS CAP criteria. two nasopharyngeal swabs and 2 throat swabs were collected. samples kept in viral transport medium and stored at 2-8oC. nasopharyngeal aspirate or Bronchial wash samples were sent to the central public health laboratory. suspected cases were isolated and screened for H1N1. suspected cases were isolated and screened for H1N1. if indicated, patients were transferred to nearby royal hospital. blood sugar (RBS), Renal Function (UE1), Liver Function Test (LFT), Creatinine Kinase (CK), C reactive protein (CRP), Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Arterial Blood Gas (ABG), Blood for bacterial culture, Chest X-Ray (CXR) and available sputum was sent for bacterial culture. additional blood investigations were done as per the presenting clinical features of the patient. from July to October 2009, 101 patients suspected to be suffering from H1N1 were admitted in al Nahdha hospital. all the data was analyzed using SPSS software 14.0 and using mainly descriptive statistical analysis method. more than half of patients with H1N1 were between the age group of 31 to 55 years compared to only 13.9% beyond 55 years of age. more than half of patients with H1N1 were between the age group of 31 to 55 years as compared to only 13.9% beyond 55 years of age.

(%) 4/46(8.7%) of samples collected for sputum culture, only two grew pathogenic bacteria. almost all of the blood cultures were sterile; the remaining confirmed to be contaminant. 65 laboratory confirmed H1N1 cases were admitted and isolated at the reference hospital in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman from July 2009 to October 2009. the adult population was mainly affected in contrast to seasonal influenza hospitalization when admissions were for extremes of age. most of our patients had chest radio graphical abnormality involving lower zones. patchy infiltrates affecting one or two quadrants of the lung was more common compared with three or four in Mexican patients. more studies are needed especially during influenza outbreaks. influenza can be considered in differential diagnosis. it would be worthwhile to consider antiviral treatment in these patients."}
