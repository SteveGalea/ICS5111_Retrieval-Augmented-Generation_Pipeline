{"summary": "MERS-CoV was initially identified from a 60-year-old man. he was admitted to a private hospital in jeddah on June 13, 2012. he died 11 days later from progressive respiratory failure. the first occurrence of MERS-CoV was thought to have particular predominance for male patients and those with comorbid diseases. initial cases were reported among elderly patients with a median age of 56 years. the initial predominance of male cases may be due to the characteristics of the outbreak in Al-Hasa. primary cases were more likely to be male (80% versus 58%), and to be older (median age: 58 years versus 48 years) health care workers constituted 35% of secondary cases versus 3% of primary cases. the difference in the positivity rate was not statistically significant in three studies. sporadic (community-onset), intra-familial transmission, and health-care-related transmission require the classification of cases into: sporadic (community-onset), intra-familial transmission. the acquisition of MERS-CoV in these sporadic cases could be from animal contact. the data suggest that camels are the likely source of MERS-CoV. previous studies showed a high rate of positive serology in dromedary camels. workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians may be at higher risk of MERS-CoV infection than other people. so far no other animal link has been identified apart from camels and bats. the Zarqa outbreak involved eleven patients and eight of them were health care workers. nine (7.2%) of 124 contacts in this outbreak were positive by serology. workers who contracted MERS-CoV were involved in aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, airway suctioning, and sputum induction. sporadic cases were reported in different countries where these cases originated in that area. only limited human-to-human transmission of travel-related cases was reported in france and the united kingdom. for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the use of airborne infection isolation precautions with all patients. for the Hajj and Umrah, the Saudi Ministry of Health recommended that people at increased risk should postpone their Hajj."}
