{"summary": "RNA molecules are one of the most functionally versatile players in the cell. RNA molecules play regulatory functions in various cellular processes and catalyze chemical reactions. RNA molecules often undergo transition states during their folding pathways. this paper will focus on the diversity of proteins with RNA chaperone activity. I will present examples for proteins with RNA chaperone activity and discuss possible mechanisms of RNA chaperoning. list of proteins with possible RNA chaperone activity is growing constantly. tRNA synthetase from neurospora crassa is a \u201cstabilizer\u201d for the mitochondrial self-splicing group I intron. there exists an increasing number of proteins that simply possess RNA annealing activity. bacterial host factor Hfq showed annealing activity on random substrates. tertiary structures are higher order structures that are built by assembling the secondary structure elements into a more complex collapsed fold. they can also involve formation of helices. tertiary structures are often less stable and depend on the formation of secondary structures. a subset of molecules misfolds and accumulates into an inactive population. in vivo, some group I introns require the assistance of proteins to splice efficiently and prevent misfolding. for large RNP complexes such as the ribosome, a growing body of evidence suggests several additional factors such as helicases exist. a mutant StpA that shows stronger binding towards RNA shows decreased RNA chaperone activity suggesting strong binding could also be detrimental to RNA folding. a prominent member of this group is the bacterial host factor Hfq that showed annealing activity on random substrates. a prominent member of this group is the bacterial host factor Hfq that showed annealing activity on random substrates. secondary structural elements form between regions within the RNA molecule that are in close proximity. the stability of a base-pair depends on the stability of both of its neighbouring base-pairs. tertiary structures are higher order structures that are built by assembling the secondary structure elements into a more complex collapsed fold. group I intron of thymidylate synthase gene of phage T4 misfolds in absence of translation. ribosome does not prevent base-pairing between exon and intron sequences. in vivo, some group I introns require the assistance of proteins to splice efficiently and prevent misfolding. assays that measure catalytic activities of correctly folded ribozymes make it difficult to evaluate RNA chaperone activity using a single assay. the substrates in the in vitro assay (e.g., oligonucleotides) might differ in sequence requirements or structure requirements from possible native substrates and might lead to negative results. splicing at 37\u00b0C is measured in the presence of chaperones. the construct (shosho) contains short exon 1 (27 nucleotides) and short exon 2 (2 nucleotides) sequences. an increase in the rate of duplex formation is observed when the tested protein has RNA annealing activity. melting activity can be detected by using native gel electrophoresis or by measuring loss of fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) that occurs upon dissociation of the complementary fluorophor labelled RNAs. new approaches to detect folding or unfolding of single molecules emerge and include time-resolved NMR. td intron has been used lengthily to monitor RNA chaperone activity of various proteins. splicing of different group I intron constructs that do not fold readily into the splicing competent structure is tested with and without chaperones. in vivo folding trap assay: (a) in the absence of translation, the group I intron folds correctly. (b) in the absence of translation, misfolding occurs. (d\u2013e) show the in vivo antitranscription termination assay. scription read-through of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) is inhibited due to the preceding transcription terminator stem. proteins with RNA chaperone activity are able to melt the terminator stem. as a consequence read-through occurs and the cells become chloramphenicol resistant. oligos present in concentrations above their dissociation constant are incubated together. an increase in the rate of duplex formation is observed when the tested protein has RNA annealing activity. RNA annealing can be measured by observing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon the closing up of the two fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides. hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction and folding of ribozyme-substrate 3-way helical junction have been studied in a great detail. this assay represents a suitable tool to study RNA chaperone activity upon folding of the hammerhead ribozyme-substrate construct. annealing and strand displacement can be studied independently of each other. s are shortened for the upstream exon down to 27 nucleotides and the downstream exon shortened to only 2 nucleotides. this short exon construct (td shosho) splices at 37\u00b0C but RNA chaperones increase folding. the splicing rate of the short-exon construct is increased as well. RNA annealing can be measured by observing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon the closing up of the two fluorescently labelled oligos. melting activity can be detected by using native gel electrophoresis or by measuring loss of fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) that occurs upon dissociation of the complementary fluorophor labelled RNAs. annealing and strand displacement can be studied independently of each other. the advantage on the well-studied assay is that depending on whether single-turnover conditions are employed, it is possible to distinguish between annealing and strand dissociation activities. in the wild type group I intron an open reading frame is present. the upstream in vitro transcribed construct contains 549 nucleotides of exon1 and 131 nucleotides of the 5\u2032-part of the intron. downstream construct consists of the remaining 147 nucleotides of the intron and 23 nucleotides of exon2. the mutant td precursor construct tdSH1 consists of an exonic stop codon and has an additional intronic point mutation (C865U) the tdSH1 construct is significantly impaired in splicing in vivo. the tdSH1 construct is significantly impaired in splicing in vivo. the mutant td precursor construct tdSH1 consists of an exonic stop codon and has an additional intronic point mutation (C865U) this further destabilizes the native intron structure. the tdSH1 construct is significantly impaired in splicing in vivo. nucleocapsid protein 7 (Ncp7) of HIV increases hammerhead ribozyme cleavage significantly. a few years later, another virus-encoded protein with RNA chaperone activity has been identified. studies on Nc proteins demonstrated that these proteins possess RNA chaperone activity in vitro but also are required for strand annealing and strand displacement activities on their target RNAs in vivo. the protein was tested in vitro in a strand-annealing and strand-displacement assay and exhibited strong activities in both tests. ribosomal proteins are required within every cellular organism to build up the bacterial 70S or the eukaryal 80S ribosome. many ribosomal proteins further regulate transcription or translation of their own operons. ribosomal proteins are also involved in various very different cellular processes. E. coli ribosomal proteins L15, L16, L18, and L19 possess RNA chaperone activity comparable to other protein chaperones such as Hsp90. the exact mechanism, however, remains elusive. initiation factor 1 (IF1) is a small 71 amino-acid long peptide. it contains 5 rigid -barrels and belongs to the OB (oligomer-binding)-fold proteins. IF1 is capable of complementing for a cspB and cspC double knock-out in Bacillus subtilis. hnRNP I is identical to poly-pyrimidine binding protein (PTB) isoform 4. it regulates cap-independent translation, localization of cytoplasmic RNAs, and poly-A-site cleavage. calcivirus replication requires PTB but only at lower or at higher temperatures than the permissive 37\u00b0C. bacterial protein Hfq was first discovered in the end 1960s as a host factor for bacteriophage Q replication. it regulates posttranscriptional regulation of small noncoding RNAs. Hfq binds to A/U rich, unstructured regions. prion protein is a misfolded isoform of the essential component of prion diseases. it was demonstrated that the prion protein has RNA (and DNA) annealing activity. however, it was not yet shown if it possesses also RNA unwinding activity. nucleocapsid protein 7 (Ncp7) of HIV increases hammerhead ribozyme cleavage significantly. a few years later, another virus-encoded protein with RNA chaperone activity has been identified, the HDV delta antigen. many of the viral proteins show exceptional high degree of disorder. nucleocapsid protein from Coronavirus shows RNA chaperone activity. the protein was isolated as a repressor of a splicing-deficient group I intron in phage T4. the protein was tested in vitro in a strand-annealing and strand-displacement assay. ribosomal proteins are highly conserved among various species. many ribosomal proteins have long unstructured extensions that wind their way through the ribosome. ribosomal proteins possess chaperoning activity, with ribosomal protein S12 from the small ribosomal subunit having the strongest activity. cold-shock proteins and IF1 Cold shock proteins are conserved throughout bacteria and plants. they are expressed during cold-shock, when misfolding of RNAs becomes a major problem for the organism and function as transcriptional antiterminator at low temperature. there are no elaborate studies on whether there is a difference between RNA duplex and DNA duplex melting. IF1 and csps have at least partially overlapping activities. hnRNPs and human la protein Heteronuclear Ribonucleoproteins possess RNA chaperone activity. three proteins, hnRNP A1, C1 and U, were identified and hnRNP A1 enhanced hammerhead ribozyme cleavage in vitro. hnRNP I is identical to poly-pyrimidine binding protein (PTB) isoform 4. it regulates cap-independent translation, localization of cytoplasmic RNAs, and poly-A-site cleavage. calcivirus replication requires PTB but only at lower or at higher temperatures than the permissive 37\u00b0C. the bacterial protein is a pleiotropic regulator for gene expression in bacteria. it interacts with many small RNAs and their mRNA targets. it regulates posttranscriptional regulation of small noncoding RNAs. the function of the human prion protein is not clearly understood. it was demonstrated that the prion protein has RNA (and DNA) annealing activity. however, it was not yet shown if it possesses also RNA unwinding activity. the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is linked to the fragile X syndrome. the disease is due to transcriptional silencing of the gene. proteins with RNA chaperone activity do not require an external energy source as RNA helicases do. this raises the question of how RNA chaperones accomplish the RNA folding task. ribosomal protein L1 has maximum RNA chaperone activity starting from 400 nM up to 2 M protein concentration. at least a 20-fold excess of protein to RNA has to be present to achieve maximum chaperoning activity of ribosomal protein L1 from E. coli. RNA chaperone activity of StpA has been studied for more than a decade. it was shown that StpA loosens tertiary contacts within the thymidylate synthase group I intron. but how is the opening of tertiary structures accomplished without the hydrolysis of ATP\" the idea of disordered RNA chaperones is especially attractive because there are many advantages of proteins with disordered regions over compact proteins. the problemsome question of where the energy for the RNA unwinding might come from could be explained by the gain of compactness upon interaction with the RNA. RNA chaperones are evaluated in assays for their broad specificity. in vivo they might be specialized to supervise folding of only a subset of RNA molecules."}
