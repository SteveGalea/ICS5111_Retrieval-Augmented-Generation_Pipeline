{"summary": "internet connectivity has opened the door to new techniques for disease detection worldwide. these ideas have been applied to influenza, given its annual occurrence and the potential for pandemics and emerging infections2. Accurate and rapid surveillance of influenza and other acute respiratory infections could reduce costs associated with unnecessary investigations. nasal swabs have been successfully used by volunteers to collect viable samples for influenza culture at home. the non-invasive nature of oral specimen collection makes it an easier and more convenient and thus preferable alternative to nasal swabs. the work reported here adds to existing efforts by considering important questions of utility of different specimen types and how the resulting surveillance information can be used at an individual level. the platform is designed to acquire community generated diagnostic samples and couple them with other contemporaneous information such as participatory syndromic reports. this platform is designed to acquire community generated diagnostic samples and couple them with other contemporaneous information such as participatory syndromic reports. a second illness was included if the specimen was provided at least 2 weeks after the initial specimen. if a participant reported symptoms on their weekly survey, they immediately were sent an email reminder to follow the instructions in the kit. instructions for submission of the kit were made available on a report page. the kits were mailed to participants at the beginning of the influenza season. participants were instructed to collect a nasal sample by inserting the flocked nasal swab approximately 2.5 cm into one nostril and rotating. the swab was then placed in transport media for testing. samples were tested on both the GenMark Respiratory Viral Panel and Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel. both offer a multiplex panel for respiratory pathogens. they differ in the DNA/RNA extraction methods used, in the measured sensitivity and specificity. Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Parainfluenza Virus (PIV) 1, Parainfluenza Virus (PIV) 2, Parainfluenza Virus (PIV) 3, Parainfluenza Virus (PIV) 4, Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus and Adenovirus. the result is not binary, a threshold cycle (C\u00ad results Participant Demographics and Participation Between November 1, 2013 and April 30, 2014, 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit. participants submitted kits an average of 3.29 (95% CI: 2.39, 4.18) days after symptom onset. people ages 20 to 77 signed up and received kits, and 70% of signups were women. in 10 cases, there was a difference between results for the nasal and saliva specimen pairs on at least one of the systems. the same pathogen was also detected in the other system. none of the rapid tests returned alongside any of the 71 returned pairs of specimens demonstrated positive results for any pathogens. individuals reported that they would find it useful to know what others in their area have had near them (83.3% for those who sent in kits, 93.7% for those who did not) the study seeks to build a scalable method connecting self-reported symptoms to infection type. participants of this study are similar demographically to those in other participatory systems6. participants of this study are similar demographically to those in other participatory systems6. crowdsourced data can be used to generate context-specific, rapid information for disease surveillance that has the potential to impact public health behaviors. a cohort approach can be used during seasonal outbreak or pandemic investigations. what part of the process of submitting your sample was easiest\" Sent in kits (29 responses) Filling out the online form 20 (69%) Using nasal swab 4 (14%) Saliva collection 5 (17%) 5.
