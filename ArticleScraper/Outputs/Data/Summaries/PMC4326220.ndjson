{"summary": "a pathogenic antigen is recognized by an antibody or B-cell receptor (BCR) through some regions on the surface of the antigen that is commonly known as the B-cell epitope. the most reliable methods for identification of an epitope are X-ray crystallography and NMR techniques. sequence-sequence alignment methods predict epitopes according to the alignment of mimotope sequences and the antigen structure. sequence-structure alignment methods predict epitopes according to the alignment of mimotope sequences and the antigen structure. mimoPro employs the idea of patch-based and graph-based searching. the results showed the specificity of new method improved a lot. in the first state, an epitope is defined as the surface residue of antigen with ASA decreased more than a given threshold upon binding with the antibody, and 1 2 is frequently used. the testing dataset is from the Mimobench of mimoDB. the testing dataset is from the mimobench of mimoDB. input module is the start of a request submitted by user. output module is the prediction results of the new method. Figure 1(a) is the module of antigen processing. the implementation of antigen processing includes 3 steps: feature extraction, amino acids classification, and residues deletion. the method extracts 6 epitope related features as EPCES. the real dataset in this study is imbalanced, and the instances from negative class take the majority of the data. epitope prediction is known as MimoPro for mimotopes analysis. the core algorithm includes five steps: dividing antigen surface into overlapped patches, constructing undirected graph on each patch, generating extreme value distribution for each mimotope sequence, aligning mimotopes on each patch and scoring patch. Dynamic programming and branch and bound method were employed in the step of aligning mimotopes on each patch. the branch and bound method ensures the searching is complete; and the branch and bound method ensures the searching is efficient. the residues in the highest score patch are retained as the candidate epitopes. in the first state, an epitope is defined as the surface residue of antigen with ASA decreased more than a given threshold upon binding with the antibody. in the second state, an epitope is defined as the residue of antigen which has a contact area above a given threshold upon interaction with the antibody, while the value 4 is frequently used. it is the latest and largest database for mimotopes. it offers a benchmark for mimotope-based site mapping. in 18 testing cases there are 13 antigen-antibody complexes.

FP is the number of predicted epitope residues proven not to be the true epitope residues. FN is the number of predicted nonepitope residues proven not to be the true epitope residues. 0.07 0.62/0/60 0.66/0.67 0.32/0.30 2GHW_A 29 38/37 0.48/0.48 0.80/0.81 0.37/0.38 0.13/0.14 0.64/0.64 0.73/0.74 0.42/0.42 2NY7_G 25 30/29 0.12/0.12 0.87/0.87 0.10/0.10 0.00/0.00 0.49/0.50 0.78/0.79 0.11/0.11 1G9M_G 15 47 the number of predicted epitopes of this method was less than MimoPro for most cases. the average specificity score on testing dataset has reached 81% which is higher than MimoPro. the average specificity score on testing dataset has reached 81%. the new method predicted one less true epitope residue than MimoPro. the sensitivity of the new method is slightly lower than MimoPro. the PPV have more predictive validity. we also used SVM for classifying the surface amino acids of antigen. for both methods, we tried lots of combinations of parameters. different parameters Sen Spe PPV MCC (Sen + Spe)/2 ACC F RF I = 5, K = 0, S = 1 0.58 0.81 0.34 0.15 0.70 0.79 0.43 I = 10, K = 0, S = 1 0.56 0.83 0.34 0.14 0.80 0.42 I = 15, K = 0, S = 1 0.53 0.83 0.34 0.14 0. the new method was rated the best with a PPV of 0.33 which is improved a lot than the other methods. the new method was rated the best with a PPV of 0.33. urf 0.36 0.86 0.26 0.07 0.61 0.79 0.31 This method 0.58 0.81 0.33 0.14 0.69 0.79 0.42. the prediction results on the testing dataset of this method are shown in Table 2.
