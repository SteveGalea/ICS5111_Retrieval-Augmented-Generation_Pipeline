{"summary": "EVD was first discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. by 2013 had caused approximately 20 recorded outbreaks across East and Central Africa. each case containment was achieved within a few months and after fewer than 500 confirmed cases. the 2014 west africa outbreak has changed everything. there was initial speculation that this was a different virus than has been seen before. a discrete contact with one infected animal is responsible for all the disease seen. there is no change in route of transmission, no suggestion of aerosolised spread, no gross differences in disease presentation. there is huge stigma associated with Ebola, similar to those seen in early years of HIV care. the present outbreak began very close to where civil war erupted in 1991. there was initially disbelief about its existence, and conspiracy theories were prominent. novel therapeutics are being fast-tracked by regulatory authorities and rolled out for testing in clinical settings. novel therapeutics are on the horizon, with three major vaccine developments underway, entering Phase 1 and 2 trials. the only human-to-human transmission of Ebola occurs via direct contact with body fluids of an infected individual. the chance of transmission is greatly increased in the advanced stages of the disease, when diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding can occur, and viral load is high. the seriousness of this outbreak represents an opportunity for using new approaches if potential harms and benefits are properly considered. the employment of Ebola survivors as \u2018patient champions\u2019 has been proposed, both in advocacy and clinical work within communities and hospitals. once numbers begin to fall, complacency must not set in. the upcoming months will be vital in determining the direction of the response. time is not on our side, but the will and effort is now here for the humanitarian catastrophe of our time."}
