{"summary": "an estimated 240 million individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) live in high to moderate endemic regions in Asia, sub-Sharan Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America. HBV is the smallest known DNA virus with a circular, double-stranded genome (3.2 kb) having four overlapped open reading frames encoding surface or envelope (S), core (C), pre-core (pre-C/e), polymerase/reverse-transcriptase ( traditional herbal products and drugs of indigenous origin have an ancient history of curing several chronic and infective diseases. a range of various plant metabolites are shown to impede virus replication without affecting the host physiology. these natural products may also modulate the host immune response against infection. natural compounds and drugs Twelve natural antiviral compounds of plant origin were selected on the basis of their published in vitro or vivo antiviral activities. the approved anti-HBV nucleoside analog, lamivudine (3TC; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) served as standard (positive control) five doses (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 50 g/ml) of each compound were prepared by diluting in culture media. RPMI with 0.1% DMSO served as untreated or negative control. cells were visually monitored for morphological changes. culture supernatants were replaced with fresh dose every alternate day. samples collected on day 1, 3, and 5 were saved at 20 \u00b0C. all data were presented as % inhibition of HBsAg expression. using FuGENE6 (Promega, USA) in a 48-well culture plate, following treatment with all compounds, including DMSO (0.1%) as untreated control. cell lysates were prepared and luciferase expression measured. kcal/mol were re-docked to HBV Pol to evaluate binding mechanisms. target protein was prepared by removing any heterogeneous compounds and water molecules. polar hydrogen atoms and Kollman charges were added to the protein. lamivudine, quercetin, rutin, hesperidin, bergenin, azadirachtin, baccatin III, lupeol, embelin and naringenin were purchased. the approved anti-HBV nucleoside analog, lamivudine (3TC; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) served as standard (positive control) cells were seeded (0.5 105 well, in triplicate) in a 96-well flat-bottom culture plate. RPMI with 0.1% DMSO served as untreated or negative control. culture supernatants were replaced with fresh dose every alternate day. samples collected on day 1, 3, and 5 were saved at 20 \u00b0C. all data were presented as % inhibition of HBsAg expression. culture supernatants collected on day 5 were analyzed for HBeAg synthesis. luciferase assay was performed as described previously. Molecular docking The modeled HBV Pol was used as receptor for screening the binding modes of antiviral natural compounds. all compounds were energy minimized using Autodock 4.2 as described elsewhere. al step, quaternion and torsion steps were set to 150, 0.2 and 5 respectively. best docked structures were saved and analyzed for receptor-ligand interactions using Discovery Studio 4.0 (Accelrys Software Inc., 2012) bergenin and naringenin did not show any effect on inhibition of HBsAg. the two compounds, bergenin and naringenin, did not show any effect on inhibition of HBsAg. in natural infection, seropositivity of HBeAg is a hallmark of active viral DNA replication. this is analogous to HIV \u2018p24\u2032 antigen where ELISA is a valid tool to monitor retroviral RNA replication. prolonged treatment beyond day 5 did not show any significant effect. effect of combination treatment Compared to quercetin treatment alone, its combinations (1:1, w/w) with individual compounds (baccatin III, psoralen, embelin, menisdaurin and azadirachtin) further enhanced the antiviral activity by 8\u201310%. the amino acid residues from 347 to 698 determine the reverse transcriptase activity of HBV Pol. based on the primary sequence alignment, we used HIV-1 RT (PDB Id: 1RTD) as a template for HBV Pol homology modeling. s and the type of interactions responsible for forming a stable HBV Pol-inhibitor complex are presented in Table 1. Binding parameters for the interaction of HBV Pol with plant-derived antiviral compounds are presented in Table 1.
