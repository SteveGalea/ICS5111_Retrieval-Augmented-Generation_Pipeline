{"summary": "the group of secretory RNases has included, since the 60s, an increasing number of members that have been discovered, characterized and classified as the \u201cpancreatic-type\u201d RNases (5, 6) this definition originates from the bovine pancreatic RNase A, a 13.7 kDa and 124 AA residues enzyme. the cytotoxic bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase) (17), the unique natively dimeric member of the superfamily (18, 19), and also RNase 5 or angiogenin (ANG) (20). ANG is 123 AA residues long and exerts ribonucleolytic activity against tRNAs as well. other RNases belonging to non-mammalian species are also known. many of the mentioned basic residues are considered \u201csubsites\u201d crucial for an optimal catalysis (11, 30) or they are sometimes considered even as secondary active sites. the already mentioned secretory RNase 1 is expressed in all tissues, but it is particularly abundant in endothelial cells. cytokines, such as CCL11 and CCL24, can induce RNase 2 and RNase 3 secretion via the PI3K/MAPK pathway (38, 39). cytokines, such as CCL11 and CCL24, can induce RNase 2 and also RNase 3 secretion via the PI3K/MAPK pathway (38, 39). eosinophilic RNases release through the toll-like receptors signaling pathways (39) ANG is considered the oldest pancreatic type RNase member (53) it displays three instead of four paired cysteines with respect to the other RNases (24, 53), and its ribonucleolytic activity, although being very low, is mandatory for its angiogenetic action (36, 54). in cancer cells, the increase of rRNA production and angiogenesis definitely enhances cell growth and tumor progression (56). ANG is known to trigger the formation of cytotoxic tRFs species. induced cell death effect can prevail over ANG angiogenetic action. the 127 AA residues long RNase 6 (64) is ubiquitously distributed, including neutrophils and monocytes. BS-RNase, ANG, ONC, and amphinase have been found to be immunosuppressive, embryotoxic, and aspermatogenic. a molecular mechanism that is carried out without catalytic degradation of RNAs has been suggested by Ilinskaya et al. binase is reported to interact with KRAS, stabilizing the inactive GDP-bound conformation of RAS, thereby inhibiting MAPK/ERK signaling. balnase is almost identical to binase except for its A106T mutated residue (85). however, its biological activities, as well as the ones of balifase, have not been investigated enough yet. exRNA promotes the activation of proteases that trigger blood coagulation factors XI and XII. exRNA mediates the endothelial brain permeability and RNase A treatment reduces vessel occlusion, preventing brain edema. exRNA is able to increase inflammation by stimulating leukocyte adhesion, transmigration and mobilization of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the conservation of its Gly38 residue is crucial to maintaining the full catalytic activity against duplex RNAs (111). the secreted RNases endowed with relevant biological activities do not display their action only extracellularly, but they are often able to enter the cell to exert their peculiar activities against intracellular RNAs. the group of secretory RNases has included, since the 60s, an increasing number of members that have been discovered, characterized and classified as the \u201cpancreatic-type\u201d RNases (5, 6). this definition originates from the bovine pancreatic RNase A, a 13.7 kDa and 124 AA residues enzyme that has been the most studied RNase in the past (7\u201310) the most studied RNases are the 114 AA residues amphinase and ranpirnase. the smallest variant is called onconase (ONC) because of its antitumor activity exerted against many cancer types. mammalian and amphibian secretory RNases, numbered from 1 to 8, have been characterized today in humans. the already mentioned pancreatic RNase 1 is expressed in all tissues, but it is particularly abundant in endothelial cells. RNase 2 and 3 are highly basic eosinophil secretory variants that reciprocally share 67% identity but only 32 and 26% with RNase 1, respectively. the 133 AA residues RNase 3 is eosinophil-specific and is also named the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) (40, 41) it exerts remarkable bactericidal effects, promoting the agglutination of bacteria cells and cytotoxicity (42) also when its catalytic activity is nil (43) ANG can trigger growth signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2 and AKT activation, upon its binding to a receptor. in cancer cells, the increase of rRNA production and angiogenesis definitely enhances cell growth and tumor progression. ANG inhibition can on one hand counteract tumor growth, but, at the same time, promote neuronal damage. RNase 6 is thought to exert an active role in inflammation because its level increases in the urinary tract after infection (65). the antimicrobial properties of this variant are carried out by inducing bacteria agglutination (66). RNase 7 and 8 are formed by 128 and 127 AA residues, respectively. four bacterial RNases belong to the RNase N1/T1 microbial superfamily (79) barnase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (80\u201382), binase from B. pimulus (82, 83), balifase from B. altitudinis (84), and balnase from B. altitudinis (85). binase is natively dimeric (83, 90), and possesses remarkable anti RNASET2 is secreted by damaged tissues, exhibits chemotactic activity and initiates immune response(s) humans lacking or carrying RNASET2 mutations suffer neurological disorders or even misfunction in the immune system. exRNA promotes the activation of proteases that trigger the blood coagulation factors XI and XII, while a RNase A pretreatment can delay occlusive thrombi formation (100). Nase 1 reduced pathological parameters that are characteristic for ischemia/reperfusion injury, thus improving functional myocardial recovery (102). secretory RNases can become crucial modulators of physiological cell functions by acting as natural exRNA scavengers. the largest part of exRNA released in body fluids is encapsulated inside extracellular vesicles and exosomes. oligomeric moieties can become advantageous for many RNases in terms of acquiring new activities or potentiating pre-existing ones. the main obstacle for extracellular RNASES to exert their antitumor action is represented by the difficulty to be cellularly internalized. this occurs through endocytosis (118) and only if a fruitful interaction with the cell membrane occurs. the most desired biological activity of RNases is to be selectively cytotoxic against malignant cells. the basic net charge per se is not enough for a RNase to be internalized in the cell. however, the specific orientation of a RNase molecule can become crucial for a successful approach to the cell membrane. the two crucial for catalysis are replaced by arginine (126) the advantage represented by a favored internalization may be counteracted once in the cells by the RNase affinity increase toward the negatively charged RI (127). the cytotoxicity against CHO cells grown in suspension is quite lower than the one exerted vs. the same adherent cell subtype (128) a BS-RNase variant characterized by a C-terminus engineered with a key-sequence is not cytotoxic because it is unable to be released in the cytosol to elicit its anti-tumor activity. a human immuno-ErbB2-RNase 1 fusion protein was internalized in SKBR3 cells and its direct transfer from endosomes to the cytosol was demonstrated. many studies have been performed to unveil the intracellular routing of extracellular RNases once internalized by endocytosis. however, diverse RNases, such as ONC or BS-RNase as well as RNase A, RNase 1 or ANG follow different cellular pathways within one another. ANG/RNase 5 needs to be enzymatically active (72) but also to enter the nucleus. kDa protein was firstly extracted from the rat liver while the human variant was isolated from placenta (142) RI is a negatively charged horseshoe-shaped and leucine-rich macromolecule that is ubiquitously expressed in almost all cells (114). RI was considered for many years to be present only in the cell cytosol, but more recently its presence has been detected also in mitochondria and nuclei (144). wt-RNase A can be active against tumors either in vitro or in vivo (158\u2013160) wt-RNase A doses, not 200 mg/mouse (159) or concentrations not lower than 2 mg/mL (145 M) in the cell culture medium (160) were used in those cases. if all RNase A molecules did not enter the cells, these doses certainly overpassed the cytosolic RI concentration, that is about 4 M (16 167, were found to be cytotoxic against some malignant leukemia cell lines at a concentration of about 20 g/mL (168), even if they were definitely inactive against pancreatic cancer cells (125). if an RNase is induced to oligomerize, this would increase the charge density of the enzyme moiety to help its internalization in tumor cells. the main obstacle for extracellular RNases to exert their antitumor action is represented by the difficulty to be cellular the natively dimeric BS-RNase assumes the most advantageous orientation for its internalization when it faces both N-termini toward the cell membrane (122), and the structure of BS-RNase shows that both N-termini actually adopt the same orientation. a favored internalization may be counteracted once in the cells by the RNase affinity increase toward the negatively charged RI (127). cytotoxicity against CHO cells grown in suspension is quite lower than the one exerted vs. the same adherent cell subtype (128). the cytotoxic potency of different RNases is due to optimal cell membrane interaction and endocytic internalization. a BS-RNase variant characterized by a C-terminus engineered with a key-sequence is not cytotoxic because it is unable to be released in the cytosol to elicit its anti-tumor activity (131). a human immuno-ErbB2-RNase 1 fusion protein was internalized in SKBR3 cells, and its direct transfer from endosomes to the cytosol was demonstrated. ANG/RNase 5 needs to be enzymatically active (72) but also to enter the nucleus to exert its fundamental angiogenic activity in both normal and cancer cells. angiogenic activity in both normal and cancer cells is crucial for some RNases. RI is a negatively charged horseshoe-shaped and leucine-rich macromolecule. RI can form very tight complexes with RNase A (146) and with RNase 1 (147), ANG (148) and EDN (149) most of the RNase-RI complexes characterized so far are not dissociable because their Kd values fall into the pico- to femtomolar range (152). ANG can sterically evade the cytosolic interaction with RI. a cytosolic RI concentration in mammalian BS-RNase should be free to exploit RI saturation and exert cytotoxic activity. if all RNase A molecules did not enter the cells, these doses certainly overpassed the cytosolic RI concentration, that is about 4 M (161). if an RNase is induced to oligomerize, and thus, to be bulkier. RNase oligomerization: a strategy to Obtain Stable and More Active RNase Derivatives Each step necessary to exert their biological action could represent a huge obstacle for RNases. a controlled induction of protein self-association leading to natural or artificial RNase oligomers may represent a fruitful strategy to be promoted or underwent by the organism. a balance between desired modifications and unwanted affection of native properties is mandatory to obtain derivatives accompanied with fruitful enzymatic and biological activities. a balance between desired modifications and an excessive unwanted affection of the native properties is mandatory to obtain derivatives accompanied with fruitful enzymatic and biological activities. reagents displaying different \u201cn\u201d values allow differently sized stable dimers or oligomers to be formed, often accompanied with higher enzymatic activity than the native monomer. cross-linking can be reversible if the spacer contains a disulfide bond that becomes scissile once the cytosolic reducing environment is reached. oligomers are cytotoxic against transplanted melanoma in mice. reagents induce cross-linking between a free Cys sulfhydryl and the maleimide to form a reversible adduct if the spacer contains a scissile disulfide bond. the trimeric S72C-ONC showed instead to be less cytotoxic than its definitely active wt-ONC monomer (172). the advantage to obtain a bulky ONC trimeric derivative resides on its very probable steric inability to be filtered by the kidneys' glomeruli. this undesired effect was reversible upon discontinuing the treatment. oligomers have been produced also upon mixing at 37\u00b0C RNase A with metallic derivatives commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents. the yield of RNase A-cisplatin oligomers remarkably increases with the cisplatin/protein ratio (195), while with the other Pt adduct yields are definitely lower (196). this is because they very probably affect proteins, such as here RNase A, or in vivo serum albumin as well, at a higher these cross-linkers lack spacers and can covalently stabilize preformed oligomers. they can covalently link antibodies, or parts of them (light/heavy chains), with proteins, protein domains, toxins or whatever displays biological interest. asymmetric reagents have been used to form active hetero-adducts involving RNases. some of them have been tested with proteins different from RNases. asymmetric reagents have been used to form active hetero-adducts involving RNases. covalent dimers of single chain antibody fragments (scFv) consisting of variable regions of heavy and light chains (VH and VL) connected by a small peptide linker (175, 201) if desired, additional peptide spacers of various lengths and nature can be inserted between the proteins. in this way, a natural covalent link binds the two proteins, thus permitting the expression of the complete adduct without requiring subsequent chemical modifications.

responding to treatments available so far. adducts showed augmented cytotoxicity in vitro against many cancer cells, and in some cases also in mice (177, 218) the protein-fusion strategy against cancer has been used many other times with RNase 1 (213\u2013215) and ONC (220), but also with BS-RNase (226) and EDN (220), producing cytotoxic derivatives. the effects on their cytotoxic activity induced by proper ANG mutations (223) or by different linkers introduced in the supramolecular adducts have been compared. non-covalent RNase Oligomers Protein oligomerization occurs non-covalently. natively monomeric proteins can undergo dimerization or an even larger oligomerization degree. the non-covalent self-association of RNases is mainly ascribable to the 3D-DS mechanism, as reported in Table 2. the domain detached from the native monomer can reconstitute the native protomer contacts in each composite, functional unit (FU) of the oligomer. is/are absent in the native monomer (241) the domains involved in 3D-DS are often the protein N- or C-termini, or both, as it is for some RNases. the 3D-DS mechanism is shared by many other proteins, like for example cytochrome C (248), and above all by several amyloidogenic proteins, such as human prion protein, cystatin-C or also 2-microglobulin. the non-covalent aggregation has been known to occur in RNase A and BS-RNase since the 60s (256\u2013258) the non-covalent aggregation has been known to occur in RNase A and BS-RNase since the 60s (256\u2013258) a natively monomeric, 13.7 kDa RNase A (Figure 3A) can non-covalently self-associate by interacting with the substrate. but it can also oligomerize upon being subjected to lyophilization from 40% aqueous acetic acid solutions (256) or to thermal incubations in different solvents at very high protein concentration (262) based on experimental data have been built for a N + C-swapped-trimer. the most abundant species detectable is certainly the C-dimer that approaches 20% yield. its amount deriving from thermal incubations is lower (197, 262) all 3D-DS RNase A oligomers increase their enzymatic activity against ds-RNA substrates, or vs. DNA:RNA hybrids. the highest enzymatic activity is displayed by the species containing more C-swaps than N-swaps, because the former species expose a higher basic charge density than the latter ones. the same RNase A oligomers were not active against two human pancreatic tumor cell lines (125) however, the actual antitumor activity of the RNase A oligomers is debated because the two RNase A dimers are known to interact with RI, although with a 1:1 stoichiometry. the role of the inter-subunit disulfides has also been analyzed. the role of the inter-subunit disulfides has also been analyzed. the role of the inter-subunit disulfides has also been analyzed. the MM isoform undergoes monomerization upon losing the two mentioned disulfides and becomes therefore susceptible to the RI blockage. the MM isoform does not vary its conformation upon losing its inter-subunit disulfides and forms NCD only if the P19 and L28 are conserved, because these residues allow NCD to maintain the capability to evade RI. mutants of the monomeric BS-RNase derivative designed to evade RI exerted a 30-fold higher cytotoxic activity than the wild-type dimer (292). however, the acquired negative charge of Asp67 does not affect its cytotoxicity. however, many efforts have been performed to increase the RNase A/BS-RNase similarity to make also the pancreatic variant endowed with antitumor activity. oligomers display enzymatic and cytotoxic activities higher than the native dimer. oligomers also display enzymatic and cytotoxic activities higher than the native dimer. this variant is definitely more active than RNase A vs. ds-RNA substrates. cytotoxicity exerted by swapped and unswapped isomers, contrarily to BS-RNase. this result was ascribed to the stabilization effect of both the hinge loop and the leu28 side chain. other mutants have been engineered to evade RI. n101 detected in the RNase A N-dimer (233, 312). however, the structure of this dimer (303) is quite different from BS-RNase MM isoform. deletions suffered by the loop connecting the N-terminus to the protein core induced the spontaneous formation of stable dimers forming through the domain swapping of the N-termini. ONC can attack tRNAs, as well as other substrates, such as miRNAs, to exert its cytotoxic action. many positive results have been registered with monomeric wt-ONC both in vitro and in vivo against several still incurable tumors. however, the although reversible renal toxicity of ONC discovered upon clinical trials partially cooled down the initial enthusiasm. C-terminus were found to be less stable than the native enzyme (327, 328) this suggests a negative influence of the free ONC C-terminus in the stabilization of the N-swapped dimer. the unique way known to date to obtain large ONC homo-oligomers useful to escape renal filtration is the use of the aforementioned trifunctional maleimide to produce covalent derivatives. a mutant of fungal RNase T1 was shown to acquire activity against ds-RNA upon dimerization through 3D-DS. barnase was discovered to form a cyclic domain-swapped trimeric adduct. barnase interaction with its inhibitor barstar has been recently discovered to induce the lysis of staphylococcal bacteria (112) covalent oligomerization of RNases can be induced to form covalently linked derivatives upon the reaction of a protein with bifunctional or multifunctional cross-linkers. in this way, stable hetero- or homo-oligomers can be produced, but with the concomitant modification of one or more AA residue(s) diimidoesters or dialdehydes can react with the Lys residues of a protein. these reagents display two terminal reactive groups separated by a variable number of unreactive methylene (\u2013(CH2)n-) spacers. cross-linkers are advantageous to produce protein homo-oligomers or, alternatively, a cationized and thus more cytotoxic complex. dimethyl-suberimidate (Figure 1B) allowed the formation of amounts of covalently linked trimers and traces of higher-order oligomers. the bifunctional N-substituted maleimide derivatives displaying spacers of variable length are certainly useful to obtain active RNase oligomers. Nase A, BS-RNase, or ONC mutants with tris(N-maleimidoethyl)amine were produced. the mutation of G88 of the wild type is required because this residue allows the proper accommodation of a RNase molecule into the RI cavity to form the already mentioned tight RNase-RI complex. the mutant was produced to allow the formation of the trimer upon cross-linking the protein with the trifunctional maleimide. supramolecular RNase zero-length adducts can be produced also by heating the protein up to 85\u00b0C under vacuum. this method allowed RNase A to form novel isopeptide bonds between Lys and Glu residues upon inducing heat-vacuum dehydration. these derivatives showed a definitively reduced enzymatic activity and inactivity against cancer cells unless strongly cationized with polyspermine. catalytic residue is directly involved in the linking with the metallic moiety (195, 196) cisplatin and similar adducts display a reduced efficacy and undesired side-effects in therapy. cisplatin and/or similar adducts display a reduced efficacy and undesired side-effects in therapy. reagents can covalently link antibodies, or parts of them (light/heavy chains), with proteins, protein domains, toxins or whatever displays biological interest. they can be, on one side, maleimides or succinimides sometimes displaying dithio-derivatives in the spacers, combined in the other terminus with imidoesters, diones, thiones, or 2-iminothiolane. some other chemically cross-linked EGF-RNase or Immuno-RNase tumoricidal adducts have been produced since the 90s with RNase A (206, 207) or RNase 1 (208) the same strategy can be followed with diabodies (Figures 1H,J), which are non-covalent dimers of single chain antibodies. immuno-RNase conjugate Ligand = linker/spacer Diabody Y/N Cell/target and/or human cancer counteracted References Transferrin(Tf-RNase A Chemical Peptide N Tf-Receptor Leukemia (108) Anti-TfR-RNase A Chemical Monoclonal Antibody N Tf-Receptor Glioma (108) scFv CD5-RNase A Chemical Succinimidyl-pyridyl AAASGGPEGGS spacer N MDA-MB-231/436, BT549 breast cancer cells; SW 620 colon adenocarcinoma cells.

(19, 233) NMR showed that RNase A is chiefly denatured except for disulphides in 40% acetic acid, while it refolds properly. this permits the formation of many different RNase A oligomers, up to traces of tetradecamers. the most abundant species detectable is certainly the C-dimer that approaches 20% yield, while its amount deriving from thermal incubations is lower. the polarity of both RNase A N- and C-termini affects both the swapping propensity and the oligomers' stability (267), while either reducing conditions or deamidation events affecting many Asn residues reduce the tendency of RNase A aggregation through 3D-DS (268, 269) the highest enzymatic activity is displayed by the species containing more C-swaps than N-swaps. the antitumor activity of the oligomers has been measured too. in vivo experiments, this antitumor activity slightly increased when RNase A oligomers were conjugated with PEG (187) BS-RNase is the unique natively homo-dimeric member of the pancreatic-type RNase superfamily because of the two antiparallel disulfides linking the Cys31 residue of one subunit and the Cys32 of the other. each BS-RNase subunit is composed of 124 AA residues and displays 82% sequence identity with RNase A (17). native BS-RNase is an equilibrium mixture between two isoforms (Figures 4A,B), one the ribonucleolytic activity of the enzymes present in the bovine seminal fluids was first described by D'Alessio and Leone in 1963. the responsible agent for this activity was discovered to be BS-RNase, that is definitely more basic and more active against ds-RNA adducts than RNase A (289). this is true also after monomerizing the enzyme by the reduction of the two inter-subunit disulfides (290), thus confirming that the MM isoform does not vary its conformation upon losing its inter-subunit disulfides and forms NCD only if the P19 and L28 are conserved. however, mutants of the monomeric BS-RNase derivative designed to evade RI exerted a 30-fold higher cytotoxic activity than the wild-type dimer (292). tetramers, hexamers and even larger oligomers can be formed. tetramers, hexamers and even larger oligomers can be formed. the oligomers also exhibit enzymatic and cytotoxic activities higher than the native dimer. this variant is definitely more active than RNase A vs. ds-RNA substrates (12), reaching a maximum value at a pH 7.3. this pH is very close to the one of the blood and definitely higher than 6.5, the value under which RNase A exerts its maximal activity (12) the mutants, named HHP-RNases, exerted a quite high antitumor activity against human thyroid carcinoma-derived cell lines. PM8 (PM5 + P101Q) mutant (pdb 1H8X) (303); des-N-swapped dimer (304) other mutants able to swap their N-termini have been produced. an additional mutation allowed RNase 1 to spontaneously dimerize through 3D-DS thanks to the formation of four novel inter-subunits H-bonds. ONC is the unique pancreatic-type RNase known to be remarkably cytotoxic in its native monomeric form. the less investigated, but also amphibian, amphinase variant (27) ONC displays the same catalytic triad (here H10/K31/H97) and catalytic subsites similar to the RNase A ones. ONC has been recently discovered to form a N-swapped dimer upon lyophilization from acetic acid (200) this dimer displayed to be more cytotoxic against pancreatic cancer cells than the native ONC monomer (200). this suggests a negative influence of the free ONC C-terminus in the stabilization of the N-swapped dimer. barnase was discovered to form a cyclic domain-swapped trimeric adduct. barnase was derivatized, either as a monomer or as a dimer. barnase was discovered to induce the lysis of staphylococcal bacteria (112) peptides to form Immuno-RNase derivatives that were cytotoxic against breast and ovarian cancers (87\u201389) variant balifase has been characterized, apparently displaying a lower cytotoxicity than binase (84) residues 16\u201322 and 112\u2013115 can instead adopt variable conformations. this allows the domains linked to the protein flexible parts to adopt different orientations. a non-covalent dimer, or even larger oligomers, if more than a single flexible loop is present, can be formed (235, 243) Secreted RNase Oligomers 3D-DS* mechanism Cross-linked oligomers Cytotoxic activity RNase A Dimers/Trimers/Tetramers up to Tetradecamers traces Y: N + C swap Natural S-S bonds Yes RNase 1 Dimers Y: N-swap in mutants Mutants with S-S bonds (HHP/HHP2-RNase 1) Oligomers: Yes ONC Dimer Y: N-swap Only in RNase A aggregation was ascribed to a reciprocal exchange of the protein N-termini consequent to their detachment from the protein core (256). the actual presence of 3D-DS was then detected for BS-RNase only in 1993 by Mazzarella et al., while for RNase A in 1998 by Liu et al. (19, 233). ly denatured except for disulphides in 40% acetic acid, while it refolds properly, with exception of the 3D-DS-inducing flexible loops only when, after lyophilization, it is redissolved in a \u201cbenign\u201d buffer, such as phosphate (264). this permits the formation of many different RNase A oligomers, up to traces of tetradecamers (265). the cis configuration of the X-Pro114 peptide bond present in the loop preceding the C-terminus of RNase A, RNase 1 or also BS-RNase hinders the tendency of the same terminus to be swapped (266, 270, 271). the cis configuration of the X-Pro114 peptide bond present in the loop preceding the C-terminus of RNase A, RNase 1 or also BS-RNase hinders the tendency of the the antitumor activity of the oligomers has been measured too. a relevant activity always increasing with the basic charge density of the oligomers was displayed against leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. the same RNase A oligomers were not active against two human pancreatic tumor cell lines. native BS-RNase is an equilibrium mixture between two isoforms. native BS-RNase is characterized by the swapping of its N-termini. native dimer isoform, M=M, about 30% of the total (278, 279) and native dimer isoform, MM, about 70% of the total (19, 278) the ribonucleolytic activity of the enzymes present in the bovine seminal fluids was first described by D'Alessio and Leone in 1963. the responsible agent for this activity was discovered to be BS-RNase, that is definitely more basic and more active against ds-RNA adducts than RNase A (289). this is true also after monomerizing the enzyme by the reduction of the two inter-subunit disulfides (290), thus confirming that the MM isoform does not vary its conformation upon losing its inter-subunit disulfides and forms NCD only if the P19 and L28 mutations are conserved. however, mutants of the monomeric BS-RNase derivative designed to evade RI exerted a 30-fold higher cytotoxic activity than the wild-type dimer. however, the acquired negative charge of Asp67 does not affect its cytotoxicity. tetramers, hexamers and even larger oligomers can be formed through the swapping only of their N-termini. the swapping can occur either in the native dimer, to form a N + C + N-swapped tetramer (Figure 4D) or involve the BS-RNase monomeric derivative to produce a C-swapped dimer. the mutants, called HHP2-RNase, exerted a very high antitumor activity against human thyroid carcinoma-derived cell lines and in vivo when malignant cells were transplanted into nude mice. other mutants have been engineered to evade RI, and they exert a relevant cytotoxic activity as well. five-residue mutant (PM5) makes the RNase 1 N-terminal edge identical to BS-RNase displayed a higher stability than the wild type (311) an additional P101Q mutation introduced in this variant allowed RNase 1 to spontaneously dimerize through 3D-DS thanks to the formation of four novel inter-subunits H-bonds. however, the structure of this dimer (303) is quite different from both BS-RNase MM isoform. wt-ONC can penetrate cancer cells because of its high basicity and favorable interaction with the sialic acids moieties present on the malignant cell membranes. many positive results have been registered with monomeric wt-ONC both in vitro and in vivo against several still incurable tumors. ONC has been recently discovered to form a N-swapped dimer upon lyophilization from acetic acid (200) this dimer displayed to be more cytotoxic against pancreatic cancer cells than the native ONC monomer (200). however, some variants built to unlock its C-terminus were found to be less stable than the native enzyme (327, 328) barnase was discovered to form a cyclic domain-swapped trimeric adduct. the wt-RNase T1 is not cytotoxic, being unable to enter the cells if it is not pre-incorporated into a HVJ cell-penetrating envelope vector. barnase was derivatized, either as a monomer or as a dimer, also with immuno-peptides. binase has been subsequently found to exist as a natural dimer (90, 332). the presence of the swapping of the N-terminal domain has been strongly suggested. however, two alternative structural models did not confirm the actual presence of 3D-DS. the oligomerization tendency of, and the products formed by RNase A, BS-RNase, RNase 1 and ONC may suggest a smart future approach to build complex chimera products. the determinants driving a RNase to dimerize or oligomerize depend on several features, including 3D-DS propensity, stability, basic nature of key-residues and geometry of the supramolecular adducts formed."}
