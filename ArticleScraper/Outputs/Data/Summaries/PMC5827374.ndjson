{"summary": "chikungunya, eastern equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are important causes of these outbreaks. encephalomyelitis, a potentially fatal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with frequent long-term neurological deficits in survivors. IL-10 dysregulation has also been implicated in inflammatory disease due to infection with influenza virus and cytomegalovirus (22, 23), as well as in autoimmune diseases (24\u201328). IL-10 dysregulation has also been implicated in inflammatory disease due to infection with influenza virus and cytomegalovirus (22, 23), as well as in autoimmune diseases. expression in the brains and spinal cords of TE12-infected mice increased by day 3. IL-10 deficiency leads to prolonged morbidity and mortality. surviving mice recovered weight more slowly than WT mice. survival was assessed using a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve and log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, P = 0.0356. median days of death were 10 for WT and 11 for IL-10/ mice. IL-10-deficient mice had higher viral RNA levels on days 10 and 14 in brain and on day 10 in spinal cord than WT mice. IL-10-deficient mice had higher viral RNA levels on days 10 and 14 in brain and on day 10 in spinal cord. IL-10/ mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. Flow cytometric analysis of cells isolated from brains and CLNs. WT and IL-10/ B6 mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. Flow cytometric analysis of isolated cells pooled from brains. number (B) and percentage (C) of CD3+ cells in CLNs that were CD4+ T cells. IL-10 deficiency generally increases the representation of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the CNS in response to TE12 infection. levels of Il2 mRNA in IL-10/ mice increased similarly to but were higher than those in WT mice at 7 to 14 days after infection. T and IL-10/ B6 mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. gene CT values were normalized to the GAPDH gene. changes in levels were calculated relative to uninfected mice of the same strain. RT-qPCR was performed on cDNA from brains from IL-10/ and WT mice. Gata3 mRNA was lower in brains of IL-10/ mice than in those of WT mice at all times after infection. levels of Il4 mRNA did not increase in response to infection in either IL-10/ or WT mice. mice at 5 (n = 6), 7 (n = 10), and 10 (n = 10) days postinfection. flow cytometry plots of Th2 cells defined as CD45hi CD3+ CD4+ Gata3+ T cells producing IL-4. flow cytometry plots of ILC2 cells defined as IL-7Ra+ lineage Gata3+. number and percentage of ILC2 cells in brain (B and C) and CLN (D and E) data plotted as mean SEM from 3 independent experiments. gene CT values were normalized to the GAPDH gene. changes in levels were calculated relative to uninfected mice of the same strain (A, C, and E) or to uninfected WT mice (B, D, and F) mice had lower numbers and percentages of Tregs in brains than WT mice. there were similar numbers and percentages of Tregs in CLNs. gene CT values were normalized to the GAPDH gene. IL-10-deficient mice also had lower numbers and percentages of regulatory B cells in both brains and CLNs. fewer, but similar, percentages in CLNs than WT control mice at 10 days after infection. these data suggest that IL-10 is important for development of both T and B regulatory cell populations within the infected CNS. response was delayed in IL-10/ mice compared to WT mice. less SINV-specific IgG in brains and spinal cords at 7 and 10 days after infection. less SINV-specific IgG in brains and spinal cords at 7 and 10 days after infection. IL-10 is upregulated in the CNS after TE12 infection. mRNA expression in the brains and spinal cords of TE12-infected mice increased by day 3, peaked at day 10, and remained above baseline through 21 days postinfection. IL-10 deficiency leads to prolonged morbidity and mortality. IL-10 deficiency leads to prolonged morbidity and increased mortality after TE12 infection. survival was assessed using a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve and log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. median days of death were 10 for WT and 11 for IL-10/ mice. virus titers were determined by plaque assay using brain (A) or spinal cord (B) homogenates prepared from WT (filled squares, solid lines) and IL-10/ (open circles, dashed lines) mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. IL-10 deficiency did not affect the total number of cells in brain (Fig. 4B) or CLN (Fig. 4E) but the numbers (Fig. 4C) and percentages (Fig. 4F) of CD3+ T cells were higher in the brains, but not the CLNs (Fig. 4D and G) of IL-10/ mice. IL-10/ mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. there were no differences in numbers or percentages of CD4+ T cells in CLNs. the data represent the mean SEM from 3 independent experiments. IL-10 deficiency generally increases the representation of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the CNS in response to TE12 infection. levels of Il2 mRNA in IL-10/ mice increased similarly to but were higher than those in WT mice at 7 to 14 days after infection. WT and IL-10/ B6 mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. gene CT values were normalized to the GAPDH gene. data were pooled from three independent experiments. there were no significant differences in numbers or percentages of Th1 cells in the CLNs. RT-qPCR was performed on cDNA from brains from IL-10/ and WT mice. Gata3 mRNA was lower in brains of IL-10/ mice than in those of WT mice at all times after infection. metric analysis of isolated cells pooled from brains of WT (black bars) or IL-10/ (white bars) mice at 5 (n = 6), 7 (n = 10), and 10 (n = 10) days postinfection. flow cytometry plots of Th2 cells defined as CD45hi CD3+ CD4+ Gata3+ T cells producing IL-4. flow cytometry plots of ILC2 cells defined as IL-7Ra+ lineage Gata3+. number and percentage of ILC2 cells in brain (B and C) and CLN (D and E) gene CT values were normalized to the GAPDH gene. changes in levels were calculated relative to uninfected mice of the same strain (A, C, and E) or to uninfected WT mice (B, D, and F) data are pooled from two independent experiments. IL-10/ mice had lower numbers and percentages of Tregs in brains than WT mice on days 7 and 10. there were similar numbers and percentages of Tregs in CLNs. IL-10-deficient mice also had lower numbers and percentages of regulatory B cells in both brains and CLNs. fewer, but similar, percentages in CLNs than WT control mice at 10 days after infection. data suggest IL-10 is important for development of both T and B regulatory cell populations within the infected CNS. IL-10/ mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU TE12. the antibody response was delayed in IL-10/ mice compared to WT mice. less SINV-specific IgM antibody in brains and spinal cords. IL-10 deficiency led to prolonged morbidity, increased weight loss, increased mortality, and delayed viral clearance after TE12 infection. more severe disease in IL-10-deficient mice compared to WT mice was associated with increased numbers of Th1 cells and decreased numbers of Tregs and Bregs. IL-10 deficiency did not affect numbers of Tregs in the CLN. both Th1- and Th17-mediated immunopathology can be regulated by IL-10. regulated T cells decrease Th1 responses by downregulating major histocompatibility complex. a major effect of IL-10 deficiency on TE12 pathogenesis was a reduction in CNS Th2 and B cell responses compared to those in WT mice. a role for early production of CNS antiviral antibody in determining outcome from arboviral encephalitis is recognized for both mice and humans.
