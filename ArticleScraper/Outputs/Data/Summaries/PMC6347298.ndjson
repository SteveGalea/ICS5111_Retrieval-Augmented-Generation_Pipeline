{"summary": "viral fusion is initiated upon interactions between virus surface glycoproteins and cellular receptor(s) and/or upon the reduction in pH that follows endocytosis. hemifusion is manifested as lipid mixing between viral and host membranes without viral content release. full membrane fusion entails mixing of distinct aqueous contents delimited by the two membranes. IFITMs effectively block entry of many unrelated enveloped viruses. mice lacking the ifitm3 gene more readily succumb to IAV and RSV infection than control mice [26, 27] there are viruses resistant to IFITM-mediated restriction. endosome/lysosome-resident protein to the cell surface abolishes antiviral activity against IAV [32]. a relatively weak IAV restriction exhibited by an IFITM1 chimera containing the N-terminal domain of IFITM3 that localizes to late endosomes suggests a role for other factors in addition to appropriate subcellular localization. a recent study provided evidence for the antiviral effect of cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/lysosomes. it thus remains unclear whether IFITMs must be present at the sites of virus fusion to block virus entry or affect fusion indirectly, by dysregulating lipid transport or metabolism. the inability to directly visualize IFITM3 in the context of virus entry into live cells precluded us from assessing whether this factor blocks fusion through a proximity-based mechanism. the coding sequence of EGFP inserted into the N-terminal region of IFITM3 predicted to reside in the cytoplasm [40\u201342] generates a functional protein. first, to verify correct subcellular distribution of the fluorescent construct, we co-expressed IFITM3-iEGFP (iEGFP stands for \u201cinternal\u201d EGFP) with an N-terminally myc-tagged IFITM3 in HeLa cells. EGFP flanked with flexible linkers (GGGSGG) was inserted after residue 40 of IFITM3. cells were transduced with both IFITM3-iEGFP (green) and N-terminally tagged myc-IFITM3 (red) IFITM3-imNG, IFITM3-imTFP1, or 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-IFITM3 and mouse anti-Tubulin antibodies. to facilitate multi-color live cell imaging of IFITM3, we replaced the internal EGFP tag with cyan mTFP1 or bright green mNeonGreen protein. fluorescently labeled IFITM3-containing endosomes are permissive for a lipid mixing stage of influenza virus fusion. lipids can diffuse through a hemifusion intermediate, without opening of a fusion pore. the ability to visualize the distribution of functional fluorescent IFITM3 in living cells enables spatiotemporal analysis of viral fusion restriction. fluorescence traces obtained by single IAV tracking show an increase in SP-DiI18 intensity over time. reference AF647 signal (red) remains relatively constant. time required for complete dequenching (t) and extent of dequenching (ratio of the initial and final mean intensities If/Ii) can be determined. time series images show dequenching of SP-DiI18 on entry of IAV co-labeled with AF647 with an endosome containing IFITM3-imTFP1. lipid mixing events were categorized based on whether they colocalized with IFITM3-imTFP1 puncta (IFITM3+) or occurred in areas devoid of IFITM3-imNG signal (IFITM3-) snapshots of a single IAV show the hemifusion event that occurs within an IFITM3-imNG endosome (IFITM3). the onset of SP-DiI18 dequenching detected at around 32 min. the overall kinetics of onset of lipid mixing was not affected. the slower redistribution of SP-DiI18 to endosomes enriched in IFITM3-imTFP1 is consistent with our previous conclusion that these events represent IAV hemifusion but not full fusion. lipid diffusion through both leaflets of a fusion pore is expected to be faster than diffusion through contacting leaflets of a hemifusion intermediate. time series images show the initial trafficking of a representative mCherry/YFP-Vpr labeled virus until fusion occurs. time series images show the initial trafficking of a representative mCherry/YFP-Vpr labeled virus until fusion occurs. the red arrow around 7 minutes indicates virus entry into an IFITM3+ endosome. the second and third arrows mark subsequent merger of the virus-carrying endosome with additional IFITM3+ vesicles around 10 min and 43 min. time series images show fusion of IAVpp within an IFITM3 expressing cell at a location that does not contain above-threshold amounts of IFITM3-imTFP1. time series images show the IAVpp entering the IFITM3+ compartment. the virus-carrying endosome encounters and merges with another IFITM3+ compartment. analysis of 6309 particles did not reveal a single viral fusion event occurring after extensive IAVpp co-trafficking with an IFITM3+ compartment. an example trace of an IAV pseudovirus shows a brief (40 sec) apparent co-localization with an IFITM3+ compartment at around 23 minutes. fusion occurs at around 31 minutes with no above-background IFITM3-imTFP1 signal. the viral particle appears to transiently colocalize with an IFITM3+ endosome. 3 traps the IAV fusion at a hemifusion stage by blocking the formation of a small fusion pore. conditions that render IFITM3 inactive rescue IAV fusion with IFITM3-imTFP1-enriched endosomes may occur through a direct block of viral fusion by the restriction factor. 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 mutant did not inhibit IAVpp fusion. amphotericin B treatment allows IAVpp fusion with IFITM3-containing endosomes. double-labeled IAVpp were pre-bound to 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells as in (B) single IAVpp fusion efficiency in 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells treated with 1 M AmphoB. single IAVpp fuses with IFITM3+ endosomes in presence of 1 M AmphoB. events occur in IFITM3-imTFP1 cells treated with AmphoB. 7 particles co-traffic and fuse with IFITM3+ compartments. none of the IAVpp fusion events occurred in 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells. we pseudotyped the HIV-1 core containing the bi-functional mCherry-2xCL-YFP-Vpr marker with the LASV GPc envelope glycoprotein complex to generate LASV pseudoparticles (LASVpp) in cells [15], we confirmed the ability to track single particles and detect their fusion (release of mCherry) in late endosomal compartments. YFP-Vpr quenching occurs for most particles not undergoing fusion at later times after infection due to a non-specific acidification of the viral interior in late acidic compartments. the YFP signal is quenched in an acidic endosome, due to viral membrane permeabilization, prior to fusion. lag time between YFP quenching and fusion is 14.1 minutes. the average lag time between YFP quenching and fusion in A549 cells is 14.1 minutes. the lag time between YFP quenching and fusion is 14.1 minutes. LASVpp fusion is a stochastic event that does not depend on virus trafficking history. acidification of the virus interior does not directly report time of acidification of endosomal lumen. GPc retains fusion-competence under acidic conditions for considerable time before it fuses with permissive late endosomes. analysis of >6 independent live cell imaging experiments shows that, on average, LASVpp fuse in A549 Vector and A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells with similar efficiency. data are means and SEM from 3 independent triplicate experiments. LASVpp fusion appears to occur in an endosome containing detectable IFITM3-imTFP1 signal. representative images and fluorescence traces show co-trafficking of a LASV particle within an IFITM3+ endosome until fusion occurs around 14 min post-infection. cells were incubated in the cold for 1.5 hr with IAVpp or LASVpp labeled with HIV-1 Gag-mCherry. cells were then incubated for indicated times (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) at 37\u00b0C, fixed and imaged at high spatial resolution. representative images of IAVpp and LASVpp co-localize with IFITM3-imNG containing vesicles. IFITM3 incorporation into the viral membrane inhibits fusion mediated by both IFITM3-sentitive and\u2013resistant viral glycoproteins. blots were probed with anti-IFITM3, anti-p24, and anti-influenza HA antibodies. IAVpp containing BlaM-Vpr and lacking or containing IFITM3 were used to infect A549 cells and the resulting viral fusion measured by the BlaM assay. data are means and SEM based on three experiments performed in triplicate. IFITM3-containing extracellular vesicles were effectively concentrated by our virus concentration protocol using LentiX. the presence of IFITM3-containig extracellular vesicles did not modulate the fusion activity of IAVpp. the presence of IFITM3 is sufficient to restrict IAV fusion. IFTIMs expressed in target cells are not inherently resistant to IFITM restriction. the reason LASV is insensitive to IFITM3 expression is through its usage of trafficking pathways that are distinct from those used by IFITM3. the fluorescent construct was co-expressed with an N-terminally myc-tagged IFITM3. cells expressing intermediate to high levels of IFITM3-iEGFP did not stain for HA antigen. EGFP flanked with flexible linkers (GGGSGG) was inserted. cells were fixed, permeabilized, immunostained with anti-myc tag antibody. fusion was initiated by shifting to 37\u00b0C and incubating for 2 hr. lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-IFITM3 and mouse anti-Tubulin antibodies. IFITM3-imNG and IFITM3-imTFP1 proteins were expressed in h at 37\u00b0C based on the resulting cytosolic BlaM activity [43, 44] compared to the Vector control, IFITM3 severely restricts IAVpp fusion, as shown previously [30]. single-virus hemifusion can be detected by the appearance of bright SP-DiI18 spots resulting from dilution of this dye within an endosomal membrane. double-labeled IAV were incubated with cells at 4\u00b0C for 20 min, followed by the addition of pre-warmed Live Cell Imaging Buffer (LCIB) time series images show dequenching of SP-DiI18 on entry of IAV with an endosome containing IFITM3-imTFP1. lipid mixing events were categorized based on whether they colocalized with IFITM3-imTFP1 puncta (IFITM3+) or occurred in areas devoid of IFITM3-imNG signal (IFITM3+) fluorescent IFITM3 primarily localized to endosomes that exhibited retrograde and anterograde movement in living cells. the overall kinetics of onset of lipid mixing was not affected by IFITM3 expression. the extent of SP-DiI18 dequenching was independent of virus colocalization with IFITM3-imNG endosomes at the time of lipid mixing. this result indicates that the average size of recipient endosomes is the same in control and IFITM3-expressing cells. however, the SP-DiI18 dequenching time (t) was significantly longer in IFITM3+ endosomes compared to Vector cells. mCherry/YFP-Vpr fusion is detected based upon the release of mCherry into the cytoplasm through a fusion pore. the YFP-Vpr marker remains in the viral core. time series images show the initial trafficking of a representative mCherry/YFP-Vpr labeled virus. time-lapse imaging was performed using IAVpp co-labeled with mCherry-2xCL-YFP-Vpr in A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells. the red arrow around 7 minutes indicates virus entry into an IFITM3+ endosome and the second and third arrows mark subsequent merger of the virus-carrying endosome. 3D trajectories of IAVpp and an endosome shown in panel G confirm that, prior to fusion, the virus-carrying endosome only transiently encounters the IFITM3+ endosome (blue). Neither before (dark yellow trace) nor after fusion (green trace) of the particle co-trafficking with the IFITM3+ endosome was observed. we hypothesized that a sufficiently high local IFITM3 concentration is required for analysis of 6309 particles did not reveal a single viral fusion event occurring after extensive IAVpp co-trafficking with an IFITM3+ compartment. fusion occurs at around 31 minutes with no above-background IFITM3-imTFP1 signal. at least 15 independent experiments show that 2.2% of IAVpp fuse in Vector cells. none of the 6309 analyzed particles in IFITM3+ endosomes underwent fusion. the presence of IFITM3 in the endosomes carrying the virus is key to restriction of IAV fusion. amphotericin B treatment is known to antagonize the antiviral activity of IFITM3. the 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 mutant did not inhibit IAVpp fusion. time-lapse images show the viral particle entering an IFITM3+ compartment around 35 minutes and co-trafficking with IFITM3-imTFP1 until fusion occurs around 43 minutes. double-labeled IAVpp were pre-bound to 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells as in (B) single IAVpp fuses with IFITM3+ endosomes in presence of 1 M AmphoB. of the 23 total fusion events that occur in IFITM3-imTFP1 cells treated with AmphoB, 7 particles co-traffic and fuse with IFITM3+ compartments. this is in contrast to amphoB, which renders wild-type IFITM3-imTFP1 inactive without its trafficking pathways. LASV fusion in A549 cells proceeds through a viral membrane permeabilization step. we pseudotyped the HIV-1 core containing the bi-functional mCherry-2xCL-YFP-Vpr marker with the LASV GPc envelope glycoprotein complex to generate LASV pseudoparticles (LASVpp) Interestingly, LASVpp fusion exhibited a unique feature rarely seen for other viruses, including IAV. mCherry signal is lost without acidification of the virus interior (YFP quenching) in A549 cells, only 9% of LASVpp fusion events are Type I. most particles\u201491%\u2014undergo Type II fusion (Fig 5D) the effect of ST-193 (10 M) on LASVpp fusion was tested using the BlaM assay in A549 Vector cells. in control wells, infection was performed in the presence of 40 mM NH4Cl. yFP-Vpr quenching and fusion in a549 cells is 14.1 minutes. lag between quenching and fusion does not appear to be correlated with the waiting time for quenching. lag between quenching and fusion does not appear to be correlated with the waiting time for quenching (R2 = 0.0263) LASVpp labeled with mCherry-2xCL-YFP-Vpr allowed to enter and fuse with a549-IFITM3-imTFP1-containing vesicle. analysis of >6 independent live cell imaging experiments showed that, on average, LASVpp fuse in A549 Vector and A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells. 1.64% and 1.87% of double-labeled LASVpp particles bound to cells fused in control and A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells. the kinetics of LASVpp fusion in control and A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells were not significantly different. in one or two rare examples, LASVpp fusion appears to occur in an endosome containing detectable IFITM3-imTFP1 signal. IAV but not LASV particles colocalize with IFITM3-containing vesicles. cells were incubated in the cold for 1.5 hr with IAVpp or LASVpp labeled with an internal fluorescent marker, Gag-mCherry. cells were then incubated for indicated times (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) at 37\u00b0C. ted in the cold for 1.5 hr with particles pseudotyped with IAV HA/NA or LASV GPc and labeled with HIV-1 Gag-mCherry (red) cells were washed to remove unbound viruses, incubated at 37\u00b0C for varied times. Western blot of control and IFITM3-containing IAVpp prepared. blots were probed with anti-IFITM3, anti-p24, and anti-influenza HA antibodies. data are means and SEM based on three experiments performed in triplicate. fusion of IAVpp containing IFITM3 was potently inhibited. compared to control IAVpp, fusion of IAVpp was potently inhibited. this suggests a direct effect of this antibiotic on IFITM3 or the viral membrane that is independent of cellular processes. GPc were brought in contact with 293T cells stably expressing IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 [22] or, in control experiments, with parental 293T cells. this result supports the notion that LASV GPc is not inherently resistant to IFITM restriction. it remains unknown how IFITMs exert their antiviral effects and how arenaviruses and MLV escape restriction. we documented the \u201cavoidance\u201d mechanism of LASVpp escape from IFITM3 restriction through virus trafficking and fusion with endosomes lacking this restriction factor. the presence of IFITM3 at the sites of IAV fusion does not rule out the possibility that the antiviral effect is due to recruitment of downstream effector proteins. we have previously documented unimpeded IAV lipid mixing activity in IFITM3-expressing cells. this finding is in disagreement with the reduced IAV lipid dequenching in IFITM3-expressing cells reported in [39] the reason for discrepant results is likely related to the use of a bulk lipid dequenching assay. hemifusion and the formation of a fusion pore within a hemifusion diaphragm are associated with changes in areas of contacting and distal monolayers. this effect is expected to disfavor the fusion pore opening due to inability to quickly remove excess lipid from the hemifusion site. single virus content (mCherry) release assay would not detect IAVpp fusion with intraluminal vesicles. similar extent of lipid dye dequenching upon single IAV fusion with control and IFITM3-positive endosomes appears compatible with virus hemifusion to the limiting membrane. virions containing IFITMs in their membranes could provide a tractable model for mechanistic studies of these proteins. our study focused on IFITM3 protein, which shares a relatively high sequence homology and subcellular distribution with IFITM2. the published literature supports the notion that this protein also acts by a proximity-based mechanism.

FITM3-imTFP1 cells were seeded onto 35 mm collagen-coated glass-bottom Petri dishes. cells were seeded as above and incubated with 30 nM LysoTrackerTM Red DND-99 (ThermoFisher) diluted in pre-warmed LCIB supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin and L-glutamine. three-color viral fusion experiments were done with cells expressing IFITM3-imTFP1 or 2M-imTFP1 using a standard CFP/YFP/Cherry filter set. a TRITC/FITC/Cy-5 filter set was used for the three-color lipid mixing experiments with IFITM3-mNeonGreen expressing cells. the local background was determined by dilating the identified objects corresponding to viral particles by two pixels. the difference between the integrated intensities of the particle and the dilated surrounding gave the intensity surrounding the particle. this was used to obtain the background-corrected intensity of the particle at every time point. IFITM3 expression does not affect the kinetics of IAV hemifusion but can slow down lipid mixing. the waiting times to onset of DiI dequenching were determined by single particle tracking. fluorescence traces of the particle tracked in (A) show the fusion event around 15 min. the particle does not consistently co-traffic with the IFITM3+ endosome prior to fusion. a total of 90, 12, 36, and 23 fusion events were annotated out of 4248, 4133, 2487. the kinetics of IAVpp fusion in IFITM3-imTFP1 cells is slower than in 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 and IFITM3-imTFP1 cells treated with AmphoB. a total of 53 fusion events were annotated in Vector cells from 2931 particles. a total of 15 fusion events occurred in IFITM3-imTFP1 cells from 1683 particles. control and IFITM3 containing IAVpp were prepared as in Fig 8.
