{"summary": "national Taiwan University Hospital is a 2,400-bed teaching hospital that provides primary and tertiary care. the ER is organized into several sections, including triage, examination, observation, critical care, and a clean area reserved for staff activities. the patients were questioned about the presence of fever, myalgia, gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, whether they had close contact with a SARS patient. in the ER, SARS areas were cleaned at least three times. non-SARS areas were cleaned once a day. health insurance records were used to trace prior visits to other hospitals. inpatients who had close contact with SARS patients were quarantined. high-volume air sampler draw air at calibrated sampling rates of 400 L per min for 5 min into a collector with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the collected samples were then frozen at \u201370\u00b0C before RNA extraction. two negative controls (one for RNA extraction and one for RT-PCR) and four quantification standards (1 x 101 copies/L, 1 x 102 copies/L, 1 x 103 copies/L, and 1 x 104 copies/L) data were presented as number of copies per sample. national Taiwan University Hospital is a 2,400-bed teaching hospital. healthcare workers wore N-95 respirators for all patient care in the ER. in the ER, SARS areas were cleaned at least three times; non-SARS areas were cleaned once a day. inpatients who had close contact with SARS patients were quarantined in private rooms. swabs were spread immediately onto 3 mL of viral transport medium. air samples were collected from various objects in different areas of ER. reagents contain a second heterologous amplification system to identify possible PCR inhibition. internal controls included two negative controls and four quantification standards. a median of 6 patients per day (range 0\u201329) were screened at the ER. 232 SARS patients admitted to the national Taiwan University Hospital from march 14 through June 19, 31 (13.4%) did not have a history of travel, exposure to SARS patients, or a hospital visit within 10 days before illness. the only contact history was a stay at the national Taiwan University Hospital ER. the index patient in the first cluster was an afebrile 73-year-old man admitted to the ER because of severe dyspnea. he was kept in the observation unit from April 23 through April 25, 2003. he was thought to have congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease. contact tracing identified a cluster of cases in three patients and two nursing aids. all five cases were diagnosed as probable SARS. no tertiary cases emerged. y artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography. had lower intestinal bleeding secondary to ischemic colitis. had lower intestinal bleeding secondary to ischemic colitis. a 46-year-old, otherwise-healthy woman (patient 8) was admitted with probable SARS. a week earlier she had taken care of her mother (patient 9) in the ER observation unit. this cluster affected six patients, three family members, and five nursing aids. none of 19 air samples tested positive for viral RNA. the highest viral load was obtained from a bedside chair in the observation unit. a median of 6 patients per day (range 0\u201329) were screened at the ER for febrile illnesses. 63 patients were identified as SARS cases and were admitted to national Taiwan University Hospital. 68 SARS patients were transferred to another hospital and 155 received care in a temporarily designated ER area. five patients had disease onset from April 29 through May 1. the second cluster of 14 cases began on May 4. the third cluster of 12 cases began on may 11, 2003. none of the cases occurred in beds 9\u201318, which are separated by a half wall. on autopsy, he was found to have had an acute myocardial infarction. a small ground-glass density in the lung was compatible with viral pneumonitis. contact history and temporal relationships among contacts according to the date of fever for 19 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome. first cluster 2 73/M Infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, old cerebral vascular accident, parkinsonism, hyperthyroidism. Cough for 2 weeks and fever for 1 week and was treated for aspiration pneumonia. 4 62/F Hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis of liver, hypertension, diabetes mellitus. close to acute patient 10 had frequent diarrhea. she helped take care of patient 10. 14 43/F Nursing aid of patient 10 15 24/F Nursing aid of a patient who visited the ER on may 2. six of the healthcare workers who became ill had close contact with SARS patients. six other healthcare workers indicated that they did not have close contact with SARS patients. these workers were four nurses and two cleaners. all personnel who had contact with SARS patients or their environments were reeducated on infection-control measures. follow-up surveillance was conducted on may 25. nine samples were collected from previously contaminated surfaces, 21 samples from other areas in the ER, and 15 samples from SARS wards. six of the cases among the healthcare workers had no direct SARS patient contact. this finding may indicate that the virus can persist in the environment. environmental contamination was first demonstrated during a community outbreak in Hong Kong (13) virus detected by RT-PCR may not have been viable. epidemiologic data suggest that transmission of SARS is mainly through close contact with droplets or secretions. but increasingly epidemiologic evidence shows that the disease may also be transmitted indirectly through contact with hands or objects contaminated with secretions."}
