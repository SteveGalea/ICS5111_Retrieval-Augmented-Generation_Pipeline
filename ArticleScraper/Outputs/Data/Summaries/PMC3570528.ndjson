{"summary": "DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin mainly present at the surface of dendritic cells. they are antigen presenting cells that play a key role in the induction of the adaptive immune responses. they are able to present antigens to T cells and induce their maturation. the new virions are assembled at the cell membrane and NA cleaves sialic acid at the cell membrane to allow the newly synthesized virions to detach from the cell. lectin receptors may recognize the glycans on HA, allow binding of the virus to the cells and its internalization. a limited number of viruses have been investigated. a correlation between the extent of glycosylation of viral envelope proteins and binding to DC-SIGN has been suggested. it is unclear if DC-SIGN mediated entry could support productive infection. MDCK and Vero cells expressing DC-SIGN cells were isolated using CD209 microbeads. DC-SIGN expression was monitored by flow cytometry. subsequently inoculate neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) the viruses, designated GFP-H1 and L194AY195F-GFP-H1 respectively, were used to subsequently inoculate MDCK or MDCK DC-SIGN cells (passage 2 and 3). the culture supernatants of infected MDCK cells were clarified by low speed centrifugation, plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant HA genes were co-transfected into 293T cells with plasmids encoding the remaining gene segments of back-bone strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) here we used A/Netherlands/26/07 and a mutant lacking one glycosylation site A/Netherlands/26/07-125. titration Viruses L194AY195F-GFP-H1 and MDCK and Vero cells were treated with 3.4 u/ml neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae and GolgiStop (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 30 minutes to remove sialic acids from the cell surface. removal of sialic acids was confirmed by flow cytometry. cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (P2F) cells were stained for viability using amCyan-labeled live/dead staining. after washing with P2F, the cells were fixed with 100 l of cytofix. analyzed by flow cytometry using the DIVA \u00ae software. the infection assay experiments were performed in duplicate Dendritic cells Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 3 healthy blood donors were isolated using Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved at 135\u00b0C. blood was obtained from bloodbank Sanquin, region South West Netherlands, Rotterdam. MDCK and Vero cells were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing human DC-SIGN (pcDNA3-DC-SIGN) the next day they were washed and cultured in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml of G148. reverse genetics plasmids containing wildtype (WT) or mutant HA were co-transfected into 293T cells with a plasmid encoding the NA gene segment of which the majority was replaced by the gene encoding Green fluorescent protein (GFP) [30] and plasmids encoding the remaining six gene segments of influenza virus A/PR/8/34. the supernatants were used to subsequently inoculate MDCK or MDCK DC- infectious virus titers were determined as described previously [31]. HA gene segments of the two viruses were cloned into reverse genetics plasmids, [29] by site-directed mutagenesis. plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant HA genes were reciprocally exchanged to produce viruses that gained or lost one or more putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Flow cytometry Viruses L194AY195F-GFP-H1 and GFP-H1 that were passaged 2 or 3 times were used to inoculate MDCK or MDCK DC-SIGN cells at a MOI of 0.01. GFP expression in infected cells was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 and 48 hours post inoculation using a FACS calibur and Cell Quest Pro software. inoculum was aspirated and cells were washed and incubated in culture medium for 16 hours. cells were fixed with 100 l of cytofix (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the viral nucleoprotein. neuraminidase was treated with 3.4 u/ml neuraminidase from vibrio cholerae for 30 minutes to remove sialic acids present at the cell surface. incubated with 5 g of monoclonal antibody to DC-SIGN (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or an IgG2b isotype control (R&D systems, Minneapolis) SIGN was inoculated overnight with influenza viruses A/Netherlands/348/07 and A/Netherlands/312/03 in the presence of 3.4 u/ml neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) culture supernatants of influenza viruses GFP-H1 (A, C, E, G) and L194AY195F-GFP-H1 (B, D, F, H) virus passaged in MDCK and DC-SIGN cells were obtained and used to inoculate virus at a moi of 0.01. no infectious virus was detected after two subsequent passages in these cells. a virus titer of 103.5 TCID50/ml was reached in MDCK cells 72 hours post inoculation. infection monitored by GFP expression Viruses L194AY195F-GFP-H1 and GFP-H1 (passages 2 and 3) were used to inoculate MDCK or MDCK DC-SIGN cells at a MOI of 0.01. the expression of GFP was assessed by flow cytometry at 24 and 48 hours influenza A viruses can infect cells via DC-SIGN in the absence of sialic acid. the normal receptor for influenza A viruses, MDCK and Vero cells were treated with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholera. untreated cells were used as positive controls for inoculation and the infection percentage of these cells were assessed. influenza A/H3N2 viruses A/swine/Iowa/15/30, A/mallard/Netherlands/15/05 and A/PuertoRico/8/34 displayed low infection percentages in MDCK-DC-SIGN cells devoid of sialic acids. differences observed between viruses may be explained by differences in the number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites present on HA. infected cells were incubated with neuraminidase from vibrio cholerae. they were subsequently infected with influenza viruses. the percentage of infected cells compared to the positive control was assessed. the infection rates were reduced in the presence of these antibodies but not in the presence of control antibodies of the same isotype. also in presence of mannose, the entry was blocked, indicating that DC-SIGN was functional and able to bind to mannan. the effect of glycosylation of HA on binding to, and infection of, DC-SIGN expressing cells was assessed. we selected two viruses A/Netherlands/602/09 (H1N1pdm09) and A/Netherlands/26/07 (H1N1) of which modification glycosylation sites on the head of the hemagglutinin were inserted or deleted. the number of glycosylation sites present on HA determines the virus infection rates in DC-SIGN expressing cells. MDCK cells (A) and Vero (B) cells were transfected with the DC-SIGN gene (black bars) or not (white bars) were treated with neuraminidase from vibrio cholerae and GolgiStop for 30 minutes to remove sialic acids from the cell surface. replication kinetics Viruses L194AY195F-GFP-H1 and GFP-H1 (passages 2 and 3) were used to inoculate MDCK or MDCK DC-SIGN cells at a moi of 0.01. culture supernatants were collected at various time points post inoculation. virus L194AY195F-GFP-H1 and virus GFP-H1 were inoculated with influenza viruses GFP-H1 (A) and L194AY195F-GFP-H1 (B) at a MOI of 0.01 (solid lines) no infectious virus was detected after two subsequent passages in these cells. titers that were reached were lower than for virus GFP-H1. infection experiments with GFP-H1 virus passaged in MDCK cells essentially gave the same results as the virus passaged in MDCK DC-SIGN cells. the results confirmed that virus GFP-H1 with a functional HA molecule was able to infect MDCK and MDCK DC-SIGN cells regardless of the cell line that was used to produce this virus. all nine viruses that were tested were able to infect MDCK, MDCK DC-SIGN, Vero and vero DC-SIGN cells in the presence of sialic acids. the infection percentages relative to the untreated positive controls dropped considerably for most viruses. the mean relative number of infected cells was 13.6 and 2.0% for vero cells and MDCK cells respectively. MDCK (A and C) and Vero cells (B and D) transfected with the DC-SIGN gene (black bars) or not (white bars) were treated with neuraminidase from vibrio cholerae and GolgiStop for 30 minutes to remove sialic acids from the cell surface. these cells were subsequently inoculated with five different A/H1N1 viruses (A and B) and four A/H3N2 viruses (C and ND ND PuertoRico/8/34 1 6 4 5 USSR/90/77 4 6 3 5 NL/364/06 4 5 4 5 swine/oedenrode/7C/96 4 6 3 4 NL/35/93 2 5 1 4 NL/312/03 7 4 6 4 NL/348/07 7 4 5 3 The software NetNGlyc predicts the number of glycosylation sites that will be utilized. DC-SIGN expression on DC supports replication of influenza virus in absence of sialic acids. d between 6 and 23% of those of untreated DC, depending on virus and blood donor tested. Influenza A virus A/Netherlands/602/09 showed a low infection percentage in MDCK DC-SIGN (13.7%+/0.2%) and Vero DC-SIGN cells (11.5%+/0.3%). insertion of three glycosylation sites in HA of A/Netherlands/602/09 increased infection percentages of DC-SIGN expressing cells considerably compared to wild type virus. the positive control (untreated cells still possessing sialic acid) was assessed after detecting infected cells using a FITC-labeled antibody to the viral nucleoprotein and flow-cytometry. the expression of DC-SIGN facilitates infection of cells by influenza A viruses independent of sialic acids, the natural receptor for these viruses. neuraminidase removed the natural receptor for influenza A viruses from MDCK and Vero cells by treatment with neuraminidase. neuraminidase assessed the effect of DC-SIGN expression on infection rates of nine different influenza A viruses of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. the presence of DC-SIGN mediated virus entry and infection. a large panel of viruses and isogenic viruses have mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites only. this could be explained by poor utilization of putative N-linked glycosylation sites in HA of the virus used, preventing binding to DC-SIGN. however, little infection was observed after sialidase treatment of the cells. increased susceptibility to infection of DC may further blunt infection by heavily glycosylated influenza A viruses. further research is required to relate the extent of DC-SIGN mediated infection of DC to the magnitude of the immune response to infection, the virus specific T cell response."}
