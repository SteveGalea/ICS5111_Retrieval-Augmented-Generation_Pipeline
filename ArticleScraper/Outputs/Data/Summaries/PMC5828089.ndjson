{"summary": "clinically normal Holstein-Friesian and Jersey breed bull calves were group housed in 4 pens using factorial design with calves of different breeds and planes of nutrition in each pen. BRSV was the only pathogen which demonstrated clustering by pen. BVDV S/P ratios at d 14 were significantly correlated with increased changes in serological responses to BHV-4 over the peri-weaning period. BRSV would appear to play a more significant role at the \u2018group\u2019 rather than \u2018individual animal\u2019 level."}
