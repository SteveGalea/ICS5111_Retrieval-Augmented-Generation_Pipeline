{"summary": "most of these infections are due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Griffiths et al., 2017), influenza virus (IV) (Antonova et al., 2012), and rhinovirus (RV) (Principi et al., 2014), but parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV) (Esposito et al., 2016b), human metapneumovirus (hMP methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions have been developed over the course of many years. cell cultures, immunofluorescence assays, and rapid antigen direct tests were mainly used for virus identification due to the higher frequency of viral RTIs. none of these tests were considered completely satisfactory for clinical use. some of these multiplex platforms have been marketed and largely evaluated in clinical practice in patients admitted to emergency departments, hospital wards and intensive care units. despite these evaluations, the actual role of these diagnostic measures is not precisely defined. it has not yet been established whether the availability of a laboratory measure able to identify several potential etiologic agents of a respiratory infection offers real advantages. multiplex assays are significantly more sensitive and specific compared with rapid immunochromatographic tests and immunofluorescence assays. however, as multiplex assays detect both viable and non-viable viruses and bacteria, they can lead to debatable results. the only exception was adenovirus, for which the AUROC was 0.89. the worst accuracy was found for hMPV, for which the hMPV was oversensitive for several other viruses. sensitivity of TaqMan Array Card was 54, 56, and 75% for ADV, PIV-1 and2, respectively, and 82\u201395% for the other tested viruses. assay specificity was 99%, and coefficients of variation for virus controls ranged from 1.5 to 4.5%. RV is the virus that is most frequently found in asymptomatic children. despite the capacity to cause upper and lower RTIs and to trigger asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. long-term viral shedding after a previous infection can further render the results of multiplex platforms poorly effective in identifying the etiology of a disease. there are significant differences in long-term shedding among the various infectious agents. shedding typically peaks on day 1 after the onset of symptoms. the persistence of Mp DNA in the throat is common, with a median carriage time of 7 weeks after the disease onset (range 2 days7 months) atypical bacteria can be detected for months, as this pathogen temporarily interrupts its replication cycle when exposed to antimicrobials but later resumes replication. viruses can be detected during the incubation period without playing any role in the determination of the actual disease. multiplex platforms do not offer any advantage in comparison to traditional diagnostic tests. the benefits of determining which infectious agent is (are) potentially responsible for an RTI are strongly limited by the low number of drugs that are active against the respiratory targets that are currently available on these diagnostic platforms. antibiotics that are effective in vitro against atypical bacteria are generally recommended and largely used when these pathogens are the suspected cause of an RTI. in children, only macrolides can be used against Mp and Cp, as other drugs that are effective against atypical bacteria cannot be prescribed to these patients. cidofovir, a drug licensed for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in HIV-infected subjects, has been used to treat ADV infections in immunocompromised subjects. retrospective evaluation including 16 children showed that in 10/16 cases, viral clearance and clinical response were achieved. but four patients expired despite the viral clearance, and one of these deaths was directly ascribed to the ADV infection. the availability of results within 12\u201336 h did not lead to any advantage in terms of hospital admissions, length of hospital stay or the duration of antibiotic use when antibiotic treatment had been initiated. a more recent retrospective study in which a multiplex assay was tested in children admitted to the emergency department prior to admission or within the first 2 days of hospitalization revealed that patients for whom the results were available were less likely to receive antibiotics for 2 days. no effect on the length of the visit or blood or urine testing was demonstrated. the difference between tested and untested children was not significant. the rapid test for a single virus is the rapid test for influenza. no studies have evaluated the impact of multiplex platforms on the expectations of patient and parents. the diagnosis of a viral disease by a laboratory test can be interpreted as a simplification of a more complex clinical problem. no specific therapies are available for RSV, and only supportive measures are prescribed. author Contributions SE wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
