{"summary": "stage III zoonotic pathogens produce only stuttering chains of person-to-person transmission that terminate [1]. some stage III zoonotic pathogens with a high fatality rate have a high human fatality rate. effective surveillance for pandemic threats would permit early identification of potentially pandemic strains, monitor the change in viral transmissibility between humans. in several outbreaks people who came in direct contact with secretions of Nipah cases also became infected through person-to-person transmission. in 2006, the institute of epidemiology, disease control and research (IEDCR) of the government of Bangladesh introduced year-round surveillance focused on identification of encephalitis clusters in 10 government hospitals. the objective was to identify encephalitis outbreaks including NiV at an early stage, to understand the risk factors and transmission pathways. surveillance physicians in the remaining six active sites reported clusters as soon as they were identified and the total number of encephalitis cases admitted monthly. surveillance physicians listed admitted patients in paediatric and adult medicine wards with suspected meningo-encephalitis, defined as fever. the team identified family members, relatives, neighbours, friends and colleagues as proxy respondents for the dead or severely ill cases who were unable to respond. the team also asked the cases and/or their family members, relatives, neighbours, friends and colleagues to identify if there were other persons with fever and altered mental status or convulsion. case-based surveillance During the NiV transmission season (January\u2013March) we collected blood and CSF of all listed meningo-encephalitis cases from Faridpur and Rajshahi Medical College Hospitals from 2007 and from Rangpur Medical College Hospital from 2008. these three tertiary hospitals were chosen for case-based surveillance because large numbers of Nipah cases had been identified previously from the catchment areas. the total outbreak size (A) can be expressed by the following geometric progression: A = 1 + R + R2 + R3 +..., where 1 is the primary case. if R = 09, the total outbreak size will be 10 (one primary case and nine is the summation of secondary, tertiary, etc. generation cases) tertiary and seven district-level government hospitals in northwest and central Bangladesh were converted to passive surveillance sites because few encephalitis patients were admitted to those hospitals. if physicians identified an admitted meningo-encephalitis case with 1 sick persons with similar symptoms reported in his/her community, they considered that case as. icddr,b and icddr,b visited cases in hospitals and/or communities to determine the cluster size and collect detailed epidemiological exposures using a standard questionnaire. the team identified family members, relatives, neighbours, friends and colleagues as proxy respondents for the dead or severely ill cases who were unable to respond. IEDCR and icddr,b have tested specimens using a Nipah-specific IgM ELISA. CDC retested all positive samples and every tenth negative sample for quality control. the cut-off of 3 weeks was chosen by adding the incubation period of NiV (1\u201310 days) and period of transmissibility (6\u201311 days) if physicians identified an admitted meningo-encephalitis case with 1 sick persons with similar symptoms reported in his/her community, they considered that case as part of a cluster. IEDCR and icddr,b have tested specimens using a Nipah-specific IgM ELISA provided by CDC. since 2007, specimens were shipped to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. isolated Nipah case was a meningo-encephalitis case with detectable serum Nipah IgM antibody but was not part of a cluster. we categorized the clusters based on cluster size and calculated the proportion of clusters where Nipah cases were identified. one primary Nipah case will produce R secondary cases in the first generation. we calculated and compared proportions of NiV yield by both cluster surveillance and case-based surveillance. for case-based surveillance, we calculated NiV yield as sporadic Nipah cases presenting to hospitals in clusters plus Nipah cases identified in the communities. in 10 (17%) of 62 identified clusters, we identified 62 Nipah cases. of these, 32 Nipah cases presented at hospitals in clusters. twenty-eight were laboratory-confirmed Nipah cases and 34 were probable cases. the estimated R0 for the four NiV clusters with person-to-person transmission ranged from 075 to 088. one cluster of five cases, which included two deaths, was not caused by NiV and remains undiagnosed. surveillance physicians listed 5887 encephalitis cases in 10 surveillance hospitals. a total of 176 (3%) cases were included in these 62 clusters. 147 were identified in hospitals while 29 were identified from communities. median age of the clustered cases was 21 years; 120 (68%) cases were male. twenty-eight (78%) clusters were two-case clusters, six (10%) were three-case clusters and the remaining eight (12%) clusters had 4\u201320 cases. none of the three-case clusters had any epidemiological linkages or NiV infection among cases. the estimated R0 for the four NiV clusters with person-to-person transmission ranged from 075 to 088. one cluster of five cases, which included two deaths, was not caused by NiV and remains undiagnosed. ninety-seven per cent of the listed encephalitis cases were excluded from specimen testing for stage III zoonotic pathogens. cluster-based surveillance allowed cluster-based surveillance to distinguish clusters with epidemiological linkages from clusters without epidemiological linkages. community-level cluster investigations and in-depth assessment of exposures help us to identify host risk behaviours associated with increased person-to-person transmission. 114 non-Nipah cases were in three categories: first, 107 non-Nipah cases from 49 non-Nipah clusters that had no epidemiological linkages between each other. aetiological diagnosis is not performed as part of clinical evaluation of encephalitis cases. cost for aetiological diagnosis of stage III pathogens is high and may make surveillance prohibitively expensive in low-resource settings. lack of epidemiological information may limit the opportunity for targeted case-based surveillance. this is another inherent limitation of a cluster-based approach for infections with a high case-fatality rate like NiV because of the time lag between when initial cases are hospitalized. delays between recognition of a cluster and deployment of a field investigation team limit our capability to diagnose the early cases of NiV in a cluster."}
