{"summary": "mouse models that express hDPP4 are susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV. mice exhibit lower respiratory tract infection, weight loss, and increased respiratory rate, but also encephalitis, which makes the strains highly lethal. antiviral cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-12, p40, IL-1-, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-) and chemokines (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [IP-10], interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10], CXC motif ligand 1 [CXCL-1], macrophage rhesus macaques display mild-to-moderate clinical signs on viral challenge. common marmoset is reported to exhibit more severe signs of infection. but not all research groups have been able to replicate severe disease outcomes in marmosets. factors contributing to this include variations in physical location, age, and origin of the marmosets. researchers have been actively working to understand MERS-CoV genetics to inform vaccine and therapeutic development efforts. they quickly demonstrated that the spike (S) protein was essential for recognition of hDPP4 and viral entry into cells. nanoparticles formed with MERS-CoV S protein have been shown to induce virus neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in mice after a single injection. adenovirus (41,42), modified vaccinia Ankara (43,44) and measles virus (45) are also under development by different groups. adenovirus (41,42), modified vaccinia Ankara (43,44) and measles virus (45) are also under development. geneOne (Blue Bell, PA, USA) is developing a proprietary, full-length S protein DNA vaccine candidate that has been shown to induce NAbs and functional T-cell responses in humans. a full-length S protein DNA vaccine, followed by an S-protein boost, can increase NAb titers and reduce the clinical severity of MERS. peptides could be used alone or in combination with NAbs to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infection. further characterization of these technologies and the potential for combination approaches are ongoing as investigators tackle questions related to viral escape (58,59). vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis. pulmonary immunopathologic features, on challenge with SARS-CoV, were associated with Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration. new norms and standards are under development by the world health organization. public health messages from the workshop included: 1. Accelerating the development of a vaccine requires a better understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis in humans and animals. a combination of both rodents and nonhuman primate models should be considered in evaluating and developing preventive and therapeutic candidates under standardized conditions. the Saudi Arabia MOH has a crucial role to play in defining the public health goals that will guide vaccine development efforts. the field recognizes the need for cooperation and have resolved to formalize a collaborative model."}
