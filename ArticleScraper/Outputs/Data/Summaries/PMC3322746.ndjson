{"summary": "as of may 14, 2003, a total of 24 patients died of SARS in canada. of the 24 patients, autopsies were performed on 11 patients. results of ante- and postmortem examination for routine bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens were negative (6). RT-PCR Lung tissue samples were thawed and immediately homogenized in lysis buffer (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Canada) the homogenate was passed through QIAshredder columns (QIAGEN) before RNA isolation by using the RNeasy Mini Kit. the sample was eluted in 30 L of RNAse free water. PCR inhibition exclusively, if added to the extracted RNA, or RNA isolation quality as well as PCR inhibition, if added during the RNA isolation procedure. 25 randomly chosen amplicons from our sample pool were independently sequenced to confirm SARS-CoV\u2013specific amplification and detection. 13 postmortem lung samples from 7 patients who died during the SARS outbreak were included in this analysis. a 46-year-old woman died of invasive group A streptococcal infection; a 93-year-old man died of congestive heart failure; a 37-year-old man died of sudden death cardiovascular disease; a 74-year-old man died of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity; a 78-year-old woman died of dementia and aspir the HPA-Coronavirus Master Mix contains reagents and enzymes for the specific amplification of an 80-bp region of the SARS-CoV polymerase gene from 5 L of RNA with primer pairs published by the Bernhard-Nocht Institute (Hamburg, Germany) the standards were treated as previously purified samples, and the same 5-L volume was added per capillary. realArt HPA-Coronavirus lightCycler reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay results. PCR results from 5 L RNA are displayed in channel F1/F2 of the lightCycler instrument (A) six of the 11 patients had underlying coexisting conditions, the most common of which was diabetes mellitus. 0 Lung Positive 6.4 x 108 M/76 Type II DM, CAD, HTN 11 4 6 (started on day 6 of illness) 0 Lung Positive 3.8 x 109 F/78 Type II DM, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 8 5 >5 (started on day 4 of illness) 0 RT lung Positive 1.0 x 109 LUL Positive 9.4 x 107 M/62 Rectal cancer LT lung Positive 2.7 x 104 Lung Positive 2.1 x 105 aSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; coV, coronavirus; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; F, female; M, male; DM, diabetes mellitus; HTN, hypertension; CAD, coronary artery disease; RT, left upper lobe; RT, left lower lobe; N/A, not available; DNI, \u201cDo not the use of steroids was not significantly associated with viral load levels. 25 randomly selected amplicons from the sample pool were sequenced to assess specificity and possible cross-reactivity to other pathogens. virus in multiple lung lobes, often in high copy number, at the time of death supports the role of viral replication as a contributor to death. the failure to eradicate SARS-CoV despite ribavirin therapy and the lack of association between the use of ribavirin and viral load are consistent with in vitro data showing that ribavirin has no activity against this agent (9). psies from clearly defined patient populations overcame confounding issues. lung samples have perhaps the highest viral titers of all specimen types. obtaining routine lung biopsies is not practical."}
