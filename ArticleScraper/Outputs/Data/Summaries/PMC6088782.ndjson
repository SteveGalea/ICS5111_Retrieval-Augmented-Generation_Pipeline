{"summary": "METHODS Study Design Data on contacts occurred 1 m distance between patients and staff in the busy ED of a large urban hospital. the ED has 25,000 square feet and 31 beds, with annual census exceeding 57,000. we assumed a susceptible\u2013infected (SI) model with the probability of infection following an exponential distribution such that the probability of an infection in 1 minute was 0.007. patients were classified according to arrival mode (ie, by emergency medical services [EMS] or not), chief complaint as categorized by the ESSENCE criteria. study design data on contacts occurred 1 m distance between patients and staff in the busy ED of a large urban hospital. the ED has 25,000 square feet and 31 beds, with annual census exceeding 57,000, of whom more than 14,000 patients are admitted. we assumed a susceptible\u2013infected (SI) model with the probability of infection following an exponential distribution such that the probability of an infection in 1 minute was 0.007. patients were classified according to arrival mode (ie, by emergency medical services [EMS] or not), chief complaint as categorized by the ESSENCE criteria. RESULTS In the 6-month observation period, we made 1,263 observations of 85 distinct HCWs. overall, 45,877 contacts were observed. the statistics are also provided for each type of contact. an infectious provider was more likely to infect a patient (1.3 EIs) or another provider (1.1 EIs) compared to nurses (0.8 EIs) or other staff (0.4 EIs) in comparison, infectious nurses and staff were more likely to infect cohorts than providers (2.6 nurse-to-nurse EIs vs 6.5 staff-to-staff EIs) EMS patients (0.12 vs 0.23), non-EMS patients (0.09 vs 0.30), caregiver (0.14 vs 0.28), provider (0.57 vs 0.87), or staff (0.57 vs 0.28). DISCUSSION This study is the first direct observation of contacts among patients and staff in the hospital ED environment. study incorporated only 1 infection rate based on a case study of influenza transmission. in this simulation, we incorporated only 1 infection rate based on a case study of influenza transmission. 0.1 EIs for patients admitted to the hospital seems small on a per-shift basis. this would result in 11 patients admitted over the course of an 8-week local outbreak of seasonal influenza. risk of cross infection is greatest between non-EMS patients and staff. the time spent at the end of the visit is much less because there is no need for HCW involvement in discharge activities. patients arriving with respiratory infection do not appear to differ substantially in rates of infection of other ED occupants. our findings reinforce the importance of mandatory vaccination policies for HCWs. click here to view supplementary material.9MB, docx."}
