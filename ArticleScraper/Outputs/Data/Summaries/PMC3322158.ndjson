{"summary": "HCMV initiates infection through a non-specific, low-avidity interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. higher avidity receptors, such as 2-microglobulin [3], HLA-B27 [4], annexin II [5], CD13 [6], [7], EGFR [8] or integrins [9] have been shown to promote stable attachment but to varying degrees. endocytosis is a process by which a cell engulfs molecules that cannot pass through the plasma membrane. most of them involve the uptake of fluid, solutes and small particles. the steps of HCMV internalization have only been partially elucidated. wild-type TR strain enters epithelial and endothelial cells by endocytosis. a virus produced in epithelial cells will preferentially enter target RPE cells via fusion to the plasma membrane. virion generated in fibroblasts will enter by endocytosis [19] the entry pathway was shown to participate to the transmission of the virus from DCs to target cell also known as trans-infection. human cells used in this study were prepared from healthy human volunteers. monocytes derived-macrophages were obtained from monocytes cultured during 5 days with 10ng/ml GM-CSF. human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were propagated in DMEM-10% fetal calf serum with 2 mM L-glutamine media. FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD107b (LAMP2) and EEA1 were obtained from Pharmingen and Transduction Laboratories. the unconjugated anti-HCMV glycoprotein B antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) the endotheliotropic human HCMV strain VHL/E was used in this study and other published works. the quality of the viral stocks was assessed by negative contrast transmission electron microscopy (Figure S1). Usually intact enveloped virions accounted for more than 60\u201370% of physical particles after purification. DNA Etraction and Qantitative Ral-time PCR Viral DNA was extracted using the Nucleospin\u00ae RNA virus kit. coverslips were washed and post-fixed in 1% w/v osmium tetroxide for one hour at 4\u00b0C then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in an Epon resin mixture. cells were labeled with antibodies as listed above and mounted in Fluoromounting Medium (Dako) thin sections (60 to 70 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome. the contrasted sections were double-stained using uranyl acetate and lead citrate. the presence of antigen was visualized by staining with aminoethyl carbazole (AEC; Argene Biosoft) for 15 minutes. the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma) and mounted with glycerol/gelatin (Sigma) Specimens incubated with isotypic antibodies (Dako) were used as negative controls. the analyses were performed at 20-fold magnification on four distinct fields situated 100 m apart. three fractions pooled and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (130,000 g for one hour) top three fractions pooled and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (130,000 g for one hour) frozen at 80\u00b0C until use or instantly analyzed with western blot. cells were infected with HCMV (MOI=2) for two hours. cells were then co-cultured in close contact with fibroblast monolayer. fibroblasts were processed and labeled as described above. CD14+ cells (95% pure) were seeded at 1 106 cells per ml in RPMI 1640-10% fetal calf serum with 2 mM glutamine supplemented with 100 ng/ml rhGM-CSF (Gentaur, Paris, France) and 20 ng/ml rhIL-4 (Cellgenix, Freiburg, Germany) and were cultured for five to seven days. DMSO, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride hydrochloride (DMA), cytochalasin D, bafilomycin A1, chlorpromazine, filipin, nystatin, methyl-cyclodextrin, ammonium chloride, rottlerin and G\u00f66983 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) conjugated antibodies against CD14, CD1a, HLA-DR virions were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. pellet was then ultracentrifuged for 45 minutes at 80,000 g. virions were washed and pelleted by an additional ultracentrifugation step. cells were infected with HCMV (MOI=2) or recombinant HCMV gB (2 g/ml) for various periods of time. cells were washed three times in PBS and were allowed to settle for at least 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed with a glycine-based acidic buffer (0.2 M, pH=2,8) immediately after the incubation step with HCMV. cells were washed and post-fixed in 1% w/v osmium tetroxide for one hour at 4\u00b0C then were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in an Epon resin mixture. thin sections (60 to 70 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome and were double-stained using uranyl acetate and lead citrate. a goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako) was applied for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. after each step, the slides were washed twice in PBS for five minutes. the presence of antigen was visualized by staining with aminoethyl carbazole. postnuclear supernatant (PN) was prepared by centrifugation (1,000 g for ten minutes) and was loaded on top of a 10% Percoll solution in homogenization buffer. top three fractions pooled and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (130,000 g for one hour) mAbs against human EEA1, LAMP-2 and HCMV gB were purchased from Abcam. a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce) was used for protein detection. cells were infected with HCMV (MOI=2) for two hours. the kinetics of MDDC infection allowed us to quantify that 70% of the HCMV virions were located in yet unknown vacuoles inside the cells. 30% of the virions were still bound to the plasma membrane. by six hours post-infection, all of the virions detected were localized inside the cells. HCMV internalization into large uncoated vesicles in MDDCs is an active process that requires actin cytoskeleton polymerization. cells were extensively washed with PBS after incubation with HCMV. the results are representative of two distinct experiments. four distinct fields were digitalized and analyzed with ImageJ software to determine the percentage of I.E.A./E.A.+ MDDCs. n=6 independent experiments with eight different donors in total. cells were then fixed/permeabilized and immunostained as indicated above each column with anti-EEA1 or -LAMP2 antibodies (green) and with an anti-HCMV gB (red) images were obtained on a 510 LSM Meta (Zeiss, Germany) both viral antigens were found at the expected molecular weight (153 kDa MCP and 160 kDa gB) only in the early and late endosome-containing fraction. the PN fraction (7 ml) has to be 25- to 35-fold concentrated. MV particles do infect MDDCs we carefully analyzed ultrathin sections of MDDCs inoculated for six hours with VHL/E particles. thus, in a substantial number of cells we simultaneously observed a vast majority of intact virions within vesicles and structures resembling to uncoated capsids in the cytosol. HCMV particles are sequestered into early endosomes as intact virions. the pH of the LAMP2-positive endosomes did not significantly impair the staining of HCMV gB (no epitope damage) at least for short time periods (up to 30 minutes, data not shown) when we analyzed MDDCs by TEM, we observed intact particles embedded in vesicles with low-density contents. amiloride (100 M) and G6983 (13 nM) significantly reduced the infection rate in a dose-dependent manner. TEM analysis of amiloride-treated MDDCs showed that all particles but one were docked at the plasma membrane. chlorpromazine, a clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitor, had no effect on the infection rate. cells were extensively washed then subcultured for 48 hours. the cells were then prepared and analyzed as described in the legend for Figure 1D. methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD), a methylated cyclic oligosaccharide, is able to solubilize cholesterol and remove it from the plasma membrane. cells were then cultured with HCMV for two hours and the infection rate was calculated. filipin and nystatin, both complex with cholesterol in lipid rafts but do not extract it, inhibited HCMV infection in these cells. infection of MDDCs with HCMV does not depend on endosomal acidification. in some cases, a low pH is not sufficient to induce fusion between the viral envelope and the endocytic vesicle membrane. we pretreated immature MDDCs with ammonium chloride buffer. quantification of HCMV particles outside and inside the bafilomycin-A1-treated MDDCs revealed no difference. results strongly suggest endosomal acidification is not necessary for the entry of HCMV into MDDCs and the infection of these cells. HCMV virions sequestered in the endosomes of MDDCs were protected from degradation. however, we were unable to recover viral particles without inducing irreversible damage to the particles. after the low-pH washes, monocytes were not able to infect HFFs. this suggests that endosomal acidification may lead to the degradation of viral particles in infected macrophages. results confirm that infected MDDCs likely transmit HCMV particles through close contacts between membrane-bound virions and the plasma membrane of target cells as the primary mechanism of trans-infection. n= 4 independent experiments with four different donors in total. HCMV Internalization by MDDCs is Dependent on Cytoskeleton Remodeling. cells were stained for HCMV IE/E nuclear antigens and counterstained with hematoxylin to allow total cell counting. infection of MDDCs by HCMV was significantly impaired as compared to DMSO-treated (vehicle) or non-treated cells. cells were extensively washed with PBS after incubation with HCMV. cells were coated onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides, fixed and permeabilized with acetone and stained with mAbs against anti-IE and \u2013E antigens. internalized HCMV virions partially colocalize with EEA1 and not with LAMP2. we were unable to observe colocalization between HCMV and the LAMP2 staining at any time points. enriched fractions were concentrated before being used in a western blot analysis using anti-EEA1, LAMP-2, HCMV gB and MCP antibodies. the molecular weight of the gB is 160 kDa and 153 kDa for the MCP. HCMV genomic DNA could be detected in fraction containing early and late endosomes as well as lysosomes. results go in line with our co-localization study described previously. recombinant gB was completely conveyed to lysosomes after only 15 minutes. whole HCMV virions never colocalized with the lysosomal marker LAMP2. this suggests that they could be sequestered into the previously described EEA1+ vesicles. amiloride (100 M) and G6983 (13 nM) significantly reduced the infection rate in a dose-dependent manner. TEM analysis of amiloride-treated MDDCs infected with HCMV showed that all particles but one were docked at the plasma membrane. chlorpromazine, a clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitor, had no effect on the infection rate. HCMV internalization into MDDCs is impaired by macropinocytosis inhibitors. cells were extensively washed then subcultured for 48 hours. the median values of the percentage (SD) of plasma membrane-associated and internalized HCMV particles are displayed as the median values of the percentage (SD) of plasma membrane-associated and internalized HCMV particles. we previously demonstrated that DC-SIGN is necessary for HCMV docking on the MDDC plasma membrane. cells were pre-incubated with filipin (7.66, 1.5, 0.3 M), nystatin (21.2, 4.3, 0.85 M) or methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD; 5, 1, 0.2 mM) and were processed as described in the legend for Figure 1D. infection of MDDCs with HCMV does not depend on endosomal acidification. an ammonium chloride buffer (NH4Cl) or bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) stabilize the endocytic pH by buffering the pH or blocking the V-ATPase responsible for the endosomal pH decrease. pretreatment of MDDCs with BafA1 (50 nM) did not impair HCMV internalization. the results are displayed as the median values of the percentage (SD) of plasma membrane-associated and internalized HCMV particles. we incubated MDDCs, monocyte-derived macrophages and monocytes from the same blood donor with HCMV for two hours. the cells were extensively washed in PBS or in a low-pH inactivation buffer and were placed over HFFs. maphages pretreated with DMSO failed to trans-infect HFFs. inhibition of endosomal acidification did not impair trans-infection. this suggests that endosomal acidification may lead to degradation of viral particles. cells were pretreated with 40 nM BafA1 (black bars) or the vehicle (DMSO) (white bars) prior to incubation with the VHL/E HCMV strain for two hours (MOI=2) cells were then extensively washed with a low-pH buffer (glycine 0.2M, pH=2.8) or with PBS alone. after 48 hours, fibroblasts were processed as previously described. virions accumulate in vesicle that resemble macropinosomes in term of size (up to 1500\u20132000 nm in diameter) the ultrastructural studies presented in this article show HCMV-containing, uncoated vesicles that resemble macropinosomes in term of size. we have provided strong evidence to conclude that the HCMV infection process in MDDCs fulfills the criteria that define macropinocytosis as previously defined by others [16]. our conclusions are consistent with previous studies that reported very similar HCMV endocytic pathways in endothelial cells with another commonly used viral strain TB40/E [50]. dendritic cells are able to tune their endosomal pH [48] and keep it stable by tightly regulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/H+ balance in endo-lysosomes. a low pH and the UL128-UL150 gene cluster are required to facilitate the penetration stage of the TR strain into epithelial and endothelial cells. further investigation is needed to elaborate on these hypotheses. we showed that envelope and capsid components, gB and MCP, were still detectable as native full-length proteins in low and intermediate-density endosomes, most likely early and late EEA1+ endosomes. the stability of endosomal pH within the infected MDDCs protects HCMV virions from degradation without impairing MDDC infection. the different fates of the macropinosomes described earlier can be observed in the context of HCMV entry into MDDCs. this leads to both the infection of the cell and the capability for trans-infection. d molecular DC-SIGN clusters located in cholesterol-enriched lipid raft are also essential for HCMV internalization. this would be the first documented receptor-specific, macropinocytosis-mediated process of virus entry. a third pool of CMV might exist as a cell-protected viral pool able to spread all over the body. in this study, we detected very few particles inside MDDCs up to 24 hours post-infection. HCMV may have taken advantage of macropinocytosis, a major process to capture antigen, and of the mild endosomal acidification of human immature dendritic cells. the absolute number of HCMV DNA copies were quantified by an in-house qPCR protocol described in the Material and Methods section of this manuscript. the numbers indicated above represent the indexed values of HCMV DNA copies in comparison to the absolute HCMV DNA copy number (=100) in the postnuclear supernatant (PN). PI means post-infection, and the values represent the absolute number of DNA copies remaining after two hours of incubation. DIC images were obtained on a SP5 LSM (Leica Microsystems, Germany) DIC images are displayed on the left side of each immunostaining. DIC images are displayed on the left side of each immunostaining. glycine-based acidic buffer (0.2M glycine, pH=2.8; +) or PBS alone (\u2013) (n=10\u201315 cells per conditions) are representative of at least two independent experiments."}
