{"summary": "the personal responsibility rhetoric of health has been dominant in the thinking and practice of public health. it resonates well with a repertoire of notions that our culture takes pride in. health has by and large been interpreted as individual lifestyle, and personal responsibility has become the most popular, sanctionable prescription. political ideologies,8 socioeconomic stratification,9 social justice,10 and so forth. individualistic conception of health has been challenged on the grounds of epistemology, ethics, and praxis. the personal responsibility rhetoric fosters unfair perceptions of individual culpability17 and leads to victim blaming. the individual responsibility rhetoric demobilizes public advocacy efforts because society is not seen as being at fault. public health simply means the health of the public, an aggregate-level, summative representation of individual health. health, though individually possessed, is socially contingent. health in a vacuum, reserve of health, and equilibrium define health as a state of being free from illness. equilibrium defines health as the capital asset or as potential capacity to resist illness. the second concept, reserve of health, is more pertinent to health promotion research. quantitative dimension involves identifying statistical patterns of the distribution of some adverse effects within certain populations. quantitative dimension involves identifying statistical patterns of the distribution of some adverse effects within certain populations. a health risk situation is constructed as an abstraction from possible problematic health situations. a health risk situation for a given health phenomenon could be analyzed in terms of factors at all 3 levels (macro, meso, and individual) causes of eating disorders can consist of individuals\u2019 lack of awareness of the severe consequences (individual level), peer expectations and encouragement (meso level), and a media environment saturated with images exalting a thin ideal (macro level). macro-level risk factors affect individuals\u2019 health behaviors and conditions. they can include various constituents of the social infrastructure, such as socioeconomic status, community structures, institutional rules, public policies, and so forth. they are structurally induced forces, externally imposed onto individuals. the sociotropic environment is made up of the ensemble of individuals\u2019 activities. it has global properties and influencing mechanisms that are not reducible to its constituting elements. as such, it is, and needs to be tackled as, an analytical target in its own right. health is a neutral condition that tends to be recognized when under the attack of illness. equilibrium is regarded as the superior form of health. the second notion, reserve of health, is more pertinent to health promotion research. a health risk situation is constructed as an abstraction from possible problematic health situations. the goal is to offer a more holistic view of what makes individual actors prone to health hazards. health risk behaviors refer to individuals\u2019 actions (e.g., binge drinking) or nonactions (e.g., not using a condom during sex) a health risk situation for a given health phenomenon could be analyzed in terms of factors at all 3 levels (macro, meso, and individual) causes of eating disorders can consist of individuals\u2019 lack of awareness of the severe consequences (individual level), peer expectations and encouragement (meso level), and a media environment saturated with images exalting a thin ideal (macro level). social networks contribute to shaping and regulating individuals\u2019 health-related behaviors with their reflexive attendance to various implicit rules and norms. social networks contribute to shaping and regulating individuals\u2019 health-related behaviors with their reflexive attendance to various implicit rules and norms. communicative behaviors may include information sharing, interpersonal health advocacy, mutual responsibility taking, and community participation. the constructed health risk situation discussed in this section shows that individuals\u2019 risk behaviors and health conditions are induced by risk factors at multiple levels. societal causes of health problems have been the focus of reflection and discussion among critical scholars of public health. they are structurally induced forces, externally imposed onto individuals. social networks contribute to shaping and regulating individuals\u2019 health-related behaviors. the sociotropic environment is made up of the ensemble of individuals\u2019 activities. it has global properties and influencing mechanisms that are not reducible to its constituting elements. as such, it is, and needs to be tackled as, an analytical target in its own right. Norms and behavioral imitation are 2 mechanisms enabling and facilitating the spread of health-related behaviors. a study by Christakis and Fowler48 demonstrated patterns of behavioral contagion in the spread of obesity in a network of 12 067 people over a period of 32 years. a study showed that friends\u2019 decisions to get a flu shot influence individuals. when an additional 10% of friends receive a flu shot, an individual\u2019s likelihood of getting a flu shot increases by 8.3%. a cascade of health-enhancing behaviors can be induced through the network influence. communicative behaviors are among the first steps toward creating healthy citizens. the prevalent cultural belief that health is something personal and private is deeply ingrained. to effectively induce positive interpersonal communication about health, a more supportive discursive environment should first be developed. smoking cessation occurred during a 32-year period. the likelihood of smoking cessation increases by 43% when a friend stops smoking, by 34% when a coworker in a small-sized company quits smoking, and by 67% when a spouse stops smoking. communicative behaviors can help shape positive perceptions about health values and social norms and build up a healthy community. the public opinion climate in which proposed health-enhancing policy changes are advocated, are evaluated, and get accepted. a more supportive discursive environment should first be developed and fortified. public health as a collective enterprise cannot fully advance its agenda. building such a repertoire is a process of (re)constructing the discursive environment in the domain of health in public life. framing is a social construction process in which public health researchers foster a discursive environment that in turn shapes the thoughts and actions of the individuals therein. the role of public health scholars is not just that of health educators relaying relevant health information but also of social constructionists advancing frames of thinking to guide the public in terms of how to think about a health problem. the goal of such framing is to increase the persuasive effectiveness of a specific health advocacy message. the goal of such framing is to increase the persuasive effectiveness of a specific health advocacy message. pirical studies on health communication and persuasion could explore the effectiveness of a societal frame of health issues in comparison with the typical individual frame. the popular, individualistic conception of health problematizes health conditions as residing in individuals\u2019 private realm. the concept of a health risk situation is an attempt to map out the factors at different levels that predispose an individual\u2019s at-risk behaviors. research has found 62% of the audience exposed to the campaign ads have stopped others from driving drunk. health communication campaigns should capitalize on its capacity for health information sharing within and across networks of individuals. fostering a positive social\u2013interpersonal environment should have long-term, cyclical benefits over time. social network analysis points to the importance of optimizing interpersonal influences to curtail communicable diseases and at-risk behaviors on the one hand. health problems are socially rooted, and solutions addressing these roots should be social solutions. intervention strategies aimed at encouraging interpersonal advocacies and communicative behaviors need to be designed."}
