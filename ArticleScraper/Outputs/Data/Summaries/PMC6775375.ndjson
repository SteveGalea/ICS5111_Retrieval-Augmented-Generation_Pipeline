{"summary": "between 2008 and 2018 the number of international travelling tripled from 9.5 million to 29 million in Korea,[1] and this upward trend is expected to be continued. despite increasing number of Korean travelers hospitalized abroad, there have been no studies investigating the medical transportation of Korean travelers from foreign countries. transportation of patients is via flight stretcher, flight-prestige, ship, or specified air ambulance. EMS = emergency medical services. 2.1. Population This study included all patients who were critically injured or became ill while traveling abroad and transported to Korea between January 2013 and July 2017. data collected included sex, age, the nature of the accident, any operation performed at the foreign country, diagnosis, transfer time, transfer method, and communications with foreign hospitals and airlines. Statistical analysis Age data were reported in terms of means standard deviations, and data on other variables were presented as numbers and percentages. 17 (51.5%) cases were from countries \"within 2 hours,\" 8 (24.2%) cases from \"2 to 4 hours', 6 (18.2%) cases from \"2 to 4 hours\" and 2 (6.1%) cases from \u2018>6 hours' of all, 24 (72.7%) transported patients were discharged and 9 (27.3%) were expired. 4 (80%) transporting via air ambulance patients had hospital stays of 1 to 2 weeks. ship transfer required 4 days for 1 and >8 days for the other patient. air ambulance required 5 to 7 days for 3 (60%) patients and >8 days for 2 (40%) differences in transport costs and duration according to methods used to transport patients home from similar distant with Korean air flight time. difference between costs of air travel involving stretchers and prestige accommodations was minimal. air ambulance was the most expensive mode of transportation (P =.001) 17 (51.5%) cases were from countries \"within 2 hours,\" 8 (24.2%) cases from \"2 to 4 hours', 6 (18.2%) cases from \"2 to 4 hours\" and 2 (6.1%) cases from \u2018>6 hours' of all, 24 (72.7%) transported patients were discharged and 9 (27.3%) were expired. traveling by ship, and 4 (80%) transporting via air ambulance patients had hospital stays of 1 to 2 weeks. air ambulance required 5 to 7 days for 3 (60%) patients and >8 days for 2 (40%). sex, age, trauma type, or major diagnosis were not significant differences. differences in transport costs and duration according to the methods used to transport patients home from similar distant with Korean air flight time. the difference between the costs of air travel involving stretchers (11,543 USD) and that involving prestige accommodations (11,813 USD) was minimal. 12 patients who received recommendations from foreign hospitals for air ambulance transport were successfully transferred just with stretcher of flight without fatal outcomes. the transfer time of air ambulance had been increased by not only the need to refuel often due to the small size of airplanes, but also transit problems due to absence of airplane in patient's located country. we found that the required approvals followed when we personally called the medical staff of foreign hospitals or visited the hospitals; under such conditions, the obstacles vanished. this is the first study on this topic in south Korea."}
