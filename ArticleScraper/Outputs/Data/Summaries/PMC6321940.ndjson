{"summary": "bats were found to be the major evolutionary reservoir for coronaviruses. the global distribution, wide species diversity, and high population densities of bats emphasize the need to better understand the ecology of bat-borne viruses. RNA from two influenza viruses, A(H17N10) and A(H18N11), was detected in the little yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira lilium) in Guatemala. 601 bats were captured from abandoned houses and caves in 2016 and 2017. 105 samples were positive for influenza A virus by real-time (RT)-PCR. rate of IAV detection in oral swabs was higher than that in rectal swabs. the sequenced segments of the purified bat influenza virus were aligned with known IAV genomic segments. the eight RNA segments of the virus consisted of four monocistronic segments that encode PB2, HA, NP, and NA viral proteins. insertions or deletions were not detected in the alignment of the bat influenza viral proteins with known influenza A viral proteins.

RT-PCR targeting the PB1 gene was performed for influenza A virus detection first using a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit and primers FLUAPB1-F (ATGATGATGGGNATGTTYAAYATG) and FLUAPB1-R (CNGGNCCNAKDTCRYTRTTDATCAT) the final elongation was for 4 min at 72\u00b0C. three of the PCR-positive samples were inoculated in the allantoic fluid cavities of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and incubated for 2 days. positive allantoic fluids were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. a volume of 100 l of HA-positive egg harvest and its 10-fold serial dilutions were inoculated into 6-well plates containing confluent MDCK cells with 400 l serum- cDNA was synthesized using a QIAamp viral minikit (Qiagen, Germany) the desired genes of the new isolate were amplified using universal primers (12) the desired genes of the new isolate were amplified using gene-specific primers. taxa were chosen to represent each HA (H1 to H16) and NA (N1 to N9) subtype. all available bat-origin sequences (H17N10 and H18N11) were included to test the hypothesis of common origins among circulating bat-borne influenza A virus. sera from 124 fruit bats were collected over two sampling trips on 19 March 2017 (n = 87) and 20 May 2017 (n = 37) at the site where the bat influenza virus was detected. another batch of serum samples was collected from 48 fruit bats on 19 April 2017. sialylglycopolymers, 3\u2032-sialyllactose (2,3-SL; Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-4Glc) and 6\u2032-sialyllactose (2,6-SL; Neu5Ac2-6Gal1-4Glc) were serially diluted in reaction buffer. plates were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. monolayers of MDCK cells in a 12-well tissue culture plate were pretreated with 300 l of DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA containing 0, 0.2, 2.0, or 20 g amantadine for 60 min at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were then washed with PBS and were infected at a multiplicity of infection of a 50% tissue culture infective dose of 0.01 (for control viruses) or 0.1 (for bat virus) for three groups of 12 C57BL/6 mice and three groups of BALB/c mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were infected with 100 l of 106 50% egg infective doses (EID50; 1.2 105 PFU) of the bat virus. at 3 and 7 days postinfection, three mice from each group were sacrificed and lungs were collected for virus detection and titration. a total of 1,202 rectal and oral swab samples were collected from four different bat species. a swab was inserted into the rectal or oral cavity of bats and left in place for a few seconds. the tip of the swab was placed into a collection vial containing 1 ml transport medium. the PCR products were subjected to a second round of PCR using primers FLUAPB1-F and FLUAPB1-R. the final PCR product was gel purified and sequenced using primers FLUAPB1-NF and FLUAPB1-R. three of the PCR-positive samples had the strongest band intensity. a volume of 100 l of HA-positive egg harvest and its 10-fold serial dilutions were inoculated into 6-well plates containing confluent MDCK cells with 400 l serum-free medium. each well was aspirated to remove residual viral solution. the plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 3 days. a representative whole-genome data set of all 18 subtypes of influenza A viruses was downloaded from GenBank. all available bat-origin sequences (H17N10 and H18N11) were included. the final data set contained 70 isolates with full genomes, 1 isolate with HA and NA only, and another isolate without PB1 and PA. bootstrapping analyses were conducted with the extended majority rule consensus tree criterion (the autoMRE option in RAxML) ninety-six-well fetuin plates were washed with ice-cold washing buffer. plates were washed (4 times) and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:2,000) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the reaction was stopped with 1 N sulfuric acid. the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. oseltamivir (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada) and zanamivir (Sigma-Aldrich) were determined in MDCK cells. cells were inoculated with the current isolated virus diluted in infection medium to give 30 to 100 plaques per well. the Egyptian viruses were tested for sensitivity to different antiviral concentrations. 106 EID50/ml of the bat virus or A/chicken/Egypt/7100/2013(H9N2) was left as an uninfected control group. infection was done through natural routes (intranasal, intraocular, and intratracheal infection)"}
