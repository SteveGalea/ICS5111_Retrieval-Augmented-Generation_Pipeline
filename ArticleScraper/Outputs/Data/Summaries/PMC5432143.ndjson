{"summary": "the meat rabbit industry is a small but important food animal commodity group in Canada. many rabbit farms are small, family-run operations in which pre-market mortality risks have remained steady at approximately 20% to 25%. the most common causes of REC in young growing rabbits include E. coli, Clostridium spp., Lawsonia intracellularis, and coccidia. ohemorrhagic E. coli, an agent associated with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans (9), is an agent associated with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. rabbits are also sold as pets and for research use, thus broadening potential human exposure. the steps involved in implementing biosecurity on-farm can be categorized into 3 major areas. the steps involved in implementing biosecurity on-farm can be categorized into 3 major areas. the steps involved in implementing biosecurity on-farm can be categorized into 3 major areas. 95 meat rabbits were submitted for routine postmortem examination to the animal health laboratory (AHL) during an industry-wide enteritis outbreak in Ontario. cadavers were weighed and gross examinations were conducted following euthanasia. Isolates positive for the eae gene only were classified as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), whereas isolates positive for any Shiga toxin gene with or without eae gene were classified as verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) rophy/fusion (25% to 65% affected), upper third of villus tips, extensive epithelial loss with attenuation of epithelium, focal hemorrhage, loss of goblet cells in upper third mucosa (colon) 4 Marked \u2014 > 65% affected, > 50% villus height reduction Gland/crypt morphology (chronicity) 0 None \u2014 straight, tightly packed glands/crypts with occasional mitotic figure 1 Minimal 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each bacterium. the odds ratio was equal to zero or infinity. a median unbiased estimate was substituted (21) for analysis. the presence of Clostridium spiroforme was identified by Gram stain of fecal material. any positive Salmonella spp. isolates were forwarded to the laboratory for foodborne zoonosis, public health agency of Canada, Guelph, Ontario for serotyping. cal infiltrates within mucosa, predominantly lymphocytic or eosinophilic ( 25% affected), minimal edema within the lamina propria 3 Moderate \u2014 increased inflammation (25% to 65%) with edema in mucosa (+ neutrophils) 4 Marked \u2014 extensive inflammation within mucosa and submucosa with abundant edema in both mucosal necrosis 0 None 1 Minimal \u2014 euthanasia, cadavers were weighed and gross examinations were conducted. samples were collected from the liver, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon into 10% neutral buffered formalin. in gene with or without eae gene were characterized as verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) sections of jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were scored for level of inflammation, degree of mucosal necrosis, gland/crypt morphology, and presence of mucosal erosion. a total histopathology score for each intestinal section was calculated by tallying the scores for each criterion with a maximum score of 13. t cells in upper third mucosa are > 65% affected, > 50% villus height reduction Gland/crypt morphology (chronicity) 0 None \u2014 straight, tightly packed glands/crypts with occasional mitotic figure 1 Minimal \u2014 mild increase in mitotic figures in crypts/glands 2 Mild \u2014 focal mucosal hyperplasia ( 25% affected), crypt dilation, loss of goblet cells 4 Marked. descriptive questions from the survey were re-formatted into yes/no questions and responses were coded accordingly. farm size was divided into \u201csmall\u201d ( 200 breeding does) and \u201clarge\u201d (> 200 breeding does). results were formatted into 2 2 tables and OR with 95% CI were calculated. affected rabbits were moderately dehydrated with marked perianal fecal staining (Figure 1A) the small and large intestines often contained varying quantities of clear to green liquid (Figure 1B) 6 fryers and 6 does were excluded from the final analysis. the gross and microscopic appearance of tissues from these animals was consistent with the spring cohort with the addition of erosion or ulceration of the plantar aspect of the hocks. ology scores are presented in Table 2 and differences are depicted in Table 3.
