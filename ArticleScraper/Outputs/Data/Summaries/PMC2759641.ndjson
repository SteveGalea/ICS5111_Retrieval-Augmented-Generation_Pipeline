{"summary": "studies of cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1. none in Asian or Chinese children. monitoring cytokine production could contribute to better management. chronic immune hyperactivation and increased T-cell turnover are present even after HAART has decreased the viral load to undetectable levels. both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines can suppress type 1 cytokines and induce polyclonal B-cell activation. ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children, 4 girls and 8 boys, were infected by mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1. they were initially diagnosed between 1996 and 2002 at age 3-64 (median, 32) months. at the time of diagnosis, 9 children had low CD4+ cell counts. patients were examined and blood for hematologic, virologic, and immunologic evaluation was taken every 2-6 months. the first cytokine evaluation was performed within 1 month of starting HAART in 7 patients, within 2-4 months in 3 patients, and after 16 and 19 months in 2 patients. 105 viable cells/well in RPMI + 5% FCS with or without PHA at a final concentration of 10 mcg/mL, Con A at 20 mcg/mL, or SAC at 0.001% v/v were incubated for 22 hours at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were then washed out with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) the standard method, performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, has a measuring range of 400-750,000 RNA copies/mL. log transformation was performed because skewness and kurtosis of raw data were 3.7 and 12.8, respectively. at the time of diagnosis, 9 children had low CD4+ cell counts. median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 500,000 copies/mL (110,000-1,300,000) all children had lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly. inin (PHA), Concanavalin A (Con A), or monocyte activator Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) were determined using ELISPOT assays. details of our adaptation of this method and its specificity and reproducibility have been reported. plates were incubated sequentially with biotinylated detection anti-cytokine antibodies (Pharmingen), 0.5 mcg/mL in PBS-T for 90 minutes, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma; St. Louis, Missouri, USA), 1/400 v/v in PBS-T for 60 minutes and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-nitroblue tetrazolium skewness and kurtosis of raw data were 3.7 and 12.8, respectively. curves of numbers of cytokine-secreting cells plotted against length of treatment with HAART were fitted by nonlinear regression. cytokine and culture condition studied while patients were receiving HAART. 112 corresponding values of CD4+ and CD8+ cells and 96 corresponding values of plasma HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were available. multiple regression correlation of numbers of IL-2-secreting cells/106 PBMCs with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts in 12 pediatric patients treated with HAART. IL-2 PHA vs CD4/mcL, P =.0008; IL-2 Con A vs CD8/mcL, P =.0008; IL-2 Con A vs CD4:CD8, P =.0035 There were no significant correlations of cytokine-producing cells numbers of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12-secreting cells tended to increase for the first 3-4 years of treatment but declined thereafter. changes in IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha-secreting cells over time were less apparent. figures 5, 6, 7, 8 and figures 9, 10 and 11. IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha-secreting cells tended to remain stable over the study period. curves were fitted by nonlinear regression. a previous study reported that plasma IL-10 declined during adequate virologic and immunologic responses in HAART-treated adults. it is impossible to distinguish between the possibility that high levels of virus suppressed production of these cytokines and/or that virus survived better when production was limited. the ELISPOT assay used in this investigation has been optimized for reproducibility and sensitivity. it does not require specialized equipment and is relatively easy to perform and inexpensive. authors and Disclosures Brian M.
