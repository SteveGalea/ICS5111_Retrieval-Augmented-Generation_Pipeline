{"summary": "the current iteration of the Laboratory Without Walls (LWW) is far removed from its earliest version as a sample collection kit and light microscope flown into a remote western Australian community. at that point the only rapid clinical laboratory method applicable to a bacterial emerging infectious disease was brightfield microscopy. by the time a second melioidosis outbreak investigation was launched by the same laboratory group,2 a confirmatory molecular method was used in the state reference laboratory on a routine basis idosis N N 2 2005 Northern WA Melioidosis N N 3

in central Queensland. the effect was an immediate shortening of clinical laboratory turnaround time from days to hours, enabling more timely initiation of influenza-specific therapy and specific infection control measures. mycobacteriology and parasitology in a clinical laboratory in a clinical laboratory in Timor Leste. at first, the thermocycler relied on a conventional thermocycler (ABI 2720, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a microfluidic chip (Expert 2100, operating DNA 1000 chip, Agilent, Little Falls, DE) to resolve amplicons in a field setting. variable mains power supply in remote settings makes molecular equipment susceptible to surge d DNA purification robot (MagMax-24, ABI) improved reproducibility of nucleic acid extraction and reduced reliance on repetitive fluid handling. the result is a reduction in the size and weight of molecular equipment. the switch from conventional to real-time PCR assays has simplified some aspects of the methods used by the LWW. it is now possible to deploy a molecular laboratory for some applications without the need for microfluidic laboratory chips, their reagents requiring different cold chain conditions. however, complex fluid handling requirements for making up master mix are not suited to field work. the current debate on point-of-care tests is instructive and may provide LWW with guidance on how a remote quality system could operate. the increasing number of graduates with molecular biology expertise should make operation of LWW procedures more feasible in the future. the greatest challenge to the field application of molecular biology is the emerging debate between centralized and devolved pathology services. the issue is not whether to concentrate clinical molecular biology services in large centralized laboratories or alternatively in small peripheral hospitals. a western Australian-based group demonstrated a deployable capability in northwestern Australia. the group deployed its portable laboratory to support Commonwealth government agencies in central Queensland. the effect was an immediate shortening of clinical laboratory turnaround time from days to hours. the laboratory without walls was established as a not-for-profit agency to develop, deploy, demonstrate, and otherwise contribute to clinical laboratory capability-building in remote, resource-limited locations. this deployment was the first successful operation of molecular mycobacteriology and parasitology in a clinical laboratory in a clinical laboratory in Timor Leste. the first real-time thermocycler to demonstrate a combination of robust construction, suitability for extreme environmental conditions, and incorporation of a shipping lock on delicate components was a 48-well, three-channel model (StepOne, ABI) the extraction robot improved reproducibility of nucleic acid extraction and reduced reliance on repetitive fluid handling. more recently smaller, easily portable real-time thermocyclers have come into use. the switch from conventional to real-time PCR assays has simplified some aspects of the methods used by the LWW. it is now possible to deploy a molecular laboratory for some applications without the need for microfluidic laboratory chips, their reagents requiring different cold chain conditions. the current debate on point-of-care tests is instructive and may provide LWW with guidance on how a remote quality system could operate. the current debate on point-of-care tests is instructive and may provide guidance on how a remote quality system could operate. the chemistry currently used for LWW molecular assays has moved from conventional to real-time PCR. this approach is unlikely to be used indefinitely. the biggest challenge to the field application of molecular biology is the emerging debate between centralized and devolved pathology services. y in infectious diseases hot spots, with appropriate controls and adjustment to environmental conditions. the laboratory without walls is our answer to diseases without borders."}
