{"summary": "a recent review of relevant predictor studies of self-reported reasons for accepting or rejecting influenza vaccination showed that the two major reasons for rejecting are misconceptions or lack of knowledge about influenza infection. the main reasons for non-compliance were the perception of vaccine inefficacy and the fear of adverse reactions. the 2006 educational and vaccination campaign was conducted from April 24 to May 8, 2006. in this period 5,912 health professionals were vaccinated. sample size was estimated taking into account an expected frequency of 10% of adverse events in adult population. adverse events were actively surveyed: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, local pain, local edema and allergic reaction. other adverse events spontaneously reported were also registered. allergy was ruled out in those with sneezing. man assay was used to diagnose human metapneumovirus (hMPV) to increase the sensitivity of influenza diagnosis, a real time PCR (Taqman assay) was added to the diagnostic tools. nested adenovirus PCR was used along with DFA due to the low sensitivity of the latter in diagnosing ADV. incidence density (ID) of respiratory symptoms, influenza virus infections and other respiratory virus infections were calculated by the formula described below. the study was conducted at the Hospital das Clinicas, university of so Paulo School of Medical Sciences (HC-FMUSP) the main building has approximately 900 beds and contains most of the surgical and clinical wards. size was estimated taking into account an expected frequency of 10% of adverse events in adult population. a subset of 337 vaccinated HCWs participated in the follow-up phase of the study. the cohort was defined during the assessment of adverse events performed by a hospital epidemiologist nurse. PCR was used to detect coronavirus and picornavirus. nested adenovirus PCR was used along with DFA due to low sensitivity of the latter in diagnosing ADV. intitulado Viroses respirat\u00f3rias ap\u00f3s vacina\u00e7o contra influenza em profissionais de sade, apresentado pelo Departamento de Mol\u00e9stias Infecciosas e Parasit\u00e1rias. p0.05 was considered statistically significant. local AE reported by 18.3% of participants, systemic AE by 71.6%. headache, myalgia and malaise were more frequently reported. no severe adverse event was observed. one hundred and twenty-one HCWs (36%) developed 192 episodes of respiratory symptoms. coryza, cough, sore throat and myalgia were reported by 36.3%, 25%, 17.4% and 13.7% of the participants. influenza-like illnesses in HCWs according to acceptance of nasal wash sampling (%) Total No Yes No 92 (47.9) 83 (43.2) 175 (91.1) Yes 07 (3.6) 10 (5.2) 17 (8.9) Total 99 (51.6) 93 (48.4) 192 (100) (p = 0.37; Pearson 2 test) Respiratory symptoms in HCWs with influenza are described on table 3.

URI following influenza vaccination were generally caused by other respiratory viruses and not by influenza. healthcare and emergency medical services personnel are among the priority groups recommended to receive the H1N1 influenza vaccine."}
