{"summary": "the introduction of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged into canada in January 2014, soon after the initial detection in the united states. the virus is highly contagious and is associated with mortality ranging between 80 and 100% in suckling pigs (2\u20134) veterinary practitioners developed approaches that allowed planned elimination of PEDV from swine herds. the time to PEDV elimination for specific herds could be projected on the basis of the herd type, its demographics, and infection control practices. however, additional factors such as the demographics of the entire production system, the number of animal movements, availability of resources and the overall willingness to eliminate a production-limiting disease could affect time to PEDV elimination for specific herds. premises that were classified as PED confirmed positive were premises that had confirmed positive real-time reverse, transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for PEDV. premises that were classified as PED confirmed positive were premises that had confirmed positive real-time reverse, transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for PEDV. the proportion of premises that were confirmed PED-positive, presumed PED-positive and presumed PED-negative by herd type were documented. median time to elimination and the 25th percentile, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by herd type, season and the year of PEDV diagnosis. the time taken to eliminate PEDV from participating premises was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves by herd type, season of diagnosis and year of diagnosis. the variable season was computed and based on northern meteorological seasons. any confirmed or presumed PEDV diagnosis between March 1st and February 28th, as well as February 29th for the year of 2016 to account for the leap year (10). database was created for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (8). it was then adapted to include PEDV when it emerged into canada in 2014. data collected from participating herds include the premises identification number, herd type, herd size, date of enrollment into the database, PEDV status of premises on date of enrollment. premises classified as confirmed PED negative were premises in which no clinical or diagnostic evidence of PED for at least 6 months after presumed negative status update. the proportion of premises that were confirmed PED-positive, presumed PED-positive and presumed PED-negative by herd type were documented. a total of 22 herds had their time censored and 116 herds had the event of interest (i.e., eliminated the virus at least 10% level with 95% confidence) the time taken to eliminate PEDV from participating premises was estimated by herd type, season of diagnosis and year of diagnosis. a failure occurred if the premises eliminated PEDV. the multivariable model was built using a manual forward selection procedure. the assumption of the Cox's proportional hazard model was evaluated. swine herds had the longest median time (43 weeks 95% CI: 18, NA) and second longest 25th percentile (27 weeks, 95% CI: 18, 79) for the duration of time it took in weeks to eliminate PEDV. cases that were diagnosed in spring and winter seasons had higher medians and 25th percentiles for the amount of time it took to eliminate PEDV. the area regional control and elimination program database was used to collect diagnostic data on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus herd status of Ontario swine herds on a weekly basis. premises that volunteered to participate in the program from January 2014 to October 2017 were included in the study. the area regional control and elimination program database was used to collect diagnostic data

herd status. premises that volunteered to participate in the program from January 2014 to October 2017 were included in the study. premises that were diagnosed with PEDV in 2015 had a hazard of eliminating PEDV that was 0.54 times the hazard of eliminating PEDV in herds diagnosed with PEDV in 2014. premises that were diagnosed in 2016 were 1.62 times more likely to eliminate the virus compared to herds diagnosed in 2014 (referent category) ninety-four cases (65.2%, 90/138) reported that they were confirmed PED-positive. of these 90 cases, 92.2% (n = 83) reported that they eliminated PEDV. of these 48 cases, 97.8% (n = 47) reported that they eliminated PEDV. wean 13 25 (16, 31) 18 (2, 25) Wean-to-finish 4 42 (32, NA) 32 (32, 55) Farrow-to-finish 15 32 (16, 47) 24 (10,

Table 2. Results of univariable analyses using a disease control program database* to determine the hazard ratios associated with herd type. the time to event (i.e., elimination) was identified as the time in weeks for a premises to change from confirmed or presumed PED-positive to confirmed or presumed PED-negative. a failure occurred if the premises eliminated PEDV. time to event (i.e., elimination) was identified as the time in weeks for a premises to change from confirmed or presumed PED-positive to confirmed or presumed PED-negative. hazard ratio for premises diagnosed in the summer and fall months was 1.40. premises that were diagnosed with PEDV in 2015 were 0.54 times more likely to eliminate the virus compared to herds diagnosed in 2014. there was no indication that the season of diagnosis and herd type variables had a time varying effect. however, the assumption of proportional hazards was met. no outliers or influential observations found. most cases occurred during the first 2 years (n = 92 in 2014 and n = 27 in 2015) of the outbreak. the number of new cases in 2016 (n = 16) and 2017 (n = 3) was substantially lower. the number of new cases in 2016 (n = 16) and 2017 (n = 3) was substantially lower. pig flow through a production system is the frequency of introducing new pigs into a population and the amount of opportunity they have to come in contact with other pigs. a partial depopulation could present a gap in pig flow, where infected animals are removed from the herd, followed by cleaning and decontaminating the site. the OMAFRA surveillance program included 100% coverage of primary PEDV-infected cases. the study only includes primary case herds that volunteered to participate in the program. it is also possible that some veterinarians did not follow up to report that the case indeed eliminated PEDV from the premises. median time to PEDV elimination from swine herds varied between 23 weeks in nursery herds and 43 weeks in farrow-to-feeder herds. hazard of elimination was higher in herds that had initial infection during summer and fall than in herds that had the initial infection during winter.
