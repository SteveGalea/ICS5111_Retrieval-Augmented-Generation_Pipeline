{"summary": "the 2005 IHR (2005) came into force in 2007 for 194 countries. the deadline for compliance was June 2012. nine countries have overseas territories with a total population of more than 15 million people. each member state has a responsibility to ensure all parts of its territory comply with the IHR (2005). the IHR (2005) requires countries to assess the ability of existing national structures to meet minimum requirements for public health surveillance and response. no specific guidance on compliance with the IHR (2005) has been provided by WHO for the special circumstances of Member States with overseas territories. the questionnaire was designed for the United Kingdom\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies following a literature search on the implementation of, and assessment of compliance with the regulations in other countries. the questionnaire was based on a self-assessment tool proposed by WHO. all territories and dependencies were largely compliant in the IHR (2005) core capacity areas. five other overseas territories and crown dependencies were broadly compliant in all core capacity areas. findings will be applicable to other countries with overseas territories. all of the united kingdom\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies had the technical ability to respond to a public health emergency or public health emergency of international concern. majority did not have the necessary expertise in zoonosis, food safety or dealing with chemical or radionuclear events. this is likely to be the case for all overseas territories. core capacity requirements for designated points of entry have been met. a) to provide access to appropriate medical services, including diagnostic facilities to allow prompt assessment and care of ill travellers; b) to provide access to equipment and personnel for the transport of ill travellers to an appropriate medical facility; c) to provide trained personnel for the inspection of conveyances; d) to ensure a safe environment for travellers using points-of-entry facilities. the IHR (2005) recognize that Member States have the sovereign right to legislate and implement legislation. however, article 3 states that legislation should uphold the purpose of the regulations. majority of the united kingdom\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies were technically compliant with national legislation and requirements. the use of standard case definitions increases the specificity of reporting and improves the comparability of events in different geographical areas. the majority of overseas territories would benefit from developing guidelines for the management of poisoning and chemical and radionuclear events. the safe and effective transportation of samples is a recognized problem in many parts of the world. it is recommended that service agreements addressing the requirements of the international air transport association for the safe shipment of biological specimens be drawn up. some questionnaire respondents felt laboratory biosafety and security were not adequate. smaller countries and territories face challenges in complying with the IHR (2005). but the process provides them with an opportunity to build, strengthen and maintain core capacities for public health surveillance and response. the process provides them with an opportunity to build, strengthen and maintain core capacities for public health surveillance and response. single model appropriate for all overseas territories because they vary greatly in geography, population, health service capabilities and disease epidemiology. gaps need to be bridged to ensure global public health security."}
