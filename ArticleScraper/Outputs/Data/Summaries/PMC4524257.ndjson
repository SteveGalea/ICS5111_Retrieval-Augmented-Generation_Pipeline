{"summary": "eukaryotic cellular mRNAs and most viral mRNAs possess a cap structure, which plays important roles in mRNA splicing, intracellular RNA transport, RNA stability, and translation initiation. the cap-0 structure of mRNA is cotranscriptionally formed through sequential enzymatic reactions, including RNA triphosphatase. coronaviruses are common pathogens of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases of humans and animals. it has been reported that bats are natural carriers of coronaviruses (11\u201313) and that coronaviruses may be transmitted from animals to humans. polyproteins pp1a/1ab are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) they include many RNA-processing enzymes, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) (18, 19), RNA helicase and triphosphatase (nsp13) (20), exoribonuclease and N7-MTase (nsp14) (21\u201323), end nsp10 is interchangeable in the stimulatory function among different coronaviruses. a peptide derived from the conserved interaction domain of MHV nsp10 shows a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on 2\u2032-O-MTase activity in vitro and during virus replication. the coding sequences of nsp16 and nsp10 from MHV, mouse hepatitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus cDNAs of nsp16 or nsp10 of MHV-A59 were inserted into the NdeI and SalI sites of the vector pET30a using standard recombinant DNA techniques. the coding sequence of nsp16 or nsp10 of TGEV (kindly provided by Luis Enjuanes), FCoV (kindly provided by Peter J. M. Rottier) and MERS-CoV was cloned into m7GpppA-RNA was prepared from transcribed RNA (pppA-RNA) by vaccinia virus capping enzyme (D1/D12) the 32P-labeled cap structures (m7G*pppA-RNA) used as RNA substrates and cap analogues (G*pppA, m7G*pppA, and m7G*pppAm) used as positive controls were prepared and purified. all of the peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and verified by mass spectrometry. the peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline before use. all mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facilities. all efforts were made to minimize suffering. cell viability, peptide inhibition, and luciferase activity assays. peptides were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 200 M at 1 h posttransfection. the cells were collected and lysed at 20 h posttransfection (32) and then subjected to luciferase activity assays using the Dual-Glo system. mice were infected by i.h. inoculation with 500,000 PFU of MHV-A59. then the peptide (TP29, TP29M, or TP29S) was injected intrahepatically. livers were removed and placed directly into 2 ml of isotonic saline with 0.167% gelatin. nsp16 and nsp10 were chemically synthesized according to deposited sequence of MERS-CoV. cDNAs of nsp16 or nsp10 were inserted into the NdeI and SalI sites of the vector pET30a using standard recombinant DNA techniques. plasmids for IBV expression (pDest14-IBV-nsp16 and pDest14-IBV-nsp10) m7GpppA-RNA was prepared from transcribed RNA (pppA-RNA) by vaccinia virus capping enzyme. 32P-labeled cap structures (m7G*pppA-RNA) used as RNA substrates and cap analogues (G*pppA, m7G*pppA, and m7G*pppAm) used as positive controls were prepared and purified as previously described. all of the peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. the peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use. all mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facilities. all efforts were made to minimize suffering. cell viability, peptide inhibition, and luciferase activity assays. peptides were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 200 M at 1 h posttransfection. the cells were collected and lysed at 20 h posttransfection (32) and then subjected to luciferase activity assays using the Dual-Glo system. mice were infected by i.h. inoculation with 500,000 PFU of MHV-A59. then the peptide (TP29, TP29M, or TP29S) was injected intrahepatically. the livers were removed and placed directly into 2 ml of isotonic saline. recombinant nsp10s and nsp16s of these coronaviruses were expressed and purified. the purity of the recombinant proteins was more than 95% with the expected molecular mass. the nsp16 and nsp10 of TGEV, FCoV, and MERS-CoV contain 30 additional amino acid residues at their N termini, leading to slower mobility than that of SARS-CoV, MHV nsp16s of TGEV (Fig. 1B), MHV (Fig. 1D), MHV (Fig. 1D), SARS-CoV (Fig. 1E), MERS-CoV (Fig. 1F) and IBV (Fig. 1G) were activated. nsp16 of FCoV alone could methylate the RNA substrate to a certain extent, but its MTase activity was increased more than 3-fold in the presence of recombinant nsp16 and nsp16 of 6 coronaviruses were incubated with substrate m7GpppA-RNA. the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity was analyzed by liquid scintillation assays. nsp10 and nsp16 stay at the ratio of 1:1 in the nsp10/nsp16 complex. nsp10 is translated 3 to 5 times more than nsp16 in the infected cells. nsp10 could significantly increase the enzymatic activity of coronavirus nsp16 in a dose-dependent manner, including FCoV nsp16. nsp10s of coronaviruses are interchangeable in stimulating the nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity among coronaviruses. in previous studies, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 2\u2032-O-MTase revealed the critical residues involved in the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16. the identified critical residues on the interaction interface of nsp10 and nsp16 of SARS- nsp16s of betacoronavirus, including MHV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, could be fully activated and stimulated with the help of nsp10s of all selected coronaviruses. nsp10s of different coronaviruses may share critical residues for binding nsp16s, and they are functionally interchangeable among different coronaviruses. the well-conserved residues are indicated by solid black and open triangles. the region corresponding to the peptide inhibitor P29 is marked by a line. the alignment was generated with the program Clustal. the conserved mechanism and interchangeability of nsp10 provides the possibility to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors for repressing the 2\u2032-O-MTase activities of different coronaviruses. the region of aa 65 to 107 of nsp10 is sufficient for the interaction with nsp16 but unable to stimulate the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. peptides derived from this region could suppress nsp16 activity in the two critical residues were changed to alanine. the stimulatory function of nsp10 was largely disrupted. the peptides were added to the mixture of nsp16s and nsp10s in MTase assays. BV, stimulated by wild-type nsp10 and their mutant, K/R to A or F/Y to A, were tested by MTase assays. the inhibition effects of P29, P29M, and P29S peptides at a final concentration of 200 M on 2\u2032-O-MTase activities of different coronaviruses. TP29 reduced the titer of MHV-A59 by 80% compared to mock control. TP29M, TP29S, and P29 did not display significant inhibitory effects. average diameter of viral plaque with TP29 treatment was two times smaller than that with TP29S 20 h postinfection. peptides TP29, TP29M, and TP29S were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 200 M, 1 h after cotransfection of Rep-SCV-luc/neo and Renilla luciferase in BHK-21 cells. TP29 repressed the replication of the SARS-CoV replicon by 50%. peptides (TP29 or TP29S) were intrahepatically injected immediately postinfection of MHV-A59. survival percentage of each group was statistically analyzed during 14-day observation period. all (10/10) of the infected mice treated by TP29 and the mice inoculated with uninfected cell preparation (mock infection) survived. intrahepatic injection of peptides showed no side effects to hosts. ALT values in mock infection controls remained at background levels. TP29 injection without MHV infection was used as a mock control. titers (E) and serum ALT values (F) were measured at the indicated time points. groups of mice (n = 7) were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days p.i. of C57BL/6 mice (magnification, 40; inset, 200) titers of TP29S-treated mice increased to 115 pg/ml 72 h (3 days) postinfection. the viral titers of TP29S-treated mice kept increasing and finally were killed 6 days postinfection. the livers of TP29-treated mice were well protected at day 3 postinfection. recombinant nsp10s and nsp16s of these coronaviruses were expressed and purified. the purity of the recombinant proteins was more than 95% with the expected molecular mass. as different cloning sites were used, the nsp16s and nsp16s of these coronaviruses contain 30 additional amino acid residues at their N termini. FCoV nsp16 alone showed a low but detectable MTase activity. the nsp16s of TGEV (Fig. 1B), MHV (Fig. 1D), SARS-CoV (Fig. 1E), MERS-CoV (Fig. 1F) and IBV (Fig. 1G) were activated and showed robust MTase activities. nsp16 and nsp16 of 6 coronaviruses were incubated with m7GpppA-RNA. the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity was analyzed by liquid scintillation assays. the markers G*pppA, m7G*pppA, and m7G*pppAm are indicated. nsp10 and nsp16 stay at the ratio of 1:1 in the nsp10/nsp16 complex of SARS-CoV (27, 28) nsp10 is translated 3 to 5 times more than nsp16 in the infected cells. nsp10 could significantly increase the enzymatic activity of coronavirus nsp16 in a dose-dependent manner. the ratio of nsp10 to nsp16 is indicated below the x axis. nsp10s of coronaviruses are interchangeable in stimulating the nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity among coronaviruses. nsp10s of coronaviruses are highly conserved among coronaviruses. the nsp16 of TGEV could be fully stimulated by the nsp10 of Alphacoronavirus and less efficiently activated when using the nsp10 of Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. in contrast, the FCoV nsp16 could be stimulated to a similar level either by cognate nsp10 or noncognate nsp10s (Fig. 4B) nsp10 (A) and nsp16 (B) of TGEV, FCoV, MHV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and IBV (F) are indicated by solid black boxes. the conserved residues involved in the interactions of nsp10/nsp16 complexes are indicated by solid black and open triangles. the conserved mechanism and interchangeability of nsp10 provides the possibility to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors for repressing the 2\u2032-O-MTase activities of different coronaviruses. the region of aa 65 to 107 of nsp10 is sufficient for the interaction with nsp16 but unable to stimulate the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. nsp10-derived peptides are essential for stimulating nsp16 activity. the peptides were added to the mixture of nsp16s and nsp10s in the MTase assays. nsp10 has a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity on nsp16 complex of different coronaviruses. FCoV, MHV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and IBV were tested by MTase assays. the inhibition effects of P29, P29M, and P29S peptides at a final concentration of 200 M on 2\u2032-O-MTase activities of different coronaviruses. we then tested whether the peptide P29 could inhibit virus replication. peptides TP29, TP29M, P29, and TP29S were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 200 M. TP29 reduced the titer of MHV-A59 by 80% compared to that of the mock control (PBS), while TP29M, TP29S, and P29 did not display significant inhibitory effects. peptides TP29, TP29M, and TP29S were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 200 M, 1 h after cotransfection of Rep-SCV-luc/neo and Renilla luciferase in BHK-21 cells. peptide TP29 repressed the replication of the SARS-CoV replicon by 50%. peptides (TP29 or TP29S) were intrahepatically injected immediately postinfection of MHV-A59. survival percentage of each group was statistically analyzed. all (10/10) of the infected mice treated by TP29 and the mice inoculated with uninfected cell preparation (mock infection) survived. liver cells caused by the virus-induced acute hepatitis in clinical diagnosis were 10 times less than that of other groups. intrahepatic injection of the peptides showed no side effects to hosts as the ALT values in mock infection controls remained at background levels. this suggests that an additional antiviral mechanism, such as an additional antiviral mechanism, is enhanced. nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity has been shown to play an important role in the evasion of innate immunity, and deficiency in the 2\u2032-O-MTase may lead to increased IFN responses against virus infection (6, 7). TP29 injection without MHV infection (P) was used as a mock control. serum IFN- levels of TP29S-treated mice sharply increased to 115 pg/ml 72 h (3 days) postinfection. the viral titers of TP29S-treated mice kept increasing and finally were killed 6 days postinfection. peptide TP29 could rescue MHV-infected mice by inhibiting viral replication. nsp16 exerts the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity only in the presence of nsp10, whereas FCoV nsp16 alone possesses the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity to some degree (25\u201328). in previous studies, it has been shown that SARS-CoV nsp16 exerts the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity only in the presence of nsp10, whereas FCoV nsp p10 has coevolved with nsp16 at the protein level. nsp10 mutants showed weakest stimulation capability of 2\u2032-O-MTase. MHV nsp10 cannot stimulate IBV nsp16, but the interaction domain of MHV nsp10 that contains the two critical residues is shorter than the corresponding interaction region of IBV nsp16. nsp10 and nsp16 exist at a 1:1 ratio in the crystal structure. the surplus nsp10 could significantly increase the enzymatic activity of nsp16. the critical residues of nsp16s are concentrated in the interaction region of around 42 amino acids. many studies have reported that coronaviruses are poor inducers of type I IFN in cell lines (43) however, in primary cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, IFN is induced by MHV infection (33, 44, 45) TP29 treatment suppressed the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity of nsp10/nsp16, which may lead to an increase of the blood level of IFN- at the early stage of infection. stimulation of nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses. nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in activation and stimulation of noncognate nsp16. broad-spectrum inhibitors can be developed by targeting the nsp10/nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase."}
