{"summary": "MARV is a member of the family Filoviridae that is highly virulent and causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. after about 5 days, more than 75% of the patients develop some form of hemorrhagic manifestation such as mucosal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, hematemesis, and ecchymosis. there are currently no licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for MARV infection. postexposure administration of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 failed to provide substantive protection of infected monkeys. peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMO) have been shown to inhibit replication of Ebola virus [13,14], coxsackievirus B3 [15], influenza A virus [16,17], alphaviruses [18], dengue virus [20], and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [21]. a single agent designated AVI-7288, targeting the NP of MARV, was as effective as the combination therapy [23]. the facility where this research was conducted is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International. the facility where this research was conducted adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011[24]. macaques were monitored closely for signs of clinical disease and euthanasia. after viral challenge, all macaques were monitored closely for signs of clinical disease and euthanasia. serum samples were serially diluted in Eagle\u2019s Essential Minimal medium. a secondary agarose overlay containing neutral red was applied to each well for 24\u201348 h. the lower limit of quantification for this assay was 1,000 PFU/mL. at least six serial 10-fold dilutions of quantified MARV genomic RNA were used to generate a standard curve. quantification of genome copies per volume serum was calculated from the cycle-threshold value obtained for each sample compared using the standard-curve equation. ensitive kit and the human Chemokine 10-plex kit were purchased from MSD. serum samples were subjected to limiting dilution ELISA. serum samples were added to the assay in duplicate using a 12-log dilution series. the slides were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the slides were then counter-stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the macaques were sedated for blood collection procedures using ketamine (100 mg/mL)/acepromazine (10 mg/mL) at 0.1 mL/kg administered intramuscularly. the macaques were randomized into five groups with six animals (including at least one female) in each group. all macaques were monitored closely for signs of clinical disease and euthanasia. blood samples were collected from each animal on day 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 41 PI. the virus was originally isolated from the serum of an infected patient. a secondary agarose overlay containing neutral red was applied to each well for 24\u201348 h. the lower limit of quantification for this assay was 1,000 PFU/mL. Tissues collected for viral load assessment were collected and stored at -60 to -80\u00b0C until analysis. quantification of genome copies per volume serum was calculated from cycle-threshold value. lower limit of quantification was 1.3 x 105 genomic equivalents/mL of serum. priority was placed on determining the sequence of the viral genome. serum samples were added to the assay in duplicate using a 12-log dilution series beginning with a 1:100 dilution of virus and ending with a 1:320,000 dilution. a complete set of tissue samples was also collected from each monkey for analysis by routine histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) the slides were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. an immunoperoxidase assay was completed on unstained slides of all tissue sections. animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups stratified by sex. the death of the one animal that died in the 1 h PI treatment group was attributed to complications associated with anesthesia administration. this mortality was treated as a treatment failure and was included in the survival statistics. differences in survival between groups receiving AVI-7288 treatments were highly statistically significant (P 0.0001) viral load in AVI-7288-treated monkeys was reduced approximately 100 times that of saline-treated animals. viral load, measured by plaque assay and qRT-PCR in serum, decreased by day 10 PI, had decreased to undetectable levels by day 14. median serum infectious virus and (B) viral RNA concentration in each treatment group. viral titer was generally present in the liver, gonads, and spleen (range: 3.6 x 106\u20134.7 x 107 PFU/g tissue) there was substantial variability in the tissue-specific viral load between individual animals in this group. no virus was detected in any tissues obtained from AVI-7288-treated animals that survived. serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were increased in all surviving animals by day 8 and resolved to within normal limits by day 28. increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) occurred as early as day 8 in animals from all groups, but resolved to within normal limits by day 21 in most of the survivors. on day 10, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly increased (P 0.01) in the four surviving saline-treated controls. increased BUN can be indicative of decreased kidney function. there was a statistically significant (P 0.05) increase in neutrophils in macaques. MARV-specific IgM was not detected in any of the AVI-7288-treated animals before day 8 PI. by day 14 PI, MARV-specific IgG was detected in all surviving animals. titers increased from day 14 to day 21 PI and plateaued thereafter. aNOVA indicates significant differences, P = 0.012 and Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test indicates individual treatment groups are each significantly different from saline controls. each animal has an area of hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis (upper right corner) spleen from a control animal that died on day 9 PI has an oval lymphoid nodule with markedly reduced numbers of lymphocytes (i.e. lymphoid depletion); there are pale pink deposits of fibrin in the surrounding red pulp. anesthesia on day 7 of the experiment and the MARV-induced lesions in its organs were very mild compared to the controls. the other two AVI-7288 treated monkeys that failed to survive had lesions indicating that MARV infection was the cause of their death. however, in each case there were microscopic lesions and/or IHC results that were not typical of those present in the control animals. a total of 30 cynomolgus macaques were challenged with a lethal dose of MARV. infection controls were administrated saline. one saline-treated monkey died on day 9 and all the animals succumbed by day 11 PI. viremia peaked on day 8 PI in all animals and in approximately 50% of the animals in the treatment cohorts. at peak of viremia, viral load in AVI-7288-treated monkeys was reduced approximately 100 times that of saline-treated animals. the slope of the genome equivalents/mL is 0.0154 0.00104. the slope of the genome equivalents/mL is 0.0172 0.006, r2 of 0.782, P = 0.116. virus was detected in nearly all tissues that were analyzed. the mutation did not appear to result in a drug-resistant phenotype. the animal survived infection with MARV. there was no evidence of this mutation seen in any other animals in the study. analysis of the (A) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and (B) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) for animals on day 10 post challenge. treatment prevented elevation of BUN (P 0.0001), but treatment did not significantly prevent elevation in ALT (P 0.206) MARV-specific IgM was not detected in any of the AVI-7288-treated animals before day 8 PI. by day 14 PI, MARV-specific IgG was detected in all surviving animals and generally reached a maximum with titers ranging from 1:30 to 1:810. levels of Eotaxin, MCP-1, and IP-10 were lower in AVI-7288-treated animals. spleen, liver and spleen also showed increased MARV antigen. large amounts of viral antigen were present within histiocytic cells in the red and white pulp as well as in the extracellular fibrin. liver from a control animal that died on day 11 PI has an area of hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis (upper right corner) d hyperplasia is present in a splenic lymphoid nodule from an animal treated with AVI-7288 beginning 48 h PI. only three of the 24 AVI-7288-treated monkeys failed to survive to the end of the study. one animal died while under anesthesia on day 7 of the experiment. seventeen of the 21 survivors were males and eight of these animals had foci of mild to moderate testicular inflammation with viral antigen. one female survivor monkey had faint staining for viral antigen in some macrophages within foci of inflammation in the thyroid gland. no MARV antigen was detected in any tissue from any of the other 12 monkeys that survived to the end of the study. all of the control animals in this study succumbed to MARV infection. 21 of the 24 animals (87.5%) treated with AVI-7288 survived. differences in survival between groups receiving AVI-7288 treatments at different times PI were not statistically distinguishable. a man who survived MARV infection during this outbreak is believed to have infected his wife via sexual contact more than 6 weeks after his clinical recovery. a household contact of an Ebola patient from the 1995 Kikwit outbreak was presumably infected by sexual intercourse. four out of five convalescent patients examined had seminal fluid samples that were PCR positive for MARV. the current outbreak reminds us of the need to identify effective antiviral products in advance of such emergency situations. AVI-7288 has recently been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in humans [32]. dotted line represents lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1.33 x 105 genome equivalents/mL. no animals had quantifiable viral genome copies on day 4 post challenge. most, but not all animals, first presented with quantifiable viral genome copies on day 5 post challenge. animals in the 1 h treatment group succumbed to infection after day 10. analysis of (A) platelets and (B) MPV from macaques in all treatment groups on day 8 and day 10 respectively."}
