{"summary": "150,000 structures in the CRC Dictionary of Natural Products (NPs) only 1% of them have at least one biological test results described in the MDL Drug Data Report database. more than half of the approved drugs from 1981 to 2010 are based on NPs. chemoinformatics approaches for the virtual screening of the most probable active compounds can be prohibitive. antiMarin [14] contains approximately 50,000 compounds from marine macroorganisms and both marine and terrestrial microorganisms. species of the order Actinomycetales (commonly called actinomycetes) are the single most productive source of microbial derived natural products. a growing interest in its distribution and ecological role in the marine environment has been observed. the antiMarin data set was screened to find lead-like molecules en route to antitumor and antibiotic drugs. RFs showed a better performance when compared to a single CT and SVMs in the prediction of the overall biological, antitumor, and antibiotic activities for test set I.

and SVM models has shown that there are 176 and 12 FP, common to both models, for the test set II and I, respectively. for these FP, it was obtained an average probability of being active (Prob_ave_act) in the RF model of 0.68 (80 FP have a Prob_ave_act 0.7) for the test set II and I, respectively. 216 compounds (i.e., approximately 96%) are active compared with only 195 active compounds (i.e., approximately 72%) from the 271 AntiMarin (test set II) compounds with the same specifications. on the other hand, 188 and 178 compounds were predicted as true positive (TP) with a Prob_ave_act of 0.72 and 0.74. a large number of FPs emerged, 202 (212 FP by the RF model) from those Lipinski\u2019s FP compounds there were as well 108 compounds that were predicted as FP by the RF model with a Prob_ave_act of 0.61. only active compounds were predicted with a Probactivity greater than or equal to 0.8 using the RF activity model. antibiotic with a probability of being antibiotic (Probantibiotic) greater than or equal to 0.9 using the RF antibiotic model. the work of Woo et al. had shown an improved antibiotic activity of deoxy derivatives in the -d-glucopyrasonyl unit. the aglycone, luteolin, of the flavonoid, luteolin-7-O--glucoside (ID 917, Scheme 1) has been shown to inhibit a series of human cancer cell lines [20,21] more recently, additional antitumor assays have suggested that luteolin-7-O--glucoside could be an interesting antitumor NP. bNPs have been misclassified as non-antitumor compounds in the AntiMarin database. in the scheme 2 were listed the 16 FPs with a Probantitumor greater than or equal to 0.8 using the RF antitumor model. the antithrombotic indole alkaloid ID 974 (Scheme 2) presents a Proxmax of 0.786 with the antithrombotic and antitumor -pentyl-3-(2-quinolylmethoxy)-benzenemethanol, CID 5059 from the training set. the antibiotic diketopiperazine ID 567 (Scheme 2) presents a Proxmax of 0.888 with one of its stereoisomers that was reported to be the tryptanthrin analog ID 670 (Scheme 2) has been reported as not possessing in vivo antitumor activity against human tumor cell lines. it was predicted to be antitumor by the RF model with a Probantitumor of 0.84. the cannabinoid, CID 5689, has been reported to possess antimitogenic activity on human melanoma cells. the analysis of the predictions obtained for the test set II has shown that there are 433 TPs with a Prob_ave_antibiotic of 0.80, as compared with a Prob_ave_antibiotic of 0.71 obtained for the 191 FP predicted. however, those with high Probantibiotic may be lead-like antibiotic MNP and MbNP, which have been misclassified as non-antibiotic compounds in the AntiMarin database. penicillin and cephalosporin are well known antibiotic drugs and the earliest antibiotics discovered. a penicillin analog was also classified as FP, ID 419 in Scheme 4. overall biological activity model for the overall biological activity model. the data are imbalanced as concerns the active and non-active classes. overall CT biological model shows poor prediction accuracy. a statistical analysis of the structural classification of natural products showed that more than half of all natural products have just the right size. the lead-like molecules must have a scaffold with two, three, or four rings. their van der Waals volumes must match the lower end of the majority of the protein cavities. 67 compounds were predicted as FPs for the test set II. compared with only 4 FPs for the test set I, with a Prob_ave_act of 0.68 and 0.59 respectively. also, we use the Lipinski rule-of-five (R-o-5) to analyze the RF activity model. only active compounds were predicted with a Probactivity greater than or equal to 0.8 using the RF activity model. from the 28 FPs, 26 MNPs and MbNPs were classified as being antibiotic by the RF antibiotic model with an average probability of being antitumor (Prob_ave_antibiotic) of 0.82. butirosin A is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic. the 5-amino function in the -d-xylofuranosyl unit was compared with the 5-hydroxyl group of butirosin A and MbNP ID 647. the 1-N-acyl derivative of the arbekacin was identified as being resistant to many inactivating enzymes while retaining most of the intrinsic antibiotic activity. antitumor assays have suggested luteolin-7-O-glucoside could be an interesting antitumor NP, even more active in the breast adenocarcinoma cell than its aglycone. bioactivity of the MNP, ID154, has never been recorded, but the high toxicity of those cortinarin derivatives was extensively reported [25]. 16 lead antitumor MNPs and MbNPs were selected from the antiMarin database using the RF antitumor model. no antitumor activity was recorded in the antiMarin database. the 3-S stereoisomer ID 580 (Scheme 2) presents a Proxmax of 0.888 with its racemate, CID 258 from the training set (Scheme 3), which was reported to be antitumor. the antifungal brominated phenylpyrrole derivative, ID 78 (Scheme 2), is related to the chlorinated pyrrolnitrin, an antibiotic and antifungal MNP from test set I. cannabinoid, CID 5689 has been reported to possess antimitogenic activity on human melanoma cells. analysis of predictions obtained for test set II has shown that there are 686 TNs with a Prob_ave_antitumor of 0.26, compared with a Prob_ave_antitumor of 0.31 obtained for the 122 FNs predicted. 96.62% of compounds with a Probantibiotic greater than or equal to 0.8 were predicted as TP by the RF model. the analysis of the predictions obtained for test set II has shown that there are 23 FPs with a Probantibiotic greater than or equal to 0.9. guanidinylated aminoglycosides (IDs 325, 994) and anthracycline antibiotics (IDs 44, 196 and 885) guanidinyl derivatives (IDs 124, 327 and 1142) were also classified as being antibiotic. all models were built using CPSA (charge partial surface area) [42], topological, constitutional and molecular descriptors. the topoPSA\u2014topological polar surface area\u2014descriptor was selected to be used in all models. the ten most relevant descriptors, found by the RF algorithm, also include in almost cases the different types of descriptors mentioned above. activity SVM a 43D: ALogp2; AMR; BCUTw-1h; BCUTp-1l; PNSA-3; FPSA-3; TPSA; naAromBond; naAromBond; ATSc3; ATSc4; ATSc5; bpol; c1SP2; SCH-4; VCH-4;

parameter (Mean Decrease in Accuracy) of importance is considered more reliable than the MeanDecreaseGini parameter (Mean Decrease in Gini Coefficient). the most important descriptor is the same in the overall activity model. the MDEO-12 is the most important descriptor for the MeanDecreaseAccuracy parameter in the RF model. it is as well the first descriptor selected to build the antitumor classification tree. only two of 16 lead-like antitumor MNPs and MbNPs that we had already proposed are classified as non-antitumor. the MDEO-12 descriptor is known to codify the molecular size by taking into account oxygen atoms also characterizes polarity. the aminoglycoside antibiotic, CID 215651, from the training set has a high MDEO-12 descriptor value of 11.20. six descriptors were selected for all machine learning techniques. the first rule of the antibiotic tree was derived with the CART algorithm. it was possible to correctly discriminate 509/888 and 267/416 antibiotic/non-antibiotic compounds for the training set (654/1150) and test set I (338/564) the training and test sets comprise of the following biological categories of compounds: 1367 antitumor, 992 antibiotic, 59 antifungal, 11 antimalarial, one anti-HIV, 79 anti-microbial, 152 cytotoxic and 206 non-active. it is important to refer that some compounds have more than one bioactivity record. 270 descriptors were calculated using the CDK Descriptor Calculator 1.3.2 [55,56]. 232 descriptors were selected from CDK collection. multilinear regressions were built with weka 3.6.5 [57,58,59] to select descriptors. a classification tree is sequentially constructed by partitioning compounds from a parent node into two child nodes. each node is produced by a logical rule, usually defined for a single descriptor. the prediction for a compound reaching a given terminal node is obtained by a majority vote of the objects (in the training set) de. RFs were grown with the R program, version 2.13.1, using the Random Forest library [63]. as a result of the nature of two-class imbalance in the overall activity model, this problem was alleviated setting the class weights to 50:50. non-active compounds were selected on the basis that were at least screened for one biological activity. the whole data set (2706 compounds) was divided into a training set of 1804 compounds and a test set of 902 compounds. the approximate 2:1 partition was carried out randomly according to the antitumor, antibiotic, and non-active categories. multilinear regressions were built with Weka 3.6.5 to select descriptors by the M5 method, using the training set. feature selection was further performed with the CFS (Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection) algorithm [60] implemented in Weka 3.6.5. a classification tree is sequentially constructed by partitioning compounds into two child nodes. each node is produced by a logical rule, usually defined for a single descriptor. the prediction for a compound reaching a given terminal node is obtained by a majority vote of the objects reaching the same terminal node. SVM map data into a hyperspace through a nonlinear mapping (a boundary or hyperplane) and then separate the two classes of compounds in this space. the boundary is positioned using examples in the training set that are known as the support vectors."}
