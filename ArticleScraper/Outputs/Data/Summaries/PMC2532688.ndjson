{"summary": "the recent re-emergence of human rabies in china was noted in several epidemiological studies. but little attention was paid to the reasons behind this phenomenon parallel the findings of the previous reports. under-reporting of rabies in previous years suggests failure to receive PEP was a major factor in the number of human cases in china. the data underline the need for greatly improved availability and timely application of high-quality anti-rabies biologicals in the treatment of human bite victims. education of the public, health care staff and veterinarians will also help to change the current situation. more than 2.5 billion people are at risk in over 100 countries reporting the disease. rabies has the tenth highest mortality of all infectious diseases worldwide. most affected are the tropical countries or regions in Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania. rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone. however, both products are often in short supply worldwide and virtually unaffordable in developing countries. the high demand for PEP in africa and Asia exerts a substantial economic burden, not only because of the high costs of human vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) products. the epidemiological data for 22527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007 were obtained from the surveillance database of reportable diseases managed by the Ministry of Health of China. the rabies diagnosis in humans was based on the clinical criteria set by the Ministry of Health of China. the history of animal bite was confirmed by subsequent case epidemiological surveys. two epidemiological indices, incidence rate and mortality rate, were computed to characterize the infectious disease in china. the incidence rate was the number of new cases of rabies diagnosed or reported during a defined period of time (for example, a year), divided by the number of persons in a stated population. the mortality rate was calculated by dividing the number of rabies deaths occurring in the population during the stated period of time (for example, a year), by the number of persons at risk of dying during the history of animal bite was confirmed by case epidemiological surveys. 244 rabies patients with their detailed medical records of anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents were ascertained from all of the reported rabies cases (441 patients) during the periods. the incidence rate was the number of new cases of rabies diagnosed or reported during a defined period of time (for example, a year) the mortality rate was calculated by dividing the number of deaths occurring in the population during the stated period of time (for example, a year), by the number of persons at risk of dying during the period. since the start of the new millennium, the incidence rates of human rabies increased from 0.0889 per 100000 inhabitants in 2002 (1159 cases) to 0.1511 (2037 cases) in 2003. between January and July there were 1740 human rabies cases reported, an increase of 28.98% compared with the same period in 2006. china was largely free of human rabies in the final years of the last century. china banned nervous tissue vaccines in 1981, so different provinces adopted slightly different options for rabies vaccines. the standard post-exposure vaccination schedule was the 'Essen' 5-dose intramuscular regimen on days of 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28. however, five pre-exposure or post-exposure schedules are currently used in China. direct or indirect contact accounted for 96.47% of the types of exposure. categories I-III accounted for 33.6%, 38.9% and 22.5% of the patients. the remaining 5% were not classified due to incomplete data. only 7.5% (6/80) of patients received a full regime within 24 hours. five had a bite on the head and neck and one case had multiple bites. all six patients finally died from the rabies infection. since the start of the new millennium, the incidence rates of human rabies increased from 0.0889 per 100000 inhabitants in 2002 (1159 cases) to 0.1511 (2037 cases) in 2005, 2571 cases of rabies were documented. between January and July there were 1740 human rabies cases reported, an increase of 28.98% compared with the same period in 2006. there were no reported cases in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Tibet, Gansu or Liaoning provinces. the mortality rate was identical or similar to the incidence rate as, once clinical signs of rabies appeared, the disease was 100% fatal. exposure category I describes the lightest degree of exposure to infection without any skin injury. category III describes the most serious situations where single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches occurred that required immediate wound treatment and anti-rabies vaccines. most of the 244 human rabies cases were infected by dogs (209 cases, 85.7%), followed by cats (9 cases, 3.7%) and rats (6 cases, 2.5%). a McNemar test revealed that virus transmission by dogs was highly significant (P 0.01) compared with other animals. 45% (36/80) of patients did not receive any rabies vaccine or passive immunization. only 7.5% (6/80) of patients received a full regime. five patients had a bite on the head and neck and one case had multiple bites. analysis of post-exposure treatment failures per risk factors predisposed to or regimens given to 80 patients who received any type of PEP, collected in Guangdong province Factor Known cases Multiple wounds and/or bite on head and neck 55 (68.8%) Insufficient wound treatment 50 (62.5%) Delay of two or more days 34 (42.5%) No rabies immunoglobulin given 73 (91.3%) No rabies vaccines given 74 (92.5%) Discussion In china, human rabies was this bias is not unique to the data ascertained at various CDCs. this bias is common to many medical experiments where random sampling is not a feasible (often less-efficient) strategy for data collection. there is a list of factors influencing precise and accurate estimation of human rabies parameters. the time lag between the incidents and the presentation of patients for anti-rabies assessment ranged from 0 to 3 days in most cases. up to 62.5% did not receive proper treatment of the wounds, 92.5% did not receive adequate post-exposure vaccination and 91.25% did not receive any anti-rabies immunoglobulin. this fact could be a significant issue for public health based on the large number of failures for human PEP that have occurred recently in china. rabies vaccine costs US$12.5\u201345.0, taking up 0.42\u20131.51% of the average annual income per capita. rabies vaccine costs US$12.5\u201345.0, taking up 0.42\u20131.51% of the average annual income per capita. china has not implemented enforced vaccination for dogs. the positive rate was 3.9% (4/102, Guangxi province) in 1999, 9.1% (76/838, Hunan, Henan, Guangxi, Guizhou and Jiangsu provinces) in 2004 and 5.9% (5/85, Guizhou province) in 2005. the method of control undertaken by Latin American countries might provide promising ways for China to develop a more effective programme for controlling human rabies transmitted by dogs. study aims to reduce non-compliance rates and decrease flaws in health-care provision. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors conceived of and drafted the
