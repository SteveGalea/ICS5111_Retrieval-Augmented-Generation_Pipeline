{"summary": "icosahedral, enveloped, nuclear-replicating, double-stranded DNA virus belongs to the neurotropic Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. the site of primary infection by HSV-1 is usually the oral mucosa, from where it spreads to infect nearby sensory neurons. in the sensory neurons it forms a lifelong infection, staying unnoticed in a latent state. secreted proteins are an important group of molecules estimated to be encoded by approximately 10% of the human genome. they can be used as biomarkers or drug targets. a prototype of an unconventionally secreted protein is proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1. no large-scale studies on HSV-1-induced protein secretion have been published. we have characterized the secretome of HSV-1-infected human primary macrophages using quantitative MS-based proteomics combined with bioinformatics. monocytes were left to differentiate into macrophages in macrophage serum-free medium (SFM; Gibco) supplemented with 10 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Biosource International Inc., Camarillo, CA) and antibiotics. after 7 days of culture, the macrophages were CD14 positive (data not shown) and used in experiments. the proteins were purified using a 2-D Clean-Up kit (GE Healthcare/Amersham) the lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm. the supernatant from the cells lysates was collected for further Western blot analysis. peptides were labeled with fourplex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQs) from a reagents multiplex kit. peptides were fractionated with strong cation-exchange chromatography (SCX) using a polySULPHOETHYL A column (200 by 2.1 mm; 202SE0502; PolyLC Inc.) at least two unique peptides with good-quality tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data were required. MS/MS spectra with reporter ion peak heights below 10 counts were manually removed from the quantification results. the calculated FDRs were under 4% in both sample sets. proteins were transferred from the gel to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in 0.05% Tris-buffered saline\u2013Tween 20. incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (M20) was done overnight at +4\u00b0C. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats. cells were plated at a density of 1.4 106 monocytes/6-well plate well. cells were allowed to attach for 45 min, and then unattached cells were washed away with DPBS. cells were infected with the wild-type KOS strain of HSV-1. after 2 h of infection, cells were washed three times with DPBS and fresh RPMI 1640 (supplemented as described above) at 18 h postinfection, cell culture supernatants were collected and pooled. the supernatant from the cell lysates was collected for further Western blot analysis. the cells were either stimulated with 100 g/ml monosodium urate (MSU; Enzo Life Sciences) for 3 h or infected with HSV-1 KOS at an MOI of 1 for 18 h. each SCX fraction containing iTRAQ-labeled peptides (approximately 14 fractions) was analyzed twice using an Ultimate 3000 nano-liquid chromatograph (nano-LC; Dionex) coupled to a QSTAR Elite hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) with nanoelectrospray ionization (16, 25) protein identification and relative quantification were performed using ProteinPilot (version 2.0.1) software geneTrail was used to recognize functional Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway categories that were over-represented in the data. geneTrail analysis was done using all genes from H. sapiens as a reference set, a significance threshold of 0.05, an FDR-adjusted P value and 2 as the minimum number of genes per category. gD (DL6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), interferon-induced tetratricopeptide protein 2 (IFIT2; Sigma-Aldrich), IFIT3 (BD Biosciences), S100-A9 (47-8D3) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) p84/p91 (E-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) LC-MS/MS data, we identified 1,094 human proteins. from these we had good-quality quantification information from 10 distinct proteins. secretion of 46, 161, and 399 human proteins increased more than 2-fold upon IFN- priming, HSV-1 infection, and IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection. HSV-1 replication in human primary macrophages measured by HSV-1 gD Western blotting from total cell lysates at different time points ranging from 3 to 18 hpi. already at 6 hpi, some HSV-1 replication was detected in the cell lysate, and it strengthened until 14 hpi. the majority of the human proteins in the HSV-1-induced secretome have an intracellular localization and are known exosomal proteins. GO annotations were done using GeneTrail, classically secreted proteins were predicted using SignalP. exosomes are membranous vesicles that are actively released to the extracellular space by most mammalian cells (33) from all of the proteins identified, approximately 60% (634 proteins) were found from the exosomal protein database ExoCarta (20) from the 411 proteins whose secretion increased more than 2-fold upon IFN- priming and/or HSV-1 infection, almost 80% (314 proteins) were found from ExoCarta. inflammatory responses were among the most abundant protein groups identified from the secretome after IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection. most of the proteins belong to more than one GO class. KEGG pathway analysis and GO annotations were done using GeneTrail. macrophages were left untreated (control [CTR]) or primed with 200 IU/ml of IFN- for 4 h. cell supernatants were collected, and cell lysates were prepared at 18 hpi. Luminex analysis of unconcentrated cell supernatants for selected chemokines. IFIT2, IFIT3, and MxA were clearly induced by IFN- and HSV-1 stimulation alone. levels were highest in the IFN-primed and/or HSV-1-infected macrophages. the secretion of ISGs was seen only after IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection. x Proteasome subunit beta type 8 Q5QNR8 x Proteasome subunit beta type 9 Q5JNW4 x Protein-l-isoaspartate (d-aspartate) O-methyltransferase P22061 STAT1 Q68D00 x Talin-1 Q9Y490 x Threonyl-tRNA synthetase variant Q53GX7 x Tryptophany all of the studied danger signal proteins were clearly more abundant after HSV-1 infection alone and after IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection. in the secretomes, all of the studied danger signal proteins were clearly more abundant after HSV-1 infection alone and in combination with IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection. in-1 P09382 x Galectin-3 Q6IBA7 x Thioredoxin reductase 1, cytoplasmic Q16881 Other Nucleophosmin P06748 x Peptidyl-proly1 cis-trans isomerase A, cyclophilin A P62937 x HSV-1 infection of human macrophages does not result in inflammasome activation. previous studies have suggested that inflammasomes a robust secretion of IL-1 was seen in Pam3Cys-treated and MSU-stimulated macrophage cell culture supernatants. a modest increase in IL-1 secretion was also seen in Pam3Cys-primed and HSV-1-infected macrophages. however, Western blot analysis of cell culture supernatants revealed that the biologically active form of IL-1 is not secreted by Pam3Cys-pri IL-1 was analyzed from cell culture supernatants with ELISA. expression of 31-kDa pro-IL-1b, and 17-kDa mature IL-1b was analyzed. secretome of IFN--primed and HSV-1-infected human primary macrophages. IFN- priming increases protein secretion from HSV-1-infected macrophages. only a modest increase in total protein secretion could be detected. secretome analysis revealed robust secretion of HSV-1 proteins. HSV-1 replication kinetics in human macrophages measured by HSV-1 gD Western blotting from total cell lysates at different time points. the human proteins whose secretion increased more than 2-fold upon IFN- priming and/or HSV-1 infection were classified using the gene ontology classification based on the cellular compartment. GO annotations were done using GeneTrail. classically secreted proteins were predicted using SignalP. only 14% of the proteins whose secretion increased more than 2-fold upon IFN- priming and/or HSV-1 infection were predicted to be classically secreted. the KEGG database was used for pathway analysis of the human proteins in the secretome with a fold change (FC) of >2 in the HSV-1-infected and the IFN-primed plus HSV-1-infected macrophages. the most significant overrepresented KEGG pathways after IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection included glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, the pentose phosphate pathway. FC of >2 in the secretome upon IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection (B) and HSV-1 infection alone (C) most of the proteins belong to more than one GO class. Western blot analysis from macrophage total cell lysates and concentrated cell supernatants for interferon-stimulated proteins IFIT2, IFIT3, STAT1 p84/p91, and MxA. we identified and quantified altogether 133 known interferon-induced proteins from the macrophage secretome after IFN- priming and/or HSV-1 infection. after IFN- priming and HSV-1 infection, and IFN- stimulation or HSV-1 infection alone had only a modest effect on the secretion of ISGs. table 1 shows interferon-induced proteins with an FC of >2 in IFN--primed and/or HSV-1-infected cells. yxin Q15942 a The Interferome database was used. proteins were shown to be regulated by type I IFN in at least two previous publications.

IL-1 is not secreted from HSV-1-infected human macrophages. quantitative proteomics approach characterizes secretome of macrophages infected with HSV-1. only 14% of the proteins whose secretion increased more than 2-fold upon IFN- and/or HSV-1 infection were predicted to be classically secreted. almost 80% of the proteins that were more secreted by IFN-primed and/or HSV-1-infected macrophages were found in the ExoCarta database. oligoadenylate synthetases have an extracellular function by stimulating RNase L-independent antiviral activity (15). the secretion of these proteins was not increased by IFN- priming or HSV-1 infection alone. many of the identified HSPs have been shown to mediate macrophage activation (10) and induce the secretion of different cytokines (26). this suggests that these proteins have a general function in the activation of the inflammatory response during viral infections. human macrophages express Aim-2, IFI16, and NLRP3 proteins. but these PRRs fail to detect HSV-1, which readily replicates in macrophages and activates the IFN-mediated antiviral response in these cells. future studies are needed to elucidate viral counterstrategies that block inflammasome activation during HSV-1 infection."}
