{"summary": "influenza viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. each year, outbreaks of seasonal influenza result in estimated 25 to 50 million cases in the united states alone. there is also concern that human infections with newly emerging strains of influenza A virus from animal reservoirs are associated with serious complications. VIS410 is an engineered human IgG1 monoclonal antibody. it targets the conserved stem region of influenza HA glycoprotein. the main complication of infection with both seasonal and emerging strains of influenza viruses is viral pneumonia. a recent study demonstrated the antiviral activity of VIS410 against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and A(H5N1) influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo. VIS410 did not inhibit the replication of A(H7N9) influenza virus in cell culture. both mouse models had limitations in their ability to simulate the potential clinical efficacy of VIS410 in human A(H7N9) infections. the pathogenicity of this virus subtype stems from uncontrolled viral replication throughout the respiratory tract. a single administration of VIS410 prevents virus spread at the site of infection and protects BALB/c mice against the development of ARDS. MDCK-London cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. the presence of R292K NA populations was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. VIS410 human monoclonal antibody was generated. oseltamivir carboxylate (100 nM) was added to the assay during the preincubation step. a no-serum or no-oseltamivir carboxylate control row for each virus was included to give a maximum infectivity value. a no-virus control row was included to give the background. VIS410 was administered via intraperitoneal injection of a single 50-mg/kg of body weight dose 12 h before inoculation with A(H7N9) virus (prophylaxis) or a 2-, 10-, or 50-mg/kg dose 24 h after inoculation. mice that lost 25% of their body weight were euthanized. ant H1 HA protein (0.1 g/100 l of serum) was derived from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). negative samples were given a concentration of 0.9 g/ml. three mice from each group were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 9 days postinoculation. the lungs were placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 48 h. the lungs were dried at 60\u00b0C for 96 h and then weighed again. pulmonary extravasation of Evans blue dye measured permeability. the areas of active influenza A virus infection were defined as areas of lung tissue containing cells that were strongly positive for viral antigen. all data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) 1/2013 (H7N9) viruses were obtained through the world health organization network. they were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 48 h at 35\u00b0C. the presence of R292K NA populations was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. stained monolayers were stained with 1% crystal violet in 10% formaldehyde or neutral red. the 50% effective concentration was then calculated using regression analysis or the Reed-Muench algorithm. VIS410 was administered via intraperitoneal injection of a single 50-mg/kg of body weight dose 12 h before inoculation with A(H7N9) virus (prophylaxis) or a 2-, 10-, or 50-mg/kg dose 24 h after inoculation. mice that lost 25% of their body weight were euthanized. VIS410 concentrations in serum samples were determined by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant H1 HA protein (0.1 g/100 l of serum) derived from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus. the lungs were placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 48 h. the lungs were dried at 60\u00b0C for 96 h and then weighed again. the pulmonary extravasation of Evans blue dye (Sigma) was measured. ifocal, small focal, or widely separated but conspicuous lesions; 3, moderate, multifocal, and prominent lesions; 4, marked, extensive-to-coalescing lesions. 5, severe, extensive, and diffuse lesions with multilobar consolidation. the EC50s of VIS410 for representative viruses of HA group 1 ranged from 0.03 to 7.00 g/ml. the EC50s for viruses of HA group 2 were approximately 10-fold higher (range, 0.30 to 64.00 g/ml) these data were comparable with previously reported values (14) H1N1pdm09 R S 0.29 0.03 A/Pennsylvania/30/2009 H1N1pdm09 R R 1.60 0.21 A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 H1N1 S R 1.20 0.40 A/California/12/2012 H1N1 S S 1.40 0.00 A/Singapore/1/1957 H2N2 S S 1.30 0.14 A/Gull/Pennsyl b Concentration of VIS410 antibody that protected MDCK cell monolayers by 50% compared to untreated cells. we then assessed the ability of VIS410 to neutralize H7N9 influenza viruses in vitro. the adamantane-resistant genotype is based on the presence of an S31N amino acid substitution in the M2 protein. the NAI-resistant genotype is based on the presence of an R292K amino acid substitution in the NA glycoprotein. usceptible A/Fukui/20/2004 (H3N2) virus and oseltamivir-resistant A/Fukui/45/2004 (H3N2) virus harboring an E119V NA substitution were obtained from the Antiviral Group of the International Society for Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Diseases. VIS410 administration results in increased survival and reduced weight loss in a lethal A(H7N9) mouse model. a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of 50 mg/kg of VIS410 antibody administered 12 h before infection resulted in 100% protection of mice. animals prophylactically treated with VIS410 showed early weight loss compared to mock-infected mice. animals prophylactically treated with VIS410 showed early weight loss compared to mock-infected mice. mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 MLD50 of either NAI-susceptible A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) (A and B) or NAI-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) (C and D) influenza virus. the highest single dose tested (50 mg/kg) provided the greatest protection, with 100% of the mice surviving the A(H7N9) virus infection. 90% of the mice treated with a 2-mg/kg dose survived the lethal challenge. 100% of the mice treated with 10- or 50-mg/kg doses were protected from weight loss and death. oseltamivir treatment exhibited only limited efficacy. at 9 dpi, the virus titers in the lungs of animals treated with VIS410 were below the detection limits for both NAI-susceptible and -resistant viruses. VIS410 treatment restricted virus spread and enhanced A(H7N9) virus clearance from the lungs of infected mice. mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 MLD50 of A(H7N9) viruses. animals were treated with a single i.p. administration of VIS410 at the indicated doses or with oseltamivir (100 mg/kg/day) administered orally twice daily for 5 days. VIS410 treatment significantly decreased the lung water content (P 0.001) compared to those in control mice inoculated with both a/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and a/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses. treatment with VIS410 also significantly decreased the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) the lungs were harvested from mice (n = 3/group) at 7 dpi. the total protein (g/ml) (C and D) and LDH levels (E and F) were determined. the oxygenation level was determined in mice inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013 (G) or A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) (H) at 6 dpi as a ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) to the the oxygenation levels of mock-infected animals were within the normal range of >450 mm Hg. oseltamivir treatment of mice infected with NAI-resistant virus did not protect the animals from developing mild ARDS. NK cells, alveolar macrophages (AMs), inflammatory monocytes (IMs) and neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6Cint) were infected with VIS410. the severity and extent of pulmonary infection were worse in control mice than in mice receiving VIS410. abundant interstitial and intra-alveolar inflammatory cells were present in virus-infected areas. systematic scoring of acute lung injury based on histology was performed in a blinded fashion. the calculated average injury scores for control animals were 83 and 220 for the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses. VIS410-treated animals showed decreased lung injuries compared to the oseltamivir-treated animals. representative features in lungs of BALB/c mice (n = 3/group) infected with 10 MLD50 of either NAI-susceptible A/Anhui/1/2013 (A, C, D, G, H, K, and L) or NAI-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 (R292K NA) influenza virus and treated i.p. with 50 mg/kg of VIS410. VIS410-treated mice received a single i.p. administration of PBS (mock) the values represent the means SDs from 3 animals. differences between VIS410-treated mice inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) or A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) virus and control mice were determined.

BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 MLD50 of either NAI-susceptible A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) or NAI-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus and treated i.p. with a single dose of VIS410 (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg), PBS ( EC50s of VIS410 for representative viruses of HA group 1 ranged from 0.03 to 7.00 g/ml. the EC50s for viruses of HA group 2 were approximately 10-fold higher. antiviral activity of VIS410 against a diverse panel of influenza A viruses in cell culture. ylvania/30/2009 H1N1pdm09 R R 1.60 0.21 A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 H1N1 S R 1.20 0.40 A/California/12/2012 H1N1 S S 1.40 0.00 A/Singapore/1/1957 H2N2 S S 1.30 0.14 A/Gull/Pennsylvania/4175/1983 H5N1 S S 1.40 1.20 Rg resistant, based on the presence of an S31N amino acid substitution in the M2 (for adamantane) or based on the presence of an H274Y amino acid substitution in the NA (for NAI) the values reported represent the means of the results from 2 to 3 independent experiments. c Rg, reverse genetics viruses. the adamantane-resistant genotype is based on the presence of an S31N amino acid substitution in the M2 protein. the NAI-resistant genotype is based on the presence of an R292K amino acid substitution in the NA glycoprotein. resistant A/Fukui/45/2004 (H3N2) virus harboring an E119V NA substitution were obtained from the Antiviral Group of the International Society for Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Diseases. inhibition by NAIs was normal (10-fold increase), reduced (10- to 100-fold increase), or highly reduced (>100-fold increase). dose of 50 mg/kg of VIS410 antibody administered 12 h before infection resulted in 100% protection of mice. animals prophylactically treated with VIS410 showed early weight loss compared to mock-infected mice. animals prophylactically treated with VIS410 showed early weight loss compared to mock-infected mice. mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 MLD50 of either NAI-susceptible A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) (A and B) or NAI-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) (C and D) influenza virus. all treatments were initiated 24 h after virus inoculation. 90% of the mice treated with a 2-mg/kg dose survived the lethal challenge. 100% of the mice treated with 10- or 50-mg/kg doses were protected from weight loss and death. oseltamivir treatment exhibited only limited efficacy. VIS410 were below the detection limits for both NAI-susceptible and -resistant viruses. this suggests that VIS410 treatment restricted virus spread and enhanced A(H7N9) virus clearance from the lungs of infected mice. mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 MLD50 of A(H7N9) viruses (in 50 l) all treatments were initiated at 24 hpi, with control mice receiving a single i.p. administration of PBS at 24 hpi. three animals in each group were euthanized on 3, 6, and 9 dpi. VIS410 treatment significantly decreased the lung water content (P 0.001) compared to those in control mice inoculated with both a/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and a/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses. treatment with VIS410 significantly decreased the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a marker of epithelial cell damage. the lungs were harvested from mice (n = 3/group) at 7 dpi. the total protein (g/ml) and LDH levels (E and F) were determined. the oxygenation level was determined in mice inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013 (G) or A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) (H) at 6 dpi. oseltamivir treatment of mice infected with NAI-resistant virus did not protect the animals from developing mild ARDS. NK cells, alveolar macrophages (AMs), inflammatory monocytes (IMs) and neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6Cint) in control animals, compared to mock mice, by 3 dpi. samples obtained at 6 dpi confirmed the presence of dose-related antibody treatment-mediated differences in lung pathology. both severity and extent of the pulmonary infection were worse in control mice than in mice receiving VIS410. antibody treatment prevented severe damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. systematic scoring of acute lung injury based on histology was performed in a blinded fashion. the calculated average injury scores for control animals were 83 and 220 for the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses. VIS410-treated animals showed decreased lung injuries compared to those of the oseltamivir-treated animals. 10 MLD50 of either NAI-susceptible A/Anhui/1/2013 (A, C, D, G, H, K, and L) or NAI-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 (R292K NA) (B, E, F, I, J, M, and N) influenza virus. in contrast to the clear alveoli in the lungs of antibody-treated mice (A), there was an increase in intra-alveolar protein/fibri single i.p. administration of PBS (mock) values represent means SDs from 3 animals. differences between VIS410-treated mice inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) or A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) virus and control mice were determined by one-way ANOVA. BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 MLD50 of either NAI-susceptible A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) or NAI-resistant A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus and treated i.p. with a single dose of VIS410 (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg), PBS (control), or oseltamivir (100 mg/kg/day, twice daily for a single i.p. administration of VIS410 improved the survival of mice inoculated with a lethal dose of A(H7N9) influenza virus. treatment with VIS410 decreased lung edema, protected mice from developing arterial hypoxemia, limited virus spread within lung tissues and mitigated the lung damage associated with ARDS. human monoclonal antibodies targeting the stem region of the HA glycoprotein of influenza A viruses are a rapidly growing and promising class of influenza antivirals. influenza A stem-targeting monoclonal antibodies exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against both group 1 and 2 HAs. VIS410 has shown its binding affinity to H1, H2, H5, and H9 (group 1 HA) and H3, H6, and H7 (group 2 HAs) VIS410 has two neuraminic acid binding sites, with the second HB site, having a combined HA and NA function (8, 41) this virus property does not appear to be important for the neutralizing ability of VIS410 against A(H7N9) influenza viruses in vivo. VIS410 administration was associated with improved integrity of the alveolar capillary barrier, improved blood oxygenation, and a smaller area of active infection. this is advantageous if VIS410 is considered for prophylactic use in close household contacts of influenza patients or in individuals from high-risk groups. the effect of 045-051310-2B06 or S6-B01 administration on viral load in the lungs or host lung function has not been evaluated. however, as expected, the dose of the monoclonal antibody needed to achieve protection from clinical signs of inflection may be different between virus strains and monoclonal antibodies. the activity of VIS410 is 2-pronged and most likely includes both direct action on the virus and an immunomodulatory component. monoclonal antibodies that are targeted to broadly neutralizing epitopes on the HA glycoprotein represent a promising class of direct antiviral drugs that can be efficacious against a wide variety of influenza virus strains."}
