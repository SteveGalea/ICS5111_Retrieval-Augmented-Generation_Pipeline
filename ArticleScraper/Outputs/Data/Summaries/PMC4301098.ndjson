{"summary": "zoonotic viruses belong to the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. both are highly pathogenic in humans. they are naturally harbored by Pteropid fruit bats. both HeV and NiV infections cause respiratory disease and/or severe neurological disease that may eventually progress to coma and finally death. henipavirus infection in horses predominantly causes death due to severe respiratory disease, and the horses may show some neurological symptoms. uses human monoclonal antibodies (m102.4) that were selected from a human Fab phage display library for their high binding to soluble HeV glycoprotein (sG) this improved MAb (m102.4) has been shown to protect ferrets from lethal NiV challenge and African green monkeys from lethal HeV and lethal NiV challenge (16\u201319) the second approach uses viral vaccines. recombinant RABV vaccine vector is derived from the live-attenuated RABV strain SAD B19 RABV. this strain was further attenuated by switching an amino acid in the RABV glycoprotein (G), which greatly reduces the neurotropism of the RABV strain. both recombinant RABV- and VSV-based vaccine vectors have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in nonhuman primates. plasmids were designated RABV-coHeVG and RABV-coHeVG respectively. the resulting plasmids were inserted into the XhoI and NheI restriction sites of the VSV vector cVSV-XN (35) the correct sequence of all four plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. larger amounts of RABV-HeVG or RABV-coHeVG were concentrated in a stirred 300-ml ultrafiltration cell (Millipore) then spun through a 20% sucrose cushion in an SW32 Ti rotor (Beckman, Inc.) at 25,000 rpm for 1.5 h. recombinant VSVs were purified similarly but without prior concentration in ultrafiltration cells. nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked in TBST (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) after blocking, the membrane was incubated overnight with antisera obtained from a convalescent HeV-infected African green monkey at a dilution of 1:1,000 in 5% bovine serum albumin. cells were infected with RABV-HeVG, RABV-coHeVG, or RABV at an MOI of 10 or left uninfected (control) for 48 h. after infection, medium was aspirated and cells were washed with 1 ml 1 PBS once. three hundred microliters of 1 PBS-EDTA buffer was added per well for 5 to 10 min. the RABV-infected cells were stained in 50 l of a secondary antibody mixture of donkey anti-human IgG DyLight 649 and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 in FACS buffer for 30 min at room temperature. the cells were stained in 50 l of a secondary antibody mixture of donkey anti-human IgG conjugated to Cy3 in FACS buffer for 30 min at room temperature. mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with 106 PFU or FFU of live virus. all i.m. immunizations were performed by administering 50 l of live or BPL-inactivated virus into each hind leg muscle. sera from individual mice as well as pooled sera were analyzed. supernatant was collected between days 5 to 7 posttransfection and loaded onto an equilibrated anti-HA agarose (Pierce) column containing a 2.5-ml agarose bed volume. the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of TBST and 2 bed volumes of TBS. after 2 h of incubation, antibody-bound HeV G was eluted with 5 ml of 250 g/ml HA peptide in TBS plates were washed three times with PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in 1 PBS) plates were then washed three times with PBST and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with serial dilutions of sera in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. after incubation, plates were washed three times with PBST. ELISA data were analyzed using a sigmoidal nonlinear fit model. we prepared a 2-fold dilution series of the mouse serum samples starting at 1:10 in DMEM\u20132% FBS. the virus-serum mixture was then added to a 96-well plate confluent with Vero cells. the resulting plasmids were designated RABV-coHeVG and RABV-coHeVG. the correct sequence of all four plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. the correct sequence of all four plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. we harvested the supernatants of transfected cells after 7 days for transfection with RABV and after 3 days for VSV recoveries. we then analyzed for the presence of infectious virus by immunostaining for RABV or for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) the virus particles were denatured with urea buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 8 M urea, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% -mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) the nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked in TBST (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) after blocking, a total of 8 105 Vero cells were seeded in 6-well plates. cells were infected with RABV-HeVG, RABV-coHeVG, or RABV expressing Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (VSV-ZGP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 or left uninfected (control) for 6.5 h. the RABV-infected cells were stained in 50 l of the primary antibody mixture. the cells were stained in 50 l of donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3. the cells were stained in 50 l of a secondary antibody mixture of donkey anti-mouse IgG. five groups of five 6- to 8-week-old Swiss Webster mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 105 PFU (VSV) or focus-forming units (FFU) of the live viruses diluted in 20 l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mice were weighed daily and monitored for signs of disease until day 28 postinfection. subconfluent T175 flasks of 293T cells were transfected with a pDisplay vector encoding amino acids 71 to 604 of the globular head and the stalk domains of the HeV G fused to an HA peptide. supernatant was collected between days 5 to 7 posttransfection and loaded onto an equilibrated anti-HA agarose column containing a 2.5-ml agarose bed volume. sHeV G was resuspended in coating buffer (50 mM Na2CO3 [pH 9.6]) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml. then plated in 96-well ELISA MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) at 100 l per well. plates were washed three times with PBST and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. ELISAs were performed for HeV G using pooled sera (day 35) dilutions were prepared starting at a 1:150 dilution. secondary antibodies specific for mouse IgG1 and IgG2a were diluted 1:2,000 or 1:20,000, respectively, in PBST, and 100 l was added per well. RABV vaccine vector is derived from the RABV SAD B19 vaccine strain. the construct was engineered to contain an additional RABV stop-start transcription signal sequence flanked by unique XhoI and NheI restriction sites. rVSV has been used to develop immunization strategies against a large number of pathogens, including influenza virus. the goal of this study was to compare immunogenicity and safety in a small animal model of the two rhabdoviral vector platforms expressing the same foreign antigen. in order to generate the rRABV and rVSV vaccines expressing either wt or codon-optimized HeV G (coHeV G), we amplified the respective HeV G ORFs and then insert them into the plasmid downstream of the VSV G gene. the detected expression level for coHeV G was 2.5-fold higher than that for wt HeV G. in contrast, no significant difference was detected in HeV G expression for the two VSV constructs (VSV-HeVG and VSV-coHeVG) cells were stained with antibodies directed against RABV, VSV G, or HeV G. blot analysis of sucrose-purified virus particles showed that HeV G incorporation was 2.5 to 3.5 times higher in RABV-coHeVG virions than RABV-HeVG virions. notably we observed a slight increase in incorporation level at later harvests of the RABV-coHeVG virus with a concomitant slight reduction in RABV G levels. five groups of five Swiss Webster mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 1 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the live viruses and monitored for 28 days. the introduction and expression of HeV G into both vectors did not result in any increase in pathogenicity. serum samples were collected on day 85 and analyzed by ELISA. we purified the ectodomain of HeV G (sHeV G) from the supernatant of transiently transfected 293T cells. the results indicate that seroconversion against HeV G occurred as early as day 7 after vaccination with the BPL-inactivated RABV [RABV-HeVG (BPL), RABV-coHeVG (BPL) and all VSV-based vector codon-optimized HeV G increased HeV G-specific immunity for both live and inactivated RABV vaccines. the highest increase was measured for the VSV-coHevG BPL-inactivated vaccine, followed by the RABV-coHeVG BPL-inactivated vaccine. gG response against HeV G was highest for the VSV live vaccine (endpoint titer, 1:984,150) and about 10-fold less for the vaccines RABV-coHeVG and RABV-HeVG (endpoint titer, 1:109,000) the final sera (day 85) of the immunized mice was unaffected by the codon optimization of HeV G. sera from all mice immunized with killed or live HeV G vaccines induced VNA against Hendra virus (Table 1). the ELISA titers correlated to some extent with the neutralization titers, with less-pronounced differences in the HeV G-specific ELISA. the lower titers did not provide any neutralizing activity against the heterologous virus. ELISA analyzed the presence of anti-HeVG IgG1 and IgG2a. the graph shows the IgG2a/IgG1 EC50 ratio of the sera. RABV and VSV G response. stop-start transcription signal sequence flanked by unique XhoI and NheI restriction sites between the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes for introduction of foreign genes. rVSV has been used to develop immunization strategies against a large number of pathogens, including influenza virus (43), EBOV (44), and human immunodeficiency virus (45). rhabdoviral vectors expressing either wt or codon-optimized HeV G. we amplified the respective HeV G ORFs and inserted them into the RABV vector downstream of the RABV N gene. we then inserted them into the plasmid downstream of the VSV G gene using the XhoI and the NheI sites. a prominent monomeric protein band of 80 kDa was detected in all the vaccine vectors expressing HeV G. a prominent monomeric protein band of 80 kDa was detected in all the vaccine vectors expressing HeV G. this band disappeared after prolonged heating in reducing sample buffer. RABV-coHeVG incorporation was 2.5 to 3.5 times higher in RABV-coHeVG virions than RABV-HeVG virions. notably we observed a slight increase in incorporation level at later harvests of the RABV-coHeVG virus. we only obtained small differences for HeV G incorporation comparing VSV-coHeVG to VSV-HeVG. the introduction and expression of HeV G into both vectors (VSV-coHeVG and RABV-coHeVG) did not result in any increase in pathogenicity. there was also no pathogenicity observed with the control vector expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein (ZEBOV-GP) purified the ectodomain of HeV G (sHeV G) from the supernatant of transiently transfected 293T cells. the results indicate that seroconversion against HeV G occurred as early as day 7 after vaccination with the BPL-inactivated RABV [RABV-HeVG (BPL), RABV-coHeVG (BPL)] and all VSV-based vectors (live and killed RABV vaccine without the HeV G insert) codon-optimized HeV G increased HeV G-specific immunity for both live and inactivated RABV vaccines. highest increase was measured for the VSV-coHevG BPL-inactivated vaccine. RABV-coHeVG BPL-inactivated vaccine induced a higher HeV G-specific IgG titer on day 21 compared to day 14. endpoint titer was more similar for both the live and the killed RABV-based vaccine vectors. but the final titer for both the live and the killed RABV-based vaccine vectors was unaffected by the codon optimization of HeV G. the neutralization titers for the killed particles were very similar for RABV and VSV, whereas the lower titers did not provide any neutralizing activity against the heterologous virus. we further analyzed the composition of the total anti-HeVG IgG for IgG1 versus IgG2a classes. a slight decrease in vector-specific immune response was observed among the RABV-coHeVG vaccines expressing wt or coHeV G. the difference was quite significant for the RABV vaccines but much smaller for the VSV vaccines. the decision to use VSV and RABV vectors was based on their excellent safety record and their ability to induce neutralizing antibody responses against other viral pathogens. we also wanted to compare VSV and RABV vectors in parallel, which has not been done before. rhabdoviruses can incorporate foreign glycoproteins indiscriminately. this was true for the recombinant RABV vectors but not for the recombinant VSVs. this could be caused by the faster transport of VSV G (59) compared to RABV G (60), or the rapid replication cycle of VSV. RABV is a slow-growing virus that is likely neutralized before it can induce such high anti-HeV G humoral responses. rhabdoviral particles induced higher antibody titers than live vaccines with the highest antibody titers detected for VSV-based particles. this difference could influence the efficiency of uptake by dendritic cells, macrophages, or other antigen-presenting cells. this is not possible for the live vaccines due to the antivector immunity induced after the first inoculation and certainly explains the lower antibody titers elicited by the live viruses. previous studies have indicated that BALB/c mice have a predisposition for mounting a Th2-biased immune response (63)"}
