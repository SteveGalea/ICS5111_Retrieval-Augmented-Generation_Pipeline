{"summary": "PRF involves tRNA slippage either 5 (1) or 3 (+1) relative to the mRNA followed by continued translation in the new reading frame. there is growing recognition of PRF as a regulatory mechanism used by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. in vivo, the RNA helicase DDX17 modulates 1 PRF in HIV-1 [24]. the nucleotides immediately upstream of the slippery sequence can also affect the efficiency of 1 PRF [25\u201328] despite intensive investigation, the molecular details of 1 PRF remain uncertain. at least five plausible models have been proposed. stop codons are found at the intercodon position immediately 3 of slippery sequences in several backward frameshift elements. we have undertaken an extended analysis of the role of the intercodon in the full-length HIV-1 frameshift element [35] placed between two different luciferase reporters in mammalian cultures. human antizyme 1 (OAZ1) frameshift element of 120 nucleotides [7] was cloned into the pGL3s-hRLuc dual luciferase reporter vector. a control element for normalisation of data contained a nullified slippery sequence (CUUCUGA) with the 3 Luc + gene in the 0 frame. the suppressor tRNA vectors, ptRNAoc (UAA), ptRNAam (UAG) and ptRNAop (UGA) and the wild-type ptRNAser (serine) were made as described. a negative control (shve), containing a sequence with limited homology to any portion of the human genome was provided by the manufacturer. bicistronic fluorophore vectors were seeded into 24-well plates. transfection of 0.5 g reporter vector was performed at same time as seeding. cell lysates were incubated for 48 h after transfection of eRF1 and suppressor tRNA vectors. fluorescence was detected using 485 nm excitation/520 nm emission and 525 nm excitation/600 nm emission spectra. cDNA synthesis used total RNA (1 g) with 250 ng random primers (Roche) and 200 U SuperScriptTM III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) total protein (25 g) was separated by 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. membranes were stained with Ponceau S staining solution for 1\u20132 min. membranes were then blocked for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in TBST. bioinformatics HIV-1 sequences were downloaded from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and aligned with MAFFT. only sequences that encoded an intact, aligned slippery sequence (TTTTTTA) and that passed quality control checks were analysed. sequences with ambiguous base calls in the intercodon were excluded. eRF1 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) using PCR primers (5 -ggaattcaagatggcggacgaccccagtgctgct-3 and 5 -gctctagtagtagtagtagtagtcaaa-3) to create pcDNA-eRF1. two siRNA target sequences were cloned into the shRNA expression vector for transfection of the dual luciferase vectors, cells were harvested at 80% confluence and seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 2 or 4 104 cells/well. the reporter vector was transfected at 0.25 g; and eRF1, shRNA and suppressor tRNA vectors up to 1 g per well. cells were incubated for 48 h after transfection of eRF1 and suppressor tRNA vectors. relative light units were measured using an AutoLumat LB953 (EG&G Berthold). eRF1 and 18S rRNA transcript levels were determined using 2.5 ng of cDNA with a TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Assay (eRF1 assay Hs01. reactions were performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. expression levels were calculated using the comparative CT method of relative quantification. total protein content was determined by BCA assay [47] and verified by coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels. anti-actin (Sigma, 1:5000 dilution) and 2% (w/v) milk powder. the membranes were incubated (1 h at 4\u00b0C) with goat anti-rabbit\u2013HRP (Sigma, 1:5000 dilution) and washed (3, with TBST) eRF1 expression was quantified relative to -actin and the non-transfected control. the bacterial ribosomes and the slippery sequence of the HIV-1 group M frameshift element were the only other codon with significant frequency (0.8%). the remaining 0.3% may represent \u2018noise\u2019 from non-functional sequences not detected by the exclusion criteria. bacterial RF modulated frameshifting with codon specificity, implying that if slippage occurred during elongation it was when the intercodon was being decoded in the ribosomal A site. the 1 PRF constructs used in these studies, however, lacked the downstream stem-loop. _AA and UGA_U indicate the intercodon and the modification to the complementary sequences in the stem-loop. the mean standard error of the mean (SEM) for 18 replicates is shown. ***P = 0.001 compared to the GGG intercodon. the first base of the intercodon could affect frameshift efficiency by stacking on the A site codon (UUA) at the end of the slippery sequence as the ribosome stalls at the stem-loop. a purine would stack more easily than a pyrimidine due to its larger size. frameshift efficiency for the NGG (black) and NGA (grey) contexts shows the mean SEM for 33 replicates from five individual experiments in HEK293T cells. a strategy was used to evaluate the significance of eRF1 depletion on well-characterised translational systems. the physiological significance of reducing eRF1 was demonstrated with increased readthrough of 4.5-fold at the weak termination signal, UGACUG (P 0.001) this reduction resulted in a 30% increase in frameshift efficiency (P 0.01) at the natural antizyme frameshift element where frameshifting naturally occurs with a UGA intercodon. the cell was responding to the lowered concentration of eRF1 as expected. the mean SEM for a minimum of 10 replicates from at least two independent experiments is shown. a dotted line indicates the level of 1 PRF in the absence of any shRNA. the stop codon readthrough reporter system was utilised as before. cellular levels of eRF1 mRNA were increased 250-fold. eRF1 mRNA was increased 48 h after transfection. the mean SEM for four replicates (UGAAAG) or 12 replicates from three individual experiments (UGACUG) is shown. cells were transfected with either empty vector (black) or pcDNA-eRF1 (grey) the mean SEM for six replicates is shown. eRF1 is a general effector of 1 PRF frameshifting in HIV-1 when the intercodon is the natural GGG [55] we used suppressor tRNAs as an alternative decoding molecule of stop signals. if suppressor tRNAs modulated 1 PRF efficiency, competition must be occurring between the suppressor tRNA and the endogenous eRF1. readthrough of the efficient termination signals UAAAAG, UGAAAG and UGAAAG were measured in HEK293T cells with cognate suppressor, non-cognate suppressors and parent tRNASer as the negative control. all test stop signals allowed only 0.1% readthrough with co-expression of either the negative control tRNASer or the non-cognate suppressors. the UGA cognate suppressor was competitive with eRF1 at the +1 antizyme frameshift site and reduced frameshift efficiency from 25% to 10% (P 0.01) by contrast, with UGA or UAG as the intercodon, frameshift efficiency increased and with expected cognate specificity. this is consistent with functional studies demonstrating that mutations perturbing 1 PRF dramatically effect replication efficiency of HIV-1. the conserved consensus sequence of the 1 PRF element of HIV-1 is shown in Fig. 1A. 94.7% of sequences listed were GGG with G in this third position. the next most common codon was GGA (4.2%) and GGC was the only other codon with significant frequency (0.8%) bacterial ribosomes and the slippery sequence of the HIV-1 group M frameshift element replaced the natural GGG intercodon with a stop codon. the bacterial RF modulated frameshifting with codon specificity, implying that if slippage occurred during elongation it was when the intercodon was being decoded in the ribosomal A site. frameshift efficiency of the natural intercodon and variants is assayed with the dual luciferase reporter system. substituted stop codon and variants show the intercodon (grey) and any complementary stem-loop alterations (bold) the same relative results between these constructs were observed in a different bicistronic reporter system using the fluorophores EGFP and DsRed.T4 (S1 File) however, these data suggest that the GGG intercodon of the HIV-1 frameshift element influences frameshifting in at least two ways. frameshift efficiency is dependent on the identity of the first nucleotide of the intercodon. a strategy was used to evaluate the significance of eRF1 depletion on well-characterised translational systems. cellular eRF1 protein was depleted using two vector-expressed shRNA sequences. both shRNAs reduced eRF1 mRNA and protein expression similarly. eRF1 depletion resulted in 30% increase in frameshift efficiency. a dual luciferase construct with the two reporters in the same frame was co-transfected with the control and -eRF1 shRNAs. readthrough at the test stop signal was determined in each case (-eRF1 and control) the mean SEM for 12 replicates from three individual experiments is shown. shRNA technology aimed at reducing eRF1 concentrations caused unexplained effects for the frameshifting assay. eRF1 was over-expressed in cells with an alternative technology. eRF1 transcript levels measured using quantitative real-time PCR. results show non-transfected HEK293T cells (\u2018none\u2019) and those transfected with pcDNA-eRF1 vector or pcDNA3.1(+) with no insert (empty vector) the mean SD for six replicates is shown. increased concentration of eRF1 had no effect on frameshift efficiency in the naturally occurring HIV-1 1 PRF element that contains a non-cognate GGG intercodon. co-transfection with pcDNA-eRF1 resulted in a reduction of frameshift efficiency by 37% (P 0.01) and 20% (P 0.05), respectively. suppressor tRNAs modulated 1 PRF efficiency. if suppressor tRNAs modulated 1 PRF efficiency then competition must be occurring between suppressor tRNA and the endogenous eRF1 at the UGA intercodon within the ribosomal A site. frameshift efficiency was measured for the cognate, non-cognate, and control tRNAs. the mean SEM for four replicates (GGG) or six replicates (UGA and UGA_U) is shown. the UGA cognate suppressor reduced frameshift efficiency from 25% to 10% (P 0.01). this \u2018intercodon\u2019 is almost as highly conserved as the slippery sequence itself. the primary role of this \u2018intercodon\u2019 in supporting 1 PRF efficiency does not appear to be maintaining the structure of the lower stem-loop or stacking of its first nucleotide on the last codon of the slippery sequence. the control and test shRNAs both affected frameshifting with the native element. but neither affected the element where GGG was substituted with UGA. a slower translation rate increases frameshift efficiency in HIV-1. last codon of the slippery sequence has been found to be 20\u201330% phenylalanine and 70\u201380% leucine in the protein product of 1 PRF [3], [60], [61]. incorporation of leucine, by contrast, could occur either before or while the intercodon occupies the ribosomal A site. a modified model of frameshifting in HIV-1 We propose a modified model of frameshifting to accommodate a role for the intercodon in slip mRNA enters the ribosome 132 nucleotides from the first (+1) nucleotide of the P site codon [63], [65], [66]. the distance between the slippery sequence and the structural element has been implicated as contributing to frameshifting. a portion of ribosomes undergo canonical pre-translocational frameshifting. resistance created within the HIV-1 element would disrupt the progress of the ribosome. it is difficult to predict what the ribosome complex might look like in these atypical states created by the unusual elements within the RNA. ribosomal mutations that increase the rate of accommodation negatively affect 1 PRF efficiency. a second round of frameshifting would be facilitated by a partially distorted intercodon. different tRNAs would be predicted to have different binding capabilities to a distorted A site codon. a stop codon as the intercodon was artificially created for the HIV-1 site. the release factor has been shown to recognise disturbed stop codons in the ribosome. the release factor has been shown to recognise disturbed stop codons in the bacterial ribosome. the suppressor tRNA fell between relatively inefficient competitors of frameshifting such as the natural tRNAGly (GGG) and tRNATrp (UGG), and stronger competitor tRNAArg isoacceptors (for AGG/AGA and CGG/CGA). a minor fraction of the non-frameshifted product would be expected to bypass the 0-frame stop codon and terminate at a downstream stop signal by readthrough. the importance of the E site for frame maintenance has been established with bacterial ribosomes by analysis of the bacterial RF2 +1 frameshift mechanism. weaker E site tRNA interactions (A\u2022U rather than G\u2022C) correlate with higher +1 PRF in E. coli [74]. dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element. the dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element. dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element. loop abuts the ribosome [63] and has two mechanisms of helicase activity. prokaryotic elements contain an upstream internal Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence which helps pause the ribosome. differences underscore the diversity among 1 PRF elements found in nature. this \u2018intercodon\u2019 is almost as highly conserved as the slippery sequence itself. the primary role of this intercodon in supporting 1 PRF efficiency does not appear to be maintaining the structure of the lower stem-loop, or stacking of its first nucleotide on the last codon. eRF1 knockdown has been shown to affect 1 PRF efficiency in HIV-1. previously eRF1 knockdown has been shown to affect 1 PRF efficiency in HIV-1 with the GGG intercodon. incorporation of leucine, by contrast, could occur either before or while the intercodon occupies the ribosomal A site. a modified model of frameshifting in HIV-1 proposes a modified model of frameshifting to accommodate a role for the intercodon in slippage. mRNA enters the ribosome 132 nucleotides from the first (+1) nucleotide of the P site codon [63], [65], [66]. intercodon would be positioned at the entrance to the mRNA channel when the first nucleotide of the slippery sequence has just entered the A site. the distance between the slippery sequence and the structural element has been implicated as contributing to frameshifting [23], [64]. a portion of ribosomes undergo canonical pre-translocational frameshifting. in a substantial fraction of passages the translating ribosome would maintain the existing reading frame and would simply be \u2018slowed down\u2019 by the building tension. resistance created within the HIV-1 element would disrupt the progress of the ribosome. a second round of frameshifting would be facilitated by a partially distorted intercodon. different tRNAs would be predicted to have different binding capabilities to a distorted A site codon. a third base A (GGA, AGA and CGA intercodons) all produced significantly lower levels of frameshifting than their third-base G counterparts. the decoding molecule is not a tRNA but a protein release factor. the release factor has been shown to recognise disturbed stop codons in the ribosomal A site. this effect would depend upon the efficiency of decoding by the molecule during accommodation. the difference in frameshift efficiency observed in our system could be influenced by a difference in activity of the short form of the Renilla luciferase enzyme terminated at either the intercodon (if changed to a stop codon) or the downstream 0-frame stop codon. a minor fraction of the non-frameshifted product would be expected to bypass the 0-frame stop codon and terminate at a downstream stop signal by readthrough. the bacterial RF2 +1 frameshift mechanism relies on destabilisation of E site tRNA binding. three 16S rRNA mutations located in helices 21 and 22 increase 1 PRF with the HIV-1 element [26], and these are involved in E site tRNA binding. dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element. the dnaX and infectious bronchitis virus elements both contain a two-codon spacer between the slippery sequence and the structured RNA element. the ribosome has two mechanisms of helicase activity, which may differ with respect to these downstream structures. in the entry channel, prokaryotic elements contain an upstream internal Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence which helps pause the ribosome. there is known allosteric communication between the A site and the Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence, which may contribute to differences in the mechanism of 1 PRF in these cases. the 21.5 kDa molecular weight standard was marked as a doublet band in this transfer. the leftmost lane contains markers corresponding to molecular weight standards of 116.2 kDa, 97.4 kDa, 66.2 kDa, 45 kDa, 31 kDa, 21.5 kDa, and 14.4 kDa. two pooled replicates were tested, each containing cell lysate from four individually transfected wells. three technical replicates were made for each pooled sample. \u2018-ve\u2019, \u201890\u2019 and \u20181186\u2019 correspond to the shRNA vectors that were transfected.
