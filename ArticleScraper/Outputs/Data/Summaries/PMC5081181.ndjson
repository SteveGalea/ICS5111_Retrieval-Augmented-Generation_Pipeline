{"summary": "glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. an increase in resistance to aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm\u2019s canal causes ocular hypertension. there is no cure for glaucoma and the only effective therapy is lowering IOP. exosomes are released from TM cells in culture [14\u201316], yet their function in outflow physiology is unknown. proteomic analysis of TM cell exosomes showed that fibronectin (Fn) is an abundant component [16]. this is consistent with reports which have shown exosomal binding of Fn using a number of methods such as flowcytometry[17], capture of exosomes on immobilized Fn[13] and density gradient ultracentri dexamethasone treatment of TM explants significantly reduced the amount of these annexins per exosome. a drug causing ECM accumulation in the TM [4], ocular hypertension [25] and glaucoma in humans and animal models, alters exosomal cargo and properties. explants were cultured for 72 hours in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. media was collected and stored at -20\u00b0C prior to exosome purification. exosome isolation Three methods for exosome isolation were used for these studies. cleared supernatant was spun at 10,000 g for 40min at 4\u00b0C with a Beckman SW28 rotor. the resulting pellet was either resuspended in DPBS and directly used in subsequent centrifugation or for experiments involving digestion of heparan sulfate. resuspended pellets were centrifuged again at 100,000 g for 15min. thirty, 20 and 10% OptiPrep solutions were centrifuged at 100,000 g for 17hrs at 4\u00b0C. blots were removed and blots were washed 3 times, for 5 minutes with TBST. blots were then washed 3 times for 5 min in TBST and developed using chemiluminescent reagents (HyGLO; #E2400, Denville Scientific, South Plainfield, NJ) and X-ray film (#30\u2013101, Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) secondary antibody solution (goat anti-mouse HRP #115035146, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added and incubated for 1hr. membranes were then washed 3 times for 5min in TBST and developed using chemiluminescent reagents (HyGLO) and X-ray film. LC-MS/MS Serum-free conditioned media from human TM cells was collected and exosomes were prepared as described. the anterior portion of the eye tissue was bisected in a random orientation to yield two equal portions, prior to TM removal. each portion of the TM explant tissue was placed in one well of a 24-well plate in low glucose DMEM (dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagles\u2019s medium), containing 1% exosome-depleted FBS (fetal bovine serum) purified human plasma fibronectin or exosome-depleted FBS was added to cleared supernatant for a final concentration of 2.5 g/ml or 10% v:v. resulting pellet was either resuspended in DPBS or for experiments involving digestion of heparan sulfate. conditioned media (CM) was centrifuged at 3000 g for 15min. resuspended pellets were centrifuged again at 100,000 g for 70min. conditioned media was then centrifuged at 3000 g for 15min. membranes were blocked with 10% fat-free milk/water for 30min at room temp on a rocking platform. blocking solution was exchanged with primary antibody solutions. primary antibodies were removed and blots were washed 3 times for 5 min in TBST. exosome pellets were resuspended in DPBS with 0.1% and centrifuged at 100,000xg for 1hr to pellet insoluble proteins. resulting supernatant was incubated on a rotator with Heparin Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads overnight at 4\u00b0C. digested peptides were processed, identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS as previously described[28]. band intensity was determined using NIH ImageJ gel analysis tools. TM cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties consistent with exosomes. the majority of the TM explant EVs ranged between 1.07\u20131.10 g/ml. vesicles within this density range had a size distribution identical to exosomes. TM explants from six human donor eyes were cultured separately for 72 hours. dexamethasone decreases the amount of bound fibronectin to exosomes Exosomes are bound to fibronectin (Fn) [16, 33] TM cells secrete fibronectin and increase its secretion in response to corticosteroid treatment. we split TM tissue from a single donor eye into two equal portions. treatment of human trabecular meshwork (TM) explants with dexamethasone reduces the amount of exosome bound fibronectin (Fn) each half was cultured for 72 hours in control (Ctrl) media or media containing 100nM dexamethasone (Dex) exosomes were prepared from serum starved cells and probed for Fn abundance. only trace amounts of Fn were detected when TM conditioned media was incubated. TM cell exosomes are released without Fn but have the capacity to bind it once outside their parent cells. no syndecans were detected in the TM exosome proteome. a secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan was observed. results show a concentration-dependent increase in exosome-bound Fn. heparan sulfate mediates the binding of Fn to the exosomes. serum-free media conditioned by human TM cells for 2.5 hours was split into 7 equal portions. heparan sulfate was added at increasing log10 concentrations. mixtures were incubated for 1 hour on a rocker at room temperature. exosomes were lysed in 0.1% SDS, centrifuged to remove insoluble proteins. the supernatant was incubated with heparin sepharose beads. the beads were washed, and bound proteins were digested with trypsin. treatment of human trabecular meshwork (TM) explants with dexamethasone decreases the amount of exosomal annexins A2/A6 and dipeptidyl peptidase activity. intensity of immunoblot staining was measured with ImageJ, normalized to the number of vesicles loaded per lane. dexamethasone decreases exosomal dipeptidyl peptidase activity Fn-bound exosomes mediate a number of cell-matrix interactions including migration and invasion [18, 20], two processes dependent on podosomes/invadopodia and ECM digestion [10]. exosomes released from TM explants had significantly reduced levels of DPP4 activity compared to untreated controls. western blots show that the TM explant derived EVs contain annexin A2, A6 and lactadherin (MFG-E8). EVs released from the human TM explants ranged between 1.07\u20131.10 g/ml. the majority of the TM explant EVs ranged between 1.07\u20131.10 g/ml. TM cells secrete fibronectin and increase its secretion in response to corticosteroid treatment. western blots show that human TM explants responded to Dex treatment like TM cells in vitro [35], with increases in Fn and myocilin (Myoc) secretion. treatment of human trabecular meshwork (TM) explants with dexamethasone (Dex) reduces the amount of exosome bound fibronectin (Fn) each half was cultured for 72 hours in control (Ctrl) media or media containing 100nM dexamethasone (Dex) the intensity was normalized to the number of exosomes loaded per lane. control = 3.39E+08 particles and Dex = 3.49E+08 particles. bar graph is the meanSEM of six control and Dex treated Fn bands. exosomes were prepared from both portions (and from unconditioned media + FBS or purified Fn) the blots shown represent the results from a minimum 3 biological replicates (cell strains isolated from different human donors) a bacterial heparanase was shown to remove exosome-bound Fn. these data confirm that TM exosomes are released with a surface receptor for heparan sulfate that mediates binding of Fn to the exosomes. exosomes were lysed in 0.1% SDS, centrifuged to remove insoluble proteins and the resulting supernatant was incubated with heparin sepharose beads. the beads were washed and bound proteins were digested with trypsin for identification by LC-MS/MS. of the 4 proteins identified in both biological replicates, two known heparin binding proteins were identified. exosomes from dex treated human TM explants showed decreases in heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. a reduction in heparin/heparan sulfate binding proteins likely contributes to decreased Fn binding in exosomes from untreated explants. measured activity was fitted to a standard curve generated with known amounts of recombinant DPP4. dexamethasone decreases exosomal dipeptidyl peptidase activity Fn-bound exosomes are reported to mediate a number of cell-matrix interactions. explants significantly reduced TM exosome-Fn binding on exosomal surfaces. heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins plus the peptidase DPP4 are reduced upon treatment of explants with Dex. in the TM, impaired matrix degradation results in decreased aqueous humor drainage. our data support an additional mechanism by which Fn binds to exosomes in a complex of heparan sulfate and annexin proteins. from TM exosomes, we detected abundant expression of the HS/heparin-binding annexins A2 and A6 [23, 24]. exosomal annexins are likely due to an accumulation of annexins A2 and A6 in TM cell membrane following Dex treatment. we removed exosome bound Fn by enzymatically cleaving heparan sulfate. exosomes bind fibronectin through a mechanism similar to but distinct from the syndecan-1-mediated mechanism used by myeloma cell-derived exosomes. DPP4-truncated signaling molecules were shown to have reduced receptor affinity and efficacy compared to their full-length counterparts [54]. the reduction in exosomal DPP4 activity from dex treated TM explants may further reflect the general dysfunction in TM ECM homeostasis that results from Dex treatment. glaucoma, elevated levels of the cytokine TGF2 in aqueous humor have also been linked to pathological changes in the TM and glaucoma. the global effects of TGF2 on the TM are similar to those of dex. they include formation of CLANs, increased secretion of ECM components and accumulation of ECM material in the TM. our results connect the hallmark change in glaucomatous TM tissue, ECM accumulation, with the role of exosomes in cell-matrix interactions. this connection is not limited to Dex-induced changes in TM."}
