{"summary": "endothelial cells create a physical barrier on the luminal surface of blood and lymphatic vessels. this barrier must be traversed by blood-borne pathogens and immune cells trafficking between tissues and the bloodstream. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects endothelial cells in vivo. gammaherpesviruses are a lymphotropic family of viruses associated with a broad spectrum of malignancies and lymphoproliferative diseases. these oncogenic viruses persist for the life of the host by establishing and maintaining a latent infection. studying the human viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and KSHV in non-human systems does not mimic natural infection. in vitro infection of most cells with HV68 supports significant viral replication and results in complete cell lysis. fibroblasts were mostly lysed by 36\u201348 hours post-infection, but a significant percentage of infected endothelial cells remained intact. endothelial cells supported HV68 replication. endothelial cells are heterogeneous in nature, express unique surface antigens. cell were infected with either wildtype HV68 (A) or HV68-GFP (B) samples were multiply freeze-thawed prior to quantification by plaque assay. fluorescence was determined relative to cells infected with wildtype HV68 (grey) at six days post-infection, we collected non-adherent cells and cellular remains. the cells harvested from the infected endothelial cultures appeared as individual, intact cells suspended in culture. the material harvested from the infected fibroblast cultures appeared as clumps of cellular debris. prior to centrifugation, we measured cell viability by trypan blue exclusion. non-adherent cells were collected at six days post-infection. status of HV68 replication was determined at six days post-infection. cultures of non-adherent cells at 12 days post-infection were stained with PI. viability determined by flow cytometry as percent PI negative cells. cells collected at six days post-infection were analyzed as a positive control. PI staining of post-infection endothelial cells revealed 92.5% of the cells harvested were intact and viable. infection of endothelial cells with HV68 resulted in a population of cells that escaped lysis and remained intact as far as 12 days post-infection. MB114 cells were analyzed for gp150 surface expression by flow cytometry. fluorescence was determined relative to unstained cells (grey) histograms are representative of two independent infections. intact endothelial cells were productively infected. pol III-1 and M2 transcripts were detected in infected MB114 cells at 24 and 36 hours post-infection. but not at six and 12 days post-infection. cyclophilin A was detected at six days post-infection in 3T3 fibroblasts and MB114 cells. endothelial cells which remained intact after HV68 infection expressed early and late lytic proteins. these cells also expressed viral proteins indicative of active viral replication, and not latency. the intact endothelial cells harvested at six days post-infection were indeed infected. HV68 infection contained virions at various stages post-infection throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. MB114 cells produced and released new infectious virus particles. aliquots of the supernatants were collected for measurement of cell-free virus. cell-free supernatant from infected MB114 cells yielded significant viral titer. titer was significantly higher than that of supernatant taken from 3T3 cultures. endothelial cells continued to release new infectious virions for at least 12 days post-infection. MB114 cells were stained with CFSE and analyzed by flow cytometry. unstained cells analyzed in parallel were consistent in autofluorescence throughout the analysis. MB114 cells demonstrated a drop in CFSE signal intensity after six days in culture. at the time of harvest, MB114 cells also demonstrated a drop in CFSE signal intensity consistent with multiple cell divisions. endothelial cells which remained intact after HV68 underwent multiple rounds of proliferation. the percentage of cells expressing gp150 did not change markedly with time. these data indicate that the vast majority of viable, infected endothelial cells were undergoing active viral replication. uninfected MB114 cells exhibited a broad range of light scatter. MB114 cells treated with phophonoacetic acid (PAA) were altered in surface protein expression after HV68 infection. uninfected and infected MB114 cells harvested at six days post-infection were analyzed by flow cytometry. HV68 infection of endothelial cells resulted in a population of intact cells which persisted in culture as non-adherent cells. this outcome is influenced by viral DNA replication and/or late gene synthesis. we measured expression of the HV68 v-cyclin in infected endothelial cells and infected fibroblasts.

MB114 cells showed a drop in CFSE signal intensity after six days in culture. at the time of harvest, MB114 cells also showed a drop in CFSE signal intensity consistent with cell divisions. endothelial cells which remained intact after HV68 underwent multiple rounds of proliferation. infected and viable endothelial cells were altered in size, shape, and surface protein expression after HV68 infection. the percentage of cells expressing gp150 did not change markedly with time. these cells were neither latently infected nor had escaped infection. MB114 cells were altered in size and granularity by HV68 infection. uninfected and infected MB114 cells harvested at six days post-infection were analyzed for cell surface expression of Thy1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. endothelial cell viability after HV68 infection is reduced. a population of intact cells persisted in culture as non-adherent cells. this outcome is influenced by viral DNA replication and/or late gene synthesis. MB114 cells were infected with wildtype (black) or v-cyclin.STOP HV68 (grey) at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell. cells were harvested at six days post-infection and cultured as described. cultures of MB114 cells infected with wildtype virus were 48.5% viable at day six, 79.4% (0.36 SEM) viable at day nine, 91.3% (0.26 SEM) at day 12, and 62.2 % (1.33 SEM) at day 15 post-infection. in the absence of the v-cyclin, endothelial cell viability was significantly impaired after HV68 infection. primary endothelial cells were infected in vivo, and ex vivo demonstrated prolonged viability while supporting HV68 growth. primary endothelial cells were isolated from C57/BL6 mouse lungs and characterized as per previously published methods. samples were multiply freeze-thawed prior to quantification by plaque assay on NIH 3T12 cells. at 0, 48, 96, and 120 hours post-infection, trypan blue exclusion counts performed (B) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary lung endothelial cells did not differ significantly in viability (p>0.05) at 48 hours post-infection with wildtype HV68, primary lung endothelial cells were significantly more viable than MEFs (p0.001). PCR analysis with single copy sensitivity for HV68 gene50 (Rta) was performed to determine the frequency of viral genome positive cells in the CD31-enriched and remaining CD31-depleted lung cell populations. surprisingly large proportion of lung endothelial cells were viral genome positive following in vivo infection. pol III-1 detection was comparable between endothelial enriched and CD31-depleted lung cell populations. this suggests that detection of this viral transcript was not due a few contaminating infected non-endothelial cells. this conserved outcome of endothelial cell infection. thelial cell infection is particularly striking given that endothelial cells display phenotypic heterogeneity in structure and function depending on anatomic location. endothelial cells serve as a natural site of infection and possible viral reservoir of HCMV [36]\u2013[40], suggesting a role for HCMV-infected endothelial cells in viral spread and persistence. in vitro, endothelial cell infection with KSHV is predominantly latent [43], [49]\u2013[51] but when these cells are transferred into mice, they show evidence of lytic gene expression and virus production. the HV68 v-cyclin is required for optimal endothelial cell viability after HV68 infection in vitro. cyclin promotes endothelial cell viability is unknown at this time. it is very likely that additional viral genes facilitate persistent endothelial cell infection. lead candidates include the anti-apoptotic viral bcl-2 gene M11 and the viral GPCR (ORF 74) class I, PE-CAM (CD31), and ICAM-1 (CD54), but not LFA-3 (CD58) or Fas (CD95), and the viral genes K3 and K5 have been demonstrated to regulate this outcome. the contribution of the mK3 gene of HV68 to persistent endothelial cell infection remains untested. a recent report of host cell response to HV68 in three different cell types identified 148 genes whose expression was altered in endothelial precursor cells in vitro studies implicated endothelial cells as a persistent source of virus production. however, the extent to which endothelial cells contribute to HV68 persistence in vivo are important issues that remains to be addressed. gammaherpesvirus infection provides an additional mechanism, beyond latency, by which gammaherpesviruses can achieve long-term propagation. mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from C57/BL6 mice as previously described [70]. all infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 plaque forming units (PFU) per cell. inoculum was removed after one hour of infection at 37\u00b0C. cell monolayers rinsed three times with sterile phosphate buffered saline. cells were counted every three days of culture, and adjusted to a concentration of 5105 viable cells/mL. supernatants were collected every six days of culture and analyzed by plaque assay. samples were thawed, serially diluted, and plated onto NIH 3T12 cells in 12 well plates in triplicate. infection was performed at 37\u00b0C for one hour.
