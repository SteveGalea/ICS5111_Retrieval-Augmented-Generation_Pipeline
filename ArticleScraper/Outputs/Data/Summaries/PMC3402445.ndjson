{"summary": "human norovirus (HuNoV), a single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus, is a member of the Caliciviridae family. the virus is the leading pathogen causing food- or water-borne gastroenteritis. they account for approximately 58% of the foodborne illnesses caused by 31 different bacteria, parasites and viruses. gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs are susceptible to oral infection by a GII.4 HuNoV strain (HS66/2001/US) [16], [17] and an emerging GII.12 HuNoV strain (HS206/2010/US) [11], imply a host factor affecting infection by certain genogroups or genotypes of HuNoV. different HBGA phenotypes (A or H) were shown to influence susceptibility of Gn pigs to HuNoV infection [19] in a norwalk virus (GI.1) replicon-harboring cell system, the viral RNA and protein levels were increased after treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs, such as simvastatin. these results indicated that cholesterol pathways may be associated with enhanced replication of HuNoV in vitro. simvastatin-treated pigs had significantly decreased serum cholesterol levels (81.57.5 to 90.47.4 mg/dL) at 8 to 14 days after treatment began, which were 1.6 to 2.4 times lower than the levels in the untreated pigs. LDLR gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR at 12 and 24 hours after treatment. each bar represents the mean SEM. different letters denote significant differences between groups at each time-point. the mean daily fecal HuNoV titers were compared statistically between simvastatin-treated and untreated pigs in each trial. significantly higher viral RNA titers were detected in simvastatin-treated pigs than untreated pigs in trial 1 (5.440.16 log10 genomic equivalents (GE)/ml vs. 4.790.05 log10 GE/ml] (P0.01). 0.05 for Simvastatin + HuNoV vs HuNoV alone or for A+ pigs vs H+ pigs. dotted line indicates detection limit (4.7 log10 GE/ml) of qRT-PCR. fecal virus shedding is a result of HuNoV replication and infection. the HBGA antigens were distributed on the surface or in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining the intestine, the salivary glands, and pulmonary (bronchial) and renal tubular epithelial cells. despite the higher expression levels of A antigens, significantly lower viral RNA titers. no difference was observed between the simvastatin-treated, A+ and H+ pigs. simvastatin inhibits the capacity of macrophages or dendritic cells to produce IFN- after stimulation with poly (I:C) simvastatin + poly (I:C)-treated intestinal macrophages at 24 hours after poly (I:C) treatment were significantly lower (P0.01) compared to those (93.315.3 U/ml) after poly (I:C) treatment alone. a representative flow cytometric profile is illustrated in Fig. 5B and C. cells were harvested at 24 hours afters poly (I:C) treatment. cells were stained intracellularly for TLR3. a total of 5104 events were analyzed. IFN- was not detectable (20 U/ml) in cells treated with either simvastatin alone or mock. Neither the IRF3 nor NFB singaling pathway appears to be involved in decreased IFN- responses. mRNA expression levels of IRF3 (A) and NFB (B) in simvastatin-treated macrophages were measured by qRT-PCR. each bar represents the mean SEM. nhIFN-treated pigs showed significantly lower qRT-PCR-positive rate. nhIFN-treated pigs showed significantly higher viral shedding titers. no negative control pigs shed detectable viral RNA in feces. five or six day-old piglets were treated orally with 300 IU of nhIFN- once a day from PID -1 to PID 4. after nhIFN- treatment or HuNoV inoculation, clinical signs and fecal virus shedding were monitored daily until shedding terminated. simvastatin treatment lowers serum cholesterol level in Gn pigs. pigs were inoculated with HuNoV at 6 days after treatment. each bar represents the mean SEM. at 12 and 24 hours after treatment with 80 M simvastatin, LDLR gene expression levels were significantly increased compared to 0 to 20 M treated groups. simvastatin-treated pigs began shedding at mean post-inoculation day (PID 1.90.2), compared to mean PID 4.80.7 in untreated pigs (P0.01). 0.05 log10 GE/ml (P0.01) and Trial 2 (5.270.10 log10 GE/ml vs.4.970.07 log10 GE/ml) (P0.05) no significant difference was observed in Trial 3. PCR results were negative for 3 consecutive days. no pronounced histological changes were evident in the small and large intestines of Gn pigs or as a side-effect after oral treatment with high-doses of simvastatin in controls. under our experimental conditions no HuNoV-infected pigs showed diarrhea, while mild diarrhea was observed in all of the statin-treated pigs up to 5 days after statin treatment. the HBGA antigens were distributed on the surface or in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining the intestine, the salivary glands, and pulmonary (bronchial) and renal tubular epithelial cells. no significant differences in the onset and duration of fecal virus shedding were found between the A+ and H+ pigs. IFN- was not detected in culture supernatants of macrophages or DCs treated with either simvastatin only or mock. in porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages, IFN- levels (50.013.4 U/ml) were significantly lower than those of poly (I:C) only-treated PAMs at 24 hours after poly (I:C) treatment. the cell culture supernatants were harvested to measure IFN- levels (A) by biological assay at 4 and 24 hours afters poly (I:C) treatment. PBMC-derived macrophages were first treated with 1 M simvastatin, and 24 hours later, were treated with either simvastatin (1 M) or poly (I:C) (25 g/ml) post-treatment hour Mean IFN- levels ( SEM)a in U/ml Intestinal macrophages PBMC-derived macrophages b Poly (I:C) alone Simvastatin + poly(I:C) Poly (I:C) alone Simvastatin + poly(I:C) Poly (I:C) alone Simvastatin + poly(I:C) Poly (I:C) alone Simvastatin + poly(I:C) Poly (I: simvastatin alone did not induce IFN- production in PAMs. increased expression of IRF3 and NFB genes was found in simvastatin-treated PAMs. mRNA expression levels of IRF3 (A) and NFB (B) were reduced in simvastatin-treated macrophages. fecal HuNoV replication in the gut of infected Gn pigs was enhanced in vivo. treatment with natural human IFN- reduced or curtailed virus shedding in treated animals. treatment significantly delayed the onset of virus shedding by 1.7 day in treated pigs. shedding titers were noted in the nhIFN-treated pigs (5.180.08 log10 GE/ml), compared to the untreated pigs (4.920.05 log10 GE/ml) at PIDs 5\u201318, there were no significant differences in the duration of fecal virus shedding and the qRT-PCR-positive rate of the fecal samples tested between the nhIFN--treated pigs and untreated nhIFN-treated and untreated pigs were analyzed based on nhIFN- treatment period, i.e. during treatment at PIDs 1\u20134; post-treatment at PIDs 5\u201318; and overall at PIDs 1\u201318. each bar represents the mean SEM. a chimpanzee model was recently established to evaluate the efficacy of VLP-derived vaccines against infection with GI or GII HuNoVs. the chimpanzee model is compromised by the lack of chimpanzees, and the finding that oral infection of chimpanzees with HuNoVs failed to induce gastroenteric disease comparable to human cases. hepatic enzymes act as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. statins lower serum cholesterol levels in Gn pigs, possibly due to similar cholesterol pathways between swine and humans. a paper describing more detailed and comprehensive in vitro cell culture findings is in preparation by Takanashi et al. (unpublished data, 2012) simvastatin inhibited innate immunity and inhibited production of IFN-induced by poly (I:C) in PAMs or intestinal DCs. gene expression levels of IRF3 and NFB in poly (I:C) only-treated cells were reduced remarkably. a similar result did not occur in simvastatin + poly (I:C)-treated cells. a similar result did not occur in simvastatin + poly (I:C)-treated cells. nhIFN- is formulated to be stable at low pH of the stomach. degradation of nhIFN- appears to be slow enough to allow nhIFN- to reach some IFN- receptors of cells in mucosal lymphoid tissues of the oral cavity and intestine. test of nhIFN- as an antiviral for HuNoV using the Gn pig model also revealed that IFN- has potential as a HuNoV antiviral therapy. new knowledge on the antiviral mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity. pigs and A/H Phenotyping Near-term pigs were derived by hysterectomy. we determined the A/H phenotype on fresh bucal cells or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded intestinal and salivary glandular tissues of pigs. treatment or HuNoV inoculation, we monitored clinical signs and fecal virus shedding daily until shedding terminated. piglets were randomly assigned to one of three groups and constituted 2 independent trials: nhIFN-treated, HuNoV-infected, nhIFN-untreated, HuNoV-infected, and negative control. the chloroform phase was separated, mixed with a 1100 volume of polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), dried, and resuspended in the assay reaction buffer in the kit. each treatment was duplicated in additional six-well plates. the recombinant baculoviruses (rBac-HS194) were propagated to prepare virus stocks with high titers for routine VLP expression. the recombinant baculoviruses (rBac-HS194) were propagated to prepare virus stocks with high titers for routine VLP expression. the production and purification of HS194 VLPs were performed as described previously. guinea pig hyperimmune antisera to VLPs of the GII.4 HuNoV HS194. cell culture supernatants were harvested at 4 and 24 hours after poly (I:C) treatment. non-adherent cells were seeded onto 12-well cell plates. cells were treated with simvastatin in the same manner as for PAMs. cell supernatant samples, serially diluted 12 in MEM, were added. mRNA expressions normalized to expression levels of porcine -actin [54]. LDLR, -actin and probes of LDLR and -actin were designed by Geneious primer design software. titers that were undetectable were assigned as a value of 4.7 log10 GE/ml for statistical analysis. the duration of virus shedding and viral titers in nhIFN-treated and untreated pigs was analyzed based on nhIFN--treated and untreated pigs. a value of P0.05 was considered statistically significant. the IPEC-J2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium/Nutrient Ham\u2019s Mixture F-12. experimental Pig Infection and Treatment with Simvastatin Piglets were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Simvastatin + HuNoV (n = 11), HuNoV alone (n = 10), Mock (n = 4), and Simvastatin alone (n = 4). piglets were treated orally with 8 mg/day/pig (approximately 1 kg of body weight) piglets were randomly assigned to one of three groups and constituted 2 independent trials. five or six day-old piglets were infected orally with 300 IU of nhIFN- once a day from PID -1 to PID 4. clinical signs and fecal virus shedding were monitored daily until shedding terminated. the GII HuNoV fecal shedding titers were determined by the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (COG2F/2R primer set and RING2 probe) the detection limit of this PCR assay was 10 GE per reaction determined based on the standard curve generated using serially diluted plasmid DNA. the expression of HS194 capsid proteins in the Sf9 cells and culture supernatants was examined by immunoblot using the guinea pig antiserum against Hu/NoV/GII.4/HS66/2001/US strain. the recombinant baculoviruses (rBac-HS194) were propagated to prepare virus stocks with high titers for routine VLP expression. cells (48105 cells/well) were seeded onto 12-well cell plates. the wells were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups. no treatment, Simvastatin alone, Simvastatin + poly (I:C) and Poly (I:C) alone. in + poly (I:C), and Poly (I:C) cells were grown in MEM with 5% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. the cell supernatant samples, serially diluted 12 in MEM, were added to the confluent cell monolayers seeded in 96-well plates. nhIFN-treated and untreated pigs were analyzed based on nhIFN- treatment period. nhIFN-treated and untreated pigs were analyzed based on nhIFN- treatment period. the exact test was used to compare the PCR-positive rates of the fecal samples tested at PIDs 1\u20134 or PIDs 5\u201318. a value of P0.05 was considered statistically significant."}
