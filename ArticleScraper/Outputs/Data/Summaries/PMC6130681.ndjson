{"summary": "immune cells, such as macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils, use special receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize pathogen-derived material by its molecular pattern. activated receptors transduce several intracellular signaling cascades, such as those associated with Src, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), AKT (protein kinase B), inhibitor of IB kinas torilidis fructus is an upright hedge parsley distributed throughout Japan, Korea, and China. its anti-angiogenic activity, immune-enhancing activity, and antiviral activity have been reported. torilidis fructus has antibacterial activity toward several types of bacteria. PP2 was obtained from Callbiochem (La Jolla, CA) the enzyme immunoassay kit for determining PGE2 levels was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). a luciferase construct containing the binding promoter for NF-B was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. antibodies against total protein and phosphoprotein for Flag, p65/NF-B, p50/NF-B, Akt, IB, p85/PI3K, Syk, Src, lamin A/C, and -actin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. 4.7 and HEK293T cells were cultured in RPMI1640 media and DMEM. they were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (Gibco, NY), glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells were plated at 1 106 cells/mL on a 96-well plate, incubated for 18 h. cytotoxic effect of Tf-EE was evaluated using a conventional MTT assay. cells were incubated for 4 h and sodium dodecyl sulphate was added to each well. mRNA analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 g of plasmid containing -galactosidase (as a control) and NF-B Luc. transfections were performed using the PEI method in 6-well plates. cells were treated with Tf-EE for the final 24 h of each experiment. on X-100; 10% glycerol; 10 g/mL aprotinin; 10 g/mL pepstatin; 1 mM benzamide; and 2 mM PMSF. resuspended in nuclear protein extraction buffer A (10 mM HEPES with KOH, pH 7.8; 10 mM KCl; 2 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM EDTA; 1 mM D the HPLC mobile phases were H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) as an aqueous mobile phase (A), and 95% MeCN with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and 5% H2O as an organic mobile phase (B). similar experimental data were also obtained in an additional independent set of in vitro experiments that were performed with the same number of samples. cells were plated at 1 106 cells/mL on a 96-well plate, incubated for 18 h. cells were pretreated with either Tf-EE or other standard compounds. the inhibitory effects of Tf-EE on LPS-induced NO production were determined by measuring NO levels. 10 L of MTT solution (10 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) was added to the cell culture media. cells were incubated for 4 h and 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate was added to each well to solubilize the formazan. mRNA analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells with TRIzol Reagent. transfected cells were transfected with 1 g of plasmid containing -galactosidase (as a control) and NF-B Luc in the presence or absence of an inducing molecule, Flag-MyD88. cells were treated with Tf-EE for the final 24 h of each experiment. RAW264.7 cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES with KOH, pH 7.8; 10 mM KCl; 2 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM EDTA; 1 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM EDTA; 1 mM DTT; 0.1 mM PMSF; and 2 g/mL aprotinin) the HPLC mobile phases were H2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) as an aqueous mobile phase (A), and 95% MeCN with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and 5% H2O as an organic mobile phase (B). the gradient conditions were as follows: 0\u201350 min, 100% A; 50\u201360 min, 50% A. effect of a standard inhibitor known to block enzyme activity of NOS in LPS-treated macrophages indicated that the experimental environment was reliable. we determined the level of another inflammatory mediator, PGE2 by ELISA assay. there was no significant toxic effect on cell viability at up to a 75 g/mL dose of Tf-EE. mRNA levels were first assessed by RT-PCR. iNOS and COX-2 mRNA levels were suppressed by treatment with Tf-EE. IL-1 expression was slightly decreased by Tf-EE. mRNA levels of iNOS, COX-2, and IL-1 were measured by RT-PCR. NF-B activation was determined in NF-B Luc and -gal plasmid co-transfected HEK293T cells in the absence of CFP-TRIF or Flag-MyD88. Tf-EE suppressed levels of p-Src at 3 and 5 min after LPS treatment. levels of total protein and phosphoprotein of IB, AKT, Syk, Src and -actin were determined by immunoblotting. levels of p-Src, HA, p-p85, p85 and -actin in whole cell lysates were determined by immunoblotting. p-p85 and p-Src complex formation was suppressed by Tf-EE in HEK293T cells under the presence of Flag-MyD88. phosphorylation of Src was inhibited by Tf-EE in transfected HEK293T cells under the presence of Flag-MyD88. NO production from LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells was strongly inhibited by a specific inhibitor of Src, PP2, Tf-EE suppressed production of NO in LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages. NO levels were similarly suppressed by Tf-EE treatment in a dose-dependent manner, up to 90% at a dose of 75 g/mL. the dose-dependent NO inhibitory effect of L-NAME indicated that the experimental environment was reliable. mRNA levels were first assessed by RT-PCR. LPS strongly increased iNOS, COX-2 and IL-1 at the mRNA level in RAW264.7 cells. iNOS and COX-2 mRNA levels were suppressed by Tf-EE treatment. EE dose dependently suppressed said activity in HEK293T cells. levels of nuclear p65 and p50, which compose NF-B, were determined by nuclear fractionation and immunoblotting. Tf-EE suppressed levels of p-Src at 3 and 5 min after treatment with Tf-EE. levels of p-Src, HA, p-p85, p85 and -actin in whole cell lysates were determined by immunoblotting. NO levels were measured via Griess assay. we assessed whether Tf-EE directly inhibited the phosphorylation of p85. this is affected by the phosphorylation of Src and activates the NF-B pathway. anti-inflammatory activity of torilidis fructus was tested at the cellular level in LPS-activated macrophages. Tf-EE effectively suppressed upregulation of NO and PGE2 levels. also suppression of the NF-B pathway was found. phosphorylation of IB at 5 min during LPS stimulation is regulated by the tyrosine kinases Syk and Src. treatment with Tf-EE suppressed the level of p-Src at 3 and 5 min after treatment. events downstream of Src, such as phosphorylation of p85 in HEK293 cells, were definitively inhibited by Tf-EE treatment. Tf-EE seemed to have anti-inflammatory activity on macrophages. it was important to determine the active components of Tf-EE. luteolin was recently found to directly bind to the ATP-binding domain SH1 of Src. f-EE in the suppression of NO at the transcriptional level in LPS-activated macrophages. this anti-inflammatory activity was triggered by inhibition of the Src/NF-B pathway. the authors report no conflicts of interest."}
