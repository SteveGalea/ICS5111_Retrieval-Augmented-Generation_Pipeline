{"summary": "nasopharyngeal swab samples from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from 199 subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. the presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p0.0004) complete genome sequencing of 26 samples representing both severe and mild cases of disease from Argentina did not reveal evidence consistent with development of a more virulent phenotype. a third factor we considered was bacterial and viral coinfection. a third factor we considered was bacterial and viral coinfection. four of these patients (80%) had severe disease; 1 had mild disease (p = 0.0056) the age groups typically associated with greater risk of influenza-related complications were also at higher risk for more severe disease in the context of H1N1pdm. 6 or >55 years 14 (41.2)** 12 (8.2) 26 (14.4) Low risk: 6\u201355 years 20 (58.8) 135 (91.8) 155 (85.6) SEX Subjects with available sex data 35 (89.7) 149 (93.1) 184 (92.5) Female 15 (42.9) 89 (59.7) 104 (56.5) Male 20 (57.1) 60 (40.3) 80 (43.5) ANTI-MICROBIAL STATUS Subjects with available drug data 29 (7 human rhinovirus (HRV) A (n = 1) and B (n = 4);

p = 0.0085); other viruses, including RSV B, HRV and HCoV, were also infrequent (9 of 199 cases, 4.5%); only 1 such case (HRV B) had severe disease. agents detected were inversely related to severe disease outcomes. results were not significant for subjects with high age-associated risk (6 or >55 years of age) in all cases, the only influenza virus found was H1N1pdm. the presence of S. pneumoniae was associated with severe disease. 104 of 199 cases (52.3%) harbored the agent. pneumoniae or H. influenzae in their NPS samples, 44 had mild disease (97.8%; p = 0.0004). p = 0.0004; p = 0.0085; p = 0.0017. no evidence of other viral respiratory pathogens in any subjects. the presence of RSV A, though relatively infrequent, was more common in severe (6 of 39 cases, 15.4%) than in mild disease (5 of 160 cases, 3.1%; p = 0.0085). only 1 such case (HRV B) had severe disease. the presence of a risk-associated medical condition was associated with increased risk of severe disease (OR [95% CI], 15.31 [1.21, 193.49], p = 0.0358) the total number of agents detected was inversely related to severe disease outcomes (OR [95% CI], 0.11 [0.03, 0.38; p = 0.0005) the presence of S. pneumoniae in NPS predicts severe disease outcome. the risk associated with S. pneumoniae is particularly prominent in 6-to-55 year-old individuals. the risk associated with S. pneumoniae is particularly prominent in 6-to-55 year-old individuals. neuraminidase has been shown to strip sialic acid residues to expose pneumococcal receptors on respiratory epithelium [11]. neuraminidase is correlated with the capacity of an influenza virus strain to promote pneumonia [12]. neuraminidase is important in pathogenesis and prognosis of H1N1pdm-associated disease. subjects and Specimens Samples for this study were 199 H1N1pdm-positive NPS specimens collected at ANLIS in Buenos Aires, Argentina. subjects were randomly selected for analysis from two types of repository specimens maintained by ANLIS and collected during standard H1N1pdm surveillance procedures. 23 FLUBV (0.2%), 161 HPIV (1.7%) and 48 HAdV (0.5%) cases of severe acute respiratory disease. 39 NPS specimens were selected randomly from a total of 1769 severe cases. both groups were collected from 6/23/2009 to 7/4/2009. logistic regression model was stratified by age risk category. outcome of interest was disease severity (severe disease: hospitalized or fatal H1N1pdm cases; mild disease: non-hospitalized, nonfatal community H1N1pdm cases) deidentified clinical information provided to ANLIS from hospital and point-of-care institutions on the basis of their review of charts in their own institutions. subjects and Specimens Samples for this study were 199 H1N1pdm-positive NPS specimens collected at ANLIS in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 1496 infections (15.6% out of 9595 virus-positive cases) were reported by the argentian national respiratory disease surveillance system. 7867 FLUAV (82.0%; 6331 H1N1pdm, 1535 without typing information), 23 FLUBV (0.2%), 161 HPIV (1.7%) and 48 HAdV (0.5%) cases of severe acute respiratory disease. statistics group comparisons were conducted using nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) for continuous data deviating from normal distributions. results of interest were disease severity (severe disease: hospitalized or fatal H1N1pdm cases; mild disease: non-hospitalized, nonfatal community H1N1pdm cases)"}
