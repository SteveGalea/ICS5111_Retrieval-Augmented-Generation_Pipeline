{"summary": "the ESSENCE server collects de-identified data from the central database every 8 hours. in most locations, 80% of all ICD-9 codes are received within 4 days. most syndromes are published as daily counts, but the ILI syndrome is grouped as weekly data. without obstruction 4 464.20 Laryngopharyngitis, acute 4 465.8 Infectious upper respiratory, multiple sites, acute NOS 4 466.0 Bronchitis, acute 3 466.11 Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus 3 466.19 Bronchiolitis, acute, due to other infectious organism 3 478.9 Disease, upper respiratory NEC/NOS 4 480.0 Pneumonia due to adenovirus 2 480.1 Pneu all MTFs are encouraged to submit specimens on a year-round basis. but sentinel sites are specifically directed to submit 6\u201310 specimens per week during the official influenza season, week 40 in the first year through week 20 in the second year (generally October through early May). the program guidelines state that specimens should only be obtained from patients meeting a clinical case definition of ILI. the more specific (for influenza first and other diseases second) or severe code was used. if no ILI codes were used for the visit, the code closest to an infectious respiratory diagnosis was used. we gave priority to infectious disease or respiratory codes first, to general symptoms second, to other diagnoses third. we then measured the frequency of positive viral specimens by ICD-9 code. the ratio of signal-to-noise evaluated whether individual codes would provide a good signal during the influenza season. we used 4 separate criteria to select the best performing ICD-9 codes. we created 2 new groupings, 1 with high-volume codes (ILI-large) and 1 with low-volume codes (ILI-small) ESSENCE data collection ESSENCE captures outpatient visit data recorded as ICD-9 codes at or shortly after the patient encounter (10). a central, secure-link electronic database allows for daily submission of data, although reporting time from the MTFs averages from 1 to 4 days. ESSENCE server collects de-identified data from the central database every 8 hours. most syndromes are published as daily counts, but the ILI syndrome is grouped as weekly data. ESSENCE calculates the percentage of visits for ILI among the total number of outpatient primary care and emergency department visits. adenovirus 2 480.1 Pneumonia due to parainfluenza 2 480.8 Pneumonia due to virus NEC 2 480.9 Viral pneumonia unspecified 2 484.8 Pneumonia in other infectious disease NEC 2 485 Bronchopneumonia, organism NOS 2 486 Pneumonia, organism NOS 2 487.0 Influenza with pneumonia 1 487.1 Influenza with respiratory manifestation NEC 1 487.8 Influenza with manifestation NEC 1 487.8 Influenza we matched individual specimens with outpatient clinic visits that occurred within a 5-day range around the date of specimen collection by using a unique patient code that links the records but does not identify the patient. if no ILI codes were used for the visit, the code closest to an infectious respiratory diagnosis was used. we compared the trend of the DOD-wide specimens to the trends of each individual ICD-9 code. we then measured the association between individual and grouped ILI codes with the positive viral specimens through both standard and lagged correlation analysis. we created 2 new groupings, 1 with high-volume codes (ILI-large) and 1 with low-volume codes (ILI-small) we defined high-volume codes as being used >50 per day on average or >75,000 during the 4-year study period. the model treats holidays and weekends differently from the days following them. ESSENCE ILI is defined as a \"fever (temperature of 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0) plus either a cough or a sore throat, in the absence a known cause other than influenza\" we analyzed the trends and correlation between weekly DOD-wide ESSENCE ILI groupings and nationwide CDC data during 3 influenza seasons. match day No. specimens did not match (removed from study) 1,153 Clinic day \u2013 2 = specimen day 47 Clinic day \u2013 1 = specimen day 125 Exact day match 5,267 Clinic day + 1 = specimen day 680 Clinic day + 2 = specimen day 117 Total 7,389 *ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision.

CDC now monitors ILI by using the same DOD data within the bioSense system. the weekly data are reported in ESSENCE immediately on completion of a full week, whereas the lab data have an inherent lag time because of the time required for specimen shipping, laboratory testing, analysis, and reporting. the automated data collection also allows for the potential to analyze data more frequently than the current weekly standard. developers perform critical analysis of the individual codes collected in their data. our own evaluation illustrates the importance of such critical review. both throat pain and acute tonsillitis had more noise than signal."}
