{"summary": "the aim of this study was to determine the role of HRV as a cause of acute wheezing in young children. the presence of human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus and human coronavirus-NL63 was assessed in all samples. several respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus and human bocavirus have been associated with wheezy illness. a recent population-based study showed that HRV was detected in 26% of children under 5 years of age hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or fever [10] the importance of HRV as a cause of acute wheezing illness in infants and young children has not been studied in african children. the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HRV in african children with acute wheezing. the purified RNA sample was converted into cDNA using random primers. samples were screened for HRV using PCR primers targeting the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) the first reaction was 10 l cDNA was added to a 50 l PCR mix. the expected sizes of the outer and inner HRV PCR products were 390 bp and 300 bp respectively. all work was performed in an ISO-15189 accredited molecular laboratory. all work was performed in an ISO-15189 accredited molecular laboratory. a prospective study of children aged 2 months to 5 years presenting with acute wheezing was undertaken. RCCH is a public paediatric tertiary hospital in Cape Town, south africa. the study was approved by the human research ethics committee. sample was converted into cDNA using random primers (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) samples were screened for HRV using PCR primers targeting the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) cDNA was added to a 50 l PCR mix containing 2 IU Supertherm polymerase (JMR Holdings, Kent, UK) the expected sizes of the outer and inner HRV PCR products were 390 bp and 300 bp respectively. all work was performed in an ISO-15189 accredited molecular laboratory. a general shell vial culture using a pool of monoclonal antibodies detecting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses. a p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. more than half, 114 (51.8%), were under 12 months. most HRV-positive children were under 24 months of age. 68 (53) 43 (47) 0.77(0.45-1.32) 0.35 Rhinorrhea 86 (67) 59 (64) 0.87(0.50-1.53) 0.64 Night waking 75 (59) 52 (57) 0.92(0.53-1.58) 0.76 Fever >37.5C 43 (34) 46 (50) 1.98(1.14-3.42) 0.02 Diarrhoea 17 (13) 10 (11) 0.80(0.35-1.83) 0.60 Vomiting 51 ( n = 149 (67.7%) Clinical symptoms n (%) Cough 60(85) 137(91) 2.09(0.87-5-01) 0.10 Wheeze 66(93) 121(81) 0.33(0.12-0.89) 0.03 Breathing difficulty 35(49) 76(51) 1.07(0.61-1.88) 1.07 Rhinorrhea 43(61) 102(69) 1.41(0.78-2.54) 0.25 Night waking 38( of the 92 HRV-negative samples 5 (5.4%) were hMPV positive, 10 (10.9%) HBoV positive and 3 (3.3%) HCoV positive. of the 58 samples screened for the common respiratory viruses by general shell vial culture 14 (24.1%) were positive; 4 (6.9%) HRV-positive and 10 (17.2%) HRV-negative. the median (IQR) duration of hospitalisation was 1 (1-4) days. there were no difference in the duration of hospitalisation between HRV-infected and uninfected children. HRV has previously been reported in older children with wheezing or asthma exacerbations. HRV was identified throughout the year with peaks of activity in the spring of 2004 and 2005 and autumn of 2005. this pattern was more prominent with HRV-A than HRV-C and HRV-B which were detected throughout the year or sporadically. this pattern was more prominent with HRV-A than HRV-C and HRV-B which were detected throughout the year or sporadically. all HRV-Ca sequences from this study grouped phylogenetically with GenBank-derived HRV isolates that have been confirmed to be true HRV-C types based on the classification proposed by Simmonds et al. previous studies have reported that HRV is more frequently found in sick children than in asymptomatic children. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors conceived the study, obtained funding, supervised the clinical study and participated in manuscript preparation."}
