{"summary": "SCI triggers a series of interconnected mechanisms that can be divided into the primary and secondary injury. the direct and immediate physical disruption of neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels makes up the primary injury. the secondary injury consists of a cascade of autodestructive cellular and molecular mechanisms. cytokines and growth factors are proteins synthesized by a wide variety of cells that stimulate cellular survival, chemotaxis, proliferation, and differentiation. the aim of this review is to expose the role of cytokines and growth factors within the pathogenesis of SCI. the importance of the BSCB is evidenced by the positive correlation between increased barrier disruption and improved motor locomotion 14 days after SCI. there is an upregulation of the transport system of TNF after SCI that remains saturable despite BSCB disruption. oligodendrocyte apoptosis after SCI with LIF administration resulted in a substantial decrease in demyelination shown by the preservation of lamellated myelin surrounding viable axons. the results suggest that LIF signals survival in oligodendrocytes after SCI, prevents the secondary wave of demyelination, and thereby reduces inhibitory myelin deposits. edema that occurs after contusive SCI is directly related to trauma and motor dysfunction experienced by the affected individual. it is important to note that the edema that occurs after contusive SCI is directly related to the initial trauma and motor dysfunction experienced by the affected individual. NMDA receptors play a role in activation of SK channels in dendrites. SK channels regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and membranous deposition of protein aggregates impair Ca2+ pumps and cell membrane channels. adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is depleted by the excessive energy demands of demyelination. this normal Ca2+ buffering fails and the level of intracellular Ca2+ rises until it becomes toxic. the result is the chaotic activation of processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene transcription in cells. glutamate excitotoxicity induced by extracellular glutamate concentration is enhanced by the activity of glutamate transporters such as glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), which are expressed by astrocytes. excitotoxicity induced by extracellular glutamate concentration is enhanced by the activity of glutamate transporters such as glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and glutamate aspartate oligodendrocytes and microglia release TNF, IL-1, and ROS. cytokines inhibit glutamate transporters in astrocytes and expose oligodendrocytes to an excessive glutamate concentration. antagonists of AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors blocked IL-1 toxicity towards oligodendrocytes. approximately 30% of neurofilament constitutive proteins are degraded in 1 h. 70% of neurofilament constitutive proteins are lost within 4 h after injury. cathepsin B, Y, and S, members of the cysteine lysosomal proteases and papain superfamily, have been linked to neurofilament destruction. a change in lipid metabolism and the homeostasis of lipid mediators is an alternate route by which genes are thought to modulate the susceptibility of nervous tissue to trauma. altered protein cleavage, one of the main driving forces of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders, can be further enhanced by trauma occurring in the presence of specific lipid-binding proteins. many of these molecules are reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as delta and sigma oxygen (O2), superoxide anion (O2 ), hydroxyl anion (OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or reactive nitrogen species [(RNS) NO\u2022]. the mechanical reduction of the superoxide anion causes the anion to react with NO and form a neurotoxic compound known as peroxynitrite (O2 + NO\u2022 = ONOO) the CNS is particularly sensitive to LP because of its high content of peroxidation-susceptible lipids (arachidonic, linoleic, and docosahexaenoic acid) and the primarily radical-mediated oxidative protein damage. the oxidative damage to DNA and lipids, in addition to protein nitration, is observed within the first week after injury. cellular immunity consists of specialized cells that can recognize, endocyte, and eliminate different types of microorganisms or noxious substances. the humoral response is composed by soluble macromolecules that circulate in the blood and extracellular liquid that acts upon the pathogen. this inflammatory response tends to go out of control when it exacerbates autoreactive mechanisms that cause neural destruction. the released cytokines include IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, GM-CSF, and LIF. the neurons of human patients expressed these molecules 30 min after SCI, and microglia, 5 h after the lesion. however, the expression decreased by the 2nd day. a significant increase in the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) can be identified, which favors the infiltration of neutrophils from the first 3 to 12 h after the injury. the second wave of infiltration is characterized by the presence of monocytes and macrophages, which can be observed around 3-4 days after SCI [106] the survival factor tox3 (TOX High Mobility Group Box Family Member 3) in oligodendrocytes is associated with the production of cytokines and protein kinases that are involved in the repair of the site of lesion. the recruitment of leukocytes to the injured spinal cord is a physiological response that is associated with the production of cytokines and protein kinases that are involved in the repair of the site. Activated microglia migrate to the site of injury, proliferate, and transform from the resting phenotype (ramified cells) to amoeboid phagocytic cells. activated microglia can release a series of cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes proportional to the activating stimulus. the reactive phenotype is characterized by the excessive release of NO\u2022, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, which leads to toxicity. astrocytes and postsynaptic neurons show signs of damage, evidenced by the expression of ROS, which can induce apoptosis. however, activated microglia remove the cellular debris after the lesion and are capable of promoting revascularization. the presence of T lymphocytes with a Th2 phenotype in the lesion site favors functional recovery. the presence of T lymphocytes with a Th2 phenotype in the lesion site favors functional recovery. cytokine expression was analyzed in comparison to sham animals. dominant phenotype was found to be Th1 and Th17 predominantly according to expectations. this is due to its important role in the generation of free radicals. these events can become chronic if the proinflammatory environment is not regulated. the response would involve the participation of other immune cells, other signaling pathways, and other patterns of gene expression. the persistent influx of immune cells from the systemic circulation as neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils is correlated. the second mechanism is explained by the presence of the receptor to a specific cytokine on most cells (e.g., activation of NF by IL-1, or TNF induction of COX-2). the third mechanism encompasses the ability of cytokines to induce or function as coactivators (e.g., IL-18 induces IFN when IL-12 is present, but when it is not, IL-18 induces Fas ligand) specific inflammatory cytokines are synthetized by various cells in the CNS. inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 are known as mediators of the peripheral immune response. a direct injection of IL-1 into the spinal cord leads to enhanced vascular permeability and lymphocyte recruitment. the continuous inhibition of IL-6 is detrimental to functional recovery because it also participates in axonal regeneration and gliosis. it is important to take into account that the mediation of the early inflammatory tissue damage may actually worsen the functional outcome. early production at 15 min AI (ii) Upregulated 1\u20133 h AI with PL at 1\u20133 days AI (ii) Principal promoter of wallerian degeneration (ii) Promotes immediate neutrophil recruitment to lesion site by the induction of adhesion molecules and IL-8 release (iii) iNOS induction in microglia, astrocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes [118, 136, 137, 148, 182\u2013184 proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6, are beneficial at low concentrations due to their induction of neurotrophin expression. proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6, are beneficial at low concentrations due to their induction of neurotrophin expression and the mediation of leukocyte activation/recruitment to the injury site. inflammatory cytokines activate transcription factors such as NF, AP1, and ATF. mRNAs of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-1, and IL-6 could be detected 15 min after injury. western blot studies found that the mature form of IL-1 is expressed by the 2 h. cytokines such as IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, and their receptors were upregulated. the downregulation of the signaling of IL-1 and TNF reduces the induction of IL-1 mRNA. this suggests that the activity of these cytokines contributes to their own mRNA regulation. the expression of both receptor subtypes is increased within 15 min after traumatic SCI in adult rats. it is important to note that these receptors are initially found on the epicenter of the lesion site. a peak took place from day 1 to day 3. IFN is the most potent inductor of MHCI, and it is upregulated in the CNS after injury. in low concentrations, IFN may participate in the homeostasis of the synaptic circuitry. TGF- and interleukin-21 (IL-21) are also capable of stimulating IL-17 production. interleukin-23 (IL-23) is also able to promote IL-17 production. a closed circuit is formed in which IL-17, the STAT3 signaling pathway, and IL-17 related cytokines promote neuroinflammation as they costimulate one another. Chemokines of the Inflammatory Response Chemokines are functionally related cytokines that induce specific actions in the immune system. they are released in response to an infection, inflammation, or trauma. the family includes gamma-interferon inducible protein (IP-10/CXCL10) and platelet factor 4, IL-1. MCP-1 mRNA was present in the normal spinal cord, was increased 1 h after SCI, peaked at 24 h, and returned to a low level by day 14. chemokines remain present 24 d after injury, in contrast with the rest of the cytokines. activated macrophages and microglia after CNS injury produce various neurotrophic factors and molecules that enhance regeneration. this response highly depends on the temporal sequence that proceeds the injury. this indicates that there is a proper and timely regulation of inflammatory reactions that can take place. IL-10 and TGF have been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect against microglia-mediated neuronal toxicity by the regulation of FR formation. this evidence makes IL-4 injections a possible therapeutic application. a potential treatment for certain aspects of the secondary injury is the administration of IL-10. antagonist for the production of proinflammatory cytokines plays a role in the secondary degeneration. astrocytes and neurons release fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) after mechanical trauma, astrocytes and neurons release fibroblast growth factor (fgf) it is thought to counteract excitotoxic or ischemic damage by the activation of antiapoptotic signals in stressed neurons. aFGF Detected 1 h AI, PL 5\u20137 days, remains elevated up to 14\u201321 days AI. aFGF promotes Th2 cytokine production, M2 response, and neurotrophic factor production. this strategy induced higher IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in rat spinal cords. bFGF mRNA was not detected in the uninjured spinal cord. it was only detected 1 h after SCI, at its peak 3 days after SCI. growth factors such as TGF- may act as immunosuppressants. neurotrophins emit signals when they bind to low and high affinity receptors in the membrane of their target cells. the low affinity p75 receptor binds all neurotrophins [208] adherence junction proteins and tight junctions, astrocyte endfeet, perivascular microglia, pericytes, and continuous capillary endothelial cells embedded in the basement membrane. this infrastructure allows the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) to regulate the transport of molecules, the interaction between the CNS and the immune system, and helps maintain homeostasis in the brain and spinal cord. TNF has a role in inflammation, myelin destruction, apoptotic neuronal cell death, and astrocyte toxicity. it has been suggested that TNF has a dual role: deleterious in the acute phase, but beneficial in the chronic phase after SCI [22] the subsequent increment in vascular permeability and the formation of edema could also be in part mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (c-Src/c-Src) which exists downstream of VEGF. edema that occurs after contusive SCI is directly related to initial trauma and motor dysfunction experienced by the affected individual. ependymal cells are Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), the predominant water channel in the CNS. AQP4 has been shown to regulate the before-mentioned astrocytic functions. it is important to mention that the role of AQP4 in the resolution of edema is still under debate. synaptic transmission involves Ca2+ and employs calmodulin (CaMKIIV) dependent kinases (CaMKIIV), protein kinase C, protein kinase A, IP3 kinase, Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin B, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase, lCa2+-dependent neuronal nitric an excess concentration of intracellular Na+ can come at a steep metabolic expense. there is a concomitant increase in the intra-axonal concentration of Na+ and Ca2+. it is also important to mention that the subsequent release of ATP after the lesion increases in peritraumatic areas for 6 or more hours. glutamate levels at the epicenter and surrounding regions become six times higher than physiological levels due to overstimulation of ionotropic receptors. this influx provokes overexcitation and endotoxicity by the secondary increase of intracellular Ca2+ and the activation Ca2+ dependent signaling pathways. an important mechanism for the reduction of excessive extracellular glutamate is the activity of glutamate transporters. ione blocked IL-1 toxicity towards oligodendrocytes [61]. a series of interconnected, deleterious mechanisms cause excitotoxicity. first, microglia release this cytokine in the inflammatory response, which induces additional release of TNF. in turn, it causes the release of glutamate that acts on metabotropic receptors of microglia. psin S degrades laminin, fibronectin, collagens, and elastin at acidic or neutral pH. it is known that a change in lipid metabolism and the homeostasis of lipid mediators is an alternate route by which genes are thought to modulate the susceptibility of nervous tissue to trauma. ApoE4 increases the inflammatory effect of neurotrauma by a significant increase of IL-6, TNF, and NO\u2022 in the injured tissue. FR are reactive molecules produced by the metabolism of the cell that possess an unpaired electron. these elements associate with oxygen and form other FR such as NO\u2022. LP is a mechanism that disrupts the normal structure and function of the lipid bilayers that surround the cell and membrane-bound organelles. when peroxynitrite or other FR takes an electron off a polyunsaturated lipid, it generates a lipid radical (L\u2022) that can further interact with molecular oxygen and yield a lipid peroxyl radical (LOO\u2022) if the resulting lipid peroxyl radical LOO\u2022 is not reduced by antioxidants the resulting elevated NO\u2022 concentration induces cell damage and lipid peroxidation, increases vascular permeability, and causes edema [84]. it is known that NO\u2022 is produced by different synthases. but only iNOS is capable of producing a high concentration of NO\u2022 for a prolonged period of time. Traumatic SCI triggers inflammatory reactions in which various types of cells, cytokines, and neuroprotective/neuroregenerative molecules are involved. the inflammatory response involves the participation of chemical mediators, and resident (astrocytes and microglia) and peripheral (macrophages, lymphocytes) immune cells participate in the cellular response after SCI [98], in which microglia and endothelial cells function as antigen-presenting cells. NF and IL-1 by microglia and astrocytes was identified 5\u201315 min after the lesion. the peak expression was at 1 h for TNF and 12 h for IL-1. the second wave of infiltration is characterized by the presence of monocytes and macrophages. chemokines are known to mediate macrophage infiltration such as CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL2. a peak in the proliferation and recruitment of microglia from day 3 to day 7. the overexpression of LIF has been found to cause a dramatic increase in the proliferation of macrophages. microglia are pluripotent cells capable of developing different phenotypes proportional to the severity of the lesion. microglia migrate to the site of injury, proliferate, and transform from the resting phenotype (ramified cells) to amoeboid phagocytic cells. cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes are proportional to the activating stimulus. monocyte derived microglia and macrophages may induce regeneration by the secretion of neurotrophic factors, particularly TGF-1. these cells can also be activated towards an M2 macrophage phenotype that responds to IL-4 and IL-13. the phenotype is characterized by the excessive release of NO\u2022, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. microglia and peripheral macrophages make up the majority of inflammatory cells present in the site of lesion. these cells are morphologically different and respond to different modulatory signals in an early response of the innate immunity to the lesions of the CNS. this all depends on the macrophage phenotype activated, particularly microglia. INF is known to participate in the induction of a cytolytic response by TCD8+ (CD, cluster of differentiation) since it is the principal inductor of MHCI through the phosphorylation of STAT1. chemoattractant, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 recruits CD4 Th1 cells via the CXCR3A receptor [95] autoreactivity observed after SCI is characterized by the specific immune response. lymphocytes are the only cells capable of specifically recognizing antigens. but when this mechanism is excessive, the result is an autoimmune disease. cytokines comprise a large family of small signaling proteins. they affect nearly every biological process including embryonic development, disease, nonspecific infection response, cognitive functions, aging, cellular growth, survival, and differentiation. cytokines are products of most cells while not being of a particular tissue or cell. inflammatory cytokines can be grouped into a proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory category. cytokines have homeostatic physiologic and neuromodulatory functions. they also contribute to neuronal damage and destruction when concentration exceeds a certain threshold. studies have shown that a direct injection of IL-1 into the spinal cord leads to enhanced vascular permeability and lymphocyte recruitment. IL-6 is a major player in chemokine infiltration, because it has the ability to interact with other cytokines. high concentrations activate the expression of NF, AP1, ATF, COX-2, iNOS, and proinflammatory proteases in astrocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and microglia. high concentrations activate the expression of iNOS enzyme in astrocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and microglia. detected from 1 h AI, PL at 24 h, barely detected up to 72 h AI (i) Inflammation in autoimmune diseases [201\u2013204] MIP-1/CCL4 (i) Locally produced from 30 to 60 min AI, PL 3\u20136 h, decreases by 1 day and remains barely detected up to 24 days AI. inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6, are beneficial at low concentrations due to their induction of neurotrophin expression and the mediation of leukocyte activation/recruitment to the injury site. mRNAs of cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, IL-1, and IL-6 could be detected 15 min after injury. western blot studies found that the mature form of IL-1 is expressed by the 2 h. this suggests that the inflammatory cytokine is released very quickly after tissue damage. the expression of these genes was identified 1 h after rat SCI. a wave of expression was observed for TNF and IL-1 at 14 days. the overexpression of LIF has been found to cause a dramatic increase in proliferation of microglia/macrophages. it is important to note that TNF is the principal promoter of wallerian degeneration. the expression of TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 is increased within 15 min after traumatic SCI in adult rats and reaches its peak at 4 h for TNF-R2 and 8 h for TNF-R1. the expression of both receptor subtypes then goes on to decline after day 1 and day 3, respectively. IFN is also the most potent inductor of MHCI, and it is upregulated in the CNS after injury. in low concentrations, IFN may participate in the homeostasis of the synaptic circuitry [216, 217] a closed circuit is formed in which IL-17, the STAT3 signaling pathway, and IL-17 related cytokines promote neuroinflammation as they costimulate one another. phosphorylation of STAT3 in this pathway induces a proinflammatory gene expression that correlates with IL-17 quantities in spinal cord neurons and astrocytes. chemokine CXCL10 inhibits angiogenesis, growth, and chemotaxis of endothelial cells via the CXCR3B receptor. it is detected in astrocytes and perivascular mononuclear cells in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1, MIP-2, and IP-10, remain present 24 d after injury. changes in gene expression that contribute to secondary injury are characterized by protracted neuronal loss and neurological dysfunction. this anti-inflammatory cytokine and its receptor subunit IL-4 have a role in spinal cord trauma. this is illustrated by the high level expression of IL-4 24 h after contusive SCI in rats whose elevated concentration persisted for 7 days but was decreased 3 days after SCI. this is noteworthy since this interleukin shares the same receptor with IL-4 for signal transduction. anti-inflammatory effects involve downregulation of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF, IFN, matrix metalloproteinase-9, nitric oxide synthase, myeloperoxidase, and ROS. also, proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, bax, and caspase 3 are downregulated by the effects of IL-10. aFGF mRNA has a role in the regeneration process since it contributes to angiogenesis. in the normal uninjured spinal cord, aFGF mRNA was found to be present in low levels. after SCI, the factor increased in the 1 h, stayed at that level, peaked from day 5 to day 7. many therapeutic strategies seek to induce higher expression of neurotrophic factors. this strategy induced higher IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the graft areas of rat spinal cords. this strategy has been shown to regulate Th2 cytokine production, M2 response, and neurotrophic factor production. increased PDGF and VGF levels after SCI may prevent the death of axotomized neurons. increased PDGF and VGF levels after SCI may prevent the death of axotomized neurons and a decrease in their energy metabolism. s. TrkA is the particular receptor for NGF, while TrkB serves as a receptor for both BDNF and NT-4. however, this particular neurotrophin can activate TrkA and TrkB receptors when present in high concentrations. p75NTR showed a significant upregulation after contusive SCI. cytokines include IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, GM-CSF, and LIF [60] similar results were obtained in mice and rats since expression by local neurons was found at 1 h. peak expression was at 1 h for TNF and 12 h for IL-1. a significant increase in the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) can be identified, which favors the infiltration of neutrophils from the first 3 to 12 h after the lesion [108]. the second wave of infiltration is characterized by the presence of monocytes and macrophages, which can be observed around 3-4 days after SCI [106] diversse studies have reported that the recruitment of leukocytes to the injured spinal cord is a physiological response that is associated with the production of cytokines and protein kinases that are involved in the repair of the site of lesion. the recruitment of leukocytes to the injured spinal cord is associated with the production of cytokines and protein kinases that are involved in the repair of the site of lesion. activated microglia can release cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes. the series includes IL-1, IL-6, TNF, TGF-1 (transformation growth factor-1), M-CSF [121], iNOS, NGF (neural growth factor), NT-3 (neurotrophin-3), and BNDF (brain neuronal derived factor) astrocytes and postsynaptic neurons show signs of damage, evidenced by the expression of ROS. activated microglia remove the cellular debris after the lesion and are capable of promoting revascularization in the site of injury. microglia are capable of expressing glutamate transporters, which apparently help buffer the excessive concentrations of glutamate. chemoattractant, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 recruits CD4 Th1 cells via the CXCR3A receptor. inflammatory response after SCI can be responsible for necrosis of the lesion site and the surrounding area. the dominant phenotype was found to be Th1 and Th17 predominantly according to expectations [147, 148] this is due to its important role in the generation of free radicals, cytokines, and chemokines that exacerbate the damage to the neural tissue for weeks or even months. this response can either increase the damage to the neural tissue, promote protection [150\u2013153], or even promote restoration of the injured tissue. if not regulated, the response would involve the participation of other immune cells, other signaling pathways, and other patterns of gene expression. the persistent influx of immune cells from the systemic circulation as neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils is correlated with additional elevation of proinflammatory cytokine levels. the third mechanism encompasses the ability of cytokines to induce or function as coactivators (e.g., IL-18 induces IFN when IL-12 is present, but when it is not, IL-18 induces Fas ligand) the effects of these molecules are mostly studied in the realm of inflammation, immunology, cancer, and atherosclerosis [162] specific inflammatory cytokines are synthetized by various cells in the CNS. inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 are known as mediators of the peripheral immune response. a direct injection of IL-1 into the spinal cord leads to enhanced vascular permeability and lymphocyte recruitment. IL-1 (i) early 15 min, PL at 6 h AI (ii) upregulated 1\u20133 h AI with PL at 1\u20133 days AI (ii) its production starts from 3 to 24 h, PL 12 h AI (ii) Upregulation at 14 days. iNOS induction in microglia, astrocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes promotes immediate neutrophil recruitment to lesion site by the induction of adhesion molecules. iNOS induction in microglia, astrocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6, are beneficial at low concentrations due to their induction of neurotrophin expression and the mediation of leukocyte activation/recruitment to the injury site by the induction of adhesion molecules in the cell surface. proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 and IL-6, activate transcription factors such as NF, AP1, and ATF. mRNAs of cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, IL-1, and IL-6 could be detected 15 min after injury. from these cytokines, IL-1 and IL-1 continually reached peak levels until the 6 h but were not present from the 12 to 24 h after SCI. western blot studies found that the mature form of IL-1 is expressed by the 2 h. TNF and IL-1 induce both IL-1 and TNF mRNAs. the downregulation of the signaling reduces the induction of IL-1 mRNA. this suggests that the activity of these cytokines contributes to their own mRNA regulation. the expression of TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 is increased within 15 min after traumatic SCI in adult rats and reaches its peak at 4 h for TNF-R2 and 8 h for TNF-R1. the expression of both receptor subtypes then goes on to decline after day 1 and day 3, respectively. IFN promotes macrophage signaling, production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, recruitment of macrophages to the CNS, and the activation of MHCI. in low concentrations, IFN may participate in the homeostasis of the synaptic circuitry [216, 217] interleukin-23 (IL-23) stimulates IL-17 production just as interleukin-22 (IL-22) does. a closed circuit is formed in which IL-17, the STAT3 signaling pathway, and IL-17 related cytokines promote neuroinflammation as they costimulate one another. mokines are grouped into two families: the family (CXC) and the family (C-C) the family provides the priming signal for macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. the family includes gamma-interferon inducible protein (IP-10/CXCL10), platelet factor 4, IL-1, and melanoma growth stimulatory activity. the expression of MIP-1 mRNA was observed from day 3 to day 6 following injury. it increased at 1 h after SCI, peaked at 6 h, and returned to a low level by day 14. chemokines remain present 24 d after injury. a particular cytokine involved in this beneficial aspect of the inflammatory response is IL-4. this cytokine exerts an anti-inflammatory effect after CNS damage. this cytokine exerts an anti-inflammatory effect after CNS damage. IL-10 and TGF have been reported to act as neuroprotective molecules in a manner similar to IL-4. a potential treatment for certain aspects of the secondary injury is the administration of IL-10. antiapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, bax, and caspase 3 are downregulated by the effects. fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a potent mitogenic and chemotactic agent for vascular endothelial cells, dermal fibroblasts, and epidermal keratinocytes. it is thought to counteract excitotoxic or ischemic damage by the activation of antiapoptotic signals in stressed neurons. aFGF has a role in the regeneration process since it contributes to angiogenesis. bFGF Detected 1 h AI, PL at day 3 remains elevated 5\u20137 days. it returns to low levels 14\u201321 days AI (i) Angiogenesis. aFGF induced higher IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in graft areas. growth factors such as TGF- may act as immunosuppressants. increased PDGF and VGF levels after SCI may prevent the death of axotomized neurons. increased PDGF and VGF levels after SCI may prevent a decrease in their energy metabolism. the low affinity p75 receptor binds all neurotrophins [208]. the trk family of tyrosine-protein kinases is composed of three high affinity trk receptors. these receptors mediate the biological properties of the NGF family of neurotrophins. most of these cytokines have a dual role in a range between beneficial and injurious. the excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory response after SCI enhances the damage role of these cytokines. therapies that focus on promoting the anti-inflammatory properties of cytokines and growth factors should be a priority."}
