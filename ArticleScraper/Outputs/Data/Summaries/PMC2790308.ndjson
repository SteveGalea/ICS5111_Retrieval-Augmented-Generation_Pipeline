{"summary": "the international committee on the taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) generates a master list which currently recognizes about 4379 virus species divided in nine Orders, 98 assigned Families, 26 unassigned Families, 18 assigned Sub-families, 5 unassigned genera and 57 unassigned genera. the ICTVdb uses an eight position decimal code with up to three digit schema similar to that used for enzyme classes to represent order, family, subfamily, information is linked to approximately 8000 representative sequences from the NCBI database. some databases support data curation, genome and proteome comparisons (6\u20138). some databases support data curation, genome and proteome comparisons (6\u20138). monitoring, retrieval and integration This layer of tools is managed by monitor and adapter modules. the monitor module triggers a PERL script named ICTVml_parser.pl. a script retrieves and parses new GeneBank records. genomic catalog includes virus morphology description, geographical information, clinical characteristics, isolation location and year, culture passage cycle, and controlled vocabularies. monitor module triggers a PERL script named ICTVml_parser.pl which uploads new taxonomical classification and species naming from the ICTV. ORION-VIRCAT genomic catalog reuses the attributes from BioSQL seqfeatures, annotation, taxon and ontology tables and it is implemented in postgreSQL. to avoid specific vendor operations we have extended the database schema of BioSQL to ORACLE, mySQL and DB2 and data formats. ancy included species listed only in the ICTV master list and classified within a particular taxonomy according to morphological observations but without sequence entries available in the NCBI-VGR. but for the most part, these implementations remain isolated sources of information and lack interoperability and scalability. ORION-VIRCAT empowers researchers interested in a particular viral taxonomy to download specific sets of information and implement their own databases. the ICTV master list generates new names for species, they are added to the table and this way we ensure that every group has the most updated naming convention. ICTV is now developing an annotation tool for data clarification to generate reports to be considered by the ICTV. classified Globuloviridae Globulovirus PMID: 16682063 Sulfolobus Guttavirus PMID: 10873785 Unclassified Drosophila LRT Hemivirus PMID: 2410772 Rhadinovirus Macavirus PMC: 187546 Unclassified Saccharomyces retrotransposon Metavirus PMID: 2159534 Unclassified Reoviridae Mimoreovirus PMID: 16603541 Varicellovirus Per the viral ontology should be divided into four parts within two core layers. the first core layer should be a static ontology describing only essential and passive concepts about viruses. the extended layer should include as a rule, a minimum set of description categories in order to define a species. the viral ontology should be divided into four parts within two core layers. the first core layer should be a static ontology describing only essential and passive concepts about viruses. the extended layer should include as a rule, a minimum set of description categories to define a species. conflict of interest statement.
