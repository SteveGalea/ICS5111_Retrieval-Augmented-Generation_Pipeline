{"summary": "haemophilus parasuis (HPS) is an important swine pathogen that causes Gl\u00e4sser's disease, which is characterized by fibrinous polyserositis, meningitis and arthritis. the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis remain poorly understood, particularly the resistance of porcine immune system to HPS invasion. the infection caused by haemophilus parasuis has become an increasing threat in early-weaned pigs and in pig herds of high health status. other clinical manifestations, such as acute pneumonia, acute fasciitis and myositis, acute septicemia and the formation of microthrombi, have also been reported. a recent paper on the pathogenesis of meningitis induced by HPS has been published during the preparation of our manuscript [11]. this work demonstrated that HPS lipooligosaccharide plays a contributory role in the adhesion of HPS to porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC) the authors also found that the permeability of the blood-brain barrier may have been increased as a result of the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 in expression was detected for 13,833 transcripts (58% of all probesets) in the spleen during infection. a total of 14,729 transcripts were expressed in infected and non-infected porcine spleens. expression of five marker genes was evaluated by QPCR analyses. the annealing temperature represents the optimal temperature during quantitative PCR. the same letter \"a\" above the bars suggested a no significant fold change between the controls and the infected spleens. up-/down-regulated response transcripts are highlighted on the right with the No. in each cluster in parentheses. fold change is calculated based on the mean intensity value from 3 donors within each group. of the 258 DE transcripts, putative identities could be determined based on BLASTX searches. 158 unique genes had significant similarities based on BLASTX searches. 92 (70+22) unique genes had been annotated by Biology Process (BP) classification. many categories shared the same transcripts. amyloid A1 NM_000331 23.9 1.35E-02 Lactotransferrin NM_002343 13.0 2.26E-02 Angiotensinogen NM_000029 10.2 6.50E-03 Haptoglobin NM_005143 10.0 1.36E-02 Ceruloplasmin/ferroxidase NM_000096 4.9 4.09E-05 Humoral immune response CD163 antigen NM_203416 proteoglycan NM_004385 9.3 7.50E-03 Lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 8 NM_006499 2.8 7.10E-03 CD44 antigen NM_001001392 2.5 5.50E-03 Immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat NM_201526 2.3 3.44E-02 Discs; large homolog 5 NM_004747 2.2 2.05E-02 NM_015359 4.5 3.66E-02 CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), beta NM_005194 3.1 3.00E-02 Nuclear factor; interleukin 3 regulated NM_005384 2.3 4.70E-03 Response to wounding Macrophage stimulating 1 NM_020998 2.9 3.31E-02 Coagulation factor III NM_001993 2.8 1.74E-02 Annexin A8 non-receptor type 1 NM_002827 2.3 4.58E-02 Putative insulin-like growth factor II associated prote NM_001007139 2.2 2.60E-03 FYVE; RhoGEF and PH domain containing 4 NM_139241 2.2 4.74E-02 Slingshot homolog 2 NM_033389 2.2 3.00E-04 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulfate synthase 2 NM_0010158 many genes could be classified into multiple categories. manual annotations were listed in italics. cFold change, gene expression level following infection compared to control. receptor beta, known to be involved in binding IL-10, showed higher expression levels in the HPS-infected spleens (2.8-fold) in contrast, HDAC9 (histone deacetylase 9) and CCL5 (chemokine ligand 5) were down-regulated, at 2-fold and 2.5-fold respectively, following HPS infection. expression of genes known to participate in the acute-phase response and the humoral immune response included the most highly up-regulated gene, SAA the new MS4A family member, MS4A8B (membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A member 8B), was found at levels 20.5-fold higher than in normal controls. another gene that was annotated manually, CSTA (cystatin A), has recently been demonstrated to play an important role in cells of the immune system. beta, 3.1-fold, are crucial in regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. zinc finger transcription factors may play an important role during pathogenesis of HPS infection. many genes related to oxidative stress, homeostasis, and wounding are up-regulated. 21 genes that were classified into the subset related to \"development\" were induced after infection. most highly induced genes included the actin-binding phosphoprotein CLF1 (cofilin 1),P8 (p8 protein), and NAV1 (neuron navigator 1). thy-1 cell surface antigen and CFP (complement factor properdin) were also selected for QPCR confirmation. HIRF (HPS infection related factor) were not annotated in the analysis of GO. cRNA levels of RPL32 were assayed for normalization during quantitative PCR. RETN, S100A12, S100A9, HIRF, CFP, HP, S100A8, and THY (A) were up regulated in HPS infected piglets compared with normal controls. expression analyses of S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and HP in PK-15 cells stimulated with LPS and Poly(I:C) HP is a plasma a2-glycoprotein that can bind free hemoglobin and prevent oxidative damage. these three EF-hand homolog S100 proteins play a pivotal role in the innate immune system. polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) was up-regulated at an earlier time following LPS challenge. however, it was up-regulated at a later time in PK-15 cells stimulated by Poly(I:C) the expression pattern of S100A12 was reversed in comparison with that of S100A8. PCR was performed using primers described in Table 3. significance of differences for the expression compared to the untreated control was calculated using two-directional paired Student's T-test. these seven QTLs belong to two big categories of the health traits. WBC, SPONT, IMMa, PWM, IMMb are grouped into the category of \"Pathogen Immune Capacity\" bRNA levels of RPL32 were assayed for normalization during quantitative PCR. bRNA levels of RPL32 were assayed for normalization during quantitative PCR. a total of 258 transcripts showed differential expression. a set of 169 transcripts with similar responses to HPS infection belonged to the up-regulated group. another set of 89 transcripts belonged to the down-regulated group. the majority of the genes related to the immune response could be assigned into numerous subcategories related to the inflammatory response, the acute-phase response, the humoral immune response, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, oxidative stress, homeostasis, transcription factors. another important set of genes that are related to development was also identified (Table 2).

CHI3L1 (chitinase 3-like 1), CAPNS1 (calpain small subunit 1), IL1RAP (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein), C3 (complement component 3), and SLC2A3 (solute carrier family 2 member 3) were also up-regulated. IL-10R (cell surface interleukin 10 receptor beta), which is known to be involved in binding IL-10, showed higher expression levels in the HPS-infected gene set related to cell differentiation included 10 DE genes. skin barrier gene TGM1 (transglutaminase 1) showed highest mRNA expression levels (22.3-fold) after infection. another gene that was annotated manually, CSTA (cystatin A), showed down-regulation. LGALS8 (lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 8) is a CAM that is related to apoptosis. it was found to be increased 2.8-fold in our assay. another important cell-surface glycoprotein CD44 (CD44 antigen) was found to be 2.5-fold increased after HPS infection. both of the MHC genes, which connect the innate immune system with the adaptive immune system, were down-regulated. the most highly induced genes included the actin-binding phosphoprotein CLF1 (cofilin 1),P8 (p8 protein), and NAV1 (neuron navigator 1). the change in expression of ERAF was confirmed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) analyses. the genes related to cell development are likely to be connected to the series of histomorphologic changes that occur during the course of disease, or to the regulation of the immune system during stress. the annealing temperature represents the optimal temperature during quantitative PCR. bHPS infection related factor; no significant similarity was found after BLASTX searches. HY (A) were up regulated in HPS infected piglets (light gray bars) compared with normal controls (black bars), CCL5 and ERAF (B) were down regulated. significant levels were analyzed by T-test. homolog S100 proteins have been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). these three MRPs can also induce transcriptional activity and viral replication of HIV-1 in infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. PK-15 cells were treated with 1 g/mL LPS and 10 g/mL Poly(I:C) respectively. results are from the calculated average SD of three different cell samples in the same treatment. the transcriptional factor CEBPD was found to be located in the QTL region of the small intestinal Escherichia coli F18 receptor. serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 2 and interleukin 10 receptor beta were found to be linked to white blood cell counts. this work may provide important clues or evidence that allow us to explain gene functions. the spleen is the largest lymphatic organ in the pig. many immune cells, including B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, etc., exist in the spleen. the spleen has the dominant role in the simultaneous dual reaction to bacterial antigens. RETN was the most highly up-regulated gene among several genes involved in the inflammatory response. it is a member of the adipokines, which have been found to be biologically active mediators present in the adipocytes of white adipose tissue. in the porcine, RETN has been cloned [33] and mapped to chromosome 2. these genes were up-regulated in porcine mesenteric lymph notes in response to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. these intracellular molecules that bind calcium are thought to become pro-inflammatory danger signals after release into the extracellular compartment. acute-phase proteins (APP) and complement constitute another notable subsystem/module used by the porcine innate immune system. these genes include SAA1, LTF, AGT,HP, CP, and C3, which were found during HPS infection at levels far exceeding those found in control individuals. this APP has been ascribed numerous immune effects that are involved in chemotactic activity and the production of cytokines. the potential S100A12-RAGE-SAA1 cascade may exist in pigs with arthritis. the innate immune system of the pig may limit the growth of HPS by using LTF and HP during HPS infection. the synergic antistaphylococcal properties of LTF and LYZ have been demonstrated. we found it difficult to explain why HP was down-regulated in PK-15 cells treated with Ploy(I:C) or is it possible that the sensitivity of PK-15 cells to many inflammatory mediators has been modified by Poly(I:C)\" it should be stressed that HP is becoming an important candidate gene in both human and porcine diseases. CSTA belongs to the cystatin family, which are natural inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins and have been proposed to induce production of TNF, IL-10, and nitric oxide [65]. CSTA plays a critical role in proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, and in regulating antigen presentation and apoptosis. ligand of CD44, LGALS8/galectin-8, was up-regulated 2.5-fold in our assay. also, data suggest that galectin-8 can modulate the function of neutrophils [74] and can induce apoptosis in the CD4high CD8high subpopulations of thymocytes [75] four genes, RETN, SAA1, SOD2 and P8, are known to be regulated by C/EBPs [37,81-83] in particular, SAA1 and P8, whose promotor regions contain the sites that bind to the transcription factor CEBPB. CEBPD may also be linked to ECF18R (see Additional file 4), a crucial protein that counteracts E. coli infection in young piglets. the down-regulation of the T-cell differentiation protein mal (MAL) and the intracellular signal transduction protein PDZ domain containing 2 (PDZD2) could be responsible for immune evasion of HPS. further studies are clearly needed in pigs to understand the role of the MHC and T cell-mediated response to HPS. 10 piglets obtained from a commercial herd free of Gl\u00e4sser's disease were weaned at 10 days. at 30 days, 5 pigs were randomly allocated to the noninfected group and 5 to the infected group. each piglet of the infected group was treated similarly with an identical volume of PBS as control. a total of 5 g RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using the one-cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and an oligo-dT primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. cRNA quality and concentration was checked by UV spectrophotometer analyses. 25-mer probes in the Affymetrix GeneChip porcine genome array for each probeset representing a gene. the signals from these probe pairs are used to determine whether a given gene is expressed and to measure the gene expression level. PK-15 cells from the same cell culture flask were grown in culture medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. spleen RNA prepared for microarray analyses and RNA from LPS and Poly(I:C) stimulated PK-15 cells were used for QPCR analyses. the correct fragment sizes were confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5%) each primer set amplified a single product as indicated by a single peak present for each gene during melting curve analyses. the relative quantitative gene expression level was evaluated using the comparative Ct method [92]. each piglet of the infected group was intratracheally challenged with HPS strain 0165 (serotype 5) at a dose of 5 108 colony-forming units (CFU) all piglets were determined to be HPS-free by serum indirect haemagglutination (IHA) test before artificial bacterial challenges. o transcription (IVT) of cRNA from cDNA was conducted using the MEGAscript\u00ae T7 Kit (Ambion, Inc.) the cDNA and cRNA were purified using the Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix) cRNA quality and concentration was checked by UV spectrophotometer analyses and 2 g cRNA was then checked by formaldehyde denaturing gel electrophoresis. DE genes were performed for hierarchical cluster (Ver.2.11) and TreeView (Ver.1.60) analyses. gene list of interest was selected by selecting GENBAMK_ACCESSION as identifier. spleen RNA prepared for microarray analyses and RNA from LPS and Poly(I:C) stimulated PK-15 cells were used for QPCR analyses. total RNA were treated with DnaseI (Tubo kit, Ambion) and reverse transcribed by the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase. p 0.05 was considered significant in all QPCR analysis. the pig Affymetrix elements corresponding to health trait QTL regions could be browsed by trait classes in Pig Quantitative Trait Loci database. a total of 13,833 and 13,857 probesets were detected expression in the infection group and the control group respectively. \"2\" represents up regulation, \"1\" represents down regulation. \"gene description\", top informative BLASTX hit. the genes listed here are from 931 transcripts that are significantly up/down-regulated following Haemophilus Parasuis infection.
