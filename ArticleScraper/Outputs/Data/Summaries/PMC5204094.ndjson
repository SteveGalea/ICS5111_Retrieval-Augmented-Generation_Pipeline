{"summary": "regulation of protein translation is a critical step of the gene expression process. it allows cellular adaptation during stress conditions by rapidly reprograming the proteome output without the requirement for changes in RNA synthesis. translation control is considered to play a central role in eukaryotic gene expression. eukaryotic translation initiation includes the recognition and recruitment of mRNA onto the small ribosomal (40S) subunit, followed by ribosomal scanning in a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction. at this stage, an initiator methionyl-tRNA (met-tRNAi) is in the ribosomal peptidyl (P) site at the mRNA start codon. eIF4E binds to the m7G cap, which then interacts with the multidomain scaffold protein eIF4G and the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A. the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-met-tRNAi) associated with a 40S ribosomal subunit is then recruited to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA via a critical link to eIF4G mediated by eIF3. most eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 5\u2032m7G cap which is bound by eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A) the 43S preinitiation ribosome complex is recruited to the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs via eIF3-eIF4G interaction. eIF5 binds to the 48S initiation complex and induces GTPase activity of uORFs can exist in an out-of-frame relative to the main coding sequence. an overlap can also occur between uORFs and the coding sequence. alternative translation of an upstream in-frame start codon of a gene can produce an extended protein product. translation of -site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is regulated through uORFs. high GC content and complexity of the RNA secondary structure are also crucial factors for uORF-mediated translation of BACE1 [27] HCV IRES interacts with eIF3 for recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit in close proximity to the start codon. many cellular mRNAs are known to comprise IRES elements, but they do not share structural or sequence similarities. cellular IRESes participate in multiple interactions with the canonical initiation factors and ITAFs to recruit the ribosome. the cellular IRES elements are activated under stress conditions. the eIF4F complex requires the eIF4F complex and interaction of both poly(A) tail binding protein (PABP) and eIF3 with eIF4G for translation. this IRES does not require full-length eIF4GI or eIF4G. several viral and cellular mRNAs are insensitive to this mode of translation inhibition. eIF2 phosphorylation decreases eIF2-GTP-tRNAi ternary complex activity. some viral IRESes bypass translation inhibition exerted by eIF2 phosphorylation. eIF5B-dependent activation of IRES-mediated XIAP mRNA translation would act as a critical prosurvival switch in cells under stress. inhibition of eIF4A activity by hippuristanol or pateamine A treatment did not affect the ability of XIAP IRES to form initiation complexes. a subset of mRNAs harboring cis-elements are preferentially translated during eIF2 phosphorylation conditions. these mechanisms allow production of stress-related proteins. eIF3 subunit d plays a key role in alternative mechanisms of translation initiation by a noncanonical mechanism of cap recognition. the eIF3d subunit alone provided RNase protection to the mRNA of the early response transcription factor c-Jun by directly interacting with a mature, methylated 5\u2032 cap structure. the specificity of eIF3d binding to only a subset of capped mRNAs is suggested to occur through an \u201cRNA gate\u201d domain that regulates this novel cap-binding function of eIF3d. interaction of DAP5 with eIF4A, eIF3, Mnk1, and eIF4AI facilitates the IRES-mediated translation of various cellular mRNAs. cleavage of eIF4GI during apoptosis yields three major cleavage products. eIF4G M-FAG alone supports the IRES-mediated translation of mRNAs. the depletion of eIF4GI attenuated global mRNA translation rates. under hypoxic conditions, VEGF, FGF-2, Bcl-2, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 are all overexpressed due to upregulation of IRES-mediated translation. heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), hnRNAC1/C2 upstream of NRAS (UnR), nuclear factor 45 (NF45), insulin-like growth factor 2-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), Y-box protein 1 (YB1), and poly(C) binding protein (PCBP) are involved in tumor cell survival and cancer progression. the activation of S6K2 by the fibroblast growth factor 2 results in phosphorylation of PDCD4 and subsequent removal by the proteasomal pathway. PTB protein forms complexes with PSF, hnRNPL, and other proteins to regulate the gene expression, stability, and localization of mRNA during apoptosis. hnRNPC1/C2 interaction with p53 IRES is critical for mRNA expression. hnRNPA1, which is part of hnRNP family of proteins, regulates expression of Bcl-xL and XIAP mRNA. hnRNPA1 interaction with mRNA suppresses its activity. eIF2 eIF2 is a required element of the ternary complex that delivers met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosomal P-site in translation initiation [71]. eIF2 is a required element of the ternary complex that delivers met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosomal P-site in translation initiation [71]. transformation mechanism inhibits eIF2 phosphorylation by decreasing the activity of upstream target PKR. increased PKR levels and associated phosphorylated eIF2 levels were found in osteosarcoma tumors. ER stress is closely associated with solid tumor progression. inducible protein 34 (GADD34) is required to recommence protein synthesis after periods of global translation inhibition. but translation of uORF-containing, prooncogenic protein ATF4 is upregulated by eIF2 phosphorylation. in ovarian cancer cells, autophagy and activation of the PERK/eIF2 pathway attenuate and protect cancer cells from metformin-induced apoptosis. eIF2 levels were highly expressed, along with eIF4E in the germinal centers of reactive follicles. eIF2 and eIF4E were present in the nuclei and cytoplasm of brain tumor cells. eIF3 is a 13-subunit complex of 800 kilodaltons. dysregulation of eIF3 subunits is a result of upstream signaling molecules such as protein kinases. the eIF3g subunit directly interacts with PAIP1 in an RNA-independent manner. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin and PP242 significantly decreased S6K1 phosphorylation. eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3e, eIF3f, eIF3f and mTOR coimmunoprecipitate with eIF3c. mTOR-eIF3-PIC association is associated with this complex. eIF3 subunits have been shown to be involved in a diverse set of cellular processes. eIF3a upregulates translational expression of ribonucleotide reductase M2. ribonucleotide reductase M2 levels are significantly reduced. eIF3a is also known to enhance phagocytosis during apoptosis. increased eIF3c transcript levels have been found in human testicular seminomas [100] as well as increased eIF3c gene expression in colon cancer cells. eIF3c directly binds to the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein, schwannomin, in STS26T schwannoma cells. overexpression of eIF3c or eIF3h resulted in enhanced translation of cell proliferation mRNAs encoding growth-regulating cyclin D1, c-Myc, fibroblast growth factor 2 and ornithine decarboxylase. eIF3d is also involved in protein synthesis and has been shown to be upregulated in gastric cancer and mesothelioma [70, 104]. ylation of Bad induces apoptosis while phosphorylation of GSK3 promotes reovirus-induced apoptosis. eIF3d knockdown in NSCLC cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation and thus inhibition of AKT, HSP27, and SAPK/JNK. this data supports the crucial role of eIF3d in cell proliferation and cancer growth. eIF3e gene silencing using siRNA in glioblastoma results in cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase, decreases cell proliferation, and induces both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis. a recent study suggests the role of eIF3d-eIF3e module within the eIF3 complex that regulates the translation of specific mRNAs involved in maintaining metabolic pathways that are likely disrupted in cancer cells eIF3f knockdown in normal human pancreatic epithelial cells has shown reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. eIF3f knockdown in normal human pancreatic epithelial cells has shown an increase in cell proliferation and increased resistance to apoptosis. studies depicting eIF3 as both an activator (for the protooncogene c-Jun) and repressor (for the negative regulator of cell proliferation BTG1) of cap-dependent translation illustrate the diversity of functions carried out by the eIF3 complex through interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. future studies will need to focus on determining the signaling pathways involved in regulation of eIF3 and the consequences of eIF3-directed therapeutics for human cancers. eIF4E is phosphorylated at Ser209 by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 MAPK phosphorylates Mnk, a serine/threonine kinase, and phosphorylates eIF4E. p27 is a cell-cycle regulatory protein that promotes cell-cycle arrest in breast cancer cell lines. eIF4E promoter activity is enhanced by c-Myc and eIF4E. eIF4E promoter activity is enhanced by c-Myc. eIF4E promoter activity is enhanced by c-Myc. mRNAs are sensitive to silvestrol, a drug that inhibits the helicase activity of eIF4A. eIF4A also interacts with the PAIP1 domain, containing sequence similarity to eIF4G, and promotes circularization of the mRNA, affecting protein expression involved in apoptosis. eIF4G consists of two binding sites for eIF4A and a single binding site for eIF4E, eIF3, PABP, Mnk1, and RNA, which interact independently of each other. eIF4G interacts with PABP for effective circularization of the mRNA. eIF4E is associated with positive regulator HOXA9 in the nucleus. this promotes eIF4E-mediated transport of mRNAs from eIF5 interacts with the 40S initiation complex to mediate hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP [159] in higher eukaryotes including humans, eIF5 has a 9-residue C-terminal tail that can bind to the eIF5B-CTD subdomain. in humans, eIF1A/eIF5B interaction facilitates subunit joining, and recruitment is coordinated separately through eIF5/eIF5B eIF5 mimics the effect of eIF2 phosphorylation, acting as a translational inhibitor and promoting translation of prooncogenic protein GCN4 [166, 167]. eIF5-mimic protein (5MP) is a partial mimic and competition of eIF5 function. 5MP binds eIF2 to inhibit general translation. eIF5 demonstrates critical roles in cell-cycle regulation and cell proliferation. eIF5A is a 17 kDa protein that is activated by posttranslational hypusination. eIF5A's isoform eIF5A2 is upregulated in various cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. eIF5A2 overexpression in cancer cells is correlated to prognosis factors of tumor metastasis and venous infiltration [176, 177]. eIF5A2 upregulates metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) by increasing the enrichment of regulator gene c-myc on MTA1s promoter. this increases cell motility and invasion in vitro and results in tumor metastasis. eIF5A2 suppression creates a desirable mechanism of regulation and knockdown within various cancer lines. eIF5B, eIF5, and eIF5A all contain links into hallmark stages and mechanisms of cancer proliferation. eIF2 eIF2 exists in a GDP- or GTP-bound configuration, which has a critical role in translational control during stress. eIF2 sequesters eIF2B, locking eIF2 and eIF2B in an inactive complex. transformation mechanism inhibits eIF2 phosphorylation by decreasing the activity of upstream target PKR. eIF2 phosphorylation has a role in suppression of tumorigenesis. ER stress is induced in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which activates PERK and eIF2 phosphorylation. this inhibits PERK, which prevents eIF2 phosphorylation. this allows sensitization of CML cells to imatinib and decreases their proliferative abilities. eIF2 and eIF4E were present in the nuclei and cytoplasm of brain tumor cells. eIF2 and eIF4E were present in the nuclei and cytoplasm of brain tumor cells. eIF3 initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a 13-. eIF3, along with eIF1A and plausibly eIF5, associates with the ternary complex and the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex. eIF3 regulates eIF3 interaction with mRNA-binding cleft on the 40S subunit by inhibiting mRNA entry and confirming met-tRNAi is present in the P-site. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin and PP242 (inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2) significantly decreased S6K1 phosphorylation and subsequently diminished this PAIP1-eIF3 interaction. studies have shown that the eIF3 complex functions as a scaffolding structure which is associated with mTOR by mitogen/hormone stimulation. upregulation of eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3d, eIF3e, eIF3h, and eIF3i has been observed in several cancers. notably, increased levels of the largest eIF3 subunit, eIF3a, have been found in breast, cervix, esophagus, lung, and stomach cancers. eIF3 subunit expression Cancer associations Protein interactions eIF3a Breast, cervix, esophagus, lung & prostate [89, 90] ribonucleotide reductase M2 [91], RAR [92], Raf-1 [93] eIF3b Breast, bladder & prostate [90] mTOR/S6K1 [94], ICP27 [95], DDX3 [96], NREP [97] eIF3c directly binds to the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein, schwannomin, in STS26T schwannoma cells. overexpression of eIF3c or eIF3h resulted in enhanced translation of cell proliferation mRNAs encoding growth-regulating cyclin D1, c-Myc, fibroblast growth factor 2 and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) [100] studies using lentivirus-mediated RNA interference to knockdown eIF3d in the colon (HCT116) showed significantly reduced cell proliferation (induced apoptosis) and inhibited colony formation due to induced cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phases. eIF3d knockdown resulted in phosphorylation of AMPK, Bad, PRAS40, SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase)/JNK, GSK3 and the knockdown of eIF3e using RNAi in U2OS and MDA-MB-231 resulted in a reduction in protein levels of Bcl-xL (antiapoptotic protein) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) but an increase in MAD2L1 (mitotic checkpoint component) a recent study suggests the role of eIF3d-eIF3e module within the eIF3 complex that regulate depleted eIF3e triggers metabolic switch that increases dependence on glycolysis. respiratory deficiencies and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress also observed when eIF3d is depleted. eIF3f is consistently shown to function as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. eIF3f functions as a negative regulator of cell growth due to reduced levels of eIF3f contributing to cancer development and overexpression resulting in apoptosis. studies depicting eIF3 as both an activator (for the protooncogene c-Jun) and repressor (for the negative regulator of cell proliferation BTG1) of cap-dependent translation. eIF4E and 4E-BP are known to compete for a common binding site on eIF4E. eIF4E and 4E-BP are highly regulated via a phosphorylation reaction. inhibition of the mTOR pathway by amino acid starvation dephosphorylates 4E-BP. inhibition of the mTOR pathway dephosphorylates 4E-BP. p38 MAPK phosphorylates eIF4E to specifically translate mRNAs transcribed by the canonical SMAD pathway. this eventually leads to the upregulation of SNAIL and matrix metalloproteinase 3. eIF4E promoter activity is enhanced by c-Myc. eIF4E is reported to stimulate the helicase activity of eIF4A. it is also reported to aid translation of mRNAs comprising long, structured 5\u2032 UTRs. a subset of transcripts harbors a 12-nucleotide motif (CGG)4 called the G-quadruplex. eIF4G interacts with eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF3 to form preinitiation complex. interaction of eIF4G with eIF4E enhances eIF4E-mediated cap recognition. eIF4E is associated with positive regulator HOXA9 in the nucleus. eIF4G has a higher affinity towards eIF4E in comparison to HOXA9. eIF5 eIF5 is a 49 kDa protein in mammals and 46 kDa in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [158, 159]. eIF5 interacts with the 40S initiation complex to mediate hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP [159] eIF5 has a 9-residue C-terminal tail that can bind to the eIF5B-CTD subdomain. CK2 is necessary for the G1 and G2/M phase transitions in yeast. enzymatic activity also increases and phosphorylates eIF5 3 hours after serum stimulation of cell-cycle arrested (G0) human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells. eIF5 was associated with CK2 when eIF5 mutants were unable to be phosphorylated by CK2. eIF5 increases the levels of aN eIF2/eIF5 complex, which prevents eIF2B interaction. eIF5-mimic protein (5MP) is a partial mimic and competition of eIF5 function. eIF2 demonstrated mutually exclusive interactions with eIF5 and 5MP1. new treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia use hypusination inhibitors to deactivate eIF5A. eIF5A is overexpressed in murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) eIF5A's isoform eIF5A2 is upregulated in various cancer types. hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) overexpression in cancer cells is correlated to prognosis factors of tumor metastasis and venous infiltration. complexes with tRNA-Meti and increased phosphorylation of eIF2 are formed during times of attenuated global translation. eIF5B is antagonistic of G0 and G0-like states, with eIF5B overexpression promoting maturation and cell death. eIF5B depletion is associated with increased phosphor-Cdc2 which is a marker for immaturity. translation is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) the critical role of eIF2 phosphorylation has been classified in the integrated stress response, with the requirement of eIF4F complex for cap-binding and efficient translation through eIF4E and eIF4G. various eIFs and ITAFs with critical implications for cancer treatment. the mechanisms underlying both canonical and noncanonical translation are critical in treating the dysregulated gene expression in cancer. however, these studies are often limited in terms of what one can extract from them."}
