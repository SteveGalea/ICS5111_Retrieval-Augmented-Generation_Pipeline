{"summary": "the bronchial tree and parenchymal tissues of the lungs are colonized by phylogenetically-diverse microbes. the majority of the lung microbiota belongs to the normal flora that play an important role in the pulmonary epithelial integrity, colonization resistance, and homeostasis of the immune system in the respiratory tract (3). the majority of the lung microbiota belongs to the normal flora that play an important role in the COPD is a severe inflammatory lung disease characterized by airflow limitation with a range of pathological changes. both genetics and environmental factors trigger the onset of COPD, however, microbes including NTHi play an important role in the acute exacerbations. pathophysiology of COPD COPD is the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide expected to affect more than 210 million people by 2030. chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic cough with expectorations that last for more than 3 months within 2 years. it is associated with inflammation of the bronchial walls with increased inflammatory infiltrates, hyperplasia of goblet cells, hypertrophy of tracheobronchial submucosa, increased mucous secretion and dilatation of the airway ducts. the variability of COPD incidences among smokers is explained by a genetic pre-disposition, such as 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutis laxa. the 1-antitrypsin deficiency is caused by deleterious homozygous mutations in SERPINA1 which contribute to 1\u20132% of COPD cases. major ECM components are widespread in all lung compartments in COPD patients with a total increase of type I and III collagens, fibronectin, and laminin in parallel with reduced concentrations of proteoglycans, perlecan decorin, versican, biglycan, tenascin and elastin. harmful volatile chemicals derived from cigarette smoke (i.e., acetaldehyde, acrolein, and crotonalde gene alterations in phagosomal- and leukocyte transendothelial migration pathways (LTM) are significantly correlated with the level of T cells and airway obstruction in smokers. the LTM, however, were found to be further dysregulated in COPD patients. phosphorylation and acetylation enhance the interaction within the NF-B/CBP/p300 complex while stabilizing the DNA binding of NF-B. the complex then modifies the histones through CBP-mediated acetylations of histone H3 (at Lys9) and H4 at Lys 8 and Lys12, and phosphorylation of H3 at Ser10 by MSK1 and PKC. ases, mitogen and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1), protein kinase C zeta (PKC), and IB kinase (NEMO) promote activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF-B RelA/p65 (54, 57\u201364) this is followed by a complex formation of NF-B/CBP-p300 [coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP) or peroxinitrite is a by-product generated from the immune cell-derived nitrite oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of cigarette smoke. cigarette smoke disturbs the DNA methylation status of target genes through several mechanisms. increased activity of antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 and 1-antitrypsin in bronchial epithelial cells. these may contribute to anatomical anomalies in the airway and excessive inflammatory responses among smokers during the course of COPD. the inflammatory immune response in COPD COPD is associated with chronic inflammation in the peripheral airways orchestrated by both innate and adaptive immune responses. Activated epithelium produces TGF- and FGF that triggers the production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. increased deposition of ECM causes progression of fibrosis and air flow limitation. chemokines CXCL1 and IL-8, and LTB4 attract the circulating neutrophils through the receptors CXCR2 and CCR2. the dendritic cells uptake the antigen (smoke residues) and present the antigens to the nave T cells at lymph nodes. uncommitted T lymphocytes are then primed to the presented antigen. in total, NTHi infection in COPD lung adversely reduces production of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10, IL-22, TNF-, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and IFN-. this may explain the inefficient eradication of airway pathogens in COPD patients where persistent NTHi infection concomitantly escalates the inflammation. crophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF1/2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-1, C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL), CCL20, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) act on recruited immune cells to initiate the transmigration of circulating neutrophils occurs through adherence of the granulocytes to E-selectin of endothelial cells that is upregulated in COPD. the recruited neutrophils are then activated to secrete granule proteins [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil lipocalin] while releasing its own IL-8 for further neutrophilic recruitment. the NLRP3 inflammasomes are involved in the COPD airway inflammation by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-1, and IL-18. these cytokines are important for neutrophil survival and activation of T helper (Th) 17 cells. cytotoxic T cells (Tc; CD3+CD8+) express more CXCR3 receptors compared to healthy individuals. this enhances their migration toward chemoattractants CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 that are actively released by alveolar macrophages in COPD subjects. prolonged airway inflammation in COPD leads to serious side effects. abrogated local immune system may make the airways of COPD patients susceptible for opportunistic or recurrent infections by viruses and bacteria. effects of tobacco or cigarette smoke regulates airway gene expression via two main mechanisms. tones through CBP-mediated acetylations of histone H3 (at Lys9) and H4 at Lys 8 and Lys12. phosphorylation of H3 at Ser10 by MSK1 and PKC. NF-B is a key inflammatory and redox-sensitive transcription factor. by tobacco residues promotes activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF-B RelA/p65. this is followed by a complex formation of NF-B/CBP-p300. this is followed by a complex formation of NF-B/CBP-p300 at target DNA sequences. DNA damage caused by cigarette smoke stimulates the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT) to actively induce CpGs methylation at the damaged site (67) the hypermethylation is prone to introduce error of methylation in some target genes, resulting in reduced gene expression. increased numbers of inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators are accumulated in the airway lumen/wall in the lung parenchyma (19, 81) non-typeable H. influenzae-dependent immune responses in the lower airway of COPD patients result in inflammation. chemokines CXCL1 and IL-8, and LTB4 target the receptors CXCR2 and CCR2 on blood monocytes. Recruited blood monocytes differentiate into macrophages in the airway tissue. Activated alveolar macrophage and epithelium cell also release inflammasome (1L-1 and IL-18) for neutrophils survival. uncommitted T lymphocytes are then primed to the presented antigen. uncommitted T cells are activated by IL-12 derived from dendritic cells. cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subtype Tc1 releases perforin and granzyme B. NTHi infection in COPD lung adversely reduces production of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10, IL-22, TNF-, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and IFN-. innate immunity and inflammasome Lung structural cells are activated by inhaled irritants through the stimulation of several pattern recognitions receptors. transforming growth factor (TGF)-1, C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, CCL20, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) act on recruited immune cells and resident cells to initiate a series of innate immune responses (23, 86\u201390) activated alveolar macrophages further release more pro-inflammatory mediators and chemokines. granulocytes to E-selectin of endothelial cells upregulated in COPD (97) recruited neutrophils secrete granule proteins [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil lipocalin. neutrophils secrete serine proteases that are associated with alveolar destruction in emphysema. local airway NLRP3 inflammasome activation positively correlated with acute exacerbations and lower airway microbial colonization in COPD patients. adaptive immunity is initiated at a later stage, and is recognized by the increased number of T and B lymphocytes and pulmonary dendritic cells. chemoattractants CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 release perforins, granzyme B, and TNF- to induce alveolar cells apoptosis. pulmonary Th17 T cells are activated by alveolar macrophage-derived IL-6 and IL-23 to secrete IL-17A and IL-22 causing neutrophilic inflammation. airway inflammation in COPD as a result of impaired homeostasis leads to serious side effects. the abrogated local immune system may make the airways of COPD patients susceptible for opportunistic or recurrent infections by viruses and bacteria. activated alveolar macrophages act on recruited immune cells and resident cells to initiate a series of innate immune responses. increased levels of CCL2 and CXCL1 result in recruitment of blood monocytes expressing CCR2 and CXCR2. this may explain the rapid recruitment and excessive accumulation of monocyte-derived interstitial macrophages in the lung tissue of COPD patients. neutrophils also secrete serine proteases that are associated with alveolar destruction in emphysema. NE, cathepsin G, proteinase-3, and proteinase-3 are involved in the stimulation of mucus secretion from submucosal glands and goblet cells. NLRP3 inflammasomes are involved in the COPD airway inflammation by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL adaptive immunity in COPD is initiated at a later stage. dendritic cells are the major antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the airways. dendritic cells act by endocytosis of inhaled irritants. pulmonary Th17 T cells are activated by alveolar macrophage-derived IL-6 and IL-23 to secrete IL-17A and IL-22 causing neutrophilic inflammation (113, 114). inflammatory cytokines are also released by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) (115). the accumulation of B lymphocytes in the peripheral airway and within lymphoid follicles is associated with airway autoimmunity in the progression of the typical symptoms of an AECOPD include increased production of purulent sputum, dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and symptoms of a cold that may last from 7 days up to 12 weeks (15, 130, 131) it commonly occurs in patients with advanced COPD and results in additional therapy based on the level of exacerbations. PD, and virus identified as single or multiple infecting strains from up to 64% of COPD patients with exacerbations recorded between 2001\u20132017. most common infecting viruses are human rhinovirus, influenza virus A, respiratory syncytial virus, whereas parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, echovirus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus are considerably rare. viral infections destroy the tight junctions of the airway epithelial barrier while inducing epithelium apoptosis. this results in the onset of airway epithelium lining repair whereby the sloughed off dead cells would become a rich nutrient source for growth of infecting bacteria. the damaged epithelium lining further promotes bacterial colonization and subsequent epithelial transmigration into deeper tissues (162\u2013164) expression of microbial-induced AMP (human -defensin 2) is suppressed in airway epithelial cells when exposed to cigarette smoke (175, 176) both the alveolar and monocyte-derived macrophages in patients with COPD are defective in phagocytosis of bacteria such as H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. neutrophils from COPD patients are aberrant in chemotactic response with defective accuracy. COPD progression from stable state to an exacerbation could induce microbiota shift in the lower airway (bronchioles), sputum, and throat (151, 190\u2013196) decreased diversity in the lung microbiome has been reported to be related to disease severity, inflammation and decreased lung functions. the most commonly pathogenic bacterial species isolated from the lower airway of COPD patients during AECOPD are NTHi, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. bacterial colonization in the airways is more common with the same species during both stable disease (25\u201386%) and exacerbations (58. viral infections destroy the tight junctions of the airway epithelial barrier while inducing epithelium apoptosis. this results in onset of airway epithelium lining repair whereby the sloughed off dead cells would become a rich nutrient source for growth of infecting bacteria. the damaged epithelium lining further promotes bacterial colonization and subsequent epithelial transmigration into deeper tissues. both the alveolar and monocyte-derived macrophages in patients with COPD are defective in phagocytosis of bacteria such as H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae (177, 178), and in efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and epithelial cells. all these factors contribute to the failure to resolve inflammation in COPD leading to facilitated chronic microbial colonization. COPD progression from stable state to an exacerbation could induce microbiota shift in the lower airway (bronchioles), sputum, and throat. decreased diversity in the lung microbiome has been reported to be related to disease severity, inflammation and decreased lung functions in COPD. mucosal infections, including acute otitis media, sinusitis, and exacerbations in COPD, are nowadays associated with NTHi. the most common infection focus by H. influenzae is now community acquired pneumonia (CAP), whereas the incidence of historically common diagnoses such as meningitis and epiglottitis have significantly decreased. several studies have shown a significant increase in the Proteobacteria phylum, which includes Haemophilus spp., in individuals with both stable disease and AECOPD. a new strain of NTHi has, in one study, been linked to the onset of AECOPD (153). NTHi predominating species Sputum/Throat swab/PSB /BAL Culture and molecular typing of strains NTHi recovered in 35% of patients at any respiratory site NTHi recovered in 7% of intubated patients with respiratory exacerbation NTHi recovered in 57% of patients at any respiratory site. potentially pathogenic bacteria found in 48% of patients Wilkinson et al. (172) NTHi predominating species ( baselinea An increase in relative abundance of Haemophilus spp. as well as other bacteria typically associated with exacerbations Millares et al. (218) Sputum 16S rDNA No increase in numbers of proteobacterial sequences following rhinovirus infection N.A. significant increase in number of proteobacterial sequences, mainly H. influenzae, following Rhinovirus infection Molyneaux et al. (190) Sputum 16S rDNA N specific genetic islands have been reported to be enriched in NTHi strains isolated from COPD patients compared to commensal NTHi 222. peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin was found to be one of the most enriched proteins in NTHi during growth in COPD sputum. the genes affected by the regulation mechanism encoded for (among others) the HMW adhesins, LOS biosynthesis, and iron uptake. the authors reported that genetic changes occurred in 8 of the 12 investigated vaccine antigens during persistent infections. a majority of persistent NTHi strains that dwell in COPD patients continuously express one or more variants of the enzyme. however, a phase variation to an OFF-state can occur via slipped-strand mispairing over time. this suggests that during certain conditions, there is a fitness benefit in not expressing iga in the airways of COPD patients. the environment of the lower respiratory tract of COPD patients selects for NTHi strains that can upregulate adhesins, modify LOS biosynthesis pathways and increase antioxidant stress responses. these important colonization mechanisms thus provide researchers with viable targets for developing novel therapies. a chronic NTHi infection caused extremely high infiltration of phagocytes and lymphocytes in the airways of this particular mouse model. the airway walls of the infected animals were also thickened due to increased collagen deposition (fibrosis) that reflects the typical COPD features. NTHi stimulation of PRRs in immune activation is initiated via PRRs. TLR4 stimulation by NTHi LOS also contributes to activation of NF-B. both pathways activate NF-B through phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor IB. Dectin-1 and the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway also have proinflammtory effects upon interaction with NTHi. EFGR-dependent NF-B activation is mediated via an NF-B nuclear translocation-independent pathway. EFGR-dependent negative regulation of TLR2 may thus suggest a novel mechanism targeted by NTHi for immune evasion. synergetic action of NTHi and inflammatory mediators may act synergetically with NTHi on the airway epithelial and immune cells. synergetic interaction drives a positive feedback loop to amplify the NF-B transcriptional activity on proinflammatory genes and further augment airway inflammation. co-infection of human rhinovirus and NTHi on the airway epithelial cells also results in synergetic induction of CCL20 and IL-8. activated macrophages also release increased concentrations of TNF- and IL-1 (256), further enhancing the inflammatory synergetic effect of surrounding immune cells. phagocytic clearance of NTHi by alveolar macrophages involves adhesion or contact, phagocytosis and phagolysosomal processing of bacteria. in response to NTHi infection, human alveolar macrophages, and blood neutrophils produce extensive amount of intracellular and extracellular ROS. this leads to the formation of macrophage and neutrophil extracellular traps (METs and NETs, respectively) the CD40 ligand and IFN- increased levels of TNF-, IL-13, and IL-17, as well as altered IgG subclass production by plasma cells. a separate study in a COPD mouse model reported that NTHi infection causes increased production of airway type 1 interferon (1-IFN) mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) from COPD patients are more effective in response to NTHi stimulation and thus produce increased levels of IFN-, 3-, to 10-fold more than the COPD Th (CD4+) and Tc (CD8+) cells (276). however, the pulmonary MAIT cell immune responses are compromised in the presence of corticosteroids that are commonly used for the treatment of COPD. al polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is essential for the generation of mucosal sIgA. it is downregulated in COPD patients with a positive correlation to disease severity and increased level of TGF-1. a mouse model lacking the pIgR is therefore devoid of sIgA. the epithelium and alveolar macrophages are predominant cell types in the airway compartment. they comprise the first line of defense in the cellular immune response against potential inhaled pathogens and antigens. TLRs are PRRs that sense stimulation by NTHi-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) TLR2 and downstream activation of p38 MAPK/NF-B-dependent pathways result in expression of COX-2 and prostaglandin (E2) that promote inflammatory responses (245). both pathways activate NF-B through phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor IB (243, 246) direct activation of EFGR in alveolar cells and HMEE by NTHi-derived EGF-like factor has been shown to contribute to NF-B activation. EFGR-dependent NF-B activation is mediated via an NF-B nuclear translocation-independent pathway. EFGR-dependent negative regulation of TLR2 may thus suggest a novel mechanism targeted by NTHi for immune evasion by attenuating the responses of host PRR. synergetic interaction drives a positive feedback loop to amplify the NF-B transcriptional activity on proinflammatory genes. synergetic action of NTHi with both TNF- and TGF-1 enhances the production of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-8 from airway epithelial cells. IL-1 acts synergetically with NTHi to upregulate expression of AMP -defensin 2 (DEFB-4) via the p38/MAPK pathway. synergetic action may aid in the expansion of the inflammatory response. ylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade upon induction of macrophage PRRs by NTHi (256), leads to the formation of macrophage and neutrophil extracellular traps. this leads to the formation of macrophage and neutrophil extracellular traps (METs and NETs, respectively), with co-expression of MMP-12 for enhanced bacterial killing (263, 264) a separate study in a COPD mouse model reported that NTHi infection causes increased production of airway type 1 interferon (1-IFN) it was reported that DNA of NTHi acts as a PAMP in stimulating the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway. the impact of the bacterial DNA-induced 1-IFN in host immune/inflammatory response requires further investigations. antigen-specific Th17 cells from non-COPD mice recognize homologous and heterologous strains of NTHi. it is unclear whether the Th17 cell which is prone to the inflammatory response could be \u201ctrained\u201d to counteract the NTHi infection. a mouse model lacking the pIgR (/) is therefore devoid of sIgA and are susceptible to airway stimulation by an NTHi lysate resulting in increased inflammation and airway neutrophilia. augmented airway inflammation and plasma fibrinogen, but not systemic inflammation, were found to be constantly correlated with the increased bacterial load. cytokines in sputum include IL-8, MPO, and 1L-1. the compromised immune response in COPD has been regarded as one of the culprits for persistent airway colonization by NTHi. monocyte-derived macrophages from COPD patients are also defective in phagocytosis of NTHi and S. pneumoniae. the defective macrophages are not attributed to the alteration in cell surface TLR2 or TLR4 expression, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), CD163, CD36 or the mannose receptor (178). the unresponsive TLR2 and TLR4 in COPD alveolar macrophages to NTHi lipoprotein and Tc (CD8+) cells from COPD patients have increased expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR2/1 as well as Tc1 cytokines (IFN- and TNF-) compared to healthy individuals that may imply the auto-aggressive response of lung Tc cells in COPD lung inflammation (299) infection has a strong association with the carriage of TLR9 (T1237C) polymorphism instead of TLR2 (Arg753Gln), TLR4 (Thr399Ile; Asp299Gly), and TLR9 (T1486C) (302) the activation of TLR9-signaling cascade in pro-inflammatory cytokine response requires stimulation from microbial DNA. decreased phagocytosis of NTHi by COPD alveolar macrophages could be improved in presence of nuclear erythroid related factor 2 and microRNA MiR-328 (307, 308) cigarette smoke also impaired the IL-22 production that has a potential anti-bacterial activity while delaying the airway clearance of NTHi. antibody production by B cells has also been attenuated, with lower levels of specific anti-P6 antibodies and compromised IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA class switching. a recent and some previous cohort studies revealed that the level of airway antimicrobial cathelicidin (hCAP18/LL-37) in COPD patients increases gradually from the stable disease to exacerbation states. alveolar macrophages derived from COPD patients are dysfunctional in eradication of NTHi. defective phagocytosis is greater for NTHi than for M. catarrhalis. monocyte-derived macrophages from COPD are also defective in phagocytosis of NTHi and S. pneumoniae. LOS may be explained by the recently reported phenomenon of TLR tolerance (294) repetitive TLR stimulation of COPD alveolar macrophages with the same TLR ligands, Pam3CSK4 and LPS desensitizes the TLR2 and TLR4 respectively. the repetitive TLR stimulation further reduced the production of TNF-, CCL5 and IL-10 in alveolar macrophages. Tc cells from COPD patients have increased expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR2/1 as well as Tc1 cytokines (IFN- and TNF-) compared to healthy individuals that may imply the auto-aggressive response of lung Tc cells in COPD lung inflammation (299). however, the COPD Tc cells can only be stimulated by ligands for TLR2/1 (Pam3CSK4) yet tolerant to other exposure of tobacco or cigarette smoke can impair phagocytosis/engulfment of NTHi by alveolar macrophages isolated from COPD patients. also suppressed the TLR-induced TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10 production in COPD alveolar macrophages that have been pre-stimulated with TLR2, 4, or 5 ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS, or phase I flagellin, respectively) cigarette smoke impaired the IL-22 production that has a potential anti-bacterial activity while delaying the airway clearance of NTHi (311\u2013313) cigarette smoke also impaired the IL-22 production that has a potential anti-bacterial activity while delaying the airway clearance of NTHi. in are positively associated with NTHi airway colonization, sputum neutrophilia, and higher concentrations of IL-8. the increased level of cathelicidin could diminish or alter the balance in lung microbiota, and the immune/inflammatory response. a large body of evidence exists on the deleterious effects of tobacco smoke. tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones have developed clinical breakpoints for macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin. the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST) have not set any clinical breakpoints against this class of antibiotics due to lack of clinical data. some studies have considered the use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics in the management of patients with COPD. a cochrane review revealed no support for a reduced all-cause mortality or less hospital readmissions. however, more recent studies have shown a significant decrease in both the frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations when long-term azithromycin treatment was chosen. a highly efficient glycoconjugate vaccine has previously been developed against Hib. an identical strategy cannot be employed against NTHi due to the lack of a polysaccharide capsule. several promising candidates have been identified in the last 25 years, as excellently reviewed elsewhere. infections can slow down the debilitating effect of the disease. it is therefore critical to continue this line of research until such a vaccine has been obtained. a vaccine targeting NTHi is another important approach in controlling the inhaled immune response. author contributions Y-CS coordinated and drafted the major part of the manuscript. authors read and approved the final manuscript. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
