{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. it is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus (1). SADS-CoV was first discovered in suckling piglets with severe enteritis in south china. the complete genome sequence of CH/FJWT/2018 determined was 27,169 nt in length, excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. the genomic arrangement and corresponding nucleotide positions were as follows: open reading frame 1a (ORF1a), nucleotides 304 to 12456; ORF1b, nucleotides 12456 to 20489; ORF3, nucleotides 23881 to 24570; envelope gene, nucleot the spike (S) gene, and a 3-nt (GTA) deletion between nt 24773 and 24775 in the membrane (M) gene were more similar to those of bat-origin SADS-related coronaviruses (6) than to those of swine-origin SADS-CoVs. findings suggest that CH/FJWT/2018 was a novel SADS-CoV."}
