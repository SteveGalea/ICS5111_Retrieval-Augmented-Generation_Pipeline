{"summary": "H. cordata Thunb is the only species in the genus Houttuynia [2,3]. it propagates by formation and separation of underground stems and by parthenogenesis [4,5], although sexual reproduction has not yet been determined. it is distributed mainly in the central, southeastern and southwestern regions of China. large numbers of polymorphic fragments can be produced by inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR)-PCR at a relatively low cost [12,13] this technique has great potential in analyzing genetic variation below species level, particularly population structure and differentiation. results 2.1.

EM was not classified as one group based on ISSR markers. genetic structure of plant populations reflects interactions amongst a range of different processes, including the long-term evolutionary history of the species. this includes shifts in distribution, habitat fragmentation and population isolation, genetic drift, mating systems, as well as gene flow and selection. the estimate of gene flow (Nm) is low (0.2431); and the AMOVA test also showed that there was high genetic diversity among populations (77%) and low genetic diversity within the population (23%). the plant is a polyploidy complex with 36 to 126 chromosomes [19], which hinders gene exchanges among populations harboring different numbers of chromosomes. the largest and the smallest genetic distance between EM and other populations was 0.3659 (KM) and 0.1679 (YA), respectively, with a mean of 0.2882 0.0608. EM was not classified as one group based on ISSR markers. sample collection Leaf samples were collected from 266 individuals of H. cordata Thunb from 15 populations located in the natural distribution of the species in 13 provinces of china. leaves were dried, and preserved in silica gel until DNA extraction. 100 ISSR primers were tested on five random individuals from all the populations. amplification was performed in a 10-L reaction volume containing about 20 ng of template DNA, 1.0 L 10 PCR buffer, 2.0\u20132.2 mM MgCl2, 0.21 mM dNTPs. a negative control reaction without template DNA was also included. PCR products were separated in 1.2% agarose gels buffered with 1 TBE. only bands reproducible in different PCR reactions were further analyzed. the proportion of genetic divergence was estimated within and among populations as described by Nei [27], and GST was designated as the coefficient of gene differentiation among populations. gene flow estimates (Nm) were calculated as Nm = (1 \u2013 GST)/4GST [29]. Differentiation among population was analyzed with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) using Genalex 6.1 based on 999 permutations. individuals at least 2 km apart in each population to avoid sampling clonal relatives. Leaves were dried, and preserved in silica gel until DNA extraction. 100 ISSR primers were tested on five random individuals from all the populations. amplification was performed in a 10-L reaction volume containing about 20 ng of template DNA, 1.0 L 10 PCR buffer, 2.0\u20132.2 mM MgCl2, 0.21 mM dNTPs, 200 nM primers, and 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase. a positive control (PCR products amplified from a standard individual) and a Gene Ruler DNA 100 bp ladder (Bio Basic Inc.) were run on each gel for homology assessments of PCR products on different gels. only bands that were consistently amplified were considered. gene flow estimates (Nm) were calculated as Nm = (1 \u2013 GST)/4GST [29].
