{"summary": "the symptomatic case-fatality risk defines a case as someone infected. a precise definition of the CFR would need to include the risk period, e.g., the 1-month CFR of Ebola. a precise definition of the CFR would need to include the risk period. the CFR among ascertained cases will be higher than that among all cases. use sentinel surveillance sites to estimate multipliers between various levels of severity and extrapolate to a larger population. use travelers from high-burden areas with low ascertainment to low-burden areas with higher ascertainment to estimate incidence of infection. the denominator of the CFR (cases) includes persons who have not yet died of the infection, but will do so in the future. this bias will be particularly severe for infections that are increasing rapidly in incidence. this bias will be particularly severe for infections that are increasing rapidly in incidence and for which the infection\u2013death time interval is long. the CFR will typically be higher among detected cases than among the entire population of cases. the latter may include individuals with mild, subclinical, and asymptomatic presentations. the magnitude of this bias may be uncertain for a long period because the spectrum of clinical presentations is itself uncertain at the start of an outbreak of a new disease. in an ongoing epidemic, there will typically be a delay between the reporting of a case and the reporting of the death of that case, if the infected person dies. a simple division of the number of deaths reported by week w (green) by the number of cases reported by week w (blue) will underestimate the CFR because the numerator does not include all those cases in the denominator who will eventually die. the CFR will typically be higher among detected cases than among the entire population of cases. the latter may include individuals with mild, subclinical, and (under some definitions of \u201ccase\u201d) asymptomatic presentations. the magnitude of this bias may be uncertain for a long period because the spectrum of clinical presentations is itself uncertain at the start of an outbreak of a new disease. in an exponentially growing epidemic, there will typically be a delay between the reporting of a case and the reporting of the death of that case, if the infected person dies. a simple division of the number of deaths reported by week w (green) will underestimate the CFR because the numerator does not include all those cases in the denominator who will eventually die. several such strategies are described in Table 1. a bias could be measured as a risk ratio (RR), the ratio of CFR in group A to that in group B, or as an odds ratio (OR), the ratio of the odds of dying in group A and group B, or as a risk difference (RD), the difference between the CFR in group A and group B. if individuals are hospitalized in response to predictors of poor prognosis, hospitalization will be noncausally associated with poor outcome. this problem is common in the pharmacoepidemiology literature [27] sensitivity analysis could be performed to assess the plausibility of assigning any observed protective effect to this bias. a relative CFR, different from the null value in group B compared with group B, does not imply a causal effect of group. a relative CFR greater than 1 may not imply that hospitalization is harmful. two other biases, described below, could still affect the inference. a common cause of the exposure of interest (hospitalization) and the outcome (death), disease severity will likely affect the probability of hospitalization and the probability of death. the association between hospitalization and death among cases in the database may be non-null even if hospitalization and death were independent in the population of all cases. the association in the population between hospitalization on day 8 (an arbitrarily chosen day) and death is negative; individuals hospitalized on day 8 (an arbitrarily chosen day) of symptoms have a lower probability of death than those who are not hospitalized on day 8 of symptoms. the extent of selection bias may be measured as O R s = S 00 S 11 S 01 S 10. selection bias spuriously enhances the negative association between hospitalization on day 8 and death, on all scales: RR, OR, and RD. selection bias spuriously enhances the negative association between hospitalization on day 8 and death on the RR and RD scales. the hypothetical data in these tables show that selection bias may be either positive or negative on each of the three scales, depending on the specific probability of selection in each of the four states. survivorship bias can be avoided by limiting analyses of the intervention to those who remain alive on a certain day after becoming a case. follow-up of a cohort of contacts ascertained before becoming cases could eliminate hospitalization and mortality as predictors of inclusion in the database. sensitivity analyses could be performed to assess how strong such biases are likely to be. biases in Predicting Outcomes without Causal Interpretation often of interest to predict probability of mortality for an individual case of an infectious disease based on that individual\u2019s demographic and clinical data. the primary goal was to improve estimates of clinical prognosis, although observations about prognosis could later be used to generate causal hypotheses for further testing. analysis is to inform health care providers at a treatment center to make a better clinical decision based on an accurate prognosis of the patient presenting to them. the quantity of direct interest is the probability of death among pregnant women in the population they encounter. this value will differ from that in the database, which may have been enriched for individuals entered in the database because they died of the infection. the relative CFR calculated would be for treatment in one facility versus treatment in another. there will be a temptation to conclude treatment facilities with higher CFR are doing a worse job. if some treatment centers preferentially admit the most symptomatic patients, they may falsely appear to be less effective. there has been much debate about whether randomized studies comparing a treatment to a placebo are ethical. the biases described here should be kept in mind when evaluating the conclusions of such studies. biases identified on causal and (where applicable) prognostic inference. it appears desirable when possible to limit analysis to a subset of cases who have been followed prospectively since they became cases. cases identified by forward contact tracing are more representative of cases in the general infected population than those identified because of symptoms, medical need, or death. biases may be severe enough to lead to qualitatively mistaken inferences about the severity of the infection or about the impact of interventions (such as hospitalization) on mortality. the use of small but carefully defined cohorts of individuals followed from the time of infection or symptom onset may ameliorate many of these biases. key learning points Datasets available at the onset of new epidemics of infectious diseases are often collected for reasons other than epidemiologic analysis of absolute and comparative case-fatality risks (CFR) major sources of bias affecting the estimation of absolute CFR are differences in severity between all cases and the subset of cases who enter the dataset, typically leading to inflated estimates of CFR. qualitatively mistaken inferences about the severity of the infection or about the impact of interventions (such as hospitalization) on mortality may be misleading. the use of small but carefully defined cohorts of individuals followed from the time of infection or symptom onset may ameliorate many biases."}
