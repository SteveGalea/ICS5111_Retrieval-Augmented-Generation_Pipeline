{"summary": "the disease is due to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus. it has an envelope surrounding a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. severe outbreaks caused by a strain genetically distinct from the prototype strain CV777 based on analysis of the S genes have been reported in China since late 2010. reported over 1000 outbreaks across almost all (39/47) prefectures, killing approximately 500,000 pigs until July 2018. the strains are more similar to global PEDV strains detected in recent years than to classical strains detected in Japan decades ago. the strains are genetically closely related to strains widespread in the us and Korea in 2013\u20132014. onaviruses have large genomes of approximately 30 Kb, including for PEDV, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. we have infected gnotobiotic piglets with several recombinant PEDVs that were generated by reverse genetics to fully or partially replace S genes, but otherwise retain common genetic backbones. the highly virulent PEDV strain, OKN-1/JPN/2013 was isolated and maintained in Vero cells as described in our previous study [24]. Nucleotide and amino acid differences by comparison of the complete genomes between CV777 maintained in National Institute of Animal Health and reference CV777 (GenBank accession number AF353511). pBAC-PEDV-CV777-FL was generated on the backbone of SARS-CoV-Rep [36] using a Red/ET Recombination System Counter-Selection BAC Modification Kit. however, the S gene of pBAC-PEDV-CV777-FL was modified to encode the entire spike protein based on CV777 reference sequence. this clone was modified using the same kit to generate chimeric clones in which the S gene is fully or DMEM containing 5 g/mL of trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) Viruses were harvested 6 h thereafter by freeze-thawing transfected cells. vero cells were seeded onto a 35 mm dish, cultured overnight, washed three times with DMEM without FBS, and inoculated with 2 mL of P0 virus. piglets were randomly assigned to orally receive rPEDVGFP-S-OKN1 (105.8 TCID50/head, n = 4), or DMEM with no anything as mock control (n = 6). piglets were monitored for clinical signs and virus shedding until 28 DPI. all animals were monitored for clinical signs and virus shedding until 28 DPI. feces and sera, and virus distributions in tissues at 2 DPI were quantified by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR of the N gene. feces collected at peaks virus shedding were suspended at 10%, and inoculated into vero cells. inoculum was removed after 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. sera were removed after 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and plates were washed 5 times with PBS. wells were then reacted for 1h at 37 \u00b0C with 50 L/well of 1:50 goat anti-swine IgG (H + L) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. antibody titers are reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that produced clear, specific cytoplasmic staining. nucleotide and amino acid differences by comparison of complete genomes between CV777-niah and reference CV777. deletion nucleocapsid 26,940 c N t Gray shadows represent non-synonymous substitutions. strain, pBAC-PEDV-CV777-FL, was generated on the backbone of SARS-CoV-Rep [36] using a Red/ET Recombination System Counter-Selection BAC Modification Kit. however, the S gene of pBAC-PEDV-CV777-FL was modified to encode the entire spike protein based on CV777 reference sequence. chimeric clones in which the S gene is fully or partially (S1 subunit) replaced with that vero cells were seeded onto a 35 mm dish (VIOLAMO, Osaka, Japan), cultured overnight, washed three times with DMEM without FBS, and inoculated with 2 mL of P0 virus. after 2\u20133 h, wells were washed once with DMEM without FBS, and filled with 2 mL of DMEM containing 10 g/mL of trypsin and 0.3% tryptose sera were collected from each piglet every 2\u20133 days from 0 to 7 DPI and every 3\u20134 days thereafter. all animals were monitored for clinical signs and virus shedding until 28 DPI. titers were quantified by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. piglets randomly assigned to orally receive CV777-niah (106.3 TCID50/head, n = 3), its recombinant form, rPEDVGFP-CV777 (105.6 TCID50/head, n = 5), and the S-chimeric strain, rPEDVGFP-S-OKN1 (104.7 TCID50/head, n = 4) piglets were monitored for clinical signs and virus shedding until 28 DPI. feces collected at peaks virus shedding were suspended at 10%, and inoculated into vero cells. cells were then washed three times with DMEM without FBS, and filled with DMEM containing 10 g/mL trypsin and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth. inocula were washed with PBS once, and fixed with cold 70% acetone. plates were then air dried, sealed and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C. wells were then reacted for 1h at 37 \u00b0C with 50 L/well of 1:50 goat anti-swine IgG (H + L) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. two chimeric clones, pBAC-PEDVGFP-S-OKN1 and pBAC-PEDVGFP-S1-OKN1, were subsequently generated by replacing the S and S1 genes in pBAC-PEDVGFP-CV777. the P2 viruses isolated in Vero cells were confirmed the CPEs, the same as GFP expressions by microscopy. black boxes represent 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions. immunofluorescent assay for antibodies confirmed all PEDV-inoculated piglets were infected. clinical signs and geometric mean titers of antibodies at 28 days post-infection. Piglets inoculated with CV777-niah exhibited peak viral shedding of 108\u2013109 genome equivalents (GE)/mL in feces at 4\u20137 DPI. shedding elicited GFP expressions and CPEs in vero cells. piglets inoculated with parental strain CV777-niah (A,D), its recombinant form, rPEDVGFP-CV777 (B,E) and the S-chimeric strain, rPEDVGFP-S-OKN1 (C,F). clinical signs in piglets inoculated with S-chimeric and S1-chimeric PEDV strains. piglets were monitored for clinical signs until 28 days post-inoculation. fecal samples collected 1\u20132 DPI with the S- and S1-chimeric strains. in animals infected with the S1-chimera, viruses at 107\u20131012 GE/mL were widely distributed in the small and large intestines and in mesenteric lymph node. in contrast, fecal, sera, and tissue samples from mock-infected piglets tested negative on PEDV-specific PCR. the CV777 cDNA was assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and flanked at the 3\u2019 by 25 bp of poly(A), a hepatitis D virus (HDV) ribozyme, and a bovine growth hormone (BGH) sequence. the ORF3 gene was then replaced with GFP gene driven by the ORF3 transcription regulatory sequence to generate pBAC-PEDVGFP-CV777. rPEDVGFP-S-OKN1 developed mild diarrhea and anorexia 3\u20137 DPI. piglets inoculated with the recombinant strain exhibited peak viral shedding of 108\u2013109 genome equivalents (GE/mL) in feces. viral RNAs detected at 105\u2013106 GE/mL in sera 2\u20134 days after infection. recombinant and chimeric viruses collected from feces at peak virus shedding elicited GFP expressions and CPEs in vero cells. piglets inoculated with the rPEDVGFP-S-OKN1 and rPEDVGFP-S1-OKN1 strains exhibited acute severe watery diarrhea from 1 DPI. at 2\u20134 DPI, these animals additionally developed anorexia, lethargy, severe dehydration, weight loss, and astasia. on the other hand, piglets infected with culture medium did not develop clinical signs. piglets infected with the S-chimera viruses were mainly detected at 107\u20131010 GE/mL in intestinal tissues from the stomach to the rectum. in animals infected with the S-chimera, viruses at 107\u20131012 GE/mL were widely distributed in the small and large intestines and in mesenteric lymph node. piglets inoculated with the CV777-niah and its recombinant form showed similar symptoms and patterns of fecal virus shedding. pathogenicity of piglets inoculated with the prototype stain CV777 is identical to those observed by the north American PEDV stains. gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with rPEDVGFP-S-OKN1 (105.8 TCID50/head) exhibited extreme debilitating at 2\u20137 DPI, including severe watery diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, severe dehydration, weight loss, and astasia. in the second experiment, three five-day-old gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with the same strain (105.8 TCID50 chimeric strains with S and S1 genes from OKN-1/JPN/2013 appear to reproduce its virulence. the difference of pathogenicity in piglets using these recombinant viruses might be caused by the function of spike protein in virus entry or process of budding. genetics are needed to clarify the function and role of other PEDV genes. we generated recombinant PEDVs derived from the CV777-niah maintained in cell culture. the resulting strains caused severe clinical signs or high mortality in highly susceptible gnotobiotic piglets of different ages."}
