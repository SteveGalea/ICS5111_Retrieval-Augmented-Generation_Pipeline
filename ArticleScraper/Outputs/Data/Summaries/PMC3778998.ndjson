{"summary": "Methods Definitions We adopted the definition of public health emergency preparedness developed by Nelson et al in 2007. we used the definition of emergency public information and warning provided by CDC: \"the ability to develop, coordinate, and disseminate information, alerts, warning, and notifications to the public and incident management responders\" a new combination of terms was created to identify the articles of interest. the sensitivity was 94% on 20 articles with an agreement of 100% between the 2 reviewers. the time frame was created to include the September 11 attacks and early articles on the more recent H1N1 pandemic. 202 articles passed the title screening. the model was used to identify which sociodemographic variables were investigated as potential determinants of communication inequalities (eg, information access, exposure, processing, utilization, trust) the model was used to validate the model by verifying which associations between variables were confirmed by the literature. a new combination of terms was created to identify the articles of interest. the 5 journals cited above were selected because of the importance of including journals with both a broad public health scope. the new search methodology was applied to PubMed and Embase, selecting the year 2009 and the journals listed above. all articles were reviewed using the refined criteria. no discrepancies in the classification method were found at this point. majority of the articles were published by authors whose main affiliation was with institutions in the united states. most focused on infectious disease outbreaks (55%), followed by all-hazards (14%), terrorism or bioterrorism (17%), natural disasters (8%), radiological incidents (4%), and other causes (3%). authors from other countries were the only ones who studied communication issues during bioterrorism or terrorism attacks. 67% of empirical studies were cross-sectional, 11% case studies, and 4% longitudinal, and 1 had a quasi-experimental study design. only 4 of the empirical studies were supported by a theoretical framework. the most common public health emergency preparedness communication outcomes empirically studied were: information exposure (63%), trust and credibility in information sources (40%), information-seeking behaviors (29%), information processing (13%), and information-processing (13%), and information-processing (13%). the most common public health emergency preparedness communication outcomes empirically studied were: information exposure (63%), trust and credibility in information sources (40%), information-seeking behaviors (29%), information processing (13%, and information processing (13%). the most frequently researched were preventive behaviors (ie, immunization practices) in 65% of the studies, risk perceptions (54%), knowledge and awareness about specific threats (48%), and emotional response (ie, fear) (29%). risk perceptions were measured along 3 dimensions: likelihood, severity, and vulnerability. most population-based studies looked at the association between sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs and public health emergency preparedness outcomes. the literature has also focused on populations' perceptions and beliefs, such as personal and societal risk perception, self-efficacy, subjective norm, beliefs about the efficacy or safety of preventive measures. minority groups have consistently shown a lack of trust in the government. information dissemination (44%), risk perception (37%), public health response (27%), public trust (26%), policy and planning considerations (26%) other communication issues discussed included public concerns and fear (19%), public participation/public reaction (15%), risk reduction/assessment (10%), vulnerable populations (10%), cultural values (10%), exercises and drills (8%), uncertainty of information (6%), health literacy/self-efficacy (5%), and community preparedness (6%). only 2 studies examined the use of social media in the context of a crisis. the study was population based, of which 60% used a quantitative approach, 33% a qualitative approach, and 7% mixed methods. only 4 of the empirical studies were supported by a theoretical framework. sociodemographic variables were gathered in population-based studies to describe which variables are most frequently used to study populations exposed to public health emergency preparedness messages. age and gender were used in 81% of the studies, and race and ethnicity were taken into consideration in 50% of the studies. only 9% provided a clear definition of socioeconomic position and of the indicators being used. communication and preparedness outcomes empirically studied were: information exposure (63%), trust and credibility in information sources (40%), information-seeking behaviors (29%), information processing (13%), and information utilization (31%). risk perceptions were measured along 3 dimensions: likelihood, severity, and vulnerability. other communication and preparedness outcomes examined by the literature are described in Table 1. population-based studies looked at association between sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs and public health emergency preparedness outcomes. most population-based studies (75%, N=39) looked at the association between sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs and public health emergency preparedness outcomes. most of the articles were editorials or commentaries, of which 89% focused on specific communication topics and 11% described communication theories and their application to public health emergency preparedness. the topics most frequently addressed were risk communication (58%), information dissemination (44%), risk perception (37%), public health (system) response (27%), public trust (26%), policy and planning considerations (26%), and community preparedness (6%). despite the widespread use of social media, only 2 studies examined the use of social media in the context of a crisis. public information and warning is one of the most important capabilities in emergency preparedness, as seen from the responses to several types of disasters. more creative designs have been advocated to understand the role of communication during emergencies. a few studies have looked at population sociodemographic characteristics and behaviors as determinants of public health emergency preparedness communication outcomes. social determinants have been rarely investigated as well as physical or mental disabilities and their relationship with communication outcomes. a recent review of literature on issues related to communication to the public about chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorism support existing psychological models. this requires sound empirical knowledge that can inform how people learn about emergencies as well as the factors that influence their learning. the fact that only a small percentage of studies drew on a prospective design limits our understanding of how communications may be helpful during an emergency. health care poor underserved
