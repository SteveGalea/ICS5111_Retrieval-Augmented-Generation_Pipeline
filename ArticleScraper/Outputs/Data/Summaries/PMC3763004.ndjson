pseudoproblem. a teacher who needs to institute substantial external motivators for students to complete work has probably not found the proper problem to inspire active, student-centered learning. students can easily spot a rhetorical problem or pseudoproblem. the ultimate aim of education will be reflected in\u2014and communicated to students most vividly through\u2014the forms of evaluation. the problems students encounter can be of two general kinds: problems in which students can use knowledge that already exists or problems that involve research that generates new knowledge. students will draw on a known repertoire of knowledge. if one wants students to learn about the process of science or research, the problems should be about developing knowledge. if one wants students to learn about the process of science or research, the problems should be about developing knowledge. the benchmark content knowledge in standard science curricula originated long ago. the strategic pedadgogical constructivist will look to history for clues about how such concepts may be constructed from earlier facts and perspectives, as well as how they may be alternatively conceived or criticized. historians are able to render the historical context, bringing together experimental details with cultural events and scientific disputes. a problem-solving episode should be properly contextualized in history, not rationally reconstructed. the whole problem-solving episode should be amenable to retrospective analysis. historians should be at a relatively remote vantage point to see the culture as culture. close-ended problems tend to support naive epistemological understanding of knowledge as stable, predetermined, and authority based. naive epistemological understanding of knowledge as stable, predetermined, and authority based. close-ended problems tend to promote more creative skills and thus motivate a wider variety of students. a complete education helps develop skills in articulating ill-defined problems. problem-solving skills themselves may well be best developed when the problem is already well defined. a problem may be redefined or dissolved: that may be part of the solution. a special category of PBL involves investigating rich data sets. students may thus pose original problems that the data set may help answer. some students may not share the instructor's enthusiasm for investigation. complex problem may be at odds with an individual pursuing a problem of personal relevance. role-playing may be an effective pedagogical strategy for fostering a sense of personal responsibility through a vicarious as-if scenario. cases with multiple perspectives offer opportunities to teach about the social dimensions of developing knowledge and solving problems. goal is to guide students in learning discursive skills that contribute to such social-level analysis. even criticism may have a positive role, exposing weak assumptions or increasing rigor of evidence. in other cases, students may learn skills in negotiating solutions or finding creative ways to accommodate apparently incompatible views. teachers may be encouraged to include complex case studies or problems at some point in their courses as an indication of the real world and as an occasion for developing interpretive and organizational skills appropriate to such situations. in introducing PBL, one might aim initially to create successful experiences, to promote positive attitudes toward further work. students are asked to explain why a particular experimental control is appropriate in a given lab. in the next lab, they identify the appropriate control themselves. in the next lab, they select their own variable to investigate and the appropriate control. the teacher may provide plentiful background information, including standard lectures. or some intermediate form of support may be suitable to the aims and occasion at hand. solving the problem may be teacher-guided or student-directed. the teacher may provide plentiful background information, including standard lectures. or some intermediate form of support may be suitable to the aims and occasion at hand. the teacher may provide plentiful background information, including standard lectures. many educators construe CBL and PBL merely as methods. they imply that an instructor need only learn how to use the method. the misaligned objectives and teaching style can confound students and ironically tarnish teaching quality. BL strategies are not a panacea for any deficit in science education. the specific tool depends on particular contexts and values. even lecturing may have an indispensable role in conveying the overall structure and organization of a field's knowledge."}
