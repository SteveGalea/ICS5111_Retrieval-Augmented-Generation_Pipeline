{"summary": "endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane-bound compartment that plays important roles in many cellular processes such as calcium homeostasis and protein processing. secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized on ribosomes and translocated in an unfolded state into the ER lumen. the ER is loaded with extremely high concentration of proteins (>100 mg/ml), a concentration at which co-aggregation between proteins and/or polypeptides is the ER lumen has an oxidative environment, which is essential for protein disulphide isomerase (PDI)-mediated disulfide formation. the load of client proteins may exceed the assigned processing capacity of the ER due to physiological fluctuations in the demand for protein synthesis and secretion. resulting imbalance is referred to as ER stress (Figure 1). perturbation of ER homeostasis causes unfolded proteins to accumulate in the lumen of the ER. ER stress triggers an evolutionarily conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway designated as the unfolded protein response (UPR) if ER homeostasis or function cannot be re-established, programmed cell death will be activated by the UPR, presumably to protect the organism from the rogue cells that display misfolded proteins. the initial intent of the UPR is to reestablish homeostasis, relieve stress exerted on the ER, and prevent the cytotoxic impact of malformed proteins. the ER stress-induced cell death pathway is conserved throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. in arabidopsis thaliana roots, the mutualistic fungus Piriformospora indica induces ER stress but inhibits the adaptive UPR, resulting in a caspase 1-like mediated cell death. there is a strong practical demand for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the UPR. the type II ER stress sensor includes ATF6 and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6). the ER in yeast is controlled by only one signaling pathway, the type I transmembrane ER protein IRE1p. in the past several years, the plant UPR signaling pathway has begun to be explored. in this review, we discuss possible future directions of research on plant UPR, especially its role in viral infection. the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain BiP has been proposed as a master repressor of UPR. in normal cells, BiP keep UPR stress sensors in their inactive monomeric states. Conversely, in cells undergoing ER stress, BiP is released when sequestered by unfolded proteins. in unstressed acinar and fibroblasts cells, the luminal domains of PERK and IRE1 form a stable complex with the ER chaperone BiP. a wild-type BiP mutant that bears a point mutation in its ATPase domain abolishes DTT-induced ATF6 activation. three models are proposed to explain IRE1/PERK activation in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. direct recognition model outlines recent studies in yeast. three subpopulations of IRE1p co-exist within the cell. an inactive pool in equilibrium with an active unfolded protein-bound pool. the latter is sequestered by biP binding, designated the third set. the direct recognition model is strengthened by biochemical assays showing that unfolded proteins are IRE1p-activating ligands that could directly induce the UPR in yeast cells. this model is supported by the fact that recombinant luminal domains of the yeast IRE1p is associated with unfolded proteins in a cell-free system. however, this model remains controversial as there lacks evidence that unfolded proteins bind to IRE1 in vivo. recombinant luminal regions of human IRE1 do not interact with unfolded proteins in a cell-free system. the difference in IRE1 structure between yeast and human reminds us that the complexity of ER stress sensing is far beyond our understanding. many mammalian viruses have evolved to manipulate host UPR signaling pathways to promote viral translation and persistence in infected cells. flaviviruses such as japanese encephalitis virus trigger the specific UPR pathway, leading to enhanced protein folding abilities. ectopic expression of the protein, but not E1, core and NS3 proteins of HCV activates the expression of BiP. infection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes a transient increase in BiP levels at the early phase of viral replication. the most prominent phenomenon in plants induced by the UPR is the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone and protein-folding genes, such as BiP, CRT, and PDI. in plants, microarray-based analyses of gene expression have shown that BiP is upregulated in Arabidopsis in response to infections by Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV) TGBp3 modulates the UPR signaling as a means to cope with robust viral protein synthesis. the Vpu protein coded by HIV has been shown to trigger the degradation of the host CD4 protein by the 26S proteasome. this degradation is vital for virion release (Schubert et al., 1998; Meusser et al., 2005; Nomaguchi et al., 2008). it has been long known that BiP is more strongly induced by slowly folding proteins with a prolonged interaction with BiP than fast folding proteins. it has been long known that BiP is more strongly induced by slowly folding proteins with a prolonged interaction with BiP than fast folding proteins. in normal cells, BiP keeps UPR stress sensors in their inactive monomeric states through binding to their luminal domains. overexpression of wild-type BiP dramatically delays translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi. a biP mutant that bears a point mutation in its ATPase domain abolishes DTT-induced ATF6 activation. three models are proposed to explain ER stress sensing mechanism by IRE1/PERK. direct interaction of unfolded proteins with IRE1 stabilizes the cytosolic domains of clustered IRE1 molecules. in the second step, direct interaction of unfolded proteins with IRE1 stabilizes the cytosolic domains of clustered IRE1 molecules and thus causes IRE1 activation. IRE1 itself has the intrinsic ability to sense ER stress. analysis of mutation in biP ATPase domain further revealed that the conformational change in BiP induced by the binding of unfolded proteins to ATP-bound BiP leads to ATP hydrolysis, conversion of BiP to the ADP-bound state and release from IRE1. however, this model remains controversial as there is no time-course analysis of BiP dissociation and binding of unfolded proteins to IRE1. the difference in IRE1 structure between yeast and human reminds us that the complexity of ER stress sensing is far beyond our understanding. the difference in IRE1 structure between yeast and human reminds us that the complexity of ER stress sensing is far beyond our understanding. large amounts of viral proteins are synthesized in infected cells. this leads to an overwhelming load of unfolded or misfolded proteins. many mammalian viruses have evolved to manipulate host UPR signaling pathways. in virus-infected cells, the HN glycoprotein is inserted into the ER. ectopic expression of the E2 protein, but not E1, core and NS3 proteins of HCV activates the expression of BiP. infection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes a transient increase in BiP levels. the most prominent phenomenon in plants induced by the UPR is the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone and protein-folding genes. the most prominent phenomenon in plants induced by the UPR is the transcriptional induction of ER chaperone and protein-folding genes, such as BiP, CRT, and PDI. TGBp3 modulates the UPR signaling as a means to cope with robust viral protein synthesis. in the case of HIV, the Vpu protein coded by HIV has been shown to trigger the degradation of the host CD4 protein by the 26S proteasome. this degradation is vital for virion release. K pathway and protein synthesis control PERK is a ER-localized type I transmembrane protein, with a catalytic kinase domain sharing substantial homology to other kinases of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein leads to oligomerization of PERK in the ER membranes, inducing its trans-autophosphorylation and kinase domain protein kinase PERK oligomerizes in the ER membrane and is activated via trans-autophosphorylation. the activated PERK phosphorylates a subunit of eIF2 which inhibits the exchange factor eIF2B from recycling eIF2 to its active GTP-bound form. a constitutive phosphatase CreP also promotes eIF2 dephosphorylation. viruses such as LCMV may selectively activate the branches of the UPR to favor their replication. at present, no PERK-like pathway has been found in plants. prolonged suppression of protein synthesis is typically incompatible with cell survival. ase complexes that independently dephosphorylate eIF2 dephosphorylation. CReP is constitutively expressed and contributes to baseline eIF2 dephosphorylation. GADD34 is induced as part of the gene expression program activated by eIF2 phosphorylation and serves in a negative feedback loop that regulates eIF2 activity. virulence factor, the 134.5 protein encoded by HSV1, has been shown to have a critical role in mediating eIF2 dephosphorylation in virus-infected cells. also, the 134.5 protein can alleviate the translation arrest caused by the UPR inducing compounds DTT and thapsigargin. eIF2 phosphorylation is maintained at a lower level in order to restore protein translation. in vero (African green monkey kidney) cells infected by ASFV, PERK activation seems not to be induced. it is well documented that the human DNA virus CMV perturbs the PERK pathway. expression of ATF4 leads to activation of target genes involved in the maintenance of metabolism and redox state. the PERK pathway is also associated with infections by RNA viruses. it remains unclear how the translation attenuation resulting from PERK activation is overcome by BVDV. IRE1 is the first UPR transducer identified by a mutation screen in yeast. IRE1 has an ER luminal amino-terminal domain and a site-specific carboxyl-terminal endoribonuclease. in response to ER stress, IRE1 is activated directly and/or indirectly by unfolded proteins. spliced XBP1s encodes a potent transcriptional activator (XBP1u) whereas the unspliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1u) encodes an inhibitor of the UPR (XBP1u) in mammals, it seems that XBP1s regulates a subset of UPR genes that promote ERAD of misfolded proteins and refold proteins. activated IRE1 can promote the cleavage of m bZIP60u undergoes a proteolytic processing, releasing bZIP60s. the role of the UPR pathway in virus infection has only begun to be investigated in plants. critical unanswered questions need to be addressed in the future. propose an XBP1-independent post-transcriptional mechanism for IRE1 to regulate gene expression that remodels the protein repertoire. however, it is unknown whether the mRNA degradation is promoted by IRE1 with its own endonuclease activity. in metazoans both the precursor and spliced form of XBP1 are translated. IRE1-XBP1 pathway to stimulate HCV expression is unclear. XBP1 itself is targeted for proteasomal degradation, limiting its transcriptional regulation activity. however, how HCV replicons direct XBP1 to be degraded remains to be understood. in yeast, levels of XBP1 mRNA also increase upon UPR induction. influenza A virus activates the IRE1 pathway with little or no concomitant activation of the PERK and ATF6 pathways. inhibition of IRE1 activity leads to decreased viral replication, suggesting that IRE1 is a potential therapeutic target for influenza A virus. it has been almost one decade since IRE1 homologs were detected in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice (Koizumi et al., 2001; Okushima et al., 2002). it is clear that the mRNAs of Arabidopsis bZIP60 (AtbZIP60) and its rice ortholog OsbZIP50, collectively called bZIP50, are spliced by IRE1 the nuclear-localized AtbZIP60 forms a transcriptionally active protein complex of approximately 260 kDa. it activates the transcription of UPR genes, such as BiP3, via the cis-elements plant-UPR element and ER stress response element. the truncated species of bZIP60 has recently been suggested to be the product translated from the spliced mRNA mediated by IRE1. ATF6 translocates from the ER into the Golgi apparatus. once translocated to the Golgi, it is proteolytically processed by Golgi-resident intramembrane proteases. this proteolytic processing releases its cytoplasmic DNA-binding domain, ATF6f (a fragment of ATF6). replication of IRE1-bZIP17/bZIP28 suppresses the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. however, in cells infected by HCV replicons, subgenomic replication results in the activation of the ATF6 pathway. at present, it remains elusive which non-structural viral proteins are involved in induction of ATF6. a different pattern has been reported in cells infected with HBV. expression of the multifunctional regulatory protein of HBV alone is sufficient to activate both the ATF6 and IRE1-XBP1 pathways. HBx-mediated activation of these pathways promotes HBV replication in liver cells. bZIP17 and bZIP28 undergo proteolytic processing and translocation in a manner similar to the animal ATF6-S1P/S2P system. bZIP17 and bZIP28 activate genes involved in the UPR and other signaling pathways such as brassinosteroid signaling transduction. no information is available at present about their roles in viral infection. a pro-apoptotic factor CHOP is regulated by both the ATF6 and PERK pathways. mutant analyses have revealed that the IRE1-XBP1 and the ATF6 arms of the UPR might activate a common set of genes involved in stress tolerance and worm development. this indicates a functional redundancy between these two arms. bZIP28 proteolytic activation and bZIP28 mRNA splicing could be induced concomitantly in response to heat stress. PERK pathway and protein synthesis control PERK is a ER-localized type I transmembrane protein, with a catalytic kinase domain sharing substantial homology to other kinases. ER stress-activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2 on Ser51. it inhibits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B from recycling eIF2 to its active GTP-bound form. as a result, mRNA translation is shut off and the load of newly synthesized proteins is reduced. PERK oligomerizes in the ER membrane and is activated via trans-autophosphorylation. the activated PERK phosphorylates a subunit of eIF2 which inhibits the exchange factor eIF2B from recycling eIF2 to its active GTP-bound form. dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) can also activate this pathway independently of PERK. a chemical inhibitor that sustains phosphorylation of eIF2 protects rat pheochromocytoma cell from ER stress. prolonged suppression of protein synthesis is typically incompatible with cell survival. it is well known that phosphorylated eIF2 is also subject to negative regulation. in mammalian cells, a considerable body of evidence has indicated the association of viral replication with the PERK pathway. a virulence factor, the 134.5 protein encoded by HSV1, has been shown to have a critical role in mediating eIF2 dephosphorylation in virus-infected cells. the 134.5 protein also inhibits the activity of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) like GADD34, the 134.5 protein can recruit protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2 and block translation shutoff during viral infection. ER stress and the UPR are evident in the course of productive infection by African swine fever virus. it is not clear if DP71L also involves in the inhibition of PERK activation. it is well documented that the human DNA virus CMV perturbs the PERK pathway. PERK is not phosphorylated in the early phase of viral replication. topathic strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus activates PERK and causes hyperphosphorylation of eIF2. it remains unclear how the translation attenuation resulting from PERK activation is overcome by BVDV. viruses such as LCMV bypass the PERK pathway to selectively activate the ATF6 pathway. IRE1 signaling does not have selected downstream kinase targets because the only known substrate of the kinase domain of IRE1 is IRE1 itself. IRE1 oligomerizes in the plane of the ER membrane in stressed cells. in mammals, it seems that XBP1s regulate a subset of UPR genes that promote ERAD of misfolded proteins and refold proteins. 1 can promote the cleavage of mRNAs, including XBP1 mRNA, leading to their degradation. this reduces the load on the stressed ER and may facilitate reprogramming of the ER-associated protein synthesis and translocation machinery. the spliced version of XBP1 (termed XBP1s) upregulates a general population of UPR-related genes mainly involved in protein folding and ERAD. however, it is unknown whether the mRNA degradation is promoted by IRE1 with its own endonuclease activity. the unspliced XBP1 (designated XBP1u) is labile and inhibits transcription of UPR target genes. in yeast, the translation of unspliced HAC1 mRNA is repressed due to the presence of intron. relief of this repression is the key step in activating the yeast UPR. the XBP1u mRNA itself may terminate the IRE1 signaling pathway by inhibiting heterodimerization with spliced XBP1 and/or competition for binding sites. however, it is unknown if HCV infection increases the level of XBP1u mRNA and thus suppresses the transcriptional activity of XBP1s. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is non-essential for its replication, although XBP1s is induced. it has been almost one decade since IRE1 homologs were detected in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice. s of arabidopsis bZIP60 (AtbZIP60) and its rice ortholog OsbZIP50, collectively called bZIP50, are spliced by IRE1. the bZIP60 mRNA shares similar secondary structure with HAC1 and XBP1 mRNA. plant bZIP60 is synthesized at a low level as a precursor protein. the role of the bZIP60-mediated UPR has been demonstrated for the first time in infection by a plant virus. it is suggested that the bZIP60-mediated UPR may be important to regulate cellular cytotoxicity and beneficial to PVX pathogenesis. the mechanism by which bZIP60 is manipulated by the virus and how bZIP60 operates in induction of the UPR are not clear. domain, ATF6f, operates as a transcriptional activator that upregulates many UPR genes related to protein folding. in unstressed cells, ATF6 in animals and bZIP17/bZIP28 in plants reside in the ER membrane. these proteins are subject to cleavage twice, first by the lumenal S1P and then the intra-membrane S2P. a selective induction of the ATF6-regulated branch of the UPR is likely beneficial for virus replication and cell viability, whereas pathways controlled by PERK and IRE1 are silent. a different pattern has been reported in cells infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) both the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways are activated during Rotavirus infection. another scenario has also been found in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. the three branches of the UPR signaling cascades might be hijacked by DEN. bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway has been shown to be triggered by heat stress. no information is available about their roles in viral infection. ire1, PERK, and PERK pathways communicate with each other extensively. all the three arms could induce ERAD (Schr\u00f6der and Kaufman, 2005), representing a common cellular process resulting from the three UPR branches. crosstalks add to complexity of the UPR induced by abiotic and biotic cues such viral infection. bZIP28 proteolytic activation and bZIP60 mRNA splicing could be induced concomitantly in response to heat stress. this assumption is in agreement with another recent observation that bZIP28 is capable of forming a heterodimer with bZIP60. despite recent advances in understanding the mechanisms implicated in abiotic and biotic stress such as viral infection, many critical questions remain unanswered. a key direction for future study in this field is to define how the ER stress is sensed and how those branched pathways are coordinated to function. in response to specific viral infection and other stimuli, little is known about the regulation of UPR signaling in distinct cells."}
