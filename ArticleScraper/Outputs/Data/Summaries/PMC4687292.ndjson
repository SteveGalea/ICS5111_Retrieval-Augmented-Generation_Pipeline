{"summary": "cats that are infected with the feline leukemia virus develop a progressive infection resulting in persistent viremia, immunodeficiency, tumors, anemia and death. ten cats that received a transfusion of blood from aviremic provirus carriers developed active FeLV infections, some with a progressive outcome and the development of fatal FeLV-associated disease. our results have implications for veterinary medicine, such as the requirement for testing blood donors and blood products for FeLV provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction."}
