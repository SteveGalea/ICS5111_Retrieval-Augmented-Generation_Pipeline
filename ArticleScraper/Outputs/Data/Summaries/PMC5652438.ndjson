{"summary": "conference aimed to cut across these divisions to bring together researchers working with different respiratory viruses and using different experimental approaches. agenda The conference was organized around 4 themes (Table) an international scientific committee developed the program and invited 21 experts to discuss the full range of the conference themes. the importance of standardizing how such transmission experiments are carried out is challenging but important for results to be comparable. the importance of standardizing how such transmission experiments are carried out is challenging but important for results to be comparable. improved understanding of airflow and aerosol dispersion in health care settings may lead to improved engineering designs to reduce risk of nosocomial transmission. presentations provided data on age-specific contact patterns between humans and other animals and their relevance for mathematical modeling of transmission dynamics. zoonotic respiratory pathogens, such as avian influenza H5Nx and H7N9, swine influenza H1N1 and H1N9, canine influenza H3N8 and H3N2, and MERS coronaviruses, were presented. a section of the conference focused on the study of airborne virus particles."}
