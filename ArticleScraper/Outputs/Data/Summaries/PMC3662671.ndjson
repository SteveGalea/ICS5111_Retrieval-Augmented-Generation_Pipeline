{"summary": "RNA genomes serve the traditional role as the blueprint for viral proteins. but they also contain cis-acting RNA elements (RE) that direct different viral processes, such as protein translation, genome replication and transcription of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. one solution used is to position REs in non-coding regions, thereby physically separating coding and RE functions. interactions between genomic termini have been identified in other types of plus-strand RNA viruses. long-range interactions are also used for viral RNA genome replication in bacterial (i.e. phage Q-beta) [12], plant (i.e. tombusviruses) [13] and animal viruses (i.e. flaviviruses) [14], where viral polymerase binding sites are located 5\u2032-terminally or internally in the RNA genome. long-range the prevalence of long-range RNA-RNA interactions in a variety of viruses in both coding and non-coding regions suggests that their genomes must maintain a considerable level of global organization. however, for standard plus-strand RNA viruses (i.e. non-retroviral), no detailed genome-scale models of higher-order structure exist. translation of p33 requires the longest interaction, which occurs between the 3\u2032CITE in the 3\u2032UTR and the genomic 5\u2032UTR [25]. Genome replication requires an interaction between the upstream linker (UL) sequence just 3\u2032 to the essential replication element RII(+)SL and the downstream linker (DL) in the 3\u2032UTR [13]. this latter interaction is also needed for efficient translational readthrough that generates p92 [26]. each double-headed arrow connects a complementary cognate sequence pair identified by their acronyms. the coordinates for complementary segments are provided in parentheses. TBSV genomes exist primarily as compact irregular structures, with average maximum diameters of 98 12 nm (n = 40) a theoretical maximum ladder distance (MLD) of 248 bp was calculated for the TBSV genome, which represents the number of base pairs passed when spanning the two furthest points in the optimal structure. the TBSV genome assumes a mostly condensed structure that is composed of interconnected domain-like protrusions extending from a central hub. extended genome configurations suggest smaller consecutive locally-folded domains, while more condensed structures are consistent with genome configurations that include multiple long-distance RNA-RNA interactions. heavily modified positions are predicted to correspond to nucleotides that are primarily single-stranded. unmodified or weakly modified residues are considered to be mainly paired. inflexible regions can also correspond to non-Watson/Crick base pairs or tertiary interactions. RNA secondary structure model was predicted by SHAPE-guided RNAstructure-based analysis. RNA structure generated included only secondary structures formed by canonical base pairs. nucleotides in grey correspond to regions for which no SHAPE data were available. structural model revealed distinct sub-regions of RNA secondary structure that we herein define as RNA domains. the boundaries (i.e. closing stems) of several of these domains were closely associated, leading to their emergence from a common area and an overall floret-like organization. a very recent report of the in vitro structure of the 1 kb long plus-strand RNA genome of satellite tobacco mosaic virus predicted a highly extended secondary structure [39] that contrasts the highly condensed structure proposed for TBSV. the RNA domains could be divided into groups based on their relative sizes (i.e. small, 80\u2013200 nt; medium, 200\u2013500 nt; large, 500\u20132000 nt) structure containing the PRTE that interacts with the DRTE in SD3 to mediate readthrough [26] mD2 contains the large stem-loop structure RII(+)-SL and the UL sequence. mD3 corresponds to the 3\u2032CITE that is important for translational enhancement [25], [41]. the genomic regions corresponding to defined domains are labeled and represented by colour coded bars below the genome. each dot represents a nucleotide and domains are labeled and colour-coded as in panel (A) inter-domain regions are depicted in black. a functional element, the DL sequence, is complementary to the UL sequence in mD2. in the structure, some of DL sequence is part of a small local stem-loop structure. three of the four lDs are grouped consecutively, are closely linked. reactivities were not available for the PRTE and DRTE due to \u201cblind spots\u201d in the analysis. of the remaining partner elements, high reactivities were abundant in both complementary sequences for the 5\u2032UTR-3\u2032CITE interaction, the UL sequence, and the AS2 element (Table S2). the long-range interactions were not predicted, the cognate partner sequences tended to be in proximity of each other in the predicted secondary structure. this suggests that the secondary structure level of viral genome structure could provide a basic scaffold for the formation of different long-range interactions. sg mRNA transcription are not restricted to tombusviruses. corresponding predicted RNA secondary structures in the genomes of the insect nodavirus Flock House virus and the animal coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. the interacting transcriptional segments were located near the closing ends of RNA domains. the formation of lD2 would act to bring together distally positioned AS1 and RS1 elements. the AS1 in the loop of the local stem-loop structure would initiate the interaction by pairing with RS1. the stem would melt and allow those residues to pair with sequences flanking RS1. this would stabilize the interaction and forming the closing stems of lD2. functional relevance of components in the TBSV genome structural model. SHAPE data were incorporated into our analysis. the results would provide some feedback as to the effectiveness of the incorporated data. the most destabilized mutant, S27A, showed a decrease in accumulation to 47%, while the relative level of the RTD-23 replicon increased to 190%. the observation that S27A with the most destabilized structure was least able to compete effectively against the replicon suggests that this structure confers a fitness advantage at the single cell level. a longer-range 13 base pair long interaction spanning an intervening sequence of 190 nts was predicted only by SHAPE-plus analysis. this interaction formed a helix, S31, that closed mD2 (Figures 3 and 4) and was of particular interest because the intervening sequence included two important RNA replication elements. the name and changes made in S31 in the genomic mutants are shown above each lane. values represent means with standard errors from three independent experiments. the location of the interaction close to two RNA replication-related elements suggested a possible role in mediating genome replication. mutant halves were united in DICL-C so as to restore base pairing potential, an accumulation level 55% that of wt was observed. the apparent phenotype observed for disruption of S31 contrasts the more subtle differences seen for S27 mutants. however, both results help to functionally validate components of the SHAPE-plus model. in vitro and in vivo studies in tombusviruses have provided evidence that discontinuous copying can occur during genomic minus-strand synthesis. recombination occurs when the viral polymerase dissociates from its template along with its nascent strand and then rebinds some distance upstream. global structure is likely determinant of intramolecular recombination events. a common strategy used to define the role of a viral protein is to mutate its corresponding ORF in the infectious clone. the modification of a coding region could also alter an overlapping functional RNA structure, which would greatly complicate the interpretation of results. the genome assumes a floret-like structure that includes multiple long-range RNA-RNA interactions. the simultaneous presence of the AS1-RS1 and DE-CE interactions in our model suggests that transcriptional-related interactions are structurally compatible. however, the absence of other known long-distance interactions in the structure implies the requirement for dynamic structural transitions. a theoretical maximum ladder distance (MLD) [30] of 248 bp was calculated for the TBSV genome. this represents the number of base pairs passed when spanning the two furthest points in the optimal structure, predicted by the RNAstructure software. the TBSV genome assumes a mostly condensed structure that is composed of interconnected domain-like protrusions extending from a central hub. extended genome configurations suggest smaller consecutive locally-folded domains. more condensed structures are consistent with genome configurations that include multiple long-distance RNA-RNA interactions. full-length transcripts of the TBSV genome were denatured, snap-cooled, and then refolded in an effort to minimize intermolecular interactions. SHAPE reactivity data were collected for 91% of the 4778 nt long TBSV genome. the final values were derived from the average SHAPE reactivities. no reactivity data were collected for the 5\u2032-terminal 9 nt and the 3\u2032-terminal 83 nt of the genome. RNA structure model was predicted by SHAPE-guided RNAstructure-based analysis. RNA structure generated included only secondary structures formed by canonical base pairs. nucleotides are colour-coded according to their SHAPE reactivities. SHAPE and thermodynamics predicted 60.4% of the genome to be base paired. exclusion of the SHAPE data reduced overall predicted pairing by 5%. compared to HIV-1, the SHAPE data for the TBSV genome were more consistent with the thermodynamics-only prediction. three small, three medium, and four large domains were defined. the three small domains corresponded to the 5\u2032UTR (termed sD1, 166 nt long, genome coordinates 1\u2013166), the terminal 81 nts of the 3\u2032-UTR (sD3, 81 nt, 4697\u20134777), and an internal region in the p33 ORF (sD2, 174 nt, 747\u2013921). the role of four large domains (lD) correspond to the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the p33 ORF (lD1, 547 nt, 172\u2013718), the 3\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the readthrough portion of the p92 ORF (lD2, 1047 nt, 1589\u20132635), the CP ORF (lD3, 1192 nt, 2639\u20133830), and the overlapping p22/19 OR each dot represents a nucleotide and domains are labeled as in panel (A) the regions containing complementary segments known to form functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions are labeled. some of the inter-domain regions contained RNA elements known to be functional. analysis of the structural model for the TBSV genome revealed several interesting features. three of the four lDs are grouped consecutively, are closely linked (i.e. have small connecting inter-domain segments), and are positioned more centrally in the genome. a third of the known functional long-distance RNA-RNA interactions are present in the model. analysis of the 1000 suboptimal SHAPE-plus structures did not predict formation of any of these interactions. however, it may not be possible for all six distinct interactions to occur simultaneously due to local and/or global conformational constraints. 78 bp (21 nm), 29 bp (8 nm), 20 bp (5.5 nm) and 9 bp (2.5 nm) such proximity could facilitate structural transitions required to allow other interactions to form. both of these interactions act to close large domains, lD2 and lD3, respectively. the interacting transcriptional segments were located near the closing ends of RNA domains, suggesting that domain formation could represent a common conformational strategy used by different RNA viruses for uniting distal regulatory RNA sequences. the AS1-RS1 interaction involving the terminal regions of the large domain lD2 is particularly intriguing. this pairing scheme is reminiscent of the classical regulatory interaction that takes place in E. coli between Hok mRNA and Sok-antisense-RNA. the initial contact between the loop within the mRNA and an unpaired region in the antisense RNA is followed by melting of the stem and formation of additional pairing between the two RNAs. however, in this latter case the interaction is intermolecular, and thus dependent on the concentrations of the two RNAs. two RNA structures that were predicted to form by SHAPE-plus analysis were selected for functional investigation. the results from these analyses would provide some feedback as to the effectiveness of the incorporated SHAPE data. the first structure examined was a local extended stem-loop structure within mD1 in the p92 coding region. the most destabilized mutant, S27A, showed a decrease in accumulation to 47%, while the relative level of the RTD-23 replicon increased to 190%. the observation that S27A with the most destabilized structure was least able to compete effectively against the replicon suggests that this structure confers a fitness advantage at the single cell level. two species in the genus, MNeSV and CBLV, contained covariations that maintained S31. substitutions in the 5\u2032 half of this stem were not silent. this resulted in two amino acid substitutions (Gly390Ala and Arg391Ser) the name and changes made in S31 in the genomic mutants are shown above each lane, with substitutions depicted in red. values represent means with standard errors from three independent experiments. location of interaction close to two RNA replication-related elements suggested a possible role in mediating genome replication. the apparent phenotype observed for disruption of S31 contrasts the more subtle differences seen for S27 mutants. the TBSV genome structure is intimately involved in the fundamental viral processes of protein translation, genome replication, and sg mRNA transcription. in vitro and in vivo studies in tombusviruses have provided evidence that discontinuous copying can occur during genomic minus-strand synthesis. global structure is a likely determinant of intramolecular recombination events leading to the generation of deletions in genomic RNA. structural models such as that for the TBSV genome should prove useful in designing viral vectors that are compatible with the natural organization and function of viral genomes. however, the accuracy of many aspects of the structure still remains to be investigated. structural transitions may occur readily in a cellular environment that includes both viral and host proteins that could mediate structural rearrangements. a possible candidate for this role is the abundant viral protein p33. a 20 l volume of the diluted RNA sample was deposited on freshly cleaved mica and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. sample was rinsed with double distilled water, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and imaged using AFM tapping mode in air. TBSV genomic RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription using ampliScribe T7-Flash Transcription Kits and purified by two rounds of ammonium acetate precipitation. 70% of the genomic TBSV RNA was determined to be intact, as estimated by ethidium bromide staining. 19 primers were designed to cover the TBSV genome with an average coverage distance of 360 nt per primer. each primer was synthesized with 4 different florescent dyes at the 5\u2032end and purified by reverse-phase cartridge purification method (Sigma-Genosys) q-G and 6 L primer (4 M, LICOR IR 800) were added to another aliquot of 20 L denatured RNA (Seq-T) after primer and RNA annealing at 65\u00b0C for 5 min and then 37\u00b0C for 5 min, 2 L of ddGTP (0.5 mM) and 2 L ddTTP (10 mM) were added to Seq-G and Seq-T, respectively. the scale of each channel in a trace was adjusted using the scale factor tool. for accurate subtraction of background intensities, the peak sizes in the () channel were adjusted to the same intensities as the peaks in the (+) channel. the align and integrate tool was used to calculate and align nucleotide activity to the RNA sequence. the raw SHAPE reactivities were normalized using the box-plot normalization method. all data lying outside 1.5 times the interquartile range were identified as outliers. all data (including outliers) were then multiplied by the reverse of the normalization factor. the pfs file was generated over the range of nts 167\u20134696. for the SHAPE-constrained structures the pfs file was generated over the range of nts 1\u2013166, nts 4697\u20134778, resp.. plus sampled structures and ii) 1000 SHAPE-minus sampled structures were calculated together with their maximum and minimum values over the ensembles. mutant TBSV genomes were constructed based on T100, where modifications were introduced using PCR-based mutagenesis and standard cloning techniques. image height scale was typically of the order of ca. 3 nm; exact scales are provided for each image. in vitro transcription, protoplast transfection, and viral RNA analysis Viral RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. 240 L of 3.3 folding buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA) was added, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. RNA modification Three hundred and sixty L of the folded RNA was treated with 40 L of 50 mM 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7) and another 360 L aliquot of the folded RNA was treated with 40 L neat DMSO. twelve L SHAPE enzyme mix (167 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 250 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 16.7 mM DTT, 1.67 mM dATP, 1.67 mM dTTP, 1.67 mM dTTP, 1.67 mM dCTP, 1.67 mM dITP) was added to each tube and incubated at 52\u00b0C for 2 min. capillary electrophoresis cDNA samples were separated in a 33 cm long (75 m inner diameter) capillary using a Beckman CEQ800 DNA sequencer. samples were denatured at 90\u00b0C for 120 seconds, injected at 2.0 kV for 6 to 15 sec, and separated at 4 kV for 80 min. hSHAPE data for contiguous regions 1008\u20131163 nts and 2464\u20132629 nts were not collected due to the low quality data at 5\u2032 end and the absence of data at the 3\u2032end. the raw SHAPE reactivities were normalized using the box-plot normalization method [63] in these steps. m = 2.6 kcal/mol (slope) and b = 0.8 kcal/mol (intercept) were incorporated into the RNAstructure software. no limit was imposed on the maximum base pairing range (which is the default in RNAstructure) the pfs file was generated over the range of nts 167\u20134696. for the SHAPE-constrained structures the pfs file was generated over the range of nts 167\u20134696. the 1000 sampled structure were concatenated with the separate foldings of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. 2.6 kcal/mol (slope) and b = 0.8 kcal/mol (intercept) were added as a constraint in the input file for RNAstructure. no limit was imposed on the maximum base pairing range (which is the default in RNAstructure) s of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends (nts 1\u2013166, nts 4697\u20134778, resp.) were processed and interrogated for alternative or additional interactions not seen in the SHAPE-plus mfe structure. the maximum ladder distance (MLD) for the SHAPE-plus and SHAPE-minus structures and their mean values MLD> over the ensembles values were calculated. Figure S2 Mountain plots for SHAPE-plus TBSV genome optimal and suboptimal structures. the graph lines in black above and below the red graph line show, respectively, the maximum and minimum values for the number of enclosed basepairs along the sequence in the sampled 1000 suboptimal structures. the maximum and minimum enclosure values within the suboptimal population mirror that for the optimal structure. the structure for the default parameter (i.e. m = 2.6, B = 0.8) is shown in red. the maximum and minimum values for number of enclosed basepairs along the sequence in the sampled parameter variants are shown in blue. we were not able to compute stable structures for larger parameter variations. table S3 List of primers used for SHAPE analysis along with coordinates relative to the TBSV genome sequence. for each primer, the nucleotides for which reactivity data was generated are shown under \"Covered nt\""}
