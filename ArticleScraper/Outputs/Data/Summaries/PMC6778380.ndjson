{"summary": "microRNA-21 has potential inhibitory effect on the MAP2K3. it was upregulated in mouse hearts upon CVB3 infection. but the effect and underlying mechanism of miRNA-21 remain unclear. 3/P38 MAPK signaling in mice and protected them against CVB3 infection. miRNA-21 overexpression significantly inhibited viral progeny release and decreased myocytes apoptosis rate in vitro and in vivo."}
