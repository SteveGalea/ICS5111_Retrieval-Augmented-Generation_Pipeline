{"summary": "230 participants were monitored for 2,457 person-days. participants were aged 14 to 83 years (mean 34.1, SD 13.6), majority female (66.5%), mostly white (86.0%) and represented substantive education and income diversity. the WURSS-44 and the WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments. URI is extremely common, accounting for up to half of all acute illness episodes in a given year. the Jackson scale [17-19] is the most commonly used questionnaire used for defining and evaluating colds and flu. it includes eight symptoms which are rated absent, mild, moderate or severe by either self-assessment or with clinician/researcher assistance. items assessing activity, quality of life, and functional impairment were rated as equally or more important than items assessing symptom severity. items assessing activity, quality of life, and functional impairment were rated as equally or more important than items assessing symptom severity. compared to yesterday [Gy] Items selected for WURSS-21 are in bold italics Directions for items (2 \u2013 33) Response options range 0 to 7, with 0 = Do not have, 1 = Very mild, 3 = Mild, 5 = Moderate, 7 = Severely Factor analysis for original validation study identified 10 domains: C = Cough; Th = Throat; N = Nasal; A = Aches; Ti = Tired; Si = Sinus/headache; WURSS was designed to be an evaluative outcomes instrument aimed at measuring change over time in patient-valued illness domains. its greatest value will likely be as a patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument for use in clinical trials. current study was conceived as a second sample for WURSS validation. the SF-8 is a 24 hour recall version of the widely used SF-36. participants were recruited from the community in and around Madison, Wisconsin. participants were recruited using newspaper advertisements, flyers, posters, email messages, a promotional website. participants answered \"How sick do you feel today\" by marking a 0 to 7 Likert-type severity scale. colds were defined as ending when a participant marked \"0 = Not sick\" twice in a row on two subsequent days. if this did not occur by the 14th day, participation was terminated. MID is the average amount of instrument-assessed change for all subjects who rate themselves as \"a little better\" or \"somewhat better\" the current study was designed to re-assess the dimensional structure of the WURSS-44. construct reliability was estimated using methods originally proposed by Joreskog,[51] developed further by Bollen,[52] all factor analyses were conducted using Mplus version 5.1[53]. missing data, disallowed values, and outliers were also hand-checked, and corrected if appropriate. rollment of eligible callers included participant burden (74), failure to return phone calls (65), failure to show up for enrollment (21), transportation problems (14), and insufficient compensation (5). participants number (per cent) Ethnicity* Enrollment White 198 (86.0) Number of calls 2,169 Black 16 (7.0) Enrolled in other study 534 Hispanic 1 (0.4) Enrolled in other study 534 Hispanic 1 (0.4) 97 (42%) people reported a sore or scratchy throat as their first symptom. 105 (46%) reported nasal discharge, obstruction or sneezing. nonspecific symptoms were also highly prevalent, with 142 (62%) reporting headache, 87 (38%) chilliness. global-severity-today was included in the summary score. \"How sick do you feel today\" and \"Please rate the average severity of your cold symptoms over the last 24 hours\" the pattern of experienced symptoms was characterized by the expected high frequency reporting of nasal symptoms (99.6%), sore or scratchy throat (97.8%), and cough (93.5%). general physical health is impaired more quickly than mental health during common cold illness. all changes are more rapid in the first several days than later on. the center of the notched boxes is the median summed score for that day. data shown represent Days 2, 3 and 4, where sample size was N = 228, N = 226 and N = 224. day 3 Pearson correlations against the WURSS-21 were 0.925 (0.903, 0.942) for the WURSS-44, 0.849 (0.808, 0.882) for Jackson, -0.793 (-0.739, -0.837) for SF-8 physical, and -0.547 (-0.447, -0.632) for SF-8 mental. the instruments as a whole yielded similar MIDs and responsiveness indices to the first study,[24] with MID and responsiveness index of 18.5 and 0.75 for the WURSS-44, and 10.3 and 0.71 for the WURSS-21. the instruments as a whole yielded similar MIDs and responsiveness indices to the first study. 1.05 0.47 1.50 0.27 12 88.7 3.66 1.84 3.89 1.10 0.48 1.45 0.28 13 99.1 4.36 1.74 4.39 0.87 0.73 1.48 0.42 14 60.9 3.61 1.91 2.98 1.25 0.26 0.95 0.19 15 63.9 3.37 1.78 1.78 3.13 1.26 0.29 1.15 0.19 16 73.0 3.64 1.82 3.54 1.22 0.37 1.55 0.21 17 70.0 3.20 1.83 3.69 1.25 0.25 86 4.31 0.90 0.68 1.38 0.41 33 83.9 3.49 1.79 2.84 1.41 0.39 1.08 0.27 34 90.0 3.45 1.71 4.47 0.87 0.51 0.75 0.42 35 83.5 3.35 1.77 4.00 1.15 0.39 1.33 0.24 36 91.3 4.23 1.82 4.59 0.82 0.55 1.45 0.32 37 95.7 3.90 1.81 4.35 0.94 0.59 1.21 0.38 38 87.0 3.72 1.84 3.93 1.11 0.49 1.25 0. MID and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44, respectively MSE = Mean squared error for all people who rated themselves as \"the same\" for two days in a row Table 4. the first and last items on both the WURSS-21 and WURSS-44 differ from other items in terms of purpose and recall period, hence are not included in summary scores. the first and last items on both the WURSS-21 and WURSS-44 differ from other items in terms of purpose and recall period. symptom-assessing items tend to be rated as at least \"somewhat important\" by most of the people most of the time.
