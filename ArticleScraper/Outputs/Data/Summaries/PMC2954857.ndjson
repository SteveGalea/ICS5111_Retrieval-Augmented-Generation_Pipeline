{"summary": "japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most important cause of epidemic encephalitis in most Asian regions. the virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. in southeast Asia, the most important flaviviruses are JEV and dengue viruses (DENV) in northern Australia, Kunjin virus is found to co-circulate with JEV [5]. there is evidence that WNV infection in India from Japanese encephalitis nonendemic areas and endemic areas [7] positive sera showed that prM reactivity could be used to differentiate JEV-positive sera from WNV- and DENV-positive sera. prM and antibodies against prM would be useful for conducting seroepidemiological studies of flavivirus infections. but because prM is a membrane protein, it is difficult to express it in Escherichia coli or other expression systems. expression and purification of recombinant peptide fusion proteins. for each peptide a fusion expression recombinant plasmid was constructed and transformed into host cell E. coli BL21 (DE3) the purified proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. epitope M14 could only be recognized by anti-JEV sera but not by anti-DENV and anti-WNV sera. the synthesized epitope peptide was used as coating antigen in indirect ELISA. the epitope did not react with WNV-positive and DENV-positive sera. a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody revealed that MAb recognized JEV infected BHK21 cells (A) but not uninfected cells (B) a series of truncated peptides were designed and expressed after fusion with GST. the shortened peptide fusion protein was analyzed by ELISA using MAb 2F7. peptide M14-13 (KEAWLDSTKAT) is the minimal requirement for MAb 2F7 to recognize the linearized epitope. alignment analysis revealed that the sequence of the linear epitope is greatly conserved across the JEV strains. sequence alignment between the identified linear epitope and the homologous regions of WNV and DENV. abbreviations of each virus and GenBank accession numbers are listed in the parentheses. overlapping short peptides, M1-M20, covering the whole prM/M protein of JEV. a fusion expression recombinant plasmid was constructed and transformed into host cell E. coli BL21. epitope M14 could only be recognized by anti-JEV sera but not by anti-DENV and anti-WNV sera. the synthesized epitope peptide was used as coating antigen in indirect ELISA. the epitope did not react with WNV-positive and DENV-positive sera. the shortened peptide fusion protein was analyzed by ELISA using MAb 2F7. the results showed that when 4 or more amino acid residues were removed, the reactivity between MAb 2F7 and the peptide fusion protein decreased greatly. peptide M14-13 (KEAWLDSTKAT) is the minimal requirement for MAb 2F7 to recognize the linearized epitope. alignment analysis revealed that the sequence of the linear epitope is greatly conserved across the JEV strains. homology between epitope M14-13 and those from the 4 serotype DENV was less than 40%. full-length sequences of 23 different JEV strains were selected from the GenBank. GenBank accession numbers are listed in the parentheses. epitope M14-13 was highly conserved across these JEV strains. strain JKT6468--a genotype 4 JEV strain--has one amino acid residue (113N) different from that of the epitope M14-13 (113D) this amino acid residue replacement did not affect the reactivity of the epitope to MAb 2F7- and JEV-positive swine sera. cross-reactivity among flaviviruses has been a great diagnostic challenge. epitope identification was useful for elucidating antigenic characteristics of the prM protein. epitopes on E protein [15] and NS1 protein [16] of JEV have been mapped. thus far, the epitope on the PrM/M protein has not been mapped. the sera were obtained from pigs reared in pig farms. the sera were first tested by indirect ELISA and latex agglutination test. ninety-six-well microtiter plates were coated with purified fusion protein or denatured inclusion body in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4\u00b0C overnight and blocked with 5% skim milk for 3 h. the plates were washed 3 times with PBST (phosphate buffered saline, PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) the blot was probed with an appropriate secondary antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. each blot was washed 3 times with PBST (10 min each time) each blot was then washed 3 times with PBST. epitope-specific MAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson IR) were used as primary and secondary antibodies. the samples were analyzed by using a leica microscope. the annealed fragment was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-6p-1. the inserts in the recombinant plasmids were sequenced. the recombinant plasmids were induced with 0.1 M isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside. western blotting Virus-infected cell lysates or expressed fusion proteins were mixed with an equal volume of sample loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 100 mM dithiothretol); 2% SDS; 0.1% bromophenol blue; and 10% glycerol) the proteins were transferred from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose membrane. hybridoma clones were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. the resultant hybridoma clones were isotyped using an isotyping kit from Roche Diagnostics. china (200803015) and a National Basic Research Program (973) of China (2011CB504700)."}
