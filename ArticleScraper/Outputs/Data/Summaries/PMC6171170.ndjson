{"summary": "background Rodents represent around 43% of all mammalian species. they are widely distributed, and are the natural reservoirs of a diverse group of zoonotic viruses, including hantaviruses, Lassa viruses, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could help predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases. the reads of mammailan virus under each family. Table S4. Origin and accession number of viruses identified in this study. Table S6. The aa identities (%) between these hepaciviruses and other known members of the family Arteriviridae (including a tentative member, WPDV). the viruses found in this study are labeled in red font. Figure S3. Phylogenetic tree showing the relationships (amino acid) between arteriviruses in the pp1a proteins."}
