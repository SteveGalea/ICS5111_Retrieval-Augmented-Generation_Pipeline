{"summary": "vaccines are the most effective interventions against infectious diseases. many vaccines are effective only in preventing onset and aggravation of symptoms. many vaccines, however, are effective only in preventing onset and aggravation of symptoms. the development of safe, effective, and suitable adjuvants for various types of vaccines is expected to meet the new type vaccines. the development of safe, effective, and suitable adjuvants for various types of vaccines is expected to meet the new type vaccines. it protects the entrapped molecule from mechanical/chemical or enzymatic attacks outside the particle. it acts as a superior carrier for delivery, achieving slow release of the encapsulated materials [19\u201321]. influenza virus HA vaccine was purchased from DENKA SEIKEN Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) it was a split and trivalent vaccine for seasonal influenza, consisting of the inactivated HA antigens A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008. the amount of human TNF- was determined by an ELISA system established in-house in Hayashibara Co., Ltd. Briefly, an anti-human TNF--specific mouse antibody (MAb-TNF--1-HRPO) was immobilized in 96-well plates. horse radish peroxidase- labeled anti-human TNF--specific mouse antibody (MAb-TNF--1-HRPO) was added to the wells. blood was taken from the abdominal aorta with heparinized syringes. the jaw was incised bilaterally and the nasal cavity was exposed. blood and the nasal wash were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 8 min. the upper palates were removed and the NALTs were isolated under the microscope. plasma from mice immunized with IVV and TNF/CHP nanoparticles was subjected to hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay performed by FALCO biosystems Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan) results were expressed as geometric mean titer (GMT) cells were prepared from the mice, blocked with phycoerythrin- (PE-) labeled anti-mouse CD11c antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and subjected to FCM analysis. results were examined with a flow cytometry analysis software, Gatelogic (Inivai Technologies Pty Ltd., Mentone, Victoria, Australia) protein, and lactotransferrin were prepared (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) expression levels were normalized with the level of GAPDH. quantified by quantitative PCR with a Roche LyteCycler 480 (Roche) -12 NM_008352 agctcgcaaagcaaggt tggagacacaaaaacga 181/62 IL-17A NM_010552 gctccagaaggcccctcaga agctcctcgcattga 142/60 IL-18 NM_008360 ccaaatcacttcctcttgcccttgcc cells pooled from 8 mice were cultured for 3 d in microplates with feeder splenocytes treated with 50 g/mL mitomycin for 30 min. the cell proliferation was examined with alamarBlue (Life Technologies Co.) and represented the difference () of fluorescence intensity between cases with and without IVV stimulation. seven d after the final immunization, the mice were challenged with influenza virus (Puerto Rico/8/34, 160 pfu/50 L) nasally. the dosage of virus corresponded to 10 LD50 for the mice. TNF- protein was produced by a human lymphoblastoid cell line, BALL-1. the endotoxin level was determined to be less than 300 pg/mg protein. unencapsulated TNF- and 12 mg/mL CHP were mixed, sterilized by filtration, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 d. nanoparticles were treated with 100 mg/mL methyl-cyclodextrin (Me-CD, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. ELISA system recognized the active trimeric TNF- molecule only. the detection limit was 0.2 ng/mL. animals were anesthetized with sevoflurane and administered nasally. the nasal passage cells were obtained by chipping off from the wall of the nasal cavity, minced, and dispersed with collagenase D. the cells were separated by biphasic centrifugation with 40% and 75% Percoll (GE Healthcare) at 1,000 rpm for 25 min. the cells in the boundary phase were collected and washed with RPMI 1640 medium. the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC-) labeled anti-mouse CD11c antibody and FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD86 antibody. resulting Alexa-labeled OVA was used as an indicator antigen for nasal administration to mice with or without the TNF/CHP nanoparticles as an adjuvant. cDNA was synthesized using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. expression of various cytokines and factors related to immune responses was examined with the mouse innate and adaptive immune responses PCR array (SA Biosciences Co.) 95/60 IL-1 NM_010554 atgtatgcctactcgtcggg tgagttttgttctggc 139/60 IL-1 NM_008361 caaccaacaagtgatattctccatg gatccacactctccatgca 152/60 IL-2 NM_008366 cctgagcaggatggagaattaca tccag nectin 1 NM_010233 gggagaagtttgtgtgcatggt ctgggggtctccgtgataat 136/60 CD14 NM_009841 catttgcatcctcccttgttgtga gagtgagtttttccccgtgtgtg 182/55 proteoglycan 2 NM_008920 actt the cell proliferation was examined with alamarBlue (Life Technologies Co.) the culture supernatant was recovered at 16 h and the cytokine-producing cells were examined using the ELISpot PLUS mouse IL-4 and the ELISpot Plus mouse IFN- (Mabtech AB, Nacka Strand, Sweden) kits. preliminary safety study was performed in reference to the OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals [29]. Mice (4 heads each sex, each group) were administered nasally the TNF/CHP nanoparticle preparation combined with the IVV once a week either once or four times for acute or repeated toxicity. the peak and average sizes of the particles were 27.2 nm and 42.4 nm based on the DLS results. a TNF/CHP nanoparticle consisted of a TNF- active trimer (ca. 50 kDa) in a CHP tetrameric complex (ca. 400 kDa) aliquot was examined for the amount of active TNF- by ELISA. samples were treated with 100 mg/mL M--CD at 37\u00b0C for 2 h to release TNF- from the particles. the values are means of triplicate experiments. inin- (HA-) specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay because the IVV we used was consisting of different types of influenza virus. the effects were comparable to those of CTB. mice were nasally administered IVV and TNF/CHP nanoparticles or CTB as described. splenocytes were prepared from the mice and IVV-specific proliferation. the surviving animals immunized with the IVV and the TNF/CHP nanoparticles had immunological memory, including IgG1 in plasma and IgA in nasal/vaginal wash. these mice responded to a boosting challenge of the IVV. these data indicate that the nanoparticles induced systemic immunity and long-lived memory. the ratio of CD11c+/CD80+ cell population was 0.20%, 0.30%, and 0.33% for saline, IVV, and IVV with TNF/CHP nanoparticles. the effect of TNF/CHP nanoparticles was not so prominent. Flow cytometry of NALT cells after immunization was focused on the nasal route of vaccination. mice were immunized for 6 h with 10 g of Alexa-labeled OVA antigen for nasal administration with or without TNF/CHP nanoparticles as an adjuvant. the results were expressed as fluorescence values of Alexa 647+/CD11c+ cells. expression profiles with the TNF/CHP nanoparticles were similar to those with free TNF. expression profiles with the TNF/CHP nanoparticles were similar to those with free TNF. expression profiles with the TNF/CHP nanoparticles were similar to those with free TNF. mRNA was prepared from NALT cells 2, 6, and 26 h after administration of TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV. gene expression related to innate and adaptive immune responses was analyzed by quantitative PCR, normalized to GAPDH expression. data are shown as relative level versus control. 3.8.3. Urinalysis Urobilinogen, bilirubin, ketone body, glucose, protein, pH, specific gravity, nitrite salt, and leucocyte were examined during the study period. there were no TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV-related changes observed. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. 2 n.d. 140.0 93.0 n.d. n.d. 292.0 146.0 4 n.d. n.d. 1807.0 795.0 n.d. n.d. 2334.0 609.0 4 + 2 n.d. n.d. 7602.0 2265.0 n.d. n.d. 10695.0 4045.0 histopathology of tissues from animals in each group was examined. no abnormalities in the brain, especially olfactory bulb, were noted in any animals after histological examination. however, there were some influences observed in nasal mucosal tissue. no significant change due to the administration of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV was observed in the acute toxicity study. in the repeated toxicity study, slight-to-moderate infusion and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed at the nasal mucosa, the administration site. overall, no immunotoxicity was detected. a new tab Size distribution of TNF/CHP nanoparticles was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) the nanoparticle retained its integrity and kept TNF- molecules active inside the complex in aqueous solution at room temperature for at least 21 d. the integrity of the particles was also maintained more than 80% even after five cycles of freezing and thawing. severe and unfavorable effects have hampered its practical use. we thought delayed release of the TNF/CHP nanoparticle might promote the beneficial effects of TNF-, such as a vaccine adjuvant, while avoiding harmful events. ouse as TNF-) or CTB (0.8 g/mouse) nasally once a week 4 times. levels of IVV-specific IgA and IgG1 were determined by ELISA. splenocytes were examined using splenocytes. the results represent the difference between cases with and without IVV antigen stimulation. mice were nasally immunized with the IVV (0.3 g/mouse) combined with or without TNF/CHP nanoparticles (corresponding to 5 g TNF-/mouse) once a week for 3 times. the mice that received the IVV only died by 8 d after the challenge. immunological memory, including IgG1 in plasma and IgA in nasal/vaginal wash, was maintained for more than 91 d. this memory was maintained for more than 91 d, and these mice responded to a boosting challenge of the IVV. these data indicate that the nanoparticles induced systemic immunity and long-lived memory. ratio of CD11c+/CD80+ cell population was 0.20%, 0.44%, and 0.50% for saline, IVV, and IVV with TNF/CHP nanoparticles, respectively. Flow cytometry of NALT cells after immunization with TNF/CHP nanoparticles was not so prominent. the results were analyzed with Gatelogic software. the results were expressed as fluorescence values of Alexa 647+/CD11c+ cells. mice were immunized for 6 h with 10 g of Alexa-labeled OVA antigen. IL-1, IL-1 family 9, and IL-6, were found to be significantly upregulated. inflammatory markers were enhanced when adjuvants were included. expression profiles with the TNF/CHP nanoparticles were similar to those with free TNF, although the magnitudes were not as great. 0.05; P 0.01; P 0.001 versus control was preliminarily examined. Mice (4 in each sex) nasally administered the TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with the IVV either once or four times. the general symptoms, ophthalmic examinations, body weight, body temperature, hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, autopsy findings were inspected. -glutamyl transpeptidase (-GT), total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, total bilirubin, and glucose were examined during the study period. there were no TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV-related changes observed. the vaccine (IVV 0.3 g/mouse) and adjuvant preparation (TNF/CHP nanoparticles 5 g/mouse as TNF-) were nasally administered to mice once a week up to 4 weeks. after that, 2 weeks of cessation period was set (4 + 2 weeks) blood plasma was prepared and the anti-IVV IgG1 antibody was titrated (n = 4). no organ weight change was noted as test material-related. no excessive inflammatory symptoms, such as formation of edema or fibrosis, were noted. no significant change due to administration of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV was observed in acute toxicity study. in ophthalmic examinations, there were no test material-related ocular findings observed. body weights and body temperatures in both sexes during the treatment were not statistically different among the treatment groups. in ophthalmic examinations, there were no test material-related ocular findings. anti-IVV IgG1 in blood was examined after the administration of TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV. no detectable antibody was induced by the single administration. after the second administration, however, the antibody was induced by only the TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with the IVV. the titer was maintained even after 2 weeks of cessation period. pathology and major organ weights Gross pathology of all the animals was examined at the end of the study. there were few gross pathology finding and none of them were considered to be the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV-related. no organ weight change was noted as test material-related. mice administered TNF/CHP nanoparticles were isolated, stained with hematoxylin-eosin. no significant change due to administration of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV was observed in the acute toxicity study. the amount of Me--CD required to disrupt the particle structure was approximately 100 mg/mL, much higher than 0.3 mg/mL reported in the case of IL-12/CHP nanoparticles [21], suggesting that the affinity between TNF- and CHP was much stronger than that of IL-12 and CHP. the effects of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed stronger than those of CTB. the mice were immunized with influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and challenge with an antigenically distinct influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) the size difference between the nanoparticles and empty CHP particles does not explain the discrepancy. it is unlikely that TNF- was replaced in vivo by IVV antigens to form IVV/CHP nanoparticles. this would then preferentially deliver vaccine antigens to the lymph node given the short time frame. nanoparticles induced long-lived immune memory, a critical feature for successful vaccine adjuvants. the mucosal surfaces are known to have abundant B cells, T cells, and plasma (or DC) cells. uptake of antigen by the mucosal tissues is essential for the induction of immune responses. free, exogenous TNF elicited strong and early increases in the expression of inflammatory signaling molecules. the nanoparticles might effect a slow release of TNF-, prolonging the immune-stimulatory effect. rin (HP--CD) exhibited adjuvant activity and elicited a strong protective effect against influenza virus in mice and cynomolgus macaques. they suggested the involvement of Tfh cells via MyD88- and TBK-dependent pathways. however, they mentioned the cytotoxicity of HP--CD at more than 0.5% in vitro. combining TNF/CHP nanoparticles with next-generation vaccine platforms will offer valuable alternatives for vaccination in a variety of settings."}
