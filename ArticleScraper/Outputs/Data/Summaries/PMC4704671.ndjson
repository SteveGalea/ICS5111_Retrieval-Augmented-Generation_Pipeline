{"summary": "mAbs against HNVs were generated as described previously [9, 14]. mouse mAbs nAH1.3 and 213 were generated against NiV-M. mAbs hAH14.2, hAH1.3, and hAH5.1 and human mAb m102.4 were generated against HeV. the percentage of neutralization was calculated as [1 (number of plaques with antibody/number of plaques without antibody)] 100. all assays were performed in triplicate. a panel of 6 HNV G\u2013specific mAbs were used in this study. mAbs were incubated with 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of NiV-M, NiV-B, or HeV for 1 hour. cells were overlaid with 3 mL of 0.8% agarose in medium. the percentage of neutralization was calculated as [1 (number of plaques with antibody/number of plaques without antibody)] 100. the crystal structure coordinates of the HeV and NiV-M attachment proteins G were used to determine the locations of amino acid residues associated with neutralization escape. mAbs hAH14.2 and hAH1.3 were used for selection of neutralization-escape mutants of HeV, mAbs nAH1.3, hAH5.1 and 213 were used for selection of neutralization-escape mutants of NiV-M. mAb m102.4 was previously used to generate a neutralization-escape mutant of both HeV and NiV-M. hybridomas producing mAbs hAH5.1 and hAH14.2 used in generating escape mutants were lost owing to a technical failure during storage. mAbs m102.4 and nAH1.3 were able to neutralize HeV and both NiV-M and NiV-B efficiently. mAb hAH1.3 efficiently neutralized HeV but none of the 2 NiV strains. neutralization was not only affected by the virus strain, but also by its respective escape mutations at positions Q450K and Q388R. mAb nAH1.3 was generated against NiV G, which also potently neutralized HeV. 2.4 (A), nAH1.3 (B), and hAH1.3 (C) were determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay. error bars represent standard deviations. ephrin B2 is shown as sticks in orange (on G) and yellow (on ephrin B2) two of the mutations associated with escape from neutralization of NiV-M were previously shown to be important for forming and stabilizing the NiV-M G/ephrin complex. mAb m102.4 and mAb 213 target the receptor-binding domain. all of the escape mutants grew to similar peak titers by 48 hours after infection. however, the escape mutant containing the N159D/R516K mutations was significantly delayed in replication at 18 hours after infection, compared with the WT strain. hamsters infected with WT NiV-M succumbed to infection by 3\u20134 days after challenge. escape mutants with amino acid changes at positions Q388R, Q450K, or V507I were uniformly lethal but showed a significant delay in their time to death by 8\u201310 days. all animals had evidence of viremia on day 3 after infection. the mutation at R516K resulted in levels of replication below the levels of detection in lungs and brains of moribund hamsters. henipaviruses were infected with wild-type (WT) and neutralization-escape mutants of Hendra virus (HeV; A) and Nipah virus strain Malaysia (NiV-M; B) when moribund. both mAb hAH5.1 and 213 neutralization-escape mutants contained an amino acid change at position Q450K in NiV-M G. the hAH5.1 neutralization-escape mutant contained a mutation at position R516K, whereas the mAb 213 mutant contained a mutation at Q388R. m102.4 (A), nAH1.3 (B), 213 (C) and hAH1.3 (D) were determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay. two Nipah virus strains (Malaysia [NiV-M] and 1 Hendra virus (HeV) strains were used. hAH1.3 was affected by 3 mutations in HeV G, at positions S134F, H406Y, and D582N, similar to nAH1.3. neutralization of Nipah virus (NiV-M) escape mutants by monoclonal antibodies was determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay. error bars represent standard deviations. mAbs m102.4 and nAH1.3 and hAH1.3 all neutralize HeV by interfering with receptor binding. neutralization-escape mutations H406Y and D582N (A) and Q450K, V507I, and R516K (B) are shown in red. mutations Q450K and R516K associated with escape of NiV-M from neutralization by mAb nAH1.3 are located next to each other. this area is not known to interact with the receptors ephrin B2 or B3. the mechanism of action remains unknown. time points were determined by a 50% tissue infective culture dose (TCID50) assay, using vero E6 cells. error bars represent standard deviations. *P.05 by 2-way analysis of variance, compared with the wild-type strain. infectious HeV and NiV could be detected in brain, lung, spleen, and kidney. all animals had evidence of viremia on day 3 after infection. animals infected with the H406Y mutant had significantly lower levels of virus in the brain. mAb m102.4 effectively neutralizes HeV and NiV-M, as well as the NiV-B strain. however, a mutation at residue Q388, which was associated with escape from neutralization by mAb 213, is not one of them. position 159 is between 2 critical cysteines, C158 and C162, of the NiV G stalk region that mediate covalent subunit dimerization [21] Residue 159 is also a predicted glycosylation site (G2) that plays a crucial role in membrane fusion and F triggering. neutralization-escape mutants in the current study were generated under artificial conditions. this could potentially affect the escape variants that arise. a reduction in virus titers was observed in lung and brain tissues. the development of neutralization-escape mutants is a potential concern for the further development of neutralizing mAbs for treatment or prophylaxis. treatment of nonhuman primates with m102.4 up to 5 days after infection has completely protected against lethal infection with NiV-M or HeV."}
