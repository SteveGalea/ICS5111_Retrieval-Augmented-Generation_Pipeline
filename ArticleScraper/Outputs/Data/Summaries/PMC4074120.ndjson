{"summary": "cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX) inhibitors (e.g. aspirin), phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (e.g. cilostazol), irreversible ADP receptor antagonists (e.g. clopidogrel, prasugrel) and fibrinogen receptor blocking antibodies (e.g. abciximab, eptifibatide) are currently approved for the management of pathological thrombo new targets could yield better drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effects. there is evidence to suggest inhibition of adhesion receptors such as the collagen receptor, GPVI, or the von Willebrand receptor, GPIb-IX-V. GPVI activation is an early event in collagen-induced thrombus formation. recent characterisation of GPVI-Fc fusion proteins have highlighted GPVI as a therapeutic target. GPVI-Fc fusion proteins inhibit collagen responses in animal models. the receptor was processed by addition of protons and flipping of Gln, His and Asn using MolProbity [22]. a requirement for H-bonding of Lys 41 with the compounds was set. the docking was performed using Fred 2.2.5 and a database of 727 compounds with conformers pre-generated using Omega 2.2.3 [24] cells were centrifuged at 1000g for 10 minutes at room temperature. resultant pellet was resuspended in pre-warmed Tyrodes buffer. platelets were stimulated with agonist in a final volume of 500 l at 37\u00b0C. western blotting Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer (working concentration 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.01% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol) Membranes were washed 3 times in 1 TBST for 10 minutes. Whole blood (5 l) was incubated with 2 l anti-CD62P-phycoerythrocynin (PE) conjugates antibody (BD Bioscience, UK) and 2 l fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-fibrinogen (DAKO, Ely, U.K.), drugs and agonist, in a final volume of 50 l Tyrodes-HEPES buffer. to this, a CRP-XL was added all other reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, U.K.) the NIH Clinical Collection (1 and 2) was purchased from Evotec (CA, U.S.) Inc. the volume was adjusted to 25 ml with Tyrodes buffer, followed by addition of 3 ml ACD and 1.25 g PGI2. the resultant cell pellet was resuspended in pre-warmed Tyrodes buffer to a final cell density of 4108 cells/ml (aggregations) or 2109 cells/ml (peptide pull downs) blotting samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer (working concentration 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk powder/Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20. whole blood (5 l) was incubated with 2 l anti-CD62P-phycoerythrocynin (PE) conjugates antibody (BD Bioscience, UK) and 2 l fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-fibrinogen (DAKO, Ely, U.K.), drugs and agonist. samples were then fixed in 2 ml 0.2% formyl saline (sterile filtered) Whole blood (5 l) was incubated with 2 l anti-CD62P-phycoerythrocynin (PE) conjugates antibody (BD Bioscience, UK) and 2 l fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-fibrinogen (DAKO, Ely, U.K.), drugs and agonist, in a final volume of 50 l Tyrodes-HEPES buffer. samples were then fixed in 2 ml 0.2% for silico identifies GPVI antagonists using a single point screen (Ca2+ release) with a high dose of drug (100 M) and a high dose of cross-linked collagen related peptide (CRP-XL, 10 g/ml) the top 20 compounds were screened for effects on Ca2+ release by the GPVI-specific. commercially available compounds that inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca2+ release >50% were further screened by light transmission aggregometry. examples are shown of weak antagonism (g and h) and false positives (i and j) Cinanserin (l) and losartan (k) were taken on for further study. losartan and cinanserin inhibit Ca2+ release and aggregation in washed human platelets. both drugs inhibited release in a concentration-dependent manner. both drugs exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to both CRP-XL and collagen. washed platelets were incubated with drug for one minute prior to the addition of 1 g/ml CRP-XL or 1 g/ml collagen (representative traces and summary shown in g\u2013i) IC50 values for losartan and cinanserin on both CRP-XL- and collagen-induced Ca2+ release and aggregation (n = 3\u20135) tyrosine phosphorylation was visualized with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. both drugs reduce phosphorylation, but have no effect on thrombin or 2-MeSADP induced global tyrosine phosphorylation. losartan and cinanserin reduced global tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the GPVI-specific agonist CRP-XL and the endogenous ligand collagen (3f) no effect on either thrombin- or 2-MeSADP-induced global tyrosine phosphorylation (90 s) was observed. cinanserin and losartan both reduce FITC-fibrinogen binding (black bars) and P-selectin exposure (grey bars) compared to SQ-29548 alone. losartan is selective for GPVI over TPR. losartan significantly reduced FITC-fibrinogen binding, and P-selectin exposure. there is an additional inhibitory effect on GPVI-mediated platelet activation. losartan and cinanserin demonstrate selectivity for inhibition of GPVI-mediated platelet activation. losartan and cinanserin were not due to drug-mediated decreases in receptor levels. GPVI antagonism by losartan is unique amongst the sartan family. silico docking yields high hit rate and streamlines screening. a library of 727 FDA-approved drugs and their diastereomers were docked into the GPVI ligand binding site. of the top 20 compounds, 14 inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca2+ release from fura2-AM-loaded platelets by 50%. the 20 highest ranking compounds were screened for effects on Ca2+ release by the GPVI-specific agonist CRP-XL (10 g/ml) maximum Ca2+ release is shown in white, compounds that inhibited Ca2+ release by 50% or more are in grey, and the remainder in black. the high success rate of our computational screen validates the use of an in silico docking strategy for identifying potential receptor antagonists. losartan and cinanserin inhibited Ca2+ release in a concentration-dependent manner in response to both CRP-XL and the endogenous ligand collagen. were loaded with fura2-AM and screened for drug-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ release by 1 g/ml CRP-XL (n = 3, SEM, representative traces and summary, a\u2013c) and 1 g/ml collagen (n = 3, SEM, representative traces and summary, d\u2013f); losartan and cinanserin were incubated with drug for one minute prior to the addition of 1 g/ml CRP-XL (represent Ca2+ release and aggregation were carried out with 5 M of the P2Y12 receptor agonist 2-MeSADP (a, Ca2+ release and b, aggregation), or 0.5 U/ml of the PAR1 and PAR4 receptor agonist thrombin (c, Ca2+ release and b, aggregation) Losartan and cinanserin demonstrate selectivity for GPVI. losartan and cinanserin reduced global tyrosine phosphorylation. neither effect on thrombin- or 2-MeSADP-induced global tyrosine phosphorylation (90 s) was observed. losartan is relatively selective for GPVI. cinanserin and losartan both reduce FITC-fibrinogen binding (black bars) and P-selectin exposure (grey bars) compared to SQ-29548 alone. losartan inhibits some component of TP receptor signalling. the inhibitory effects of losartan on GPVI-mediated platelet activation are not due solely to effects on TPR. losartan significantly reduced FITC-fibrinogen binding, and P-selectin exposure, beyond that of SQ-29548 alone. cinanserin also significantly reduced FITC-fibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure. GPVI antagonism by losartan is unique amongst the sartan family. losartan is one of a class of receptor blockers that also includes valsartan and olmesartan, amongst others. GPVI antagonism is unique to losartan amongst the sartan drug class. inhibition of collagen-induced Ca2+ release (10 g/ml) the sartans from fura2-AM-loaded washed human platelets was measured and quantified (n = 3, SEM) a drug repurposing strategy was adopted to identify new GPVI receptor antagonists. losartan is a generic FDA-approved compound for the treatment of hypertention. cinanserin is a 5-HT receptor antagonist which has recently attracted attention as an inhibitor of SARS coronoavirus replication. the TP receptor antagonist terutroban showed promise as an antiplatelet in phase II clinical trials, but was found to offer no advantage over aspirin [5], [45]\u2013[47] with regards to bleeding risk. losartan may hold more promise in terms of immediate clinical application as an antiplatelet agent. olmesartan medoxomil does not antagonise GPVI-mediated Ca2+ release. it is likely that the anti-platelet effects of losartan can be attributed to inhibition of both GPVI and TP signalling. losartan is already known to convey a 25% relative risk reduction for stroke. aspirin is associated with a slight increase in the risk of haemorrhagic stroke."}
