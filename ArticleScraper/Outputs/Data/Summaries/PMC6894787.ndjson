{"summary": "dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas. no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers. the clinical severity ranges from mild and self-limited to life-threatening illness that could be fatal unless promptly recognized and appropriately treated. advances in modern air transportation allow the spread of dengue fever to non-endemic countries via infected passengers. imported dengue fever can cause regional outbreaks in previously non-endemic regions. inbound passengers must self-report any illness to quarantine officers. quarantine officers calibrate these infrared thermometer cameras every day. tympanic temperature 38\u00b0C is measured when passengers walk by. the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic affected passengers during 2009\u20132010. we included all inbound passengers at TPE who were tested for dengue infection in 2011 and excluded those having indeterminate test results. we also abstracted the number of passengers who tested positive and negative for dengue infection in 2011. value 0.10 is required to allow a variable into the model. p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. data analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) 5 (7%) were positive by NS1 but negative by PCR. only one patient was diagnosed by a fourfold increase in IgG. median age of patients was 32.5 years (range, 1\u201372 years), and 44 (59%) of the patients were male. 58.3) 40\u201359 18 (24.3) 702 (19.4) 60 7 (9.5) 174 (4.8) Purpose of travel Group travel 2 (2.7) 1,444 (39.9) 0.01 Independent travel 11 (14.9) 530 (14.7) Visiting friends or relatives 21 (28.4) 531 (14.7) Business 12 (16.2) 284 (7.8) Other 28 (37.8) 827 (22.9) Departure country Thailand 10 (13.5) 907 (25.1) 0.10 Indonesia 14 (18. the most commonly reported symptoms among dengue patients were fever/chills (35 patients, 47%) followed by headache (10 patients, 14%), myalgia/bone pain (7 patients, 9%), skin rashes (5 patients, 7%), and fatigue (3 patients, 4%). results of univariate analysis revealed statistically significant association of dengue virus infection with passenger age, purpose of travel, length of stay in dengue-endemic countries. passengers who had self-reported fever (aOR, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5\u20134.1) were significantly more likely to have dengue, whereas those with respiratory tract symptoms were not (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 1.7\u20134.9) the proportion of the variance explained by the multivariable logistic regression model was 0.2086. this is the first study examining data from active surveillance for dengue among all inbound passengers at an international airport. dengue has been reported as the most common cause of febrile illness among people seeking medical care after travel to Latin America or Asia. the overall efficiency of screening could be increased with the addition of a questionnaire on travel history and symptoms. a prospective study of adult short-term travelers from the Netherlands showed that seroconversion for antibodies to dengue virus occurred in 1.2% of travelers at risk. a previous study revealed that several major cities in the united states, Europe, Japan, and australia had a high risk of importing dengue-infected travelers because of their large volumes of international travelers. an additional international concern is Zika virus, an emerging mosquito-borne disease with serious perinatal and neurologic complications. a previous study found that long-term travelers are clearly at higher risk of exposure to dengue virus than short-term travelers. group travelers tend to stay shorter and therefore have a lower risk of dengue infection than other travelers. but further stepwise regression analysis didn\u2019t select for travel purpose in the model. targeting for screening the febrile passengers who did not participate in travel groups could increase the possibility of detecting dengue virus infection. the most common clinical manifestation was fever, followed by myalgia, headache, and malaise. the most common clinical manifestation was fever, followed by myalgia, headache, and malaise. despite careful review, misclassification might have occurred because of incomplete or inaccurate self-reports. despite careful review, misclassification might have occurred because of incomplete or inaccurate self-reports."}
