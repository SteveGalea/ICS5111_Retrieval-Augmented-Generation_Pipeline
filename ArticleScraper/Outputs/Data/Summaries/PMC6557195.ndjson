{"summary": "seasonal variations may exist in transitioning to dialysis, kidney transplantation and related outcomes among end-stage renal disease patients. elucidating these variations may have major clinical and healthcare policy implications for better resource allocation across seasons. the incidence of chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease and stroke are also highest in winter [7\u201311], and there may be a link between infection and cardiovascular disease through endothelial dysfunction and activation of the inflammatory and coagulation system [12\u201317]. the incidence of transition to ESRD and mortality would be consistently highest in winter and lowest in summer, irrespective of treatment modalities (i.e. hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation). we also examined transplant failure fractions among those who received kidney transplantation. for modality-specific outcome, we focused on hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, uncertain dialysis, functioning transplantation, loss to follow-up and recovered kidney function. for modality-specific outcome, we focused on hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, uncertain dialysis, discontinued dialysis and functioning transplantation. variations in the transition to ESRD, all-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular and infectious) death and kidney transplantation among adult US Medicare ESRD patients from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2013. a patient must have received at least 60 days of a particular dialysis modality to be considered stable on this therapy. the term \u2018ESRD transition fraction\u2019 expresses the fraction of all incident patients who have newly transitioned to ESRD in that given month divided by all ESRD patients, including those with functioning kidney allograft on the first day of the month. all-cause and cause-specific mortality fractions and kidney transplantation fractions were defined same way. on January 1st of each year Event frequencies in each year Total ESRD Total Dialysis Age (year) 65 yrs (%) Female (%) Blacks (%) Diabetes (%) Transition Death KTx 2000 373,091 278,897 56.0 16.6 34% 45% 32% 34% 103,958 (28%) 71,122 (19%) 14,625 (4%) 2001 394,136 294,395 56.3 16.5 35% 45% 45% 32% 35% 107, 44% 31% 37% 125,571 (23%) 87,108 (16%) 17,671 (3%) 2010 576,003 417,651 58.4 15.8 37% 43% 31% 37% 126,118 (22%) 87,675 (15%) 17,728 (3%) 2011 598,722 434,052 58.6 15.8 37% 43% 31% 37% 123,798 (21%) 88,536 (15%) 17,584 (3 Ratios of the largest versus smallest outcome frequencies were 1.16, 1.17 and 1.18 for hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and functioning kidney transplant, respectively. all-cause mortality was lowest in July to September and highest in December to February of each year, except for 2011 when the lowest mortality was observed in October. the 14-year averaged frequency of all-cause death in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and functioning kidney transplant was also lowest in July or dialysis and functioning kidney transplantation were also observed with the lowest frequency in August or September. the 14-year averaged fraction was lowest in July (0.15%) and highest in January (0.19%), with a ratio of 1.25. in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the 14-year averaged frequency of death due to infection was also lowest in July (n = 606 and 54, respectively) kidney transplant failure fraction of each year and (B) their 14-year averages among patients with ESRD from 2000 to 2013 in the USA. values were normalized based on days of month. transition to ESRD After normalization based on days in a given month, the overall transition fraction was lowest in July to September and highest in January to March of each year. the 14-year averaged all-cause mortality was lowest in august (1.32%) and highest in January (1.56%), in which the ratio was 1.18. the 14-year averaged frequency of all-cause death in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and functioning kidney transplant was also lowest in July or August (n = 4887, 340 and 312, respectively) in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the 14-year averaged frequency of death due to infection was also lowest in July. infectious death in functioning kidney transplantation also showed highest frequency in January (n = 28) but lowest frequency in May (n = 21; Supplementary data, Figure S4D). DISCUSSION Consistent seasonal variations were observed in ESRD incidence, all-cause death, cardiovascular death, infectious death, kidney transplantation and transplantation failure. overall fractions and modality-specific frequencies of ESRD incidence and all-cause, cardiovascular and infectious death were highest in the winter season (i.e. December or January) whereas the month with the lowest frequency of infectious death in kidney transplantation was May. the 2014 USRDS Annual Data Report showed that patients with CKD have much higher incidence of hospitalization with acute kidney injury than those without CKD. acute kidney injury, hypertension and congestive heart failure are the top three causes of hospitalizations among incident ESRD patients transitioning to ESRD. our results are exceptionally robust pertaining to the ESRD transition, mortality and transplant counts and fractions. our results may not be extrapolated to other countries in different climates, such as tropical zones.
