{"summary": "nearly 36.7 million people are living with HIV and 2.1 million new infections occurred during 2015 alone. a prophylactic vaccine, effective in various regions of the world, is desperately needed to eradicate this pandemic. despite these challenges, progress has been made toward the development of an HIV vaccine. monomeric gp120 and trimeric HIV gp140 have been used as immunogens in preclinical and clinical trials. monomeric gp120 and trimeric HIV gp140 have been used as immunogens in preclinical and clinical trials. se. Advax alone or combined with the toll-like receptor 9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotide (ADAVAX-1), has been shown to enhance antibody and T-cell responses to a wide variety of viral vaccines. a DNA prime/protein boost regimen encoding trimeric Env elicited high titre antibody responses that were significantly boosted following immunization with trimeric Env protein from both isolates. trimeric SIV envelope proteins were stably expressed following transfection of the Env expression vector DNAs into 293 cells and purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity, anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. both proteins were shown to migrate predominantly as an oligomer with an approximate molecular weight of 720 kDa in blue native PAGE. antibody binding titres in rabbits against SIVmac251 gp145 and SIVmac251 gp140. on weeks 0, 4, and 14 animals were electroporated with DNA. antigenicity of the trimeric envelopes was characterized by measuring binding affinity to human and rhesus soluble CD4 by bio-layer interferometry. gp140 and SIVsmE660 gp145 followed by two IM boosts of a mixture of the trimeric homologous proteins formulated in Adjuplex adjuvant. antibody titres against the two homologous envelope proteins measured throughout the course of immunization are shown in Fig. 1(d) animal ID Bleed week Neutralization titres are expressed as the dilution of serum inhibiting infection of TZM-bl cells by 50 % (ID50) compared to the untreated control cells. a combination of both intranasal (IN) and IM routes were selected for protein immunization with inulin adjuvants. this mode of vaccination elicited robust immune responses in mice when tested with HIV-1 Env [27]. the results are presented as individual values for all four animals. the black arrows indicate the time of immunization. on weeks 0 and 4, animals were electroporated with DNA. the term'relative affinity' is used because the polyclonality of serum antibodies does not permit a true affinity to be determined between one antibody and one immunogen. high-affinity/-avidity antibodies were elicited following the protein boost via the IN route (KD of 0.94 nM) and a similar high-affinity antibody persisted until the day of challenge. antibody titres against V1 and V2 linear peptides of SIVmac251 gp140 were assayed by ELISA. dilution of sera inhibiting SIV infection of TZM-bl cells by 50 % (ID50) and 80 % (ID80) compared to the virus-only control. animal ID Bleed week Neutralization titres are expressed as the dilution of serum inhibiting infection of TZM-bl cells

animals inhibited in vitro infection of the challenge virus. this inhibitory activity was short-lived and could not be detected in subsequent weeks, even in macaque M908, which resisted challenge. the number of B-cells secreting total IgG was in the range of 927 to 2873 spots/106 PBMC at both measured time points. the frequency of B-cells secreting IgG specific to each envelope was initially low after DNA immunization, but markedly higher on week 83 in two out of three immunized animals. ed to weekly low-dose vaginal challenge with SIVmac251 isolate. five unvaccinated macaques served as controls in the study. one out of the three immunized animals remained protected. even after four vaginal challenges. the lower limit of detection for the viral RNA assay (50 copies) is shown as a dotted line. the viral loads of only two infected immunized animals are shown. the control nave (group II) animals are represented as closed circles. both Env proteins migrated as trimers with a molecular weight of 720 kDa. crosslinked SIVmac251 gp140 and SIVsmE660 gp145 envelope trimers. binding affinities of both envelopes to human and rhesus sCD4 were found to be in the nanomolar range (3.9 to 19.7 nM), suggesting that Envs are properly folded with the CD4 binding site intact. antibody titres against the two homologous envelope proteins measured throughout the course of immunization are shown in Fig. 1(d). a low to moderate level of neutralization was noted after the second protein boost against both Tier 1A/Tier 1B and Tier 2 isolates. a low to moderate level of neutralization

systemic humoral immune responses were evaluated in this study because of the small immunized animal group size. d an endpoint titre of almost 3.5 log units increased to approximately 4.5 log units after the envelope protein boost via the intranasal route. at the time of vaginal challenge, the antibody titres were in the range of 4.5 logs following a third immunization of the envelope(week 83) via the IM route. a low level of envelope-specific IgG was detected after the DNA immunizations. the levels of specific IgGincreased significantly after the IM protein boost to 3005.33 and 2005.00 g ml1 for the anti-SIVsmE660 anti-gp145 and anti-SIVmac251 gp140 antibodies. a similar high-affinity antibody persisted until the day of challenge. both SIVmac251 gp140 and SIVmac251 gp140 were observed following the IN boost (week 14) strong antibody reactivity to the V1 and V2 domains was observed at 14 weeks post-IN immunization. antibody titres for the V1 and V2 regions were comparable at all the measured time points. the neutralization titres were expressed as the dilution of serum inhibiting infection of TZM-bl cells by 50 % (ID50) compared to the untreated control cells. the results are

of infection noted in TZM-bl cells in the presence of 1 : 10 dilution of immune serum compared to that noted with similar dilution of pre-immune serum. we evaluated the presence of memory B-cells in the three immunized macaques, which were challenged on week 83. macaque M907 was euthanized on week 45 due to clinical conditions of the urethra. five unvaccinated macaques served as controls in the study. one out of the three immunized animals remained protected. following each virus exposure, had a plasma viral RNA load below the detection limit of the assay (50 copies; data not shown) these results demonstrate that DNA priming followed by protein boosting with SIV envelopes in Advax adjuvant elicited protective immune responses against vaginal transmission of SIV. e primed with HIV-1 DNA followed by subsequent nasal and parenteral HIV-1 gp120 protein boost with the respective Advax adjuvants. animals were primed with DNA encoding SIV envelopes and boosted intranasally and intramuscularly with purified oligomeric immunogens. uncleaved proteins formed oligomeric species that included higher order oligomers, trimers and dimers. the trimers were purified to homogeneity by lectin-affinity, size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography. the envelope design has proven to be quite effective in eliciting functional and protective B-cell and antibody responses. combination vaccine regimen showed partial efficacy against vaginal transmission of SIVmac251. one out of three experimental animals showed no sign of infection after four challenges. other immune correlates, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, may have contributed to protection. a combination of mucosal and systemic immunization routes elicited robust mucosal antibody and T\u2013cell responses in mice and macaques. a combined-route immunization strategy consisting of HIV-1 envelope formulated in the adjuvant, MF59, was effective at eliciting robust antibody responses both systemically and at the site of virus transmission. studies have suggested that envelopes with a closed conformation that is resistant to CD4-induced changes may be better antigens. studies have suggested that envelopes with a closed conformation that is resistant to CD4-induced changes may be better antigens. the gp120\u2013gp41 cleavage sites were abolished by the substitution of an arginine for a serine residue at R527S and potential secondary sites R516S in SIVmac251 and R533S in SIVsmE660. two stop codons were introduced before the gp41 TM after the consensus YIQ (\u2018YIK\u2019 HIV nomenclature) ine is a proprietary glycolipid adjuvant based on alpha galactosyl ceramide. the adjuvant was simply mixed with the envelope protein immediately prior to immunization. the animals were boosted with a mixture of SIVmac251 gp140 and SIVsmE660 gp145 proteins (200 g each protein) intranasally on week 12 with ADVAX-M (25 g/animal) adjuvant. subsequently macaques were immunized intramuscularly with the same envelope proteins on weeks 18, 38 and 82 with ADVAX-1 (5 mg/animal) ilution of immune serum producing ELISA values (A450 nm) greater than or equal to two times the signal detected with a corresponding dilution of pre-immune serum. reactivity of the immune sera to the peptides representing the V1 and V2 domains was also assessed by ELISA. inhibition of the infectivity of the challenge virus was performed in a similar manner with fixed (1 : 10) dilution of the immune sera. total and envelope-specific IgG B cells were quantitated by ELISpot using the human IgG ELISpot basic kit. two stop codons were introduced before the gp41 TM after the consensus YIQ (\u2018YIK\u2019 HIV nomenclature) the DNA used for immunization was prepared using an EndoFree plasmid giga kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, the DNA was shown to contain >90 % supercoil structure with low endotoxin levels (20 EU) env genes for SIVmac251 gp140 and SIVsmE660 gp145 lacking native signal peptide were cloned in frame with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide in a mammalian expression vector, pSWTK. the gp120\u2013gp41 cleavage sites were abolished by the substitution of an arginine for a serine residue at R527S. envelope proteins were crosslinked with EGS crosslinker (Pierce) to demonstrate the trimeric nature of the preparations. Adjuvants ADVAX-1 (Vaxine) was provided as a 50 mg ml1 aseptic suspension of delta inulin. adjuvant was simply mixed with the envelope protein immediately prior to immunization. simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) were immunized in this study. animals were vaccinated intramuscularly with 500 g of each plasmid DNA encoding the envelope of SIVmac251 and SIVE660. mice were boosted with a mixture of gp140/gp145 proteins. rabbits were immunized with 250 g of each plasmid DNA encoding the envelope gp145 of SIVmac251 and SIVE660 intramuscularly followed by electroporation using a BTX AgilePulse device (BTX Harvard Apparatus) on weeks 0, 4 and 14. macaques were immunized intramuscularly with the same envelope proteins on weeks 18, 38 and 82 with ADVAX-1 (5 mg/animal) macaque M907 was euthanized on week 45 due to clinical conditions that were affecting the animal\u2019s ability to urinate. antibody affinity measurements The binding kinetics of the immunoglobulins or CD4 to SIVmac251 gp140 and SIVsmE660 gp145 was measured by BLI using an OctetRED-96 platform (ForteBio) the data were analysed using a global fit 1 : 1 model. the mean B-cell count was recorded from triplicate wells. t-cell ELISpot assays for IFN- release from PBMC stimulated with SIVmac251 envelope peptide pools were performed as previously described."}
