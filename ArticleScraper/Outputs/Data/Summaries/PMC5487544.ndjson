{"summary": "in equines, VEEV causes >80% mortality (1); in humans, VEEV is rarely fatal (1%), causing neurological disease that can lead to permanent neurological sequelae in 4 to 14% of symptomatic individuals (2, 3). there are no FDA-licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies available to combat VEEV infection. transchromosomic (Tc) bovines have been engineered to possess a human artificial chromosome containing the human antibody heavy chain and kappa chain. the majority of the antibody produced is fully human IgG (70 to 80%), while a smaller portion is chimeric IgG and bovine IgG. antigen-specific human antibodies to diverse viral pathogens. we compared optimized VEEV immunogens (inactivated virus, expression plasmid DNA, and a commercial inactivated alphavirus trivalent veterinary vaccine) for stimulation of neutralizing and protective PAb responses in Tc bovines. western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV); ii) plasmid DNA (pDNA694) containing codon-optimized structural genes with a 4-amino-acid (aa) deletion in the capsid; iii) the V3000 nt3A virus inactivated by treatment with the psoralen derivative 4\u2032-aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT) coupled with short-duration UV i Neutralization activity was present after the first immunization with pDNA694. but further immunizations with V3000 nt3A AMT resulted in higher levels of VEEV-specific neutralization activity than in serum from Tc bovines hyperimmunized with pDNA694. purified VEEV TcPAb preimmunization negative-control preparations retained high VEEV-specific neutralization capacities. the first negative control consistently exhibited lower background levels of both IgA and IgG. the second negative control produced ELISA reactivity similar to that of the pDNA694-generated VEEV TcPAb preparation. one mouse treated with the CLV TcPAb had weight loss beginning at 6 dpi. virus was detected at 5 dpi in the heads of all mice imaged. level of IVIS signals in mice treated with anti-VEEV TcPAbs therapeutically was significantly lower (P 0.001) than that in the negative-control TcPAb group. three mice from the control, prophylactic, or therapeutic groups were imaged by IVIS analysis at 5 days postchallenge. one mouse representing the fewest clinical infection signs is shown in IVIS images from the control (A), prophylactic (B to D), and therapeutic (E to G) groups. standard-dose aerosol exposure causes uniform mortality in 6 to 9 days. only mice treated prophylactically i.p./i.n. with pDNA694- or V3000 nt3A AMT-derived TcPAb had significantly less IVIS signal in the head than those treated with negative-control TcPAb. six-week-old BALB/c mice were treated once i.p. or i.p./i.n. with 100 g of either the control TcPAb or the indicated anti-VEEV TcPAb. four mice from the control or prophylactic groups were imaged by IVIS analysis at 5 days postchallenge. one mouse representing the fewest clinical infection signs is shown in IVIS images from the control or prophylactic groups. therapeutic 90 8.5 0.0 i.p./i.n. 90 8.0 0.0 V3000 nt3A AMT i.p.

(B to D) or i.p./i.n. (E to G), with the first dose 12 h before challenge and the second dose 48 h after challenge. six-week-old mice were treated with 100 g of either the control TcPAb or the indicated anti-VEEV TcPAb followed by a high-dose aerosol challenge. two doses of TcPAb were administered either i.p.

(E to G), with the first dose 12 h after challenge and the second dose 48 h after challenge. mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease. pDNA694 TcPAb and V3000 nt3A AMT TcPAb treatments produced significantly higher rates of survival. mice that received pDNA694 TcPAbs showed clinical signs for fewer days. IVIS confirmed that for all challenge types, mice exhibiting little/no weight loss also had little/no replication in the head compared to mice with weight loss. surviving mice, all of which were treated with anti-VEEV TcPAb, exhibited substantial virus replication in the head and weight loss. the development of a multiagent-specific antiviral therapeutic is of high priority. influenza virus-sensitive DBA2 mice were treated either prophylactically or therapeutically with an equal mixture of VEEV TcPAbs and influenza virus TcPAbs. negative-control-treated mice were also exposed to each virus individually. the survival time for each virus singly was significantly longer than that for combined infection (P 0.01) in negative-control groups, the survival time for each virus singly was significantly longer than that for combined infection (P 0.01). Tc bovines hyperimmunized with VEEV antigens produce VEEV-specific antibodies. the commercial livestock vaccine (CLV), a trivalent vaccine containing formalin-inactivated VEEV, eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) plasmid DNA (pDNA694) containing codon-optimized structural genes with a 4-amino-acid (aa) deletion in the capsid. neutralization activity was present after the first immunization with pDNA694. but further immunizations with V3000 nt3A AMT resulted in higher levels of VEEV-specific neutralization activity than in serum from Tc bovines hyperimmunized with pDNA694. purification from three purified TcPAb preparations retained high VEEV-specific neutralization capacities. the first negative control consistently exhibited lower background levels of both IgA and IgG. the second negative control produced ELISA reactivity similar to that of the pDNA694-generated VEEV TcPAb preparation. the level of IVIS signals in mice treated with anti-VEEV TcPAbs therapeutically was significantly lower (P 0.001) than that in the negative-control TcPAb group (Fig. 2I). the level of IVIS signals in mice treated with anti-VEEV TcPAbs therapeutically was significantly lower (P 0.001) than in the negative-control TcPAb group (Fig. 2I). three mice from the control, prophylactic, or therapeutic groups were imaged by IVIS analysis at 5 days postchallenge. one mouse representing the fewest clinical infection signs is shown in IVIS images from the control (A), prophylactic (B to D), and therapeutic (E to G) treatments. additional ab treatment route demonstrated to increase efficacy of protection against aerosol alphavirus exposure. only mice treated prophylactically i.p./i.n. with pDNA694- or V3000 nt3A AMT-derived TcPAb had significantly less IVIS signal in the head than did mice treated with the negative-control TcPAb. pDNA694- or V3000 nt3A AMT-derived TcPAbs (Table 2) between prophylactic treatment and therapeutic treatment. six-week-old BALB/c mice were treated once i.p. or i.p./i.n. with 100 g of either the control TcPAb or the indicated anti-VEEV TcPAb. therapeutic 80 7.8 0.3 i.p./i.n. 70 8.3 0.8 a Prophylactic treatment 12 h before challenge; therapeutic treatment at 12 h postchallenge. b NA, not applicable. c *, P 0.05 by a chi-square test comparing CLV with pDNA694 and V3000 nt3A AMT. all IVIS images are set to the same scale. daily weights are shown for mice that received negative-control TcPAb (black lines) (B to G) or therapeutic (colored lines) (B to G) treatments. none of the treatments were significantly different from the control by Student's t test (P > 0.05) protection against high-dose aerosol challengec TcPAb 1 dosea 2 dosesb Route Timing % survival AST (days) SD Negative control Prophylactic 0 6.0 0.0 Prophylactic 0 6.3 0.6 Therapeutic 0 6.5 0.5 Therapeutic 0 6.4 0.8 CLV i.p.

VEEV Trinidad donkey strain (TrD) cDNA clone (V3000) was constructed by creating a G-to-A mutation at nucleotide 3 as previously described. cDNA stocks were generated from cDNA clones by in vitro RNA synthesis (IVT) from linearized cDNA plasmid templates as previously described (35). Briefly, IVT (mMessage mMachine; Ambion) was used to generate infectious, capped viral RNA genomes that were electroporated into BHK-21 or C7/10 cells. the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 18 to 24 h postelectropor a human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector labeled isKcHACD (9\u201311) contains two human chromosome fragments. a human chromosome 2 fragment contains the entire human immunoglobulin light chain locus. VEEV V3000 nt3A was generated by electroporation of the C7/10 mosquito cell line. Virus was inactivated by using 10 g/ml of the psoralen derivative AMT (Sigma) with 10 min of UV inactivation (13 J/cm2). Virus was considered inactivated if no plaques were detected by a plaque assay, no cytopathic effect was observed after inactivated material was cocultured with BHK two Tc bovines (bovines 2178 and 2183) were vaccinated 5 times (V1 to V5) at 3-week intervals. the Tc bovines were vaccinated 4 times (V1 to V4) at 3-week intervals. the frozen Tc plasma bags were thawed at room temperature overnight. the pH of the samples was then adjusted to 4.80 with the dropwise addition of 20% acetic acid. the supernatant containing IgG was then neutralized to pH 7.50, filtered through a 0.22-m filter. chromatography indicated that there were no IgG aggregates or IgG dimers. dilution of human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (KPL) was added for 1 h at room temperature. dilution of human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (KPL) was added for 1 h at room temperature. mice were incubated with IgG-HRP for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. the reaction was stopped with 1% SDS. all mice were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions. mice were weighed daily and monitored for clinical signs of disease. at 5 days postchallenge, mice were injected with 10 g the Nano-Glo substrate (Promega) either s.c. or intravenously (i.v.) and imaged by using the IVIS Spectrum CT instrument (PerkinElmer) for either 2 min (i.v.) or 4 min (s.c.) post-substrate injection on autoexposure setting. BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% donor bovine serum (DBS) and 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) and Huh7 cells, generously provided by Charles Rice (Rockefeller University, New York, NY), were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) all media for cell lines were also supplemented IVT was used to generate infectious, capped viral RNA genomes. supernatant clarified by centrifugation at 18 to 24 h postelectroporation. single-use aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C. recombinants or contaminants were present (38). transchromosomic bovines are homozygous for triple knockouts of the endogenous bovine immunoglobulin genes (IGHM/ IGHML1/ IGL/) and carry a human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector labeled isKcHACD (9\u201311). this vector consists of two human chromosome fragments. two Tc bovines (bovines 2180 and 2221) were immunized with a licensed animal vaccine containing inactivated VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV (encephalomyelitis vaccine; Intervet) at two times the recommended equine doses (2 ml) for vaccination 1 (V1) and V2 and at four times the recommended dose (4 ml) for V3. two Tc bovines (bovines 2178 and 2183) were vaccinated 5 times (V1 to V5) at 3-week intervals. the Tc bovines in both groups were vaccinated 5 times (V1 to V5) at 3-week intervals. the pH of the samples was then adjusted to 4.80 with the dropwise addition of 20% acetic acid, fractionated by caprylic acid at a caprylic acid/total protein ratio of 1.0 for 30 min at RT. the supernatant containing IgG was then neutralized to pH 7.50, filtered through a 0.22-m filter, and affinity purified by using a KappaSelect anti-human IgG light chain-specific column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences incompetent replicons were diluted in virus diluent. bovine serum was diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% BSA. dilution of human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (KPL) added for 1 h at room temperature. all mice were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions. all experiments were conducted at ABSL-3 in accordance with AAALAC-approved institutional guidelines for animal care and use. mice were injected with 10 g the Nano-Glo substrate (Promega) either s.c. or intravenously (i.v.) and imaged by using the IVIS Spectrum CT instrument (PerkinElmer) for either 2 min (i.v.) or 4 min (s.c.) post-substrate injection on autoexposure setting. images of representative animals from each group were chosen based on the animals exhibiting the greatest or least weight loss."}
