{"summary": "VACV is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a complex cytoplasmic life cycle. it is the prototypical member of the orthopoxviridae genus of the Poxviridae family. it includes Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), Monkeypox virus and Ectromelia virus. siRNA SMARTpools (4 siRNAs per gene, Dharmacon) were diluted to 0.3 M and dispensed in 10 l volumes using a Rapidplate384 liquid handler (Qiagen) into eight black 384-well plates. plates were thawed and 10 l transfection reagent (Dharmafect 1, Dharmacon) diluted in Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution (HBSS, ThermoFi plates were incubated for 48 h in humidified incubator with 5% CO2. media was removed from plates by inversion and 15 l media was added. plates were inverted to remove media and a final volume of 50 l of media added. two negative controls (mock transfection and RSCF siRNA) and two non-specific siRNAs (targeting VP16 or VP11/12 from Herpes simplex virus type 1). Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. the phalloidin was removed by inversion and 50 l of DAPI (1 g/ml) diluted in PBS was added and left on. cells were analysed by automated microscopy using an OPERA high content screening system (Perkin Elmer) expression levels were normalised to the housekeeping cellular gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) expression levels were normalised to the housekeeping cellular gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) qPCR was carried out in duplicate for each sample, and normalised expression levels averaged. six wells of a 96 well plate were transfected with a siRNA SMARTpool. at 24, 36 and 48 h post infection cells were scraped into overlying media. lysate was titrated on BS-C-1 cell monolayers and virus titre quantified as plaque forming units (PFU per ml) siRNA SMARTpools (4 siRNAs per gene, Dharmacon) were diluted to 0.3 M and dispensed in 10 l volumes using a Rapidplate384 liquid handler (Qiagen) into eight black 384-well plates. plates were thawed and 10 l transfection reagent (Dharmafect 1, Dharmacon) diluted in Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution (HBSS, ThermoFi 3103 cells in a volume of 40 l were added to each well using the Multidrop 384. plates were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator. to infect, media was removed from plates by inversion. plates were inverted to remove media and a final volume of 50 l of media. wells were transfected with siRNA targeting PRK-AB1 and eGFP. two negative controls (mock transfection and RSCF siRNA) and two non-specific siRNAs. error bars indicate standard error of mean. luor-647 phalloidin (Invitrogen Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS + 1% BSA was added and incubated for 45 min in the dark. cells were analysed by automated microscopy using an OPERA high content screening system (Perkin Elmer) and Acapella High Content Imaging and Analysis software. expression levels were normalised to the housekeeping cellular gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) and calibrated to mock-transfected cells. qPCR was carried out in duplicate for each sample, and normalised expression levels averaged. a phenotype was considered confirmed if two or more of the four siRNAs resulted in a p-value of 0.05 or less. at 24, 36 and 48 h post infection cells were scraped into the overlying media, collected and then frozen and thawed three times. the resultant lysate was titrated on BS-C-1 cell monolayers. qg quantifies how unexpectedly often g is among the most strongly regulated genes (up or down) a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targets genes that are considered potential candidates for therapeutics. fluorescence was correlated to virus-titre over a range of time-points post-infection after treatment with control or inhibitory siRNAs. the entire druggable screen was repeated four times in duplicate to generate a robust primary data set of eight replicates. a total of 403 siRNA pools were associated with a significant reduction in cell number. a hitlist of 302 HFs (4.5% of the total) was generated, consisting of 153 pro-viral HFs which inhibited replication upon depletion and 149 anti-viral HFs which increased replication upon depletion. 62 genes out of 80 tested (78%) had their transcript level reduced by 50% or more. only 30% of the anti-viral hits (7/24) were successfully validated in comparison to 69% of the pro-viral hits (24/35) and 54% of the siRNA pools with no effect in the primary screen (7/13). the dynamic range of the virus replication assay is such that inhibitory effects are more easily demonstrated. siRNA SMARTpools targeting five genes identified in the primary RNAi screen as modulating VACV growth (one anti-viral factor MAP3K14 and four pro-viral factors TRIP, PPAP2A, VPS52 and CCT7) were transfected into HeLa cells and infected at low MOI (0.05) with VACV-A5eGFP. Mercer et al [32] measured the growth of a thymidine-kinase-deficient VACV (strain Western Reserve) after only 8 h of infection, thereby identifying cellular proteins involved in the initial stages of virus replication but excluding analysis of viral spread. they reported 188 pro-viral HF but no anti-viral HFs. a comparison of the VACV HFs identified in this screen with those identified in other viral screens found a small overlap with WNV, VSV, Borna Disease virus and Dengue virus. the nucleocytoplasmic transport factor NUP98 was identified as a proviral hit in the VACV screen reported here as well as HIV, HSV-1 and influenza A virus screens. the number of nuclear pore proteins now identified as pro-viral HFs strongly suggests poxviruses require functional nuclear membrane transport for efficient replication. MAP2K3 activates the p38 MAPK signalling pathway and is involved in low pH-dependent entry of influenza virus and VSV. no significant tendency of pro-viral HFs to be up-regulated or anti-viral HFs to be downregulated was detected. four pro-viral HFs (RUNX1, eIF3C, HBEGF, and ADM) were significantly upregulated in VACV-infected HeLa cells (q0.05), suggesting that VACV might promote expression of these proteins. the x-axis represents the level of fluorescence in the RNAi screen (viral replication) expressed as a z-score with pro-viral genes to the left and anti-viral genes to the right. the y-axis represents the relative expression of the seven genes in VACV infected cells. the cellular translation machinery has been highlighted in other viral RNAi screens as essential for VSV [29] and hepatitis C virus [45] and HSV-1 [33]. gene sets identified using pathway- and (b) GO-based gene sets as defined in the MSigDB database. viral proteins involved in shut-off of host cell transcription have not been identified. despite the efforts of the virus to shut off host transcription, some anti-viral effect persists in VACV infected cells. two members of the septin protein family (septin 1 and MSF/septin 9) were identified in the RNAi screen as anti-viral HFs. MSF/septin 9 co-purifies from cells with three other septin proteins (NEDD5/septin 2, CDC10/septin 7 and septin 11). two groups of genes involved in DNA replication and repair were highlighted in the pathway analysis as having anti-viral properties. the PCNA-MutS-MutL-DNA complex (PCNA, MSH2, PMS2, and MLH1) and the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (RFC4, BRCA1, BLM, RFC1, MSH2 and MLH1) both promoted virus replication when individual group members were downregulated. the identification of the PCNA and BRCA1 gene sets as RNAi screen of 440 cellular kinases and phosphatases in a non-permissive Drosophila cell model of VACV infection. a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targets genes that are considered potential candidates for therapeutics. eGFP fluorescence was quantified as a measure of infection. fluorescence was correlated to virus-titre over a range of time-points post-infection after treatment with control or inhibitory siRNAs. the entire druggable screen was repeated four times in duplicate to generate a robust primary data set of eight replicates. the entire druggable screen was repeated four times in duplicate to generate a robust primary data set of eight replicates. a hitlist of 302 HFs (4.5% of the total) was generated, consisting of 153 pro-viral HFs which inhibited replication upon depletion. 149 anti-viral HFs which increased replication upon depletion. 62 genes out of 80 tested (78%) had their transcript level reduced by 50% or more. only 30% of the anti-viral hits (7/24) were successfully validated in comparison to 69% of the pro-viral hits (24/35) and 54% of the siRNA pools with no effect in the primary screen (7/13). a potential reason for the lower validation rate of the anti-viral hits might be that the dynamic range of the virus replication assay is such that inhibitory effects are more easily demonstrated. s targeting five genes identified in the primary RNAi screen as modulating VACV growth (one anti-viral factor MAP3K14 and four pro-viral factors TRIP, PPAP2A, VPS52 and CCT7) were transfected into HeLa cells and, after 48 h, infected at low MOI (0.05) with VACV-A5eGFP. et al [32] measured the growth of a thymidine-kinase-deficient VACV (strain Western Reserve) after only 8 h of infection. they reported 188 pro-viral HFs but no anti-viral HFs. the overlap between the hit lists reported by the three VACV RNAi studies is depicted in Figure 3a and b. a comparison of the VACV HFs identified in this screen with those identified in other viral screens found a small overlap with WNV, VSV, Borna Disease virus and Dengue virus. the nucleocytoplasmic transport factor NUP98 was identified as a proviral hit in the VACV screen reported here as well as HIV, HSV-1 and influenza A virus screens. the number of nuclear pore proteins now identified as pro-viral HFs strongly suggests poxviruses require functional nuclear membrane transport for efficient replication. another HF that affects both VACV and influenza A virus replication is MAP2K3 (also known as MKK3 and MEK3), which activates the p38 MAPK signalling pathway. four pro-viral HFs (RUNX1, eIF3C, HBEGF, and ADM) were significantly upregulated in VACV-infected HeLa cells (q0.05), suggesting that VACV might promote expression of these proteins to assist viral replication and spread. a genome-wide association study found a genetic polymorphism in RUNX1 to be associated with the serological response to VACV vaccination in African-Americans. the x-axis represents the level of fluorescence in the RNAi screen. the y-axis represents the relative expression of the seven genes in VACV infected cells. this lack of correlation between functional HFs and gene expression at the transcriptional level serves to underscore the complexity of virus-host interactions. gene sets identified using pathway- and GO-based gene sets. each row shows ranks of genes from a particular gene set present in the RNAi screen. transcriptional initiation and general RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity were identified. viral proteins involved in this shut-off of host cell transcription have not been identified. despite the efforts of the virus to shut off host transcription, some anti-viral effect persists in VACV infected cells. two members of the septin protein family (septin 1 and MSF/septin 9) were identified in the RNAi screen as anti-viral HFs. MSF/septin 9 co-purifies from cells with three other septin proteins (NEDD5/septin 2, CDC10/septin 7 and septin 11), suggesting they form a functional complex. the PCNA-MutS-MutL-DNA complex (PCNA, MSH2, PMS2, and MLH1) and the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (RFC4, BRCA1, BLM, RFC1, MSH2 and MLH1) both promoted virus replication when individual group members were downregulated. these pathways act as a host defence mechanism in poxvirus infection, detecting and responding to foreign poxviral DNA and inducing intrinsic apoptosis [ RNAi screen of 440 cellular kinases and phosphatases identified in a non-permissive cell model of VACV infection [36] identified seven hits including three AMPK subunits. Previously identified host pathways and protein complexes which aid VACV replication, such as translation and the AMPK complex proteins, were highlighted in the RNAi screen."}
