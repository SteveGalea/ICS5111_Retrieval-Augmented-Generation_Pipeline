{"summary": "aPMV-1 is a single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the genus Avulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae. it infects a wide range of domestic and wild bird species worldwide. inactivated vaccines were first made commercially available to the poultry industry in 1946, but because they provided incomplete protection against ND. genome size is approximately 15 kb and encodes six genes. the genes produce nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and polymerase protein (L) there are nine serotypes of aPMV-1; viruses associated with ND are in serogroup 1. recombination was not thought to contribute to aPMV-1 evolution [30], [31], evidence of recombination in NDV has recently been reported. this debate may be due, in part, to the reliance on a single gene for determining virus diversity and phylogeny. a total of 54 isolates representing seven different genotypes were used in the phylogenetic reconstruction. a total of 54 isolates representing seven different genotypes were used in the phylogenetic reconstruction. genomes I, II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII, are coded with red, yellow, lime-green, dark-green, purple, cyan, and blue colors, respectively. taxa changed genotype affiliations in different gene trees and all discordant taxa were affiliated with vaccine-related genotype II in some gene trees. for example, isolate AY562985 (Cockatoo/14698/Indonesia/1990) was affiliated with genotype II in the predicted recombination breakpoint at position 7119 of the concatenated EU140955 matched correctly with the end of a SpeI restriction site of this chimeric strain. two additional recombination breakpoints within this insert were also detected by the GENECONV and Bootscan methods. Isolate AY562985 is predominantly genotype VII and had evidence of two recombination events based on RDP3 predictions. regions 508 to 926 (in NP) and 927 to 1511 (NP and P) are related to genotypes V and II. in the region 927 to 1511, AY562985 had seven unique synonymous substitution sites compared to other genotype II sequences. regions that correspond to different genotypes are shown using the color scheme described in Figure 1. superscripts a and b indicate statistical support (p-value105) from 5 or 3\u20134 methods. superscripts c and d indicate statistical support (p-value103) from 2 to 4 methods, respectively. phylogenies of individual and concatenated genes were reconstructed after removal of five putative recombinant isolates and chimeric vaccine strain EU140955. all taxa were consistently affiliated with a single genotype and there were no long branches associated with any genotype. analysis was based on all full length genome sequences in the data set which had a date of isolation and excluded the six recombinant sequences. the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA of class II aPMV-1 was estimated to be between 114 and 137 years before 2005. effective population size estimates are expressed on a logarithmic scale. solid lines denote the median estimates and the dotted lines give the 95% HPD intervals of the estimates. the shaded light blue region indicates a population bottleneck. genotype VII was the most dynamical for the four genotypes of aPMV-1 (phase iv; Figure 5B) genotype II showed a continuous decline in population size in phase iv. genotype II shows no sign of reduction in effective population size since its origin. the global rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for all protein coding genes was less than 1, indicating purifying selection has been the major driving force in the evolution of class II aPMV-1 viruses. there were no codons identified to be under positive selection in M and L genes in either group. NP 489 0.119 (None) 0.100 (467) P 395 0.266 (None) 0.336 (87, 90, 380) M 364 0.176 (None) 0.123 (None) F 553 0.166 (115) 0.139 (28) HN 616 0.166 (266, 495, 522) 0.171 (508) L 2204 0.088 (None) 0.094 (None) Strains used for selection analyses in both groups are mentioned in the NP, HN, L, and concatenated gene trees consistently placed genotypes I and II in a sister clade to other genotypes. in the P gene tree, genotype II formed a basal clade while genotype I clustered with the remaining genotypes and in the M and F gene trees, genotype I was the basal clade. Isolate AY562989 (Dove/2736/Italy/2000) was affiliated with genotype II in the M gene tree but with genotype VI in all remaining trees except the P gene, in which it was an outlier to all other genotypes. a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH-test) provided statistical support of taxon incongruence (p0.005) among the gene trees. the RDP3 program reasonably identified the 5\u2032 breakpoint at the 8th nucleotide of the F-gene. two additional recombination breakpoints within this insert were also detected by the GENECONV and Bootscan methods. a total of five putative recombinant isolates were detected (Figure 2). 225 was derived from genotype II and had three unique non-synonymous substitution sites compared to other genotype II sequences. there were seven unique sites, four of which were non-synonymous substitution sites. for isolate EU167540, a putative recombination region between position 3753 and 4345 was affiliated with genotype II. trees are rooted with strain DQ097393, which belongs to class I aPMV-1. the fifth virus identified by all RDP3 methods was a genotype VII isolate that contained a small region within the HN gene contributed by genotype III. inter-genotype recombination was also detected by fewer than five of the RDP3 methods. two of the three original patterns of phylogenetic affiliation were retained following removal of recombinant sequences. the placement of genotypes based on HN and L was the same with or without recombinants; genotype I and II were sister groups to genotype III, IV, V, VI, and VII. all six genes and the concatenated genome maintained constant effective population size until the late 1990's. in 1997-8 there was an abrupt decline in the population with recovery from this event in the early 2000. Symbols i-iv represent four phases of aPMV-1 history. genome I, II, VI, and VII are coded by red, yellow, dark blue, and light blue lines. genome I, II, VI, and VII, are coded by red, yellow, dark blue, and light blue lines. genomes I and VII showed a marginal increase in effective population size followed by a decline. genotype VII appears to have stabilized, while genotype II shows no sign of reduction in effective population size since its origin. in the vaccine-related group, only the surface protein encoding genes, F and HN, had positively selected codons. there were 3 positively selected sites identified in the HN gene in the vaccine-related group and one in the non vaccine-related group. selection is focused on HN in vaccine-related groups and on P in nonvaccine-related genotypes. the role of recombination in the evolution of aPMV-1 has been debated. recombination is more common in positive-sense RNA viruses. recombinants derived from vaccine strains may have been the result of laboratory artifacts. the presence of unique nucleotide substitutions in the recombinant regions suggests that these regions did not arise due to contamination with vaccine strains deposited in the sequence databases. genotype II aPMV-1 was not impacted by factors causing population decline in the late 1990s. a plausible explanation for the absence of a population bottleneck could be that genotype II NDV is maintained as an asymptomatic infection. ation effectively prevents birds from developing disease when exposed to a virulent strain, but does not prevent shedding. distinctive profiles of positively selected codons were shown in both vaccine- and nonvaccine-related groups. a concatenated genome sequence from these six coding gene sequences was generated using Mesquite version 1.12 (http://mesquiteproject.org) a concatenated genome sequence from these six coding gene sequences was generated using FigTree version 1.12 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). genome sequences for which year of isolation was available were used to infer evolutionary rate and dates using BEAST version 1.4.8. 149 complete F gene sequences, which had dates of collection, were retrieved from GenBank. a total of 97 isolates from genotype I, II, VI and VII were selected to infer evolutionary rates and population dynamics. the Coalescent Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) was constructed using the growth rate and demographic parameters from the selected best-fit models. the BSP was constructed using the growth rate and demographic parameters from the selected best-fit models. a concatenated genome sequence from these six coding gene sequences was generated using Mesquite version 1.12 (http://mesquiteproject.org) Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were reconstructed for all data sets using the heuristic search option. the inferred trees were visualized with FigTree version 1.12 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). length genome sequences for which year of isolation was available were used to infer evolutionary rate and dates using BEAST version 1.4.8. 149 complete F gene sequences, which had dates of collection, were retrieved from GenBank. from the ML tree, a total of 97 isolates from genotype I, II, VI, and VII were selected to infer evolutionary rates and population dynamics. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) analyses were run for 5\u201310108 generations depending on each dataset. selection analysis Selection analyses were done based on datasets without putative recombinant sequences because recombination can result in falsely identifying positive selection. positively selected codons were detected using fixed-effect Likelihood (FEL) via the datamonkey website. table S4 The evolutionary rates and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of each gene and concatenated genome based on HKY substitution model."}
