{"summary": "IAV is an enveloped and negative-sense RNA virus. it encodes at least 12 viral proteins, including two envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and three polymerase subunits of virus-specific RNA polymerase. viral HA protein first binds to sialic acid-containing receptors located on the host cell surface and triggers internalization of the viral particle through endocytosis. vRNP, M1, and viral envelope proteins assemble viral particles. then released from the cell surface to produce viral progeny. cellular transcription corepressor ZBTB25 is involved in IAV replication. SUMO proteins belong to the ubiquitin-like protein family and are covalently linked to a lysine residue within the consensus sequence (KXE) of the target protein via a multienzymatic cascade of E1 activating enzyme, E2 conjugating enzyme, and E3 ligase. SUMO-specific proteases catalyze deconjugation of SUMO from substrate proteins using their isopeptidase activity. antiviral response involving the expression of type I and II IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) the secreted IFN activates the JAK/STAT/ISGF3 pathways. subsequently induces the production of ISGs, including RIG-1, MDA5, IRF7, STAT1 and many others. two shZBTB25 clones (shZBTB25-a and -b) produced very low ZBTB25 levels. similar data were obtained using small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligomers (siZBTB25-a and -b) to knock down ZBTB25 expression. these results suggest that ZBTB25 plays a positive role during IAV replication. A549 cells with stable knockdown of ZBTB25 were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 1 for 8 h. Western blot analysis of A549 cells in which expression of endogenous ZBTB25 was knocked down using a lentivirus-based shRNA approach. expression levels of viral RNA (A and D), viral mRNA (B and E) and viral cRNA (C and F) of NP and ZBTB25 mRNA were measured by qRT-PCR at 8 hpi. expression relative to that of the shLuc control is shown. ZBTB25 regulates IAV replication through modulation of viral RdRp activity. we then examined replication and transcription of viral RNA by a qRT-PCR method. the amounts of all NP vRNA, mRNA, and cRNA were significantly lower in the shZBTB25 clones at 8 hpi than in the controls. similar data were obtained by using siRNA oligomers to knock down the expression of ZBTB25. sequences for knockdown of ZBTB family members shRNA or siRNA Sequence shLuc 5\u2032-GCGGTTGCCAAGAGGTTCCAT-3\u2032 shZBTB25-a 5\u2032-GCTTCCATTCTGGAAAGTAAT-3\u2032 shZBTB25-b 5\u2032-CCAACCTGACATATTCAGCTA-3\u2032 shZBTB2-a 5\u2032-CCCAGTTAGCTTCCATCAA-3\u2032 shZBTB2-b 5\u2032-CCCAGTTA cells with shRNA-generated knockdown of ZBTB members were cotransfected with pPolI-Luc and a Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid. their luciferase activities were measured at 24 h posttransfection. the data are presented as the means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001 by Student's t test) flag-ZBTB25 was transfected into HEK293T cells prior to IAV infection. the lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-PA, anti-PB1, anti-PB2, or anti-HA antibodies. these results suggest that ZBTB25 interacts with several components of the viral RdRp complex either directly or through RNA. the HA-tagged ZBTB25 protein was synthesized by an in vitro-coupled transcription and translation (TNT) system and incubated with biotin-labeled viral RNAs that contain the various regulatory elements of vRNA for RNA replication. these sequences are highly conserved among the eight vRNA segments, whereas those of the adjoining untranslated region (UTR) are variable. the viral RdRp usually stutters at the stretch of five to seven uridine residues. a poly(A) tail is subsequently added to the tail of mRNA. the 5\u2032 UTRs of NP, PB1 and PB2 vRNAs were selected for binding studies. HA-ZBTB25 fusion proteins were individually incubated with the chemically synthesized 5\u2032 UTRs of NP, PB1 and PB2 containing U-rich or all-G sequences. RNA analysis using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. RNAs from MDBio, Inc. were biotin labeled at the 5\u2032 end. ZBTB25 is SUMOylated at residue lysine 204 and deconjugated by the SUMO deconjugation enzyme SENP2. 25 revealed a slow-migrating band of about 80 kDa. this band is equivalent to 1 molecule of SUMO-1 conjugated to ZBTB25. this result suggests that ZBTB25 can be modified by SUMO-1 but is not ubiquitinylated. HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged ZBTB25 WT or the K204R mutant in the presence or absence of EGFP\u2013SUMO-1\u2013GG. both the zinc finger domain and SUMOylation modification are required for ZBTB25-regulated IAV replication. the significance of this finding is not clear (data not shown) the two mutants produced slightly higher virus titers than the titer of the Flag control. however, the ZBTB25 K204R and ZFmut mutants failed to induce RdRp activities. both the zinc finger domain and SUMOylation play important roles in ZBTB25-induced IAV replication. p complex and NP in each reaction product were detected by Western blotting. the pol I-driven luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase expression. the data are presented as the means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; and ***, P 0.001, by Student's t test). the results showed that DSF had only minor cytotoxicity at concentrations of up to 20 M DSF after 24 h of treatment but significant cytotoxicity at a concentration of 30 M. we first confirmed that ZBTB25 is indeed a zinc-binding protein, and DSF ejected zinc ions from ZBTB25. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pPolI-Luc and Renilla luciferase. hek293T cells were treated with different doses of DSF. the viral titer was detected by plaque assay. TB25 influences IAV replication through regulation of cellular transcription. we first examined whether ZBTB25 regulates the reporter activity of pGL3-NFAT luciferase driven by a construct containing three binding sites for NFAT (3XNFAT) overexpression of ZBTB25 resulted in decreased luciferase activity. all of them were stimulated by downregulation of ZBTB25. overexpression of ZBTB25 significantly inhibited expression of these genes. these data suggest that ZBTB25 directly stimulates viral RdRp activity to promote IAV replication. the data are presented as the means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01, by Student's t test). a secondary RNAi screening was performed to confirm these genes. candidates were initially selected according to the following two criteria. data were obtained using small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligomers (siZBTB25-a and -b) to knock down ZBTB25 expression. we then performed a rescue experiment using a wobble ZBTB25 mutant that expressed wild-type (WT) ZBTB25 but could not be targeted by shZBTB25-a. virus titer in ZBTB25 knockdown A549 cells generated by siRNA oligomers at 12 and 24 hpi after IAV infection using plaque assays. luciferase activity was measured at 24 h posttransfection. the data are presented as the means SD (n = 3; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; and ***, P 0.001, by Student's t test). the protein levels of RdRp complex and NP were also shown below the graphs. Knockdown of endogenous ZBTB25 by shRNA resulted in the reduction of RdRp activity by approximately 70%. overexpression of the ZBTB25 wobble mutant restored the viral RdRp activity in these cells. the virus titers in A549 cells with shRNA-generated knockdown of ZBTB members were cotransfected with pPolI-Luc and a Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid. the virus titers in A549 cells with shRNA-generated knockdown of ZBTB members were measured at 24 h posttransfection. we performed an in vitro coimmunoprecipitation assay between ZBTB25 and individual viral proteins. the data showed that ZBTB25 was pulled down by NA, NS1, PB1, PA, PB2, and NP but not by HA, M2, or NS2. lysates were left untreated (A) or treated with 100 U of RNase A (B) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the viral proteins and coprecipitated ZBTB25 were detected using anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies. biotin-labeled viral RNA was incubated with HA-ZBTB25. the results showed that ZBTB25 proteins bound to a fragment consisting of Uni13 plus the 5\u2032 UTR (Uni13+5\u2032 UTR) and the 5\u2032 UTR alone, but not Uni12, Uni13, the 3\u2032 UTR, or the open reading frame (ORF) encoding NP (NP-ORF) ZBTB25 is a viral RNA binding protein and recognizes the U-rich sequence within 5\u2032 UTR vRNA. in vitro RNA-protein pulldown assay of ZBTB25-vRNA binding activity. in constructs d and e of panel B, asterisks mark positions of vRNAs with U-to-G mutations.

ZBTB25 is SUMOylated at residue lysine 204 and deconjugated by the SUMO deconjugation enzyme SENP2. K204R mutant did not yield the SUMO-1-conjugated band (lane 3 versus lane 1). the protein could be detected by either anti-GFP or anti-SUMO-1 antibodies. the amount of SUMO-1-conjugated ZBTB25 was reduced by treatment with any of the three SUMO-deconjugating enzymes (SENPs) HEK293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged ZBTB25 WT. both the zinc finger domain and SUMOylation are required for ZBTB25-regulated IAV replication. both mutants produced significantly lower virus titers than the titer of the Flag control. both the zinc finger domain and SUMOylation play important roles in ZBTB25-induced IAV replication. mutation of the BTB/POZ domain also reduced binding of ZBTB25 to NP. both the zinc finger domain and SUMOylation play important roles in ZBTB25-induced IAV replication. the recombinant GST-ZBTB25-WT, -K204R, or -ZF mutant fusion protein was purified, followed by incubation with the 5\u2032 UTR of vRNA. the recombinant GST-ZBTB25-WT, -K204R, or -ZF mutant fusion protein was then subjected to GST pulldown analysis. DSF treatment significantly lowered virus titers in the presence or absence of overexpression of ZBTB25 in a dose-dependent manner. this result suggests that ZBTB25 and other zinc-containing molecules participate in IAV RNA replication. these results indicate that zinc-binding activity is a critical component of viral RdRp. luciferase activity was measured and normalized by Renilla luciferase expression. the data are presented as the means SD. NFAT has been reported to coordinate with NF-B to regulate IFN- gene transcription (41). overexpression of ZBTB25 resulted in decreased reporter activity of a luciferase construct containing five copies of NF-B binding sites (5XNF-B-luciferase) overexpression of ZBTB25 suppressed IAV-induced IFN- expression while its mutants induced proportionally less IFN- (Fig. 9D) 5XNF-B-Luc and Renilla luciferase were transfected into HEK293T cells. luciferase activity was measured and normalized by Renilla luciferase expression. a novel cellular protein, ZBTB25, plays a crucial role in IAV replication. a zinc finger mutant and a SUMOylation-deficient mutant showed lower vRNA binding ability and less RdRp complex recruitment. treatment with the zinc ejector disulfiram effectively suppressed IAV production. a stretch of uninterrupted uridines at the 5\u2032 end of the negative-strand RNA is essential for mRNA synthesis. ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein), another zinc finger domain-containing protein, has been shown to bind to the 3\u2032 UTR of several viral RNAs. it recruits exonuclease and endonuclease to degrade mRNA, thereby serving as a negative regulator for RNA viruses. it is well-known that cellular transcription repressors are involved in the regulation of DNA virus replication (60\u201362) ZBTB25-mediated double-acting mechanism may be common among cellular transcription promoters or suppressors of IAV. in this study, we demonstrated that ZBTB25 can interact with different viral proteins. PB1 and PA lost ZBTB25-binding ability after RNase A treatment. however, further experiments are required to test this hypothesis. symplekin and CPSF-73 are substrates of SUMO modification. loss of SUMOylation resulted in marked inhibition of 3\u2032-end processing. SUMOylation contributes to the ability of ZBTB25 to bind vRNA and viral proteins. current anti-IAV drugs are designed to target IAV viral proteins and readily develop acquired drug resistance due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses. current anti-IAV drugs are designed to target IAV viral proteins and readily develop acquired drug resistance due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses. full-length ZBTB25 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into the p3XFLAG vector. cDNA of ZBTB25 WT, 5\u2032-GCTTCCATTCTGGAAAGTAAT-3\u2032 was converted to 5\u2032-GCTTCGATCCTCGAGAGAGAGAGCAAT-3\u2032 without changing the amino acid sequence. pEGFP\u2013SUMO-1\u2013GG, pCDNA3.0-HA-SENP1, pCDNA3.0-HA-SENP2 and pCDNA3.0-HA-SENP3 were kind gifts from Hsiu-Ming Shih, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. cells were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of IAV at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after 2 days of incubation, cells were overlaid with 0.5% agarose (Lonza) containing MEM-alpha. cDNAs were synthesized using a high pure RNA isolation kit. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were performed by using a RealTime ready Universal ProbeLibrary system (Roche) Quantification was further analyzed by LightCycler 480 software (Roche) the primers and probes are as follows: IAV_NP segment, 5\u2032-GATGGAGACTGAGAGAACG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-TCATTTTTCCGACAGATGCTC-3\u2032 (antisense) in vitro immunoprecipitation, cells were transfected with the plasmids as indicated. total cell lysates were lysed by using RIPA reagent (Thermo Scientific) and immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose (Roche) conjugated with the antibodies indicated on the figures and in the figure legends. pGEX-4T1 vector was introduced into Escherichia coli cells. glutathione S-transferase fused with ZBTB25 protein and GST alone were purified. plasmids expressing flag-tagged ZBTB25 WT or K204R or a Flag-tagged control were transduced into HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of HA-SENP1, HA-SENP2 or HA-SENP3 the release of zinc ions from ZBTB25 was determined by the fluorescence emission from the fluorophore fluoZin-3. the recombinant GST-ZBTB25 fusion proteins (10 M) were reacted with disulfiram (5 M) and FluoZin-3 (5 M) at room temperature. luciferase activity was used as an internal control. t tests were used to determine the differences between control and test groups. human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) were maintained in F-12K medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. a pGEX-4T1-ZBTB25 cDNA was moved from p3XFLAG-ZBTB25 to the pGEX-4T1 vector using ecoRI and notI restriction sites. the constructs pEGFP\u2013SUMO-1\u2013GG, pCDNA3.0-HA-SENP1, pCDNA3.0-HA-SENP2 and pCDNA3.0-HA-SENP3 were kind gifts from Hsiu-Ming Shih, anti-HA (MMS-101R), anti-Flag (M2), anti-ubiquitin (FK2), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; GTX100118) and anti-M1 (MCA401) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. cells were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of IAV at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after 2 days of incubation, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) and stained with 1% crystal violet solution (Sigma) the primers and probes are as follows: IAV_NP segment, 5\u2032-GATGGAGACTGAGAACG-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-TCATTTTTCCGACAGATGCTC-3\u2032 (antisense) with universal probe 59 (Roche); GAPDH, 5\u2032-AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-GCCCAATACGACCAAAT CC-3\u2032 (antisense) with universal probe 67 ( total cell lysates were lysed by using RIPA reagent (Thermo Scientific) and immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose (Roche) conjugated with the antibodies indicated on the figures and in the figure legends. in vitro RNA-protein pulldown assays were used to test the binding ability of ZBTB25 to RNA.
