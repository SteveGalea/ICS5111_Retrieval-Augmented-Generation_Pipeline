{"summary": "human, animal, and environmental health are inextricably linked in our modern, highly globalized society. pathogens shared by humans and animals have concurrently emerged. since 1999, humans experienced outbreaks of west Nile virus in the united states and Europe, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the middle east and the emergence of the Ebola virus in west africa. iCOMOS: a knowledge forum using science and medicine to find common ground and solutions to complex problems of animal, human, and environmental health. iCOMOS: a knowledge forum using science and medicine to find common ground and solutions to complex problems of animal, human, and environmental health. dialogue on one health has focused on emerging disease surveillance, public health preparedness, and policy issues. iCOMOS-2014 focused on two of the most important grand challenges of our time. an estimated 870 million people are currently suffering from malnutrition. global production and delivery of food for protein, energy, and micronutrients must not just be maintained, it must be increased. existing land and water resources are already strained and their availability for agriculture will likely decrease. the interface between wildlife and agriculture will only increase as more land is converted for agricultural use to meet consumer demands. nontherapeutic (nonclinical) antibiotic use in food animals is a tool that promotes production efficiency, but it has been associated with a rise in antibiotic resistance of human pathogens. focusing on processes and mechanisms that facilitate pathogen evolution and emergence will help us prepare for unpredictable new outbreaks. single approaches to comprehend and anticipate disease emergence are unlikely to produce informative insights involving environmental factors, multiple reservoirs, and complex human-animal-environment interactions. the rapid growth and persistence of the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus in west africa presents an unfortunate but perfect opportunity for implementing science-based policy at the crossroads of emerging infectious disease ecology and sustainable food security. experts hypothesize that Ebola virus entered the west African population through consumption of infected fruit bats, a plausible scenario given local food needs and practices. universal scientific discovery and exploration approaches that have been applied so effectively to advance human society will need to be applied to complex health issues of modern life. a linear refocusing of health research away from disease surveillance and investigation resulting in treatment toward environmental surveillance is not enough to inform societal debates on these complex health issues."}
