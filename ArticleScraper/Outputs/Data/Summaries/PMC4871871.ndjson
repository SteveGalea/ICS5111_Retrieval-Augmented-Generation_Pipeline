{"summary": "rabies is an acute as well as progressive encephalomyelitis caused by a neurotropic virus known as RABV. RABV enters the nervous system through the neuromuscular junctions or nerve spindles. there is no clear clinical evidence of the infection. RABV activates the innate immune sensors like retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) RABV has developed a strategy to counteract the antiviral effect of the type I IFN response. the N protein of RABV limits RIG-I signaling (Masatani et al., 2010), whereas the P protein of RABV inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation (Brzozka et al., 2005), suppresses STAT1 nuclear translocation (Vidy et al., 2005; Brzozka a wide variety of wild-type and laboratory-attenuated rabies viral strains are available for comparative antiviral immune system studies. differences in the host immune responses and pathogeny during infection by virulent and attenuated RABV strains still provide a vast scope to conduct precisely planned and more comprehensive investigations. mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and given intranasal (i.n.) doses of either CVS-11 or HEP-FLury in 50 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and mock-infected control mice were treated with PBS. the brain tissues were removed, lysed in TRizol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen, USA) or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at 80\u00b0C, for respective studies. all the procedures were conducted in accordance with the public health service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals. the RPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to that particular gene. differential expression analyses of the conditions in each group were performed using the DESeq package (1.12.0) the RT-qPCR assay was carried out using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the mRNA copy numbers of a particular gene were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using the 2CT method. mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and given intranasal doses of either CVS-11 or HEP-FLury in 50 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) infected animals were observed twice per day for 50 days in order to find any rabies signs and symptoms. whole-transcriptome analysis of mouse brain RNA Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Germany) RNA-Seq was performed by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) following standard conditions. resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach. genes with an adjusted P 0.05 and absolute fold change greater than 2.0 were considered as differentially expressed. all sequencing data were deposited in NCBI's sequencing database. dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40) after electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. mice infected with CVS-11 developed typical neurologic signs of rabies. all died between 10 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) viral genomic RNA was readily detected in the brain tissue of HEP-Flury and CVS-11 infected mice. adaptive immunity better than CVS-11 and attenuated HEP-Flury infections. mice were infected with 104 FFU of either CVS-11 or HEP-Flury i.n. and PBS mock-infected mice served as the controls. a group of 15 genes, mainly involved in antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigens via MHC class II, were at least 2-fold up-regulated in the HEP-Flury infected mice. many genes showed significant dysregulation only during CVS-11 infection, including 1528 up-regulated genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding, cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis, angiogenesis and coagulation. a Venn diagram shows the number and fold change of up-regulated genes. a threshold of 2-fold change in expression levels and adjusted P 0.05. the largest amount of up-regulated genes emerged at 18 dpi. cluster 1 consisted of the genes that showed the highest level at 10 dpi. cluster 2, in which gene expression was increased until 18 dpi, had 751 members. cluster 4 consisted of 31 genes that were up-regulated consistently from 10 to 25 dpi. RING finger protein 125 (RNF125), interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), DExH (Asp-Glu-X-His) box polypeptide 58 (Dhx58, also known as LGP2) were up-regulated following CVS-11 and HEP-Flury infections. all of these genes were expressed in both groups after 7 dpi and overexpressed more intensively following CVS-11. the CXCR3, a receptor of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 was elevated only in the brains of the HEP-Flury infected mice at 10 dpi. the mRNA levels specific for c-Jun, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were increased more significantly in the CVS-11 infected mouse brains than the HEP-Flury inf asterisks indicate significant differences in copy numbers between different RABV infections at same time points determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple-comparison test. ** and * represent P-values of less than 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. expression levels of the MHC class I were higher following the HEP-Flury infection at either 7 or 10 dpi. pre-activated by HEP-flury or NDV infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 from invading in the CNS. we infected mice with 104 FFU of HEP-Flury in advance and challenged them with lethal doses of CVS-11 i.n. at 0, 2, 4, 8 days after the HEP-Flury infection. a parallel group of CVS-11 infected mice at 2 days after HEP-Flury infection was set all mice that survived belonged to the HEP-Flury and NDV pre-infected groups but not others. survival rate of the infected group was 60%, indicating that the innate immunity plays a critical role in preventing CVS-11 from invading or progressing in the CNS. the i.n. route was chosen because it is the most efficient method of rapidly promoting RABV entry into the brain while avoiding the injury that induces innate immune mechanisms that accompany intracranial (i.c.) administration. the mice infected with CVS-11 developed typical neurologic signs of rabies, including ataxia and paralysis. HEP-Flury infected mice developed RABV-specific immunity at 10 dpi. even low levels of RV-Ab were undetectable in CVS-11 mice. CVS-11 infected mice showed more severe clinical symptoms and higher CVS-11 replication rate. global transcriptome analysis revealed the immune regulation of CNS in rabies pathogenesis and protection. a total of 2233 genes were found to be up-regulated and 621 genes were down-regulated in the brain tissue following infection with CVS-11 at 10 days after infection. the magnitude of the altered genes that were down-regulated was much lower than up-regulated genes. 619 genes with roles in synaptic transmission and ion transport found to be exclusively down-regulated. genes encode CD5 antigen, immunoglobulin heavy chain 6, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), interleukin (IL)-27 receptor alpha and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3). most of the genes with abnormal expression were up-regulated, only a few genes were down-regulated. cluster 2 consisted of 31 genes that were up-regulated consistently from 10 to 25 dpi, including 4 immunoglobulin genes. cluster 4 consisted of 21 genes that were expressed at the highest levels in mock-infected mice. dpi, 18 dpi and 25 dpi have differentially expressed genes in infected mice. dpi, 18 dpi and 25 dpi have differentially expressed genes in the infected mice. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the RIG-I, MDA5 and their regulators were up-regulated following CVS-11 and HEP-Flury infections. the IFN- and IRF-7 were up-regulated earlier at day 4 after HEP-Flury infection but not in CVS-11 infection. the proinflammatory chemokines in both the families C-C and C-X-C, including CCL2 (MCP), CCL3 (MIP-1), CCL4 (MIP-1), CCL7 (MCP-3), CXCL1 (MIP-2), CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10) and IG-I, STAT-1, and p-STAT-1 showed that they were all gradually up-regulated in response to infection with both viruses. either CVS-11 or HEP-Flury can engage RIG-I and IFN-/ during the infection, resulting in the innate immune signaling. mRNAs specific for lymphocyte surface markers, including CD19, CD3, CD4, CD8, were up-regulated more significantly in response to the infection with HEP-Flury at 10 dpi. light-chain mRNA, indicative of antibody production, was elevated to higher levels in the HEP-Flury infected mice at 10 dpi. flury infection achieved 30 and 60% survival, respectively. only HEP-Flury was detected in all brains of survived mice. a parallel group of CVS-11 infected mice at 2 days after infection was set up. intranasal inoculation with the HEP-Flury promotes survival in CVS-11 challenged mice. the groups of 10 adult mice pretreated respectively with 104 FFU of HEP-Flury (i.n. inoculation), HEP-Flury (i.m. injection), -propiolactone-inactivated HEP-Flury (i.n. inoculation), 107 EID50 NDV vaccine strain LaSo the type I IFN response is continuously triggered in either CVS-11 or HEP-Flury infected mice. RABV dampens type I IFN signaling by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and STAT1 translocation. in dendritic cells infected with the wild-type RABV compared to the laboratory-attenuated RABV. the level of de novo-synthesized leader RNA generated in the CNS infected by CVS-11 may be lower than in the HEP-Flury-infected CNS at the early stage. innate immunity activated by certain RNA virus infections can effectively prevent virulent RABV from spreading to the CNS causing fatal encephalitis. chemokines and receptors were up-regulated more strongly in the CVS-11 infection than the HEP-Flury at a later stage. in west Nile virus, it is neuronal CXCL10 that directs CD8+ T Cell recruitment and control of WNV encephalitis. it has been reported that the infection with wild-type (wt) SHBRV does not induce MHC class II expression in the neurovasculature. the virulent RABV may impair the antigen presentation and activation of T cells to inhibit the adaptive immune responses. some viruses have evolved elaborate strategies to disrupt MHC class II-mediated T cell responses by inhibiting the adaptive immune responses. the enhancement of BBB permeability in mice infected with attenuated RABV is associated with the reduction of tight junction protein, such as claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1. adenosine A2a receptor has been indentified as a critical mediator of BBB permeability. chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 are structurally and functionally related cross talks between INF-, chemokines, MHC class II antigen presentation and CD4+ T cell signaling pathways play a pivotal role in the enhancement of BBB permeability. genes, commonly up-regulated in HEP-Flury and CVS-11 infected brains are marked in red, uniquely up-regulated in CVS-11 infected brains are marked in orange and green. inflammation-induced angiogenesis and subsequent remodeling steps are largely mediated by ECM proteins and proteases. alterations in neurophysiology might be due to the malfunction in neurotransmission. many genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport are uniquely down-regulated in CVS-11 infection. the expression of Npas4 was inhibited in the CVS-11 infected brains. it regulates the formation and maintenance of the inhibitory synapses. the arc is required for homeostatic synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors and consolidation of the synaptic plasticity. funding This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31101842) and Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
