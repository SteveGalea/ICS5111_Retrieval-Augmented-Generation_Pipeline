{"summary": "transmission of influenza virus is known to occur directly and indirectly (7,8) direct transmission occurs through inhalation of virus-containing droplets. direct transmission occurs through hand contact with a virus-contaminated surface around the infected individual. the role of transmission via the contact route has also been emphasized (7,8). in this study, the hospital gowns were contaminated with 0.5 ml virus preparation. however, the volume was too large to examine the role of the deposit of virus-containing droplets in an actual environment. nine types of clothing were used as test samples. influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (obtained from Dr Nakajima) was used throughout the experiments. the viruses were propagated in MDCK cells cultured in MEM. all the test cloths were examined in triplicate or quadruplicate. aliquots of these virus samples were serially diluted with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA. a 10-l aliquot of a virus-free medium was inoculated on the surface. clothing materials Color Thickness (mm) Relative remaining virus infectivity at 20 min after deposita Jersey Polyester 100% Navy blue 0.16 0.001 One-piece Polyester 100% Black 0.39 0.001 Jeans Cotton 98% Polyurethane 2% Blue 1.22 0.001 Hemp pants Cannabis 55% Cotton 45% Khaki 0.52 0.001 Black sweater Acrylic fiber 100% Black 2.78 0.002 Parka polyester 100 % Gray 1.02 0.004 T-shirt Cotton 100% White 0.78 0.17 White sweater Pil the contaminated cloths were left in the dish without cover in a safety cabinet. the average temperature and humidity in the cabinet was 27\u00b0C and 30% respectively. each piece of the contaminated cloth was transferred into a glass test tube. the weight of the inoculated cloths was determined in triplicate at 0, 10, 15 and 20 min. the relative water content was calculated by dividing the weight at each time point by the weight at time 0. Results and Discussion The potential risk of indirect transmission through the contact of hands with virus-contaminated surfaces has been increasingly emphasized as a cause of the pandemic spread of influenza A virus. the measured values reflect only the infectious virus recovered in the extracts, not those irreversibly absorbed on the cloths. the recovered virus infectivity was below the level of detection, indicating that during the 20-min period, these cloths inactivated or irreversibly bound the influenza virus. the black sweater, parka and cardigan were the least effective in inactivation or irreversible virus absorption. evaporation of water from the deposit often showed variability in virus recovery. both the cardigan and the white sweater exhibited strong variation among the experiments. the presence or absence of these variations may be associated with the observation that the mode of absorption of virus-containing liquid into test cloths is quite variable. the pH of the sample cloths was measured by soaking in 20 volumes of distilled water at room temperature for 3 or 48 h. however, the solution in all the samples showed a neutral pH regardless of the incubation time. the pH of the cloths played no role in the different recoveries observed for the virus infectivity from the test cloths. the jersey rapidly lost water, reaching >95% loss within 10 min after leaving the contaminated cloths in the safety cabinet (closed circle) similar results were obtained for the one-piece; the amount of residual water at 10 min after deposit was 3.3% of the input. the white sweater lost little water over time, with 70% of the water remaining after 20 min. indirect transmission of influenza through virus-contaminated clothing may occur. further work is required to understand the role of indirect transmission. study of the survival of viruses on contaminated hands and surfaces."}
