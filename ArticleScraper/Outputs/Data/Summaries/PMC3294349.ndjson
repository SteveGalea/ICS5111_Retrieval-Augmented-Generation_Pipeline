{"summary": "a cross-sectional survey was carried out on healthcare workers who worked with SARS patients in the first, second, and third Affiliated Hospitals. outbreaks of SARS had occurred among healthcare workers in the second and third Affiliated Hospitals but not the First Affiliated Hospital. a suspected case-patient was defined as one who had close contact with a patient, had symptoms and signs of febrile respiratory illness, and had changes on chest radiograph. a patient was considered to have a suspected case if he or she visited or lived in an area where SARS cases were reported with secondary transmission within 2 weeks of illness onset. he or she had symptoms and signs of febrile respiratory illness, and had changes on chest radiograph. a person who had visited or lived in cities where SARS cases were reported with secondary transmission was placed under medical observation. 709 healthcare workers were sampled from 2 hospitals with no SARS patients. a suspected case-patient was defined as one who had close contact with a patient. a patient was also considered to have a probable case if he or she visited or lived in an area where SARS was reported with secondary transmission within 2 weeks of illness onset. a person who had visited or lived in cities where SARS cases were reported with secondary transmission was placed under medical observation if he or she had symptoms and signs of febrile respiratory illness. detecting Serum IgG against SARS-CoV Immunoglobulin (Ig) G were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. all 5 hospitals are teaching hospitals of the Sun Yat-Sen University. SARS-related information first Affiliated Hospital Second Affiliated Hospital Third Affiliated Hospital Affiliated Cancer Hospital Fifth Affiliated Hospital In SARS-epidemic area. the index patient was identified as a superspreader who infected >100 persons. the prevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV was 88.9% (80/90) for those who contracted SARS and 1.4% (15/1,057) for those who did not. participants No. positive for IgG Prevalence (%) Age (y)* 26 355 44 12.4 26\u201330 310 17 5.5 31\u201335 211 14 6.6 36\u201340 118 9 7.6 >40 141 11 7.8 Sex Male 306 15 4.7 Female 743 80 9.7 Educational level* Senior school 112 14 12.5 Technical secondary school 401 42 10.5 Junior college 210 11 5.2 University 197 17 8.6 MD/PhD 227 11 4.8 Department SARS the mean age of the healthcare workers investigated was 30.78 years (SD 9.1 years); 71.6% were women. sociodemographic characteristics of 1,856 healthcare workers are shown in Table 2. healthcare workers exposed to SARS surveyed 389 361 397 371 338 No. days when SARS patients were in the hospital 120 110 102 0 0 No. probable SARS patients cared for 122 150 31 0 0 No. suspected SARS patients cared for 102 50 30 3 0 No. the overall seroprevalence in this reference group of healthcare workers was 0.4% (3/709). compared the prevalence of anti-SARS IgG in healthcare workers for each sociodemographic characteristic. the seroprevalence of anti-SARS IgG in healthcare workers 26 years of age was significantly higher than in those >26 years of age. women had a higher seroprevalence than men (p 0.05) women had a higher seroprevalence than those with tertiary education. low seroprevalence o SARS IgG in healthy healthcare workers with different levels of exposure to SARS patients is similar to that reported by Wang et al. in Beijing. a similar study by Chow et al. in Singapore did not find any serologic evidence of subclinical infection among a population with a high likelihood of exposure to the virus. the low seropositivity among healthy healthcare workers suggests that the level of immunity to SARS in the general population in Guangzhou was too low to constitute an effective immune barrier against the spread of SARS. the first affiliated hospital only admitted SARS patients after outbreaks had occurred among healthcare workers in the Second and Third Affiliated Hospitals. a high proportion of healthcare workers who have contracted SARS have IgG against SARS-CoV in their serum samples after they have fully recovered. the low seropositivity against SARS among healthcare workers who have not been exposed to SARS patients suggests a lack of immunity in this group."}
