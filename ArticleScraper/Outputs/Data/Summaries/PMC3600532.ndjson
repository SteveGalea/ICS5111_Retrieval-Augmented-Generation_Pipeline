{"summary": "bats can host a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens. some of the pathogens are known to infect and cause disease in humans and domestic animals. bat ecology may influence disease dynamics and their propensity to serve as reservoirs for emerging pathogens. human activities that increase exposure to bats will increase the opportunity for infections to be transmitted between bats and humans or to intermediate hosts such as pets and livestock. attempts to understand how host ecology impacts the dynamics of infection are relatively few in wild animal populations and fewer still for bat populations. attempts at understanding how infections themselves evolve to persist in wildlife hosts with different ecologies are rarer still. several studies have involved explicit hypothesis testing regarding pathogen associations and the unique ecological characteristics of bats. but there is currently a paucity of studies on the ecology of bat infectious diseases, sometimes leading us to reference some studies in multiple contexts. the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown. the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown. the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown. Turmelle et al. (2010a) showed empirically contrasting temporal patterns of RABV exposure in Tadarida brasiliensis at different types of roosts during the reproduction season. however, cave colonies in this system are known to harbour up to a million individual bats. the authors speculated in models of HeV in pteropid bats that population connectivity and immunity played a key role in the infection dynamics, rather than a simple influx of nave young. incorporating waning maternal immunity into models describing HeV\u2013Pteropus interactions provided a better fit to the data. the effects of often very different behaviours between male and female bats have yet to be explored in relation to infection dynamics. tropical, nonhibernating bats may use migration and coloniality for other reasons, for example, to track the seasonal availability of fruit and flowers. seasonality and \u2018coloniality\u2019 may affect and drive infection dynamics. seasonality in aggregation and population dynamics of big brown bats in relation to maintenance of RABV in temperate Colorado could differ in warm temperate and tropical areas where the host species also occurs. decreased migration of Pteropus bats could influence intensity and duration of HeV epidemics. the role of torpor in infection dynamics is largely unstudied. Species of bats that differ in their use of migration also often differ in their use of torpor. torpor typically reduces pathogen replication rates and lengthens incubation periods. whitenose syndrome (WNS) has been linked to the deaths of more than five million bats in north America. the associated fungus has been detected in 19 US states and two Canadian provinces. population genetic data can be informative to measure connectivity between bat populations. study should also attempt to capture seasonal variation, such as pre, during and postparturition and migration or hibernation seasons. modelled as step functions (e.g. DukeSylvester et al., 2011) or seasonal forcing (e.g. Hosseini et al., 2004) for example, drive infection dynamics. metapopulation models may be required to capture all aspects of the system. but must also take into account what is observed in small isolated populations. the role and strength of different host reproduction strategies on disease dynamics are as yet unknown, and only rare examples exist in the literature. influx of susceptible young is a crucial driver of infection dynamics. Turmelle et al. (2010a) showed empirically contrasting temporal patterns of RABV exposure in Tadarida brasiliensis at different types of roosts during the reproduction season. however, cave colonies in this system are known to harbour up to a million individual bats (Betke et al., 2008) George et al. (2011) examined transmission dynamics of HeV in pteropid bats. authors speculated it was population connectivity and immunity that played a key role in infection dynamics. incorporating waning maternal immunity into models provided a better fit to the data. population density, sex and species composition can vary widely between these two types of seasonal roosting aggregations. tropical, nonhibernating bats may use migration and coloniality for other reasons, for example, to track seasonal availability of fruit and flowers. seasonality and \u2018coloniality\u2019 may affect and drive infection dynamics. in bat systems G. destructans dynamics and the current epidemic in north America appear to be especially driven by coloniality and migration. seasonality in aggregation and population dynamics of big brown bats could differ in warm temperate and tropical areas where the host species also occurs. reliance on short term and shallow torpor to offset energy deficits is less well described. the role of torpor in infection dynamics is largely unstudied. species of bats that differ in their use of migration also often differ in their use of torpor. the associated fungus G. destructans has been detected in 19 states and two provinces. the associated fungus colonizes the skin causing devastating lesions by eroding, digesting and replacing living skin tissues. some studies captured longterm longitudinal data. but some studies captured longterm longitudinal data. a host population genetic data can be informative. chanistic models may be required to ascertain whether seasonal birth pulses or changes in contact rates drive infection dynamics. metapopulation models may be required to capture all aspects of the system (e.g. Plowright et al., 2011) but must also take into account what is observed in small isolated populations. multihost and pathogen dynamics are important in other nonbat systems. there are important studies that suggest these situations may occur in bat infection systems. some viruses, notably RABV, are promiscuous, infecting multiple host species. Streicker et al. (2010) documented highly asymmetrical patterns of crossspecies RABV transmission in the North American bat fauna. in some cases, infection cycles may be maintained in coroosting species without crossspecies transmission. Commerson\u2019s leafnosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni) is a possible reservoir of Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), while Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and Miniopterus spp. bats in the same caves were seropositive against Lagos bat virus (LBV) and west Caucasian bat evolutionary studies could be incorporated that tease out crossspecies transmission events (e.g. Cui et al., 2007; Streicker et al., 2011) and infection dynamics (e.g. Drexler et al., 2011) may select for different optimal levels of virulence in bats. infection adapts to the most abundant host, then it may be maladapted to other, less frequent hosts. decreased interspecies transmission leads to pathogen adaptation to a more abundant host species, whereas increased interspecies transmission leads to more generalist virulence strategies. despite these theoretical studies, there is currently little empirical evidence for bat host ecology affecting pathogen virulence. the high proportion (74%) of human rabies cases attributable to bat RABV variants cannot be explained by a higher frequency of exposure to these species. the RABV variants associated with L. noctivagans and P. subflavus are widespread among bat populations. RABV variants associated with tree bats are among the most recent to emerge. females migrate to higher latitudes in north America during spring and summer. males tend to migrate shorter distances and occupy mountainous regions. experimental infection studies are required using isolates of pathogens from migratory and nonmigratory species and from those using torpor. results from one system (e.g. lyssaviruses) should be confirmed in others, such as the CoVs and AstVs that have been detected in bats. mutations can appear and be fixed in a short period of time relative to the host\u2019s evolutionary time frame. the pathogen\u2019s ecology must also balance factors that affect transmission, such as virulence, epidemiological \u2018burnout\u2019 and mechanisms for persistence in complex host populations. there is little empirical evidence for differences in virulence among viruses of the same genus in their bat hosts. maintenance strategies used by RABV and CoV clearly differ. both have spilled over into humans and caused fatal infections. RABV infection has a low detectable prevalence, but high fitness impact on bat hosts. experimentally measuring pathogen shedding and transmission of infections with different ecological strategies in a single host may determine whether those with higher virulence have higher shedding. Detailed integrative modelling of disease dynamics in bats requires data and input from ecologists, bat biologists, pathogen experts, virologists, molecular biologists and epidemiological modellers. models of bat infection dynamics should integrate hypotheses regarding seasonal behaviours, including migration, coloniality and torpor use. this approach has helped reveal the relative importance of transmission mechanisms in a plague prairie dog system (Webb et al., 2006) and in a bat RABV system. a modelguided fieldwork approach should be undertaken for the most parsimonious study design. simulations and sensitivity analyses can be used to test different hypotheses. further studies should also take comparative approaches. to date, the viruses are yet to be isolated by cell culture from any bat. to date there has been no CoV isolate from bats because of nonpermissive nature of extant cell culture systems. experimental studies in bats, such as those with RABV and other lyssaviruses, can be very costly. EBOV (Swanepoel et al., 1996) and HeV (Williamson et al., 1998) can be very costly. migratory species or species with large colony sizes are difficult once bats reach maturity. determination of the true age of wild bats is also difficult once bats reach maturity, making life table analyses intractable. individuals in large colonies are difficult to identify and count. small colonies may be inconspicuous. tracking over long distances requires more labourintensive methods. transmitter size limits use of telemetry in most bat species. improved microtechnologies are required to reduce the size of the transmitters without compromising battery capacity. new technologies are being developed to gain more accurate estimates. these experimental studies must be designed to better understand empirical field data. baseline estimates of antibody responses from naive bats are necessary to better interpret serological results from field studies. however, substantial advancements in the understanding of bat infection ecology will be made once innate immune responses are understood. humans encroach into bat habitats, and bats are utilizing artificial structures as roosts. a number of MARV spillover cases have been linked epidemiologically to cave activities such as tourism and mining. pus and Eidolon bats (old world fruit bats) in Asia and Africa can be very high. the harvested numbers suggest that human\u2013bat interactions are occurring on an enormous scale throughout both continents. this gap must be addressed if we are to understand spillover risk. monitoring population and infection dynamics in both these and untouched populations could provide evidence of increased intensity of epidemics in the local populations. a combination of field and laboratory studies can be used to create well-validated datadriven mechanistic models to elucidate the aspects of bat ecology. this traitbased predictive approach will be particularly important when population surveillance data are unavailable. it is unclear which aspects of host ecology may be most important in driving potential disease emergence. authors are funded by the Wellcome Trust (DTSH), a David H.
