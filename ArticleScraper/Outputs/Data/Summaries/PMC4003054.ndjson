{"summary": "in humans, -T cells constitute approximately 1%\u20135% of circulating T cells. most of them bear the V9V2 T-cell receptor (TCR) in humans, -T cells can be specifically activated in an HLA-unrestricted manner. human lung alveolar epithelial cells are a more reliable target to investigate the antiviral role of -T cells. cytotoxic activity of PAM-expanded human V9V2-T cells was dependent on cell-to-cell contact. PBMCs were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum RPMI-1640 medium with 9 g/ml of PAM. the purity of -T cells, as determined by flow cytometry, was consistently >97%. anti-FasL, anti-TRAIL and their ligands DR4 and DR5 were used for intracellular staining. cells were fixed, permeabilized and then stained with anti-perforin and anti-granzyme B (GrB, GB11) antibodies or their relevant isotype controls. the supernatants in the transwell coculture of V9V2-T cells and A549s were collected at the indicated time for determining the virus titer. for 5 h, the cells in the bottom wells were harvested and analyzed for cell death, as described above. PBMCs were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum RPMI-1640 medium. IL-2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to reach a final concentration of 500 IU/ml every 3 days from day 3. purity of -T cells was consistently >97%. anti-CD69, anti-TRAIL, anti-TCR-, anti-MICA/B, anti-Fas, anti-FasL, anti-TRAIL and their ligands DR4 and DR5. cells were fixed, permeabilized and then stained with anti-perforin and anti-granzyme B (GrB, GB11) antibodies. the supernatants in the transwell coculture of V9V2-T cells and A549s were collected at an E/T ratio of 101 for 5 h. the neutralization antibodies anti-NKG2D (10 g/ml; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), anti-FasL (10 g/ml; R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA), anti-TRAIL (10 g/ml; R&D) were added to the co fresh and PAM-expanded V9V2-T cells expressed low levels of FasL, high levels of Fas and medium levels of CD69, NKG2D, TRAIL, perforin and granzyme B. fresh and PAM-expanded V9V2-T cells expressed low levels of FasL, high levels of Fas and medium levels of CD69, NKG2D, TRAIL, perforin and granzyme B. granzyme B, and gray histograms represent isotype controls. traIL, tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. the percentages of dead A549 cells among target cells (CD3 population), identified as CD3EthD2+, for four different experiments are shown. the killing of virus-infected A549 cells by V9V2-T cells is dependent on cell-to-cell contact. influenza virus replication in A549 cells is inhibited by V9V2-T cells. the virus titer in the culture supernatants gradually increased from 6 h post-infection and reached a peak level at 72 h post-infection. culturing was performed by a transwell culture system at an E/T ratio of 201. the virus titers of supernatants were determined by TCID50 on MDCK cells. data are the means.e.m. of TCID50 titers of four separate experiments. perforin inhibitors CMA, granzyme B inactivator Bcl-2, anti-FasL, anti-TRAIL anti-NKG2D blocking antibodies, or their relevant isotype control, were used. cytotoxicity was analyzed by flow cytometry as the percentage of EthD-2+ cells in the CD3 population. the perforin\u2013granzyme B pathway is involved in the cytotoxicity of V9V2-T cells against influenza virus-infected A549 cells. the perforin\u2013granzyme B pathway is involved in the cytotoxicity of V9V2-T cells against influenza virus-infected lung alveolar epithelial cells. me B expression compared to fresh and PAM-expanded V9V2-T cells. white histograms represent surface expression of CD69, NKG2D, MIC A/B, Fas, FasL, TRAIL, DR4 (TRAIL receptor 1), DR5 (TRAIL receptor 2), intracellular perforin and granzyme B. 2-T cells were either mock infected (A549) or infected with influenza H1N1 PR/8 virus at an MOI of 2 (vA549) and then cultured with purified PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells (Effector, E) at various E/T ratios for 5 h. the percentage of dead A549 cells among target cells (CD3 population), identified as CD3EthD2+, is shown. culturing was performed by a transwell culture system at an E/T ratio of 201 for 6 h. the percentages (means.e.m.) of dead A549 cells among target cells are shown. A549 cells were infected (vA549) with influenza H1N1 PR/8 virus at an MOI of 2 and then cultured with or physically separated from the purified PAM-expanded V9V2 T cells. the virus titers of supernatants were determined by TCID50 on MDCK cells. the expression level of surface MICA/B, Fas, FasL and DR4, DR5 on the virus infected-A549 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. the data shown as the means.e.m. are representative of four independent experiments. the perforin-granzyme B pathway is involved in the cytotoxicity of V9V2-T cells against influenza virus-infected A549 cells. the perforin specific inhibitor CMA and granzyme B inactivator Bcl-2 were used. these results demonstrate that the perforin\u2013granzyme B pathway is involved in the cytotoxicity of V9V2-T cells. a concern for -T cell-based immunotherapy is whether PAM-expanded V9V2-T cells can traffic to the lung during an influenza infection. in a humanized mouse model, we further demonstrated that PAM can activate and expand V9V2-T cells in vivo, and then control influenza disease in immunodeficient mice. NKG2D is a potent costimulatory receptor of the cytotoxic functions of human natural killer and V9V2-T cells. it can trigger V9V2-T cells to release cytolytic granules by recognition of the NKG2D ligand. almost all the PAM-expanded V9V2-T cells expressed NKG2D, and the cytotoxicity of V9V2-T cells against influenza virus-infected lung alveolar epitheli virus-infected lung alveolar epithelial cells and PAM-expanded V9V2-T cells expressed high levels of Fas or FasL. the blockade of the Fas/FasL pathway by FasL neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited the cytolytic activity of V9V2-T cells against influenza virus-infected cells. this is not surprising, as A549 cells are immortalized human alveolar epithelial cells. the cytotoxic activity of PAM-expanded human V9V2-T cells is dependent on cell-to-cell contact. the pathways of perforin\u2013granzyme B, TRAIL and Fas\u2013FasL are also involved in their cytotoxicity."}
