{"summary": "oligomannose structures constitute the vast majority of N-linked glycans in the HIV-1 glycan shield [12,13], and help the virus evade immune surveillance [14]. GRFT binds oligosaccharides to multiple sites on a single molecule [11], thereby occluding functionally important domains of the viral envelope glycoprotein. GRFT\u2019s tolerability profile and broad spectrum activity against susceptible viruses advocate for its further development as an antiviral chemopreventative or chemotherapeutic. despite the impressive wealth of studies assessing GRFT\u2019s therapeutic value, little is known about its pharmacokinetic profile, which could limit its use as a drug. rats were weighed and treated with a single dose of GRFT. for intravenous treatment, indwelling catheters were checked for patency. for subcutaneous treatment, 10 or 20 mg/kg GRFT was injected. a total of 18 rats with no indwelling catheters were treated daily with PBS (n = 6), 20 mg/kg GRFT (n = 6), or 40 mg/kg GRFT (n = 6) for a period of 10 days by gavage of 1 mL solution. blood samples were drawn via lateral tail vein on day 5 approximately 3 h after oral dosing. fecal extracts were formulated using 0.5 g of dried powder and 2 mL of PBS. resulting fecal slurry was thoroughly mixed and cleared twice by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min. the final supernatant was aliquoted for GRFT concentration determination. PK Solutions Software obtained GRFT serum concentrations at sampling time points. values were generated from concentration time curves based on GRFT amounts administered. 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 150 L of blood were drawn 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h post-administration. animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation followed by thoracotomy at study completion. on day 5, animals were sacrificed approximately 3 h after oral dosing. blood samples were then obtained by cardiac puncture. six fecal pellets were randomly collected at 8 and 24 h after initial treatment. serum and fecal extracts were coated with 10 g/mL purified influenza hemagglutinin (HA) instead of 250 ng/mL gp120. this method detects active GRFT. GRFT\u2019s Bioavailability after intravenous administration GRFT was detected at all time points assessed after administration of a single dose. at 15 min, animals displayed average serum GRFT concentrations of 74 8 and 141 22 g/mL in the 10 and 20 mg/kg groups. these amounts rapidly decreased over time, with 827 256 vs. 1540 312 ng/mL, 54 12 vs. 66 19 ng/mL, and 10 at 8, 24, and 48 h, 1811 883, 59 23, and 14 2 ng/mL GRFT, respectively, were detected in the low dose treatment group. half-lives for absorption (0\u20132 h), distribution (4\u20138 h) and elimination (24 h and up) were 0.5 0.1 h, 1.7 0.3 h, and 10.7 4.6 h. 5.7 16.9 203.6 27.6 45.6 9.9 183.2 45.3 VD L 0.4 0.1 0.6 0.2 1.2 0.6 0.2 0.1 Clearance L/h 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.06 0.01 0.02 0.01 CMAX g/mL 81.8 25.7 176.0 26.7 6.6 0.6 19.7 2.4 Data are mean standard deviation. GRFT Is Found in Fecal Extracts after Chronic Oral Treatment. animals treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg GRFT displayed fecal GRFT concentrations averaging approximately 30 ng/mL. but these levels decreased in both groups at 24 h after dosing. antiviral activity of pooled fecal extracts collected during chronic oral treatment with GRFT was assessed in pooled rat fecal extracts from animals dosed with 20 or 40 mg/kg GRFT. the actual mean GRFT concentrations were determined in fecal extracts to derive experimental EC50 obtained from interpolated ID50 values. intravenous, subcutaneous and oral administrations resulted in 131 and 41 g GRFT in urine, respectively. urine GRFT levels in animals treated orally were below detection. instead, GRFT was found in fecal extracts, and approximately 2.3 g GRFT was recovered in the feces. serum GRFT amounts gradually increased from 61 30 and 171 110 ng/mL at 15 min for the 10 and 20 mg/kg groups, respectively, to peak at approximately 4 h post-administration. at 8, 24, and 48 h, 1811 883, 59 23, and 14 2 ng/mL GRFT, respectively, were detected in the low dose treatment group. pharmacokinetic parameters of Griffithsin were obtained within 48 h of systemic administration. similar values were obtained with the high dose of 20 mg/kg for these parameters. a similar trend was observed for maximum serum concentrations (Cmax). intravenous administration of 10 and 20 mg/kg GRFT resulted in Cmax values of 81.8 25.7 and 176.0 26.7 g/mL. volumes of distribution (Vd) and clearance rates were relatively low for both routes and all doses tested. n = 5) and 24 h (n = 6) (B) after oral treatment with GRFT, 20 mg/kg GRFT, or 40 mg/kg GRFT. bars are mean standard deviation from five biological replicates. the actual mean GRFT concentrations were determined in pooled rat fecal extracts to derive experimental EC50 obtained from interpolated ID50 values. intravenous and subcutaneous administrations resulted in 131 and 41 g GRFT in urine, respectively. urine GRFT levels in animals treated orally were below detection. a multiphasic elimination pattern was observed after intravenous treatment. GRFT was excreted mainly in urine starting shortly after intravenous dosing. the final phase of GRFT\u2019s elimination half-life is comparable to that of other protein therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and smaller molecule biologics. serum GRFT concentrations peaked at 4 h post bolus dosing, and persisted up to 96 h. daily subcutaneous self-administration would maintain potential therapeutic effects. GRFT\u2019s EC50 for HIV is approximately 40 pM [7]. of 47 nM would require 35 g/h or 840 g/day to be administered. GRFT showed 43 and 90% bioavailability rates (AUCsubcutaneous)/AUCintravenous) oral GRFT could be used daily to \u201cseed\u201d the bowels and rectal mucosa. serum GRFT concentrations peaked at 4 h post bolus parenteral dosing. daily subcutaneous self-administration would maintain potential therapeutic effect as a prophylactic for HIV."}
