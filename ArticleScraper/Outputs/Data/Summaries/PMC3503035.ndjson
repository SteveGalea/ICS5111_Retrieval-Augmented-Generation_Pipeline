{"summary": "young children are considered an influenza high-risk group due to the large number of young cases throughout the history of influenza (45\u201347, 50, 73, 75, 78, 79, 90, 93, 96) in north America, the number of hospitalized children due to seasonal influenza epidemics can be as high as 10 hospitalizations per 1,000 children. the difference between adult and pediatric immune systems is significant and must be considered in respect to the disease course. pediatric patients accounted for at least 30% to 40% of the total H1N1pdm hospital admissions. ARDSs. Ferrets are a superlative animal model of influenza virus infection. they manifest typical clinical symptoms of influenza and display immune responses similar to those of humans. age-dependent pathogenic factors, such as neonatal ferret lung development in association with influenza virus infections, have been studied and shown to have similarities to those in humans. male ferrets 5 to 8 weeks old (newly weaned) and male ferrets 4 to 6 months old (adult) were bred in an on-site specific-pathogen-free ferret colony (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada) ferrets were shown to be seronegative for currently circulating influenza A and B virus strains by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. newly weaned ferrets were housed in a separate non-BSL-2+ animal holding area to prevent influenza virus transmission from the infected groups. sneezing scores were calculated from the total number of animals witnessed sneezing over the total number of animals. temperature (A) and weight (B) were recorded daily until the last day. the body weights of uninfected newly weaned ferrets (n = 13, 5 to 8 weeks old) were monitored for 15 days and represented as a percentage relative to the average baseline level calculated from the values on days 0 and 1. eptomycin and gentamicin were collected from the euthanized ferrets. all the samples were stored at 80\u00b0C before processing. nasal washes were diluted 1:10 in viral vDMEM. cDMEM contains 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 6 mM glutamine, 1 mM nonessential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. on day 6 postincubation, supernatants were examined for the presence of virus by hemagglutination of 0.5% turkey erythrocytes. antiserum was determined to be the highest dilution that completely inhibited influenza virus hemagglutination of 0.5% turkey erythrocytes at 4 HA units. blood samples were collected in anticoagulant-containing tubes and analyzed in a Hemavet hematology analyzer. RP (1:1,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and goat anti-ferret IgM (1:500; Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) scores for iBALT-like structure were determined by randomly counting five different fields per section of one lobe under a magnification of 40. the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody coupled to HRP in the same blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C. after washing, the membrane was incubated with Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate at room temperature for 1 min before exposure and film development in a darkroom. total RNA was converted into cDNA using an ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega Inc., Madison, WI), followed by quantitative real-time PCR. PCRs were performed using an ABI Prism 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) western blot analysis was performed for the detection of MPO and GAPDH proteins in the lungs of newly weaned and adult ferrets. the average of normalized readouts is shown for each group on days 3 and 7 p.i. a minimum of three lung samples were collected at each time point per group. paraffin-embedded lung sections from infected adult and newly weaned ferrets from day 7 p.i. were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry. representatives are shown for all stainings at a magnification of 100 for a minimum of three animals per group. the university health network (UHN) has certification with the Animals for Research Act. all infections and sample collections were performed under 5% isoflurane anesthesia. each ferret was anesthetized and infected with 1 ml of Mex/4108 inoculum (0.5 ml in each nostril) on the day of infection, each ferret was anesthetized. clinical signs (body temperature, body weight, level of animal activity, and symptoms of nasal discharge and sneezing) were observed daily for 14 days postinfection. healthy newly weaned and adult ferrets would receive the same minimum index of 1.0 as they are active and playful without the need for any incentive. the physical inactivity index measures the degree to which ferrets respond to environmental stimuli, with the basal level being 1.000. nasal washes were collected from the infected ferrets on days 3, 5 and 7 p.i. they were placed in nasal wash buffer (1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) tissues were processed similarly, except that they were initially homogenized 1:10 (wt/vol) in suspension DMEM (sDMEM; vDMEM excluding 1% BSA) before infection, MDCK cells were maintained in the log phase at low passage numbers and grew in cell DMEM. sera were collected from uninfected or infected ferrets on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 p.i. the influenza virus-specific antibody response from the uninfected or infected ferrets was measured by HI assay. a polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD3 (1:500; Dako Canada, Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada) followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (FITC; 1:200; AbD Serotec Ltd., Kidlington, United Kingdom) scores for the iBALT-like structure were determined by randomly counting five different fields per section of one lobe under a magnification of proteins were standardized using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Canada Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) boiled in sampling buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.001% bromophenol blue, 1% -mercaptoethanol) before loading onto the gel. after gel electrophoresis, the content was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the semidry method RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as previously described (71). RNA extraction and real-time PCR were performed as previously described (71). RNA extraction and real-time PCR were performed as previously described (71). hematological cells were counted for total leukocytes (A), lymphocytes (B), monocytes (C), neutrophils (D), eosinophils (E), and basophils (F) in adult and newly weaned ferrets on the indicated days for 2 weeks after initial leukocyte sampling. a minimum of three samples from each time point were collected per group. iBALT-like structures in lungs of newly weaned ferrets from day 7 p.i. were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. a minimum of three lung samples were collected at each time point per group. ant averaged values were first standardized to each corresponding -actin level. a minimum of three lung samples were collected at each time point per group. errors represent standard errors of the means. adult ferrets developed acute and intense fever on day 2 p.i. Upon infection, adult ferrets developed an acute and intense fever on day 2 p.i. which extended over the following 6 days. however, newly weaned ferrets did not manifest a high fever on day 2 p.i. but had a slight increase in temperature on day 2 p.i. that then oscillated between 101% of the baseline temperature and the baseline temperature for the remainder of the viral load was assessed in the nasal cavity, trachea, and lung of infected animals. by day 7 p.i., both newly weaned and adult ferrets were able to clear the virus throughout their respiratory tracts. a minimum of three samples from each time point were collected per group. we compared the influenza virus-specific IgG, IgA, and IgM levels in the newly weaned versus adult ferrets using lung lysates. the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. however, the comparison also showed no statistically significant differences. leukocyte kinetics bifurcated into two profiles between the two age groups. lymphocyte and monocyte levels increased more rapidly postinfection in newly weaned ferrets. neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil levels were significantly higher. in the newly weaned animals, only minor desquamation of the cuboidal epithelial cells and debris plugs was observed in the bronchioles. the majority of the young ferret alveoli appeared normal and similar to those in uninfected control ferrets. bronchiolitis and alveolitis caused early improvement of pulmonary histopathology in newly weaned ferrets. hematoxylin-eosin staining of paraffin-embedded lung sections from uninfected adult (A) and uninfected newly weaned (B) ferrets and from infected adult (C, E, and G), and infected newly weaned (D, F, and H) RNA was extracted from newly weaned and adult ferret lungs on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 after H1N1pdm infection. the responses of regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-1, dampen and modulate the inflammatory responses to balance the destructive nature of inflammation. differential ISG responses between the two groups prompted us to examine MHC expression in the lung upon infection. young and adult animals have been shown to have a distinct, preferred T cell epitope hierarchy in relation to MHC (72). numerous discrete structures of mononuclear leukocyte aggregation were found at the peribronchiolar and sometimes bronchiole-associated perivascular regions in the lungs of newly weaned ferrets. similar structures were also observed at the lamina propria surrounding some regions of bronchi. however, these structures were not prominently identified in adult lungs. CD3+ cells and IgA-positive (IgA+)/IgM+ cells disseminated into the peribronchiolar and alveolar spaces. CD11c represents conventional dendritic cells. no statistically significant differences were seen for CD3e, CD19 and CD11c. healthy male influenza virus-nave young (newly weaned, 5 to 8 weeks old) and adult (4 to 6 months old) ferrets were infected with influenza virus A/Mex/4108/2009 (Mex/4108), an H1N1pdm strain that we previously shown induces a severe clinical course in ferrets (35). animals were monitored for clinical symptoms daily for 14 days p.i. newly weaned ferrets experienced weight loss at day 2 p.i., although their weights never fell below the baseline and quickly recovered, gaining weight over the baseline by day 3. the slopes of weight gain from both groups were parallel after day 3 p.i., which suggested similar growth rates between the two groups. tracheas (B), lungs (C) from infected ferrets were collected on the specified days p.i. and processed before titrating on MDCK cells. a minimum of three samples from each time point were collected per group. HI assay measured the HI titer against live A/Mexico/4108/2009 virus. virus-specific immunoglobulins in the serum or lung were similar between the two groups. the newly weaned and adult ferrets induced robust influenza virus-specific antibody responses. the results suggest that both the newly weaned and adult ferrets induced robust influenza virus-specific antibodies. the neutrophil level was substantially higher in the adults from days 0 to 7 p.i.. distinct leukocyte profiles in the peripheral blood were observed between the two age groups upon H1N1pdm infection. in the adult lung were found at the peribronchiolar and bronchiole-associated perivascular regions in the lungs of newly weaned ferrets. in contrast, we observed intensive alveolar consolidation, hemorrhage, edema, and inflammatory exudates in several regions of the adult lungs. cellular debris of the inflammatory cells, fibrin, and a mucous plug were readily observed in the adult airway lumens. we quantified the neutrophil protein MPO levels in the lungs by Western blotting and densitometry. blots showed antibody specificity to positive-control ferret neutrophils and no reactivity toward ferret lymphocyte cell lysate. adults had significantly larger amount of MPO in lungs on day 3 and day 7 p.i. than in adult lung tissue. RNA was extracted from newly weaned and adult ferret lungs on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 after H1N1pdm infection. RNA was subject to real-time PCR for ISG and IL-10 and TGF-1 gene expression in newly weaned ferrets. these genes were highly expressed on day 3 p.i. in newly weaned ferrets. weaned ferrets differed significantly from those in adult ferrets. formation of immune cell organizations in the lungs of newly weaned ferrets. leukocyte infiltration into the lung is one of the signature inflammatory responses upon influenza virus infection. this process can also lead to intensive tissue damage if the response is not controlled. the difference reached statistical significance (P 0.000001) to further investigate the makeup of these structures, we stained the infected and uninfected lungs from both age groups. we performed immunohistochemistry on the lungs of infected and uninfected adult and young ferrets using antibodies for CD3, IgM, and IgA. at day 7 p.i., newly weaned ferret lung tissue showed positive CD3 staining in the cells surrounding the bron we quantified transcripts known to be expressed by T and B cells, such as CD3e and CD19, and the chemokines, such as CCL19, and CXCL13. no statistically significant differences were seen for CD3e, CD19, and CD11c. the unique clinical outcome of H1N1pdm infection in children may be indicative of the differential immunological mechanisms in their developing immune systems compared to those in the immune systems of adults. the pediatric approach to influenza virus infection remains complex and further work is needed to dissect the critical players in the pathogenesis. newly weaned ferrets elicited more active ISG responses in the lungs. levels of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils were acutely raised in the newly weaned ferrets. the newly weaned ferrets elicited more active ISG responses in the lungs. our pathological findings for H1N1pdm infection in the adult ferrets were in accord with previous observations of the severe outcomes of H1N1pdm infection in humans, mice, and ferrets. we observed severe pneumonia (interstitial pneumonia and bronchiolitis) with alveolar consolidation, hemorrhage, edema, and inflammatory debris in the airway spaces in adult lungs. ferret neutrophil levels were consistently high in the adult ferrets. but kinetics of MHC expression differed between the two groups. it is not clear if the MHC expression level may also be altered between the two age groups upon H1N1pdm infection. study shows reduced inflammatory responses in adult and newly weaned ferrets. it is possible that an unknown additional regulatory mechanism contained the excessive inflammatory responses in the young ferrets. it has previously been demonstrated that the neonatal immune system is highly regulated. iBALT is defined by the location of the structure, organized cell types, and chemokine network that are involved. iBALT is considered an inducible ectopic lymphoid organ that encompasses B and T cell zones which are adjacent to each other for the purpose of priming the adaptive immune responses. iBALT was formed more readily in the adult mice than in newly weaned mice. the differences of pathogenesis and secondary structure formation may be explained by an immune response specific to the ferret or an age-specific window of requirements that were not matched to our study. ferrets are a superlative model for studying respiratory diseases. when infected with respiratory viruses, ferrets display many of the symptoms and pathological features seen in infected humans. the discovery of a mild disease model in newly weaned ferrets offers new insights into the immature and developing immune system. 86_24_13187__index.html (1.1KB, html)."}
