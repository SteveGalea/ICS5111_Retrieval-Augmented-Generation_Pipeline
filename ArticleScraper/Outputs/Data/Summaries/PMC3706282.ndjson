{"summary": "respiratory viruses were recovered in 14% of neutropenic patients prior to neutropenia. in 19% of neutropenic patients with fever, a respiratory virus was detected. nasal swabs performed significantly better (16/117 = 43%), than throat swabs (6/106 = 6%). PCR has enabled rapid and highly sensitive detection of a large number of respiratory viruses. in patients with hematological malignancies, PCR has shown to be far more sensitive than viral culture. this study was performed to assess the usefulness of screening for respiratory viruses before the onset of neutropenia. each patient\u2019s symptoms and signs during admission were registered on a case record form. all materials were analyzed by quantitative real time multiplex PCR covering the following viruses; influenzavirus A (InfA) and B (InfB), enterovirus (EV), adenovirus (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV) and human-metapneumovirus (hMPV) 66 41 38 Age (IQR5) 57 (49\u201364) 56 (38\u201364) 59 (50\u201365) Sex female (%) 34 (42%) 14 (30%) 24 (57%) Hematological disorder: AML (%) 36 (44%) 17 (37%) 23 (55%) CML (%) 3 (4%) 1 (2%) 2 (5%) ALL (%) 8 (10%) 3 (7%) 0 HL (%) 2 (2%) 0 2 (5%) NHL (%) 11 (14%) 7 (15%) 4 IQR Inter quartile range, AML Acute myeloid leukemia, CML Chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, HL Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL Non Hodgkin lymphoma. autoSCT autologous stem cell transplantation reduced intensity, regimen, alloSCT m.a.
