{"summary": "the outbreak is the largest ever recorded for the Ebola virus, both in terms of the number of cases and the number of fatalities. the death of a west african man afflicted with the disease in Dallas has worried many americans and prompted heightened airport security. the world's strategy for controlling the virus has been to develop strict containment protocols. the problem is not isolated to Ebola, but rather characteristic of a systemic, international approach to vaccine and drug development against infectious diseases that does not adequately protect the world\u2019s population. the problem is that companies bear the cost of producing the drugs that would also benefit citizens and governments. the risk pool for a disease should be limited only to those countries that are at greatest direct risk for primary epidemics. but in many cases the funding generated would be insufficient to meaningfully mitigate the cost of drug development. a second solution is that the sharing of risk should be encouraged regionally so that countries in close proximity to disease hotspots should be made parties to risk sharing even if they assess their own internal domestic risk to be quite low. the world health organization (WHO) is best suited to facilitate the formation and transactions of supranational risk pools because the national governments of WHO member states already communicate over joint funds. the operation protocols for each risk pool should be carefully devised and managed. grant monies should be allocated by countries in direct proportion to their projected risk. countries should be free to join several pools, one for each disease to which they are vulnerable, if they have the financial means to contribute to a grant fund. a company that enters into a contractual agreement with the members of a risk pool would be entitled to keep the intellectual property rights to any novel drugs or vaccines it produces. this is because for a set number of years after drug discovery, the company\u2019s ability to sell the drug at a protected price will provide it with substantial revenues. major western pharmaceutical companies have been scaling back investment in short-term profits, but this will eventually lead to shrinking pipelines. asian companies with more limited budgets, an eye toward innovation, and a desire to keep their positive growth track record of recent years may attempt to research these infectious diseases despite the inherent business risks. the sharing of risk should be encouraged regionally so that countries in close proximity to disease hotspots should be made parties to risk sharing even if they assess their own internal domestic risk to be quite low. a regional economic giant like Nigeria could have devoted some of its GDP toward a risk-sharing arrangement and should have done so. the world health organization (WHO) is best suited to facilitate the formation and transactions of supranational risk pools. the national governments of WHO member states already frequently communicate over joint funds. the operation protocols for each risk pool should be carefully devised and managed. economic theory predicts profit-seeking enterprises are motivated to respond to favorable long-term financial incentives. a company that enters into a contractual agreement with the members of a risk pool would be entitled to keep the intellectual property rights to any novel drugs or vaccines it produces. the risky prospect of investigating deadly infectious diseases may be unappealing for many companies. major western pharmaceutical companies have been scaling back investment in short-term profits. but this will eventually lead to shrinking pipelines. Asian companies may attempt to research these infectious diseases despite the inherent business risks. a lack of coordinated risk-sharing arrangements allows political gamesmanship to eclipse the needs of vulnerable populations. a lack of coordinated risk-sharing arrangements allows political gamesmanship to eclipse the needs of vulnerable populations in the midst of an epidemic. the proposal enables manufacturers to share their initial costs with governments, thereby increasing drug supplies. despite the innovative approach offered by this proposal, critics might contend that the efficacy of the program would be limited because many risk pools would fail to find suitable drug or vaccine candidates. the proposed system is complex, and there is no guarantee that every risk pool would partner with a company whose efforts will inevitably culminate in a worthy product. a risk pool of member states can be assembled for only 300 of those diseases. of those 300 risk pools, only 150 of those pools can agree on terms of a contractual grant that would be offered on an open index. some companies apply for only 100 of the 150 grants, and of those, only 50 result in actual grant contracts."}
