{"summary": "the length of the latent, noninfectious period was assumed to be 2 days (19), and the infectious period was assumed to be 4 days (19,21). hospitalization rates for the basline scenario were calculated by using data from interpandemic influenza. the baseline scenario for this study was advocated by WHO (3) and was also used previously by Meltzer et al. (18). this scenario assumes a clinical attack rate, in the absence of interventions, of 25% of the population, which occurs during a single wave. a value for the basic reproduction number, 1.39, can be calculated. a stockpile large enough to treat 12% of the population would be sufficient to treat all patients even if the clinical attack rate in the absence of treatment is 25%. this difference is due to a reduction in the effective reproduction number of the disease, R, caused by shortening the infectious period of those treated by 1.5 days. the effect of different treatment strategies on hospitalization rates was generated from the baseline scenario: treating all patients, only at-risk groups, only children and the elderly (1\u201314 and >65 years of age), and only the working population (15\u201364 years of age). the best option to minimize hospitalizations would be to treat all patients; for this scenario, a 12% antiviral coverage would reduce hospitalizations by up to 77%. the age-specific clinical attack rate has varied between pandemics. we scaled hospitalization rates to achieve an overall hospitalization rate of 188/100,000. the only additional change from the baseline scenario is the 1957 hospitalization rate. baseline 1957 1968 1918 1st wave 1918 2nd wave 1918 3rd wave Overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 population 138* 188 144 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Overall clinical attack rate, % 25 31 21 5 9% 4 Overall serologic attack rate, % 50 67 65 79 61 69 % immune at start of wave 0 0 15 0 0 0 R0 1.39 1.65 2.2 2.00 1.55 1.70 Case-fatality rate, % \u2013 the best strategy is to treat the young and elderly, which results in a 39% reduction from treating the working population. strategies with larger proportions of the 10% stockpile had the greatest effect on the epidemic, steadily delaying, but not diminishing, peak of hospitalizations. the overall hospitalization rate for the second wave was reported as 144 per 100,000 (29) the size of the stockpile required to treat all patients is 18%. the size of the stockpile required to treat all patients is relatively small compared to the 1957 pandemic because of the lower clinical attack rate. the effects of the different treatment strategies with a 10% stockpile are shown in Figure 4C. treating at-risk groups is the most efficient, but given surplus stockpile, further extension of the groups to be targeted may be considered. the characteristics for the 1918 pandemic differ substantially from the other 2 in that 3 distinct waves occurred. new tab Clinical cases per week estimated by using the clinical casefatality rates and weekly mortality statistics for the 1918 pandemic. a pandemic with the characteristics of that in 1918 would produce an estimated number of deaths equivalent to 0.5% of the population across all 3 waves. a 20% stockpile sufficient to treat all patients across the 3 waves would result in 53% reduction in deaths. treating all patients consistently fails to be the best strategy for reducing hospitalizations. treating all patients is consistently the best strategy in reducing hospitalizations. if all patients are treated, the marginal effect of treatment increases with the number of patients treated. LP represents the length of the latent period; PP represents the length of the nonsymptomatic infectious period. ci is the proportion of infections resulting in clinical cases, and Ti is the proportion of group i receiving treatment. IP represents the length of the infectious symptomatic period. S represents the total proportion susceptible, E the total proportion incubating. Ii the proportion of total population in each group i within the final 1.5 days of their infectious period."}
