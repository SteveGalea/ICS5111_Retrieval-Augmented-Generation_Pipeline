{"summary": "it has been estimated that approximately 165 million episodes of ALRI occur globally each year in children aged 0 to 4 years. viral ALRI alone has been described to account for an expenditure of approximately 2.4 billion dollars annually. etiological diagnosis of the infection is challenging in younger children. anyplex II RV16 (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, South Korea) is a qualitative multiplex PCR able to detect 16 targets, including AdV, BoV CoV types 229E/NL63/OC43, EV, IFV-A, IFV-B, MPV, PIV types 1 to 4, RSV types A/B, and RV (17). both NxTAG RPP and Anyplex II RV16 RUO are Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene (CE) a 345-bed teaching reference medical center provides health care services to a pediatric population of 200,000 subjects representing 18% of the total population of Catalonia within this age group. samples were aliquoted into two parts, frozen at 80\u00b0C, and thawed prior to testing. PCR and Sanger sequencing primers were designed not to overlap with primers used in the NxTAG RPP RUO panel. samples electrophoresis and sequence analysis were performed on the 3730xl Analyzer (Thermo-Fisher), using 3730xl data collection software (v3.1.1) and sequencing analysis software. NxTAG RPP RUO has combined EV and RV targets and Anyplex II RV16 detects them separately. EV and RV results for Anyplex II RV16 were pooled to allow a comparative analysis. sample batches were run two to three times a week to optimize the use of reagents. the first aliquot of each sample was routinely processed by Anyplex II RV16. the second aliquot was also tested by NxTAG RPP RUO. sample electrophoresis and sequence analysis were performed on the 3730xl Analyzer (Thermo-Fisher) using 3730xl data collection software (v3.1.1) and sequencing analysis software (v5.4). Sequences that were at least 200 bases in length, with a QV value 20 for at least 90% of the bases. 1, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were not evaluated. EV and RV results for Anyplex II RV16 were pooled to allow a comparative analysis. IFV-A subtype results for NxTAG RPP were grouped in a single category. agreement between Luminex NxTAG RPP RUO and Seegene Anyplex II RV16 testsa Target No. of tests % agreement (95% CI) Kappa coefficient (95% CI) RPP+ RVP+ RVP\u2013 RPP\u2013 RVP\u2013 PPA NPA Adenovirus 12 1 3 303 85.7 (68.5\u201394.3) 99.3 (98.3\u201399.4) 0.85 (0.71\u20130.99) Bocavirus 22 4 2 292 88.0 (7 parainfluenza virus 1 1 0 0 318 NA 100.0 (99.4\u2013100.0) 1.00 (1.00\u20131.00) 2 1 0 0 318 NA 100.0 (99.4\u2013100.0) 1.00 (1.00\u20131.00) 3 10 4 0 305 83.3 (64.2\u201393.3) 99.4 (98.3\u201399.8) 0.83 (0.66\u20130.99) 4 6 0 2 311 85.7 (60.1\u201396.0) 99.7 ( EV/RV (n = 105, 40.4%) was the most prevalent target, followed by RSV-B (n = 27, 10.4%), and BoV (n = 24, 9.2%) a total of 260 viruses were detected. 37 samples were coinfected by 2 viruses, and 7 contained more than 2 viruses.

EV/RV were the most prevalent targets (40.4%), but the detection rate was moderate for all PIV types (9.3%) and minor for AdV (5.4%). batched testing was carried out after we performed a freezing-defrosting cycle on the samples. however, we assume that the confounding effect of the freezing-defrosting steps on diagnostic accuracy was controlled."}
