{"summary": "new findings suggest previously unrecognized complexity in megakaryocyte biology in relation to the lungs. many studies in humans and laboratory animals demonstrate that megakaryocytes and platelets are present in vessels in the mammalian lung under basal conditions. infusion of mature megakaryocytes into mice resulted in accumulation of the cells in lung vessels. investigators unexpectedly identified immature and mature megakaryocytes in extravascular compartments of the lung, in addition to populations of hematopoietic progenitor cells. these progenitors can translocate from the lungs to the bone marrow and reconstitute platelet numbers under deficiency conditions. lung megakaryocytes may have other functions besides thrombopoiesis, including inflammatory effector activities and alveolar repair. a second unexplored possibility is that lung megakaryocytes have activities that contribute to pulmonary inflammation, injury, and repair independent of thrombopoiesis. inflammatory and immune effector activities of platelets have been cataloged and examined in detail in recent reviews. these effector activities are extensive, and in some cases they represent \u201cnew biology\u201d\u2014that is, newly discovered biologic capacities that were not previously known to be part of the functional repertoire of platelets. platelets and platelet\u2013leukocyte aggregates have recently been detected in mice with ALI on the basis of staining for CD41 (integrin subunit 2b; glycoprotein IIb) platelets can influence extravascular cells and events by releasing microparticles and soluble mediators with signaling activities. platelets can also influence extravascular cells and events by releasing microparticles and soluble mediators with signaling activities. the findings are consistent with the established importance of intercellular adhesion and signaling mediated by P-selectin and PSGL-1 in platelet\u2013leukocyte interactions. together, the experiments in this report suggested the primacy of neutrophils in interactions with platelets in inflammation and thromboinflammatory injury. platelet depletion reduced lung microvascular platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregate formation, neutrophils in BAL samples, and survival in a mouse model of Escherichia coli pneumonia (39). Activated platelets adhered to neutrophils via P-selectin interacting with PSGL-1; this facilitated the formation of neutrophil microparticles (microvesicles) in a platelet GPIb-dependent fashion. formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is a specific consequence of platelet\u2013neutrophil interaction that is of considerable topical interest. NETs are extracellular lattices of chromatin, histones, and granule constituents that are released by neutrophils in a process commonly termed NETosis. NETs mediate damage to lung cells in vitro and contribute to lung injury and dysfunction in vivo in experimental models (12, 44). Activated platelets trigger formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. formation of NETs may mediate capture and extracellular killing of bacteria and other pathogens. platelet-induced NET formation is also reported to contribute to TRALI (32, 58, 59) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (60) together, these observations indicate that platelet-induced NET formation contributes to some types of experimental ALI. evidence for platelet-mediated endothelial barrier destabilization has been generated in experiments with in vitro models. platelets contribute to maintenance of basal alveolar\u2013capillary barrier integrity, but also mediate vascular leak and increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability in acute lung injury. basal endothelial barrier function is impaired, leading to leakage of water and protein from microvessels. the mechanisms contributing to platelet-mediated endothelial barrier stabilization in lung and systemic vessels are incompletely defined and under active study. the complexity of platelet regulation of vascular barrier integrity is further illustrated by observations of hemorrhage in inflammation. signaling by platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and a member of the tyrosine-based activation motif immunoreceptor family, C-type lectin 2, was required to prevent inflammation-induced hemorrhage in the lungs and skin in mice (77, 78) platelets were reported to seal neutrophil-induced vascular defects via a GPVI-mediated mechanism in murine immune complex\u2013induced skin inflammation. thrombocytopenia is common in critically ill patients at risk for ARDS. complex mechanisms contribute to thrombocytopenia in ICU patients. complex mechanisms contribute to thrombocytopenia in patients. complex mechanisms contribute to thrombocytopenia in patients. platelets are inflammatory and immune effector cells in the Lungs and Other Organs. they can mediate each of the cardinal features of acute and chronic inflammation. platelets also have the biologic potential to influence multiple additional inflammatory and immune processes. interactions of platelets with myeloid leukocytes and endothelial cells are common and important effector functions of platelets (7). biologic consequences include localization of leukocytes and platelets at sites of inflammation and inflammatory injury, as well as complex intercellular signaling. both cell types accumulate in the lungs in experimental and clinical ALI. platelets can influence extravascular cells and events by releasing microparticles and soluble mediators with signaling activities. in a model of transfusion-related acute lung injury, sequestration of platelets in the lungs was dependent on neutrophils (32) polarized neutrophils projected uropods that were believed to \u201cscan\u201d for platelets in the bloodstream. platelet protease-activated receptor 4 cleavage by thrombin promoted leukocyte recruitment in a mechanism involving fibrin deposition and platelet surface proteins glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and P-selectin (34). chemokine stimulation was reported to induce murine platelets to adhere to distinct sites in systemic venules and to \u201ccapture\u201d neutrophils and a subset of monocytes via CD40-CD40L/CD154 thromboxane A2 (TXA2) secondarily induced endothelial activation and neutrophil intravascular \u201ccrawling\u201d and transmigration (39). this sort of daedal cellular cross-talk is consistent with the complexity of platelet interactions with leukocytes and endothelium that has been either demonstrated or suggested by many other investigations. NETs are extracellular lattices of chromatin, histones, and granule constituents released by neutrophils in a process commonly termed NETosis. NETs capture and, under some conditions, kill microbes and may be important in host defense. evolving experimental evidence has generated a general conclusion that inappropriate, or unregulated, NET formation is a mechanism of inflammatory vasculopathy and tissue injury. experimental and limited clinical observations indicate that NETs form in a dysregulated fashion. elastase, other granule enzymes, and histones can injure endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. NETs are also components of thrombi and may mediate alveolar capillary and pulmonary vascular thrombosis. platelets have complex influences on permeability of pulmonary and systemic vessels. increased alveolar\u2013capillary membrane permeability with leak of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid is a defining characteristic and central feature in the pathophysiology of ARDS. there is similar evidence that activated platelets are required for endothelial barrier integrity in the systemic circulation. some platelet mediators appear to have both permeability-reducing and permeability-enhancing properties, depending on the physiological context. platelets contribute to maintenance of basal alveolar\u2013capillary barrier integrity, but also mediate vascular leak and increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability in acute lung injury. esize and release soluble and microparticle-associated IL-1, a major agonist for increased endothelial permeability. alveolar hemorrhage and interstitial accumulation of RBCs are central features of early phases of ALI. thrombocytopenia contributes to nontraumatic hemorrhage in the skin, brain, and lungs under acute inflammatory conditions. platelets influence barrier function of lymphatic vessels in immune responses. physiologic lymphatic function is critical for prevention of alveolar flooding and clearance of pulmonary edema in inflammation and injury. platelets may also be involved in immune cell trafficking in lung lymphatic vessels. wei and colleagues found a SNP in the gene for a cytoskeletal scaffold protein that influences actin assembly and disassembly, LRRC16A. LRRC16A variants are associated with platelet number and with altered risk for ARDS. a portion of the association is via influence of LRRC16A on platelet number (90, 92) activated platelets were identified in blood samples from patients with ARDS caused by influenza A (94) these limited observations suggest that activities of platelets are altered in subjects with ALI, but correlation with key variables that influence the course of ARDS has not been done. the platelet transcriptome and proteome are dynamic and can change in clinical disorders. s of acute Lung Injury Model Major Platelet Activities Examined and/or Variables Influenced by Platelets Reference LPS-induced ALI (aerosolized) Lung neutrophil accumulation, increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability 66 LPS-induced ALI (intranasal) Alveolar\u2013capillary barrier function, inflammation-induced alveolar hemorrhage 77 LPS-induced ALI (intranasal) Leuk increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability 66 CLP Lung neutrophil accumulation, lung edema, alveolar inflammation by histologic score 118 Acid-induced ALI Increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability 32 Acid-induced ALI Lung endothelial cell activation, development of procoagulant lung endothelium 133 Acid-induced ALI Alveolar neutrophil accumulation, increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability. thrombocytopenia in mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia resulted in increased bacterial burdens in the lungs, blood, spleen, and liver. thrombocytopenia did not reduce intrapulmonary neutrophil accumulation or formation of NETs in this model. clopidogrel did not alter lung or systemic organ bacterial counts. platelets and neutrophils were reported to have complex molecular interactions that also involve the lung endothelium (Figure 2) in experimental E. coli pneumonia. experimental observations indicate platelets have complex activities in influenza infection and influenza-induced ALI. activation of protease-activated receptor 4 worsened ALI and increased mortality in infected animals. a second study indicated that H1N1 influenza activates platelets via a complex mechanism that includes the FcRIIA immunoreceptor and thrombin generation. it was suggested that interactions between influenza virus and platelets take place in the blood during viremia (106) activated platelets mediate aberrant hemostasis and maladaptive, \u201chyper\u201d inflammation by interacting with leukocytes and endothelial cells in severe influenza infection (110). ASA improved survival in the in vivo model described in this report, suggesting that antiplatelet therapy may be a useful adjunctive strategy in severe influenza (111). NETs (Figure 3) form in lung microvessels and in vessels in other organs in experimental sepsis. plasma cell\u2013free DNA, taken as a marker of NET formation, correlated with incidence and severity of ARDS in one study. platelets expressed spliced mRNA encoding TF and accelerated plasma clotting in a TF-dependent manner. spliced TF mRNA was absent and the unspliced, precursor pre-mRNA was present in platelets from healthy age-matched control subjects. splicing of TF pre-mRNA, generation of mature translatable mRNA, and generation of TF-dependent procoagulation activity in platelets from healthy age-matched subjects platelets, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and TXA2 mediated acid-induced ALI. intercellular signaling between platelets, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and endothelial cells was also detected in an E. coli pneumonia model. ASA-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) and its receptor were detected in injured lung tissue in a murine model of self-limited ALI. animals treated with AT-RvD1 had decreased numbers of platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates in right ventricular blood samples, partial alveolar\u2013capillary barrier stabilization, and improved lung mechanics. early transfusion of platelets was associated with increased risk for ARDS in patients with severe isolated traumatic brain injury (136) the mechanisms accounting for this intriguing observation are yet to be determined. it is not clear if the transfused platelets, underlying factor(s) contributing to the indications for platelet transfusion were the pathophysiologic culprits. platelets and platelet\u2013neutrophil interactions contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of TRALI. in vitro experiments in which NET formation and increased endothelial permeability were triggered by activated platelets and reduced by a TXA2 inhibitor. not all investigators agree on a requirement for platelets in experimental TRALI. malaria is transmitted in over 100 countries, and imported malaria in travelers and emigrants occurs with substantial frequency in Europe and North America. malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS) is most commonly caused by Plasmodium falciparum but can be caused by each of the five malarial parasites that infect humans. malaria-associated ALI (MA-ALI) and clinical malaria-associated ARDS (MA-ARDS) are vasculopathies with major accumulation of inflammatory effector cells in lung vessels. monocytes are major leukocyte subtypes found in histologic samples in malarial vasculopathies. platelets respond in complex and controversial ways to malarial infection (150, 151), and they are suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of MA-ARDS (146) the activities of platelets and their interactions with other immune effector cells have not been clearly defined in cerebral malaria, experimental MA-ALI, or clinical MA-ARDS. confounding factor in ultimately determining the contributions of platelets to clinical MA-ARDS is concomitant bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. plates from patients with dengue release IL-1 in microparticles that increase permeability of cultured endothelium. circulating platelets could contribute to alveolar and pleural vascular leak. coinfection with dengue and influenza A leading to severe, fatal ALI has also been reported. platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates in circulating blood, generation of NETs in lung microvessels, and sequestration of platelets in alveolar regions in which NETs were present. depletion of platelets reduced each of these variables and, in parallel, resulted in decreased neutrophil accumulation in lung, interstitial, and alveolar compartments. NETs did not seem to make a major contribution to VILI in experimental VILI. excessive fluid administration can worsen extravasation of fluid and protein across the leaky alveolar\u2013capillary membrane. increased pressure in venular capillaries in isolated, blood-perfused rat lungs induced surface P-selectin expression on endothelial cell\u2013 (167) and P-selectin\u2013dependent leukocyte accumulation in lung postcapillary venules. ity 66 LPS-induced ALI (intranasal) Alveolar\u2013capillary barrier function, inflammation-induced alveolar hemorrhage 77 LPS-induced ALI (intratracheal) Intraalveolar platelet sequestration, platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregate formation, increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability 43 LPS-induced ALI (intranasal) Leukocyte recruitment to the lungs 36-38 LPS-induced histologic score 118 Acid-induced ALI Increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability 32 Acid-induced ALI Lung neutrophil accumulation, increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability 66 Acid-induced ALI Lung endothelial cell activation, development of procoagulant lung endothelium 133 Acid-induced ALI Alveolar neutrophil accumulation, increased alveolar\u2013capillary permeability, alveolar inflammation by histologic score 65 TRALI platelets included induced or genetic thrombocytopenia, genetic alterations in platelet adhesion or signaling molecules, inhibition of platelet mediators, and/or administration of antiplatelet drugs or aspirin-triggered lipoxins. earlier observations suggested platelets have complex influences in ARDS and experimental ALI induced by \u201cdirect\u201d bacterial or viral infection. platelets have complex molecular interactions that also involve the lung endothelium (Figure 2) in experimental E. coli pneumonia (39) platelets have complex activities in influenza infection and influenza-induced ALI. experimental observations indicate that platelets have complex activities in influenza infection and influenza-induced ALI. activated receptor 4, a key platelet receptor for thrombin in mice, worsened ALI and increased mortality. observations in a second study indicated that H1N1 influenza activates platelets via a complex mechanism that includes the FcRIIA immunoreceptor and thrombin generation. it was suggested that interactions between influenza virus and platelets take place in the blood during viremia (106) cells by virus, resulting in adhesion of platelets, is suggested to be a mechanism in influenza-induced ALI on the basis of parallel in vitro studies of human lung microvascular endothelial cells and mice infected with H3N2 influenza A. ASA improved survival in the in vivo model described in this report, suggesting that antiplatelet therapy may be a useful adjunctive strategy in severe influenza (111). platelets and NETs were central in microvascular thrombin generation, fibrin deposition, and impaired microvascular perfusion. NETs, together with platelets, thrombin, and tissue factor, were critical in the disseminated thrombosis. spliced TF pre-mRNA was absent and the unspliced, precursor pre-mRNA was present in platelets from healthy age-matched control subjects. splicing of TF pre-mRNA, generation of mature translatable mRNA, and generation of TF-dependent procoagulation activity in platelets from healthy age-matched subjects studied in vitro. intercellular signaling between platelets, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and TXA2 was also detected in an E. coli pneumonia model (39) the findings indicated that intercellular signaling between platelets, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and endothelial cells involving TXA2 mediated acid-induced ALI. animals treated with AT-RvD1 had decreased numbers of platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates in right ventricular blood samples. the experiments were interpreted to indicate that AT-RvD1 reduced P-selectin\u2013dependent platelet\u2013neutrophil interactions and thereby ameliorated PMN-mediated alveolar damage in acid-induced ALI. platelets may contribute to complex pathophysiologic responses to trauma. platelets also sense and respond to DAMPs via their repertoire of surface TLRs. but it is unknown if platelet TLR9 is activated in trauma or trauma-induced ARDS. a mouse model involving inflammatory priming of the animals followed by infusion of antileukocyte antibodies has been widely employed in the field. it has revealed important insights into platelet\u2013neutrophil interactions, as well as insights into mechanisms of ALI. not all investigators agree on a requirement for platelets in experimental TRALI (58, 142) pathophysiology of MA-ARDS includes increased-permeability pulmonary edema and other features that are characteristic of more common causes of ARDS. animal models of malaria-associated acute lung injury (MA-ALI), particularly mice infected with rodent malarial strains, provide useful insights regarding lung involvement (146) MA-ARDS and experimental MA-ALI are vasculopathies with major accumulation of inflammatory effector cells in lung vessels. monocytes are major leukocyte subtypes found in histologic samples in malarial vasculopathies, in contrast to ALI and ARDS. lymphocytes may be key effectors of alveolar injury on the basis of observations in models of another major complication of severe malaria, malarial cerebral edema. platelets sequester in the lungs in murine MA-ALI caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (152) CD40 and CD40L, which are important immune modulators in platelet biology (12, 29, 35), may be central in this experimental model (146, 153) there is evidence that platelets are important in the inflammatory vasculopathy of cerebral malaria (15, 114), another major condition in the spectrum of severe malaria (143). dengue virus in vitro releases IL-1 in microparticles that increase permeability of cultured endothelium (157) circulating platelets could contribute to alveolar and pleural vascular leak in this infection. coinfection with dengue and influenza A leading to severe, fatal ALI has also been reported. platelet chemokines and neutrophil MAC1 (integrin M2) mediated platelet\u2013neutrophil interaction, NET formation, and ALI in experimental VILI. hyperoxia induces pulmonary platelet sequestration and platelet-fibrin thrombi formation, is a classic cause of DAD and may accelerate the progression of ARDS. olar responses to hydrostatic stresses, increased pressure in venular capillaries in isolated, blood-perfused rat lungs induced surface P-selectin expression on endothelial cell\u2013 (167) and P-selectin\u2013dependent leukocyte accumulation in lung postcapillary venules. findings suggest a potential mechanism for platelet accumulation and alveolar thromboinflammation resulting from excessive fluid administration. thrombocytopenia in mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia resulted in reduced survival; higher bacterial loads in the lungs, blood, and spleen; and altered plasma cytokine concentrations (102). Interestingly, the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel did not alter lung or systemic organ bacterial counts, although it reduced tail bleeding times. integrin IIb3, an IIb3 antagonist, and pharmacologic inhibitors of platelet activation each reduced histologic markers of ALI and mortality in infected animals. activation of protease-activated receptor 4, a key platelet receptor for thrombin in mice, worsened ALI and increased mortality in infected animals. platelets mediate aberrant hemostasis and maladaptive, \u201chyper\u201d inflammation. infection of lung endothelial cells by virus, resulting in adhesion of platelets, is suggested to be a mechanism in influenza-induced ALI. ASA improved survival in the in vivo model described in this report. platelets contribute to dysregulated host responses in sepsis. NETs form in lung microvessels and in vessels in other organs in experimental sepsis. plasma DNA correlated with incidence and severity of ARDS. platelets from patients with sepsis expressed spliced mRNA encoding TF and accelerated plasma clotting in a TF-dependent manner. spliced TF mRNA was absent and the unspliced, precursor pre-mRNA was present in platelets from healthy age-matched control subjects (127). septic ARDS may alter the transcriptional profiles of megakaryocytes (97), thereby inducing changes in the transcriptome and proteome intratracheal challenge of mice with 0.1 M HCl caused lung neutrophil accumulation, pulmonary edema, and intraalveolar release of neutrophil elastase. platelet-specific CXCL4 and CXCL7 were reported to mediate acid-induced ALI in a complementary fashion that induced neutrophil accumulation. altered chemokine expression revealed differential effects of ASA-induced mediators in lung inflammation. ASA-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) and its receptor were detected in injured lung tissue in a murine model of self-limited ALI. animals treated with AT-RvD1 had decreased numbers of platelet\u2013neutrophil aggregates in right ventricular blood samples. induced ALI and TRALI Platelets are critical in hemostatic responses to penetrating and blunt trauma (134) they also have biologic activities that may influence subsequent clinical phenotypes and complications, including the development of trauma-induced ARDS (135). AMPs via their repertoire of surface TLRs, including TLR9. it is unknown if platelet TLR9 is activated by DAMPs in trauma or trauma-induced ARDS. TRALI is a potential complication of transfusion of plasma-containing blood products in trauma and surgery. malaria is transmitted in over 100 countries, and imported malaria in travelers and emigrants occurs with substantial frequency in Europe and North America. the pathophysiology of MA-ARDS includes increased-permeability pulmonary edema and other features that are characteristic of more common causes of ARDS (144\u2013146) platelets may be central in experimental malaria-associated ALI (MA-ALI) and clinical malaria-associated ARDS (MA-ARDS) one of the sequelae of severe malaria is a syndrome of increased permeability pulmonary edema and other pathophysiologic features. platelets respond in complex and controversial ways to malarial infection (150, 151), and they are suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of MA-ARDS (146) platelets sequester in the lungs in murine MA-ALI caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (152) platelets are important in the inflammatory vasculopathy of cerebral malaria (15, 114), another major condition in the spectrum of severe malaria (143) plaquelets from dengue release IL-1 in microparticles that increase permeability of cultured endothelium (157) circulating platelets could contribute to alveolar and pleural vascular leak in this infection. coinfection with dengue and influenza A leading to severe, fatal ALI has also been reported. platelets transfer proadhesive factors to endothelium in high-Vt ventilation. depletion of platelets reduced each of these variables and resulted in decreased neutrophil accumulation in lung, interstitial, and alveolar compartments. c-mpl/ mice with genetic thrombocytopenia were challenged with hyperoxia (32) excessive fluid administration resulting in increased lung microvascular pressure can worsen extravasation of fluid and protein across the leaky alveolar\u2013capillary membrane. increased pressure in venular capillaries in isolated, blood-perfused rat lungs induced surface P-selectin expression on endothelial cell\u2013 (167) and P-selectin\u2013dependent leukocyte accumulation in ASA as a preventative agent, the LIPS-A (Lung Injury Prevention with Aspirin) trial, was subsequently completed and had negative results (180) there are a number of potential reasons for a lack of effect of ASA in this trial, including timing of administration and dosing of the drug, which are ubiquitous issues in clinical and experimental studies. 184, 185 studies suggest there may be major defects in the therapeutic profile of ASA administered as a single agent to interrupt inflammatory events that are critical to the pathogenesis of ARDS. however, 7 days of low- or high-dose ASA pretreatment reduced indices of alveolar inflammation in volunteers subjected to low-intensity LPS inhalation challenge. ASA alone inhibits some components of acute lung inflammation in humans and human tissues under some conditions. new genetic observations indicate that platelet numbers influence the natural history and outcomes in ARDS. the number, function, and characteristics, including \u201cnew\u201d biologic features such as the transcriptome, protein synthetic potential, and malleable proteome, remain undefined. new discoveries of the lungs as sites of regulated thrombopoiesis have not yet been plumbed in conditions of acute lung injury and inflammation. thrombopoiesis in ALI, ARDS, and other critical illnesses. what are the functional characteristics of circulating platelets in common subphenotypes of ARDS. what are the pivotal molecular consequences of platelets? platelets have traditional and more recently discovered biologic activities that confer broad functions in host defense. they establish them as effector cells in thrombosis, vascular barrier dysregulation, and complex inflammatory responses. new genetic observations indicate that platelet numbers influence the natural history and outcomes in ARDS, suggesting the possibility that platelet function and phenotype may have similar influences. what is the role of the lung in regulating thrombopoiesis in ALI, ARDS, and other critical illnesses. what are the functional characteristics of circulating platelets in common and uncommon subphenotypes of ARDS. what are the pivotal molecular consequences of platelets. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; MA-ARDS = malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. authors thank Kendra Richardson for invaluable efforts in preparation of manuscript."}
