{"summary": "the main symptoms of HFMD are vesicles on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet, buccal mucosa, tongue, and buttocks. the main symptoms include acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, myocarditis, and encephalitis, sometimes accompanied by death in young children. some small DNA viruses encode proteins that promote the entrance of cells into the S phase by using host polymerase. other large DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, can induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. cyclin A and cyclin E then combine, mainly with CDK 2, to promote S-phase progression. some viruses have been reported to regulate cell cycle progression by manipulating cyclin and CDK progression. the potential effect of EV71 is unknown. RD cells were mock-infected (mock) or infected with EV71 (infected) at an MOI of 1. at 30 h post-infection, cells were collected and the cell cycle profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry. EV71 infection prevents cell re-entry into the G2/M phase. RD cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then mock-infected for 2 h. after 2 h of virus adsorption, medium containing 10% FBS was added to the cells. RD cells were mock-infected (mock) or infected with EV71 at an MOI of 1. at 8 h post-infection, cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole (noco) and cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry at 16 h. RD cells were mock-infected (mock) or infected with EV71 at an MOI of 1 (infected) at 8 h post-infection, cells were treated with 2 M pseudolaric acid B (PAB) cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry at 16 h post-treatment. cells were treated with 25 ng/mL of nocodazole (noco) at 8 h post-infection. cell-cycle profiles were tested by flow cytometry at 16 h post-treatment. results indicate mean S.D of one experiment. EV71 RNA levels in S-phase synchronized cells were significantly higher than those in control cells. RD cells were infected with EV71 at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h and then treated with 0.85mM thymidine for synchronization in (A), (B), and (C) RD cells were pretreated with 0.85 mM thymidine for 18 h, infected with EV71 virus for 2 h without thymidine, and then re-treated with 0.85 mM thymidine to maintain S phase. at 6 h post-infection, intracellular EV71 RNA levels were detected in control medium (Con) or thymidine (S) containing medium-treated RD cells. TCID50 of the phase synchronized cell supernatant was obviously lower than that of the control group at 32 h post-infection. these results verify that S-phase arrest induces EV71 replication. both G0/G1 and G2/M arrest inhibit EV71 replication. mRNA levels of cyclin E1, cyclin A2 and CDK 2 were detected in mock-infected (Con) and EV71 infected (EV71) cells by real-time quantitative PCR. the results indicate the mean S.D of one experiment and are representative of 3 independent experiments. EV71 infection apparently alters the post-translational modification of these proteins. the non-structural protein 3D of EV71 mediates S-phase arrest. initial studies verified that EV71 also caused S-phase arrest in Hep G2 cells. cyclin E1, phosphorylated CDK2 T14, and phosphorylated CDK2 T160 were found in 3D-transfected cells at 36 h post-transfection. the non-structural protein 3D may be responsible for the S-phase arrest caused by EV71. histograms were analyzed by the ModFit LT program to determine the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. the results indicate the mean S.D of one experiment. the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined at different time points for the mock-infected cells. the results indicate the mean S.D of one experiment and are representative of 3 independent experiments.

EV71 RNA levels in S-phase synchronized cells were significantly higher than those in control cells at 32 h post-infection. the results suggest that S-phase arrest promotes EV71 viral replication. RD cells were infected with EV71 at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h. intracellular EV71 RNA levels were detected in control medium (Con) or thymidine (S) containing medium-treated RD cells by real-time quantitative PCR. results indicate mean S.D of one experiment and are representative of 3 independent experiments.
