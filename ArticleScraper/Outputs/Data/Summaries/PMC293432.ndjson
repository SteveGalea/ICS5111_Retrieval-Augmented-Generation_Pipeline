{"summary": "Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has claimed 349 lives. 5,327 probable cases reported in mainland china since November 2002. air pollution was evaluated by air pollution index. sex ratio, age distribution, socioeconomic level, availability of health facilities might be responsible for the geographical difference. air pollution has been linked to acute respiratory inflammation, asthma attack, COPD exacerbation, and death from cardiorespiratory diseases. a linear model was fitted to the data among five regions with 100 cases or more. the cut-off points were 75 and 100 API. cases fatalities of patients from regions with high APIs were compared to those of patients from regions with moderate APIs. 104 cases were 3.84%, 5.36%, 5.58%, 7.66% and 8% respectively. the correlation coefficient between air pollution index and SARS fatality was 0.8568 (p = 0.0636). 67 out of 1,572 patients from regions with low APIs died from SARS. 35 out of 363 from regions with moderate APIs and 247 out of 3,392 from regions with high APIs died from SARS. the corresponding fatalities were 4.26%, 9.64% and 7.28%. each 10 micrograms/m3 elevation in PM10 accounted for 6% of increased risk of cardiopulmonary mortality. exposure to PM10 was also linked to asthma and bronchitis. this study was subject to several limitations. study demonstrated a positive association between levels of air pollution and SARS case fatality in Chinese population by analyzing SARS data and air pollution indices. the interpretation of this association remains uncertain but the possibility of a detrimental effect on the prognosis of SARS patients deserves further investigation.
