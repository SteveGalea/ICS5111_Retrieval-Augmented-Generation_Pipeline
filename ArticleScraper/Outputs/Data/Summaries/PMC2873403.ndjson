{"summary": "a retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. 45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV. in 2003, a son of canada's index SARS case was admitted to a hospital in Toronto with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. over the next three months, infection would be transmitted to 375 persons in Toronto, 271 (72%) of whom acquired their infections in health care settings. a seroprevalence study was part of the public health investigation. HCWs provided consent for blood samples. no IRB approval was required as interviews occurred as part of the public health outbreak investigation. PCR for SARS-CoV included nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum/endotracheal secretions, conjunctival swabs, stool, urine and, if possible, bronchoalveolar lavage and post-mortem lung and other tissue samples. patients were classified as laboratory confirmed, probable, unclassifiable or not a case of SARS-associated coron symptomatic HCWs were classified as SARS if they had antibodies to SARS-CoV detected in their convalescent serum. participants were asked to submit a convalescent serum sample for SARS-CoV antibody testing. they were classified as not having SARS if they had negative serology or did not have serology done. a secondary analysis included probable and laboratory confirmed SARS patients and all infected HCWs. the primary analysis included probable and laboratory confirmed SARS patients and all infected HCWs. a standardized data collection form was used for chart review. a structured questionnaire was administered to HCWs through a face-to-face interview or by telephone interview if a respondent was in quarantine or had left their job. an eligible shift was defined as one in which a HCW provided care for one patient during that patient's defined exposure period. for each shift, questions were asked about the number of room entries, cumulative time spent in a patient room, and type and duration of contact with a patient. infection control training was categorized as active (face-to-face teaching) or passive (written instructions only) participants were asked whether they had received SARS-specific infection control training prior to their eligible shift. exposure incidents that occurred during the eligible shift were recorded. covariates which had a p value 0.10 in univariate GEE logistic regression models were considered as candidates for entry into the multivariable GEE model. study was approved by the IRB of each hospital where patients were treated. identifying and classification of patients and HCWs Patients SARS patients requiring intubation were identified by reviewing outbreak line lists from the province of Ontario, local public health units, and hospitals. clinical criteria included fever >38\u00b0C, one or more respiratory symptoms, radiological evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. patients were classified as not having SARS if antibodies to SARS-CoV could not be detected in serum obtained more than 28 days after symptom onset. patients were classified as not having SARS if antibodies to SARS-CoV could not be detected in serum obtained more than 28 days after symptom onset. for symptomatic HCWs, we recorded potential exposures in the period from 24 hours to 12 days before onset of illness. a high risk exposure to SARS was defined as being in the same room as or involved in transport of a SARS patient during the 24 hours prior to the patient requiring intubation. a secondary analysis included probable and laboratory confirmed SARS patients and all infected HCWs. all patients in whom SARS was suspected had multiple clinical specimens tested by culture and PCR for SARS-CoV. patients were classified as laboratory confirmed, probable, unclassifiable or not a case of SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV) disease based on laboratory testing. if possible, acute and convalescent serum were also obtained. ation until 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. they were identified by review of patient charts, work schedules, assignments and on-call schedules. participants were asked to submit a convalescent serum sample for SARS-CoV antibody testing. primary analysis was restricted to patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS. a secondary analysis included probable and laboratory confirmed SARS patients and all infected HCWs. standardized data collection form was used for chart review. an eligible shift was defined as one in which a HCW provided care for one patient during that patient's defined exposure period. a structured questionnaire was administered to HCWs through a face-to-face interview or by telephone interview if a respondent was in quarantine or had left their job. participants were asked whether they had received SARS-specific infection control training prior to their eligible shift. infection control training was categorized as active (face-to-face teaching) or passive (written instructions only) exposure incidents that occurred during the eligible shift were recorded, including needle stick injuries. intubations were classified as difficult if more than one attempt was required, if fiber optic visualization or any adjuvant device for difficult airway was required, or if the patient was combative. intubations were considered experienced if they had more than three years of experience and performed more than one intubation per month. questions were asked about the number of room entries, cumulative time spent in a patient room, and type and duration of contact with a patient. we also assessed level of involvement (performed, assisted or observed) in and the amount of time the HCW spent in the patient's room. s and interquartile ranges were compared between patients who did and did not transmit SARS-CoV and between HCWs who did and did not develop SARS. chi square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables. 111 HCWs were involved in the care of more than one intubated SARS patient. of the 624 participating HCWs, 26 contracted SARS; all survived and none required intubation. transmission to 22 HCWs could be definitively attributed to a single patient, with 6 patients transmitting to 1, 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 HCWs respectively. s who contracted SARS were more likely to be paramedics (p.01) and had less infection control training (p.009) than other workers (Table 2). they were more likely to have participated in administering non-invasive ventilation (p0.01) and performed ECGs (p0.01), fiber optic intubation (p0.01) or manual ventilation before intubation (p0.01) than HCWs who did not develop SARS (Table 3). 0.43b 19 (42%) Patient Characteristics at

of 26 HCWs who acquired SARS were involved in the care of one of these four patients. single patient with P/F ratio 35.5 was the patient who was the first splitting variable in the CART analysis with individual patients included. in univariate GEE models, patient characteristics associated with transmitting SARS-CoV were: P/F ratio 59, gender, death due to SARS, APACHE II score 20. the strongest predictor of SARS transmission from patient to health care worker was whether the patient under care was a \u201csuperspreader\u201d twenty-three of the 26 HCWs who became infected with SARS were infected by four of 45 patients. the presence of heterogeneity in transmission makes the interpretation of observational cohort data difficult. our findings are similar to those of other studies assessing HCW risks unadjusted for patient factors. absence of eye protection is a marker for reduced adherence to precautionary measures. a relatively small amount of education was associated with significant increases in adherence to precautions and reductions in infection. there are several limitations to this study. the superspreader effect was confounded with the P/F ratio effect. it is not possible to conclude that low patient P/F ratio is associated with SARS-CoV transmission. research into the incidence and risk factors for influenza transmission is urgently needed. doc)."}
