{"summary": "recombinant EBV containing a conditional EBNA3C gene is able to cause B-cell transformation only when transcomplemented for wild-type EBNA3C either in cis or trans. EBNA3C amino acids 343-545 were found to be essential for co-activation in both reporter systems designed to test p300 function. EBNA3C uses a SUMO interaction motif (SIM) (aa 507-513) to interact with SUMO-1 and SUMO-3. co-activation with EBNA2 is lost with mutations of the SIM (eg. m2, 509 DVIEVID 515AVIAVIA) that prevent SUMO binding, and with larger deletions (eg. 343-545) that remove the central portion of the protein including the SIM. EBNA3C interacts with EBNA3C in a manner that depends on EBNA3C interaction with EBNA2. EBNA3C's interaction with Gadd34 may therefore sustain LMP1 promoter activation in latency III infection. psg5-Flag-Gadd34 1-674, 180-674, 180-610 and 180-483 were provided by M Brush and S Shenolikar, Duke University. antibodies anti-human Gadd34(ab9869), anti-XBP1 (ab37152), anti-Laminin B (ab16048), and anti-eIF2 (ab5369) antibodies were purchased from abcam. microcystin pulldowns and Co-immunoprecipitation 4 million BJAB or BJAB-E3C cells were collected and lysed in 1 mL buffer containing 0.5% NP-140, 150 mM NaCl. 15 million IB4 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for 30 minutes. protein-G-Sepharose or Protein-G sepharose with A10 antibody were added to lysates which were incubated with rotation at 4 degrees overnight. after IP, proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and Gadd34 detected using C-20 antibody. each transfection contained 5 ug of -512/+72 LMP1-Luc plasmid and 5 ug pgk-B-Galactosidase plasmid. cells were treated with Thapsigargin (0.5 M) to induce ER stress and activate the UPR. cells were then transferred to medium containing either 4 HT or DMSO. pAS EBNA3C aa365-545-M2 was constructed by subcloning the SpeI/AatII fragment from psg-5 EBNA3C-M2 into pAS-1 EBNA3C aa365-545-M2. antibodies anti-human Gadd34(ab9869), anti-XBP1 (ab37152), anti-Laminin B (ab16048), and anti-eIF2 ( two cycles of liquid culture amplification and restreaking SD yielded a mixture of blue and white colonies. blue colonies were picked and yeast minipreps performed, followed by transformation of DH5 MAX Efficiency cells (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) cDNAs were identified by PCR across the pACT MCS. unique cDNAs were then retested by retransformation into AH109 cells. microcystin pulldowns and Co-immunoprecipitation 4 million BJAB or BJAB-E3C cells were collected. protein-G-Sepharose or Protein-G sepharose with A10 antibody were added to lysates which were incubated with rotation at 4 degrees overnight. each transfection contained 5 ug of -512/+72 LMP1-Luc plasmid and 5 ug pgk-B-Galactosidase plasmid as a normalization control. cells were treated with Thapsigargin (0.5 M) to induce ER stress and activate the UPR. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. wild type EBNA3C aa365-545 interacted with SUMO-3. interaction was lost when the m2 mutant was tested. EBNA3C aa365-545 interacted with Gadd34 aa395-674. a cDNA encoding full length RBP-J-Kappa was tested against pACT-Gadd34 aa395-674. aa365-545 interaction with EBNA3C depends on the SUMO interaction motif. EBNA3C interaction with Gadd34 requires Gadd34 amino acids 483-610. both full length Gadd34(1-674) and an N-terminal truncation mutant (180-674) interacted with EBNA3C (lanes 3 and 4). interaction was enhanced with further deletion of Gadd34 amino acids 611-674 (lane 5), however interaction was lost when Gadd34 aa180-483 was tested. psg5-EBNA3C was immune precipitated from RIPA lysates. EBNA3C co-purifies with Gadd34 by microcystin pulldown. the lymphoblastoid cell line IB4 contains integrated copies of the EBV B95-8 genome. microcystin sepharose was applied to whole-cell lysates from BJAB cells. it failed to immune precipitate EBNA3C from wild-type BJABs. however when microcystin sepharose was applied to BJABs stably expressing EBNA3C, a small amount, representing approximately 3-5% of input EBNA3C, co-precipitated (lane 4). the reporter chosen was -512/+72 of the LMP-1 promoter fused to luciferase. this region of the LMP1 promoter also includes an ER stress response element (ERSE) located at position -146 relative to the transcriptional start site. this region of the promoter also includes an ER stress response element (ERSE) located at position -146 relative to the transcriptional start site. a 2-2.5 fold potentiation of EBNA3C promoter activity was again observed with both the KVRF and RARA mutants (lane 2 versus lanes 5, 6 and 7) these data suggest that enhancement of EBNA3C activity by Gadd34 does not depend on association with PP1a. each Gadd34 plasmid was titrated to determine stochiometry effects on EBNA3C. psg5-EBNA3C expression plasmids were transfected at 0.1, 1.0 or 10.0 g of DNA. EBNA3C expression increased LMP-1 promoter activity levels. a cell line (LCL-19-9) in which EBNA3C expression is controlled by hydroxytamoxifen. a significant difference in serine 51 phosphorylation was observed. cells were treated with either DMSO \"C\" or 0.5 M Thapsigargin \"Tg\" an antibody that detects only full length, uncleaved ATF6 (90 KDa) was used. EBNA3C protects against thapsigargin induced endoplasmic reticulum stress ER stress results in the endonucleolytic cleavage. xBP1 protein was present in unspliced form in control cells growing expressing EBNA3C-HT. XBP1(u) protein was detectable in LCLs lacking EBNA3C-HT expression. no XBP1(u) protein was detectable in LCLs exposed to EBNA3C-HT. aa365-545 containing the m1 and m2 interact very weakly with SUMO-1 and fail to interact with SUMO-3[1]. wild type EBNA3C aa365-545 but not the m2 mutant, interacted with SUMO-3. pAS1-EBNA3C (1-992), pAS-WT EBNA3C (1-992), pAS-WT EBNA3C (aa365-545) or with the SIM (M2) mutant (aa365-545, 509DVIEVID515509AVIAVIA515) were tested for interaction with pACT-Gadd34 aa395-674. a cDNA encoding full length RBP-J-Kapp 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding either EBNA3C alone (lane 1), flag-tagged full length Gadd34 alone (lane 2), both full length EBNA3C and Flag-tagged-Gadd34 (lane 3) or combinations of EBNA3C and the indicated Gadd34 constructs as indicated (lanes 4-6). both full length Gadd34(1-674), as well as an N-terminal truncation mutant (180-674) interacted a combination of EBNA3C and the indicated Gadd34 mutants were transfected. total DNA was 1.0 g for each transfection. cells were lysed in isotonic buffer containing 0.5% NP-40. EBNA3C (A10) sera (PG/anti-EBNA3C) proteins were western blotted for Gadd34 (SC-H193). lysates and beads were rotated for 1 hr at 4 degrees, extensively washed with PBS, and affinity purified proteins western blotted for the presence of EBNA3C (E3C) and microcystin sepharose failed to immune precipitate EBNA3C from wild-type B cyclic heptapeptides synthesized by blue-green algae covalently link to catalytic subunits of protein phosphotases PP1 and PP2a. the data indicate that both EBNA3C and Gadd34 reside in protein phosphotase complexes in B cells. the reporter chosen was -512/+72 of the LMP-1 promoter fused to luciferase, which contains two RBP-J-K full length Gadd34 (aa 1-674, lane 5) and Gadd34 180-610 (lane 3) were equally effective in cooperating with EBNA3C. full length Gadd34 had no effect on basal LMP1 reporter activity or EBNA2 activity in the absence of EBNA3C. reporter activation observed with EBNA2 alone is normalized to 1 (lane 1). values are averages of duplicate observations in each experiment (repeated 3 times) plus standard error. each plasmid was titrated to determine stochiometry effects on EBNA3C. EBNA3C expression is associated with eIF2a serine 51 phosphorylation. a dominant negative effect on EBNA3C activity was observed with overexpression of a mutant that cannot bind EBNA3C. western blots were prepared and blotted for indicated proteins. whole-cell lysates against EBNA3C (top row), serine 51 phosphorylated eIF2 (second row), total eIF2 (third row) and -actin loading control (fourth row) cells were also treated with either DMSO \"C\" or 0.5 M Thapsigargin \"Tg\" XBP1(s) and cleaved ATF6 activate distinct and overlapping sets of proteins important for resolution of ER stress during the UPR. Thapsigargin induces ER stress by inactivating the ER Ca2+ ATPase resulting in depletion of Ca2+ from the luminal ER, and dysfunction of Ca dependant ER proteins such as calnexin. sigargin resulted in a modest decrease in full-length, 90 KDa form of ATF6 in cells growing in the presence of EBNA3C-HT. in the absence of EBNA3C-HT, the 90 KDa form of ATF6 was undetectable (lane 4). a yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted to reveal further EBNA3C interacting proteins. EBNA3C would not be expected to interact with Gadd34, a cytosolic and ER-associated protein. gene studies have proven a role for EBNA3C in maintaining growth of EBV transformed B-lymphocytes, but it is unknown at present whether nuclear localization of EBNA3C per se, is required for EBV immortalization. at least two ER stress inducible elements have been described. the first at position -41 relative to the transcriptional start site of the LMP1 gene is responsible for both EBNA2 dependant and EBNA2 independent activation in reporter assays. EBNA3C's protective effects in LCLs appear similar to effects of the chemical Salubrinal on LCLs. the chemical has the effect of maintaining low levels of serine 51 phosphorylated eIF2 while preventing downstream events of the UPR. eIF2a is also phosphorylated, resulting in a decrease in translation of host mRNAs. EBNA3C is associated with a switch in translation from cellular to viral and oncogenic proteins. Gadd34, PP1a and EBNA3C reside in a complex in burkitt's lymphoma cells converted to permanent EBNA3C expression. further studies are needed to determine if EBNA3C is associated with a switch in translation from cellular to viral and oncogenic proteins. EBNA3C effects on transcriptional co-activation with EBNA2 may be separable from effects on the UPR. phosphotases are notoriously unstable in cells. both pathways of kinase activation occur during viral infection. EBNA3C expression had the opposite effect, increasing rather than decreasing eIF2a phosphorylation. the protein accelerates and maintains the dephosphorylated state of eIF2 to ensure ongoing translation of viral mRNAs [23]."}
