{"summary": "EBOV is a biosafety level\u20134 pathogen transmitted by contact with bodily fluids, fomites, or droplets from infected patients. accelerated efforts in the development of therapeutics is a key objective in the EBOV research community. the off-label use of FDA-approved drugs is particularly advantageous as safety concerns and ethical problems have already been addressed. classical methods evaluate drug efficacy include the reduction of virus yield [15] or a decrease in viral RNA transcription as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) recent therapeutic screening methods have transitioned from the classical methods of measuring viral inhibition to assays with the ability to be automated. growing interest in identifying drugs with activity against EBOV has resulted in a variety of assays and readouts for activity as well as cytotoxicity. the resulting data sets indicated just how variable the EC50 value can be under different assay conditions. the data presented here provides insight on how different assay parameters can impact the in vitro efficacy of potential anti-EBOV antivirals using toremifene citrate. cell cultures were required to be a least 85% viable in order to achieve acceptance criteria and to be plated for use in a screening assay. PBMCs were isolated from human whole blood by density-gradient centrifugation over Histopaque (1.077 g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis. MO) cytopathic effect was visible at day 5\u20137 after infection. cell culture supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation. titers were measured using 10-fold serial dilutions of culture supernatant in triplicate infections of vero E6 cell monolayers in 6-well plates. EBOV/Mak isolate was diluted in culture media to the specified MOIs in 96-well plates. cells were then infected by transferring 50 l of EBOV/Mak isolate to cell plates using the 96-well liquidator. plates were fixed by adding 200 l of 20% neutral-buffered formalin (final concentration 10%) chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELIA) was performed by detecting EBOV with the anti-EBOV VP40 antibody followed by staining with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (SeraCare, Milford, MA, cat. #074\u20131802) assay plates were fixed at 10% NBF for 24 h before transferring to a BSL-2 lab for staining. cells and media were prepared in 100 l/well cell plates and incubated overnight. chemiluminescence assay was performed afterwards. Luminescence was read on the Infinite\u00ae M1000 Tecan plate reader. Statistical analysis Non-linear regression analysis and curve fitting parameter were performed to calculate EC50s, EC90s and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50s) error bars of dose-response curves represent the standard deviation of three replicates. a primary cell culture culture was grown to 90% confluency in a T-175 (Fisher Scientific) or triple layer tissue culture flask (Nunc) containing Dulbecco\u2019s modification of Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) cell lines were provided at passages 4\u201322, at which point a new culture was introduced and the previous passage series was ended. titers were measured using 10-fold serial dilution of culture supernatant in triplicate infections of vero E6 cell monolayers in 6-well plates. plated on desired 96-well plates 1 day prior to assay initiation. titers were measured in plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) all procedures using live EBOV were performed under biosafety level-4 conditions. vero E6 and Huh 7 cells were seeded overnight at 3 to 4 104 cells per well. fluorescence was quantified using a Tecan plate reader (Infinite\u00ae M1000, Tecan US, Morrisville, NC) or an high-content imaging (HCI) system (Operetta, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) the viability of the cell layer was monitored by staining cell nuclei with the Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. dilution achieved a desired compound concentration in 200 l of cell culture media. three plates were set up per experiment, two plates for detecting inhibition of EBOV, and one mock plate for determining drug cytotoxicity. at 48, 72 or 96 hpi, assay plates were fixed at final concentration of 10% NBF for 24 h before transferring to a BSL-2 lab for staining. the HCI system (Operetta) is used to detect EBOV-positive cells. in parallel, cytotoxicity assays (CellTiter Glo) with mock infected cells are performed at BSL-2. vero E6, Huh 7 and MDM cells were infected with EBOV/Mak isolate at 8 different MOIs. the assay was terminated after 24, 48, 72 or 96 hpi. vero E6 (A, B), Huh 7 (C, D) and MDM (E, F) cells were infected with EBOV/Mak at a range of MOIs. the assay endpoints were 24, 48, 72 or 96 hpi. the fluorescence S/N ratio was calculated using a Tecan plate reader. the percentage of EBOV-positive cells should be kept within a range of 10 to 80% and the S/N ratio at 4 to 10. at lower S/N ratios (4) or lower percentage of infected cells (10%) distinguishing activity of a drug from non-activity becomes increasingly difficult. a EBOV/Makona isolate was used for the virus inoculum. the percentage of EBOV-positive cells was determined with a VP40/Alexa-594 antibody stain to detect EBOV and a nuclear stain to quantify the number of cells in a high-content imaging system. the percentage of EBOV-positive cells was determined with a VP40/Alexa-594 antibody stain to detect EBOV. d S/N is the ratio of the fluorescent signal (mean from 3 infected wells) to the noise (mean from 3 mock-infected wells) quantified using a plate reader. both cell types were infected with a MOI of 1 for 48 h. the viral spread of Huh 7 cells was consistent over cell culture passages 6\u201330, indicating that the passage number does not impact EBOV spread in Huh 7 cells in the range tested. infectivity of EBOV at early and late cell passage of vero E6 and Huh 7 cells remained consistent regardless of passage number. the signal-to-noise ratio was determined for Vero E6 (A) cells at passage 6 and 28. the cells were infected at different MOIs of EBOV/Mak for 48 h. a constant MOI of 1 was treated with toremifene citrate for 48, 72, or 96 h. the activity of toremifene citrate increased as the virus input decreased. the EC50 at a MOI of 0.1 was 6.9-fold lower than at a MOI of 3. activity in vero E6 and Huh 7 cells was higher with maximum activity (EC50 = 0.15 M) at 96 hpi and an MOI of 0.001. EC50 values for toremifene citrate increased with exposure time and virus input in both cell types indicating that more drug is required to produce the same anti-EBOV effect. assay parameters, signal-to-noise (S/N), and Z' factor, were compared. at the earliest time point, the CELIA had higher sensitivity than the fluorescent detection assay as the Z' were in the acceptable range (>0.2) even at the lowest MOI of 0.1, the fluorescent assay required higher MOIs for reliable data sets (Z'>0.2) signal-to-noise ratio was determined using a Tecan plate reader. the signal is the mean value from 3 infected wells, the noise as the mean value from 3 mock-infected wells. chemiluminescent drug screen assay performed with the Alexa-594 antibody. fluorescence was determined with a Tecan plate reader, the percentage of EBOV-positive cells was determined by HCI. activity of toremifene citrate was evaluated at an MOI of 0.5 (EBOV/Mak) with a 48 hpi endpoint in vero E6, Huh 7 and MDMs using the CELIA. the chemiluminescent drug screen assay for evaluating anti-EBOV activity of compounds is a very robust, reliable and reproducible method. EBOV, Ebola virus; EC50, half maximum effective concentration; Mak, Makona; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophages. susceptibility to EBOV infection was evaluated in multiple cell types. the HCI system proved invaluable for determining optimal assay conditions. the assay endpoints were 24, 48, 72 or 96 hpi. different virus input and endpoints were assessed to identify an acceptable range for testing drugs in vero E6 and Huh 7 cells. the same experimental plates from Fig 2A\u20132D were used for this analysis. the percentage of EBOV-positive cells should be kept within a range of 10 to 80%. a EBOV/Makona isolate was used for the virus inoculum. the percentage of EBOV-positive cells was determined with a VP40/Alexa-594 antibody stain to detect EBOV. a EBOV/Makona isolate was used for the virus inoculum. the percentage of EBOV-positive cells was determined with a VP40/Alexa-594 antibody stain to detect EBOV and a nuclear stain to quantify the number of cells. Vero E6 and Huh7 cells were analyzed at different cell passage numbers by determining percentage of EBOV-positive cells. both cell types were infected with a MOI of 1 for 48 h. the viral spread of Huh 7 cells was consistent over cell culture passages 6\u201330. Vero E6 cells tested at the later passage showed a lower infection rate (40%) as expected, while the early passage showed an unusually high infection rate (up to 80%). infectivity in Huh 7 cells remained consistent regardless of passage number. mifene citrate is an FDA-approved drug with proven anti-EBOV activity. mifene citrate was infected with a constant MOI of 1 and treated with toremifene citrate for 48, 72, or 96 h. the EC50 at a MOI of 0.1 was 6.9-fold lower than at a MOI of 3. EC50 values for toremifene citrate increased with exposure time and virus input in both cell types. activity in vero E6 and Huh 7 cells was higher with maximum activity (EC50 = 0.15 M) at 96 hpi and an MOI of 0.01. the CELIA was compared to the fluorescent assay (detected by regular plate reader or the HCI system) by testing the efficacy of toremifene citrate against EBOV infection in Huh 7 cells with a range of MOIs (0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3) at three different time points (24, 48 and 72 hpi) at the earliest time point (24 hpi), the CELIA had higher sensitivity than the fluorescent detection assay as a signal-to-noise ratio was determined using a Tecan plate reader. the signal is the mean value from 3 infected wells, the noise as the mean value from 3 mock-infected wells. the signal is the mean value from 3 infected wells, the noise as the mean value from 3 mock-infected wells. 0.05 * 3.65 0.82 5.28 1.70 0.3 * 0.46 0.03 0.39 0.0 * 2.69 0.0 3.95 0.46 0.1 * * 0.25 0.04 * 3.27 1.0 * 48 h 3 3.43 0.12 3.01 0.49 2.43 0.14 11.14 1.92 5.80 0.28 5.59 0.08 1 1.99 0.02 2.03 0.20 1.37 0.09 0.09 10.59 0.68 5.14 0.04 4.89 0.07 0.3 1.34 0.39 0.90 0.19 1.10 0. activity of toremifene citrate in the CELIA was evaluated at an MOI of 0.5 (EBOV/Mak) with a 48 hpi endpoint in vero E6, Huh 7 and MDM cells using the CELIA. the chemiluminescent drug screen assay for evaluating anti-EBOV activity of compounds is a very robust, reliable and reproducible method. EBOV, Ebola virus; EC50, half maximum effective concentration; Mak, Makona; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophages. the human liver cancer cell line, Huh 7 and human MDMs were chosen for these studies. EBOV grew slower in vero E6 and Huh 7 cells. an MOI of 1 is not suitable for detecting inhibitors of later steps in the virus life-cycle. the ability to detect inhibitors of virus assembly or egress will be reduced with increasing MOI. the plate reader will measure the average fluorescence across the whole well. readings are quick and conducive to handling large numbers of plates during screening. but the quality of the cell layer cannot be monitored. toremifene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator reported to be active in vivo against EBOV in mice [12, 33]. this is an FDA-approved drug for treating breast cancer [12, 33]. the EC50 of a drug can range over more than a log based on testing conditions (e.g. MOI, time of endpoint, serum) the EC50 of a drug can range over more than a log based on testing conditions."}
