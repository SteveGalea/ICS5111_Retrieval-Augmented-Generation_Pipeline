{"summary": "toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease that is induced through the infection of toxoplasma gondii in many countries worldwide as a zoonotic parasitosis. it causes serious diseases and chronic infection in various sites of the human body in all age groups, including adults and young children as well as pregnant women. several compounds were developed as drugs for treating toxoplasmosis. existing drugs are widely vulnerable to drug-resistance in clinics globally. effective next-generation drugs for treating toxoplasmosis are not yet developed. the mechanism of action of ursolic acid on the inhibitory effect of T. gondii and the immunomodulatory activity was not reported yet. this study was performed to evaluate the mechanism of action and the immunomodulatory activity of ursolic acid against the viability of T. gondii. UA strongly decreased the viability of T. gondii compared with sulfadiazine (SF) which demonstrates that UA caused anti-T. gondii effect or activity against T. gondi. in particular, the lung cells infected with T. gondii were markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with ursolic acid (12.5\u2013200 g/mL) T. gondii-infected lung cells were treated with different concentrations (12.5\u2013200 g/mL) of ursolic acid (UA) and sulfadiazine (SF) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. their survival rates were inhibited a dose-dependent manner. the intracellular organelles of T. gondii were markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. the changes were clearly observed under electrophoresis. rhoptry plays as a critical factor when T. gondii enters into host cells during invasion stage [44,45,46,47,48] compartment protein 3) were synthesized to complementary DNA (cDNA) through one-step RT-PCR kit. the specific genes were synthesized through the untreated positive group and the treated group. the activities of ROS and NO in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF were lower than normal and infection groups treated with UA and SF. the activities of ROS and NO were significantly increased in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF. the results are presented as a percentage of the normal group. the change of cytokines by interaction of Ursolic acid and Immune cells T. gondii proliferates rapidly in host cells through parasitic interactions and signals for its survival. ii-infected cells treated with SF did not produce the expression of interferon-, TGF-1 and TNF- compared to the infected group. this shows that SF is not involved in immune response for expressing TNF-, TGF-1, and interferon- in immune cells. p 0.05 was considered to be significant. change of production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. the production of IL-1 and IL-12 in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF was significantly increased and the expression of IL-10 was gradually decreased compared with the infection group. however, there were no significant changes of the production of IL-6 and IL-12 in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF. the results are presented as a percentage of the normal group. p 0.05 was considered to be significant. UA strongly decreased the viability of T. gondii compared with sulfadiazine (SF) which demonstrates that UA caused anti-T. gondii effect or activity against T. gondii. in particular, the lung cells infected with T. gondii were markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with ursolic acid (12.5\u2013200 g/mL) T. gondii-infected lung cells were treated with different concentrations (12.5\u2013200 g/mL) of ursolic acid (UA) and sulfadiazine (SF) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. their survival rates were inhibited a dose-dependent manner. rhoptry plays as a critical factor when T. gondii enters into host cells during invasion stage. it is known that rhoptry plays as a critical factor when T. gondii enters into host cells during invasion stage [44,45,46,47,48] the specific genes were esized to complementary DNA (cDNA) through one-step RT-PCR kit. the specific genes were compared through the untreated positive group and the treated group. the activities of ROS and NO in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF were lower than normal and infection groups treated with UA and SF. the activities of ROS and NO were significantly increased in T. gondii-infected groups treated with UA and SF, respectively. the results are presented as a percentage of the normal group. the change of cytokines by interaction of Ursolic acid and Immune cells T. gondii proliferates rapidly in host cells. T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF did not produce the expression of interferon-, TGF-1, and TNF- compared to the infected group. UA reduced the expression of TGF-1 in immune cells by directly inhibiting T. gondii. the change of production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. the co-cultured cells immune cells were infected with T. gondii (cells: T. gondii = 1:4). the production of IL-1 and IL-12 in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF was significantly increased and the expression of IL-10 was gradually decreased compared with the infection group. however, there were no significant changes of the production of IL-6 and IL-12 in T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF. co-cultured cells immune cells were infected with T. gondii (cells: T. gondii = 1:4). the results are presented as a percentage of the normal group. toxoplasmosis, a zoonotic parasitosis, is transmitted via physical contact with pets and companion animals, including cats and dogs. the parasitic infectious diseases are consistently caused through various infection pathways and factors. a zoonotic parasite affects both humans and animals, resulting in parasitic diseases such as toxoplasmosis. granules of T. gondii, such as the conoid, GRAs, SAGs, the rhoptry, microneme proteins, and the inner membrane complex, were focused upon as major targets for blocking T. gondii infection. in this study, we evaluated the anti-parasitic effect of UA which inhibits the survival of parasite after T. gondii infection through a T. gondii-infected co-cultured immune system UA suppressed the expression of TGF-1 in immune cells treated with UA. UA also increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and interferon- in T. gondii-infected cells. UA induces anti-T. gondii effects/action by effectively blocking or inhibiting the survival of T. gondii. also has anti-parasitic activity that consistently inhibits the proliferation/growth of T. gondii. results indicate that UA induces the death of T. gondii by promoting the production of ROS and NO. UA requires further study for efficacy and safety against toxoplasmosis in preclinical stages through in vivo animal models in near future. sulfadiazine (SF) was dissolved in DMSO, and ursolic acid (UA) was also dissolved in DMSO. the cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 and DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine, supplemented with 15% decomplemented fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL) five days after the injection, T. gondii was collected from the peritoneal fluids of mouse kept in the abdominal cavity of each BALB-c/mouse. normal lung cells were infected with T. gondii (cells: T. gondii = 1:4) and T. gondii-infected cells were treated with different concentrations (12.5\u2013200 g/mL) of ursolic acid (UA) and sulfadiazine (SF) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. their viabilities were evaluated by MTT assay. the specific genes of T. gondii were synthesized to complementary DNA (cDNA) through one-step RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) the groups were divided into the untreated positive group (T. gondii-infected group) and experimental groups (UA and SF-treated groups) the cells were divided into normal and experimental groups as described above. the NO and ROS production were measured in the control and treated groups according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the rates of NO and ROS production were measured using an ELISA microplate leader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) the results were expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. a value of * p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd. ursolic acid was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 50 mg/mL. the compounds were filtered using 0.2-m membrane syringe filters. the cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 and DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine.
