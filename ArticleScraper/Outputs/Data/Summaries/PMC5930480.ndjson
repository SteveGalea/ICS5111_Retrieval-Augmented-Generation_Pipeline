{"summary": "a generalized PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) model was thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence numerically. similarity comparisons among -globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses were made. the experimental methods are cost-intensive and time-consuming. the latter can discriminate DNA-binding and non-binding proteins with high accuracy. the latter can discriminate DNA-binding and non-binding proteins with high accuracy. the concept of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), or Chou\u2019s PseAAC, was proposed [10-18]. the essence of PseAAC is that it covers AAC, but also contains additional order-correlated factors along a protein sequence. a sequence-derived feature vector of dimension (25+ ) is thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence. we apply the presented feature vector to compare -globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses respectively. coronaviruses (CoVs) can be divided into three groups according to serotypes. group alpha (formerly known as CoV-1) and group beta (formerly CoV-2) contain mammalian viruses. group gamma (formerly CoV-3) contains only avian viruses.

[4]. the final dataset is composed of 82 DNA-BPs and 100 NBPs. the current version of DNAeSet has 146 DNA-BPs and 1710 NBPs. if P 1 * A A i, we scale them into the interval [0,1] by the formulary below: P n * A A i = P n 0 A A i - min j = 1,..., 20 P n 0 A A j - min j = 1,..., 20 P n 0 A A A j, i = 1,2,..., 20, n = 1,2. each of the 20 standard amino acids has a label pair. if property P 2 * is considered, the second label for amino acid A A i can be obtained. the sequence segment EKAAVTGFWGKVKVDEVGAEA is reduced into a three-letter sequence. in mathematics, one can let S = S 1 S 2 S L be a given three-letter sequence. then one has a map, which maps S into a plot set. L/L is a nonnegative symmetric matrix whose off-diagonal entries are defined as a quotient of the Euclidean distance between two vertices of the graph. by definition all diagonal elements are zero. the higher order kL/kL matrix is the matrix whose (i,j)-entry is L / L i j k. mZg1 gives greater weights to inner vertices/edges than to inner ones in a graph. eigenvalue-based indices, such as the leading eigenvalue, are often used as the matrix invariants. the matrix, m 1 and F are the m1- and F-norms of a matrix respectively. in order to reduce variations caused by comparison of matrices with different sizes, we consider a normalized ALE-index M G = ( M G ) 3 L instead of ( M G. f c 1, f c 2, f c 3 = c A # G A L, c C # G C L, c H # G H L where, #. by combining these elements with the conventional amino acid composition (AAC), a 25 + dimensional feature vector can be constructed to numerically characterize a protein sequence. qs (7) and (8) can be determined by a set of known samples. the vector contains the feature of AAC, and the information beyond AAC. the vector is similar to Chou\u2019s PseAAC in form. the corresponding values are listed in Table 3. The last row gives the average values. each of the 20 standard amino acids has a label pair. the 20 standard amino acids are distributed to the following groups: GI= A,Y,V,Q,M,L,I,E, GII= C,W,S,N,G,F,D, GIII= H,T,R,P,K. for each group, the first amino acid is used to stand for the group. in mathematics, one can let S = S 1 S 2 S L be a given three-letter sequence. then one has a map, which maps S into a plot set. in Fig. (2), we show the 2-D graphical representation of sequence. the higher order kL/kL matrix is the matrix whose (i,j)-entry is L / L i j k. as the exponent k approaches positive infinity, kL/kL converges to a (0,1) matrix (denoted by bL/bL) in the curve, including cases of adjacency and non-adjacency. mZg1 gives greater weights to outer vertices/edges than inner ones in a graph. we call the number of graph G a line-adjacency index, and denote it by La(G) we define a coupling mode function g n ( S, k) by g n S, k = i = 1 L - k P n S i - P n S i + k 2, (n=1, 2) (5) where P1 and P2 are values for properties of the corresponding representative letter (group), integer k represents the counted rank (or tier) of the coupling mode. 1, f c 2, f c 3 = c A # G A L, c C # G C L, c H # G H L where, #. a 25 + dimensional feature vector can be constructed to numerically characterize a protein sequence. the vector contains the feature of AAC, and the information beyond AAC as well. results and Discussion In this section, we will discuss the use of the generalized PseAAC. this descriptor contains four uncertain parameters: w1, w2 and w3. this represents the total number of correlation ranks counted (cf. Eq(6)), which is an integer. e of mammals, primate species (Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla) are grouped closely. rodent species (Norway rat, Spiny mouse, House mouse) and lagomorph species (Rabbit, European hare) are situated at independent branches. this result is analogous to that reported in the literature. a closer look at the subtree of beta coronaviruses shows that MERS-CoVs are clearly clustered together. MHV, MHVA, MHVM, MHVP, MHVJHM, BCoV, BCoVE, BCoVL, BCoVL, BCoVQ and HCoV-OC43 are situated at an independent branch. this model involves two tunable parameters: the kernel width and the penalty parameter C. Prediction performance can be assessed using some quality indices including Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), F-measure (F1M) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) sensitivity, specificity, ACC, MCC and F1M are calculated for each run. results show that our SVM model performs well on the benchmark dataset DNASet. our SVM model performs equally well on independent dataset. results of existing methods including DNAbinder [1], iDNA-Prot [3] and enDNA-Prot [4] are also listed in Table 6. a feature vector with dimension of 188 adopts an ensemble classifier constructed with four types of machine learning classifiers. the current approach outperforms other methods by 3.29-10.44% in terms of ACC, 0.056-0.206 in terms of MCC, and 1.45-15.76% in terms of F1M. this result indicates that our method achieves highly comparable performance. for each subset S k, k=1, 2,..., 30, we develop the SVM model by 5CV with 3 runs. results averaging over the three runs are given in Fig. (5). ACC and acc visibly split with each other when n, the size of S k -, is larger. method ACC(%) MCC F1M(%) This work 92.05 0.84 91.24 DNAbinder(PSSM-21) 72.93 0.52 57.39 DNAbinder(PSSM-400) 78.45 0.61 68.80 DNA-Prot 76.37 0.58 64.46 iDNA-Prot 76.92 0.58 66.13 enDNA-Prot 89.56 0.79 87.42. a 17 17 real symmetric matrix D 17 is obtained. the result will depend on values of the rank and the three weight factors. a 31-D feature vector is thus obtained. as of July 2017, 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in over 27 countries. at least 710 individuals have died (crude CFR 34.8%) [43]. support vector machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier. R package \u2018e1071\u2019 v1.6-8 [44] is used to implement SVM. the higher the values of these measurements, the better the quality of prediction. 4.3.1. Predictive Performance on Benchmark Dataset This experiment is made on DNASet itself. our model correctly predicts 68 out of 82 DNA-BPs and 92 out of 100 NBPs. the ACC arrives at 87.91%, with the MCC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1M of 0.756, 82.93%, 92.00% and 86.07% respectively. PSSM-21 and PSSM-400 are two feature vectors generated by means of PSSM. iDNA-Prot is a random forest based method, in which the feature vector includes sequence information and structure information. iDNA-Prot [3] constructs the feature vector via the grey model. each subset S k contains all the 146 DNA-BPs and a part of NBPs in DNAeSet. if the set of NBPs in S k is denoted by S k -, k=1, 2,..., then S 1 consists of 250 NBPs randomly selected from DNAeSet. results obtained by the other four methods (DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot) trained on the expanded benchmark dataset with n=1100 are also listed in Table 7. results obtained by the other four methods (trained on DNAeSet and tested on DNAiSet) are also listed in Table 7. the corresponding ALE-index, the line-adjacency index, the first Zagreb index and its modification were calculated. on five popular datasets, the proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis and identification of DNA-binding proteins. results illustrated the better performance of our method. 89.65 89.65 MCC 0.7761 0.7761 0.7758 0.776 F1M(%) 84.87 84.87 84.98 84.91 4.3.2. Predictive performance on blind dataset. we establish the classifier with the benchmark dataset DNASet and then test it on the independent dataset DNAiSet. DNAbinder [1], DNA-Prot [2], iDNA-Prot [3] and enDNA-Prot [4] can extract evolutionary information in form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from the corresponding protein sequence. iDNA-Prot [3] constructs the feature vector via the grey model, and Random Forest is also used as the operation engine. each subset S k contains all the 146 DNA-BPs and a part of NBPs in DNAeSet. if the set of NBPs in S k is denoted by S k -, k=1, 2,..., then S 1 consists of 250 NBPs randomly selected from DNAeSet. Xu et al. created a dataset called expanded benchmark dataset1100 with all the 146 positive samples and 1100 negative samples in DNAeSet. results obtained by the other four methods (DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot) trained on the expanded benchmark dataset with n=1100 are also listed in Table 7. by replacing each amino acid with its representative letter, a protein primary sequence was converted into a three-letter sequence. on the basis of the three-letter sequence, a graph without loops and multiple edges was obtained."}
