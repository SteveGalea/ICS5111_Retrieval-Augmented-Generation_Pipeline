{"summary": "serum samples were taken from patients in 7 designated SARS hospitals in the province during March\u2013August 2003. follow-up serum samples were taken at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after the onset of symptoms. 176 cases that met the world health organization (WHO) SARS case definition (8) were included in this study. the cutoff for IgG and IgM determination was defined as 0.13 and 0.11. the OD of the negative control was 0.18 and 0.16, respectively. weak positive samples were retested in duplicate on the same day. the percentage of patients who were IgM positive within the first 7 days was 21.4% and peaked at 76.2% after 21\u201330 days. after 60 days, the average OD readings dropped to 0.167, close to the cutoff value of 0.160. the average OD readings dropped from 0.94 at 6 months to 0.64 at 1 year. the OD further dropped to 0.52 (45.83% reduction) by 2 years and to 0.25 by 3 years. the 3-year follow-up conducted in this study is the longest longitudinal study ever reported. similar results have been reported from longitudinal studies of convalescent SARS patients with smaller cohort size (18\u201398 patients) and shorter follow-up period (9\u201314)"}
