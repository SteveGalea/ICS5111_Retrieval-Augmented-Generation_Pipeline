{"summary": "a Bethe lattices is defined to be a tree where each site has Z neighbours. if all sites are occupied randomly with the same probability p, then the percolation is inhomogeneous. we divide Z neighbours of each site into mdifferent groups. if the grandparent site is an ith type-site then for the parent site, there are sub-branches that begin with first type-sites and sub-branches which begin with second type-sites. in this case only branches are accessible on average. the critical surface is the subset of the occupation-probability set with all satisfying equation (4). in the supercritical phase, stands for, and there exists almost surely at least one infinite cluster of occupied sites. in the supercritical phase, stands for, and there exists almost surely at least one infinite cluster of occupied sites. average cluster size is Based on definition of inhomogeneous percolation on a Bethe lattice. the average cluster size (of occupied sites) is a function of the occupation probability. for, there exist infinite clusters of occupied sites and their number increases. for, let denote the probability that an ith type origin site belongs to a percolating infinite cluster, where,. a site belongs to a percolating infinite cluster, which means, not only the site itself is occupied, but also at least one of the branches (originating from the site) connects to the percolating cluster. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a corona-virus. in china, about 2523 cases have been infected with SARS in 2003. the disease is modelled as inhomogeneous percolation on Bethe lattices. the spreading process of SARS was divided into five stages. by random simulation, we found that the spreading of SARS has a fifteen-day time delay. we changed the five stages into: stage 1\u2014from March 20 to May 4, stage 2\u2014from May 5 to May 15, stage 3\u2014from May 16 to May 28. if one is infected with SARS and would live as a normal person, then the disease would infect a massive crowd of healthy people except for and. that warns us, at the initial stage of SARS, humankind should try their best to find SARS patients as early as possible and isolate them from healthy people. the average infected number of each day fluctuates with a trend of decline and it would be zero after a period, which predicates the infectious disease. if, the probability of a large outbreak of the disease is zero, and if p crosses, the probability picks up as a power law with exponent one in terms of p-pc, and the disease will outbreak rapidly. the methods in this paper will supply a quantitative measure for the risk of disease outbreaks. for, assume that a grandparent site is a first type-site on an infinite lattice, then for the parent site, there are sub-branches that begin with the first type-sites and sub-branches beginning with the second type-sites. if the grandparent site is an ith type-site then for the parent site, there are sub-branches that begin with first type-sites and sub-branches which begin with second type-sites. if the grandparent site is an ith type-site, then for the parent site, there are sub-branches that begin with first type-sites and sub-branches which begin with second type-sites. the theory generalizes the concept of exact critical value in homogeneous percolation. the critical surface is the subset of the occupation-probability set with all satisfying equation (4). in the supercritical phase, stands for, and there exists almost surely at least one infinite cluster of occupied sites. if the Bethe lattice is infinite, all sites are equivalent for evaluating the average cluster size of occupied sites. the average cluster size (of occupied sites), which is a function of the occupation probability, can reveal the intensity of percolation. for, there exist infinite clusters of occupied sites and their number increases as. the average cluster size is because the explicit expression of is very complex, we provide only the derivation process. percolation probability is indicated as that can reveal the intensity of percolating, for. a site belongs to a percolating infinite cluster, which means, not only the site itself is occupied, but also one of the branches (originating from the site) connects to the percolating cluster. in china, about 2523 cases have been infected with SARS in 2003. the spread of SARS is a percolation process. the disease is modelled as inhomogeneous percolation on Bethe lattices. the first case of SARS was confirmed on march 5 (in Beijing, 2003) and the government started reporting the cases from April 20 to June 23 (in Beijing, 2003) we find three other critical time points of SARS: May 1 (it is legal holidays from May 1 to May 7), May 14 (people generally panicked over SARS and limited their social activities) and May 30 (new cases of SARS considerably decreased) the spreading model of SARS (in Beijing) is inhomogeneous percolation on a Bethe lattice with dynamically changing parameters. the results of inhomogeneous percolation of SARS and some parameters by simulation and statistical analysis. if one is infected with SARS and would live as a normal person, then the disease would infect a massive crowd of healthy people except for and. in the initial stage of the SARS process, from March 20 to April 8, the average number of infected cases of each day was simulated. from April 9 to April 19, during the second stage of the disease, protective measures were taken with the understanding of the disease. by simulation, we found that the average infected number fluctuates with a trend of decline and it would be zero after a period, which predicates the disease can be controlled without any additional measures. the average number of infected individuals versus every day with infection probabilities that are larger, equal, and smaller than critical infection probability. the methods in this paper will supply a quantitative measure for the risk of disease outbreaks and to guide our practice more appropriately. the quotient is introduced to normalize the index by removing the affects of units33. denote the average contact number of each patient, the number of susceptible persons of Z, the ratio of infection probabilities of susceptible person to common person. the sensitivity index is the ratio of the. the popular sensitivity index of OAT approach is, where Y is the output, is the input, is the sensitivity index of Y to and is the partial derivative of Y with respect to. the quotient is introduced to normalize the index by removing the affects of units33. the inhomogeneous site percolation on Bethe lattices serves as an appropriate model to describe the dynamic spreading behaviour of the infectious disease. the percolation model of SARS is not only in good agreement with the actual recorded data, but also can be used to predict the future trend of the disease."}
