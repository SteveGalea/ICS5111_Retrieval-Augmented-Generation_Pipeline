{"summary": "infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease caused by infections bronchitis virus (IBV) the virus belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus (Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order; Cavanagh et al., 1992) the disease poses a major economic threat to the worldwide poultry industry because of poor weight gain and lost feeding efficiency in broilers. a predominant IBV type, QX-like IBV, has been circulating in china since 1998 when the first variant of this type was reported. over time, we have seen a sustained increase in the QX-like genotype in China. IBV TW-like GD strain was isolated from IB-affected chickens in the Guangdong Province of China in 2012. the chickens had been vaccinated with IBV Mass-type vaccines. the complete genome of the IBV strain GD was sequenced in our previous study. group A and C were inoculated with 200 l of allantoic fluid. group B and D were maintained as uninfected controls. three chicks from groups C and D were sacrificed at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post-challenge. thermal cycling was performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C, 45 s), annealing (55\u00b0C, 45 s), and polymerization (72\u00b0C, 1 min), and a final extension step was performed at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the amplified fragments were detected by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. a score of 0 was given if the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed movement. a score of 1 was given if 75\u2013100% of the cilia in the tracheal section showed movement. a score of 2 was given if 50\u201375% of the cilia in the tracheal section showed movement. a score of 4 was given if 25% of the cilia in the tracheal section showed movement. group control was inoculated with sterile saline using the same method. all chicks were observed daily for clinical signs attributable to IB infection. three chicks from each group were killed humanely and dissected. multiple comparisons were performed using Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test. significance was considered as follows: significant at P 0.05; highly significant at P 0.01; and very highly significant at P 0.001. the complete genome of the IBV strain GD was sequenced in our previous study. groups A and B were used to observe chicken mortality (n = 10 each) group C and D were used for sampling (n = 15 each) all the chickens were maintained in isolators under positive pressure in air-conditioned rooms. PCR was performed in a 20 l reaction volume containing 10 l of Taq SuperMix (TransGen, Beijing, China), 10 pmol of each primer, 100 ng of cDNA as the template, and 7 l of water. thermal cycling was performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C, 45 s), annealing (55\u00b0C, 45 s), and polymerization. sections of upper, middle, and lower parts of the trachea (nine rings per bird) were analyzed. the rings were placed in 96-well plates with Eagle\u2019s culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. they were then examined by inverted light microscopy at a magnification of 400. group A and C were inoculated with 200 l of allantoic fluid containing 106.00 EID50 of the GD virus. group B and D were maintained as uninfected controls. thermal cycling was performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C, 45 s), annealing (55\u00b0C, 45 s), and polymerization (72\u00b0C, 1 min), and a final extension step was performed at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. a pair of primers that amplified an 800-bp fragment of the IBV N gene was used in the PCR. microscopy at a magnification of 400 to determine the degree of integrity and the preservation of ciliary movement in the tracheal epithelial cells. a score of 0 was given if the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed movement; a score of 1 was given if 75\u2013100% of the cilia in the tracheal section showed movement; a score of 2 was given if 50\u201375% of the cilia in the trac control-GD were challenged with 200 L of the GD strain containing 106.00 EID50. the group control was inoculated with sterile saline using the same method. three chicks from each group were killed humanely and dissected at 5 and 7 dpc. the diseased chicks showed clinical signs of infection as early as 3 dpc. four birds in the GD-inoculated group A died during the experiment. the birds in the control groups were alert and active during the experiment. the bursa of Fabricius showed a heavy exudate of mucus. no obvious lesions were identified in any other organs in the infection-challenged group or in any birds that recovered from infection with strain GD. no obvious tracheal lesions were seen in the control group. black arrow indicates thickening of the lamina propria of the tracheal mucosa. white arrow indicates extensive drop out, degeneration, and necrosis. four chicks showed signs of depression and tracheal and bronchiolar rales at 7 dpc. mortality of group control-GD was 30% during 14-day observation period. the organs exhibited no apparent pathological changes after challenge in the JS-GD group during the observation period. no obvious lesions were found in the bursa of Fabricius in group JS-GD. bNumber of positive birds/total number of birds sampled at each time point. virus-positive rate for all swabs collected from larynxes of unvaccinated chickens was 100%. in the control-GD group no viruses were detected in the laryngeal swabs. ELISA antibody determination serum samples were collected for ELISA antibody tests from 21 dpi and 14 dpc. all chicks inoculated with the JS strain showed positive serum antibody responses at 21 dpi and the average antibody titer was 1966.93. and the average titers of the control-GD and JS-GD groups were 5402.60 and 3632.59 at 14 dpc. chickens exposed to strain GD had swollen kidneys, urate deposits and punctate hemorrhage in the throat and trachea and catarrhal exudate in the nasal cavity. swollen kidneys were detected in the respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, and bursa of Fabricius. foci of necrosis, intense multifocal nephritis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and mesenchyme dilation were scattered throughout the kidneys of the GD-inoculated chickens. no obvious tracheal lesions were observed in the control group; no obvious kidney lesions were found in the control group. the infection-challenged group showed a maximum average ciliostasis score of approximately 4. the difference between the strain-GD-infected group and the control group was highly significant (p 0.0001) Viral Shedding The viral shedding rate was 100% in the challenged group at 5 and 7 dpc. clinical observations Three-week-old SPF chickens challenged with the GD strain showed clinical signs of infection as early as 3 dpc. diseased chicks showed signs of coughing, sneezing, tracheal and bronchiolar rales, listlessness, huddling, and ruffled feathers. hemorrhage in the throat and trachea and catarrhal exudate in the nasal cavity. urate deposits frequently observed in the tubules and ureters. the bursa of Fabricius showed a heavy exudate of mucus. trachea (A,C,E,G) and kidneys (B,D,F,H) of 3-week-old SPF chickens challenged with IBV strain GD. no obvious tracheal lesions were seen in the control group. black arrow indicates thickening of lamina propria of tracheal mucosa. dpc and in the lungs, spleen, and glandular stomach at 3\u20137 dpc. the proportion of virus-positive samples in the GD-infected group was 62.5% (45/72) the mental status and appetite in the JS-GD group showed no obvious changes. the organs also exhibited no apparent pathological changes after challenge in the JS-GD group during the observation period. control-GD 5 3/3 2/3 1/3 1/3 1/3 3/3 7 3/3 2/3 3/3 0/3 2/3 2/3 JS-GD 5 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 2/3 aDay post-challenge. bNumber of positive birds/total number of birds sampled at each time point. chea ciliostasis scores for 9-week-old chickens experimentally challenged with IBV GD strain. the degree of ciliary activity inhibition was determined at 5 and 7 dpc in the trachea. the error bar indicates standard deviation. survival percentage (A) and gross lesions of bursa of Fabricius (B) were found in 9-week-old SPF chickens experimentally challenged with IBV GD strain. no obvious lesions were found in the bursa of Fabricius in group JS-GD. bNumber of positive birds/total number of birds sampled at each time point. virus-positive rate for all swabs collected from larynxes of unvaccinated chickens was 100%. in the control-GD group no viruses were detected in the laryngeal swabs.
