{"summary": "a number of key studies have shown that infectious disease spread depends significantly upon the spatial features of a population [1]\u2013[5]. major benefits of spatial disease modeling include the assessment of disease intervention and control strategies (e.g., border control and quarantine) the simulated space-time distributions of the infected, susceptible, and recovered population fractions are plotted in Figures 1a\u2013d for t = 5, 10, 20 and 30. the simulated space-time distributions of the infected, susceptible, and recovered population fractions are plotted in Figures 1a\u2013d for t = 5, 10, 20 and 30. the expected value of the ratio between the right- and left-handsides of Eq. (S2) varies with the distance at different times t = 2, 8, 10 and 30. the constraint in Eq. (S2) is satisfied to a good approximation. the SIR model in Eqs can be accurately described using a spatially homogeneous -function. empirical estimates of the normalized to max-1 covariance function at different times t. for small times t10, one observes a very good fit between the empirical and theoretical covariances across space. however, as t increases and for large distances the deviations between simulated and theoretical covariances become larger. the population fraction which finally remains unaffected by the disease tends to be closer to zero. a = 0.6, more than half of the population remains free of the disease. a = 0.6, more than half of the population remains free of the disease. Figure 7a presents a comparison of the temporal evolution of (solid lines), (dashed lines), and (pointed lines) at a certain location in terms of (a) the temporal variation with different values of the probability of recovery (red color), 0.4 (blue), 0.6 (green) the probability of transmission is, the population fraction that resides inside the domain of interest is, and (b) the associated simplex triangle plot. figure 8b is a simplex triangle representation of Fig. 8a. for the increase of the infected population fraction is faster with time than for. the maximum infected fraction remains the same, but it is reached faster in the purely temporal case (red color) the study focuses on a specific set of Chinese counties with relatively higher disease incidence. the data is weekly-aggregated HFMD rates (cases of infecteds per 10000 people) over a period of 20 weeks that span from September 27\u2013October 3, 2008 () to February 7\u201313, 2009. the covariances at subsequent instances are based on the initial covariance that is computed for the initial spatial distribution of. the covariance at t = 1 was estimated from the observed values at that instance, and was fitted by a correlation model with a nugget effect equal to 0.07 (rate variance units) and a spherical model with sill 0.07 (rate variance units) and spatial range 3\u00b0. the prediction error throughout the study was found to range between 0.0067 and 0.2884. the prediction error was found to range between 0.0067 and 0.2884. this application shows how BME-SIR can be effectively used to estimate the disease spread based on highly uncertain data. the population portion that resides at a certain location is estimated as (7) where is the distance between grid points i and j. approximately 70% of the population at each unit cell of the grid has residence time equal to the time step. one sees that the obtained estimates are fitted well by the functional form with parameters, and. the theoretical covariance of the infected population fraction is calculated from Eq. (S5) using the aforementioned exponential form of the -function. the latter are empirical estimates of the normalized to max-1 covariance function at different times t, obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. evolution of (solid lines), (dashed lines), and (pointed lines) at a certain location assuming different values of the probability of infection transmission (red color), 0.2 (blue), 0.3 (green) the probability of recovery is, the population fraction that resides inside the domain of interest is, and the kernel bandwidth is. Fig. 6b is a simplex triangle representation of Fig. 6a. variation of a leads to the \u201cinverse\u201d SIR behavior than that of b in Fig. 5a\u2013b. the simplex triangle paths are similar for the three cases, but the SIR velocities are different as reflected in the corresponding inter-point distances. the probability of recovery is set to, and the population fraction that resides inside the domain of interest is. the theoretical space-time BME-SIR method is applied to a real-world study of the spread of hand-foot-mouth disease in China. HFMD is the most common infectious disease in China [23] therefore there is considerable interest in understanding the evolution of its spatiotemporal patterns. for initial conditions, the initial spatial spread of infecteds, is given by the observed rates at. we start with no recovered individuals at t = 1. by considering an approximate disease duration of 1 week, the remaining part of the population are susceptibles to the disease. the BME-SIR model predicts an approximate mean transmission rate. despite the arbitrary initial values of a and b, relatively accurate parameter estimates are reached relatively fast within about 2\u20134 weeks. in more elaborate examples, it might be desirable to provide better-informed initial estimates for these rates. space-time disease diffusion can be studied based on the knowledge of the parameters of disease dynamics inferred from data; e.g. transmission rate. however, in most cases, detailed and accurate information on population interactions is partially available. the developed BME-SIR model effectively achieves this goal using only two model parameters (transmission and recovery rates) the latter should suffice to reproduce the covariance structure of the susceptible, infected and recovered population fractions at different times over the whole simulation grid. real-time prediction of space-time disease spread is required by governmental agencies. Kalman filter is one of the most widely used data assimilation approaches for real-time prediction. it assumes the model and observation uncertainties are Gaussian-distributed. the proposed spatiotemporal BME-SIR filtering framework can incorporate multi-sourced uncertainties (like exKF) -Time Disease Model Disease spread is a fundamentally spatiotemporal phenomenon. this constitutes sufficient motivation for extending the original SIR model in the space-time context under conditions of real world uncertainty. the proposed model is described by the following generalized SIR model in continuous time. model (1a\u2013c) is a composite space-time representation of disease spread. the space-time covariances of,, are derived from the SIR model (details in File S1). disease evolution is governed by the space-time SIR model (1a\u2013c) therefore, includes the mean, covariance and cross-covariance functions of, and derived from the theoretical space-time SIR model (1a\u2013c) represents the available S-KB, which can be direct or indirect disease observations across space and time. the BME-SIR method fuses the SIR disease model (G-KB) and disease related observations and records (S-KB) in section IV, the SIR model will be discussed together with certain simulation cases, in which the BME-SIR method fuses the SIR disease model (G-KB) and disease related observations and records (S-KB) the closed-form solution of Eqs (4a\u2013c) is (5a-c) where,,,,,, and. the mathematical expressions of the covariance and cross-covariance functions of the disease variables are shown in Table 1. In the case when, and are constant in time, the parameters, and receive the following closed analytical forms (6a-c) the transition and Jacobian matrices characterize the dynamics of the SIR model. models the uncertainty of infected states across space, which cannot be represented by SIR modeling. the observation matrix contains only zeros and ones indicating data presence across space. the improvement of rate estimation is shown over time. the transmission rate estimation accuracy obtained by both methods is low when t>40. this is due to the low portion of susceptible population after time t = 40. this is due to the low portion of susceptible population after t>40 is less than 3%. the proposed modeling of the combined space-time distributions is described by the following generalized SIR model in continuous time (for the discrete time case), (1a-c) where is the population fraction that resides, is the delta function, and is a spatially homogeneous kernel (e.g., Gaussian kernel with finite variance) that controls population movement across space, with spatial integral being equal to. BME distinguishes between two major disease knowledge bases (KBs). the core or general KB, G-KB, includes physical and biological laws. the site-specific KB, S-KB includes hard or exact data and soft or uncertain data. estimated disease counts at each space-time point are the inputs to Eqs. (3a\u2013c), whereas the unknowns and vary from place to place and from time to time. estimates of the unknown parameters in vector are generally obtained by means of optimization techniques [32]\u2013[34]. in this case, Eqs (1a\u2013c) reduce to (4a-c) with ICs,,. is a function with a smooth shape similar to that of the covariance function of and. the closed-form solution of Eqs (4a\u2013c) is (5a-c) where,,,,,,,, and. in practice, spatiotemporal disease modeling is performed in uncertain conditions, e.g., erratic disease observations, incomplete prior knowledge of disease transmission and recovery rates. in the BME framework, the core or general KB (G) includes the SIR equations and the associated disease covariance models. the site-specific KB (S) includes the uncertain infected observations and the initial conditions of the transmission and recovery rates. both methods predict almost equally well the infected population fractions at different times t (mean-square errors: 23.93 for BME-SIR and 28.92 for the exKF) similar results obtained for the susceptible and recovered population fractions. real-time data assimilation should lead to better estimates of real-time transmission rates. s. 15\u201316 should lead to better estimates of real-time transmission rates."}
