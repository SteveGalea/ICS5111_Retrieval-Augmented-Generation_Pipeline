{"summary": "intramuscular injection of adult satellite cellderived myoblasts from a normal syngeneic donor into mdx mice results in dystrophinpositive muscle fibers. a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy. the extracellular domain of Dll1 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (Delta1extIgG) is sufficient for inhibition of differentiation in cultured mouse myoblasts. however, immobilization is required for effective signaling [15]. the intact fibers and muscle pieces were rinsed in a balanced saline solution. the digested muscle was digested fully with 400 U/ml collagenase type I (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) fibers of longer length and smoother appearance were visible. but constituted less than 1% of fibers. cells were transferred to a 15ml conical tube and centrifuged for 5 minutes. cells were washed three times before resuspending in PBS for injection. cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% cold fish skin gelatin, 0.05% sodium azide, and 1 PBS) the cells were washed in 1 PBS, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. expression values were normalized to expression of TATA binding protein (TBP) to ensure the data was consistent, expression was also normalized to expression of TATA binding protein (TBP) antisyndecan 4 and Alexa Fluor 488labeled antichicken antibody was a kind gift of D.D. Cornelison. expanded canine skeletal muscle cells dissociated from the plate were resuspended in FACS buffer. the injected muscle was harvested 28 days after injection, unless otherwise indicated. the harvested mouse muscle was covered in OCT within a plastic cryomold. the injected muscle was placed on top of an aluminum block immersed in liquid nitrogen. Alexa fluor 488conjugated goat antimouse IgG and Alexa fluor 568conjugated goat antimouse IgG2b secondary antibodies were used at 1:200. for dystrophin and lamin A/C staining, sections were fixed in acetone at 20\u00b0C for 10 minutes, allowed to dry, and rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) sections were washed in 1 PBS, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature, washed with 1 PBS, and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen) photomicrographs were taken using a Zeiss AxioImager.Z1 as part of a TissueFaxs system. each donor canine underwent a maximum of four skeletal muscle biopsies. the biopsy was harvested from the biceps femoris muscle of the donor canine. the muscle fibers were chopped and digested fully with 400 U/ml collagenase type I. canine muscle biopsies measured approximately 1 cm3 and were from the belly of the canine biceps femoris muscle. they were cut into smaller pieces along the length of the fiber. the digest was transferred to a 10cm plate with F12 media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) fibers of longer length and smoother appearance were visible, yet constituted less than 1% of fibers. immunocytochemistry Primary antibodies specific for Pax7 and myogenin (F5D) were obtained from the developmental studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) the cells were washed in 1 PBS, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature, washed with 1 PBS. Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) is 1/100th of the cDNA reaction mix and the following primers. Hey1F1 tcggctctaggttccatgtc; HeyLR1 gatcacttgaaaatgctccac; HeyLR1 tacctgatgacctcggtgag; Dtx4F1 cgtgagacgctccata the cells were washed, resuspended in FACS buffer, and sorted using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, http://www.rndsystems.com) the cells were washed, resuspended in FACS buffer, and sorted using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, http://www.rndsystems.com). the tibialis anterior muscle of the same hind limb was injected with 1.2% barium chloride immediately after irradiation. the injected muscle was harvested 28 days after injection, unless otherwise indicated. the region of highest engraftment was between slides 6 and 18. the region of highest engraftment was between slides 6 and 18. sections were fixed in acetone at 20\u00b0C for 10 minutes. primary antibody specific for Pax7 antibody was used at 1:10. for pax7 and lamin A/C costaining, cryosections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature, washed with 1 PBS, followed by permeabilization with methanol. the number of fibers expressing canine dystrophin, the number of nuclei expressing canine lamin A/C, and the number of nuclei expressing canine lamin A/C and Pax7 were counted from these crosssectional views. muscle fiber preparations and freshly isolated musclederived cells are considered the most effective material for muscle transplantation. the number of fibers expressing canine dystrophin (A) and number of nuclei expressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C (B) per crosssection were counted using cryosections surrounding the region of highest engraftment within the muscle. the bars represent the average SD (n 3 cryosections per mouse, n = 3 mice per cell dose) expanding myoblasts may have had a negative impact on engraftment. but these results are consistent with previous studies showing that expanding myoblasts diminishes transplantation efficiency. increased expression of Hey1, HeyL, and Dtx4 confirmed activation of Notch signaling in cells exposed to delta1extIgG. cDNA was generated from RNA isolated from canine musclederived cells cultured on plates coated with delta1extIgG (darker bars) and human IgG (lighter bars). expression of musculin, an inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, was significantly increased in cells exposed to delta1extIgG. culture of primary musclederived cells on Delta1extIgG promotes the expansion of Pax7 and Myf5positive cells with enhanced CXCR4 expression. 80% of cells expanded on Delta1extIgG is myogenic, as evidenced by syndecan 4 expression. cells expanded on delta1extIgG, or cells expanded on human IgG, maintain engraftment. the bars represent the average of the averages SD (n 3 cryosections per mouse, n = 3 mice per cell dose). transplantation of cells expanded on human IgG resulted in significantly fewer fibers expressing canine dystrophin and less than one nuclei coexpressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C per crosssection. however, notch activation during ex vivo muscle cell expansion maintained engraftment potential. increased muscle regeneration capacity of muscle cells expanded on the notch ligand was largely due to enhanced myogenesis rather than simple cell survival. limb irradiation prior to donor cell transplant prevents muscle regeneration from the host mouse satellite cells. muscle injected with delta1extIgG expanded cells showed a significant increase in fibers expressing canine dystrophin and a consistent number of nuclei coexpressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C. two groups of three mice were injected with 5 104 freshly isolated canine musclederived cells or cells expanded on delta1extIgG. the mixed population of musclederived cells was isolated from each injected muscle and transplanted into a secondary recipient. the bars represent the average SD from each mouse (n = 3 cryosections per mouse, n = 3 mice per cell dose). canine donor cells expressing Pax7 in muscle transplanted with cells expanded on delta1extIgG can function similar to satellite cells. muscle fiber preparations and freshly isolated musclederived cells are considered the most effective material for muscle transplantation. the results are consistent with prior studies showing that transplanting muscle fibers show the greatest per cell regeneration potential. canine dystrophin (A) and number of nuclei expressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C (B) per crosssection were counted using cryosections surrounding the region of highest engraftment within the muscle. bars represent the average SD (n 3 cryosections per mouse, n = 3 mice per cell dose) expanding myoblasts diminishes transplantation efficiency. but these results are consistent with previous studies showing that expanding myoblasts diminishes transplantation efficiency. cDNA was generated from RNA isolated from canine musclederived cells. the bars represent the average expression level relative to TIMM17B SD (n = 3). expression of musculin, an inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, was significantly increased in cells exposed to Delta1extIgG. culture of primary musclederived cells on Delta1extIgG promotes the expansion of Pax7 and Myf5positive cells with enhanced CXCR4 expression. 80% of cells expanded on Delta1extIgG is myogenic cells, as evidenced by syndecan 4 expression. cells expanded on delta1extIgG were immunostained with antidystrophin, antilamin A/C, and/or antiPax7 antibodies. the bars represent the average of the averages SD (n 3 cryosections per mouse, n = 3 mice per cell dose). fewer fibers expressing canine dystrophin and less than one nuclei coexpressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C per crosssection. notch activation during ex vivo muscle cell expansion maintained engraftment potential. increased muscle regeneration capacity of muscle cells expanded on the notch ligand was largely due to enhanced myogenesis rather than simple cell survival. muscle injected with delta1extIgG expanded cells showed a significant increase in the number of fibers expressing canine dystrophin. expression of a developmental form of myosin heavy chain (devMyHC), expressed in immature myofibers, indicated ongoing muscle regeneration. the transplanted muscle of group 1 was harvested 12 weeks after cell injection. canine dystrophinpositive fibers expressing developmental myosin heavy chain (devMyHC) were determined. bars represent the average SD from each mouse (n = 3 cryosections per mouse, n = 3 mice per cell dose) canine donor cells expressing Pax7 in muscle transplanted with cells expanded on delta1extIgG can function similar to satellite cells and participate in muscle regeneration. enzymatic disruption may cleave cell surface proteins required for donor cell engraftment. culturing musclederived cells on a substrate with a similar stiffness to normal skeletal muscle (12 kPa) improves donor cell engraftment. canine musclederived cells resulted in downregulation of MyoD and myogenin expression. increased expression of Myf5 indicates that induction of Notch signaling with delta1extIgG during ex vivo culture of the canine musclederived cells resulted in maintenance and expansion of a myogenic cell. a phase I clinical trial of transplantation of ex vivo expanded CD34+CD38cord blood precursors is currently underway in patients with high risk leukemias. this study indicates that a similar strategy of expanding human musclederived cells on Notch ligand might facilitate engraftment and muscle regeneration. supporting information Additional Supporting Information
