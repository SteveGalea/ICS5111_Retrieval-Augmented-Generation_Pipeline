{"summary": "the mammalian immune system acts to eradicate viral infection through disrupting pathways and functions imperative to the pathogen's life-cycle. our innate immune system has evolved a range of receptors to detect viral pathogens. PRRs initiate a series of signaling cascades that result in the production of the well-known antiviral cytokine, interferon. some host ISGs are present at high basal levels, or can be regulated directly by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) very early (once a virus has been detected in a host cell), independently of IFN, offering a positive reinforcement of the initial viral detection pathways. this review will briefly discuss the detection of viral pathogens and the production of ISGs. ovirdae (human adenovirus type 5) 30, 36 ssRNA(+) dsDNA cGAS, RIG-I, NF-B, AP-1, IRF3/5/7 no TRIM56 Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A and B viruses) Flaviviridae (HCV, bovine viral diarrhea virus, yellow fever, DENV serotype 2) Rhabdoviridae (VSV) Coronavi viral PAMPS are recognized by pattern recognition receptors. these pathways are augmented and enhanced by a number of IFN-stimulated genes. protein kinase R (PKR) is a double-stranded RNA receptor pivotal in the activation of MAVS. the first PRRs to be described were the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in drosophila. they recognize the pathogen-activated molecular patterns (PAMPS) present in invading pathogenic organisms. the early innate response detection of PAMPS is characterized best in mouse models of infection and also in humans. type I IFNs are produced by most cells, while type III IFNs are produced by epithelial cells. they are secreted from the virally infected cell, allowing them to bind to their cognate IFN receptor and activate the JAK-STAT pathway. translocation of ISGF3 to the nucleus allows activation of IFN-stimulated response elements in host antiviral genes. ISGs are part of a new group of host proteins that have a multipronged approach to inhibiting viral infection. they include protein kinase R (PKR), zinc-finger antiviral proteins (ZAPs), IFN-regulated members of the tripartite motif. PKR is an integral antiviral protein responsible for terminating protein synthesis in the cell upon the recognition and binding of viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm [9] PKR has since been reported to regulate a variety of signaling pathways, either in a kinase-dependent manner, or acting in a \u201cscaffold-like\u201d function independent of its enzymatic activity. PKR has been found to play a critical role in the posttranscriptional regulation of PKR plays an important role in the detection of viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm, acting itself as an RNA sensor. but its ability to also augment other innate RNA detection pathways, both cytosolic and endosomal, makes it an integral ISG. the shorter isoform demonstrates the greatest ability to enhance the type I IFN response. this augmentation of the type I IFN pathway has recently been attributed to the ability of ZAP-S to play a critical role in the regulation of the cytosolic RIG-I pathway. the discrepancy as to the role of ZAP-S in human and murine cells may lie in the divergent cell types examined, or may be a factor of species. it is clear that more work needs to be performed to solidify the role of ZAP-S in augmenting the RIG-I pathway in multiple animal species. 9 of the TRIM family members have previously been shown to be ISGs, TRIM5, TRIM6, TRIM9, TRIM14, TRIM21, TRIM25, TRIM38, TRIM56, and TRIM58. TRIM21 can facilitate innate sensing of both DNA and RNA viruses via cGAS- and RIG-I-dependent and independent mechanisms. TRIM21 catalyzed the synthesis of K63 TRIM56 is one of the widest-acting ISGs, with an ability to restrict viruses directly, but also enhance multiple innate signaling pathways. it has been shown to inhibit influenza viruses by impeding viral RNA synthesis as well as limit the replication of the flaviviruses, yellow fever, dengue, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. dsRNA knockdown of TRIM56 demonstrated a marked reduction in IFN- and ISG production via dsRNA stimulation of the TLR3 pathway. this was due to its ability to interact with the TLR3 adaptor protein, TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN- (TRIF) TRIM56 may also be involved in the direct modulation of the JAK-STAT pathway following IFN- stimulation. viperin is induced very early following viral infection, and is directly IRF3-regulated. it is also antiviral in its own right, being involved in viral RNA degradation independently of augmentation of the cytosolic RNA sensing pathways. DDX60 enables it to bind viral RNA while the protein's ATP-binding site enables its mediation of downstream RIG-I activation. DDX60 homolog, DDX60L, has also been demonstrated to play a role in the RIG-I-dependent activation of IFN. PKR has been found to play a critical role in the posttranscriptional regulation of IFN- in response to the activation of the cytosolic RNA sensor, MDA5, but not of RIG-I. PKR activation can induce IFN in the absence of the MDA5, with MAVS alone demonstrated to be essential in the PKR-driven upregulation of type I IFN [17]. PKR plays an important role in the detection of viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm. but its ability to increase other innate RNA detection pathways makes it an integral ISG in the host response to RNA viral infection. a shorter isoform demonstrates the greatest ability to enhance the type I IFN response. this augmentation of the type I IFN pathway has recently been attributed to the ability of ZAP-S to play a critical role in the regulation of the cytosolic RIG-I pathway. discrepancy as to the role of ZAP-S in human and murine cells may lie in the divergent cell types examined, or may be a factor of species. it is clear that more work needs to be performed to solidify the role of ZAP-S in augmenting the RIG-I pathway in multiple animal species. 9 TRIM family members have previously been shown to be ISGs, TRIM5, TRIM6, TRIM9, TRIM14, TRIM21, TRIM25, TRIM38, TRIM56, and TRIM58. TRIM21 can facilitate innate sensing of both DNA and RNA viruses via cGAS- and RIG-I-dependent and independent mechanisms. TRIM21 catalyzed the synthesis of K63-linked TRIM56 is one of the widest-acting ISGs, with an ability to restrict viruses directly, but also enhance multiple innate signaling pathways. it has been shown to inhibit influenza viruses by impeding viral RNA synthesis and limit the replication of the flaviviruses, yellow fever, dengue, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. TRIM56 is perhaps one of the widest-acting ISGs. dsRNA knockdown of TRIM56 demonstrated a marked reduction in IFN- and ISG production via dsRNA stimulation of the TLR3 pathway. TRIM56 was found to be essential due to its ability to interact with the TLR3 adaptor protein, TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN- (TRIF) viperin has been viewed as a potential enhancer of immune signaling. it is induced very early following viral infection, and is directly IRF3-regulated. it is also antiviral in its own right, being involved in viral RNA degradation independently of augmentation of the cytosolic RNA sensing pathways. dsRNA has been shown to associate with the innate RNA receptors RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 to augment the signaling pathways associated with these PRRs. the helicase domain of DDX60 enables it to bind viral RNA while the protein's ATP-binding site enables its mediation of downstream RIG-I activation. the exact role of DDX60 in the detection of dsRNA and activation of the cytosolic study of ISGs as possible augmenters of innate immunity has greatly increased our understanding of these pathways. only a small handful of ISGs able to both directly inhibit the viral life-cycle and augment the early innate immune signaling pathways that direct their upregulation."}
