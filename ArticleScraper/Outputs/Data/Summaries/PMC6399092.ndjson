{"summary": "autophagy is a dynamic process associated with the formation of autophagosomes, which are double-membrane cytoplasmic vesicles that engulf cellular components. autophagy is a dynamic process associated with the formation of autophagosomes, which are double-membrane cytoplasmic vesicles. autophagy regulates immunity by eliminating invading pathogens, regulating recognition of innate pathogens, playing roles in Ag presentation via MHC class II molecules. autophagy dysfunction is related to various inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (13), asthma (14), and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) eosinophil cationic protein [ECP], eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-16, and IL-25), chemokines (CCL5, CCL11, and CCL13), growth factors (TNF and TGF-/) these proteins contribute to sustained inflammation (26) and the current focus of asthma treatment is the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids. however, these drugs often failed to control asthma in some patients. recent studies suggest that asthma pathogenesis is largely heterogeneous and complex, which is not simply driven by allergen-specific Th2 lymphocytes. rs12201458 and rs510432) of Atg5 are associated with childhood asthma. inhibition of autophagy by intraperitoneal injection led to a marked improvement in AHR, the number of infiltrating eosinophils, IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and histological inflammatory features. atg5 knockdown (intranasal) AHR improved Decreased eosinophil count Mouse CD11c-specific deficiency of Atg5 Th17 polarization Protective Suzuki et al.

LC3 expression was decreased, while COX-2 expression increased significantly, in fresh NP tissues compared with control nasal mucosa. cyclooxygenase 2 (a common indicator of inflammation) is negatively regulated by autophagy in NP-derived fibroblasts. autophagy is an important regulator of epithelial cell apoptosis, which contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. CS extract induces apoptosis pathway, e.g., DISC and caspase-8, but also activates LC3B, autophagosome formation and, eventually, caspase-3 in epithelial cells. autophagosome formation is higher in COPD patients than in healthy controls. oxidative stress is a critical mediator of apoptosis in COPD. autophagy is linked to eosinophilic inflammation in CRS. autophagy-deficient macrophages promote production of the Th1 cytokine IFN- during GalN/LPS-induced liver injury (78) and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis (79). autophagy-deficient myeloid cells also promote Th17 responses during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (80) and Th2 responses during eosinophilic CRS (17)."}
