{"summary": "the overall survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. despite recent advancements in cancer treatment, the overall survival of patients with this type of cancer has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. a specimen was deposited in the herbarium of the Tokyo University of marine science and technology. dry powdered roots (100 g) of S. baicalensis were extracted and then concentrated until dry at 1 mg/ml under reduced pressure. monolayer cell proliferation measured using an MTT assay kit. it measures a purple formazan compound produced by viable cells. the anchorage-independent growth was measured using a commercial kit. Western blot analysis Western blot analysis of fraction markers was carried out. anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK (ERK1/2), anti-phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and anti-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. the cultures were photographed after 12 h (10, 40 magnifications) Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student\u2019s t-test. data were shown as the means standard deviation. monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as previously described (12). the monolayer proliferation was measured using an MTT assay kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA) the anchorage-independent growth was measured using a commercial kit. SAS cells were inoculated at a density of 1106 cells in 10-cm diameter dishes. cells were replenished with fresh medium and cultured for 24 h. cells were then replenished with fresh medium and cultured for 12 h. growth factor (VEGF) and hydrocortisone for 6 h were harvested. cultures were photographed after 12 h (10, 40 magnifications) Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student\u2019s t-test. S. baicalensis root extract inhibited monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth in OSCC cells. the extract at a dose of 100 g/ml showed significant inhibition of monolayer proliferation in cells from the four cell lines. cis-dichloroplatinum-exposed samples were used as the positive control. S. baicalensis root extract did not affect adhesion to ECM. hypoxia converted proMMP-2 into its active form in SAS cells. in both hypoxic (H) and normoxic (N) conditions for 12 h were examined. initially the effects of S. baicalensis on signal transduction were investigated. assays were conducted to detect the induction of cell apoptosis. aved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression was observed at 12\u201324 h. apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2 expression also decreased markedly within 12\u201324 h. DNA fragmentation was observed in SAS cells treated with S. baicalensis. VEGF (10 ng/ml) significantly increased proliferation of HUVECs. resulting in complete blockage by S. baicalensis (100 g/ml) seven herbal products were available out of >400 bio-active herbal products. h201 induced significant growth inhibition at a dose of 100 g/ml. the active compound in the h201 herbal product was identified as the S. baicalensis root extract. Scutellaria baicalensis extract at a dose of 100 g/ml significantly inhibited monolayer proliferation. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences vs. the control at *P0.05. the levels of proteolytic activities detected at a dose of 100 g/ml of S. baicalensis were inhibited in the hypoxic-SAS cell samples compared to normoxic ones. the levels of proteolytic activities detected at a dose of 100 g/ml were inhibited in the hypoxic-SAS cell samples. phosphorylated or total p38 and phosphorylated or total c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 were analyzed by western blot analysis. phosphorylated or total c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/JNK2) were cultured after stimulation by S. baicalensis (100 g/ml) Scutellaria baicalensis inhibits VEGF-induced proliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells. VEGF (10 ng/ml) significantly increased proliferation of HUVECs. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences vs. the control at *P0.05. HUVECs were pre-treated with various concentrations of S. baicalensis (10 or 100 g/ml) prior to treatment with 10 g/ml VEGF. wogonin derived from S. baicalensis showed antitumor and anti-angiogenic effects on various cancer cell lines (25\u201327) the effects of these flavonoids are not anti-proliferative in all the cell lines, suggesting that they exert either pro- or anti-apoptotic activity. a postulated mechanism for this is the inhibition of cell cycle regulatory proteins (CDK4, cyclin D1) within 6 h. S. baicalensis suppresses angiogenesis via the differentiated inhibition of human endothelial cells. potential properties of S. baicalensis leading to blockage of OSCC tumor blood supply are likely to be beneficial for future chemo-preventive and therapeutic agents used against this disease."}
