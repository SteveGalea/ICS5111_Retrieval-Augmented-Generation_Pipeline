{"summary": "adenoviridae comprises a large group of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that infect a wide range of hosts, including mammals, reptiles, reptiles, reptiles, reptiles, amphibians, and marsupials. other genera, such as Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus, include viruses that infect a wide range of hosts. bats have long been recognized as an important reservoir for a variety of different viruses such as lyssaviruses (6, 7) the number of novel viruses recovered from bats has dramatically increased in recent years due to advances in metagenomic analysis (8\u201310) and increased surveillance and sampling of bats in response to the discovery of their potential roles in harboring high-risk human pathogens. adenoviruses from rufous horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) whose genomes are considerably divergent from BtAdV A and B (32), greatly expanding the known diversity of BtAdVs. however, little is currently known regarding the ecology, epizootiology, and molecular biology of BtAdVs. virions performed single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of the BtAdV 250-A capsid. compared the resolved structure to that of CAdV A, allowing us to examine the structural changes associated with the phylogenetic divergence. two adult Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) roosting in a cave in MCNP. hexon protein comprises the bulk of the adenovirus capsid. hexon protein comprises the bulk of the adenovirus capsid. adenovirus was isolated from gastrointestinal tissue samples taken from bat 250-A. brain, trachea, and heart samples were negative for virus isolation. BLAST analysis showed the highest nucleotide identity (74.6%) to CAdV-1. the 31,481-nt genome of BtAdV 250-A is shown. the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) found at the ends of the genome are highlighted in royal blue. genes that are believed to be spliced are indicated by two genetic elements. the virus sharing the highest degree of amino acid identity to BtAdV 250-A for each protein is underlined. a lowercase \u201cp\u201d preceding a protein's name indicates a precursor form of the protein that is subsequently cleaved by the AVP. the BtAdV 250-A genome shared nucleotide identities of 72.7% to BtAdV A and 68.7% to CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. BtAdV 250-A shared the highest amino acid identity to BtAdV A in 25 of 31 cognate proteins. it was most similar to CAdV-2 in the fiber (58.9%), IX (63.0%), and Pol (77.7%) proteins. the fiber protein of BtAdV 250-A is long (533 amino acids [aa]) but it is 9 aa shorter than the CAdV-2 fiber. analysis of the BtAdV 250-A genome revealed the presence of an additional ORF (numbered as 32) in the E4 region close to the right terminal end of the genome. the locality of the 10.6K ORF (between the ITR and the last gene) suggested that it was a good candidate for a new gene. mass spectrometry of purified BtAdV 250-A virions showed at least six prominent, discrete bands ranging from approximately 10 to 100 kDa in estimated molecular mass. each band was excised from SYPRO Ruby-stained SDS gels (10% Tris-glycine gels for bands of >20 kDa and 10 to 20% Tris-Tricine gels for bands of 20 kDa) the mastadenovirus particle is reported to the estimated molecular masses for the cleaved products of the BtAdV 250-A pIIIa, pVI, and pVIII, along with the core pVII protein, were based on the conserved protease cleavage sites identified in HAdVs. however, the pIIIa protein does not contain the N-terminal LXGX-G site found in HAdVs (42) but rather a homologous only peptides corresponding to the 24.7-kDa fragment were detected in the band. the lowest band (migrating at approximately 10 kDa) contained peptides corresponding to the minor capsid proteins VIII (ca. 4.5, 7.7, and 12.2 kDa) and IX (ca. 10.8 kDa) the surface rendition of the BtAdV 250-A capsid showed a prototypical mastadenovirus morphology (Fig. 4A), with a penton protein present at each of the 12 5-fold axes. the base stalk of the elongated fiber (that extends from the center of the penton) visible. a 3-D reconstruction of the BtAdV 250-A capsid was calculated. an asymmetric unit is highlighted (white) with the axes of icosahedral symmetry denoted by an oval (2-fold), triangle (3-fold), and a pentagon (5-fold) only a short portion of the fiber (Fi) protein, shown extending from the penton base at the 5-fold axis, could be reconstructed due to its flexible nature. protein IX extends outward from the capsid similar to CAdV-2 (36) but more pronounced and is also reminiscent of the extensive protrusion of LH3 observed in the Ovine atadenovirus D (OAdV D) serotype 7 capsid (44) protein IX in BtAdV protrudes well beyond the hexon proteins. the five peripentonal hexons (purple) surround a single tulip-shaped penton base. the central section of the superimposed structures of BtAdV 250-A (light blue) and CAdV-2 (dark blue) reveal overlapping internal structural similarities between the viruses. a similar relationship to the penton phylogeny was found when analyzing a set of BtAdVs from Asia (China) and Europe (Germany, Spain) using the hexon gene. the most striking feature of the hexon tree was that BtAdV 250-A forms a monophyletic group with CAdVs, along with BtAdV A, BtAdV B, and a greater noctule bat (Ny bootstrap values (>70%) are shown for key nodes. the structural location of the penton and hexon proteins in the BtAdV capsid are shown. hexon tree is rooted using the more divergent sequence of Murine mastadenovirus A (MAdV A) closely related viruses (CAdV-1, CAdV-2, SkAdV-1, EAdV-1, EAdV-2, TSAdV-1, and BAdV-3) were also included. titers over 107.0 TCID50/ml were observed in primate (monkey), carnivore (dog, fox), and marsupial (opossum) cells over the 10-day time course. titers over 107.0 TCID50/ml were observed in primate (monkey), carnivore (dog, fox), and marsupial (opossum) cells over the 10-day time course. in the carnivore cell lines tested (dog, fox, and ferret cells), CAdV reached the highest titer in gray fox cells (106.2 TCID50/ml), the species from which the virus was isolated. the recognition that both BtAdV and CAdV replicated in bat cells further reiterates their likely close phylogenetic relationship. BtAdV 250-A replicated efficiently in cells derived from a phylogenetically diverse group of mammals, including primates and a marsupial species (opossum) the data shown are from multistep single growth curve experiments performed in triplicate, with error bars indicating the standard deviation. bat 250-B had similar gross and microscopic lesions, including malnutrition, a focus of round to oblong fungal spores mixed with keratinic debris in the patagium. no Pseudogymnoascus species were isolated. fluorescent antibody testing for rabies virus on brain samples was negative for both bats. hexon protein comprises the bulk of the adenovirus capsid. 12 hexons form each of the 20 icosahedral facets of the particle. brain, trachea, and heart samples from bat 250-A negative for virus isolation. the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) are 239 nt in length, within the range of other mastadenoviruses (93 to 371 nt) (1). the total genomic organization of BtAdV 250-A is shown. genes that are believed to be spliced are indicated by two genetic elements. the virus sharing the highest degree of amino acid identity to BtAdV 250-A for each protein is underlined. a lowercase \u201cp\u201d preceding a protein's name indicates a precursor form of the protein that is subsequently cleaved by the AVP. the BtAdV 250-A genome shared nucleotide identities of 72.7% to BtAdV A and 68.7% to CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. the hexon protein had the highest amino acid conservation (87.7 to 90.4% identity) whereas the E4 ORF C protein was the most divergent sequence (20.9 to 49.2% identity). the BtAdV 250-A penton did not contain an Arg-Gly-Asp motif. the fiber protein of BtAdV 250-A is long (533 amino acids [aa]), although it is 9 aa shorter than the CAdV-2 fiber. tAdVs from china contain three E3 region genes: 12.5K, E3ls, and E3l, the latter being the largest adenovirus protein reported to date. the functional roles of the E3 proteins in these viruses are currently unknown. a number of the genes in the E4 region are unique to mastadenoviruses. the protein's short length (93 aa) and predicted central transmembrane domain are potentially suggestive of a viroporin-like or other ancillary small viral transmembrane protein (40) future work will be aimed at determining if a protein is indeed expressed from this ORF and what its potential function may be. mass spectrometric analysis of purified virions identified all seven capsid proteins. in infectious virions, three of these proteins\u2014IIIa, VI, and VIII\u2014are cleaved from precursor (p) forms by the AVP. the estimated molecular masses for the cleaved products of the BtAdV 250-A pIIIa, pVI, and pVIII were based on the conserved protease cleavage sites identified protein VI (ca. 1.4, 3.4, and 24.7 kDa for the cleavage products) migrated between the 25- and 37-kDa markers. as expected, only peptides corresponding to the 24.7-kDa fragment were detected in the band. the predicted terminal 256-IVGV-G-261 cleavage site in protein VI (42) was confirmed. the lower band in the central group of triplet bands was a mixture of fiber and penton proteins (estimated molecular masses of 56.1 and 54.5 kDa), respectively. a 3-D reconstruction of the BtAdV 250-A capsid was calculated. the fourier shell correlation curve indicated a resolution of 17.9 at a Fourier shell correlation of 0.5. the surface-rendered map is colored according to radius (key) to illustrate the topology of the capsid. only a short portion of the fiber (Fi) protein, shown extending from the penton base at the 5-fold axis, could be reconstructed due to its flexible nature. map of human mastadenovirus C (HAdV C) serotype 5 (HAdV-5) was rendered. the three maps revealed similar morphologies of prototypical adenovirus particles. protein IX in BtAdV (protein designation based on the CAdV-2 structure [36]) was noticeably prominent. the surface-rendered maps of BtAdV 250-A, CAdV A (serotype CAdV-2) and human mastadenovirus C (HAdV C; serotype HAdV-5) are colored according to radius (key) to illustrate similar topologies. protein IX in BtAdV protrudes well beyond the hexon proteins. a similar relationship to the penton phylogeny was found when analyzing a set of BtAdVs from Asia (China) and Europe (Germany, Spain) using the hexon gene. the most striking feature of the hexon tree was that BtAdV 250-A forms a monophyletic group with CAdVs. suborder Megachiroptera clustered with viruses recovered from microbats in the hexon tree. bootstrap values (>70%) are shown for key nodes. structural location of the penton and hexon proteins in the BtAdV capsid are shown in the central inset. the tree is rooted using the more divergent sequence of Murine mastadenovirus A (MAdV A) closely related viruses (CAdV-1, CAdV-2, SkAdV-1, EAdV-1, EAdV-2, TSAdV-1, and BAdV-3) were also included in the analysis. BtAdV 250-A replicated efficiently in fox fibroblast (FoLu), dog fibroblast (A72), ferret fibroblast (Mpf), opossum epithelial (OK), monkey epithelial (Vero E6), and bat epithelial (Tb1Lu) cells. ers over 107.0 TCID50/ml were observed in primate (monkey), carnivore (dog, fox), and marsupial (opossum) cells over the 10-day time course. in contrast, CAdV replicated efficiently (>105.0 TCID50/ml) in the carnivore cell lines tested (dog, fox, and ferret cells), reaching the highest titer in gray fox cells (106.2 TCID50/ BtAdV 250-A replicated efficiently in cells derived from a phylogenetically diverse group of mammals, including primates and a marsupial species (opossum) the data shown are from multistep single growth curve experiments performed in triplicate, with error bars indicating the standard deviations. in accordance with these designations, we propose that BtAdV 250-A be recognized as a new species, similar to the recently identified BtAdVs from china (32). adenovirus evolution has long been thought to result from virus-host codivergence, but on occasion viral transfer to a new host is followed by successful adaptation and sustained spread. phylogenetic results are clearly compatible with the cross-species transfer of an adenovirus from bats to carnivores. the large number of bat sequences in the data set and the absence of those from other species may indicate a potential ascertainment bias. recent surveillance studies in china and Hungary have identified viruses in bats that appear to be more similar to CAdVs. most adenovirus infections in bats appear mild or inapparent (17, 23, 28) but one notable exception among the mastadenoviruses is CAdV A. it may induce severe clinical manifestations such as encephalitis, paralysis, hepatitis, ocular lesions, and respiratory disease in its normal carnivore hosts (e.g., dogs, wolves, foxes, skunks, bears, and otters) the reconstruction allowed for a direct comparison between the BtAdV 250-A and CAdV-2 capsids to better understand the overall structural changes imparted during their evolution. a similar topology is observed in LH3 of OAdV-7, the atadenovirus equivalent of protein IX, where LH3 forms prominent knobs on the surface of the virus. the elongated fiber in CAdV-2 has been suggested to contain 18.5 repeats (15 to 21 aa per repeat) the longest repeats (hinge regions) likely impart greater flexibility that may aid in subsequent integrin binding by the penton and increase infectivity (36, 68) if the fiber proteins of BtAdVs use the CAR to infect cells, as does CAdV-2 (69), is currently unknown. a leu-Asp-Val motif was present in protein IIIa, a minor cement protein that was abundant in BtAdV 250-A capsids. bats are now being recognized as reservoir hosts for both RNA and DNA viruses. they may also aid in the discovery of novel unorthodox adenovirus vectors for use in human therapeutics. future research by disease ecologists and virologists should be coupled with the aims of bat conservationists. samples of brain, heart, trachea, and gastrointestinal tract from the bats were taken for attempts at virus isolation. samples were mechanically homogenized in 650 l of minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 400 U/ml penicillin, 400 g/ml streptomycin and 1 g/ml amphotericin B. supernatant was harvested at day 4 postinfection and clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 4,400 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. gradient was centrifuged at 169,000 g for 4 h at 4\u00b0C using a Beckman SW 32 Ti rotor in an Optima L-100K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, CA) multiple genome assemblies were generated with the Velvet genome assembler (75), using k-mer sizes ranging from 33 to 65. the most complete assembly (k-mer 53) constructed an adenovirus into a single segment of 30,386 nt. the ends of the genome were filled in using primers based on the newly assembled 250-A genome. an aliquot of CsCl-purified BtAdV 250-A virions was subjected to SDS-PAGE to visualize electrophoretic profiles of structural proteins. the virions were stained with a protein gel stain excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by nano-HPLC-MS/MS. imaging was done under cryo conditions with a Gatan 626 cryo holder in a 200kV JEOL 2100 LaB6 transmission electron microscope (Peabody, MA) data were collected under low-dose imaging conditions on a Gatan Ultrascan US4000 CCD, calibrated with a MAG*I*CAL (Ted Pella, Inc.) calibration standard. the penton data set contained sequences of all species of the genus Mastadenovirus approved by the ICTV. eight additional proposed mastadenoviruses\u2014BtAdV 250-A, TMAdV ECC-2011, a skunk adenovirus (SkAdV-1, isolate PB1) (37), and five new BtAdVs (isolates WIV9 to WIV13) were also included in the analysis. phylogenetic trees of both data sets were then estimated using the maximum-likelihood method available within the PhyML program (82). Phylogenetic trees of both data sets were then estimated using the maximum-likelihood method available within the PhyML program (82). all cells were grown in MEM with 5% fetal bovine serum (growth media) each well was infected with an MOI of 0.01 tissue culture infection dose 50 (TCID50)/cell. the complete genome of BtAdV 250-A has been deposited in NCBI GenBank under accession number KX871230. on 21 July 2009, three Rafinesque's big-eared bats were found dead at a known maternity roost in an abandoned building. a postmortem gross and microscopic examination was conducted on the three carcasses. samples of major organs were collected and tested for virus isolation. DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and tested by PCR using degenerate adenovirus primers targeting a conserved stretch of the DNA Pol gene (5\u2032-CYTTGTCTGCYTTTTCYTTSGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TATGACATMTGYGGMATGTAYGC-3\u2032) purified virus (250-A) isolated from the Rafinesque's big-eared bat was a novel adenovirus. aliquots were frozen at 80\u00b0C until further use. genome assemblies were generated using k-mer sizes ranging from 33 to 65. the molecular weights of BtAdV 250-A proteins were predicted using the ProtParam tool on the ExPASy server. potential conserved motifs and protein topologies in putative new genes were assessed by using Quick2D in the Max Planck Institute bioinformatics toolkit. a 3.5-l aliquot of virus was placed on a continuous carbon supported Quantifoil grid (Jena, Germany) and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. a 3.5-l aliquot of virus was placed on a continuous carbon supported Quantifoil grid. 1,592 particles were extracted from 383 micrographs using a box size of 450 in EMAN/1.9 (78) using 1,109 particles, a structure with a resolution of 17.9 was produced after 20 iterations in auto3dem (79). Continuing the reconstruction or using a more stringent particle selection option (85% of the selected particles) did not further improve the reconstruction. the hexon gene data set comprised 35 BtAdVs, along with viruses that were most closely related to BtAdVs from the penton phylogeny. the homologous sequence from Murine mastadenovirus A (MAdV A) was used as an outgroup to root the penton tree. the CAdV 24-05 isolate (serotype 1) was recovered from the liver of a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) with infectious canine hepatitis sampled in 2005 (83). the two viruses could replicate in cells derived from species outside of the orders Chiroptera and Carnivora. each well was infected with an MOI of 0.01 tissue culture infection dose 50 (TCID50)/cell. Virus was allowed to absorb to the cells for 2 h; the inocula were then removed. wells were harvested at 2-day intervals for 10 days and frozen at 80\u00b0C until further processing."}
