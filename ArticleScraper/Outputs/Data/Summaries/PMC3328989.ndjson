{"summary": "the virus was grown in vero E6 cells (ATCC: C1008) in the Environmental Health Institute, national environmental agency, Singapore. infection of the cells grown on coverslips and subsequent fixation (5% glutaraldehyde) of the infected cells at appropriate times were performed. the nanoScope IV MultiMode atomic force microscope was used. only fixed and gold-coated samples were used for this study. cells and Virus SARS-CoV was grown in vero E6 cells. cells on the coverslips were incubated in 37\u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide. they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before being postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. cells on the coverslips were subjected to critical point drying for 1.5 h. scanning electron and atomic force microscopy images showed that the uninfected Vero cells were flat and without prominent form and surface (Figure 1). Pseudopodia, where present, were not extensive (Figure 1A and B). morphologic change is the proliferation of psuedopodia at the cell periphery (arrows) some cells appear to have large amount of extracellular virus on the cell surface. neighboring cells seem deprived of extracelluar virus particles. electron microscopy of vero E6 cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus at 24 h after infection. progeny virus are being extruded from or attached to numerous pseudopodia on infected cell surface (arrows) arrows indicate virus particles being exported from the surface of the pseudopodia. the thickened edges of infected cells were ruffled and appeared to comprise layers of folded membranes. the thickened edges of the cells were ruffled and appeared to comprise layers of folded membranes. atomic force microscopy of vero cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus. high activity of virus extrusion at thickened edge of infected cells. arrows indicate virus particles. amplitude images clearly show the cytoskeletal filaments parallel to the cell edge. recent studies (10,11) showed the entry events and prolific growth of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. atomic force microscope is gaining popularity in areas of life science research. the scanning electron microscopy studies showed prolific SARS-CoV on infected cell surface 15 hours after infection. the scanning techniques allow cell and virus surfaces to be viewed without invasive manipulation. the scanning techniques allow cell and virus surfaces to be viewed without invasive manipulation. the forces resulting from the vectorial growth of the actin filaments contributed to membrane bending at the site of virus maturation. Actin filaments have also been reported to be directly involved in the budding of both enveloped DNA and RNA viruses."}
