{"summary": "participants with acute respiratory infection from 30 households collected and returned a self-collected nasal swab via mail. results Nearly all (96.8%, n=30/31) households agreed to participate; 100% reported returning the sample. the use of self-swabbing in a low-income, minority, urban population has not been assessed. first, it is a population at high risk for infection and transmission due to overcrowding. second, being low-income, Latino, publicly insured, foreign born are factors associated with lower likelihood of having primary health care provider and seeking care for illness. volunteers were provided with a self-swab kit and a pre-addressed mailer. participants were advised that if the swab was not sent the day it was obtained, it should be stored in the refrigerator. each participant received a round-trip New York City MetroCard (value US$5.00) self-swabs positive for the same pathogen as the corresponding swab obtained by research staff were calculated. the sensitivity of the self-swab using the research swab as the gold standard was assessed. 0 (0.0) 0.42 5\u201317 9 (30.0) 9 (31.0) 6 (33.3) 5 (33.3) 1 (33.3) 18 15 (50.0) 14 (48.3) 7 (38.9) 5 (33.3) 2 (66.7) Female 25 (83.3) 24 (82.8) 16 (88.9) 13 (86.7) 3 (100.0) 0.50 Male 5 (16.7) 5 (17.2) 2 (11.1) 2 (13.3) 0 (0.0) English proficiency of person obtaining swab Limited 20 (6 corresponding self-swabs were concordant with the research swab for non-influenza pathogens. the kappa statistic between research and self-swab was 0.84. there were no differences in demographic variables, including education level or days between drop-off and receipt of swabs. a one influenza self-swab was not received by mail; b two corresponding self-swabs were positive for influenza A, but not subtypable. c one self-swab detected a coinfection with parainfluenza that was not captured by the research team. the use of self-swabbing is feasible and acceptable in a low-income, urban community. in studies conducted during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, up to 28% of those infected were asymptomatic. however, there are few data available on asymptomatic infection for seasonal influenza and other respiratory pathogens. self-swabbing was acceptable in a low-income, urban minority population. self-swabbing was feasible in a low-income, urban minority population."}
