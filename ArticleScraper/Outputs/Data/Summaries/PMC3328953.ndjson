{"summary": "integrative medicine was established in the 1980s under the guidance of \"system learning, comprehensively mastering, sorting, and improving,\" predecessors of integrative medicine have been exploiting the complementary advantages of macro and micro, global and local, structure and function, traditional and modern, disease differentiation and syndrome differentiation in WM and TCM. clinical achievements of the past 30 years are described as follows. a seminar on the academician Chen Keji's academic thinking about the new mode of disease-syndrome combination and its application in clinical practice was held in Beijing on may 23, 2011. the emphasis of the new mode could be played on either syndrome or disease. definite therapeutic targets and stable curative effect compared with syndrome differentiation mode alone. the new mode has vital guidance value for treatment and prognosis judgment. heart disease showed that the blood stasis syndrome score was significantly correlated to the maximum stenosis degree and coronary lesion score demonstrated by coronary angiography before percutaneous coronary intervention. the correlation was increased along with the increasing of the patients' age and the course of the disease. the first is blood stasis syndrome theory and the clinical application of the method of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. academician Chen Keji advocated treating coronary heart disease by activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis principally. a randomized controlled trial showed that the restenosis rate in XSC group treated by XSC on the basis of routine western therapy was decreased by 45% compared with routine western therapy group. the experimental studies showed that XSC could suppress the gene expression of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [16\u201319] the second study is the theory of dispelling interior pathogenic factors and purgation and its application in the treatment of acute abdomen. arsenous acid is the first antileukemia drug of inducing apoptosis in the world. it became the first antileukemia drug of inducing apoptosis in the world. it was honored as \"ancient remedy performs new tricks\" in 1996. restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention and myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) were closely related to blood stasis syndrome. a prospective randomized controlled study was carried out on RS after PCI. the pathogenesis of MIRI during open heart surgery is deficiency of heart qi in the origin and excess of heart blood stasis and internal turbid toxin in the superficiality. the therapeutic principles are boosting qi and nourishing heart, activating blood circulation and resolving toxin simultaneously. a new strategy of \"bacteria, bacterial toxin, and inflammatory mediator treated simultaneously\" was put forward on the basis of the theory of \"bacteria and bacterial toxin treated simultaneously\" chronic hepatitis B is the common disease in china, as well as in the world. some scholars put forward the hypothesis that liver fibrosis and early liver cirrhosis can be reversed. they found out that the basic pathogenesis of liver fibrosis is weakened body resistance and blood stasis. so therapeutic method of strengthening body resistance and dispelling stasis was established, and a new drug for treating liver fibrosis was developed. theory has a remarkable effect in alleviating symptoms such as dry mouth in hyperpyrexic consumption of yin syndrome and deficiency of both qi and yin syndrome caused by head and neck cancer after radiotherapy. the new model of combining TCM and modern cancer treatment has attracted widespread attention in the world. Indigo Tablets were 10\u201315% higher than that of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) median remission time was 48 months with recurrence rate only 14.86%. 10-year survival probability was 75.38%. since the 1970s, the basic syndrome of type 2 diabetes included yin deficiency with internal excessive heat, deficiency of both qi and yin. heology and blood flow, lowering triglycerides, and malondialdehyde. effect of Xian Zhen tablet includes lowering blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin, decreasing urine protein excretion, improving renal function. 65% of the death cases are due to complicating with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 243 patients with vitiligo were treated by modified Tao Hong Si Wu decoction. the total effective rate was 68.2%, the mechanism of which was related to upregulation of tyrosinase activity, increasing the melagenine content, and promoting melanocyte proliferation. disease-syndrome combination mainly refers to absorbing the idea and theory of disease differentiation in western medicine (WM) as well as syndrome differentiation in TCM. it has complementary advantages of WM and WM and marks a new era created by integrative medicine in clinical researches. the emphasis of the mode could be played on either syndrome or disease. effective therapeutic plans should be formulated according to disease differentiation. the new mode is beneficial to the original innovation in diagnosis and treatment. we are the first to study and report on blood stasis syndrome in coronary heart disease based on the new mode. 19 items such as precordial pain, dark purple tongue color, and erythrocyte deformability were selected based on the calculation analysis of 48 kinds of examination items. 6 items giving the greatest contribution to diagnosis such as blood viscosity and total cholesterol were confirmed by a stepwise regression analysis for 21 items. clinical efficacy scale of TCM syndrome and primitive entry pool of scale for patient-reported outcomes of coronary heart disease were established by the hall for workshop of metasynthetic engineering. the first is blood stasis syndrome theory and the clinical application of the method of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Objectified study of abdomen diagnosis on blood stasis syndrome was superior to the research methods of japan in the same period. the essence of blood stasis syndrome and mechanism of treating coronary heart disease by activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis had been elucidated. researches included the effects of dispelling interior pathogenic factors and purgation on the splanchnic blood flow and caecal single smooth muscle cell. the effects of purgative herbs on information transmission mechanism of immune cells through four times of different scale joint research in the seventh to tenth five-year plan period. the theory is a traditional simple understanding of hypertoxic drug treating difficult and complicated diseases. arsenous acid became the first antileukemia drug of inducing apoptosis in the world arousing the medical research fever of arsenic trioxide. 12 patients with recurrence of APL after conventional chemotherapies were treated with AS2O3. 11 cases of them relieved completely in 1996. the incidence of clinical end-point event was significantly lower in the XSC group than that in the control group. XSC had a wide range of therapeutic effects including effectively preventing RS after PCI in combination with conventional western medical treatment. e injection could reduce the content of MDA and myocardial enzymes' release and improve the activity of SOD, NO, and NOS. boosting qi combined with activating blood circulation superior to those simple boosting qi, activating blood circulation, resolving toxin, and boosting qi combined with activating blood circulation. chronic hepatitis B is the common disease in china, as well as in the world. the progression of chronic hepatitis B may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. tumor treatment model by integrative medicine emphasizes contriving individual treatment plan and evaluation standard on the basis of biological characteristics and the course of disease. malignant tumors could be treated by TCM therapies such as reinforcing the vital energy and consolidating the constitution. 155 cases of APL patients were treated by the Compound Realgar Natural Indigo Tablets. the remission rate was 97.42% after treating for 6 months. no side effect, serious infection, bleeding, and DIC were found. researches of Tang wei Kang capsule treating early diabetic nephropathy and Tang Xin Ping treating diabetic cardiopathy have gotten progress. some scholars also found out that blood stasis was another significant pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes due to the changes of hemorheology with different degree were found. they advocated treating the disease by promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis principally. acute pancreatitis is treated by expelling pathogens by purgation. the average cure rate reached 97%, while the average cure rate of severe pancreatitis was 80%. the mortality has reached the lowest level compared with our country and abroad. 524 patients of SARS in china were divided into integrative medicine treatment group (n = 318) and western medicine treatment group (n = 206) the existence rates for the symptoms of weakness, short breath, dyspnea in the first group were significantly lower than that in the second group after treatment. short breath, dyspnea, and muscle aching pain were averagely shortened by 2 days, 1 day, and 2 days. the prospects of integrative medicine is brightening in treatment for coronary stent thrombosis and protecting the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. in addition, as viral infectious disease belonged to the category of epidemic febrile disease in TCM thousands years ago, Chinese ancients had accumulated rich experience. occurrence and mortality of cardiovascular disease is still increasing in our country. if risk factors were controlled as early as possible, 80% of the disease can be prevented effectively, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes. the theory is profound, classical, and concise, combining with clinical practice is the unique way to understand the connotation. in the clinical practice, dysfunction of the large intestine conduction could cause no descending of the lung qi, conversely, no descending of the lung qi. china is a great power with rich herb resources, according to the records in Formula Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine. the classical prescriptions and herbs provided with definite clinical indications are of more meaning to be developed. the effective fractions and monomers extracted from Chinese herbs had obtained reliable clinical benefits. sandra chinensis could decrease the ALT and AST activity. ginsenoside, total puerarin flavonoids, polyporus umbellate polysaccharides, ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide, anisodamine, tanshinone, trichosanthin, tetrahydropalmatine, tetrandrine, rubidate, ilexonin A, and ferulic on pathogenesis is the core idea of syndrome differentiation, while clinical medication based on formula syndrome is not exactly the same as it. the theory of formula corresponding to syndrome attaches great importance to the objective indications of herbs, which comes from long-term, large-scale and repeated clinical trials by ancients. despite great advancements in the fields of basic and clinical researches made by modern medicine, there are still some issues to be resolved. the prospects of integrative medicine is brightening in treatment for coronary stent thrombosis and protecting the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. concrete measures of \u201cmoving prevention and control strategy forward\u201d include concept forward, funding forward, emphasis of the researches forward, and measures to be carried out forward. it could reduce the incidence of the major diseases from the origin and effectively control the medical expense and save resources in medicine and health. the aim is to fully digest the traditional Chinese medicine, and apply it to modern medical system. the first is further understanding of the essence in TCM, while giving up the dross. the second is illustrating the mechanism of the traditional therapy. china is a great power with rich herb resources, according to the records in Formula Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine. the classical prescriptions and herbs provided with definite clinical indications are of more meaning to be developed. at present, the effective fractions and monomers extracted from Chinese herbs had obtained reliable clinical benefits. biphenyl dicarboxylate (DDB) extracted from Schisandra chinensis could decrease ALT and AST activity. ginsenoside, total puerarin flavonoids, polyporus umbellate polysaccharides, ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides, anisodamine, tanshinone, trichosanthin, tetrahydropalmatine, rubidate, ilexonin clinical medication based on pathogenesis is the core idea of syndrome differentiation, while clinical medication based on formula syndrome is not exactly the same as it. the theory of formula corresponding to syndrome attaches great importance to the objective indications of herbs. integrative medicine will obtain great achievements in creating new medicine and pharmacology. the combination of both WM and TCM will make tremendous contributions for the great rejuvenation of the nation and human health care."}
