{"summary": "the world health organization has confirmed 2279 cases of human infections with MERS-CoV in 27 countries since 2012. 806 (35%) infected patients have died as of Feb. 13, 2019. 80% of the cases have been reported to occur there. three MERS-CoV proteins are expressed on the envelope of the virus. the surface spike protein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M) and the envelope protein (E) the S protein is responsible for viral entry via attachment to and fusion with the host cell membrane. there is currently no effective prophylaxis or therapy for MERS-CoV. mechanisms of immune response triggered by MERS-CoV infection and immune evasion strategies have not been fully studied. this ability may contribute substantially to the high case-fatality rates of MERS-CoV-infected patients, especially those immunocompromised. the protective signaling role through TLR-4/TRIF may be considered a distinctive feature in the pathogenesis of some coronaviruses. using special adjuvants as agonists for TLR-4 and TLR-3 plus the expressed MERS-CoV-S protein may help to improve the immunogenicity against MERS-CoV infection. TLR-3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. the production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) infected with MERS-CoV exhibit no expression of IFN-, despite the marginally early expression of IFN-. a recent study failed to stimulate the proinflammatory innate response and failed to produce type I IFNs in vitro in cultured infected cells. MPA was shown to enhance IFN-stimulated gene expression. this suggests MPA is dependent on modulation of expression of IFN-stimulated genes. the FDA has approved the use of both IFN- and MPA for other indications. the persistence of MCP-1 and CXCL10 has a negative impact on the expression of IL12 and IFN. however, the persistence of IL12 and Th2 cytokine expression profiles has a negative impact on the antiviral Th1-mediated effects. the role of T cells but not B cells in controlling and fine-tuning the pathogenesis and outcomes of MERS-CoV infection were studied. both activated CD8 cells and anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were crucial for the clearance of the initial infection. antiviral effects of depleted cells may be important during later infection time points. virus invades the immune system and downregulates MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD80/86 in antigen-presenting cells. these events may further impair the functions of B cells and T cells via downregulation of the DPP4 receptors. 17 cells produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL17 via the STAT3 and NF-B signaling pathways. these cytokines can recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection or inflammation. detection of specific antibodies to MERS-CoV in human serum is considered one of the confirmative diagnoses for infection with MERS-CoV. anti-MERS-CoV antibodies are not cross-protective with heterologous viruses. a previous study found that antibodies recovered from the serum of some convalescent SARS patients might cross-react with MERS-CoV or neutralize it [61]. the neutralizing antibody titers at 34 months of infection in 86% of human serum samples were the same as those after 13 months of infection. the low titer of antibodies in a few patients is attributed to viral shedding and persistence at the site of infection. however, the long-term persistence of antibodies in most patients might be explained by the MERS-CoV infection inducing long-lived memory B cells. anti-MERS-CoV antibodies may be used as a valuable indication for viral diagnosis. a serum sample that is positive for specific antibodies would serve as a confirmative diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV antibodies were crucial for the clearance of the initial infection and protection against a subsequent challenge with the virus. this finding implies that the response to MERS-CoV generally occurs through antibody-mediated immunity. the protection was due to an antibody-dependent (and not T cell-dependent) response. a recent study reported that CD4+ helper T cells were more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection promotes the induction of Th17 cytokines. these cytokines can recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection or inflammation. coronaviruses express surface spike glycoproteins, which stimulate the antibody response. these antibodies may be used for targeting spike proteins and blocking the entry of the virus into host cells [60]. no vaccine for either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is available in the market. the antibody against spike protein was optimal for screening. 29.5% of serum samples isolated from dromedary camels were positive. 93.4% of samples were positive when tested by rELISA. serum samples collected on the day of dam parturition had a high level of specific anti-MERS-CoV antibodies, but in calves, the antibodies were not detectable. the result may explain the survival of MERS-CoV in these calves, and serum IgG antibodies may not be sufficient for protective immunity. MVA-MERS-CoV-S-specific neutralizing antibody titers were highly detectable after either a single immunization (day 21) or booster immunization (day 40) with a dose of 107 or 108 plaque forming units (PFUs) compared to previous studies of SARS-CoV [74], these high antibody levels were efficient in blocking the epitopes of MERS-CoV spike protein. the booster vaccination increased the level of the MERS-S291-specific CD8+ T cell response by 3-fold [70] another study using an adenovirus type 5- (Ad5-) based vaccine showed the ability of this vaccine to induce systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immunity when administered via the i.m. or intragastric route. immunization of mice with an RBD-based vaccine by the i.m. route induces long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection [85]. targeting MERS-CoV-RBD protein-1 is one of the strategies for vaccine development [86]. a promising trend in the development of effective and safe MERS-CoV vaccines. the 358-588 RBD fragment was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits [89], whereas fragment 377-662 was effective in immunized mice [88]. the expression of the recombinant S377-662-Fc protein in the i.n. vaccine triggers the production of specific antibodies in mice through the s.c. route. gG in mice immunized with S377-662-Fc protein via both s.c. and i.n. routes was the same. after a single dose administered via the i.n. route, the level of IgG was relatively low. the titers of MERS-CoV-S1-specific IgG were high and persisted long term. alum and MF59 adjuvants can elicit antigen-specific antibodies and cellular-mediated responses. but alum alone cannot induce a potent Th1 response unless combined with another adjuvant. this cocktail will improve the effectiveness of the MERS-CoV-RBD-based subunit vaccines. i.m., s.c., and intradermal routes (i.d.) used for vaccine administration provide a good level of protection against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. this type of vaccine may elicit antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) by the nonneutralizing epitopes encoded by the S glycoprotein. the specific CD8+ T cells from the mouse spleen were stimulated with the MERS-CoV-S291 peptide. the booster vaccination increased the level of the MERS-S291-specific CD8+ T cell response by 3-fold. another study using an adenovirus type 5- (Ad5-) based vaccine expressing MERS-CoV-S proteins demonstrated the ability of this vaccine to induce systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immunity. studies have shown that the RBD-based subunit of the SARS-CoV vaccine is very effective and safer than the viral vector candidates [83, 84]. targeting MERS-CoV-RBD protein-1 is one of the strategies for vaccine development [86]. i.n. vaccination with a MERS-CoV-RBD-based subunit vaccine has a strong potential to induce a mucosal neutralizing IgA response against the RBD and MERS-CoV S proteins [87]. the 358-588 RBD fragment was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits [89], whereas fragment 377-662 was effective in immunized mice [88]. titers of MERS-CoV-S1-specific IgG were high and persisted long term. a specific cell-mediated immune response in the spleen of immunized mice was generated by the i.n. route. a strong specific IgG antibody response against RBD was generated by the i.m. route. alum and MF59 adjuvants can elicit antigen-specific antibodies and cellular-mediated responses. both alum and MF59 adjuvants can elicit antigen-specific antibodies. this cocktail will improve the effectiveness of the MERS-CoV-RBD-based vaccines. innate immune response is an important element of antiviral defense and adaptive immunity. a vaccine that enhances the induction of strong immunity via the i.n. route would be one of the best strategies to block MERS-CoV infection. each vaccine has an appropriate route of administration. selection of the optimal route of administration and the proper adjuvant with a specific, conserved antigen will play significant roles in MERS-CoV vaccine development."}
