{"summary": "world health organization estimates 25 million outpatient visits and 2 million hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus infections each year. rotaviruses belong to the family Reoviridae and their 11-segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome is encapsidated within a non-enveloped virion composed by three concentric protein layers. the outer layer is composed of two structural proteins, VP4 and VP7. several structural and non-structural virus-encoded proteins accumulate in viroplasms for participating in the formation of viroplasms. the newly assembled DLPs bud into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen where a transiently acquired envelope is later replaced by an outer protein layer. virions from infected cells take place either by cell lysis or by a non-classical, vesicular transport pathway. oxidative stress occurs when the production of ROS overwhelms the capacity of cellular antioxidant defenses to detoxify these potentially injurious species. excessive ROS and RNS have been linked to pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases. INTESTINAL REDOX BALANCE The mammalian gastrointestinal epithelium consists of five major cell types (enterocytes, mucus-secreting goblet cells, hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells, and tuft cells) the villus tip enterocytes at 4-5 d post-differentiation spontaneously undergo anoikis (apoptosis) before being shed into the gut lumen[27] the loss of intestinal homeostasis caused by oxidative stress in the mucosal and adjacent tissues can alter nutrient digestion and absorption, stem cell proliferation, enterocyte apoptosis, and immune response. INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE Innate immunity plays an important role in immediately controlling the pathogen invasion before induction of the mechanisms leading to an adaptive immune response. Activation of TLRs stimulates NF-B and IRF3/7 signaling leading to the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) IFN- and IFN-, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as pro-interleukin (IL)-1 and the activation of natural killer cells. the NLR family consists of 22 proteins in humans and 34 in mice[38] NF-B plays a role in the expression control of over 500 genes involved in immune inflammatory responses, acute-phase inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, oxidative stress responses, cell adhesion, differentiation, apoptosis, AIDS, atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis and metastasis[45,46]. the central role played by NF-B signal pathway in physiological and pathological conditions has made it a potential target for pharmacological intervention[45,47]. type II IFNs have a relatively modest effect in restricting early replication of homologous rotavirus strains in comparison with a higher effect on heterologous strains[57]. further studies are needed to assess the roles of TLRs and IFNs during the early infection by homologous and heterologous rotavirus strains. PDI redox activity can be inhibited by cell membrane-impermeant thiol/disulfide-reactive agents such as DTNB [5, 5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid]] and bacitracin[66,67]. PDI overexpression has been shown to produce an increase in NADPH oxidase activity. Hsc70 has been reported to protect cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis. it has been found to be associated with virus penetration via clathrin-mediated endocitosis. there is evidence that NF-B p65-induced cell proliferation is dependent on a NF-B p65-mediated decrease of Hsc70 levels. the conserved cysteine residues from the hepatitis delta virus have been shown to be essential for virus entry. it has been suggested that PDI family isomerases could be responsible for such thiol generation. cell surface PDI has been found to facilitate the infection of HeLa cells by mouse polyoma virus. membrane-impermeant thiol/disulfide-reactive agents and anti-PDI mAbs inhibit rotavirus infectivity at entry. antibody against these cysteine-containing VP7 or VP7 peptides significantly inhibited rotavirus infectivity. PDI can use at least these viral amino acid sequences for interacting with rotavirus structural proteins. structural proteins VP4 (VP5* and VP8*), VP6 and VP7[96,103] have been involved in different interactions with cell surface molecules during entry. this fact opens the way for the rational design of membrane-impermeant thiol/disulfide compounds able to specifically inhibit the virus entry into the host cell. integrin is directly bound by neuraminidase-sensitive and neuraminidase-insensitive strains through VP5*[104-106]. most commonly occurring human rotavirus strains use their VP8* subunit to interact with cell surface GM1 ganglioside containing the internal N-acetylneuraminic acid. this is in contrast with most animal rotaviruses that bind terminal sialic acids without using the sequence in which these post-binding interactions occur has not been established. the sequence of virion-cell interactions taking place after binding to 21 has not been established. several interactions involving rotavirus structural proteins and cell surface receptors have been documented. ion of rotavirus proteins (VP5*, VP7 and VP6) caused by cell surface-associated chaperone (Hsc70, PDI) and oxido-reductase activities (PDI, integrin v3) is depicted. it has been hypothesized that a conformational transition from a dimer to a folded-back trimer of VP5* would facilitate the interaction of VP5* with the lipid bilayer VP5* interacts with VP4 through the domains aa 642-658[8] and aa 531-554[103]. there are studies showing that DLPs interact physically with Hsc70 at least through the VP6 sequence aa 280-297. these mAbs have been shown to inhibit PDI activity by 49% to 90%. bacitracin greatly inhibited PDI-TLP interaction in vitro. PDI, Hsc70 and integrin v3 have been found to interact in rafts. rotavirus infection up-regulated the expression of integrins 21 and 2. dengue virus serotype 2 induces up-regulation of integrin 3. PDI expression has been shown to be required and up-regulated by rotavirus infection. cell surface reducing PDI can induce conformational changes in VP5* and VP7 priming them for further interactions and entry. redox status changes could be induced by oxidoreductase and thiol/disulfide isomerase activities present in integrins IIb3 and v3. VP5* contains five conserved cysteines at positions 203, 216, 318, 380 and 774. it has been shown for simian RRV and SA11 that their VP4 contains two disulfide bonds residing in the VP8* (Cys-203/Cis-216) and VP5* (Cys-318/Cis-380) domains. research aims at unraveling the mechanisms involved in rotavirus entry is very critical for understanding versatility of rotaviruses in using different cell surface receptors. however, the accumulated findings on rotavirus entry mechanisms suggest that rotavirus structural proteins undergo conformational changes mediated by cell surface chaperone and thiol-disulfide activities. the mechanisms involved in this inter-conversion are not entirely composed by the same reactions in opposite directions. those aimed at removing VP4 and VP7 from TLPs to generate DLPs and those aimed at coating DLPs to generate TLPs are unknown. rotavirus DLPs are recoated in vitro with recombinant outer proteins. VP8* is supposed to be released from VP5* before cell membrane destabilization. PDI can produce in vitro modifications in the redox status of VP4 and VP7. VP7 maturation in the ER lumen has been reported to involve oxidation reactions caused by the oxidant PDI to generate intra-molecular disulfide bonds. oxidized VP7 has been shown to be required to remove the transient lipid envelope in a calcium-dependent process to generate mature TLPs. modifying the redox status of VP7 in the endosomal membrane would be useful to determine the potential participation of redox reactions during generation of DLPs in vivo. interaction between the outer capsid proteins (VP4 and VP7) and PDI has been demonstrated in vitro and also the generation of free thiol groups in these proteins after this interaction. a better understanding of the involvement of thiol-disulphide exchange in the rotavirus infection process could facilitate the identification of potential targets of therapeutic strategies. a better understanding of the involvement of thiol-disulphide exchange in the rotavirus infection process could facilitate the identification of potential targets of therapeutic strategies. mRNA in murine ileum and iNOS expression also reported in ileum. increased NO metabolites were also observed in mice infected with rotavirus EDIM. viral infection stimulated NO production during the early phase of infection. acute gastroenteritis in piglets has been associated with increased levels of high-mobility group box 1 protein (a nuclear DNA-binding protein), and serum haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin which suggest an acute phase response. increased values of oxidative stress indices, including the malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO concentrations in serum have also been associated with pathological condition. ER stress of intestinal epithelial cells activates signaling pathways known as unfolded protein response (UPR) failure to resolve ER stress causes activation of apoptotic pathways that lead to cell death. failure to resolve ER stress causes activation of apoptotic pathways. the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen is required to ensure disulfide bond formation and avoid aggregation or unfolded protein accumulation in this compartment. the oxidative folding of proteins is facilitated by a family of ER oxidoreductases including ERp57 and PDI among others. reoxidation is performed by an enzyme that can use molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor. many viruses have been shown to cause ER stress and induce one or more branches of the UPR in the infected cells. some studies have shown that several viruses induce ER stress and UPR signaling but also modulate UPR for protecting the infected cells from ER stress-mediated death to ensure virus replication. ER stress in the rhesus monkey epithelial cell line MA104 activates two components of the UPR pathway. a single specific virus protein in RRV-infected MA104 cells did not trigger the activation of UPR. it was supposed that a multifactorial event involving either the budding of the DLPs into the ER, the formation of viroplasms, or the activation of genome replication could be the inducer. a number of stimuli and insults have been found to induce ER stress. the ER-induced UPR signaling has emerged as a central subject in the context of pathological processes including virus infections. the knowledge gained from UPR mechanisms could provide basis for antiviral development. high doses of NAC have proven to be synergistic with oseltamivir treatment in protecting mice from fatal influenza infection[237] a patient infected with the A/H1N1 influenza virus improved rapidly after treatment with a high-dose NAC therapy in combination with antiviral medication[239]. sensitivity of rotavirus infection to NAC has recently been demonstrated. a study that screened for drugs with the potential ability to interfere with cellular redox reactions found that infection of MA104 and Caco-2 cells with several rotavirus strains was significantly inhibited by NAC in both cell systems. NAC inhibits NF-B activation in Hela and L929 cells independently of its anti-oxidative function. it has been reported that NAC inhibits the expression of VCAM-1 by interfering with the binding of NF-B to the VCAM-1 B motif. inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways are intimately involved in the virus infection-associated pathogenesis. underlying mechanisms of NAC treatment of virus infections need further research to differentiate direct and indirect effects associated with its antioxidant ability. NF-B activation was blocked in cells infected with rotavirus strain OSU. results from this work showed that the SCF-TrCP E3 ligase was targeted for proteosome degradation by NSP1. most human group A rotaviruses encode NSP1s that contain a C-terminal recognition motif (DSGxS) for -transducing repeat-containing protein (-TrCP) studies on malnutrition and concomitant rotavirus infection in neonatal piglets have suggested an inflammatory response during rotavirus infection. malnutrition increased PGE2 response to rotavirus infection while prolonged diarrhea in rotavirus infected and malnourished piglets was found to be associated with more intense and sustained expression of local mediators or markers of intestinal inflammation. PPAR ligands have been found to downregulate the transcriptional activation of COX-2 through multiple mechanisms[277], including the inhibition of multiple steps of the NF-B pathway. evidence has been provided that rotavirus infectivity in MA104 and caco-2 cells and mice is significantly inhibited by NAC. PPAR- agonists have been highlighted as potential therapeutic tools due to their ability to down-regulate the inflammatory responses to respiratory virus-related pulmonary cellular innate response to rotavirus infection is schematized in Figure 3. rotavirus can early counteract signaling pathways of innate response by NSP1-mediated degradation of IRF3 and IRF7. the viroplasm, which includes some viral non-structural proteins (NSP2/5/6), can protect viral RNAs from being recognized by some pattern-recognition receptors involved in antiviral response. MIT, ER and PROT are indicated. several viruses-encoded functions are dedicated to controlling the cellular translation machinery. early in the infection process rotaviruses takes over the host cell translation machinery, inducing a shut off of host cell-directed protein synthesis. however, the presence of naked RNA in rotavirus infected cells as part of the viral cycle is an unresolved question[50] rotavirus ECwt infection of mice induce cellular proteins COX-2, ERp57, Hsc70, NF-B, Hsp70, PDI and PPAR in intestinal villus cells. evidence suggests rotavirus infection benefits from inducing oxidative stress and activating pro-inflammatory signaling in villus cells. PPAR agonists such as 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), ALA and DHA activate PPAR leading to inhibition of cytoplasmic NF-B. PPAR can heterodimerize with the RA-activated RXR for promoting transcription of anti-inflammatory genes. more studies are needed to understand the detailed mechanisms involved in the strategy by which rotaviruses induce the shutoff of host protein synthesis machinery. more studies are needed to understand the detailed mechanisms involved in the strategy by which rotaviruses induce the shutoff of host protein synthesis machinery. rotavirus structural proteins implicated in the early steps of the rotaviral life cycle are likely to be substrates of the cell surface molecules having oxidoreductase, thiol isomerase and chaperone activities. the fact that rotaviruses induce oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling opens a new way for treating the life-threatening rotavirus diarrhea and complementing vaccines."}
