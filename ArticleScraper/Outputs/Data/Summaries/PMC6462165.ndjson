{"summary": "many proteins/peptides have the disadvantage of poor stability, short half-life, and uncertain targeting ability. many polyethylene glycol-modified proteins/peptides have been approved by US FDA. the target ability of CS-ES2-AF was studied by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and bioimaging. CS-modified cisplatin displayed improved anti-cancer activity and reduced drug toxicity. glucocorticoids can prolong release time of the drug in vivo. CS is also a ligand of CD44, which can specifically target the CD44-overexpressed tumor cells. polypeptides and protein drugs are easily degraded in plasma, tissues, and cells by various metabolic enzymes in the body. the addition of CS could increase the tumor tissue-targeting ability of these drugs and increase their efficacy in vivo. in, and MTT were purchased from Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.

CS can specifically bind to CD44 on the surface of tumor cells. the IRs of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF on EA.hy926 endothelial cells were 9.72%0.51%, 12.75%1.20%, 18.66%2.26%, 25.72%3.55%, and 33.01%3.63%, respectively. the inhibitory rates of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF were similar (5 g/mL\u2013100 g/mL), which indicated that the activity of CS-ES2-AF was significantly better the aqueous solution forces the water molecules around the ES2-AF polypeptide to enhance the stability of ES2-AF. the results of the MTT assay are related to the state of endothelial cells and the degree of differentiation. cells with similar passage numbers should be selected for experiments. CS-ES2-AF could inhibit the endothelial cell metastasis more efficiently than ES2-AF. CS could inhibit the endothelial cell metastasis more efficiently than ES2-AF.

CS-ES2-AF inhibited the binding of VEGF to its receptor better than ES2-AF. compared to unmodified ES2-AF, modified CS-ES2-AF was more stable at 37\u00b0C. CS-ES2-AF flowed through the CM5 chip to generate dynamic sensing plots. the affinity kinetic parameters Ka (L/(mol s) and Kd (1/s) of the interaction of CD44 protein with CS-ES2-AF and ES2-AF were 6,846, 6.863105 and 0, 0, respectively. ES2-AF-FITC and CS-ES2-AF-FITC were administered by tail vein. the nude mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate. no fluorescence was observed in both groups at 0 hour. fluorescence signals in the other parts of the mice were weak. at 1, 2, and 4 hours, the fluorescence signal still appeared in the tumor site. almost no fluorescence appeared at the tumor site of the ES2-AF-FITC group. this is because glycosylation induces structural changes in the conjugates. this improves the drug\u2019s ability to resist hydrolysis by hydrolase enzymes, making it stable in the blood. 2-AF was lower than the ES2-AF group at 0.5 hour. the plasma concentrations were higher at the other time points. the results are shown as mean SD (n=5). polypeptide ES2-AF was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. the purity of polypeptide ES2-AF was 95.41% and the retention time was 7.750 min. CS was modified using TBA-OH to form the DMSO-soluble conjugate CS-TBA. 1H-NMR spectra of (B) CS, (C) CS-TBA, and (D) CS-ES2-AF was prepared. the yield was approximately 88%\u201393% (Figure 1A) ta potentials of CS-ES2-AF and ES2-AF were -34.004.53 mV and 7.504.07 mV respectively, indicating that the conjugation with CS enhanced the stability of ES2-AF in the system. this structure enables the peptide to be encapsulated in the CS-formed nanoparticles, avoiding the loss of activity caused by protease hydrolysis. the IRs of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF on EA.hy926 endothelial cells were 9.72%0.51%, 12.75%1.20%, 18.66%2.26%, 25.72%3.55%, and 33.01%3.63%, respectively. the inhibitory rates of ES2-AF and CS-ES2-AF were similar (5 g/mL\u2013100 g/mL), which indicated that the activity of CS-ES2-AF was significantly better the CS group in the aqueous solution forces the water molecules around the ES2-AF polypeptide to enhance the stability of ES2-AF. the results of the MTT assay are also related to the state of endothelial cells and the degree of differentiation. cells with similar passage numbers should be selected for experiments. new tab Effects of different samples on the inhibition of cell migration, tube formation, and CAM: (i) represents the ES2-AF sample; (ii) represents the CS-ES2-AF sample; and (iii) represents the CS&ES2-AF sample. tube formation assay was used to investigate the effects of ES2-AF, CS-ES2-AF, and CS&ES2-AF on blood vessel formation in EA.hy926 cells. a large number of tubes were formed in the control group after incubation for 8 hours. the effect of CS-ES2-AF on the inhibition of tube formation in endothelial cells is superior to that of ES2-AF. CAM test was used to study the effects of the drugs on angiogenesis in vivo. when the concentration was 10 g/mL, the activity of CS-ES2-AF was lower than that of the unmodified polypeptide ES2-AF. this might be due to the increase in stability of CS-ES2-AF in vivo, thereby improving the activity. the active fragment AF inhibited the binding of VEGF to its receptor. CS-ES2-AF inhibited the binding of VEGF to its receptor better than ES2-AF. compared to unmodified ES2-AF, modified CS-ES2-AF showed better inhibition. CS-ES2-AF flowed through the CM5 chip to generate dynamic sensing plots. the affinity kinetic parameters Ka (L/(mol s) and Kd (1/s) of the interaction of CD44 protein with CS-ES2-AF and ES2-AF were 6,846, 6.863105 and 0, 0, respectively. ES2-AF-FITC and CS-ES2-AF-FITC were administered by tail vein. the nude mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate. no fluorescence was observed in both groups at 0 hour. a strong fluorescence signal was observed at the tumor site and in the cervical lymph nodes near the tumor. at 1, 2, and 4 hours, the fluorescence signal still appeared in the tumor site. almost no fluorescence appeared at the tumor site of the ES2-AF-FITC group, indicating that the metabolism of CS-ES2-AF-FITC was slower than ES2-AF-FITC. the plasma concentration of the glycosylated product CS-ES2-AF was lower than the ES2-AF group at 0.5 hour, the plasma concentrations were higher at the other time points. the results are shown as mean SD (n=5). polypeptide ES2-AF was successfully synthesized by solid-phase method. the active peptide inhibits endothelial cell proliferation in the ES2-AF peptide is ES2. the inhibitory activities of both the drugs were dose-dependent. the activity of polypeptide drugs is often related to their structure. the higher the concentration of ES2-AF, the more stability of ES2-AF. CS-ES2-AF was more efficient in inhibiting endothelial cell metastasis than ES2-AF. the activity of the two drugs was equivalent, which might be due to CS promoting the adhesion and growth of endothelial cells. ES2-AF was better than that of ES2-AF. but adding CS in mixture had an effect on the activity of peptide. the activity of conjugated group was slightly lower than that of peptide group at a low concentration. the SPR method is a real-time, fast, high-flux method. the technique uses the principle of physical optics. the combination of the two molecules will change the refractive index of the sensor surface. in vivo imaging is a new technology that qualitatively or quantitatively analyzes the distribution and metabolism of drugs in the living body by using various imaging modes at the cellular and molecular level. compared with traditional in vitro imaging techniques or slice observation, in vivo imaging is better. ylation modification changed the structure of the conjugates, increasing their steric hindrance and thus improving the ability to resist hydrolysis by hydrolases. the fluorescence intensity of the glycosylation-modified product at the tumor site was stronger than that of polypeptide group, demonstrating the ability of CS to target tumor tissues. sensitivity of the analytical method is an issue since the dosage of the polypeptide drug is small. ES2-AF is a new anti-angiogenic peptide prepared by solid-phase synthesis technology. it has no light absorption and chromogenic groups, so it cannot be determined by spectroscopy or chromatography. FITC was used to label polysaccharides and polypeptides. ES2-AF was synthesized by a solid-phase method in this study. CS-ES2-AF was obtained by chemical modification of a new peptide ES2-AF with CS. CS-ES2-AF had better ability to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of endothelial cells than ES2-AF. the half-life of CS-ES2-AF was approximately threefold longer than that of ES2-AF in vivo. ES2-AF that has been modified by CS has improved anti-neovascularization activity in vitro and in vivo."}
