{"summary": "nasopharyngeal (NP) swabbing or washing often used for RV testing in setting of lower respiratory tract disease. bronchoscopy to test for possible LRTD has become increasingly uncommon in certain patient populations. the utility of PCR-based RV testing on NP samples is not clear. one patient had two sets of paired NP and BAL fluid samples submitted 17 days apart. most of the patients were adults; only three were younger than 18 years. a minority of the patients had symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), whereas most of them had fever, cough, or hypoxemia. myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1). d Other disease states were congenital immunodeficiency, pregnancy, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, or none. g Abnormalities occurred at any time from initial presentation through bronchoscopy; in one case, radiography was not performed. human metapneumovirus 5 Adenovirus 4 Respiratory syncytial virus 3 Influenza A 2 Parainfluenza virus 1 2 Underlying disease in patients with positive samples 25 (35.2) Allogeneic HSCT 10 Hematologic malignancies were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), and lymphoma (n = 1). three paired NP/BAL fluid sets were NP but BAL fluid+ for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and RhV. a clinically relevant copathogen was found in 6 (27.2%) of the 22 BAL fluid samples that tested positive for an RV. patients with hematologic malignancies or HSCT recipients may be more likely to have an RV in LRTD than patients admitted to an intensive care unit with community-acquired pneumonia. comparable studies in lung transplant and pediatric populations have included patients without evidence of LRTD or without acute lower respiratory syndromes (4, 9), thereby potentially reducing the likelihood of RV detection in a BAL fluid sample. the rate of coinfection with other pathogens in this study. larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."}
