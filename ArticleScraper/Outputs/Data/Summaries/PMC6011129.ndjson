{"summary": "bioaerosol sampling at Duke Hospital ED was conducted once a week from October 4th 2017 to March 1st 2018, excluding a 6-week holiday period from the beginning of December 2017 to mid-january 2018. each sampler featured two stages of collection for pathogens greater than 4 and 1\u20134 m in size, and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) back-up filter. pathogens filtered greater than 4 m and 1\u20134 m had potential for remaining viable after capture. the samplers were placed 1.5 m above the ground, approximately at eye-level for seated visitors. the third sampler was set-up in one of the available triage rooms. RNA from the stored samples was completed using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) and tested with qRT-PCR assays using superscript\u00ae III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum\u00ae Taq DNA Polymerase. positive specimens were then confirmed using previously described two step molecular assays focusing on the hexon gene (13) bioaerosol sampling at Duke Hospital ED was conducted once a week from October 4th 2017 to March 1st 2018, excluding a 6-week holiday period from the beginning of December 2017 to mid-january 2018. the samplers were placed 1.5 m above the ground, approximately at eye-level for seated visitors, at three locations within the ED. the location of sampling was recorded with the data, time, sampler number, pump number, and run time. all bioaerosol samplers were transported back to the Duke One Health Research Laboratory. samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until further molecular work was performed. viral DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Inc. Valencia, CA) and then examined by a real time PCR (qPCR) assay (12) positive specimens were then confirmed using previously described two step molecular assays focusing on the hexon gene (13). Molecular results for three sites in the emergency department at Duke University Hospital, October 2017 to February 2018.
