{"summary": "noroviruses are a leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis in children and adults worldwide. it is estimated that noV infection may account for up to 200,000 deaths per year in infants and young children in developing countries (7). noroviruses are divided into five distinct genogroups (genogroup I [GI] to GV) based on VP1 sequence similarity. the GI.1 norwalk virus (NV) is an established reference strain for the human noroviruses. antibodies to NV were induced in chimpanzees by an immunization strategy of infection and priming with live NV followed by boosting with NV rVLPs. a panel of NV-specific MAbs was then generated by phage display library technology from chimpanzee bone marrow B cells and immortalized memory B cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) lymphocytes were prepared by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. a Fab phage display library containing 1 heavy chain and light chains with a diversity of >108 was constructed. the chimpanzees were housed at Bioqual, Inc.. peripheral blood (50 ml) was collected from the chimpanzee immunized with NV rVLPs. PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. RNA was extracted from cells producing Abs specific to NV rVLPs. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of VH and VL genes were carried out as described previously for phage library construction. Fabs with distinct VH and VL sequences were regarded as separate Fab clones. a 96-well ELISA plate were coated with 100 l of NV rVLPs or other NoV rVLPs at a concentration of 1.5 g/ml. after washing, the plate was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against human IgG F(ab\u2032)2. color development was stopped with H2SO4 after 10 min. NV rVLPs in 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5) were then injected across the surface. the surface was regenerated by injecting a solution of Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (pH 6.6) for 2 min at 30 l/min. the surface was deactivated by a 7-min injection of 1 M ethanolamine at 10 l/min. VP1 mutants with consecutive N-terminal deletions in vitro were PCR amplified by using the Elongase amplification system (Invitrogen) with plasmid pNV101 (40) the PCR-employed sense primers included a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence followed by a short noncoding sequence (GGGAACAGACCACC), an AUG codon, and the in-frame sequence of the NV ORF2 region of interest. the proteins were incubated for 1 h at RT with either recombinant Fab or MAb (IgG) at a concentration of 10 g/ml. immunity was enhanced by an additional 1-h incubation with anti-human Fab IgG at 4 g/ml. yeast EBY100 cells were transformed with NVVP1-pCTCON2. cells were harvested, washed, and incubated with anti-c-myc antibody. cells were incubated with mouse anti-NV MAb NV4 and chimpanzee anti-NV Fabs B7, D9, E4 and G4. each mutated product was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. cells were grown overnight on LB plates with carbenicillin (50 g/ml) plasmids were subjected to sequence analysis to verify the entire VP1 coding region and to confirm the presence of the introduced mutations. the binding of captured NV rVLP was determined by incubation with guinea pig anti-NV hyperimmune serum (1:2,000 dilution; KPL) the reaction was visualized with a peroxidase substrate, 2,2\u2032-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) (ABTS) and read at 405 nm with a Dynex Technologies Revelation 4.25 plate reader. anti-NV MAb D8 (0.5 mg) at 1 mg/ml in 1 PBS was incubated with 10 CID50 of NV (8fIIa) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C in a total volume of 1.5 ml. a chimpanzee was inoculated intravenously with the antibody-virus mixture. from 15 chimpanzees experimentally inoculated intravenously with various 10-fold serial dilutions (100 to 105 of a standard fecal suspension of NV) were evaluated with the Reed-Muench equation (35) to yield a quantitative titer of the virus expressed in 50% chimpanzee infectious doses (CID50) 100 l of NV rVLPs at 5 g/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to coat each well of an ELISA plate. specific phages were selected by incubating 1012 phages with the coated VLP. resulting phages were screened for specific binding to NV rVLP. memory B cells were cultured at 40 cells per well in RPMI 1640 medium. they were immortalized by maintenance for 3 weeks in presence of 1 105 irradiated MRC-5 feeder cells. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of VH and VL genes were carried out. Fab was expressed in Escherichia coli and was affinity purified on a nickel column. both Fab and IgG were further purified through a cation-exchange SP column. NV rVLPs were coupled to the surface of a CM5 chip by using the manufacturer-recommended protocol for amine coupling. a 7-min injection at 10 l/min of a mixture of 0.4 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.1 M N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) was used to activate the surface. cross-competition between Fabs was carried out by competitive SPR. all Fabs were tested at a concentration of 100 nM. the first Fab was injected and observed for the binding of analyte to ligand via sensorgram. the second Fab was injected immediately, and binding activity was observed. the amplified DNA fragments were agarose gel purified and used as templates in a coupled transcription-and-translation reaction. for radiolabeling of synthesized proteins, [35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA) was used at a concentration of 0.4 mCi/ml. radiolabeled immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by autoradiography. gene encoding full-length NV VP1 (530 amino acid residues) was amplified by PCR with the addition of an NheI site at the 5\u2032 end and a SalI site at the 3\u2032 end. six primer pairs were designed to create single G365N, V370I, I376V, and Y410F mutations. a construct was generated with a triple (G365N/V370I/I376V) mutation. the restriction enzyme DpnI (10 U/l) was used to digest the parental DNA. expression of VP1 was confirmed with a murine norovirus-specific cross-reactive MAb (1:200 dilution) and goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cells transfected with a vector expressing green fluorescent protein served as the negative control for specific Fab binding. the 50% blocking antibody titer (BT50) was defined as the reciprocal of the lowest antibody dilution tested that blocked at least 50% of binding compared to that in the absence of antibody pretreatment (control binding) a chimpanzee was inoculated in a preliminary experiment. titer of NV genome was quantified by norovirus-specific quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) the chimpanzee was observed for the appearance of clinical signs of gastroenteritis. whole-blood samples were collected preinoculation and every other week until the termination of the study. binding profiles of Fabs B7, D8, E5, G4, and F11 at a concentration of 100 ng/ml on rVLPs from NV (GI.1), SW-2007 (GI.1), Hawaii (GII.1), and MD-145 (GII.4) were measured by ELISA with antigens directly attached to the solid phase at 1.5 g/ml. rotypic differences between NV and Hawaii virus (HV) established in cross-challenge studies. interaction between Fab and immobilized rVLP was measured by SPR and recorded within a sensorgram. a single IgHV3 family with biased usage of the JH4 gene segment was present in the heavy chains. a single IGKV1 family was present in the light chains. this marked restriction in gene usage suggests significant structural constraints may be operating in the selection of antibodies to NV. the closest human V gene germ lines were identified by a search of the IMGT database (http://www.imgt.org/). b The VH and VL genes before CDR3 were used to calculate the percent nucleotide identity. only Fabs B7, D8, E5, and G4 were included in the assay. deletion into the P domain from either the N or C terminus resulted in complete abolishment of antibody binding. this result suggests that anti-NV Fabs bind to conformational epitopes that require presentation in virtually the entire P domain of VP1. anti-NV Fabs B7, D8, E5, and G4 were tested for binding. a control MAb, mouse anti-NV MAb NV4, was tested for binding. c-myc-positive cells treated with any one of the four chimpanzee anti-NV Fabs were negative for Ab binding fluorescence. the five anti-NV Fabs were examined in a competitive SPR assay. the assay is based on the assumption that the full occupancy of a specific epitope in the P domain by a given Fab would compete with a second Fab that recognizes the homologous epitope. four distinguishable epitopes were identified based on the competition patterns. Fabs B7, D8, E5, and G4 were examined by an immunofluorescence assay. the data showed that G365 in P2 is a critical residue for G4 binding since the G365N mutation abolished G4 binding. the G365N mutant was still reactive with the other three Fabs. the different amino acids between norwalk and SW-2007 viruses are shown in red. the shell domain is shown in tan, and the P1 and P2 subdomains are shown in light blue and blue, respectively. anti-NV MAbs block HBGA binding and inhibit hemagglutination by NV. anti-NV MAbs prevent NV infection of chimpanzees. we determined that the pool contained NV at a concentration of 102 CID50 per ml. HBGA blocking activity correlated with in vivo neutralization in chimpanzees. binding profiles of Fabs B7, D8, E5, G4, and F11 at a concentration of 100 ng/ml on rVLPs from NV (GI.1), SW-2007 (GI.1), Hawaii (GII.1), and MD-145 (GII.4) were measured by ELISA with antigens directly attached to the solid phase at 1.5 g/ml. the absence of cross-reactivity with GII was consistent with the serotypic differences between NV and Hawaii virus (HV) established in cross-challenge studies. the interaction between Fab and immobilized rVLP was measured by SPR. a single IgHV3 family with biased usage of the JH4 gene segment was present in the heavy chains. a single IGKV1 family was present in the light chains. this marked restriction in V gene usage suggests significant structural constraints may be operating in the selection of antibodies to NV. the closest human V gene germ lines were identified by a search of the IMGT database. mutants in the first 20 bp were excluded, since mutations could be introduced by PCR primers. cated forms of NV VP1 were generated by a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. only Fabs B7, D8, E5, and G4 were included in the assay. deletion into the P domain from either the N or C terminus resulted in complete abolishment of antibody binding. this result suggests that anti-NV Fabs bind to conformational epitopes that require presentation in virtually the entire P domain of VP1. mouse anti-NV MAb NV4 and chimpanzee anti-NV Fabs B7, D8, E5, and G4 were tested for binding. percentages indicate the numbers of cells gated by positive VP1 expression that were bound by antibody. the negative results with the Fabs were confirmed by testing the full-length IgG forms of MAbs D8 and B7. to assess the spatial relationship of antigenic sites in the P domain, the five anti-NV Fabs were examined in a competitive SPR assay. the assay is based on the assumption that the full occupancy of a specific epitope in the P domain by a given Fab would compete with a second Fab that recognizes the homologous epitope the impact of each of these changes on G4 binding was tested. cells transfected with an expression vector carrying VP1 of NV with single, double, or triple mutations were incubated with Fabs B7, D8, E5, and G4. the data showed that G365 in P2 is a critical residue for G4 binding since the G365N mutation abolished G4 binding. anti-NV MAbs block HBGA binding and inhibit hemagglutination by NV. all five MAbs blocked the binding of NV rVLPs to H1 HBGA carbohydrate in a dose-dependent manner. 8, E5, G4, and F11 (IgG) were tested for their ability to block the interaction between recombinant NV rVLPs and H1 carbohydrates. the pool contained NV at a concentration of 102 CID50 per ml. HBGA blocking activity correlated with in vivo neutralization in chimpanzees. chimpanzees were the only permissive animal model for the evaluation of vaccines and antiviral compounds for GI NV (32) studies in adult volunteers may be required for the continued evaluation of these and other candidate therapeutic antibodies. we have successfully isolated five NV-specific antibodies from immunized chimpanzees and demonstrated that these antibodies block the binding of NV to HBGA carbohydrates. pathogenic RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza virus are markedly diverse (58\u201361). these MAbs may prove useful for immunoprophylaxis, and knowledge of their binding sites can inform universal vaccine design. we have established the NV infectivity titer for chimpanzees of the 8FIIa stool filtrate as 102 CID50 per ml. this pool represents the first identified human gastroenteritis virus and was used previously for infecting volunteers in 1974 and chimpanzees in 1978 and 2011 (13, 31, 32) s are a diverse group of viruses (29), and there is increasing recognition of their role in serious diarrheal illness. our proof-of-concept approach should be applicable to other NoVs, including the predominant GII.4 viruses."}
