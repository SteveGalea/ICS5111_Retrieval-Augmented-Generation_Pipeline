{"summary": "the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) is an albumin-dialysis modality that has been investigated predominantly in patients with acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. a quality-of-life assessment showed a marked improvement during therapy, which was sustained in two of three patients. clinical benefit of MARS in cholestasis patients with intractable pruritus may not exclusively result from filtration of pruritogens, but also from systemic changes in cytokine/chemokine levels. adult patients (>18 years of age) with intractable pruritus defined by bile acid levels >300 mol/L and a European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) visual analogue score 30/100 (0 = worst) were considered eligible four hundred millilitres of 25% albumin was used in the albumin dialysate. the albumin dialysate was recirculated through charcoal and anion-exchange columns. patients targeted an even fluid balance while on MARS. 8.0 arrays containing 24,000 different probes for human genes were used to profile messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in peripheral blood specimens. RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytix, Switzerland) and 200 ng of total RNA was used for preparation of a complementary DNA (cDNA) library. labelling of 1 g of the resulting cDNA with Cy3 was performed using the one-Color DNA Labeling kit (Roche -3, MDC [CCL22], MIP-1, MIP-1, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES], transforming growth factor [TGF]-alpha, tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, TNF-beta, VEGF, sCD40L, sIL-2R, MCP-2, MCP-4, ENA-78/CX fold-change was used to characterize differences in gene expression in each patient individually, excluding the 20% of probes with the lowest raw intensity values. adult patients (>18 years of age) with PBC or benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis. the albumin dialysate was run at 250 mL/min countercurrent to the blood circuit. patients targeted an even fluid balance while on MARS. each patient underwent two MARS runs consisting of 8 h per run.
