{"summary": "IFN elicits antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by interacting with their specific receptors, IFN activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) complexes. the mechanism by which these ISGs participate in the IFN-mediated response to hepatitis B virus is not fully understood. cellular pattern recognition receptors detect molecular patterns of HCV [14, 15], forming a positive feedback loop to amplify IFN signaling. many ISGs are reported to inhibit HCV RNA replication or viral protein translation. many ISGs are reported to inhibit RNA replication or viral protein translation. cells were cultured in Williams E medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum FetalClone II (HyClone, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), 20 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Carlsbad, USA), 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, USA), 80 g/mL gentamicin (Rat was measured using the AXSYM system (Abbott, Chicago, USA) and HBeAg was measured by the BEP III system (Siemens, Munich, Germany). total cellular DNA or DNA from cell culture supernatant were extracted from infected cells using NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) 96-well plates were coated with 100 L of a 25 g/mL heparin solution per well. 100 L of blocking buffer, 1 L of virus stock solution, and 50 L Murex Conjugate solution were added per well. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h followed by 4 times with PBS-T washing. 0.0005% Trypsin (Gibco, Carlsbad, USA) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. 5 mM protease inhibitor Pefabloc (Sigma, Munich, Germany) was added to the samples. the samples were purified with Vivaspin MWCO 3000 SpinColumn. Luminescence was measured in programmed inject-then-read mode. all luciferase assays were performed in triplicate. two-sided P values 0.05 were considered significant. inoculation of differentiated HepaRG cells was performed with a multiplicity of infection of 200 (genome copies per cell) for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. at the end of the incubation period, cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in differentiation medium. Western Blot Lysates from HepaRG cells were obtained by adding 200 L \u201cM-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent\u201d onto cells per well. 50 L \u201cLDS sample buffer Nonreducing\u201d was added and samples were shaken for five minutes at 800 rpm, 99\u00b0C. 100 L of substrate solution (1 M H2SO4 in ddH2O) was added per well. light absorption measured at 450 nm, with 670 nm reference wavelengths. HCV Infection and Luciferase Assay Huh7.5 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate for 24 h prior to HCV inoculation. 0.1 MOI/cell of HCV luciferase virus were used to infect the cells for 72 h. 10 L of prepared \u201celution\u201d and \u201cconcentrate\u201d was present in the 200 L culture medium during the whole process of HCV infection. Western blot analysis showed the decline of intracellular HBV core protein production. these results suggest that the pretreatment of cells with IFN- for 24 hours is sufficient to induce an antiviral effect. these results also implied that IFN- induces an antiviral program preventing HBV early infection. secreted ISGs restrict early steps of HBV infection. differentiated HepaRG cells were treated with 1000 IU/mL of IFN-. one day later, the medium was removed. IFN- treatment induces hepatoma cells to secrete soluble factors. soluble factors inhibit HBV infection by targeting an early step of HBV infection, most likely virus entry. the medium was incubated with fresh differentiated HepaRG cells for 24 hours followed by 4 hours of HBV incubation at 4\u00b0C. the results demonstrate that HBV binding to its host cell was impeded by treatment with ISG+ medium containing interferon induced factors. IFN- induced products compete with HBV for binding to heparin. soluble factors in the ISG+ medium competitively bind to heparin in cultured cells. soluble factors in the ISG+ medium were applied to the heparin column. the heparin binding fraction was purified and applied to size exclusion columns with a cut-off of 10 kDa, 30 kDa, and 100 kDa respectively. heparin binding fraction was purified and applied to size exclusion columns with a cut-off of 10 kDa, 30 kDa, and 100 kDa, respectively. differentiated HepaRG cells were incubated with indicated samples for 24 hours. heparin-coated plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. heparin-bound SVPs were detected using an HBsAg ELISA kit. IFN-induced secreted factors block HCV binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans. luciferase reporter virus was used to infect cells at an MOI of 0.1 TCID50/cell. IFN- pretreatment resulted in a decline of HBeAg and HBsAg at day 10 upon HBV infection. qPCR analysis revealed more than 50% reduction of cccDNA and intracellular HBV-DNA after IFN- pretreatment. the medium containing the ISG products (ISG+) was collected and added together with HBV to differentiated HepaRG cells. compared with untreated cells, the medium showed decreased cccDNA and intracellular HBV-DNA demonstrating the inhibitory effect of ISG+ medium. the antiviral action elicited by ISG+ medium was due to residual IFN-, neutralizing antibodies (IFN--Ab) were applied. this proved that the antiviral activity of ISG+ medium was not elicited by residual IFN-. differentiated HepaRG cells were treated with 1000 IU/mL of IFN-. one day later, the medium was removed. part of the medium was heated at 99\u00b0C for 10 minutes to inactivate proteins (ISG+/) heparin columns were washed with PBS and then applied with differentiated HepaRG cell culture medium (ISG+) or the entry inhibitor Pep19-2.5. elution fraction from different elutions were collected and applied to differentiated HepaRG cells. differentiated HepaRG cells were incubated with elution or flow-through for 24 hours followed by 4 hours of HBV incubation at 4\u00b0C. data are means s.d. P 0.05, P 0.01, and P 0.001 by student's unpaired two-tailed t-test. HepaRG cells were cultivated in hyperflask. after differentiation, cells were stimulated with 1000 IU/mL IFN- for one day. heparin binding fraction was purified from heparin columns. interferon induced secreted factors inhibit binding of HBV to heparin are larger than 100 kDa. heparin column purified ISG+ medium (elution) with glycosidase, trypsin, or proteinase K. all three enzyme treatments enhanced HBV replication. a novel antiviral mechanism of IFN- targets the HBV and HCV binding step. the supernatant of IFN- treated cell cultures restricts HBV and HCV entry and infection. the inhibition is contributed by one or more secreted interferon induced proteins. IFN- induced antiviral response is known to be multifunctional for a long time. but its effects on the virus binding or entry steps are not well studied. Until recently, the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein family has been shown to block early stages of viral infection. acylated HBV preS-derived lipopeptides targeting viral envelope protein components could prevent the interaction of HBV with its cellular receptor. hepatitis delta virus uses the same receptor as HBV. entry inhibitors are equally effective against both viruses. IFN- is able to induce soluble factors that bind to heparan glycosaminoglycans and lead to the inhibition of HBV and HCV binding. authors have no conflict of interests to disclose."}
