{"summary": "18,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) analyzed by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs. samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. the etiology of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is diverse and complicated. advances in molecular techniques have led to an increased detection rate for respiratory viruses. the frequency of non-bacterial RTIs was previously underestimated. the characteristics associated with RTIs in developing countries have not been elucidated. this study thus analyzed the incidence of 18 RTI pathogens in patients in Guangzhou, southern China, during the five-year period from July 2009 to June 2014. single acute upper RTI group (SAURTIG) consisted of patients with pulmonary symptoms. symptoms were determined by an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI. bronchitis or terminal bronchitis, tracheitis, or pneumonia. the 2 test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used where appropriate. all of the tests were two tailed, and a value of P0.05 represented statistical significance. the RTI with chronic lung disease group consisted of patients with an RTI and a history of asthma, tuberculosis, or chronic fiber disease. the RTI with severe non-pulmonary symptoms group consisted of patients with severe disorders of the digestive system or nervous system, allergic diseases, idiopathic fever, or convulsions. the specific PDRs of these subgroups were 49.79%, 54.70%, 38.02%, 51.16%, 40.65%, and 34.19%, respectively. the specific PDRs of these subgroups were 49.79%, 54.70%, 38.02%, 51.16%, 40.65%, and 34.19%, respectively. n1: Represents the total number of positive samples in 5-years. P 2: Represents the P values comparing gender, age, five disease groups for the total CIR respectively. the PDRs in the RTISNPSG, SALRTIG, RTICLDG, RTISNPSG, and RTIIDG were 28.08%, 56.07%, 25.69%, 81.6%, and 67.98% respectively. however, no statistically significant difference in PDR between the SAURTIG and RTICLDG or between any possible pair among the SALRTIG, RTISNPSG, and RTIIDG. the order of the PDRs of the four HCoV types was OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1. the individual PDRs of the 18 pathogens exhibited four distinct trends. one peak in PDR was observed for IAV, HBoV, HRV, IBV, EV, PIV. the pattern of pathogen\u2019s PDR depends on the season of detection and on patient sex and age Four distinct seasonal distributions and 2 epidemic tendencies. MP, HBoV, ADV, and CP were detected with a lower PDR in the spring than in summer, autumn or winter. female patients showed higher PDRs for IBV, MP, HMPV, HCoV-229E, and ADV. female patients showed higher PDRs for IBV, MP, HMPV, HCoV-229E, and ADV. 8(0.22) 37(0.82) 5(0.27) 33(1.49) 8(2.25) # 0.05 OC43 242(3.22) 141(2.83) 0.221 79(2.2) 115(2.55) 25(1.36) 154(6.96) # 24(6.74) 0.05 NL63 47(0.62) 24(0.48) 0.229 2(0.06) 11(0.24) 6(0.33) 41(1.85) # 2(0.56) 0.05 HKU1 29(0.39) 13( # 55(2.49) 4(1.12) 0.05 CP 47(0.62) 18(0.36) 0.05 14(0.39) 27(0.6) 5(0.27) 14(0.63) # 1(0.28) 0.298 ADV 304(4.04) 254(5.1) 0.05 No. (%) of each group except where specifically stated. the order of the PDRs of the four PIV types was PIV2 PIV3, PIV1, PIV4, and HBoV. the PDRs of 7 other pathogens (IAV, IBV, HCoV-229E/OC43/NL63, PIV4 and HRV) were higher in pediatric patients than in adult patients (P 0.05). clinical characteristics of the pathogens Disease and pathogen distribution in vulnerable populations In the SAURTIG, the PDR of IAV, RSV and MP were greater than 5%. in the RTISNPSG, the PDRs of IAV, IBV, RSV, MP, EV and OC43 exceeded 5%. HCoV-229E co-infected one patient in the 15-30-year old subgroup. HBoV (0/4) and PIV2 (0/1) did not show co-infection in the 51-year-old subgroup. NL63 (2/2) and HKU1 (3/3) appeared to co-infect all of the HKU1-positive samples. HCoV co-infected with IAV, RSV, EV, MP, IBV or HCoV-OC43. HBoV co-infected with RSV, IAV, HRV, HMPV, or MP.

EV, HCoV, HRV, and PIV showed a peak PDR in summer. pathogens that did not show a yearly seasonal peak included EV (in children), IBV, CP (in adults), HBoV, HKU1 and PIV4. overall, season-dependent trends resulted in a lower PDR in winter and spring and a higher PDR in the summer and autumn.

HBoV, MP, RSV, and ADV showed increased PDRs during childhood, decreased PDRs during adulthood, and increased PDRs during older age. the PDRs of IAV, IBV, HMPV, EV, CP, OC43, NL63, and HCoV were higher in the RTISNPSG than in the other groups (P 0.05). in the RTIIDG, the PDRs of IAV, RSV, MP, OC43, ADV and EV were greater than 5%. NL63 (2/2) and HKU1 (3/3) appeared to co-infect all of the HKU1-positive samples in the RTIIDG. PIV2-positive samples (0/2) did not show co-infection in the RTIIDG. CP (0/14) was not observed in the RTISNPSG. in the RTISNPSG, the PDRs of IAV, IBV, RSV, MP, EV and OC43 exceeded 5%. in the RTISNPSG, the PDRs of IAV, IBV, RSV, MP, EV and OC43 exceeded 5%. the male CIR was higher than the female CIR. HBoV co-infected one patient in the 15-30-year old subgroup. HBoV (0/4) and PIV2 (0/1) did not show co-infection in the 51-year-old subgroup. no significant difference in CIR was observed between any possible pair. the highest CIR values listed from highest to lowest were as follows: HCoV co-infected with IAV, RSV, EV, MP, IBV, or MP. HBoV co-infected with RSV, IAV, HRV, HMPV, or MP; and PIV co-infected with IAV, RSV, MP, EV, HCoV-OC43 or HBoV. HRV causes common upper RTIs, which often present with symptoms too mild to lead to doctor visits or hospitalizations. differences in disease incidence and severity according to age are experienced at different ages. the PDR of the common pathogens IAV, MP, HCoV, EV, and ADV were highest in autumn. a pathogen PDR greater than 5% suggests that the pathogen is common in a disease group. the disease group is particularly vulnerable to the pathogen. common pathogens associated with co-infections were HCoV, HBoV, EV, and PIV. in the current study, common pathogens associated with co-infections were HBoV, EV, and PIV. adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (HBoV), mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are the most common RTI pathogen. summer and autumn appear to be the key periods for the specific prevention of RSV. pathogens most commonly involved in co-infections are HCoV, HBoV, EV, and PIV. despite the complexity of RTIs, the clinical signatures of the disease can provide important clues to aid clinicians in optimizing diagnostic and treatment plans. vaccines and new drug treatments are urgently needed."}
