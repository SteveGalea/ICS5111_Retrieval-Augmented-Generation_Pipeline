{"summary": "in the last 50 years, the discipline of infection prevention and control has undergone numerous metamorphoses. there has been increasing emphasis on prevention of nosocomial infections through principles of hand hygiene, cleaning and sterilization, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. infectious diseases continue to challenge quality of care provided in ICUs. IPAC interventions are cost-effective and improve patient outcomes in critically ill patients in the ICU Nosocomial infections in the ICU have been associated with significant mortality and increased resource consumption [7]. a recent study conducted prospectively across Austrian ICUs found that patients with nosocomial infections had prolonged device exposure, including endotracheal tubes, central venous catheters and urinary catheters, increased mortality rates and longer length of stay in the ICU and the hospital [8]. the implementation of strict IPAC practices has been credited for the declining rates of MRSA catheter-related bloodstream infections by 50% or more in medical, surgical, cardiac and pediatric ICUs. the benefits of specific IPAC interventions are difficult to tease out as many are bundled, especially those related to personal protective equipment and active surveillance. active surveillance for MRSA colonization among ICU patients with subsequent implementation of barrier precautions has also been shown in the non-ICU setting [23-25] and in the neonatal ICU setting [13] to significantly decrease the rates of transmission and incidence of nosocomial MRSA bacteremias. only 55% compliance with contact precautions for ICU patients known to be colonized with MRSA. the attributable excess costs of MRSA bacteremia infections in the other neonatal ICU were estimated at 19-fold to 27-fold higher. a cost-benefit analysis in a medical ICU also showed that active identification of patients with infection or colonization by MRSA via selective screening and isolation was more cost-effective than treating patients with MRSA infections. a case-control study of critically ill patients in a medical ICU showed that HCW were highly compliant with gown and glove use, but were two times less likely to enter the rooms of patients in contact isolation. a similar observational study among surgical ICU and non-ICU patients found a reduction in the time HCW spent with patients on contact precautions. patients randomized to contact isolation with disposable gowns, gloves and hand hygiene had similar rates of airway colonization but a higher incidence of nosocomial pneumonia than patients on standard precautions with hand hygiene and gloves over a 15-month period [38]. a randomized controlled trial comparing surgical masks with N95 masks among HCW during the influenza season showed similar rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza [39]. preventing VRE transmission has been suggested to be cost-effective only in endemic settings where at least six patients per year will develop bloodstream infections. compliance with barrier precautions may itself present as a barrier to reducing the rate of transmission of nosocomial infections. the net effect of IPAC measures on patient care remains unclear. there is no evidence that isolating patients with multidrug-resistant organisms is of benefit to the patient and HCW in the ICU. IPAC measures should take into consideration setting, epidemiology, virulence factors, mode of transmission and degree of transmissibility of various pathogens. some interventions have been shown to decrease rates of transmission of nosocomial pathogens, but few studies beyond MRSA and VRE."}
