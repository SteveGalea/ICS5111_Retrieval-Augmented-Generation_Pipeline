{"summary": "it took almost five decades before immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the cellular origin of antibodies. major strides in the B cell and antibody field followed in the 1970s with the development of hybridoma technology to produce monoclonal antibodies. the subsequent explosion of available monoclonal antibodies led to revolutionary diagnostic, therapeutic, and research reagents. insights into the ontogeny of these rare B cells could allow the design of a step-wise vaccine regimen that stimulates the germ-line precursor to expand and mature. stabilization in their pre-fusion states could greatly accelerate vaccine development against these pathogens. up to 20% of mature, nave B cells have receptors with the capacity to bind self-antigens (25). the deletion of B cells with high affinity to self-antigen through apoptosis, anergy of B cells with low affinity to self-antigen, and the absence of T cell help combine together to protect against autoimmune disease in mice. the technique relies on the principle of capturing the secreted antibody in the vicinity of each cell. antigen-specific antibodies will bind in close proximity to the location of the individual B cells producing those antibodies. secondary antibodies conjugated to combinatorial colored beads can also be used to detect antibodies secreted from individual B cells. Flow cytometry (1) Detection of low affinity antigen-specific B cells; (2) characterization and downstream analysis of cells is possible; (3) magnetic enrichment can improve sensitivity. characterization and downstream analysis of cells is possible; (3) magnetic enrichment can improve sensitivity. antigen-specific B cells can be selected by screening the culture supernatants for monoclonal antibodies that bind an antigen of interest. the requirement for an ex vivo culture prior to selection precludes determination of the transcriptional profile of the original B cell. advances in single cell next generation sequencing technology have allowed high throughput transcriptional profiling and sequencing of paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. site-specific biotinylation can be accomplished by adding an AviTag or BioEase tag to the recombinant antigen prior to expression (77, 78). the tag may occlude an epitope from recognition by B cells which can be problematic for vaccine antigens. fluorochrome conjugated streptavidin in tetramer and decoy reagent vary enough from company to company to alter some of the epitopes available for B cells to bind. reliance on antigens that can be readily conjugated to a fluorochrome or biotinylated has also been used to identify antigen-specific B cells. cell expressing high affinity BCRs will bind monomeric antigen at low concentrations. low affinity BCRs will require higher concentrations of monomeric antigen to compete with and inhibit tetramer binding. individual cells can also be isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting. rare antigen (Ag)-specific B cells can be identified using tetramers conjugated to a fluorochrome, followed by magnetic (Fe) nanoparticles that bind the fluorochrome, magnetic enrichment, and flow cytometry. in vivo methods to probe antigen-specific B cell responses have increased our mechanistic understanding of the humoral immune response during vaccination, infection, and autoimmunity. microscopy is another general technique that has been used to identify antigen-specific cells in vivo. this technique has been used to demonstrate the cellular origin of antibodies in 1955. this technique offers the advantage of direct visualization. transgenic mice that produce humanized cytokines by knock-in replacement can be used to support human hematopoietic stem cells (104). mass cytometry has the potential to provide further high-dimensional analysis of antigen-specific B cells. single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have the potential to revolutionize the study of antigen-specific immune cells. the ability to generate a library of tetramers with unique barcodes could allow simultaneous examination of gene expression profiles from a large number of cells with different antigen specificities in a single experiment."}
