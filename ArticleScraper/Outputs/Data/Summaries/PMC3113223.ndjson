{"summary": "information communications technology has been a focus of the work of the international development research centre (IDRC) since 1970. in this article, we focus on the field of telemedicine in developing countries and its role in improving health. in this article, we focus on the field of telemedicine in developing countries and its role in improving health. the project helped the organization better understand the challenges of supporting telehealth projects in africa. it also helped define some of the key questions it would try to answer. the telemedicine program can work in conjunction with a rural kiosk. once the service was launched, there was a spike in the number of visitors to the kiosk. after the initial interest, however, the number of visitors dropped precipitously to a few regular, repeat visitors. the IRDC\u2019s Application of ICT in the HIV-AIDS response in Eastern and Southern Africa project studied how ICTs had been used in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and Botswana to address health and development challenges brought about by HIV/AIDS. the majority of respondents \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d whether computers, email and the Internet could be effective. conventional communication methods are still perceived as the most widely used modes of information transmission. the authors of the study conclude that conventional communication methods are still perceived as the most widely used modes of information transmission. mobile telephony and mobile-enabled health applications are increasingly pervasive in africa and have the potential to play an important role there. many of the technologies previously developed and tested were too expensive to be widely adopted in resource-poor settings. the prospectus also affirms that the first generation of largely donor-driven \u201ctelemedicine\u201d projects has generally had only a marginal impact on people\u2019s health. a key to mitigating the spread of these infectious diseases is to ensure that data on outbreaks are captured and communicated to the relevant experts in real time. a key to mitigating the spread of these infectious diseases is to ensure that data on outbreaks are captured and communicated. telehealth and e-health solutions can have real, short-term benefits at many levels, including a direct benefit to patients. there is an ongoing need to support research that demonstrates these benefits within a cost\u2013benefit analysis. this is particularly significant in the context of developing countries with limited financial resources and telecommunications infrastructure. we believe that what is now required is the development of a rigorous research methodology that is relevant and applicable to the context of developing nations. this must be based on an applied research modality in which the fundamentals of the work address real and significant issues of human health as they influence the development process."}
