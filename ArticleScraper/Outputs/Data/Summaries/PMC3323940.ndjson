{"summary": "spore-tainted letter incident in anthrax spore-tainted letter incident in the us. sporicidal efficacy, low corrosion, large disinfection volume, and simple operation was considered to be the best decontamination method. systematic investigation involving quantitative experiments of laboratory-scale decontamination of building material surfaces was initiated by the united states epa (US EPA) another systematic investigation studied the log reduction in viable spore numbers by CD gas under given technology operation parameters and environmental conditions. CD gas was generated by passing a chlorine gas-nitrogen mixture through five columns of sodium chlorite chips. this method had the advantages of producing gas of high purity with little corrosion. a 100-ml air sample was withdrawn from the chamber using a syringe. titrating solution was added to the absorption liquid until the liquid turned light-yellow. the color of the solution changed from light-yellow to colorless. the volume of STS solution used in the titration was recorded and the concentration of CD was calculated using Eq. a spore stock suspension was prepared with a spore population of 85% to 90%. a measured volume of EDI water and organic burden was added to the suspension to prepare a spore suspension with a concentration of about 4.9109 colony forming unit per ml. 10-fold dilutions were performed for dilutions between 100, 101 and 102. 0.4-ml aliquots of these three dilutions were spread twice (0.8 ml total) on each of two nutrient broth agar plates. these plates were incubated for 24\u201336 h at 37 \u00b0C. a gas sampling port, a CD injection port, and a vapor injection port were located in the chamber during the decontamination period. each fan was controlled by a switch placed outside the chamber Test. the experiment with the desired CD concentration was conducted in four steps. the averaged number from two replicate plates with between 10 and 300 CFU was chosen as an acceptable criterion for the evaluation of the control coupons. the log value of the number of viable spores per coupon was determined for each of the five replicate coupons of each material. a 100-ml air sample was withdrawn from the chamber using a syringe covered with silver paper, transferred to the bottom of an iodine flask as quickly as possible. the flask was placed in the dark for 5 min to obtain the absorption liquid. titrating solution was added to the absorption liquid until the liquid turned light-yellow to colorless. the volume of STS solution used in the titration was recorded. a spore suspension was prepared with a spore population of 85% to 90%. each sterile coupon was inoculated with 10 l of this suspension. the coupons were immersed in 75% alcohol for 60 min and rinsed using aseptic EDI water. test coupons were transferred into 5 ml of extraction liquid (1 000 ml 0.03 mol/L phosphate buffer water, 1 g Tween-80, 10 g peptone, and 8.5 g sodium chloride) the coupons were allowed to rest in the tubes for 1 h and were then vortexed for 1 min at a speed of 1 600 r/min to dislodge spores from the coupon surface. the chamber was equipped with a door, a gas sampling port, a CD injection port, and a vapor injection port. an instrument measured the temperature and RH, and mixing fans were located in the chamber during the decontamination period. five test coupons of each material were treated by following the extraction process. the remaining three remaining decontaminated coupons were transferred into a sterile 25-ml tube containing 5 ml of nutrient broth culture medium to promote spore germination for 7 d at 37 \u00b0C. spore log reduction values ranged from 1.80 (CC) to 6.64 (GS) in the decontaminated experiment. no statistically significant differences were observed in the log reduction of spore numbers for all tested materials except for CC at a >95% confidence level. log reduction was calculated by subtracting the log number (N) of viable spores from the mean log number (N 0) of spores recovered from the control coupons. each coupon was transferred into sterile 25-ml tubes containing 5 ml of nutrient broth culture medium and incubated at an appropriate temperature (37 \u00b0C) for 7 d. recovery ratio was calculated using Eq. (3): R=N0/Ni100%, (3) where N 0 (CFU) is the mean number of viable organisms recovered from the control coupons. more than 50% viable spores were recovered from SS, PS, and PU, and just 26% from PVC. observation of the data showed no great differences in the log reduction of viable spore numbers in porous material (CC) in contrast to those in nonporous materials (SS, PVC, GS, PS, PU) was observed in the fumigant experiments. log reduction of spores between prehumidification and no-prehumidification experiments at >95% confidence level. increased surface humidification and inner humidification may have resulted in higher sporicidal efficacy of CD following prehumidification. spore log reduction values ranged from 1.80 (CC) to 6.64 (GS) in decontaminated experiment. no statistically significant differences were observed in the log reduction of spore numbers for all tested materials except for CC at a >95% confidence level in two decontaminated experiments. culture medium was used as an indicator of bacterial growth. all replicate coupons showed bacterial growth except the PVC, GS, and PU coupons. all tubes containing coupons in prehumidified-and-decontaminated experiments turned cloudy. spore log reduction values ranged from 1.80 (CC) to 6.64 (GS) in the decontaminated experiment. no statistically significant differences were observed in the log reduction of spore numbers for all tested materials except for CC at a >95% confidence level. contaminated experiments, all replicate coupons showed bacterial growth except the PVC, GS, and PU coupons, some of which were decontaminated completely. all tubes containing coupons in prehumidified-and-decontaminated experiments turned cloudy. the recovery ratio of viable spores detected from the control coupons ranged from 10% to 63%, depending on the type of material. more than 50% viable spores were recovered from SS, PS, and PU, and just 26% from PVC. significant differences were obtained for the sporicidal efficacy of CD. the penetration and embedding of spores into the fibers of porous material could have caused the variation in decontamination efficacy of CD."}
