{"summary": "NS4b was found to have no primary amino acid sequence homology outside of lineage C Betacoronavirus. top scoring structure identified by both servers was the central domain of Rattus norvegicus A kinase anchoring protein 7 isoform gamma or delta. structures were visualized and analyzed in UCSF Chimera 1.8. NS4b shares significant homology with closely related bat coronavirus (BtCoV) proteins encoded by SC2013 and HKU5, 47% and 31% amino acid sequence homology. AKAP7 also contains a carboxy-terminal binding domain for regulatory subunit II (RII) of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (37), guanylyltransferase (Gtase) and methyltransferase (Mtase) domains (E) (28), neither of which are found adjacent to coronavirus PDE domains. NS4b genes were expressed in Escherichia coli as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. purified proteins were incubated with various 2-5A substrate concentrations. velocities plateaued at lower concentrations of 2-5A compared with MHV NS2. 0.4 6.7 1.6 0.6 MERS-CoV NS4b 2.1 0.2 2.6 0.6 0.8 SC2013 NS4b 2.4 0.1 2.9 0.6 0.8 HKU5 NS4b 1.9 0.1 1.3 0.3 1.4 a Kinetic reactions were carried out in triplicate and expressed as means standard errors of the means. coV NS4b and BtCoV homologs from chimeric MHV. we constructed chimeric MHVs that express one of the NS4b proteins. for each chimeric MHV, we constructed a corresponding catalytically inactive mutant. mutant NS4b proteins were expressed in RNase L/ BMM. mutant NS4b proteins were expressed at lower levels than WT NS4b proteins were. similar findings were obtained with chimeric virus infection of 17Cl-1 cells. all three NS4b proteins have an amino-terminal tripartite NLS. previous studies reported that MERS-CoV NS4b is predominantly detected in the nucleus (41) and that overexpressed BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b is solely detected in the nucleus (16). NS2 expression is necessary for robust replication of MHV in BMM derived from B6 BMM (WT) but is not required in RNase L/ BMM (7, 29). similar results were obtained for the pair of viruses expressing BtCoV HKU5 NS4b proteins, but not mutant NS4b proteins. NS4b proteins functionally replace MHV NS2 in primary BMM. the level of expression of NS4b PDE at low levels in the cytoplasm was sufficient to rescue replication in MHV-MERS- and MHV-SC2013-infected B6 BMM. MHV-MERSWT, both full-length and MHV-MERS1-52WT mutant and MHV-SC2013WT clearly prevented RNase L-mediated RNA degradation. MHV-MERSWT, both full-length and MHV-MERS1-52WT mutant and MHV-SC2013WT clearly prevented rRNA degradation. this may be due to the mostly nuclear localization of MHV-HKU5WT. n = 19 or 20) day 5 postinfection (MOI of 2,000 PFU) of MHVWT and MHVMut (A) or MHV-MERSWT and MHV-MERSMut (B). Statistical significance was determined by 2 test with Yates\u2019 correction and is indicated as follows. rRNA degradation pattern from cells 36 h postinfection (A), quantification by RNA integrity number (RIN) (B), and replication kinetics (C) of mock-infected and MERS-CoV-, MERS-NS4b-, and MERS-NS3-5-infected Calu-3 cells (MOI of 1 PFU; n = 3) rRNA degradation pattern from cells 24 and 48 h after MERS-NS4bH182R infection of Cal deletion of ORF4b could result in increased expression of the upstream ORF encoding NS4a and increased dsRNA binding and inhibition of RNase L. we constructed MERS-NS4bH182R, expressing NS4b with an inactive PDE, and assessed its replication and ability to active RNase L in Calu-3 cells. however, it did promote RNase L degradation and like the deletion mutants only at late times postinfection. fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburg, PA), penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and amphotericin B (Fungizone) (Gibco) were cultured. cDNA sequences were synthesized with the addition of a 5\u2032 SalI site and 3\u2032 Flag epitope and notI site. site-directed mutagenesis was performed on each NS4b plasmid to generate point mutants (CAC to CGC) each NS4b gene was then PCR amplified and subcloned in frame with maltose binding protein into pMAL protein expression vector. MHV NS2 and NS2H126R were previously cloned into pMAL parallel-2 vector (29) MERS-NS4b was constructed using the MERS-CoV infectious clone. mutations were made in the overlap region between NS4a and NS4b to abrogate putative start codons. residues 106 to 669 were deleted to remove majority of NS4b. NS4b of MERS-CoV, SC2013, and HKU5 were cloned into pMal parallel-2 vector (46). NS4b of mERS-CoV, SC2013, and HKU5 were cloned into pMal parallel-2 vector. the amounts of 2-5A cleaved were determined by the relative fluorescence units (RFU) using standard curves with different concentrations of authentic 2-5A. the reaction velocities were determined by nonlinear fit of the data. kcat and Km were determined in GraphPad Prism 5.0 for Windows. cells were washed once with PBS (Gibco) to remove residual fetal bovine serum (FBS) cells were inoculated under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions with MERS-CoV, MERS-NS4b, MERS-NS4bH182R, or MERS-NS3-5 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. the cells were then removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS prior to adding media containing low antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Santa Cruz; 1:5,000) were used to detect primary antibodies. blots were probed sequentially with antibodies with the blots stripped between antibodies. RNA from B6 BMM infected with MHVWT, MHVMut, MHV-MERSWT, MHV-MERSWT, or MHV-MERSMut was harvested with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) 15 h postinoculation. RNA was then separated and analyzed on RNA nanochips with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. mice were humanely euthanized with CO2 and perfused with DPBS (Gibco) mice were humanely euthanized with CO2 and perfused with DPBS."}
