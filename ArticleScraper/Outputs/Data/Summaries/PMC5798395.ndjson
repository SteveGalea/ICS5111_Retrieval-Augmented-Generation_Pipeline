{"summary": "in 2011, the Liu group published evidence for the first monofunctional Diels\u2013Alderase, SpnF, in the biosynthetic pathway of Spinosyn A. in 2011, the Liu group published evidence for the first monofunctional Diels\u2013Alderase, SpnF, in the biosynthetic pathway of Spinosyn A. the pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain has a unique PH domain fold critical for targeting to ER\u2013mitochondrial contacts. this work provides a structural explanation for the sterol recognition of LAMs, which can be extended to understand the sterol-binding mode of other LTPs in the StARkin superfamily. HELLS and CDCA7 comprise a bipartite nucleosome remodeling complex defective in ICF syndrome Christopher Jenness, Simona Giunta, Manuel M. M\u00fcller, Hiroshi Kimura, Tom W. Muir, and Hironori Funabiki. it has been speculated that HELLS facilitates DNA methylation by DNMT3b through nucleosome remodeling. unmodified peptide inhibitors of Mcl-1 are ineffective in cellular assays because they cannot access the cytoplasm. this work demonstrates how systematic optimization can transform a lead peptide into a drug prototype suitable for diagnostic and therapeutic development. p63 gene encodes a master regulator of epidermal development and function. specific mutations in p63 are causative of a life-threatening disorder mainly characterized by severe skin erosions and cleft palate. genetic modifications of p63 that abolish aggregation rescue its function. the main Arabidopsis AP endonuclease is active on AP sites generated by enzymatic excision of N7-meG, but not on those arising from N7-meG loss. our findings identify an important role for AP lyase activity in plants and challenge the assumption that spontaneous and repair-generated AP sites have identical biochemical properties. transport of the ciliary membrane protein phospholipase D (PLD) is BBSome-dependent. PLD comigrates with BBSomes on intraflagellar transport trains. beta-agonists may treat asthma-like symptoms due to LAM. Tumor suppressor APC is an attenuator of spindle-pulling forces during asymmetric cell division of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. we performed live imaging, laser microsurgery, and numerical simulation to show how APC stabilizes microtubules. on understanding events in early tuberculosis disease will facilitate the development of novel tests to predict disease progression. transcripts relating to the classical complement pathway and Fc receptor remain enriched, accompanied by rising levels of circulating antibody/antigen immune complexes. this supports observations that antigen may be present in early disease despite being paucibacillary. variation in central airway branching occurs in over one-quarter of the general population. we show that these central airway branch variants are biomarkers of altered distal lung structure. they represent heritable biomarkers of widely altered lung structure and a COPD susceptibility factor. mbotic compounds demonstrate the utility of targeting the cytosolic face of GPCRs to selectively modulate downstream signaling. this could provide an alternative for treatment of thromboinflammatory disorders. the virulence of nontuberculous mycobacteria in macrophages. we identified a pool of genes essential for the intracellular survival of mycobacterium abscessus inside amoebae and macrophages. we found a hot spot of transposon insertions within the orthologous ESX-4 T7SS locus. study compared host responses across other related respiratory virus infections. cross-comparisons provide an additional approach to leverage systems biology data to identify key pathways and strategies used by viruses to subvert host immune responses. ability to accurately predict speech improvement for young children who use cochlear implants would be a first step in the development of personalized therapy to enhance language development. despite the adaptive significance of these processes, little is known about the component processes. we delineate these processes engaged as people learn associations between spatial location and its aversive value in a virtual environment. the underlying mechanisms of fear and anxiety in animals and in humans are still unknown. we report the identification of a chemokine-like gene family, samdori (sam), and present functional characterization of sam2. we observed increased anxiety-related responses in both zebrafish and mouse knockout models. ga Volvox rousseletii displays phototaxis by changing its flagellar beating pattern in response to photoreception. but the molecular mechanism underlying flagellar regulation is unknown. this study describes a method to demembranate whole spheroids using a nonionic detergent, with the addition of ATP reactivating flagellar motility. libraries using a uniform pipeline identified high-confidence differentially methylated regions and compared libraries using a hierarchical framework. we effectively filtered out spontaneous methylation changes from those that are biologically meaningful."}
