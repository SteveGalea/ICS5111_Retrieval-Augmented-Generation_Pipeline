{"summary": "advances in molecular biology have fuelled progress in the discovery of new pathogens associated with human diseases. the identification of novel viruses such as hepatitis C virus (Choo et al. 1989), sin nombre virus (Nichol et al. 1993), and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Chang et al. 1994) has relied upon a diverse range of modern molecular methods such as immunoscreening of cDNA libraries, de this pan-viral microarray was used as part of the global effort to identify a novel virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in march 2003. the first phase of research into the etiology of SARS, an unknown virus was cultured in Vero cells from a patient suffering from SARS. the strongest hybridizing array elements from the infected culture were derived from two families: astroviridae and coronaviridae. be present in the 3\u2032 UTR of all astroviruses and the avian coronaviruses. the other three hybridizing oligonucleotides were derived from three conserved regions within the ORF1AB polyprotein common to all coronaviruses. the virus appeared to be a novel member of the coronavirus family. a pair of PCR primers was designed to amplify the intervening sequences between the two conserved regions. a fragment that possessed 89% identity over 37 amino acids to MHV, a murine coronavirus, was obtained. BLAST analysis revealed 33% identity over 157 amino acids to MHV nucleocapsid, thus confirming the presence of a novel coronavirus. we were able to retrospectively determine the degree of nucleotide identity shared between the hybridizing oligonucleotides and the new coronavirus genome. a key feature of this approach is that direct recovery of hybridized material from the microarray provides a rapid route for obtaining sequences of novel viruses. this approach will greatly facilitate the rapid identification and characterization of novel viruses. 450 ng of nucleic acid was used as input for the amplification protocol. samples were amplified using a random-primer protocol as described by Wang et al. (2002). a single-defined 70mer (spike-70) was mixed with each viral oligonucleotide. a complete list of the viral oligonucleotide sequences on the microarray is also available as Table S2. PCR primers were designed by aligning the hybridizing oligonucleotides (Oligo IDs 15081544_766 and 12175745_728) to the IBV genome. resulting sequence reads were trimmed to remove primer sequences from the RT-PCR step. resulting contigs were screened by blast to remove any contigs with high human sequence similarity. microarray hybridization and analysis DNA microarrays were printed and hybridized essentially as described by Wang et al. (2002). a single-defined 70mer (spike-70) was mixed with each viral oligonucleotide. additional oligonucleotides from these families and their homology to the SARS coronavirus are listed in Table 1. primer-B-amplified material was used as the template for 35 cycles of thermocycling using the following program: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 60 s. PCR amplified material was cloned into pCR2.1TOPO, plated on 2xYT/kan plates and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C. nucleic acid isolation Total nucleic acid was purified using the automated NucliSens extraction system (BioMerieux, Durham, North Carolina) 100 l of each specimen was added to tubes containing 900 l of prewarmed NucliSens lysis buffer and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with intermittent mixing. spike-70 was mixed with each viral oligonucleotide in a 1:50 ratio. a reference signal for every spot on each array was generated by using a Cy3-labeled version of the reverse complement of spike-70. oligonucleotides from the astrovirus and coronavirus families that passed a conservative, arbitrarily set cutoff of (Cy5infection-Cy5mock) primer-B-amplified nucleic acid was cloned in pCR2.1TOPO. white colonies were picked into 384-well plates containing 2xYT/kan plus 8% glycerol. DNA was purified by magnetic bead isolation. resulting sequence reads were trimmed to remove primer sequences from the RT-PCR step. (39.5 KB DOC) Click here for additional data file.
