{"summary": "in the united states, prevalence of both infections is about 2% in healthy cats and up to about 30% in high-risk or sick cats. in the united states, prevalence of both infections is about 2% in healthy cats and up to about 30% in high-risk or sick cats. progressive FeLV infection is associated with a decrease in life expectancy. many owners elect to provide treatment for their cats. with proper care, cats can live many years and die at older age from causes unrelated to their FIV infection. antigen-negative, provirus-positive cats are considered FeLV carriers. after reactivation, they can act as an infection source. reactivation with reoccurring virus shedding is possible. studies using very sensitive PCR methods have found that in many of the formerly considered \u201cregressor cats\u201d the virus actually can still be found later in these cats when investigating tissue samples. in regressive infection, virus replication and viremia are contained prior to or shortly after bone marrow infection. cats with regressive infection have negative results in all tests that detect FeLV antigen. regressive and progressive infections can be distinguished by repeated testing for viral antigen in peripheral blood. regressive and progressive infections can be distinguished by repeated testing for viral antigen in peripheral blood. gressive infection is associated with low, progressive infection with high virus load. the pathomechanism of these disorders is different in both retrovirus infections. the pathomechanism of these disorders is different in both retrovirus infections. infected and feline immunodeficiency virus-(FIV-) infected cats Clinical syndrome FeLV FIV Tumors 62-times as likely as in non-infected cats, direct role of FeLV, mainly T-cell lymphoma 5-times as likely as in non-infected cats, indirect role of FIV, mainly B-cell lymphoma Bone marrow suppression common, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia the outcome of FeLV infection and the clinical course are determined by a combination of viral and host factors. some of the differences in outcome can be traced to properties of the virus itself. progressive infection with persistent viremia has been associated with a silencing of virus-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity host effector mechanisms. in experimental infection, an initial stage is sometimes noticed with transient and mild clinical signs, including fever, lethargy, signs of enteritis, stomatitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, respiratory tract disease, and generalized lymph node enlargement. the acute phase may last several days to a few weeks, after which cats will enter a period in which they appear clinically healthy. cats naturally infected with FeLV have a higher risk of developing lymphoma than uninfected cats. 80% of feline lymphomas and leukemias were reported to be FeLV-related. a reduction in prevalence of viremia has been noted in cats with lymphoma. cats from FeLV cluster households had a 40-fold higher rate of development of FeLV-negative lymphoma than those from the general population. FeLV proviral DNA was detected in lymphomas of cats that tested negative for FeLV antigen [43], also suggesting that the virus may be associated with a larger proportion of lymphomas than previously thought. c-myc, flvi-1, flvi-2 (contains bmi-1), fit-1, pim-1, and flit-1 have been identified. flit-1 insertion appears to represent a common novel FeLV proviral integration domain that may influence lymphomagenesis by insertional mutagenesis. omas with flit-1 rearrangement had no detectable ACVRL1 mRNA expression. normal thymuses and seven lymphoid tumors without flit-1 rearrangement had no detectable ACVRL1 mRNA expression. recombinant virus develops de novo in FeLV-A-infected cats. a few other tumors have been found in FeLV-infected cats. some may have an association with FeLV, others may have just been observed by chance simultaneously in an infected cat. the exact role of FeLV in the genesis of these tumors is uncertain. squamous cell carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, and mast cell tumor have been described in association with FIV infection [26,61,62,63,64,65,66], including squamous cell carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, and mast cell tumor. clonally integrated FIV DNA was found in lymphoma cells from one cat that had been experimentally infected six years earlier. prevalence of FIV infection in one cohort of cats with lymphoma was 37 cats with myelosuppression tested FeLV antigen-negative in peripheral blood. 2/37 cats (5%) were found regressively infected with FeLV by bone marrow PCR. FeLV provirus may interrupt or inactivate cellular genes in the infected cells. thrombocytopenia occurs secondary to decreased platelet production from FeLV-induced bone marrow suppression or leukemic infiltration. immune-mediated thrombocytopenia often accompanies immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in cats with underlying FeLV infection. FPLS consists of severe leukopenia ( 3000 cells/l) with enteritis and destruction of intestinal crypt epithelium that mimics feline panleukopenia caused by feline panleukopenia virus. FPV antigen has been demonstrated by electron microscopy despite negative FPV antigen tests. fected cats in a later phase of infection may have a variety of cytopenias. lymphopenia is caused by replication of the virus in CD4+ lymphocytes. neutropenia (usually mild) may also be seen. a polypeptide of the FeLV envelope was found to cause dose-dependent neurotoxicity associated with alterations in intracellular calcium ion concentration, neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth. neurologic signs in 16 cats with progressive FeLV infection consisted of abnormal vocalization, hyperesthesia, and paresis progressing to paralysis. dementia in human patients with AIDS is often characterized by a slight decline in cognitive ability or behavior. neurological abnormalities seen in naturally infected cats tend to be more behavioral than motor. psychotic behavior, twitching movements of the face and tongue, compulsive roaming, dementia, loss of bladder and rectal control, and disturbed sleep patterns have been observed. the exact mechanism of neuronal damage by FIV is unclear but may include neuronal apoptosis, effects on the neuron supportive functions of astrocytes, toxic products released from infected microglia. astrocytes are by far the most common cell type of the brain and are important in maintaining CNS neuronal vascular microenvironment. progressively FeLV-infected cats develop immunosuppression similar to that in HIV-infected people. the exact mechanisms of how the virus destroys the immune system are poorly understood. the exact mechanisms of how the virus destroys the immune system are poorly understood. IL-2 and IL-4 are decreased in some cats [7,102] but FeLV does not suppress IL-1 production from infected macrophages. increased TNF- has been observed in serum of infected cats and in infected cells. infections with many different pathogens of viral, bacterial, protozoal, and fungal origin have been reported in FIV-infected cats. most important immunologic abnormality shown in experimental [104,105,106] as well as in natural [107,108] infection is a decrease in the number and relative proportion of CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood as well as in most primary lymphoid tissues. FIV env proteins are capable of inducing apoptosis in mononuclear cells by a mechanism that requires CXCR4 binding. loss of CD4+ cells impairs immune responses, because CD4+ cells have critical roles in promoting humoral and cell-mediated immunity. changes in cytokine pattern include increased production of IFN-, TNF-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12. retrovirus-infected cats develop immune-mediated diseases caused by an overactive immune response. secondary immune-mediated diseases are more commonly seen in FIV- than in FeLV-infected cats. cats with glomerulonephritis have more circulating viral proteins than other FeLV-infected cats. antigens that can lead to antigen complex formation include whole virus particles, but also free gp70, p27, or p15E proteins [162,163] the cause of this syndrome is unclear, but the histologic findings suggest an immune response to chronic antigenic stimulation or immune dysregulation. this type of stomatitis is not always correlated with FeLV or FIV infection. this type of stomatitis is not always correlated with FeLV or FIV infection. cats with lymphoma have a higher risk of developing lymphoma than uninfected cats. 80% of feline lymphomas and leukemias were reported to be FeLV-related. since the 1980s a reduction in prevalence of viremia has been noted in cats with lymphoma. proviral DNA was detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue in 7/11 FeLV-negative cats with lymphoma [43], but other groups found evidence of provirus in only 1/22 [45] and in 0/50 FeLV antigen-negative lymphomas [47] it is unclear how common regressive FeLV infection is responsible for FeLV-associated tumors. c-myc, flvi-1, flvi-2 (contains bmi-1), fit-1, pim-1, and flit-1 have been identified. flit-1 insertion appears to be associated with over-expression of cellular genes, e.g., activin-A receptor type II-like 1. FeSV is an acutely transforming (tumor-causing) virus, leading to a polyclonal malignancy with multifocal tumors arising simultaneously after a short incubation period. with the decrease in FeLV prevalence, FeSV also has become less common. multiple osteochondromas (cartilaginous exostoses on flat bones of unknown pathogenesis) have been described in FeLV-infected cats. they may cause significant morbidity if they occur in an area such as a vertebra and put pressure on the spinal cord. clonally integrated FIV DNA was found in lymphoma cells from one cat that had been experimentally infected six years earlier. prevalence of FIV infection in one cohort of cats with lymphoma was 50% [60], much higher than the FIV prevalence in the population of cats without lymphomas. provirus-containing myelomonocytic progenitor and stromal fibroblasts may cause bone marrow disorders by inducing the expression of antigens on the cell surface. anemia occurs in a majority of FeLV-infected cats. most FeLV-associated anemias are non-regenerative. myeloid hypoplasia of all granulocytic stages is observed, suggesting infection on neutrophil precursors. in some neutropenic FeLV-infected cats, an arrest in bone marrow maturation can occur at the myelocyte and metamyelocyte stages. severe leukopenia ( 3000 cells/l) with enteritis and destruction of intestinal crypt epithelium that mimics feline panleukopenia caused by FPV infection. FPV antigen has been demonstrated by electron microscopy despite negative FPV antigen tests. it appears that this syndrome might actually not be caused by FeLV itself, as previously thought. anemia and thrombocytopenia were not significantly more common in FIV-infected versus uninfected cats. only neutropenia was significantly more often present, in about 25% of FIV-infected cats. neurologic dysfunction may be present in FeLV- and in FIV-infected cats. the polypeptide from a FeLV-C strain was significantly more neurotoxic than the same peptide derived from a FeLV-A strain. neurologic signs in 16 cats with progressive FeLV infection consisted of abnormal vocalization, hyperesthesia, and paresis progressing to paralysis. some cats developed anisocoria or urinary incontinence during the course of their illness. others had concurrent FeLV-related problems such as myelodysplastic disease. a much higher proportion of infected cats have microscopic CNS lesions. brain lesions may occur in the absence of massive infection. abnormal neurologic function is the result of a direct effect of the virus on CNS cells. astrocytes are the most common cell type of the brain and are important in maintaining CNS neuronal vascular microenvironment. excessive extracellular glutamate can significantly inhibit their glutamate-scavenging ability, potentially resulting in neuronal damage. immunosuppression can lead to secondary infectious diseases accounting for most clinical signs. pathogenic immunosuppressive variants require a membrane-spanning receptor molecule (Pit1) and a second co-receptor protein (FeLIX) to infect T lymphocytes. the latter protein is an endogenously expressed protein encoded by an endogenous provirus arising from FeLV-A. cytokine plays a vital role in the generation of a normal immune response. the excess production of certain cytokines, such as TNF-, can also cause illness. cytokine plays a vital role in the generation of a normal immune response. the most important immunologic abnormality shown in experimental [104,105,106] as well as in natural [107,108] infection is a decrease in the number and relative proportion of CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood. loss of CD4+ cells leads to inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. a certain subset of CD4+ cells, the \u201cTreg\u201d (for T-regulatory cells), seems to play an important role. increased activity of Treg cells could thus play a role in suppressing immune responses to foreign antigens or pathogens. other immunologic abnormalities can be found. retrovirus-infected cats develop immune-mediated diseases caused by an overactive immune response. the most commonly seen immune-mediated response is a hypergammaglobulinemia which is caused by an excessive antibody response against the chronic persistent infection. secondary immune-mediated diseases are more commonly seen in FIV- than in FeLV-infected cats. onephritis have more circulating viral proteins than other FeLV-infected cats. antigens include whole virus particles, but also free gp70, p27, or p15E proteins. hypergammaglobulinemia reflects polyclonal B-cell stimulation. FeLV can cause severe clinical syndromes, and progressive FeLV infection is associated with a decrease in life expectancy. diseases secondary to immunosuppression account for a large portion of the syndromes seen in FeLV-infected cats."}
