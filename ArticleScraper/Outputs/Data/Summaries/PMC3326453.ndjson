{"summary": "V2+ CD4 memory T cells from four 20- to 35-y-old and four 70- to 75-y-old individuals were stimulated with toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) presented by myeloid dendritic cells derived from young adults. gene expression was examined at 16, 40, and 72 h after stimulation. DUSP4 expression in resting nave or memory CD4 T cells was minute. transcription was induced within the first 40 h in both cell populations. kinetics in nave CD4 T cells were not dependent on age. DUSP4 expression in CD4 memory T cells from 11 20- to 35-y-old (open bars) and 13 65- to 85-y-old (closed bars) adults were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Ab. DUSP4 transcript numbers after 72 h are shown as mean SEM. CD4 memory T cells were transfected with EGR1-specific siRNA. DUSP4 protein expression peaked 48 h after CD3/CD28 stimulation. compared with CD3 stimulation, signal intensity of DUSP4 was reduced. activation-induced DUSP4 expression in CD4 memory T cells increases with age. DUSP4 protein expression was quantified at indicated time points after stimulation. a representative blot with cells from 26- and 70-y-old individuals is shown. transfected DUSP4 had predicted substrate specificity (26) in T cells transfected with the DUSP4-containing vector. ERK and JNK phosphorylation 10 and 30 min after cross-linking was blunted. phosphorylation of p38 was not affected in gated GFP-positive CD4 memory cells. DUSP4 impairs CD4 T-cell differentiation, with preferential inhibition of some, but not all, effector functions. CD4 T cells from healthy adults were transfected with control or DUSP4-expressing pIRES2-AcGFP1 vector. CD4 memory T cells from 11 20- to 35-y-old and 11 65- to 85-y-old individuals were activated by culture on immobilized anti-CD28 antibodies. at 48 h, expression of CD69 and CD40L continued to decline and did so faster in elderly CD4 T cells. CD4 memory T cells were activated with plate-immobilized anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Ab. expression of activation markers was monitored by flow cytometry 48 (Left) and 72 (Right) h after stimulation. memory CD4 T cells from elderly individuals that were transfected with the DUSP4-specific siRNA and activated for 48 h had increased ERK and JNK phosphorylation on restimulation compared with control transfected T cells. differences were significant but not pronounced; they are likely an underestimate of the silencing effect, because DUSP4 is strictly restricted to the nucleus. DUSP4 silencing did not majorly influence the production of IL-2 or IFN- in CD4 memory T cells from young or elderly individuals. in contrast, the frequencies of cells producing IL-4, IL-17A, and IL-21 were increased by DUSP4 silencing. the increase was most pronounced in CD4 memory T-cell responses from the elderly. CD4+HLA-DR+CD38+ cells were sorted from positively selected peripheral blood T cells and analyzed for transcript expression by qPCR. DUSP4 expression in in vivo-activated CD4 T cells after influenza vaccination inversely correlate with T-helper markers. DUSP4 silencing in memory CD4 memory T cells improves T cell-dependent B-cell responses. we used a coculture system using T cells from 20- to 35-y-old and 65- to 85-y-old individuals. results are expressed as percent increase in the cultures with DUSP4 silenced compared with control transfected T cells for the young (open bars) and elderly (closed bars) adults. cell surface expression of CD86 in the cultures with DUSP4-silenced compared with control-transfected T cells. expression of E47 is dependent on p38 activity in B cells. expression of E47 was significantly lower in B cells that were cocultured with memory CD4 T cells from 65- to 85-y-old individuals. DUSP4 silencing in the T-cell population improved the ability of T cells to up-regulate E47 expression in B\u2013T cell cultures. the frequency of NP-specific B cells was significantly lower when DUSP4-transduced T cells were adoptively transferred (P = 0.003) antigen-specific B cells were nearly absent in hosts adoptively transferred with DUSP4-expressing T cells compared with 400,000 in the mice adoptively transferred with the control transduced T cells (P = 0.009) expression of CD40L and ICOS was determined on splenic CD4 T cells by flow cytometry. results are representative of two experimental series with four mice each and are shown as mean SEM. DUSP4 expression in resting nave or memory CD4 T cells was minute. transcription was induced within the first 40 h in both cell populations. kinetics in nave CD4 T cells were not dependent on age. berasi et al. (25) identified the transcription factor early growth response protein (EGR)1 as a key regulator of DUSP4 transcription. EGR1 transcript levels were up-regulated in T-cell responses from elderly individuals. the higher DUSP4 expression is caused by increased responsiveness to transcribe EGR1 after TCR stimulation. CD4 memory T cells were transfected with EGR1-specific siRNA. DUSP4 protein expression peaked 48 h after CD3/CD28 stimulation. compared with CD3 stimulation, signal intensity of DUSP4 was reduced. to 35-y-old and five 65- to 85-y-old healthy individuals were precipitated with anti-DUSP4 antibodies. these data convincingly show that activation-induced transcription of DUSP4 increases with age and results in increased and more sustained DUSP4 protein expression. results are shown as mean SEM from experiments with cells from five young (open bars) and five older (closed bars) adults. transfected DUSP4 had predicted substrate specificity (26) transfected DUSP4 had predicted substrate specificity (26) DUSP4 overexpression neither increased the frequency (by impairing effector cell differentiation) nor decreased IL-2 production (by interfering with T-cell activation) IL-4 (P 0.001), IL-17A (P 0.001), and IL-21 (P 0.001) production were all suppressed by the overexpression of DUSP4. DUSP4 expression is minimal in resting T cells and peaks at 48 h and later. we would expect that CD4 T cells from young and elderly adults differ in their ability to sustain the expression of activation markers and differentiate. DUSP4 silencing improves T-cell activity in the elderly. CD4 memory T cells were activated with plate-immobilized anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Ab. expression of activation markers after 72 h is shown as the percent increase after DUSP4 silencing. IL-4 in supernatants from cultures as described in E was measured by ELISA. repression of DUSP4 had the expected functional consequences on the MAPK signaling pathways. memory CD4 T cells from elderly individuals that were transfected with the DUSP4-specific siRNA and activated for 48 h had increased ERK and JNK phosphorylation on restimulation compared with control transfected T cells. expression of CD40L increased by close to 50% (P 0.001 compared with the improvement seen with young CD4 memory T cells) DUSP4 silencing did not majorly influence the production of IL-2 or IFN- in CD4 memory T cells from young or elderly individuals. antigen-specific CD8 T cells peak on days 7\u201314 and are contained within HLA-DR+CD38+ T cells (27, 28) in pilot studies, this marker profile was best-suited for identifying activated CD4 T cells. data from young (open squares) and elderly (closed bars) individuals are shown as mean SEM. DUSP4 silencing in CD4 memory T cells improves T cell-dependent B-cell responses. cultures were examined for the frequencies of CD19+CD38+IgD\u2013 and CD19+CD27+ cells. results are shown as mean SEM. cells cultured as described in C were assessed for the transcription factor E47 by qPCR. DUSP4 silencing in the T-cell population improved the ability of T cells to up-regulate E47 expression in B\u2013T cell cultures. increased DUSP4 in activated CD4 memory T cells impairs their ability to express molecular mediators important in providing B-cell help. the frequency of NP-specific B cells was significantly lower when DUSP4-transduced T cells were adoptively transferred. DUSP4 expression in T cells suppresses humoral responses after immunization in vivo. splenic CD4 T cells, B220 B cells, NP-specific B cells, and germinal center B cells were harvested on day 14. expression of CD40L and ICOS was determined on splenic CD4 T cells by flow cytometry. DUSP4 belongs to the family of dual-specific phosphatases that dephosphorylate both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues on MAPK. DUSP4 is one of four phosphatases that are transcriptionally induced on stressors and located in the nucleus. T-cell activation only up-regulated the expression of DUSP4 and DUSP5. only the activation-induced expression of DUSP4 was age-dependent. reduced ability to mount robust humoral responses with age reflects a combination of T- and B-cell intrinsic defects. DUSP4 overexpression, as well as silencing, modified activation-induced ERK and JNK while not affecting p38 phosphorylation. the ERK pathway has been implicated in Th2 differentiation in several studies. in KO mice, T cells hyperproliferated, exhibited decreased activation-induced cell death. DUSP-mediated inactivation of nuclear ERK2 represents a key event in the establishment of replicative senescence. the restoration of nuclear ERK activity by DUSP inhibition by DUSP inhibition may bypass critical senescence checkpoints. improved vaccination strategies are needed to overcome age-related immune defects. the current approaches are focused on improving vaccine formulations. a two-pronged strategy might be advantageous by targeting T-cell defects in addition to enhancing vaccines. cells were purified from CD45RA\u2013CD4+ memory T cells with biotin\u2013anti-human TCR V2 mAb (Beckman Coulter) and positive selection using antibiotin magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using lymphocyte separation medium. mononuclear cells were stained with ACK lysis buffer (Invitrogen) mononuclear cells were stained with APC-CD3\u2013, PerCP/Cy5.5-CD4\u2013, FITC-CD38\u2013, and PE-HLA-DR\u2013specific antibodies. the cells were harvested before and at 16, 40, and 72 h after stimulation for gene expression analysis. each pair of subjects was compared, and four different probabilities were obtained for each gene. the maximum or geometric averages were adopted to yield a single score summarizing the evidence of differential expression. whole-cell lysates of activated CD4 memory T cells were incubated with anti-DUSP4 antibody and protein A/G plus-agarose. phosphatase activity was assessed using a pNPP phosphatase assay kit (BioAssay Systems) cells were left unstimulated for 16 h or restimulated with PMA plus ionomycin after 12 h for 4 h. Flow Cytometry was performed on an LSRII system (BD Biosciences) total CD4 or memory CD4 T cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector system and the human T-Cell Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) were transfected with 1.5 g DUSP4-specific siRNA or EGR-1\u2013specific siRNA. IL-4 in the supernatants was analyzed using the human IL-4 ELISA Ready-SET-Go Kit (eBioscience). T cells were treated with 30 g/mL mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, washed three times, and cocultured at a concentration of 1 105 cells/well for 7 d with 0.5 105 B cells purified from an unrelated young adult in 96-well flat-bottomed wells. the experimental protocol was approved by the Emory and Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 150 g NP-OVA (Biosearch Technologies) on day 12. splenocytes and serum were collected on day 14. each experiment was performed two times. CD4 T cells were negatively enriched with human CD4+ T-cell enrichment mixture (RosetteSep; StemCell Technologies) from whole blood. CD45RACD4+ memory T cells were further isolated by depleting CD45RA+ subsets with anti-CD45RA magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) peripheral blood was collected from an additional 10 18- to 35-y-old and 10 65- to 80-y-old individuals who received their annual influenza vaccination during the 2010\u20132011 influenza season. RNA was amplified and labeled using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Affymetrix GeneChips (U133A) hybridization was performed at the Institute for Systems Biology (Seattle, WA) to identify genes differentially expressed over time, we used the method implemented in Bioconductor (63) the approach uses information across genes and arrays to optimize model fit. lysate was cleared by centrifugation (12,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min) the supernatants were boiled in SDS loading buffer. proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. cells were transfected with either 4.5 g pGL3 basic vector or 4.5 g DUSP4-luc reporter construct. cells were left unstimulated for 16 h or restimulated with PMA plus ionomycin after 12 h for 4 h. freshly purified CD4 T cells were transfected with 4 g DUSP4-pEGFP-N1 (subcloned from pCDNA3.1 DUSP4 vector; a gift from Dr. Yin, Columbia University, New York, NY) or 4 g pEGFP-N1 vector using the Amaxa Nucleofector system and the human T-Cell Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) CD4 T cells (1 106/mL) were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. IL-4 in the supernatants was analyzed using the human IL-4 ELISA Ready-SET-Go Kit (eBioscience) DUSP4-overexpressing CD4 T cells (2 106 cells/mouse) were i.v. transferred into CD4 KO hosts. control hosts received empty vector-infected CD4 T cells. splenocytes and serum were collected on day 14. paired or unpaired t test as appropriate. DUSP4 and activation marker expression in vaccinated individuals were compared by Pearson's correlation. memory cells develop after first infection (or after vaccination) memory cells develop after first infection. DUSP4 is a nuclear enzyme that inactivates the cellular signaling molecules ERK and JNK. it helps control the development of effector T cells. reconstituted animals were immunized and analyzed for the induction of a B-cell response. DUSP4 expression in CD4 T cells reduces the expansion of antigen-specific B cells and production of antigen-specific antibodies. DUSP4 is an identified signaling molecule responsible for defective B-cell responses in the elderly. it holds promise as a therapeutic target."}
