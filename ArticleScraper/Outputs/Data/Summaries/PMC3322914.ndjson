{"summary": "the patient had a past history of vascular dementia with dysphagia and behavioral abnormalities, ischemic heart disease with atrial fibrillation, and congestive cardiac failure. she also suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees, and an old traumatic fracture of the left humeral neck. the patient's hemoglobin was 10.6 g/dL, leukocyte count was 7,200/mm3 and platelet count was 304,000/mm3. the liver function tests showed a total bilirubin, 10.6 mol/L; serum potassium, 5.0 mmol/L; serum sodium, 138 mmol/L; and creatinine, 79 mol/L. a repeat chest radiograph confirmed congestive cardiac failure. the patient was not intubated or moved to an intensive care unit. she went into respiratory failure and died on march 30. all cases in the cluster had fever as a presenting complaint. the index patient\u2019s cause of death was determined to be SARS. intravenous diuretic therapy was instituted but in view of her poor premorbid functional status, the patient was not intubated or moved to in an intensive care unit. all cases in the cluster had fever as a presenting complaint. the index patient\u2019s cause of death was determined to be SARS. the first three cases in Singapore were reported on march 13. the suspicion of SARS in this case was thus low before eventual epidemiologic links were established retrospectively. a bimodal pattern of time to deterioration of clinical symptoms has been previously reported. a bimodal pattern of time to deterioration of clinical symptoms has been previously reported. uncharacteristic clinical signs and symptoms, without any travel or contact history, are difficult to recognize. the case serves to highlight atypical signs and symptoms of SARS, especially the resolving fever, delay in establishing a positive contact history, and nonspecific chest radiographic appearance."}
