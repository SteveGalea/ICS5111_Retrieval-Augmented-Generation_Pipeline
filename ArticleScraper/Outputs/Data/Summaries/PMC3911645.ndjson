{"summary": "the prevalence of FeLV infection in cats has been reduced by the management of infected animals and vaccination but is still high in some populations (5\u20137) new molecular techniques have been developed to detect FeLV infection and have changed our understanding of FeLV pathogenesis. protection against persistent antigenemia can be obtained in the absence of neutralizing antibodies (22\u201324), suggesting a key role for vaccine-induced cell-mediated immune responses. the transmembrane moiety of the envelope glycoprotein (p15E) contains an immunosuppressive domain (ISD) which is conserved among gammaretroviruses (26). based on sequence comparison between the MLV and FeLV Env proteins, we identified a key amino acid responsible for IS activity of FeLV. we further substituted the mutant \u201coptimized\u201d FeLV Env antigen for the wild-type (wt) antigen present in a canarypox virus-vectored vaccine (ALVAC-FeLV) phCMV-FeLVenv vector with mutant env was obtained by three fragment ligations. PCR fragments were retrieved using the phCMV-FeLVenv vectors coding for the wt or mutant FeLV Env proteins and the primer pair 6-7. pDFG-FeLVenvecto and pDFG-FeLVenvectoER vectors were digested with the same enzymes. all the plasmids were checked by sequencing. 7.5 105 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. target cells (feline G355-5) were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 104 cells per well and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. five to 500 microliters of virus samples containing 4 g of Polybrene per ml was added to the cells and centrifuged for spinoculation. tumor cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized. 106 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in a shaved area of each mouse right flank. the IS index was calculated as (Aenv Anone)/Anone. both viruses were grown and titrated on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts. the vaccines were produced according to the same process. the proper expression of env was checked by immunofluorescence on CEF-infected cells and immunoblotting (quantitative dot blotting) sera were tested for FeLV p27 antigenemia by using the Witness FeLV kit or the Viracheck FeLV kit (Synbiotics Corporation, MO, USA) on a weekly basis from week 3 until week 15 postchallenge. proviremia was expressed as provirus copy number/50,000 WBCs. cells were cultivated in 6-well plates in complete RPMI. cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C 2\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for monocyte adherence. fresh complete RPMI with cytokines was added to each well. plates were washed three times in PBS\u20130.05% Tween and incubated for 15 min in the dark with the AEC (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole) substrate solution. plates were extensively washed with tap water and dried. frequency of peptide-specific IFN-sFC was calculated as follows. the 3 groups were compared for the frequency of antigenemia by using Fisher's exact test with the following scoring system: no antigenemia, 0; transient antigenemia, 1; persistent antigenemia, 2. If the global group effect was significant, pairwise comparisons were done using the Bonferroni adjustment method. the random effect was the \u201canimal\u201d effect. vCP2295 titer, 106.8 CCID50/dose; vCP2296 titer, 106.4 CCID50/dose. the frequency of FeLV-specific IFN-- or IL-10-positive cells was expressed in log units. the significance level was set at 5% for all tests. primer name 1 atacatctcgagaccggtccaactagaaccatggaaagtccaacgcaccc Env FeLV XhoAge-S 2 atacatacgcgttcatggtcggatcg Env FeLV Mlu-AS 3 gtgagggaaatgcaaccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc pDFG-FeLVenvecto and pDFG-FeLVenvectoER vectors were digested with the same enzymes. all the plasmids were checked by sequencing. 7.5 105 293T cells were transfected with 3 g of phCMV plasmids. at 36 h posttransfection, viral supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.45-m-pore-size membranes. target cells (feline G355-5) were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 104 cells per well and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. five to 500 microliters of virus samples containing 4 g of Polybrene per ml was added to the cells. tumor cells were kept in selective medium (400 units/ml hygromycin) for 3 weeks. tumor cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized. 106 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in a shaved area. the only difference between vCP2295 and vCP2296 was the mutation in the FeLV env gene in vCP2296. both viruses were grown and titrated on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts. the proper expression of env was checked by immunofluorescence on CEF-infected cells and immunoblotting (quantitative dot blotting) cats were challenged via the oro-nasal route with 104.2 CCID50 of a virulent strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV-A-Glasgow) blood samples were collected from week 3 to week 15 postchallenge for weekly detection of FeLV p27 antigen in the serum and quantification of FeLV proviral load. cells were cultivated in 6-well plates in complete RPMI (RPMI 1640, penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal calf serum) cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C 2\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for monocyte adherence. the following day, nonadherent cells were eliminated and fresh complete RPMI with cytokines was added to each well. plates were washed three times in PBS\u20130.05% Tween and incubated overnight at +4\u00b0C with biotinylated anti-IFN- monoclonal antibody BAF764 (R&D Systems) plates were then washed three times in PBS\u20130.05% Tween and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the plates were extensively washed with tap water and dried. IL-10 SFC = number of IL-10 SFC upon individual FeLV peptide pool restimulation number of IL-10 SFC upon irrelevant peptide pool restimulation. if the global group effect was significant, pairwise comparisons were done using the Bonferroni adjustment method. vCP2295 titer, 106.8 CCID50/dose; vCP2296 titer, 106.4 CCID50/dose. b Based on logistical regression analysis. the frequency of FeLV-specific IFN-- or IL-10-positive cells was expressed in log units. a fusion-positive, immunosuppression-negative specific mutant was produced. a fusion-positive, immunosuppressive-negative specific mutant was produced. a fusion-positive, immunosuppressive-negative specific mutant was produced. injection of MCA205 tumor cells (H-2b) into allogeneic BALB/c mice (H-2d) leads to the formation of no tumor or transient tumors that are rapidly rejected. injection of the same cells but stably expressing an immunosuppressive retroviral Env protein leads to the growth of larger tumors that persist for a longer time. this difference is not associated with a difference in intrinsic cell growth rate, since it is not observed in syngeneic C57BL/6 mutation of the E14 residue only slightly altered FeLV Env infectivity. we then tested the E14R mutant protein for its IS activity. ER mutation results in increased immune responses toward vaccine antigens. the number of cats with FeLV gag/pro/env-specific IL-10-producing cells was significantly higher in vCP2296-vaccinated cats than in vCP2296-vaccinated cats. the median frequency of FeLV gag/pro/env-specific IL-10-producing cells tended to be lower in vCP2296-vaccinated cats than in vCP2296-vaccinated cats. both FeLV gag/pro (stimulation with Gag/Pro peptides only)- and FeLV env (stimulation with Env peptides only)-specific responses measured by IFN- ELISpot as. a value of 1 was used for the calculation of the ratio. the frequency of FeLV-specific IFN-producing cells (expressed in log10) was higher in vCP2296-vaccinated cats (KW test, P = 0.07 for env and P = 0.05 for gag/pro; ANOVA, P = 0.05 for env/gag/pro-specific responses) the median frequency of FeLV Env-specific IL-10-producing cells (expressed in log10) was higher in vCP2295-vaccinated cats (KW test, all cats were inoculated with 104.2 CCID50 of a highly virulent FeLV strain. in the control group (group C), 100% of the cats became persistently antigenemic and were therefore considered not protected. in the vCP2295-vaccinated group (group B), 60% of cats were protected against persistent antigenemia. in vCP2295-vaccinated cats which resisted persistent antigenemia, the average proviral load peaked at 102.0 copies/50 103 PBMC at 3 weeks after challenge. in 3 vCP2296-vaccinated cats, the proviral load remained below 100 DNA copies per 50 103 PBMC. vCP2296-vaccinated group presented a proviremia ranging from 0 to 104.8 copies/50 103 PBMC at 3 weeks after challenge. proviremia decreased in most cats until 15 weeks postchallenge. average provirus loads in groups A and B were significantly lower than that in group C. the estimated PD80s are 106.8 CCID50/dose for vCP2295 and 106.0 CCID50/dose for vCP2296. a cat was considered protected if it was not persistently antigenemic. a cat was considered protected if it was not persistently antigenemic. the data shown are for the env (A)-, gag/pro (B)-, and gag/pro/env (C)-specific responses at day 35. the median ratio was higher in cats that did not develop persistent antigenemia. box-and-whisker plots show the median, lower, and upper quartiles as well as extreme values. a more detailed representation shows the linear organization of the FeLV Env, with the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits and the immunosuppressive domain (ISD) the ISD amino acid sequence is shown for the MLV and FeLV Env proteins. allogeneic mice were transduced with expression vectors for the FeLV Env ectodomain or control proteins and assayed for tumor cell growth upon both syngeneic and allogeneic engraftment. this difference is not associated with a difference in intrinsic cell growth rate, since it is not observed in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. we now demonstrate that the FeLV Env ectodomain is immunosuppressive. mutation of the E14 residue only slightly altered FeLV Env infectivity, a result consistent with detection by flow cytometry of equivalent levels of wild-type and mutant FeLV Env proteins in transfected 293T cells. we then tested the E14R mutant protein for its IS activity, using the in vivo rejection assay described above. the number of cats with FeLV gag/pro/env-specific IFN-producing cells was significantly higher in the vCP2296-vaccinated group than in the vCP2295-vaccinated group. the median frequency of FeLV gag/pro/env-specific IL-10-producing cells tended to be lower in vCP2296-vaccinated cats than in vCP2295-vaccinated cats. Vaccine Cat FeLV-specific SFC/106 PBMC IFN-/IL-10 ratioa Persistent FeLV p27 antigenemia postchallenge IFN- positive IL-10 positive vCP2295 (native env gene) a value of 1 was used for the calculation of the ratio. median frequency of FeLV Env-specific IL-10-producing cells was higher in vCP2295-vaccinated cats. median ratio was higher in vCP2296-vaccinated cats (KW test, P = 0.01 for env-, P = 0.04 for gag/pro, and P = 0.03 for env/gag/pro-specific responses) vCP2296-vaccinated group (group B), 60% of cats were protected against persistent antigenemia. five cats were never found positive, one cat had a transient antigenemia, and four cats had a persistent antigenemia. a trend toward a statistical significance was observed only between the group and controls. in vCP2295-vaccinated cats which resisted persistent antigenemia, the average proviral load peaked at 102.0 copies/50 103 PBMC at 3 weeks after challenge. in 3 vCP2296-vaccinated cats, the proviral load remained below 100 DNA copies per 50 103 PBMC. cats from groups A and B presented a proviremia ranging from 0 to 104.8 copies/50 103 PBMC at 3 weeks after challenge. proviremia decreased in most cats until 15 weeks postchallenge. vCP2295- and vCP2296-vaccinated cats were considered protected if it was not persistently antigenemic. the antigenemic status was consistent with proviral loads. cats that did not develop persistent antigenemia were those that were able to control their proviremia, as illustrated by proviral loads usually lower at peak (3 weeks after challenge) the median ratio was higher in cats that did not develop persistent antigenemia (KW test, P = 0.003 for env-, P = 0.02 for gag/pro-, and P = 0.004 for env/gag/pro-specific responses) the box-and-whisker plots show the median, lower, and upper quartiles as well as extreme values. vCP2296 induced a higher frequency of both FeLV env- and FeLV gag/pro-specific IFN--positive cells than vCP2295. a UV-inactivated Friend murine leukemia virus in which the IS domain of the envelope glycoprotein was mutated induced a stronger production of IFN- by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vaccinated mice. the nature of the IL-10-producing cells has not been assessed. but cells being induced by FeLV-derived peptides could be FeLV-specific T helper cells, adaptive regulatory T cells, or CD8+ T cells (48). however, we cannot rule out that the IS domain of FeLV p15E could also induce IL-10 production by other cells such as macrophages. the difference in the protection rates between vCP2295 and vCP2296 within each study was of limited extent. the difference in the protection rates between vCP2295 and vCP2296 within each study was of limited extent. the vCP2295 dose required to achieve 80% protection is 6 times higher than that for vCP2296. this natural adjuvant-like property of the vector may counteract to some extent the detrimental IS activity of FeLV Env expressed by the \u201cwild-type\u201d ALVAC-FeLV vaccine. this makes the difference between vCP2295 and vCP2296 even more remarkable. a bona fide veterinary vaccine has a direct negative impact on its immunogenicity. it could be a strategy to identify immunosuppressive domains within viral antigens. this could be a general strategy to identify immunosuppressive domains within viral antigens."}
