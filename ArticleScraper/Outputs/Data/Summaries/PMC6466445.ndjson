{"summary": "the disease is a significant cause of morbidity (100,000\u2013300,000 infections annually) and mortality (about 5000 fatalities annually) humans are infected after cutaneous-mucosal contact with contaminated fluids or feces from the natural host of LASV, the peridomestic rodent. arenavirus Z protein has multiple functions in the viral life cycle. it interacts with a variety of host-cell proteins that have been partially discovered. these associations may trigger or hijack numerous cell pathways that facilitate viral replication. autophagy may also deliver intracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to endosomal-pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and MHC-loading compartments, thus contributing to activate innate [33,34] and adaptive [35,36,37] antiviral immune responses. the role of autophagy during MOPV and LASV is still unknown. AH109 yeast cells were cloned by in vitro recombination. PCR products were co-transformed into the yeast two-hybrid vector pPC97-GW for expression in fusion downstream of the GAL4 transactivation domain (GAL4-AD) 86 vector linearized downstream of the GAL4-AD coding sequence. transformed cells were plated on selective -His media. cells were plated with 3AT at 5 mM for the MOPV-Z protein. after five days of culture on selective medium, growing colonies were scored. TAX1BP1 plasmids were engineered into pEGFP-C1. the same constructions were made for ZM and ZL-mCherry plasmids. eGFP-NDP52 was a kind gift from CIRI, Lyon, France. the cells were maintained for 72 h after siRNA transfection in six-well plates at 1.2 105 cells per well. the cells were then counted and infected with MOPV or LASV for 1 h in DMEM medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 0.5% PS. supernatants were clarified for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. supernatants were then incubated with M2 anti-FLAG magnetic beads. the beads were washed four times in lysis buffer before boiling 15 min in loading buffer. 2.8. Viral Entry Assays Twelve-well plates were seeded with 1.5 105 HeLa cells per well. cells were then infected with 50 M chloroquine (CQ) for 2 h. cells were then placed on ice for 30 min before transfer to 37 \u00b0C. infectious foci were detected by incubation with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against MOPV and LASV (mAbs L52-54-6A, L53-237-5 and YQB06-AE05), generously provided by Dr P. Jahrling. data were analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test or the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test to determine the significance of differences. a mating strategy was used to screen three different prey libraries. a human spleen cDNA library, a mouse brain cDNA library, and a normalized library containing 12,000 human ORFs. colonies were picked, replica plated, and incubated over three weeks on selective medium to eliminate potential contamination with false positives. ed with 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin (PS) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the GFP-LC3 HeLa cell line was grown in RPMI supplemented with 0.5% PS and 10% FBS. mopeia and Lassa viruses were cultivated in veroE6 cells at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. secondary antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-mouse conjugated to peroxidase. anti-rabbit conjugated to peroxidase (111-035-174) and anti-rabbit conjugated to peroxidase (111-035-174). RNAs against NDP52 (siNDP52) and TAX1BP1 (siTAX1BP1) were purchased from Ambion (thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) the efficiency of each siRNA was validated by Western blotting. the images were acquired using a confocal LSM 510 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with an Axioscope 63 oil immersion lens objective. s were immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibodies. cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 1300 rpm and washed two times with PBS. pellets were lysed using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Y2H screens allowed us to identify, among others, two known autophagy adaptors, namely NDP52 and TAX1BP1, which have been shown to interact with the Z protein of MOPV, but not LASV. NDP52 and TAX1BP1 are autophagy adaptors, known as sequestosome 1-like receptors (SLRs) they recognize motifs present on surface of invading pathogens through a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) and target them into autophagosomes through a LC3-interacting region (LIR) for selective degradation by autophagy. HT-Y2H Screening Hits Screening Validation by Gap-Repair Z MOPV Z LASV Z MOPV Z LASV TSG101 7251 Y2H Positive control [19] 13 36 x x TAX1BP1 8887 Selective autophagy adaptors involved in selective degradation by autophagy. 293T cells were transfected with LASV or MOPV C-terminal tagged FLAG Z protein and/or an N-terminal eGFP-fused NDP52 (eGFP-NDP52) or TAX1BP1 (eGFP-TAX1BP1) protein. this was contrary to the results of the Y2H screen. 93T and HeLa cells were transfected with control non-targeting siRNA, siNDP52, or siTAX1BP1. TAX1BP1 and NDP52 protein levels were much lower in siTAX1BP1 and siNDP52 transfected cells. infected cells with LASV or MOPV with an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. infectious particles from the supernatants were also titrated on Vero cells. error bars represent the standard error of the means from four independent experiments. d protein mainly degraded through autophagy; its degradation in cells indicating an effective autophagy flux. there was a large decrease in p62 levels two days after MOPV infection. however, p62 levels did not change in the LASV infected cells. the error bars represent the standard error of the means from five and four independent experiments for MOPV and LASV respectively. the images were acquired using the same microscope as in (A) with an Axioscope 63 oil immersion lens objective. the autophagy flux did not affect the viral entry or replication steps. the early stages of autophagy play an important role during the late stages of the MOPV and LASV life cycle. the error bars represent the standard error of the means from four independent experiments. the same cells as in (B) were lysed and the quantity of Z protein inside the cells has been measured by Western blotting. we investigated the role of the late stages of autophagy during MOPV or LASV infection by infecting HeLa cells with LASV or MOPV at an MOI of 0.1. cells were treated, or not, with CQ at a final concentration of 50 M for 48 h. three days after infection, cell supernatants and lysates were harvested. Y2H screens allowed us to identify two known autophagy adaptors, namely NDP52 and TAX1BP1, which have been shown to interact with the Z protein of MOPV, but not LASV. interactions between TSG101 and arenavirus Z protein have already been reported by others. the first and second columns correspond to the canonical gene names and gene IDs. column 5 shows the number of positive yeast colonies obtained for each cellular protein for the indicated virus Z protein. exogenous eGFP-NDP52 and eGFP-TAX1BP1 were detected by Western blotting. cells were cotransfected for 15 h and fixed for confocal microscopy. both LASV and MOPV Z matrix proteins interact with NDP52 and TAX1BP1 in transfected 293T and HeLa cells. eGFP-TAX1BP1 and eGFP-NDP52 colocalized with eGFP-NDP52. NDP52 and TAX1BP1 are neither involved in the replication nor release of MOPV or LASV infectious particles. the same cells as in (A) were then infected with LASV or MOPV with an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h before being maintained for three days at 37 \u00b0C. both MOPV and LASV Z proteins colocalized with GFP-LC3 puncta. p62 levels did not change in the LASV infected cells. p62 levels did not change in the LASV infected cells. all images were acquired using a confocal microscope with an Axioscope 63 oil immersion lens objective. the scale bar represents 20 m. cells were mock infected or infected with LASV or MOPV. autophagy in MOPV- or LASV-infected cells by reducing expression of ATG5. silencing of ATG5 was efficient 72 h after transfection. RT-qPCR and titration of infectious particles in supernatants revealed significantly less viral RNA and fewer infectious viral particles. phagy prevents endosomal acidification and is a well-known inhibitor of autophagosome maturation. it impairs the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and lysosomal protein degradation. the error bars represent the standard error of the means from four independent experiments. the same cells as in (B) were lysed and the quantity of Z protein inside the cells has been measured by Western blotting. we chose to screen the LASV and MOPV matrix-protein host interactors through Y2H screening because of its simplicity, its high throughput analysis, and the possibility to identify direct protein\u2013protein interactions. Y2H could represent a bias as Z protein is known to localize to cell membranes. authors have identified the WW-domain bearing protein BCL2 Associated Athanogene 3 (BAG3) as a negative regulator of Lassa VLP egress. BAG3 has several functions in cell cycle including a stress-induced role in chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) the nucleoprotein of LASV is known to interfere with type I interferon (IFN-I) production through the sequestration of the IKK complex, leading to inhibition of the IRF3 pathway. both Z and NP could act in concert to inhibit the IKK complex, thus controlling inflammatory response in infected cells. the absence of a difference in p62 levels over time in LASV-infected cells suggests that LASV does not affect autophagy flux. this phenomenon has been highlighted during HCV infection and is yet to be addressed for MOPV [56]. autophagy may be required for the MOPV and LASV life cycle at different steps. many viruses have developed strategies to induce autophagy and hijack the process for their own benefit. autophagy has been shown to have a dual role during HIV infection. antennavirus and hartmanivirus genomes do not contain genes encoding the Z protein. differences in the induction of autophagy during LASV and MOPV infection could also play a role in the immunogenicity induced by these viruses. autophagy may improve antigen presentation and subsequent killing of infected cells by the immune system, allowing the control of MOPV replication. autophagy may also improve antigen presentation and subsequent killing of infected cells by the immune system, allowing the control of the virus."}
