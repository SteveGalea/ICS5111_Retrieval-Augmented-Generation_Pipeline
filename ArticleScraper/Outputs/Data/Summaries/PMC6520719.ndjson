{"summary": "negative-sense RNA viruses are classified into segmented and non-segmented viruses. negative-sense RNA viruses are subdivided into families that contain two single-stranded genome fragments. the 2014 outbreak in west africa caused approximately 28,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. a randomized trial of three monoclonal antibodies that target the EBOV glycoprotein was shown to reverse EVD in non-human primates [5], but results from a randomized clinical trial were largely inconclusive [6]. unlike glycoprotein-based vaccines, the antibody cocktail is also not effective against all ebolavirus species. galidesivir is an adenosine-like compound with a nitrogen-substituted sugar ring. it also requires intracellular activation to the TP form. this compound serves as a substrate for the RdRp of HCV. it causes chain termination following its incorporation. active EBOV RdRp contains the L protein in complex with viral protein 35 (VP35) [33], which is the functional equivalent of P proteins [37]. we used the EBOV RdRp complex to study the mechanism of action of remdesivir. h-mtRNAP and viral protein complexes were purified using strep- or his-tag-affinity chromatography. the identity of the purified h-mtRNAP was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. DNA templates were used in reactions containing h-mtRNAP. reaction mixtures (10 L) were incubated for 10 min at 30 \u00b0C. reactions stopped after 30 min by the addition of 15 L of formamide/EDTA (50 mM) purification The pFastBac-1 (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) plasmid with the codon-optimized synthetic DNA sequences (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) coding for human mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP, NP_005026.3) or viral protein complexes of EBOV (L: AKG65102 and vp35: AKG65095 the amount of EBOV RdRp used in the RNA synthesis assay was optimized so incorporation of [-32P]-GTP would reach its maximum after 30 min. the amount of RSV and h-mtRNAP was optimized to have the similar apparent activity as EBOV RdRp by testing various amounts of enzymes. incorporated nucleotide product fraction was plotted versus nucleotide substrate concentrations and fitted to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) results 3.1. competition between remdesivir-TP and ATP. RNA products between positions i+2 and i+5 show even more complex shifts. however, a significant reduction in RNA synthesis is not evident. we therefore employed a systematic, quantitative approach to evaluate the inhibitory effects of remdesivir-TP. the ratio of Vmax/Km is a measure for the efficiency of AMP or remdesivir-MP incorporation. the ratio of Vmax/Km (AMP) over Vmax/Km (remdesivir-MP) defines the selectivity. remdesivir-TP is almost as efficient as ATP. b Km is a Michaelis\u2013Menten parameter reflecting the maximum velocity of nucleotide incorporation. c Selectivity of a viral RNA polymerase for a nucleotide substrate analogue is calculated as the ratio of the Vmax/Km values for ATP and remdesivir-TP. EBOV RdRp terminated the primer with AMP and remdesivir-MP. the rate of UMP incorporation is 6-fold reduced when the 3\u2032-end of the primer contains remdesivir-MP. this difference is primarily driven by a higher Km value. a Remdesivir A Remdesivir Substrate UTP Vmaxa (product fraction) 0.64 d 0.020 e (3%) f 0.65 0.016 (3%) 0.69 0.017 (3%) 0.61 0.014 (2%) Kmb (M) 1.2 0.18 (15%) 0.51 0.07 (15%) 1.0 0.12 (12%) 5.5 0.49 (9%) Vmax/Km 0.53 1.3 0.69 0.11 Inhibition c (fold) Ref. the control reaction in the presence of all four natural nucleotides yields the expected 14-mer full-length product. RNA synthesis in the absence of ATP and presence of remdesivir-TP is terminated at position i+5. this result points to delayed chain termination as a potential mechanism of action. incorporation of i+5 is the longest significant product. the 15-nt RNA product indicates minor reaction products corresponding to the length of the template plus one nucleotide that is likely generated in a template-independent manner. we also studied whether delayed chain termination at position i+5 can be overcome with higher concentrations of the natural nucleotide substrate at position i+6. 2\u2032C-methylated compounds are validated chain terminators for HCV RdRp and other positive-sense RNA viruses. ara-ATP is used as a substrate and causes chain termination with both enzymes. remdesivir-MP is incorporated at position i and causes delayed chain termination. presence of ATP, UTP, and CTP provides a control for mis-incorporations. incorporated ara-AMP acts as a chain terminator, 2\u2032-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated. remdesivir-MP shows delayed chain termination at position i+5. higher concentrations of ATP promote synthesis of faster migrating products. subsequent RNA products between positions i+2 and i+5 show even more complex shifts as a consequence of multiple competition events. ratio of Vmax/Km is a measure for the efficiency of AMP or remdesivir-MP incorporation. remdesivir-TP is almost as efficiently used as ATP. human mitochondrial RNA polymerase discriminates against the inhibitor.

RNA synthesis was studied with recombinant EBOV RdRp. RNA synthesis was monitored in the presence of [-32P]GTP, CTP, and ATP or remdesivir-TP. remdesivir-TP was previously shown to act as a chain terminator for several RdRp enzymes derived from both negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses. 2\u2032C-methylated compounds are validated chain terminators for HCV RdRp and other positive-sense RNA viruses [41,42,43]. ara-ATP is used as a substrate and causes chain termination with both enzymes. RNA synthesis was monitored with EBOV RdRp and RSV RdRp in the presence of [-32P]-GTP and various combinations of 100 M NTP and 100 M NTP substrate analogues. the presence of ATP, UTP, and CTP provides a control for mis-incorporations. the broad spectrum of antiviral activities associated with remdesivir raises the question of whether delayed chain termination is a unifying mechanism of inhibition. previous data have shown that the inhibitor is also incorporated by RSV RdRp [10] low cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of remdesivir are generally >100 M for various cell types. low inhibition of the cellular RNA polymerase also correlates in this case with CC50 values >100 M [46] this study warrants further investigation into structures of EBOV, RSV, or NiV RdRp complexes."}
