{"summary": "HBoV infections do not appear to be common in normal adults with respiratory illnesses but are mainly reported in immunocompromised individuals (2,3) serum total protein of 7.2 g/dL, albumin of 1.9 g/dL, normal liver transaminase, LDH of 177 IU/L, creatine kinase of 82 IU/L, immunoglobulin (IgG) of 1,516 mg/dL, procalcitonin of 0.830 ng/mL, and IgM of 149 mg/dL were negative. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral consolidations (a) and ground-glass opacities in her left lung. left ventricular motion on transthoracic echocardiography was normal. movirus A/B, HBoV, human syncytial virus A/B, human adenovirus, enterovirus, human parechovirus, and Legionella pneumophila and L. longbeachae were all negative. HBoV is a genuine human pathogen causing mild to severe respiratory tract infections that especially target children. HBoV is detected in nasopharyngeal specimens in about 0-8.6% of asymptomatic children (7). our hospital did not detect HBoV from BAL fluid in any of 50 asymptomatic adults. despite the high prevalence of pediatric HBoV infections, the virus continues to be underrecognized by many physicians. the authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI)"}
