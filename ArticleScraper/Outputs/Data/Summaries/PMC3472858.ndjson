{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) has reported that more than 16,000 cumulative deaths were reported from 213 countries due to H1N1 in february 2010. microfluidic immunoassay systems have been introduced because of their various advantages, including high throughput, high-efficiency, low-cost and minimized consumption of samples and reagents. several methods to immobilize antibodies on the sensor chip surface have been developed. this includes physical adsorption, covalent binding, and random orientation. previous methods have limitations in terms of denaturization, extra chemical modification and random orientation. the master stamp was fabricated using a micromilling process. the size and thickness of the stamp were 95 95 mm and 1.2 mm. chromium (50) and gold (100) were coated on the detection area. the PCR product was cloned into the NdeI-XhoI fragment of pET-6HGBP to make pET-6HGBP-H1a. cells were induced with 1 mM of isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) for the production of the fusion protein. the surface of a gold chip was characterized by SPR measurement using a BIAcore3000TM with an automatic flow injection system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) all experiments were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at room temperature. we used a plastic microinjection mold machine (A270C 400-100, ARBURG, Lossburg, Germany) to produce the microfluidic device in order to achieve cost-effectiveness and facilitate mass production. chromium (50) and gold (100) were coated on the detection area for further immobilization of GBP-H1a. pET-6HGBP-H1a was cultivated in LB medium (10 g/L bacto-tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 5 g/L NaCl) cells were induced with 1 mM of isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) for the production of the fusion protein. after centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, the pellet a fresh SPR sensor chip was attached to a separate chip carrier for easy assembly in the SPR system. all samples were injected onto the gold chip surface at a flow rate of 5 L/min for 10 min at room temperature. the surface was then washed and equilibrated using PBS. the design and fabrication process of microfluidic device are described in Figure 1(A) the key features of microstructures including welding lines, gold deposition on detection chamber, and backflow prevention structures are schematically demonstrated in Figure 1B. thermal bonding method has been popular to bond plastic-based microfluidic device. the integrated microfluidic immunosensor chips can reduce analytical time compared to conventional methods. a surface modification step was required for the immobilization of biomolecules. a specially engineered peptide was developed to immobilize onto the specific targeted surface, especially gold. all protuberant microstructures near to the microchannels were specially designed as welding lines. these lines would be melted by concentrating the ultrasonic energies on the top of the microfluidic chip. bindings were started at 150 s and the unbound samples were washed at 750 s. 4,000 RU value implies that about 4 ng of anti-H1 Ab was immobilized onto the gold surface area of 1 mm2. specific anti-H1 Ab against the H1 influenza surface antigen was applied to the GBP-H1a fusion protein-layered surface. microfluidic immunosensor chips were examined under same conditions of confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM510 Meta NLO, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) after immobilization for 1 h, all the chips were washed with PBS solution and BSA solution (1 mg/mL) was injected to the channels to prevent the non-specific binding then washed with PBS solution. the fluorescent intensity depends on the number of immobilized Cy3-labeled-Ab in the detection chamber under the same incubation period. as increasing the amount of Ab, the intensity line is getting increased over the time, which is properly matching with fluorescence images. infectious disease areas."}
