{"summary": "clinical studies have shown that the AGR2 protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers. however, the general biochemical functions of AGR2 in human cells remain undefined. it is of great interest to develop molecular probes specifically recognizing AGR2 for its detection. the binding motif of aptamer is an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion. aptamer probe has great potential to serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2. aptamers can recognize a wide variety of targets, including small molecules, proteins, cells and tissues rely on their diverse tertiary structures. aptamers have low molecular weight, fast tissue penetration rate, high stability and low immunogenesis. they can be chemically synthesized with low cost and modified easily with various reporters. aptamers have been found to inhibit protein\u2013protein interactions, such as receptor\u2013ligand interactions, and thus function as antagonists. aptamers have been found to inhibit protein\u2013protein interactions, such as receptor\u2013ligand interactions, and thus function as antagonists. the resulting AGR2-GST-beads were used as the positive target in SELEX. the GST-beads were used as negative control to remove non-specific surface binding sequences. the unbound DNAs were then incubated with AGR2-GST-beads for target-selection. the progress of the selection process was monitored by flow cytometry. the stronger binding of DNA library to AGR2 the more FAM labeled sequences bound to the beads, thus the higher fluorescence intensity the beads would emit. four sequences were chosen and synthesized for further characterization. three sequences from G-rich subfamily, C14A (appeared 2 times), C14B (appeared 3 times) and C14C (appeared 5 times), and one sequence C14D (appeared 2 times) from T-rich subfamily. truncated sequencesC14B0 and C14B1 from C14B were shown in Table 1. the majority of eliminated sequences were primer sequences. the majority of eliminated sequences were primer sequences. aptamer C14B1 has multiple stretches of guanines (CGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG CD spectrum of aptamerC14B1 showed a negative peak near 240 nm and a positive peak near 260 nm, a typical spectrum of a parallel G-quadruplex. melting temperature of C14B1 was found to be 59\u00b0C, which was independent of oligonucleotide concentration. it is well established that the existence of a monovalent cation (especially potassium) in the center of these tetrads can significantly stabilize aptamer C14B1 has a positive band near 260 nm that can be assigned to a parallel quadruplex structures. the structural stability of the aptamer relies heavily on [K+] AGR2-aMB is a ssDNA consisting of an streptavidin (SA) aptamer sequence [56], a C14B1 sequence, a short sequence complimentary to a small part of the SA aptamer sequence, and a fluorophore. a stable hairpin structure is formed by intramolecular hybridization between the SA aptamer sequence and the complementary sequence, temporarily disabling the probe's ability to bind with SA beads. aptamer sequence is in bold. no probe can bind to SA beads, and the beads fluoresce weakly. AGR2 at 100 nM concentration can be easily detected. aptamers selectively recognize AGR2 with nanomolar Kd values. the optimal aptamer C14B1 forms an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure. aptamer sequences and sensors reported here have great potential to serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. an 87-nucleotide (87-nt) single-stranded DNA library was subjected to the SELEX procedure. only the DNA sequences that did not bound to the GST-beads were collected. the collected sequences were then incubated with AGR2-GST-beads. selected pool with AGR2 (target protein) and GST (control protein) the red curve represents the background binding of unselected library. the final concentration of the selected pool in binding buffer was 100 nM. 2c, C14B can bind AGR2 with the highest affinity (Kd = 13.17.2 nM) the binding target of C14B was indeed AGR2. other three sequences have similar binding constants to AGR2 but a little weaker than C14B. aptamer C14B1 could bind to target AGR2 strongly, while there were no or little binding affinity towards thrombin, BSA and trypsin. the data were the average of triplicate experiment. aptamerC14B1 has multiple stretches of guanines (CGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG aptamers have been found to form G-quadruplex structures [49]\u2013[51]. it is well established that the existence of a monovalent cation (especially potassium) in the center of these tetrads can significantly stabilize G-quadruplexes [52]\u2013[54]. the binding affinity of C14B1 towards AGR2-beads was also investigated. the binding constants of C14B1 were measured and compared in the presence or absence of K+. the Kd value in the presence of K+ was determined to be 6.21.9 nM. AGR2-bound probe will bind to SA beads, which will fluoresce strongly because the probe is FAM labeled. target molecules can be detected and quantified by reading fluorescence intensity of SA beads through flow cytometer. aptamers selectively recognize AGR2 with nanomolar Kd values. aptamer sequences and sensors have great potential to serve as useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. plasmid pGEX-GST-AGR2 was transformed into the engineering strain BL-21. the GST-AGR2 fused protein was successfully linked to sepharose beads. final purified AGR2-GST-beads were stored in sterilized PBS buffer. the ssDNA pool was incubated with negative GST beads (1.0105 beads) for counter selection. the unbound or nonspecifically bound oligoes were removed by filtration. sequences bound to the target-coated beads were then amplified by PCR. ssDNA pool was incubated with 5104 AGR2-GST-beads or GST-beads in binding buffer (200 L) for 45 min in the dark. beads were washed three times with 200 L binding buffer by means of filtration. fluorescence intensity of the resulting beads was monitored with a FACSAria cytometer. spectroscopy CD measurements were carried out on a jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a programmable temperature-control unit. the concentration of DNA samples was 2 mM. each CD spectrum was an average of 8 scans with the buffer background subtracted. te at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. 1 L of streptavidin beads (about 5104 beads) were added. the mixture was allowed to set for 45 min in dark. the ssDNA pool (200 pmol) was denatured by heating at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, then quickly cooled on ice for 10 min. the ssDNA pool was then incubated with negative GST beads (1.0105 beads) for counter selection to remove sequences non-specifically binding to GST beads. aptamers were incubated with 5104 AGR2-GST-beads or GST-beads in binding buffer (200 L) at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. beads were washed three times with 200 L binding buffer by means of filtration, and suspended in binding buffer (250 L) the unselected ssDNA library was used as negative control for the nonspecific binding evaluation. all binding experiments were repeated two to four times. the mean fluorescence intensity of target protein labeled by aptamers was used to evaluate binding affinity.
