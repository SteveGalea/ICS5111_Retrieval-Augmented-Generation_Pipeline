{"summary": "study bovine lung fragments, deep nasal swab specimens, and trans-tracheal aspiration liquids were submitted to the Laboratoire D\u00e9partemental d\u2019Analyses de Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire (Toulouse, France) 134 samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription PCR for influenza D virus. six (4.5%) were positive for influenza D virus: 1 each in 2011 and 2012 and 4 in 2014. the specimen with the lowest Ct value, D/bovine/France/2986/2012 (Ct 15) was selected for further molecular characterization. it was sequenced on a 3130XL Applied Biosystems capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) GTTTGTGGGACTGAGCAATC FluD_HE-1350R: CCCTGCTTGCGGTATTATC FluD_HE-1267F: CCCAAGTATGGCAGATG fluD_HE-2042R: GCAGAGGATTTTTTGACGC FluD-MP-670R: CCCATATGCTATTCTTGAC FluD-MP-602F: AAAAAAGAGGCCCAGAC FluD-MP-1212R: GCAAGAGGATTTTTTT we found no evidence of reassortment between influenza C and D (C/OK-like) viruses. the splicing pattern of the matrix gene segment and the reduced 5-N-acetyl binding pocket in the hemagglutinin-esterase protein of D/bovine/France/2986/2012 was similar to that of human influenza C virus. influenza D viruses ranged from 0.8 to 5.7% and were as follows: 1.9%\u20132.1%, 0.8%\u20130.9%, 2.1%\u20132.5%, 2.3%\u20132.7%, 1.8%\u20133.8%, 3.6%\u20134.2%, and 5.1%\u20135.7% for polymerase basic (PB) 2, PB1, polymerase 3/polymerase acidic, nucleoprotein, matrix, nonstructural protein. changes in virulence, antigenicity, receptor-binding preference, fusion activity, and immune evasion have been linked to influenza A viruses. the missing potential glycosylation site in D/bovine/France/2986/2012 is located at position 513, probably in the F3 = HE2 fusion domain of the protein (6) and not in the globular head of the protein (5). surveillance projects with larger cohorts, as well as experimental infections, need to be conducted before the causality between respiratory symptoms and influenza D virus infection in cattle can be established."}
