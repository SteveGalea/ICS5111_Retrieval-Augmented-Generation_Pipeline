{"summary": "each infected host is likely to carry viral populations with potentially high genetic diversity. a full-genome approach becomes crucial when dealing with segmented RNA viruses. dsRNA was fragmented and subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis. the quality of the sequences was enhanced by trimming off low-quality bases using the CLC Genomics Workbench. the 10 segments of BTV serotype 16 strain ITL2002 were amplified successfully for their entire length. nucleotide sequences for BTV-16 ITL2002 have been deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers KF387521 to KF387530."}
