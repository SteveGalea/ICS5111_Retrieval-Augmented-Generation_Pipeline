{"summary": "prevalence of pneumonia ranged from 0.06\u20130.27 episodes per person-year to 184\u20131,223 deaths per 100,000 population. overall incidence and mortality were stable or decreased over the study period and were higher in rural compared to urban areas. available estimates of the burden of childhood pneumonia in china vary widely. pneumonia accounts for an estimated 17% of all child deaths in china. 67% of all childhood pneumonia deaths in the western Pacific region. clinical and community-based studies with primary data collection in humans were identified through a literature search conducted in November 2008. studies conducted exclusively in Hong Kong special administrative region (SAR), Macao SAR or Taiwan, China, were excluded. we also excluded studies focusing exclusively on SARS and avian influenza, outbreak reports, diagnostic studies of pneumonia etiologies. study population types were divided into rural, urban or both according to regulations promulgated by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2006. incidence is reported as the annual number of pneumonia episodes per year (i.e., person-years) for manuscripts presenting incidence per 100,000 population, data were converted to person-years. quality evaluation of included studies Based on published recommendations for measuring quality of epidemiologic studies of pneumonia [15], we assessed quality using the following six criteria: geographic location was reported, study was conducted for a period of at least one year or multiples of one year to account for seasonal factors. literature review and inclusion criteria excluded studies focusing exclusively on SARS and avian influenza, outbreak reports, diagnostic studies of pneumonia etiologies. study population (e.g., age group); study design; site of case detection; pneumonia case definition; pneumonia-related incidence and mortality. study population types were divided into rural, urban or both according to regulations promulgated by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2006. incidence is reported as the annual number of pneumonia episodes per year (i.e., person-years) the specific signs and symptoms for each case definition are detailed in Table S1. we reviewed the quality of each manuscript based on published recommendations for measuring quality of epidemiologic studies of pneumonia [15] five (36%) of the 14 incidence articles and 3 (11%) of the 28 mortality articles were identified using Pubmed [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [23], [23], [23], [23], [19], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [23], [23], [23], [23], [23], [21], [22], [23], [23], [23], [23], [23 incidence age Based on 6 studies, the age-specific incidence of pneumonia in children 1 year of age ranged from 0.01\u20130.68 episodes per person-year using either clinical or WHO case definition. one study presented a pneumonia incidence for adults: 0.037 episodes per person-year for people 65 years of age [20]. pneumonia incidence among children 5 years of age was lower than southern china. there were no studies exclusively in the North Central or Northwest regions. pneumonia incidence among children 5 years of age was higher in southern than in northern provinces. case fatality rates were higher in children 1 year of age (4.67\u20134.88%) than in children 5 years of age (0.52\u20131.94%). one study in adults, which included older adults up to age 94 years, found a case fatality rate of 9.98% [22]. pneumonia mortality ranged from 10.75 to 15.13 in rural areas compared with 2.60 to 2.79 in urban areas. a study in Jiangsu province found 4.18 and 1.12 deaths per 1000 live births in rural and urban areas. there was at least one study of mortality from each of the six regions. five (33%) of 15 incidence studies and only 1 (4%) mortality study included chest x-ray in their case definition. only 5 (18%) of the 28 mortality studies met all six quality criteria. pneumonia incidence in children 5 years of age decreased from 1997 to 2000 by 64% in Yunnan province (0.083 in 1997 versus 0.030 episodes per person-year in 2000) pneumonia incidence in children 5 years of age decreased from 1997 to 2000 by 64% in Yunnan province (0.083 in 1997 versus 0.030 episodes per person-year in 2000) and by 47% in Qinghai province. pneumonia incidence in children 14 years of age in eastern china (range 0.041\u20130.057 episodes per person-year) was higher than in western and central china (range 0.032\u20130.035 episodes per person-year) based on 6 studies, the age-specific incidence of pneumonia in children 1 year of age ranged from 0.01\u20130.68 episodes per person-year using clinical case definition. mortality rates ranged from 485 to 890 deaths from pneumonia per 100,000 population for children 1 year of age [25], [29], [30], and from 184 to 1223 deaths from pneumonia per 100,000 population for children 5 years of age [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. case fatality rates were higher in children 1 year of age (4.67\u20134.88%) than in children 5 years of age (0.52\u20131.94%) one study in adults, which included older adults up to age 94 years, found a case fatality rate of 9.98% [22] mortality for infants 1 year old ranged from 10.63 to 15.06 cases per 1,000 live births in rural areas compared with 2.29 to 2.54 cases per 1,000 live births in urban areas. for children 5 years, pneumonia mortality ranged from 10.75 to 15.13 in rural areas compared with 2.60 to 2.79 in urban areas. deaths from pneumonia per 100,000 population for children 1 year of age. estimates ranged from 0.66 to 12.8 deaths for children 1 year of age. cases were higher in children 1 year of age (4.67\u20134.88%) than in children 5 years of age (0.52\u20131.94%). rural vs. urban areas Nineteen (68%) of 28 mortality studies were conducted in both urban and rural areas. 6 (21%) were conducted in rural areas and 2 (7%) were conducted in urban areas only. pneumonia mortality in rural areas was generally higher than in urban areas. three studies evaluated hospital-acquired pneumonia in Shanghai. pneumonia rates ranged from 1.6% to 2.4% of hospitalized patients. pneumonia remains the leading cause of childhood mortality in china. most studies spanned multiple years, which would account for differences in seasonality of pneumonia. many calculated incidence based on relatively small populations or did not report the population under surveillance. most of these studies were conducted in large, urban centers primarily serving residents of densely-populated areas. improved pneumonia surveillance and case management could lead to more cases of pneumonia being promptly identified and treated. large scale programs to introduce less polluting cookstoves in china have led to decreases in lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [57], [58] b and influenza vaccines are commonly available in many parts of china through vaccination clinics. the first region in china, as well as Asia, where pneumococcal conjugate vaccines will be included in their routine childhood immunization program starting September 2009. in 2003, the indirect effect of preventing invasive pneumococcal disease in adults was over twice the direct effect of preventing cases in children. comprehensive data on pneumonia incidence and mortality are essential for monitoring disease trends, guiding policy decisions, and prioritizing disease prevention and control strategies."}
