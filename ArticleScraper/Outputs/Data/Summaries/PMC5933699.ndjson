{"summary": "the prototypical ebola virus (EBOV; Zaire ebolavirus) was responsible for the recent west africa outbreak that resulted in 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths between 2014 and 2016. survivors of ebolavirus disease can carry the virus in immunologically privileged sites for over one year, post-recovery from the acute infection. ebolavirus is the only member that is nonpathogenic in humans for reasons that are still unclear. the majority of research has focused on ebolavirus, as this species has been associated with the greatest number of outbreaks. many novel or species-specific functions of ebolavirus proteins may be undiscovered. post-translational modification of the GP protein results in two GP subunits after cleavage by host furin. slight differences in gene overlap and presence of intergenic regions are evident between the different ebolavirus species. VP24 is known to inhibit IFN-/ and IFN- activation by binding to key host proteins from the karyopherin family (karyopherin 1, 5, and 6) preventing their binding to and the subsequent nuclear import of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) VP24 blocks IFN signalling by directly binding to STAT1, preventing its phosphorylation and nuclear import. the innate response antagonist domains in EBOV VP24 and VP35 have been implicated in preventing the maturation of EBOV-infected dendritic cells by modulating global gene expression. this effect required both VP24 and VP35 IRAD domains, though the VP24 IRAD domain alone was sufficient to down-regulate cytokine signalling pathways. VP24 has also been seen to function in capsid assembly [18] evidence suggests VP24 binds to VP35 on the outer surface of the nucleocapsid. VP24 may be necessary for incorporation of the viral RNA (vRNA) genome into the nucleocapsid. trVLPs showed a 2-fold reduction in RNA content and a 10-fold reduction of infectivity. VP24 may also have a length-dependent role in transcriptional regulation. it was observed that VP24 moderately inhibited the expression of reported genes from monocistronic minigenome plasmids. however, VP24 expression had no effect on protein expression from the trVLP tetracistronic genomes. VP35 inhibits the type-I IFN response through several different mechanisms. VP35 blockade of IRF3 and IRF7 phosphorylation inhibits the production of IFN-. VP35 interacts with L and facilitates genome transcription. the first 450 residues of VP35 appear to be essential for binding to L. the C-terminus associates with NP, thus linking NP and L during nucleocapsid assembly. NPBP peptide disassociates from NP, then RNA binds to NP, followed by NP oligomerisation. NP oligomerisation would then allow for RNA binding. VP35 interactions are crucial for virus replication and are being explored as targets for future therapeutics. VP30-RNA binding required specific base composition and structure of target RNA molecule. VP30 inhibits RNAi by interacting with Dicer, preventing TRBP binding and complex activity. VP40 also inhibits complex assembly by binding TRBP and PACT. matrix protein VP40 has roles predominantly in virus assembly and budding. VP40 can assemble either as a hexamer, which appears to be involved in budding. VP40 induces formation for exosomes capable of inducing bystander cell death. the precise mechanism in which VP40 interacts with miRNA machinery has yet to be characterised. the suppression of key proteins in the miRNA pathway has been previously linked to the induction of apoptosis. this is the first demonstration that the suppression of RNA silencing can be transferred to nave cells in the absence of virus. treatment with the drug Oxytetracycline reduced VP40 exosome release and significantly increased donor cell viability upon treatment with VP40 exosomes. the GP gene has been shown to encode for three different products due to transcriptional editing by L. EBOV GP has been shown to have a multitude of secondary roles beyond attachment and fusion that affect both virus replication and pathogenicity. several studies have shown that GP contributes to EBOV virulence; however, it is not sufficient on its own to be defined as a virulence marker. GP reduces the phosphorylation and catalytic activity of ERK2. the balance and timing of EBOV GP/sGP/ssGP/ssGP/shed-GP/-peptide expression has been found to be pivotal in virus replication. GP expression enhances VLP generation, suggesting a possible secondary role for GP in viral egress. activity occurs with cellular GP expression as well as following transfer of GP-containing VLPs. GP-induced endothelial cell activation may facilitate decreased barrier function. up-regulation of CAMs may facilitate adhesion and subsequent infection of immune cells. sGP binding to TLR4 directly triggers cell death through up-regulation of caspase 9. in dendritic cells, GP was found to interact with the liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) soluble molecule is capable of binding to and neutralising anti-GP antibodies, facilitating viral immune evasion. c13C6 antibody to sGP dimer up to pentagonal 5:5 antibody:sGP complexes. this further supports the hypothesis that sGP enhances viral immune evasion by biasing the antibody response towards sGP binding. recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus with rVSV-ZEBOV has been highly effective in preventing EVD. a 9U variant was seen that retained the high level expression of sGP but had enhanced expression of ssGP. this may act as a regulatory mechanism, enabling efficient virus replication in different host environments. at present, no other roles for the L protein have been postulated. many ebolavirus proteins interact with immune cells, causing cell death and facilitating viral replication and spread. ebolavirus VP35 protein is a suppressor of RNA silencing. ebolavirus VP35 protein is a suppressor of RNA silencing. an intrinsically disordered peptide from ebola virus VP35 controls viral RNA synthesis by modulating nucleoprotein-RNA interactions. key learning points Recent research has uncovered new functions of many ebolavirus proteins that appear to be unrelated to the protein\u2019s primary function during virus replication. ebola virus VP35 protein is a suppressor of RNA silencing. an intrinsically disordered peptide from VP35 controls viral RNA synthesis by modulating nucleoprotein-RNA interactions."}
