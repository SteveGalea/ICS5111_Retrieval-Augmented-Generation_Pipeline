{"summary": "preserved egg is a popular marinated egg product in china. the percentage of nine amino acids in preserved egg yolk and egg white was higher than fresh egg yolk and egg white after pickling. preserved eggs have higher protein contents and lower carbohydrate contents. algae polyphenols extracted from kelp can inhibit fish oil rancidity. antioxidant efficiency was 2.6-fold higher than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 2\u20133 wk were obtained from tongji medical college, Huazhong Science and Technology University. preserved eggs were obtained using clear material soaking method. the weight of each rat was measured every five days and the food intake was determined every three days. blood sampling and analyses The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the liver was extracted with tweezers. aliquots of GI digests were removed at 0 (pepsin digestion after 2 h), 1, 2, 3, 4 h (switch from 0 h to 4 h during pancreatin digestion) cell culture The human colon cell line Caco-2 was purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. the cells were exposed to 2.5, 5, 10 mg/mL of the GI digests for 24 h. after incubation, the cells were immediately collected and washed 2 times by PBS, then centrifuged at a speed of 2,000g for 5 min to remove the supernatant. the cells were collected after the lysate was added to the cells at a rate of 100 L/2/106 cells. materials and chemicals All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). the TG assay kit, TCHO assay kit, HDL cholesterol assay kit and LDL cholesterol assay kit were provided by Nanjing Jiancheng Biology Engineering Institute (China). the caspase-3 activity assay kit was purchased from beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (China). the rats were randomly divided into 4 experiment groups. the rest were labeled with 3% picric acid solution (yellow) and 0.5% neutral magenta solution (red) the other groups were administrated with the preserved egg powder. twenty-five female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 2\u20133 wk were obtained from tongji Medical College, Huazhong Science and Technology University. all rats were kept and treated according to the requirements of the laboratory animal ethics review committee. methanol and acetone mixture (1:1) centrifuged at 11,000g for 15 min. supernatant was collected and stored at -20\u00b0C. lipids, IL-6 and TNF- were mesured by the rat IL-6 ELISA kit and rat TNF- ELISA kit. cell culture The human colon cell line Caco-2 was purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. cells were placed into 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown at 37\u00b0C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM medium with high glucose, 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 units/mL streptomycin. incubation, the cells were immediately collected and washed 2 times by PBS, then centrifuged at a speed of 2,000g for 5 min to remove the supernatant. the cells were then incubated in dark at room temperature for 15 min prior to investigation by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Co., Ltd, USA) 2.5A105 cells/well of Caco-2 cells were placed in 6-well plates. the cells were exposed to 2.5, 5, 10 mg/mL of the GI digests for 24 h. the cells were immediately collected and washed 2 times by PBS. then centrifuged at a speed of 2,000g for 5 min to remove the supernatant. results were analyzed using software of IBM SPSS Statistics 20. all data were expressed as the meanstandard error. p0.05 was considered significant, and the origin 7.5 software was used for drawing. high dose preserved eggs elevated TG levels in rats. preserved eggs can regulate the absorption and metabolism of cholesterol. this could partly explain the fact that preserved egg could reduce the content of TG in a proper range. preserved eggs contribute to reduce risk of atherosclerosis (AS), cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and heart disease. levels of IL-6 and TNF- in rat\u2019s liver were significantly decreased compared to control group (p0.05) after treaments. the IC50 value of preserved eggs reached the lowest after 2 h gastric digestion and 2 h intestinal digestion. inhibition rate reached 56.64% when the GI digests concentration was 10 mg/mL, about 5.6 times than before intestinal digestion. cells were cleaved into fragments, and the cell morphology was collapsed. the effects of preserved eggs on the cell apoptosis of Caco-2 cells greatly dependended on the dose of GI digests. the significantly enhanced cell death rate was observed. induced cell apoptosis by up-regulating caspase-3 levels in Caco-2 cells. body weight of rats treated with preserved eggs for 80 days was not significantly different at the end of treatment from that of control rats (p>0.05) gain of body weight was normal in preserved egg-treated rats. level of cholesterol was 450 mg per 100 g preserved egg. as egg yolk is rich in TG, the intake of high dose preserved eggs elevated TG levels in rats. preserved eggs can regulate absorption and metabolism of cholesterol and counteract damage caused by excessive intake on the body. effects of preserved eggs on IL-6 and TNF- values in rat's liver. level of IL-6 and TNF- in liver significantly decreased compared to control group (p0.05) after treaments. the TG and TCHO contents of rats treated with the preserved eggs were significantly decreased (p0.05) compared with the control group after 80 days. in the high-dose group (4.2 mg/mL), the TG and TCHO contents in the liver were found to decrease by 13.3% (Fig. 2A) and 29.6% (Fig. 2B) respectively compared with the control group. preserved eggs significantly decreased the level of LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C in rat\u2019s liver after 80-days treatment (p0.05), by 92.8% (Fig. 3A) and 85.1% (Fig. 3B) in the low-dose group. in rat\u2019s liver were significantly decreased compared to control group (p0.05) after treaments. the IL-6 and TNF- values in liver were decreased 79.8% and 21.3% respectively. at 2.8 mg/mL of preserved eggs, the production of IL-6 was rather increased than control. we chose the sample that digested 2 h by pepsin and 2 h by trypsin to advance further experiments with the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL. IC50 value of viability in Caco-2 exposed to GI digests in different digestion time. cell apoptosis in Caco-2 exposed to gastrointestinal digests in different concentration. concentration (mg/mL) 0 2.5 5 10 Apoptosis rate (%) 0d 0.535c 4.79b 5.29a a-d Means (n=3) with different concentration, cell apoptosis in Caco-2 exposed to GI digests were significantly different. the IC50 value of preserved eggs reached the lowest after 2 h gastric digestion and 2 h intestinal digestion, which was 5.75 mg/mL. inhibition rate reached 56.64% when the GI digests concentration was 10 mg/mL, about 5.6 times than before intestinal digestion. Fig. 5 anti-proliferative effects of gastrointestinal digests on Caco-2 in different digestion time. the effects of preserved eggs on the cell apoptosis of Caco-2 cells greatly dependended on the dose of GI digests. the significantly enhanced cell death rate was observed (Fig. 7) this result suggested that the GI digests could cause apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. preserved eggs decreased the levels of TG, TCHO, and LDL/HDL in rat's liver. in the low-dose group, TG and TCHO contents were decreased by 19.5% and 6.8% respectively. this could be involved with several major influencing factors. apoptosis is a procedural and physiological form of death. the characteristics of apoptosis include cell morphological changes, the formation of DNA fragments, etc. tumor development is more likely to be blocked due to apoptosis, cell proliferation and apoptosis caused by imbalance. triggering of cell apoptosis has become the main treatment for anti-tumor purpose. preserved eggs could inhibit the release of inflammatory factors and induce apoptosis of tumor cells. preserved eggs possessed effective antilipemic capacity as evidence by the lipid level in rat\u2019s liver."}
