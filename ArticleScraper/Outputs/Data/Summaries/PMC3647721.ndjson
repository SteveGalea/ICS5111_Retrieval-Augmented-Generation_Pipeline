{"summary": "161 HBoV1 DNA\u2013positive NPA samples from an ongoing project on RTIs in children 0\u201316 years of age were used for evaluation. children with RTIs Of the 161 HBoV1 DNA\u2013positive samples, 133 were from children with RTIs. median age was 17 months (range 3 months\u20135 years) and 60% were boys. adenovirus, coronavirus (OC43, 229E, and NL63), enterovirus, parechovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. the PCRs were in-house, real-time as phosphoprotein-1 gene had the following sequence: 5\u2032-FAM-TGTCCACCCAAGAAACGTCGTCTAA-TAMRA-3\u2032. the theoretical PCR product from HBoV1 DNA would be 2,236 bp in length, which is too long for amplification by real-time PCR under normal conditions. RNA stability was studied by using clinical NPA samples and nucleic acid extracts from the easyMag extractor. four clinical NPA samples collected within the previous 2 hours were stored for 0, 1, 3, and 5 days at 4\u00b0C before nucleic acid extraction and testing. two other clinical NPA samples were frozen and thawed 0, 1, 2, and 4 times before extraction and testing with the HBoV1 mRNA PCR. cDNA from fecal samples positive for human bocaviruses 2 and 3 (HBoV2 and HBoV3) were tested. the primers and probe described by Kantola et al. were used for detection of HBoV2 and HBoV3 (10). 133 oV1 DNA\u2013positive NPA samples were collected from children with RTIs. median age was 17 months (range 3 months\u20135 years) and 60% were boys. LRTI was diagnosed in the presence of dyspnea, signs of lower airway obstruction (wheezing, retractions), and/or a chest roentgenogram with positive results. the target for the HBoV1 DNA PCR was the nuclear phosphoprotein-1 gene. a semiquantitative approach was chosen and a cutoff value was used to distinguish between high and low HBoV1 DNA load in NPAs. the total length of the upper product is 242 bp, and the length of the lower is 363 bp. reverse transcription was carried out with universal RiboClone random primers. the PCR was performed for 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 55\u00b0C for 10 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. HBoV1 mRNA PCR results from 3 HBoV1-positive NPA samples stored at 70\u00b0C for 3 years were compared with nucleic acid extracts from the same samples stored under equal conditions for the same period. cDNA from NPA samples positive for the more closely related parvovirus B19 and cDNA from fecal samples positive for human bocaviruses 2 and 3 were tested. on the PCR products was performed by using the BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing method and the ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer. Statistical analysis was by 2 test for categorical variables and Student t test for continuous variables. all analyses were performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) HBoV1 mRNA PCR results in NPAs from children with and without RTIs, Norway, 2007\u20132010*. sample source Total no.

Table 3. Most commonly co-detected viruses from children with HBoV1 DNA. the HBoV1 DNA load was still high, but the results for the HBoV1 mRNA PCR were negative. two months later, his NPAs still were positive for HBoV1 DNA. the other patients were two 1.5-year-old boys (boys 2 and 3), who had been included in an HMPV follow-up study. oV1 DNA loads (range 4 108 copies/mL to >1010 copies/mL) were strongly positive by the HBoV1 mRNA PCR after cDNA synthesis. product sizes were 145, 261, and 457 bp. sequence analysis showed gaps at different positions, all of them lacking splice site characteristics. the assays\u2019 reportable range was from 500 copies/mL (10 copies/reaction) to 1010 copies/mL. results of the -actin PCR performed after DNase treatment were positive for all samples studied. results of the -actin PCR performed after DNase treatment were positive for all other respiratory agents, herpesviruses, and parvoviruses tested. 3 factors (HBoV1 DNAemia, high HBoV1 DNA in NPAs, and monodection of HBoV1 DNA in NPAs) were each associated with RTIs in children (5). the close relationship between HBoV1 DNA load and HBoV1 mRNA detection in NPAs is also illustrated in Figure 3. HBoV1, human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) DNA loads in nasopharyngeal aspirates either positive (n = 33) or negative (n = 128) for HBoV1 mRNA. each dot indicates 1 sample. a 2-year-old boy with cerebral palsy was admitted with bronchiolitis. he had a high HBoV1 DNA load, monodection of HBoV1 DNA, and 3) positive HBoV1 mRNA PCR results. he recovered slowly, and after 10 days a new NPA sample was taken. spliced viral mRNA should be specifically detected within the frame of the familiar and robust RT-PCR. this diagnostic technique has been used to diagnose parvovirus in dogs and may also be an option for diagnosing HBoV1 infections in humans (11). mRNA tests for these viruses have been based on either specific mRNA extraction, nucleic acid sequence\u2013based amplification technology or pretreatment with DNase. the PCR was designed so that the theoretical DNA product would be 2,236 bp\u2014too large for amplification to occur in a regular, real-time PCR. all 3 products had different sizes, ranging from 145 to 457 bp. no common sequence profiles were found near the gap junctions. oV1 transcription and RTI in children supports the hypothesis that HBoV1 may cause RTIs. the hypothesis is further supported by the associations found between HBoV1 mRNA and the 3 factors. LRTI is a prominent manifestation of HBoV1 infection. 2 recent studies have given evidence in support of persistent circular HBoV episomes (24\u201326). the results of PCR on NPA samples from this boy were positive for HBoV mRNA only for a short period (10 days) the findings in boys 2 and 3 who were followed up during the same winter may support this hypothesis."}
