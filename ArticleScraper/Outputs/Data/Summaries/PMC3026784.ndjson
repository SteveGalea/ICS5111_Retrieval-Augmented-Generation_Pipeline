{"summary": "the adult beta globin gene was selected as the model gene for proof of concept of autoimmunity as a biocontrol method for cane toads. the effect of injecting bullfrog tadpoles with adult beta globin resulted in an alteration in the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs. however, we were unable to detect any differences between treated and control animals. the spread of the cane toad, Bufo (Chaunus) marinus, into the Australian environment has been spectacularly successful. predicted warming due to climate change could extend the range of the cane toad south into what are currently temperate regions. bohle Iridovirus (BIV) is a ranavirus in the family Iridoviridae. it is capable of infecting cane toad tadpoles [10] and is therefore a candidate for testing the viral delivery of genes in this species. adult globin is not a cane toad specific gene; we used it here to determine whether autoimmunity might affect the protein profile of metamorphs. if successful, the concept would be extended to cane toad specific genes that were upregulated at metamorphosis. recombinant globin and antisera B. marinus adult and tadpole globins were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pDEST17. cultures were grown overnight (37\u00b0C) in LB supplemented with antibiotics, then diluted 100-fold and grown to an OD of 0.6 (600 nm) the pellet was solubilised in TBS containing 8 M Urea for 30 min. washed via imidazole-containing steps and eluted in TBS+500 mM imidazol. size-based secondary purification was then achieved by continuous-elution electrophoresis. animals were sampled at stages 27, 28, 34, 36, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46. developmental stages of B. marinus were determined according to the method of Limbaugh and Volpe. seven groups of tadpoles were infected at day 6 (stage 20) post hatching. group A, uninfected cell culture supernatant; group B, C and D - 102, 103 and 104 TCID50/mL of the negative control virus, rBIV/neor respectively. each group of 116 tadpoles was infected for approximately 6 h in 2 L of water containing the appropriate concentration of virus, rinse tadpoles were euthanased by bathing for 5 minutes in 0.2% MS-222. euthanased as described then decapitated and blood was collected using a micropipette containing 0.2 M EDTA. cane toad actin amplified 117 bp fragment using sense 5\u2032- ATGACACAGATAATGTTTGAGAGAC -3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032- ATCACCAGAGCCA -3\u2032 primers. PCR target products were used as reaction standards at concentrations ranging from 1102 to 1108 molecules per L. each reaction in the TaqMan assay contained 12.5 L of Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen), 90 nM sense (5\u2032- CTCATCGTTCTGGCCATCAA -3\u2032), 90 nM antisense (5\u2032- TCCCATCGCGCATC-3\u2032), 5 L of a 1/10 dilution of template DNA in dH20. the homogenate was heated to 100\u00b0C for 1 min and stored at 80\u00b0C until used. to extract globin from RBCs, blood was processed as previously described. total protein and viral or native adult globin (200 ng/well) were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. microtitre plates were coated with 50 L/well of rAdglob (10 g/mL) and positive control ovalbumin (4 g/mL; Sigma) they were blocked for 2 h with 5% skim milk powder (Bio-Rad) in TBST at 37\u00b0C. at 11 days post injection (1 week prior to metamorphic climax/stage 46) average burst speed in tadpoles was measured according to the method described by Van Buskirk and McCollum [24] where specific speed is normalised to body length rather than absolute speed. temperatures were constant at 23\u201324\u00b0C. production and purification of recombinant globin and antisera B. marinus adult and tadpole globins were amplified using the following full length primer sets. fragments were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pDEST17 and expressed as His6-tagged proteins in BL21-AI cells. NTA agarose (Qiagen) washed via imidazole-containing steps (TBS+20, 30 or 40 mM imidazol) and eluted in TBS+500 mM imidazol. size-based secondary purification was achieved by continuous-elution electrophoresis. developmental stages of B. marinus were determined according to the method of Limbaugh and Volpe [21]. levels of mRNA and protein were measured individually except for tadpoles at stages 27 and 28. each group of 116 tadpoles was infected for approximately 6 h in 2 L of water containing the appropriate concentration of virus, rinsed in clean water for 5 min then divided into 4 tubs each containing 29 tadpoles. tadpoles were sampled at each of the 5 stages for the detection of virus by real time PCR, and at all stages except stage 20. tadpoles were euthanased by bathing for 5 minutes in 0.2% MS-222. euthanased for real time PCR and for detection of viral adult globin. blood was collected using a micropipette containing 0.2 M EDTA. a 117 bp fragment was amplified using sense 5\u2032- ATGACACAGATAATGTTTGAGAGAC -3\u2032 and antisense 5\u2032- ATCACCAGAGTCCATCACAAT -3\u2032 primers. the tadpole was homogenised in a mini-beadbeater for 30 sec. to extract DNA the sample was heated to 100\u00b0C for 20 min. each reaction in the TaqMan assay contained 12.5 L of Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen), 90 nM sense (5\u2032- CTCATCGTTCTGGCCATCAA -3\u2032) primers, 25 nM MGB TaqMan probe (5\u2032- CACAACATTATCCGCATC-3\u2032), 5 L of a 1/10 dilution of template DNA in dH20, 0.05 L of Rox dye, and water to to extract globin from RBCs, blood was processed as previously described. total protein and viral or native adult globin (200 ng/well) were analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein was transferred to Hybond N (Amersham) and the transferred membrane blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking solution. microtitre plates were coated with 50 L/well of rAdglob (10 g/mL) and positive control ovalbumin (4 g/mL; Sigma) in Ringer's solution overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed (x3) in TBS with Tween-20 (0.05%; TBST) the plates were blocked for 2 h with 5% skim milk powder (Bio-Rad) in TBST at 37\u00b0C. temperature at the time of testing was constant at 23\u201324\u00b0C. jump distances were calculated in stage 46 metamorphs approximately 2 days after removal from aquatic tanks. mRNA data expressed as number of copies of adult or tadpole globin mRNA detected by real time PCR. western blot analysis of total protein extracts showed that larval haemoglobin was expressed in stage 40 tadpoles but not in stage 46 toadlets. rAdglob levels appeared reduced by half every 2\u20133 days, until 14 days post injection where no protein was detected. blot using rabbit antibody to adult globin to detect persistence of rHb emulsion. n = 3 animals pooled per time point. actin indicates loading per protein sample. longest jump distance was normalised to body lengths. metamorphs from each of stages 36, 40, 42 and 46 were pooled. results indicated no significant differences in adult globin mRNA levels between treated and untreated groups at any of these 4 stages. the profile of adult globin mRNA expression across metamorphosis was determined by real time-PCR analysis. each stage point indicates the overall expression level for five pooled () animals, with treated and control animals showing similar copy numbers. the last stage point represents an average of 6 individuals. tadpoles were assessed using real time PCR. animal groups were sampled at stages 20, 28, 33, 42 and 1\u20132 weeks post tail resorption. no virus was detected in any animals indicating there was no background level of BIV detectable by real time PCR. control virus (rBIV/neor) was only detected at stage 28, 6 days post infection (pi) test virus (rBIV/neor/Adglob) was detected at stages 28, 33 and 42 (day 6 pi to approximately day 26\u201330 pi) no effect of infection with rBIV/neor/Adglob on adult globin protein profiles. the time course for the appearance of adult globin mRNA and disappearance of tadpole globin mRNA during normal cane toad metamorphosis were first assessed by real time PCR. mRNA data expressed as number of copies of adult or tadpole globin mRNA detected by real time PCR across various tadpole and metamorphic stages. adult globin protein was first detected in stage 36 tadpoles (faint signal) and continued to increase in abundance after metamorphosis. rAdglob injections detected larval globin but not native adult haemoglobins. Western blot using rabbit antibody to adult globin to detect persistence of rHb emulsion. n = 3 animals pooled per time point. morphology during metamorphosis was similar for treated (rAdglob) and control groups (no injection, or Freund's adjuvant only) burst swim speed represents the absolute swim speed normalised to body length. longest jump distance was normalised to body lengths. metamorphs from each of stages 36, 40, 42 and 46 were pooled and analysed for differences in adult globin mRNA levels between treated and untreated groups. the profile of adult globin mRNA expression across metamorphosis was determined by real time-PCR analysis. each stage point indicates the overall expression level for five pooled () animals, with treated and control animals showing similar copy numbers. the last stage point represents an average of 6 individuals. the effect of recombinant virus infection on mRNA expression levels in tadpoles was assessed using real time PCR. animal groups were sampled at stages 20, 28, 33, 42 and 1\u20132 weeks post tail resorption. the control virus (rBIV/neor) was only detected at stage 28, 6 days post infection (pi) the test virus (rBIV/neor/Adglob) was detected at stages 28, 33 and 42 (day 6 pi to approximately day 26\u201330 pi) no effect of infection with rBIV/neor/Adglob on adult globin protein profiles in metamorphs. 200 ng protein per well from lysed red blood cell samples taken from metamorphs then stained with silver stain. panel shows silver stain and Western blot antibody detection of adult globin from a 2 month old toadlet. in anurans is replaced by adult globin during the course of metamorphosis [18], [26], [27] and here we demonstrate the existence of this switch for the first time in a Bufo species. we have previously demonstrated strong upregulation of adult globin genes during cane toad metamorphosis. we have also previously shown that the recombinant BIV can be genetically modified to express adult globin in vitro. the cane toad has a very short larval stage of approximately 50\u201360+days. the long larval stage in the bullfrog enabled an initial immunisation using FCA. the long larval stage in the bullfrog lasts at least 120 days and up to 2 years. larval Xenopus lacks MHC classical class I expression [33] suggesting the antiviral response in larvae may be compromised. studies of adaptive immune response in Xenopus adults and larvae to frog virus 3 (FV-3), the type virus of the ranavirus genus, indicate this may be so. the globin switch occurs in B. marinus and remains a viable target for other approaches such as RNA interference. it is possible that this approach would be more successful in an amphibian with a longer larval phase."}
