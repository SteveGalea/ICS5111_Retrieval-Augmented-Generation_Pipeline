{"summary": "dsRNA (dsRNA) structure, 21\u201322 bp dsRNA with 3\u2032 overhangs, plays a critical role in initiating both microRNA (miRNA)- and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing. the RISC-loaded small RNAs are generated by a ribonuclease (RNase) III-like enzyme that is found in virtually all eukaryotic organisms. IFN-inducing structure patterns include dsRNA of certain length, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) containing 5\u2032-triphosphates (5\u2032-ppp), the dsRNA analogue polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and certain dsDNA molecules. these RNA patterns are generally believed to possess \u2018non-self\u2019 properties to allow the cell to recognize foreign (often viral) poly I:C response in vivo (13,14). RIG-I can bind and respond to ssRNAs bearing 5\u2032-ppp. MDA5 is not activated by 5\u2032-ppp\u2013containing RNA. synthetic hairpin RNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA) gel electrophoresis and western blotting Protein contents of cell lysate were quantified with the bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) the RIG-I and TLR3 constructs have been described (39,40) the construct encodes Flag-tagged, C-terminal 707 aa of human RIG-I cloned into a bicistronic expression vector modified from pBICEP-CMV-1. the elongation-factor-1 promoter was replaced with the elongation-factor-1 promoter. the titers of the concentrated vectors were then measured with a p24 ELISA kit (ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY, USA) the primers used were OAS1 forward, 5\u2032-AGG TGG TAA AGG GTG GCT CC-3\u2032 and OAS1 reverse 5\u2032-ACA ACC AGG TCA GAT-3\u2032. RNA extraction and northern blots Total RNA from transfected 293FT cells was extracted with RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX, USA) and separated on a 7.5% urea polyacrylamide gel. the transfer of RNA onto nitrocellulose membrane and hybridization were performed according to standard molecular biology protocols. synthetic hairpin RNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA) gel electrophoresis and western blotting Protein contents of cell lysate were quantified with the bio-Rad DC protein assay. samples were run on a polyacrylamide gel under non-denaturing conditions. the RIG-I and TLR3 constructs have been described (39,40) the RIG-I C construct encodes Flag-tagged, C-terminal 707 aa of human RIG-I cloned into a bicistronic expression vector modified from pBICEP-CMV-1. the CMV promoter was replaced with the elongation-factor-1 promoter. Lentiviral vectors were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 50 000g at 4\u00b0C for 3 h and resuspended in a volume of PBS that was 1% of the original medium volume. the titers of concentrated vectors were then measured with a p24 ELISA kit. RNA extraction and northern blots Total RNA from transfected 293FT cells was normalized to 100%. the transfer of RNA onto nitrocellulose membrane and hybridization were performed according to standard molecular biology protocols. the probe was a synthetic DNA oligomer corresponding to the bottom strand of sh-B971. the fast kinetics of viral inhibition was also more consistent with IFN than with RNAi-based inhibition. the presence of IFN in the lentiviral vector preparation of sh-B971 was confirmed by strong induction of 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), a classic IFN-induced gene, in both nave Huh-7 and the HCV replicon cell line (GS5) treated with the medium. sh-B971 was expressed from a self-inactivating human immunodeficiency virus vector with a murine U6 promoter (59). GS5 cells were treated with culture supernatant from 293FT cells transfected with sh-B971 for 24 h before RNA extraction and real-time RT\u2013PCR analysis. sh-C454 (an shRNA directed at CyPC) or sh-B971 was cotransfected along with luciferase reporter plasmids with or without IRF-7. the ratios of firefly luciferase readings to Renilla luciferase readings were plotted. the combination of sh-B971 and RIG-I produced the highest level of IFN- promoter activity. western blotting showed that endogenous ISG15 induction was only detectable in cells cotransfected with sh-B971 and wild-type RIG-I. sh-B971 acts through the RIG-I pathway to trigger IFN activation. a dominant negative mutant of RIG-I blocked sh-B971-triggered IFN production. RNA was extracted 24 h after transfection. we tested a synthetic siRNA duplex with the same target sequence as sh-B971. this siRNA (si-B971-syn) should resemble the final Dicer product of sh-B971 except for the 5\u2032-ends. the synthetic siRNA (si-B971-syn) contains 5\u2032-OH groups. 293FT cells were transfected with shRNA-expressing lentiviral plasmids or synthetic RNAs. lack of HCV inhibition by synthetic forms of sh-B971. two point mutations located farther into the stem structure of the shRNA also reduced its ability to induce IFN. replacing the 9-nt hairpin loop with a 7-nt loop eliminated sh-B971\u2019s ability to induce IFN, suggesting the importance of RNA processing in the induction. RNA was extracted from transfected 293FT cells and analyzed by northern blotting. a previously reported IFN-inducing shRNA, sh-PCAF, contains a blunt end (38) and was more potent in activating IFN than sh-B971. I pathway was coexpressed with either sh-B971 or sh-PCAF. proper expression of NS3-4A protease was confirmed by western blotting. the H1-driven sh-B971 activated IFN- promoter (Figure 6A) and resulted in secretion of IFN into the transfected cell-culture media, which in turn suppressed HCV replication. the expression cassette by itself, removed and isolated from the lentiviral plasmid, could also activate IFN production in transfected 293FT cells. lentiviral transduction system has been suggested to express shRNAs that can escape detection by PRRs and IFN activation (48). both sh-B971 and sh-PCAF vectors induced IFN production when delivered as concentrated lentiviral particles, measured both by HCV suppression and by OAS induction. we transduced a human hepatoma cell line, LH86, which has been reported to produce IFN upon viral infection. culture medium from LH86 cells transduced with sh-PCAF contained biologically active IFN. the ability of shRNAs delivered by lentivirus to induce IFN response was not limited to 293FT cells. culture medium from 293FT cells transduced with sh-PCAF suppressed HCV replication. this experiment was done as depicted in (A) with the LH86 cells in the place of 293FT cells in the transduction step. a short-hairpin RNA directed at CyPB induces IFN production in human embryonic kidney cells. sh-B971 was able to activate both IFN- and IFN- promoters. expression of sh-B971 in 293FT cells also induced dimerization of IRF-3. this confirms the activation of the IFN- promoter in these transfected cells. hoh 7 and GS5 cells were treated with culture supernatant from 293FT cells transfected with either sh-Luc or sh-B971 for 24 h. RNA extraction and real-time RT\u2013PCR analysis failed to suppress HCV replication in an IFN-resistant cell line. sh-B971 increased activation of the IFN- promoter by 2.6-fold. ectopic expression of a DN mutant of RIG-I (RIG-I C), but not MDA5-C, completely abrogated IFN promoter activation by sh-B971. NS5A-GFP expression is used for monitoring viral RNA replication. a culture medium from sh-B971 efficiently suppressed HCV replication. the effect of the cytokine can be readily measured as the change in the mean GFP intensity of the treated cells. shRNAs were cotransfected with either RIG-I or a dominant negative form of RIG-I (RIG-I C) into 293FT cells. the culture supernatant was then tested for its ability to suppress NS5A-GFP expression in GS5 cells with an overnight treatment. n knocked down CyPB expression as efficiently as sh-B971. the sequence of the intact hairpin RNA before Dicer cleavage failed to activate IFN production. we tested a synthetic shRNA (sh-B971-syn) that had exactly the same sequence as the predicted intracellular sh-B971 transcript. sh-B971+1 was shifted 1 nt downstream on the CyPB mRNA. the target of sh-B971+1 was shifted 1 nt downstream on the CyPB mRNA. replacing the first nucleotide with an A did not generate an IFN-inducing shRNA (NTC-A and NTC+1) the mutants A1/G and Loop A were chosen because their final siRNA products have exactly the same sequence as that of the wild-type sh-B971. the final siRNA product of sh-Loop A was slightly smaller than those of sh-B971 and sh-A1/G, suggesting that cleavage did occur. p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor was more potent in activating IFN than sh-B971 (Figure 5A), predicted to form an overhang of 2\u20133 Ts at each end of the final siRNA. this modification (Blunt sh-B971) did not increase the ability of sh-B971 to activate IFN- promoter. sh-B971 expressed from an H1 promoter triggers IFN induction. the mU6-driven sh-B971 and the H1-driven sh-B971 activated IFN- promoter. the expression cassette by itself, removed and isolated from the lentiviral vector carrying the mU6 promoter. d by restriction digestion, could also activate IFN production in transfected 293FT cells. Sh-B971 expressed from an H1 promoter was capable of (A) activating IFN- promoter and (B) triggering IFN production to inhibit HCV replication in GS5 cells. we tested the effect of an inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase, Nevirapine, on IFN induction by sh-B971 and sh-PCAF. to determine whether lentiviral vector-delivered shRNA can trigger IFN induction in cells other than 293FT cells. lentiviral vectors were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. transduction of 293FT cells with concentrated shRNA vectors triggered IFN production. culture supernatant was collected 48 h after transduction and was used to treat GS5 cells overnight. GS5 cells were then analyzed 48 h after treatment by flow cytometry. the present study identifies RIG-I, but not MDA5 or TLR3, as the mediator for activation of IFN responses by two shRNAs that are distinct in sequence and structure but both capable of IFN induction. this was demonstrated by induction of IRF-3 dimerization, activation of IFN promoters, induction of endogenous ISGs (ISG15, OAS and RIG-I) and secretion of IFN. the loop A mutant contains a predicted loop of 7 nt. it generated a siRNA duplex inside the cells that is slightly smaller than that of the shRNAs with a wild-type hairpin loop. this mutant form of sh-B971 was not able to trigger IFN activation. sequence as sh-B971 but lacks the 5\u2032-ppp failed to induce IFN. this suggests the 5\u2032-end status of the intracellularly expressed sh-B971 contributes to IFN activation. this suggests the 5\u2032-end status of the intracellularly expressed sh-B971 contributes to IFN activation. if expressed at higher level from this construct, it could effectively activate IFN. the distinction is important as lentiviral vectors used in gene-therapy will likely be purified and free of any IFN that has been generated during the vector preparation step. an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor efficiently blocked IFN production by both sh-B971 and sh-PCAF when delivered by transduction.
