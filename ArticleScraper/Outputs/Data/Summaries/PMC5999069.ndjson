{"summary": "angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an endogenous regulator of the renin angiotensin system. increased circulating ACE2 predicts adverse outcomes in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. it is unknown if elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicts major adverse cardiovascular events. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I to the vasoconstrictor and pro-atherosclerotic peptide Ang II. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and blood vessels[4] and is cleaved from the cell surface to release the catalytically active ectodomain[5] into the circulation through the action of tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) obstructive CAD was defined as 50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or 70% stenosis in 1 other major epicardial coronary artery. hypertension was defined if previously diagnosed by a physician and/or current use of anti-hypertensive medication. plasma ACE2 activity was measured within 2 years after all samples were collected. plasma was diluted into low-ionic-strength buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) and added to 200 l ANXSepharose 4 Fast-Flow resin. CV death was defined as death due to sudden cardiac death, HF, acute MI, cerebrovascular accident, CV haemorrhage, CV procedures or other CV causes. hospitalisation for HF was defined as an event where the patient is admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of HF where the length of stay is at least 24 hours. Cumulative incidence of MACE was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. log-rank test used to evaluate differences between patients with below and above median plasma ACE2 activity. patients ACE2 median (n = 39) ACE2 > median (n = 40) P-value Age (years) 66 12 67 11 63 13 0.27 Male gender [n (%)] 51 (65%) 18(46%) 33 (83%) 0.001 BMI (kg/m2) 27.4 4.4 27.4 5.2 27.3 3.6 0.939 SBP (mmHg) 130 17 131 15 130 19 0.746 DBP (mmHg) 70 13 71 69 [46\u201395] 0.675 Troponin I (g/L) 0.54 [0\u201321.2] 0.211 LVEF 50% [n (%)] 42 (58%) 18(53%) 24 (62%) 0.459 Culprit vessel [n (%)] Right coronary 27 (34) 15 (39) 12 (30) 0.428 Left anterior descending 23 (23) 13 (33) 10 (25) 0.415 Left circumflex 20 (25) 8 (21) 12 (30) 0.332 Left main 1 (1) median ACE2 level in whole cohort was 29.3 pmol/ml/min. male gender was the only independent predictor of higher ACE2 activity. prevalence of CAD and cardiac risk factors including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes and cigarette smoking were similar in the two groups. log ACE2 activity remained the only significant predictor of the primary endpoint of MACE. age, history of atrial fibrillation, history of diabetes and log ACE2 were univariate predictors of the primary endpoint of MACE. plasma ACE2 activity independently increased the hazard for adverse cardiovascular events in patients with significant obstructive CAD. in high-risk patients followed for a median of 10.6 years, elevated ACE2 activity remained an independent predictor of CV mortality and morbidity. elevated ACE2 levels did not predict CV events after 12 months of follow-up. in elderly patients undergoing emergency orthopaedic surgery, elevated ACE2 levels did not predict CV events after 12 months of follow-up. ACE2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic plaques. ACE2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic plaques. genetic variation in and around the gene encoding ACE2 may account for differences in ACE2 expression or activity. rs1978124 polymorphism in the ACE2 gene has been associated with poorer outcomes in two separate CAD cohorts of Chinese Han[32] and European[33] ancestry. edward et al."}
