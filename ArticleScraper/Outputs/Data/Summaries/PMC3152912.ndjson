{"summary": "trophoblasts produce numerous immunomodulators that play a role in placental development and pregnancy maintenance. we hypothesize that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation. trophoblasts express anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increases from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. the detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare. trophoblastic cells were efficiently infected with cell associated virus [13], but not cell free virus [14] due to differences in entry pathways into the cell. in the latter case, virus production was marginally increased by treatment with TNF- and IL-1. 10 cats were inoculated intravenously with 1 ml of a feline plasma pool containing approximately 1.3 104 copies/ml of FIV-B-2542. infection was confirmed within 6 weeks p.i. by detection of FIV provirus by PCR and for seroconversion using the petChek\u00ae FIV Antibody Test Kit.

IL-4 mediates the process of trophoblast invasion during human placentation. IL-4 activates matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP-3), a protease that digests extracellular matrix proteins. this interaction protects trophoblasts from apoptosis via stimulation of anti-apoptotic pathways. cultured placental trophoblasts from HIV-infected women expressed significantly higher amounts of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- than placentas from uninfected women. this indicates that HIV-infection during pregnancy results in increased cytokine expression and that a pro-inflammatory microenvironment exists in HIV-infected placentas. our laboratory is investigating feline Tregs and Th17 cells in lentivirus-induced placental immunopathology and pregnancy failure. a limitation of this study was the small number of tissues evaluated by LCM, particularly in terms of separating viable versus non-viable tissues. the inclusion of additional placental specimens may have strengthened the statistical power. trophoblasts expressed anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increased from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. project was supported by the national institutes of health (2R15AI048419-02A1) and (3R15AI048419-02A1S1)."}
