{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and that is caused by enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. in the u.s., COPD affects approximately 24 million Americans, results in about 120,000 deaths a year and is now the third leading cause of death. in 50% of community-treated exacerbations, patients recovered to baseline symptoms within 7 days. recurrent exacerbations are associated with accelerated decline in lung function that is the hallmark of COPD. frequent exacerbations are associated with reduced physical activity. 22% of patients with stage II disease, 33% with stage III and 47% with stage IV had frequent exacerbations in the first year of follow up. the single best predictor of exacerbations, across all GOLD stages, was a past history of exacerbations. PD Poor health-related quality of life Productive cough and wheezing Prior history of exacerbations Antibiotic or systemic steroid use Etiology of COPD exacerbations. the remaining 20-30% are associated with exposure to environmental pollution or have an unknown etiology. za virus 5\u201310% Respiratory syncytial virus 5\u201310% Coronavirus 3\u20135% Human metapneumovirus 3\u20135% Atypical bacteria Chlamydophilia pneumoniae 3\u20135% Mycoplasma pneumoniae 1\u20132% Fungi Pneumocystis jeroveci Undefined Limited studies suggest deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are associated with acute exacerbations. bronchodilators short-acting inhaled 2 agonists (SABAs) and anticholinergic agents remain the mainstay in the treatment of symptoms and airflow obstruction during exacerbations. ipratropium bromide begins to take effect after 10\u201315 min, with a peak at 30\u201360 min. combination of short-acting bronchodilators given sequentially in exacerbations has been shown to be more efficacious than either agent given alone. nebulizer delivery of short-acting bronchodilators is used in very ill patients as the patients may not be able to use the MDI properly. antibiotics reduced the risk of short-term mortality by 77%, treatment failure by 53% and sputum purulence by 44%. sputum culture provides semiquantitative information on the number of bacteria in the sputum. the choice of antibiotics is influenced by the severity of exacerbation, prior use of antibiotics and systemic steroids. antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas species should be considered. a short course of antibiotic treatment (5 days) is as effective as the traditional longer treatment in patients with mild to moderate exacerbations of CB and COPD. however, none of the studies have led to conclusive evidence to incorporate them in the guidelines for COPD exacerbation management. a 10-day course of 40 mg of oral prednisone versus placebo reduced the overall relapse rate at 30 days (27% versus 43% with number needed to treat of 6), improved post-bronchodilator FEV1 (34% versus 15% and 300 ml versus 160 ml) the insomnia group reported more insomnia, increased appetite and weight gain. a recent randomized controlled trial in inpatients compared nebulized budesonide 0.5 mg/ml (2 mg four times daily for 3 days followed by 2 mg per day for 7 days) the ICS group showed the same improvement in FEV1 compared with the oral prednisolone group. the duration of hospitalization was similar, with the oral steroids group having more hyperglycemic events. primary objective is to treat hypoxemia without increasing ventilation/perfusion mismatch. inpatient oxygen therapy is to maintain a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 60 mmHg or oxygen saturation of 90%. increasing PaO2 to values much greater than 60 mmHg confers little added benefit. nonpharmacological interventions Chest percussion therapy was thought to increase sputum clearance and improve respiratory symptoms of patients admitted with COPD exacerbation. a major advance in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD has been the implementation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) invasive mechanical ventilation in the management of COPD exacerbation should be implemented. in patients with COPD in whom extubation fails, NIV facilitates weaning. early NIV after extubation reduces the risk of respiratory failure. inhaled bronchodilators Short-acting inhaled 2 agonists (SABAs) and anticholinergic agents (short-acting muscarinic antagonists, SAMAs) remain the mainstay in the treatment of symptoms and airflow obstruction during exacerbations. there is no difference between classes of short-acting bronchodilators at 90 min. systematic review of the route of delivery of short-acting bronchodilators showed no significant differences in FEV1 improvement between the use of handheld metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a good inhaler technique (with or without a spacer device) and nebulizers. the use of long-acting bronchodilators in COPD has been restricted for maintenance treatment of stable disease. treatment is usually empirical and not based on sputum cultures. culture provides information only on the identity of the organisms. choice of antibiotics is influenced by severity of exacerbation, prior use of antibiotics and systemic steroids, and presence of underlying structural lung disease. some data exist regarding the use of inhaled tobramycin in patients with severe COPD (GOLD 3\u20134) who have colonization of their respiratory tracts with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas. but the study only showed reduction in sputum inflammatory markers and reduction in colony counts of the bacteria with no change in other outcomes. the insomnia group reported more insomnia, increased appetite and weight gain and increased trend towards higher incidence of depression and anxiety. the steroid groups had a significantly lower treatment failure rate compared with the placebo group on days 30 and 90. randomized trial compared inhaled budesonide/formoterol with prednisolone plus formoterol. similar improvement in FEV1 and no differences in symptoms, quality of life, treatment failures, and the need for reliever medication. methylxanthines are considered second-line therapy, only to be used in selected cases when there is insufficient response to short-acting bronchodilators. side effects of methylxanthines are significant and their beneficial effects in terms of lung function and clinical endpoints are modest and inconsistent. ipratropium bromide and albuterol act by increasing concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. bronchodilators decline after 2\u20133 h but can last as long as 4\u20136 h. there is no difference between classes of short-acting bronchodilators in terms of improvement in lung function. the use of long-acting bronchodilators in COPD has been restricted for maintenance treatment of stable disease. formoterol, a rapid-acting long-acting inhaled 2 agonist (LABA), has also been proposed for use in a cumulative manner for the management of exacerbations. the choice of antibiotics for acute exacerbation has recently been challenged by the rise in prevalence of resistant organisms. broader-spectrum antibiotics such as new fluoroquinolones that will be effective against resistant strains of H. influenzae and S. pneumonia are recommended. corticosteroids reduce recovery time and treatment failures. a 10-day course of 40 mg of oral prednisone versus placebo reduced the overall relapse rate at 30 days. insomnia group reported more insomnia, increased appetite and weight gain. patients received either 125 mg intravenous methylprednisolone four times daily for 3 days followed by 2 or 8 weeks of a tapering dose of oral prednisone. the steroid groups had a significantly lower treatment failure rate compared with the placebo group on days 30 (33% versus 23%) and day 90 (48% versus 37%) but not at 6 months. no clinical, biochemical or functional markers can clearly identify patients who will respond better to corticosteroid treatment. an increased number of eosinophils have been found in patients with mild to moderate COPD exacerbations. side effects of methylxanthines are significant and their beneficial effects in terms of lung function are modest and inconsistent. the use of mucolytics and antioxidant agents was investigated in numerous studies with controversial results. however, the widespread use of these agents is not recommended at the present time. a major advance in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD has been the implementation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) NIV has been shown to improve acute respiratory acidosis (increases pH and decreases partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide), decrease respiratory rate, work of breathing, complications such as ventilator associated pneumonia and length of stay. early NIV after extubation reduces the risk of respiratory failure. mortality for severe COPD exacerbations is substantially reduced. a recent randomized trial tested the benefit of a helium\u2013oxygen mixture for use in noninvasive ventilatory support in COPD exacerbations did not show superiority. invasive mechanical ventilation in the management of COPD exacerbation should be implemented. in patients with COPD in whom extubation fails, NIV facilitates weaning, prevents reintubation and reduces mortality. current guidelines stipulate that prevention of exacerbation is a major goal in management. many modalities, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological, have been proposed to prevent exacerbations. smoking cessation is associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations. smoking cessation slows the accelerated rate of lung function decline and improves survival compared with continued smoking. if effective resources and time are dedicated to smoking cessation, 25% long-term quit rates can be achieved. larger well designed studies are needed to examine the effects of pneumococcal vaccine in patients older than 65 years with COPD. immunostimulant OM-85, a detoxified oral immunoactive bacterial extract, reported a reduction in severe complications of exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with COPD. studies conducted in a COPD population showed that establishing a simple disease management program and improving patient education about COPD exacerbation symptoms does reduce hospitalizations and emergency department visits. controversy was thrown on the above findings by a recent randomized trial which suggested that implementation of a home educational and management program for patients with COPD did not result in a reduction in admissions for acute exacerbations of COPD. tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the mean number of exacerbations of 14% (p 0.001) during the 4-year period. tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the mean number of exacerbations of 14%. salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol significantly reduced COPD exacerbations compared with placebo. salmeterol significantly reduced COPD exacerbations with both study arms exposed or not exposed to ICS. inhaled corticosteroids ICS have consistently resulted in 25% reduction in exacerbation frequency. current guidelines do not recommend the use of ICS as standalone agents in the maintenance therapy of COPD. both doses of budesonide/formoterol 320/9 and 160/9 reduced exacerbation rates by 34.6% and 25.9% respectively versus formoterol. combination therapy improves various COPD-related outcomes, including lung function and health-related quality of life. roflumilast has been shown to reduce the overall rate of moderate/severe exacerbation rates over 1 year of treatment in subjects with severe COPD, CB and a history of previous exacerbation. the 1-year cumulative number of exacerbations was 325 in the carbocisteine group and 439 in the placebo group (p = 0.004) antibiotics An alternative approach to preventing infectious exacerbations of COPD is the use of antibiotics in a prophylactic manner. macrolides (including erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin) are especially attractive as prophylactic antibiotics. several studies are ongoing to examine the effects of inhaled antibiotics in the prevention of COPD exacerbations. a subgroup of patients with very low vitamin D levels did show some reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. smoking cessation is the intervention with the greatest capacity to influence the natural history of COPD. a study conducted among 23,497 veterans in the u.s. showed that smoking cessation is associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations and the magnitude of the reduced risk was dependent on duration of abstinence [Au et al. 1994]. the vaccine was effective in the prevention of community-acquired pneumonia compared with placebo in patients younger than 65 years or those with severe airflow obstruction. a systematic review of 13 trials involving 2066 patients reported no consistent evidence of a benefit, though the agent is currently in use in Europe. the most convincing evidence comes from the prospective randomized control trial conducted some years ago in south Wales. patients who received pulmonary rehabilitation had on average 10.4 days in hospital compared with 21.0 days in those randomized to receive conventional medical treatment. study showed that respiratory rehabilitation reduced the risk of hospital admissions (pooled relative risk = 0.26) and mortality (pooled relative risk = 0.45) smoking cessation slows the accelerated rate of lung function decline and improves survival compared with continued smoking. a high-intensity smoking cessation program was associated with a lower average number of exacerbations and hospital days per patient. a higher number of quitters (20 versus 9) at lower total costs. a study of the immunostimulant OM-85 reported a reduction in the severe complications of exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with COPD. a systematic review of 13 trials involving 2066 patients reported no consistent evidence of a benefit, though the agent is currently in use in Europe. studies conducted in a COPD population showed that establishing a simple disease management program does reduce hospitalizations and emergency department visits. however, controversy was thrown on the above findings by a recent randomized trial which suggested that implementation of a home educational and management program for patients with COPD did not result in a reduction in admissions for acute exacerbations of COPD. the use of the long-acting anticholinergic, tiotropium, has demonstrated a significant effect on reduction in COPD exacerbations. the trial included 5993 patients, 2987 in the tiotropium group and 3006 in the placebo group. the trial demonstrated superiority of tiotropium to salmeterol twice daily. a recent meta-analysis reviewed 17 randomized trials to assess the effect of LABA on COPD exacerbations. Salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol significantly reduced COPD exacerbations compared with placebo. the median exacerbation rate was reduced by 25% from 1.32 a year on placebo to 0.99 a year with fluticasone propionate (p = 0.026) current guidelines do not recommend the use of ICS as standalone agents in the maintenance therapy of COPD as their effect is significantly improved when combined with a LABA. a review of four clinical trials assessing combination therapy with budesonide and formoterol indicates that in patients with moderate or severe COPD who have a history of a COPD exacerbation, combination therapy improves various COPD-related outcomes. theophylline remains the most widely used nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor but the situation is scarcely better for the more specific phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors. antioxidants and mucolytic agents Carbocisteine were studied in the PEACE trial. the 1-year cumulative number of exacerbations was 325 in the carbocisteine group. antibiotic classes, macrolides are especially attractive as prophylactic antibiotics in COPD. erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin have also been shown to have potentially beneficial immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. studies are ongoing to examine the effects of inhaled antibiotics in the prevention of COPD exacerbations. a subgroup of patients with very low vitamin D levels did show some reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. UPLIFT trial included 5993 patients, 2987 in the tiotropium group and 3006 in the placebo group. tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the mean number of exacerbations of 14% (p 0.001) during the 4-year period. compared with twice-daily LABAs, new LABAs with ultra-long duration (ultra LABAs) could provide improvements in efficacy and compliance with fast onset of action, 24 h bronchodilation and a good safety profile. all active treatments were significantly superior to placebo in decreasing the risk of moderate to severe exacerbations, and exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (all p 0.05) combined treatment and salmeterol were significantly superior to placebo in decreasing the risk for exacerbations requiring hospitalization. the addition of fluticasone furoate to vilanterol was associated with a decreased rate of moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD. theophylline remains the most widely used nonspecific phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor but data about its effects on exacerbations are lacking. the 1-year cumulative number of exacerbations was 325 in the carbocisteine group and 439 in the placebo group (p = 0.004) a prospective randomized control trial (BRONCHUS) conducted over 3 years in 523 patients. a subgroup analysis suggested that patients who were not receiving concomitant ICS had fewer exacerbations if they were randomized to NAC (0.76 versus 1.11 moderate or severe exacerbations per year) the median time to the first exacerbation was 266 days in the azithromycin group versus 174 days in the placebo group. the authors also noted an exacerbation frequency of 1.48 exacerbations per patient year in the group receiving azithromycin versus 1.83 exacerbations per patient year in the placebo group. a subgroup of patients with very low vitamin D levels showed some reduction in COPD exacerbation rates. further studies are needed to establish guideline for vitamin supplementation to reduce exacerbation rates. statins/ blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD. designed and adequately powered randomized trials."}
