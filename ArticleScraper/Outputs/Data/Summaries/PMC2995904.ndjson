{"summary": "phylodynamic modeling may lead to improvements in the accuracy and quality of the surveillance of infectious diseases. the number of norovirus outbreaks reported increased in 2002. the number of outbreaks reported increased in 2002. researchers have rarely quantitatively considered how contact heterogeneity might be directly influencing the results of their coalescent analyses. we build contact networks with different levels of heterogeneity. then, we simulate the spread of parasites through the networks, generating epidemic dynamics and a genealogy of the parasite with each simulation. the nodes of the networks represented hosts and had states of being susceptible, infectious, or recovered. the edges of the network determined the set of possible transmission events; infectious hosts transmitted infection across edges shared with susceptible hosts. the number of nodes in the network was kept at 10,000, and the mean degree (degree is the number of edges coming out of a node) was kept at 4. the code made use of the GNU scientific library [20, version 1.13+dsfg-1] to generate random numbers and the igraph library [21, version 0.5.3-6] to construct networks. the output of a simulation included a time series of prevalence, that is, the count of infected nodes (given a fixed population of 10,000 nodes) theory is an area of population genetics that models the structure of genealogies backward in time from a set of lineages sampled from a large population. a simple coalescent process turns out to be a good model for the genealogies of a wide range of scenarios in population genetics. the rate of coalescence of a single pair of cases is r i P, (2) where P is the probability that we can trace a particular pair of cases back to a single case before the last transmission event. the predicted skyride y pred satisfies y pred = 1 r i P = ( I 2 ) / r i. small amounts of pruning reduced the number of coalescent events in the sampled genealogy that occurred in the peak and late phases of the epidemic. the light-blue ribbons are the middle 95% of the posterior density of the skyride reconstruction. axis represent the times of coalescent events in the sampled genealogy. panel labels on the top indicate the approximate degree distribution of the contact networks. the variance of the degree distributions increases from (a) to (d) theory is an area of population genetics that models the structure of genealogies backward in time from a set of lineages sampled from a large population. in the coalescent process, each pair of lineages in the sample coalesces into a common ancestral lineage at a constant rate. when time is measured in units of generations, this rate is the reciprocal of the effective population size. the predicted skyride y pred satisfies y pred = 1 r i P = ( I 2 ) / r i. the similarity of (4) and (1) reflects the similarity of the coalescent process to the transmission process in a continuous-time epidemic model. light-blue ribbons are the middle 95% of the posterior density of the skyride reconstruction. labels above the Panels indicate the number of tips in the sampled genealogy. the ratio of prevalence to incidence is the expected time until an infected host transmits infection. the decline in the number of susceptible hosts over the course of the epidemic causes this increase to happen. in the other networks, infection first moves to the high-degree hosts and then to progressively lower- and lower-degree hosts. we know the true infection tree in our simulations. in typical coalescent analyses of an infectious disease, we do not know the true genealogy. phylogenetics practitioners say substitution rates set fundamental limits on the amount of phylogenetic information sequences may contain. contact tracing is not a routine in general medical care of STDs. it has been used to help contain the SARS-coronavirus outbreak [47], smallpox [48], and tuberculosis [49]. a recent survey of physicians in the united states found that less than one-third of physicians routinely screen patients for STDs. sequence data from diverse within-host populations could be useful in parameter estimation for coalescent models (e.g., [51] that include the within-host dynamics of the parasite. two properties that parasites may have that would help increase the chance that infection trees and genealogies match are a low level of diversity in transmitting inocula. contact heterogeneity is well known to have a strong effect on infectious disease dynamics. the relationship between infectious disease dynamics and genealogies is similarly sensitive to the contact heterogeneity specified by a network."}
