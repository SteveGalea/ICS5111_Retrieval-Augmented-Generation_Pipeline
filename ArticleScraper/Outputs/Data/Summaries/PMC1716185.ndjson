{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. zoonotic virus crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents. a vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations. short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice. only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. vaccines failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge. researchers examined vaccine candidates based on this particular protein (termed SARS-CoV S), as well as a second one called SARS-CoV N, in mice. they tested whether the vaccines would protect against SARS infection in both young and older mice. the next step was to work out whether mice injected with the vaccines would be protected against later infection with a standard strain of the virus. the differences seen between young and older mice suggest that older mice might provide a useful model for animal testing of candidate vaccines for diseases like SARS, flu, and west Nile virus that pose a particular threat to elderly people. the differences seen between young and older mice suggest that older mice might provide a useful model for animal testing. new zoonotic variants may emerge as evidenced by sporadic cases of human disease in late 2003 and early 2004. in 2004, several laboratory-acquired infections were reported, including secondary spread resulting in fatal disease. the development of an effective vaccine strategy that is protective against both epidemic and zoonotic strains is highly desirable. equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines expressing the Urbani SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (VRP-S) and N protein (VRP-N), either individually or in combination, are determined in young and senescent mouse models. we evaluated the duration of protective immunity following homologous and heterologous challenge virus challenge. cultures of veroE6 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 h. monolayer washed twice with 2 ml of PBS and overlaid with complete MEM. s were propagated on veroE6 cells in Eagle's MEM. synthetic DNA containing the 5\u2032-most GD03 mutations was purchased. plasmid clone (SARS-E GD03) was fully sequenced and shown to contain all of the appropriate mutations. individual cDNA fragments were gel purified (Qiagen) and ligated (Roche [http://www.roche.com]) to form a full-length genomic cDNA and then chloroform extracted and EtOH precipitated. N and full-length viral genomic cDNA were then electroporated into vero cells. mouse antisera was directed against the Urbani-S glycoprotein diluted 1:200 or convalescent human sera 1128 diluted 1:400. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 50 l of virus at a concentration of 2 106 pfu. half of the left lung was placed into Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. the second half of the left lung was fixed in 4% PFA in PBS (pH 7.4) for at least 7 d prior to paraffin imbedding and sectioning for histopathological analysis. all mice were housed under sterile conditions and sentinel mice were used to verify that the colony was mouse hepatitis virus negative. PCR reactions were performed with Expand Long Taq (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extensions at 68 \u00b0C for 1 min. the first amplicon, which was used in the construction of both VRP-S and VRP-N, was generated with primers 5\u2032nsp4Sw (5\u2032-GATTGAGGCGTTTCGGCG) and 3\u203226S (5\u2032- a quarter of the total lungs were sectioned, with four to six sections mounted from cuts taken at five different depths within the paraffin-imbedded tissue. the same sets of tissues were also evaluated qualitatively by a respiratory pathologist. mouse sera was diluted 1:100 in casein blocking buffer containing 32 mM sodium carbonate, 68 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.6) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. a 2-fold serial dilutions were performed, followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. the Fisher exact tests were completed by comparing the number of animals positive for viral replication within the lungs of a group of animals vaccinated with VRP-S or VRP-S+N to that of the negative control group, VRP-HA or PBS. an amino acid multiple alignment was generated for the entire S gene of viral sequences representing early, middle, and late phases of the SARS epidemic in humans. cultures of veroE6 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 h. monolayer washed twice with 2 ml of PBS and overlaid with complete MEM. recombinant chimeric virus encoding the S gene of GDO3 SARS-CoV. the plasmid clone (SARS-E GD03) was fully sequenced and shown to contain all of the appropriate mutations. the final construct (SARS-F GD03) was fully sequenced and found to contain the appropriate set of GD03-S glycoprotein alleles. infectious clone fragments A and F were digested with BglI. individual cDNA fragments were gel purified (Qiagen) and ligated (Roche) to form a full-length genomic cDNA and then chloroform extracted and EtOH precipitated. N and full-length viral genomic cDNA were then electroporated into vero cells. patients were infected during the second disease outbreak in Toronto, canada. dilution at which 80% of plaques were neutralized was determined for each VRP-S\u2013 or PBS-vaccinated animal. each mouse was intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with 50 l of virus at a concentration of 2 106 pfu/ml of virus. half of the left lung was placed into Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. the fused DNA was digested with ApaI and AscI. the fused DNA was ligated into the similarly digested pVR21 plasmid. a quarter of the total lungs were sectioned, with four to six sections mounted from cuts taken at five different depths within the paraffin-imbedded tissue. the same sets of tissues were also evaluated qualitatively by a respiratory pathologist. 96-well round-bottom plates coated with 10 g/ml of SARS-S, SARS-N, or inactivated influenza A diluted in carbonate buffer containing 32 mM sodium carbonate, 68 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.6) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. plates were added to wells in duplicate, and 2-fold serial dilutions were performed. an amino acid multiple alignment was generated for the entire S gene of viral sequences representing early, middle, and late phases of the SARS epidemic in humans. an amino acid multiple alignment was generated for the entire S gene of viral sequences representing early, middle, and late phases of the SARS epidemic in humans. an amino acid substitution model was set to JTT [39] using the lset command. VRP-S and VRP-N constructs were packaged to give titers greater than 109 IU per ml. Western blot analysis of VRP-S\u2013infected lysates revealed the expected S glycoprotein doublet of approximately 180\u2013210 kDa. VRP-N\u2013infected lysates were probed with antiserum 1128. serum from mice vaccinated with VRP-S only identified SARS-S. serum from mice vaccinated with VRP-N recognized SARS-N. serum from mice vaccinated with VRP-N also recognized SARS-N. no virus was detected by plaque assay (250 pfu/g limit of detection) in the lungs of VRP-S\u2013vaccinated animals at 2 d post-infection. the VRP-HA\u2013vaccinated mouse lung had a mean titer of 6.7 log10 pfu/g. i.n. challenged with 105 pfu of icSARS-CoV and lungs removed 4 d post-infection. lungs were harvested 4 d later and titered. senescent mice challenged with the icSARS-CoV. S or the combination of VRP-S+N were below the limit of detection (250 pfu/g) the lung titers of VRP-HA\u2013vaccinated animals were 5.8 0.6 log10 pfu/g, comparable to the VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animal titers of 5.3 0.6 log10 pfu/g (p = 0.2) these plaque assay results were confirmed by SARS-CoV\u2013specific in situ hybridization on lung tissues two branches include viruses isolated from animals, such as the palm civet and raccoon dog, and low pathogenic viruses sporadically isolated from humans. we resurrected the S glycoprotein of GDO3, a virus reported from a sporadic SARS case on December 22, 2003. the GDO3-S glycoprotein contains 17 amino acid changes relative to Urbani-S, many of which map within neutralizing epitopes. wild-type icSARS-CoV recombinant viruses replicated in vero cells to comparable titers that approached 107 PFU/ml within 24 h. their proteins were both detected in Western blots with human antiserum from convalescent patients. reduced intensity of the GDO3-S band probed with either anti\u2013VRP-S mouse sera or the convalescent human serum is most likely due to the presence of lower GDO3-S protein. average icSARS-CoV and icGDO3-S titers were similar on day 7. average icSARS-CoV and icGDO3-S titers were similar on day 7. average icSARS-CoV and icGDO3-S titers were similar on day 7. six-week-old female mice were infected with icSARS-CoV or icGDO3-S. the individual titer of each mouse is represented by a filled circle. groups of eight animals were primed at 7 wk of age with 106 IU of VRP-S, VRP-N, VRP-S+N, or VRP-HA. Lung titers of aged BALB/c mice vaccinated at greater than 26 wk of age, boosted 4 wk later, then challenged 12 wk post-boost with icGDO3-S. icSARS-CoV vaccines should confer protection to elderly subjects who face infection with new variant of the virus. cinated with VRP-N and PBS were similar at 4.4 0.5 and 4.7 0.6 log10 pfu/g. all eight lungs harvested from the VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated animals were positive for viral replication. a mean titer of 3.5 1.2 log10 pfu/g was comparable to the mean titer for VRP-S\u2013vaccinated mice (p = 0.4) plasma reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) of serum samples harvested prior to vaccination showed no neutralization of icSARS-CoV. similar results were noted from serum collected from mice vaccinated with the negative controls. neutralizing activity of sera from the vaccinated animals was more effective against the vaccine strain than against heterologous icGDO3-S virus. the reciprocal dilutions for the PRNT80 of the VRP-S samples at 5 wk post-boost were below the limit of detection. the PRNT80 values for individual animals are shown as black circles. the limits of detection (1:1,600 upper and 1:100 lower) are represented by horizontal dotted lines. sera from the VRP-S+N\u2013inoculated mice had PRNT80 values falling near or below the limit of detection with only one measurable sample at 114. ELISAs for total IgG specific for SARS-S and influenza-HA were performed on sera collected prechallenge from the VRP-S\u2013 and VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated mice of experiments 2 and 4. the difference between animals of the two age groups was even more striking when anti-S IgG levels were compared in the VRP-S+N mice. the reduced ability of sera harvested from senescent animals to neutralize virus correlates to a general reduction in antigen-specific antibody production. log10 half-maximum ELISA titers for anti-S IgG antibody in aged mice vaccinated when young (experiment 2) or senescent (experiment 4). values represent mean values, and error bars indicate standard deviation. the animals vaccinated with S+N showed a similar, but less severe, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration around pulmonary vessels and bronchiolar airways. the lungs were similar to VRP-HA\u2013 or PBS mock-vaccinated animals with minimal lymphoplasmacytic cell accumulations. however, N vaccination also resulted in an enhanced immunopathology in the lungs of the senescent animals upon viral challenge. light photomicrographs of representative histologic lung sections taken from mock PBS\u2013vaccinated mouse (A) and (B), a VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mouse (C) and (D), a VRP-S\u2013vaccinated mouse (E) and (F), or a VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated mouse (G) and (H) denote the site of the light photomicrograph that was taken at a higher magnification. young (8 wk of age) or senescent (53 wk of age) female BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 106 IU of VRP-N or VRP-HA, boosted 7 wk later, then i.n. challenged with 105 pfu of icSARS-CoV 4 wk post-boost. in young mice, day 2 average lung titers were 7.5 0.2 log10 pfu/ one VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mouse had a detectable titer of 3.7 log10 pfu/g. the lungs of two VRP-HA\u2013vaccinated mice were positive for replication. no virus was detected in either group on day 14 post\u2013challenge. Enhanced inflammation was evident by day 2 (A) and (B) in some VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animals relative to lung sections of VRP-HA\u2013inoculated mice. by day 4 post-infection (C) and (D), increased inflammation in VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animals was widely apparent. all tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. anti-SARS-N antibody and inflammation A passive transfer of anti-N, anti-HA, or anti-S sera into naive mice was performed. virus titers in the young mice were 5.0 0.1 log10 pfu/g in the anti\u2013VRP-HA group. senescent mice were 5.3 0.3 log10 pfu/g in the anti\u2013VRP-HA group, 5.6 0.6 in animals receiving the anti\u2013VRP-S. none of the mice displayed enhanced inflammation noted in VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animals. sates revealed a major product of less than 50 kDa, the expected sizes for SARS-S and -N respectively. Western blots were performed with vero cell lysates infected with the SARS-CoV strains Urbani, Tor-2, icSARS-CoV and icGD03-S. six 4-wk-old mice were vaccinated with either 105 IU of VRP-S or VRP-HA. i.n. challenged with 105 pfu of icSARS-CoV 8 wk post-boost. no virus was detected by plaque assay (250 pfu/g limit of detection) titers of 16-wk-old mice harvested 2 d after being infected with 105 PFU of icSARS-CoV. i.n. challenged with 105 pfu of icSARS-CoV expressing influenza HA. five-week-old mice were vaccinated with 105 IU of VRP-HA, VRP-S, VRP-N, or a combination of VRP-S and VRP-N (VRP-S+N) mice were i.n. challenged with 105 pfu of icSARS-CoV and lungs removed 4 d post-infection. cinated animals exhibited extensive in situ signal. only one of five sections from VRP-S\u2013vaccinated (Figure 2C, image b) and zero of five sections from VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated (Figure 2C, image c) mice exhibited SARS-CoV N-specific signal. both VRP-S and the combination of VRP-S+N provided complete long-term protection against challenge. polyclonal antibody directed against the late-phase Urbani strain was less effective at neutralizing pseudotyped viruses bearing GDO3-S glycoproteins than those bearing Urbani-S [31] polyclonal antibody directed against the late-phase strain was less effective at neutralizing pseudotyped viruses bearing GDO3-S glycoproteins than those bearing Urbani-S. chimeric icGDO3-S and wild-type icSARS-CoV recombinant viruses replicated in icSARS-CoV\u2013infected mice were infected with 105 pfu of either icSARS or icGDO3-S. at 2 d post-infection, icSARS-CoV mean lung titer was 6.8 0.5 log10 pfu/g. icGDO3-S titers were lower at 6.3 0.2 log10 pfu/g (p = 0.04). the GDO3-S amino acid changes are shown in relation to the S1 and S2 subunits, the receptor binding domain (RBD), heptad repeats one (HR1) and two (HR2), the transmembrane domain (TM), and known neutralizing epitopes. two mutations that arose during tissue culture passage are shown in red. high titers of virus were detected in VRP-N\u2013 and mock-vaccinated animals with mean titers of 6.3 0.1 and 7.0 0.1 log10 pfu/g respectively. the VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animals had a lower mean titer (p 0.001) icSARS challenge animals failed to induce complete protection from icGD03-S challenge. sections from two of five S- and three of four S+N-vaccinated animals showed signal above that of uninfected controls. vaccinated 6-mo-old to 1-y-old BALB/c retired breeders with 106 IU of VRP-S, VRP-N, VRP-S+N, or PBS, boosted them 4 wk later, and challenged them 32 riboprobe was hybridized to lung sections of mice from PBS-, VRP-N\u2013, VRP-S\u2013, and VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated groups. all tested lung sections from PBS mocks and VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animals exhibited in situ signal. signal did not appear to be as intense as that of the icSARS-CoV\u2013infected animals. sera from mice vaccinated with the combination of VRP-S+N had reciprocal PRNT80 of 1,091 361 and 370 179 at 5 and 53 wk, respectively. the initial neutralizing response in animals vaccinated with VRP-S and VRP-S+N was similar (p = 0.2 at 5 wk post-boost) PRNT80 for VRP-S and VRP-S+N hyperimmune Serum collected at 5 wk post-boost (n = 5) and 53 wk post-boost (n = 8) the mean value is shown as a solid bar. the limits of detection are represented by horizontal dotted lines. sera from the VRP-S+N\u2013inoculated mice had PRNT80 values falling near or below the limit of detection with only one measurable sample at 114. a single VRP-S\u2013vaccinated animal showed a neutralizing titer of 179 at 12 wk post-boost, for an average dilution of 116 35 for the group. a strong anti\u2013SARS-CoV neutralizing response was not induced by the VRP vaccine the difference between animals of the two age groups was even more striking when anti-S IgG levels were compared in the VRP-S+N mice. the average anti-HA titer of animals vaccinated when young was 4.7 0.2, while the titer of the vaccinated senescent mice was approximately one-tenth the size with a mean titer of 3.7 0.8. ted senescent mice challenge studies were sectioned, hematoxylin stained, and analyzed for pathology. only minor inflammatory changes were observed in the senescent control mice challenged with either icSARS or icGDO3-S. however, following SARS-CoV challenge, the animals vaccinated with S+N also showed a similar, but less severe, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration around pulmonary vessels and bronchiolar airways. a marked mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of mononuclear leukocytes (lymphocytes and plasma cells) and widely scattered eosinophils are evident in the perivascular and peribronchiolar interstitium in (B) similar inflammatory cells are also present in bronchiolar airways and alveolar airspaces along with enlarged and vacuolated alveolar macrophages. the boxes in (A), (C), (E) and (G) (200 magnification) denote the site of the light photomicrograph that was taken at a higher magnification (400) to better illustrate the lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cell infiltrates including eosinophils. all tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. titers in the VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice lungs had dropped to the limit of detection by day 7. virus was undetectable in either group in senescent animals. the day 2 average lung titers were 8.2 0.2 and 8.5 0.1 log10 pfu/g. at day 2 post-infection, eosinophils were rarely seen in either VRP-HA\u2013 or VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice. there was no apparent difference in severity between the young and senescent animals. there was no apparent difference in severity between the young and senescent animals. widespread eosinophils are seen at day 7 post-challenge in VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice. by day 14 (G) and (H), eosinophils are rarely found among inflammatory cells of VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice. serum was collected from mice prior to challenge with 105 pfu of icSARS. senescent mice (n = 4) had a mean ELISA serum titer of 2.8 2.4 log10 OD = 0.2. senescent mice (n = 4) had a 2.9 1.8 log10 OD = 0.2 ELISA titer. vaccinated animals evaluated as candidate vaccines against homologous and zoonotic SARS-CoV challenge. mice with VRP-S induced antibody that recognized the epidemic SARS-CoV S glycoprotein as well as the S of a highly divergent strain, GDO3. vaccine induced long-term protection against challenge with the vaccine strain. mice vaccinated with VRP-S did not show a significant reduction in neutralizing titers up to 53 wk post-boost. mice vaccinated with the combination of VRP-S+N experienced about a 3-fold reduction over the same period of time. icSARS PRNT80 greater than 1:114 did not protect mice from SARS replication. vaccination with formalin-inactivated RSV has not been previously reported. this is probably because most studies examined young mice at 2\u20133 d post-infection. this finding has particular significance for SARS-N and inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines. the icGD03-S recombinant virus was identical to the molecular clone except for the presence of two mutations in S that likely evolved after transfection of full-length RNA and virus passage in Vero cells. the icGDO3-S CoV's sequence divergence from Urbani, efficient in vitro replication in HAE and Vero cultures, and robust in vivo replication in the mouse model, make it an excellent heterologous challenge inoculum for the combination of VRP-S+N did not enhance protection from heterologous challenge. senescent animals showed even lower anti-S antibody responses and even higher rate of viral replication. incomplete protection by a vaccine in immunosenescent animals and humans is well documented. icGD03 mutations map in and around the N-terminus and RBD in S1 [31]. it is possible that either one or both of these critical epitopes are significantly different in icGD03-S. this suggests robust neutralizing titers should be induced by candidate vaccines to provide long-term protection from SARS-CoV infection. protein did not reproduce enhanced infectivity in pseudotyped viruses bearing SZ3-S. conserved epitopes allowed all three strains to be effectively neutralized. a vaccine conferred long-term protection into the period in which a host is most susceptible to SARS-CoV pathology: senescence. the cost and limited availability of other senescent species make the mouse model invaluable. important caveats must be considered while evaluating this work. hamster, primate, and ferret models of SARS disease have limitations. virus bearing zoonotic S glycoproteins suggests it might be feasible to reconstruct other rare zoonotic SARS-CoVs that have never been successfully cultured. these studies should encourage the development of senescent animal models of human disease and encourage vaccine testing and design against influenza, west Nile virus, and other pathogens."}
