{"summary": "the formation of intra-molecular canonical G4s requires at least four regions of three consecutive Gs in a single strand, separated by 1\u20137 linking nucleotides known as loops. more recently, non-canonical G4s were discovered [6], such as G4s with long loops [5], bulges [7,8], 2-quartets [9], duplexes [12], and triplexes [13]. guanosines can also be oriented as anti- or syn- conformations based on whether the purine rings are flipped outward or inwards with respect to the pentose sugar. such conformational variety leads to wide, medium, and narrow grooves that describe the spatial availability of the corresponding edge of the G-quartet. biochemical methods such as polymerase stop assay [29] and dimethyl sulfate footprinting [30] can interrogate DNA G4 formation by template extension stalling and measuring the guanine nucleotide\u2019s resistance to the attachment of a chemical probe. in vitro methods that utilize rG4-mediated reverse transcriptase stalling have been developed to map distinctive structural patterns of rG4. aptamers have been widely applied to target a wide range of pathogenic proteins and small molecules to emit a fluorescence-like signal. in this review, we will discuss current challenges and future perspectives for better detection and targeting of G4s in diverse organisms. platinum (II) complexes are another representative example of inorganic G4 ligand. platinum (II) complexes are another representative example of inorganic G4 ligand. platinum (II) complexes are another representative example of inorganic G4 ligand. Ruthenium (II) complexes have been reported as a selective luminescence probe for G4 detection. they occur via stacking of the ligand onto the G-tetrad and also based on insertion of the complex into the groove. some advantages of inorganic fluorogenic ligands include tunability and distinct properties. N-methyl meso porphyrin IX (NMM) is a major example of the porphyrin class of ligands. it has fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of 393 nm and 610 nm respectively. it shows favorable binding to parallel G4s compared with anti-parallel G4s. asymmetric anionic porphyrin \u2014 Inhibitors of different enzymes \u2014 Easy to develop label free sensors \u2014 Selective and sensitive G4 ligand \u2014 Allow real time study of G4. a Stokes shift and a red-shift emission were observed when applied, both of which were higher than the emissions seen with a different class of ligand, thioflavin T (ThT) benzothiozole 3,6-dimethyl-2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl) benzothiazolium cation Thioflavin T (ThT), Yes (2390-54-7) \u2014 Sensitive and efficient G4 fluorescence sensor for human telomeric DNA. also, shown to detect biothiols in blood samples. cell\u2019s other components \u2014 ThT induced G4s can potentially cause topological changes \u2014 Produces false positive and false negative results. it binds tightly to non-G4 G\u2013A-rich containing sequences and dimerizes them into a parallel double-stranded mode.

Pyrene Pyrene template-assembled synthetic G-quartet (PyroTASQ), No \u2014 Multitasking G4s smart probe (stabilizing ligand and fluorescence turn-on probe) this ligand and probe were demonstrated to recognize and bind to both DNA and RNA G4s. the interaction occurs through an interesting approach with Pyro-TASQ. NMM was applied as an inhibitor of G4 unwinding by stabilizing and preventing helicase from accessing the desired G4 strand. this method required an RNA\u2013DNA substrate (with the DNA strand containing G4-forming sequences) the RNA strand gets cleaved and the DNA strand gets released, which then folds into G4 and subsequently binds with NMM. ligand-specific regulation of nitrate assimilation in Paracoccus denitrificans. this method was based on stabilization of the nasT gene (which contains G4) by the 5,10,-15,20-tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine (TMPyP4) ligand. cationic derivatives such as 5,10,15,20-tetra-4-[2-(1-methyl benzothiozole Thioflavin T (ThT), a 3,6-dimethyl-2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl) benzothiazolium cation, is also a commercially available dye like NMM, but unlike NMM, ThT is cationic (benzothiozole) ThT was first reported in 2013 as a G4 ligand to study the human telomere G4 22AG [dAGGG(TTAGGG)3], and it was demonstrated to differentiate between G4 duplexes and single strands with high fluorescence intensity [87,95] ThT has also been applied as a label-free fluorescent turn-on ligand for sensing bio-thiols based on its ability to induce unique G4 structures. ThT was applied as an energy acceptor, with a conjugated polymer on the other side as the energy donor. this method was based on an aptamer (selected against a toxin) binding to ThT to form a G4\u2013ThT complex. when the toxin is present, it binds to the G4-based aptamer, which leads to the release of ThT, and a subsequent change in fluorescence is observed. benzothiozole ring with either a (p-(dimethylamino)-benzoyl)-oxy)-ethyl group (ThT-HE) or a hydroxyethyl group (ThT-HE) applied them as parallel G4 probes. results showed over 200-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity compared with normal ThT. other benzothiazoles have been reported, such as IMT. this method was shown to allow subcellular monitoring and live-cell monitoring of infected cells. but the limitation of this ligand class include the fact that only few were shown to penetrate the cells [107] and reach their desired target. the possible reasons could be due to their physical size, non-selectivity in complex samples or conditions. the mechanism of interaction with G4s was shown to occur via stacking to the terminal (5\u2032-end) G-quartet [51]. Similarly, the mechanism of interaction with G4s was demonstrated to occur via pi\u2013pi stacking of the ligand and the ending G-quartet of the G4. some representative aptasensors are attracting enormous scientific interest. one example is an aptasensor selected through modified-affinity chromatography. CV was also applied as a biosensor for the detection of Pb2+ based on the electrochemical current of a G4\u2013CV complex. this method was shown to measure the amount of G-rich sequences that partake in G4 formation based on the fluorescence enrichment of G4\u2013CV complexes. that same year, a novel biosensor for the homogenous sensing of K+ was also reported. this method was based on the interaction between G4 containing a thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) and CV. acridine-based ligands are largely used as efficient G4 stabilizers, such as trisubstituted acridines. acridine-based ligands are largely used as efficient G4 stabilizers, such as trisubstituted acridines. BRACO-19 was shown to bind to acridine via three modes of interaction. the ligand was shown to bind parallel G4s via an end-stacking approach. it was also shown to have incredible selectivity towards parallel G4s. a new class of bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone derivative called GD3 is an effective red-emitting fluorescence turn-on ligand for parallel G4s. they demonstrated the biological application of this ligand in fixed cells. the limitation of this ligand is that it can only allow monitoring of G4s in fixed cells. telomeric DNA damage and telomere functional disruption caused by the ligand intercalation into the G4 structure. a \u201cone-to-one G4-specific sensor\u201d, IZFL-2, can distinguish between different G4s. this method allows the visualization of interactions between ligands and G4s by fluorescence lifetime microscopy. the refined ISCH-1 ligand was called (E)-3-(7-(7-(diethylamino)-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)methylene)-7-fluoro-4-methyl-9-oxo-6-prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)-1,2,3,9-tetrahydropyrrolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-4-ium (ISCH-oa1) [142]. QUMA-1 was demonstrated through live-cell imaging to be a highly selective fluorescence turn-on probe. it was also applied in the visualization of rG4s unwinding by helicase. the interaction between QUMA-1 and rG4 was demonstrated to be caused by the rotational constraint experienced by the ligand at higher energy levels because of a conformational rearrangement. the same group demonstrated another multitasking G4 probe synthesized in an approach similar to that of PyroTASQ. the authors were able to visualize RNA G4s in live cells using the multi-photon microscopy method. however, no binding competition with other G4 ligands was shown. some of these ligands can effectively penetrate the cells [107] and reach their desired target [108] permeability, affinity, and selectivity are critical factors that need to be further improved when designing and developing advance novel fluorescence G4 probes. more advanced ligands are required with an improved property to reach their targets in cells and across different species. representative fluorescent turn-on G4 ligands and their corresponding characteristics and applications Class Ligand and Commercial Availability (CAS no.)

Aptasensor for Adenosine deaminase activity and inhibition. cell permeable and highly specific G4 based fluorescence turn-on probe for real time imaging of native viral RNA genome in hepatitis C virus. this method was shown to allow subcellular monitoring and continuous live-cell monitoring of native viral RNA genome. fluorescence probe for G4 visualization in live cells, based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. this probe was demonstrated to be cell permeable, have low toxicity, and be localized in the nucleus. this was demonstrated to differentiate between wild-type c-Myc G4 and other G4s. it was not yet demonstrated in live cells [139] 2,4,5-triaryl-substituted imidazole (IZCM-1), No. can discriminate between telomeric multimeric G4s and monomeric G4s. ,2,3,9-tetrahydropyrrolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-4-ium iodide (ISCH-1), No \u2014 Multifunctional (colorimetric and red-emitting fluorescence) turn-on probe for specific G4 detection. method is ideal for reliability and diverse applications. highly selective fluorescence turn-on probe for real time and continuous tracking of rG4 structural dynamics in live cells. applied in visualization of rG4s unwinding by helicase. Naphthalene Naptho-template-assembled synthetic G-quartet (N-TASQ), no. Multitasking G4s smart probe stabilizing ligand and fluorescence turn-on probe. both RNA and DNA G4s were visualized using confocal microscopy. the interaction occurs through similar approach with Pyro-TASQ. the RNA strand gets cleaved and the DNA strand gets released. it folds into G4 and subsequently binds with NMM. the method was able to detect as few as 50 cells mL1 and 80 cells mL1 of E. coli and S. aureus. cationic derivatives such as 5,10,15,20-tetra-4-[2-(1-methyl-1-piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl porphyrin (TMPipEOPP) and TMPyP4 were also applied as significant G4 binding ligands. the ligand was shown to allow visual discrimination between G4s, duplexes and single-stranded DNA. the parent ligand, TMPyP4, from which ZnTMPyP4 was derived, was also shown to inhibit telomerase via external stacking on the G-tetrads. at lower concentrations, one G4 binds one TMPipEOPP ligand via an \u2018end stacking and outside binding\u2019 approach [86]. at lower concentrations, one G4 binds one TMPipEOPP ligand via an \u2018end stacking and outside binding NMM was applied with tetrakis(diisopropylguanidino)-zinc-phthalocyanine (Zn-DIGP) to develop a dual fluorescent probe for the detection of nucleic acids. a large Stokes shift and a red-shift emission were observed. this could be due to the green fluorescence emission of ThT. tetra-4-[2-(1-methyl-1-piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl porphyrin (TMPipEOPP) and TMPyP4 were also applied as significant G4 binding ligands [86] ligands were shown to allow visual discrimination between G4s, duplexes and single-stranded DNA [86] ligand, TMPyP4, from which ZnTMPyP4 was derived, was also shown to inhibit telomerase via external stacking on the G-tetrads. at lower concentrations, one G4 binds one TMPipEOPP ligand via an \u2018end stacking and outside binding\u2019 approach. ThT was first reported in 2013 as a G4 ligand to study the human telomere G4 22AG [dAGGG(TTAGGG)3], and it was demonstrated to differentiate between G4 duplexes and single strands with high fluorescence intensity [87,95] ThT has also been applied as a label-free fluorescent turn-on ligand for sensing bio-thiols based on its ability to induce unique G4 structures. some G4 studies have indicated that ThT-induced G4s can potentially cause topological changes [101], producing false positive and false negative results. ThT was found to be difficult to use for effective monitoring of G4s in the chromatin of live cells because of its inability to stain. ThT derivatives have been applied in viral RNA genome detection and monitoring. this was demonstrated by Luo et al. [107], who developed the ligand ThT\u2013NE. the ligand was a cell permeable and highly specific G4-based fluorescence turn-on probe for real-time imaging of native viral RNA in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) mechanism of interaction between ThT and G4s was demonstrated to be ligand concentration dependent, in which several ThT ligands bound cooperatively to the 5\u2032-G4 unit [87] the enhanced fluorescence intensity was demonstrated to be a result of the restriction in circular movement and subsequent conformational changes. ThT was first reported in 2013 as a G4 ligand to study the human telomere G4 22AG [dAGGG(TTAGGG)3], and it was demonstrated to differentiate between G4 duplexes and single strands with high fluorescence intensity [87,95] ThT has also been applied as a label-free fluorescent turn-on ligand for sensing bio-thiols based on its ability to induce unique G4 structures. amer binding to ThT to form a G4\u2013ThT complex (in the absence of the target toxin) binds to the G4-based aptamer, which leads to the release of ThT. a subsequent change in fluorescence is observed [100]. can selectively bind G4s in a cell\u2019s chromatin (with negligible cytotoxicity) it can be applied in vivo to demonstrate the changing response of G4s to different chemicals in real time. this method is simpler than the triangulenium method reported earlier [52]. novel fluorescence G4 probes include permeability, affinity, selectivity, and cytotoxicity. some G4-containing aptamers (such as Mango) enhance fluorescence intensities of many ligands with no discriminating properties between them. there is a need for G4 ligand with higher specificity, affinity, and low toxicity for live cell application. the TPM class of ligands has many members, including methyl violet (MV), ethyl violet (EV), methyl green (MEG), malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV) this class was shown to distinguish intramolecular from intermolecular G4s and single DNA strands from duplex DNAs. it has fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of 540 nm and 640 nm, respectively, as shown in Table 1 the ATP aptamer is in a duplex format (i.e., hybridized to its complementary sequence); in the absence of ATP, the duplex dissociates, resulting in an aptamer\u2013G4 complex via a \u2018population shift mechanism\u2019. the presence of CV results in its specific binding to the G4 complex, thus enhancing the fluorescence. this biosensor was based on increasing and decreasing fluorescence intensity with increasing K+. however, this method was based on the interaction between G4 containing a thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) and CV. however, in the presence of K+, TBA-based G4 is formed. aptasensors preferentially bind to intramolecular rather than intermolecular G4. it is also applied in biosensing and thrombin detection. CV was also applied as a biosensor for detection of Pb2+. in 2009, Kong et al. demonstrated a simple and sensitive method for discriminating between G4s, single strands and duplexes based on fluorescence enhancement of CV or CV energy transfer fluorescence. this method was shown to measure the amount of G-rich sequences that partake in G4 formation based on the fluorescence enrichment of G4\u2013CV complexes. this biosensor was based on increasing and decreasing fluorescence intensity with increasing K+. mechanism of interaction demonstrated to occur via stacking of CV to the two outside G-quartets of G4 [118] and the binding of two CVs per one G4. stacking increased the rigidity of the ligand and subsequently the fluorescence intensity. the first fluorogenic acridine dyes containing cyanine allowed a wide spectrum ranging from orange to the near infrared region. the same group (motivated again by the incredible potential of BRACO-19) demonstrated the development of a tri-substituted (3,6,9-trisubstituted acridine; cyanine dye 1) water-soluble acridine-based dual probe, a pH-sensitive and G4 fluorescence probe the ligand was shown to bind parallel G4s via an end-stacking approach. it was also shown to have incredible selectivity towards parallel G4s due to its possession of a \u2018crescent-shaped pi-conjugated planar core\u2019. telomeric multimeric G4 structures can discriminate between telomeric multimeric G4s and monomeric G4s. ligand intercalated into the \u2018pocket\u2019 of two G-quartet units of G4. this ligand induces apoptosis and senescence in cancer cells. isaindigotone framework incorporated coumarin\u2013hemicyanine to achieve a multifunctional probe. the application of this ligand was demonstrated with 5\u2032 UTR of NRAS mRNA. this ligand has limitations of not able to detect the \u2018in-situ spots\u2019 of a given RNA in single cell. ligand was named (E)-2-(2-(7-(diethylamino)-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)vinyl)-6-fluoro-1-methyl-7-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)quinolin-1-ium iodide (QUMA-1) unlike GD3 ligand that was only shown in fixed cells, QUMA-1 was demonstrated through live-cell imaging to be a highly selective flu the application of PyroTASQ to detect G4s in live cells proved difficult as it aggregates in the cells. the same group demonstrated another multitasking G4 probe synthesized in an approach similar to that of PyroTASQ. the authors were able to visualize RNA G4s in live cells using the multi-photon microscopy method. ligand competition studies with other competing ligands are needed to fully ascertain the selectivity of the ligands of interest. this will allow the design and development of ligands with better fluorescent properties. this could prevent off-target effects of some of these ligands as a result of their ability to induce topological changes. the iterative SELEX process selects aptamers for targets of interest from a library of random sequences. aptamers are proposed to function as alternatives to other affinity reagents. these properties can be successfully exploited in drug delivery, molecular imaging, clinical diagnosis, and biochemical research [151,152]. a list of representative G4s-containing DNA and RNA aptamers is shown in Table 2. RNA is also equipped to form aptamers owing to its great structural flexibility. aptamers have been reported against targets including proteins and small molecules. RT47 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase d(GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG DFHBI r(GAUGUAACUGAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG the existence of G4 structures in aptamers ideally combines the superior properties of G4 and the intrinsic binding capabilities of aptamers. these features favor the application of G-quadruplex-containing aptamers in biosensing, bioimaging, and therapeutics. aptamers are based on the conformational switching of aptamers. target binding can cause distortion on aptamers and stabilize or destabilize the G4 structure. aptamer-based biosensors have become powerful diagnostic tools. a single-stranded thrombin aptamer was absorbed onto the surface of graphene. it formed a G4-thrombin complex, which had weak affinity to the graphene and thus dissociated from the graphene. in the presence of thrombin, its aptamer specifically bound to thrombin and folded into a G4 structure. ATP has been used as a target in many assays because of its biological significance. the method was capable of detecting ATP in human serum and cell extracts. ATP detection was based on a molecular beacon as the signal output. hairpin DNA switched to a G4 structure and was bound to ATP. the re-organized G4 hairpin structure allowed Exo III to hydrolytically digest the 3\u2032-end strand. thus BHQ1 was released into solution and the fluorescence of FAM was recovered. wei group achieved in vivo detection of K+ in living organisms. RNA Spinach is a 98nt SELEX-identified RNA aptamer that can fold into a G4 structure and switch on the fluorescence of 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI). RNA Spinach has been demonstrated to be a powerful bioimaging tool because of its strong resistance to photo-bleaching [175]. RNA Mango has a more rigid G4 structure, which activates the fluorescence of thiazole orange derivatives. aptamers spinach and mango were placed in close proximity to obtain FRET. a new fluorophore was synthesized to increase the spectral overlap. the AS1411 aptamer is a 26nt G-rich DNA sequence that can fold into a G4 structures and bind to nucleolin with strong affinity and specificity. the concept could be adapted to other diseases that involve cellular biomarkers and their aptamers as gating units. aptamers have been structurally determined (TBA, Spinach, Mango, etc. ). the structures of other G4-containing aptamers are still poorly understood. identifying novel G4-containing aptamers against new targets will broaden the scope of this research area. fluorometric biomolecule aptasensors are based on the conformational switching of aptamers. target binding can cause distortion on aptamers and stabilize or destabilize the G4 structure. aptamer-based biosensors have become powerful diagnostic tools. thrombin has been employed as an analyte in some aptasensors. a single-stranded thrombin aptamer was absorbed onto the surface of graphene due to noncovalent assembly. the fluorescence of FAM was quenched because of the FRET effect. TBA formed a G4-thrombin complex, resulting in a high FRET signal. this method can also be used for human serum thrombin detection. ATP has been used as a target in many assays because of its biological significance. the hairpin DNA switched to a G4 structure and was bound to ATP. the re-organized G4 hairpin structure allowed Exo III to hydrolytically digest the 3\u2032-end strand. in the absence of ATP, the hairpin DNA switched to a G4 structure and was bound to ATP. RNA Spinach is a 98nt SELEX-identified RNA aptamer that can fold into a G4 structure and switch on the fluorescence of 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) [175]. RNA Spinach is a powerful bioimaging tool because of its strong resistance to photo-bleaching [175]. mango has a more rigid G4 structure, which activates the fluorescence of thiazole orange derivatives. RNA Mango has also been used to bioimaging systems. the AS1411 aptamer is a 26nt G-rich DNA sequence that can fold into a G4 structures and bind to nucleolin with strong affinity and specificity. the concept could be adapted to other diseases that involve cellular biomarkers and their aptamers as gating units. only a few G4-containing aptamers have been structurally determined. structures of other G4-containing aptamers are still poorly understood. identifying novel G4-containing aptamers against new targets will broaden the scope of this research area. more efforts should be made to develop G4-containing aptamer-based systems. to resist nuclease digestion and increase G4-containing aptamer\u2019s lifetime in cells/in vivo, unnatural nucleotide base modifications can be used. further improvement in this area will facilitate better G4-containing aptamer stability and delivery in complex system."}
