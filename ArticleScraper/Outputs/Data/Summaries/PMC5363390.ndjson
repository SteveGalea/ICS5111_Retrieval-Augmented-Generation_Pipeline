{"summary": "IFNs are secreted antiviral cytokines that bind in a paracrine and autocrine manner to cellular receptors and trigger signaling cascades culminating in the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) most ISGs have antiviral functions, although some ISGs with both antiviral and proviral functions have been previously described. viruses have developed measures to counteract PKR's antiviral actions. dsRNA sequestration, decoy substrates, and direct interaction of virally encoded inhibitory proteins with PKR. PKR regulates responses to oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and serum starvation. stress response pathway is negatively regulated by TRBP. phosphorylation at serine 287 in response to cellular stress decreases its interaction with TRBP. thus, TRBP negatively regulates PKR activation, during viral infections and in response to cellular stress. our findings indicate that PACT increases HIV-1 gene expression at the translational level via inhibition of PKR activation by acting in concert with an HIV-1-encoded protein Tat and a cellular protein ADAR1 to bring about sustained PKR inhibition. our study also highlights the importance of ADAR1 in this multiprotein complex as a key component that mediates PKR inhibition during HIV-1 infection. mutant pGL3 basic plasmid was inserted as an oligonucleotide in the HindIII\u2013BamHI sites of pcDNA3-EGFP (Addgene) mutant pGL3 basic plasmid was excised from the pcDNA3-EGFP plasmid and inserted into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) the mutant pGL3 basic plasmid was devoid of TAR. -Galactosidase activity was assayed 24 h after transfection using the Galacto-Star Assay System. cDNA was synthesized at 42\u00b0C for 1 h using random hexamer primers, 1 g of total RNA, M-MuLV reverse transcriptase, 500 M dNTPs and RNase inhibitor RNAsin. real-time PCR RNA was isolated from PKR/ MEFs transfected with either the CMV-TAR-LUC pGL3 Basic or CMV-Luciferase pGL3 Basic plasmids. the indicated combinations of flag wild-type PKR/pcDNA 3.1, Tat/pcDNA 3 and Flag PACT/pCMV2 expression constructs were used. cDNA was synthesized as described above using random hexamer primer one nanogram of pRL-null (Promega) plasmid was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiencies. cell extracts were prepared at indicated time points, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system. the beads were washed four times in 500 l of high-salt buffer and twice in activity buffer. PKR was activated using synthesized TAR RNA (IDT DNA Technologies) the effect of PACT, Tat, ADAR1 and TRBP on TAR-activated PKR was assayed by addition of increasing amounts of pure recombinant PACT or pure recombinant TRBP. beads were washed in 500 l of IP buffer four times. the beads were then boiled in laemmli buffer for 2 min. eluted proteins were analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE. radioactive bands were scanned for the TRBP\u2013ADAR1 and PACT\u2013ADAR1 co-immunoprecipitation assays (Typhoon FLA7000) a two-tailed Student's t-test was performed, assuming equal variance. each figure legend indicates P-values as denoted by brackets and special characters. mutant oligonucleotide was excised from the pcDNA3-EGFP plasmid. mutant pGL3 basic vector was inserted into the pGL3 basic vector. mutant pGL3 basic was constructed by inserting the mutated oligonucleotide into the pGL3 basic vector. cDNA was synthesized at 42\u00b0C for 1 h using random hexamer primers. cDNA was synthesized at 42\u00b0C for 1 h using random hexamer primers. cDNA was synthesized at 42\u00b0C for 1 h using random hexamer primers. plasmids were transfected with either the CMV-TAR-LUC pGL3 Basic or CMV-Luciferase pGL3 Basic plasmids. the indicated combinations of flag wild-type PKR/pcDNA 3.1, Tat/pcDNA 3 and Flag PACT/pCMV2 expression constructs. cDNA was synthesized as described above using random hexamer primers. pRL-null (Promega) plasmid was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiencies. firefly and Renilla luciferase activity assays were performed using an anti-PKR monoclonal antibody (71/10, R&D systems) the protein-A agarose beads were washed four times in 500 l of high-salt buffer and twice in activity buffer [20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM PMSF and 5% glycerol] the PKR assay was performed with PKR still attached to the beads in activity buffer containing 0.1 m beads were washed in 500 l of IP buffer four times and boiled in laemmli buffer. eluted proteins were analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE on a 12% gel. ADAR1 was expressed as a GAL4 DNA-activation domain fusion protein. radioactive bands were scanned for the TRBP\u2013ADAR1 and PACT\u2013ADAR1 co-immunoprecipitation assays. the -galactosidase and luciferase assays were quantified using the GE Life Sciences ImageQuant TL software. the addition of PACT (green bars) or TRBP (red bars) expression constructs further stimulated Tat-trans-activated HIV-1 LTR-driven -galactosidase activity. however, in the absence of Tat, neither PACT (green bars) nor TRBP (red bars) had any effect on HIV-1 LTR-driven expression. the P-values (0.0045 and 0.0044) calculated using statistical analyses indicated significant difference between the RLU values indicated by the brackets marked as \u2018*\u2019 and \u2018**\u2019, respectively. the expression of Tat increased -galactosidase mRNA levels (lanes 4\u20136) compared with empty vector-transfected HeLa-MAGI-CCR5 cells (lanes 1\u20133) there was no increase in -galactosidase mRNA levels between HeLa-MAGI-CCR5 cells transfected with Tat and PACT. RNA preparation was treated extensively with DNase to digest any DNA contamination. -Galactosidase mRNA expression levels were also analyzed as a normalization control for each cycle number. no PCR products were obtained in the absence of reverse transcriptase. PKR/mEFs were co-transfected with either CMV-TAR-LUC/pGL3 Basic or CMV-Luciferase/pGL3 Basic. co-transfection of PKR with PKR rescued the PKR-mediated reduction in luciferase activity only when TAR was present. PKR inhibits PKR activation on TAR-containing mRNAs. PKR/ MEFs were co-transfected with CMV-TAR-luciferase or CMV luciferase (in pGL3 basic plasmid backbone) PKR/mEFs indicated combinations of Tat/pcDNA3, Flag PKR/pcDNA 3.1 and Flag PACT/pCMV2. Tat-dependent effect on luciferase expression is at translational level, most probably by counteracting PKR activation. PKR co-transfection with this construct dramatically reduced the firefly luciferase activity. however, co-transfection of Tat or PACT had no effect on PKR-mediated inhibition of the luciferase activity. PKR/mEFs were co-transfected with the CMV-TAR-luciferase expression construct. the indicated combinations of Rev/pcDNA 3, Flag PKR/pcDNA 3.1 and Flag PACT/pCMV2 were not significant. the error bars represent the standard deviation from three experiments. a bell-shaped activation curve with no activation at low and high concentrations of TAR RNA. we then assessed PACT's ability to inhibit or activate PKR activation caused by TAR RNA in the absence (Figure 5B, lanes 3\u20136) or presence (Figure 5B, lanes 7\u201310) of Tat. PKR inhibition requires components in addition to PACT and Tat. the phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE and phosphorimager analysis. the RNA-editing protein ADAR1 is essential for complete inhibition of PKR by Tat and PACT. in the absence of Tat, 1.5 ng of ADAR1 showed complete inhibition (lane 2) and 150 and 15 pg of ADAR1 showed partial inhibition of PKR activity (lane 7). these results show that Tat, PACT and ADAR1 act in concert to inhibit PKR. lanes 6\u20138: PKR activity in the presence of varying amounts of ADAR1 alone. lanes 10\u201312: PKR activity in the presence of 4 ng of PACT, 4 ng of Tat and varying amounts of ADAR1. lanes 14\u201316: PKR activity in the presence of 4 ng of PACT. compared with conditions where TRBP was used (lanes 4\u20136) instead of PACT, 150 ng of ADAR1 was required for a complete inhibition of PKR activity (lane 4). however, at 150 mM salt concentration, PACT pulled down 12.3% of ADAR1 whereas TRBP could only pull down 3.2% of ADAR1. AR1 and TRBP pulled down only 1.1% of ADAR1. the yeast two-hybrid system is sensitive enough to detect changes in relative affinities between these proteins. the yeast two-hybrid system measures direct interaction between these proteins.

TRBP or PACT in pGBKT7 and ADAR1 in PGADT7 or empty pGADT7 plasmids were co-transformed into AH109 yeast cells and selected on SD double dropout media lacking tryptophan and leucine. the addition of PACT (green bars) or TRBP (red bars) expression constructs further stimulated Tat-trans-activated HIV-1 LTR-driven -galactosidase activity. however, in the absence of Tat, neither PACT (green bars) nor TRBP (red bars) had any effect on HIV-1 LTR-driven expression. the P-values (0.0045 and 0.0044) calculated using statistical analyses indicated significant difference between the RLU values indicated by the brackets marked as \u2018*\u2019 and \u2018**\u2019. the expression of Tat increased -galactosidase mRNA levels (lanes 4\u20136) compared with empty vector-transfected HeLa-MAGI-CCR5 cells (lanes 1\u20133). no increase in -galactosidase mRNA levels between cells transfected with Tat and PACT or TRBP. RNA preparation was treated extensively with DNase to digest any DNA contamination. -Galactosidase mRNA expression levels were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. no PCR products were obtained in the absence of reverse transcriptase. PKR/mEFs were co-transfected with either CMV-TAR-LUC/pGL3 Basic or CMV-Luciferase/pGL3 Basic. co-transfection of PKR with PKR rescued the PKR-mediated reduction in luciferase activity only when TAR was present. PKR inhibits PKR activation on TAR-containing mRNAs. PKR/ MEFs were co-transfected with CMV-TAR-luciferase or CMV luciferase. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to analyze luciferase mRNA expression levels in samples from PKR/ MEFs transfected. Tat-dependent effect on luciferase expression is at translational level, most probably by counteracting PKR activation. PKR co-transfection with this construct dramatically reduced the firefly luciferase activity. however, co-transfection of Tat or PACT had no effect on PKR-mediated inhibition of PKR. the P-value (0.5852) calculated using statistical analyses indicated a non-significant difference between the RLU values indicated by the bracket marked as \u2018##\u2019. PKR/mEFs were co-transfected with the CMV-TAR-luciferase expression construct and the indicated combinations of Rev/pcDNA 3, Flag PKR/pcDNA 3.1 and Flag PACT/pCMV2. PKR is activated robustly by TAR RNA similar to the synthetic dsRNA polyI:C. we then assessed PACT's ability to inhibit or activate PKR activation caused by TAR RNA in the absence of TAR RNA (Figure 5B, lanes 3\u20136) or presence of Tat. the RNA-editing protein ADAR1 is essential for complete inhibition of TAR-activated PKR by Tat and PACT. the addition of PACT did not improve or compromise the PKR inhibitory function of ADAR1 (lanes 6\u20138) ng ADAR1) was sufficient to inhibit PKR activity in the presence of Tat. compared with the conditions where Tat was absent (lane 6, 150 ng ADAR1). also, when present with ADAR1 does not enhance ADAR1's PKR inhibitory actions. Lanes 2\u20134: PKR activity in the presence of varying amounts of ADAR1 alone; lanes 6\u20138: PKR activity in the presence of 4 ng of PACT and 4 ng of Tat and varying amounts of ADAR1. lanes 14\u201316: PKR activity in the presence of 4 ng of PACT, 4 ng of Tat and varying amounts of ADAR1. at 150 ng of ADAR1 was required for a complete inhibition of PKR activity (lane 4). Unlike PACT, TRBP shows significant inhibition of PKR even in the absence of ADAR1 (lane 3), and this inhibition is further enhanced by the addition of ADAR1 (lane 4\u20136) at 300 mM salt concentration, PACT pulled down 7.3% of ADAR1 and TRBP pulled down only 1.1% of ADAR1. the yeast two-hybrid system is sensitive enough to detect changes in relative affinities between these proteins and measures direct interaction between these proteins. the yeast two-hybrid system is sensitive enough to detect changes in relative affinities between these proteins. Lanes 4\u20136 represent PKR activity in the presence of 4 ng of TRBP. Lane 1 shows the PKR activity without any added activator. phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by phosphorimager analysis. yeast two-hybrid assay to compare TRBP\u2013ADAR1 and PACT\u2013ADAR1 interactions. TRBP or PACT in pGBKT7 and ADAR1 in pGADT7 or empty pGADT7 plasmids were co-transformed into AH109 yeast cells. plates were incubated for 3 days at 30\u00b0C. a knockdown of PKR using siRNAs or overexpression of a trans-dominant negative PKR mutant results in increased HIV-1 replication in cell culture. PKR activation takes place only transiently after HIV-1 infection of PBMCs or of lymphocytic cell lines with either X4 or R5 HIV-1 strains. PKR activation is rapidly inhibited by the presence of HIV-1, which removes a barrier to replication. the results show that TAR-mediated PKR activation is suppressed by a complex of PACT, ADAR1 and the viral protein Tat. however, in this complex, PACT is unable to activate PKR, and ADAR1 and Tat are essential for repressing PACT's PKR-activating role. synthesis by competing with eIF2 for phosphorylation by PKR or by inhibiting PKR activity independently of the presence of TAR. the interaction between TAR and Tat is essential to promote the formation of a PKR inhibitory complex that contains PACT and ADAR1. in ADAR1-deficient cells, PKR autophosphorylation is suppressed following viral infection. but in ADAR1-deficient cells it is enhanced because of lack of editing-mediated destabilization of dsRNA, lack of sequestration of dsRNA by ADAR1. a depletion of ADAR1 by RNAi in human cells or by genetic knockout in mouse MEFs leads to enhanced apoptosis and cytotoxicity following infection with RNA the suppression of PACT activity to effectively inactivate PKR in HIV-1-producing cells is the result of the combined activity of the recruited ADAR1 that mediates PKR kinase inhibition. any effect that Tat may have on PACT's function in RLR-mediated IFN production remains to be explored in future."}
