{"summary": "phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct clusters as RV-A (54%), B (11%) or C (35%) species. patients with RV-B infection were significantly more likely to have the composite outcome variable of death or intensive care unit admission (P =.03) positive samples were archived at 80\u00b0C and sequenced as described in next section. amplicon of 549 nucleotides encompasses the VP4/VP2 region and the hypervariable region in the 5\u2032-noncoding region. sites, antiviral and antibiotic therapy, length of stay, hospitalization status, inpatient mortality, signs and symptoms on presentation, radiographic findings, and laboratory values. major comorbidities were grouped by organ system. patients with active treated malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, rheumatologic conditions treated with immunosuppressive therapy were considered immunocompromised. logistic regression was performed to model the relationship between RV species and a composite primary endpoint of death or ICU admission. the model was used to generate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the study population as a whole. resulting amplicon of 549 nucleotides encompasses the VP4/VP2 region and the hypervariable region in the 5\u2032-noncoding region. only the remaining VP4/VP2 coding region sequences were analyzed to assign RV species. eight viruses that did not cluster with RV-A, RV-B, or RV-C were identified as enteroviruses. patients considered to have an infection at another site if they had a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection from any source. antiviral therapy included any antibacterial agent given around the time of respiratory testing. signs and symptoms were abstracted from the medical record on the day of the medical encounter. those excluded because their samples could not be amplified were significantly more likely to have diabetes (P =.05) and less likely to have hypertension (P =.01). the primary outcome measures of death and ICU admission also did not differ. three enterovirus types were identified from patients, including echovirus 6 (species EV-B), coxsackievirus A13 (EV-C) and EV68 (EV-D). EV71 (DQ381846) is included as representative of the EV-A species. the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU was not significantly different. this outcome occurred in 38% of RV-B patients, 21% of RV-A patients, and 4% of RV-C patients. the odds of death or ICU admission among patients with RV-C infection was 15 times that of patients with RV-C infection. ness Severity, Controlling for Patient Sex Death and ICU admission in these patients did not result exclusively from respiratory illness. additional models were constructed to evaluate the contribution of comorbidities to the outcome. in these models, only the presence of significant coinfection produced a P value less than.05 Table 4. Table 4. Multivariable logistic model of RV type and Illness Severitya Immunocompromised patients and patients with Pulmonary Comorbidities No RV species was associated with greater clinical 80 discrete patient samples were determined to be RV-A (n = 39), RV-B (n = 8), or RV-C (n = 25) a neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the VP4/VP2 coding region nucleic-acid sequences. the mean age was 47 years (range, 18\u201382 years); 53% were female; 30% had an underlying diagnosis of asthma, bronchitis, COPD, or other pulmonary comorbidity; 19% had bacterial pneumonia as diagnosed by the clinical team. hypertension (42%), diabetes (13%), malignancy (30%) were also common. this outcome occurred in 38% of RV-B patients, 21% of RV-A patients, and 4% of RV-C patients. unadjusted logistic model showed that the odds of death or ICU admission among patients with RV-C infection was 15 times that of patients with RV-C infection. additional analyses examining the relationship between RV species and severity of clinical illness in immunocompromised patients found no significant relationship between RV species and severity of clinical illness. the relationship between immunocompromised status and severity of illness was also not significant (data not shown). sex differences in cellular immunity to RV have been described in the literature. the odds of adverse outcome (ICU admission or death) are 3.4 times higher for female patients than for male patients. this lends support to the idea that differences in the adaptive immune response to RV infection could in fact lead to dissimilar clinical outcomes in men and women. immunocompromised status, sex, and/or coexisting illnesses."}
