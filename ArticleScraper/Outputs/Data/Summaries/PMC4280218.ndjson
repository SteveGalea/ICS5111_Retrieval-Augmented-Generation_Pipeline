{"summary": "Recruits with rhinovirus had higher percentages of pneumonia, cough, shortness of breath, congestion, cough, less fever and longer time to seek care. coinfections were found in 6% of all FRI/SARI cases tested and were most frequently seen among children and with rhinovirus infections. 94 037 000 disability adjusted life years and 3.9 million deaths worldwide each year. etiology, seasonality, and coinfection rates vary among populations, regions, and climates. etiology, seasonality, and coinfection rates vary between populations, regions, and climates. FRI and SARI surveillance was conducted between October 2011 and March 2013 among three surveillance groups in the united states. Recruits are typically young and healthy adults who enter into an 8\u201312 week \u201cboot camp\u201d training program. the border sites are not associated with the military and typically capture underserved populations living near the US\u2013Mexico border. border sites included clinics and hospitals in San Ysidro, California; Calexico, California; Brawley, California; El Centro, California; Chula Vista, California; Selles, Arizona; and Tucson, Arizona. the data collected from the border population was part of a surveillance program run by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC extraction system. samples were then tested for a broad-spectrum panel consisting of standard PCR gel tests. the rhinovirus primers used in our study have been found to correctly identify 87 of the 100 distinct rhinovirus subtypes. compared among age stratified groups of doD beneficiaries and US-Mexico border populations. characteristics of rhinovirus, other pathogen, and no/unknown pathogen were compared among military recruits. compared among age stratified groups of doD beneficiaries and US-Mexico border populations.

Variables that were univariately associated with the pathogens (p0.15) were investigated further in a logistic regression model. coinfections were coded as \u201cother pathogen\u201d even if one pathogen was influenza or rhinovirus. 189 (27) 406 (28) DoDbeneficiary 34 (14) 81 (41) 41 (48) 5 (15) 17 (26) 4 (13) 3 (27) 18 (22) 220 (31) 423 (29) Militaryrecruit 173 (73) 29 (15) 3 (4) 15 (45) 35 (53) 24 (75) 3 (27) 39 (48) 294 (42) 615 (43) Severity Outpatient (SARI)* 11 (5) 20 (10) 24 (28) 6 (18) 6 (9) 4 (1 body ache 123 (53) 125 (64) 28 (34) 12 (36) 39 (59) 21 (66) 3 (30) 37 (46) 405 (58) 793 (55) Headache 153 (65) 127 (65) 19 (23) 14 (42) 41 (62) 23 (74) 3 (30) 44 (44) 444 (64) 868 (61) Fever(100\u00b0C) 100 (42) 137 (70) 52 (61) 21 (64) 36 (55) 21 (66) 8 (73) 47 (58) 355 knownPathogen(n = 145) P value Influenza(n = 48) Other(n = 44) No/UnknownPathogen(n = 167) P value Sex(% male) 19 (50) 66 (48) 48 (51) 0.94 42 (51) 27 (43) 61 (43) 0.42 17 (35) 19 (43) 73 (44) 0.57 Studypopulation 0.0071* 0.0061* 0.027* US-Mexicoborder 23 (61) 76 (55) 35 8) 20 (21) 0.12 19 (23) 14 (22) 29 (20) 0.84 24 (50) 25 (57) 106 (63) 0.22 Congestion 29 (78) 88 (68) 68 (76) 0.29 64 (79) 47 (76) 93 (65) 0.057 37 (77) 26 (59) 72 (46) 0.0007* Pink eye 1 (3) 8 (6) 7 (8) 0.56 11 (14) 3 (5) 8 (6) 0.058 6 (13) 1 (2) 2 (1) 0.00 0.024* Signs and symptoms Pneumonia 95 (55) 50 (34) 116 (40) 0.0004* Sore throat 143 (83) 115 (78) 237 (81) 0.53 Cough 163 (94) 144 (97) 234 (80) 0.0001* Nausea 68 (39) 46 (32) 108 (37) 0.33 SOB 104 (60) 60 (41) 142 (48) 0.0018* Congestion 158 (91) 121 (82) 235 ( influenza A (H3N2) was the most common influenza subtype, making up 54% of influenza specimens, followed by influenza B (31%), and pH1N1 (13%). the recruit population had a more constant number of FRI cases sampled than the other two populations throughout the study period. influenza and hMPV cases all had higher temperatures compared with no/unknown pathogens. sore throat and fever were also more frequent among those positive for influenza compared to other or no/unknown pathogen. fever was the least frequent among influenza positive participants in the oldest age group. cough and less fever were predictive of rhinovirus, and cough, fever, and less shortness of breath were predictive of other pathogen. at least one pathogen was identified in 51% of all FRI/SARI cases. four triple and one quadruple coinfections were identified but not included in upper portion of the table. rhinovirus/adenovirus/RSV, rhinovirus/influenza A/CoV229E, rhinovirus/influenza A/CoVOC43, rhinovirus/influenza A/adenovirus/RSV. many respiratory etiology studies have been done outside the united states among patients with both severe, lower respiratory illness [24], [25], [26], as well as more mild, upper respiratory disease [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. viral etiologies vary across populations and regions, depending on factors such as population susceptibility, age, circulating strains, climate, comorbidities, and vaccination coverage. among 0\u20134 year olds in the border population (61%) compared to beneficiaries (39%) may be reflective of different exposures or differences in vaccination uptake. however, the overall frequency of influenza found between the two groups was similar. rhinoviruses were the most common respiratory pathogen identified. acute onset to predict flu have found them to have low sensitivity (20%) and high specificity (96%). sore throat and fever in participants less than 5 years had a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 54%. cough and fever among those greater than 5 years had a sensitivity of 80%. coinfection rates have varied across studies and are likely influenced by age, type of case definition used to enroll participants, and pathogens tested. previous studies with a median age of 2\u20133 years have found coinfections among SARI and acute respiratory tract infections of 17% and 19%, respectively. a third study among childcare attendees in the us found even higher coinfection rates of 47% [4] the timing of sample collection in the course of illness could impact whether or not viruses were identified by PCR. a broader understanding of seasonality, clinical presentation, demographics, and coinfection rates of pathogen specific respiratory diseases can improve diagnosis and treatment, by informing clinicians on appropriate antiviral and antibiotic treatment during the patient\u2019s visit.
