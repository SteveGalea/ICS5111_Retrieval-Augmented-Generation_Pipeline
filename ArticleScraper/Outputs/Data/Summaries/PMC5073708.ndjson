{"summary": "in 2014, tuberculosis for the first time surpassed HIV in total deaths per year with 1.5 million people dying from TB. it has a high mortality, with 30% of patients dying despite antituberculous chemotherapy. neurological deficits, including seizures, cognitive impairment, hydrocephalus and endocrinopathies, have been reported. medical history included migraines and hypothyroidism. he was feverish (temperature 39\u00b0C) and tachycardic (heart rate 120). he denied chest pain or palpitations. no rash, bruises or petechiae were evident. a bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for AAFB. a repeat lumbar puncture 5 days later showed persistent inflammatory components, WCC (14.3109/L), lymphocyte predominant (62%), red blood cells (724/L), low glucose (1.7 mmol/L) and elevated protein (4.13 g/L) serum sodium levels decreased over several days (119 mmol/L) no indication for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or an external ventricular drain. decadron 10 mg intravenous twice daily for management of basilar inflammation and raised intracranial pressure. lumbar puncture showed a WCC of 47 iu/L, an elevated total CSF protein 4.48 g/L (0.15\u20130.45) and lymphocytes 100%. no AAFB were isolated and there was no growth after 48 hours incubation. central nervous system (CNS) TB includes three clinical categories: TB meningitis, intracranial tuberculoma and spinal tuberculous arachnoiditis. rates of TB are highest in patients born in countries of high endemic rates, even after moving to areas with low endemic rates. tuberculomas, cerebral infarctions, hydrocephalus and arteritis result in the pathophysiological changes of cerebral oedema, meningeal irritation and raised intracranial pressure. miliary TB meningitis is pathologically characterised by the presence of thick basilar exudates predominantly present around the Circle of Willis. MRC staging of tuberculous meningitis Stage 1 Prodromal phase with no definite neurological symptoms Stage 2 Signs of meningeal irritation with slight or no clouding of sensorium and minor cranial nerve palsies Stage 3 Severe clouding of sensorium, convulsions, focal neurological deficit and involuntary movements The diagnosis of TBM can be challenging; maintaining a high degree of suspicion is vital in order to initiate antituberculous therapy promptly. studies performed in patients with pulmonary TB.8 Adenosine deaminase levels (ADA) are often raised in body fluids, including CSF, in patients with active TB. ingeal TB should be offered a treatment regimen initially lasting 12 months. the use of corticosteroids remains a controversial issue. most authorities recommend adjunctive corticosteroids in stage 2 and stage 3 disease. hydrocephalus, described by Udani and Dastur in 1970, is one of the most common complications of CNS meningitis. it occurs when the fourth ventricular outlets are blocked by the basal exudates and leptomeningeal inflammation. communicating hydrocephalus develops when either there is overproduction of CSF or there is an obstruction in the aqueduct. the \u2018Brain Infections Group\u2019 are aiming to assess the applicability of the Vietnam algorithm in the UK population. further randomised controlled trials are required to establish the best management. cornerstone of diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) most of the world\u2019s burden of TB is asymptomatic latent disease."}
