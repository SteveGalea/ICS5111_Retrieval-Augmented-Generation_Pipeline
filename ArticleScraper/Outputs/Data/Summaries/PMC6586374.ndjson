{"summary": "HA functions as a sialic acid (SIA)-binding and fusion protein. NA has receptor-destroying activity by cleaving SIAs from sialoglycans. the HA and NA protein functionalities are critical for host tropism. NA is a type II transmembrane protein that forms mushroom-shaped homotetramers. the active site is located in the globular head domain that is linked to the endodomain via a thin stalk. the catalytic and the framework residues are extremely conserved between avian and human IAVs. conservation of SIA-contact residues in the 2SBS of avian IAV is lost in viruses of the H9N2 subtype. conservation of the 2SBS of N2 is also lost in canine and not restored in swine viruses. it is tempting to hypothesize that the loss of a functional 2SBS in pandemic viruses is part of a required adaptation of the HA-NA balance. the HA-NA-receptor balance of viruses has a single amino acid substitution in the 2SBS. we first performed a detailed analysis of the functional importance of the 2SBS in N2 for substrate binding and cleavage by comparing NA of the pandemic H2N2 virus from 1957 with an avian-like NA. a SIA-contact residue in the 2SBS is mutated compared to the avian consensus sequence (S367N, S3 Fig) hN2 and aN2 displayed similar specific activities when using the monovalent MUNANA substrate (Fig 1A, S4A and S4B Fig) similar results were obtained previously using membrane-associated proteins. MAL I (Maackia Amurensis Lectin I) and SNA (Sambucus Nigra Lectin) specifically bind 2,3- or 2,6-linked SIAs. aN2 was more active than hN2 using fetuin, containing 2,3- and 2,6-linked SIAs. both hN2 and aN2 preferred cleavage over 2,6-linked SIAs. specific activity of hN2 and aN2 is normalized to the specific activity as determined for each protein by the Fetuin-ECA combination. Mean values and standard deviation from two independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. cleavage of the small SIA moiety is not detected directly by BLI. hN2 and aN2 more efficiently cleaved 3\u2019SLNLN over 6\u2019SLNLN. restoration of the 2SBS in hN2 to avian consensus sequence results in enhanced cleavage of substrates containing 2,3-linked SIAs. no specific binding to synthetic 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialoglycans by BLI could be observed for the recombinant soluble N2 proteins. this could be due to low affinity of the 2SBS. the observed 2,3-linked SIA specificity is in accordance with enhanced cleavage of substrates containing 2,3-linked SIAs. VLPs containing full length hN2 and aN2 were analysed for their ability to bind 3\u2019SLNLN (A) or 6\u2019SLNLN (B) in the absence of OC using the 2SBS. similar amounts of N2 were applied based on the MUNANA assay as hN2 and aN2 proteins have identical enzymatic activities. hH3hN2 virus at 24 and 48 h post infection when vero cells were used. no significant differences were observed for replication in MDCK cells. absence of functional 2SBS in N2 may affect replication kinetics in a cell type-dependent manner. hH3aN2 virus containing a functional 2SBS showed a higher initial binding-rate ratio 3\u2019SLNLN/6\u2019SLNLN than hH3hN2. two recombinant soluble glycoproteins containing mainly N-linked glycans were used in BLI. number of hH3hN2 and aH3aN2 virus particles were analysed. initial binding rates (vobs = dB/dT) were determined. identical number of aH3hN2 and aH3aN2 virus particles were analysed. recombinant viruses containing 7 amino acid substitutions in the HA. these substitutions reverted the HA back to the avian-like aH3. resulting viruses are referred to as aH3hN2 and aH3aN2. a functional 2SBS enhanced binding to 3\u2019SLNLN. but not 6\u2019SLNLN when combined with aH3. however, a functional 2SBS site in NA contributes to virion-receptor binding in a HA- and receptor-dependent manner. a functional 2SBS site in NA contributes to virion-receptor binding. numbers of particles in virus preparations were determined using nanoparticle tracking analysis (Nanosight NS300); the NA activity in these preparations was analysed by MUNANA assay. dilutions corresponding to half-maximum lectin binding were determined. both receptor binding via HA and the 2SBS of NA contribute to the sialidase specific activity of virus particles. preliminary experiments showed inefficient cleavage of the synthetic glycans by the recombinant viruses. no appreciable binding of hH3-containing viruses could be detected. virus self-elution is not observed when NA activity is blocked by OC. aH3aN2 and aH3aN2 eluted faster from the sensors than aH3aN2. aH3aN2 eluted faster from glycophorin A than from aH3aN2. lution from a receptor-coated surface was also shown to depend on the identity of the HA and the glycoprotein receptor used. the HK N2 protein was 4\u20135 fold less active than hN2 both on the monovalent substrate MUNANA and the multivalent substrate fetuin. HK N2 protein displayed 2-fold lower NA activity per virus particle than the hH3hN2 virus. the time required for 50% self-elution of virions from the multivalent receptor LAMP1 was 2-fold longer for HK H3N2 than for hH3hN2. hN2 from 1957 and 1968 HK N2 differ to similar extent in their catalytic activity. hH3hN2 and HK H3N2 virus particles were bound to similar levels to LAMP1 in the presence of OC. the 2SBS in N2 is an important determinant of NA catalytic activity. soluble proteins accurately reflects the activity of their membrane-bound counterparts. aN2 was more active than hN2 using fetuin, containing 2,3- and 2,6-linked SIAs. aN2 was more active than hN2 using fetuin. 2 preferred cleavage of 2,3- (determined with fetuin-MAL I) over 2,6-(determined with fetuin-SNA) linked SIAs. specific activities were higher when determined with the fetuin-ECA than with transferrin-ECA combination as fetuin, but not transferrin, contains 2,3-linked SIAs. an avian-like 2SBS in N2 contributes to cleavage of the sialoglycoprotein fetuin containing 2,3- and 2,6-linked SIAs. the results show that an avian-like 2SBS in N2 contributes to cleavage of the sialoglycoprotein fetuin containing 2,3- and 2,6-linked SIAs. restoration of the 2SBS in hN2 to the avian consensus sequence results in enhanced cleavage of substrates containing 2,3-linked SIAs. aN2 proteins prefer binding to 2,3- over 2,6-linked SIAs via their 2SBS. aN2 VLPs containing full length hN2 and aN2 were analysed for their ability to bind 3\u2019SLNLN (A) or 6\u2019SLNLN (B) in the absence of OC. aN2 has much higher lectin activity than hN2 due to the presence of a functional 2SBS. demic virus A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) produced large and clear plaques on vero cells compared to smaller, fuzzy plaques of the hH3aN2 virus with a functional 2SBS. hH3aN2 reached lower titres than the hH3hN2 virus at 24 and 48 h post infection when vero cells were used. hH3aN2 virus containing a functional 2SBS showed a higher initial binding rate 3\u2019SLNLN/6\u2019SLNLN than hH3hN2. two recombinant glycoproteins containing mainly N-linked glycans were used in BLI as recently described for recombinant fetuin. receptors found on cells (LAMP1) and on mucins (glycophorin A) that are rich in N- or O-glycans. analysis of the glycans by lectin binding using BLI confirmed the presence of sialylated N-linked glycans on both proteins. only glycophorin A was shown to contain sialylated O-glycans. the HA of the 1968 pandemic h3N2 virus prefers binding to terminal 2,6-linked SIAs [56, 57]. the resulting viruses are referred to as aH3hN2 and aH3aN2 depending on the absence and presence of the functional 2SBS. hH3 bound better than aH3 to transferrin, which only contains 2,6-linked sialoglycans. differences in virus replication were smaller for MDCK than for vero cells. a functional 2SBS enhanced binding to 3\u2019SLNLN but not 6\u2019SLNLN when N2 was combined with aH3. hH3hN2 virus was less active compared to viruses containing aN2 and/or aH3. cleavage of 2,6-linked SIA found on transferrin was less efficient. virus preparations were normalized based on their MUNANA activity. hH3hN2 and aH3aN2 and aH3aN2 virus particles were analysed for their ability to bind LAMP1 (C) or glycophorin A (F) in the absence of OC using BLI. OC was removed by three repeated washes and virion self-elution in the absence of OC was monitored. viruses with aN2 proteins eluted faster from the sensors than viruses with hN2 and aH3aN2 with aH3hN2. earlier bending and smaller area under the curve observed for aH3aN2 is indicative of more efficient cleavage of the sensor-attached receptors by this virus. negative area of self-elution for aH3hN2 reflects reduced NA activity of this virus compared to aH3aN2. hH3aN2 self-elution was faster from glycophorin A than from LAMP1 for aH3-containing viruses, the opposite was observed. /68 contains five mutations (S370L, N400S, N401D, W403R, P432K) in the 2SBS compared to the avian consensus sequence. HK N2 protein was 4\u20135 fold less active than hN2 both on the monovalent substrate MUNANA and the multivalent substrate fetuin. HK H3N2 virus, containing the 1968 HK N2 protein, displayed 2-fold lower NA activity per virus particle than asterisks indicate SIA-contact residues in the 430 loop of N9. the orange asterisk indicates an additional SIA-contact residue in the 430 loop. hN2 and HK N2 recombinant soluble proteins are shown in red. a functional 2SBS in N2 was shown to prefer binding to 2,3-linked sialosides. it enhances catalytic activity against substrates carrying 2,6-linked SIAs. the contribution of the 2SBS to the HA-NA-receptor balance of viruses was shown to be receptor- and HA protein-dependent. the specificity of the N2 2SBS correlates with the enhanced cleavage of substrates carrying 2,3-linked SIAs. the 2SBS enhances catalytic activity by bringing sialosides on multivalent substrates close to the catalytic site. this suggests that the enhanced cleavage of SIAs not necessarily matches the specificity of the 2SBS. a red blood cell binding assay was employed in which desialylation of erythrocytes was followed by resialylation using 2,3- or 2,6-sialyltransferases. a higher receptor density on erythrocytes compared to the BLI sensor surface might allow for binding of 2,6-linked SIAs. the ability of the 2SBS to bind human-type receptors to some extent is also suggested by the modestly increased a functional 2SBS in NA can also contribute to virion-receptor binding. a complex interplay between HA, NA and receptor determines the attachment of virus particles to and release from a receptor-containing surface. this HA-NA-receptor balance can be experimentally determined using kinetic BLI assays by analysis of virus binding in the absence or presence of NA inhibitors. the 2SBS, the 1968 N2 protein contains five mutations in this site. the accumulation of several mutations in the 2SBS was found to have no further negative effects on the enzyme-enhancing function of 2SBS. this is compared to a single mutation of a SIA contact residues in the 2SBS of an early pandemic virus from 1957. mutations in the 2SBS of avian viruses may be indicative of an increased potential of avian viruses to cross the host species barrier. avian viruses display a striking parallel with changes observed in the receptor-binding sites of HA and NA of avian-origin pandemic viruses. cloned into pFRT expression plasmid in frame with sequences encoding a signal sequence derived from Gaussia luciferase, a Strep tag and a Tetrabrachion tetramerization domain. corresponding full length (FL) NA-coding plasmids were generated by replacement of non-NA coding sequences by sequences encoding the NA transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of N2 soluble NA proteins were quantified by quantitative densitometry of gels containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards. cells were transfected with full-length NA constructs to obtain membrane vesicles. to this end, cells were vesiculated as described previously [26, 48] amino acid substitutions in HA revert the HA back to the avian consensus sequence [56] combined with the N2 protein of A/Singapore/1/1957 (H2N2) with (aH3aN2) or without (aH3hN2) the N367S substitution. UV inactivation did not affect the enzymatic activity of NA as determined with the MUNANA assay. Cleavage of SIAs from fetuin and transferrin was quantified by analysing the increase (PNA and ECA) in binding of different lectins. binding of different lectins was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. cell layers were incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the influenza A virus nucleoprotein for 1 hour followed by another 1 hour incubation with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibodies. dilution produced from 30 to 300 infected cells per well and recalculated into numbers of focus forming units (FFU) per ml of original undiluted virus suspensions. all experiments were carried out in Dulbecco's PBS with calcium and Magnesium (Lonza) at 30\u00b0C and with sensors shaking at 1000 rpm. synthetic glycans were synthesized at the Department of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Utrecht, the Netherlands. nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) NTA measurements were performed using a nanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern) the UV-inactivated virus preparations were diluted with PBS to reach a particle concentration suitable for analysis with NTA. human-codon optimized cDNAs encoding FL H3 or the H3 ectodomain of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) were cloned in pCD5 expression vectors similarly as described previously [65] an expression vector encoding BirA ligase was cotransfected with the LAMP1- and glycophorin A-coding vectors. VLPs and membrane vesicle preparations were purified using capto core 700 beads. the amount of NA protein in the VLPs and vesicle preparations was determined using the MUNANA assay described below. also the generation of hH3hN2 and hH3aN2 viruses has been described before [57] UV inactivation did not affect the enzymatic activity of NA as determined with the MUNANA assay. enzymatic activity of the NA proteins towards multivalent glycoprotein substrates was analysed using a previously described enzyme-linked lectin assay. ase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB, bioFX) in an ELISA reader EL-808 (BioTEK) by measuring the optical density at 450 nm. the data were fitted by non-linear regression using the Prism 6.05 software (GraphPad) two replicate cultures of vero or MDCK cells in 12-well plates were infected with each virus at MOI 0.001 (Vero cells) or 0.0001 (MDCK cells) inocula were removed 1 hpi, fresh medium was added, and cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C. synthetic glycans were synthesized at the Department of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Utrecht, the Netherlands. the sensors loaded with synthetic glycans were incubated in 100 l buffer containing 4 g recombinant soluble aN2 or hN2 in the absence or presence of 8 g ECA. as controls, sensors were also incubated with ECA in the absence of 8 g ECA. each virus preparation was analysed twice and mean values were used. NTA measurements were validated by analysis of virus stocks quantified earlier by silver staining of viral proteins. results obtained via both methods correlated well (less than 25% deviation) avian H9N2 viruses were mainly (>80%) found in Galliformes species. avian HxN2 viruses were isolated mainly from non-Galliformes species. phylogenetic analysis shows that human H2N2 viruses either have a mutated SIA-contact residue at position 367 or at position 370. Mutations that became fixed along the trunk of the tree are indicated. SIA-contact residues in the N2 protein are indicated by the red shading. enzymatic activity of hN2 and aN2 proteins for a monovalent substrate was determined. vage of SIAs as indicated by reduced binding of ECA. the same was observed for MAL I (and SNA) which binds to sialylated glycans. data were fitted by non-linear regression using the Prism 6.05 software. Plaque assays were performed for hH3hN2 (A) and hH3aN2 (B) viruses using Vero cells followed by crystal violet dye staining. glycophorin A and Lamp1 were analysed for their attached glycans using lectin binding. soluble vesicles obtained after co-expression of full length hH3 and hN2 or aH3 and hN2 were analysed for their ability to bind 3\u2019SLNLN (D) or 6\u2019SLNLN (E) in the presence of OC. a strepMabClassic-HRP and rabbit-mouse-HRP were used in the fetuin-(B) or transferrin-(C) Stars depict P values calculated using one-way ANOVA (*, P0.05)"}
