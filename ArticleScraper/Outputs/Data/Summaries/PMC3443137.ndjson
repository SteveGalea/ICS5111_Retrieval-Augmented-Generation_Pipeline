{"summary": "C5 mutant expresses active TK in infected cells. we engineered a FLAG-tag in a virus containing the C5 mutation (C5-FLAG) and its WT parental virus, KOS (WT-FLAG) the tag did not affect the mutant\u2019s TK activity. the bars represent tk coding sequence, with the open segments representing the WT TK reading frame. the solid gray segments, the position of the C-chord and the striped segments, the reading frame generated by the one base deletion (out-of-frame) lysates and dilutions of cells analyzed are indicated at the top of the panel. to confirm expression of full-length TK by the C5 mutant, we performed Western blot analysis of cell lysates using a polyclonal anti-TK antibody. this approach also detected full-length TK from C5-FLAG. mRNA spiked into mutant mRNA sample at ratios of 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2%. the method was more than sensitive enough to detect C6 transcripts. neither reversion nor transcription errors likely account for the level of full-length TK expressed by the mutant. mutant viruses engineered a second mutant (C5stop2) with a stop codon in the TK reading frame at the end of the C-chord. if frameshifting occurred before the stop codon, then no TK would be made. the two tags enabled detection of full-length TK and all polypeptides that include the N-terminal portion of TK. frame of tk mRNA (boldface) of C5 and two stop codon mutants (names to the left) are presented in the primary reading frame. underlined are the positions of the introduced stop codons. white dots or absence of dots indicate undetectable TK activity. tk mRNA level in HA-WT-FLAG\u2013infected cells was similar to that in WT-FLAG\u2013infected cells. the levels of full-length TK and ICP8 in HA-C5-FLAG\u2013infected cells decreased slightly from 10 to 18 hpi. the levels of the out-of-frame product decreased slightly from 10 to 18 hpi. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, increased the level of the out-of-frame product by threefold in mutant-infected cells. translation of the out-of-frame product in C5 mutant-infected cells is 2\u20133% that of full-length TK in WT-infected cells. cells were infected with HA-C5-FLAG or HA-WT-FLAG. MG132 (10 M; +) or DMSO () was added at 3 hpi. at 10 hpi, cells were analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-ICP8 antibodies. mutant virus, HA-C5Stop3-FLAG, expressed similar levels of tk mRNA. HA-C5Stop3-FLAG expressed >10-fold more out-of-frame product. but >10-fold less full-length TK compared with HA-C5-FLAG. 5-FLAG and HA-C5stop3-FLAG viruses and dilution series of the lysate using anti-HA (Upper) and anti-ICP8 (Lower) antibodies. dilutions are indicated at the top of each panel. nonstop mRNA Stimulates frameshifting on a Canonical Slippery Sequence. pC5-stop and pHIV-stop plasmids expressed much less full-length TK and much more out-of-frame polypeptide. stop codons greatly reduced frameshifting efficiency in both cases. tagged protein was present at 0.1% of the level of TK found in infected cells. this product was present at 0.1% of the level of TK found in cells. similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments. the arrow shows where a frameshifting event could occur to re-enter the WT TK reading frame. the positions of FLAG tags at the C termini are indicated. the molecular mass was derived from the prediction that translation terminates near the start of the poly(A) tail. C5 expressed full-length TK at 0.1% of the level in WT-infected cells. this is similar to that found in G8-infected cells (12), which correlate with C5 and G8 expressing similar amounts of active TK in plaque autoradiography assays. s as a function of the percent of WT mRNA spiked into the C5 mRNA samples displayed a straight line with a slope close to 1. the method was more than sensitive enough to detect C6 transcripts that could account for the amount of full-length TK found in C5-infected cells. the tags enabled detection of full-length TK and all polypeptides that include the N-terminal portion of TK. the tags did not affect TK activity (12) and like C5-FLAG, the doubly tagged C5 mutant expressed full-length TK at a level about 0.1% of HA-WT-FLAG. the C5stop2 mutation (HA-C5Stop2-FLAG) eliminated both TK expression and TK activity. white dots or absence of dots indicate undetectable TK activity. white dots or absence of dots indicate undetectable TK activity. dilutions used are indicated at the top of the panel. levels of full-length TK and ICP8 increased until about 10 h postinfection. levels of the out-of-frame TK polypeptide decreased slightly from 10 to 18 hpi. protein degradation contributed less than fourfold to the reduction in the level of the out-of-frame product. full-length TK is synthesized in C5-infected cells at 0.1% that in WT-infected cells. analysis of stability of out-of-frame polypeptide in 143B cells. cells were analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA and anti-ICP8 antibodies. the viruses assayed and the dilutions made from HA-WT-FLAG lysate obtained in the absence of MG132 are indicated at the top. HA-C5Stop3-FLAG expressed >10-fold more out-of-frame product. but >10-fold less full-length TK compared with HA-C5-FLAG. stop codon reduced frameshifting efficiency by >100-fold. this result strongly suggests that nonstop mRNA greatly stimulates frameshifting on C5 tk mRNA. plasmid-expressed TK was either unmutated (pWT), the C5 mutant (pC5-NS) or a mutant in which the C-chord was replaced by a canonical slippery sequence from HIV. nonsense codon found in the C5Stop3 virus (pC5-Stop and pHIV-Stop, respectively) nonstop mRNAs generally promote frameshifting from transfected tk genes. the results suggest that nonstop mRNAs promote frameshifting. ribosomes shift reading frame somewhere between a site upstream of the C-chord and the last C of the C-chord. a stop codon 30 bases downstream of the C-chord in the TK reading frame also eliminates TK activity (20). a conservative interpretation would be that frameshifting occurs between the locations of the C5stop1 mutation and this latter stop codon. more work is needed to elucidate the sequence dependence and molecular mechanisms of frameshifting in or near the C-chord. nonstop mRNAs usually arise as errors during DNA replication or transcription. in eukaryotes, nonstop mRNAs are poorly translated, although in yeast and in human mitochondria, they are also rapidly degraded. ribosomes on the poly(A) tail of C5 tk mRNA slow down the movement of upstream ribosomes, resulting in (i) greatly reduced synthesis of the out-of-frame polypeptide. other known stimulators of ribosomal frameshifting, such as stem-loops or pseudoknots, can cause pausing. the low level of TK expressed by this mutant contributes to its ability to cause disease, but is insufficient to activate ACV. the low level of TK expression may combine with other mechanisms by which HSV tk mutations can confer drug resistance but still retain pathogenicity. frameshifting occurs between the locations of the C5stop1 mutation and this latter stop codon. however, there is no sequence that corresponds to the canonical X XXY YYZ slippery sequence that promotes tandem 1 slippage of peptidyl and aminoacyl tRNAs. the event may entail a 1 shift of a single tRNA rather than a tandem shift of both tRNAs. our finding of poor translation without RNA degradation is consistent with those in other mammalian systems (22, 30, 31) however, unlike Akimitsu et al. (22), who described a smear of products from translation of a nonstop mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with sizes consistent with multiple premature dissociation events from the body of the mRNA, we found a tight distribution of product sizes expressed from C5 mRNA in infected cells the same mechanism that greatly reduces synthesis of the out-of-frame polypeptide would greatly increase synthesis of full-length TK. however, as piled-up ribosomes generally inhibit translation, a more complicated mechanism may be involved. mutant virus, and alleles in other loci compensate for loss of TK. ribosomal frameshifting stimulated by nonstop mRNA may occur more generally. transcripts thought to be noncoding or monocistronic may express low, but biologically relevant levels of novel polypeptides. 293T cells were maintained as for 143B cells. tk mutant plasmids and viruses were constructed as previously described. tk mutant plasmids and viruses were constructed as previously described."}
