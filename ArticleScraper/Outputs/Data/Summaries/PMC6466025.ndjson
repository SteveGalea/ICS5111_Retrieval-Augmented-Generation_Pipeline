{"summary": "bats are the only volant mammals, but flight has been proposed to contribute to the ability of bats to function as natural reservoirs. the aerobic demands of flight experienced by bats is higher than the aerobic demands of other terrestrial mammals experienced during aerobic exertion [14] autophagy pathway recycles long-lived proteins, misfolded proteins, and damaged organelles during times of nutrient depletion. pathogen-recognition receptors can activate distinct autophagic processes as part of an intrinsic immune response [32,33,34] if bats have evolved mechanisms to dampen cellular damage caused by the by-products of heightened aerobic respiration, then these same proteostatic mechanisms might also function as anti-viral defenses. for this study we chose to use Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a neurotropic rabies-related virus that naturally infects black flying foxes. the basal level of autophagy was significantly higher than the levels of autophagy quantified in the human cell line used for comparative purposes. we observed that ABLV infection activated the autophagy pathway in a dose-dependent manner, in both black flying fox- and human-derived cells. ABLV replication decreased in both black flying fox and human cells. human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T (ATCC\u00ae CRL-3216TM) and mouse Neuro-2a (ATCC\u00ae CCL-131TM) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in DMEM-10 complete media. the total recombinant plasmid DNA (4 g) was mixed with 10 L lipofectamine LTX\u00ae. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM-10 complete media. cell culture supernatant was passaged to fresh HEK293T cells. atants were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris. rABLV-GFP was used to count the number of fluorescent plaques. FITC-conjugated anti-Rabies monoclonal globulin was used to quantify wt-ABLV titers. anti-LC3B polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-p62 polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-NDP52 polyclonal antibody (Aviva Systems Biology; San Diego, CA, USA), anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Abcam; Cambridge, UK), anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody (Abcam); and anti-Turbo GFP polyclonal antibody (Evrogen) rapamycin (RAPA; Sigma-Aldrich), small molecule enhancer of autophagy-28 (SMER; TOCRIS; Bristol, UK), or NVP BEZ235 (BEZ; Selleck Chemicals; Houston, TX, USA) were added to the wells and incubated with the ABLV-infected cell culture for 24 h. primary PaBr cells were maintained in DMEM/Nutrient F-12 Ham media. a human neuroblastoma cell line (NBF-L) was obtained from Dr. Aviva Symes (Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA) rABLV-GFP was cloned into the rABLV anti-genome plasmid between the ABLV glycoprotein (G) and large RNA polymerase (L) genes. the total recombinant plasmid DNA (4 g) was mixed with 10 L lipofectamine LTX\u00ae in OPTI-MEM (Gibco) cell culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged to collect floating cells, then mixed with adherent cells, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. cells were infected with rABLV-GFP or wt-ABLV at the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOI). whole cell protein lysates were processed at indicated hours post-infection. cells were normalized to 15 g and loaded into 4\u201312% Bis-Tris protein gel. protein gels were transferred to PVDF membranes. anti-Rabies virus N protein polyclonal rabbit serum was provided. atant and cells were collected, centrifuged for 5 min, 2500 g, resuspended in 1 mL PBS, and dyed with LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min. cells were then pelted and washed with PBS. al globulin (Fujirebio Diagnostics) was used to quantify wt-ABLV titers after BEZ treatments. a positive stain was confirmed using the paKiT cell line. ABLV replication in black flying fox and human cell lines is reduced. cells were incubated with rABLV-GFP (MOI 1) then after two hours the virus inoculated cell culture supernatant was replaced with fresh cell culture media. rABLV-GFP titers were quantified from both infected black flying cell lines compared to human cell lines at equivalent hpi. the conditions of rABLV-GFP infection were modified to promote infection of close to 100% of the cells. rABLV-GFP infection increased cell death in human and black flying fox cells in a dose-dependent manner. the percentage of GFP positive black flying fox cells was also dose-dependent. lower vGFP in paBrH cells suggested an intrinsic mechanism restricted production of ABLV encoded proteins (e.g., GFP) or replication. ABLV infection induces less cell death in black flying fox cells. a hallmark feature of autophagy induction is the cleavage and lipidation of the cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B-I) to autophagosomal-associated LC3B-phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3B-II) functional human and black flying fox LC3B proteins are identical in amino acid sequence after post-translational cleavage. LC3B-II is expressed as a percentage of total LC3B. paBrH and NBF-L cells were infected with rABLV-GFP. LC3B-II was again dependent on a high virus dose, MOI 10. treatment with BAFA1 increased LC3B-II, however the levels of LC3B-II remained statistically equivalent regardless of ABLV MOI. ABLV does not inhibit autophagic flux after ABLV infection. p62 and NDP52 are associated with selective autophagy. p62 and NDP52 are associated with selective autophagy. a fold decrease of p62 and NDP52 48 hpi, we concluded that ABLV alone was not inhibiting autophagic flux. together, increased LC3B-II and decreased p62/NDP52 protein levels. ABLV infection does not inhibit autophagic flux. rABLV-GFP infected black flying fox cell lines, PaBrH and PaKiT, were treated with RAPA or SMER during ABLV infection. treatment with either RAPA or SMER induced autophagy in paKiT cells. cells were treated with RAPA (2 M) and SMER (50 M) for 24 h. fold change in ABLV N, P, and vGFP proteins (-actin-normalized) from PaBrH cell lysates. ABLV protein levels in paKiT cells, infected and treated with RAPA and SMER, were examined by western blot. vGFP fold decrease caused by RAPA and SMER stands in contrast to fold changes in N and P proteins. autophagy activation through pharmacological modulators reduced ABLV replication in a human neuroblastoma cell line. infected neurons cannot rely on the anti-viral effects of IFN-induced cell death to control viral infection and risk potential damage to the central nervous system. LC3B protein in lysates from NBF-L cells were treated with indicated concentrations of BEZ for 4 h. no significant differences of quantified spontaneous cytotoxicity between DMSO or BEZ treatments. fold decreases in wt-ABLV N and P protein from cells treated in (A) fold decreases. a human embryonic kidney cell line was included for comparative purposes. a human embryonic kidney cell line was included for comparative purposes. ABLV replication is reduced in black flying fox cells. protein levels\u2014including nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and the virus-expressed GFP (vGFP)\u2014revealed lower amounts of structural and non-structural ABLV proteins in black flying fox cells. rABLV-GFP infection increased cell death in human and black flying fox cells in a dose-dependent manner. a significantly lower vGFP median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was quantified in black flying fox cells compared to a human cell line 96 hpi at both MOI 1 and 10. lower vGFP in paBrH cells suggested an intrinsic mechanism restricted production of ABLV encoded proteins (e.g., GFP) or replication. autophagy functions as an anti-viral mechanism during vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection of a human neuroblastoma cell line was shown to activate the autophagy pathway. a hallmark feature of autophagy induction is the cleavage and lipidation of the cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B-I) LC3B-II was significantly higher in both PaBrH and PaKiT compared to NBF-L. black flying fox cells maintained a higher basal level of autophagic flux. ABLV infection activates autophagy. paBrH cells showed a significant percentage of LC3B-II conversion when infected with a MOI 10 at 24 and 48 hpi. the NBF-L cells had a significant percentage of LC3B-II when infected for 48 hpi (MOI 1.0 and 10). ABLV does not inhibit autophagic flux by blocking fusion of autophagosomes with autolysosomes. p62 and NDP52 are associated with selective autophagy. a mean fold decrease in p62 was observed at both 48 and 72 hpi. p62 and NDP52 fold-changes between ABLV alone and ABLV plus BAFA1 were insignificant. increased LC3B-II and decreased p62/NDP52 protein levels in black flying fox cells further demonstrated that ABLV infection induced the autophagy pathway. rABLV-GFP infected black flying fox cell lines, PaBrH and PaKiT, were treated with RAPA or SMER during ABLV infection. treatment with either RAPA or SMER induced autophagy in paKiT cells. paKiT cells stained with CYTO-ID\u00ae were treated with RAPA (2 M) and SMER (50 M) for h indicated. fold change in rABLV-GFP titers (pfu/mL) fold change from PaBrH, PaKiT, and NBF-L cell culture supernatants collected 48 hpi (MOI 1.0) ABLV protein levels in bat PaKiT cells were examined by western blot. Neither treatment with RAPA or SMER resulted in degradation of virus proteins. autophagy activation through pharmacological modulators reduced ABLV replication and protein expression in a human neuroblastoma cell line (NBF-L) infected neurons cannot rely on the anti-viral effects of IFN-induced cell death to control viral infection. clinical trials as a potential anti-cancer therapy were discontinued due to adverse toxicities. results suggest potent inducers like BEZ may be promising additional therapeutics to prevent lethality following lyssavirus exposure. the autophagy pathway is a constant target of virus antagonism and evasion. this is the first experimental attempt to study the autophagy pathway during a virus infection in cell lines derived from a bat species. a related rhabdovirus induces autophagy through G protein engagement independent of virus replication. autophagy can promote survival under stressful conditions (e.g., nutrient deprivation) or itself act as a mechanism of programmed cell death if left unchecked. tools will facilitate opportunities to ask if autophagic response to ABLV can be generalized to other bat-borne viruses. the interactions between natural reservoirs hosts and viruses require that (a) the host is readily infected and (b) the virus needs to persist in the host long enough to be transmitted to another susceptible new cell lines have recently been derived from additional bat species. comparisons with rodent cell lines will strengthen whether in vitro responses to virus infection are unique to bats or shared co-adaptations."}
