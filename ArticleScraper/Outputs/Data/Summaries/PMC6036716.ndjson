{"summary": "mutations in proto-oncogenes occur by point mutations, localized reduplication, or chromosomal translocation. an oncogene disrupts a cell's normal activity and can lead to uncontrolled cell division, and ultimately cancerous cells. gene expression analysis also allows for biomarker and gene signature discovery. qRT-PCR Principle and Clinical Assay Principle PCR was first invented by Kary Mullis and his colleagues from the Cetus Corporation when they exploited the ability of Taq polymerase from The. reverse transcription PCR is first reverse transcribed into cDNA and then amplified. first generation of RT-PCR uses band's intensity in gel for a semi-quantification. qRT-PCR counts how many reaction cycles are used to reach an amplification slope status in real-time. primers spanning exon-exon junctions allow for strict amplification of mRNA samples. mRNA contains alternating regions of exons and introns while mRNA lacks introns. qRT-PCR Taq polymerase enzyme and mixture reaction solutions. the standard curve method involves comparing the Ct values of interest with a control, such as a non-treated or normal sample, which are both normalized to a housekeeping gene. biostatistical analysis can also be done where the final gene expression values are log-transformed for a normalized or symmetrical data distribution. qRT-PCR aided in the identification of 8 genes of interest. qRT-PCR has also been successfully applied in non-small cell lung cancer studies to establish a 14-gene signature with 11 cancer-related target genes and 3 reference genes. Agilent produces commercial 2-channel arrays.24,25 in 1-channel array. oligonucleotide probes are synthesized on the surface of slide. the fluorescent labeled sample cDNAs are then hybridized on the array. gene expression classifier measures expression of 167 gene transcripts. it is a 70-gene signature derived from 5000 expressed genes. it predicts disease-free survival in lymph-node negative patients. nCounter is a variation on the DNA Microarray. it employs two 50 base probes per mRNA that hybridize in solution. the digital Analyzer senses the hybridized colour-coded probes. two kits of reagents are required: the CodeSet and the Master Kit. the codeSet has customized or pre-designed probes. the master kit contains ready-to-load consumables and reagents. the assay included multiple published gene signatures for colon cancer prognosis and several candidate genes elements from ongoing studies in intestinal stem cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) the nanoString nCounter technology was chosen to assay RNA extracted from FFPE samples from stage II gastric cancer patients. the mRNA transcript is fragmented and primers are allowed to randomly anneal to mRNA segments. first and second strand cDNA synthesis from reverse transcription of the mRNA fragments result in double-stranded cDNA. the ends of the fragments are tagged with a phosphate group and poly(A) tail. read alignment poses as a complication for RNA-Seq. reads are compared to a reference genome where exon-exon splice junctions exist in RNA transcripts but not DNA transcripts. splice junctions appearing in one or more tags are further studied for their quality and diversity of alignments. one study used NGS to analyze 21-genes, including the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes, associated with breast and ovarian cancers. one study used NGS to determine the instability and examine the pathogenic properties of and clinical impact resulting from the large number of somatic microdeletions. fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Principle FISH was developed in the early 1980s. it applies fluorescent-labeled short DNA probes that hybridize to target DNA or RNA sequences in situ and fluorescence microscopy to localize and detect targets in tissue slides. the application of FISH is growing rapidly in genomics, cytogenetics, prenatal research, prenatal research, prenatal research, tumor biology, radiation labels, gene mapping, gene amplification, and basic biomedical research. RNA FISH is a valid platform for testing predictive biomarkers for patient selection. ISH technique was developed that enables miRNA visualization in FFPE tissues. they tested two skin tumors, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) to visualize differentially expressed miRNAs in FFPE tumor samples. a single set of tissues with associated clinical data can be used in various and unlimited studies. the steps generally required to prepare a TMA are: preparation of a high-adhesive glass slide; acquisition of donor tissues; tissue core mapping and arrangement; sampling, sectioning, and transferring of the tissue donor cores. a tissue arrayer removes cores from the donor block and places them in the recipient block. the tissue sections can first be analyzed via H and E staining or immunofluorescent ISH. an automated scanning system can be purchased to scan and analyze prepared TMA slides. a tissue microarray was constructed using 2317 samples from 1842 patients to study the outcome of the amplification of CCNE and its protein expression. four independent TMAs were used to analyze the prognostic markers in impacting molecular changes and clinical endpoints in 553 breast carcinomas. strong correlation was found between cDNA microarrays and mRNA. over-expression in hormone-refractory CWR22R xenografts of S100P was seen while CRYM and LMO4 were down-regulated. qRT-PCR counts how many reaction cycles are used to reach an amplification slope status in real-time. the Ct levels are inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample. a primer pair anneals to the target cDNA template and a DNA polymerase extend from the ligated primers. two major qRT-PCR systems are TaqMan and SYBR green. a specific probe labeled with a fluorescent reporter is bound on the cDNA of the target RNA. the sensitivity of a TaqMan assay is one of its major advantages. cancer clinical ThyraMIRTM is a commercial RT-PCR assay. it is used for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, one of the most common cancer types, based on the evaluation of expression of 10 miRNAs. a 21-gene signature of 5 reference genes and 16 cancer-related genes involved in tumor proliferation, invasion, and estrogen signaling was established. ine decarboxylase antizyme, adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase, growth arrest specific gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and clusterin. qRT-PCR has also been successfully applied in non-small cell lung cancer studies to establish a 14-gene signature with 11 cancer-related target genes and 3 primer design Primers are required in qRT-PCR analysis to anneal to a specific portion of the mRNA so that the DNA polymerase can extend from the primer. a range of Tms have been reported, with 58 60 C considered stringent. the fluorescent dye SYBR Green qRT-PCR binds with the amplified double stranded DNA and emits an intense green light. the PCR products can be measured by detecting the bound SYBR Green fluorescence. this method is inexpensive, easy to use, and can be used for multiplex gene targets. qRT-PCR has been successfully applied in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) studies to establish a 14-gene signature with 11 cancer-related target genes and 3 reference genes. technique similar to Oncotype DX has also been applied in colon cancers. 2-channel and 1-channel arrays are made by spotting with cDNA fragments or oligonucleotide probes (Agilent) the treated sample's cDNA and the normal control sample's cDNA are labeled by two types of fluorescence(2-channel) the mixture of treated and control samples are then hybridized on array and the absolute intensity of hybridization signal is measured. a special panel of gene expression detection is required to remove the variation in an experiment that affects gene expression levels. the raw data is first analyzed by subtracting the background fluorescence from the fluorescence of each spot. some genes previously thought to be ideal references have been shown to vary in expression level, depending on circumstances such as a donor's biological state. four independent subtypes were identified and statistics and bioinformatics were used to determine subtype survival outcome, clinical covariates, and biological processes. it was determined that the ZAP-70 expression level, which is high in T-cells, can be used to identify patients requiring certain treatments by assigning patients with CLL to the correct IgVH mutational subtype. Agilent produces commercial 2-channel arrays.24,25 in 1-channel array. oligonucleotide probes are synthesized on the surface of slide. the fluorescent labeled sample cDNAs are then hybridized on array. cancer clinical Afirma\u00ae is a gene expression classifier. it measures the expression of 167 gene transcripts. it classifies aspirated material from thyroid nodules as either benign or suspicious. the DASLTM (cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation) assay was established using 16 FFPE samples from prostate, lung, colon, and breast tissues types. the nCounter technology is a robust, sensitive, reproducible, and easy-to-use method. two kits of reagents are required: the CodeSet and the Master Kit. the codeSet has customized or pre-designed probes, depending on one's experimental protocol, and a set of system controls. the nanoString nCounter technology was chosen to assay RNA extracted from FFPE samples from stage II gastric cancer patients based on its ability to evaluate the expression levels of up to 800 genes. a 25-gene signature for medulloblastoma patients was established using a specific NanoString nCounter codeSet. the digital Analyzer senses the hybridized colour-coded probes and captures the signal intensities as gene expression mRNA levels. as the probes anneal directly to an RNA sample, no reverse transcription to produce cDNA is required. data analysis The Digital Analyzer uses a CCD camera through a microscope objective lens to magnify and image the immobilized Reporters. it processes the images and exports the data as comma separated (.csv) output files. the software performs quality control (QC) and data normalization and analysis. 186 patients were identified for the identification of prognostic genes. 8 genes were identified that efficiently predicted a patient's outcome for the recurrence of cancer post-surgery. a 25-gene signature for medulloblastoma patients was established using a specific nanoString nCounter codeSet. the miSeq\u00ae bench-top appliance sequences the cDNA templates and generates sequence reads in densities of 10 million individual molecular clusters per square centimeter. the kit includes reverse transcriptase for the reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, primers, and adaptors. in the first phase, the \u201ctag alignment\u201d phase, potential alignments of the mRNA tags to the reference genome are identified. the second phase, \u201csplice interference phase\u201d, splice junctions appearing in one or more tags are further studied for their quality and diversity of alignments. amplicons targeting RUNX1, CEBPA, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, DNMT3A, EZH2 and TP53 were analyzed. the technique was used to assess the purpose of tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs) in systemic and local responses in tumor growth. the miSeq\u00ae bench-top appliance sequences the cDNA templates and generates sequence reads in densities of 10 million individual molecular clusters per square centimeter. the kit includes reverse transcriptase for the reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, primers, and adaptors. the miSeq Analysis folder contains a BaseCalls folder where the files are sent to. read alignment poses as a complication for RNA-Seq. reads are compared to a reference genome where exon-exon splice junctions exist in RNA transcripts but not DNA transcripts. splice junctions appearing in one or more tags are further studied for their quality and diversity of alignments. one study used NGS to analyze 21-genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers. one study analyzed the robustness of the PCR amplification strategies and GS FLX Titanium and Illumina MiSeq amplicon-deep sequencing platforms. fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was developed in the early 1980s. it applies fluorescent-labeled short DNA probes that hybridize to target DNA or RNA sequences in situ and fluorescence microscopy to localize and detect targets in tissue slides. RNA FISH is used for localization and detection of specific RNA targets (mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA) in tumor cells and tissues. one study analyzed MET expression and activity in a matched set of FFPE vs. fresh frozen tumor samples consisting of 20 cases of gastric cancer using both FISH and IHC. qRT-PCR analysis and FISH was applied in a study to assess miRNA expression in the HER2-positive breast cancer cells. it was found that miR-489 was expressed at a significantly lower level in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues and directly targets HER2.64 FISH can also be used for LncRNA expression detection in cancer. oligonucleotide probes are circularized following hybridization to a target sequence that is complementary to the probe ends. longer probes hybridize more specifically than shorter probes, so that strands of DNA or RNA (often 20-50 nucleotides) are often used to locate a target. one study analyzed MET expression and activity in a matched set of FFPE vs. fresh frozen tumor samples using both FISH and IHC. it was found that RNA FISH can be used to confirm findings obtained by IHC and potentially may replace IHC for certain targets. in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry techniques, TMAs can detect protein staining and cellular locations. however, the number of proteins to be detected is limited by the antibodies. RNA ISH requires a gene-specific nucleotide probe to bind to a certain sequence on a DNA or RNA strand. the probes may be labelled with radio-, antigen-, or fluorescent-labelled bases and analyzed by autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, or fluorescent microscopy. a tissue microarray was constructed using 2317 samples from 1842 patients to study the outcome of the amplification of CCNE and its protein expression. four independent TMAs were used to analyze the prognostic markers (ER, PR, and p53) in 553 breast carcinomas. TMAs of 544 clinical samples from varying stages of prostate cancer were used to study expression of candidate genes discovered by cDNA microarrays of the CWR22 xenograft model. using 60 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 264 primary tumors, 41 distal metastases, and 134 hormone refractory specimens, they demonstrated the use of S100P, CRYM, and LMO4 in affecting androgen-independent tissue microarrays (TMAs) require combining small tissue samples into \u201csausage blocks\u201d to study the connection between the tissue samples on the slide with the clinical data. however, the number of proteins to be detected is limited by the antibodies. RNA ISH requires a gene-specific nucleotide probe to bind to a certain sequence on a DNA or RNA strand. the probes may be labelled with radio-, antigen-, or fluorescent-labelled bases and analyzed by autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, or fluorescent microscopy. a tissue microarray was constructed using 2317 samples from 1842 patients to study the outcome of the amplification of CCNE and its protein expression. a single sample per tumor was sufficient to identify associations between molecular alterations and clinical outcome. a single sample per tumor was sufficient to identify associations between molecular alterations and clinical outcome. 5 independent laboratories constructed TMAs by coring an invasive breast cancer donor block from 29 patients twice. a moderate to high interlaboratory agreement was determined, demonstrating that TMAs are efficient for the identification of ER variability reporting. qRT-PCR, DNA Microarray, nanoString nCounter, Illumina MiSeq RNA-Seq, FISH, and Tissue Microarray assay properties. qRT-PCR, DNA Microarray, nanoString nCounter, Illumina MiSeq RNA-Seq, FISH, and tissue microarray assays were used in primer/probe design, sample preparation, instrument used, data analysis, reproducibility, specific qRT-PCR, DNA Microarray, NanoString nCounter, Illumina MiSeq RNA-Seq, and Tissue Microarray assay. prices could vary from different facilities. FISH Cost on Sample preparation $0.56 (SYBR)$0.82 (probe)/Singleplex reaction $50/array $20 $200-300 $75-2000/array, depending on cancer type Cost on Kit or plate $1416 (SYBR) $1834 (probe)/100 preps $350/plate $280-350/1 cartridge for 12 samples (Master Kit); $3600-4800/12 assays (Custom CodeSet); $1200-2320/12 reactions $515 for FISH Cost on Processing $0. qRT-PCR, DNA microarray, nanoString nCounter, and Illumina miSeq RNA-Seq methods are the same. commercial kits may be purchased for RNA extraction from cell lysate, FFPE, and FF samples. the purpose of the formalin fixation and paraffin embedding protocol is to preserve proteins for tests such as FISH or immunohistochemistry. nCounter has a high concordance (90%) rate with immunohistochemistry. it is limited to detecting 770 genes at once. this limitation is present no matter which sample type is chosen. a standardized method of RNA extraction must be established. multiple punches can be sampled from one tumor block simultaneously. qRT-PCR and microarrays do not provide reliable reproducibility data. one of the greatest drawbacks of TMAs is the tumor inter-heterogeneity. nCounter and miSeq have the ability to sense 1 copy of mRNA per cell. nCounter uses region-specific colour-coded probes to bind to a single transcript. sensitivity for TMAs can be analyzed in a number of ways. cDNA microarrays can employ probes up to a few thousand base pairs in length. oligonucleotide arrays perform best with shorter probes that can be 25-30mer or 60-70mer in length. the specificity of nanoString nCounter is due to its target-specific Capture and Reporter probes. a qRT-PCR assay has the potential to assess 384 samples at once. the number of samples analyzed on a DNA microarray can depend on the purpose of the microarray and the number of genes being assessed. nCounter has the capacity to input 12 samples and detect 800 genes. a single qRT-PCR reaction totals under $1.00. a sample processing of $0.50 has been reported to cost as little as $0.50 per reaction. a whole microarray slide can cost between $150-$400. studies have reported the cost to build and analyze a TMA to be $255 (18 cases) and $12 240 (48 cases), resulting to $12.50 per case. the instruments are valued at $25 000-$95 000 (thermal cycler for PCR), $50 000-$110 000 (microarray scanner), $235 000-$285 000 (NanoString Prep Station and Digital Analyzer), $128 000 (MiSeq Benchtop sequencer), and $55 000-$ 5.5 hours.107 Similar to the nCounter, Illumina MiSeq only requires the user to prepare the library and load it onto the reagent cartridge. the rest of the sample processing and data analysis is carried out by the MiSeq benchtop sequencer. FFPE samples are widely used in cancer genomics studies. qRT-PCR, DNA microarray, nanoString nCounter, and Illumina MiSeq RNA-Seq assays provide data for patient diagnosis and prognosis. FF samples allow for better preserved RNA but are limited in availability. studies have shown that FFPE/FF pairs demonstrate a high correlation when analyzing gene expression if the storage time of specimens is less than two years. an nCounter experiment has a high concordance (90%) rate with immunohistochemistry, demonstrating that it is reproducible. expression microarrays are highly reproducible, depending on the ability of a probe to anneal to the same number of transcripts across replicate experiments. many studies have confirmed the reproducibility of the nanoString nCounter platform due to its requirement of little input RNA and lack of a reverse transcription step. qRT-PCR and PCR have a reported sensitivity of 10 copies mRNA per cell. as little as 3 copies per cell have been detected in PCR. nCounter and miSeq have the ability to sense 1 copy of mRNA per cell. in situ hybridization is shown to have a sensitivity of 10-20 mRNA copies per cell. specificity of qRT-PCR depends on the forward and reverse primer design, as well as the oligonucleotide probe used in detection. specificity of DNA microarrays depends on a number of factors, such as the density of probes annealed to the slide, the single probe (hybridization of a probe to a single target), and spot-set (multiple spots represent different sections of the same sequence) qRT-PCR assay has the potential to assess 384 samples at once. the number of samples analyzed on a DNA microarray can depend on the purpose of the microarray and the number of genes being assessed. studies tend to depict 1-3 genes using fluorescent detection on a TMA.74,75,76,77 This may be because resolution can be difficult using many different probes in an in situ detection assay. kits can be obtained according to one's experimental design to reverse transcribe the mRNA to cDNA and carry out the remainder qRT-PCR steps. several institutes provide services to carry out an nCounter experiment for up to $530. a sample processing for targeted gene sequencing costs $90 on the MiSeq Benchtop sequencer, with a 50-500 base pair sequencing kit valued at $1400-$2000. qRT-PCR, DNA microarray, and nanoString nCounter assays have been used in clinical-related studies to analyze gene expression from cancer patient samples. qRT-PCR, DNA microarray, and nanoString nCounter assays have commercialized products for testing clinical use. 116,117 Tissue microarrays do not have a commercialized assay. they are used to detect up to a few genes in a maximum of 1000 samples. they are therefore ideal for validating studies using qRT-PCR, DNA microarrays, et cetera, and not for the assessment of individual or a small number of samples. qRT-PCR offers the cheapest and quickest assay for processing an individual clinical sample for 1-50 genes. small labs can purchase a thermal cycler for as little as $25 000 to process and analyze their sample. nCounter is suited for detection of 50-500 genes and microarray is good for more than 500 genes. biomarkers may undergo cost-utility studies measured in sum of money per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. $50 000 USD per QALY gained is considered the upper-limit for cost-effectiveness."}
