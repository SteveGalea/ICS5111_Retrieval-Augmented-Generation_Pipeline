{"summary": "poor health conditions shorten peoples\u2019 lives and undermine quality of life. these conditions also limit economic and social development by reducing \u2018human capital\u2019 and generating health costs. disruptive innovations may have the potential to improve health outcomes and lower costs. more than 170 biomarkers have been reported in the literature for the diagnosis of sepsis. however, only the most common biomarkers, such as CRP or procalcitonine, can typically be analysed within centralised hospital laboratories. sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common acute conditions worldwide. in 2012, there were 357.4 million new global cases of four common curable STIs. in 2012, there were 357.4 million new cases of four common curable STIs. lamydia is globally the most common bacterial STI and causes reproductive complications in women. in the united states alone drug-resistant bacteria cause at least 23.000 deaths and 2 million infections every year. this can have a transformative role in the treatments administered, constituting one step further in the path of personalised medicine. RTIs are the most common infections encountered within primary care. there is evidence that people presenting with acute uncomplicated RTIs will commonly receive antibiotics despite most RTIs being viral. there is a clear need for POCT that can differentiate RTIs within primary care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing as part of AMR stewardship. the cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is used for monitoring ovarian, breast and uterine cancer. there are several cardiac biomarkers, these can sometimes require 3-hourly or 6-hourly repeat blood tests, checking for dynamic rise. we might include tests for Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Rheumatoid Factor (RF), Antinuclear Antibody test (ANA) and, then potentially more specific autoantibody tests when investigating chronic or autoimmune diseases. there are also many chronic or autoimmune diseases linked to genetic mutatations, or even rare conditions such as Gorlin syndrome. blood or venous blood gas samples can be difficult to acquire if there is difficulty with gaining vessel access. urine samples may be tested with a dipstick for common abnormalities (protein, leukocytes, blood, glucose, nitrates) or urine test for pregnancy, prior to being sent for full investigation. sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common acute conditions worldwide. in 2012, there were 357.4 million new global cases of four common curable STIs. chlamydia (130.9 million cases); gonorrhoea (78.3 million cases); syphilis (5.6 million cases) and trichomoniasis (142.6 million cases) new lethal viruses and bacteria causing RTIs with epidemic potential have emerged over the last decade. these include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), swine-origin influenza A, multi-drug resistance tuberculosis and multi-drug resistance gram negative bacteria. there is a clear need for POCT that can differentiate RTIs within primary care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. IL-6, an interleukin, is overexpressed in several different cancers including prostate cancer, as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. the cytokine family are part of the zinc-dependent endopeptidases, where MMP-2 is key in tumour growth, invasion and metastasis. the alpha-fetoprotein, an oncofetal glycoprotein, is the most important for liver cancer tumour marker.

proximity sensors. each sensor is a valuable source for collecting information that can be tapped into for point-of-care applications. infrared cameras are made sensitive to infrared light (longer wavelength) infrared cameras detect temperature profile of objects and have the capability of visualizing subsurface features. infected wounds exhibit a characteristic temperature profile even in cases where infection exists in the underlying tissue of a closed wound. mobile phone-based point-of-care systems are no longer limited to the in-built mobile phone data processing and storage capabilities. they have near real-time access to the significantly larger computational and data storage capacity of remote servers. a mobile Zika virus detection unit was developed for in-field use. a portable low-cost mobile phone camera-based sensor was created with the help of a commercial 3D printer as a converted automated robotic arm. the sensor operates similarly to the gold standard for Zika virus detection. it uses reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA)/reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. a sample of 96 individuals were tested, with 97% stating a preference for the mobile phone-based sensor compared to the conventional testing method. 95% preferred finger-prick blood collection over the typical venipuncture method. the network could

into liquid compartments of a microfluidic cartridge. the cartridge is swiped through an opening in the cradle while the spectra of each sample are measured through processing the recorded video from a smartphone camera. the developed system demonstrated comparable results to that of a clinic grade instrument. a cheap handheld ultrasound tool has recently passed FDA approval for 13 clinical applications. this tool uses an array of tunable capacitive transducers instead of piezoelectric ceramics. the tool is connected to an iphone with an artificial intelligence component used for image acquisition and analysis. infrared cameras operate by projecting incident light using a lens on a rectangular array of micron scale photo-sensors that detect light in the visible spectrum. infrared cameras detect temperature profile of objects and, due to the higher penetration depth of infrared light compared to visible light, they can visualize subsurface features. the airflow into and out of the respiratory system generates acoustic waves that can be detected by mobile phone microphones. an example of such a system correlates the spectrum of respiration sound to flow rate of air, which

despite the increasing global adoption of EHR, protocols, and structure, the scope of EHR systems is continuously evolving. despite the increasing global adoption of EHR, protocols, and structure, the scope of EHR systems is continuously evolving. international organization for standardization (ISO) has proposed the adoption of ISO/TS 18308 for EHR systems. key features include interoperability with other EHR systems, storage of both structured and unstructured data, cross-software and hardware platform compatibility. machine learning methods use a training set ( x 1, y 1 ), ( x 2, y 2 ),..., ( x n, y n ) to automatically learn a classification model h. most popular classification methods include the simple k\u2013nearest-neighbor rule, linear discriminant function, Bayes classification, decision tree, support vector machine, and the family of deep learning (neural networks) the recent development of deep learning [91,92,93] is currently very promising on automatic feature learning. a hierarchy of features can be learned to build representations of patterns with multiple levels of abstraction. most applications of deep learning use deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) despite the existence of these deep learning libraries, there is still a lack of comprehensible and easy-to-use high-level tools for the design, training, and testing of large-scale and deep neural networks. a step towards such tools is the recently proposed system Barista [101], an open-source graphical high-level interface for the Caffe deep learning library. a serious problem with all automatic machine learning approaches is that they need (1) very large data sets and (2) top-quality data sets. worldwide there is an increasing need for making results re-traceable, transparent and understandable to the medical domain expert (who rarely is a computer expert) this is of vital importance when dealing with the aforementioned medical issues and particularly on mobile devices. globally-open-access data removes the requirement for ethical approval. researchers can produce open data and publish work on their novel concepts, methods, tools and algorithms. this can be made
