{"summary": "156 retail meat samples were purchased, 15 at a time, during January\u2013March 2006, and 6 at a time during July\u2013November 2006. RNA was extracted from a 140-L sample of the resulting filtrate by using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit. the RNA was used as a template for 1-step reverse-transcription\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) using Monroe region B primers (24) or Ando region A primers (25) and the OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) the primer sequences were removed and the resulting 172 bp or 81 bp of sequence was aligned to noV standard genotypes. the alignments were subjected to phylogenetic analysis with 2,000 replicates for bootstrapping using the Seqboot, Dnadist, Neighbor, and Consense programs. results and Discussion NoV Detection in Swine Fecal Samples A total of 120 swine fecal samples were tested for noV RNA by using region B primers (24) of these, 30 were confirmed by sequence analysis to contain partial genomic sequence from NoV. the 11 swine GII.18 strains had pairwise nucleotide identities ranging from 82% to 99% with no 2 identical strains. sequences from 2 of the 4 detected human strains were identical to each other and to the Farmington Hills reference strain (CE-M-05\u20130045 and CE-M-05\u20130102, Figure 2). GII.4 NoV may be transferred directly from pigs to humans or from humans to pigs, providing a zoonotic source for human noV outbreaks. pigs may be co-infected with both a human and a swine strain of NoV. the sequence for region B of the noV polymerase was determined for these NoV strains and compared with reference strains. this finding suggests that the viruses detected and characterized as GII.4 NoV by using region B primers from swine and bovine manure may represent novel NoV types. human noVs have not been shown experimentally to infect cattle. however, the human and bovine noVs share a cross-reactive epitope in their capsid proteins. the risk for bovine noV infection in humans is thought to be low (21) 25% of swine fecal samples tested in this study contrast with the results of other surveys. the rates observed were 2% in US adult swine (15), 20% in US finisher pigs (older, heavier pigs being finished before slaughter) and 0% in Venezuelan pigs (30). the different specificities of the primer sets used in the 4 studies likely account for the differences in virus recovery. the sequence of the noV polymerase region amplified was determined for the 30 strain none of the amplicons sequenced were identical to the laboratory strains that we routinely use in our research activities. reasons for incomplete sequencing include low concentrations of RNA and overlapping peaks in portions of the chromatogram. pigs may be co-infected with both a human and a swine strain of NoV. we did not identify GII.18-like and GII.4-like NoVs from the same manure sample. a new variant of NoV with increased virulence has been seen in the GII.4 cluster in the past. by region B phylogeny, the strain was classified as GII.4 (Farmington Hills) NoV (CE-M-06\u20130509; Figures 1, 2). Interestingly, the region A sequence did not share >77% identity with any of the standard viruses in the GenBank database. bootstrap values were 16%\u201340% for most branches in the tree. 156 retail meat samples have been processed and tested for the presence of noV. one sample of raw pork has tested positive for a noV of the GII.4 cluster. the region B sequence for this strain was not identical to any of the other sequences identified in this study. V may have a zoonotic route of transmission to humans (15) it follows that infected humans may pass the virus to livestock. some outbreaks of gastroenteritis in farm animals may be prevented by controlling access of ill workers to livestock."}
