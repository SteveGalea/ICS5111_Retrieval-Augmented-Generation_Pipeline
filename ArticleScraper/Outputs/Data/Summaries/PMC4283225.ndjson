{"summary": "the first case of MERS was reported at September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. severity rate is increasing day by day. it is caused by a type of human coronavirus called MERS-CoV. this scenario could be changed rapidly globally. miRNAs are genomically encoded, small noncoding RNA molecule, generally 19\u201326 base pairs in length, which regulate posttranscriptional level genes expression. some plants, animals, and viruses encode the miRNAs to regulate their diverse biological or physiological processes including development, apoptosis, tumorogenesis, proliferation, stress response, and fat metabolism. miRNA is being explored as antiviral defense against several diseases. it has been reported that the use of miRNAs as an anti-HCV treatment demonstrated promising efficacy and safety results. RNAfold web server was used to predict the secondary structure of pre-miRNA. pre-miRNA hairpins were screened with VMir MERS-CoV viral genome. as default setting, 665 candidate hairpins have been identified. 11 sequences of candidate miRNA precursors were identified as candidate miRNA precursor based on significant sequence similarity with human miRNAs. human miRNAs which show minimum 19 bp sequence similarity with candidate miRNA precursor were selected as primary target miRNAs. 89, hsa-miR-208a-3p, hsa-miR-510-3p, hsa-miR-18a-3p, hsa-miR-329-3p, hsa-miR-548ax, and hsa-miR-342-3p. alignments of precursor miRNA hairpin sequences with human miRNAs. RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridization of a long and a short RNA. pairing energy at 10 kcal/mol was used as cut-off score. effective hybridizations are shown in Box 1. minimum free energy (MFE), the thermodynamic ensemble of RNA (pf) and the centroid structures were depicted. 3.1. Prediction of precursor miRNA (Pre-miRNA) hairpins with VMir MERS-CoV viral genome was screened with VMir Analyzer program. 11 sequences identified as candidate miRNA precursor based on significant sequence similarity with human miRNAs. human miRNAs which show minimum 19 bp sequence similarity with candidate miRNA precursor were selected as primary target miRNAs. perfect complementarity between 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA and the seed region of miRNA (2\u20137 bp) is important during gene silencing. -miR-329-3p, hsa-miR-548ax, and hsa-miR-342-3p respectively. hsa-miR-548ax and hsa-miR-342-3p aligned with human miRNAs. RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridization of a long and a short RNA. the pairing energy at 10 kcal/mol was used as cut-off score. effective hybridizations are shown in Box 1. discussion MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded, a class of small noncoding RNAs (22 nt), which normally function as negative regulators of target mRNA expression at the stage of posttranscriptional level. perfect complementarity between 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA and the seed region of miRNA (2\u20137 bp) is thought to be sufficient for effective cleavage but imperfect complementarity may block translation. hsa-miR-6804-3p, hsa-miR-4289, hsa-miR-208a-3p, hsa-miR-510-3p, hsa-miR-548ax, hsa-miR-3934-5p, hsa-miR-4474-5p, hsa-miR-7974, and hsa-miR hsa-miR-332-3p is thought to associate with idiopathic prion disease. it has been proposed that the upregulation of hsa-miR-342-3p may be a general phenomenon in late stage prion disease. hsa-miR-628-5p, hsa-miR-18a-3p, and hsa-miR-332-3p may be used as a novel marker for animal -3p may be a general phenomenon in late stage prion disease. could be used as a novel marker for human transmissible spongiform Encephalopathies (human TSEs)"}
