{"summary": "retrospective study of children with HCoV detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for a community cohort and a children\u2019s hospital in the same community from January 2013 to December 2014. the distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. retrospective study was performed to identify children 18 years of age with HCoV detected in respiratory tract in nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected using flocked nylon swabs. if a child had more than 1 positive test for HCoV, subsequent episodes were included if a different HCoV type was detected. children under 1 year of age meet criteria for swabbing if they have rhinorrhea/congestion only. children in the hospital group were admitted to the newyork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children\u2019s Hospital (MSCH) and CUMC. research staff asked participants about the presence of fever (defined as 37.8\u00b0C), their maximum temperature, feeling feverish, cough, sore throat, runny nose/nasal congestion, body aches, chills, headache, and wheezing. medically attended events were defined as reported visits to the primary care provider or urgent care, admissions to the ED, and/or hospitalizations. bivariate analyses assessed the associations of demographic characteristics, clinical factors, HCoV types, and presence of viral codetections. severity of illness was compared between hospitalized children with and without viral codetections. the community cohort provided written informed consent to be in the study, verbal consent for swabs, and children were granted a waiver of verbal assent. children from the community cohort were participants in the MObile Surveillance for ARI/ILI in the Community (MoSAIC) study performed prospective community-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI) using text messaging. swabs from the community and nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized subjects were analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR using the same FDA-approved filmArray Respiratory panel 1.7 (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) the community samples were tested in a research laboratory, and the hospital samples were tested in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at CUMC. HCoV types and viral coinfection associated with respiratory support were collected from the electronic medical record. chronic complex conditions included prematurity (37 weeks gestation in children 2 years of age), cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genetic/congenital, hematologic/immunologic, malignancy, metabolic, neuromuscular, renal, and respiratory conditions. differences in the proportion of HCoV types detected in the community versus the hospital group were compared using 2 tests. children admitted to the PICU and/or to the floor who required respiratory support for postoperative care or to manage CCCs were excluded. multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between any predictor variables with a P value of.1 in the bivariate analyses. the proportion of all HCoV types detected, except 229E, was highest among 1\u20135 year olds. 5 (10.2%) children also had other respiratory viruses detected. 4 children (8.2%) had more than one HCoV type detected. most (73.5%) community cases did not report CCCs other than asthma (20.4%).
