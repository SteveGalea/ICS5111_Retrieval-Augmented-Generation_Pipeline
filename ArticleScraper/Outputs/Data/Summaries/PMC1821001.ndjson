{"summary": "there is a lack of data on the role of infectious disease in calf morbidity and mortality in Mozambique. the common conditions affecting calves are merely described as diarrhoea and/or pneumonia without identification of their aetiology. virulence factors identified for ETEC strains are expression of fimbrial (pili) antigens that enables the bacteria to adhere to and colonise the luminal surface of the small bowel. most bovine ETEC produce STa enterotoxin and K99 fimbriae. a previous survey on bovine virus diarrhoea, rotavirus and coronavirus in calf diarrhoea. the calves were left to suckle their dams up to 3 days after birth. at one month of age they were moved to a common pen where they were kept up to 6 months. a small portion of faecal samples was suspended in 0.85% saline, filtered through 0.45 mm Milipore filter papers. filters were then cultured in Preston broth (Oxoid) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. each faecal sample was also cultured on 5% sheep blood agar. in the first column of wells, 300 l of growth media containing 1% (w/v) proteose peptone and 0.11% (w/v) bromothymol blue were inoculated. in the remaining wells 150 l of the medium were inoculated. the results were automatically read by a microplate reader. Statistical analysis The Chi-square test was used with Yate's correction when applicable. eight dairy farms (F1 to F8) were chosen for this study. 5 of them were located in 2 southern provinces: Maputo and Gaza. any calf with faeces whithout these characteristics was considered non-diarrhoeic or healthy. on each sampling occasion, all diarrhoeic calves and about 30% of the healthy calves were sampled from each farm. samples were cultured on the same day or stored at 4\u00b0C. each faecal sample was cultured on 5% sheep blood agar, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. each faecal sample was also cultured on 5% sheep blood agar, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h and inspected for the presence of other bacterial pathogens. a total of 1,241 calves were reared in the 8 farms during the sampling period. 63 (5%) had signs of diarrhoea, almost all cases occurring during seasons S1 and S2. the prevalence of affected animals in the different farms was up to 21%. in 1995 all diarrhoeal cases were found in 8 dairy farms in mozambique. bars indicate 4 different sampling occasions during 2 consecutive years. in farm F3 a significant difference was observed in the rate of Campylobacter in all calves (p = 0.001) out of 40 isolates subject to species identification, 32 (80%) belonged to C. jejuni. the former species was more often found in farm F3 (18/32) while the latter was relatively more common in the other farms (7/8) the diversity among E. coli isolates in diarrhoeal calves was similar to that of healthy calves. the K99 antigen was more prevalent in diarrhoeal calves 22/55 (40%) than in healthy calves 14/88 (16%) (p = 0.001) diarrhoea in calves was observed in 6 of the 8 farms studied. farms F3 and F6 were the farms with the highest mean prevalences. diarrhoea in calves appears to be more common in the rainy season. bovine enteric coronavirus is the major infectious cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea in some dairy herds. most of the samples without Enterobacteria and Campylobacter came from farms F3 and F6, the 2 farms with high prevalence of diarrhoea. salmonella was isolated from 2% of the 393 animals studied. it was not possible to associate the finding with the occurrence of diarrhoea. the importance for human health of animal reservoirs of Salmonella species has long been recognised. enterotoxin producing E. coli is a common cause of diarrhoea in animals. the diversities of E. coli isolated in healthy and diarrhoeal calves were roughly the same. this fact speaks against that diarrhoea in several calves was caused by single pathogenic strains of E. coli. rhoeal farm and STa and LT producing E. coli were not found but K99 antigen was more prevalent in E. coli strains from diarrhoeal than from healthy calves. the antigen was also associated with one diarrhoeal farm."}
