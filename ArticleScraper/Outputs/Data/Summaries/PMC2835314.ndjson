{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoV), HCoV-229E (group I) and HCoV-OC43 (group II) cause approximately 5\u201330% of all human respiratory infections [1,2] in 2002, severe acute Respiratory Syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected more than 8,000 people resulting in approximately 750 deaths [3\u20135]. strains used most commonly for pathogenesis studies are the neurotropic JHM, the hepatotropic/neurotropic A59 and hepatotropic MHV-3. MHV has a 32kb single stranded positive sense RNA genome. structural proteins, spike (S), matrix (M), and envelope (E) are all found within the viral envelope. the two main target organs for the most commonly studied coronavirus strains are the central nervous system (CNS) and the liver. an interesting aspect to MHV infection is that host immune responses in these two organs may be quite different due to the immune privileged status of the CNS and the unique toleragenic environment of the liver. results and discussion Virus induced innate immune response. Coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm where they produce large amounts of dsRNA [33,34] which can potentially be recognized by PRRs. toll-like receptors (TLR) are localized to the endosomal membrane and recognize virus entering through endocytosis. MHV enters cells through both receptor-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane and by endocytosis. secreted IFN- and - bind to a distinct IFNAR receptor (IFNAR1/IFNAR2) expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells. binding induces receptor oligomerization followed by phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 to form the ISGF3 heterotrimer. the adaptive immune response in the immune privileged CNS is generally considered to be different from that in the peripheral organs. this is supported by the observation that the major type I IFN producer cell type plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are not present in the brain parenchyma and IRF-7, the transcription factor mediating IFN- expression in pDCs is not constitutively expressed in the CNS. MHV either does not induce type I IFN [33,42] or induces IFN protein [23] or IFN mRNA only [43] to a very limited extent and only very late after infection. despite this lack of induction, MHV was unable to block IFN induction by other viruses or by poly I:C, leading to speculation that MHV replication cycle somehow involved sequestering of RNA from the pattern recognition receptors. early studies by Virelizier et al. revealed that IFN was important for protection from MHV-3 induced fulminant hepatitis. mice treated therapeutically with recombinant IFN- or \u2013 alone or in combination with ribavirin, a therapy used to limit hepatitis C virus replication in the liver. despite resistance to IFN, MHV is unable to protect NDV from the antiviral effects of IFN. despite resistance to IFN, MHV is unable to protect NDV from the antiviral activities by an unknown mechanism. supernatants were collected from infected 293T cells transiently expressing MHV-R (CEACAM1a) or L2 cells at times indicated and viral titers were determined by plaque assay in L2 cells. cell-type differences may depend to some degree on basal expression levels of IFN signaling molecules and transcriptions factors involved in the IFN response. MHV strains A59 (neurotropic and hepatotropic) or JHM (neurotropic only) and infection by either intracranial (IC) or intraperitoneal (IP) routes of infection were highly lethal and led to increased levels of infectious virus in the usual target organs as well as spread to other organs not normally affected. type I IFNAR expression was most important on LysM+ macrophages and to a lesser degree on CD11c+ DC to control viral replication and spread and to limit hepatitis regardless of route of inoculation (intraperitoneal (IP) or intranasal (IN). loss of signaling on either LysM+ macrophages, CD11c+ DC, CD19+ B cells, or CD4+ T cells had no significant effect on replication in the murine and human fibroblasts cells lines (17Cl-1, L2, 293T, and L929) and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) productively infected with MHV-A59 or \u2013JHM displayed little to no IFN-/ production. however, a small percentage of MHV infected cells had nuclear localized IRF-3 at 24 hours post infection. total RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR with primers specific to IFN- mRNA. values represent IFN- mRNA levels relative to those in mock infected MEFs. the mechanism by which MHV evades recognition by cellular PRRs is unknown. MHV replicates on double membrane vesicles that are hypothesized to be this privileged site. transfection of 293T cells with RNA from MHV infected cells does not induce IFN- while transfection of RNA from rabies virus (RV) infected neuroblastoma cell lines or SeV infected 293T cells induces significant amounts of IFN- mRNA. IFN- mRNA levels in transfected 293T cells were analyzed using qRT-PCR 24h post transfection. mRNA values are expressed as fold change over 293T cells transfected with mock infected RNA. in vivo neurons produce IFN- in response to infection by RNA viruses. MDA5 mRNA expression is undetectable in fibroblasts that do not induce IFN- in response to MHV infection. despite lack of type I interferon response in fibroblast cultures, MHV infection does induce IFN-/ in spleen-derived plasmacytoid DCs. induction of IFN-/ expression in vivo is cell-type specific. two studies have investigated the induction of IFN-/ following in vivo MHV infection with the neurotropic MHV strain, JHM or the hepatotropic/neurotropic strain, A59. Roth-Cross et al. found macrophages and microglia recovered from the CNS of A59 infected wild type mice were expressing IFN-. in vitro cultures of primary neurons, astrocytes and hepatocytes failed to produce detectable amounts of IFN. MHV induction of IFN is highly cell type dependent. mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR using IFN- specific primers. data are representative of two independent experiments. MHV failed to induce IFN and is relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN signaling in fibroblasts. MHV infection does not activate PKR as evidence by lack of eIF2 phosphorylation. MHV N expressed in VVE3L failed to prevent activation of the PKR pathway in infected HeLa or 17Cl-1 cells. this suggests that MHV is also able to prevent activation of PKR. there was a small but statistically significant reduction in the replication of MHV-nsp1 99 in macrophages that had been pretreated with IFN- as compared to wild type virus. there were no differences in resistance to IFN in cDCs and no effect on the ability of virus either to replicate or to induce IFN in cDCs. nsp3 is a large (180\u2013200 kDa) multifunctional protein encoded within ORF 1a of the replicase gene of coronaviruses. nsp3 contains two domains demonstrated to be virulence factors, the so called \u201cX\u201d or macro domain (ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP)) and the papain like protease (PLP) domain. frieman et al. [79] confirmed that PLP inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF3. they showed that PLP also inhibited NFB activation by stabilizing levels of the NFB inhibitor, IB. this is in disagreement with Zheng et al. [80] who concluded that MHV PLP does have an IFN antagonist activity, which is dependent on the deubiquitinating activity. nsp3 macro domain and ns2 putative cyclophosphodiesterase (CPD) all coronaviruses encode a conserved ADRP domain. MHV ns2 protein encoded in ORF2a is predicted to have a 1\u2032\u2032, 2\u2032\u2032- cyclophosphodiesterase (CPD) activity. this activity has not been detected to date for the MHV ns2 protein. mutations of the catalytic residues of the MHV-A59 ADRP also caused attenuation of hepatitis. ns2 mutants are unable to induce IFN-, in fibroblasts and their replication is not inhibited by IFN- pre-treatment. s2 mutants are more sensitive to IFN in the relevant primary cell types in vivo. mutation of the macro domain of MHV did not confer increased sensitivity to IFN-. however, this mutant did have decreased ability to induce several cytokines, most notably IL-6, in a cell type specific manner. coronavirus replicase protein nsp14 (p59) is a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN) of the DEDD superfamily. this activity increases the fidelity of transcription of MHV. a single amino acid substitution Tyr6398His, 140 amino acids downstream of the last predicted exoribonuclease catalytic motif resulted in significant attenuation in mice. virus replication in vivo demonstrated by increased viral replication, dissemination, and increased mortality in IFN-/ receptor knockout mice. cellular innate immune response recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) expressed by viruses such as dsRNA. toll-like receptors (TLR) are localized to the endosomal membrane and recognize virus entering through endocytosis. secreted IFN- and - bind to a distinct IFNAR receptor (IFNAR1/IFNAR2) expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells. STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and associate with the transcription factor IRF9 to form the ISGF3 heterotrimer. viruses often employ multiple strategies to evade the antiviral interferon system. the adaptive immune response in the immune privileged CNS is generally considered to be different from that in the peripheral organs. despite this finding an important role for type I IFN was inferred from the increased neurovirulence of numerous viruses following infection of mice genetically deficient in the expression of IFN receptor (IFNAR-/-) ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes, macrophages, ventricular epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, responded to IFN. MHV either does not induce type I IFN [33,42] or induces IFN protein [23] or IFN mRNA only [43] to a very limited extent and only very late after infection. despite this lack of induction, MHV was unable to block IFN in we will review the literature on the interactions of MHV with the type I IFN system in infections in vivo, in the CNS and the liver. this will be followed by a discussion of MHV proteins that may play a role in immune evasions strategies. replication of MHV strains A59, JHM and MHV-2 was only marginally impaired in L2 and 17Cl-1 cells [43,44] and 293T (Figure 2) treated 16h prior to infection with high doses of IFN-, while replication of Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) was completely inhibited. despite resistance to IFN, MHV evades antiviral activities by an unknown mechanism. total RNA from infected cells was isolated at 370 \u00b0C for 1h hour. values are normalized to -actin and expressed as fold over mock infected cells. cell-type differences may depend to some degree on basal expression levels of IFN-. the T cell response to MHV peaks at about five days post infection. there is a robust innate response including macrophage migration and secretion of chemokines. infections were carried out in the absence of IFN signaling. type I IFNAR signaling was most important on LysM+ macrophages and to a lesser degree on CD11c+ DC to control viral replication and spread. compared with intranasal (IN) route of inoculation, authors showed loss of signaling on either LysM+ macrophages, CD11c+ DC, CD19+ B cells, or CD4+ T cells had no significant effect on replication in the brain. MHV induction of IFN-/ in vitro led to investigations into possible innate immune evasion mechanism of this murine coronavirus. however, in several MHV infected fibroblast cell lines, NFB and IRF-3 were not localized to the nucleus up to 12 hours post-infection. a59 induces low levels of IFN- mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. RNA was isolated at indicated times. values represent IFN- mRNA levels relative to those in mock infected MEFs. inability to block IFN-/ induced by other PAMPs has led to speculation that the viral RNA is sequestered in a protected site that excludes detection machinery including PRRs. transfection of 293T cells with RNA from MHV infected cells which contain high levels of viral dsRNA does not induce IFN- while transfection of RNA from RV infected neuroblastoma cells induces significant amounts of IFN- mRNA. expressing MHV receptor (CEACAM1a) 24 hours post infection with A59, JHM or SeV or neuroblastoma cells mock infected or infected with rabies virus (RV) 293T cells were transfected using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche) with 1g of total RNA that was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (+CIP) or left untreated (CIP) MDA5 mRNA expression is undetectable in fibroblasts that do not induce IFN- in response to MHV infection. despite lack of type I interferon response in fibroblast cultures, MHV infection does induce IFN-/ in spleen-derived plasmacytoid DCs. macrophages isolated from the infected brain as well as in bone marrow derived macrophages in vitro. this varies with cell type and may have to do with factors such route of entry of virus or localization within the cell of viral RNA in transcription complexes. hepatitis and virus dissemination ensued in mice that were depleted of pDCs by the antibody, -mPDC-1. expression of IFN-/ by in vitro infected cDCs was detected only very late after infection. MHV encoded antagonists of IFN synthesis and signaling. fewer examples of MHV proteins with direct effects on either IFN induction or signaling. MHV proteins may function in concert to evade IFN responses. expression of N was able to rescue vaccinia virus E3L (VVE3L) from the antiviral effects of IFN and prevent degradation of host RNA suggesting N is able to antagonize the activity of RNase L. MHV infection in the presence or absence of IFN does not activate PKR as evidence by lack of eIF2 phosphorylation. the nsp1 mutant was attenuated in its ability to replicate in the liver and the spleen and to cause hepatitis following IP inoculation. the attenuation was not observed when IFNAR-/- mice were infected with MHV-nsp199 suggesting that nsp1 confers the ability to resist the effects of type I IFN. however, there were no differences in resistance to IFN in cDCs. nsp3 is a large (180\u2013200 kDa) multifunctional protein encoded within ORF 1a of the replicase gene of coronaviruses. nsp3 contains two domains shown to be virulence factors, the so called \u201cX\u201d or macro domain (ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) and the papain like protease (PLP) domain. several studies have demonstrated that PLP blocks IRF3 dependent induction of IFN-. but there is disagreement about the mechanism by which this occurs. a mutation that subtlety alters viral fitness in a particular cell type may be enough for the cellular IFN system to gain the advantage. a direct IFN antagonizing capacity of a viral protein or ORF could influence the availability of viral PAMPs for detection by PRRs or influence the sensitivity of the virus to the antiviral state induced by IFN-/. the CPD would convert aDP-ribose-1\u201d2\u201d cyclic phosphate into aDP-ribose 1\u201d phosphate. this activity has not been detected to date for the MHV ns2 protein. the ADRP of several coronaviruses including HCo-229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus was shown to convert the product of the CPD. mutants like wild type A59 are unable to induce IFN- in fibroblasts. mutant induces IFN- to a similar extent as wild type following infection of bone marrow derived macrophages. mutation of MHV-A59 ns2 mutant did not confer increased sensitivity to IFN-. poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP-1) binds to Sindbis nsp3 outside of the macro domain. this interaction regulates transcription in neuronal cells. the role of the Sindbis macro domain in CNS infection is not yet understood. resistance of MHV to the antiviral effects of type I IFN is not well understood. the mechanisms behind the cell type specific differences in IFN induction and signaling are not well understood."}
