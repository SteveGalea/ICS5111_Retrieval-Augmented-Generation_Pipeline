{"summary": "despite widespread use of symptom-based screening tools in Ontario, there are no data supporting the accuracy of these screening tools in hospitalized patients. the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 23.5%. study population Consecutive inpatients who were at least 18 years of age underwent a screening tool assessment at presentation. most responsible diagnosis was cardiac, respiratory or infectious in nature. some cases in which the screening tool was incompletely or incorrectly applied. the Ottawa Hospital Data Warehouse is a relational database containing information from several of TOH\u2019s most important operation information systems. all eligible patient encounters underwent chart review using an objective abstraction tool to determine baseline characteristics, the treating physician\u2019s clinical diagnosis, the FRI and ILI results, and the microbiological test results. standard approaches for calculating test characteristics and 95% confidence limits were applied (11). all patients with positive FRI screens underwent additional screening using the tool. droplet isolation precautions were applied if the FRI screen was positive. if the ILI was positive, patients may have been placed under airborne isolation. the Charlson Index was calculated using a validated method for administrative data (12) codes used for \u2018complications\u2019 were excluded and only \u2018comorbid\u2019 diagnoses were used. the primary analysis group consisted of a subset of patients who underwent laboratory testing (200 of 391 patients) the secondary analysis was conducted on all patients in the study cohort (n=391) and used a clinical diagnosis of influenza as the gold-standard diagnosis based on the hospital discharge summary. n/a 9 (5.8) 5 (1.7) 33 (9.7) Sex Female 24 (51.1) 84 (54.9) 30 (55.6) 180 (53.4) Male 23 (48.9) 69 (45.1) 24 (44.4) 157 (46.6) Charlson Index score 0 23 (48.9) 49 (32.0) 28 (51.9) 86 (25.5) 1\u20132 18 (38.3) 55 (35.9) 16 (29.6) 128 (38.0) 3\u20134 5 (6.4) 28 (18 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were younger, had shorter length of hospital stay and had lower baseline probability of in-hospital mortality. sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool were 75.6% (95% CI 61.3% to 85.8%) and 46.3% (95% CI 38.2% to 54.7%) the strength of agreement between the laboratory and clinical diagnosis of influenza was calculated among 200 patients in the present study. 200 patients had both a clinical diagnosis and mirobiological testing performed. the kappa statistic was 0.799 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.90), which is considered 'good agreement' if RIDTs become less expensive and more accurate in the future, they could play an important role in screening processes for patients with FRI. if RIDTs become less expensive and more accurate in the future, they could play an important role in screening processes for patients with FRI. primary analysis group represented a subset of the study cohort. only 200 of 391 patients were swabbed for influenza. this introduces a selection bias into the study and represents a limitation of its retrospective design. prospective research should examine influenza seasons with variable prevalence to better understand the FRI and ILI screening tool performance. if the prevalence of influenza is lower (for example, 5% or 10%) in a given influenza season, then the post-test probability of having influenza with a negative screening tool drops below 10%. the tuberculin skin test is falsely negative 30% of the time when used in the assessment of active TB (30. this means 30% of active disease would be missed and would represent a substantial transmission risk. guidelines have not advocated for use of the tuberculin skin test in detection of active TB (30."}
