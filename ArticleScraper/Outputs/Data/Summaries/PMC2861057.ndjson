{"summary": "behavioural responses can be expected if an influenza pandemic was to occur. but participants do not feel well informed. behavioural responses can impact the societal consequences of a pandemic. the PMT distinguishes two phases, namely a threat appraisal and a coping appraisal. the threat appraisal is determined by perceived personal susceptibility to the threat (beliefs about the likelihood of getting a disease or condition) and perceived severity of the threat (feelings about the seriousness of contracting an illness) the coping appraisal is determined by variables relating to the suggested protective response. studies that focus on behavioural responses to an influenza pandemic are available. one is a study conducted by markel and colleagues [12]. they described the effects of a number of nonpharmaceutical interventions. these included school closures, bans on gathering in public places, isolation and quarantine, and ancillary interventions. researchers studied people's responses to recent outbreaks of SARS and Avian Influenza. they found that risk perception, communication preferences, trust in the source of information impacted people's responses. some authors have explored people's responses to disasters and other crises. the first and most common behavioural response is neighbor-helps-neighbor. the third and statistically most unlikely response is neighbor-competes-with-neighbor. this is essentially panic and is considered to be the consequence of perceptions that opportunities to escape are limited. the threat appraisal stimulates the intention to act while the coping appraisal determines the type of action employed. the action may be adaptive and lead to the performance of the advised protective or precautionary behaviours or it can be maladaptive thus leading to the performance of behaviours other than those advised. if perceived severity and susceptibility are high, people will not be inclined to act. participants indicated that if a new influenza pandemic were to occur, they would likely limit their use of public transportation and avoid places of entertainment and shopping for nonessentials. participants also reported considering their risk for infection high in health care facilities but did not indicate that they would avoid such facilities. some authors have explored people's responses to disasters and other crises. some authors have explored people's responses to pandemics, including anthrax and smallpox. they concluded that people were poorly informed about most threats. participants were asked how they would act during a pandemic depending on severity of pandemic, protective instructions provided and communication strategies employed. participants were asked how they would act during a pandemic depending on the severity of pandemic, the protective instructions provided and the communication strategies used. participants asked the extent to which they think they are well informed about influenza viruses and epidemics, and about protective actions. these answers were collapsed to generate three categories, namely 'well informed','moderately informed' and 'poorly informed' participants that indicated a willingness to wear the face mask were provided with an additional scenario in which the response costs were increased. these included \"people may think you have the new influenza and avoid you\" and \"the face mask causes skin irritation\" participants were asked again if they would wear the face mask in all public places. participants posed scenarios that could take place if a pandemic were to occur. a family member becomes ill, the participant becomes less able to work, the schools close, and antiviral drug availability is limited. participants were asked to imagine that the government has asked all people with influenza to stay home. \"a vaccine for a new influenza virus can only be developed after the outbreak\" participants were asked if they would want to use the drug. they were asked if they would agree with a policy that prioritizes the treatment of vulnerable groups. a new and unknown form of influenza that is transmitted from person to person develops. it is not possible to predict whether or not a new influenza virus is in fact dangerous and will cause an epidemic or a pandemic. being informed was measured with items that asked participants how many people they think would get sick if a pandemic were to occur. participants scored on a 5 point scale ranging from 'yes, I am very certain that the measures could be taken' to 'no, I am certain that the measures could NOT be taken/that I could NOT take the measures' participants that indicated a willingness to wear the face mask were given an additional scenario in which the response costs were increased. communication Perceived trustworthiness of information sources was measured by asking participants to indicate first the degree to which they consider ten sources of information to be trustworthy sources of information in general. participants were asked to select two of seven topics they would like to receive information about immediately (see Results) Scenarios Participants were posed a series of possible scenarios that could take place if a worldwide influenza pandemic were to occur. participants were asked if they would be in a position to care for their children. they were asked if they would be in a position to care for their children. participants were asked if they would be in a position to care for their children. a new and unknown form of

children. participants were asked if they would be in a position to care for their children. 21% reported having been completely familiar with the information, 38% were mostly familiar, 12% were vaguely familiar and 12% were not at all familiar with the information. authorities estimate 30% people in the Netherlands would get sick if an influenza pandemic were to occur. only 5% of participants indicated being constantly scared that an influenza pandemic will occur. 44% said they would probably be willing, 13% indicated they would probably not be willing, 2% indicated they would probably not be willing, 2% indicated they would probably not wear a face mask and 6% were unsure. 56% of participants indicated they would probably wear a face mask even if it is stigmatizing or irritating. only 4% agreed completely with the statement and 8% agreed mostly. despair reported by 18% while stocking up and staying indoors was reported by 28%. Adaptive responses Avoiding places of entertainment, public transportation and clubs were considered feasible protective measures by more than one third of the participants. Approximately half of the sample was willing to avoid social contact if necessary and 40% reported willingness to avoid health care professionals. 21% were not sure how long they would be willing to avoid health care professionals. participants were not inclined to believe that they could lose some or all of their salaries if a pandemic were to occur. 47% were certain that someone would take care of them and 38% thought that there would probably be someone to take care of them. 75% of participants with children younger than 12 years (total n = 228) claimed they would be able to care for their children themselves, 43% indicated that someone in their household would care for their children. 24% reported that someone outside of their home would care for their children and 18% said that their children would be cared for by someone else at another location. population 18 percentage Gender Male 48 50 Female 52 50 Age 18-29 15 19 30-39 17 18 40-49 20 20 50-59 18 18 > 60 30 25 Education Low 32 33 Moderate 36 41 High 32 25 Knowledge about an influenza pandemic Prior to the provision of the definition. 21% indicated having been completely familiar with the information, 38% were mostly familiar, 18% were somewhat familiar, 12% were vaguely familiar and 12% were not at all familiar with the information. only 5% of participants indicated being constantly scared that an influenza pandemic will occur. 35% reported being afraid sometimes, 44% rarely and 15% never. correlations between threat appraisal variables showed relatively low coefficients. 44% claimed that they would probably be willing, 13% indicated that they would probably not be willing, 2% were certain that they would certainly wear a face mask. 56% indicated probably, 10% probably not, 1% certainly not and 5% indicated that they were unsure. only 4% agreed completely with the statement and 8% agreed mostly. Adaptive responses Avoiding places of entertainment, public transportation and clubs were considered feasible protective measures by more than one third of the participants. Approximately half of the sample was willing to avoid social contact if necessary. 21% were not sure how long they would be willing to avoid health care professionals. information on how to recognize an infection was considered most urgent by 40%. information on how to treat the infection and how the infection is transmitted was considered most urgent by 35% and 33% respectively. participants were not inclined to believe they could potentially lose some or all of their salaries if a pandemic were to occur. 75% of participants with children younger than 12 years (total n = 228) said they would be able to care for their children. 43% indicated someone outside of their home would care for their children. 18% said their children would be cared for by someone else at another location. the perceived susceptibility of an influenza pandemic was relatively low. the perceived severity of an influenza pandemic was quite high. many participants felt that there was little they could to prevent an infection. results of studies conducted prior to the current influenza pandemic have been published. a number of studies focused on risk perceptions and behavioural intentions related to an influenza pandemic have been published. results of studies conducted prior to the current influenza pandemic show that people feel uncomfortable carrying out protective measures themselves. theory of planned behaviour (TPB) [27] suggests there may be beliefs connected to the risky behaviour other than risk or health beliefs. social cognitive theory (SCT) [28] has a strong focus on self efficacy and vicarious learning or modelling and thus would imply that the perceived behaviour of others should be considered. a willingness to follow the recommendations of health professionals was thought to be the most difficult. the information considered most urgent information pertained to protective measures. if a situation arises in which family members need to be taken care of, working hours would likely decrease substantially. the results of this study are derived from a cross-sectional analysis. in reality, changes in the development of the pandemic and the reactions of others may influence people's behavioural responses. messages from health authorities should anticipate this balance between overreacting and underreacting. it is clear that people will want to know what protective measures to take. if measures are in conflict with the measures taken by companies, it is unclear what employees will do. no one knows exactly how many people in the Netherlands you think would get sick if an influenza pandemic were to occur. incredibly well informed Very well informed Reasonably informed Poorly informed Very poorly informed I don't know 6.

Imagine there is a new worldwide influenza pandemic that has also reached the Netherlands. a lot of people fall ill. Only those that are very sick can be admitted to hospitals. a '1' or a '2' and if question 18 was answered affirmatively. 26. Is there someone else in your household that would be able to care for this sick family member? 28. Imagine there is a new worldwide influenza pandemic that has also reached the Netherlands. the government has said that all people infected need to stay home. questions 33 to 39 pertain only to people who live in households that comprise more than one person. Imagine that all schools and child care services close for a month because of the new influenza virus. if all schools and child care services were to close, how much help from people. if a new influenza pandemic were to occur, would you want to use antiviral drugs\" the government has started distributing antiviral drugs to the population but there are not enough drugs for everyone. the government has decided to give these people priority access to antiviral drugs. Certainly Probably Probably not Certainly not I don't know 42. these antiviral drugs are also being offered commercially on, for example, the internet. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o"}
