{"summary": "some biological active peptides act in compliance with other defense mechanisms of plants or mammals. these effects have been studied since 1970s and since then, various therapeutic activities were proposed against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. the mechanisms of peptide action depend on their structure and can be enhanced by modifications of native peptides or chemically synthesized counterparts. the peptides are the candidate therapeutic agents that offer selectivity and specificity. they are predisposed to proteolytic degradation in vivo and are rapidly cleared from the circulation. in the case of influenza virus, the pulmonary delivery route is the simplest way to deliver therapeutic peptides to the target cells. peptides with low hydrophobicity showed no hemolysis even at high concentrations. this could be explained by relatively higher hydrophobicity. antiviral activities of peptides have been studied to treat severe viral disease. only HA molecules that are previously proteolytically cleaved into the HA1 and HA2 glycoproteins are able to mediate the fusion. the interior environment of viral particle is acidified through an ion channel formed by M2 protein, leading to the dissociation of viral matrix protein (M1) from viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. the new viral proteins HA, neuraminidase (NA) and M2 proteins are the influenza virus is an enveloped virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. the viral genome is composed of eight segments of single-stranded negative sense RNA. the viral genome is composed of eight segments of single-stranded negative sense RNA. the newly synthetized viral proteins HA, neuraminidase (NA) and M2 proteins are transported to the nucleus. the protein regulates the pH in endoplasmic reticulum and in transport vesicles during the HA synthesis, trimerization and its transport to the plasma membrane. three main mechanisms of antiviral effects of antiviral peptides are: (i) peptides that inhibit attachment of viruses and virus-cell membrane fusion; (ii) peptides that disrupt the viral envelope; and (iii) peptides that inhibit replication of influenza virus by interacting with viral polymerase. fluPep 7 H1N1 RRKKIFYFFR -helix 5 40 0.15 M [40] FluPep 9 H1N1 FFVIFYRRKK -helix 4 50 0.63 M [40] C18-s2 H1N1, H3N2 C17H35CO-ARLPRTMVHPKPAQP-NH2 - 3 33 11\u201315 M [41] Pal L1 H5N1 C16-ARLPRTMV mic the Peptides Inhibiting Viral Replication Peptide Influenza Serotype Sequence Conformation Net Charge* Hydrophobic Residue* IC50 Reference PB11-25 Broad spectrum MDVNPTLLFLKVPAQNAISTTFPYT -helix 6 35 - [49] PB21-37 H1N1, H5N1 MERIKELRDLMSWSRTREILTKTTVDHMAIIKKYTSG -helix 3 35 375 peptides compete with sialic acid (SA) binding by blocking receptor site of HA. second mechanism involves interference with HA conformation change necessary for viral fusion. fusion of viral and endosomal membranes is blocked and release of RNA to the host cell is prevented. the peptide inhibited chicken red blood cells agglutination with IC50 values ranging from 3 to 20 M. the peptide inhibited chicken red blood cells agglutination with IC50 values ranging from 3 to 20 M in medium containing 1% BSA. p is a mix of predominantly hydrophobic -helical peptides capable of interaction with HA blocking the viral fusion. peptides are derived from Tkip peptide, which is a mimetic for the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein. a variety of influenza subtypes were inhibited by FluPep in nanomolar concentrations in MDCK cells. a special group of peptides against influenza virus are cyclic delta defensins (retrocyclins), formed by coupling of N- and C-terminal domains. their occurrence has been described in primates [43,45]. previous studies have shown their ability to inhibit HIV virus by their ability to bind to HIV surface protein and the similar mechanism is supposed for influenza virus. peptide-membrane interactions are mediated by electrostatic interactions. membrane disruption can be accomplished by different means. cathelicidins are human antiviral peptides that can disrupt viral envelope. bovine lactoferrin was found as a possible agent with an ability to disrupt the virus envelope. three sequences derived from lactoferrin, SKHSSLDCVLRP, AGDDQGLDKCVPNSKEK, and NGESSADWAKN, inhibit influenza virus activity at femtomolar concentrations. the liposomes could be used to preserve peptide drugs through tissues transport. peptide aggregation on lipid bilayer surface and subsequent perpendicular permeation through lipid bilayer by transmembrane potential change. results showed that reaching a threshold peptide concentration followed by mass removal includes the release of lipids, probably as lipid-melittin complex, and the leakage of vesicle components [84] is crucial. mucroporin-M1 analogues represents a practical tool for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents. peptides insert into lipid bilayer (I.) due to electrostatic interactions positively charged peptides are attracted by lipid bilayer with negative charge. the critical concentration of peptides triggers the lipid bilayer disruption. interaction between PB1 and PA/PB2 is a promising target for design of new anti-influenza drugs. many authors have used PB1-derived peptides in order to interfere with polymerase function of the enzyme.
