{"summary": "smoking is the single most important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases (CVPD) smokers are two to four times more likely to develop CVPD than nonsmokers (132a, 73). nicotine inhalation devices are becoming popular among young adults and youths (135) the RAS is a peptide hormone system composed of several enzymes and inactive and active peptides. local systems contributing to specific organ functions have been described for every major organ and tissue (3, 15, 37, 40, 42, 64, 66, 87, 110, 145) the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is the primary receptor that mediates most of the effects of ANG II. ACE2 plays a pivotal role in compensatory ACE2/ANG-(1\u20137)/MasR axis of the RAS. ANG II can also be converted to angiotensin A by mononuclear leukocyte-derived aspartate decarboxylase, leading to the formation of alamandine. cigarette smoking or nicotine inhalation in human volunteers led to acute increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (16, 54, 56) and increased plasma ACE activity (54), indicating the involvement of the RAS. a well-controlled study in human monozygotic twins showed the presence of higher plasma renin activity and elevated plasma aldosterone levels in the smoking twin. smokers were found to have impaired venodilation in response to bradykinin. infusion of enalaprilat restored bradykinin-induced relaxation in smokers. vascular RAS may play a key role in smoking-induced endothelial dysfunction. studies of the effects of e-cig on BP are limited. e-cig inhalation preferentially increased resting and exercise diastolic BP 40 min following nicotine inhalation. a recent prospective prospective prospective 3.5-yr observational study by Polosa et al. (112) found no change in systolic or diastolic BP compared with healthy never smokers and non-e-cig users. methylation-specific PCR using aortic rings showed decreased methylation in the promoter regions of AT1R. increased methylation in the promoter region of AT2R (141, 143), consistent with increased AT1R and decreased AT2R mRNA expression. perinatal nicotine exposure enhanced ANG II-induced BP response and vascular contraction similarly as in male offspring. cigarette smoke increased VO-induced left ventricular dilatation, prevented compensatory wall thickening, and depressed fractional shortening. both cigarette smoke extract and nicotine increased cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in rat fibroblasts. the effects were mediated through 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. e-cig inhalation did not alter left ventricular function in healthy e-cig users. both nicotine and the RAS have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and abdominal aortic aneurysms. mice coadministered with nicotine and ANG II had increased incidence of AAA. increased expression of MMP-2/9 and proinflammatory chemokines. the interaction between nicotine exposure and components of the RAS has long been recognized. antagonist was found to reduce arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients. smokers were found to have stiffer arteries before treatment. irbesartan was able to reduce arterial stiffness to a greater extent in smokers. e-cig inhalation preferentially increased both resting and exercise diastolic BP 40 min following nicotine inhalation. in a population of healthy e-cig users who had never smoked conventional cigarettes, no change in systolic or diastolic BP compared with healthy never smokers and non-e-cig users. perinatal nicotine exposure increased AT1R but decreased AT2R protein expression in the aorta of adult male offspring, resulting in an imbalance of the AT1R/AT2R ratio in favor of the vasoconstrictor component. perinatal nicotine exposure enhanced ANG II-induced BP response and vascular contraction similarly as in male offspring. cigarette smoke increased VO-induced left ventricular dilatation, prevented compensatory wall thickening, and depressed fractional shortening (11). both cigarette smoke extract and nicotine increased cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in rat fibroblasts. e-cig inhalation did not alter left ventricular function in healthy e-cig users. both nicotine and the RAS have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and abdominal aortic aneurysms. mice coadministered with nicotine and ANG II had increased incidence of AAA accompanied by increased expression of MMP-2/9 and proinflammatory chemokines. a well-controlled study in human monozygotic twins showed the presence of higher plasma renin activity and elevated plasma aldosterone levels compared with the nonsmoking twin. increased ACE activity also contributes to impaired vascular relaxation. increased vascular metabolism of bradykinin (another function of ACE) takes place in veins of smokers. in young healthy nonsmokers, acute inhalation of e-cig vapor increases both systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate (24) e-cig inhalation preferentially increased resting and exercise diastolic BP 40 min following nicotine inhalation. perinatal nicotine significantly increased arterial media thickness and potentiated ANG II-induced contractions of aorta and mesenteric artery. perinatal nicotine exposure increased AT1R but decreased AT2R protein expression in the aorta of adult male offspring, resulting in an imbalance of the AT1R/AT2R ratio in favor of the vasoconstrictor component. othelial cells, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes express AT1R and AT2R. ACE2 is expressed primarily in vascular endothelial cells (31, 46, 58, 128) the expression of AT2R is low in the healthy heart. effects were mediated through 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. dependent on protein kinase C (PKC)-/ and reduced p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. possible cardiotoxic interaction between nicotine and the RAS was also demonstrated in a mouse model of systemic hypertension. NICOTINE AND THE RAS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Nicotine acts in the brain by binding to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. nicotinic receptors are virtually ubiquitous throughout the central nervous system and play an important excitatory role in autonomic ganglia. a specific mechanism by which nicotine could influence autonomic nuclei is through interaction with the brain RAS (145) a specific mechanism by which nicotine could influence autonomic nuclei is through interaction with the brain RAS (145). a specific mechanism by which nicotine could influence autonomic nuclei is through interaction with the brain RAS. nicotine treatment resulted in increased expression of AT1R but decreased expression of ACE2. these nicotine effects were greater in cells isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (43, 44) nicotine has been shown to induce the synthesis and release of norepinephrine/epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. a reduction of baroreflex sensitivity in response to ANG II infusion was observed in rats with prior in utero nicotine exposure. increased AT1R and decreased AT2R expression were observed in whole brain extracts from fetal and adult offspring rats that had been subject to perinatal nicotine exposure. both ACE2 and MasR are expressed by bronchial epithelial cells (75, 150), while alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and VSMCs are also positive for ACE2 (59) Nicotine has been shown to increase the expression and/or activity of ACE in the lung. the arteriole expression of ACE is consistent with the hypothesis that locally increased production of ANG II contributes to the process of pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. in chronic cigarette smoke-induced PAH in rats, ANG II level in the lung was increased with increased expression of ACE and decreased expression of ACE2 (60, 148) in patients with COPD, there was a five to sixfold increase in the ratio of AT1R to AT2R in regions of marked fibrosis surrounding the bronchioles. in a cigarette smoke-induced murine COPD model, administration of ANG-(1\u20137) reduced cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammatory responses and lung fibrosis, and these effects were accompanied by increased expression of MasR. an excellent set of guidelines on nicotine dose selection for in vivo research has been published by Matta et al.
