{"summary": "fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by persistent fatigue, diffuse myalgia, weakness, depression, and nonrestorative sleep with associated REM-related apneas/hypopneas. post-SARS patients had symptoms of pre and post-sleep fatigue and post sleep sleepiness similar to the symptoms of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. the long-term adverse effects of severe acute infectious global health problem are unknown. the disease emerged from south east Asia in early 2003 as the first contemporary novel severe acute infectious global health problem. a province-wide emergency was declared on march 26th, 2003. post-SARS patients remained disabled and unable to return to work. they complained of persistent physical symptoms including musculoskeletal pain, profound weakness, easy fatigability, shortness of breath that accompanied psychological distress. we examined their sleep physiology and coincident psychological symptoms. the SAQ is a 17-item questionnaire that has been found to be useful for identifying sleep disorders related to chronic fatigue. one overnight polysomnography was employed in order to objectively evaluate sleep physiology. the procedures included electroencephalogram (EEG C3, C4) electro-oculogram, submental and bilateral anterior tibialis electromyogram, single anterior lead electrocardiogram, measures of respiration. we compared the self ratings of pain, fatigue and sleepiness symptoms and objective indices of overnight sleep physiology to 21 drug free female patients. they had participated in a double blind placebo-controlled drug trial, to which they had provided their ethics approved consent. only the initial overnight pre-treatment sleep study was employed for the purposes of comparison with this post-SARS chronically ill patient population. for the 21 patients that completed the PCL-C, the mean score was 40.75 +/- 10.26. two patients had scores of 50 or more that would be suggestive of the symptoms seen in patients with PTSD [24]. Table 1. Sleep in SARS vs. Healthy Controls Sleep Parameter SARS Healthy Controls Significance Mean (SD) Mean(SD) P Sleep onset latency ( min.) 24.13 (21.63) 29.34(31.48) n.s. Total sleep physiology in post-SARS group showed more arousal disturbances. alpha EEG sleep disorder consists of the anomalous appearance of the EEG alpha frequency (7.5-12 Hz) in approximately 50% of sleep. there was more stage 2 NonREM sleep and a delay in onset to REM sleep. all patients were seen by clinical psychologists unless they declined to do so, and psychiatric consultation was available to all if requested by the patient or other team members. both groups had a similar measure of sleep instability as indicated by the high cyclical alternating pattern rate. stage 4% 6.27 (5.80) 9.53 (6.18) n.s.

Periodic leg movements ( no. 107 patients from a group of 50 chronically ill survivors of SARS continued to describe problems with pain, reduced vitality, physical, mental, and social functioning. only 14 (13%) were asymptomatic, leaving 93 patients symptomatic, where 18 (17%) had not returned to work, and 10 (9%) had returned to modified work. patients with post-febrile chronic fatigue, variable nonspecific myalgia, depression and sleep disturbances are similar to those experienced by patients with post-febrile Chronic Fatigue syndrome (CFS) [31] and Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) [32]. post-SARS patients seem to be similar to the post-SARS patients where their focus is on fatigue symptoms rather than the pain. similar unrefreshing sleep, fatigue and musculoskeletal pain symptoms occur in healthy people who have been experimentally exposed to several nights of frequent noise induced disruption of slow wave sleep. similar unrefreshing sleep, fatigue and behavioral symptoms occur in healthy people who have been experimentally exposed to several nights of frequent noise induced disruption. chronic post-SARS is characterized by persistent fatigue, diffuse myalgia, weakness, depression, and nonrestorative sleep with associated REM-related apneas/hypopneas and alpha EEG sleep disorder. chronic post-SARS is characterized by persistent fatigue, diffuse myalgia, weakness, depression, and nonrestorative sleep with associated REM-related apneas. d sleep, chronic fatigue and somatic symptoms of chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia syndrome. authors had a physician-patient relationship with all patients in this study. both authors read and approved the final draft. for sleep and Chronobiology and St. John's Rehabilitation Hospital. we wish to thank all the post-SARS patients who gave permission."}
