{"summary": "mammalian hosts have a long evolutionary history with the diverse communities of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. the intestinal biome was traditionally viewed as a rather inert species assembly. recent insights have revealed that its composition is influenced by host traits and that it in turn can have a considerable impact on its host. the bacterial microbiome influences host nutrition, fat storage and the metabolism of vitamins and minerals. the bacterial microbiome influences host nutrition, fat storage and the metabolism of vitamins and minerals. me of the intestine can affect postnatal development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. bacterially derived fermentation products from the intestinal microbiome help regulate the maturation of microglia which contribute to an active immune defense of the central nervous system. there is now general agreement that the bacterial microbiome influences the host immune system. social status is also likely to affect the species composition and abundance of bacteria and eukaryotes in the gastrointestinal tract. we applied a multi-amplicon sequencing approach for bacteria and eukaryotes to fresh feces to investigate the effect of social status and age on the intestinal bacterial microbiome and eukaryome. high-ranking females are more often exposed to infectious pathogens than low-ranking females. high-ranking females have lower intestinal parasite burdens than low-ranking females. we expect the bacterial microbiome and the eukaryome of high-ranking animals to be less diverse than those of high-ranking animals. spotted hyena (hereafter hyena) population included three closely monitored clans. individuals were recognized by their spot patterns, ear notches, scars and bald patches. animals were categorized as juveniles when 24 months of age. aliquots were stored in formalin (4%) for parasite egg counts. DNA was extracted using the Macherey-Nagel soil DNA extraction kit. a strong relationship between the two was demonstrated for freshly collected samples. morphology and counted using a light microscope, 1 h after preparing the fecal suspension, with a magnification of 100x (10x eyepiece lens 10x objective lens) images were captured using the software ProgRes CapturePro version 2.5, 2007 (Jenoptik, Jena, Germany) eukaryote parasites were identified at the genus or family level on the basis of their morphology and size. target specific primer pairs were combined with \u201cCS1\u201d and \u201cCS2\u201d adapters at their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, respectively, on the microfluidics device. target specific primer pairs were used to prime 48 target specific reactions for each of 48 samples. a second PCR was performed on a 10-fold dilution. miSeq machine (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) using version 3 chemistry and 600 cycles of (paired-end) sequencing. sequencing data can be accessed through the accession number PRJNA386767 at NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) technical replicates for which PCRs failed were identified by hierarchical clustering of primer-stratified read numbers, with water as negative controls, and marked for exclusion. all taxonomic assignments were done blind with respect to the life history stages and characteristics of the individual hyenas from which the fecal sample was taken and analyzed. data were merged across different amplicons via taxonomic annotation. this excludes genera not annotated at the genus level. we also excluded genera annotated as the only genus in their respective phylum and genera with an undefined phylum annotation. al sequence reads and FEC or FOC for the highest or second highest Spearman correlation coefficients. we also constructed linear models using (1+log10) transformed data. we used rarefaction instead of normalization for diversity estimates. here MDS uses pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (Bray and Curtis, 1957) on transformed data of sequence abundances per genus. the same transformed data partial least squares (PLS) models were used as a supervised machine learning technique. DESeq was used to test for differences in the abundance of individual genera between age and rank categories. the function estimated \u201csize factors\u201d to address differences in sequencing depth between different samples. these factors were then used as offset when a mean abundance was fitted for each taxon. females holding standardized ranks with 0 or above 0 were categorized as high-ranking, those holding a standardized rank of less than 0 as low ranking. aliquots were stored in formalin (4%) for parasite egg counts and preserved in RNAlater for molecular genetic analyses. a solution of potassium iodide (KI) was used with a specific weight of 1.5 g ml1. four McMaster chambers were counted for each sample with a dilution factor of 1:15. after combining the feces with the KI solution, it was vortexed for 3 min and then sieved to remove bigger debris. the results are expressed as fecal egg counts per g feces (FEC) or fecal oocyst counts per g feces (FOC) all egg and oocyst counts were done blind with respect to the life history stages and characteristics of the individual hyenas. PCR fragments between 400 and 1,000 bp were purified by PippinPrep using the 1.5% agarose DNA gel cassettes. suitability of PCR products for sequencing was confirmed using the Agilent 2200 Tape Station with D1000 ScreenTapes and D1000 Reagents. sequencing data can be accessed through the accession number PRJNA386767 at NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) the multiAmplicon package was used as a wrapper to process identified amplicons. sequences were dereplicated, forward and reverse reads were concatenated. a table of RSV occurrence was collated for each sample. eukaryotic 18S sequences in our study system were used in an assignment of the taxonomy levels \u201cphylum,\u201d \u201cclass,\u201d \u201corder,\u201d \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cgenus\u201d to each of our RSVs. problems arose because of an incongruence between the taxonomic systems of SILVA and NCBI. the strongest correlations were then screened for taxonomic agreement. the highest positive correlations always contained the target taxa as defined by the observed morphology. hyenas are high-ranking and low-ranking using the exact version of the Mann-Whitney U test in the package coin version 1.1-2 (Hothorn et al., 2006) to obtain appropriate p-values for small sample sizes and in presence of ties. this technique has previously been highly successful in summarizing similarly complex data sets. fish's exact test from R base tested highest and lowest quartile of loadings on the single PLS axis of the model addressing rank category differences in the eukaryome. the function estimated \u201csize factors\u201d to address differences in sequencing depth between different samples. taxonomic diversity of hyena intestinal biomes We identified 201 genera (3,725 RSVs) of bacteria as constituents of the bacterial microbiome of the hyena. the number of genera annotated varied greatly between phyla of both bacteria and eukaryotes. bacteria and eukaryotes recorded from the intestinal biome of the spotted hyena as extracted by amplicon sequencing of fecal samples. number of sequencing reads Bacteria Microbiome 3,559/*3,725 201/*202 768,581/*807,654 Actinobacteria Microbiome 184 24 14,690 Bacteroidetes Microbiome 787 20 328,848 Firmicutes Microbiome 2,073 11 ukaryome 39 4 1,869 Nematoda Eukaryome (parasites) 1,431 36 380,347 Neocallimastigomycota Passing material 337 6 25,520 Ochrophyta Passing material 337 6 25,520 Ochrophyta Passing material 337 6 25,520 Parabasalia Eukaryome 29 3 131 Peronosporomycetes Passing material 11 3 52 Phragmoplastophyta Undetermined role DNA sequences from the phylum Chordata were most likely originating from hyena food items (Table 1).
