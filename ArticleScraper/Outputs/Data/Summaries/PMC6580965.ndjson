{"summary": "in this recent epidemic, the virus has manifested in severe congenital malformations in the fetus (7, 8) and in Guillain-Barre syndrome in susceptible populations (9, 10). the virus is a reemerging flavivirus primarily carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. it is responsible for a recent outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean. vector saliva released during an infectious blood meal is capable of increasing the severity of infection for a variety of arthropod-borne viruses (26\u201330) specific components in mosquito saliva have been identified that enhance, as well as some that decrease, viral replication and pathogenesis in the flaviviruses dengue and west Nile virus (WNV) plasmid library was transfected into yeast cells to create a yeast display library expressing A. aegypti salivary gland proteins expressed under resting conditions (Ae-YD library) mice were fed on by 50 to 100 A. aegypti mosquitoes five times over the course of 10 weeks to allow them to develop a robust antibody response against saliva proteins. rabbit antiserum was raised against these proteins in salivary gland extract and recombinant form. a yeast display library was created from RNA transcripts of the A. aegypti mosquito. plasmids are extracted from sorted and validated yeast clones. anti-mosquito SG protein rabbit serum using Western blotting against the corresponding recombinant A (LOC5578631; NeSt1), B (LOC5578630), C (LOC5580040), D (LOC5580038), or E (LOC5567956) protein. most SG proteins showed no effect on primary neutrophils ex vivo. but one SG protein, LOC5578631, induced the expression of pro-IL-1 (Fig. 3A), CXCL2 (Fig. 3B) and CCL2 (Fig. 3C) this protein did not activate the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. this protein was used as a positive control to stimulate naive neutrophils. AW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells were treated with recombinant NeSt1 protein or BSA. after 3 h of stimulation, RNA was isolated from cells, cDNA was generated, and qPCR was used to measure IL-1 (A) and CXCL2 expression. the data were normalized to mouse -actin with the CT method. mice were passively immunized with preimmune rabbit sera or rabbit sera against NeSt1 protein. after 24 h, mosquitoes were allowed to bite the right ear (bitten) and the left ear was left alone (naive) no differences were detected between the two groups. the percentage of macrophages in the bitten ear was increased in the control group (Fig. 7C and D) the percentage of dendritic cells (DCs) was decreased after mosquito bites in the control group. the difference observed here could be due to an increase in macrophages at the bite site. five-week-old mice were passively immunized with preimmune rabbit sera or rabbit sera against NeSt1 protein. after 24 h, mosquitoes were allowed to bite the right ear (bitten) and the left ear was left alone (naive) three hours later, the draining lymph nodes were removed. the Ifnr1/ Ifnr\u2013/\u2013 (AG129) mouse model is acutely susceptible to ZIKV infection. we passively immunized AG129 mice with sera from NeSt1-immune rabbits. the mice that were passively immunized against NeSt1 showed significantly lower viral titers by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. four- to six-week-old AG129 mice were passively immunized with preimmune sera or sera against the NeSt1 protein. the level of ZIKV in infected mosquito salivary glands was measured by qRT-PCR after mouse infection. the average number of mosquitoes fed on each mouse was counted. mice were fed on by 50 to 100 A. aegypti mosquitoes five times over the course of 10 weeks to develop a robust antibody response against saliva proteins. purified IgG antibodies were used as bait in a magnetic-activated cell sorting assay using an autoMACs sorter. a yeast display library was created from RNA transcripts of the A. aegypti mosquito. plasmids were cloned into the pYD1 plasmid, which induces cell surface expression of these proteins upon growth in a specific medium. plasmids are extracted from sorted and validated yeast clones. inant A (LOC5578631; NeSt1), B (LOC5578630), C (LOC5580040), D (LOC5580038), or E (LOC5567956) protein. %Hits is the percentage of isolated enriched yeast clones. SG protein, LOC5578631, induced the expression of pro-IL-1 (Fig. 3A), CXCL2 (Fig. 3B), and CCL2 (Fig. 3C) this protein did not activate the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. this protein was used as a positive control to stimulate naive neutrophils. in the future we will refer to this protein as neutrophil-stimulating factor 1 (NeSt1) qPCR was used to measure IL-1 (A) and CXCL2 (B) expression. the data were normalized to mouse -actin with the CT method. n = 10 technical replicates from at least two independent biological replicates for each protein. cDNA was generated, and qPCR was used to measure IL-1 (A), CXCL2 (B) or CCL2 (C) expression. the data were normalized to mouse -actin with the CT method. mice treated with NeSt1 antisera did not experience this change in macrophage and dendritic cell percentages. difference observed here could be due to an increase in macrophages at the bite site or an exfiltration of DCs to the draining lymph node after a mosquito bite. mosquitoes were allowed to bite the right ear (bitten), and the left ear was left alone (naive). three hours later, the draining lymph nodes were removed, and neutrophils (A), macrophages (C), and dendritic cells (D) were assessed using flow cytometry. AG129 mice were passively immunized with sera from NeSt1-immune rabbits. they were able to feed to engorgement on the same mice. early in infection, on day 1 after the mosquito bite, the mice showed significantly lower viral titers by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) the level of ZIKV in infected mosquito salivary glands was measured by qRT-PCR after mouse infection. the average number of mosquitoes fed on each mouse was counted. antigenic mosquito salivary gland protein NeSt1 is able to significantly enhance ZIKV infection through the activation of neutrophils and recruitment of macrophages at the bite site. protein in mosquito saliva can modulate host responses, including coagulation, platelet aggregation, thrombin activation, and vasodilation. a protein, LTRIN, in mosquito saliva interferes with the lymphotoxin receptor at the bite site, inhibiting NF-B signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines. the antigen-presenting cells in the skin are also thought to play a large role in the early replication of these viruses. nonneutralizing antibodies could present a particularly problematic issue for flaviviruses like ZIKV. a previously undescribed mosquito salivary gland protein is capable of enhancing ZIKV pathogenesis by stimulating neutrophils. this changes the immune microenvironment at the mosquito bite site and increases viral replication early on in infection. a Mexican strain of Zika virus, MEX2-81 (accession number KX446950), was used for this study. mosquitoes were kept on 10% sucrose feeders inside a 12-by 12-in metal mesh cage. cDNAs were directionally cloned in the yeast expression vector pYD1 (invitrogen, CA) to generate a salivary gland expression library. the total number of primary clones in the pYD1-salivary gland library is >1 million. autoMACS column (Mitenyi Biotec; 130-021-101) was used with the autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec; 130-021-101) to identify individual antigenic SG protein clones. enriched yeast display library was plated onto an SDCCA agarose plate. individual clones were picked, grown, and induced. eluted samples were filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size filter and concentrated with a 10-kDa concentrator (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C, washed, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) rabbit sera against recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by using a Pierce microplate BCA protein assay zyme activity was detected by incubation with 100 l of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine solution (KPL) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M H2SO4. for immunoblotting, recombinant SG proteins, BSA, or salivary gland extracts were resolved using SDS-PAGE. a single cell suspension of bone marrow was overlaid on a Histopaque gradient. the sample was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. a disposable sterile transfer pipette was used to remove neutrophils. AG129 mice were passively immunized with either NeSt1 or naive antiserum 24 h prior to allowing naive A. aegypti mosquitoes to feed on one ear. three hours later, the mice were sacrificed, and both bitten and unbitten (naive) ears were cut off at the base. small pieces were digested for 1.5 h in 2 mg/ml of Dispase II (Sigma) in DMEM plus 10% FBS. the cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD45. infected mosquitoes were placed back in paper cups with mesh lids. salivary glands were dissected to examine the virus levels. mice were fed on by three to five ZIKV-infected mosquitoes.
