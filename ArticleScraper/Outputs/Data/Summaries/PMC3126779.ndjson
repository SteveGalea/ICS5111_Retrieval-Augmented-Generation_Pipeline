{"summary": "nucleoli carry out ribosome biogenesis and sequester or associate with key molecules that regulate cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, apoptosis and the stress response. nucleoli are dynamic compartments that are characterized by a constant flux of macromolecules. nucleoli carry out ribosome biogenesis and sequester or associate with key molecules that regulate cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, apoptosis and the stress response. nucleoli are characterized by a constant flux of macromolecules, in part due to their shuttling between nucleoli and the surrounding nucleoplasm. advanced fluorescence microscopy and photobleaching techniques revealed the highly dynamic nature of the nucleolus. the isolation of nucleoli from lysed nuclei by density gradient centrifugation may be complicated by cross-contamination with components that share a similar density or associate with nucleoli. these difficulties instigate the demand for additional techniques that can be combined with proteomic studies and generate new insights into the structural and functional organization of nucleoli. to overcome this obstacle, we present several different methods that measure pixel intensities in nucleoli. these procedures depend on recent advancements in computer-based image analysis and do not require a specific nucleolar marker protein. two groups of procedures demarcate the nucleolar compartment (Figure 2). the first group (Methods 1-3) is based on a method that stains the nucleoplasm, but excludes nucleoli. the second group (Methods 4, 5) relies on the distribution of the molecule of interest. method 1 takes advantage of the fluorescence pattern obtained upon incubating cells with DAPI. nucleoli are identified as dark holes where fluorescence intensities are low. images are acquired by techniques that are compatible with computer-based image analyses. results for individual nucleoli labeled with numbers are listed in the table. we applied these steps to measure nucleolar pixel intensities in transfected cells. nucleoli can be discriminated from the surrounding nucleoplasm by the decline in DAPI fluorescence. results for nucleoli labeled in red (2, 4, 5, 9) are displayed in Figure 3d. method provides alternative solution when multiple fluorochromes are used simultaneously. reliance on a single nuclear marker may not be sufficient to identify nucleoli. the identification of nucleoli is more accurate for Method 3 when compared to Method 1 or 2. we used DAPI combined with Pol II staining to quantify the pixel intensities for the nucleolar protein RPA194 (a subunit of RNA polymerase I) we chose RPA194 for the quantification because it is not uniformly distributed in nucleoli. nucleoli can be identified with the Detect light holes filter. the fluorescence intensity in the defined area will be measured. the concentration of proteins B23 and fibrillarin in the nucleolus is regulated by stress. fluorescence intensities were measured for all nucleoli. it was determined whether nucleolar fluorescence is different in control and stressed cells. the same binning was applied to control and stressed samples for each protein. the differences between control and heat-treated cells in Figure 5 are not suitable for a high throughput screening assay. however, the results demonstrate that small, but statistically significant, changes can be detected with our protocols under the conditions described for Figure 5. we examined whether heat stress altered the nucleolar/nuclear ratio of B23. nucleoli can be identified with the Pol II image in heat-shocked cells. stress may alter the DAPI staining and may therefore not be useful as the sole reference to demarcate the nucleolus. nucleus was 12.8% for control and 10.2% for heat-shocked cells. variability was higher for fibrillarin (27.3% for control cells; 31.3% for heat-shocked cells; Figure 5). quantitative information on changes in GFP-hsc70 nucleolar concentration can be gained with the protocols designed by us. in transiently transfected cells the nucleolar accumulation of GFP-hsc70 significantly changes during the recovery from heat stress. nucleoli are prominently labeled with this technique [27]. the method was applied to label RNA with 5-ethynyluridine (EU) and Alexa Fluor488. the quantification of pixel intensities was carried out for 44 cells. the X-axis depicts individual nucleoli. the sum of nucleolar pixel intensity/sum of nucleolar area is shown for each nucleus. cells were incubated with EU as described for part a. the nucleoli were identified with the DAPI image or a combination of DAPI and RNA Pol II images. the nucleoli were identified with the DAPI image; Detect dark holes and Median filters were applied. additional file 5a presents a step-by-step application of the method described in Figure 3. results are obtained for the area and fluorescence intensity of individual nucleoli. the software then obtains data for each individual nucleolus. cells were grown in 96-well plates and incubated with compounds that affect ribosome biogenesis. the compounds tested by us included actinomycin D, MG132, methotrexate, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and cycloheximide. for each condition the total number of nucleoli was divided by the number of cells. the results were normalized to DMSO-treated samples. compared to control samples, a drastic decrease in nucleolar fluorescence was observed for actinomycin D, roscovitine, DRB and cycloheximide. a decrease in the nucleolar area was induced by actinomycin D, roscovitine, DRB and cycloheximide. la cells were incubated with the vehicle DMSO or actinomycin D (Act D) the percentage of nucleoli that are smaller than 4 m2 was measured. the HTS assay scored the changes in nucleolar organization based on fibrillarin distribution. the different protocols developed by us accommodate a wide variety of experimental settings. they measure nucleolar pixel intensities for GFP-tagged reporter proteins, immunostained endogenous proteins and de novo synthesized RNA. these protocols measure nucleolar fluorescence in multiple steps that involve three main operations. the key step in the quantification process is the identification of nucleoli. the first group (Methods 1-3) is based on a method that stains the nucleoplasm, but excludes nucleoli. the second group (Methods 4, 5) relies on the distribution of the molecule of interest. the molecule of interest is visualized with a probe that can be distinguished from the DAPI stain. the molecule of interest is visualized with a probe that can be distinguished from the DAPI stain. images are acquired by techniques compatible with computer-based image analyses. nucleoli can be discriminated from the surrounding bright nucleoplasm by the decline in DAPI fluorescence (DAPI image) the software creates segments that represent nucleoli. the nucleoli segments are overlaid with the DAPI image. method combines information from the DAPI as well as Pol II images to identify nucleoli. arithmetic Add function is applied to DAPI and Pol II images to better demarcate nucleoli. the pixel intensities/area obtained for the nucleolar protein RPA194 was defined as 100%. using DAPI and the Detect dark holes filter, 67% of the pixel intensities were measured. the quantification based on Pol II and the Detect dark holes filter measured 74% of the fluorescence signal. the DAPI image is employed to locate nucleoli. dark holes in the DAPI image are detected with the Detect dark holes filter. the median filter image serves as a compartment image to identify nucleoli. the software creates segments that represent nucleoli. the nucleolar compartments are overlaid with the DAPI image (Figure 3c) and with the probe image after it has undergone statistical correction for background fluorescence. results for nucleoli labeled in red are displayed in Figure 3d. rithmetic Add function is applied to DAPI and Pol II images. nucleoli are detected with the Detect dark holes and Median filters. the identification of nucleoli is more accurate for Method 3 when compared to Method 1 or 2. method 3 reduces the number of additional fluorochromes that can be employed in the same experiment. pixel intensities in nucleoli are lower or higher than in the surrounding nucleoplasm. cleoli have been delimited, fluorescence intensity will be measured. the concentration of proteins B23 and fibrillarin in the nucleolus is regulated by stress. control and heat-shocked cells shown in Figure 1 were used to measure pixel intensities in nucleoli. single cell analysis shows nucleolar fluorescence intensities/area for individual nuclei. results are shown for individual nuclei; each line represents the measurement for the sum of nucleoli of one nucleus of control (blue lines) or heat-shocked cells (red lines) data were not normalized. the differences between control and heat-treated cells in Figure 5 are not suitable for a high throughput screening assay. however, the results demonstrate that small, but statistically significant changes can be detected with our protocols under the conditions described for Figure 5. we examined whether heat stress altered the nucleolar/nuclear ratio of B23 or fibrillarin. in addition file 3 we subjected HeLa cells to heat shock and determined the distribution of Pol II by indirect immunofluorescence. the staining pattern obtained for Pol II was useful to define the nucleolar compartment under these conditions. pol II is not suitable as a universal marker for nucleoli. nucleoli were identified in (a) MCF7 and (b) NIH3T3 cells using the methods shown in Figure 3 for HeLa cells. the unique DAPI staining pattern for NIH3T3 nuclei does not interfere with the quantification protocol. quantitative information on changes in GFP-hsc70 nucleolar concentration can be gained with the protocols designed by us. hsc70 accumulates in nucleoli during the recovery from heat stress. the results for nucleolar fluorescence are shown as means + STDEV. nucleolar fluorescence was quantified by the identification of bright holes in the probe image. original results for nucleolar intensity/area are depicted for individual nucleoli, the sum for all nucleoli within a particular nucleus and the nucleolar/nuclear intensity. /nuclear intensity was calculated for each nucleus. cells were incubated with EU as described for part a. DNA was stained with DAPI. nucleoli were identified based on the EU image. the same image was used to identify nucleoli based on the DAPI staining. different filters were employed to demarcate the nucleolar region. similar values are obtained with both protocols for each nucleolus. the software then obtains data for each individual nucleolus in the probe image. the software then obtains data for each individual nucleolus in the probe image. the software then obtains data for each individual nucleolus in the probe image. the compounds tested by us included actinomycin D, MG132, methotrexate, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), roscovitine and cycloheximide. control cells were incubated with DMSO or water. the effects of drugs on the pixel intensity (d) and nucleolar area (e) were measured. data obtained for water and cycloheximide were compared by Student's t-test. compared to control samples, a drastic decrease in nucleolar fluorescence was observed for actinomycin D, roscovitine, DRB and cycloheximide. a decrease in the nucleolar area was induced by actinomycin D, roscovitine, DRB and cycloheximide. cleoli that are smaller than 4 m2 was measured. on the basis of these results a Z factor of 0.57 was calculated. the HTS assay scored the changes in nucleolar organization based on fibrillarin distribution. we demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques by monitoring the dynamic association of proteins B23 and fibrillarin with nucleoli under different physiological conditions. we showed the usefulness of our protocols to detect proteins in nucleoli that are fused to a fluorescent reporter, and to quantify newly synthesized RNA that is associated with nucleoli. confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 with a 63x magnification (NA = 1.4) at scan speed 5, with a pixel scanning time of 6.4 sec. images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 with a 63x magnification (NA = 1.4) at scan speed 5. morphology filters can be applied to 12/16 bit as well as binary images. Detect dark holes identifies regions of low fluorescence intensities when nuclei are stained with DAPI (or other suitable markers) morphology filter Detect light holes identifies nucleoli when fluorescence is more concentrated in nucleoli than in the surrounding nucleoplasm. nucleoli are then defined as regions of high fluorescence intensities. add function This operation combines two images by adding their pixel intensities for pixels that are in corresponding positions. the median filter will not decrease pixel values for noise to 0, objects with dimensions and fluorescence intensity similar to the nucleoli may generate false positives. to prevent the analysis of false positives, the proper identification should be verified by visual inspection. the Statistical correction image (the probe image after correction for background staining) and the segments. Arrows point to the objects that are missing when the Erode/dilate filter operation is applied, but are identified when the Median filter is used. it should be emphasized that for both the Median and Erode/dilate filters it is important that settings are adjusted to optimize the proper identification of nucleoli. confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 with a 63x magnification (NA = 1.4) at scan speed 5, with a pixel scanning time of 6.4 sec. cells were grown on poly-L-lysine coated cover slips and exposed to heat shock. images were collected with an ImageXpress Micro equipped with a 40x objective (NA = 0.60) and a CoolSnap HQ camera. exposure times were 20 ms for DAPI and 5 sec for TRITC. following drugs were tested for their effect on the distribution of fibrillarin. the morphology filter Detect dark holes identifies nucleoli when fluorescence is more concentrated in nucleoli than in the surrounding nucleoplasm. the nucleoli are then defined as regions of high fluorescence intensities. the resulting Add image (16 bit) serves as a source image to identify nucleoli with the Detect dark holes filter. de/dilate filter removes background noise by replacing each pixel intensity with the local median intensity. this procedure reduces, but does not eliminate completely, noise in the processed image. the Dilate filter uses the same principle as the Erode filter. but it assigns to black pixels the value 1 (white) depending on the number of white pixels in the neighborhood. the filters were applied to the same original images. morphology filter Detect dark holes identifies regions of low fluorescence intensities when nuclei are stained with DAPI. application of the Detect dark holes filter defines nucleoli as small objects. nucleoli appear as bright objects in the nucleus. Detect light holes The morphology filter Detect light holes identifies nucleoli when fluorescence is more concentrated in nucleoli than in the surrounding nucleoplasm. the nucleoli are then defined as regions of high fluorescence intensities. the nucleoli are then defined as regions of high fluorescence intensities. Erode/dilate filters can decrease noise and false positives. the filter brings background noise to 0, which is achieved by assigning white pixels the value 0 (black), depending on the number of black pixels. median filter The Median filter smoothes the image and removes noise by replacing each pixel intensity with the local median intensity. this procedure reduces, but does not eliminate completely, noise in the processed image. the Dilate filter uses the same principle as the Erode filter. it assigns to black pixels the value 1 (white) depending on the number of white pixels in the neighborhood. the results are shown as overlays between the Statistical correction image and the segments. Statistical correction subtracts from each pixel in the image the average intensity value of a selected region which does not contain cells. for a HTS setting a background image is automatically subtracted from all the images analyzed. Detect dark holes filter can identify nucleoli using the DAPI or probe image. none of the operations affect the fluorescence of the probe image. nucleoli with pixel intensities lower than the nucleoplasm are identified with the probe image (Method 4) dark holes that represent nucleoli are detected with the Detect dark holes filter. the median filter will then reduce noise and improve the identification of nucleoli. cells were incubated with EU for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C, then transferred to medium without EU and stressed for 1 h at 45.5\u00b0C. after heat shock, samples were immediately fixed and processed to visualize EU incorporation. details are shown for a protocol that identifies nucleoli with the DAPI image. nucleoli are identified with the Detect dark holes filter as in Figure 3. noise is reduced with the Erode and Dilate filters."}
