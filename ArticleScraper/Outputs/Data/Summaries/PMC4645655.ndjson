{"summary": "by 26 December 2014, 938 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV had been diagnosed and had resulted in 343 casualties (2). a few cases of MERS-CoV were also detected in the united states, the united kingdom, Netherlands, Austria, France, Greece, Italy, and Germany, indicating the virus's principal potential for spread. SARS-CoV was the first betacoronavirus of zoonotic origin in 2003. a prototypic MERS vaccine should be based on MERS-S expression. both neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses are essential for prevention of SARS-CoV infection. the measles vaccine is an efficient, live attenuated, replicating virus that induces both humoral and cellular immune responses. the vaccine's manufacturing process is extremely well established (35), and millions of doses can be generated quite easily and quickly. genes expressing foreign antigens up to 6 kb can be cloned into the MV backbone (36) chikV vaccine demonstrated efficacy in phase I trials irrespective of measles virus immunity. recombinant virus reflects the MV vaccine strain Moraten (48), which has been authorized for vaccination against measles. soluble protein variant should be taken up better by B cells (49\u201351) JAWSII dendritic cells were cultured in minimal essential medium alpha (MEM-) with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides. all cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 6% CO2 for a maximum of 6 months of culture. both antigens, as well as the immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter, were inserted into p(+)BR-MVvac2-GFP(H) or p(+)MVvac2-ATU(P) (48) via AatII/MluI or SfiI/SacII, respectively, to generate p(+)PolII-MVvac2-MERS-S(H), p(+)PolII-MVvac2- cells were transfected with a standard three-plasmid lentivirus vector system. cells were transfected with 17.5 g pCSCW2-MERS-S-IRES-GFP transfer vector, 6.23 g pMD2.G, and 11.27 g pCMVR8.9 (57), as described previously. 1 105 target cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transduced with 0.1, 1 or 10 l of concentrated vector suspension. cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) cell populations revealing a 1 to 10% fraction of GFP-positive cells were used for single-cell cloning by limiting dilution. infection of vero cells at multiplicity of infeciton (MOI) of 0.03. recombinant MVs were cultured in 6-well plates and harvested as passage 0 (P0) by scraping and a freeze-thaw cycle. a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV serum (1:1,000) was used as primary antibody for MERS-CoV-S. a rabbit anti-MV-N polyclonal antibody (1:25,000; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used for MV-N detection. peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. 2 107 BHK21 cells were transduced with SFV particles (MOI, 40) for protein production, 2 107 cells were harvested after 24 h. cell pellets were lysed (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. lysates were cleared by centrifugation (30 min, 21,000 g, 4\u00b0C) mice were transduced intranasally on day 63 with 20 l of an adenovirus vector encoding human DPP4 and mCherry with a final titer of 2.5 108 PFU per inoculum. the mice were euthanized 4 days after challenge, and representative left lobe lung samples were prepared for RNA isolation. a total of 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P) or 200 TCID50 of MERS-CoV was mixed with serum dilutions and incubated for 1 h. a total of 5 105 splenocytes isolated 4 days after boost immunization were cocultured with 5 104 JAWSIIIgreen-MERS-S, DC2.4green-MERS-S, or DC3.2green-MERS-S. untransduced DC cell lines for 36 h in 200 l RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 2 nM l-Gln, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) medium alone served as the negative control. recombinant MV bulk antigens (Virion Serion) at 10 g/ml were used to analyze MV-specific immune responses in vaccinated animals. 5 103 JAWSIIgreen-MERS-S cells were added to each well. a total of 2 103 EL-4red cells were labeled with 0.5 M CFSE. EL-4 cells were labeled with the fixable viability dye eFluor 780. samples of immunized and challenged mice were homogenized in 1 ml DMEM. the homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at 2,400 rpm in a micro 200R centrifuge. the RNA amount was measured with the nanoDrop ND-100 spectrophotometer. Primers and probe were used at final concentrations of 0.4 M and 0.2 M respectively. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) program was as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min; 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 48\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. sections were cut with a leica RM2255 microtome (Leica Biosystems) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) a mouse monoclonal antibody against mCherry diluted 1:50 was used after antigen retrieval with target retrieval solution (Dako) for 23 min at 97\u00b0C. MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) was compared with the control, MVvac2-ATU(P) for analysis of challenge data, mean ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated based on log-transformed and back-transformed data. the widths of the confidence intervals caused high variability of the data. DC2.4 and DC3.2 murine dendritic cell lines (53) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 2 mM l-Gln, 1% nonessential amino acids (Biochrom), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7,4), and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol. all cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 6% CO2 for a maximum of 6 months of culture after thawing of the original stock intact antigen ORF was cloned into pCSCW2gluc-IRES-GFP (55) by using NheI/XhoI restriction sites to yield pCSCW2gluc-IRES-GFP. lentiviral vectors were produced using 293T cells and polyethylenimine (PEI; Sigma-Aldrich) transfection. 1 105 target cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transduced with 0.1, 1 or 10 l of concentrated vector suspension. cell populations revealing a 1 to 10% fraction of GFP-positive cells were used for single-cell cloning by limiting dilution. plasmids pCA-MV-N (0.4 g), pCA-MV-P (0.1 g) and pCA-MV-L (0.4 g) encoding MV proteins necessary for genome replication and expression. transfected 293T cells were overlaid 2 days after transfection onto 50% confluent Vero cells seeded in 10 cm-dishes. the RNA genomes of recombinant MV were isolated using the QIAamp RNeasy kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA genomes of recombinant MV in P3 or P10 were resuspended in 50 l RNase-free water. the resulting construct was inserted into a self-replicating RNA vector (SFV replicon) downstream of the subgenomic promoter. the integrity of purified replicon was assessed by electrophoresis. mice expressing human CD46 were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 105 TCID50 of recombinant MV or 200 l Opti-MEM on days 0 and 28. mice were euthanized 4 days after challenge, and representative left lobe lung samples were prepared for RNA isolation. a total of 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P) or 200 TCID50 of MERS-CoV was mixed with serum dilutions. a total of 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P) or 200 TCID50 of MERS-CoV was mixed with serum dilutions and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. a total of 5 105 splenocytes isolated 4 days after boost immunization were cocultured with 5 104 JAWSIIgreen-MERS-S, DC2.4green-MERS-S, or DC3.2green-MERS-S. a total of 5 105 splenocytes isolated 4 days after boost immunization were cocultured with 5 104 JAWSIIgreen-MERS-S, DC2.4green-MERS-S, splenocytes isolated 3 weeks after booster immunization were labeled with 0.5m carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. 5 105 labeled cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% mouse serum, 2 nM l-glutamine, 1 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 100 M 2-mercaptoethanol. s were cocultured with 5 104 JAWSIIgreen-MERS-S cells for 6 days in 12-well plates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 nM l-glutamine, 1 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 2-mercaptoethanol (100 M), and 100 U/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2; murine, Peprotech) titers in supernatant (in TCID50 per milliliter) were used for RNA isolation with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) the RNA amount was measured with the nanoDrop ND-100 spectrophotometer. total RNA was reverse transcribed and quantified by real-time PCR. quantification was carried out using a standard curve based on serial dilutions of appropriate cloned RNA ranging from 102 to 105 copies. inserts were examined for correct orientation and length, amplified with plasmid-specific primers, purified and transcribed into RNA by using the SP6/T7 transcription kit. a pig anti-rabbit IgG and a biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies for MERS-CoV and mCherry. the rabbit PAP method for MERS-CoV was used in combination with diaminobenzidine for staining. a nonparametric one-way analysis of variance was performed. a truncated form lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (MERS-solS) was cloned into two different ATUs. a truncated form lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (MERS-solS) was cloned into two different recombinant genomes. titers of all recombinant genomes were successfully rescued and amplified. only MVvac2-MERS-solS(P) and MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) revealed an approximately 3-fold-reduced maximum virus titer. cloning and rescue of MVs expressing MERS-CoV antigens were achieved easily and relative quickly. uninfected cells were probed using rabbit serum reactive against MERS-CoV (upper blot) or mAb reactive against MV-N (lower blot) arrows indicate specific bands. recombinant MV on vero cells infected at an MOI of 0.02 with MVvac2-MERS-S (MERS-S), MVvac2-MERS-solS (MERS-solS), or MVvac2-GFP encoding extra genes sera of mice vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) clearly encompassed IgG binding to MV bulk antigens. no antibodies were found in mice before vaccination or in control mice. mice immunized with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induced slightly higher MERS-CoV VNTs than did MVvac2 expressing the truncated form of the spike protein (167 versus 96 after the first and 874 versus 640 after the second immunization) this difference was not statistically significant. medium-inoculated mice served as mock controls. VNTs were calculated as reciprocals of the highest dilution abolishing infectivity. all mice with VNTs at the detection limit had no detectable VNT. splenocytes of vaccinated animals revealed about 2,400 IFN--secreting cells per 1 106 splenocytes after immunization with MVvac2-MERS-S or MVvac2-MERS-solS. control mice revealed background response of about 200 IFN--producing cells per 1 106 splenocytes. splenocytes were stimulated with 10 g/ml MV bulk antigens (MV-N) or left unstimulated (unst.) the reactivity of splenocytes was confirmed by ConA treatment (10 g/ml). both stimulation by ConA or MV bulk antigens resulted in lower numbers of IFN-+ cells than stimulation by DCs expressing MERS-S. splenocytes were isolated 21 days after the boost via a flow cytometric assay. JAWSII cells expressing MERS-S were used for restimulation of MERS-S-specific T cells. the splenocytes were labeled with CFSE and then cocultured with JAWSII-MERS-S cells. splenocytes were cocultured with untransduced JAWSII (B) or with antigen-presenting JAWSII-MERS-S (C) or for 6 days. Activated CTLs were then cocultured with EL-4-MERS-S target cells (antigen) and EL-4red control cells (NC) at the indicated effector:target ratio for 4 h. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; *, P 0.0001. a killing assay was performed to directly analyze antigen-specific cytotoxicity. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; ***, P 0.0001. mice vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) showed VNTs directed against MERS-CoV, with titers up to 1,280 for MERS-S and up to 960 for MERS-solS. mice were either vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or control MV [MVvac2-ATU(P)] or left untreated. mice vaccinated with control MVvac2-ATU(P) showed slightly lower copy numbers of viral RNA (5,923 3,045 MERS-CoV genome copies/ng RNA) titers of infectious virus were determined in the lung tissue. in mock-treated control mice, titers of 5,000 TCID50/ml were determined. mrs-CoV infection of transduced mice was not always successful. mrs-CoV infection was indicated by a completely negative PCR result for viral genomes in about 40% of all animals. lungs were examined with H&E staining to visualize inflammation. all mice that were positive in the qRT-PCR for the mCherry gene expressed mCherry in epithelia of the lungs, demonstrating successful transduction. paraffin-fixed tissue was stained with H&E (first column; scale bar, 200 m), with Ab against MERS-CoV-S antigen (middle column; scale bar, 100 m), and as a control of AdV transduction against mCherry (middle column; scale bar, 50 m). a truncated form lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (MERS-solS), was cloned into two cloning and rescue of MVs expressing MERS-CoV antigens were achieved easily and relative quickly. soluble variant lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmatic region (MERS-solS) and recombinant MVvac2 genomes were analyzed to check if the insertion or expression of the S antigen variants impaired the vaccines' replication. antigen or antigen-encoding genes are depicted in dark gray. MV viral gene cassettes (light gray) are annotated. immunoblot analysis of vero cells infected at an MOI of 0.03. 6 mice per group were inoculated with 1 105 TCID50 of MVvac2-MERS-S(H), MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) or MVvac2-ATU(P), the latter a recombinant control virus without an insertion of a foreign antigen-encoding gene cassette into an otherwise-empty additional transcription unit. sera of immunized mice were compared to prebleed sera by ELISA on antigen-coated plates evidence for induction of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV was only found in mice vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS-solS(H), as expected. the VNT against MERS-CoV reached a titer of 96 to 167 after the first immunization. splenocytes of animals vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S or MVvac2-MERS-solS secrete IFN- upon MERS-S-specific stimulation. splenocytes of animals vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S or MVvac2-MERS-solS were isolated 4 days after the second immunization. specific T cells in vitro, syngeneic murine DC cell lines (JAWSII, DC2.4, and DC3.2) were genetically modified by lentiviral vector transduction to stably express MERS-S protein. antigen expression by transduced DCs was verified by Western blot analysis. control mice revealed a background response of about 200 IFN--producing cells per 1 106 splenocytes. splenocytes of all mice revealed a similar basic reactivity to unspecific T cell stimulation. both stimulation by ConA or MV bulk antigens resulted in lower numbers of IFN-+ cells than stimulation by DCs expressing MERS-S. the generated MV-based vaccine platform expressing MERS-S or MERS-solS induces humoral but also strong cellular immune responses. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01. MVvac2-MERS-S or MVvac2-MERS-solS induce antigen-specific CD8+ CTLs. for that purpose, proliferation of CD8+ T cells upon stimulation with MERS-S was analyzed 3 weeks after the boost via a flow cytometric assay. low cells indicated that CD3+ CD8+ CTLs specific for MERS-S proliferated upon respective stimulation. so, MERS-specific cytotoxic memory T cells are induced in mice after vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) a killing assay was performed to directly analyze antigen-specific cytotoxicity. induced T cells revealed antigen-specific cytotoxicity. a killing assay was performed to directly analyze antigen-specific cytotoxicity. splenocytes of control mice restimulated with JAWSII-MERS-S showed such an antigen-specific killing activity. these results demonstrated that the MV-based vaccine platform induces fully functional antigen-specific CD8+ CTLs in vaccinated mice. the induction of strong humoral and cellular immune responses directed against MERS-CoV in mice vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS- mice were transduced with a recombinant adenoviral vector to express human DPP4 (AdV-hDPP4) at 5 days after airway transduction, mice were infected i.n. with 7 104 TCID50 MERS-CoV. four days later, animals were euthanized, lungs were isolated, and homogenates were used for purification of total RNA and virus titration. ers were found in mice vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) compared to mock control mice. these results revealed that vaccination with the recombinant measles viruses was able to protect mice against a challenge with MERS-CoV in vivo. histological analyses were performed to analyze if reduced viral load in mice vaccinated with MVvac2-MERS-solS(H) or MVvac2-MERS-S(H) was matched by decreased pathological changes in mouse lungs. all mice that were positive in the qRT-PCR for the mCherry gene expressed mCherry in epithelia of the lungs. vaccination with recombinant MV expressing MERS-S reduced pathological changes in the lungs of prevaccinated mice after transduction with hDPP4-encoding AdV and challenge with MERS-CoV. recombinant MV encoding different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses. mice were immunized with 103-fold fewer virus particles than with MVA and 106-fold lower particles than with replication-deficient AdV. transgenic IFNAR/-CD46Ge mice have been used in our study with defects in type I IFN receptor signaling. the soluble version of S by MV did not enhance VNTs. this is consistent with humoral immunity induced by DNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV. soluble S1 domain of MERS-S actually induced slightly higher VNTs than full-length S. vaccines encoding either the soluble or the full-length variant of MERS-S did induce strong VNTs and cellular immune responses. the protective capacity of humoral immune responses against coV infection is controversial. vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S or MVvac2-MERS-solS significantly reduced viral loads in the lungs of vaccinated mice after challenge with MERS-CoV. at least 4 mice out of each group did not reveal any MERS-CoV infection nor any pathological lung alterations. vaccination with recombinant MVs encoding antigens of HIV-1 (41) or Chikungunya virus (45) still induced surprisingly robust antigen-specific immune responses. recombinant MV vaccine was recently shown to be effective in inducing anti-CHIKV immune responses irrespective of preexisting antimeasles immunity. inant VSV-G (VSV-ZEBOV) was shown to be effective in animal models. it is now being tested in phase I trials for safety in human patients. thereby, potential interest in such vaccines to combat emerging or reemerging infections is impressively highlighted."}
