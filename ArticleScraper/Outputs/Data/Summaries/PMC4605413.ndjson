{"summary": "there is limited information about the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in hospitalised adults and children in south-east Asia. such data are important for future management of respiratory infections. the low number of detected influenza viruses demonstrates a low benefit for empirical oseltamivir therapy, unless during an influenza outbreak. non-influenza viruses are the most common causes of illness that clinically resemble influenza, particularly in children. human metapneumovirus, new human coronaviruses (NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), rhinovirus C and emerging novel lineages and subtypes of influenza virus A capable of infecting humans have also been identified. the most comprehensive data on the causes of ILI originate from developed countries, with some data available from SEA. Archived respiratory specimens were obtained from 12 sites in three countries across SEA (three sites in Indonesia, four sites in Thailand, five sites in Vietnam) the specimens used for this study were stored at 80\u00b0C until further testing. PCRs were used to detect the following viruses: rhinoviruses A, B and C, enteroviruses, parainfluenza virus 4, bocavirus, parechoviruses and Chlamydophila psittaci. basic demographic data (country, sex, age) were collected as well as date of disease onset, date of admission, type of specimen and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. baseline demographic characteristics (age category, sex, country of admission and proportion of ICU admissions) were summarised as frequency and proportion. the frequencies of different pathogens were summarised as frequency and proportion. disease outcomes including severity (severe defined as ICU admission), death, duration of hospitalisation and duration of illness were examined by regression analysis. most patients were enrolled in Vietnam (n = 826, 676%) the median age was higher in Indonesian patients as compared to those from Vietnam and Thailand (16 year, versus 4 year and 2 year respectively) one hundred and 67 patients (137%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); ICU admission data from 232 patients were unknown. virus detected were rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (187%), bocaviruses in 200 (164%), RSV in 144 (118%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (115%), adenovirus in 102 (84%), influenza viruses in 93 (76%; influenza A: 77; influenza B: 16), human metapneumoviruses in 22 (18%), coronaviruses in 23 (18%; OC43: 9; E229 there were 234 of 1222 patients (192%) who had at least two pathogens detected (bacterial and/or viral) of these, 170 patients were found to have two pathogens, 54 had three pathogens, nine had four pathogens, and one patient had five pathogens. most viral pathogens were more common in children, with parechovirus and parainfluenza virus 4 only found in children. 05\u201314 17 (135) 3 (24) 3 (24) 0 (0) 2 (16) 11 (87) 0 1 (08) 1 (08) 1 (08) 5 (4) 0 21 (167) 1 (08) 74/126 15\u201344 24 (122) 4 (2) 3 (15) 1 (05) 4 (2) 3 (15) 6 (31) 6 (31) 10 (51) 0 1 (05) 2 (1) 0 13 (66) 0 77/196 45\u201364 7 (91) 1 (13) ventilation was 42 of 826 (51%) in Vietnam and 21 of 171 (123%) in Thailand (data not available for Indonesia). 15 of 616 children (24%) aged under 5 years, three of 36 (83%) aged 5\u201314 years, 69 of 106 (651%) aged 15\u201344 years, 33 of 45 (733%) aged 45\u201364 years and 20 of 23 (87%) aged over 65 years were admitted to ICU (2 for trend P 00005). patients in the >65-year group were hospitalised longer, but did not differ by sex. median duration of hospitalisation was 5 days (IQR: 3\u20137 days), sex and age was performed. the median number of days from illness onset to specimen collection was 4 (IQR: 3\u20136 days) for 155 patients, no exact admission date was known. most patients were enrolled in Vietnam (n = 826, 676%) virus detected were rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (187%), bocaviruses in 200 (164%), RSV in 144 (118%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (115%;
