{"summary": "etiologic agents of CAP include bacteria and virus [6\u201312]. bacterial infection appears to occur mostly in older children. viral infection is more prevalent in patients under the age of 5 years. nasopharyngeal swab samples from 1699 patients with CAP were tested using the GeXP assay. amplification is overtaken by the universal primers, eventually generating amplicons containing target sequence and fluorescence-labeled tag. the application of the GeXP assay to test larger clinical samples has rarely been reported. control panel consisted of cytomegalovirus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Epstein-Barr virus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiellar pneumonia, Escherichia coli, measles virus, mumps virus, rub information of all primers was listed in Table 1. All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). Table 1. Information of all primers.

N1 and N2, among which RSV was the most detected followed by PIV3, HRV, ADV, and HBoV (Table 3). nasopharyngeal samples were isolated from patients with CAP. positive rates were 66.10% and 62.8%, respectively.

RT-PCR and RT-PCR have increasingly been explored for identification of pathogens including virus detection in infectious respiratory diseases. cantais tested 9 types of viruses, i.e., RSV, ADV, HMPV, HBoV, coronavirus, FluA, FluB, HRV and PIVs using the biplex commercially-available RT-PCR Kit in 85 children with CAP. this study is the first to use the GeXP-based assay for virus detection in pediatric CAP patients. RNA viruses in the target panel were amplified by the GeXP-based assay (Fig 1A), indicating that reverse transcription is not a problem. however, we felt an RNA template should be used as the internal control in future work."}
