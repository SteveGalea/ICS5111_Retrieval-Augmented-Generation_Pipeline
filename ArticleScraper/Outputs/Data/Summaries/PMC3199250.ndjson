{"summary": "influenza viruses (IAV) are important pathogens that infect avian and mammal species around the world. in birds, IAV produce a variety of disease symptoms and are classified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) or highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) according to the severity, they are classified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV). the aim of this study was to elucidate the entry point of a H7N1 HPAIV into the CNS of chickens. a double immunostaining was employed to determine the role of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) in the neuropathogenesis as an initial target of IAV entry into the CNS. the presence of haematogenous dissemination was determined by means of viral RNA detection in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (RT-qPCR) chickens were randomly divided into two groups at 15 days of age. the first group consisted of 17 chickens that were inoculated intranasally with 50 L diluted infectious allantoic fluid containing 106 ELD50 H7N1 HPAIV. the second group consisted of 12 chickens that were used as negative controls. formalin-fixed nasal cavity samples were sectioned at the level of the olfactory epithelium and brain samples were cut at six different coronal levels. sequential 3 m microtome sections corresponding to the following interaurals were made from each paraffin block and used to perform all the immunohistochemical (IHC) studies. paraffin-embedded samples were sectioned at 3 m thick, dewaxed and treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol to eliminate the endogenous peroxidase. sections were incubated with the primary monoclonal antibody (ATCC, HB-65, H16L-10-4R5) diluted 1:250, at 4\u00b0C overnight. in the six coronal sections, the intensity and extent of viral antigen staining were visually determined using a scoring system. in each animal, the intensity and extent of viral antigen staining were visually determined using a scoring system. in each animal, the intensity and extent of staining was represented using a heap of arithmetic mean. the topographical distribution of the viral antigen staining was graphically represented in the six coronal sections, using the Adobe Photoshop CS2 program. the staining of ependymal cells was considered as a separate entity, and represented with different colours according to the intensity of viral antigen staining. inylated lectins Sambucus nigrans (SNA) (10 g/mL) or Maackia amurensis leukoagglutinin (MAAII) (15 g/mL) were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 1:100 for 30 min. negative controls consisted of sections of tissues where distribution of AIV receptors has already been determined (human lungs, pig trachea, duck antigen retrieval was carried out for 30 min with proteinase K diluted 1:50 in Tris-HCl 0.05 M, pH 7.6 (S3004, Dako) at RT. slides were blocked with triton 0.5% in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) negative controls consisted of incubation of sequential sample with PBS instead of primary antibodies. unspecific binding of both secondary antibodies was discarded, incubating them with the contrary primary antibody. samples were rinsed three times with tris-buffer saline solution (TBS) RT-qPCR for the detection of viral RNA in CSF and blood. RNA was eluted in 40 L and amplified by one-step RT-qPCR. procedure uses internal positive control (IPC) to avoid false negative results. chickens were monitored daily by visual observation for clinical signs. at 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi, 3 chickens from each group were randomly selected for necropsy and sampled. chickens found dead on these same days were necropsied and included in the study. diagram shows the topographical distribution of IAV antigen in chickens infected with H7N1 HPAIV at 2, 3 and 4 dpi. the severity of viral antigen immunostaining in cells of the central nervous system is represented using different density of dots. dded samples were sectioned at 3 m thick, dewaxed and treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol to eliminate the endogenous peroxidase. sections were treated with protease at 37\u00b0C for 10 min and incubated with the primary monoclonal antibody (ATCC, HB-65, H16L-10-4R5) at 4\u00b0C overnight. in the six coronal sections, the intensity and extent of viral antigen staining were visually determined using a scoring system. to graphically represent the pattern of staining, we proceeded to quantify in each animal the number of positive cells in a variable number of 10 fields. the scale was used to rank the intensity of staining in each region: nil (0: no labelling detected); scarce (1: less than 20 nuclei of cells positive for viral antigen on average); moderate (3: focal area symmetrical and bilateral distribution of H7N1 HPAIV antigen in the brain of an infected chicken at 2 dpi. staining of ependymal cells was considered as a separate entity. yellow was used to indicate a scarce number of positive cells. gglutinin (MAAII) (15 g/mL) in TNB at 4\u00b0C, overnight. the lectin that preferentially binds to the Sia2-3 Gal linkage was used to detect the avian type receptor. the SNA lectin that shows preference towards the Sia2-6 Gal linkage was used to identify the human type receptor [19] antigen retrieval was carried out for 30 min with proteinase K diluted 1:50 in Tris-HCl 0.05 M, pH 7.6 (S3004, Dako) at RT, and later permeabilized using triton 0.5% in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. slides were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 0.5% triton in PBS for 1 h at negative controls consisted of incubation of a sequential sample with PBS instead of primary antibodies. unspecific binding of both secondary antibodies was discarded, incubating them with the contrary primary antibody. RNA was eluted in 40 L and amplified by one-step RT-qPCR. results Clinical signs, mortality and gross lesions were observed at one dpi. eight out of 14 infected chickens showed depression, prostration, ruffled feathers and respiratory distress. no clinical signs, mortality or gross lesions in control non-infected chickens. perivascular oedema, endothelial cell hypertrophy, focal and focus of malacia associated to moderate gliosis were observed. symmetrical and bilateral viral antigen distribution was observed in the Mesencephalon, hypothalamus, diencephalon, and r1-6. the staining was restricted to particular neural nuclei of epithelial choroid plexus cells. cytoplasmatic staining was also observed in the most rostral sections of the brain. most rostral periventricular regions and ependymal cells showed scarce to minor staining (labelled in yellow) at 2 and 3 dpi, whereas, at 4 dpi, moderate staining was observed in these most rostral periventricular regions and on ependymal cells (labelled in blue) similar intensity of staining was observed on ependymal cells, being slight at 2 dpi (labelled in green) and moderate at 3 dpi (labelled in blue) at 4 dpi, bilateral and symmetrical viral antigen staining was also detected in the following neural nuclei. the viral antigen staining in the cerebellum was scored as intense at 2, 3 and 4 dpi. but their distribution varied, being found as single individual foci at 2 dpi. moderate to intense bilateral staining was observed in the rhombencephalon. slight viral antigen staining was observed in the striopallidal organ (SPO) (4 out of 4 chickens), area postrema (AP) (in one chicken), vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (VOLT) (in one chicken) the subcommisural organ (SCO) was found negative in one chicken. infected chickens, foci of granular SNA positive staining in the neuropil were observed adjacent to SNA-positive endothelial cells. these foci were found randomly distributed in all regions of the brain of infected chickens at 3 and 4 dpi. the foci of granular SNA lectin deposition were frequently observed associated with the presence of viral antigen staining and malacia at 3 and 4 dpi. however, granular SNA lectin deposition was not found in all viral antigen positive areas. eight out of 14 infected chickens showed depression, prostration, ruffled feathers and respiratory distress at 2 dpi. pulmonary congestion was observed in 2 out of 3 chickens at 2 dpi. severe depression, inactivity and neurological signs were also observed in 3 out of 11 chickens. perivascular oedema, endothelial cell hypertrophy, focal and focus of malacia associated to moderate gliosis were mainly seen in the gray matter of the brain at 2 dpi. at 3 and 4 dpi, focal haemorrhages and coalescent foci of malacia were observed. sporadic positive foci were found in isolated or multiple foci. viral antigen staining was scarce and mainly observed in the nuclei of epithelial choroid plexus cells. cytoplasmatic staining was also observed in the nuclei of epithelial choroid plexus cells. the topographical distribution and intensity of viral antigen staining, thoroughly examined, quantified and represented in Figure 1 shows how the virus spreads into the CNS of chickens. the VPall showed little increase in viral antigen staining at 2 dpi. the most caudal section of the telencephalic pallium showed high viral antigen staining. at 4 dpi, the amount of viral antigen staining on the intermediate and caudal sections was intense. dorsomedial anterior nucleus of the thalamus (DMA), subthalamic nucleus (STh) in the mammilary region, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and r3 lateral vestibular nucleus, ventral part (r3LVeV) viral antigen positive staining was scored as moderate for the periventricular regions and ependymal cells at 4 dpi. r2 superior vestibular nucleus (r2SuVe), the oral part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp50) in the rhombencephalon, the viral antigen staining on ependymal cells was weak at 2 dpi and increased on severity at 3 and 4 dpi. epithelial cells of the choroid plexus in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles showed less intensity of viral anti i, the SPO (4 out of 5 chickens), SCO (3 out of 3 chickens), area postrema (one chicken), median eminence (ME) (2 chickens) and the LSO (one chicken) showed moderate staining. no differences in pattern and intensity of staining with the MAAII lectin. slight staining for Sia2-3 Gal receptors was found on endothelial cells (A) and ependymal cells. apical membrane of choroid plexus cells showed abundant presence of Sia2-3 Gal receptors (C) intense staining for Sia2-6 Gal receptors was observed on endothelial cells in the brain and choroid plexus cells. viral antigen staining was sporadically observed in the nuclei of cells of the olfactory epithelium of chickens infected with H7N1 HPAIV from 2 to 4 dpi. it did not colocalize with the PGP9.5 antigen in any chicken. several neurotropic viruses have been proven to use the olfactory pathway to enter into the CNS. however, in the present study, OSN were negative for viral antigen during the first four days of evaluation. the relevance of the olfactory pathway for virus invasion could be considered negligible or absent. early endothelial infection and viraemia are key events during HPAIV infection in birds [5,36] viraemia determines the spread of this H7N1 HPAIV to different organs and final entrance to the CNS. viraemia determines the spread of this virus to different organs. viral antigen was abundant in ependymal cells, which could be a consequence of further replication of H7N1 HPAIV. this could disrupt the BBB and infect the brain parenchyma. however, the detection of viral RNA in CSF indicates that disruption of the blood-CSF barrier occurs subsequently to the establishment of viraemia. bilateral and symmetrical areas of positive viral detection were observed in the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, especially in the Rot (p2), PG (p3), ToS (mesencephalon), and APT nuclei (p1). Detection of bilateral and symmetrical lesions in the brain has also been described in humans suffering from influenza-associated encephalopathies (IAE) increased sia2-6 and sia2-3 glycotopes have been detected in respiratory cells of ferrets infected with H1N1 influenza virus [55]. increased expression of mRNA of 2-6 and 2-3 sialyltransferases has been observed in rat liver after inflammation [57], and human tracheal cells and bronchial mucosa stimulated with tumour necrosis factor- (TNF) [58]. dorsomedial anterior nucleus of the thalamus; (DPall) dorsal pallium; (DPall) dorsomedial anterior nucleus of the thalamus; (DPall) dorsomedial anterior nucleus of the thalamus; (DPall) dorsomedial anterior nucleus of the thalamus; (DPall) dorsal pallium; (DPall) dorsomedial anterior nucleus of the thala NB and RR carried out the avian influenza virus quantitation by RT-qPCR.
