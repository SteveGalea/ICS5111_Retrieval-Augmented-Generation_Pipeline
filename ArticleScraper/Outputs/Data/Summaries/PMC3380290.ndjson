{"summary": "a rodent model of respiratory viral infection identifies the underlying mechanisms whereby virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells direct neutrophil functions. this knowledge contributes to the understanding of viral pathogenesis in the lung. AT2 cells were isolated from 6- to 10-week-old Simonsen Albino rats. granulocytes were resuspended in endotoxin-free HBSS/1% BSA. erythrocytes were lysed before granulocyte separation using Ficoll. all preparations consisted of approximately 95% PMNs. cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. activity of caspases 2, 3, 8, or 9 was quantified using luminescent substrate assays. Luminescence was measured using a FLUOstar Optima. immunofluorescent detection of viral nucleocapsid antigen (16) was harvested 24 hours after viral inoculation for chemotaxis and apoptosis assays. erythrocytes were removed by dextran sedimentation, and granulocytes were separated by centrifugation over Histopaque 1083. erythrocytes were lysed before granulocyte separation using Ficoll. PMN apoptosis was induced by cycloheximide (Cx) (100 ng/ml), hrTNF- (0.1 mg/ml) or exposure to 15,000 J UV irradiation for 15 minutes in a StrataLinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry an in vitro chemotaxis assay was used to test whether rat bone marrow-derived PMNs actively migrate toward supernatant medium harvested from AT1-like cells 24 hours after infection by RCoV. chemotaxis of PMNs toward the bacterial tripeptide FMLP was considered to represent 100% chemotaxis. chemotaxis of rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) toward medium from rat coronavirus-infected AT1-like cells was quantified by fluorescence intensity in a micro-chemotaxis plate. fluorescence intensity data were normalized to FMLP. 265610 significantly reduced chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. inhibition of CXCR2 signaling significantly decreased PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. chemotaxis of 3 104 PMNs was quantified by fluorescence intensity. neutralization of the four CXC chemokines did not block PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. anti-CXCL1 and anti-CXCL3 together inhibited PMN chemotaxis by approximately 40%. the specificity of each neutralizing antibody was tested against recombinant CXC chemokines. all of the CXC chemokines tested were induced by RCoV in AT1-like cells by 24 hours. the concentration of CXCL5 was similar to CXCL1 at 24 hours but did not increase comparably over time. CXCL2 was secreted at relatively low concentrations at all time points. multiple antibodies were evaluated in combination. concentrations of CXC chemokines in RCoV-AT1 compared with mock-AT1 at 24, 48, and 72 hours after inoculation were quantified by ELISA. ant CXC chemokines were combined at concentrations equivalent to those in RCoV-AT1 and analyzed in a PMN chemotaxis assay. chemotaxis toward the mixture of recombinant CXC chemokines was approximately 20% lower than toward RCoV-AT1 (Figure 3D), which contains comparable concentrations of CXC chemokines. in RPMI-AT1 PMNs incubated in RCoV-AT1 resulted in a significant inhibition of apoptosis compared with RPMI alone. there was no significant difference in annexin V binding to PMNs incubated in mock-AT1 or RPMI-AT1 at the 24- and 48-hour time points. effector caspase 3 is activated during spontaneous apoptosis of human PMNs. inhibition of caspase 3 reduces PMN apoptosis (24, 25) caspase 3/7 was activated in PMNs incubated in RPMI. caspase 8 is activated by death receptor adapter proteins, or caspase 9. caspase 2 activity in PMNs increased significantly during 4 hours of culture in vitro. however, caspase 2 activation was not affected by incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1. RCoV-AT1-mediated inhibition of PMN apoptosis is not required. RCoV-AT1 was UV irradiated before incubation with PMNs. however, irradiation of RCoV-AT1 did not affect its ability to inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs. soluble factor(s) secreted by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells inhibits PMN apoptosis. rat CXCL1, inhibit PMN apoptosis (19, 23, 29, 30) chemokines are ligands for CXCR2 (18) therefore, we inhibited CXCR2 signaling with SB265610 to analyze whether CXCR2 signaling was required for RCoV-AT1\u2013mediated suppression of PMN apoptosis. annexin V binding and caspase 3 activity did not alter spontaneous apoptosis. PMNs were UV irradiated and then incubated for 6 hours with RCoV-AT1 or RPMI. TNF-, Cx, and UV irradiation all induced PMN apoptosis. incubation in RCoV-AT1 dramatically decreased TNF-induced PMN apoptosis. AT1-Like Cells Viral antigen is predominantly found in AT1 cells in the alveoli of RCoV-infected rats. PMNs are present at high levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid early during infection (15) an in vitro chemotaxis assay was used to test whether rat bone marrow-derived PMNs actively migrate toward supernatant medium harvested from AT1-like cells 24 hours after infection by RCoV. UV irradiation of RCoV-AT1 did not reduce PMN chemotaxis. chemotaxis of rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes toward medium from RCoV-infected AT1-like cells was quantified by fluorescence intensity. rat PMNs were incubated with an antagonist of CXCR2, SB265610, before exposure to RCoV-AT1 in the chemotaxis assay (19). PMNs treated with SB265610 had significantly reduced chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. neutralizing antibodies to any one of the CXC chemokines did not block PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. neutralization of the four CXC chemokines did not completely block PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. all of the CXC chemokines tested were induced by RCoV in AT1-like cells by 24 hours. the concentration of CXCL5 was similar to CXCL1 at 24 hours but did not increase comparably over time. antibodies to neutralize chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1 were evaluated. mouse IgG (mIgG) was used as an isotype control for CXCL2, -3, and -5. goat IgG (gIgG) was used as an isotype control for CXCL1. PMN chemotaxis toward recombinant CXC chemokines was 20% lower than toward RCoV-AT1. recombinant CXC chemokines were combined at concentrations equivalent to those in RCoV-AT1. recombinant CXC chemokines were combined at concentrations equivalent to those in RCoV-AT1. PMNs isolated from rat blood were incubated in RCoV-AT1 or mock-AT1 medium. the proportion of PMNs that bound annexin V increased during incubation. this rate of apoptosis is similar to the spontaneous apoptosis of human PMNs incubated in vitro reported by others. effector caspase 3 is activated during spontaneous apoptosis of human PMNs. inhibition of caspase 3 reduces PMN apoptosis (24, 25) caspase 3/7 activated in PMNs incubated in RPMI. caspase 2 activates apoptotic signaling upstream of the mitochondrium. caspase 2 activity during spontaneous apoptosis of PMN increased significantly during 4 hours of culture in vitro. however, caspase 2 activation was not affected by incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1. RCoV-AT1 was UV irradiated before incubation with PMNs. irradiation of RCoV-AT1 did not affect its ability to inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of PMNs. soluble factor(s) secreted by RCoV-infected AT1-like cells inhibits PMN apoptosis. signaling through CXCR2 Is Required for RCoV-AT1\u2013Mediated Inhibition of PMN Apoptosis CXC chemokines are ligands for CXCR2 (18) therefore, we inhibited CXCR2 signaling with SB265610 to analyze whether CXCR2 signaling was required for RCoV-AT1\u2013mediated suppression of PMN apoptosis. PMNs were incubated in RCoV-AT1 or RPMI in the presence of TNF- or Cx. PMNs were UV irradiated and then incubated for 6 hours with RCoV-AT1 or RPMI. RCoV-AT1 had no significant effect on UV- or Cx-induced apoptosis. incubation in RCoV-AT1 dramatically decreased TNF-induced PMN apopto the alveolar epithelium is an important target for viruses that infect the lung (1\u20134). communication between virus-infected epithelial cells and PMNs initiates and regulates the subsequent response in the lung. RCoV is a respiratory pathogen of rats that predominantly infects AT1 cells in the alveoli. neutralizing antibodies to individual CXC chemokines had no effect on PMN chemotaxis toward RCoV-AT1. neutralizing antibodies to individual CXC chemokines effectively blocked PMN chemotaxis toward their respective CXC chemokines. fixed monomers and dimers have decreased, CXCR1-dependent chemotaxis in comparison to wild-type CXCL8 (21). monomeric and dimeric forms of CXCL8 have biological activity in vivo. neutralizing antibodies completely inhibited PMN chemotaxis toward the four recombinant CXC chemokines. apoptotic PMNs are phagocytosed by macrophages, preventing release of cytotoxic components. phagocytosis of apoptotic PMNs has immunosuppressive effects on macrophages. incubation of PMNs in RCoV-AT1 significantly inhibited their spontaneous apoptosis, including inhibition of initiator caspases 8 and 9. PMNs in RCoV-AT1 with a CXCR2 inhibitor reversed apoptosis inhibition. this suggests that CXC chemokines that are induced by RCoV infection of AT1 cells are responsible for inhibiting PMN apoptosis. when apoptosis was evaluated at time points before 8 hours, TNF- promoted PMN apoptosis. in contrast, when incubated over 18 hours, TNF- decreased PMN apoptosis. we confirmed by staining of activation markers that the PMNs were not activated by our isolation procedure. cytokines in RCoV-AT1 are sufficient to inhibit caspase 3 activity in PMNs. caspases 8 and 9 can activate effector caspase 3, which is critical for spontaneous and TNF-induced apoptosis pathways in PMNs (24, 25, 50, 51). caspase 9 can also activate caspase 8, thereby intertwining these pathways. caspase 9 activation leads to caspase 8 activation, or both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are involved. this suggests that caspase 2 activity is not sufficient to induce PMN apoptosis. this is in agreement with other studies that demonstrate that activation of caspase 2 in the absence of caspase 8 is not sufficient to mediate Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells (27)."}
