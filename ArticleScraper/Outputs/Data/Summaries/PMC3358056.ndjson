{"summary": "swabs were collected from 6,942 adult patients (>15 years of age) at the time of admission to the Fever Clinic Department at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for ARTI. to detect HEV, we amplified 350\u2013400 bp of the viral protein 1 (VP1) gene by reverse transcription PCR (7). serotypes detected among adult patients by using sequence analysis of a partial viral protein 1 gene, in Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China, August 2006\u2013April 2010. we detected 21 cases of CVA21 during August\u2013December 2006 and 8 cases during September\u2013December 2008. EV68 was detected in only 11 samples collected during August\u2013October 2006 and in 2 samples in August 2008. Coxsackievirus A21, n = 34 Enterovirus 68, n = 13 Any human enterovirus, n = 130 Sex M 18 (52.9) 7 (53.8) 69 (53.1) F 16 (47.1) 6 (46.2) 61 (46.9) Signs and symptoms Pharyngeal congestion 34 (100) 13 (100.0) 128 (98.5) Headache 27 (79.4) 10 (76.9) 104 (80.0) Myalgia 25 (73.5) influenza virus A (n = 2), parainfluenza virus 3 (n = 2), rhinovirus (n = 2), metapneumovirus (n = 1), coronavirus OC43 (n = 1). major symptoms associated with HEV infection included pharyngeal congestion, headache, myalgia, chills, and sore throat. phylogenetic analysis of human enteroviruses according to partial viral protein 1 (VP1) nucleotide sequences. the tree was generated with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. s with their respective prototype strains revealed a limited divergence. in china, only 42 detections of CVA21 and 26 detections of EV68 have been reported during 36 years of HEV surveillance. EV68 was recently associated with ARTIs in france, the Netherlands, the United States, the Philippines, and the u.s. in several-year cycles (11) we noted that CVA21 infections were concentrated in 2006 and 2008. however, because patients were not enrolled in our study after April 2010, our data on HEV circulation might be incomplete."}
