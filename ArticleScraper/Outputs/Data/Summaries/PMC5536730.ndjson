{"summary": "the telerehabilitation platform1 is being actively used by the Nicosia General Hospital. it provides remote services for home care and rehabilitation for patients in the community. the professional staff is responsible for managing, monitoring, and evaluating the rehabilitation groups. physiotherapist - Coordinate the exercise program - Maintain clinical record bookkeeping - Include patients in each session - Analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) - Evaluate the patient\u2019s level of dyspnea and vital signs during exercise. Provide psychological evaluation - Provide psychological support Table 2. an exercise rehabilitation session takes place in real-time in a virtual-Room between a group of no more than eight patients under the coordination of a health professional. the platform supports real-time bidirectional transfer of high definition video (image and sound) between the coordinator (central station) and the participating patients (home stations) wearable wireless (802.11b) devices with biosignal sensors are involved. the devices monitor and transmit via direct connection to a central unit the patient\u2019s biosignals. a belt, attached to the patient\u2019s waist and shoulder, guarantees security and stability of the devices. the video conference system leverages a MCU (Multiparty Control Unit) that enables the creation of virtual rooms, automatically establishes calls with all participants, configures the clinician\u2019s view in tile window layout and starts session recording based on pre-scheduled scenarios. home stations come with specialized video-conferencing software and are equipped with USB high definition (HD) cameras and microphones. private and non-private data are stored and processed in separate servers. private data are encrypted, using AES symmetric-key algorithm. access to private-data server is restricted to health professionals only. the telerehabilitation platform is being used by the Nicosia general hospital. it supports real-time/online and offline interactions between health professionals and patients. the platform supports real-time bidirectional transfer of high definition video. central stations are equipped with broadband internet access, videoconferencing system, monitoring system of the patients\u2019 biosignals, sound system (microphones, loudspeakers and amplifier) a central station can control simultaneously up to eight home stations. a home station is provided to each patient and supports teleconference in virtual rooms. resistance level is determined after assessment at the beginning and at the middle of the tele-supervised exercise program. soft weights of 0.5kg to 3kg (6 weight levels) are also individually assigned to patients according to the initial and mid assessment of the resistance exercises. a patient\u2019s station is programmed with a predefined time interval for its training material or consultation. the clinician in charge is able to assign the appropriate training material to a group of patients and/or to each patient individually during a session or offline. CRF stores more than 100 individual fields and eight health surveys and medical examinations. all participating patients are being concurrently monitored and their vital signs are transferred through a central unit to the conference system. all data are transferred over virtual private network (VPN - IPSec no-compression) tunnels utilizing less than 100Kbps. a patient\u2019s station is programmed with a predefined time interval for its training material or consultation. private data are encrypted using AES symmetric-key algorithm. prior storage and access is allowed only from the server itself. health professionals have access to specific data views for specific patients based on their role (i.e., psychologists cannot view demographic data and ICU scores) ELIGIBILITY STUDY VERIFICATION This pilot verification study was undertaken in order to assess eligibility for inclusion of former ICU patients in a tele-supervised exercise training program. a prospective study of consecutive admissions to the general ICU of Nicosia general Hospital for the eligibility to participate in a home-based telerehabilitation program was conducted. non-eligible MV48 240 53.4 75.3 75.3 MMSE23 39 8.6 12.2 87.5 RMI8/15 7 1.6 2.2 89.7 End stage chronic illness 12 2.7 3.8 93.4 Transfer to other facility 21 4.7 6.6 100.0 Total 319 71.0 100.0 Missing System 132 29.0 Total patients 451 100.0 MV: Mechanical ventilation, MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination, RMI: Rivermead Mobility Index FINANCIAL APP the sum of cash flows of every year in a five-year period was calculated with an annual discount rate of 10%, resulting in 30,000 Euros NPV for Tele-Rehabilitation. the IRR was calculated to be 11.8% which is higher and thus, better compared to a standard discount rate of assumed 10%. the data were collected from February 2013 until October 2013. the analysis was conducted on 451 patients; 77 (17%) died (hospital mortality), 55 (12%) were considered eligible and 319 (70%) were non-eligible. financial projections assumed an increasing number of Telerehabilitation users over a 5-year period. in the fifth year, 122 full users and 200 follow-up patients would use the service. the initial investment for the entire technical equipment (including devices, systems, software etc.) is estimated to be 382,000 euros. 12% of all admissions to the general ICU of Nicosia general hospital during an 8-month period were eligible to participate. a telerehabilitation program for former ICU patients could be addressed with some changes from the above described. a telerehabilitation program for former ICU patients could be addressed with some changes from the above described. former ICU patients renders such a project necessary in our society."}
