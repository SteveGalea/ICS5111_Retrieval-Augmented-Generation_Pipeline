{"summary": "the nose, combined with paranasal sinuses, has a surface area of about 80\u2013100 m2 in adults. every minute, about 6\u201312 liters of air is inhaled. this results in the exposure of an extensive amount of epithelial tissue to harmful environmental agents and infectious organisms. the respiratory endoderm develops from a small cell cluster located in the ventral anterior stomodeum. epithelial cells of the primitive stomodeum cover the inner surface of the mesenchyme and bifurcate to form the proximal structures of tracheobronchial tree. epithelial cell, also an element of innate immunity, acts as a classic physical barrier as well as prevents inflammation by excreting cytokines and other mediators against harmful agents. excreted mucus contains antimicrobial molecules (defensin, bacteridisin, etc.), antiproteases, and antioxidants. the transmembrane proteins forming these tight junctions are connected to components of the cytoskeleton. the major junctional complex proteins include claudin, occludin, and junction adhesion molecule (JAM)-1. claudin, occludin, and occludin are in transmembrane orientation. claudin-1 is an example of a leaky claudin which is associated with interleukin-13 (IL-13)-induced STAT6-dependent increase in intestinal permeability. it is found in the intestines of patients with increased epithelium permeability or inflammatory bowel diseases. tricellulin was first identified at sites of tricellular epithelial contact, and is also shown to have barrier function. more research is needed concerning airway inflammation and the role of epithelial occludin and the TAMP family in asthma. TJs and AJs are linked to cytoplasmic proteins and attach to actin cytoskeleton. they attach directly to occludin and claudin at one end and bind to actin fibers at the other end. they are located directly beneath the TJs and consist of 2 basic adhesive parts. E-cadherin is believed to be necessary for the maintenance of cell structure and other TJ structures. the presence of low calcium concentration and blocking antibodies against E-cadherin causes fragmentation of E-cadherin itself but also ZO-1 and actin filaments. Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes are E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion structures which provide mechanical support to the tissue. they are located predominantly along the lateral surfaces of columnar epithelial cells, particularly toward the basal surface. they connect basal cells to the extracellular matrix in the basement membrane. claudin, occludin, and junction adhesion molecule (JAM)-1 have been identified. occludin has 27 different types and determines calcium-free cell adhesion. claudin-1 is necessary and sufficient for junction formation. claudin is associated with interleukin-13 (IL-13)-induced STAT6-dependent increase in intestinal permeability. it is found in the intestines of patients with increased epithelium permeability or inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease. the third respiratory TJ group is an immunoglobulin-like family. most notable members are the JAM and coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) they are receptors for several important viruses. AJs are adherence structures that surround the cell and create an intercellular space of 25\u201335 nm. they consist of 2 basic adhesive parts, referred to as the nectin-afadin and E-cadherin-catenin complexes. the degradation of actin filaments results in the functional and morphological disruption of TJ barriers. the functional activity and normal expression of E-cadherin are important for ensuring the continuity of TJs between epithelial cells and the continuity of normal intercellular barrier function. E-cadherin also modulates the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and -catenin to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. cell polarization in airway epithelium is closely related to cell polarization. polarity proteins are important for proper morphogenesis and for the maintenance of apical-basolateral polarization. epithelial cells express many cytokine and chemokine receptors. IL-4 and IL-3, cytokines associated with Th2-mediated immune response, and the epithelium-derived cytokines IL-25, IL-33, and Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) have crucial roles in pathogenesis of atopic asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS gen-presenting cells in the submucosa stimulate Th2-mediated immune response and EMT. -catenin released from its cytosolic segment is freed and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. the pseudostratified respiratory epithelium is seriously damaged and has to be restored to perform its defensive functions. the same results were found in the sinonasal epithelial cells obtained from CRSwNP and AR patients. most asthma patients (88%) have sinonasal inflammation, at least radiographically. asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease accompanied by structural changes involving various cellular components and cells. asthmatic inflammation is characterized by the dominance of Th2 cells and Th2-mediated chemokine and cytokine responses. it has been determined that the immune system is Th2-dominant in utero and in the early neonatal period. infections and endotoxin exposure early in life incline the immune system toward Th1. cockroaches, animal and fungal allergen components, proteases activate protease-activated receptors (PAR), which lead to proinflammatory gene transcription. PAR-2 receptors are expressed in the respiratory epithelium. the receptor itself causes signal activation that causes cytokine release. allergens with protease activity induce structural modifications only in asthma patients. indirect suppression of barrier proteins by inflammatory mediators in epithelial barrier damage. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. a hyperoxia-induced BPD model showed that BPD is accompanied by destruction of TJ structures in the lung, increased permeability of the pulmonary epithelial barrier, and a decline in concentrations of certain TJ proteins. the pathological findings in AR include increased respiratory epithelial barrier dysfunction. defective epithelial TJs and AJs are common feature of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. leaky epithelium may cause deeper penetration of inhaled allergens, bacteria, and viruses into the subepithelial zone. it is possible that epithelial cells are naturally abnormal in CRSwNP. bronchial epithelium plays a key role in the gene-environment interaction in asthma. it has also been reported that the bronchial epithelial cells of asthma patients exhibit antimicrobial response defects. biopsy studies conducted in children suggest structural changes in the respiratory epithelium may occur before the onset of airway inflammation. studies on the respiratory epithelium junctional proteins in asthma patients have repeatedly demonstrated reduced expression of ZO-1, E-cadherin, and occludin in the asthmatic epithelium. this indicates a major defect in adhesion mechanisms, which may make the respiratory epithelial cells more sensitive to allergens. proteases activate protease-activated receptors (PAR) which lead to proinflammatory gene transcription. PAR-2 receptors are expressed in the respiratory epithelium. the receptor itself causes cytokine release, metalloproteinase activation, antigen-triggered signal transduction, and airway hyperreactivity. cigarette smoke causes abnormal activation of canonical Wnt/-catenin signaling. exposure to chronic cigarette smoke reduces barrier function and facilitates invasion of the respiratory epithelium by environmental allergens, contaminants, and pathogens. RV infection in the respiratory epithelium contributes to the Th2 immune response by triggering the release of epithelial cytokines IL-33 and IL-25.5,71 IL-33 is considered an alarm signal for epithelial damage. RV and RSV impact epithelium integrity and reduce expression of epithelial junction proteins. many asthma genes recently identified in genome-wide association studies are expressed by respiratory structural cells, particularly the epithelium. polymorphisms in IL1RL1 and IL-33 are more strongly associated with early onset asthma ( 16 years) antenatal programming, genes, and the environment all play etiological roles in chronic adult illnesses such as COPD. factors adversely affecting pulmonary development include transgenerational (smoking grandmother), antenatal (exposure to tobacco and contaminants), and early childhood (exposure to tobacco and contaminants) influences. the PIAMA and ALSPAC studies found that at least 3 COPD genes were involved in lung growth and development. TEW-related airway development anomalies have been shown to be associated with reduced lung function even when symptoms disappear. the respiratory epithelium constitutes a potential key target for inhaler therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. glucocorticoids play a fundamental role in the function and maintenance of cell\u2013cell contact by inducing tight junction formation. however, their effects on the distribution and expression of AJ proteins (e-cadherin, -catenin, -catenin) are not completely clear. ICS may also reduce the EMT properties in the bronchial tissue of COPD patients. despite available treatment options such as intranasal steroids, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and immunotherapy, 20% of patients with AR do not respond favorably to treatment. blocking epithelial cytokines TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25 may be a powerful tool."}
