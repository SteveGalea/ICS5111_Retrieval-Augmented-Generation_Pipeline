{"summary": "nine herpesviruses have currently been associated with diseases in humans. three herpesviruses have been identified in mice. herpesviruses establish life-long persistent infections in their natural hosts. pDCs have been described to be the main IFN-I source upon herpesvirus stimulation. not determined IFN-I were the first cytokines discovered, a little over 50 years ago, based on their direct, potent and broad antiviral activity. IFN-I producing cells (IPCs) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in humans, pDCs are characterized by selective high levels of the C-type lectin CLEC4C and of the immunoglobulin superfamily member LILRA4. in mice, there are no orthologs of CLEC4C or LILRA4. mouse and human pDCs are identified by different markers. but they share many functional characteristics [31] and selective expression of over 200 genes compared to other leukocyte subsets [28] pDCs have been closely linked to the study of innate immune recognition of herpesviruses. pDCs produce high levels of all IFN-I in vitro in response to herpesviruses. pDCs produce up to a thousand fold more IFN-I than cDCs or monocytes. depletion of pDCs led to over a hundred fold decrease in PBMC production of IFN-I. pDCs are the main IFN-I producers among total circulating leukocytes stimulated in vitro with herpesviruses. pDCs are the major producers of IFN-I in vivo in mice infected with MCMV or HSV-2. pDCs are the major producers of systemic IFN-I in vivo during MCMV infection. pDCs expressed much higher amounts of the mRNA for all the different IFN- and IFN- subtypes tested as compared to other splenocytes. pDCs isolated from the spleen of MCMV-infected mice expressed much higher amounts of the mRNA for all the different IFN- and IFN- subtypes. pDCs (red circles), CD8 cDCs (blue diamonds) and CD11b cDCs (green triangles) were purified from C57BL/6 mice injected with vehicle (open symbols) or infected with MCMV for 36 h (closed symbols) the expression of mRNA (Y-axis, in arbitrary units in log10 scale) in the three DC subsets studied is represented. these data highlight the primordial role of pDCs as major IFN-I producers in response to systemic or local herpesvirus infections in vivo. pDCs are not the major producers of IFN-I with certain viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [12] or upon local infections of the airways such as with intranasal Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [47] or influenza [48,49] challenges. pDC-derived IFN-I directly contributes to the control of HSV-2 replication in vivo in mice upon systemic or local infections. in 129Sv mice, pDC-derived IFN-I likely contribute to MCMV control as anti-GR1 [12] or anti-BST2 (data not shown) antibody-mediated pDC depletion leads to a higher splenic viral load. pDC depletion on MCMV replication in 129Sv versus C57BL/6 mice could be the specific capacity of the latter to mount other innate immune responses redundant for this function. this antiviral function of NK cells depends on their activation by IFN-I [22] in 129Sv animals, low levels of residual IFN-I may be sufficient to promote efficient viral control by NK cells. pDCs are amongst most common opportunistic agents causing life-threatening disease in HIV-1-infected infants [60] or in AIDS patients [61,62] who have a dramatic reduction in pDC numbers and an impairment of pDC functions. pDCs are amongst most common opportunistic agents causing life-threatening disease in HIV-1-infected infants [61,62]. pDCs produce high levels of all IFN-I in vitro in response to herpesviruses. depletion of pDCs led to over a hundred fold decrease in PBMC production of IFN-I. human pDCs rapidly express mRNA of all the IFN-I family members. pDCs are the main IFN-I producers among total circulating leukocytes stimulated in vitro with herpesviruses. pDCs are the major producers of IFN-I in vivo in mice infected with MCMV or HSV-2. the resistance of pDCs to herpesvirus infection is not absolute. pDCs are the major producers of systemic IFN-I in vivo during MCMV infection. pDCs expressed much higher amounts of the mRNA for all the different IFN- and IFN- subtypes tested as compared to other splenocytes. the majority of IFN-I expressing cells in vivo in the spleen of infected mice were demonstrated to be pDCs. pDCs (red circles), CD8 cDCs (blue diamonds) and CD11b cDCs (green triangles) were purified from mice injected with vehicle (open symbols) or infected with MCMV for 36 h (closed symbols) the expression of mRNA (Y-axis, in arbitrary units in log10 scale) in the three DC subsets studied is represented. pDCs are not the major producers of IFN-I with certain viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [12] or upon local infections of the airways such as with intranasal Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [47] or influenza [48,49] challenges. pDCs contribute as well as pDCs to IFN-I production locally in the intestine [50] pDC-derived IFN-I directly contributes to the control of HSV-2 replication in vivo in mice upon systemic or local infections. in 129Sv mice, pDC-derived IFN-I likely contribute to MCMV control as anti-GR1 [12] or anti-BST2 (data not shown) antibody-mediated pDC depletion leads to a higher splenic viral load. 129Sv versus 129Sv mice have efficient anti-MCMV natural killer (NK) cell responses which are able to recognize and kill infected cells in vivo very rapidly after infection. this antiviral function of NK cells depends on their activation by IFN-I [22] in C57BL/6 mice but not in 129Sv animals, low levels of residual IFN-I may be sufficient to promote efficient viral control by NK cells. pDCs are amongst the most common opportunistic agents causing life-threatening disease in HIV-1-infected infants [60] or in AIDS patients [61,62] who have a dramatic reduction in pDC numbers and an impairment of pDC functions. pDCs are amongst the most common opportunistic agents causing life-threatening disease in HIV-1-infected infants [61,62]. pDCs produce multiple cytokines and chemokines in response to viruses. pDCs are not restricted to IFN-I production but globally contribute to the orchestration of inflammation. pDCs produce multiple cytokines and chemokines in response to viruses. pDC-derived IL-12 directly induces IFN- production by NK cells [13,22] while pDC-derived IFN-I induces NK cells to proliferate [22] and to acquire cytolytic granules containing perforin and granzyme B. pDCs stimulated with HCMV induce NK cells migration and IFN- secretion, but not cytotoxicity. pDCs are able to sense infection with herpesviruses through TLR9 and/or TLR7. pDCs are able to sense infection with herpesviruses through TLR9 and/or TLR7. pDCs can exert a variety of stimulatory or inhibitory functions on other innate or adaptive immune cells. pDCs produce multiple cytokines and chemokines in response to viruses. pDCs secret high levels of IFN-I but also produce significant amounts of IL-12p70, TNF-, and CCL3. pDCs can also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 in response to EBV stimulation. pDC-derived IL-12 directly induces IFN- production by NK cells [13,22] while pDC-derived IFN-I induces NK cells to proliferate [22] and to acquire cytolytic granules containing perforin and granzyme B. pDCs stimulated with HCMV induce NK cells migration and IFN- secretion, but not cytotoxicity. pDCs were initially characterized as professional IFN-I-producing cells upon in vitro stimulation with viruses or during viral infections in vivo. pDCs are able to sense infection with herpesviruses through TLR9 and/or TLR7. pDCs are able to sense infection with herpesviruses through TLR9 and/or TLR7. pDCs express a unique set of endosomal receptors (TLR) 7 and 9 [80] which are localized in a specific endosomal compartment where they can respectively recognize single stranded RNA versus unmethylated CpG DNA sequences. pDCs must be able to selectively recognize and engulf viral particles or apoptotic debris from infected cells. the study of myD88/ mice has allowed to demonstrate a crucial role of this molecule for pDC IFN-I production. TLR9 appears to be the only MyD88-associated receptor necessary for IFN-I production during HSV-2 infection [83], which is consistent with the known presence of unmethylated CpG DNA sequences in the genome of herpesviruses. pDCs have a particularly strong expression of TLR7 and an exquisite sensitivity to its specific ligands. pDCs have a particularly strong expression of TLR7 and an exquisite sensitivity to its specific ligands. a cross-regulation between TLR9 and TLR7 has recently been demonstrated in mouse cDCs. human and mouse pDCs express very high levels of IRF7 [80]. loss of IRF7 expression abolishes pDC responses to MCMV [52] or HSV-1. pDCs are characterized by a long retention time of CpG desoxyoligonucleotides. pDCs have been demonstrated to produce IFN-I in a feedback loop independent manner. in mice infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), pDCs have been demonstrated to produce IFN-I in a feedback loop independent manner. a significant production of IFN-I by pDCs still occurred in IFNAR/ animals. pDC production does not require endogenous viral replication in the cytoplasm. but only detection in endosomes of engulfed oligonucleotides derived from other infected cells. viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit both IFN-I production and IFN-I responses in infected cells very early on after their replication. pDCs express a unique set of endosomal receptors allowing the detection of RNA or DNA sequences derived from engulfed viruses or infected cells. this apparent paradox was solved by the demonstration that pDCs express a unique set of endosomal receptors. pDCs have the unique ability to detect viral infections without the requirement of endogenous viral replication. TLR9 appears to be the only MyD88-associated receptor necessary for IFN-I production during HSV-2 infection [83], which is consistent with the known presence of unmethylated CpG DNA sequences in the genome of herpesviruses. in contrast, during HSV-1 or MCMV infections, IFN-I production shows only a partial dependence on TLR9 [39,40,84,85] a cross-regulation between TLR9 and TLR7 has recently been demonstrated in mouse cDCs. pDCs have a particularly strong expression of TLR7 and an exquisite sensitivity to its specific ligands. pDCs have a particularly strong expression of TLR7. human and mouse pDCs constitutively express very high levels of IRF7 [80] in contrast, in cDCs and other cell types, IRF7 expression is induced only secondarily to a first, IRF3-dependent wave of IFN-/4 production [93] loss of IRF7 expression abolishes pDC responses to MCMV [52], HSV-1 and all other viral stimuli that have been tested [92] a significant production of IFN-I by pDCs still occurred in IFNAR/ animals. pDCs have been demonstrated to produce IFN-I in a feedback loop independent manner. the impact of pDC autocrine IFN-I responses has also been studied recently. pDCs appear resistant to productive viral infection by several herpesviruses. in contrast, pDCs constitutively express IRF7 at very high levels. pDCs may have a non redundant role in rapid systemic production of IFN-I. pDCs express several endocytic receptors which signal through a specific ITAM-dependent pathway and inhibit TLR-induced cytokine production. the mouse SIGLECH C-type lectin receptor which associates with the ITAM-bearing adaptor DAP12 has also been shown to inhibit pDC cytokine responses to TLR stimulations in vitro. human pDCs are uniquely equipped to sense the paracrine response to their production of IFN-I. this allows for a negative feedback loop to prevent excessive production of the cytokines that could cause deleterious effects to the host. other intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms contribute to dampen pDC activation. control of viral replication by IFN-I and other innate immune mechanisms decreases TLR ligand availability and contributes to dampen pDC activation. pDC cytokine responses to MCMV infection also increase dramatically in mice unable of efficient innate control of viral replication early after challenge. early treatment of infected mice with an antiviral drug leads to a dramatic decrease of pDC cytokine production. pDCs are equipped with a unique set of sensors and associated signaling pathways to rapidly sense a variety of viruses. pDCs appear to play an important, non redundant role in vivo in innate immune defense against herpesviruses and other viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus. pDC activation during viral infections appears to be tightly controlled in intensity, space, and time. human pDCs are uniquely equipped to sense the paracrine response to their production of IFN-I. this allows for a negative feedback loop to prevent excessive production of the cytokines that could cause deleterious effects to the host. other intrinsic inhibition mechanisms contribute to dampen pDC responses to TLR triggering. the control of viral replication by IFN-I and other innate immune mechanisms decreases TLR ligand availability and contributes to dampen pDC activation. early treatment of infected mice with an antiviral drug leads to a dramatic decrease of pDC cytokine production during MCMV infection. pDCs appear to play an important, non redundant role in vivo in innate immune defense against herpesviruses and other viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus. pDCs are not only professional producers of IFN-I and key players in innate immune defenses against viral infections. pDCs can contribute to the promotion of antiviral adaptive immunity. cDCs have been known to be specialized in antigen processing and presentation to nave T cells leading to the induction of specific adaptive cellular immune responses. cDCs have been reported to be poor activators of nave T cells. both mouse and human pDCs have been shown able to cross-present exogenous antigens to efficiently activate nave or memory CD8 T cells. pDCs have been shown to harbor a unique endocytic compartment containing premade stores of MHC class I which allow rapid processing of exogenous antigens for cross-presentation to CD8 T cells. pDCs promoted optimal functions of cDCs via cell-to-cell contacts involving CD2 and CD40L. in vitro stimulation of pDCs with HCMV or influenza promoted B cell activation. pDCs also play a key role in linking innate and adaptive immunity through their production of immunoregulatory cytokines. pDCs can downmodulate CD4 T cell activation directly through production of IFN-I and IL-10. pDCs have also been shown to express the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), which can induce T cell tolerance through tryptophan catabolism and downstream production of pro-apoptotic metabolites. pDCs can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. regulatory T cells induced by pDCs could favor the development of highly specific adaptive immune responses targeted to the invading virus. regulatory T cells promote the trafficking of innate and adaptive antiviral effectors out of the lymph nodes to the site of infection for local control of viral replication. pDCs maintain MHC class II synthesis and ubiquitination after antigen capture. this specialization may allow pDCs to present to CD4 T cells some microbial antigens synthesized late after the initial encounter with the infectious agent. cDCs are already activated by the primary infectious agents and are impaired in their ability to respond to the secondary infection by the herpesviruses. infected animals up-regulate CD80, CD86, CD40 as well as MHC molecules and efficiently prime naive CD8 T cells in vitro for proliferation and IFN- production. neither the ability of pDCs to naturally process and present MCMV antigens nor the role of pDCs in the global shaping of antiviral CD8 T cells responses have been addressed during the course of MCMV infection. pDCs can contribute to the negative regulation of adaptive immunity. antimicrobial immunity must be tightly regulated to allow the mounting of effector responses of sufficient strength and adequate quality for the control of the invading pathogen. pDC expression of IDO has been demonstrated in vivo in mice for the generation of an immunosuppressive environment in tumors. there is currently no evidence that IDO can be expressed by pDCs in the course of infections by herpesviruses. the addition of an IDO inhibitor in cocultures of pDCs and CD4 T cells did not prevent the induction of regulatory T cells. ged Sword: It Contributes to the Control of Viral Replication. but can also Take part in the Induction of Immunosuppression or Immunopathology. situations have been described where pDC responses are deleterious for the host. pDCs have been reported to be hyperactivated during infection. pDCs have been reported to contribute to immune deregulation and disease by a number of mechanisms. recent investigations strongly suggest that pDCs play a deleterious role for host during infections with HIV-1 or SIV. FN- by TLR9 triggering on HCMV-infected fibroblasts has been reported to promote their survival and increase their production of viral particles. however, this proviral effect occurred only when fibroblasts were simulated with CpG shortly after infection. it is unlikely that this mechanism plays a significant proviral role to the disadvantage of the host during infections with most herpesviruses in vivo. immunosuppression can be recapitulated by exogenous administration of IFN-I in mouse strains that mount low pDC responses to MCMV infection. this impact of pDC functions on the kinetics of induction of antiviral adaptive immunity is striking given the recent observation that better outcomes of early primary viral infection with LCMV in mice or SIV in macaques correlate with increased ratio between antigen-specific CD8 T cells. this proviral effect occurred only when fibroblasts were simulated with CpG shortly after infection. a treatment concomitant to viral challenge almost completely abrogated fibroblast infection and virus production. however, it is unlikely that this mechanism plays a significant proviral role to the disadvantage of the host during infections with most herpesviruses in vivo. pDC-derived IFN-I has been shown to contribute to the disease induced by MCMV infection. pDCs could also contribute to these effects since they are the major source of TNF- early after infection in different mouse strains. a deleterious role of pDCs has been proposed for SLE or psoriasis. anti-BST2 antibody-mediated pDC depletion in vivo abrogated the protection. this treatment has proven efficient even in the case of recurrent lesions caused by viruses resistant to the classical antiviral drug acyclovir. in mice, boosting pDC responses has also been shown to enhance resistance to systemic infection with MCMV or HSV-1. this has been achieved either through the systemic administration of the Thymosin-1 peptide [41] or of FLT3L [162] in both cases, enhanced protection against the viral infection resulted from increased IFN-I or IL-12 production. for the MCMV infection, this was shown to depend on the activation of the TLR9/MyD pesvirus infections have been suggested to be potential triggers. dampening of pDC responses in vivo could be a reasonable component of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing the immunopathology in these different conditions. herpesviruses are well controlled by immunocompetent hosts. most humans are infected by HCMV, EBV, or HSV. all three viruses appear particularly efficient at activating pDCs. pDCs were recruited in the vaginal mucosa 24 hours after CpG treatment. anti-BST2 antibody-mediated pDC depletion in vivo abrogated the protection. this treatment has proven efficient even in cases of recurrent lesions caused by viruses resistant to the classical antiviral drug acyclovir [161] a significant but controlled pDC activation is required to promote health over disease. therapeutic protocols aimed at boosting or dampening pDC responses could thus help to reach this balance. in mice, boosting pDC responses has also been shown to enhance resistance to systemic infection with MCMV or HSV-1. pDCs have been involved in autoimmune diseases for which certain herpesvirus infections have been suggested to be potential triggers. dampening of pDC responses in vivo could be a reasonable component of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing the immunopathology in these different conditions (Scheme 2). herpesviruses are well controlled by immunocompetent hosts, since most humans are infected by HCMV, EBV, or HSV, and yet do not develop clinical symptoms. pDCs may contribute to the induction of the strong, protective, adaptive immune responses observed to occur naturally in most infected individuals. pDCs have a unique ability to rapidly produce high and systemic levels of IFN-I during stimulations or infections by herpesviruses. pDCs are the major source of IFN-I during stimulations or infections by herpesviruses. pDCs are likely to play a non redundant role in the induction and regulation of these viral infections. pDCs can promote antiviral CD8 T cell responses through cDC instruction. pDCs can promote antiviral CD8 T cell responses in vivo during viral infections. pDCs are also able to inducing antiviral T lymphocytes in vivo. major concepts and outstanding questions regarding pDC responses to herpesviruses IFN-I are innate cytokines endowed with potent direct and indirect antiviral activities. the expression of the receptor for IFN-I is ubiquitous and allows widespread systemic effects of the cytokines. pDCs are the main producers in response to many viruses including all the herpesviruses tested. pDCs play an important deleterious role in the development of the disease. in the mouse model of MCMV infection, pDC hyperactivation can induce a transient suppression of antiviral adaptive immunity likely due in part to deleterious effects of high systemic levels of IFN-I on cDCs or CD8 T cells. to TLR stimulations, such as macaques and sooty mangabeys, would be enlightening."}
