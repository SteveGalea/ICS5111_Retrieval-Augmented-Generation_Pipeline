{"summary": "state and local health departments in the united states have accelerated efforts to prepare for high-impact public health emergencies. participants developed, conducted, and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the US from 2003 to 2006. participants self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves. fema describes six levels of exercises that simulate real life experiences. participants may be limited to public health staff or involve representatives from partners or organizations. participants may be limited to public health staff or involve representatives from partners or organizations. tabletop exercises focus on single disease, such as smallpox [21], pandemic influenza [22], or a novel virus [23]. these exercises have focused attention on the interaction between preparedness goals and exercise strategies. the literature dealing with tabletop exercises to date consists almost entirely of case studies and descriptions of a single exercise. south medium smallpox 5.0 limited 14 South medium botulism 6.0

remaining projects were funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services. the first project involved developing ten different tabletop exercise templates and formats focusing on the local public health response to bioterrorist agents. the second project involved developing a tabletop exercise to examine the interface between local health departments and health care systems in a hypothetical influenza pandemic. each exercise concluded with a \"hot wash\" in which participants discussed their collective performance. participants were asked to identify key gaps in preparedness that occurred during the exercise. participants completed exercise evaluation forms. common challenges observed Across Participating Health Departments Issue Area Observed Challenges Surveillance and investigation \u2022 Notification of non-hospital health care providers \u2022 Level and type of staff involvement \u2022 Reaching vulnerable populations \u2022 Communicating with response partners Command and control \u2022 Full implementation of ICS and EOC. public health officials often responded defensively to early and sometimes unexpected media requests. they had trouble quickly formulating an initial message to the public that was clear, informative, and alleviated anxiety. in some communities, health departments had limited language capacities or were not sufficiently familiar with community leaders to communicate effectively with these groups. state health departments surprised local health departments by assuming roles and responsibilities. a general consensus among local health departments was that CDC staff would be on the ground to help them fairly quickly. local health departments often reported that there were not enough local health care workers to manage these sites even if they could create them. the most commonly observed strengths were strong relationships between epidemiologists and hospital infection control practitioners and between public health workers and other emergency coordinators. the most commonly observed strengths were strong relationships between epidemiologists and hospital infection control practitioners and between public health workers and other emergency coordinators. if the objective of the exercise is evaluation, this type of facilitator involvement can lead the participants to choose a different course of action. a facilitator intervention implying that a participant made a mistake could be embarrassing or diminish that person's credibility. some departures from reality may be inadvertent if scenarios are developed with insufficient attention to local routines. a set of exercises we designed focused on pandemic influenza preparedness in local health departments. it was infeasible to exercise the entire pandemic plan around a single scenario. participants should be given a limited amount of time to discuss this issue and make a decision. participants may be less comfortable discussing ideas, taking risks, or making mistakes, depending on who is in the room. one solution would be to sequentially stage the involvement of different participants or to physically separate different groups in a way that more closely mimics actual situations. nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges. these challenges represent critical dimensions of an outbreak response. a related issue was the ability of health departments to realistically generate enough surge capacity in their public health workforce. communications Few of the health departments in which we conducted exercises were proactive in their contacts with the media. most waited until they were contacted by the media to begin communicating with the public. health departments expressed uncertainty about how to effectively communicate with vulnerable or underrepresented population groups in their jurisdictions. local public health officials delayed taking these steps and preferred maintaining a more informal management process. in many exercises, state health departments surprised local health departments by assuming roles and responsibilities local health departments regarded as their own. the general consensus among local health departments was that CDC staff would be on the ground to help them fairly quickly. local health departments did not have a structured process for notifying or soliciting case reports from health care providers other than those in hospitals. local officials were sometimes unsure about their direct role in following up with suspected ill patients and collecting and shipping clinical samples for laboratory testing. a related issue was the ability of health departments to realistically generate enough surge capacity in their public health workforce to investigate or respond to a large event. enforcement and EMS personnel present in exercises could help identify trusted community messengers. in some communities, health departments had limited language capacities or were not sufficiently familiar with community leaders to communicate effectively with these groups. response partners often reported feeling either left out of the process or expressed concerns about continuing to work unless the risks were clarified. local health departments articulated some type of plan for increasing medical surge capacity by developing alternative care sites. many health care participants reported that there were not enough local health care workers to manage these sites even if they could create them. some staff would likely be double-counted, especially nurses and security officers who might work in several institutions. exercises were conducted over a period of several years. compared to earlier exercises, health departments appeared more sophisticated. by the end of the exercise period, health departments had considered surge capacity. participating hospitals had explicit plans for cancelling emergency surgery. the optimal mix of design elements represents a balance between exercise objectives and logistic feasibility. some departures from reality may be inadvertent if scenarios are developed with insufficient attention to local routines. even seemingly minor design errors, such as using an outdated name for a hospital, can undermine the credibility of the exercise. participants should be given a limited amount of time to discuss this issue and make a decision. participants may be less comfortable discussing ideas, taking risks, or making mistakes. participants may be less comfortable discussing ideas, taking risks or making mistakes. the disadvantage of this approach is that it diminishes the opportunity for people from different groups to gain an understanding of one another's role and approach to problems. one solution is to split exercise participants into two or more groups that allow everyone to participate, often placing people at similar levels of responsibility in the same group. objective of the

benefit from collaborative engagement of representatives from participating agencies and external developers and facilitators. differences in state or local priorities for prioritizing exercise objectives. some emphasized early response to initial reports of suspect illness. others emphasized management of surges in demand for health care services. we cannot asses the potential influences that external events may have had on health departments during the time period of our work. the evidence base for determining best practices in the design and conduct of exercises is extremely thin. authors declare that they have no competing interests. Threat Initiative (NTI) is a threat initiative initiative. we appreciate the assistance of Patrick Libbey and NACCHO."}
