{"summary": "laboratory testing remains the dominant mainstay for analytical processes of a large number of samples involving the disciplines of biochemistry, haematology, microbiology, anatomical pathology, and much more. primary care is best suited for the world to reduce expenses instead of secondary and tertiary hospitals. however, adequate diagnostic testing turns out to be difficult to meet the needs. saliva in the Diagnosis of Oral and Systemic Diseases Saliva is a complex fluid containing various enzymes, electrolytes, proteins, nucleic acids, antimicrobial constituents, hormones, cytokines, and antibodies. the submandibular gland saliva of cystic fibrosis patients contains 66% more lipids per 100 mL of saliva than that of a healthy subject. salivary fatty acid profile can be a good indicator for early detection the increase in salivary arachidonic acid production is influenced by dietary fat intake. alterations of biomarkers in various body organs in diseased states through which saliva can detect various oral and systemic diseases. a cheap and easy sampling of saliva is attractive as a diagnostic fluid for diabetes analysis. a recently-reported study saw a marked alteration in levels of salivary glucose, amylase, calcium, and phosphorus in comparison to serum from diabetic and non-diabetic patients [32]. pulmonary inflammation biomarkers End-stage renal disease (ESRD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients Optical fibre microarrays [43]. the current review presents a broad overview on salivary diagnostics, the validation of biomarkers (diagnostic targets) through diagnostic toolboxes. technology, electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM) and smartphone-based biosensors their functions and clinical utility in medical field. paradigm Shift from central laboratory to Point-of-Care A self-monitoring blood glucose meter, coagulation (INR) and pregnancy testing kits using urine samples are well-known examples of PoCT. saliva is a complex fluid containing various enzymes, electrolytes, proteins, nucleic acids, antimicrobial constituents, hormones, cytokines, and antibodies. it has the potential of being a diagnostic medium for a broad range of diseases [15,16], such as in the detection of periodontal diseases, caries risk assessments, breast cancer, oral cancers, salivary gland diseases, HIV, and much more. lipid profile of SS patients is twice higher than an average healthy person. lipid profile of SS patients is twice higher than an average healthy person. many salivary proteins were reported as biomarkers for SS diagnosis. Point of care (PoC) devices for detection of diseases through specific salivary biomarkers.
