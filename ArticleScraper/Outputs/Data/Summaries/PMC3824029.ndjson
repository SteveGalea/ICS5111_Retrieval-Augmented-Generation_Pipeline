{"summary": "we identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression profiles for both COPD and emphysema. pathways associated with COPD include cell signaling, transcription factors, and sphingolipid metabolism. these genes and pathways could serve as both diagnostic tests and therapeutic targets. 80 48 25 50 32 41 0.1321 Age 60.6 (7.6) 60.5 (9.1) 65.8 (10.5) 61.8 (9.1) 68.6 (6.0) 64.4 (6.0) 0.0033 Pack-years 38.1 (17.9) 44.5 (28.5) 51.0 (38.2) 44.8 (23.2) 53.8 (22.8) 57.34 (30.0) 0.0338 Current smokers*, % 50 32 12 32 12 12 0.0903 Body mass index 29.1 (6.9) 28.0 clinical variables COPD is defined as post\u2013bronchodilator airflow obstruction with a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced expiratory volume (FVC) of less than 0.70. subjects with FEV1/FVC greater than or equal to 70 and FEV1 percentage of less than 80% post\u2013bronchodilator were considered GOLD unclassified (25). pathway analysis Genes whose expression levels were associated with lung function were further investigated using IPA (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) the overrepresentation of significant genes within pathways was assessed using Fisher's exact test, and the FDR was controlled at 0.10. Expression was determined as fold change compared with a panel of five control genes. 74 subjects in the hypothesis group were randomly selected as a confirmation group. 74 subjects in the hypothesis group were randomly selected as a confirmation group. the 75 independent replication subjects were selected. 0.0001 Definition of abbreviations: FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC, forced expiratory volume; GOLD, Global Initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; U, unclassified. for categorical covariates, a GOLD stage\u2013specific percentage is given. expression of 54,675 transcripts was measured using Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation spin-column kits and protocol, combined with the fully automated Qiagen QIAcube (both from Qiagen, Valencia, CA). a linear model was fit for the association between gene expression and lung function while controlling for age, sex, body mass index, parental history of COPD. clinical phenotypes were associated with GOLD stage, pack-years of smoking, and current smoking status. separate linear models for the remaining 12,531 transcripts were fit for post-bronchodilator FEV1 percentage and FEV1/FVC across the 136 subjects. gene expression found to be statistically significant in the analysis of forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced expiratory volume. red represents a positive slope with the phenotype, green represents a negative slope with the phenotype. each node may represent related molecules, and double lines indicate a family of molecules. the microarray (n = 136) and quantitative RT-PCR (n = 75, i.e., the replication cohort not contained in the original microarray study) table 2 lists the top 16 candidates for both panels (FDR 0.05). genes with significant fold-change expression correlations in other phenotypes (emphysema, gas trapping, and distance walked) genes with significant fold-change expression correlations in other phenotypes (emphysema, gas trapping, and distance walked) the box plots have been separated into panels, where outliers are displayed at the top. the line segment below each box in the plot is the first quartile, the box segment above this line is the second quartile, and the box segment above the median is the fourth quartile. the estimated error rate was approximately 14%, based on the expression of probe sets for these genes. no significant overlap was found with our gene list and the differentially expressed genes between disease and control subjects in any of the three studies (P > 0.20). PBMC expression profiles have some specificity to COPD, and are not solely attributable to a general disease state. 830 genes of the 993 statistically significant transcripts mapped to 266 canonical pathways. a large fraction of those (15 out of 30) were related to immunity and inflammatory responses. twenty-six of the 46 genes profiled showed significant correlation between expression and FEV1/FVC. current smoking status was not predictive of gene expression for any individual probe set on the microarray. values below 0.01 are in bold, and values between 0.01 and 0.05 are in italics. genes with significant fold-change expression correlations in other phenotypes (emphysema, gas trapping, and distance walked, and distance walked) association of PBMC Gene Expression with Secondary Clinical Phenotypes Many of the 16 candidate genes associated with airflow obstruction were also associated with secondary clinical phenotypes (FDR 0.05). twelve were correlated with emphysema, 13 were correlated with gas trapping, and eight were correlated with distance walked. a recent study reported on whole-blood microarray gene expression experiments using the Sentrix Human WG-6 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) microarray platform in 67 test subjects with 69 confirmation subjects. a meta-analysis with our results identified a significant overlap of 61 genes. PBMCs have been used to identify gene signatures from diseases as diverse as exertional heat injury (31), sepsis (32), and multiple sclerosis (33) PBMCs have been used to discriminate between subjects with healthy lungs and those with lung diseases such as chronic beryllium disease (34), lung cancer (35), and pulmonary hypertension (36), as well as to distinguish disease activity among patients with severe asthma (37), lung cancer (37). the PBMC microarray approach was used previously in small discovery studies of PBMCs from 38 research subjects (21) and 24 subjects undergoing resection for lung tumors (20), as well as whole-blood leukocytes (which contain predominantly neutrophils) in 67 training research subjects (22). these cohorts were limited by small sample size as well as a lack of comprehensive phenotyping (e.g., no emphysema according to high-resolution computed tom the candidate genes in each pathway were prohibitive for replication. a quantitative RT-PCR strategy included the most highly significant and those represented in pathways of interest. ASAH1 encodes the enzyme N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase. lipids that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration, and ceramides such as acid ceramidase (ASAH1) catalyze the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine (44). this is the first report identifying galabiosylceramide as a biomarker of COPD. vanin 2 (VNN2) codes for a pantetheine hydrolase that is expressed in most tissues but demonstrates high expression in leukocytes. an association between VNN2 expression in whole blood and COPD was also found in the cohort described by Edmiston and colleagues. the mechanism by which Vanin 2 might cause COPD is unknown. the expression profiling was restricted to one racial and ethnic group (non-Hispanic whites) by using COPDGene, we were able to leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort of subjects with COPD. the candidate genes identified in this study suggest new disease targets and further mechanistic studies."}
