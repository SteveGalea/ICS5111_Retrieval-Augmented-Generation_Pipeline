{"summary": "PRRS is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory syndromes and persistent infection in young pigs. atypical PRRS is characterized by high fever, high morbidity, and high mortality in pigs of all ages. RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapies have been widely studied for treating fatal disorders or virus infection (20) however, most studies of viral infection in vivo have been based on exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) rather than host miRNAs except one case in which host miR-122 was confirmed as a target for HCV treatment by therapeutic silencing of endogenous miR-122 in HCV-infected primates. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from SPF pigs by Ficoll-Paque (Sigma) density gradient centrifugation according to manufacturer's instructions. peritoneal macrophages were obtained by lavage of the peritoneal cavity of SPF pigs. the cDNA was amplified with pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in 20 cycles of PCR using Illumina's small RNA primers selecting for 80- to 115-bp products on a 12% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) PAGE gel. a total of 10 l was sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx system following the vendor's instructions. miRNA target prediction and conservation analysis. miRNA mimics are double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides modified by 2\u2032-O-methyl with sequence complementary to the mature miRNA annotated in miRBase. for miR-181 mutants, the corresponding non-seed-mutated miR-181a mimic (L1U, L9U, and L1L9U) or seed-mutated miR-181 family mimic (a-m, b-m, c-m, negative-control (NC) mimic sequence is as follows: 5\u2032-UUC UCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3\u2032. all miRNA or NC mimics were transfected into PAMs or Marc-145 cells at a concentration of 60 nM. universal adapter primer (5\u2032-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACTATAGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3\u2032) diluted 40-l cDNA was then diluted in RNase-free water (1:20) 9 l of the diluted cDNA was amplified using a FastSYBR mixture (CWBIO) for detection of 2\u2032-O-methyl-modified miR-181. expression levels were analyzed using the Ct method (37), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was set up for use as an endogenous control. all PCR experiments were done in triplicate.

PBMCs were isolated from SPF pigs by ficoll-Paque (Sigma) density gradient centrifugation according to manufacturer's instructions. deep sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Houston, TX) on PAMs inoculated with a mock dose or with PRRSV CH-1a at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 24 h. cDNA fragments 15 to 50 nucleotides (nt) in length were isolated by the use of a denaturing PAGE gel. miRNA targets in PRRSV JXwn06 or CH-1a RNA were predicted by RegRNA (32) or ViTa (33) for conservation analysis, we aligned targeting sequences in 171 virus strains. miRNA mimics are double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides modified by 2\u2032-O-methyl with sequence complementary to the mature miRNA annotated in miRBase. the negative-control (NC) mimic sequence is as follows. all the miRNA or NC mimics were transfected into PAMs or Marc-145 cells at a concentration of 60 nM.
