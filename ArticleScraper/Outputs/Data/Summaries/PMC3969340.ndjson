{"summary": "PRRS is caused by PRRS virus, an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus belongs to the family Arteriviridae. there are broadly two distinct PRRSV genotypes, the European (type I) and the North American (type II) which possess a wide range of intra- and intergenotypic, genetic, and antigenic diversity. developing preventive measures to control PRRS outbreaks has been a challenge to the global swine industry. poly(lactide-co-glycolide) is a synthetic biodegradable polymer used successfully in particulate delivery of inactivated vaccines. the adjuvant Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate was shown to increase immunogenicity of both live PRRSV vaccine and PLGA-nanoparticles entrapped with killed PRRSV antigens (NP-KAg) preparation of killed PRRSV vaccine antigens Killed PRRSV vaccine antigens (KAg) were prepared as described earlier. bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation of colony scrapings at 3000 g and washed with PBS. the bacterial cell wall was disrupted by bead beater. the cell lysate was centrifuged at 3000 g to pellet unbroken cells. endotoxin levels in every batch of M. tb WCL were confirmed to be less than acceptable levels (0.002 g/mg) a total of 30 pigs were randomly divided into one of the ten groups (n=3 pigs/group) and vaccinated with the indicated vaccine formulation, intranasally (2 mL/pig), twice at 2-week intervals. all the pigs were intranasally challenged with a virulent heterologous North American PRRSV (type II) strain MN184 (5 105 median tissue culture infective dose [TCID50]/pig) a total of 30 pigs were divided in to ten groups (n=3 per group) group 1 and 2 served as mock and mock vaccinated-challenged. group 1 and 2 served as mock and mock vaccinated-challenged. the harvested fluid was centrifuged at 2,851 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the clarified BAL fluid was aliquoted and stored at 70\u00b0C. the lung mononuclear cells from the individual pig lungs were isolated. a reference pig serum (Bethyl Labs) diluted twofold serially from a initial concentration of 1,000 ng/mL for IgA and IgM. a reference pig serum (Bethyl Labs) diluted twofold serially from an initial concentration of 1,000 ng/mL for IgA and IgM. a reference pig serum (Bethyl Labs) was used to generate the standard curves for each antibody isotype. washed plates (4) were treated with serially twofold diluted ammonium thiocyanate (NH4CN) (100 L/well) solution at 5 to 0.313 Mol concentration. plates were washed (4) and the remaining steps of ELISA carried out as described above. phosphoric acid, and the plates were read at OD450nm. for calculation of the PRRSV-specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibody levels, the OD values obtained at 1:500 dilution was considered. cytokines by ELISA Lung homogenates were analyzed for pig cytokines, Th1 (IFN- and interleukin [IL-12]), proinflammatory (IL-6), and immunosuppressive (IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-]) phenotypes and frequencies of lymphoid and myeloid cells populations from immunostained LMNCs were determined by flow cytometry as described previously. 80%\u201390% confluent monolayer of MARC-145 cells was treated with tenfold dilution of test samples for 48 hours. test samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and UV-inactivated at 254 nm for 45 minutes. diluted samples were incubated with one of the PRRSV strains. extracted RNA was reverse transcribed into complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) using Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) the cDNA was subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using primers against PRRSV ORF6 in PerfeCta SYBR Green Fast Mix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with forward primer (G LMNCs isolated on the day of necropsy were unstimulated or stimulated with killed PRRSV MN184 Ags and immunostained using a combination of indicated pig lymphocyte-specific cell surface markers followed by intracellular IFN- and analyzed by flow cytometry. only stimulated LMNCs were compared for indicated IFN-+ lymphocyte subsets: CD4+CD8IFN-+ (F and N); CD4+CD8+IFN-+ the unpaired t-test was applied to compare the data of only (C\u2013E) for the other data, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s t-test was used. preparation of killed PRRSV vaccine antigens Killed PRRSV vaccine antigens were prepared as described earlier. the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation of colony scrapings at 3000 g and washed with PBS (pH 7.4). bacterial cells were suspended [2 g (wet weight)/mL] in PBS containing 8 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) a total of 30 pigs were randomly divided into one of the ten groups (n=3 pigs/group) and vaccinated with the indicated vaccine formulation, intranasally (2 mL/pig), twice at 2-week intervals. all the pigs were intranasally challenged on postvaccination day 28 with a virulent heterologous North American PRRSV (type II) strain MN184. pigs were monitored daily for the respiratory symptoms, and rectal temperatures and body weights were recorded every third day postchallenge (PC15) animals were euthanized on day PC15 as per the approved protocol of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, The Ohio State University. pig lungs were examined for gross lesions in all the lobes. lung samples collected from the right cranial lobe were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and sections (5 m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with pretitrated dilution of (1:1,000) of goat antipig IgM, IgG, or IgA. the plates were blocked and the concentration of individual antibody isotypes was determined initially by titration of tenfold diluted lung homogenate. the reaction was developed using ABTS (2,2\u2032-Azinobis) solution containing 0.3% H2O2 and stopped using 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. background subtracted OD value of tenfold diluted mock pig sample was considered. KAg-coated plates were blocked and a serial tenfold diluted lung homogenate was added. mouse antipig IgG1 or IgG2 antibody was added to detect virus-specific IgG1 or IgG2 subtype. pig cytokines, Th1 (IFN- and interleukin [IL-12]), proinflammatory (IL-6) and immunosuppressive (IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-] were first immunostained using pig lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated with different fluorochromes. cells were washed and stained with a fluorochrome-conjugated antipig IFN- or its isotype control monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences) in 0.1% saponin containing fluorescence activated cell sorting buffer. all the specific immune cell frequencies were presented as the percent of total lymphocytes or myeloid cells. cells were fixed and fluorescent foci units were examined after treatment with mouse anti-PRRSV N monoclonal antibody (SDOW-17; RTI, LLC, Brookings, SD, USA) plates were observed under an inverted fluorescent microscope after mounting with 60% glycerol-PBS (pH 8). extracted RNA was reverse transcribed into complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) using Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Venlo, pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. pigs were unstimulated or stimulated with killed PRRSV MN184 Ags. CD4+CD8IFN-+ (F and N); CD4+CD8+IFN-+ (G and O); +IFN-+ (I and Q); and total NK (CD56+) (L and T) and dendritic cell-rich (CD172+CD11c+SLA-II+) (M and U) populations. entrapment efficiency of KAg and M. tb WCL in NPs was 50%\u201360%. the scanning electron microscope imaging indicated that sham or entrapped NP particles were spherical with a smooth surface. gG levels were significantly reduced in lung homogenate compared to unentrapped KAg-adjuvant inoculated pigs. pigs were analyzed for estimation of total IgM (A and D), IgG (B and E) and IgA (C and F); and also PRRSV-specific IgA (G and H) and IgG (I and J) Enhanced PRRSV-specific antibody response in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs PRRSV-specific IgA response was significantly higher both in the BAL fluid and lung homogenate of both low (100 g/pig) and high (500 g/pig) levels of virus-specific IgG were comparable in the BAL fluid of all the virus-challenged pig groups. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination. balanced Th1 and Th2 antibody responses in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs T helper type (Th)1- or Th2- biased immune response is measured by quantifying antigen-specific IgG antibody subtypes. in pigs, comparable levels of both IgG2 and IgG1 subtypes were secreted in lung homogenate. each bar indicates the average OD405nm, ratio of OD405nm of IgG1:IgG2 or VN titer of three pigs SEM. each bar indicates the average OD405nm, ratio of OD405nm of IgG1:IgG2. the lung VN titers against both PRRSV 1-4-4 and SD03-15 strains were significantly greater in Group 6 pigs receiving the high-dose vaccine compared to Group 5 and Group 3 respectively. the soluble NP-KAg vaccine elicits broadly cross-reactive VN titers. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine. lung homogenates were analyzed for: IFN- (B and H); IL-6 (C and I); IL-12 (D and J); TGF- (E and K); and IL-10 (F and L) by ELISA. LMNCs, lung mononuclear cells; NP-KAg, nanoparticle-entrapped killed antigen; NP-WCL, nanoparticle-entrapped whole-cell lysate of M. tb; PRRSV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; TGF-, transforming growth factor beta; Th1, T helper type 1; WCL, whole-cell lysate of M. tb; M. tb, Mycobacter PRRSV-specific IFN-secreting lymphocyte subsets in only restimulated cells were compared among different vaccine trial groups. only in group 6 animals (both vaccines doses) significantly increased CD4+CD8IFN-+ cells compared to Group 2 animals. CD4+CD8+IFN-+ and IFN-+ T cells were significantly higher in Group 6 pigs compared to other groups.

PRRSV-specific antibody response in pigs vaccinated with adjuvanted NP-KAg. reduced levels of total lung IgG (B) but increased amounts of PRRSV isotype-specific IgA (G and H) and IgG antibodies (J) V-specific IgA response was significantly higher in the BAL fluid and lung homogenate of both low (100 g/pig) and high (500 g/pig) doses of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs compared to most of the vaccine trial groups. levels of virus-specific IgG were comparable in the BAL fluid of all the virus-challenged pig groups. high avidity PRRSV-specific antibodies were produced in the lungs of pigs vaccinated with adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. each symbol indicates the mean percent absorbance value in experimental wells. ratio of IgG1:IgG2, if greater or less than one, indicates Th2- or Th1- biased response, respectively. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. asterisk indicates statistically significant difference between the two indicated pig groups. a heterologous PRRSV (strain MN184) is genetically highly divergent (15%) compared to the vaccine strain VR2332.24. the VN titers against both PRRSV 1-4-4 and SD03-15 strains were significantly greater in Group 6 pigs receiving the high-dose vaccine compared to Group 5 and Group 3 respectively. the soluble NP-KAg vaccine elicits broadly cross-reactive VN titers. the VN titers observed in BAL fluid were low (data not shown) pigs were vaccinated with adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine (B\u2013F and H\u2013L) LMNCs isolated on the day of necropsy were restimulated with killed MN184 Ags. frequency of ISCs was measured by ELISPOT (A and G) TGF-, transforming growth factor beta, Th1, T helper type 1; WCL, whole-cell lysate of M. tb; M. tb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IL-10 and TGF- play a vital role in PRRSV pathogenesis. CD4+CD8IFN-+ and IFN-+ T cells were significantly higher in Group 6 pigs compared to other groups. increased frequency of activated T cells was detected in group 6 pigs compared to other groups. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination. each number is an average frequency of indicated immune cell from three pigs standard error of mean. significant clearance of challenged PRRSV load in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs In the BAL fluid of pig Groups 4 and 6 (low vaccine dose), detectable replicating virus was relatively reduced (but not significant) compared to other vaccine groups. pigs vaccinated with adjuvanted NP-KAg showed significant reduction in microscopic lung pathology of NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs. the group 6 pig lungs were comparable to mock animals and the group 4 pig lungs were in between mock and the group 6 animals. the lung sections of virus-challenged pig groups 2, 3, and 5 vaccinated with a high dose of vaccine had severe pneumonic lesions with massive perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells. these data were consistent with the gross lung lesions, especially in pig groups 2 and 3; also, these pig groups had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during first week postchallenge. the absence of any clinical PRRS disease and gross lung lesions in group 6 pigs PRRSV infects both alveolar and interstitial macrophages. greater than 90% of BAL cells are macrophages. we investigated anti-PRRSV response in both lungs and LMNCs. PLGA-NP vaccine coadministered with a potent adjuvant elicits a protective immune response. the water-soluble components of M. tb WCL, such as heat shock protein-7057 and Pro-Glu/PPE, are potent adjuvants. a single dose of NP-KAg elicited partial cross-protective immune response in pigs. NP-KAg was coadministered twice with either entrapped or unentrapped M. tb WCL. the enhanced T- and B-cell responses in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs were attributed to concerted effects of both PLGA and M. tb WCL. in pigs immunized with adjuvanted NP-KAg, increased frequency of only CD4-CD8+IFN-+ cells in restimulated PBMCs was detected. in stimulated LMNCs, increased populations of both CD4+CD8IFN-+ and CD4CD8+IFN-+ cells were observed. this suggests other T-effector and NK cells were actively secreting IFN- in the lungs to PRRSV-challen VN antibodies against putative neutralizing epitopes on PRRSV GP5 and M glycoproteins play an important role in PRRSV clearance. in group 6 pigs, high levels of cross-reactive VN titers were detected against a challenged PRRSV MN184 strain. increased levels of another important Th1 cytokine, IL-12,70 was detected in the lungs of adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs. increased levels of another important Th1 cytokine, IL-12,70 was detected in the lungs of adjuvanted pigs. the absence of detectable replicating virus is consistent with a previous report. qPCR failed to differentiate infectious and noninfectious virus. inactivated PRRSV is relatively stable in the environment."}
