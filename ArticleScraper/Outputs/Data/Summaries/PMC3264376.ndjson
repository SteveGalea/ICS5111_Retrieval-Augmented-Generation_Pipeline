{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) infects most infants during the first year of life. however, RSV infection does not induce sustained, protective immunity. a specific protein receptor for RSV has yet to be reported. lectins commonly found on DCs include dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), mannose receptor (CD206), dectin-1 and -2 (C-type lectin domain family member 7A [CLEC7A] and CLEC6A, respectively) tetrameric type II transmembrane proteins containing calcium-dependent carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) that recognize mannose- and fucose- ligand binding induces cellular kinases and signaling cascades. signaling via DC/L-SIGN can also cooperate with signals transduced by other PRRs, such as TLRs, to facilitate infection or immunomodulation. RSV G glycoprotein was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using lentil lectin. eluting bound protein with 0.5 M NaCl\u20130.02 M Tris-HCl\u20130.5 M methyl-mannoside, pH 7.4. supernatant from uninfected HEp-2 cells was similarly processed. isolated pDCs were incubated in 10% RPMI and interleukin 3 (1 ng/ml; BioWhittaker) the isolated pDCs were cultured in 10% RPMI and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) the cells were rested at 37\u00b0C overnight. monoclonal antibodies specific for DC-SIGN (clone 120507), L-SIGN (clone 120604), or both DC- and L-SIGN (clone 120526) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) the cells were fixed and analyzed on the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) after staining, the cells were fixed and analyzed on the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) due to donor-to-donor variation in receptor expression levels, mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) for RSV-exposed samples were normalized to mock-infected samples for the same donor. 3T3 cells, 3T3-DC-SIGN transfectants, and 3T3\u2013L-SIGN transfectants were serum starved overnight, incubated with 10 g/ml anti-DC/L-SIGN. cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) rabbit monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) and then horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) the blot was stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific), probed with panspecific ERK1/2 (catalog number 9102), Akt (catalog number 9272), and -tubulin rabbit monoclonal antibodies (cat RSV G glycoprotein was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using lentil lectin. eluting bound protein with 0.5 M NaCl\u20130.02 M Tris-HCl\u20130.5 M methyl-mannoside. supernatant from uninfected HEp-2 cells was similarly processed. isolated pDCs were incubated in 10% RPMI and interleukin 3 (1 ng/ml; BioWhittaker) the isolated mDCs were cultured in 10% RPMI and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) the cells were rested at 37\u00b0C overnight. monoclonal antibodies specific for DC-SIGN (clone 120507), L-SIGN (clone 120604), or both DC- and L-SIGN (clone 120526) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) the cells were fixed and analyzed on the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) after staining, the cells were fixed and analyzed on the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) the normalized data from pooled donors were then compared. 3T3\u2013L-SIGN stable transfectants were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) the cells were infected with various MOIs of rgRSV and analyzed by flow cytometry 24 h p.i. the blot was stripped with ERK1/2 (catalog number 9102), Akt (catalog number 9272) and -tubulin rabbit monoclonal antibodies (catalog number 2125; Cell Signaling Technologies) and then horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse anti-rabbit IgG. the films were scanned, and densitometry was performed using ImageJ software. rgRSV or isolated mDCs or pDCs were treated with increasing concentrations of EDTA. rgRSV or isolated mDCs or pDCs were treated with increasing concentrations of EDTA. n was equal to 4 unique donors for all EDTA concentrations except 50 mM, where 11 unique donors were included. binding to either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN was abrogated in the presence of 50 mM EDTA. binding is dependent on divalent cations (presumably calcium, as magnesium was not added to the BIAcore binding buffer) the 3T3 parental cell line is semipermissive to RSV infection relative to HEp-2 cells. expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN did not increase rate of RSV infection as assessed by GFP expression. infection rates of 3T3 cells did not increase with longer incubation. isolated mDCs and pDCs were incubated with neutralizing antibodies to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (10 g/ml of each) the cells were then exposed to rgRSV. mDC-SIGN (CD209)- and L-SIGN (CD299)-specific antibodies do not interfere with RSV infection. IL-6 and IL-8 production at 24 h postinfection and IFN- levels at 3 h postinfection were increased in pDCs. marked but nonsignificant changes were seen in mDCs at 3 h postinfection. differences did not achieve statistical significance (P >. anti-DC/L-SIGN-treated samples tended to have increased expression of canonical DC maturation markers. this was particularly apparent in mDCs at 3 h postinfection and in infected mDCs at 24 h after infection. maturation in DC/L-SIGN-neutralized samples was 348% and 233% greater, respectively, than in isotype control-treated samples based on CD209 levels. phosphorylation of ERK1 was observed in 3T3\u2013DC-SIGN cells. phosphorylation of ERK1 was observed in 3T3\u2013L-SIGN cells. pERK1/2 levels were not appreciably increased in 3T3\u2013L-SIGN cells. ERK1 and ERK2 were reduced in cells treated with HIV-1 gp120 or RSV G. notably, DC/L-SIGN neutralization did not inhibit kinase phosphorylation in 3T3 parental cells. only partially reduced phosphorylation in DC- and L-SIGN transfectants. rgRSV or isolated mDCs or pDCs were treated with increasing concentrations of EDTA. n was equal to 4 unique donors for all EDTA concentrations except 50 mM, where 11 unique donors were included. no difference in the ability of EDTA to infect either DC subset was observed. purified RSV G bound to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN in presence of 10 mM CaCl2. binding to either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN was abrogated in presence of 50 mM EDTA. changes in relative intensity were monitored. transfectants of either cell line stably expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN did not become susceptible to RSV infection. this resistance to infection may reflect defects in steps of viral entry or replication other than binding of the virus particle. expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN did not increase the rate of RSV infection as assessed by GFP expression. mDCs and pDCs were incubated with neutralizing antibodies to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (10 g/ml of each) the cells were then exposed to rgRSV. infection was evaluated by GFP expression at 24 h postinfection. /L-SIGN treatment resulted in significant changes in cytokine and chemokine production in RSV-exposed pDCs. differences did not attain statistical significance, but IL-6 and IL-8 production at 24 h postinfection and IFN- levels at 3 h postinfection were increased in pDCs. neutralization of DC/L-SIGN resulted in modest changes in expression of DC maturation markers. anti-DC/L-SIGN-treated samples tended to have increased expression of canonical DC maturation markers. this was particularly apparent in mDCs at 3 h postinfection and in infected mDCs. ine production following DC/L-SIGN neutralization and RSV exposure, we examined the impact of RSV G on signaling events in 3T3 parent cells and 3T3\u2013DC-SIGN and 3T3\u2013L-SIGN transfectants. the results were compared to stimulation with HIV-1 gp120, which has been previously shown to induce ERK1 phosphorylation in 3T3\u2013DC-SIGN cells. levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were lower in 3T3\u2013L-SIGN cells than in 3T3\u2013DC-SIGN transfectants. levels of phosphorylation were reduced in cells treated with HIV-1 gp120 or RSV G. notably, DC/L-SIGN neutralization did not inhibit kinase phosphorylation in 3T3 parental cells. DISCUSSION RSV infection and interaction with dendritic cells results in activation and maturation events that play important roles in establishing virus-specific immunity. early events during the initial immune response may determine the quality and durability of host immunity. ERK1/2 signaling is involved in infection, replication, and host responses to a number of pathogens (19), particularly viruses (41, 48, 49, 61). PI3K and mTOR have well-defined roles in controlling activation of adaptive immune responses but have now also been shown to be critical in regulation of innate immunity (58). the importance of lipid rafts in viral entry and assembly has also been demonstrated for HIV-1 (6, 40), Ebola (15), dengue virus (50), and hepatitis C virus (1). inhibition of RSV binding to DC-SIGN in mDCs and pDCs resulted in increased DC maturation."}
