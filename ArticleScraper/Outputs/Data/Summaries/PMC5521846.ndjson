{"summary": "malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the most deadly form and it predominates in tropical countries. complications range from mild respiratory symptoms to pulmonary edema (PE) with or without ARDS. in the lungs of CM patients, 51% of the blood vessels exhibited PRBC sequestration in septal capillaries and small blood vessels. a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been claimed to be involved in the pathogenesis of severe falciparum malaria. a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been claimed to be involved in the pathogenesis of severe falciparum malaria (SM) hemozoin or cytokines- induced apoptosis and leads to ARDS in association with PE. the study focused on the clinical presentation and pulmonary histopathological changes related to ARDS. the WHO criteria for severe malaria were adopted. the presence of hyaline membrane formation from the lungs was used as a histopathological criterion to separate all patients who presented with or without ARDS. clear cells characterized by golden-brown birefringence pigment were scored according to four grades: 0 = absent; +1 = focal (less than 25% of the section); +2 = present (between 25% and 50% of the section); +3 = severe (more than 50% of the section). ARDS was confirmed by the presence of hyaline membrane formation and widespread inflammation. the sections were visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB), counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with DPX (Merck, Germany). the H-score was calculated by the multiplication of the percentage area of expression (0%\u2013100%) and the intensity score (4 grades: 0 = no staining; 1 = mild staining; 2 = moderate staining and 3 = strong staining). s-hemozoin (39404-00-7, InvivoGen, USA) was used to determine the protective or deleterious effect on pneumocytes due to these cytokines in relation to severe malaria. s-hemozoin was synthesized by acidic method and described as a devoid of protein and DNA contamination. all cells on the coverslip and membrane were primarily fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 M sucrose phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. the cells seeding onto the plate without a coverslip and membrane were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. cells on the cover slip were stained with 0.1% trypan blue for morphological determination under a light microscope. cells on the membrane were secondarily fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M SPB for 1 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol for 10 min each. the embedded lungs were polymerized in a 65\u00b0C incubator for 48 h. the ultra-thin sections were placed on a 200 square mesh copper grid. g/mL of EB/AO with a cell to fluorescent dye ratio of 2:1 (v/v) all of the staining procedures were performed on an ice-cold container. at least 100 cells/time point was counted using a fluorescent microscope no longer than 20 min after staining. the significance level was determined at a threshold of p 0.05. the total of 29 lung specimens were obtained from patients who died from severe falciparum malaria at the hospital for tropical diseases, Thailand from 1969 to 2004. the patients who had septicemia, diffuse pulmonary infection, gastric aspiration, near-drowning or head injuries were also excluded from the study. the fixed specimens were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin. the fixed specimens were dehydrated, infiltrated, embedded and sectioned into 4\u20135 m thickness. anti-thrombomodulin (TM) (SantaCruz, USA, sc-9162), anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (SantaCruz, USA, sc-7891) and tumor necrotic factor (TNF)- (Immunotool, Germany, 21453011) antibodies were used for immunohistochemical staining. adapted images were converted to greyscale and then the area of expression was located by adjusting the threshold. for intravascular fibrin, the fibrin-positive area as characterized by yellowish material inside the vessel was measured. the expression of EPCR, TM, ICAM-1 and TNF- were measured by the septal area. pneumocytes were seeded into 12-well plates without a cover slip or membrane. pneumocytes were then exposed to 500 ng/mL of rh IL-13, -27, -31, -13 plus -31 and -13 plus -27 plus -31 for a 1 h incubation. pneumocytes were also seeded into 12-well plates without a cover slip or membrane. the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated and compared in each group. previously fixed pneumocytic cells were fixed once again with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M SPB for 1 h and washed three times. the cells were then dehydrated with graded ethanol and air dried overnight. ten grid squares were calculated to the percentage of PRBCs/grid square. the previously fixed pneumocytic cells were fixed once again with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M SPB for 1 h and washed three times. the cells were then dehydrated with graded ethanol and air dried overnight. all intravascular RBCs were distinguished to either normal or infected (PRBCs) then counted and calculated to the percentage of PRBCs/grid square. ten grid squares were evaluated for each case. the ages of the patients with severe malaria (SM) range between 3\u201354 years of age. there was no difference in the ages between the ARDS and non-ARDS groups. the non-ARDS patients had a significantly higher occurrence of acute renal failure than the ARDS group. however, the ARDS patients presented with a similar occurrence of anaemia, jaundice, acidosis, shock, hypoglycaemia and cerebral malaria compared to the non-ARDS patients. hypoglycaemia (%) 10.0 (2/20) 55.6 (5/9) 0.001 Hypoglycaemia (%) 10.0 (2/20) 11.1 (1/9) 0.688 Cerebral malaria (%) 70.0 (14/20) 55.6 (5/9) 0.364 Quantitative lung ultrastructure % PRBCs sequestration 55.5 40.34 75.0 36.09 0.206 Malarial pigment/grid square. scores for malarial pigment, alveolar haemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation were significant compared to those in patients without ARDS. the severity of PE was examined, approximately seventy percent (71.42%; 5/7) of ARDS patients with PE showed the presence of oedematous fluid in the alveolar sac between 25\u201350% of the section. ARDS severity was correlated significantly with the presence of malarial pigment and internal alveolar haemorrhaging. ARDS severity was correlated significantly with the presence of malarial pigment and internal alveolar haemorrhaging. the H-score expression is demonstrated by bar graphs for PE (E) or ARDS (F) lungs, to compare those expressions Friedman test was performed (**; p-value 0.001, ***; p-value 0.0001). ARDS lungs had a lower expression of TM compared to normal and non-ARDS lungs. the H-score expression is demonstrated by bar graphs for PE (E) or ARDS (F) lungs, to compare those expression Friedman test was performed (***; p-value 0.0001). Fig 5. Immunohistochemical staining for TNF- in normal (A), non-PE (B), PE (C) and ARDS (D) lungs. a549 cell is a pneumocytic cell that exhibits three typical morphologies. all molecules applied to the lung epithelial cells resulted in a significantly increased number of apoptotic cells compared to the untreated group. the number of apoptotic cells declined when compared to all examined cytokines. s-hemozoin itself induced early apoptosis predominantly in lung epithelial cells. early apoptotic cells were shown in green fluorescence with nuclear fragmentation or condensed chromatin (Fig 9B), cellular blebbing (Fig 9C) and cytoplasmic vacuolization (Fig 9D) s-hemozoin-induced pneumocytic apoptosis was characterized by morphological changes and staining patterns that included normal cells (A), early apoptotic cells with nuclear fragmentation or condense chromatin (B), membrane blebbing (C), cytoplasmic vacuolization (D), late apoptotic cells with condensed chromatin (E) and necrotic cells (F) 31.03% (9/29) of the SM patients presented with signs of ARDS. the occurrence of PE and systemic bleeding was significantly higher than those in non-ARDS patients. the non-ARDS patients had a significantly higher occurrence of acute renal failure than the ARDS group. 5.6 (5/9) 0.266 Jaundice (%) 75.0 (15/20) 77.8 (7/9) 0.631 Pneumonia (%) 25.0 (5/20) 77.8 (7/9) 0.012 Acute renal failure (%) 45.0 (9/20) 0.0 (0/9) 0.017 Acidosis (%) 35.0 (7/20) 33.3 (3/9) 0.636 Shock (%) 15.0 (3/20) 22.2 (2/9) 0.502 Systemic bleeding (%) 0.0 (0/20 ciparum malaria, the lung histology was altered, including alveolar septal thickening and congestion accompanied by the deposition of cellular and blood components. alveolar epithelium damage associated with hyaline membrane formation was also related to the widespread inflammation. ARDS severity was correlated significantly with the presence of malarial pigment and internal alveolar haemorrhaging. ARDS lungs showed a significantly lower expression of EPCR than those from non-PE and normal subjects. negative correlation between the level of EPCR and some histopathological changes was observed using Spearman test (G-I) the ARDS lungs had a lower expression of TM compared to normal and non-ARDS lungs. the H-score expression is demonstrated by bar graphs for PE (E) or ARDS (F) lungs, to compare those expression Friedman test was performed (***; p-value 0.0001) the amount of intravascular fibrin was very high in SM patients when compared to normal lungs. expression Friedman test was performed to determine expression of EPCR, TM, ICAM-1 and TNF- in ARDS and non-ARDS lungs. EPCR and TM were expressed on endothelial cells and on the tunica medial layer, alveolar septum and pneumocytic cells. expression score was considered for immune-positive stained areas in alveolar septa. the ARDS lungs had a lower expression of TM compared to normal and non-ARDS lungs. unlike TM expression, ICAM-1 was strongly labelled on the ARDS and PE lungs compared to the non-ARDS and non-PE lungs. the amount of intravascular fibrin was very high in SM patients compared to normal lungs. there was no significant difference in the level of fibrin deposition between PE and non-PE or ARDS and non-ARDS lungs. a dose of 500 ng/ml showed that all molecules applied to the lung epithelial cells resulted in a significantly increased number of apoptotic cells. the number of apoptotic cells decreased when compared to all examined cytokines alone. early apoptotic cells were shown in green fluorescence with nuclear fragmentation or condensed chromatin. necrotic cells were stained fluorescent red with an intact nucleus. a higher level of CARD-9 was observed in the cells treated with hemozoin for 1, 6 and 12 h compared to the negative control. staining patterns included normal cells (A), early apoptotic cells with nuclear fragmentation or condense chromatin (B), membrane blebbing (C), cytoplasmic vacuolization (D), late apoptotic cells with condensed chromatin (E) and necrotic cells (F) malaria-associated ARDS was significantly associated with PE and systemic bleeding. the alteration of the EPCR and TM in association with the deposition of s-hemozoin in the lung may play a role in the pathogenesis of ARDS in SM. the early and preventive use of activated protein C as an adjunctive treatment for falciparum malaria and leptospirosis co-infection leads to improved clinical symptoms, particularly of lung injury. ARDS patients experienced a loss of EPCR and thrombomodulin expression in both PE and non-PE lungs. the increase of ICAM-1 and TNF- expression was often found together with the decrease of TM in the lung. chemokine and cytokine production may be useful for diagnosis and prognosis. IL-27 can activate apoptosis via several pathways as presented in some reports. it has been well established that the decrease in pulmonary surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes plays a crucial role in malaria-associated ARDS pathogenesis. s-hemozoin caused pneumocytic cell injury and apoptosis as exhibited by EB/AO staining and CARD-9 expression. within 24 h post-exposure, s-hemozoin induced early apoptosis in pneumocytes as characterized by their staining patterns and morphological changes. there have been no reports of apoptotic-associated ARDS in severe falciparum malaria patients. the present study used an in vitro culture system to demonstrate lung epithelial cell damage and apoptosis in response to s-hemozoin. this signalling modulates apoptosis in brain endothelial cell, leukocyte and hepatocyte in severe falciparum malaria patients. hemozoin in SM cases is the ruptured and mature PRBCs. pneumocyte type 2 cells may interact with hemozoin. s-hemozoin with acidic synthesis tends to be contaminated with DNA. a different type of hemozoin especially in size leads to their dissimilarity properties. in severe malaria-associate ARDS, anti-coagulation properties are impaired. the type II pulmonary epithelium is destroyed through the apoptotic pathway. the pulmonary resolution is blocked and the blood gas barrier is further disrupted."}
