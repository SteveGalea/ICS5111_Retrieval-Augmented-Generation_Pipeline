{"summary": "immortal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting STING (shSTING) this approach resulted in the complete depletion of the STING protein from cells transduced with shSTING. this approach resulted in the complete depletion of the STING protein from cells transduced with shSTING. VSV-LUC and SINV-LUC infections were monitored by luciferase activity assay at 20 h postinfection. data are represented as mean SEM. replication of VSV and Sindbis virus (SINV) was quantified by measuring expression of luciferase reporter genes embedded in the viral genomes. Sendai virus (SeV) and influenza A virus PR8 (IAV) were also used as well as the type 3 Dearing strain of reovirus (T3D) in all infections and time points examined, STING-deficient cells were capable of inducing Ifnb1 expression. in the absence of STING, virus-induced Ifnb1 expression was greater than what was observed in infected shCTRL cells. to test this hypothesis, we performed infections in MEFs that were depleted of STING or MAVS with siRNA. cGAS\u2013STING pathway is not activated canonically during RNA virus infection. cGAS\u2013STING pathway is not activated canonically during RNA virus infection. virally infected or transfected cytoplasmic lysates were incubated with WT MEFs in the presence of reversible permeabilization buffer. Ifnb1 transcript was quantified by qRT-PCR. data are displayed as fold induction of the indicated gene compared with uninfected. in uninfected cells, low levels of IFN are constitutively expressed and secreted (28) shSTING cells display lower levels of basal Ifnb1 transcripts than shCTRL counterparts. this treatment inhibits signaling from all IFN receptors. the abundance of ISG products in a cell before infection does not strongly influence the rate of VSV replication. if the sole antiviral activities of STING are via transcription, then blocking host cell gene expression should render WT cells more permissive to viral replication. LC3 is incorporated into autophagosomes and is retained on these organelles. once in lysosomes, LC3 is degraded (30) we monitored the release of the GFP epitope tag present on the LC3 transgene. shCTRL and shSTING cells were treated with low-dose ethidium bromide for 2 wk. this procedure generates 0 cells, which are depleted of mitochondrial DNA. cGAS\u2013STING pathway regulates cellular senescence. the rate of VSV replication was achieved by infecting cells with VSV-LUC. we modeled the viral curves as exponential growth equations. this analysis indicated that the growth rate was similar in the presence and absence of STING. titer of VSV-GFP on shCTRL cells was calculated to be 9.4 105 pfu/mL. the titer of the same inoculum on shSTING cells was 1.1 108 pfu/mL. the relative probability of plaque formation was therefore 100-fold higher in shSTING cells than in shCTRL counterparts. bicistronic mRNAs express firefly luciferase via cap-dependent translation. renilla luciferase expressed downstream of either a poliovirus IRES (PV mRNA) or the intergenic cricket paralysis virus IRES (CrPV mRNA) we transfected shCTRL and shSTING cells and used qPCR. RNAs were transfected into the MEFs indicated by dual luciferase assay 8 h after transfection. data are represented as mean SEM. in vitro transcribed mRNAs had a translation advantage in the absence of STING. we used the observation that the CrPV IRES was translated similarly in the presence and absence of STING. this strain allowed us to estimate the number of proteins produced per viral transcript by calculating the ratio between STING-sensitive translation (firefly luciferase signal) and STING-insensitive translation (renilla luciferase signal) translation of viral mRNAs is more efficient in the absence of STING. translation is enhanced in virally infected and poly(I:C)-transfected cells lacking STING. inset is virus titer calculated by pfu assays of supernatant virus at time of RNA isolation. the MEFs indicated were infected or mock-infected with VSV-GFP for 10 h at MOI 5. the larger proportion of viral mRNAs found in the polysomes suggests that there is more protein synthesis occurring in VSV-infected shSTING cells. we infected (or mock-infected) shCTRL and shSTING cells with VSV-GFP. poly(I:C) transfection led to a greater amount of 80S monosome accumulation in shCTRL cells than cells lacking STING. phosphorylated eIF2 (phospho-eIF2) binds and inhibits the GEF activity of another initiation factor, eIF2B. phospho-eIF2 is phosphorylated in shCTRL and shSTING cells after poly(I:C) transfection. if eIF2 is phosphorylated, it binds and inhibits eIF2B. if eIF2 is restored, translation proceeds in the presence of phospho-eIF2. the puromycin signal was quantified and normalized to actin. after infection with ISRIB, viral gene expression did not increase in the shCTRL cells. this finding suggests that the STING-dependent translation restriction is not mediated through eIF2B. translation inhibition was not significantly different between shCTRL and shSTING cells transfected with DNA. translation was inhibited in WT or MAVS KO MEFs after transfection. endogenous actin, RIG-I, and STING were detected by western analysis. infections were monitored by dual luciferase assay at the indicated time postinfection (hours PI) in MEFs lacking RIG-I and MDA5, translation was maintained at 96% of mock. in contrast, RIG-I/MDA5 KO cells displayed no defects in thapsigargin-induced translation inhibition or eIF2 phosphorylation. translation regulation in response to exogenous RNA was therefore dependent on RLRs. RNA virus replication independently of RIG-I, MDA5 and STING. we depleted KO cells of STING (RIG-I/MDA5/shSTING) or transduced them with the nontargeted control (RIG-I/MDA5/shCTRL) we confirmed STING depletion by western analysis. shSTING cells did not induce Ifn1 transcripts in response to transfected DNA. poly(I:C)-induced expression of Ifn1 was unaffected by absence of STING. these results are consistent with the specific and essential function of STING in DNA-induced IFN responses. the MEFs indicated were infected with the indicated virus at MOI 1.0. Ifnb1 transcript was quantified by qRT-PCR at the indicated times. data are represented as mean SEM. VSV-M51R replication was determined by monitoring the production of infectious virus by plaque forming unit (pfu) assays. Specifically, VSV, VSV-M51R, and SINV displayed multilog increases in replication in shSTING cells, compared with shCTRL cells. to test this hypothesis, we performed infections in MEFs that were depleted of STING or MAVS with siRNA, and Ifnb1 expression was monitored. however, cells lacking STING were not defective for virus-induced Ifnb1 expression. this protein is required to restrict replication of diverse RNA viruses. cGAS\u2013STING pathway is not activated canonically during RNA virus infection. virally infected or transfected cytoplasmic lysates were incubated with WT MEFs in presence of reversible permeabilization buffer. fected with herring testes DNA (5 g/mL), poly(I:C) (2 g/mL), mock-infected, or infected with VSV (MOI 1). MEFs transfected with DNA were fixed 1 h after transfection. s influences RNA virus replication, we experimentally altered levels of ISGs using the pan-Janus Kinase inhibitor pyridone 6 (P6). this treatment inhibits signaling from all IFN receptors and thus prevents activities of constitutive IFNs. twenty-four hours of P6 treatment lowered basal Rsad2 transcripts in shCTRL cells to levels comparable to what was observed in shSTING cells. treatment with actinomycin D significantly reduced the abundance of Tbp transcripts, confirming host cell transcription was inhibited. shCTRL cells were not more permissive for VSV replication in the presence of actinomycin D but rather slightly less permissive. autophagy induction does not correlate with STING-dependent antiviral activities. in case of VSV infection, we observed no defect in LC3 processing. RNA virus restriction may occur due to sensing of mitochondrial DNA. the cGAS\u2013STING pathway regulates cellular senescence (35, 36) the cGAS\u2013STING pathway also regulates cellular senescence (35, 36). we observed equal incorporation of BrdU in shCTRL and shSTING MEFs. the MEFs indicated were transfected in the presence of lipofectamine 2000 or mock-transfected with purified VSV-LUC cores. infection was monitored by luciferase assay at the indicated time points. plaque formation was 100-fold higher in shSTING cells than in shCTRL cells. in the absence of STING, the probability that a cell will become infected is increased. this strategy has been used to understand post-entry aspects of VSV replication. cells over 24 h tested the amount of protein produced by cap-, PV IRES-, and CrPV IRES-dependent mechanisms. a 10-fold higher luciferase signal was detected from cap-dependent translation in shSTING cells, compared with shCTRL cells. firefly and renilla luciferase units from the indicated cell line and time postinfection from D at the indicated time. data are represented as mean SEM. viral strain measured the ratio between STING-sensitive translation (firefly luciferase signal) and STING-insensitive translation (renilla luciferase signal) we infected shCTRL and shSTING cells and monitored renilla expression over time. fected shCTRL cells compared with uninfected shCTRL cells. 80S accumulation after viral infection was not as robust in shSTING cells. translation is enhanced in virally infected and poly(I:C)-transfected cells lacking STING. data are shown as percent MFI of mock-transfected cells. data are represented as mean SEM. cells were depleted of methionine and labeled with the methionine homolog, l-azidohomoalanine (AHA) cells were then fixed and fixed and click chemistry was used to attach a fluorophore to AHA. Flow cytometry was then used to quantify translational activity. poly(I:C) transfection led to a greater amount of 80S monosome accumulation in shCTRL cells than cells lacking STING. to corroborate these findings, we labeled shCTRL and shSTING cells with AHA after poly(I:C) transfection and monitored the extent of protein synthesis directly. eIF2 is phosphorylated, it binds and inhibits eIF2B (44), but translation proceeds in the presence of phospho-eIF2 (42). a drug that maintains GEF activity when eIF2 is phosphorylated should therefore phenocopy STING deficiency during virus infection of shCTRL cells. in all our experiments, STING restriction occurs in the presence of an RNA ligand that stimulates the RLR\u2013MAVS pathway. to test this hypothesis, we first determined if STING regulates translation in response to a stimulus that does not involve exogenous RNAs. ed in WT and MAVS KO MEFs (Fig. 6A) these data indicate that STING-dependent translation restriction does not depend on MAVS. Fig. 6 form a genetic pathway to control RNA virus translation and replication. RNA was isolated and Rsad2 transcript was analysed by qRT-PCR. the MEFs indicated were infected with VSV-LUC at MOI 0.1. infections were monitored by luciferase assay at the indicated time. influenced translation of viral mRNAs, we infected WT and RIG-I/MDA5 KOs. we quantified the firefly and renilla signal over time. if STING controls RNA virus replication independently of RIG-I, MDA5 and STING, we would expect to see an enhancement of RNA virus replication. we infected both cell lines with VSV-LUC and monitored the infection by luciferase activity assay and viral titer over time. this result supports a model whereby RLRs have distinct effector responses during RNA virus infection. one response is mediated by MAVS to induce IFN, and a distinct response is mediated by STING to diminish translation. we found that VSV replication was largely insensitive to experimental alterations in basal ISG abundance, removal of mitochondrial DNA, or prevention of autophagy. diversse host strategies prevent viral mRNA from gaining access to the translational machinery that is critical for pathogen propagation. translation of mRNAs that do not utilize the translocon was suppressed by STING, suggesting that the mechanism of translation inhibition is not related to the translocon. some other strategy must therefore exist within cells that is mediated by STING to influence translation inhibition. results support a model where RLRs detect a common upstream ligand (viral RNA) and then engage distinct sets of downstream factors to induce IFN expression. translation inhibition is important to protect during the earliest stages of an infection, in a cell-intrinsic manner. VSV-LUC ribonucleoproteins were isolated and transfected into cells as described (56). generation of 0 MEFs were generated as described (34). DNA was analyzed on a CFX384 real-time cycler (Bio-Rad) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix. s were collected after trypsinization, resuspended in 500 L of PEB (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 g/mL cycloheximide, 200 g/mL heparin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using iScript c influenza virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34, H1N1) was propagated in vero cells as described (52). VSV (Indiana), VSV-LUC, VSV-FIRESR, and VSV-GFP was propagated and purified as described (51). cell labeling with 50 M AHA was performed via the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Life Technologies) cells labeled with 100 M of APC-phosphine were labeled and analyzed by western analysis. rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor. RNA was precipitated overnight, pelleted by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C at 12,000 g. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit."}
