{"summary": "three prospective cohorts were enrolled in the late summer/early fall of each year. prospective subjects were asked to notify study staff of acute respiratory symptoms. patients with acute coronary syndromes, documented pulmonary embolism, or aspiration pneumonia excluded. RNA was extracted into 12 L of water from 250 L of stored respiratory specimens. amplification was performed on a Bio-Rad iCycler for 42 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 seconds, 42\u00b0C for 40 seconds and 68\u00b0C for 10 seconds. serologic testing for CoV 229E and OC43 was performed by enzyme immunoassay using serum samples spanning each winter season (fall through spring) separately. the supernatant fluid was pelleted in a Beckman SW27 rotor at 20 000 rpm for 90 minutes, resuspended in TNE buffer and sonicated. the virus band was diluted to 3.5 mL in TNE buffer and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the usual convention of a 4-fold rise in serum IgG specific for the CoV antigens was considered evidence of infection. infection with other viruses were also identified by culture, RT-PCR, or serology (influenza A and B, RSV, hMPV) or culture alone. prospective cohorts were replaced each year using a rolling enrollment strategy. prospective subjects were asked to notify study staff of acute respiratory symptoms. a follow-up assessment was performed and convalescent serum samples were collected. amplification mixture contained 5 L of complementary DNA, 5 mM MgCl2, 400 M dNTP (dUTP replacing dTTP), 5 U of Taq polymerase, and 1 U of uracil-DNA glycosylase. amplification was performed on a Bio-Rad iCycler for 42 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 seconds, 42\u00b0C for 40 seconds and 68\u00b0C for 10 seconds. the virus band was diluted to 3.5 mL in TNE buffer and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the pellet was resuspended into phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% NP40, placed on ice, sonicated 4 times for 15 seconds, and then clarified. incompletely evaluated CoV illnesses were those for which participants failed to report symptoms during the winter surveillance, or were out of town at the time of the illness. asymptomatic infection was defined as a 4-fold increase in CoV-specific serum IgG bracketing a period when no respiratory symptoms were reported. age, mean SD 75 6 70 11 33 5 75 12 Male, % 42.4 54.4 16.2 44.7 Race, % White 97.7 93.7 82.1 84.9 Black 2.1 5.4 11.0 9.6 Hispanic 0.2 0.9 5.2 5.5 Live with children, % 2.2 6.0 88 7.4 Exposed to childrena, % 58 65 100 52 Chronic illnesses, % Lung disease 2.1 64.6 10.0 58.6 Cardiac disease 16.5 47. asymptomatic 229E infections 1 2 1 0 No. of OC43 infections (% of cohort) 37 (13.2%) 36 (13.3%) 27 (15.0%) 11 (3.7%) No. of asymptomatic 229E infections 9 10 14 0 No. of OC43 infections (% of cohort) 28 (10.0%) 31 (11.4%) 20 (11.1%) 24 (8.1%) asymptomatic 229E infections (% of cohort) 15 (5.1%) 13 (6.2%) 6 (6.7%) 15 (3.9%) No. asymptomatic 229E infections 9 5 1 0 No. of OC43 infections (% of cohort) 17 (5.8%) 6 (2.9%) 4 (4.4%) 14 (3.6%) No. of OC43 infections 1 2 3 0 All years combined No. of 229E infections 54 57 36 34 % asymptomatic 35.1% 33.3% 44 subjects complaining of sore throat and 25%\u201344% complaining of hoarseness. Cough was more common in OC43 infections when all 3 cohorts were considered together. lower respiratory signs were similar for both strains. b P =.065 comparing OC43 to 229E when all groups are combined. OC43-infected subjects used significantly more cough suppressants and bronchodilators. 96 coronavirus infections were identified in the 1388 subjects in the hospital cohort. the highest incidence of coronavirus infections occurred in year 2 (11.8%) and ranged from 3.3% to 7.5% in other years. a significantly greater percentage of dual virus infection was noted in 229E-infected subjects than in OC43-infected subjects (16/34 [47%] vs 7/62 [11%]; P =.0002) for the 229E-infected persons, the coinfecting viruses were RSV (7), hMPV (9), hMPV (1), parainfluenza virus (1), and influenza A and B (1 each. pneumonia (32% and 35%, respectively) a significant greater proportion of OC43-infected subjects were RT-PCR positive (109/158 [69%] than 229E-infected subjects (52/108 [48%], P =.001) for both strains, approximately 30% were positive by both RT-PCR and serology. coronavirus (CoV) 229E and OC43 to influenza A (Flu A), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in healthy elderly and high-risk cohorts. in the 4 winters, 398 coronavirus infections in 394 subjects were identified. in all years, OC43 was more common than 229E early in the surveillance period. in years 2 and 4, 229E peaked later. 113 CoV infections occurred in the healthy elderly cohort (54 229E, 59 OC43), 112 in the high-risk group (57 229E, 55 OC43), and 77 in the young cohort (36 229E, 41 OC43) overall, infection rates were greatest during the winter of year 2 (2000\u20132001) in cohort 180 195 164 434 No. of illnesses 102 115 101 165 No. of 229E infections (% of cohort) 1 (0.6%) 6 (3.1%) 1 (0.6%) 5 (1.2%) No. of OC43 infections (% of cohort) 9 (5.0%) 7 (3.6%) 7 (4.3%) 18 (4.1%) No. asymptomatic 229E infections 9 5 1 0 No. of OC43 infections (% of cohort) 17 (5.8%) 6 (2.9%) 4 coinfecting viruses were RSV (3), hMPV (2), influenza A and B (1 each) and 229E (1). upper respiratory symptoms were relatively common in all 3 cohorts. nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were nearly universal regardless of infecting strain. OC43-infected subjects used significantly more cough suppressants and bronchodilators. in aggregate, OC43-infected subjects used significantly more cough suppressants and bronchodilators. in addition, there was a trend toward more health service use.

OC43 infection was significantly less likely to be asymptomatic or associated with mixed viral infection. the true frequency of coinfections is likely to be considerably greater. coronavirus or influenza strains in outpatient and hospitalized adults have a high incidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. the clinical impact is greatest for influenza A followed by hMPV, OC43, and 229E in order of decreasing importance. coronavirus 229E and OC43 infections were most active in the winter. the overall incidence and impact of combined coronavirus 229E and OC43 infections in diverse adult populations is relatively high."}
