{"summary": "ANG receptor nonselective saralasin, propidium iodide, and clasto-lactacystin -lactone were obtained from Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO. angiotensin1\u20137, A779 (d-Ala7-Ang1\u20137), and MG132 (carboxybenzoxy-Leu-leu-leucinal) were obtained from GenScript USA, Piscataway, NJ. the primary cells were studied at day 2 of culture, a time at which they are type II cell-like by accepted morphological and biochemical criteria (22) all cells were grown in 24- or 6-well chambers and were analyzed at subconfluent densities of 50\u201380% except where indicated. cells were exposed to inhibitors or antagonists 30 min before exposure to MG132 or SP-C plasmids for 5 min to 30 h as indicated. the wild-type and mutant SP-C sequences were verified by sequencing at the Genomics Core at the Research Technology Support Facility at Michigan State University. cells were seeded into 24-well plates to a density of 75% confluence in F12 medium + 10% serum. after 24 h, the cells were serum starved for 24 h before transfection. cells with discrete nuclear fragments containing condensed chromatin were scored as apoptotic. as in earlier publications, equating fragmented nuclei with apoptosis was verified by in situ end labeling of fragmented DNA. equating fragmented nuclei with apoptosis was verified by in situ end labeling of fragmented DNA. lysates or concentrated cell culture medium were incubated in opaque 96-well culture plates. the volume of medium assayed was normalized to equivalent amounts of cells used for conditioning the media. initial reactions were linear with both time and protein concentration. angiotensin1\u20137, A779 (d-Ala7-Ang1\u20137), and MG132 (carboxybenzoxy-Leu-leucinal) were obtained from GenScript USA, Piscataway, NJ. the cathepsin D

morphological and biochemical criteria (22). all cells were grown in 24- or 6-well chambers and were analyzed at subconfluent densities of 50\u201380% except where indicated. all subsequent incubations with ANG1\u20137 and/or other test agents were performed in serum-free medium unless otherwise indicated. cells were seeded into 24-well plates to a density of 75% confluence in F12 medium + 10% serum. after 24 h, the cells were serum starved for 24 h before transfection. cells were transfected at a ratio of 0.50 g plasmid DNA to 1.875 l Lipofectamine 2000. equating fragmented nuclei with apoptosis was verified by in situ end labeling of fragmented DNA. cells were scored over a minimum of four separate microscopic fields. the active forms of caspase-7 and caspase-8 and cytosolic cytochrome c were detected by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the active (cleaved) forms. the total volume of reaction buffer, including sample, was 100 l. in concentrated cell culture media, the volume of medium assayed was normalized to equivalent amounts of cells used for conditioning the media. initial reactions were linear with both time and protein concentration. angiotensin1\u20137, A779 (d-Ala7-Ang1\u20137), and MG132 (carboxybenzoxy-Leu-leucinal) were obtained from GenScript USA, Piscataway, NJ. the cathepsin D fluorogenic substrate MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Leu-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys(Dnp)-d-Arg-NH all cells were grown in 24- or 6-well chambers and were analyzed at subconfluent densities of 50\u201380% except where indicated. all subsequent incubations with ANG1\u20137 and/or other test agents were performed in serum-free medium unless otherwise indicated. cells were exposed to inhibitors or antagonists 30 min before exposure

cells were transfected at a ratio of 0.50 g plasmid DNA to 1.875 l Lipofectamine 2000. the active forms of caspase-7 and caspase-8 and cytosolic cytochrome c were detected by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the active (cleaved) forms. cells were lysed either in an Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (for ACE-2, cathepsin D, cytochrome c, or caspase quantitations) or, for detection of phospho-proteins, with lysate protein was normalized to equivalent amounts of cells used for conditioning the media. initial reaction rates were linear with both time and protein concentration. the mitochondrial membrane potential (, MMP) in A549 cells was estimated. the transcription factor CHOP was upregulated by MG132 but not by the G100S mutant of SP-C. the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 was incubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 M) for 20 h (A) or was transfected with plasmids containing sequences for wild-type human SP-C (W.T.) or the surfactant protein C (SP-C) BRICHOS domain mutant of SP- cathepsin D is required for apoptosis in response to bleomycin. complete inhibition of cathepsin D enzymatic activity by pepstatin A supports the specificity of the enzyme assay for aspartyl protease induction by MG132. ACE-2 was also downregulated by the alternate proteasome inhibitor CLBL if applied to A549 cells cultured at a higher cell density. enzyme assay using specific cathepsin D fluorogenic substrate MOCAc-GKPILFFRLK-(Dnp)-d-l-NH2 (12) showed significant induction of cathepsin D activity by MG132 that was completely eliminated by inclusion of pepstatin A in the assay chamber. saralasin and ANG1\u20137 significantly inhibited caspase 7 activation by MG132. inhibition of caspase 8 by saralasin was less potent. saralasin and ANG1\u20137 completely inhibited caspase 8 activation. saralasin or ANG1\u20137 strongly inhibited MG132-induced cytochrome c release into the cytosolic fraction of A549 cells. MG132 caused a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, Fig. 5B) of A549 cells. the effect of ANG1\u20137 or saralasin on JNK phosphorylation was examined in AECs challenged with MG132. saralasin substantially inhibited and ANG1\u20137 completely inhibited MG132-induced nuclear fragmentation in either A549 cells (Fig. 7A) or in primary cultures of human alveolar epithelial cells. inclusion of MG132 blocked the ability of ANG1\u20137 to abrogate MG132-induced nuclear fragmentation in the primary cultures of human AECs. MG132-induced nuclear fragmentation in alveolar epithelial cells by angiotensin 1\u20137 or by angiotensin nonselective receptor blockade. saralasin or synthetic ANG1\u20137 completely eliminated the G100S-induced increase in nuclear fragmentation of A549 cells. inhibition by ANG1\u20137 was reversed by the peptide antagonist A779 (d-Ala7-Ang1\u20137). the ACE-2 ectodomain shedding enzyme ADAM17/TACE (TNF-converting enzyme, 4) might play a role in the loss of ACE-2. the ACE-2 ectodomain shedding enzyme ADAM17/TACE (TNF-converting enzyme, 4) reversed the CLBL-induced loss of the low MW form of ACE-2 and increased the high MW isoform. the cells were treated with the ADAM17/TACE-specific inhibitor TAPI-2 (0.8 M, 4) or vehicle (CTL) and were thereafter harvested for Western blotting. TAPI-2-induced increase in high MW form of ACE-2 (arrowhead, 115 kDa) ER stress-induced apoptosis of AECs in response to either proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S can be prevented by either ANG receptor blockade (saralasin) or exogenous ANG1\u20137. the inhibitory action of ANG1\u20137 is mediated by its receptor mas, which reduces JNK phosphorylation. apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells is the only cell type in which the SP-C mutations are expressed, secondary to the ER stress and the UPR to misfolded mutant SP-C (9) the concept that induction of apoptosis specifically in alveolar epithelial cells is sufficient to induce a fibrogenic response in the lungs is supported by a vast body of evidence. ACE-2/ANG1\u20137/mas axis regulates ANGII receptor-dependent apoptosis. ACE-2/ANG1\u20137/mas axis also regulates ANGII apoptosis in response to ER stress induced by either exogenous proteasome inhibition. recombinant ACE-2 or its product ANG1\u20137 may hold therapeutic potential in humans. the exact mechanisms by which ER stress activates the ANG system to induce AEC apoptosis are not entirely clear but likely involve both axes of the autocrine ANG system. the increase in cathepsin D induced by MG132 was shown to be sufficient to result in ANGII generation. a recent report by our group found that ACE-2 expression by AECs is highly dependent on cell cycle status. loss of ACE-2 expression occurs with induction of cell proliferation. this mechanism cannot explain the results reported here because two different proteasome inhibitors downregulated ACE-2 in the absence of these agents. ctodomain shedding is another mechanism by which ACE-2 is reduced in fibrotic human lung (11) er stress from a variety of stimuli was already shown to induce ADAM17/TACE and ectodomain shedding of ACE-2 (18), albeit in nonpulmonary cell types. findings suggest that the general mechanism of ADAM17-induced ACE-2 ectodomain shedding might occur in lung fibrogenesis in response to various stimuli.
