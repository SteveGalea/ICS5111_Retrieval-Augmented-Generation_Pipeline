{"summary": "Chaihu facilitates sheng (ascending) and jiang (dispersing) qi to alleviate stagnation of gan (liver) qi[4]. recent research has revealed the pharmacological actions of Chaihu. Chaihu regulates qi stagnation in Chinese Medicine (CM) theory. the CM approach to relieving symptoms is to soothe stagnation of gan qi[17]. gan qi stagnation can lead to distention and pain in the chest and flank. autophagy induces autophagy and autophagic cell death in apoptosis-defective cells via direct inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump (SERCA) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), with disruption of calcium homeostasis and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. autophagy in health and diseases has been highlighted for its protective roles in various autophagy is a protective mechanism that eliminates abnormal proteins and defective organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, or ER membranes. a recent study further revealed essential roles of autophagy in limiting DNA damage and chromosome instability. failure of autophagy process can result in carcinogenesis or cell death. phage inflammatory protein 1 and interferon (IFN) for heat production, and depends on antipyretics (IL-10, glucocorticoids, and neuropeptides) for heat dissipation. inflammatory protein 1 and interferon (IFN) for heat production, and depends on antipyretics (IL-10, glucocorticoids, and neuropeptides) autophagy exhibited protective functions in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver. disruption of the virulence factor from the HSV-1 virus could prevent fatal encephalitis. ihu-induced autophagy alleviates gan qi stagnation. hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gynecological diseases, and hyperlipidemia. the same prescription reduced the abnormally high plasma level of cholecystokinin in chronic pancreatitis. in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury, autophagy induction attenuated the ischemic and reperfusion damage to the organ. autophagy activation might be beneficial to the recovery of the liver function. the decoction had multiple functions in immunomodulation, apoptosis, and anti-angiogenesis. the decoction had multiple functions in immunomodulation, apoptosis, and anti-angiogenesis. autophagy promotes autophagic cell death in cells 97. autophagy killed apoptosis-resistant cancer cells under chemotherapy. autophagy could mediate its protective effects on gan qi stagnation-induced emotional instability. saikosaponins increased hepatic uptake of cholesterol and decreased plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. a study on depressive patients revealed correlations between plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum neurotransmitters, and depression. Chaihu regulates qi stagnation in Chinese Medicine. the pharmacological effects of Chaihu are attributed to its active components, Ssa, saikosaponin-c (Ssc), and Ssd [19,20]. Ssc induces umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and capillary vascularization [28], and possesses anti-hepatitis effects [29-32]. inflammatory symptoms and diseases Immunomodulation Antibacteria and antivirus Modulation of cytokine secretion Removal of abnormal protein aggregates Detoxification and degradation of toxins and inflammatory proteins Reduction of distention and pain in the chest and flank. mice deficient in autophagy-related gene (Atg 5) showed immediate increases of autophagy in various tissues. a recent study further revealed essential roles of autophagy in limiting DNA damage and chromosome instability. failure of autophagy process can result in carcinogenesis or cell death. inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and interferon (IFN) for heat production. autophagy was also found to regulate immunological responses to invading microorganisms. defective autophagy was involved in inflammatory diseases such as lupus erythematosis and Crohn\u2019s disease. the prominent anti-inflammatory effects of Chaihu could be mediated through autophagy induction. the group was the first to report the autophagic activities of Chaihu and Ssd [16]. hepatoprotective effects of Chaihu and saikosaponins are related to improvement of gan qi stagnation. saikosaponins exhibited potent stimulatory effects on pancreatic enzyme secretion in rats. patients treated with \"xiao Chaihu\" decoction showed a significantly lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma [81], reduction in cancer pain and tumor size [82,83], and prevention of liver cancer relapse [84]. the decoction had multiple functions in immunomodulation, apoptosis, and anti-angiogenesis [85-87]. autophagy was responsible for massive cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. autophagic inducers also promoted autophagic cell death in tumors. despite its adaptive and pro-survival roles, autophagy can lead to type II programmed cell death. stress revealed elevated levels of lactic acid, saturated fatty acid, and blood sugar, and reduced levels of unsaturated fatty acid and high density lipoprotein [102] another study applied stress to a macaque model with premenstrual syndrome showed increased plasma levels of serotonin (5-HT), noradrenalin, and prolactin [103] authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions VKWW conceived and planned the review."}
