{"summary": "researchers firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias. the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2. codon usage bias in human RNA viruses is related to mutational pressure, G+C content, the segmented nature of the genome and the route of transmission of the virus. study of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) late genes has revealed a relationship between codon usage and tRNA availability. codon usage may play a key role in the evolution of astroviruses and small DNA viruses. studies on the phylogenetic relationship of RHDVs showed only one serotype had been isolated, and no genotyping for RHDV was reported. in order to better understand the characteristics of the RHDV genome, we have analyzed codon usage and dinucleotide composition. RSCU values of each codon in a ORF of RHDV were calculated according to previous reports (2 Sharp, Tuohy et al. 1986) as gij is the observed number of the ith codon for jth amino acid which has ni type of synonymous codons. the effective number of codons (ENC) The ENC, as the best estimator of absolute synonymous codon usage bias [16], was calculated for the quantification of the codon usage bias of each ORF [17] the predicted values of ENC were calculated as ENC = 2 + s + 29 s 2 + ( 1 - s 2 ) where s represents the given (G+C)3% value. the serial number (SN), collection dates, isolated areas and GenBank accession numbers are listed in Table 1.

Discussion There have been more features that are unique to RHDV. effective number of codons used in each ORF plotted against the GC3s. all spots lie below the expected curve. efficiency of gene expression is influenced by regulator sequences or elements. ENC reflects evolution of codon usage variation and nucleotide composition to some degree. no correlation exists in ENC values of two ORFs, indicating that codon usage patterns and evolution of two ORFs are separated each other. RSCU and ENC between two ORFs are quite different. all of the spots lie below the expected curve. effective number of codons used in each ORF plotted against the GC3s. the continuous curve plots the relationship between GC3s and ENC. ENC reflects evolution of codon usage variation and nucleotide composition to some degree. no correlation existed in ENC values between ORF1 and ORF2. our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias. negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
