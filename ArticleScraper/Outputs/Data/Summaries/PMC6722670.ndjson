{"summary": "antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short, positively-charged oligopeptides that exhibit a diversity of structures and functions. AMPs are a fundamental component of the innate immune system and play a vital role in the initial immune response generated against both injury and infections. AMPs are synthesized and stored in cells of myeloid origin and epithelial cells, among the first responders to infections. Defensins are classified into three subgroups:, and. humans do not produce functional members of the -defensin family of AMPs. expression of -defensin mRNA contains a pre-mature stop codon which prevent translation. functional -defensins are present in non-human primates. -defensins are composed of 29 to 34 amino acids with an overall positive charge. -defensins exhibit a characteristic -sheet structure with a distinctive six-cysteine motif. -defensins are synthesized as pre-propeptides consisting of a N-terminal signal sequence, an anionic pro-peptide, and a C-terminal mature peptide comprised of approximately 30 amino acids. defensins can block viral infection through direct action on virus particles or interfere indirectly at various stages of the viral life cycle [10,18]. available data suggest antiviral activity occurs predominantly at viral entry steps; however, antiviral effects at other stages of infection have also been reported. ing; release inhibition of viral components from endosomes; decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production. ing; release inhibition of viral components from endosomes; decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production. adenovirus Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus capable of infecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, ocular, and excretory systems in humans. there are approximately 80 recognized HAdV serotypes, subdivided into species A\u2013G [21,22]. ivity of HAdV subspecies D and F is yet to be determined. the cause of species specificity of HD5 activity is yet to be determined. neutrophils predominate in infected airways. the exact sequence of immunomodulatory events is yet to be determined. deletion of the HBD1 analog in mice resulted in a more serious inflammatory reaction to IAV [13,27]. -defensins inhibit IAV replication in infected cells. -defensins inhibit IAV replication in infected cells. HNP4 inhibits HIV replication with greater effectiveness than HNP1, HNP2, and HNP3. but it is unclear whether efficacy of HNP4 is mediated only through a direct effect on virions or also on host processes that ultimately affect viral replication. study assessing leukotriene B4 stimulation of nasal neutrophil activity highlighted -defensins as a possible source of antiviral activity against RSV. cell pre-treated with HBD-2 (4 g/mL), can reduce titers by up to 100,000-fold following infection. evolution of defensins suggests this to be a favorable strategy. the antiviral activity of HNP-1 and HD5 (5 g/mL) against HPV is time-independent, with robust inhibition even when peptides are introduced to cells six hours post infection in vitro. the authors demonstrated that the peptides do not inhibit viral entry but rather prevent virion escape from cytoplasmic vesicles. -defensins 5 (HD5) and 6 (HD6) are expressed in epithelial cells in the small intestine. -defensins are primarily expressed by epithelial cells and keratinocytes. fensins are synthesized as pre-propeptides consisting of a N-terminal signal sequence, an anionic pro-peptide, and a mature peptide comprised of 30 amino acids. -defensins have a short N-terminal pro-region and can retain antimicrobial activity in full-length form. they are synthesized in epithelial compartments and can range from 38 to 42 amino acids in length. dritic cells recruitment to sites of infection, wound healing and angiogenesis, differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells, and regulation of cell death pathways. the concentration of HNPs released into the microenvironment upon activation of neutrophils during inflammation exerts a differential effect on cytokine production in activated monocytes. HAdV is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus capable of infecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, ocular, and excretory systems in humans. there are approximately 80 recognized HAdV serotypes, subdivided into species A\u2013G. alpha defensins have demonstrated an ability to hinder HAdV infections in vitro [21,23]. HD5 reduces HAdV replication by 95% when cells are exposed to the peptide (IC50 = 3\u20134 M) prior to infection, and by 50% when peptide is added 30\u201360 min post inoculation. the binding activity of defensins against IAV is increased by formation of multi-molecular assemblies of defensins. expression of -defensins HBD1, HBD2 and HBD3 has been reported in various epithelial cell tissues. however, HBD1 and HBD2 have also been detected in monocytes, macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. HNP-1 and 2 can reduce infectious virus of the Phil82 strain of IAV by 85% to 90% in various cell lines. inhibition mediated by the direct binding of defensins with HIV virions is attributed to interactions between positively-charged HNPs and negatively-charged moieties of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120. expression of HBD2 and HBD3 can be induced by microbial products such as endotoxins, viruses, bacteria, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. HBD2 inhibits the formation of early HIV transcript products but does not affect cell\u2013cell fusion. cells pre-treated with HBD-2 (4 g/mL), can reduce viral titers 100-fold following infection. electron microscopy images revealed damage to the lipid envelope of RSV following HBD-2 treatment. defensins may also limit viral evolutionary strategies that counter antiviral activities. -defensins, particularly HD5, demonstrate robust anti-HPV activity. expression cathelicidins are peptides with a conserved 100-amino-acid cathelin domain. expression cathelicidins are peptides with a conserved 100-amino-acid cathelin domain. LL-37 is also produced by monocytes, NK cells, mast cells, B cells, colon enterocytes, and keratinocytes. in epithelial skin cells, LL-37 is further cleaved into shorter segments exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity. LL-37 is also produced by monocytes, NK cells, mast cells, B cells, colon enterocytes, and keratinocytes. LL-37 is proposed to remove the outer membrane of viruses in a single event during an antimicrobial attack rather than a gradual piece-by-piece removal [37] it is likely that in vivo, IAV encounters LL-37 in the respiratory tract following innate immune responses against the virus. LL-37 inhibits the NY01 strain of IAV with a significant reduction in uptake of virus into cells. a reduction in viral load, direct antiviral effects in epithelial cells, and inflammatory cytokine production have all been linked to LL-37 activity. LL-37 inhibited a strain containing only the pandemic HA (Mex 1:7). this inhibition was surprisingly lost at higher concentrations of LL-37. experimental data also demonstrates the participation of LL-37 in host defenses against IAV. LL-37 directly inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. this activity is less potent when compared to inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (20%\u201330% inhibition at 100 M) the plasma levels of LL-37 in HIV positive individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy are much higher than in patients who are not undergoing ART. LL-37 inhibition was not as potent as with the former. a recent study using deNV-2 infected keratinocytes has shown the production of AMPs by infected cells. vitamin D is an inducer of LL-37 expression. supplementation of populations with vitamin D prior to DENV outbreak seasons has been suggested as a possible preventative strategy. studies evaluating the efficacy of LL-37 on HRV have used airway epithelial cells. LL-37 demonstrates direct antiviral activity against HRV when added as a pre-treatment by acting on viral particles, and when added post infection by acting on the host cell [59]. LL-37 can inhibit HSV-1 infection when pre-incubated with virions in vitro. LL-37 reduces viral titers in corneal epithelial cells by more than 100-fold compared to a scrambled LL-37 control. LL-37 released from HSV-1 infected keratinocytes can also enhance HIV-1 infection. the emergence of ZIKV is a global concern since it is the first major infectious disease that has been associated with birth defects in over five decades [66]. there are no vaccines or treatments available to prevent ZIKV infection in primary human astrocytes. GF-17 increases interferon-2 (IFN-2) expression in a dose-dependent manner. LL-37 has demonstrated anti-HCV properties in cell culture. titers are significantly reduced when HCV is pre-incubated with LL-37. the antiviral effects of LL-37 are not associated or dependent on a specific strain. expression Cathelicidins are peptides with a conserved 100-amino-acid cathelin domain. cathelicidins are typically linear peptides that fold into amphipathic -helical structures which are frequently cleaved from the highly variable C-terminal antimicrobial domain. in humans, cathelicidin is produced by a vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway. LL-37 is also produced by monocytes, NK cells, mast cells, B cells, colon enterocytes, and keratinocytes. LL-37 is also produced by monocytes, NK cells, mast cells, B cells, colon enterocytes, and keratinocytes. concentrations can increase up to 20 g/mL (2.2 M) during infections in bronchoalveolar fluid. LL-37 is proposed to remove the outer membrane of viruses in a single event during an antimicrobial attack rather than a gradual piece-by-piece removal [37]. this suggests a carpet model of antimicrobial peptide action, wherein a susceptible membrane remains intact until a threshold concentration of peptide is reached, following which a rapid disintegration of the targeted membrane occurs [47,48]. in vitro plaque assays demonstrated one log inhibition of PR/8. LL-37 treatment did not prevent viral uptake, cause viral aggregation, and was not associated with blocking of hemagglutinin (HA) LL-37 inhibits the NY01 strain of IAV with a significant reduction in uptake of virus into cells. experimental data also demonstrates the participation of LL-37 in host defenses against IAV through modulation of innate immune cells, particularly neutrophils. LL-37 alone does not stimulate this respiratory burst response in neutrophils; however, optimal enhancement of this antiviral response is achieved only when the virus is pre-incubated with LL-37. in vitro evidence of binding of IVA to NETs suggests LL-37 induces an increase in NET formation in response to IAV LL-37 is less potent when compared to inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (20%\u201330% inhibition at 100 M) a recent study showed that treatment of dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) with LL-37 inhibits viral infection in vero cells. incubation of virus with LL-37 (10-15 M) prior to infection inhibits production of viral particles. supplementation of populations with vitamin D prior to DENV outbreak seasons has been suggested as a possible preventative strategy to control the virus at initial stages of infection. LL-37 (50 g/mL) can impact the expression of chemokines and viral load when pre-incubated with RSV. LL-37 demonstrates direct antiviral activity against HRV when added as a pre-treatment by acting on viral particles and when added post infection by acting on the host cell. LL-37 reduces HRV infections in respiratory cells as well as in cystic fibrosis cells. study assessed the release of LL-37 delivered through corneal implant-incorporated nanoparticles. LL-37 blocked HSV-1 infection in corneal epithelial cells by preventing viral-cell attachment. LL-37 released from infected keratinocytes can also enhance HIV-1 infection. LL-37 derivative, GF-17, can be safely used due to its lower toxicity. treatment of primary human astrocytes with 10 M of GF-17 24 h results in at least a 95% decrease in the number of active zika virions. GF-17 increases interferon-2 (IFN-2) expression in a dose-dependent manner, which further impacts the ability of ZIKV to infect primary human astrocytes. LL-37 primarily acts against HCV extracellularly, consistent with the activity of LL-37 against other enveloped viruses. there are no FDA approved therapeutics to combat VEEV infections. LL-37 has recently demonstrated anti-VEEV activity in vitro. LF is a key component of innate immune defenses. it demonstrates antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria and viruses. LF expression may be induced under hormonal control by epithelial cells in mammary glands or at well-defined stages of cell cycle. LF inhibits IAV-mediated cell death and directly binds viral hemagglutinin leading to inhibition of viral hemagglutination. bovine LF has also demonstrated anti-HAdV properties in a dose-dependent manner similar to human LF. LF inhibited HSV-1 replication in human embryo lung cells. LF inhibited HSV-1 replication and adsorption in vero cells independent of iron-binding. hepatitis C and B Virus Lactoferrin has demonstrated efficacy against HCV. studies on the interaction of HCV and LF reported the direct interaction and binding of human and bovine LF with the HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 [99] LFs of various species directly prevented HCV cell entry by binding to virions. pre-incubation of virions or post-treatment of infected cells with human, bovine, sheep, or camel LF prevented HCV replication in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. bovine LF inhibited the HIV-1 entry process by binding to the viral envelope. HIV-1 variants resistant to LF exhibit mutations in the viral envelope protein. LF treatment alone increased CD4+ cell counts, but a more significant increase was observed when combined with antiretroviral therapy. papillomavirus Human and bovine LF and Lfcin have been shown to inhibit the internalization of HPV-16 particles. inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner on haCaT cells. a human variant of Lfcin with amino acids 1 to 49 showed antiviral activity. ovirus, alphaviruses, deNV, and japanese encephalitis virus have been studied. iron-, manganese-, and zinc-saturated LFs have demonstrated anti-poliovirus properties in a dose-dependent manner. LF inhibited infection of BHK-21 cells by Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki Forest viruses (SFV) adapted to bind heparan sulfate. LF is a key component of innate immune defenses. it demonstrates antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria and viruses. LF expression may be induced under hormonal control by epithelial cells in mammary glands or at well-defined stages of cell cycle such as neutrophil differentiation. LF inhibits IAV-mediated cell death and directly binds viral hemagglutinin leading to inhibition of viral hemagglutination [81,82,83,84]. only a few studies have evaluated the activity of human LF in the context of IAV infection. studies assessing inhibition of HSV-1 have revealed the potency of LF at inhibiting replication of the viruses. LF inhibited HSV-1 replication in human embryo lung cells and prevented virus adsorption and entry. a randomized trial of bovine LF in patients with chronic hepatitis C reported that orally-administered LF did not demonstrate significant efficacy against HCV when compared to a placebo control. studies on the interaction of HCV and LF reported the direct interaction and binding of human and bovine LF with the HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 [99] LFs of various species directly prevented HCV cell entry by binding to virions. pre-incubation of virions or post-treatment of infected cells with human, bovine, sheep, or camel LF inhibited HCV replication in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. bovine LF inhibited the HIV-1 entry process by binding to the viral envelope. LF was found to be a more potent inhibitor than human LF in preventing dendritic cell-mediated HIV-1 transmission between cells by directly and strongly binding to DC-SIGN. LF treatment alone increased CD4+ cell counts, but a more significant increase was observed when combined with antiretroviral therapy. papillomavirus Human and bovine LF and Lfcin have been shown to inhibit the internalization of HPV-16 particles. inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner on haCaT cells. a human variant of Lfcin with amino acids 1 to 49 showed antiviral activity. LF inhibited infection of BHK-21 cells by Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki Forest viruses (SFV) adapted to bind heparan sulfate moieties. bovine LF was tested against JEV and DENV, and was capable of inhibiting replication of both viruses. ribonucleases and members of the human RNase A superfamily were mapped to the N-terminal domain that is conserved among ribonucleases. both proteins contain characteristic RNase A superfamily structures and catalytic residues, but exhibit antimicrobial activity against both bacteria and viruses. the production of ECP in infants with bronchiolitis can be used as tool in prediction the risk of wheezing cough development in those infants. earlier studies, EDN did not demonstrate direct activity against HIV; however, it indirectly induces the production of HIV-inhibiting molecules. both proteins contain characteristic RNase A superfamily structures and catalytic residues. they exhibit antimicrobial activity against both bacteria and viruses. eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) has demonstrated inhibitory activity against RSV. ECP is less effective when used to inhibit RSV alone, demonstrating only a six-fold reduction as compared to EDN at a concentration of 50 nM. the production of ECP in infants with bronchiolitis can be used as tool in prediction the risk of wheezing cough development in those infants. studies investigating AMPs produced by gamma-delta T cells recorded production of elafin. elafin is a 57-amino-acid single-polypeptide chain produced by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor molecule called trappin-2. elafin and its precursor trappin-2 (Tr) both exhibit anti-HSV activity. elafin and SLPI can provide protection against HIV-1 in vitro. elafin/Tr is found in and produced by epithelial cells of uterine, fallopian tubes, and cervix. studies investigating AMPs produced by gamma-delta T cells recorded production of elafin. elafin is a 57-amino-acid single-polypeptide chain produced by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor molecule called trappin-2. elafin and SLPI exhibit both high homology and similar protease activity. cells were either infected with the adenovirus vector or treated with the recombinant proteins prior to HSV-2 infection. a decrease in viral titers correlated with a decrease in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the antiviral IFN- response was increased. a recent report on multiple groups of HIV-infected women found no correlation between anti-HIV activity of mediators such as elafin and HIV susceptibility. expression Hepcidin, also known as human liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-1, is a 25-amino acids long AMP that is predominately expressed by liver hepatocytes [136] hepcidin mRNA levels were significantly increased in mice during influenza virus PR8 infection. this induction appeared to be IL-6 dependent as IL-6 knockout mice did not induce the expression of hepcidin mRNA. in primary hepatocytes that were stimulated with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, hepcidin was inhibited by IL-6 neutralizing antibodies. the increase in hepcidin levels coincided with an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression. hepcidin-induced sequestering of iron in cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages is a highly favorable condition for HIV pathogenesis. hepcidin mRNA levels were significantly increased in mice during influenza virus PR8 infection. this induction appeared to be IL-6 dependent as IL-6 knockout mice did not induce the expression of hepcidin mRNA. hepcidin expression was found to be highly elevated in chronic hepatitis B and C patients. the increase in hepcidin levels coincided with an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression. hepcidin-induced sequestering of iron in cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages is a highly favorable condition for HIV pathogenesis. -MSH and the tripeptide (KPV) both (10 M) inhibited HIV expression at low concentrations comparable to physiological concentrations of -MSH. both peptides inhibited nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation which is known to enhance HIV viral protein expression. -MSH and the tripeptide (KPV) both (10 M) inhibited HIV expression at low concentrations comparable to physiological concentrations of -MSH. many of the AMPs originally thought to demonstrate only antibacterial activity have been found to exhibit antiviral and immune modulatory capabilities. AMPs are promising therapeutics due to their relatively low toxicity and tolerance in vivo. nebulizing mice with LL-37 prior to infection with IAV can reduce disease severity. the same concept could be applied against other respiratory pathogens such as RSV and rhinovirus. AMPs can also be applied as ointments, gels, or creams. little clinical data on the use, toxicity, efficacy, methods of delivery, or host uptake and the in vivo response to AMPs is currently available to guide the development of AMPs into therapeutic products. the relationship between peptide concentrations used in vitro experiments and physiologically effective concentrations required for in vivo activity is unknown. non-human AMPs are being used as an alternative to human AMPs. a lack of data assessing the pharmacokinetics of AMPs to address issues such as the physiological half-life of peptides. intravenous administered AMPs face proteolytic degradation from enzymes in plasma and tissues. some AMPs are sensitive to salt or serum, a factor that substantially reduces their activity further limiting their applicability in clinical use. the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as delivery vehicles may greatly improve the metabolic stability of AMPs. KK18, an analog of LL-37 via intra-tracheal administration in mice, was able to stabilize the peptide and decrease peptide cytotoxicity in macrophages in vitro. poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PGLA) NPs were also successfully utilized to deliver cationic AMPS [162]. AMPs have also demonstrated selective immune modulation. AMPs can be used as a prophylactic and/or as part of post-exposure antiviral measures. AMPs are a promising avenue to yield new strategies to control and treat a wide range of viral diseases but their application is still at the preliminary stages."}
