{"summary": "IAV consists of eight single-stranded-RNA segments encoding 12 proteins. the nucleoprotein (NP), three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2), two matrix proteins (M1 and M2), two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2), two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and two newly identified proteins (PB1-F2 and PB1-N40) new vaccine strategies are increasingly aimed at conserved CTL and B cell epitopes for IAV to overcome seasonal variations in influenza virus antigens. the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules present viral peptides to specific T-cell receptors. resulting in the proliferation of CTLs and eventually clearance of the virus from the host. 116 SLA I genes have been identified in the SLA-1, SLA-2, and SLA-3 loci. the only SLA-1*0401 structure is limited in identifying CTL epitopes in swine IAV. 28 SLA I allelic genes were cloned from the swine. pSLA-3*hs0202-HA-KMN9-s2m crystalized in complex with swine 2m. peptide-binding motif of SLA-3*hs0202 was assessed using mutant peptides and circular dichroism spectral methods. a gene fragment corresponding to the full-length SLA-3*hs0202 (1,105 bp) was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with allele group-specific PCR primer pairs designed for SLA-3 alleles. the extracellular region of the SLA-3*hs0202 heavy-chain gene was amplified from the pMD-0202 vector by PCR. one peptide with the sequence KMNTQFTAV could form a stable complex with SLA-3*hs0202 following in vitro refolding. the pSLA-3*hs0202 complexes were ultimately concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris and 50 mM NaCl for crystallization. the structures of the pSLA-3*hs0202 complex were solved by molecular replacement using the MOLREP program with SLA-1*0401 as a search model. additional rounds of refinement were performed using the phenix refine program implemented in the PHENIX package (43) a total of 17 mutant peptides with single-residue substitutions at position 2 (P2), 3 (P3), or 9 (P9) were synthesized. their binding affinities to SLA-3*hs0202-restricted epitopes were tested by in vitro refolding as described above. complexes formed by refolding were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. crystal structures have been deposited in the protein data bank. sequence of SLA-3*hs0202 is available at the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) allele group-specific PCR primer pairs designed for SLA-3 alleles using total RNA extracts. the gene fragment was cloned into the pMD-18T vector (TaKaRa) and named pMD-0202. the extracellular region of the SLA-3*hs0202 heavy-chain gene was amplified. pSLA-3*hs0202 complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl for crystallization. the sample was mixed with reservoir buffer at a 1:1 ratio and crystallized. extensive model building was performed by hand with COOT (42), and restrained refinement was performed using REFMAC5. phenix refine program implemented in the PHENIX package (43) with isotropic atomic displacement parameter (ADP) refinement. a total of 17 mutant peptides with single-residue substitutions were synthesized. their binding affinities to SLA-3*hs0202 were tested by in vitro refolding. glu156 was mutated to pSLA-3*hs0202-Ala156. the sequence of SLA-3*hs0202 is available at the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) database. twenty-eight different SLA I genes were cloned from Heishan pigs. pMHC-I structure consisted of 1, 2, and 3 domains of the heavy-chain and the light-chain s2m. the peptide was located in the PBG formed by the 1 and 2 domains. a root mean square difference (RMSD) is higher than the RMSD value of the two SLA-1*0401 (RMSD, 0.401; PDB code 3QQ3) and BoLA-N*01801 (RMSD, 0.295; PDB code b Rmerge = hkl i |Ii(hkl) I(hkl)>|/hkl i Ii(hkl) is the observed intensity and \u00e1I(hkl) is the average intensity from multiple measurements. c R = hkl ||Fobs| k |Fcalc ||hkl |Fobs|, where Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5% of reflections. different exposed areas of HA-KMN9 peptides presented by pSLA-3*hs0202 M1 and M2 were not perfectly aligned. the distance between some atoms of the peptides could reach 2.1. the differences occurred after P3 of the peptide. peptides are 1,447.5 and 1,114.8, and 1,417.0 and 1,031.1 respectively, and detailed information about each residue is provided in Table 2. the electron density maps are clear and indicate that the two distinct peptide conformations are credible. the phenomenon where peptides presented by the same MHC-I molecule show different conformations has been found in other known pMHC-I structures. two nonapeptides presented by SLA-1*0401 showed similar M-like conformations, but their main chains obviously diverge after the P3 residue, similar to what we found in SLA-3*hs0202. HA-KMN9 peptide conformations (thick sticks) compared to those of other peptides (thin sticks) with distinct conformations presented by the same MHC-I allele. different PBG conformations found in M1 and M2 and various interactions with the HA-KMN9 peptide. 74 could form different hydrogen bonds in M1 and M2. N70 forms a hydrogen bond only with Y9 in M1, and Y74 could interact only with N97 in M2. this indicates that the PBG of M1 is narrower but deeper than the M2 PBG. differences are found in the middle of the groove and in the C-terminal region. in M1, P3 Asn formed two hydrogen bonds, with Glu156 and Tyr9. in M2, P3 Asn formed a hydrogen bond only with Glu156. the numbers and positions of hydrogen bonds are the same in M1 and M2. P3 Glu forms two hydrogen bonds with Tyr99 in M1 (dashed red lines) but forms only one hydrogen bond with Tyr99 in M2 (dashed blue line) Ile66, Tyr99, His114, Glu156, Tyr159 (65) ND2 Tyr99 OE1 ND2 Glu156 OE2 OD1 Tyr9 OH P4 Thr Arg62, Ile66, Trp152 (5) P5 Gln NE2 Tyr74 OH Tyr9, Asn70, Thr73, Tyr74, Asn97, Tyr99, His114, Tyr116, Trp152 (37) O Thr73 OG1 P6 P different water molecules found in pSLA-3*hs0202 M1 and M2 structures. water molecules of pSLA-3*hs0202 M1 in a top view (A) and a side view (C) 13 water molecules form 17 hydrogen bonds with the HA-KMN9 peptide. anchor residues determined by alanine scanning and CD spectra. mutation of P2, P3 and P9 decreased the refolding efficiency of the complex. peak 2 and peak 3 represent the aggregated H chain, the correctly refolded SLA-3*hs0202 complex (44 kDa), and the redundant s2m respectively. complexes with peptides P1 A and P5 A mutant peptides can be eluted at NaCl concentrations of 14 to 16%. peak of complex with wild-type peptide is lower than the three high peaks. refolded complex proteins dissociated at NaCl concentrations of 14 to 16%. pSLA-3*hs0202-P9A and pSLA-3*hs0202-P9A are 40.0\u00b0C and 38.3\u00b0C respectively. the side chains of P3 and P9 play key roles in HA-KMN9 peptide binding. this suggests that the interactions formed by the side chains of P5 residues are not essential for the stability of pSLA-3*hs0202. The peptide-binding motif of SLA-3* mutant HA-KMN9 peptides with charged P2 E or P2 R were used to test the influence of Glu45. the binding of P2 R is better than that of P2 E, but both are not as efficient as the wild-type HA-KMN9 peptide. residues comprising the pockets and the residues of bound peptides accommodated by the pockets are shown as stick models. the hydrogen bonds between the peptides and the pockets are shown as dashed red lines. the electrostatic potential of pocket B with the P2 residue is shown. only partial complexes of P2 R can be eluted at normal NaCl concentrations of 14 to 16%. results from further stabilization assays of the refolded complexes by anion exchange. HLA-B*0801 and HLA-B*4402 have D pockets similar to those of SLA-3*hs0202 (51, 52) their D pockets can accommodate P3 N and bind it in a manner similar to that of SLA-3*hs0202 (156); therefore, they should have similar preferences for P3 residues. the charged Arg156 of SLA-1*0401 is vital to the peptide binding of the D pocket. Glu156 is also a charged residue in the D pocket of SLA-3*hs0202. the binding properties of HA-KMN9 and P3 Q mutant peptides are not much affected by Ala156 mutation. pSLA-3*hs0202 and SLA-3*hs0202-Ala156 mutant peptides co-refolded. glu156 is shown in red as a stick model. compared with that of SLA-3*hs0202, the D pocket became bigger and more hydrophobic without the negative side chain of Glu156. efficiencies of HA-KMN9 mutant peptides were lower than those of the wild-type HA-KMN9 peptide. only P9 V could form a stable complex that could survive in the anion-exchange buffer. the 9-mer peptide-binding motif of SLA-3*hs0202 was preliminarily determined to be X-(M/A/R)-(N/Q/R/F)-X-X-X- Q9 were considered HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes. only PB2-RMQ9 could stimulate an effective CTL response. none of the other peptides we predicted here have been deposited in the IEDB. six predicted epitope peptides from HA and NP proteins were synthesized and tested for binding with SLA-3*hs0202 by in vitro refolding. one peptide, KMNTQFTAV, could form a stable pMHC-I with SLA-3*hs0202 and s2m. pSLA-3*hs0202 complex was further purified by gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography. a = 206.46, b = 41.47, c = 106.74, = 90.00, = 117.46, = 90.00 Resolution () 50.0\u20131.48 (1.518\u20131.48) No. of reflections 428,111 No. of unique reflections 127,299 Completeness (%) 99.8 (100) Avg I/(I) 19.482 (3.536) Rmerge (%)b 7.4 (38.4) Redundancy 3.7 ( superimposition of the HA-KMN9 peptides presented by pSLA-3*hs0202 M1 (green) and M2 (orange) they display a typical MHC-I structure but with obvious skewing in the 1, 2, and 3 domains. the maximum distance between the same atoms in the two peptides, which could reach 2.1, is represented by the dashed red line. the mismatch reached a peak at the P6 residue, where the two Phe residues in M1 and M2 are the maximum distance apart. however, the conformational differences between the two peptides are diminished but still exist. the arch of the M2 peptide is higher than that of the M1 peptide, but the length is shorter. electron density maps are clear and indicate that the two distinct peptide conformations are reliable. two nonapeptides presented by SLA-1*0401 showed similar M-like conformations, but their main chains obviously diverge after the P3 residue. the peptide conformation was found to be almost identical to that of HLA-B*0801 (PDB code 1M15) the complex structure of HLA-B*0801-TCR shows that the large side chain of P7 Tyr interacts with the TCRs CDR1 and CDR3 (47). pSLA-3*hs0202 consists of 6 pockets, similar to other known pMHC-I structures (48) but superimposition of the M1 and M2 PBGs showed that they have different conformations. differences in these residues are caused not only by shifts in their side chains, but also by the mismatch of the 1 and 2 helixes. s that directly interact with the HA-KMN9 peptide are labeled and shown as thick sticks. they are located in the middle and at the C terminus of the PBG. two different hydrogen bonds formed by these residues are shown as dashed lines. the total numbers of VDWs were 373 and 299 in M1 and M2 respectively. the water molecules involved in the hydrogen bond network between the PBG and the HA-KMN9 peptide are different in M1 and M2. in M2, only 9 water molecules and 10 direct bonds are found. Lys146 could form two hydrogen bonds in M2 (dashed blue lines) but could not form any hydrogen bonds in M1 (dashed blue lines) the numbers in parentheses are the amounts of van der Waals force. the numbers in parentheses are the amounts of van der Waals force. water molecules of pSLA-3*hs0202 M2 in a top view (A) and a side view (D) 9 water molecules in M2 form 10 direct bonds with the HA-KMN9 peptide. anchor residues determined by alanine scanning are roughly the same. peak 2 and peak 3 represent the aggregated H chain, the correctly refolded SLA-3*hs0202 complex (44 kDa) peak 2 indicates high efficiency of the peptide to help the MHC renature. peak 2 indicates high efficiency of the peptide to help the MHC renature. unfolded fractions were determined by monitoring the CD value at 218 nm (45) CD spectra were further used to test stabilities of pSLA-3*hs0202 complexes with the mutant peptides. the Tm value of the wild-type HA-KMN9 peptide is 47.4\u00b0C, similar to the Tm value of pSLA-1*0401, which we tested previously (47.1\u00b0C) the peptide-binding motif of SLA-3*hs0202 is the set of acceptable combinations of P2, P3, and P9 residues. the B pocket consists of Tyr7, Ala24, Val25, Gly26, Val34, Glu45, Arg62, Glu63, Ile66, and Ser67. the side chain of Arg62 stretches to the 1 helix and is inserted into the B pocket. 202 and HLA-A*0201 are not same, they bind P2 M in very similar manner. refolding results showed that SLA-3*hs0202 could not bind mutant peptides as efficiently as the wild-type KMN peptide. only the mutant peptides could form stable complexes. gel filtration chromatograms of the HA-KMN9 peptide and its P2 mutants (P2 R, P2 E, P2 F, P2 T, P2 I, P2 L, and P2 V) only partial complexes of P2 R can be eluted at normal NaCl concentrations of 14 to 16%. the complex with P3 Q could be eluted normally at NaCl concentrations of 14 to 16%. only a small amount of P9 I could be eluted normally at NaCl concentrations of 14 to 16%. refolding results showed that the P3 Q mutant peptide could bind to SLA-3*hs0202 as well as the wild-type HA-KMN9 peptide. the refolding efficiency of the P3 F mutant peptide was lower than that of the wild-type and P3 Q mutant peptides. the modeling structure of SLA-3*hs0202-Ala156 was shown to have a bigger and more hydrophobic D pocket. this change made the D pocket of SLA-3*hs0202-Ala156 prefer the hydrophobic P3 residues, such as P3 A and P3 F, and have weaker resistance to P3 E. Glu156 is a vital residue for the peptide motif of SLA-3*hs0202. the F pocket is composed of the conserved residues Tyr84, Tyr123, Thr143, Lys146, and Trp147, as well as the less conserved residues Asn77, Asn80, Leu81, Phe95, Ser97, Tyr116, and Ala139. the nonpolar side chain of P9-V stretched into the F pocket and formed many VDWs with the surrounding residues on the bottom and wall of the pocket. 28 total 9-mer epitope peptides predicted to fit the motif. six of them were completely conserved in the H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 strains. five have amino acid substitutions among different strains. nonapeptides derived from the PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NA, NP, M1, and NS1 proteins were selected based on the motif X-(M/A/R)-(N/Q/R/F)-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-(V/I) both peptides could form stable complexes with SLA-3*hs0202. SD between M1 and M2 is 0.873, which is higher than RMSD of the SLA-1*0401 and BoLA-N*01801 molecules. major differences in the HA-KMN9 peptides occur at the mismatches of the -helixes of M1 and M2. this finding indicates that the flexibility of the swine MHC class I carbon backbone might expand the peptide conformation. structural pocket alignment showed accuracy in determining the peptide-binding motif of a new MHC-I allele. the peptide-binding motif of SLA-3*hs0202 overlaps that of the most popular HLA allele, HLA-A*0201, which prefers L or M in position 2 and I or V. both HA-KMN9 peptides from the PR8 and Qinghai strains cannot elicit significant CTL responses in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice (19, 58). this may be caused by the intermediate affinity between the HA-KMN9 peptide and HLA-A*0201, which was tested by both quantitative inhibition assays and in vitro refolding. the first structure of the SLA-3 allele determined here should help increase our understanding of antigen presentation in swine. the \u201cepitope map\u201d for SLA-3*hs0202 can benefit the development of CTL vaccines against IAV diseases."}
