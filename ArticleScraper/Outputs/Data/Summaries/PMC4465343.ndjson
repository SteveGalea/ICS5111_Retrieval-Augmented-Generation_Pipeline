{"summary": "studies have uncovered a wealth of information about the relationship between the sequences and efficacies of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. this knowledge has stimulated efforts to enhance antibody breadth and potency for therapeutic use. mAbs have become central to strategies for the treatment of various diseases. anti-HIV-1 bNAbs can prevent [17\u201320] or suppress infection [21\u201324] when delivered passively in animal models of HIV-1 infection. bNAbs can prevent [17\u201320] or suppress infection [21\u201324], prompting efforts to improve their potency. this review will discuss engineering efforts to create more potent anti-HIV-1 antibodies using both traditional IgG and modified architectures. we also consider how engineering efforts can result in polyreactivity, the ability of an antibody to bind to more than one antigen. viral swarm within a single infected individual makes it difficult to select for antibodies that maintain breadth across viral strains. bNAbs isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals often show high levels of somatic hypermutation. a structure-based approach was taken to improve NIH45-46 [46], a more potent clonal variant of VRC01 [15]. both VRC01 and NIH45-46 fail to fill a hydrophobic pocket within gp120 to mimic burying of a hydrophobic CD4 residue, Phe43CD4. 279gp120\u2013280gp120 and 458gp120\u2013459gp120 (NNGG) lead to resistance [53]. rational design was used to create two new mutants: 45\u201346m2 (S28YLC) which introduce contacts with an Asn276gp120-linked glycan. 45\u201346m2 neutralized nearly 96% of viruses, an improvement over other CD4bs bNAbs. a new bNAb, VRC07, was about two-fold more potent than VRC01. the new bNAb, VRC07, contained the same four-residue CDRH3 insert. this result illustrates that deeper searching of bNAb donor repertoires can identify more potent clonal relatives. a chimeric version of glycan-dependent bNAbs 10-1074 and PGT121 [14,57] was constructed by grafting five PGT121 heavy chain residues identified as contacting a complex-type N-glycan into the 10-1074 heavy chain. the resulting chimeric antibody had improved potency compared with PG9 [62] polyreactivity was first characterized in detail for the 4E10 and 2F5 bNAbs [75]. the presence of autoreactive/polyreactive antibodies has been associated with HIV-1 infection for more than 25 years. the presence of autoreactive/polyreactive antibodies has been associated with HIV-1 infection. a majority of anti-HIV-1 Env antibodies showed binding to both self and nonself antigens. anti-gp41 antibodies showed the most polyreactivity, particularly against lipid antigens. polyreactivity may not necessarily be a problem for anti-HIV-1 antibodies, especially as it is a common property of donor-derived bNAbs. substitutions into NIH45\u201346 and VRC07 derivatives resulted in increased polyreactivity and decreased in vivo half-lives [54,94] in addition, the more potent version of 10\u20131074, 10\u20131074GM, exhibited increased polyreactivity compared with its PGT121 and 10\u20131074 parents. strategies being used to improve properties such as poor solubility and aggregation profiles that could lead to polyreactivity include switching the IgG isotype, a small-molecule inhibitor of viral entry, aplaviroc, was conjugated to the Fc to enhance neutralization potency. the crossMab technology allows for specific heavy chain heterodimerization using \u2018knob-into-hole\u2019 mutations to combine heavy chains from two IgGs. a bispecific anti-HIV-1 reagent fused the gp120-binding domains of a CD4i antibody to an scFv version of a CD4i antibody. the sCD4-17b reagent was recently expressed in a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) format on T cells to target and kill HIV-1-infected cells. c architecture and VH and VL domains are swapped in one half of the reagent. other architectures attach a second Ig variable domain N-terminal to an IgG. another potent chimeric reagent was constructed as an Fc fusion with CD4- and coreceptor-mimetic peptides. newly discovered potent bNAbs and advances in engineering antibodies offer possibilities for improved passive delivery strategies. more potent bNAbs could be used therapeutically at a lower concentration and thus reduce cost and/or production time. there also remains a need to create reagents to combat viral mutation and the natural sequence diversity of HIV-1. Conflicts of interest A.P. West and P.J. Bjorkman have patent applications pending on improving CD4-binding site antibodies. the remaining authors have no conflicts of interest."}
