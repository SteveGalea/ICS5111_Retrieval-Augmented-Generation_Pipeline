{"summary": "universal influenza vaccines are believed to be a promising strategy for vaccine development based on their ability to induce cross-protective immunity against a broad-spectrum of influenza virus infection. the ectodomain of influenza virus M2 protein (M2e) is highly conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) the B. subtilis spore offers resistance properties and can survive extreme temperature, desiccation and exposure to solvents and other noxious chemicals. a variety of advantages have been shown in the utilization of the B. subtilis spore as surface display, including high stability and good safety profile. recombinant spores containing heterologous genes can be used as fusion partners. the consensus sequence of M2e of human influenza A viruses was fused to CotB-based fusion frame and was added to 3 linker-chained tandem copies to overcome the low immunogenicity of monomeric M2e. the confirmed clone, RSM2e3, was used for further analysis. fusion protein (37 kDa) was revealed in the samples containing CotB-M2e. this indicates the successful expression of heterologous M2e protein on the recombinant RSM2e3 spore surface and the specificity of expressed fusion protein to the consensus sequence of M2e protein of influenza A viruses. spores were equally resistant to chloroform and lysozyme treatment. the presence of the CotB-M2e fusion did not significantly affect spore structure and function. species identification was performed to confirm the recombinant RSM2e3 as B. subtilis. recombinant RSM2e3 spores induced strong systemic immune responses in immunized mouse sera and spleens. recombinant RSM2e3 spores induced systemic humoral immune responses in immunized mice. mice were vaccinated orally with RSM2e3 spores, wild-type PY79 control spores or PBS control. M2e-specific IgG antibodies were tested using mouse sera collected at 0, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 weeks post-immunization. at least 10,000 CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes were first gated. frequencies of IFN-+ and IL-4+ cells were then analyzed. wild-type PY79 and PBS are controls. recombinant RSM2e3 spores induced strong local mucosal immune responses. sIgA antibodies elicited by RMS2e3 spores were tested using mouse intestine and lung washes 5 d post-A/PR/8/34(H1N1) virus challenge. mouse lung specimens revealed a significantly lower level of virus titers in the mice immunized with RSM2e3 than those administered with wild-type PY79 spores or PBS. recombinant RSM2e3 spores were tested at 5 d post-A/PR/8/34(H1N1) virus challenge. the data are expressed as mean SE of viral titers. the lower limit of detection is 1.5 Log10TCID50/g. the cotB-M2e fusion was integrated on the B. subtilis PY79 chromosome at the thrC locus by double-crossover recombination events. the confirmed clone, RSM2e3, was used for further analysis. recombinant spores stained with M2e-specific primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG-FITC secondary antibody only showed background fluorescence signals. recombinant spores stained with isotype antibody showed no fluorescence reactivity in the presence of the test antibodies. this result suggests that M2e protein was displayed on the surface of recombinant spores. electron microscopy visualized dimensional topographies of bacterial cells (A), RSM2e3; (D), PY79. Species identification was performed to confirm the recombinant RSM2e3 as B. subtilis. recombinant RSM2e3 spores induced systemic humoral immune responses in immunized mouse sera and spleens. recombinant RSM2e3 spores induced strong systemic immune responses in immunized mouse sera and spleens. mice were vaccinated orally with RSM2e3 spores, wild-type PY79 control spores or PBS control. M2e-specific IgG antibodies were tested using mouse sera from 17 weeks post-immunization. FN-+ and IL-4+ cells were then analyzed and indicated as percentages of CD4+/CD4+ cells. wild-type PY79 and PBS are controls. recombinant RSM2e3 spores induced strong, long-term systemic humoral IgG antibodies and IL-4-secreting cellular immune responses. sIgA antibodies elicited by RMS2e3 spores were tested using mouse intestine and lung washes 5 d post-A/PR/8/34(H1N1) virus challenge. control mice were administered with wild-type PY79 spores or PBS. results from mouse lung specimens revealed a significantly lower level of virus titers in the mice immunized with RSM2e3 than those administered with wild-type PY vaccinated mice tested at 5 d post-A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus challenge. spores themselves can have adjuvant effects; therefore, no adjuvants are required for immunization. a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide vaccine (M2e-MAP) containing 4 molcules of M2e from the H5N1 virus confers cross-protective immunity against lethal challenges of divergent strains of H5N1 virus. a recombinant protein containing 3 molcules of such M2e fused with activation associated protein-1 (ASP-1) adjuvant provides significant cross-clade protection against the above H recombinant RSM2e3 spores have self-adjuvanticity, and no adjuvant is needed for the spore-based vaccine formulation. the potential adjuvant function of B. subtilis spores might be partly due to that these spores can serve as a \u2018natural\u2019 microparticle that likely expresses ligands recognized by innate pattern recognition receptors. spores displaying tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) generated antibodies to both the antigen in the primary oral inoculation sites and those displayed on the resporulated spores in intestines. it has been shown that the intestine constitutes an important organ for the mucosal immune system by maintaining the ability to elicit mucosal immune responses. RSM2e3 spores presented effective protection against heterologous influenza virus challenge regardless of the amino acid difference in the M2e of challenging A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus and the M2e in RSM2e3. this study utilizes bacterial spores as a delivery vector to display conserved M2e protein of human influenza A viruses on the spore surface, thereby generating a bacterial spore vaccine with high immunogenicity and sufficient protective the 1,108-bp amplified product was ligated to pMD18-T (TaKaRa, Japan) and then cleaved with BglII (CotBF1) and HindIII (pMD18-T) for insertion into pDG166433 (cleaved with BamH I and HindIII), making a recombinant pDG1664-CotB-M2e3 plasmid. Ermr (1g/ml) clones resulted from double-crossover recombination. the 3,676-bp PCR product indicates the occurrence of correct recombination events based on the presence of an additional part of gene fusion carrying CotB and 3 M2e copies. the blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with M2e-specific mAb 14C2 (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas) and washed 5 times. a total of 105 purified spores were washed in PBS for 3 times and incubated with either M2e-specific or isotype mAb at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. sporulating bacteria and purified spores of RSM2e3 and PY79 were collected and fixed in glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. samples were dehydrated using a series of graded ethanol (50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) and then embedded in Epon 812. the 1,400-bp PCR product was sequenced using oligonucleotides provided in the kit. the genes for 16S rRNA from RSM2e3 and 14 typical commercial Bacillus probiotics were aligned using the mega 5.2 program. the alignment was used to construct Neighbor-Joining trees using the phylogeny module in the mega 5.2 program. twenty mice/group were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 103 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus, respectively, at week 17 post-1st vaccination. ten infected mice in each group were observed daily for 14 d for clinical symptoms. splenocytes (107) were stimulated with or without M2e peptide for 8 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in the presence of GolgiPlugTM containing brefeldin A (1 l/ml; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) the cells were fixed using a Cytofix/CytopermTM PlusKit and stained directly with conjugated anti-mouse-CD3 (FITC), anti-mouse- 50 l of 0.5% turkey red blood cells were added to 50 l of cell culture supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. the virus titer was calculated by the Reed-Muench method and expressed as Log10TCID50/g of lung tissues."}
