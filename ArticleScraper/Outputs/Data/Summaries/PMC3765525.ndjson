{"summary": "the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is an ubiquitous enteropathogenic virus. it replicates in epithelial cells of both small and large intestine after oral uptake. around 13% of all infected cats are not able to clear the virus. FECV and FIPV show such a clinically (mild enteritis versus FIP) and epidemiologically (easy versus restricted transmission) different behaviour. the majority of all strains (both FECVs and FIPVs) are serotype I viruses. cultures of intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum (ileocytes) and colon (colonocytes) were established by inducing a combined expression of SV40 T-antigen and hTERT in primary ileocytes and colonocytes. the reliability of these cultures for their use in FCoV-research was first investigated by comparing replication capacities of the avirulent FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 and the highly virulent FCoV WSU 79 cats were sedated by intramuscular injection of a mixture of Ketamin (0.05 mL/kg; Anesketin\u00ae, Eurovet, Heusden-Zolder, Belgium) and Midazolam (0.05 mL/kg; Dormicum\u00ae, Roche, Brussels, Belgium) euthanized by intracardial injection of 20% SodiumPentobarbital (1 mL/1.5 kg; Kela Laboratories, Hoogstraten, Belgium) the pieces were incubated for 45 min (ileum) or 60 min (colon) at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were seeded in 24-well plates or on glass coverslips coated with collagen type I. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT), followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at RT. the cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C with monoclonal anti-vimentin antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. recombinant lentiviruses were expressing either the SV40 large T antigen or the hTERT protein. after 30 min, medium was added and the cells were further incubated overnight. after 5 days, the cells were detached by trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin - 0.02% EDTA. cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the SV40 large T antigen (Applied Biological Materials Inc.) containing 10% normal goat serum followed by goat anti-mouse-AF594 labelled antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. nuclei were stained and slides were mounted as described above. primary cells of three cats were inoculated at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1. monolayers of continuous ileocyte and colonocyte cultures were inoculated in the same way. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at RT. RNA was extracted from faecal suspensions using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Benelux BV, Belgium) and from tissue suspensions with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). primers were designed using the Primer 3 plus software within a conserved region of ORF1b based on FCoV sequences. 250 ng RNA was incubated for 5 min at 65 \u00b0C with 2 M reverse primer ORF1bRV and 10 mM dNTP mix. the reaction was terminated at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min. RNA was removed by incubation with RNase H for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. cRNA standards were transcribed by incubation for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with 10 transcription buffer, 500 M rNTPs and 20 U T7 RNA polymerase-Plus Enzyme Mix. ten-fold serial dilutions of RNA were made over a range of 6 log units (107-102) for the generation of the standard curve. 20% suspensions were made in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin (Continental Pharma Inc.), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Certa) and 0.1 mg/mL gentamycin (Gibco BRL) the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 70 \u00b0C until use. cells were washed and further incubated in medium for 24 h. incubation with PF 4% (10 min, RT), followed by incubation with methanol containing 1% H2O2 (5 min, RT) cells were visualized by adding sodium-acetate buffer containing amino-ethylcarbazola (AEC) and H2O2 for 10 min at RT. serotype of all samples was determined by means of RT-PCR described by addie et al. sequences of FCoV ORF3 and ORF7 were extracted from faecal suspensions with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) cDNA was generated using SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) the nucleospin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used for purification of the PCR products. the cats were euthanized by intracardial injection of 20% SodiumPentobarbital (1 mL/1.5 kg; Kela Laboratories, Hoogstraten, Belgium) the protocol used for isolation of primary ileocytes and colonocytes was based on the one described by Rusu et al., with minor adaptations. pieces were incubated for 45 min (ileum) or 60 min (colon) at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were seeded in 24-well plates or on glass coverslips coated with collagen type I. the cells were cultivated in a 37 \u00b0C / 5% CO2 atmosphere. the culture medium was replaced by medium containing 2% FBS to restrict the outgrowth of non-epithelial cells. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT), followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at RT. recombinant lentiviruses expressed either the SV40 large T antigen or the hTERT protein. after 30 min, medium was added and the cells were further incubated overnight. after 5 days, cells were detached by trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin - 0.02% EDTA, subcultured in collagen-coated wells. cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the SV40 large T antigen (Applied Biological Materials Inc.) containing 10% normal goat serum followed by goat anti-mouse-AF594 labelled antibodies (Molecular Probes), each for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. nuclei stained and slides mounted as described above. primary cells of three cats were inoculated at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1. monolayers of continuous ileocyte and colonocyte cultures were inoculated. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at RT.

Viral RNA was extracted from the faecal suspensions with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) cDNA was generated using SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) the nucleospin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used for purification of the PCR products. a part of the cells started to degenerate from 7 days post seeding. however, most of the cells could be kept for another week. ileum and colon cultures were always infected at 4 days post isolation. the vimentin positive mesenchymal cells had expanded in between the epithelial clusters, occupying around 50% of the wells. some of the ileum epithelial cells did also express vimentin, resembling dedifferentiated epithelial cells typically found after injury or in tumours. however, the antigen expression kinetics differed greatly between the avirulent FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 and the virulent FCoV the transduced cells started to proliferate from 1 week after transduction onwards. they formed layers of cobblestone-like cells with a cell diameter of 20\u201325 m and 30\u201335 m for ileocytes and colonocytes respectively. the epithelial character was confirmed by the expression of cytokeratin and dome formation in the cultures. FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 significantly infected both ileocytes as colonocytes more efficiently than WSU 79\u20131146. at 24 h pi, FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 had infected 19.46 4.37% and 18.47 4.61% of the colonocytes and ileocytes respectively. all but two samples collected from healthy cats were positive for coronavirus. qPCR titres ranged from 104.18 to 109.06 viral copies / g faeces. infectious virus was detected by IPMA in 50% of positive samples (8/16) UG-FH1 Faeces healthy cats 6.03 - UG-FH2 Faeces healthy cats 6.64 2.67 UG-FH3 Faeces healthy cats 5.51 - UG-FH4 Faeces healthy cats 5.41 2.36 UG-FH5 Faeces healthy cats 7.22 2.50 UG-FH6 Faeces healthy cats 6.88 - UG-FH7 Faeces healthy cat 6.88 - UG-FH7 Fae two faecal strains, FECV UCD and UG-FH8, were further propagated in colonocyte cultures. after 3 passages, both strains were raised in titre with around 3 log10 TCID50 / mL. ORF3 and ORF7 from each of the third passage strains were sequenced to check for signs of cell culture adaption. primary ileum cultures were always \u201ccontaminated\u201d with a lot of elongated or stellate-like cells, present in between the epithelial foci. colon cultures were always \u201ccontaminated\u201d with a lot of elongated or stellate-like cells, present in between the epithelial foci. in the colonic cultures, the epithelial cells showed a confined proliferation within 3\u20134 days post seeding. immunostainings against cytokeratin (red) and vimentin (green) filaments confirm epithelial nature of polygonal, cobblestone-like cells. at 4 days post isolation, the majority of the cells (> 90%) in the colon cultures was still of epithelial origin. expression kinetics of viral antigens in FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 and WSU 79-1146-infected primary ileocytes and colon cells were inoculated with FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 or FCoV WSU 79\u20131146 at a moi = 1. at different time points post inoculation, cytoplasmically expressed viral proteins were visualized and the percentage of infected epithelial cells was determined. both SV40 large T-antigen and hTERT expression was detected in these cultures. FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 significantly infected both ileocytes as colonocytes more efficiently than WSU 79\u20131146. at 24 h pi, FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 had infected 19.46 4.37% and 18.47 4.61% of the colonocytes and ileocytes. infected cells were inoculated with FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 or FCoV WSU 79\u20131146 at a moi = 1. at different time points post inoculation, the percentage of infected cells was determined. data are expressed as the means standard deviation of the results of 3 separate experiments. 3 tissue samples (UG-TF5, UG-TF9 and UG-TF17) did contain enterotropic virus. no infectious virus was found in faecal suspensions of FIP cat 1 (UG-FF1). UG-FF1 Faeces FIP cat 1 7.57 - UG-FF2 Faeces FIP cat 2 9.16 3.50 - UG-FF4 Faeces FIP cat 4 3.98 - UG-TF5 Omentum FIP cat 2 6.87 - UG-TF9 Spleen FIP cat 3 5.83 - UG-TF17 Omentum FIP cat 4 8.00 - Propagation and titration of FECV UCD and infected colonocytes 3 days pi with (A) 102.99 TCID50 FECV UCD and (B) 102.67 TCID50 UG-FH8. intestinal epithelial cells are important target cells in FCoV pathogenesis. vimentin filaments are often found in injured epithelial cells, tumours and in primary cultures due to the detachment of the cells from their natural environment during isolation. only a minority of the cells did express vimentin, suggesting that most cells were able to restore their differentiation with the used culture conditions. avirulent WSU 79\u20131683 efficiently infected and replicated in intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in exactly opposing kinetics as were found for macrophages. long-term cultures were derived from both primary ileocytes and colonocytes by SV40 T-antigen- and hTERT-induced immortalization. enterotropic virus was found in 57% of all FCoV-positive faecal samples originating from healthy cats in 3 geographically distinct multi-cat environments. one of those samples was detected only by immunofluorescence staining. this higher sensitivity can be explained by the use of more inoculum in that test. enterotropic virus was found in the faeces of FIP cat 1 (UG-FF1). however, accessory proteins of the virus in faecal and tissue suspensions of that cat were sequenced. as in all faecally shed FCoVs sequenced so far, the faecal strain carried an intact 3c gene. this strain showed only 96% and 89% homology with the tissue strain based on 7a and 7b protein respectively. alterations in the 7b protein can be a sign for cell culture adaptation as seen in many of the cell culture propagated serotype I FIPVs. in present study, no such signs of cell culture adaptation were detected for both 3th passage strains, which still carried intact ORF7 genes identical to the original faecal strains. DAJO participated in cell characterization and immortalization. AD helped in the design of real time RT-PCR procedures. IDMR contributed in sequencing studies."}
