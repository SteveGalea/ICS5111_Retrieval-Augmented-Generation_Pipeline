{"summary": "all mouse experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals approved by the State Council of People\u2019s Republic of China. cells The B6-derived dendritic cell (DC) line DC2.4 [17] was a gift from Dr. K. Rock (University of Massachussetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA) cell monolayers were overlaid with agar medium and incubated at 37\u00b0 C for 48-72 h. the plates were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 h and then the agarose overlays were carefully removed. staining buffer was added to the wells and incubated for at least 10 min. cells were resuspended in 35% Percoll solution (in D-Hank\u2019s buffer) and centrifuged at 830 x g for 15 min at room temperature. the upper liquid phase was removed from the tube; the lymphocyte pellet was resuspended in 0.84% NH4Cl solution to lyse the RBCs and then washed twice with PBS containing 2 % FBS. cells were stained with surface molecules, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular cytokines. antibodies were used: anti-CD3 (145-2C11), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-IFN- (XMG1.2), anti-CD11c (N418, all from Sungene Biotech); anti-Gr1 (RB6-8C5), anti-F4/80 (BM8, tccatcatgaacaa-3\u2032 5\u2032-agagggctgtgtggagaa-3\u2032 18 Ifna-non4 5\u2032-ARSYtgtStgatgcaRcaggt-3\u2032 5\u2032-ggWacacagtgatctgtgtgg-3\u2032 76 Ifng 5\u2032-atctggatataatcagga-3\u2032 5\u2032-ccaggtagctatgaa-3\u2032 6 Tnf histological sections were examined using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope equipped with an AxioCam HRc camera. all statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test or two-way ANOVA test as applicable. data are displayed as mean + SD. adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) strain was propagated in the chorio-allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs for 48-72 h at 37\u00b0 C. titers were determined by plaque assays on MDCK cells as previously described. yde hydrate (375 mg/kg body weight) was inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 1103 pfu PR8 in 20 l sterile PBS. mice with weight loss >25% of the original body weight were euthanized. mice with weight loss >25% of the original body weight were recorded dead. 2106 lymphocytes were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 96-well plates. brefeldin A was added to block the secretory pathway and allow for the accumulation of IFN- inside the cells. 2 h later, the cells were stained with surface molecules. quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 (Roche) the cycling conditions for RT-PCR were 95\u00b0 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0 C for 10 s, 60\u00b0 C for 30 s and 72\u00b0 C for 1 s. c-3\u2032 5\u2032-cctgcttcaccaccttcttg-3\u2032 80 Cytokine and chemokine levels were measured using a mouse Cytokine Magnetic 20-Plex Panel (Invitrogen) kit or a mouse inflammation panel mix and match subpanel kit (BioLegend) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions,. pulmonary homogenates were prepared. young and aged mice exhibited different morbidity and mortality post PR8 infection. weight loss (A), survival (B) and viral titers (C) were monitored. young and aged mice infected with 104 pfu of PR8. aged mice showed a reduced weight loss and higher survival rate compared to young mice. aged mice infected i.n. with 1103 pfu PR8 virus. the percentage and number of IFN-+ NK cells and CD107a+ NK cells in total NK cells are representative of at least five similar experiments. data are representative of at least five similar experiments. young and aged mice were infected i.n. with 1103 PFU PR8 virus. cells were firstly gated on myeloid cells. cells were firstly gated on myeloid cells. number of IFN-+CD4+ T cells showed a similar pattern. decreased T cell responses in the aged mice after infection. young and aged mice were infected with 1103 PFU PR8 virus. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the aged mice exhibited a delayed and decreased kinetics compared with the young mice. cytokines and chemokines activate and recruit leukocytes into the lungs and airways. PR8 infection in young mice resulted in significantly increased levels of cytokines. but in aged mice, the cytokine levels were lower after infection. this was consistent with the results of Q-PCR. leukocytes infiltration reached peak in young mice on 7 dpi. in most severe areas, leukocytes were full of the lung tissue. leukocytes infiltration reached peak in young mice on 7 dpi. pulmonary homogenates were prepared to measure levels of inflammatory cytokines. data are representative of two experiments (two to three mice per group in each experiment) aged mice are more resistant to PR8 infection compared with young mice. young and aged mice were infected with 103 pfu PR8 virus. aged mice are more resistant to PR8 infection compared with young mice. on 10 dpi, the virus titer in the lung of the aged mice was significantly lower than that of the young mice. at 15dpi, most of the viruses were cleared in both the aged mice and young mice. we infected the young and aged mice with 104 pfu of PR8. young (n=39) and aged (n=15) B6 mice were infected i.n. with 1103 PFU PR8 virus. percentage and number of total NK cells in the lung of uninfected and infected young and aged mice. the percentage of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and DC cells decreased in the young mice after infection. however, the percentage of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and DC cells all remained largely unchanged at 3 dpi in the lungs of the aged mice. CD4+ T cell responses in the young mice reached peak on 7 dpi. the percentage of IFN-+ CD4+ T cells produced IFN-. after that, the percentage of activated CD4+ T cells went down. the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells increased slowly and reached peak on 16 dpi in the aged mice. overall, there was significantly reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the aged mice. we first determined the cytokine levels in the young and aged mice by quantitative real-time PCR. transcripts of several cytokines, such as Ifna4, Ifna-non-4, Ifnb1, Ifng, Tfna, and Il6 increased significantly in the lung of the young mice. but in the aged mice, transcripts of the other cytokines did not show significant increase after infection. the early increase of multiply cytokines and chemokines in the young mice was likely to recruit more leukocytes infiltrating to the infected lung. this results were consistent with the faster and stronger T cell responses in the young mice compared to the aged mice. hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) of the lung sectins in the young and aged mice at indicated time points. fold of lymphocytes increase in lung, compared with uninfected mice. pulmonary homogenates prepared to measure levels of inflammatory cytokines. cytokine and chemokine were all decreased in young and aged mice. delayed and decreased lymphocytes infiltration and alleviated lung pathology in the aged mice. reduced inflammation cytokines and lower strength of NK and T cell immune responses in the aged mice might contribute to alleviated lung pathology. early inflammatory cytokines, lung pathology, neutrophils infilitration, and overall NK cell responses in the early infection were significantly lower than the young mice on 3 dpi. NF-kB activation is a hallmark of inflammatory and antiviral responses mediated especially by type I interferons that block viral replication. previous studies showed that active NF-kB signaling is required for effective influenza virus infection. compared to that in the young mice on 7 dpi (17.300.9212 in the aged mice on 16 dpi compared to 24.772.117 in the young mice on 7 dpi) the delayed and milder T cell responses in the aged mice were still capable to finally clear the virus. CD8+ T cells are partly responsible for the pathogenesis of acute pneumonia caused by influenza A virus. the alveolar macrophages decreased in the lung of young mice on 3 dpi. this was consistent with a previous report that more than 90% of resident alveolar macrophages were deleted in the first week after influenza infection. ageing is a continuum of changes that are progressive with time. from young to ageing, there is a gradual decline in immune functions with ageing. the moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing balance the immune pathology and viral clearance. age factors should be considered when investigating the vaccination and therapeutic strategies for severe IAV infection."}
