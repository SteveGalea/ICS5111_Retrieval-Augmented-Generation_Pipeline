{"summary": "17 human cases of infection with the newly emerged highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) virus have been identified in china. the epidemiologic characteristics of laboratory-confirmed H5N6 cases were compared to A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) cases in mainland China. we collected detailed epidemiological information on laboratory-confirmed H5N6, H7N9, and H5N1 cases reported as of 30 November 2016. we used data on age, sex, place of residence, symptoms at illness onset, and underlying medical disorders associated with an increased risk of seasonal influenza complications. recent exposure history to poultry including at live poultry markets and backyard poultry during the ten days prior to illness onset were recorded through an interview with the patient or the relative of a patient. the national influenza-like illness sentinel surveillance network covers around 1% of outpatient consultations. we estimated the risk of admission to intensive care unit, the risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, and the risk of death. the funding bodies had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript. analysis of human cases of H5N6, H7N9, and H5N1 virus infections was part of an ongoing public health investigation. we compared alternative parametric distributions, including gamma, weibull, and lognormal distributions. we compared the severity of H5N6, H5N1 and H7N9 cases based on the risk of severe outcomes in hospitalized cases. the funding bodies had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript. there were 17 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N6 compared to 45 H5N1 cases and 782 H7N9 cases reported in mainland China. the geographic distribution of H5N6, H5N1 and H7N9 cases has been identified in south and southwest china. the incidence rate of H7N9 cases has been higher in eastern and southern china, where the density of live poultry markets is also highest. a wide range of duration from hospital admission to death was observed in confirmed cases of infections with the 3 viruses. Approximately 88% of H5N6 cases and 73% of H7N9 cases received antiviral treatment. the time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was shorter for H5N6 cases. curves are constructed as smoothed versions of the histograms from raw data. A, Days from illness onset to hospital admission. B, Days from illness onset to laboratory confirmation of infection. sporadic occurrence of human H5N6 cases across southern china is consistent with the areas of highest poultry density. poultry density is also high in eastern China around the Yangtze River delta where H5N6 cases have not yet been reported in the current outbreak. one of the 17 H5N6 cases was detected through the influenza-like illness sentinel surveillance network [28]. the number of confirmed human H5N6 cases is likely to be an underestimate of all human H5N6 virus infections that have occurred. the first 17 laboratory-confirmed human infections with HPAI A(H5N6) virus in china were characterized by severe illness among the 16 hospitalized cases. it remains to be seen whether HPAI A(H5N6) virus will continue to circulate among poultry and cause sporadic human infections in coming years."}
