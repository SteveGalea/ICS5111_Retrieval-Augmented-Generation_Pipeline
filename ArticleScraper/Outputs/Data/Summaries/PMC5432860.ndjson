{"summary": "the subfamily Coronavirinae contains four genera, but only alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans. low-pathogenic species are estimated to be responsible for up to 30% of all respiratory tract infections, causing severe disease mostly in infants, young children, and elderly and immunocompromised individuals. HCoV-NL63 has existed in human populations for at least the last 30 years. molecular dating suggests that it diverged with HCoV-229E from the most recent common ancestor roughly a thousand years ago. annually, 1 to 10% of the population suffers from upper or lower respiratory tract infection with HCoV-NL63. the structure of the N protein remains poorly defined. the structural basis of the interaction between nucleic acid and RNA remains poorly defined. a model of the interaction of the NTD with RNA is presented. HCoV-NL63 protein was obtained in an Escherichia coli expression system. the full-length protein was either entirely stable or rapidly degraded into short peptides. both domains were obtained with high efficiency (30 mg/liter of culture) and purified to homogeneity. asymmetric unit contains two NTD molecules encompassing residues 9 to 140 and 10 to 140 for molecules A and B. each molecule is well defined by electron density except for a single partially unstructured, solvent-exposed loop (Arg65-Gln68) I/I 16.1 (7.4) 15.3 (3.0) Completeness (%) 99.1 (99.5) 100 (100) Redundancy 2.9 (2.9)

B-factors Protein 21 variation at the level of primary sequence, the overall fold of alphacoronavirus NTD is similar to those of previously determined NTD structures from beta- and gammacoronaviruses. the fold consists of a five-stranded, antiparallel -sheet with the topology 4-2-3-1-5 (Fig. 2B) the largest differences in the main-chain arrangement are in the N-terminal part immediately C terminal to the 1 strand. two NL63 NTD monomers in the asymmetric unit are arranged in an entwining dimer characterized by a pseudo-2-fold rotational symmetry. the central part of the dimer is composed of a large, solvent-filled cavity. the protruding finger-like -hairpins of each monomer are located around 13 from each other. chromatography in which recombinant NTD was eluted as a monomer (32) this conclusion is corroborated by crystal structures of NTDs derived from other coronaviruses that do not exhibit comparable dimerization (30, 33, 34) the electrostatic potential surface of the NL63 NTD contains a large, positively charged groove where the N terminus and 2-3 finger protrude from the globular part of the molecule. the NL63 NTD structure we solved in this study was not compatible with this nucleotide-binding mode. however, detailed analysis excluded the possibility that the NTD binds RNA in a manner similar to that of U1A. no other experimental structures of proteins homologous to NTDs from coronaviruses have been determined to date. sulfate ions chemically resemble phosphate moieties present within the structure of RNA. interactions of the sulfate ions were used to guide those of the ribose hydroxyls within the nucleic acid. two successive phosphate moieties form salt bridges with positively charged residues. the third nucleotide does not form any interactions with the NTD. the fourth nucleotide is located roughly at the binding pocket previously characterized in OC43 (35) our model does not extend to the palm of the NL63 NTD. no sulfate ions were present in that region to guide modeling. we tested the mode of interaction of the NTD with nucleic acid predicted by our model. affinities were determined by fluorescence polarization (FP) and microscale thermophoresis. affinities of the tested double mutants were lower than the affinities of the respective single mutants, further supporting the predictions of our model. previous work showed that intrinsically disordered regions within N protein and its CTD significantly contribute to affinity. however, the disordered and ordered regions are involved in self-assembly of the N protein/RNA complex into higher-order quaternary structures. the entire interaction remains poorly understood but several explanatory models have been proposed. crystal structure of the CTD of HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. -Strands are depicted in pink, helices in red, and loops in blue. color coding is as in panel A. ecular interactions suggest that the NL63 CTD exists as a dimer in solution. this is corroborated by our previous biochemical characterization showing that the CTD exists as a dimer in solution. however, the basic organizational unit within the nucleocapsid is the N protein dimer, rather than the monomer, consistent with data obtained previously for different coronaviruses. the intermolecular -sheet is longer in the NL63 CTD and IBV CTD (40) than in the corresponding structure of the SARS-CoV CTD dimer (10 hydrogen bonds) the overall fold of the CTD also resembles that of the nucleocapsid protein of arterivirus, a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. this suggests analogies in nucleocapsid formation. and CTD-expressing constructs were designed based on sequence analysis and the available literature. both domains were obtained with high efficiency (30 mg/liter of culture) and purified to homogeneity. the NTD crystallized readily, but we failed to obtain CTD crystals from the initial construct. each monomer has a palm-like shape with a single protruding finger. the finger is composed of a long -hairpin with a partially unstructured loop connecting the strands. the other side of the hairpin is embedded in the center of the globular part of the molecule. 2.53 2.40

helices in red, and loops in blue. a short -helix encompassing residues Ala32 and Ile37 is characteristic of the NL63 NTD but is not present in any of the structures of beta- or gammacoronaviruses determined to date. the second region of significant structural variation is located within the protruding finger motif (Gln52-Leu81) the two NL63 NTD monomers in the asymmetric unit are arranged in an entwining dimer characterized by a pseudo-2-fold rotational symmetry. the interaction surface within the globular part of each monomer is slightly concave; therefore, direct contacts between monomers are relatively few in number. the central part of the dimer is composed of a large, solvent-filled cavity and tightly coordinated water molecules mediate the majority of intermolecular interactions. the structure coordinates several sulfate ions derived from the crystallization buffer. the first sulfate ions are located in the middle part of a finger-like 2-3 hairpin. the second sulfate ion is coordinated by the side chains of Arg61 and Arg63. proline side chain sterically occludes the site equivalent to the site of the phosphate group in the HCoV-OC43 NTD structure. differences between coronaviruses in the mode of interaction of NTDs with nucleic acid were also suggested by a previous analysis. a library of low-energy RNA structures was generated and docked to the structure of the NTD. best solutions were energy minimized and inspected for clashes and geometry problems. the model characterized by the lowest potential energy within which the RNA molecule could be easily extended from both ends was chosen as the optimal representative of the NL63 NTD-RNA interaction. se moiety of the nucleotide forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of His77. its phosphate moiety forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Arg116. this suggests the overall capability of this region to interact with nucleic acid is conserved. the NL63 NTD has little or no specificity for specific sequences. affinities were determined by fluorescence polarization (FP) and microscale thermophoresis. affinities were determined by fluorescence polarization and microscale thermophoresis. affinities of the tested double mutants were lower than the affinities of the respective single mutants, further supporting the predictions of our model. the results described above are consistent with prior mutagenesis data obtained for beta- and gammacoronavirus NTDs. residues equivalent to positions 61, 63, and 77 in NL63 were experimentally demonstrated to participate in the nucleic acid interaction. the crystal structure of the NL63 nucleocapsid protein was solved at a resolution of 1.5 in the P61 space group. the final model contains residues 228 to 331 (molecule A) and 228 to 337 (molecule B) and was refined to Rfactor/Rfree of 16.9%/19.8%. each monomer in the asymmetric unit inserts its -hairpin arm into the concavity within the second monomer. this arrangement generates the pseudo-2-fold rotational symmetry that characterizes the dimer and creates a four-stranded, antiparallel -sheet at its core. the dimer has a flat, roughly square shape with approximate dimensions of 38 by 38 by 25. the NL63 CTD dimer superposes with the CTD dimers of SARS-CoV and IBV with RMSD of 2.2 and 2.7. however, detailed analysis of the intermonomer interactions within the dimer revealed a single notable difference between the alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. nucleocapsid protein of arterivirus, a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, suggests analogies in nucleocapsid formation. the proposed model of RNA binding provides structural insight into the initial steps of N protein interaction with nucleic acid, as well as N protein dimerization, within the alphacoronavirus family. the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0] containing 0.25 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 20% glycerol. the protein of interest was recovered using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC Sepharose; GE Healthcare) crystallization screening was performed at 22\u00b0C using the sitting drop vapor-diffusion method. data were indexed and integrated using XDS software (43). Molecular replacement was performed with Phaser software (46), using the infectious bronchitis virus NTD structure (PDB) and SARS virus CTD structure (PDB code 2CJR) as search models. protein oligomerization status was determined by gel filtration on a precalibrated Superdex 75 gel filtration column. NL63 N, NTD, and CTD constructs were probed for unstructured regions. fragments of HCoV-NL63 N protein (Uniprot Q6Q1R8) were designed based on sequence comparisons. mutants were amplified by PCR from viral cDNA and cloned into vector pETDuet-1. mutants were encoding six histidine-tagged fusion proteins. the best crystals were obtained from 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) containing 2 M ammonium sulfate (NTD) and 0.1 M PCTP buffer (pH 8.0; PCTP buffer contains sodium propionate, sodium cacodylate trihydrate, and Bis-Tris propane) no additional cryoprotection was performed for CTD crystals. a custom Python script was used to align phosphate and/or hydroxyl groups within ribose moieties of the RNAs within the library. the protein-RNA complexes characterized by best alignment (RMSD) were energy minimized using GROMACS (51) with an AMBER force field (52) Models were scored according to potential energy and inspected for clashes and geometry problems using PHENIX (53). TD, and CTD constructs were probed for unstructured regions. staphopains A and B, YaT protease, papain, subtilisin, chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, papain, and preScission were incubated for 60 min at room temperature."}
