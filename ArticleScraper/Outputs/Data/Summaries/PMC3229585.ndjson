{"summary": "study examined changes in health status of china's adult population between 2003 and 2008 due to rapid economic growth and medical system improvement. results Chinese respondents in 2008 were more likely to report disease than in 2003. smoking slightly decreased among men and women, and regular exercise showed much improvement. a new type of rural cooperative medical care system was piloted in some counties in 2003. coverage rate reached 72.6% by December 2004 and would gradually cover all rural residents by 2010. urban resident basic health insurance scheme in china has covered all cities since 2008. the study provided important information for furthering research questions for future studies. 141,927 (M/F, 70,541/71,386) residents in 2003 and 136,371 (66,801/69,570) in 2008. 94 counties and cities were randomly selected from rural and urban areas. the survey response rate for adults was 83% in 2008 (77.8% in 2003) if there was missing information, probands could be re-surveyed the next day. a 5% sample of households was randomly selected and re-surveyed. two surveys were conducted in the same sampling areas. 94 counties and cities were randomly selected from rural and urban areas. the mainland of china was clustered according to the government administrative geographic system. a 5% sample of households was randomly selected and re-surveyed to examine survey quality by telephone or visit again. there was no age preference in the survey. a similarity coefficient and GINI concentration ratio indicated that family size in the survey was consistent with the established national picture. a difference in composition of some age groups between the two surveys was found between 2003 and 2008. more people in 2008 were divorce and widowed (1.5%, 7.5% vs. 1.1%, 6.6%) 15210 (21.3) 28514 (20.9) 30430 (21.4) 55\u201364 10877 (16.3) 8838 (12.5) 10731 (15.4) 8345 (11.7) 21608 (15.9) 17183 (12.1) 65 9725 (14.5) 8888 (12.6) 10411 (15.0) 9410 (13.2) 20136 (14.8) 18298 (12.9) Minority Han Chinese 57609 (86.2) 60835 (86.2) 59773 (85.9) 61390 residents in 2008, by sex and residence area, had higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and hypertension. presence of physician-diagnosed chronic disease in the last 6 months in 2008 was much higher than in 2003 (25.5% vs. 20.0%). atoid arthritis in 2008 was higher in rural area compared with in 2003 (1.5% vs. 1.1%) compared with in 2003 (1.5% vs. 1.1%) * Stroke 899 (1.4) 702 (1.0) * 799 (1.2) 574 (0.8) * 627 (1.6) 702 (1.6) 1071 (1.1) 574 (0.6) * 1698 (1.3) 1276 (0.9) * Chronic pulmonary disease 990 (1.5) 1174 (1.7) * 766 (1.1) 814 (1.1) 480 (1.2) 611 (1.5)* 1276 (1.3) 1377 (1.4)* 1756 (1.3) 1988 (1.4 compared with 2003, the proportion of current smokers in 2008 dropped from 27.7% to 26.3%. but the proportion of drank alcohol frequently was similar between 2008 and 2003. Stratified analyses showed significant subpopulation disparities in health status between 2003 and 2008. for male population presence of chronic disease rate ratios for 2008/2003 were higher among residents who were rural, aged >65 years, Han Chinese, unmarried, widowed, illiterate, and in eastern China. 1.00, 1.13) 1.24 (1.19, 1.29) 1.18 (1.14, 1.22) 55\u201364 1.16 (1.11, 1.21) 1.15 (1.10, 1.19) 1.09 (1.03, 1.14) 1.20 (1.16, 1.26) 1.15 (1.12, 1.19) 65 1.11 (1.07, 1.14) 1.18 (1.14, 1.21) 1.07 (1.03, 1.10) 1.25 (1.20, 1.29) 1.08 (1.06 rate ratios for 2008/2003 adjusted for sex (or residence area), age, minority, marital status, education, and geographic region. rural residents had higher chronic disease rate ratios for 2008/2003 than urban residents (1.20 vs. 1.05) urban residents in eastern china also had higher RR (1.18; 95%CI, 1.13\u20131.22) but presence of chronic disease in 2008 was not significantly different compared with 2003. prevalence of chronic disease of minority nationality in 2008 was lower than in 2003, especially in urban. 15220 (21.6) 14415 (20.7) 15210 (21.3) 28514 (20.9) 30430 (21.4) 55\u201364 10877 (16.3) 8838 (12.5) 10731 (15.4) 8345 (11.7) 21608 (15.9) 17183 (12.1) 65 9725 (14.5) 8888 (12.6) 10411 (15.0) 9410 (13.2) 20136 (14.8) 18298 (12.9) Minority Han Chinese 57609 (86.2) 60835 (8 both urban and rural had similar results. presence of physician-diagnosed chronic disease in 2008 was much higher than in 2003 (25.5% vs. 20.0%). prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in 2008 was higher in rural area compared with in 2003 (1.5% vs. 1.1%).
