{"summary": "RNA viruses are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and then trigger multiple signaling pathways to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines. the intensity and duration of the signaling are finely modulated at multiple steps of the signaling cascades. TRAF2, 3, 5 and 6 are all MAVS binding partners through different TIM. the complex provides the essential platform for downstream TBK1-dependent IRF3 or IRF7 activation. the regulation on the MAVS-TRAF3 signalosome may be very important. HACE1 modulates expression level of cyclin D1, then reducing cell cycle progression. in breast cancer, HACE1 ubiquitinates and promotes degradation of Rac1. in lung cancer, HACE1 ubiquitinates OPTN and targets it for autophagic degradation. ubiquitin E3 ligases were used for the dual reporter luciferase assay. in this study, we demonstrate that HACE1 contributes to negative regulation of the virus-induced type I IFN signaling via disrupting the MAVS-TRAF3 complex. pcDNA3-Flag-TBK1 was a gift from Takashi Fujita. pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase plasmid was from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) hIFNB1 was amplified using the following primers: IFNB1-F: 5\u2032-ATTGCCTCAAGGACAGGATG-3\u2032 and IFNB1-R: 5\u2032-GGCCTTCAGGTAATGCAGAA-3\u2032. the cells were infected with seV at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 or transfected with poly (I:C) for 24 h. luciferase activity was normalized based on HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids for 24 h. cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture. blot was probed with anti-HA Ab or control Ig. mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-GAPDH (BioWorld, Atlanta, GA, USA), anti-GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-GFP (Neobioscience, Shenzhen, China) were from the indicated manufacturers. cells were seeded on 24-well plates and transfected the next day using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China) with 100 ng ISRE luciferase reporter, or IFN- reporter and 1 ng pRL-SV40 plasmid. luciferase activity was normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity. all reporter assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. the amounts of hIFNB1 were amplified using the following primers: IFNB1-F: 5\u2032-ATTGCCTCAAGGACAGGATG-3\u2032 and IFNB1-R: 5\u2032-GGCCTTCAGGTAATGCAGAA-3\u2032. the cells were infected by VSV-GFP virus at MOI of 10. HACE1 negatively regulates virus-induced type I IFN signaling. overexpression of HACE1 inhibited seV-induced activation of ISRE and IFN- promoter in a dose-dependent manner. HEK293T cells were seeded on 24-well plates and transfected the next day with mock control or HACE1-expressing vector. twenty-four hours later, cells were left uninfected or infected with SeV. HEK293 cells were transfected with control or siRNA oligos against HACE1. knockdown of HACE1 augmented SeV-induced IFNB1 production. thirty-six hours later, cells were infected with VSV-GFP. HEK293T cells were coexpressed with Rac1 and increased amounts of HA-tagged WT HACE1 or HACE1/C876A expressing vector. luciferase assays showed that HACE1/C876A inhibited ISRE and IFN- promoter activation by transfected poly (I:C) HACE1 Negatively Regulates Virus-Triggered Signaling Downstream of MAVS and Upstream of TBK1 Upon viral infection, recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I induced a downstream signaling cascade. we next sought to determine a step within the signaling pathway that HACE1 targets. HACE1 modulated the virus-induced signaling downstream of MAVS and upstream of TBK1. unexpectedly, HACE1 cannot interact with either MAVS or TBK1. HEK293T cells were coexpressed with flag-tagged TRAF3. HEK293 cells were transfected with flag-MAVS and GFP-TRAF3 with increasing amount of HA-HACE1. the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody. it has been reported that the MAVS and TRAF3 complex is essential for virus-induced signaling. VSV is another representative RNA virus for RIG-I signaling studies. the replication of VSV was enhanced when HACE1 was overexpressed. these data together suggested that HACE1 negatively regulates virus-induced type I IFN signaling. HEK293 cells were transfected with control or siRNA oligos against HACE1. knockdown of HACE1 expression augmented seV-induced IFNB1 gene transcription. knockdown of HACE1 inhibited VSV replication. the catalytic cysteine (C876) of HACE1 is indispensable for its E3 ligase activity. we constructed a mutant in which the amino acid cysteine 876 was mutated into alanine. the mutant lost the ability to degrade Rac1, indicating the lost E3 ligase activity of HACE1/C876A. HEK293T cells were seeded on 24-well plates and were transfected with mock control, HACE1 or HACE1/C876A expressing vector, together with ISRE or IFN- reporter vector. twenty-four hours later, cells were infected with SeV or left uninfected for 24 h before luciferase assays were performed. HEK293T cells were seeded on 24-well plates and transfected the next day with indicated signaling molecules, IFN- or ISRE luciferase reporter and pRL-SV40 plasmid. luciferase activities were quantified by normalizing with Renilla luciferase activities. 93T cells were transfected with the mock control, Flag-tagged MAVS, Flag-tagged TRAF3 or HA-tagged TBK1 and HA-tagged HACE1. HEK293T cells were coexpressed with Flag-tagged TRAF3 and increasing amounts of HA-tagged HACE1. the cells were harvested and detected by Western blot. HACE1 suppressed virus-induced signaling independently of its E3 ligase activity. this is consistent with the data that HACE1 negatively regulates the virus-induced signaling independent of the E3 ligase activity. in-like protease binds and disrupts the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex. some studies reported endogenous physiological negative regulators that target TRAF3 or the MAVS-TRAF3 complex. LUBAC downregulates virus-mediated IFN induction by targeting NEMO for linear ubiquitination. HACE1 is dependent on the complete TRAF interaction motif. further studies will focus on the link of the spontaneous mutation of HACE1 with inflammation or tumor development."}
