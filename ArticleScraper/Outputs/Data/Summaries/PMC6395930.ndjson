{"summary": "B19V is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus belonging to the genus Erythroparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae (2). B19V exhibits a remarkable tropism for human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) in the bone marrow and fetal liver (3\u20137). the left side of the RF genome encodes a large nonstructural protein (NS1) and a small nonstructural 7.5-kDa protein. the right side of the genome encodes two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2), along with a small nonstructural 11-kDa protein, encoded using a different open reading frame (23). NS1 predominantly localizes in the nucleus of infected cells. NS1N has NS1 (aa 1 to 176), and NS1NmEndo has alanine substitutions in the endonuclease motif (aa 140 to 143) (20). the C-terminal region contains a transactivation domain 2 (TAD2; 523SSFFNLITP531) (20). NLS, nuclear localization signal. (B and C) Purification of NS1N and NS1NmEndo proteins. the ssDNA genome uses the 3\u2032-end hairpin as a self-primer (3\u2032OH) to extend viral ssDNA into the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome by cellular replication proteins (40), a step called first-strand DNA synthesis (39). the extended 3\u2032 end is presumably ligated to the 5\u2032 end of the genome to form a partial circular DNA genome. ssDNA is finally packaged into the capsid. fluorophore-based nicking assay recapitulates the same sensitivity and specificity found in the radioactive assay. 8 compounds inhibited NS1 nicking activity by over 80%. of these 8 compounds, 3 compounds also inhibited viral DNA replication in B19V RF DNA-transfected UT7/Epo-S1 cells. ori30mut was incubated with NS1N or NS1NmEndo in the nicking buffer. 32P-labeled Ori30 oligonucleotide (2 nM) was incubated with NS1N at a final concentration of 0.1, 0.5, 2, or 4 M in the nicking buffer. NS1N has been proved to bind the minimal replication origin (Ori) nt is a template for cleavage because the NS1-binding elements (NS1BEs) are not required for nicking of the ssDNA Ori under the conditions of the in vitro nicking assay. NS1N cleaved Ori30 at 19 nt, while NS1N did not cleave the trs mutant, Ori30mut. small-molecule compounds inhibit cleavage of the ssDNA Ori by NS1N. 96 small-molecule compounds at 100 M (A) or the chosen 25 compounds at 10 M (B) were incubated with 32P-labeled Ori30 and NS1N in the nicking buffer. the reaction mixtures were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. the ratio of signals at 19 nt versus those at 19 nt plus 30 nt in the DMSO vehicle control group is set equal to 1. the nicking efficiency for compounds that inhibited all nicking activity is shown as a blank, as no obvious nicked bands were detected at 19 nt. FAMOri20Q (200 nM) was incubated with 2 M NS1N protein in the nicking buffer. fluorescence intensity was determined with or without NS1N. 71 compounds (at 10 M) did not show inhibition at 100 M by the radioactive assay. we set up a cutoff value of 80% inhibition, as in the radioactive assay. none of the 71 compounds showed an inhibition of >80% at 10 M. 1N nicking of the 32P-labeled Ori30 and 8 compounds were positive for the NS1N nicking of the FAM-labeled Ori20 (in green) the correlation coefficient between the radioactive and fluorescent nicking assays was calculated using SPSS software. the scatter plot, trend line, and R2 value for the two assays were calculated using SPSS software. B19V infects UT7/Epo-S1 cells poorly (41, 49), electroporation using nucleofector (Lonza) directly delivers the viral double-stranded RF DNA into the nucleus, where the RF DNA is nicked by NS1 to initiate viral DNA replication. at 2 days postelectroporation, cells were collected for flow cytometry using an anti-B19V capsid antibody to select capsid-expressing cells UT7/Epo-S1 cells were transfected with B19V duplex genome M20. each inhibitor was added at different concentrations, as indicated. compounds 7, 135, and 201 inhibited at least half of the level of the RF DNA. u7/Epo-S1 cells without transfection were set up as mock-transfected controls. pM20 digested with SalI was loaded as a size marker (lanes M) mitochondrial DNA was detected as a loading control. compound 7 at 40 M, there were >95% living cells, whereas B19V infection was inhibited at an efficiency of >60%. for compound 201, at 40 M, there were >80% living cells, whereas B19V infection was inhibited at an efficiency of 50%. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. CD36+ EPCs without infection were set up as mock-infected cells. compound 7 had a relatively effective EC50 of 6.4 M at 18 h postinfection. compounds 7, 135, and 201 inhibited B19V DNA replication in CD36+ EPCs at 18 h, 30 h, and 48 h postinfection. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. purified NS1N and NS1NmEndo, which have alanine substitutions in the endonuclease motif. purified NS1N and NS1NmEndo showed a purity of >90%. we used a short version of the B19V ssDNA from the Ori (Ori30) which is 30 nt, as a template for cleavage. NS1N was capable of cleaving ori30 at trs and released a band of 19 nt. but the NS1NmEndo did not. at 2 M NS1N, greater than 70% of the probe was cleaved. 96 small-molecule compounds at 100 M (A) or the chosen 25 compounds at 10 M (B) were incubated with 32P-labeled Ori30 and NS1N in the nicking buffer. the reaction mixtures were analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel. the relative nicking efficiencies are shown beneath the gels. orophore via F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) did not show significant fluorescence. the intact FAMOri20Q showed a >20-fold difference in fluorescence intensity with and without NS1N. we further tested the optimal concentration of the oligomer. FAMOri20Q (200 nM) was incubated with 2 M NS1N protein in the nicking buffer. fluorescence intensity of each sample was detected on a microplate reader. fluorescence intensity was determined with or without NS1N. each of the 71 compounds was incubated with NS1N at 10 M in the nicking buffer at 37\u00b0C for 16 to 18 h. the fluorescence intensity of each sample was detected on a microplate reader. we set up inhibition of 80% of the relative fluorescence intensity. we first determined the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the three flavonoids compounds, compounds 7, 135, and 201, which were 3.1 0.8 M, 2.9 0.8 M, and 1.1 0.4 M respectively. for a direct result of inhibition of viral DNA replication, we tested them in UT7/Epo-S1 cells electroporated with RF DNA. the IC50 of each inhibitor was calculated using GraphPad Prism software. the half-maximal (50%) effective concentration (EC50) for B19V replication inhibition was calculated by comparison with the results for the vehicle control (DMSO) the percentage of viable cells were determined using a CytoTox-Glo cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega), and the CC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism software. compounds 7, 135, and 201 inhibited at least half of the level of the RF DNA. these results suggest that the inhibition of B19V replication is likely due to the inhibition of viral DNA replication. cells were infected with B19V-infected plasma at 48 h postinfection. each compound was added at different concentrations, as shown. at 2 days postinfection, the cells were collected for determining B19V infection by flow cytometry. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. the final EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism software. at 2 days postinfection, the percentages of viable cells were determined. compound 7 had EC50 values of 6.43 0.12 M, 20.84 0.88 M, and 20.5 3.17 M at 18 h, 30 h, and 48 h postinfection, respectively. compound 135 had EC50 values of 20.47 1.11 M, 31.28 1.95 M, and 38.35 4.68 M at 18 h, 30 h, and 48 h postinfection, respectively. compound 201 had EC50 values of 20.47 1.11 M, EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism software. compounds 7, 135, and 201 inhibited B19V infection and DNA replication in CD36+ EPCs at a concentration that does not significantly kill cells. the clinical manifestations are due to the direct cytotoxicity of the virus infection. small-molecule compounds that can specifically inhibit B19V replication in ex vivo-expanded CD36+ EPCs will be ideal candidates for testing as drugs for the treatment of hematological disorders caused by B19V infection. 96 small-molecule compounds have been used to screen inhibitors of the RNase H nuclease activity of the HBV polymerase. flavonoids can inhibit viral protease activity (74, 75), viral helicase activity (76, 77), and viral (HIV) reverse transcriptase (78, 79). flavonoids inhibited B19V infection, determined by assessment of viral capsid expression. an important contribution of this study is the establishment of a fluorescent in vitro nicking assay. we have identified the 67-nt Ori that supports B19V DNA replication in B19V-permisive UT7/Epo-S1 cells (41) and characterized the NS1BEs of the Ori in vitro. based nicking assay possesses the same sensitivity and specificity for detection of inhibition of NS1N cleavage of the Ori as the radioactive nicking assay. the two assays exhibited a good correlation and minimal difference in detection of the NS1N-effected nicking of the B19V Ori. cells were thawed and cultured for 2 to 3 days in Wong expansion medium (88) under normoxic conditions. cells expressed CD36+ (a marker for erythroid cells) for 2 days. cells were infected with B19V at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1,000 vgc. two million UT7/Epo-S1 cells were electroporated with 3 g of SalI-linearized pM20 (48) in solution V using the Amaxa Nucleofector technology. after electroporation, the cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions for 2 days. the labeled oligonucleotide was 5\u2032 end labeled with [-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer, Inc.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) the labeled oligonucleotide was purified using microSpin G-50 columns (GE Healthcare) ucleotides were synthesized with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032 end and Iowa Black FQ quencher at the 3\u2032 end. the labeled oligonucleotide was diluted to 100 M as a stock solution. the in vitro nicking reaction mixture was set up at 60 l. transfected cells were diluted with medium to 0.4 million cells/ml. 1 ml was transferred to 12-well plates, followed by addition of compound at various concentrations. final EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism software.
