{"summary": "chloroquine treatment prevented liver injury in the early reperfusion phase, but worsened at late phase following hepatic ischemic injury. alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were administered to rats 1 h before warm ischemia followed by a daily injection for up to 2 days. hepatocellular necrosis, cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes and sinusoidal dilation were observed 6 h after reperfusion in vehicle-treated rats. chloroquine-treated rats showed more severe cytoplasmic vacuolization and hepatocellular necrosis 24 h after reperfusion compared with vehicle-treated rats. ine-treated rats showed minimal increases in hepatic TNF-, IL-6, IL-1 and iNOS mRNA levels compared with vehicle-injected animals. Chloroquine treatment decreased liver expression of inflammatory mediators at early phase following I/R injury. chloroquine-treated rats showed lower serum HMGB1 levels. the serum levels of HMGB1 were drastically decreased following reperfusion, to 1.400.41, 1.280.45 ng/ml at 0.5 and 6 h, respectively. phosphorylation of p38 was increased at 0.5 h, decreased at 6 h and then recovered thereafter. treatment with chloroquine did not affect total cellular levels of JNK, p38 and ERK. these data suggest that chloroquine could act upstream of MAP kinase activation. chloroquine treatment increased LC3-II and p62 expression in response to liver I/R injury. results indicated chloroquine inhibited hepatic post-ischemic autophagy. chloroquine treatment increased hepatic apoptosis following I/R injury. rats were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg) 1 h before warm ischemia followed by an additional chloroquine injections at 24 h after reperfusion. rats were pre-treated with either chloroquine (60 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) 1 h before warm ischemia. followed by an additional chloroquine injections at 24 h after reperfusion. liver injury was assessed at various time points following reperfusion. hepatic inflammatory cytokines gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR. expression of hepatic mRNA for TNF-, IL-6, IL-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was increased at 0.5 and 6 h. but chloroquine-treated rats showed minimal increases in hepatic TNF-, IL-6, IL-1 and iNOS mRNA levels compared with vehicle-injected animals nuclear HMGB1 staining in hepatocytes was substantial loss in vehicle-injected control rats as early as 0.5 h after reperfusion. serum HMGB1 concentration was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) HMGB1-release into serum was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) chloroquine treatment modulates liver I/R-induced inflammatory signaling pathways. phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p38) and p38 was increased. treatment with chloroquine did not affect total cellular levels of JNK, p38 and ERK. chloroquine treatment decreased autophagy in a number of cell types. western blots were performed for microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 on livers obtained from rats pre-treated with either chloroquine or vehicle. sham-operated rats had low levels of LC3-II. caspase-3 and caspase-7 cleavage increased in response to liver I/R. chloroquine treatment increased liver I/R-induced caspase-3 cleavage. chloroquine treatment increased hepatic apoptosis following reperfusion. chloroquine treatment reduced liver injury at 0.5 and 6 h, but aggravated liver injury at 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. chloroquine treatment was associated with a modulation of MAP kinase activation, inhibition of HMGB1 release and reduction of inflammatory cytokine production. HMGB1 was present in the nucleus of hepatocytes in normal livers. treatment with a neutralizing antibody to HMGB1 reduced hepatic HMGB1 translocation and serum levels in the early phase of reperfusion. the inhibition of hepatic HMGB1 translocation and subsequent release is involved in the hepatoprotective effect of chloroquine. autophagy is a highly conserved regulated cellular process by which cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles, are broken down and are recycled through the lysosomal degradation pathway. a homologue of yeast Atg8, exists in two forms, LC3-I and its proteolytic derivative LC3-II. LC3-II localizes on the isolation membrane and the autophagic membrane. chloroquine has been used to inhibit autophagy in vivo without noticeable side effects. in this study, chloroquine blocked autophagic flux as shown by LC3-II and P62 accumulation. induction of autophagy is associated with attenuation of I/R injury in liver. characterized apoptosis regulators have recently reduced beclin 1-mediated autophagy by inhibiting the formation of the Beclin 1\u2013hVps34 PI3K complex. inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes via a disruption in the pH of acidic vesicles. the increased cellular burden of autophagosomes has been shown to precede and possibly induce Bax- and mitochondrial rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. inflammatory cytokines, hepatic HMGB1 expression and release were analyzed. animals were housed under standard animal care conditions. HMGB1 immunohistochemistry HMGB1 immunohistochemical analysis was performed as described previously. sections were incubated with HMGB1 antibody (1 : 500; Abcam, #ab18256, Cambridge, the Netherlands) anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 : 20 000; Sigma-Aldrich, #G9545) were used for western blot analysis. the gray value of bands was calculated by ImageJ 1.43 G (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) all tests were performed using SigmaStat v3.5 (Systat-Software, Erkrath, Germany) A P-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. all procedures were carried out according to the german Animal Welfare Legislation. animals surviving 0.5, 6 and 24 h after reperfusion received one injection. hepatic warm I/R model performed as described previously. Detection was performed by using PowerVision goat-anti-Rabbit-AP (ImmunoLogic, DPVR-110AP, Duiven, the Netherlands) and using Fast-red (Abcam, #ab64254) as substrate. gel electrophoresis and western blotting Twenty micrograms total protein were separated on 12% gels by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. anti-caspase total RNA was extracted from liver tissue using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, #74106, Hilden, Germany) and was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the first-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, #18080051, Carlsbad, CA, USA) Primers and probes were mixed with Brilliant probe-based QPCR Master Mix (Agilent, #600881, Santa Clara, CA, USA) all tests were performed using SigmaStat v3.5 (Systat-Software, Erkrath, Germany). A P-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}
