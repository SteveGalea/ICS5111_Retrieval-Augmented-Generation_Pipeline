{"summary": "we resequenced the genome of a bacterium using MG1655 as a reference. we detected 7 of 8 small sequence differences, one large deletion, and 9 of 12 IS element insertions present in W3110. the false positive rate for SNPs was one per 244 Kb of genome sequence. resequencing is useful for relating phenotype to genotype. it has been used to study the acquisition of antibiotic resistance [1,2], the analysis of variation in pathogenic bacteria and viruses [3-7], and to study the experimental evolution of bacteria and yeast [8-11]. false positives are not a big problem in most cases since even 100 false mutations can be checked and refuted with PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing for less money than a typical resequencing experiment. results demonstrate the accuracy of CGS resequencing but also raise caveats about CGS and the instability of bacterial strains. yes SNP known 1335418 acnA b1276 a>g yes SNP known 1650355 intQ b1579 t>c yes ROI known 3484227 crp b2741 g>a yes ROI known 4210321 rrlE b4009 g>a undetected known 4364615 dcuA b4138 2 nt insertion yes ROI known IS element insertions 654214 dcuC P-malT b3417 \u2013 3418 IS5 insertion yes ROI new 3681321 dctA b3528 IS30 insertion yes ROI known 3886653 tnaA-tnaC b3707 \u2013 3708 IS5 insertion yes ROI known 4229085 yjbC b4022 IS2 insertion yes ROI known Deletions/Inversions 1395267 \u2013 1397616 ynaJ-fnr regions surrounding the other SNPs were PCR amplified and subjected to Sanger sequencing. in this way, 19 of the remaining putative SNPs were refuted, though 2 were confirmed. these two mutations are not present in the W3110 genome sequence. Nimblegen reported 1094 ROI probes located in 36 clusters. one cluster corresponded to known 6.6 kb deletion of intZ thru yffS (b2442\u20132450) three other clusters corresponded to known sequence differences. strain of MG1655 obtained from the CGSC in 1990. a culture was obtained from the original lyophil made when stock # 7167 was deposited. a culture was obtained from the original lyophil made when stock # 7167 was deposited in 1990. the false positive rate for SNPs was one per 244,193 bp of sequence. the false positive rate for clusters of ROI probes was one per 309,312 bp of sequence. a high false discovery rate is generally not a problem with resequencing projects. Nimblegen estimates that the false negative rate for SNPs is less than 5%. 7 out of 8 small sequence differences were detected, yielding a false negative rate of 12.5%. this rate may be consistent with Nimblegen's claims. all of the important mutations were found in most cases. an additional precaution against false negatives is resequencing multiple replicates from the same setup. strains with the same name (e.g. W3110, MG1655) differ depending on their source and storage conditions, so sequenced strains should only be obtained from the laboratories that sequenced them or their designated depositories. the results provided by Nimblegen are given in Additional File 1. these studies were supported by NIH1F32GM074590."}
