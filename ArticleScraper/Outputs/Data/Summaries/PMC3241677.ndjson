{"summary": "uric acid is metabolized by uricase (urate oxidase) to allantoin, before urinary excretion. man (and other species lacking uricase, such as great apes) has comparable higher serum uric acid levels than most mammals. genetic defects in the activity of xanthine oxidase or an acquired defect in liver enzyme function may result in hypouricaemia. idiopathic renal hypouricaemia is an inherited form of hypouricaemia that is characterized by excessive urinary wasting of uric acid leading to increased clearance (and increased fractional excretion of uric acid) inactivating mutations in idiopathic renal hypouricaemia have not yet been reported in a Caucasian population. the exact mechanism of renal damage is unclear, but may relate to damage from oxygen free radicals. we present mutations in SLC22A12 encoding URAT1 alongside their clinical, biochemical and functional characterization. hypertension p.R434C SK-2 18 F 1.75 27 Previous pyelonephritis Reflux nephropathy; Hypertension p.R434H SK-3 5.5 F 1.24 27 Recurrent episodes of gross hematuria and renal colic Alport syndrome p.R347S SK-5 7 F 1.28 17 None Hashimoto thyroiditis; hypothyroidism p.V388M NC-2 45 F 2.02 this 7 year old girl was referred to the nephrology unit with persistent vomiting, presumed to be secondary to a non-obstructive kidney stone. on admission she was alert, but pale and moderately dehydrated. a renal ultrasound scan revealed a single stone within the right kidney measuring 10 mm. the father had normal values of serum uric acid while the brother had moderately decreased serum uric acid level (1.56 mg/dl) this 18 year old girl was referred for management of hypertension. oaciduria, but no glucosuria, but no glucosuria. hyperphosphaturia (FEPO4 varied between 21\u201333%) and bilateral nephrocalcinosis. ed examinations of the uric acid confirmed persistent hypouricaemia. ed examinations of the uric acid revealed a heterozygous missense mutation. genetic analysis confirmed that the mother of patient SK-4 was also heterozygous for the sequence variant R347S. serum electrolytes revealed a normal serum creatinine (75 mol/l) with a low serum uric acid (2.01mg/dl). we performed genetic analysis of SLC22A12, which revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, p.I75T. not tolerated Deleterious Predicted to be probably damaging R434H Conserved between human, mouse and zebrafish rs147647315 (0.011) urate uptake was measured in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged URAT1 cDNA constructs. plasma membrane expression levels of variants R434C and R434H were low. intracellular localization was not strongly observed. urate uptake in HEK293 cells demonstrates a significant reduction of urate transport function. renal tubular acidosis p.R434C SK-4 8 M 1.24 27 Recurrent episodes of gross hematuria and renal colic Alport syndrome p.R347S SK-5 7 F 1.28 17 None Hashimoto thyroiditis; hypothyroidism p.V388M NC-2 45 F 2.02 N/A Recurrent nephrolithiasis None p.I75T *Symptoms due to renal hypouricaemia, a renal ultrasound scan revealed a single stone within the right kidney measuring 10 mm, without calyceal dilatation. laboratory investigations revealed normal renal function (serum creatinine 26 mol/l, estimated glomerular filtration rate 123 ml/min/1.73 m2) a 5 year old girl was admitted to the nephrology unit with severe dehydration, polyuria and vomiting. she had mild proteinuria (0.35 g/24 h) and a renal USS revealed a small left kidney. the hypouricaemia was associated with an elevated FEurate. mutational analysis of SLC22A12 revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, leading to amino acid change R434C. the mother of patient SK-3 was also heterozygous for the R434C variant in SLC22A12. a 41 year old woman presented to the regional lithotripsy unit for treatment. she underwent mutation analysis of SLC22A12 which revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, p.R434H. polyphen analysis predicted 3 out of 5 missense changes to be \u201cprobably damaging\u201d with V388M and I75T predicted to be benign (Table 2). we used online databases and mutation prediction software to attempt to score the pathogenicity of each variant. urate uptake was measured in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged URAT1 cDNA constructs. hek293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type URAT1. urate transport function is reduced by I75T, R347S, R434C and R434H variants of URAT1 but not in V388M variant. the exact mechanism of acute kidney injury remains elusive, but it is believed that uric acid serves as an antioxidant. in states of hypouricaemia this protective role is lost. hypouricaemia in japan varies between 0.15% [40] and 0.23% from the analysis of serum urate levels in 1730 school children [41] in Korea, the prevalence of hypouricaemia in healthy adults is 3.3% [42] school-age children who plan to perform competitive sporting activities are advised to have their serum uric acid level checked [43] this study validates heterozygous changes within URAT1 as a determinate of reduced serum urate levels. the variant allele provided a protective affect against gout, but one may postulate that this may also be an at-risk allele for the hypouricaemia. o et al. reported patients heterozygous for C850G in URAT1 with primary gout and low serum uric acid concentrations [50] while Ichida, et al. reported 5 individuals with a W258X heterozygous change, one of whom had a history of acute kidney injury and renal stones [23], [31], [36]. a systematic search for hypouricaemia identified patients with possible hereditary hereditary. we identified seven patients harboring five SLC22A12 variants. three macedonians carried mutations at amino acid position 434 of URAT1. some of these variants in SLC22A12 were discovered following significant clinical episodes including nephrolithiasis. hypouricaemia persisted for more than 2 years despite normalization of other proximal tubular functions. patient SK-2 has hypertension and moderate proteinuria due to reflux nephropathy, presumably as a coincidental finding to the functionally significant p.R434H variant. a recurrent calcium stone former with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes. the missense mutation p.V388M was associated with negative functional data. the transient hypouricaemia was transient in this case, we do not assume this sequence variant is causative. phenotypes should lead clinician to suspect an inherited form of renal hypouricaemia. informed written consent was obtained by participants' parents or legal guardians. children less than two years of age excluded from this study. twelve patients with hypouricaemia (2.6 mg/dl) underwent molecular analysis of SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 genes. 92 samples were obtained from blood donor (healthy control) panels. silico analysis of mutations Online was performed when sequence variant variants were identified. cellular uptake of [14C]UA was measured in hURAT1 (or its mutants)-transfected HEK293 cells [55] grown on poly-D-lysine-coated 24-well plates. cells were washed three times in ice-cold HBSS, then lysed in 0.1% NaOH for 20 min. informed written consent was obtained by participants' parents or legal guardians. idiopathic renal hypouricaemia was considered to be a likely diagnosis. 12 patients with hypouricaemia underwent molecular analysis of SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 genes. for control patient DNA screening, 92 samples were obtained from blood donor (healthy control) panels. in silico analysis of mutations Online in silico analyses were performed when sequence variant variants were identified. cellular uptake of [14C]UA was measured in hURAT1 (or its mutants)-transfected HEK293 cells [55] grown on poly-D-lysine-coated 24-well plates. cells were washed three times in ice-cold HBSS, then lysed in 0.1% NaOH for 20 min. table S1 Oligonucleotide primer pairs used for site-directed mutagenesis of SLC22A12 and SLC2A9.
