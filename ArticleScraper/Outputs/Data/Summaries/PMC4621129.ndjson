{"summary": "the 2014 outbreak of EBOV centered in Guinea, liberia, and Sierra Leone has resulted in over 27,000 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and 11,246 deaths. the five distinct filoviruses within the genus Ebolavirus (EBOV), each representing an Ebolavirus species, were responsible for a cumulative total of less than 2,300 cases, almost all within local regions in Africa. two antibodies from ZMAb (2G4 and 4G7) were combined with one MAb from MB-003 (13C6) to create the more potent cocktail ZMapp that reversed clinical signs in six out of six rhesus macaques. at least seven patients have now been treated with ZMapp, with five surviving (20\u201322), and six patients have been treated with ZMAb. the amino acids that form the detailed binding epitopes for all six cocktail MAbs have yet to be identified. alanine scanning across 641 residues of EBOV GP was used to determine the specific epitope residues for each MAb. the results were validated by neutralization escape. MB-003 cocktail MAbs 13C6, 6D8, and 13F6 were obtained as mouse variable regions chimerized with human constant regions. all MAbs are referred to in the text by their original names, irrespective of chimerization. the resulting EBOV GP alanine scan library covered 99.5% of target residues. each individual mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. clones were arrayed into 384-well microplates, one mutant per well. reactivities against each mutant EBOV GP clone were calculated relative to wild-type EBOV GP reactivity. mutated residues within critical clones were identified as critical to the MAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test MAb. cells were plated at 0.4 105 cells/well in modified Eagle medium. dilutions of MAb and pseudotypes preincubated for 45 min. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. MB-003 cocktail MAbs 13C6, 6D8, and 13F6 were obtained as mouse variable regions chimerized with human constant regions. all MAbs are referred to in the text by their original names, irrespective of chimerization. the resulting EBOV GP alanine scan library covered 99.5% of target residues (641 of 644) each individual mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. each mutation was transfected into HEK-293T cells and allowed to express for 22 h. the immunoreactivity of each MAb was optimized by determining reactivity with fixed or unfixed cells. b reactivities against each mutant EBOV GP clone were calculated relative to wild-type EBOV GP reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls. mutated residues within critical clones were identified as critical to the MAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test MAb but did support reactivity of other control EBOV MAbs. serial dilutions of MAb and pseudotypes preincubated for 45 min. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. at 24 h postransduction, 100 l of fresh medium was added to each well. a mutation library of EBOV envelope protein encompassing 641 GP mutations was constructed in which each amino acid was individually mutated. the entire mutation library was transfected into human HEK-293T cells in a 384-well array format. the entire mutation library was assessed against a shotgun mutagenesis mutation library of EBOV GP with 641 target residues mutated. the highlighted region identifies clones with high GP expression but low KZ52 binding. clones that were confirmed as critical are shown in red. other clones in the highlighted region were not confirmed as critical based on likely misfolding. the percent sequence identity at individual residues was determined using lentiviral reporter pseudotypes. the ability of each MAb to detect GP by Western blotting is indicated in references 27 and 28. NN, nonneutralizing. Epitope mapping of protective EBOV antibodies. EBOV mucin GP structure (PDB accession no. 3CSY) (24) for MAbs 2G4 (A), 4G7 (B), 13C6 (C), 1H3 (D), 6D8 (E) and 13F6 (F) are approximate. locations of residue P279 (D) and residues in the mucin-like domain (E and F) are not yet solved. our results suggest that these particular residues are accessible within the mucin-like domain. we also epitope mapped the conformationally sensitive MAb KZ52. KZ52 is currently one of the only MAbs cocrystallized with GP (24) KZ52 contact residues identified from crystallographic analysis are shown in blue. the KZ52 epitope (residues identified here in green) forms a conformational epitope that lies at the interface of GP1 and GP2 at the base of the GP trimer. our data suggest that residues N550, D552, and G533 on GP and in approximate center of all the contact residues form the \u201cfunctional epitope\u201d for KZ52. all 15 predicted contact residues from the KZ52-GP cocrystal structure (23) are shown. all residues in the cocrystal structure are predicted to make hydrogen bonds. no salt bridges are formed in the cocrystal structure. the EM footprint residues (purple) and mutagenesis hot-spot residues (green) are shown in the context of the Fab EM density information (solid structures) the location of residue P279 (D) is approximate, as the structure of this region is not yet solved. only the three GP base MAbs (KZ52, 2G4, and 4G7) demonstrate any significant neutralizing activity against wild-type EBOV GP in vitro. mutation D552A eliminated EBOV neutralization by MAbs KZ52 and 4G7. mutation G553A eliminated neutralization by MAbs KZ52 and 2G4. the reactivity of each MAb was first tested using cells expressing GP from EBOV, BDBV, TAFV, and SUDV ebolaviruses, as well as EBOV mucin GP. of the seven MAbs tested, only 2G4 and 13C6 showed cross-reactivity with any ebolaviruses other than EBOV. the GP of the 1976 EBOV Yambuku-Mayinga isolate used in our studies differs at 19 residues from the GP of the EBOV Makona isolates from the 2013-to-present day EVD outbreak. however, only one of the GP sequence changes is at a critical residue for the epitopes we identified, i.e., mutation T411A in the mucin-like domain (Fig. 7B) asterisks indicate complete conservation, colons indicate conservative mutations, and periods indicate semiconservative mutations. each MAb was tested for relative affinity using retroviral virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with wild-type EBOV GP. values for apparent affinity (Kd,app) and maximum binding (Bmax, shown as relative fluorescence units) were derived from the ELISAs using VLPs pseudotyped with EBOV WT GP or EBOV mucin GP. each MAb was also tested for relative affinity using retroviral VLPs. EBOV mucin GP was expressed approximately 2-fold better than wild-type GP. MAbs 13C6 and 1H3 against the glycan cap demonstrated a 3-fold-better Kd,app against EBOV mucin GP. this suggests exposure of glycan cap epitopes is enhanced when the mucin-like domain is removed. a mutation library for EBOV envelope protein encompassing 641 GP mutations was constructed in which each amino acid was individually mutated. each well contains cells expressing one mutant with a defined substitution. eight positive (wild-type GP) and four negative (mock-transfected) control wells are included on each plate. reactivities for each alanine scan mutant are expressed as a percentage of wild-type reactivity with ranges (half of the maximum minus minimum values) in parentheses. the ability of each MAb to detect GP by Western blotting is indicated in references 27 and 28. MAb 4G7 bound in the same area but instead used critical residue D552. elimination of the C511-C556 disulfide bond disrupts the structure of this entire epitope region. overlapping footprint of the GP base MAbs explains why they compete with each other for binding. MAb 1H3 also bound to the GP1 glycan cap, but using residues W275, K276, and P279. the locations of these epitopes are in agreement with their general location by cryo-EM. we identified consecutive residues Y394, K395, L396, D397, and I398 as critical for binding within the GP mucin-like domain. the epitope for KZ52 is very similar to the 2G4 epitope but also includes D552. KZ52 has been postulated to neutralize EBOV by preventing rearrangement of GP2 helical regions HR1A and HR1B in later stages of infectivity. the epitope at the GP base represents part of the native human B-cell response against EBOV. many of these residues form energetically less significant van der Waals interactions with KZ52 in the cocrystal structure. cocrystallography alone cannot directly discriminate which residues are the most energetically important among the contact residues, and even contact residues in cocrystallography are inferred by distance. wild-type residue T42 (T42A in our mutation library) was mutated to V42 in the GP crystal structure. mutation to alanine is less likely to disrupt the MAb-GP interaction. previous results using low-resolution EM localized the general footprint and angle of antibody binding for four cocktail MAbs of interest. the location of residue P279 (D) is approximated, as the structure of this region (residues 279 to 298) is unknown. key critical residues were tested for escape from neutralization. neutralization and single-particle EM corroborate mutagenesis localization of epitope residues for each MAb. reactivity of each MAb was first tested using cells expressing GP from EBOV, BDBV, TAFV, and SUDV ebolaviruses, as well as EBOV mucin GP. MAb 2G4 has an epitope nearly identical to that of KZ52, except that 2G4 does not require residue D552. residue D552 is present only in EBOV GP base MAbs KZ52 and 4G7. the locations of critical epitope residues identified for the indicated MAbs are highlighted green. conservation among the five species of ebolaviruses is shown below the alignment. each MAb was tested for relative affinity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mucin-like domain MAbs 6D8 and 13F6 bind GP with the highest affinity (0.5 to 0.9 nM Kd,app) and recognize the most numbers of GP molecules on the virion surface. the high affinity of the mucin-like domain MAbs and their ability to recognize the most numbers of GP molecules on the virion surface help explain their contribution to protection in vivo. 0.3 26 5.0 13C6 1.2 0.2 17 1.7 0.4 0.1 39 3.9 1H3 12.7 4.0 6.6 1.0 4.2 0.3 26 5.7 6D8 0.5 0.1 32 0.0 ND ND 13F6 0.9 0.4 35 3.7 ND ND V5 NA 20 0.4 NA 39 1.49. each MAb was also tested for relative affinity using retroviral VLPs pseudotyped with EBOV mucin GP. five of the seven epitopes mapped here are conformational in nature so could not have been fully mapped with peptides or denatured protein. our shotgun mutagenesis approach identifies epitopes irrespective of MAb neutralization status or viral fitness. mutations other than those to alanine could result in somewhat different results. we did not test the more structurally disruptive Q508R or Q508H substitutions. our data predict that MAbs KZ52, 4G7, and 13C6 may be particularly susceptible to viral evasion. however, none of the MAbs tested are highly cross-reactive. in vivo than MAb 1H3 primarily due to its stronger apparent affinity (10-fold better for both wild-type GP and EBOV mucin GP) the epitope for KZ52 is highlighted in panel A. a value for the percent survival is indicated. GP contains highly protective epitopes. the specific epitope residues identified here at the base of GP could serve as structural targets for small-molecule inhibition."}
