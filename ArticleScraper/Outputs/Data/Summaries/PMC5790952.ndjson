{"summary": "alphacoronaviruses and -coronaviruses infect mammals, -coronaviruses infect birds, and -coronaviruses infect mammals and birds. reponaviruses include human NL63 coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) from the Alphacoronavirus genus. -coronavirus spikes contain two domains, the N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) Depending on the virus, either one or both of the S1 domains can function as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by binding to host receptors. -coronavirus S1-CTDs recognize either angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or aminopeptidase-N (APN ation on mature virions is a trimer, already cleaved into receptor-binding subunit HA1 and membrane fusion subunit HA2. a previously buried hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) becomes exposed and inserts into host membrane. the overall architecture of - and -coronavirus spikes is similar to, albeit more complex than, that of influenza HA. it is not clear which of their S1 domains functions as the RBD, where the structural elements of S2 are located, or how -coronavirus spikes are structurally and evolutionarily related to the spikes from other genera. this study fills in critical gaps by determining the cryo-EM structure of PdCoV spike. the maps have a contour of 6.6. (C) Cryo-EM structure of prefusion PdCoV S-e. each of the monomeric subunits is colored in the same way as those in panel A. the atomic structure of prefusion PdCoV S-e contains residues 52 to 1017. the overall trimeric structure of PdCoV spike is similar to, but more compact than those of - and -coronavirus spikes. each subunit of HCoV-NL63 S1 contains only one S1-NTD. Connecting S1 and S2 are two subdomains, SD1 and SD2, and a long loop. the structure of PdCoV S2 is in the prefusion conformation and can be aligned well with those of - and -coronavirus S2 fragments. MHV spike (PDB entry 3JCL) is colored cyan. each subunit of PdCoV S1 contains only one S1-NTD. each subunit of HCoV-NL63 S1 contains two. ELISA plates were precoated with sugar-rich mucin. then PdCoV S1-NTD was added and incubated with mucin. a plate without mucin was used as negative control. the sugar-binding site in -genus BCoV S1-NTD and the galactose-binding site in human galectins are located on top of the core structure (18, 43) the sugar-binding site in PdCoV S1-NTD also may be located in the same region (Fig. 5A and C) - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs share the same structural topology. despite their different structural folds, - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs share the same structural topology with -coronavirus S1-CTDs. dot blot receptor-binding assay for PdCoV S1-CTD. receptor (either APN or ACE2) was first dotted onto a membrane. recombinant PdCoV S1-CTD was detected using antibodies recognizing its C-terminal His6 tag. inant PdCoV S1-CTD carried out a dot blot assay to examine whether it binds ACE2 or APN. results showed that PdCoV S1-CTD likely functions as the main RBD and binds to a yet-to-be-identified receptor on the surface of human and pig cells. the receptor-binding site in PdCoV S1-CTD is currently unknown. - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs have a -sandwich core, whereas -coronavirus S1-CTDs have a -sheet core. the RBMs in - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs are three short discontinuous loops. depending on the virus, their RBM loops can bind APN (as in TGEV), ACE2 (as in SARS-CoV SD1 adopts a small fold containing two antiparallel -sheets. one is two stranded and the other is five stranded. SD2 also adopts a small -sandwich fold containing two three-stranded -sheets. the FP in PdCoV S2 would need to change its conformation, spring out toward the membrane-distal direction, and insert into the target membrane. the reason why HR-N and FP are locked in their prefusion conformation is likely because S1-CTD and SD1 from another subunit sit on top of them. the scissor indicates the proteolysis site at the N terminus of FP. the arrow indicates the direction in which HR-N would need to extend to reach the postfusion conformation. despite its compact structure, S1 maintains the two-RBD system. the sugar-binding site in -genus BCoV S1-NTD is also shielded, not by glycans but by the ceiling-like structure on top of the core structure (18). the sugar-binding site in -genus BCoV S1-NTD is also shielded, not by glycans but by the ceiling-like structure. trimeric S1 contains six domains (three copies of S1-NTD and S1-CTD each) and six subdomains (three copies of SD1 and SD2 each) that tightly pack into a crown-like structure. the trimeric S1 contains the same galectin fold as - and -coronavirus S1-CTDs. the structures of both S1-NTD and S1-CTD of PdCoV are evolutionarily more closely related to -coronaviruses than to -coronaviruses. each of the S2 subunits is locked in the prefusion conformation by structural constraint of S1 from a different monomeric subunit. we collected cryo-EM data on PdCoV S-e and determined its structure at 3.3- resolution (Table 1 and Fig. 1B and 2). Schematic drawing of PdCoV S-e in the prefusion conformation. resolution was determined to be 3.3. the atomic structure of prefusion PdCoV S-e contains residues 52 to 1017. the overall trimeric structure of PdCoV spike is similar to, but more compact than, those of - and -coronavirus spikes. the S1 trimer of -genus MHV spike has an intertwined quaternary structure. the S1-CTD in -genus HCoV-NL63 spike also stacks with the S1-NTD from the same subunit. the structure of PdCoV S2 is in the prefusion conformation and can be aligned well with those of - and -coronavirus S2 fragments. SD1 consists of two discontinuous regions, SD1\u2032 and SD1\u2032\u2032. SD2 consists of two discontinuous regions, SD2\u2032 and SD\u2032\u2032. structure of monomeric S1 is colored in the same way as those in panel A. the S1-NTDs from - and -coronaviruses have the same galectin fold. -coronavirus S1-NTDs contain a short -helix on top of the core structure. -coronavirus S1-NTDs contain a ceiling-like structure in the same location. SARS-CoV S1-CTD, and BSA were used as negative controls. a plate without mucin was used as an additional negative control. errors indicate standard errors of the means (SEM) es acquired a galectin gene from the host and incorporated it into their spike gene, which began to encode S1-NTD. both the structure of PdCoV S1-NTD presented here and the structures of -coronavirus S1-NTDs determined by recent studies confirmed our earlier prediction. structure of -genus HCoV-NL63 S1-CTD (PDB entry 3KBH) structure of -genus SARS-CoV S1-CTD (PDB entry 2AJF) Flow cytometry assay for the binding of PdCoV S1-CTD to the surface of mammalian cells. the cell-bound PdCoV S1-CTD was detected using antibodies recognizing its Fc tag. the result showed that PdCoV S1-CTD-Fc bound to both human and pig cells with significantly higher affinity than Fc alone. it is unknown whether PdCoV infects human cells. in -coronavirus S1-CTD, the same three loops are structurally similar to their counterparts in -coronavirus S1-CTDs. the current structure, the S1-CTD is in a closed conformation, with its putative RBMs pointing toward the S1-NTD and unavailable for receptor binding. S1-CTDs are a long continuous subdomain; depending on the virus, their RBM can bind ACE2 (as in SARS-CoV) or DPP4 (as in MERS-CoV) these results suggest these S1-CTDs have a common evolutionary origin and have undergone divergent evolution. two central helices, CH-N and CH-C, from each subunit form a six-helix intersubunit interface. FP corresponds to a region consisting of four helices and connecting loops. the exact location of FP is uncertain, but it may correspond to a region consisting of two helices and a connecting loop (30). the structural and mechanistic similarities between coronavirus S2 and influenza HA2 suggest that the two viral membrane fusion proteins are evolutionarily related (4). the above-described analysis will need to be confirmed by the atomic structure of postfusion PdCoV S2. the closed-to-open conformational change of S1-CTD has been observed for -genus MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spikes (28). this mechanism can minimize the exposure of the putative RBM loops to the immune system. most of these sites are located on the surface of S1, which is in contrast to -genus HCoV-NL63 spike, where S2 is more heavily glycosylated than S1. observed glycans are in dark blue, predicted, but not observed, glycosylation sites are in light blue. a compact PdCoV spike trimer is locked in the prefusion conformation. PdCoV S1-CTD has the same -sandwich fold as -coronavirus S1-CTDs. this structural fold differs from the -sheet fold of -coronavirus S1-CTDs. the protein was cloned into pFastBac vector (Life Technologies Inc.) with an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and C-terminal GCN4 and His6 tags. the protein was harvested from cell culture medium and purified sequentially on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and Superdex 200 gel filtration column. the grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI MarkIII Vitrobot system (FEI Company) for data collection, images were recorded using a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector in the direct electron counting mode (Gatan) the automated software Leginon (46) was used to collect 2,100 movies at 22,500 magnification and at a defocus range of between 0.5 and 3 m. the cryo-EM structure of HCoV-NL63 spike (PDB entry 5SZS) was divided into 7 parts (S1-NTD, SD2\u2032, SD1\u2032, S1-CTD, SD1\u2032\u2032, SD2\u2032\u2032, and S2) and fitted into the cryo-EM map of PdCoV S-e individually using UCSF Chimera (50) and Coot (51). at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, PdCoV S1-NTD (1 g/ml) was added to the plates and incubated with mucin at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after more washes with PBS, enzymatic reaction was carried out using ELISA substrate (Life Technologies Inc.) and stopped with 1 M H2SO4. human cells were incubated with anti-His6 antibody (Life Technologies Inc.) at 4\u00b0C for 2 h, washed with PBS, incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5,000) and washed with PBS. the receptor-bound proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent (ECL plus; GE Healthcare) ed into pFastBac vector (Life Technologies Inc.) with an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and C-terminal GCN4 and His6 tags. it was expressed in SF9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies Inc.) and purified as previously described (15). the final image was bin averaged to give a pixel size of 1.3. the parameters of the microscope contrast transfer function were estimated for each micrograph using GCTF (48). structural model was refined using Phenix (52) with geometry restraints and 3-fold noncrystallographic symmetry constraints.
