{"summary": "HAstV is a leading cause of viral diarrhea in children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. there are approximately 3.9 million cases of viral diarrhea due to HAstV in the united states every year (8). astroviruses are nonenveloped icosahedral viruses with an 7-kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. the astrovirus genome has three open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode nonstructural polyproteins. newly synthesized CPs spontaneously assemble into viruslike particles inside infected cells. CP core domain contains two subdomains: a typical jelly roll -barrel found in many RNA viruses and a squashed -barrel (26). the identity of the host cell receptor(s) and the location of receptor-binding site(s) on the surface of the HAstV particle are unknown. Spike2 has structural homology to HAstV-1 and HAstV-8 CP spikes. unique features of Spike2 include an extended loop 1 and a short alpha helix (1) within the interface of the dimeric structure. fab PL-2 and scFv PL-2 binding to Spike2 were nearly identical at KD of 1.8 nM. these studies show that scFv PL-2 bind to Spike2 similarly with high affinity and specificity. ELISA results showing that scFv PL-2 binds to Spike2 but not Spike1 or Spike8. structure of scFv PL-2 bound to HAstV-2 CP spike. we cocrystallized and solved the structure to 3.2- resolution. value in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell. scFv PL-2 and Spike2 are intimately associated with each other. each scFv PL-2 binding site is comprised of a conformation-dependent quaternary epitope. many of the amino acids in the scFv PL-2 epitope are unique to serotype HAstV-2. scFv PL-2 heavy chains (VH) are colored purple. the PL-2 epitope amino acids are colored yellow. the glycosylation site on the scFv PL-2 heavy chain Asn 88 is labeled (GlcNAc) electron density maps surround one of the binding regions between scFv PL-2 and Spike2. loop 1 is labeled. all six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from the heavy and light chains of scFv PL-2 interact with Spike2. scFv PL-2 uses an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions to bind to a quaternary epitope on the surface of the Spike2 dimer. scFv PL-2 uses an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions to bind to a quaternary epitope. all Spike2 mutants eluted as dimers by size exclusion chromatography. but all of the single-point Spike2 mutants showed binding curves and maxima for MAb PL-2 that were similar to those of wild-type Spike2. this mutant drastically reduced MAb PL-2 binding compared to wild-type Spike2. mature T=3 HAstV-2 virion bound to Fab PL-2 is aligned onto each of the 30 spike dimers on the mature T=3 HAstV model. the model suggests that MAb PL-2 likely binds divalently to the mature HAstV-2 virion, which would increase the overall avidity of antibody binding. a recombinant fusion protein is fused at the N terminus of HAstV-2 CP spike (GFP-Spike2) for controls, we fused GFP to the N terminus of serotype HAstV-1 and 8 CP spikes. for additional controls, we produced GFP alone and GFP fused to the N terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) scFv PL-2 to GFP-Spike2 but not GFP, GFP-GST, GFP-Spike1 or GFP-Spike8. samples containing scFv PL-2 are indicated with a plus sign (+) below protein names. the presence of scFv PL-2 reduces the fluorescence of any other GFP fusion proteins or GFP alone. the presence of scFv PL-2 reduces the fluorescence of any of the other GFP fusion proteins or GFP alone. Spike2 has structural homology to HAstV-1 and HAstV-8 CP spikes (Spike1 and Spike8). unique features of Spike2 include an extended loop 1 and a short alpha helix (1) within the interface of the dimeric structure. fab PL-2 and scFv PL-2 binding to Spike2 were nearly identical at KD of 1.8 nM. these studies show that MAb PL-2 and scFv PL-2 bind to Spike2 similarly with high affinity and specificity.

CP spike domains from canonical serotypes HAstV-1-8 are receptor-binding domains. we also present evidence for the hypothesis that MAb PL-2 neutralizes HAstV by blocking HAstV receptor binding. we hypothesize that MAb PL-2 blocks binding of HAstV receptors. a subunit vaccine immunogen comprised of recombinant HAstV CP spike may elicit a protective neutralizing-antibody response. however, polyclonal antibodies raised against HAstV tend to be very serotype specific. scFv PL-2 was purified from mouse ascites fluid as described previously. Fab PL-2 was generated by incubation of MAb PL-2 with immobilized papain, followed by Fab fragment purification, as described previously (31). production of recombinant scFv PL-2 was described previously (31). genes were cloned into a pET-GFP plasmid in frame with an N-terminal 6-histidine purification tag. all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. protein production was induced with 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside. wells were blocked by addition of 150 l of 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. wells were incubated with 150 l antibody for 1 h. plates were then incubated for 1 h with 150 l horseradish peroxidase. a single-cycle kinetics approach was employed because the extended dissociation time of 2,400 s made a multicycle kinetics approach impractical. the analyte scFv PL-2 or Fab PL-2 was flowed over the sensor surface at 0 nM, 1.12 nM, 3.74 nM, 11.23 nM. crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 22\u00b0C. they were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution of 20% PEG 3350. 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. the complex coeluted at an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa compared to gel filtration standards. the purified complex was dialyzed into 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl and concentrated to 12.3 mg/ml. crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 22\u00b0C. the final scFv PL-2/Spike2 complex structure (PDB 5KOV) had a total of four scFv/Spike2 complexes. the high Rmerge is due to the crystal being anisotropic. two poorly ordered scFv molecules (chains Q and W) contribute to high B factors. cells were resuspended in 9.5 ml growth medium and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 200 g. cell pellets were resuspended in 500 l PBS and kept on ice. percentage of fluorescent cells incubated with PBS-only samples is 1%. incubation of scFv PL-2 with immobilized papain followed by Fab fragment purification. secreted scFv PL-2 was affinity purified on a StrepTrap column. expression and purification of Spike constructs. genes were cloned into pET52b (Addgene) in frame with a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site. plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). protein production was induced with 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18\u00b0C for 16 h. proteins were dialyzed into 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 25 mM NaCl. antibody sample MAb PL-2 or scFv PL-2 was diluted to 5 g/ml with 1% BSA in PBS and serially diluted 1:3 with 1% BSA in PBS. plates were incubated for 1 h with 150 l horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted 1:5,000 in 1% BSA in PBS. the analyte scFv PL-2 or Fab PL-2 was flowed over the sensor surface at 0 nM, 1.12 nM, 3.74 nM, 11.23 nM, and 37.44 nM. each injection had a contact time of 60 s at 30 l/min. 12% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 7.0) crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution of 20% PEG 3350, 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. the purified complex was dialyzed into 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl. the purified complex was dialyzed into 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and concentrated to 12.3 mg/ml. crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution of 24% PEG 3350, 0.2 M sodium phosphate monobasic, and 25% glycerol and flash frozen in two poorly ordered scFv molecules contribute to high B factors. these scFv molecules had weak electron density and high B factors. the good redundancy of the data and signal-to-noise ratio in the highest-resolution shell gives us confidence in our final model. 500 l prewarmed trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) was added to each well. cells were incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. cell pellets were washed by resuspension in 10 ml PBS."}
