{"summary": "unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis is a rapidly progressive respiratory disease that affects patients with no pre-existing lung disease. unclassified pneumonia with fibrosis is not classified as a disease entity under the classification of interstitial lung diseases in adults. however, pathological findings of unclassified interstitial pneumonia are different from those of AIP. arterial blood gas analysis showed mild hypoxemia. his white blood cell count was 14,300/L, with 55.8% neutrophils and 36.3% lymphocytes. blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and sputum cultures were negative for bacteria, viruses, and fungi. a previously healthy 47-year-old non-smoking male patient presented with a 2-day history of cough, mucoid sputum, and chills. his son was hospitalized with the same symptoms at the same time. radiography and a CT scan of the chest showed an extensive pneumomediastinum, a pneumothorax in the right hemithorax, and diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation in both lungs. her response to treatment was poor, and her condition deteriorated rapidly. postmortem lung biopsy revealed the features of the fibrotic phase of DAD with occasional hyaline membrane and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. follow-up chest radiography on day 72 of admission revealed an increased level of bilateral infiltrates (C) radiography and a CT scan of the chest revealed a mild restrictive defect. the patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy, followed by oral steroids, azathioprine, and antibiotics. the dyspnea gradually decreased, and she was discharged after 2 weeks of treatment. radiography and a CT scan of the chest revealed the presence of rhinovirus. she was treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, and hydroxychloroquine for 2 weeks. the ground-glass opacities, septal thickening, and consolidation had decreased. bronchioles are destructed and obliterated by fibroblastic proliferation (asterisk) bronchioles are destructed and obliterated by fibroblastic proliferation (asterisk) chycardic, tachypneic, and rales were audible over the left lung field on auscultation. a chest CT scan revealed the presence of multifocal consolidation and diffuse centrinodular ground-glass opacities. laboratory tests for collagen disease and vasculitis were negative. radiography and a CT scan of the chest showed an extensive pneumomediastinum, a pneumothorax in the right hemithorax and diffuse ground-glass opacities. her total leukocyte count was 9,300/L, with 66% neutrophils and 27% lymphocytes. blood, sputum, and BAL cultures for bacteria and fungi were negative. tial fibrosis with hyperplastic type II pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation suggests the fibrotic phase of diffuse alveolar damage. a 30-year-old non-smoking woman was admitted to the department of Internal Medicine with a 1-month history of cough and dyspnea on exertion. her leukocyte count was 14,000/L, with 72% neutrophils and 20% lymphocytes. a 17-month-old girl presented to the out-patient clinic with a 30-day history of worsening cough. she was treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, and hydroxychloroquine for 2 weeks. after discharge, her daily activities were limited by dyspnea. l cases of interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology, in a young male patient and his father, and two young girls and their mother. they presented with the same clinical symptoms, showed rapidly progressive respiratory failure of unknown cause, and had similar radiological and pathological features. previously, we reported this unclassified interstitial pneumonia with rapidly progressive pulmonary fibrosis as AIP. the association between interstitial pneumonia and genetic mutations in a family raised the question of whether genetic mutation could be responsible for the simultaneous development of this disease in family members of different ages. the spring timing of this interstitial pneumonia, its characteristic pattern of spread from the south to north, and the detection of various viruses (i.e., human corona virus, cytomegalovirus, and parainfluenza virus) provide evidence that viral infection may be associated with the development of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis in Korea. severity of the respiratory difficulty, both reflecting disease severity, may predict poor response to treatment. the occurrence of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis only in spring."}
