{"summary": "Isolation precautions (IPs) are used to minimize pathogen transmission and hospital-acquired infections. the three main indications are (i) microorganisms with antibiotic resistance (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) secreting organisms. positive screening swab (by culture or nucleic acid testing) or evidence of active infection Usually after 3 negative swabs at 1-week intervals and off VRE antibiotics 72 hrs prior to testing Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Antibiotic resistance Contact Culture of ESBL-secreting organisms Usually for duration of hospitalization Clostridium difficile Propensity for transmission Contact Diarrhea in patient with suspected outbreak exposure. this paper is not arguing against hand-washing, nor are we claiming that IPs definitively cause worse outcomes. however, with microorganisms such as MRSA and VRE, there is a growing association between IPs and increased complications. the mean cost associated with isolation ranges from $400\u2013$2000 per positive-patient per day. other \u201cCosts\u201d of Patient Isolation Patients may also \u201cpay a price\u201d when isolated. isolated patients twice as likely to experience an adverse event during hospitalization. isolated patients have increased rates of depression. the largest of these followed up over 70,000 patients for more than two years. the largest of these followed up over 70,000 patients for more than two years. a 2011 NEJM cluster-randomized study found no significant change in the rate of MRSA colonization and MRSA-related infections with and without expanded barrier precautions. the lack of benefit from IPs was surprising because surveillance identified a sizable subgroup of colonized patients who would not otherwise have been recognized. there is even less literature to support IPs for C difficile and respiratory viruses. a single document, based mostly on expert opinion, stated that in order to discontinue isolation there should be three negative nasal swabs for MRSA each separated by one week. in 2002, Byers et al. performed a retrospective cohort study of VRE colonization. they concluded that 92% were still negative on first follow-up swab and 95% were negative on both the second and third follow-up swab [22] universal decolonization resulted in decreased transmission and a significant reduction in all bloodstream infections (not just MRSA), compared to either targeted decolonization or screening with isolation. this approach eliminated costly MRSA admission screening (approximately 50 dollars per patient) and all the costs of isolation mentioned above. the issue of IPs is not clear-cut, that guidelines need regular review. we need a mechanism for dissemination if new evidence becomes available. hospitals have their own policies for implementing and removing precautions."}
