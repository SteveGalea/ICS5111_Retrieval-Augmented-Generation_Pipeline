{"summary": "VSV replicates in the cytoplasm and contains a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA genome of approximately 11 kb encoding five viral proteins. a phase I human clinical trial using replication-competent oncolytic VSV against hepatocellular carcinoma is in progress. some of these proteins are enclosed within the virion structure. others may reflect the mechanism of virus assembly, be necessary for viral function, impact host range and infection efficiency. a recent study showed that depletion of host proteins normally incorporated into herpes simplex virus type-1 virions reduced virion production in those cells. a number of purified viruses have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. this includes poxviruses [22], [23], [24], herpesviruses [25], [26], [27], [29], [31], [32], orthomyxoviruses [33], coronaviruses [34], [37], [38], [39], paramyxoviruses [40], [41], baculoviruses [42], hy pBS-N and pVSVFL(+) plasmids were infected with at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a media containing 5% FBS. the media was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 minutes (min) to remove large cellular debris. the virus was then purified as described in [48], with slight modifications. virions pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C for 1.5 h. purified virions were treated with 0.08 g ProK per 1 g total protein. virions were disrupted in a buffer containing a final concentration of 10 mM Tris-HCl. samples were visualized using a JEOL JEM 2100 LaB6 Transmission Electron Microscope. protein identification following 1D-SDS-PAGE Total protein equaling 50 g for purified virion samples and 60 g for ProK treated virions was separated on a 10% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. each gel lane was cut into 13 or 14 gel bands for analysis. a parent ion mass tolerance of 2.0 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.0 Da, and a 16 Da differential modification for methionine oxidation were used for search parameters. protein identifications were accepted when the peptide probability was greater than 95.0% [51], the protein probability was greater than 99.0%. protein concentrations of cellular lysates, purified virions, ProK treated virions and RNP complexes were determined by Bradford assay. 50 g of purified virions, 60 g ProK treated virions, 15 g of RNP complexes and 10 g of cellular lysates were separated on Tris-Glycine 10% SDS-PAGE gels. membranes were blocked in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 0.3% glucose (w/v), 3.4 mM L-glutamine, 90 U/ml penicillin and 90 g/ml streptomycin were supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. infected cells were infected with at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at 37\u00b0C. purified virions were treated with 0.08 g ProK per 1 g total protein. virions were disrupted in a buffer containing a final concentration of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.4 M NaCl, 1.85% Triton X-100, and 0.6 mM DTT. virions were pelleted through a 30% glycerol cushion onto the recovered RNP complexes were diluted 11 (v/v) with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT. grids were blotted dry, stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water for 30 s, blotted to remove excess stain and air-dried. each full MS scan was followed by eight MS/MS scans of the most intense ions with data-dependent mode using the dynamic exclusion option (Top 8 method) the spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm of the bioworks software against the IPI.HUMAN.v.3.18 and IPI.MOUSE.v.3.18 databases concatenated with a VSV and Sendai virus protein database. enriched terms were subjected to cluster analysis using the default settings. the broadest term representing most if not all the proteins in the cluster is used here to describe the cluster. Detection was with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus (ECL+) protein detection system (UVP imaging, Upland CA) the purity of the resulting material was then examined by electron microscopy (EM) mass spectrometry based analysis of host protein content was conducted on (a) purified whole virions and (b) purified virions treated with proteinase K to remove surface proteins. total protein from 50 g purified virions or 60 g ProK treated virions was separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE. total protein from whole virions or proteinase K (ProK) treated virions was separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. brackets on the right indicate bands cut out and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) purity of the virions prepared using the method presented here could also contribute to differences in the number of host proteins identified. EM images, staining of total protein on SDS-PAGES gels and infectivity (2.4107 PFU/g total protein for the present method) all indicate virions prepared using the method presented here are of equal or greater purity to those used previously. 74 of the 181 proteins identified in whole virions were no longer detectable. other proteins were still detected in the ProK treated sample. hepatocyte growth factor receptor was found in a slice spanning approximately 140\u2013225 kDa in whole virion. proK treatment completely eliminated peptides associated with the N-terminal portion of the extracellular domain of G. a few were still detected in the more C-terminal portion of the domain. the decrease in spectral counts suggests the majority the G proteins were cleaved. proteins not associated with the interior of the virion can be identified by their absence in ProK treated samples or by a size shift upon ProK treatment. five of the chosen proteins were found in both whole and ProK treated virion samples and had similar spectral counts in both sample types. only for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase itchy (ITCH) were substantial amounts of protein detected in RNP. the M protein of VSV contains a late domain (L-domain) including a proline rich PPxY motif known to bind WW domains found in a number of cellular proteins. protein lysates from uninfected (BHK) and VSV infected (BHK+VSV) cells were separated by SDS-PAGE along with total protein from whole virions, proteinase K (ProK) treated virions, and viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. the most highly enriched clusters were vesicles and vesicle mediated transport, protein localization and nucleotide binding. the most highly enriched clusters were vesicles and vesicle mediated transport and protein localization. ocapsid to the site of virus budding has been shown to be dependent on microtubules. however, the budding of VSV and related viruses may still have some unique features. the host ubiquitin-proteasome system does appear to be essential [63], [69] 6% of proteins identified in our study are associated with the GO term \u201cplasma membrane\u201d, suggesting they were acquired along with the envelope. many of the proteins identified in VSV virions appear to be associated with viral assembly, budding or the host-derived viral envelope. proK treatment cleaves all proteins on the exterior of the virions. but it cannot penetrate the viral envelope, leaving all VSV proteins intact. proteins on the interior of any residual cellular vesicles would still be detectable. virions were grown on BHK-21 cells as it is the standard cell line for growth of VSV and the high virion yields aid in purification. however, a complete database of hamster proteins is not available. results from both searches were highly similar; therefore only those from the search of the mouse database are presented here. of the 30 proteins detected in BHK-21 derived whole virions in our previous study, 27 were detected in at least one sample type here. differences in the purity of the virions prepared using these two methods could also contribute to differences in the number of host proteins identified. proteins found in all technical replicates were identified based on only two unique spectra in 19% and 17% of cases for whole virions and ProK treated virions respectively. proteins found in only one technical replicate were identified based on only two spectra in 71% and 77% of cases. keratins, common environmental contaminants, were found across a wide range of molecular weight. the number of spectra went up upon ProK treatment for all VSV proteins except G. removal of the extracellular domain was confirmed by determining the distribution of the spectra and peptides derived from the G protein. the mean number of spectra associated with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the G protein was unchanged between whole and ProK treated virions. only one host protein, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), had a mean of more than 100 total spectra per technical replicate in untreated whole virions. only 17 (9.4%) had a mean spectral count of more than 20. proteins not associated with the interior of the virion can be identified by their absence in ProK treated samples or by a size shift upon ProK treatment. most proteins were barely detectable in the RNP complexes. only for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy (ITCH) were substantial amounts of protein detected in RNP. levels of Ptp4a2 and putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Pl10 (D1pas1) dropped sharply in the ProK and RNP samples. one protein, coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A (Cc2d1a), identified by MS could not be detected by WB. shock cognate 71 kDa protein kDa protein (Hspa8) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy (ITCH) were conducted as indicated to determine the presence of the host proteins. of the 6 proteins that could be detected by western blot, only 4 were present at similar levels in whole and ProK treated virions. more than one third (88/257) of the proteins identified are represented in at least one of these 4 clusters. transport of the VSV nucleocapsid to the site of budding has been shown to be dependent on microtubules. non-VSV proteins can make up a significant portion of the protein in the VSV envelope. the tendency of VSV to indiscriminately acquire relatively large numbers of host membrane proteins has the potential to be exploited to fine tune therapeutic vectors."}
