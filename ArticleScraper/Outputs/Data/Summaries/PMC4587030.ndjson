{"summary": "public health informatics (PHI) is a field that is growing in breadth, depth, and complexity. many essential services have not yet benefited from advances such as maturing electronic health record systems, interoperability amongst health information systems, analytics for population health management, social media among consumers. the agenda has been updated to reflect four key drivers. a global reduction in infectious disease rates in combination with a growth in non-communicable chronic diseases. the result is a complex scope for public health informatics. data science comprises predictive analytics (chosen as the special topic of the 2014 edition of the Yearbook [14]) and statistical and epidemiological methodology is incorporated into the practice and delivery of health services to better manage populations with complex and chronic illnesses. in this article, we discuss the evolving scope of PHI through recent trends observed principally in the united states. we then highlight advancements in the field evidenced in recent literature. articles excluded if they did not constitute original research such as letters, editorials, perspectives, opinions, whitepapers, comments, and study protocols. a broad survey of advances in the field of PHI was created using a thematic analysis to create a broad survey of advances in the field of PHI. in the past four years, EHR adoption rates among non-federal acute care hospitals increased from 15% to over 90%. in the past four years, MU incentives have led to investment in health informatics by public health authorities. a major goal is providing \u201cno wrong door\u201d services [34] where services are focused on the client\u2019s and family\u2019s needs, rather than on the bureaucracy\u2019s, which the family may have contacted in no particular order. the Essential Services of Public Health [18, 35] \u2014 Assessment (of public health situations and threats), Policy Development (to address what was assessed), and Assurance (to implement the policies)\u2014remain the core activities performed by public health authorities. the paper demonstrates the evolving PHI stack as influenced by the public health context. the paper was presented: Notifiable Disease Surveillance (clinician lab results or diagnoses reported to state agencies on an ongoing basis) the states planning to implement HIE should be mindful of these dynamics proactively, or at least in the event of a persistent failure. a decade ago, Buehler et al. challenged the PHI community to build better surveillance systems. studies by Vest and colleagues, as well as Dixon and colleagues, highlight that data quality in surveillance systems is often poor. despite a more timely reporting, data quality in surveillance systems is often poor and presents a barrier to more efficient PHI practice. public health authorities often need multiple data sources to comprehensively monitor population health. this greater access has ushered in a \"Neolithic Revolution\" in PHI [59], yet few electronic datasets within a health authority or external ICT systems are easily linked. househ performed an umbrella systematic review of reviews of short messaging service (SMS) the 13 reviews covered a range of functions and a range of contexts. SMS shows promise in preventive care [71, 72] in promoting healthy behaviors [73, 74] and in promoting medication adherence among people with HIV. education and workforce development are components of Assurance in the Essential Services typology. recent activities, primarily in the united states, highlighted major advances in the education of the PHI workforce. in 2002, a consensus by the public health community expressed a 12-point code of ethics. only one informatics paper relates informatics issues to this code. but it is in the realm of bioinformatics, rather than the primary functions we consider in PHI. in the paper, we highlight literature that demonstrates the evolving PHI stack as influenced by the public health context. the paper was presented: Notifiable Disease Surveillance (clinician lab results or diagnoses reported to state agencies on an ongoing basis), Population Health (broadly conceived), Immunization Information Systems (reporting of vaccinations; access to clinicians; immunization forecasting), and Other [38]. the state planning to implement HIE should be mindful of these dynamics proactively, or at least in the event of a persistent failure. a decade ago, Buehler et al. challenged the public health community to build better surveillance systems. nearly two-thirds of u.s. states report adoption of ELR due in part to MU regulations [49] a systematic review by Gluskin and colleagues found that the implementation of ELR systems has improved the timeliness and workflow associated with infectious disease surveillance in public health agencies. MT took only 18% as much time as MT took for the Essential Service Diagnose & Investigate. another study used wearable monitors, usually part of the \u201cquantified self\u201d movement, for infectious disease modeling [58]. mHealth and Social Media Infrastructure Mobile technologies play several roles in the Essential Services. they can replace paper-based surveys that have been the stalwarts of Assessment. there has been increased use of mobile technologies in all areas of PHI. 15 articles targeted hard-to-reach populations, such as youths and adolescents. other essential functions addressed were general health promotion strategies, substance (not just drugs) abuse, and mental health. a framework for health informatics ethics based on a review of nine organizations\u2019 codes of ethics. it is in the realm of bioinformatics, rather than the primary functions we consider in PHI. the IOM has pushed forward the concept of a Learning Health System [87]. mhealth menu options include reporting cases to cancer registries and reporting cases to other registries. the notion of \u201ctechnical\u201d is broad, since informatics is a \u201csocio-technical\u201d activity [41], whether in hospitals in the us [37] or pediatric care in the UK [32] or mobile health in India [42]. a decade ago, Buehler et al. challenged the PHI community to build better surveillance systems. in the united states, surveillance systems received a boost from MU incentives for the adoption and use of EHR systems. nearly two-thirds of states report adoption due in part to MU regulations. limited budgets for human resources and to update technologies within health agencies constitute a barrier to the timely cast investigation and follow-up after the detection of an outbreak or the routine case of infectious disease. many existing systems utilize free text chief complaints [53], there is increasing interest in PHI surveillance using more complex text sources. the u.s. has witnessed a growth in interoperable HIE activities [60, 61] as well as the number of public data sets [62]. most public health authorities are not involved in community HIE efforts. many health departments lack sufficient informatics capacity[66] to establish or leverage robust information infrastructures. denecke and colleagues reviewed the state of the field (as of 2013) and offered a proof (the M-Eco system) of the concept that multiple sources of social data can be brought to bear on the question of infectious-disease outbreak. they found that only 21% (rather than about 75%) of texts were making it all the way through. they realized that medical terms are not necessarily used to talk about medical conditions. the U.S. recognized clinical informatics as an official medical sub-specialty with a Board certification exam available to medical doctors. many students in these programs seek broader degrees in health or biomedical informatics, creating uncertainty about the sustainability of PHI programs and tracks. socio-technical infrastructure & research is broad, since informatics is a \u201csocio-technical\u201d activity [41], whether in hospitals in the us [37] or in pediatric care in the UK [32] or mobile health in India [42]. a number of \u201cloops\u201d capture key dynamics in resolving the gap between the desired level of health information exchange and the clinical information electronically available. a decade ago, Buehler et al. challenged the PHI community to surveillance systems received a boost from MU incentives for the adoption and use of EHR systems. in the united states, surveillance systems received a boost from u.s. incentives for the adoption and use of EHR systems. text processing should be an important enabler of mass customization of health messaging across cultures within a jurisdiction. MT took only 18% as much time, but MT took only 18% as much time. most public health authorities are not involved in community HIE efforts. many health departments lack sufficient informatics capacity[66] to establish or leverage robust information infrastructures. mHealth and social media infrastructure mobile technologies play several roles in the Essential Services. the system is user-centered, in filling the pipeline from (German text) data source to dashboard. only 21% (rather than about 75%) of texts were making it all the way through. the review comprises 73 primary papers. nearly two-thirds of states report adoption of surveillance systems due in part to MU regulations. a systematic review by Gluskin and colleagues found that the implementation of ELR systems has improved the timeliness and workflow associated with infectious disease surveillance in public health agencies. study used wearable monitors, usually part of the \u201cquantified self\u201d movement, for infectious disease modeling [58]. Historically, epidemiologists have spent a significant amount of their time and energy in the gathering, integration, and analysis of multiple datasets. however, most public health authorities are not involved in community HIE efforts. mHealth and Social Media Infrastructure Mobile technologies play several roles in the Essential Services. they can replace paper-based surveys that have been the stalwarts of Assessment. there has been increased use of mobile technologies in all areas of PHI. the review comprises 73 primary papers. 15 articles targeted hard-to-reach populations, such as youths and adolescents. the review also pointed out the fickleness of some social networks. health informatics education has sparked growth in health informatics programs. many students seek broader degrees in health or biomedical informatics. however, there is no equivalent exam in PHI. the full power of modern simulations and analysis is rarely made available to departments or ministries of health to \u201cDevelop Policies\u201d the ability to monitor wearable technologies, or to monitor Web-page access, provides a window to possibilities to \u201cEnforce Laws\u201d."}
