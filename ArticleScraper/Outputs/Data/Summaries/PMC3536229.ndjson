{"summary": "fda issued emergency use authorizations for several nucleic acid amplification-based assays for the diagnosis of H1N1-p infection in patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infections. fda issued emergency use authorizations for several nucleic acid amplification-based assays. the PLEX-ID Flu assay is a qualitative nucleic acid in vitro diagnostic test intended for the detection and identification of H1N1-p, H1N1-s, H3N2 and Flu B viruses in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. the assay incorporates broad-range multilocus reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and prospective collection study was conducted at four enrollment sites, including bioMed Supply Inc., Carlsbad, CA; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; ProMedDx, LLC. additional NPS specimens retrospectively collected during February 2008, January to March 2009, and September 2009 to June 2010. Discrepant results between the PLEX-ID Flu and the Prodesse ProFLU+/ProFAST+ assays were resolved by bidirectional Sanger sequencing of the flu A virus hemagglutinin (HA) gene. only results from the Prodesse ProFLU+/ProFAST+ assays (comparator method) were used to determine the performance of the PLEX-ID Flu assay. the PLEX-ID system is composed of front-end processing instrumentation and the PLEX-ID analyzer. nucleic acids were extracted from NPS specimens by using the PLEX-ID SP instrument and the PLEX-ID viral RNA isolation kit (list 05N80) the ProFAST+ assay has manufacturer-disclaimed sensitivities and specificities of 94.4 to 100.0% and 99.0 to 99.36% for H1N1-s, 95.4 to 100.0% and 100.0% for H1N1-p, and 100.0% and 99.6 to 100.0% for H3N2 respectively. primer pair CP1 (5\u2032-CCA GAA ATA GCC AAR AGA CC-3\u2032)/CP2 (5\u2032-AAC CAT CYA CCA TYC CAG TCC-3\u2032) was used to amplify and sequence seasonal H1N1 virus-positive samples. primers amplify a region from positions 723 to 1041 of the reference sequence under GenBank accession number HM189312.1. the acceptable criterion for the point estimate of the reproducibility rate was 95.0% for all sites combined. the results of the PLEX-ID Flu assay were compared to the results of the Prodesse ProFLU+/ProFAST+ assay for the calculation of positive percent agreement (PPA) (sensitivity), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall agreement. additional NPS specimens retrospectively collected during February 2008, January to March 2009, and September 2009 to June 2010 were provided by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Specimen testing was done at athoGen, Irvine, CA; Vanderbilt University Medical Center; and Johns Hopkins University. bidirectional Sanger sequencing was done at Prodesse Inc., Waukesha, WI. results from the Prodesse ProFLU+/ProFAST+ assays (comparator method) were used to determine the performance of the PLEX-ID Flu assay. inclusion criteria included (i) patients previously enrolled in this study, (ii) patients for whom obtaining a NPS swab specimen was contraindicated. nucleic acids were extracted from NPS specimens by using the PLEX-ID SP instrument and the PLEX-ID viral RNA isolation kit (list 05N80) total nucleic acids were bound to magnetic beads, and non-nucleic acid sample material was washed away during multiple wash steps. extractions were performed with either the MagNA Pure LC System/MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Roche) or NucliSENS easyMAG system/Automated Magnetic Extraction reagents (bioM\u00e9rieux Inc., Durham, NC) samples positive for flu A virus by ProFLU+ were then tested by the ProFAST+ assay to identify the virus subtype. primer pair CP3 (5\u2032-AGG GAG AAT GAA CTA TTA CTG G-3\u2032)/CP4 (5\u2032-AAA TCT AGA TTG-3\u2032) was used to amplify and sequence 2009 H1N1 virus-positive samples. these primers amplify a region from positions 723 to 1041 of the reference sequence under GenBank accession number HM189312.1. the acceptable criterion for the point estimate of the reproducibility rate was 95.0% for all testing sites combined. 114 specimens with positive results were set to have a statistical power of 80% to detect the difference between a null-hypothesis proportion, 0, of 0.800 and an alternative proportion, A, of 0.900. prospectively collected specimens P valuec Site 1 (n = 58) Site 2 (n = 177) Site 3 (n = 560) Site 4 (n = 288) No. (%) of patients of gendera 0.001 Female 33 (56.9) 92 (52.0) 346 (61.8) 132 (46.0) Male 25 (43.1) 85 (48.0) 214 (38.2) 156 (54.0) Mean age of patients (yr) SDb 28.9 14.8 33.0 15.1 37.3 two batches were run per day per site. a total of 319 results obtained during 5 days of testing were analyzed. an overall agreement of 98.3 to 100.0% was observed between the three sites.

LU+/ProFAST+ specimens, 44 were positive, 2 were negative, and 1 was unresolved by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. PLEX-ID Flu assay for simultaneous detection and identification of influenza A and B viruses in NPS specimens. DISCUSSION Influenza viruses are continually evolving through site-specific mutations and segment reassortment. the PLEX-ID Flu assay is a rapid and powerful technique for the detection, identification, and characterization of influenza viruses for both clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. the clinical trail data demonstrated that the PLEX-ID Flu assay is able to correctly detect and differentiate influenza A 2009 H1N1 (H1N1-p), seasonal H1N1 (H1N1-s), influenza A H3N2 and influenza B viruses."}
