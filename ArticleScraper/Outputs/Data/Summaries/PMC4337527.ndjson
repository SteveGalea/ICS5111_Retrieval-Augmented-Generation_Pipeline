{"summary": "inactivated whole virus (IWV) without adjuvant provided only modest protection, inducing low neutralizing-antibody titers and earlier lung clearance in challenged ferrets. inactivated whole virus (IWV) without adjuvant provided only modest protection, inducing low neutralizing-antibody titers. alternative vaccine antigen is the SARS-CoV spike protein (SP), which mediates target cell entry via attachment to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and CD209L. it also exacerbated lung eosinophilic immunopathology and increased mortality when immunized children became infected with RSV (20. there is a critical need to identify suitable coronavirus vaccine adjuvants that do not exacerbate, or ideally suppress, virus-induced lung immunopathology delta inulin adjuvants successfully enhanced humoral and cellular immunity and protection against SARS-CoV. Advax-1 was a preservative-free sterile suspension of delta inulin microparticles at 50 mg/ml in a bicarbonate buffer. Advax-2 additionally included 10 g CpG per 1 mg delta inulin. mice were immunized twice 3 weeks apart with a variety of different vaccine formulations. they then bled regularly for 12 months to monitor changes in antibody levels. the work was done in the AAALAC-accredited laboratory animal research center of Utah State University. IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, or IgM antibodies (Abcam) with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences) was incubated for 1 h at RT and then incubated with 100 l of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for 10 min. reaction was stopped with 1 M phosphoric acid. cells were washed, incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse Ig, IgG1, IgG2a, or IgM antibodies (Abcam), anti-mouse gamma interferon (IFN-), interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-4 antibody pairs (BD) with streptavidin-HRP (BD Biosciences) anti-mouse cytokine MAb at RT for 2 h, and then washed again, and then streptavidin-HRP was added and left for 1 h before washing and addition of aminoethylcarbazole substrate solutions. the number of spots in negative-control wells was subtracted from the number of spots in SP wells. the results were expressed as antibody-secreting cells (ASC) per 106 bone marrow cells or spots per 106 group comparisons for antibody and ELISPOT tests were done by the Mann-Whitney test. survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log rank test. Vaccine immunogenicity studies were performed in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. mice were immunized twice 3 weeks apart with a variety of different vaccine formulations and then bled regularly for 12 months. serum samples diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline (BSA-PBS) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT) and washed. then 100 l biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 or IgM antibodies (Abcam) with streptavidin-horseradish peroxida cells were washed with 0.1% BSA-PBS and stained with anti-mouse CD16/CD32. cells were then stained with anti-mouse CD4-allophycocyanin (APC) and anti-mouse CD8a-phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7 (BD) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the cells were incubated with rSP (10 g/ml) at 37\u00b0C and then blocked with RPMI\u201310% FBS for 2 days. wells were washed, incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse Ig or anti-mouse cytokine MAb at RT for 2 h. streptavidin-HRP was added and left for 1 h before washing. an overall infiltration score was assigned to each section according to the amounts of eosinophils in the parenchyma and their distribution through the lung. immunohistochemistry to the eosinophil major basic protein was determined in sections with the highest score of each treatment group. IgG1 response at 2 weeks postimmunization was maintained out to 1 year postimmunization. Advax-2 significantly increased a broad range of antibody isotypes, namely, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3. this pattern was maintained for 1 year postimmunization. at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization, mice (n = 6 for each time point) were sacrificed and bone marrow collected for measurement of memory B-cell frequency by ELISPOT assay. all values are means standard errors of the means (SEM) # group where there was a significant (P 0.05) fall in antibody titer between 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization. the Advax-1 group showed a consistent trend to reduced SP-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation even compared to the group receiving unadjuvanted rSP alone. at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization, splenocytes were harvested from immunized mice for rSP-stimulated T-cell proliferation. the Advax-1 group showed the highest frequency of IFN--secreting T cells at 1 year postimmunization. the pattern of IL-2-secreting T cells was similar to that for IFN-. IL-4 is the major cytokine produced by Th2 cells. splenocytes obtained at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization were stimulated with SP-specific peptides representing known BALB/c CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes. the vast majority of IFN- spots were generated in response to the CD4 peptide. splenocytes obtained at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization were stimulated with rSP and cytokines measured in the supernatants. at 1 year postimmunization the CpG group exhibited significantly reduced SP-stimulated IFN- production. IL-17 was the only cytokine that was significantly increased in the Advax-2 group at 1 year postimmunization. Vaccine effects on SARS-CoV protection. control groups received either vehicle or Advax-1 or Advax-2 adjuvant alone to test whether the delta inulin adjuvants had any nonspecific protective effects against coronavirus infection. all active vaccine formulations without or with adjuvant significantly protected mice against lethal infection, with the unadjuvanted IWV vaccine being the least protective. by day 3 postchallenge, titers were significantly higher in the rSP 2.5 g+Advax-2 group than in the alum-adjuvanted group or the group given 2.5 g rSP alone. by day 6 postchallenge, IgG titers had risen a further 8-fold in the active vaccine groups and were now detectable in the vehicle control groups. rSP 10 g+Advax-2 group had the highest neutralizing-antibody titers at both days 3 and 6 postchallenge. rSP 10 g+Advax-2 group had the highest serum IgG titers. rSP 10 g alone group showed the opposite phenomena. groups of immunized mice were sacrificed on days 3 and 6 postchallenge. showed are lung histology scores (A and B), lung weights (C and D), lung virus titers (limit of detection, 0.75) and SP-specific lung IgG titers (G and H) rSP 2.5 or 10 g plus Advax-2 groups continued to have the lowest virus titer point estimates. rSP 2.5 g and IWV-alone groups caught up at day 3 postchallenge. eosinophil infiltration score of 0 to 3 was assigned to each section. rSP 2.5 g+Advax-2, score 0.0/3; rSP 10 g+Advax-2, 0.4/3; and rSP 2.5 g+Advax-1, 0.6/3. immunohistochemistry to eosinophil major basic protein was determined in mice with the highest score from each treatment group. this confirmed severe lung eosinophil infiltration in the unadjuvanted IWV and rSP groups and alum-a response at 2 weeks postimmunization was maintained out to 1 year postimmunization. Advax-2 significantly increased a broad range of antibody isotypes. this pattern was maintained for 1 year postimmunization. at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization, mice (n = 6 for each time point) were sacrificed and bone marrow collected for measurement of memory B-cell frequency by ELISPOT assay. all values are means standard errors of the means (SEM) # group where there was a significant (P 0.05) fall in antibody titer between 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization. the Advax-1 group showed a consistent trend to reduced SP-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation even compared to the group receiving unadjuvanted rSP alone. at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization, splenocytes were harvested from immunized mice for rSP-stimulated T-cell proliferation by CFSE assay (A) and cytokine ELISPOT assays (B). the Advax-1 group showed the highest frequency of IFN--secreting T cells at 1 year postimmunization. the pattern of IL-2-secreting T cells was similar to that for IFN-. IL-4 is the major cytokine produced by Th2 cells. splenocytes obtained at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization from the Advax-2 group showed significantly increased SP-stimulated IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17 levels. splenocytes obtained at 2 weeks and 1 year postimmunization from the Advax-2 group showed significantly increased SP-stimulated IFN-, IL-4, and IL-10 secretion. at 1 year postimmunization the CpG group exhibited significantly reduced SP-stimulated IFN- production. IL-17 was the only cytokine that was significantly increased in the Advax-2 group at 1 year postimmunization. control groups received either vehicle or Advax-1 or Advax-2 adjuvant alone to test whether the delta inulin adjuvants had any nonspecific protective effects against coronavirus infection. all active vaccine formulations without or with adjuvant significantly protected mice against lethal infection, with the unadjuvanted IWV vaccine being the least protective. by day 3 postchallenge, titers were significantly higher in the rSP 2.5 g+Advax-2 group than in the alum-adjuvanted group or the group given 2.5 g rSP alone (rSP 2.5 g alone group) by day 6 postchallenge, titers had risen a further 8-fold in the active vaccine groups. rSP 10 g+Advax-2 group had the highest neutralizing-antibody titers at both days 3 and 6 postchallenge. rSP 10 g+Advax-2 group had the highest neutralizing-antibody titers. rSP 10 g alone group showed the opposite phenomena. groups of immunized mice were sacrificed on days 3 and 6 postchallenge. showed are lung histology scores (A and B), lung weights (C and D), lung virus titers (limit of detection, 0.75) and SP-specific lung IgG titers (G and H) rSP 2.5 or 10 g plus Advax-2 groups continued to have the lowest virus titer point estimates. all active vaccine formulations resulted in detectable lung IgG titers. rSP 2.5 g and IWV-alone groups had caught up. rSP 2.5 g+Advax-2, score 0.0/3; rSP 10 g+Advax-2, 0.4/3; and rSP 2.5 g+Advax-1, 0.6/3. immunohistochemistry to eosinophil major basic protein was determined in mice with the highest score from each treatment group. this confirmed severe lung eosinophil infiltration in the unadjuvanted IWV and rSP groups and alum-a mice immunized with rSP plus Advax-2 showed a complete absence of eosinophilic immunopathology. the combination of rSP and Advax-2 adjuvant could make an ideal coronavirus vaccine. a surprising feature of T cells from mice immunized with Advax-2 was their lack of SP-stimulated proliferation despite high levels of IFN- production. rSP plus Advax-1 induced the most robust and durable SP-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell response, extending out to at least 1 year postimmunization. we hypothesize that Advax-1 uniquely induced a long-lived SP-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell population, consistent with the high levels of SP-induced IL-2 production. mice munized with rSP plus Advax-1 or Advax-2 had 2- to 3-fold more SP-specific bone marrow ASC than mice immunized with rSP alone. a similar mechanism whereby an expanded population of memory B cells rather than preformed serum neutralizing antibody provided enhanced viral protection by Advax-adjuvanted vaccines. mice immunized with Advax-1 showed enhanced T-cell IL-4 responses. but they did not develop lung eosinophilic immunopathology. this raises the question of the mechanism of SARS-CoV eosinophilic immunopathology. we propose a model whereby immunization with SARS antigens alone or formulated with alum fails to induce a sufficient number of IFN--secreting memory T cells. this enables a vicious cycle of ever-increasing Th2-polarization of the anticoronavirus response to become established. this is precisely the phenotype imparted by formulation of SARS-CoV antigens with delta inulin adjuvants. important questions remain to be addressed, including identification of best strategies to protect elderly subjects. delta inulin-based adjuvants have previously been shown to enhance human vaccine responses in elderly subjects. this study highlights the critical importance of adjuvant selection for developing effective and safe coronavirus vaccines."}
