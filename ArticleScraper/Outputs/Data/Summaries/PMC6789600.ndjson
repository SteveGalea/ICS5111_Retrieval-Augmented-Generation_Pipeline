{"summary": "a retrospective study found that only 19% of survey participants reported symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection [3], a figure that has been cited to suggest that Zika virus infection is asymptomatic in as many as 80% of individuals. a retrospective study found that only 19% of survey participants reported symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection [3], a figure that suggests that Zika virus infection is asymptomatic in as many as 80% of individuals. a subsequent seroprevalence study found that 43% of those with evidence of prior infection had symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection. the most common reported complication of Zika virus infection is a Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9-like illness that had a prevalence of 0.24 cases per 1000 cases of infection in the french polynesian epidemic [13]. a prospective study of five women showed that Zika virus RNA was detected in vaginal fluid for as long as 6 months and a month or more in three of the five [31]. a prospective study of five women showed that Zika virus caused infection of the ovaries of non-immunosuppressed C57Bl/6 mice and induced a T-cell inflammatory reaction. the one unknown aspect is whether vaccination of males of any age may be beneficial to protect against testicular complications the almost complete disappearance of Zika has created significant barriers to vaccine studies. the WHO removed the designation of Zika a virus of global concern in 2018. current transmission rates, coupled with high background herd immunity, would require an extremely large and logistically difficult study. as of 2017, six vaccines had advanced to Phase I studies [37,39,40] since that time, two additional vaccines have entered into clinical trials. most have been assessed in animal models utilizing non-human primates and/or lethal challenge experiments involving immunosuppressed mice. vaccinated mice and non-human primates were shown to develop immune responses against the Zika virus envelope. vaccine protected against development of neurologic disease and death in immunosuppressed, interferon, receptor deficient (IFNAR) mice [43]. no serious adverse events (SAE) reported as part of the study. both vaccine candidates were advanced into clinical trials with 4 mg of administered intramuscularly at weeks 0, 4 and 8 with vaccine VRC5288 administered by needle and syringe. both vaccines protected >90% of NHPs against viremia at a dose of either 1 or 4 mg given twice. a subsequent study in non-human primates vaccinated twice at four-week intervals with alum generated binding and microneutralization antibody titers of 3.54 and 3.55 log10. there were no vaccine-associated SAEs reported. the most common adverse events were pain and tenderness at the injection site. immunization of AG129 mice with un-modified lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated vaccines mRNA was immunogenic and protective against lethal infection. immunization of C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice followed by treatment with anti-ifnar1 blocking antibody showed protection against viremia in approximately 60% of animals. a proposed CHIM study provides estimates that Zika virus infection is relatively asymptomatic and self-limited for the majority of individuals. a Guillain\u2013Barre-like syndrome occurs in approximately 1 of 5000 Zika virus infections [13], whereas other neurologic complications such as meningoencephalitis, myelitis [15,53,54], and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [54] are rare. Zika vaccine development continues with multiple candidate vaccines in clinical trials. there has been renewed interest in animal model and human infection models."}
