{"summary": "DENV are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. they consist of four serotypes (from DENV-1 to DENV-4) that are transmitted to humans and other higher primates by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. the only available way to control dengue is vector control since there is neither a vaccine for human use nor an antiviral drug. rum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine 200 mM, 1% penicillin G (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 g/mL) and 10% triptose phosphate were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. vero cells were seeded in 12-well plate in L-15 medium with 10% FBS for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. 5% FBS and 3% carboxymethyl-cellulose (1 mL/well) (overlay) were added. cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS. after 2 hours at room temperature, cells were washed twice with PBS. deNV-2 replication of mock control was 0 g/mL. infected cell supernatants were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours postinfection. the experiments were carried out in duplicate. the amplification protocol consisted of 48\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, and finally 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the same protocol was used to quantify the DENV-2 RNA copies present in infected cells in contact with CLQ compared to control cells without the drug. mM, 1% penicillin G (100 U/mL), 10% triptose phosphate, 1% penicillin G (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 g/mL) and 10% triptose phosphate. vero cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in the absence of CO2. utions of virus stock or supernatant of cells treated with CLQ were added (0.1 mL/well) to the cells, which were then incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. overlay was removed on day seven, and cells were fixed with a solution of 10% formaldehyde in PBS. after 2 hours at room temperature, the formaldehyde solution was removed. vero and C6/36 cells were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of CLQ (0; 0.05; 0.5; 5; 50 g/mL) at defined time intervals. infected cell supernatants were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours postinfection. 0.5 L of RNase inhibitor, 0.13 L of multiscribe (50 U/L), 0.5 L of primers (20 nM) DV2U (5\u2032-AAGGTGAGATGAAGCTGTAGTC-3\u2032), and 5 L of RNA to a final volume of 25 L. the same protocol was used to quantify the DENV-2 RNA copies present in the supernatants of CLQ-treated and untreated vero and C6/36 cells infected with DENV-2 concentrations equal to or lower than 500 g/mL (CLQ) were highly cytotoxic to C6/36 cells. concentrations equal to or lower than 50 g/mL (CLQ) did not induce significant cytotoxicity. the viral RNA present in the culture supernatants of vero cells infected with DENV-2, both untreated and treated with chloroquine just after infection, was extracted and analyzed by qRT-PCR. the results represent the average values of the number of copies of viral RNA (P > 0.05). the results represent the average values of the number of copies of viral RNA (P 0.01). viral replication in vero-infected cells was impaired by the addition of CLQ at 1 hour after infection and at 12-hour intervals after infection. both the plaque assay and qRT-PCR showed a statistically significant reduction in viral yield. the viral RNA present in the culture supernatants of C6/36 cells infected with DENV-2, both untreated and treated with chloroquine just after infection, was extracted and analyzed by qRT-PCR. the results represent the average values of the number of copies of viral RNA (P > 0.05) the analysis by plaque assay was again in agreement with qRT-PCR. the viral RNA present in the culture supernatants of vero cells infected with DENV-2, both untreated and treated chloroquine (every 24 hours after infection) was extracted and analyzed by qRT-PCR. the results represent the average values of the number of copies of viral RNA (P 0.05) di Trani et al. [8] tested the antiviral effects of CLQ in vitro against selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. CLQ is a safe drug with over half a century of use in the treatment of malaria; therefore, the implementation of a protocol to use it in dengue treatment would not be a problem. in 1981, coombs et al. [16] observed that CLQ did not reduce the viral load in experiments carried out with the Sindbis virus in cells of the mosquito Aedes albopictus. two explanations are possible for these findings: (i) CLQ blocks endosome acidification but not the infection of mosquito cells with the Sindbis virus."}
