{"summary": "ethnoveterinary medicines used for horses in Trinidad and tobago and in British Columbia are part of a common market in pharmaceuticals. some shared cultural features between Canada and the Caribbean derived from common Amerindian culture, British colonial histories, and continuous migration from the Caribbean to North America. 80% of the taxa used in the Atlantic forests of Bahia, Brazil came from africa, Asia and Europe. the plant pharmacopoeia in south America is cultivated, exotic and opportunistic. research conducted by the first author in both countries indicates that there are far more herbs of Chinese origin being used in Canada than there are in Trinidad and tobago. the research area in British Columbia consisted of the lower Mainland, the Thompson/Okanagan region and south Vancouver Island. the horse industry in 2001 was primarily located in the Thompson Okanagan (25%), the Lower Mainland (20%), the Peace River (18%) and lastly 15% in the Cariboo region. interviews in Trinidad took place from July to September 2000. interviews conducted in 2003 reassessed initial data. ten trainers and two assistant trainers were interviewed. six owners/breeders or their representatives were interviewed in 2000, two by phone. only one used ethnoveterinary medicines; one was a trainer as indicated above. in 2003, four trainers were interviewed (one by phone) published sources such as journal articles and books and databases on pharmacology and ethnomedicine were searched to identify the plants' chemical compounds and clinically tested physiological effects. this data was incorporated with data on the reported folk uses, and their preparation and administration in North America and Europe. ethnobotanical data and pharmacological information were matched with the recorded folk use of the plant species [12-18] to determine degrees of confidence about its effectiveness. a plant (or closely related species of the same genus) attains the lowest level of validity if no further phytochemical or pharmacological information validates the popular use. interviews in Trinidad took place from July to September 2000 (CL) and 2003 (KG) the first contact relating to this study was a race-horse owner. the first contact relating to this study was a race-horse owner. four trainers were interviewed in 2000, two by phone. a groom, a stable lad, an assistant trainer, a jockey and a recently graduated veterinarian were interviewed. a purposive sample of livestock farmers was needed to target key informants. Medicinal plant voucher specimens were collected and deposited in the university of Victoria herbarium (V) the plant-based remedies were evaluated for safety and efficacy with a non-experimental method. published sources such as journal articles and books and databases on pharmacology and ethnomedicine available on the internet were searched to identify the plants' chemical compounds. a low-cost, non-experimental method was used to evaluate the potential efficacy of the ethnoveterinary remedies. the method consisted of: obtaining an accurate botanical identification of the herbal remedies reported;. searching the pharmaceutical/pharmacological literature for the plant's identified chemical constituents. this information was then used to assess whether the plant use is based on empirically verifiable principles. aloe vera, Pulmonaria officinalis and Medicago sativa were used for exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage. aloe vera, Curcuma longa and Medicago sativa were used in both research areas but for different ailments. tendon problems Oxalis corniculata Oxalidaceae Speedweed Enhance performance Panicum maximum* Poaceae Wiz/Guinea grass Leaf Grooming Pimenta racemosa Myrtaceae Bay leaves Leaf Diaphoretic Psidium guajava Myrtaceae Guava Leaf, bud Diarrhoea Pueraria phaseoloides Fabaceae Kudzu Leaf High protein feed Ricinus communis Eu horses with sprained tendons or ligaments have joints of rachette (Nopalea cochenillifera) applied directly to the injured area. the mucilage obtained from inside the rachette joints may be mixed with flour and or Epsom salts. horses were not blistered above the knee. the iodine is said to act as a counter irritant. there is periostitis of the plantar surface of the third metacarpal bone. horses with bad tendon injuries were treated with rachette and aloes. the sock is then wrapped with a football sock that has had the toe cut off. an alternative treatment is to put aloes on first, then wrap a bois can\u00f4t leaf on the leg. a wet horse may be rubbed with wild carailli or wild senna leaves to cool them. coconut oil (Cocos nucifera) was also used to make the coat shine. one respondent used carailli to treat rashes. two plants called speedweed (Oxalis corniculata and Desmodium sp.) were used to enhance performance. the plants were fed to horses with the rest of their feed, not given specifically. horses were given a 7.5 cm piece of aloes (Aloe vera) each day for three days. one respondent used linseed oil mixed with aloe vera gel twice weekly. another used pounded turmeric rhizome (Curcuma longa) watercress (Nasturtium officinale) was put in horses' food to \"increase their blood count\" a decoction of bois can\u00f4t leaves was given as the drinking water. horses sweated or syringed with cough medicine made of honey, garlic, and onion. malvaceae mallow aerial parts counteract Lasix Arctium lappa Asteraceae burdock root arthritis Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Ericaceae uva-ursi aerial parts bladder infections Artemisia sp. malvaceae mallow aerial parts demulcent for devil's claw, prevent colic Althea sp. cucurbita pepo Cucurbitaceae pumpkin fruit flesh and seed tapeworms Curcuma longa Zingiberaceae turmeric rhizome arthritis Daucus carota Apiaceae carrot grated root pinworms Echeveria elegans Crassulaceae hen and chicks leaves hoof abscess Echinacea angustifolia, E. purpurea, E. pallida Asteracea augustifolia Lamiaceae lavender aerial parts soother Lavendula sp.
