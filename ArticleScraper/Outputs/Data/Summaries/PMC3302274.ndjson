{"summary": "NDV strains are grouped as highly virulent (velogenic), moderately virulent (mesogenic), and minimally virulent (lentogenic) based on pathogenicity in chickens. the genome of NDV is a single-stranded, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA of 15,186 nucleotides (nt) a trimeric type I integral membrane protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor F0 (66 kDa) that is posttranslationally cleaved by host cell proteases into two disulfide-linked subunits. a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the N terminus of the F1 subunit form a fusion peptide that interacts with the host cell membrane, thereby initiating the fusion process. the F glycoprotein of NDV contains six potential N-linked glycosylation acceptor sites at residues 85, 191, 366, 447, 471, and 541 that are conserved in all strains (10, 36) a previous study has predicted that four of these sites present at residues 85, 191, 366, 447, 471, and 541 are functionally active. a chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF1) and a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (EMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS. the modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA) was propagated in primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells in DMEM with 2% FBS. the PacI-MluI fragment containing the F gene was amplified by overlapping PCR. the PCR product was cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) the inserts bearing the N-glycan mutation were released by digestion with PacI and MluI. the recovered mutant viruses were subjected to five passages in 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos. total RNAs were isolated from mutant allantoic fluid by the use of a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). the amplified cDNA fragments were then sequenced using a BigDye Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit. the HN gene from each recovered virus was also sequenced with available primers from our laboratory. three synthetic peptides were custom synthesized (Invitrogen) vero cells were infected with each mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with 2% DMEM. after 36 h postinfection, cells were washed with PBS and divided into two aliquots. membranes were washed three times in washing solution (0.05% Tween 20\u2013PBS) and then incubated in secondary antibody. anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were diluted (1:5,000) in dilution buffer for 1 h at room temperature. the fusion index of each mutant virus was calculated by observing 10 fields per well in duplicate. the fusion index is the ratio of the total number of nuclei to the number of cells in which these nuclei are present. growth characteristics of N-glycosylation mutant viruses were evaluated by multiple-step growth assays. the pathogenicity of the N-glycosylation mutant viruses was determined by a mean death time (MDT) test in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test in 1-day-old chicks (2) and 2-week-old chickens. each egg was examined three times daily for 7 days. the minimum lethal dose is defined as the highest virus dilution that causes all inoculated embryos to die. the birds were observed for clinical symptoms and mortality once every 8 h for a period of 8 days. at each observation, the birds were scored as follows: 0, healthy; 1, sick; or 2, dead. the pathogenicity of the mutant viruses was further evaluated in 2-week-old chickens by a natural route of infection. a chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF1) and a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained in EMEM with 5% FBS. the modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA) expressing T7 RNA polymerase was provided by Bernard Moss (NIH, Bethesda, MD) the recombinant derivatives were grown in 9-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs in an enhanced biosafety level 3 containment facility. after 2 days, the allantoic fluid was harvested and the virus was plaque purified using our standard procedure (21) a unique PacI site was created in the downstream untranslated region (UTR) of the M gene. mutant F cDNAs were sequenced in their entirety to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. transfection and recovery of recombinant mutants were performed by using a reverse genetics technique described previously (21). the recovered mutant viruses were subjected to five passages in 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos. from each passage, total RNAs were isolated from mutant NDV-infected allantoic fluid of 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos. the amplified cDNA fragments were then sequenced using a BigDye Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit. a rabbit was injected with 0.5 mg each of KLH-conjugated peptide A and peptide B in Freund's complete adjuvant to raise anti-Fcyt and anti-FNterm antiserum. after 2 weeks, a booster immunization was given with 0.5 mg of peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. the hyperimmune sera were collected 2 weeks later. NGaseF (2 U), 10 reaction buffer, and 10% NP-40 supplied by manufacturer were added to equal amounts of cell lysates from each recombinant virus. samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer in presence of reducing agent and loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels along with equal amounts of undigested cell lysates. membrane was blocked with blocking solution (5% skim milk\u2013PBS) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody the ability of each N-glycosylation mutant virus to form syncytia was determined according to a procedure described by Kohn (20). DF1 cells in duplicate wells were infected with each virus at an MOI of 0.01. monolayers of DF1 cells were infected with 0.2 ml of fresh virus-infected fluid. after 1 h of adsorption, cells were covered with DMEM containing 2% FBS and 0.8% methylcellulose and then incubated at 37\u00b0C. six days later, the cells were stained with crystal violet. 0.05 ml (1:10 dilution) of fresh infective allantoic fluid of each virus was inoculated into groups of 10 1-day-old SPF chicks via the intracerebral route. the birds were observed for clinical symptoms and mortality once every 8 h for a period of 8 days. at each observation, the birds were scored as follows: 0, healthy; 1, sick; or 2, dead. four-week-old chickens were inoculated with 106 PFU of wild-type and N-glycosylation mutant viruses per bird via the occulonasal route. serum samples were collected on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days p.i. the wild-type recombinant BC parent (rBC) had previously been created. this parent was modified to contain a unique PacI site. mutations could readily be introduced into the PacI-MluI fragment bearing the F gene. the single-site mutants were designated Ng1, Ng2, Ng3, Ng4, Ng5, and Ng6, and the one double mutant was designated Ng2 + 5. the sequence of each mutant F gene was confirmed in the final cDNA clones. we were unable to recover a viable virus from the Ng6 clone in several attempts. fected cell lysates were divided into two aliquots. one aliquot was left untreated, and the other was treated with PNGaseF. the protein was efficiently cleaved in the wild-type and all mutant viruses. vero cells were infected with wild-type rBC and N-glycosylation mutant viruses at an MOI of 1, and total proteins were collected after 36 h p.i. samples from rBC, rNg1, rNg2, and rNg3 (A and rBC, rNg4, rNg5 + 5 (B) were digested overnight with PNGaseF. rNg4 and rNg2 + 5 ranged from 15% to 25% above that of the wild-type rBC. cells infected with rNg1 and rNg2 had decreased mean fluorescence intensities of 5% and 7% lower than that of wild-type rBC. the results suggest that all the mutant F proteins retained their ability to be transported efficiently to the cell surface. cells were fixed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. the fusion index was calculated as the ratio of the total number of nuclei in multinuclear cells to the total number of nuclei in the field. mutant viruses rNg1, rNg2, and rNg5 exhibited modestly delayed and reduced growth compared to the parental rBC virus. rNg2 + 5 virus initiated syncytium formation at 18 h p.i. compared to 24 h p.i. for wild-type rBC. rNg2 + 5 virus initiated syncytium formation at 18 h p.i. the pathogenicity of the N-glycosylation mutant viruses and that of their wild-type rBC parent were evaluated by two standard pathogenicity assays. the pathogenicity of the N-glycosylation mutant viruses and that of their wild-type rBC parent were evaluated by two standard pathogenicity assays. rNg2 + 5 double mutant was more virulent than wild-type rBC. lentogenic strains give values approaching 2.0, while lentogenic strains give values close to 0. The ICPI values of the parental rBC, rNg1, rNg2, rNg3, rNg4, rNg5, and rNg2 + 5 viruses were 1.52, 1.16, 1.12, 1.42, 1.48, 1.30, and 1.88, respectively ICPI values for velogenic strains approached the maximum score of 2.00. lentogenic strains gave values close to 0. Values represent the means of the results from three independent experiments. the rNg2 mutant virus was not detected in gut tissue. there were 43%, 64%, and 67% reductions in titers in the brain, lungs, and nasal turbinates compared to those seen with wild-type rBC virus. rNg4 virus replicated to 7% (nasal turbinates), 14% (lungs) and 33% (brain) higher titers compared to wild-type rBC. birds inoculated with the double-mutant rNg2 + 5 virus first exhibited signs of sickness and paralysis at 2 day p.i. by the 6th day p.i., all 10 birds inoculated with the double-mutant rNg2 + 5 virus had died. four-week-old chickens in groups of 5 were inoculated with 106 PFU of virus per bird via the occulonasal route. sera were collected on days 3, 7, and 14 p.i. and analyzed by an NDV-specific ELISA. there were no significant differences in the total NDV-specific serum antibody responses elicited by wild-type rBC virus versus the mutant viruses on the 3rd p.i. the wild-type recombinant BC parent (rBC) had previously been created. this parent contained a unique PacI site in the downstream untranslated region of the M gene. mutations could readily be introduced into the PacI-MluI fragment bearing the F gene. the single-site mutants were designated Ng1, Ng2, Ng3, Ng4, Ng5, and Ng6, and the one double mutant was designated Ng2 + 5. the sequence of each mutant F gene was confirmed in the final cDNA clones. we were unable to recover a viable virus from the Ng6 cDNA in several attempts. aliquot was left untreated, and the other was treated with PNGaseF. the protein was efficiently cleaved in the wild-type and all mutant viruses. mutations of single N-glycosylation sites resulted in faster electrophoretic migration of mutant F1 protein compared to wild-type rBC. Vero cells were infected with wild-type rBC and N-glycosylation mutant viruses at an MOI of 1, and total proteins were collected after 36 h p.i. samples from rBC, rNg1, rNg2, and rNg3 (A) were digested overnight with PNGaseF or kept as untreated controls. d from 15% to 25% above that of the wild-type rBC, while cells infected with rNg1 and rNg2 had decreased mean fluorescence intensities of 5% and 7% lower than that of wild-type rBC. the results suggest that all the mutant F proteins retained their ability to be transported efficiently to the cell surface. eosin examined microscopically to quantify the percentage of nuclei involved in syncytia as the fusion index. rNg1, rNg2, rNg3, rNg4, and rNg5 viruses exhibited a dramatically increased (>12-fold higher) fusion index compared to the wild-type rBC virus. mutant viruses rNg3 and rNg4 replicated faster and attained a much higher titer than the wild-type virus. the double mutant virus rNg2 + 5 initiated syncytium formation at 18 h p.i. compared to 24 h p.i. for wild-type rBC. vero and DF1 cells were infected in duplicate wells of six-well plates with each virus at an MOI of 0.01. pathogenicity of the N-glycosylation mutant viruses and that of their wild-type rBC parent were evaluated. 2 + 5 double mutant was 51 h, indicating an increase in virulence compared to wild-type rBC. lentogenic strains give values approaching 2.0, while lentogenic strains give values close to 0. The ICPI values of the parental rBC, rNg1, rNg2, rNg3, rNg4, rNg5, and rNg2 + 5 viruses were 1.52, 1.16, 1.12, 1.42, 1.48, 1. ICPI values for velogenic strains approached the maximum score of 2.00. lentogenic strains gave values close to 0. values represent the means of the results from three independent experiments. the rNg2 mutant virus replicated at titers in the brain, lungs, and nasal turbinates compared to those seen with wild-type rBC virus. the rNg4 virus replicated to 7% (nasal turbinates), 14% (lungs), and 33% (brain) to 62% (gut) higher titers compared to wild-type rBC. birds inoculated with double-mutant rNg2 + 5 virus first exhibited signs of sickness and paralysis at 2 day p.i. by the 6th day p.i., all 10 birds inoculated with the double-mutant rNg2 + 5 virus had died. four-week-old chickens in groups of 5 were inoculated with 106 PFU of virus per bird via the occulonasal route. sera were collected on days 3, 7, and 14 p.i. and analyzed by an NDV-specific ELISA. in the present study, we examined the role of N-glycosylation of the NDV-BC F glycoprotein in the context of infectious virus. we examined the role of N-glycosylation of the NDV-BC F glycoprotein in the context of infectious virus by using reverse genetics to construct mutants. this study showed that five of the six potential N-glycosylation acceptor sites are utilized, one in the F2 subunit and four in the F1 subunit. deletion of single or multiple N-glycans in the F glycoprotein in the context of whole virus had little effect on cell surface expression of the F protein. these results suggest that no single N-glycan (nor Ng2 and Ng5 together) was essential for NDV-BC F protein transport to the cell surface. the removal of both sites in rNg2 + 5 mutant virus resulted in a hyperfusogenic phenotype (1). it was suggested that the presence of N-glycans on the Nipah virus F protein decreases the rate of six-helix bundle formation, resulting in slower fusion kinetics. significantly higher titers in every sampled tissue, was more virulent in the MDT and ICPI assays, and converted NDV-BC from a nonlethal virus into one that killed all of the inoculated chickens within 6 days. a similar observation was reported earlier for neurovirulent influenza virus strain A/WSN/33 in mice (28, 45) and H5N2 influenza virus in chickens (18) this could be investigated by comparing the immunogenicity of the rNg2 + 5 mutant to that of wild-type BC by the use of UV-inactivated virus. it is possible that other factors were involved, such as greater exposure of epitopes due the loss of shielding glycans or improved antigen processing. glycine residues serve to reduce the efficiency of fusion (15) wild-type Sendai virus also downregulates its fusion activity. correction of this difference results in a virus that replicates more efficiently."}
