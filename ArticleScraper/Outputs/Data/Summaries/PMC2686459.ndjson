{"summary": "eukaryotic cells express a large panel of proteins that co-ordinate to the cellular machinery through a highly connected and regulated network of protein\u2013protein interactions. cellular protein network is not static and its robustness may change dynamically according to various factors like tissue and cell-line origins, signals received by cellular environment or more specifically during viral infections. viruses have developed strategies to hijack central functions of the cell (5\u20137) VirHostNet provides a high-confidence resource of manually curated interactions defined for a wide range of viral species. a cellular network has also been reconstructed from public data and combined with viral data to provide the first draft of the infected cellular network. bioinformatics pipeline was developed to fully integrate virus\u2013virus, virus\u2013host and host\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions gathered from a wide range of public databases. VirHostNet integrates contextual information concerning interacting proteins, like structural and functional annotations of proteins: Gene Ontology term (28), KEGG pathway (29), INTERPRO domain (30). protein cross-referencing led to the definition of non-redundant interactions. all information associated with non-redundant interactions was retrieved in VirHostNet to provide the most documented interactions. literature curation led to the annotation of 2186 redundant interactions in 723 papers. from 2294 PMIDs for which at least one protein\u2013protein interaction was defined, database curation led to the validation of 2261 redundant interactions found in 789 papers. virus\u2013virus, virus\u2013host and host\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions and meta-data related to experimental procedures were extracted from 10 databases (BIND, MINT, INTACT, HPRD, DIP, BIOGRID, REACTOME, HIV-GENERIF, HIV-GENERIF, NETWORKIN) protein cross-referencing led to the definition of non-redundant protein\u2013protein interactions that were defined in different databases, publications or supported by distinct experimental procedures. all information associated with non-redundant interactions, like database origin, experimental procedure description in PSI-MI 2.5 standard format (33) or PUBMED identification (PMID number) were retrieved in VirHostNet to provide the most documented interactions. VirHostNet provides the largest and most confident infected cellular network. the network is composed of 2671 virus\u2013virus and virus\u2013host non-redundant protein\u2013protein interactions concerning 180 distinct viral species. virus\u2013host interactions occurred between 407 viral proteins and 1012 human proteins, suggesting the strong tendency of viruses to interact with a large number of cellular proteins. analysis of KEGG pathways revealed cellular mechanisms poorly documented in the case of viral infections. on 202 protein members of the focal adhesion pathway, more than 25% (59) were significantly targeted by at least one viral protein in 36 distinct viral taxons. this may suggest the central role of focal adhesion during viral infections and its potential impact on viral induced cancer development that might be associated for instance to the loss of cellular adhesion. VirHostNet users can directly query the knowledge base by using a wide range of information concerning viral (e.g. NCBI protein name or accession number) or human proteins (e.g. ENSEMBL gene or protein accession number, NCBI gene name, REFSEQ protein accession number and UNIPROT primary and secondary accession numbers) 'neighbours' button allows users to retrieve all direct protein\u2013protein interactions from a single protein or a list of selected proteins. 'neighbours' button allows users to retrieve all direct protein\u2013protein interactions from a single protein or a list of selected proteins. a subgraph is a graph made of all interactions between a set of proteins. the resulting host\u2013host, virus\u2013host and/or virus\u2013virus protein\u2013protein interactions are then given into a tabulated format in three independent tabbed panels. a colour code highlights interactions that have been checked by VirHostNet experts. mTOR-infection network is composed of 42 cellular interacting proteins (blue nodes), 10 viral proteins (coloured nodes according to viral taxonomy), 84 host\u2013host (blue edges) and 14 virus\u2013host (red edges) physical protein\u2013protein interactions. VirHostNet interface allows identifying viral proteins targeting multiple cellular proteins. VirHostNet users can directly query the knowledge base by using a wide range of information concerning viral (e.g. NCBI protein name or accession number) or human proteins (e.g. ENSEMBL gene or accession number, NCBI gene name, REFSEQ protein accession number and UNIPROT primary and secondary accession numbers) a list of genes or proteins of interest can also be assessed by the mean of contextual information, such as taxonomical information. users are allowed to search for protein\u2013protein interactions according to gene, protein, biological function (GO), pathway (KEGG), protein domain (INTERPRO) or PMID information. 'neighbours' button allows users to retrieve all direct protein\u2013protein interactions from a single protein or a list of selected proteins. a subgraph is a graph made of all interactions between a set of proteins. the resulting host\u2013host, virus\u2013host and/or virus\u2013virus protein\u2013protein interactions are then given into a tabulated format. a colour code highlights interactions that have been checked by VirHostNet experts. mTOR-infection network is composed of 42 cellular interacting proteins (blue nodes), 10 viral proteins (coloured nodes according to viral taxonomy), 84 host\u2013host (blue edges) and 14 virus\u2013host (red edges) physical protein\u2013protein interactions. VirHostNet interface allows users to visualize protein interaction networks associated to any kind of GO term, KEGG pathway. VirHostNet provides a public access to the largest known resource of integrated virus\u2013virus, virus\u2013host and host\u2013host protein interactions. VirHostNet provides a public access to the largest known resource of integrated virus\u2013virus, virus\u2013host and host protein interactions. VirHostNet will allow systematic prediction of virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interologs based on sequence homology criteria. the knowledge-based system is also intended to integrate virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions data derived by our team from high-throughput yeast-two hybrids experiments. access can be made anonymously (by default) or by creating a personal account. on simple request, this personal account allows users to participate to the literature-curation effort. literature-curated and Database-curated protein\u2013protein interactions flat files are available in a tabulated format on request."}
