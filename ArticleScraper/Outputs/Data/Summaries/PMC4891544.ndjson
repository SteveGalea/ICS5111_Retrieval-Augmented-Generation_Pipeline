{"summary": "a 39-year-old woman had reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed MERS-CoV at 35 + 4 weeks of gestation. this patient had gestational-related diabetes, but it was well-controlled by diet without medication. her mother developed illness with fever on day 7 after contacting the super-spreader and was confirmed positive by RT-PCR. baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) was 120\u2013130 bpm with moderate variability. obstetrician diagnosed placental abruption based on symptoms and physical examinations. emergency C-sec under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was scheduled with precautions. the baby was 3.14 kg, with Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min of 9 and 10. a total of 2700 ml of crystalloid solution and 1000 ml of colloid were administered during the surgery. the baby was isolated in the intensive care unit. maternal serum and placenta were MERS-CoV negative. breastfeeding was allowed by pumping instead of sucking. mother and baby are doing well. the patient's sputum was MERS-CoV negative based on RTPCR. the patient had been declared recovered for only 1 day, and illness onset was within 2 weeks. several cases of labor and delivery in women with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been published. the patient was transferred back to the ward by the same dedicated anesthesiologist who changed into new PPE to minimize MERS-CoV exposure. an N95 mask was fit on the patient during the transfer. if a pregnant woman is infectious, they may be able to use it without complications. pregnancy had a favorable outcome for the mother and baby. the reasons for the good outcome are unclear but may be due to the late stage of gestation and earlier detection of MERS. long-term follow-ups of infants and mothers are needed to fully define the pregnancy-related risks of MERS infection."}
