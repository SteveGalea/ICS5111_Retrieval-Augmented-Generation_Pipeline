{"summary": "a number of publications over the past approximately 10 years have explored the question of whether bone marrow (BM)-derived cells could structurally engraft as mature differentiated airway and alveolar epithelial cells. a current consensus is that lung epithelial engraftment is a rare phenomenon of unlikely physiologic significance. epithelial engraftment continues to be rare and remains of unclear physiologic significance. studies suggest rare apparent engraftment of pulmonary interstitium and vasculature after total marrow transplant in a variety of injury models. endogenous adult tissue\u2013specific stem cells are best appreciated as tissue-specific cells that do not self-renew. adult endogenous progenitor cells are best appreciated as tissue-specific cells that do not self-renew but that can differentiate into more specialized cells. a proposed list of terminologies was included in the report of the 2007 conference (3) and is repeated here. characterization and classification of mitotically active putative endogenous stem and progenitor epithelial cells into a hierarchy has been challenging. further lineage-tracing approaches are needed, and there are no available methods to comparably assess lineage hierarchies in putative human lung epithelial stem or progenitor cells. injury models are specific to specific regions of lung epithelium. for example, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide inhalation have been used to study proximal airway stem cells and progenitor cells. bleomycin administration, which specifically injures the alveolar epithelium, has been used to study more distal airway and alveolar regions. basal cells express high levels of the transcription factor Trp63, cytokeratins 5 and 14 and aquaporin 3. basal cells can give rise to Club and ciliated cells in the proximal airways during homeostasis and after sulfur dioxide injury in mice. cell signaling pathways, including -catenin, notch, and tissue factor, appear to regulate function and fate of the basal epithelial cells. similar conclusions have been derived using human proximal airway basal epithelial cells in ex vivo or in vitro culture systems. however, the situation is complex, and there may be subpopulations of basal epithelial cells that have more restricted lineages or specific roles. a population of naphthalene-resistant cells, termed \u201cvariant Club cells\u201d (vCE), was identified in older studies as a bronchiolar stem cell (68) another naphthalene-resistant progenitor cell population located at the bronchoalveolar duct junction have been termed bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) (69) these cells form colonies expressing airway and/or alveolar lineage markers in a three-dimensional coculture matrigel assay with primary lung mesenchymal cells. the latter phenotype contains naphthalene-resistant bronchiolar progenitors. the latter phenotype contains naphthalene-resistant bronchiolar progenitors. bronchiolar stem cells did not play a greater role in normal airway epithelial homeostasis and turnover than did the abundant pool of facultative progenitor Club cells (61) this study suggests that the neuroepithelial body\u2013associated vCE likely function as a reserve population that can function in normal maintenance. the precise role of these pathways in endogenous lung stem and progenitor cells remains to be determined. there are significant differences between the structure and cellular composition of mouse and human lungs. little is known of progenitor cell function in chronic diseases such as emphysema or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. more suggestive information is available for the genetic lung disease cystic fibrosis (CF) the precise role of these pathways in endogenous lung stem and progenitor cells remains to be determined. there are significant differences between the structure and cellular composition of mouse and human lungs. vCE or BASCs have not been identified in human lung tissue. little is known of progenitor cell function in chronic diseases such as emphysema or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. more suggestive information is available for the genetic lung disease cystic fibrosis (CF) lineage relationship between ATI and ATI cells requires further clarification. studies suggest endogenous lung epithelial progenitor cells may be targets for environmental agents. airway stem or progenitor-like cells in mice are susceptible to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza viruses. a list of suggested terminology is illustrated in Table 1 in the accompanying conference report. this is likely to need revision in near future. a number of recent reports implicate CD133+ cells as conferring resistance to chemotherapy and having tumor-initiating properties. e activity or expression of the oncofetal protein 5t4 have also been suggested as a marker for lung cancer stem cells. recent studies have begun elucidating cell signaling and gene expression pathways that may play roles in transformation of endogenous lung progenitor cells into lung cancer cells. a growing number of studies suggest that the effects of matrix proteins, three-dimensional scaffolds, mechanical forces, and culture systems will play critical roles in furthering our understanding of the means by which ESCs and iPSCs might be induced to acquire the phenotype of functional airway and alveolar epithelial cells. little data are available on the development of lung pulmonary vasculature or stroma from cultured ESCs or iPSCs. iPSCs sorted on day 15 based on alveolar epithelial markers T1, pro-surfactant protein C (SPC) and Nkx2\u20131 on cells at the completion of the 25-day directed differentiation protocol. cells reminiscent of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC1) as they lost Nkx2\u20131 nuclear protein expression while expressing T1 protein (A) arrow = flattened nucleus of an Nkx2\u20131 negative cell (purple) lining the

antagonist) and 100 ng/ml Noggin (bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]4 antagonist) there are a growing number of publications assessing the effects of in vivo administration of ESCs or IPS cells. pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, COPD, acute lung injury (ALI), lung cancer, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and obstructive sleep apnea, in children. lack of unique cell surface markers to identify EPCs continues to complicate comparative assessments for pulmonary and other disease processes. hematopoietic stem cells described as potentially contributing to hemogenic vascular endothelium and endothelium contributing to the derivation of hematopoietic lineages. Dysregulation of these processes is increasingly being recognized as contributing to vascular diseases, including pulmonary hypertension, and to pathologic conditions, including asthma. hypoxia appears to be a stimulus for EPC mobilization, whereas hyperoxia is correlated with decreased circulating EPCs, particularly in preterm infants. hypoxia appears to be a stimulus for EPC mobilization and recruitment, whereas hyperoxia is correlated with decreased circulating EPCs. increasing the number of circulating EPCs may not be appropriate for all diseases that affect the lung. neovascularization involves the recruitment of EPCs from the BM and potential contributions from endogenous endothelial cells in the pulmonary vasculature. mechanisms controlling mobilization and homing of EPCs to lung remain poorly understood and are the subject for more intense investigation. potential role of exogenously administered vasculogenic cells shows promise in several types of lung injury. increased circulating EPC numbers correlated with survival in ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increased circulating EPC numbers correlated with survival in ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and were associated with less residual lung damage in patients with pneumonia. increased numbers of circulating EPCs portended worse survival among those with non-small cell lung cancer. increased numbers of circulating EPCs were increased compared with nonasthmatic control subjects. this correlated with increased number and diameter of blood vessels observed in lung tissue biopsies. increasing the number of circulating EPCs may not be appropriate for all diseases that affect the lung, particularly for lung cancers. mechanisms controlling mobilization and homing of EPCs to lung remain poorly understood and are subject for more intense investigation. eNOS or inhibitors of smooth muscle cell proliferation appear to home to sites of endothelial damage and lung injury (146, 151) these findings have generated several clinical investigations of EPC administration in pulmonary hypertension. further elucidation of progenitor cells resident in the vasculature and the role of these and circulating vasculogenic cells in lung development and repair from injury are the focus of extensive current investigation. increased levels of circulating fibrocytes have been suggested to indicate worse prognosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (164, 165) and pulmonary hypertension (163) and in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after lung transplant (166). no studies have definitively proven that fibrocytes can differentiate into fibroblasts in vivo. a recent study has demonstrated that fibrocytes from patients with IPF overexpress periostin, a matricellular protein that can help to activate lysyl oxidase to stiffen extracellular matrices. hAFSCs are obtained from amniotic fluid aspirates and contain a mixed population of mesenchymal, stromal, and epithelial cells. systemic administration of hAFSCs also ameliorated experimentally induced kidney injury in immunodeficient mice. conditioned medium from amniotic fluid-derived MSCs can mitigate bleomycin-induced lung injury. acute inflammatory responses were observed with the use of allogeneic (mouse) or xenogeneic (human) amniotic cells in bleomycin-injured mice. there can be significant differences in MSCs isolated from different species and from different strains within a given species, regardless of the actual tissue source of the MSCs. there is growing evidence that MSCs are heterogeneous and that different MSC subtypes exist. minimal criteria for defining (human) MSCs (214) are being updated. these criteria are being updated given the continued advances in understanding MSC biology. a new framework for understanding and using the nomenclature, definition, and characterization of MSCs has been recently suggested. culture variables, including culture surface composition and stiffness, mechanical forces, temperature, and culture density, can profoundly influence phenotype and behavior of MSCs. hypoxic conditions may be preferable for culturing and manipulating MSCs (221\u2013223) the functional roles of L-MSCs are incompletely understood. growing evidence suggests a role in fibrotic diseases and in pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans after lung transplantation. L-MSCs may influence local inflammatory immune responses in mice. engraftment with MSCs as lung epithelium is rare event of uncertain physiologic significance in lung. some available data suggest systemically administered MSCs can engraft as fibroblasts or myfibroblasts under certain injury conditions. a rapidly growing body of data suggests that release of episomal or microsomal particles by MSCs can influence behavior of the surrounding structural cells and the surrounding inflammatory cells. this can result in replenishment of ATP-depleted recipient cells (247). MSCs express chemokine and cytokine receptors, including those for TNF-, IL-4, IL-17, and IFN-, cytokines increased in different lung injuries. expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules can be altered by exposure to inflammatory mediators commonly found in vivo. hypoxia, characteristic of many lung injuries, can also alter expression of cell surface molecules and secretion of soluble mediators by MSCs. SCs grown under routine tissue culture conditions exhibit low constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. lack of constitutive expression of MHC class II and the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40. administration of non-HLA-matched allogeneic MSCs appears feasible and safe. ovalbumin sensitization and challenge increases the number of L-MSCs in mouse lungs. L-MSC homeostatic regulation and influences on migration, engraftment, and epithelial cell differentiation are also not well understood. engraftment with MSCs as lung epithelium is rare event of uncertain physiologic significance in lung. some available data suggest systemically administered MSCs can engraft as fibroblasts or myfibroblasts under certain injury conditions. some available data suggest that systemically administered MSCs can engraft as fibroblasts. a rapidly growing body of data suggests that release of episomal or microsomal particles by MSCs can influence behavior of the surrounding structural cells and the surrounding inflammatory cells (244\u2013246) this can result in significant changes in immunomodulatory properties and in potential immunogenicity of the MSCs. expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules can be altered by exposure to inflammatory mediators commonly found in vivo. hypoxia, characteristic of many lung injuries and diseases, can also alter MSC expression of cell surface molecules and secretion of soluble mediators by MSCs (221\u2013223) the frequency of MSCs in adult BM is low (0.1%), once isolated from BM or from other tissues, MSCs can be expanded ex vivo. this makes them an attractive potential therapeutic tool as vectors for delivery of disease-specific treatment substances or as immunomodulatory agents. fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, radiation-induced lung injury, sepsis and burns, and other critical illness or autoimmune-related lung injuries. administration of MSCs of BM or placental origin has also been demonstrated to decrease injury and inflammation in endotoxin or bacterially injured injured human lung explants. transduced MSCs overexpressing eNOS, IL-10, KGF, or a CCL2 inhibitor were found to be more effective in preventing monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension, ischemia-reperfusion\u2013induced lung injury, or bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. a growing number of reports suggest that administration of conditioned media obtained from MSCs may mimic many of the ameliorating effects resulting from MSC administration in different lung mouse: OP (IT) BM MSCs Texas (Tulane) MSC Core siTSG-6 knockdown Syn \u2022 Dec histo injury 48 h TSG-6 released by MSCs IMR 90 lung fibroblasts OP MSCs 4 h after LPS \u2022 Dec lung edema 24/48 h. survival 48 h TNF- released from alveolar macrophages stimulates lipocalin release from MSCs 3T3 fibroblasts IT MSCs 4 h after E. coli \u2022 Dec histo injury 48 h \u2022 Did not mimic any results P 5\u201310. mutants and those treated with siRISP MSCs 4 h after LPS 2) MSCs treated with siRISP \u2022 Form connexin 43 bridges to type 2 cells \u2022 Did not mimic results 3T3 fibroblasts: down-regulated Cx43 expression P 2 \u2022 Improved lung (type 2) ATP 106 cells/mouse \u2022 Improved surfactant production \u2022 Dec histo injury, albumin leak, BAL inflamm cells Krasnodembskaya, 2012 (29 BM-MSCs Lee, 2013 (303) Explant human lung IT E. coli Human BM MSCs Texas (Tulane) MSC Core No Allo MSCs 1 h after LPS mimicked effects Normal human lung fibroblasts did not mimic effects IT or IV MSCs or 1 h after LPS. ova aerosol 3 d/wk for 8 wk MSCs IV Day 75. some dec in histo injury P 2 1 106 cells/mouse Harvest Day 82 (engraftment\") and Day 89 (lung assessment) splenocyte IL-13, IL-10 Lee, 2011 (270) Mouse toluene disocyanate inhalation induced acute airways inflammation MSCs IV Day Rat BM MSCs and adherent cells CD44+, CD45+ No Xeno. splenocyte IL-13, IL-10 Lee, 2011 (270) CM mimics decrease in BAL total cells and PMNs MSC-conditioned medium on all challenge days.

ALI Sprague-Dawly rat BM MSCs No Syn. a growing body of evidence suggests that MSCs ameliorate allergic airways inflammation in mice by increasing T-regulatory cells or by promoting a Th1 phenotype in vivo in antigen-specific CD4 T cells as a means of abrogating Th2-mediated lung injury. many of the studies discussed above used different preparations of MSCs. these ranged from populations of heterogenous plastic adherent adipose stromal cells to purified, well-characterized BM-derived MSCs obtained from core facilities such as the NCRR/NIH sponsored Texas (formerly Tulane) center for preparation and distribution of adult Stem Cells (MSCs) a recent head-to-head comparison of human MSCs suggests that human MSCs may be less effective in immune-competent mice. however, continued rigor must be applied to understand the mechanisms of MSC effects when comparing MSCs isolated by different protocols and obtained from different sources. BM-derived mononuclear cells are harvested, prepared, and administered even on the same day. it is unclear whether BM mononuclear cells harvested from individuals with different lung diseases will be appropriately functional for use in mitigating a specific lung injury. the different published reports suggest potential paracrine or immunomodulatory effects as the primary mechanisms of action. it is unclear why or how these cells would have immunomodulatory effects, and much further characterization and clarification is required. significant progress continues to be made with trachea using synthetic scaffolds and decellularized donor tracheas. the use of decellularized lungs for growing alveolar cells in culture was first described 25 years ago. the decellularized lungs can be mechanically ventilated and undergo vascular perfusion to provide more physiologic study of ex vivo lung generation. a follow-up study showed more prolonged survival of rats implanted with decellularized lungs recellularized with a mix of fetal lung and human vascular endothelial cells. after 2 weeks, the implanted lungs had developed extensive inflammatory and consolidative changes. this includes the source of the lung, the type of cell(s) to be inoculated, the use of bioreactor culture systems and other environmental considerations. storage and sterilization conditions used for decellularized lungs may significantly affect the composition and architecture of the decellularized scaffold and the ability of inoculated cells to survive, proliferate, and differentiate. cadaveric lungs, as opposed to those obtained from organ donors, will also be useful. embryonic stem cells, adult BM-derived MSCs, lung progenitor cells, and fetal lung homogenates have been inoculated into decellularized lungs. the combination of cells used, the order of inoculation, the route of inoculation, and subsequent environmental conditions for optimal growth and differentiation have yet to be worked out. mechanical forces in utero are generated by rhythmic contractions of the respiratory muscles. this normal movement is essential in the development of fetal lung, differentiation of ATII cells, and synthesis of surfactant protein. a number of in vitro studies have demonstrated that application of cyclic mechanical stretch to cultures of mixed fetal rodent lung cells increases SPC mRNA expression compared with cells cultured under static conditions. ane chips can mimic alveolar architecture and can be used to study pathophysiologic processes. nanoparticles and bacteria enter the lungs and may also be useful for high-throughput screening of drugs. the field is ripe for further comparable technologic advances in bioengineering approaches for lung regeneration. one commercial preparation of MSCs has recently been approved in canada for use in refractory pediatric graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) this is the first licensed MSC-based cell therapy product to be accessible for approved clinical use. no significant infusion-related toxicities or short-term adverse effects. no mortality or serious adverse events attributable to the infusions were observed over a subsequent 2-year follow-up period. no improvement in efficacy outcomes, including pulmonary functions, 6-minute-walk evaluation, quality of life questionnaires, or physician\u2019s global assessment, were observed. more acute inflammatory lung or systemic diseases (e.g., ARDS or sepsis/septic shock) or chronic immune-mediated lung diseases may be better targets (251\u2013258) clinical trials of MSCs for ARDS and for septic shock are in progress or in development in the united states and in the united states. a recent review of autopsies of 18 patients with GVHD who had received systemic MSC administration found evidence of microemboli in only one patient (401) this patient was critically ill with ARDS and had disseminated intravascular coagulation at the time of death. no clinical signs or symptoms of pulmonary emboli were observed in the patients with COPD participating in the phase II trial discussed above. a case in point is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. a case in point is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. a case in point is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. statements against stem cell medical tourism on their respective websites (7). the author thanks Jason Bates, Daniel Chambers, Thomas Gilbert, darrell Kotton, Conrad Liles, Carolyn Lutzko, Bethany Moore, Darwin Prockop, Jay Rajagopal, and Mervin Yoder for careful reading and suggestions."}
