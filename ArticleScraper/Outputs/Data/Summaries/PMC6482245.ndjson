{"summary": "human torovirus (HToV) is used to be the member of the Torovirus genus. equine torovirus (EToV) is used to be the member of the genus. unclassified virus, BToV, was discovered in 1982 in calves with diarrhea in Breda, Iowa. the isolate was infectious when orally inoculated into gnotobiotic and conventionally reared calves. in 1984, a similar virus was found in the feces of diarrheic patients in England and the united states. PToV Genome ToV genomes are nonsegmented, polyadenylated, and 25\u201330 kb in size. both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the genome have a non-translated region (NTR) and the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the toV genome contains two large, overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a [13,254 bp] and ORF1b [6,875 bp]) the mature toV S protein contains two functional domains, S1 and S2, which mediate receptor specificity and determine viral tropism. the cleavage site, composed of five consecutive arginine residues, plays a role in post-translational processing in vivo. there are structural features in common with other coronavirus S proteins. virions can theoretically migrate through the mucus layer. the viral genome binding to the phosphorylated N protein is the only viral RNA binding protein. this 18.7 kDa protein is the most abundant protein among the ToV virions. the gene encoding HE had 80\u201395% identity to other PToV strain sequences in GenBank. the N and M genes were 95 and 93\u201397%, respectively, indicating that HE is more diverse among PToV strains. all of the novel sichuan strains belonged to genotype I. porcine enterovirus G (EV-G) genome with insertion of toV papain-like cysteine protease gene (PLCP) was detected in the feces of diarrheal pigs from farms in the united states, Belgium, Japan, China, and south Korea. inserted PLCP sequences had lengths varied in strains from different geographical locations, ranging from 194 to 223 amino acids. PToV Genome ToV genomes are nonsegmented, polyadenylated, and 25\u201330 kb in size. both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the genome have a non-translated region (NTR) and the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the toV genome contains two large, overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a [13,254 bp] and ORF1b [6,875 bp]) connected by a frame coronavirus M proteins have three transmembrane -helices in its N-terminal part. this protein lacks a cleavage signal sequence, so it is suspected that one of the hydrophobic transmembrane domains acts as an internal signal sequence (24). the HE protein is distributed on the virion surface as small projections. the open torus-shaped core of ToV is formed by the viral genome binding to the phosphorylated N protein. this 18.7 kDa protein is the most abundant protein among the ToV virions. the genetic diversity of PToV in three Korean farms was studied in 2010. the M gene sequences of 19 novel PToV strains from Sichuan, China and 21 ToV strains in GenBank could be classified into two genotypes (I & II) all of the novel Sichuan strains belonged to genotype I along with two Korean sequences (GU-07-56-11 and GU-07-56-22), while all other representative Korean, Netherlands and Canadian strains from GenBank belonged to genotype II. porcine enterovirus G (EV-G) genome with insertion of toV papain-like cysteine protease gene (PLCP) was detected in the feces of diarrheal pigs from farms in the united states, Belgium, Japan, China, and south Korea (33\u201338) the inserted PLCP sequences had lengths varied in strains from different geographical locations, ranging from 194 to 223 amino acids. the only method available for serological diagnosis of PToV is an indirect ELISA based on a recombinant His-tagged N protein expressed in a baculovirus system. serum samples (n = 15) from 6 to 8 week-old healthy piglets tested by this method obtained a positive rate of 100%. the positive rates when tested by western blot and neutralization assay of EToV virions were 60% (9/15) and 93% (14/15), respectively (10 RT-LAMP method based on 4 specific primers from the N gene was developed for the quick detection of PToV. worldwide distribution of PToV has been proven, with a high infection rate in pigs. however, due to limitations of diagnostic assays and asymptomatic infections, there are not many reports on epidemiology. RT-PCR targeting the S gene was used to test stool and intestinal samples of diarrheic piglets from 20 farms in southwest china collected in the winter of 2011. 7 of those 9 farms had mixed infection with other swine viruses including PEDV, PKV, porcine rotavirus group A (PRV-A), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), PAstV and mammalian orthoreovirus (12). limited studies of sequence diversity may impede development of accurate diagnostic assays and vaccine production. a lack of study of the variability of the S gene also limits our understanding of the serology of PToV."}
