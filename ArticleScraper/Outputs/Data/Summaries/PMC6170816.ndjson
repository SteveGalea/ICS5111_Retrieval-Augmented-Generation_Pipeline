{"summary": "foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a non-enveloped virus with positive-sense and single-stranded RNA genome. the viral genome is approximately 8.5 kb nucleotides in length. the polyprotein is subsequently processed by viral proteases during protein synthesis. these viral proteins have acquired many functions to counteract host antiviral responses. different pathways have been identified that participate in EGR1 induction and then regulate several biological behaviors. the Ras homologue gene family (Rho) genes are involved in cell cycle progression. the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway has been shown to regulate EGR1 expression. a robust EGR1 upregulation was observed in both wildtype and SAP mutant FMDV-infected cells comparing with the mock-infected cells. a robust EGR1 upregulation was observed in both wildtype and wildtype FMDV-infected cells. this study reveals a link between EGR1 and innate immune response during FMDV infection. all the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. anti-FMDV VP1 protein polyclonal antibody was previously produced in our laboratory. transfection reagents include OPTI-MEM medium and the Lipofectamine 2000. the quantification of the cDNA was performed by qPCR. the relative amounts of the synthesized cDNA was determined as an indicator of the target transcripts. qPCR was carried out using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) the lysed cell extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall) the membrane was then blocked with 10% skim milk powder in TBST (20 mM Tris, 55 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4\u00b0C. cells were co-transfected with 100 ng luciferase reporter plasmid with 10 ng internal control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. cells were mock-infected or infected with SeV (100HAU/mL) for 16 h. luciferase activity was expressed as arbitrary units by normalizing firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. cell lines, Viruses and Reagents Porcine kidney PK-15 cells, human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) cells described previously were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. all the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. polyclonal antibody was previously produced in our laboratory. transfection reagents include OPTI-MEM medium and Lipofectamine 2000. plasmids were cloned into pcDNATM3.1/myc-His(-)A vector. the quantification of the cDNA was performed by qPCR. the relative amounts of the synthesized cDNA was determined as an indicator of the target transcripts. the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was used for normalization in qPCR analysis. the lysed cell extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall) the membrane was then blocked with 10% skim milk powder in TBST (20 mM Tris, 55 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4\u00b0C. cells were co-transfected with 100 ng luciferase reporter plasmid with 10 ng internal control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. luciferase activity was expressed as arbitrary units by normalizing firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. PK-15 cells were infected by equal amounts of wildtype or SAP mutant FMDV for 12 h. expression levels of EGR1 and viral VP1 protein were detected by Western blotting. the correlation between FMDV infection and EGR1 was further investigated. PK-15 cells were infected with wildtype FMDV for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 h. expression levels of EGR1 and VP1 protein were detected by qPCR. PK-15 cells were transfected with different doses of EGR1 expressing plasmids. PK-15 cells were transfected with EGR1 siRNA-1819. the cells were infected with FMDV at 48 hpt and incubated for another 12 or 16 h. knockdown of EGR1 significantly increased VP1 protein expression. PK-15 cells were transfected with NC siRNA or EGR1 siRNA-1819 for 48 h. the cells were infected with FMDV for 0, 12, or 16 h. both EGR1 expression and type I IFN signaling were enhanced in SAP mutant FMDV-infected cells. this implied a link between EGR1 and type I IFN pathway. transcripts of IFN-, ISG15 and MX1 were detected by qPCR. HEK293T cells were transfected with vector plasmids or Myc-EGR1 plasmids and solvent control or Poly. expression of ISG15 and ISG54 expression was measured by qPCR. transcripts of IFN-, ISG15 and MX1 were detected by qPCR. expression levels were detected by qPCR. overexpression of EGR1 significantly promoted type I IFN signaling. overexpression of EGR1 significantly promoted SeV-induced type I IFN expression. the transcript levels of IFN-, ISG15 and MX1 remarkably decreased in EGR1 knockdown cells compared with that in NC siRNA cell. these results suggested a positive regulatory role of EGR1 on type I IFN signaling. luciferase activity was measured at 24 h after transfection. overexpression of adaptor proteins RIG-I, RIG-I(CARD), MDA5), VISA, TBK1, IRF3 or IRF7 all activated the ISRE luciferase reporter system. TBK1 or its upstream proteins (RIG-I, MDA5 and VISA) mediated type I IFN signaling was significantly enhanced by overexpression of EGR1. the coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed by co-transfection of the myc-EGR1 plasmids and the plasmids expressing various HA-tagged adaptors of type I IFN pathway. the transfectants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and subjected to Western blotting analysis. no interaction was observed between EGR1 and the adaptors. PK-15 cells were transfected with 2 g of empty vector or Myc-EGR1 expressing plasmids. the cells were infected with equal amounts of FMDV at 24 hpt. expression of myc-EGR1, p-TBK1 (phosphorylated TBK1), TBK1, VP1 and -Actin were detected. EGR1 suppresses FMDV replication independent of its transcriptional activity. PK-15 cells were mock-infected or infected with FMDV for 12 h. localization of EGR1 was detected by Western blotting. HEK293T and PK-15 cells were incubated with IFN- to induce the expression of IFN inducible genes. expression of two IFN inducible genes ISG15 and ISG54 was highly induced by incubation of IFN-. this indicated that EGR1 expression was not induced by IFN- treatment. however, FMDV infection could induce EGR1 expression. the viral protein and viral RNA expression level was measured at 12 hpi. overexpression of EGR1 significantly suppressed both the viral protein expression and viral RNA replication. PK-15 cells were transfected with the NC siRNA or EGR1 siRNA for 48 h. PK-15 cells were transfected with 0, 0.5, 1, or 2 g of Myc-EGR1. empty vector plasmids were used in all transfection experiments. the cells were infected with 0.5 MOI of FMDV at 24 hpt. hpi were measured by TCID50 assay. P 0.01 was considered statistically significant. previous study indicates SAP mutant FMDV infection induces higher expression of IFN- and ISGs than wildtype FMDV. HEK293T cells were transfected with vector plasmids or Myc-EGR1 plasmids. transfected cells were mock-infected or infected with SeV for 16 h. transcripts of IFN-, ISG15 and MX1 were detected by qPCR. HEK293T cells were transfected with NC siRNA or EGR1 siRNA-1819 for 48 h. the cells were then mock-infected or infected with SeV for 16 h. transcripts of IFN-, ISG15 and MX1 were detected by qPCR. the role of EGR1 on type I IFN signaling was further evaluated. overexpression of EGR1 significantly promoted poly (I:C)-induced type I IFN signaling. the expression of poly (I:C)-induced ISGs was also measured. TBK1 or its upstream proteins (RIG-I, MDA5 and VISA) EGR1 enhanced type I IFN signaling. overexpression of adaptor proteins RIG-I, RIG-I(CARD), MDA5(Helicase) and VISA, TBK1, IRF3 or IRF7 all activated the ISRE luciferase reporter system. IRF3 and IRF7 are the downstream proteins of TBK1. TBK1 or its upstream molecules (RIG-I, MDA5 and VISA) were the target/target of EGR1 to enhance type I IFN signal transduction. PK-15 cells were transfected with 2 g of empty vector or Myc-EGR1 expressing plasmids. the cells were infected with equal amounts of FMDV at 24 hpt. the cells were collected at 0, 6, 12, or 18 hpi and subjected to Western blotting analysis. PK-15 cells were transfected with vector, Myc-EGR1 plasmids or cotransfected with Myc-EGR1 and Myc-ZnEGR1 plasmids and subjected to FMDV infection. overexpression of EGR1 suppressed FMDV replication, and EGR1-mediated antiviral effect was not blocked by cotransfection with ZnEgr1. these data suggest that the transcriptional activity is not involved in the antiviral induction of TGF1 and p53 may lead to the tumor suppressor property of EGR1. p53-dependent antiviral defense has been widely reported. porcine EGR1 is linked to viral pathogenesis during VEEV, MHV and EV71 replication. most of these viruses can cause central nervous system (CNS) diseases. however, EGR1 has been suggested to participate in IFN--STAT1 pathway in T cells. overexpression of EGR1 significantly activated type I IFN signaling and IFN- and ISGs expression. a link between EGR1 and type I IFN pathway was reported for the first time. phosphatases should be studied in future. the effect of EGR1 on the adaption of other upstream molecules of TBK1 should also be exploited."}
