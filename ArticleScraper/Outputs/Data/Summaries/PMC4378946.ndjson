{"summary": "study was conducted to elucidate the burden of community-onset pneumonia (COP) and its etiologic fractions in the world\u2019s most aged society. all pneumonia patients aged 15 years, including those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), were enrolled at four community hospitals on four major islands. 1.9 million adults aged 15 years die from lower respiratory infections every year. the risks of pneumonia and pneumonia-related death are highest among the elderly. the disease is now ranked as the third cause of death in the country. prospective multicenter surveillance of adult community-onset pneumonia covered four major islands in Japan. the study objectives were to establish the age group- and etiology-specific incidences of pneumonia at a population level and to estimate the burden of pneumonia in the entire adult population. one hospital is located on each of the four main islands. 70% of the medical costs for people aged 70 years and 80\u201390% of the medical costs for people aged 70 years are covered, regardless of whether the individual is treated in the private or public sector. sputum samples were examined using in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. three typical bacterial pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis), three atypical bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila) were tested using multiplex PCR. the prevalence of aspiration-associated pneumonia was defined independent of microbiological profiles. the prevalence of aspiration-associated pneumonia was calculated separately from those of pathogen-specific category. population in age group i, prefecture j, and facility type k (k = 1, hospitals; k = 2, clinics) ijk was obtained from the patient survey conducted by the MHLW in 2011 [23]. proportion of pneumonia cases among outpatients in hospitals ( ij1) was calculated from the surveillance data. the total population in japan was 127 million in 2013 [7] of this population, 25.1% were 65 years of age, and 3.6% were 85 years of age. the cost of PPV23 was partially or fully subsidized by the local government. pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) scan films consistent with pneumonia. all eligible cases were classified into CAP and HCAP groups according to the definitions in the ATS/IDSA guideline. repeated episodes of pneumonia in the same patient within a 2-week period were regarded as a single episode. influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus [HRV], human parainfluenza virus [HPIV] types 1\u20134, human rhinovirus [HRV], human coronavirus [HCoV] 229E/OC43, human bocavirus [hadV] and bocavirus were tested using different sets of multiplex PCR. details about the primers and PCR methods have been described previously [19, 20] prevalence of aspiration-associated pneumonia calculated separately from pathogen-specific category. age group specific incidence rates of pneumonia, hospitalization and death in the four prefectures were estimated using the surveillance data and the national statistics. a total of 932,080 patients visited the study hospitals. a total of 1,935 of these patients were enrolled in the study. a total of 932,080 patients visited the study hospitals. 562 (32%) 111 (22%) 451 (36%) 85 years and older 450 (25%) 54 (11%) 396 (31%) HCAP 572 (32%) 47 (9%) 525 (41%) P0.001 With underlying diseases 1,609 (91%) 389 (77%) 1220 (96%) P0.001 With aspiration-associated conditions 677 (38.2%) 52 (10%) 625 (49%) P0.001 Current/ex-smoker, n = 1,0 H. influenzae was the most common bacterial pathogen isolated (10%), followed by S. pneumoniae (9%).

HRV was the leading virus identified, followed by InfA and RSV. among 717 sputum samples tested, 105 (15%) were both positive. the incidence rate was highest in Kochi (22.8 per 1,000 PY) and lowest in Chiba (13.7 per 1,000 PY) the rate was higher in males than in females (15.6 vs 9.3 per 1,000 PY in all age groups; 120.6 vs 36.4 per 1,000 PY in people aged 85 years). it was lowest in those aged 35\u201344 years (4.5 per 1,000 PY), increased sharply with age, and became highest in the population aged 85 years (79.3 per 1,000 PY; 4.7 (1.1 to 2.5) 1.4 (1 to 2) 2.5 (1.8 to 3.4) 6.5 (5.1 to 8) 16.9 (14 to 20.3) 43.4 (37.1 to 50.6) 75.4 (62.4 to 90.7) 11.8 (9.7 to 14.3) 5.7 (4.5 to 7.2) Outpatient 4.4 (2.9 to 6.3) 4.1 (2.7 to 5.9) 3.1 (2.1 to 4.4) 3.5 (2.5 to 4.8) 5.3 (4.2 to 6.6) 7.7 (6.4 to 9. 5.7 (4.7 to 6.9) 2.5 (2 to 3.1) S pneumoniae-associated, maximum estimate 1.1 (0.7 to 1.6) 0.8 (0.6 to 1.2) 0.9 (0.6 to 1.3) 1.6 (1.1 to 2.2) 3.8 (3 to 4.8) 8.7 (7.2 to 10.4) 16.9 (14.5 to 19.7) 15.7 (13 to 18.9) 4.7 (3.9 to 5.8) 2.6 (2 to 3.3) S pneumoniae-associated, standard estimate 1 (0.6 to 1.4) 0.9 (0.6 Positivity was defined when a sputum culture or sputum PCR showed a positive result. a sputum culture or sputum PCR showed a positive result. a sputum culture or sputum PCR showed a positive result. the incidence among the male population is shown as a solid line. the incidence among the female population is shown as a dashed line. the 95% confidence intervals for each point are shown as vertical lines. in 2012, the overall incidence of community-onset pneumonia, including CAP and HCAP, among people aged 15 years was 16.9 per 1,000 PY. the incidence sharply increased with age and reached up to 79.3 per 1,000 PY among people aged >85 years. 75% of our pneumonia cases were examined with CT scans to diagnose pneumonia. the proportion of severe cases (CURB65 score 3) in the current study was 30%, compared with 38% in the united kingdom and 10% in the united kingdom [29] and 10% in Spain [30] 25.4% of CAP and 64.3% of HCAP cases were associated with aspiration. effective clinical management and preventive measures targeting aspiration-associated pneumonia remain underdeveloped. pneumococcal pneumonia remains the leading target for pneumonia control programs in Japan. PPV23 reduces the risk of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs) among adults. the vaccine covers only 13 serotypes of pneumococcus, and its long-term effects remain unknown. the burden of pneumonia is higher in older people, and the pneumonia etiology largely varies by age group. the current etiology-specific approach (i.e., vaccinations for pneumococcus and influenza, guidelines for appropriate antibiotics use) must have only a limited impact. the definition of pneumonia differs from setting to setting. some studies have reported incidences of CAP that include outpatients and hospitalized patients [25, 30, 49], while others have reported hospitalized cases only [28, 48] etiology-specific burden estimates must be confirmed using multi-year surveillance data. aspiration was the leading etiology of pneumonia, followed by S. pneumoniae. 75% of our pneumonia cases were examined with CT scans to diagnose pneumonia. the proportion of severe cases in the current study was 30%, compared with 38% in the united kingdom [29] and 10% in the united kingdom [30]. Considering the higher incidence of childhood pneumonia among males, they may be genetically vulnerable to pneumonia. 25.4% of CAP and 64.3% of HCAP cases were associated with aspiration. effective clinical management and preventive measures targeting aspiration-associated pneumonia remain underdeveloped. 85% of IPD isolates were PPV23 serotypes, and 62% were PCV13 serotypes. the vaccine covers only 13 serotypes of pneumococcus, and its long-term effects remain unknown. PPV23 reduces the risk of invasive pneumococcal diseases among adults. a substantial proportion of pneumonia was associated with RVs (23% of all pneumonia cases) RVs such as influenza, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cause outbreaks among the elderly in nursing homes [45, 46] some studies have reported incidences of CAP that include outpatients and hospitalized patients [25, 30, 49, 49], while others have reported hospitalized cases only [28, 48], respectively. the diagnosis of pneumonia is not standardized in clinical settings; the burden estimates based on existing database are unreliable. iology-specific burden estimates must be confirmed using multi-year surveillance data. aspiration-associated pneumonia was defined based on the presence of known risk factors. there is no reliable marker to identify aspiration. data dictionary file of database of community-onset pneumonia cases."}
