{"summary": "vero cells and IPEC-J2 cells were treated with different concentrations of dynasore at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. CCK-8 solution was added to each well at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. absorptions of 450 nm were detected; DMSO was used as a negative control. cells were seeded in 12-well plates until confluence. double-distilled water was used as a negative control. cells were collected at 9 hpi and detected by immunofluorescence staining against the PEDV S protein (green). m. 13567_2020_739_MOESM5_ESM.tif (22.8MB, tif) Additional file 5. PEDV entry relies on cholesterol and caveolin-1. Vero cells (A, B) and IPEC-J2 cells (B) were treated with different concentrations of NH4Cl and Baf A1 at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. the second transfection was carried out at 24 h after the first transfection."}
