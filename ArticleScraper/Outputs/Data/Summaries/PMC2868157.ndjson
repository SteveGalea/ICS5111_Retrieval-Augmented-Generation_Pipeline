{"summary": "the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes economically important upper respiratory and urogenital tract diseases in chickens. it causes tracheal rales, sneezing, coughing, reduced weight gain, and reduced egg production. the genome of IBV consists of a single-stranded sense RNA genome encoding four structural proteins. polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism (RT-PCR-RFLP) was performed using RT-PCR. amplified S1 genes were classified by RFLP analysis and cloned, sequenced and compared to other non-korean published IBV sequences. the RT reaction for synthesis of cDNA consisted of purified RNA, 20 pmol S1 OLIGO3' or degenerate 3'-2 primer and RT PreMix AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer, Korea) the mixture was heated for 5 min at 94\u00b0C to stop the reaction. the predicted size of the PCR products was about 1,720 bp. Purified PCR products were then cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA) the cells carrying recombinant plasmids were selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing ampicillin, X-gal and IPTG. plasmid DNA for sequencing was prepared using the E.Z.N.A plasmid miniprep Kit I. Viruses Twelve IBVs were isolated and propagated from the kidney, trachea and cecal tonsil of suspected IB carriers between 2001 and 2003 using embryonated SPF chicken eggs according to the standard procedure. the history of these isolates is shown in Table 1. 20 pmol each primer and cDNA were added to the AccuPower PCR PreMix (Bioneer, Korea) the PCR reaction was performed with 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 90 sec, annealing at 45\u00b0C for 30 sec, polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 90 sec and a final polymerization step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Sequence analysis Nucleotide sequence data were compiled and analyzed using the Clustal V method in MegAlign software (DNA Star, USA) a phylogenetic tree for the S1 glycoprotein was generated using the maximum parsimony method with 100 bootstrap replicates in a heuristic search with the PAUP 4.0 software program. three of the Korean IBVs (K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03) generated an identical but variant RFLP pattern. RFLP patterns of the PCR-amplified S1 glycoprotein genes from representative Korean IBV isolates digested with restriction enzyme Hae III. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of those IBV isolates were determined. the deduced amino acid sequences of Korean IBVs were aligned with the sequences of published Korean and non-Korean strains. most variations were observed among residues 53-96, 115-163 and 268-398 (numbering is with reference to the Mass41 strain). RT-PCR-RFLP The initial classification of the IBV isolates was accomplished by RT-PCR-RFLP analysis. six of the twelve isolates had the same RFLP pattern as the IBV KM91 strain, which was isolated in 1991 in Korea. Korean IBVs had nucleotide sequence identities of between 71.2% and 99.7% with each other and between 45.9% (DE072 and K2-6) and 80.7% (BEAU and K044-02) with non-Korean IBVs. KM91 type was the most common or representative genotype III among the five genotypes. KM91 was associated with 50% mortality, severe nephritis and renal urate deposits in the kidneys of infected chicks. the other strains caused respiratory distress one to two days after inoculation. 10 of 15 IBVs produced RFLP patterns corresponding to the IBV KM91 strain. half of the 12 Korean IBV isolates (K748-01, K044-02, K058-02, K117-02, K234-02, and K514-03) were classified as belonging to the KM91 type by RFLP analysis. differences in genetic composition might still exist that could affect their behavior under field conditions. isolates K434-01, K545-02 and K2-6 were clustered into the Ark99 group. phylogenetic tree analysis revealed various RFLP patterns. evolution of IBV appears to be influenced by many factors."}
