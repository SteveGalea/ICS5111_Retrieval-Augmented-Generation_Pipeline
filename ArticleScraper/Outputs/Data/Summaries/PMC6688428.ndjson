{"summary": "human viral pathogens number in the hundreds, with thousands of possible strains, and clinically used proxies for risk of viral infection. preformed antibodies from the recipient continue to circulate, with an average half-life of 26 days. cytomegalovirus (CMV) impacts clinical outcomes, including death. sample size was predetermined as the maximum number of donor/recipient sample suites that could be sequenced alongside the VirScan library in a single flow cell. all patients provided signed consent for use of leftover biologic materials. VirScan was performed according to the previously published method. Statistical analysis To call positive responses to viruses, we augmented the originally described methods of thresholding epitope hits. we used the higher of either the empiric threshold described previously15 or else a total of at least 3 hits, one of which required to be a public epitope for viruses for which \u201cpublic epitopes\u201d had been previously identified. we modeled the distance between each donor and recipient pair, longitudinally over time, from baseline through day 365 (d365) we performed pairwise comparisons of the distance between the D/R pairs\u2019 antiviral repertoire pre-HCT (pre-D vs pre-R), with that at later time points, and last, compared pre-R vs d365. disease 7 (19) Cell source* Bone marrow 11 (30) Peripheral blood 27 (73) Treatment year 1999-2003 33 (89) 2012-2013 4 (13) CMV serostatus of pair D+/R+ 21 (57) D+/R 8 (22) D/R+ 5 (14) D/R 3 (8) Previous treatment regimens Anti-CD20 3 (8) Lymphodepletion 13 (35) Intensive chemotherapy (any) 19 (51) Conditioning regimen Bu/Cy, + to document changes in individual antiviral responses over time, we categorized each donor-recipient pair into 4 combinatorial groups (R/D, R/D+, R+/D, R+/D+) for each of the 58 viruses with public epitopes. the pair could belong to a different group for each individual virus. we first quantified total IgG from each sample using the human IgG ELISA Quantitation Set (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc, Montgomery, TX) we mixed the phage library with sufficient volume of serum to provide 2 g of IgG in each of 2 replicates per sample. a number of new metrics were developed to describe the viral antibody repertoire. a divergence measure was applied to measure the distance between each donor and recipient pair, longitudinally over time, from baseline through day 365 (d365) we modeled this distance over time using a linear mixed-effects model. Observations within 15 weeks (4 half-lives)4 of documented receipt of IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) were censored for this analysis. the presence of GVHD was adjudicated by national institutes of health criteria and disease severity by center for international blood & Marrow Transplant Research criteria. anticancer or lymphodepleting agents given within 12 mo prior to HCT were considered. rituximab, fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, or cycloporin/ifosphamide were considered. the median age of HCT recipients and donors was similar at 47 years (interquartile range [IQR] 39.5, 54) and 48 years (IQR 36, 55), respectively. median IgG quantitation was highest in donors and decreased from pre-R through d365 to 1.30 106 ng/mL (IQR 0.73, 1.83; supplemental Figure 1). serostatus shows predictable gain of CMV epitopes over time in pairs with CMV-seronegative donors and seropositive recipients (D/R+, D+/R+, D+/R+) and minimal detectable CMV epitopes over time when both members of the pair were CMV-seronegative (D/R+) the maximum post-HCT responses were at d30 or d100 and were weakest at d365. threshold of 6 VirScan epitopes performs optimally against clinical serology. each quantitative antigenemia value is depicted by a purple dot and daily steroid dose by the orange line. the Simpson\u2019s D score (mean 0.10, SD = 0.04) showed high diversity within each individual. Shannon\u2019s evenness scores (mean 0.80, SD 0.05; scoring 0-1.0, directly proportional to value) showed high equality in distribution of epitopes within each individual. -distance = 0.390, P =.06 compared with pre-HCT. but this trend reversed by d365 ( = 0.407), at which point D/R community-level differences were not different from pre-HCT, P =.76. in addition, the mean -distance between pre-R and d365 was 0.321 (SD = 0.08), meaning that, 1 year after HCT, the antiviral repertoire is more similar to pre-HCT recipients of middle-aged donors had the highest scores compared with 40 or >55 year olds for total (P =.03) and non-CMV epitopes (P =.02) as well as total viruses. donor age more highly predicted d100 scores compared with younger and older donors and recipients. trend toward recipient age predicting non-CMV epitopes at d365 with significant differences between age 40-55 and >55. CMV serostatus also was associated with many repertoire metrics. CMV status of donor or recipient no longer influences total viral epitopes recognized. at d365, higher total B-cell counts were associated with a trend toward more evenness and higher diversity of the repertoire. n = 3; 0.5-1 mg/kg, n = 3; >1 mg/kg, n = 1. at d365, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Sex did not predict total virus score or diversity scores. the largest epitope gains were seen for human herpesviruses and adenoviruses. significant epitope gains were seen toward acute respiratory or gastrointestinal viral pathogens that are common post-HCT. oster virus; HHV-4 = Epstein-Barr virus; HHV-5 = cytomegalovirus; HHV6A/B, 7 = roseolaviruses. for pairs that were D+/R for any given viruses, there was no net gain or loss of epitopes. hCT pairs with recipients who reactivated CMV in first 100 days after hematopoietic cell transplantation showed heterogeneity in response to CMV-specific epitopes between pre- and post-reactivation (d100) samples in 8 pairs (43%), including in 3 of 4 D pairs, who should have had no preexisting contribution of donor-derived CMV immunity. participants with seronegative donors (D) are also stratified by CMV reactivation (purple; n = 4) or no reactivation (red; n = 4) there was a trend toward reactivators having more heterogeneity in expressed epitopes before and after reactivation (42.1% vs 8.3%, P =.1). Shannon\u2019s evenness scores (mean 0.80, SD 0.05; scoring 0-1.0, directly proportional to value) showed high equality in distribution of epitopes within each individual. the recipient repertoire tended to be slightly more similar to that of the donor at d30. this trend reversed by d365 ( = 0.407), at which point D/R community-level differences were not different from pre-HCT, P =.76. in addition, the mean -distance between pre-R and d365 was 0.321 (SD = 0.08), which signifies that, 1 year after HCT, the antiviral repertoire is more similar to pre-HCT self than the donor (P.001). middle-aged recipients also had the highest pre-HCT scores. donor age more highly predicted d100 scores. donor age predicts all non-CMV epitopes at d100. trend toward recipient age predicting non-CMV epitopes at d365 with significant differences between age 40-55 and >55. CMV serostatus also was associated with many repertoire metrics. at d365, higher total B-cell counts were associated with a trend toward more evenness and higher diversity of the repertoire. at 1 year, however, neither GVHD nor steroids predicted epitope counts. at d365, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. no other clinical or demographic characteristics predicted any repertoire metric, including source of transplanted cells, underlying disease, status of underlying malignancy before HCT. the largest epitope gains were seen for human herpesviruses and adenoviruses. significant epitope gains were seen toward acute respiratory or gastrointestinal viral pathogens that are common post-HCT. for pairs that were D+/R, there was no net gain or loss of epitopes. there were nonsignificant gains in epitopes to CMV, HHV6b, RSV, and rhinovirus A. hCT pairs with recipients who reactivated CMV in the first 100 days after hematopoietic cell transplantation showed heterogeneity in response to CMV epitopes between pre- and post-reactivation (d100) samples in 8 pairs (43%), including in 3 of 4 D pairs, who should have had no preexisting contribution of donor-derived CMV immunity. d100 (100 copies of CMV per milliliter by plasma PCR or 2 cells positive for CMV pp65/2 106 cells) participants with seronegative donors (D) are stratified by CMV reactivation (purple; n = 4) or no reactivation (red; n = 4) there was a trend toward reactivators having more heterogeneity in expressed epitopes before and after reactivation. pre- and post-HCT recipient factors were again more highly associated than donor factors with repertoire metrics. donor characteristics dictate the rapidity of engraftment of transplanted humoral immunity. but longer-term maintenance of humoral immunity may involve a more complex interplay between graft and host factors. naive donors, or donor immunity not challenged by viral reactivation or acquisition, provide less virus-specific antibodies following engraftment. in pairs with a seropositive donor for a given virus, overall there was loss in epitope recognition during the year after transplant. this finding echoes the clinical experience that donors remain vulnerable to viral infections throughout the year after transplant and beyond. viruses.29,30 it may be that persons who reactivated CMV were also more likely to subclinically reactivate other viruses due to overall immunosuppression. this could potentially explain why donors may not be able to adequately control reactivation of a recipient\u2019s specific CMV strain. post-HCT samples allowed us to interrogate virome-wide antibody responses in a way that is robust to many limitations of serologic assays. virScan can document changes in humoral antiviral immunity over time and highlight the combined contributions of donor and recipient immunity following HCT. authorship Contribution: R.A.B.I. designed this study, assisted in analysis, interpreted results, and wrote the manuscript.
