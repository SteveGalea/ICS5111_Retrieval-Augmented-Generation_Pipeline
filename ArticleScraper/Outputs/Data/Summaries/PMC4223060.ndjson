{"summary": "pathogen jumps from original host into new host species. host shifts result in multiple human pandemics, such as HIV from chimps. pathogens have originated from other host species, including Plasmodium falciparum. a host shift will favour mutations that allow a pathogen to adapt to be transmitted efficiently by a novel host. we focus on viruses, owing to a wealth of recent studies, and because RNA viruses are the most likely group of pathogens to jump between hosts. we define a host shift as a parasite shifting to infect a new species of host. close relatives of the natural host offer similar environment to that which the pathogen is adapted to. this is likely because of the myriad of molecular interactions pathogens have with their hosts to infect cells, utilise resources, and avoid or suppress the host immune response. phylogenies of hantaviruses and their rodent and insectivore hosts show evidence for host switching, with data suggestive of preferential shifts between closely related species [27] closely related species may also have similar levels of susceptibility, regardless of their distance from the pathogen's natural host. this may mean that the host phylogeny is a patchwork of clades with varying levels of susceptibility. the ability of an avian influenza virus to infect a host is determined by the presence and within-host distribution of 2,3-linked host sialic acid receptors. mutations are often required to enhance a pathogen's fitness in the new host. mutations that enhance a virus' ability to bind to host cells are important in determining a virus' ability to infect a host. humans possess SA-2,3-sialic acid receptors in the lower respiratory tract of humans. successful adaptation to humans requires mutations to the SA receptor binding site in the hemagglutinin gene. this allows the virus to utilise SA-2,6 receptors and thus increase the potential for efficient transmission between humans. fewer mutations required to adapt to a new host, the more likely it is that they will all occur Epistasis and mutation order If mutations have to occur in particular combinations to confer high fitness then the chances of adaptation may be reduced Mutational target size If mutations reduce other components of a pathogen's fitness, such as replication in alternative hosts, they may be less likely to spread in the pathogen population. a gene phage of Pseudomonas fluorescens rapidly evolved to infect host genotypes but never adapted to others. the successful shifts were associated with one to three mutations in genes affecting host binding. more mutations were required to infect the other hosts. the size of the mutational target has been most studied in phage. this may act as a significant constraint on host shifts by reducing supply of adaptive mutations. the size of the mutational target has been most studied in phage. the white boxes represent the viral genome, and the coloured blocks represent mutations. the virus naturally infects Hibiscus plants, but following five passages in an alternate host, the same eight mutations repeatedly occur. five parallel mutations have been observed in two independent epidemics of SARs coronavirus. this has occurred in different HIV lineages that shifted into humans from other primates. in both human and chimp cells a restriction factor called tetherin can prevent the release of viral particles from infected cells. pathogens may circulate in host populations at low levels before becoming a detectable outbreak. trade-offs Adapting to a new host may have deleterious effects on other pathogen traits. a common trade-off of adapting to novel hosts is that performance on the ancestral host is reduced. pathogen may be unlikely to shift from a common mosquito species to a rare one. a vector borne pathogen may be unlikely to shift from a common mosquito species to a rare one as it will normally end up back in the original mosquito vector. however, reduced performance on the original host is not important. failure to evolve lower levels of virulence may explain the stuttering chains of transmission seen in some spillover events. however, it is difficult to disentangle whether the low rates of transmission are due to maladaptive levels of virulence or from human intervention. the observation that specific mutations are often required in host shifts has led to studies looking at whether these mutations can be predicted in advance. the distribution of pathogens across host species is the consequence of a balance between the rate at which new host\u2013pathogen associations are \u201cborn\u201d and \u201cdie\u201d when the pathogen goes extinct in a host [24], [85], [86]. if host shifts occur more frequently than host speciation, then the process is similar to the theory of island biogeography, where species richness of island communities is a balance between the rate at which new species colonise the island. the host phylogeny may consist of clades of intrinsically resistant and susceptible species, and the resistant clades tend to have lower pathogen diversity. this conceptual framework combined with our understanding of host shifts may prove to be a powerful way to explain the community composition of pathogens. each column shows the presence of a different pathogen, with a coloured circle representing the presence of that pathogen. species richness of island communities is a balance between the rate at which new species colonise the island and existing species go extinct. this theory predicts that species that have properties that increase the rate that pathogens host shift will tend to harbour more pathogens. phylogenetically isolated hosts that have few close relatives are predicted to have fewer pathogens. pathogens preferentially shift between closely related hosts. in B closely related host species have similar levels of susceptibility to infection. in A, but not B, host species with more close relatives tend to have more pathogens."}
