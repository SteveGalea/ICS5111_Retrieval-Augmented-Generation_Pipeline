{"summary": "high-throughput screening (HTS) is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery. modern biosafety requires the adaptation of HTS operations to a biosafety-level (BSL) laboratory. four laboratory biosafety levels (BSL-1 through -4) have been specified by the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) HTS in high-biocontainment laboratories requires the inclusion of important logistical and operational factors and the adherence to additional regulatory oversight and requirements. biosafety level Requirements for high-throughput screen Laboratories Biosafety level Pathogen characteristics Required microbiological safety practices. ive laboratory clothing, gloves, face, eye, and respiratory protection, as needed. equipment decontamination by formaldehyde for facility removal Facility entry restricted to qualified maintenance technicians on staff. early infectious disease HTS efforts were directly adapted from manual antiviral or antimicrobial assay formats. manual procedures specified that eukaryotic cells were dispensed to the assay plates, then incubated overnight, and allowed to form an attached monolayer before the addition of virus. commercial availability of reagents for rapid assay endpointing was also limited. throughput using this process was limited to less than 50 plates (4,000 compounds) per day. successful infectious disease HTS campaigns at BSL-25\u201313 provided an ideal starting point to test modifications to the BSL-2 process. the addition of cell controls and cells plus virus was combined into a single dispense step. this process required nanoliter volumes of compound in 100% DMSO be dispensed to the plate. each of these process and instrument improvements brought infectious pathogen screening to the level of efficiency that supported HTS in a BSL-4 laboratory. one line of the dispense head is used to dispense cells into the cell control wells (row A, B), while the remaining lines contain cells and virus mixed together, which are dispensed to the remainder of the plate that includes test compounds and virus control wells (B). additional efficiency improvements involved the use of high-density frozen cell stocks as reagents for both bacterial and antiviral assays. the need for biosafety and the space-limiting personal protective equipment (PPE) will likely continue to affect the throughput of such laboratories. biocontainment personnel will rapidly become accustomed to working in the biocontainment environments necessary for screening a broad range of live pathogens. the wellMate from thermo Matrix (Hudson, NH) is a small-footprint noncontact liquid dispenser with an 8-channel disposable cartridge that can be used for 96- and 384-well microplate formats. cartridges feature a flexible 8-channel design that can be easily modified to dispense multiple solutions into a plate simultaneously, enabling addition of various reagents in a single pass. dispense heads have a limited number of autoclave cycles at 121\u00b0C. autoclaves are set to achieve higher temperatures for decontamination of waste. an instrument with nondisposable dispense heads is the Multidrop Combi dispenser. preservation of Facility Engineering Controls Engineering controls play a critical role in preventing the release of pathogenic agents in high-containment laboratories. the size and location of the equipment does have the potential to disrupt local airflow. a large piece of equipment must be contained within a BSC. operators are trained extensively at BSL-1 and BSL-2 using identical equipment. this includes agent-specific training for routes of transmission, incubation period, signs and symptoms of disease, prophylaxis and therapy, and effective decontamination procedures. operators are trained extensively at BSL-1 and BSL-2 using identical equipment. high-containment laboratory equipment must be removed from high containment and decontaminated for maintenance or repair. decontamination and maintenance of equipment are often coordinated with regulatory-required annual shutdowns of the BSL-3 or -4 facilities. high-containment laboratory staff can troubleshoot and repair equipment as needed. personnel protective equipment restrictions operations at BSL-3 or -4 require additional PPE to reduce the risk to the operators for accidental infection. common additional PPE items for work in the BSL-3 include respiratory protection (N-95 mask or PAPR) and disposable multilayer garments. data acquisition, transfer, and storage requirements HTS operations require electronic transfer of data from the point of acquisition to a database for storage and processing. transfer of data from the containment laboratory to the LAN is usually accomplished through a hard wired connection because wireless transmitters cannot penetrate the concrete walls that house these types of facilities. Stackers should not be used because they can pose a safety risk. laboratory space within high containment is highly constrained, limiting the number of people and pieces of equipment in a room. this makes the standard BSL-1 and -2 procedures to increase throughput. the wellMate from thermo Matrix (Hudson, NH) is a small-footprint noncontact liquid dispenser with an 8-channel disposable cartridge that can be used for 96- and 384-well microplate formats. cartridges feature a flexible 8-channel design that can be easily modified to dispense multiple solutions into a plate simultaneously. the cartridge for this instrument is not considered disposable, but is still removable and autoclavable for efficient decontamination. the dispense tips are integrated into part of the tensioning assembly, which makes it difficult to externally decontaminate the dispense tips before removing the cartridge from the instrument. the size of the equipment should not decrease the operator level of protection by disrupting the air curtain provided by the BSC. moving large pieces of equipment to and from fixed benches creates the opportunity for accidents and exposures in a containment laboratory. agent-specific training should include proper equipment operation, troubleshooting, decontamination, and safety issues associated with automated devices. many BSL-4 laboratories operate using firm guidelines and rules. this will affect the PPE that operators wear, the time allowed for operators to stay in the laboratory without exiting for rest, and the decontamination procedures for removing items, samples, and equipment from the laboratories. equipment that must be installed by a service engineer is not suitable for use in containment laboratories. decontamination and maintenance of equipment are often coordinated with regulatory-required annual shutdowns of the BSL-3 or -4 facilities. this allows service personnel to safely enter the facility or for equipment to be removed for maintenance. Enhanced levels of PPE make it more difficult to operate with precision. this impact is offset by rigorous operator training that instills patience and attention to detail during experimentation. all experiments require extended time in high containment because greater care is necessary to conduct them. local Institutional Biosafety Committees are frequently chartered for oversight and approval of biosafety operations. they should be included as early as possible in the process for guidance and approval of HTS processes within BSL-3 and -4 laboratories. a biosafety oversight example might be handling microtiter plates containing infectious material when they are being moved from the BSC to another location. technical support is done routinely using Webex (Cisco, San Jose, CA) or by using software like pcAnywhere (Symantec, Mountain View, CA) to allow access to computers for troubleshooting software or equipment problems. information security concerns might also prohibit remote access to computers inside the containment facility, making data transfer and equipment troubleshooting and repair more difficult. high-content imaging was used with Ebola VLPs to screen compound libraries at BSL-229 and for several BSL-4 pathogens. the actual imaging of the samples was conducted at the BSL-2. this required extensive fixation of samples to inactivate the virus before removal from containment. plates from the BSL-4 and subsequent analysis of virus replication at BSL-2.33,34. removal of plates from high biocontainment requires rigorous decontamination of the assay plates. the number of manipulations and the transfer of microtiter plates out the BSL-4 make this method logistically impractical for processing large numbers of plates. the effort was a collaboration between the Southern Research (SR) and the national laboratory. a risk assessment of the pathogen with respect to its transmissibility and the type of containment required within the BSL-4 was performed. the initial step involved GNL laboratory personnel traveling to SR to oversee the set up and use of the equipment that was to be used in the BSL-4. the plates were incubated for 3 days, equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min. the plates were read with a plate reader in luminescence mode. this translates to 14,000 compounds per run and 2 runs per week for a 3-day assay such as the Nipah screen. new technologies present an opportunity to bring different types of assays into HTS for infectious agents. multimode plate readers have been used to monitor a wide variety of endpoints, including fluorescence, absorbance, fluorescence polarization, and luminescence, proximity-based endpoints. qPCR technology has been used as a secondary assay to monitor mRNA levels in compound-treated cells. qPCR technology has also been used to quantify the number of virus particles directly from the supernatant taken from infected cells. this is a powerful counter screen for compounds identified in the other types of assays described here. drug discovery and development are expensive and this will be even more expensive working in high-level containment laboratories. the greatest barrier to success is procuring the financial resources to do the work that is needed to produce a therapeutic."}
