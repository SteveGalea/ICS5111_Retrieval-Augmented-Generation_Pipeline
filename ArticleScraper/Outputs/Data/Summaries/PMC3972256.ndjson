{"summary": "drought is the most devastating one since it has been historically common in the northern part of Ethiopia and recently affecting central, eastern, southern parts of the country. the most severe events were in the year 1974, 1983, 1987, 1989, 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2009 2, 5,7. a nutritional survey was carried out in 2004 among the resettled and vulnerable population in western part of the country. prevalence of global acute malnutrition was 9.8% (95% CI 7.1-12.5) and prevalence of severe acute malnutrition was 1.93% (95% CI 0.68-3.18%), and the under-five mortality rate was 2.65 per 10,000 per day 11. drought has been the leading disaster in Ethiopia besides other emerging and frequent hazards. the most catastrophic floods documented have been in 2006, which affected many regions of Ethiopia. an estimated of over 600 people were killed and more than 500,000 people affected 2,5,13,14. limited studies have been carried out on how flood events affect human health. the health care system of Ethiopia evolved over time from traditional curative approach to focus on accessing primary health care services. there has been little information about initiatives taken by health sector to address the prevailing natural and man-made disasters as well as public health emergencies. the 1974 drought was one of the worst disasters that resulted in loss of an estimated 200, 000 human lives. it caused huge outbreaks of diseases, loss of live-stock, and made massive internal displacement. the drought also triggered the down fall of the government of Haileslaise and reinstatement of military junta 3,4. international media uncovered the situation in the country 22. some aid agencies or individual donors decided to channel the fund through rebels. this attests to the ineffective relief coordination and aid due to absence of strong preventive and preparedness system 21,22. the structure of disaster management that exists at national level has been replicated at regional, zonal, and district levels. the structure of disaster management that exists at national level involving all line ministries has been replicated at regional, zonal, and district levels. the health sector implemented a clear surveillance system to control the outbreaks and respond on time to any emergency. the disaster risk reduction and food security sector has been activating itself for effective preparedness and response to disaster 36. the government has acknowledged that natural disasters from other hazards such as floods are emerging more frequently. there is no clear and specific policy and strategy pertaining to these hazards apart from drought and when any disaster happens, the intervention being directed by government and partners is \u201creactive\u201d than \u201cpro-active\u201d the actions undertaken when flood happened in different parts of the country in 2006 is a case in point 15. the health care system under the leadership of the federal ministry of health is responsible for carrying out the routine and integrated surveillance. this is to immediately notify and investigate any suspected epidemic or outbreak of disease and take control measures in collaboration with other partners, mainly with the world health organization. a well-functioning epidemic preparedness and control mechanism has been underway 1,41. the program has been initiated to increase the trained human resource in emergency surgery at hospitals and health centers. the program has not been directly related to emergency management arising from disasters, but has a significant contribution in building the public health facilities with trained man power in the area of emergency. at health centers and hospitals the therapeutic feeding units have been established to manage severe and complicated malnutrition cases. if cases failed to respond to treatments given, they would be referred to health centers and notify health centers any malnutrition and its associated outbreaks existence. from severe acute malnutrition among cases treated at health facilities and health posts has been 82%, 85%, and 86% for the year ending 20011, 20012, and 2013, respectively 16,49. default due to unknown reasons from the treatment has been contributing 3.7% to 14 % of the total treatment outcomes. the health system responds as an emergency health situation. the average national case fatality rate of measles of 2011 was 0.5%. the average national case fatality rate of meningococcal meningitis for the year ending 2011 was 2.9%. the role and operational geographical areas of INGOs have been determined by the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission. the health system has been benefiting a lot from foreign aid/donors and INGOs in terms of direct financial support. INGOs and donors are playing a crucial role in the containment of emergencies due to drought disaster and outbreaks of diseases. but their practical roles in supporting the health system are minimal with regard to floods, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, man-made and other hazards. ministry of health recently developed a guideline for the management of public health emergencies and 20 diseases have been identified to be under surveillance. the disaster risk management system has some limitations which include lack of detailed policies and strategies for other hazards such as flooding, earthquake, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. the ministry of health has taken initiatives for management of disasters related to drought and its impacts in collaboration with Disaster Risk Management and Food Security Sector."}
