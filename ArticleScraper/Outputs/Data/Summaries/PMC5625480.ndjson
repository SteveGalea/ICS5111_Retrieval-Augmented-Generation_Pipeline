{"summary": "antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is mediated by their binding to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope molecules expressed on the surface of infected cells. ADCC-mediated elimination of reactivated latent HIV-1-infected cells is a potential mechanism by which antibodies can markedly reduce the HIV-1 reservoir. mD1.22, an engineered mutant of the D1 extracellular domain of CD4, selectively binds to the gp120 CD4-binding site (10), while m36.4, an antibody domain, targets the highly conserved CD4-induced (CD4i) gp120 coreceptor-binding site (11) the linkage in 4Dm2m of the soluble one-domain CD4, mD1.22, to the m36.4 domain greatly augments the binding and neutralizing LSEVh-LS-F inhibited in vitro and in vivo infection by HIV-1 strains. LSEVh-LS-F also significantly suppressed acute simian-human immunodeficiency virus infection of rhesus macaques. LSEVh-LS-F was defucosylated in GDP-fucose transporter gene-inactivated CHO cells (CHO-F6). LSEVh-LS-F was deconvoluted mass compared with LSEVh-LS (KD = 490 nM) defucosylation of LSEVh-LS-F was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis. LS produced in gene knockout CHOF6 cells was designated LSEVh-LS-F. mass spectra were shown, with deconvoluted mass for the major peak indicated at the top. LSEVh-LS and LSEVh-LS-F were bound with recombinant human FcRIIIa. LSEVh-LS-F and 4Dm2m showed similar to slightly better neutralization of VRC01-sensitive viruses compared to VRC01. LSEVh-LS-F and 4Dm2m showed similar to slightly better neutralization of VRC01-sensitive viruses compared to VRC01. T-NFAT-Luc2-CD16A cells activate a nuclear factor of activated T cell response element (NFAT-RE)-regulated luciferase reporter gene after FcRIIIa engagement by antibody bound to target cells. LSEVh-LS-F and VRC01 binding to Env expressed on the surface of ACH-2 cells, in vitro neutralizing activity, and in vitro ADCC activity. Graphed data represent the percent viral neutralization by the indicated concentrations of VRC01, 4Dm2m, and LSEVh-LS-F as measured by luciferase activity. each data point in the graph represents the average value of triplicates standard deviation (SD) oculation should support HIV-1-specific ADCC activity (26) hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice with HIV-1Env-LucR can be visualized by sequential IVIS imaging of untreated hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice. by 3 days after intravenous injection, LSEVh-LS-F serum levels were less than 5% of VRC01 serum levels but were still above the 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) for VRC LSEVh-LS-F significantly inhibited infection with the VRC01/3BNC117-resistant strain HIV-1C.Du422.1-LucR than VRC01 (Fig. 3D). LSEVh-LS-F treatment significantly inhibits in vivo infection with VRC01-sensitive and VRC01-resistant HIV-1 isolates. hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice were either left untreated or treated with 0.5 mg of either LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, or control antibody m336. five days later, mice were either left untreated or treated with 0.5 mg of either LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, or an isotype control MAb. we adapted the hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice to be used as in vivo visualization of productively infected cells by IVIS imaging showed a marked reduction in LucR activity in the spleens of hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice treated with LSEVh-LS-F compared to the spleens of untreated hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice. we depleted the NK cell population from the PBMC prior to their injection into hu-spl- hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice were inoculated with HIV-1JRCSF-LucR. mice were either left untreated or treated with 0.5 mg of LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, or control antibody m336, and HIV-1 infection was determined by quantifying LucR activity in the splenic lysates the next day. the percentage suppression of infection for each mouse compared to the untreated group is shown as a dot plot with mean SD for the group. the graph represents pooled data from 2 independent experiments using one donor. IL-15SA treatment of hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice activates the human NK cells populating the mouse spleen. LSEVh-LS-F potently inhibited HIV-1 infection, and reduced established HIV-1 infection via NK cell-dependent ADCC. to examine the capacity of LSEVh-LS-F to inhibit acute SHIV infection of rhesus macaques, we injected them with either LSEVh-LS-F (10 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) LSEVh-LS-F serum concentration was high (up to 100 g/ml) at 2 days after infusion. a concentration unlikely to be effective in suppressing in vivo SHIV replication. but the durability of in vivo inhibitory effects of a single dose against SHIV replication was limited. eight rhesus macaques were challenged intravenously with SHIV-1SF162P3. plasma SHIV loads from individual LSEVh-LS-F-treated macaques and individual PBS-treated macaques are shown. the average for the four macaques in the LSEVh-LS-F-treated and PBS-treated groups is shown. the number of SHIV RNA copies/g of the indicated tissue was determined by RT-qPCR at day 30. LSEVh-LS-F potently neutralizes VRC01-susceptible and VRC01-resistant strains of HIV-1 in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) LSEVh-LS produced in 293-F cells, which was designated LSEVh-LS. LSEVh-LS produced in CHOF6 cells, which was designated LSEVh-LS. mass spectra were shown, with deconvoluted mass for the major peak indicated at the top. LSEVh-LS-F increased its capacity to bind to gp120 molecules expressed on the surface of activated ACH-2 cells compared to VRC01. LSEVh-LS-F and the original fusion protein construct, 4Dm2m, showed increased binding to the Env trimer expressed on the surface of activated ACH-2 cells compared to VRC01. LSEVh-LS-F and 4Dm2m displayed similar to slightly better neutralization of VRC01-sensitive viruses compared to that of VRC01. capacity of LSEVh-LS-F and 4Dm2m to suppress infection with HIV-1 expressing VRC01-resistant Env was greater than 100-fold more than that of VRC01. unactivated ACH-2 cells and PMA-activated ACH2 cells were stained with the indicated concentration of biotinylated anti-Ebola virus MAb (control), VRC01, or LSEVh-LS-F. in vitro neutralization by VRC01, 4Dm2m, or LSEVh-LS-F of PBMC infection by HIV-1Env-LucR infectious molecular clones expressing Env. LSEVh-LS-F potently inhibits in vivo HIV-1 infection in hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice. the activated human PBMC persist in the mouse spleens for at least 1 month after intrasplenic injection. the activated human PBMC should support HIV-1-specific ADCC activity. hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice were either left untreated or intravenously injected with LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, or an isotype control monoclonal antibody (MAb) LSEVh-LS-F and VRC01 potently suppressed infection of the VRC01/3BNC117-sensitive HIV-1JRCSF-LucR virus. hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice were inoculated with HIV-1Env-LucR. the next day, groups of mice were either left untreated or treated with 0.5 mg of either LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, or control antibody m336. hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice were infected by intrasplenic injection with HIV-1JRCSF-LucR. five days later, mice were either left untreated or treated with LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, or an isotype control MAb. reduction in LucR activity measured 1 day after treatment should indicate elimination of HIV-1-infected cells by ADCC. LSEVh-LS-F treatment markedly reduced HIV-1 infection by >70% in the spleens of NSG mice constructed by intrasplenic injection of unfractionated PBMC. in contrast, LSEVh-LS-F treatment did not decrease HIV-1 infection in the spleens of NSG mice. hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice were intrasplenically injected with HIV-1JRCSF-LucR. mice were left untreated or treated with LSEVh-LS-F (0.5 mg) mice were either left untreated or treated with LSEVh-LS-F (0.5 mg) and/or ALT-803 (0.2 mg/kg) 1 day later, LucR activity in the splenic lysates was quantified. LSEVh-LS-F and IL-15SA reduced HIV-1JRCSF-LucR infection by 80%, 2-fold more than treatment with either LSEVh-LS-F or IL-15SA alone. the combination of LSEVh-LS-F and IL-15SA reduced HIV-1 infection by 80%, 2-fold more than treatment with either LSEVh-LS-F or IL-15SA alone. a well-recognized limitation of macaque studies involves cost and logistic factors that limit the number of animals available for inclusion in each experimental group. a significant quantitative effect may not be identified by direct statistical comparison with a control group. the administration of LSEVh-LS-F at day 7 resulted in a highly statistically significant reduction of peak viremia at day 9. LSEVh-LS-F is highly effective in suppressing in vivo SHIV replication. but the durability of in vivo inhibitory effects of a single dose against SHIV replication was limited by the relatively short serum half-life of LSEVh-LS-F. decrease of virus RNA at day 9 for LSEVh-LS-F-treated compared to PBS-treated macaques is highly statistically significant (P = 0.0001) the limit of detection is about 0.1 g/ml, and after day 18, the LSEVh-LS-F concentration can be assumed to be undetectable. control of infection in elite controllers (37), in vivo efficacy of bNAb therapy (31, 38), emergence of immune escape variants (39), and accelerated elimination of HIV-1-infected cells in 3BNC117-treated humanized mice (40). hu-spl-PBMC-NSG humanized mouse model contains human NK cells with high cytotoxic function (26), as an in vivo system to evaluate ADCC activity mediated by LSEVh NK cell depletion abrogated LSEVh-LS-F-mediated reduction in HIV-1 infection. NK cell depletion abrogated LSEVh-LS-F-mediated reduction in HIV-1 infection. this was further supported by our finding that activation of NK cell cytotoxic activity by IL-15SA treatment increased LSEVh-LS-F-mediated in vivo reduction in HIV-1 infection. can enable HIV-1 to escape from natural bNAb such as VRC01, 3BNC117, and 10-1074. treatment with combinations of bNAb specific for nonoverlapping epitopes will be required for ADCC-mediated elimination of cells infected with immune escape variants. LSEVh-LS-F combined a gp120-binding CD4 subunit, mD1.22, and a CD4i coreceptor-binding site-specific antibody fragment, m36.4 (10), in vitro neutralization of VRC01-resistant Env strains by LSEVh-LS-F. in vivo inhibition of HIV-1 infection by a VRC01-resistant strain, which has also shown resistance to 3BNC117. the enhanced avidity of LSEVh-LS-F for gp120 expressed by infected cells was indicated by its increased binding to gp120-expressing ACH2 cells compared to that of VRC01. peak viremia was suppressed by about 1.2 logs compared to that in untreated macaques during acute SHIV infection. LSEVh-LS-F plasma levels averaged about 100 g/ml for the first 2 days after administration. levels subsequently declined more rapidly than those of native bNAb. new approaches to enhance the half-life of LSEVh-LS-F should counterbalance its shorter half-life. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (-specific) antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat F(ab\u2032)2 anti-human IgG (-specific) antibody were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) expression and purification of VRC01, 4Dm2m, LSEVh-LS, and LSEVh- CHO-F6 was transfected with the LSEVh-LS vector to establish stable cell lines producing LSEVh-LS-F using the standard glutamine synthetase-based selection system. the proteins were mixed with buffer (7.5 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, and 1 mM EDTA) the instrument was used in a full-scan time-of-flight (TOF) mode. MS source parameters were set with a capillary voltage of 4 kV, fragmentor voltage of 220 V, and skimmer voltage of 65 V. in vitro and in vivo HIV-1 infection was determined using the LucR reporter-expressing HIV-1 infectious molecular clone (IMC) system (62) the proviral genome has been engineered to express, in cis, the LucR reporter gene and heterologous HIV-1 env gene sequences of choice. the infectious titer of HIV-1Env-LucR viruses was determined by a limiting-dilution infection assay using TZM-bl cells. LSEVh-LS-F, VRC01, and a control MAb recognizing Ebola virus, ADI-15878, were biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Life Technologies) h-LS-F to neutralize HIV-1Env-LucR expressing HIV-1 envelopes from VRC01-susceptible (HIV-1Bal-LucR, HIV-1JR-CSF-LucR, HIV-1C.1176-LucR, and HIV-145_01dH5-LucR) viruses (21, 22) was determined using a modified in vitro human PBMC-based assay described previously (62). target cells, CHO cells or CHO cells which express a clade-B HIV-1 Env were plated into 96-well plates. indicated concentration of LSEVh-LS-F diluted in R10 was added to each well (50 l/well) s of VRC01 and LSEVh-LS-F were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with plates coated with HIV-1 Env gp14089.6. standard curves were generated using VRC01 or LSEVh-LS-F standards. the mice were bred and maintained in our biosafety level 2 (BSL2)-enhanced animal facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. the capacity of LSEVh-LS-F or VRC01 to inhibit HIV-1 infection was evaluated by intravenously injecting hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice with m336, a monoclonal antibody against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. mice were intravenously injected with LSEVh-LS-F (0.25 mg) and/or subcutaneously injected with a dose of the IL-15SA ALT-803 (0.2 mg/kg), which provides the mice with a maximum concentration in serum (Cmax) of 25 nM (26) the day after treatment, the reduction in the number of HIV-1-infected cells in the mouse spleens was determined by quantifying the decrease in LucR activity compared to LSEVh-LS-F and irrelevant control antibody m336 were preincubated with SHIVSF162P3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the luciferase expression was quantified 48 h after infection upon cell lysis and the addition of luciferase substrate. cDNA was preamplified by PCR for 12 cycles (94\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min) with the nested primers. the amplified product was detected by hybridization to the labeled probe pSGAG23 (5\u2032-FAM-CTTCPTCAGTKTGTTTTTTTTG-3\u2032) the macaque studies were conducted in the biosafety level 3 laboratory. protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the 293 FreeStyle (293-F) cells were obtained from Invitrogen-Life Technologies. Defucosylated LSEVh-LS (LSEVh-LS-F) was produced using CHO cells with their GDP-fucose transporter (GFT) genes inactivated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. three GDP-fucose transporter gene fragments were cloned into the pCas-Guide-GFP vector. three days after trans the proteins were mixed with buffer (7.5 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, and 1 mM EDTA) in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubated at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. the analytes were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 1 to 90% organic gradient over 5 min. kinetics and affinity of LSEVh-LS and LSEVh-LS-F binding to FcRIIIa were quantified by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis on a Biacore X100 instrument. purified proteins were diluted in sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and immobilized directly onto a CM5 sensor chip. HIV-1Env-LucR reporter viruses are replication competent. LucR has a short cellular half-life of approximately 3 h (64), the measurement of LucR levels correlate with active HIV-1 replication. ACH-2 cells were activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (2 ng/ml) for 48 h. then stained with each biotinylated antibody at the indicated concentration determined after biotinylation for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. data were acquired using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software. the HIV-1Env-LucR viruses (6.25 104 IU) were coincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a 96-well round-bottom plate with 10-fold dilutions (0.01 nM to 100 nM) of either 4Dm2m, LSEVh-LS-F, or VRC01. The activated PBMC were harvested, washed, resuspended in R10 medium, added to each well (1 105 cells rhesus macaques were intravenously injected with 0.5 mg of either VRC01 or LSEVh-LS-F on day 7 after SHIV infection. plasma samples were collected at days 0, 7, 9, 16, 18, 21, 25, and 30. NK cells were removed from the PBMC after activation by immunomagnetic sorting using anti-human CD3-FITC and anti-human CD56-PE (BioLegend) antibodies. the cells were centrifuged for 1 h at 25\u00b0C at 2,500 rpm, resuspended, and injected intrasplenically into NSG mice. hu-spl-PBMC-NSG mice or NSG mice were intrasplenically injected with NK cell-depleted PBMC (107 cells/mouse) for some experiments, the mice were intravenously injected with either LSEVh-LS-F (0.25 mg) or subcutaneously injected with a dose of the IL-15SA ALT-803 (0.2 mg/kg), which provides the mice with a maximum concentration in serum (Cmax) the images were analyzed using the Wizard bioluminescent selection tool. the bioluminescent and gray-scale images were overlaid using the LivingImage 4.0 software package. the bioluminescent intensity of the luciferase activity in the mouse spleens was quantified using the LivingImage 4.0 software package. ultrasensitive, nested, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) method targeting a highly conserved region in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gag (68) RNA loads in plasma and tissues were quantified by extracting RNA either from plasma (500 l) using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) or from tissues (100 mg) pulverized with stainless steel grinding balls and homogenized in TRIzol reagent GraphPad Prism software was used for the statistical analysis. differences were considered statistically significant when the P value was 0.05."}
