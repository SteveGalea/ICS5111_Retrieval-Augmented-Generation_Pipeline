{"summary": "FTLR2% in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) was measured by flow cytometry. serum levels of IL-10 (sIL-10) were determined in 31 patients with KD before the initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) Approximately 3%\u20135% of the afflicted children develop coronary artery lesions (CALs) despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)1,2. approximately 10%\u201320% of the patients with KD show resistance to IVIG4,5. bacillus casei cell wall extract (LCCWE)-induced mouse model of coronary arteritis showed that via TLR2 pathway, along with myeloid differentiating factor 88, the macrophages and dendritic cells are activated by LCCWE16. Activation of TLR2 can trigger production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory as well as a proinflammatory cytokine with regulatory properties, which is involved in the inhibition of monocyte and macrophage embling KD, we determined serum titers of antistreptolysin O, anti-Epstein-Barr viral, antimumps viral, and antimycoplasma antibodies in all samples from patients with KD. also performed multiplex polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from patients with KD, for common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, the probability of isolated dilatation of LMCA without accompanying dilatation of LAD has been reported to be low22. the z scores were calculated by dividing the differences between the actual measurements of RCA and LAD. blood samples were taken from FCs on admission and from patients with KD before initial IVIG treatment. the day of onset of fever was determined as the day one of illness. white blood cell counts and serum levels of hemoglobin, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were determined. IL-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IL-10 serum concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems Co., Minneapolis, MN, USA) a buffered protein base, standard, control, and samples were added per well. after incubation and washing, substrate solution was added. all enrolled patients met criteria for complete KD. fever, conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the oral mucosa, and changes in the extremities. children who presented with incomplete KD were excluded from our study. we measured the internal diameter of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) to classify patients with CAL development (CAL (+) and those who without CAL development (CAL) the probability of isolated dilatation of LMCA without accompanying dilatation has been reported to be low22. CAL patients had normal (z score 2.5) coronary arteries one month after initial diagnosis. twenty-one children with no history of KD, autoimmune, or allergic diseases were included as febrile controls (FCs) demographic variables followed were age, sex, duration of fever before and after treatment, prevalence of CAL (+) and resistance to IVIG. Isotype matched monoclonal antibodies (eBioscience) were used as controls. total 50,000 cells were counted from each sample. monocyte population was identified as CD14+ cells. correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman coefficient. to determine the cutoff value of FTLR2% in predicting CAL development and IVIG resistance, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed.

Table 4. Frequencies of toll-like receptor 2 expression/CD14+ monocytes in patients with Kawasaki disease and febrile controls. correlation between FTLR2% and sIL-10 in patients with KD did not correlate significantly with sIL-10. sIL-10 before initial treatment was usually higher in IVIG nonresponders compared with that in the IVIG responders. sIL-10 before initial treatment was usually higher in IVIG nonresponders. a 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity predicted IVIG resistance with a 76.2% specificity. a sIL-10 cutoff value of 15.52 pg/mL predicted IVIG resistance with a 66.7% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity.

FTLR2% predicted IVIG resistance with a 66.7% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity. this was a more sensitive, predictive parameter for CALs than sIL-10. previous studies on TLRs in KD have focused on the feasibility of coronary arteritis animal model. this agrees with our results that show increased FTLR2% in the CAL (+) group compared to that in the CAL () group. however, they did not investigate the correlation between TLR expression levels and CAL development or IVIG resistance. monitoring FTLR2% could be used as a relatively early predictor of CAL development. high sIL-10 at the acute stage of KD might have had a beneficial effect on the inflammation of the coronaries past the acute stage of KD. sensitivity in predicting IVIG resistance in patients with KD was comparable between FTLR2% before initial treatment and sIL-10. the inclusion of a relatively small number of patients in these investigations presents a limitation of our study. another limitation might be the relatively short-term follow-up of our patients, as CALs can form after 1 month of onset of the disease. further studies are needed to validate FTLR2% as a marker of prognosis and severity of KD. ligands capable of TLR2 activation in KD could be useful."}
