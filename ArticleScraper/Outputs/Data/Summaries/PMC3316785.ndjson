{"summary": "a 55-year-old Caucasian woman presented with 1-month history of dyspnoea, fatigue and abnormal lung findings in chest x-ray (figure 1). a few weeks later she began with a dry cough, thoracic pain and had one episode of low-volume haemoptysis. treatment with antibiotic was completed, without radiological improvement. bronchoscopy followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (TBB) revealed no endobronchial lesion. no side effects related to prednisone. the patient remains asymptomatic, 14 months after histological diagnosis. she is observed regularly in the Pulmonology outpatient clinic. AFOP is an extremely rare pathologic entity. autoimmune disease is an important and previously described association. AFOP is characterised by prominent intra-alveolar fibrin deposition (fibrin balls) resulting in a morphological pattern that may represent an underreported variant of diffuse alveolar damage, cryptogenic organising pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia."}
