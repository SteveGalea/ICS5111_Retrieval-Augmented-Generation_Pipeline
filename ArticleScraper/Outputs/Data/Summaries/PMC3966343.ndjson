{"summary": "autophagy is an intracellular degradative process including macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. autophagy can take place in a manner of selected or nonselected catabolic process via the lysosomal pathway compared to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. autophagy is responsible for removing the damaged organelles caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) elongation of the isolated membrane triggered the formation of double-layer phospholipid membrane that can engulf organelles. elongation of the isolated membrane triggered the formation of double-layer phospholipid membrane that can engulf organelles. xenophagy inhibits cellular autophagy to facilitate viral replication in infected cells. cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and simian immunodeficiency virus type 1 (SIV 1) both were reported to inhibit autophagy. y can provide the energy source for viral replication as dengue virus. some viruses trigger incomplete autophagy flux for their own benefits. how the virus regulates this incomplete autophagy process and what kinds of advantage this process brings to viruses remains unclear. v-cyclin KSHV A [81, 86] vBcl-2 KSHV/HV-68 S [53, 54] MCMV S [53, 54] IE180 PRV S [44] nsP4 Rotavirus A [70, 71] S protein SARS-CoV A [77, 78] Small T antigen SV40 A [73, 74] aS: suppressor. sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (HV-68) have been shown to inhibit the formation of autophagosomes through their binding to Beclin 1 [9, 35, 36]. HBx is a double-strand DNA virus, a member of the hepadnavirus family. its DNA genome contains four genes named S, C, P, and X. the binding between ICP34.5 and eIF2 is crucial for specific dephosphorylation of eIF2 by PP1, thus facilitating the initiation of protein translation. eIF2 is involved in inhibition of phosphorylation by regulating PP1. PKR binding domain located between amino acids residues 91\u2013121 close to the C-terminus of Us11 contributes to physical association with PKR. previous investigation demonstrated that the truncated Us11 mutants without its N-terminus failed to inhibit poly- (IC-) induced autophagy. it has been well-known that PKR is transcriptionally induced by interferon and activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) both m142 and m143 proteins are important for MCMV replication. m142-m143 multimer directly binds to PKR as well as to dsRNA to prevent PKR activation. PKR is unable to shut off cellular translation and to repress viral replication. cFLIP-Like Viral Protein Some -herpesvirus encode a viral protein homologous to the cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein (cFLIP) it contains 2 death effector domains (DED) at the N-terminus. the FLIP is involved in negative regulation of cellular apoptosis induced by the activation of specific proapoptotic receptors on the cell surface. vFLIP can block cellular autophagy by binding Atg3 E2-like enzyme with its DEDs. atg3 is a critical enzyme that mediates lipidation and conjugation of LC3 to promote autophagosome biogenesis. a reduction of autophagy occurs in virus-infected cells. the coiled-coil domain of nsP2 is responsible for the interaction with the coiled-coil domain of NDP52. it has been demonstrated that NDP52 colocalized with the trans-Golgi network associated RCs containing nsPs and dsRNA. knockdown of NDP52 by using siRNA specific to NDP52 strikingly decreased CHIKV replication. mTOR Signaling Pathway Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a DNA virus that belongs to polyomaviridae family. the small T antigen (ST) has 174 amino acid residues encoded by the SV40 early region. studies that focused on the function of ST have linked the relationship between ST and the mechanism by which cancer cells can survive under condition of nutrient deprivation. a number of viruses have been characterized encode proteins modifying autophagy through UPR to their own advantages during infection. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) modulates UPR by activating PERK protein kinase by its viral spike (S) protein [77, 78], while the E protein encoded by the envelope gene downregulates the IRE-1 signaling pathway. KSHV v-cyclin is one of the well-known viral proteins that trigger autophagy indirectly via activation of DDR. v-cyclin is homologous to D-type cyclins that bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) to form an active holoenzyme, allowing v-cyclin to constitutively deregulate cell cycle and to promote oncogenic stress. this stress triggers the DDR signaling HBx is a double-strand DNA virus, a member of the hepadnavirus family. it is involved in regulating cell cycle, signaling transduction, and cellular apoptotic pathways. the HBx protein encoded by the X gene serves as a multifunctional regulatory protein. HBx can directly bind to Vps34, the catalytic subunit of PI3KC3, to promote the activity of PI3KC3. autolysosomes were not involved in HBV replication, since treatment of cells with bafilomycin showed no effects on HBV DNA replication. HBx is a double-strand DNA virus, a member of the hepadnavirus family. it is involved in regulating cell cycle, signaling transduction, and cellular apoptotic pathways. HBx-induced autophagy benefits HBV DNA replication rather than RNA transcription. the C-terminal region of ICP34.5 contains a consensus binding motif (R/KVXF) for PP1 followed by an Ala-Arg-rich motif, that is, highly homologous to the C-terminal region of mammalian growth arrest and DNA damage protein 34 (GADD34) the amino acids residues 233\u2013248 in the ICP34.5 were verified as a binding site of eIF2. the PKR binding domain located between amino acids residues 91\u2013121 close to the C-terminus of Us11 contributes to physical association with PKR. the truncated Us11 mutants without its N-terminus failed to inhibit poly- (IC-) induced autophagy. it has been well-known that PKR is transcriptionally induced by interferon and activated by double-stranded RNA. m142-m143 multimer directly binds to PKR as well as to dsRNA. PKR is unable to shut off cellular translation and to repress viral replication. p17 is the protein responsible for ARV-induced host cell cycle arrest and autophagosome formation. the p17 protein serves as an autophagy inducer in the life cycle of ARV. eIF2 plays a central role in the maintenance of mRNA translation. eIF2 plays a central role in the maintenance of mRNA translation. us11-null viruses grow normally in vitro and are slightly attenuated in vivo, suggesting that the function of Us11 may be compensated by the extant ICP34.5. the truncated mutants without its N-terminus failed to inhibit poly- (IC-) induced autophagy in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-LC3. MCMV m142 and m143 proteins are important for MCMV replication. both m142 and m143 proteins are essential for inhibition of PKR and subsequent eIF2 phosphorylation. PKR is unable to shut off cellular translation and to repress viral replication. p17 triggered autophagy via activations of PTEN and AMPK to negatively regulate the function of mTORC1 [22]. cFLIP-Like Viral Protein Some -herpesvirus encode a viral protein homologous to the cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein (cFLIP), such as KSHV vFLIP, molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV 159L) DISC activates the downstream caspase signaling cascade to induce apoptosis. vFLIP can block cellular autophagy by binding Atg3 E2-like enzyme with its DEDs. a reduction of autophagy occurs in virus-infected cells. structural proteins (nsP1 to nsP4) are important for virus replication. nsPs bind to viral RNA to form replicative complexes. nsP2 can use autophagy machinery to help virus replication. the nsP4 protein of rotavirus is likely to recruit autophagosomal membrane to viroplasm to promote virus replication. it binds to autophagosomes to prevent the autophagic vacuoles in macrophages during infection to enhance its replication. cFLIP-Like Viral Protein Some -herpesvirus encode a viral protein homologous to the cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein (cFLIP) vFLIP can block cellular autophagy by binding Atg3 E2-like enzyme with its DEDs. atg3 is a critical enzyme that mediates lipidation and conjugation of LC3 to promote autophagosome biogenesis. a reduction of autophagy occurs in virus-infected cells. nsPs bind to viral RNA to form replicative complexes (RCs) nsPs bind to viral RNA to form replicative complexes. nsP2 can use autophagy machinery to help virus replication through binding to human autophagy receptor NDP52. the nsP4 protein of rotavirus is likely to recruit autophagosomal membrane to viroplasm to promote virus replication. HIV-1 induces the autophagic vacuoles in macrophages during infection to enhance its replication. the Nef protein blocks the maturation of autophagolysosomes to prevent Gag proteins from degradation. 40 ST acts in cancer cells to maintain energy homeostasis during glucose deprivation by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway which is likely responsible for activation of autophagy. there are three main pathways activated upon UPR induction, including transcription factor 6 (ATF6), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE-1) [76]. v-cyclin is one of the well-known viral proteins that trigger autophagy indirectly via activation of DDR. v-cyclin is homologous to D-type cyclins that bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) to form an active holoenzyme. this stress triggers the DDR signaling, resulting in autophagy and cellular senescence. the unfolded protein response (UPR) UPR is an alarm system for cells in response to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) there are three main pathways activated upon UPR induction, including transcription factor 6 (ATF6), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE-1) [76]. a complex interrelationship between viral infection and cellular DDR revealed some viruses can selectively activate and/or repress DDR signaling pathways in a temporally coordinated manner. v-cyclin is homologous to D-type cyclins that bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) to form an active holoenzyme. this stress triggers the DDR signaling, resulting in autophagy and cellular sen autophagy is a procedure involving a series of steps that require well-controlled signaling pathways. how the viruses operate in this process in order to complete their productive infection in host cells remains to be addressed."}
