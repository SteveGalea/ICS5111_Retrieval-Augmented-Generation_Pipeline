{"summary": "ZIKV is an emerging arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. it includes dengue virus 1 to 4 (DENV-1 to -4), west Nile virus (WNV), japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and tick-borne TBEV. since 2007, ZIKV has spread explosively to cause a series of epidemics in viral genomic RNA is released to the host cell cytosol. the newly synthesized virions then transport from the ER and Golgi body to the cell surface. progeny viruses are released to initiate the next round of infection. a total of 3,544 host proteins were quantified, with 200 being differentially regulated. bioinformatics analysis of regulated host proteins highlighted several ZIKV infection-regulated biological processes. ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays roles in the ZIKV infection process. RNA level at 120 hpi was still quantifiable, although CPE can be detected at this time point. Pearson correlation efficiency was calculated based on the log2 values (protein ratio) from two independent biological replicates. the cutoff for differentially regulated proteins was set as described previously (22) among 3,544 host proteins quantified in this study, 86 were identified as being upregulated, while 114 were identified as being downregulated. quantitative PCR analysis of selected host proteins was performed to verify our MS data. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was chosen as the internal control. quantitative PCR analysis indicated that these proteins are upregulated by ZIKV infection in C6/36 cells (P 0.05). the distributions of protein ratios in the categories \"rRNA processing,\" \"sRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane,\" and \"viral transcription\" were significantly lower than the overall distribution. quantitative proteins with their gene symbols and ratios were submitted to PANTHER. tissue culture supernatant (TCS) was collected at 12 and 36 hpi. the virus titer was measured with a plaque assay. knockdown of CHCHD2 can decrease ZIKV production. this suggests that CHCHD2 may promote ZIKV replication. heLa cells were transfected with siRNA against CHCHD2 or plasmid expressing HA-CHCHD2. at 36 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and subjected to WB analysis. antibodies used are indicated, with GAPDH set as endogenous loading control.

DISCUSSION Mosquitoes are epidemiologically important vectors for ZIKV. the innate immune system plays an important role in resisting pathogen infection (33), which is mainly mediated by three major signaling pathways, the Toll, the immunodeficiency (IMD) and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathways (34\u201336) the toll pathway is mainly activated by Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and viruses. deNV-2 infection in Aedes aegypti activated the JAK-STAT pathway (39) while JEV infection of C6/36 cells disrupted the JAK-STAT pathway via interfering with phosphorylation of STAT (40). in human cells, flaviviruses employ various strategies to evade the innate immune system (41) the ER is an organelle involved in multiple biological processes, such as protein folding and secretion, calcium homeostasis, and lipid biosynthesis. the ER retains incorrectly folded proteins, which can activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER. ubiquitin plays a vital role in deNV-2 infection at the early stage (29) ubiquitin protein Ub3881 is involved in deNV-2 envelope protein degradation. the UPS plays an important role in the JEV entry process (55) bortezomib can reduce viral load and signs of pathology in ZIKV-infected mice. the identification of bortezomib as an inhibitor of ZIKV infection in vivo provides a potential drug candidate for the treatment of ZIKV infection. multiple homologs of reported apoptosis-related proteins were differentially regulated. the protein with accession number KXJ79329, the homolog of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) and the protein with accession number KXJ76938, the homolog of PH domain-interacting protein (PHIP) were both downregulated in this study. signaling pathways, the Toll, the immunodeficiency (IMD) and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathways are mainly activated by Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and viruses. the activated Toll pathway can lead to the nuclear translocation of NF-B-like transcription factors (36) and control the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (37). deNV-2 infection in Aedes aegypti activated the JAK-STAT pathway (39), while JEV infection of C6/36 cells disrupted the JAK-STAT pathway via interfering with phosphorylation of STAT (40). a STAT-like protein, with GenBank accession number KXJ68626, was downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in ZIKV-infected cells. the ER is an organelle involved in multiple biological processes, such as protein folding and secretion, calcium homeostasis, and lipid biosynthesis. the ER retains incorrectly folded proteins, which can activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER. many different viruses have evolved to utilize the cellular the UPS to facilitate viral entry, replication, and egress (51, 52). ubiquitin plays a vital role in deNV-2 infection at the early stage (29). ubiquitin protein Ub3881 is involved in deNV-2 envelope protein degradation. bortezomib, an FDA-approved drug, is an inhibitor of ZIKV infection in vivo. it provides a potential drug candidate for the treatment of ZIKV infection. cytochrome P450 Cyp6a14 was regulated as a result of ZIKV infection. the homolog of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) and the protein with accession number KXJ76938, the homolog of PH domain-interacting protein (PHIP) were both downregulated in this study. it has been reported that IAP and PHIP showed antiapoptosis functions.
