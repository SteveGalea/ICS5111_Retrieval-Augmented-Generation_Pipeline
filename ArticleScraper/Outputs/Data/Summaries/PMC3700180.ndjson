{"summary": "the world health organization estimated the mortality rate of SARS to be up to 15% (3\u20135) there is currently no approved therapeutic for the treatment of SARS infections. a number of inhibitors have been shown to block HIV entry by using diverse strategies. ARS-S comprises two components: S1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD); and S2, which contains the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV gains entry into permissive cells through interactions of the SARS-S RBD with the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (23, 24), and at the low pH in endosomes, SARS-S is cleaved by a cellular protease called cathepsin pCDNA 3.1 soluble ACE2 plasmid was provided by Paul Bates (University of Pennsylvania) (43). plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV spike RBD with the signal sequence of CD5 and the Fc domain of human IgG1, pCDM8-Spike RBD-Fc was provided by Michael Farzan (New England Primate Research Center) 293T cells transfected with pCDNA 3.1-ACE2 were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 104 cells/well. after 15 min equal volumes of the viral supernatant were added to the wells with the cells, and the mixtures were incubated for another 48 h. the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was calculated according to the Spearman-Karber formula. the titer was then converted to the estimated number of infectious units per volume of virus material (U/ml) to obtain the MOI in U/cell, the number of infectious particles was divided by the number of cells to be infected. the amount of fluorescence produced as a result of the release of amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from the substrate was measured using a fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. the data obtained were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, Inc.) beads were then washed in PBS with 0.5 M NaCl. bound protein was eluted with 50 mM sodium citrate-50 mM glycine. eluted protein was neutralized to pH 7.0 with 5 M sodium hydroxide. Approximately 1 106 ACE2-transfected 293T cells were detached in PBS with 5 mM EDTA and washed with PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) the cells were then incubated on ice for 1 h. the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and 0.5% BSA. TZM-bl cells were then overlaid with the same amount of 293T cells expressing SARS-S envelope and Tat protein (1 104 cells/well) DMSO or compounds were added to the TZM-bl cells either 45 min prior to the overlay with 293T cells or 2 h after the overlay with 293T cells. cells were treated with serum-free medium containing 2 g/ml trypsin to induce fusion and replaced with complete DMEM after 30 the plates were transported to a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility. they were infected with 25 l of diluted Toronto-2 strain of SARS-CoV. internal controls consisted of cells only (cell control), cells infected with virus (virus control), and virus-infected cells treated with calpain inhibitor IV. 8 concentrations of each compound were added to 96-well plates in triplicate. c is the standard deviation of the cell control, c is the mean cell control signal, and v is the mean virus control signal. a commercially available XTT cytotoxicity assay kit measures the amount of ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically active cells. the total intracellular RNA was extracted at 48 h posttransfection (hpt) the extracted RNA was used as a template for subsequent reverse transcription\u2013quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of N gene mRNA synthesis (NC) the reverse primer URB-28630RS (5\u2032-TGCTTCCCTCTGCGTAGAAGCC-3\u2032), complementary to nucleotides 511 to 532 of the N gene. the mean value for each sample was normalized to the mean value for the NRC cells by using the following equation: CT = CT(sample) CT(NRC). the RQ value for each sample was then normalized to the RQ value for the NRC (which is 1) in order to obtain percent relative RQ values. 293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS SARS-S DNA or pMDG-VSV-G DNA together with pNL-4.3-Luc-ER. after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, the supernatants were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. six 5-fold serial dilutions of 50 l of the pseudotyped viral stock were used to infect 1 104 ACE2/293T cells in a 96-well plate in quadruplicate. after 48 h, the supernatant in each well was replaced with a lysis buffer. the p24 antigen in each sample was then measured using an ELISA kit. purified recombinant cathepsin L (2 units) was incubated at 37\u00b0C with a 25 M concentration of the fluorogenic substrate Z-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin and assay buffer (Calbiochem) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of the compounds (2 to 80 M), in a total reaction volume of 200 l. substrate was measured using a fluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. expression and purification of the SARS-CoV spike receptor binding domain were carried out as described previously (29). ACE2 protein and SARS-S RBD-Fc were detected using a goat anti-human polyclonal ACE2 antibody with rabbit anti-goat\u2013horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as the secondary antibody (Millipore, St. Louis, MO) and anti-human IgG\u2013HRP (Millipore, St. Louis, MO), respectively. TZM-bl cells that stably express luciferase were transfected with pcDNA 3.1-ACE2 plasmid. all transfections were done with the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. TZM-bl cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 104 cells/well. 50 l DMEM with phenol red, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% l-glutamine. plates were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 72 h. eight concentrations of each compound were added to 96-well plates in triplicate. % CPE inhibition was defined as the amount of luminescence obtained from wells with the compound, cells, and virus. an active compound, or hit, was defined as a compound that exhibited a % CPE inhibition of >50% without compromising cell viability. 293T cells were grown to 95% confluence on 35-mm-diameter plates. they were transfected with 4 g of SARS-CoV replicon. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) at 48 h posttransfection. sequences of forward and reverse primers used for amplification of mRNA as an endogenous control were as follows: U6 forward primer, 5\u2032-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3\u2032; and U6 reverse primer, 5\u2032-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3\u2032. amplification efficiencies were determined using 1:10 cDNA dilutions; test and housekeeping gene primer pairs with similar efficiencies were used for qPCRs. 44 compounds were found to cause 50% reduction in luciferase activity at 10 M. luciferase activity was reduced due to cytotoxicity, luciferase inhibition, or HIV replication inhibition from the SARS/HIV pseudotyped virus assay. Compounds A (SSAA09E1), B (SSAA09E2), and C (SSAA09E3) were selected for further characterization, as they were efficient inhibitors of SARS/HIV but not VSV/HIV entry. additional compounds that decreased luminescence by 20 to 50% in VSV/HIV entry experiments were considered to be less specific SARS/HIV pseudotype inhibitors. d-based and antiviral-based assays Compound Pseudotype-based assay in 293T cellsa,c Infectious virus assay in vero cellsb,c EC50 (M) CC50 (M) Selectivity index EC50 (M) CC50 (M) Selectivity index SSAA09E3 9.7 0.8 20 2 0.15 17 113 SSAA09E1 6.7 0.4 >100 >16 ND ND cathepsin B has a similar but distinct cleavage specificity from that of cathepsin L. a known specific cathepsin B inhibitor, CA074, was used as a positive control for this assay. a known specific cathepsin B inhibitor, CA074, was used as a positive control for this assay. the specificity of SSAA09E1 was evaluated by testing its ability to block cathepsin B activity. purified recombinant cathepsin B was incubated with a 25 M concentration of a fluorogenic substrate for cathepsin B (Z-Arg-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) in the presence or absence of a known specific cathepsin B inhibitor (CA074) or SSAA09E1. three compounds inhibited entry by interfering with fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane. SSAA09E1 did not inhibit fusion when added prior to or after the overlay of the two cell types. a previous report showed that SARS-S-driven cell-cell fusion was independent of cathepsin L. the fusion assay was performed by overlaying TZM-bl cells transfected with a plasmid encoding ACE2 on 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding SARS-S and Tat. after 3 h of incubation, 2 g/ml trypsin was added to induce fusion. cell fusion was determined at 6 h postinduction, by measuring luciferase activity. SSAA09E2 targets an \u201cearly\u201d step of SARS/HIV entry, such as initial recognition of the SARS-S RBD by ACE2. ACE2-expressing 293T cells infected with the inhibitors (10 M) were tested for suppression of luciferase activity. we performed a replicon assay with the SARS-CoV replicon in the presence and absence of SSAA09E1, SSAA09E2 and SSAA09E3. as a control, we used SSYA10-001, a compound that we discovered previously in a search for SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13) inhibitors. 3,000 compounds were screened from the Maybridge Hitfinder chemical library. 44 compounds were found to cause 50% reduction in luciferase activity at 10 M. the compounds are SSAA09E1 and SSAA09E3. additional compounds that reduced luciferase activity by 20% to 50% in the VSV/HIV infection assay were considered to be less specific SARS/HIV pseudotyped virus inhibitors. additional compounds that decreased luminescence by 20 to 50% in the VSV/HIV entry experiments were considered to be less specific SARS/HIV pseudotyped virus inhibitors. ACE2-expressing 293T cells were infected with SARS/HIV () or control VSV/HIV pseudovirions in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitors. panels A, B, and C present data for compounds SSAA09E2, SSAA09E1, and SSAA09E3 respectively. cathepsin B has a similar but distinct cleavage specificity from that of cathepsin L. a known specific cathepsin B inhibitor, CA074, was used as a positive control for this assay. a known specific cathepsin B inhibitor, CA074, was used as a positive control. Purified recombinant cathepsin L (2 units/assay mixture) was incubated with a 25 M concentration of a fluorogenic substrate for cathepsin L (Z-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) the specificity of SSAA09E1 was evaluated by testing its ability to block cathepsin B activity. the results establish that SSAA09E2 does not prevent surface expression of ACE2 and likely affects initial recognition of the virus by directly interfering with SARS-S RBD\u2013ACE2 interactions. the purified SARS-S RBD was incubated with purified soluble ACE2 in the presence of increasing concentrations (0 to 20 M) of the three entry inhibitors. fusion occurs at the surface of the cells and not at an endosomal compartment requiring function of cathepsin L. this is consistent with a previous report that showed that SARS-S-driven cell-cell fusion was independent of cathepsin L (60). SSAA09E3 inhibited fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane. SSAA09E1 and SSAA09E3 were effective until at least 3 h postinfection. as a control, we used the known cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK (Calbiochem), which also showed effective inhibition until 3 h postinfection. independent experiments were carried out at the Southern Research Institute and the University of Louisville. the results showed that SSAA09E3 inhibits SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells with a submicromolar EC50. this resulted in a promising selectivity index (>100) HEK 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a SARS-CoV replicon in the presence of 20 M SSAA09E1, SSAA09E2 or SSAA09E3. total RNA was isolated at 48 h posttransfection and analyzed by RT-qPCR as described in the text. potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry were not characterized further because they also inhibited entry of VSV/HIV pseudotyped virions. the current screening strategy could be used to identify compounds that specifically block VSV entry by focusing on inhibitors of VSV/HIV but not SARS/HIV entry. oxazole-carboxamide derivative SSAA09E2 is an oxazole-carboxamide derivative. oxazole-carboxamide derivatives have been described for their inhibitory activities against some host enzymes. these compounds were shown to have good oral bioavailability and high potencies against their targets. after endocytosis of the virus, cathepsin L cleaves SARS-S to S1 and S2, allowing subsequent fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane. SSAA09E1 impedes viral entry by blocking cathepsin L processing of the SARS-S envelope in the endosome, and SSAA09E3 inhibits viral entry. SSAA09E1 did not inhibit ACE2's enzymatic activity. further studies are in progress to test this hypothesis. we determined that only SSAA09E1 can inhibit cathepsin L. SSAA09E3 prevented fusion even after ACE2 and SARS-S interactions were allowed to occur. it remains unclear whether the inhibitor binds directly to the spike protein and interferes with downstream conformational changes required for efficient fusion. SSAA09E2 did not show any significant inhibition after 1 h. low-pH region after endocytosis does not take more than 3 h. it takes 3 h for cathepsin L processing and fusion of the viral envelope to take place postinfection. SSAA09E3 appeared to be more potent in assays with fully infectious virus than in pseudotype-based assays. peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC (6, 76) it is unlikely that inhibitors that directly block spike-receptor interactions, such as SSAA09E2, would affect hCoV-EMC entry. this is not possible to predict whether the inhibitor would also inhibit hCoV-EMC entry."}
