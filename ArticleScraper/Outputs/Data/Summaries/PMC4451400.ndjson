HGF and rhTGF- were analyzed by milliplex Magnetic Human Cytokines/Chemokines Panel-17 Plex (EMD Millipore) protein concentrations were measured according to the instruction manual. fluorescence in the bottom chamber was measured every 2 min for 120 min. rhHGF and rh transforming growth factor induce human hepatocyte growth factor (rhHGF) to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly. IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) moderately, which attract neutrophils. culture medium was collected 24 h after PR8 infection (MOI = 0.5), centrifuged, and mixed with an equal volume of cold methanol for analysis. eicosanoids secretion by lung FBs stimulated by PGE2 and TXB2. to measure the concentration of HGF, TGF-, GM-CSF, and IL-8, we used a human HGF, TGF-, GM-CSF, and IL-8 ELISA (Elisa Tech, Aurora, CO) according to the manufacturers' instructions. the international institute for the Advancement of Medicine deemed this research as nonhuman subject research. donors with reasonable lung function with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of >225, no history of clinical lung disease, a chest radiograph that indicated no infection, and a time on the ventilator of 5 days. the sex, age, race, and smoking history were variable and were not selection criteria. culture medium was changed to DMEM with 5% FBS on day 2 and to DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA on day 3. cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml rhHGF, 10 ng/ml rhTGF- or IAV, Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) strain. cell lysates and culture medium were harvested at 24 h after each stimulation. culture medium was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS on day 2 and to DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA on day 3. human lung FBs were explanted into 100-mm tissue culture dishes. after 3 days, FBs grew out from edge of explants, the medium and remaining explant tissue fragments were removed. human primary ATII cells (1.5 million cells/cm2) were plated on six-well cell culture plates. culture medium was changed to DMEM with 5% FBS on day 2 and to 1 mg/ml BSA on day 3. IL-1, IL-1, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MIP-1, MIP-1, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FB growth factor 2 (FGF2), fractalkine, and growth-related oncogene protein (GRO) rhHGF and rh transforming growth factor induce human alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly. IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) moderately, which attract neutrophils. the culture medium was collected 24 h after PR8 infection (MOI = 0.5), centrifuged, and mixed with an equal volume of cold methanol for analysis. the culture medium was harvested at 48 h to measure HGF concentration by ELISA. polyacrylamide gradient gels were run in Tris-glycine buffer to separate the proteins. protein loading was normalized to GAPDH. the primary antibodies to phosphorylated EGFR (Y1086) and EGFR antibody were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) cells were plated on 12-well cell culture plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml rhHGF, 10 ng/ml rhTGF. sex, age, race, and smoking history were not selection criteria. cell lysates and culture medium were harvested at 24 h after each stimulation. to evaluate the effect of the TGF-/EGFR pathway on IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion by AECs, an EGFR inhibitor (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) was added. s were prepared by explanting minced human lungs into 100-mm tissue culture dishes. the medium consisted of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 2.5 g/ml amphotericin B, and 10 g/ml gentamicin. after 3 days, FBs grew out from the edge of the explants, the medium human primary ATII cells (1.5 million cells/cm2) were plated on six-well cell culture plates. culture medium was changed to DMEM with 5% FBS on day 2 and to 1 mg/ml BSA on day 3. conditioned medium (CM) was harvested at 24 h after infection. human neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors as previously described. cells were labeled with Calcein-AM (2.5 g/ml) in HBSS. fluorescence in the bottom chamber was measured every 2 min for 120 min. IL-8, GM-CSF, IL-6, and MCP-1 protein concentrations in culture medium of human AECs stimulated by 50 ng/ml rhHGF or 10 ng/ml rhTGF- for 24 h. degree of neutrophil migration measured in vitro using conditioned medium AECs stimulated by rhTGF- or rhHGF 2.5. eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), LTE4 and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) in the CM were quantitated. eicosanoids were secretion by lung FBs stimulated by PGE2 and TXB2. the primary antibodies to phosphorylated EGFR (Y1086) and EGFR antibody were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) cytokine concentrations at baseline were variable from human to human, most of the data are shown as a percentage of maximum. rhHGF, eotaxin, G-CSF, IL-1, IL-1, IL-1Ra, IP-10, MIP-1, and MIP-1 were detected at very low concentrations. rhHGF and rhTGF- by themselves did not attract neutrophils, but CM from AECs stimulated by rhHGF and rhTGF- enhanced neutrophil migration. GM-CSF secretion by human AECs. neuregulin, a ligand of EGFR family ErbB3/ErbB2 or ErbB4/ErbB2, did not stimulate IL-8 secretion by the AECs. TGF-, EGFR, and c-Met are expressed in human AECs, but HGF is not. in bronchial epithelial cells, IAV infection leads to TGF- shedding and activation of EGFR, which induces IL-8 secretion and suppresses IFN-dependent IFN- (IL-29) and IP-10 secretion (18, 45) we examined whether IAV infection induced TGF- secretion and altered IFN- and IP-10 secretion by human AECs. the baseline IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs was inhibited by AG1478. influenza virus infection of AECs induces TGF- secretion. EGFR stimulates secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF by AECs. DMSO was a vehicle control for AG1478. the range of maximal stimulation: IFN-, 753.6-5,933.4 pg/ml; IP-10, 1,174.8\u20135,278.9 pg/ml. the previous observations were performed with influenza PR8 strain. PR8 infection induced more IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs cocultured with FBs than AECs alone. PR8 infection induced more IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs cocultured with FBs than AECs alone. ECs that stimulated HGF secretion by lung FBs were stimulated by IL-1 and PGE2 (34) therefore, AECs were infected by PR8 with or without indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, culture medium was collected at 24 h after infection, and this CM was placed on lung FBs with or without IL-1Ra. lung FBs were stimulated by conditioned medium from AECs with or without PR8 (MOI = 0.5) and with or without 10 g/ml IL-1Ra. culture medium was harvested at 48 h after stimulation. rhHGF and rhTGF- stimulate IL-8 and GM-CSF production of alveolar type II (ATII) cells. basal levels of IL-8 and level of IL-8 and GM-CSF stimulated by PR8 are not reduced by the EGFR inhibitor. IL-8 and GM-CSF were strongly upregulated (P 0.0001) and MCP-1 and IL-6 were moderately upregulated (P 0.05) by rhHGF and rhTGF- (n = 6). VEGF, fractalkine, and GRO were detected but not upregulated by rhHGF and rhTGF-. rhAREG and rhHB-EGF did not stimulate IL-8 secretion by human AECs. neuregulin, a ligand of EGFR family ErbB3/ErbB2 or ErbB4/ErbB2, did not stimulate IL-8 secretion by the AECs. TGF-, EGFR, and c-Met are expressed in human AECs, but HGF is not. levels were normalized to the constitutive probe cyclophilin B (CyB) levels were mean SE (n = 3 for each cell type) in bronchial epithelial cells, IAV infection leads to TGF- shedding and activation of EGFR, which stimulates IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs. GM-CSF secretion by PR8 infection was also stimulated by rhTGF-. GM-CSF secretion was also stimulated by PR8 infection at 24 h after infection. the baseline IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs was inhibited by AG1478. DMSO was a vehicle control for AG1478. the range of maximal stimulation: IL-8, 1,250.4\u20137,089.6 pg/ml; GM-CSF, 6.9\u201395.0 pg/ml. previous observations were performed with influenza PR8 strain. c-Met signaling induces IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs. plated on 12-well inserts were infected by PR8 (MOI = 0.5) with or without PHA665752, a c-Met inhibitor, placed over FBs cultured on 12-well plates. both apical and basal medium was harvested and combined at 48 h after infection. GM-CSF, 44.0\u2013953.5 pg/ml. PGE2 secreted by IAV-infected AECs stimulates HGF secretion by lung FBs. previous study from patients with ARDS showed that HGF secretion by lung FBs was stimulated by IL-1 and PGE2. lung FBs were stimulated by conditioned medium from AECs with or without PR8 (MOI = 0.5) and with or without 10 M indomethacin and with or without 10 g/ml IL-1Ra. culture medium was harvested at 48 h after stimulation. rhHGF and rhTGF- stimulate IL-8 and GM-CSF production. basal levels of IL-8 and level of IL-8 and GM-CSF stimulated by PR8 are not reduced by the EGFR inhibitor. 17 cytokines/chemokines were induced by human AECs stimulated by rhHGF and rhTGF-. the maximum levels of IL-8 stimulated by HGF in these experiments ranged from 4.8 to 20.1 ng/ml. VEGF, fractalkine, and GRO were detected but not upregulated by rhHGF and rhTGF-. migration correlated positively with the concentration of IL-8 in the CM. human AECs expressed seven potential EGFR ligands. rhAREG and rhHB-EGF did not stimulate IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by human AECs. mRNA levels of TGF- (A), EGFR (B), HGF (C) and c-Met (D) were measured by real-time PCR. these levels were normalized to the constitutive probe cyclophilin B (CyB) values were means SE (n = 3 for each cell type) rhTGF- and rhTGF- also did not alter IFN- and IP-10 secretion by influenza-infected AECs. GM-CSF secretion was also stimulated by PR8 infection at 24 h after infection. the baseline IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs was inhibited by AG1478. DMSO was a vehicle control for AG1478. range of maximal stimulation: IL-8, 1,250.4\u20137,089.6 pg/ml; GM-CSF, 6.9\u201395.0 pg/ml. previous observations were performed with influenza PR8 strain. rhHGF increased IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs. in the human lung HGF was expressed by lung FBs not by AECs. the HGF receptor c-Met was expressed by AECs. to examine this possibility, AECs plated on 12-well inserts were infected. DMSO was a vehicle control for PHA665752. range of maximal stimulation: GM-CSF, 44.0\u2013953.5 pg/ml. only PGE2 stimulated HGF secretion by FBs (n = 3). other arachidonic acid metabolites such as 5-HETE and 15-HETE were induced by influenza-infected AECs. Ethanol was a vehicle control for PGE2 and TXB2. these cells would be differentiating toward the type I phenotype. they would no longer express some of the type II markers. Influenza virus is known to induce cytokines/chemokines by primary human AECs. in one pathway, IAV induced TGF- secretion that activated EGFR on AECs. the other pathway involved the stimulation of c-Met on AECs. rhHGF and HGF secreted by lung FBs enhance wound closure in human AEC monolayers. c-Met inhibition results in reduced accumulation of neutrophils to the wound site in zebra fish. c-Met signaling regulates IL-8 secretion by pancreatic cancer cell lines. rhHGF, rhTGF-, and influenza virus infection induce GM-CSF secretion by human AECs through c-Met and EGFR activation. however, GM-CSF has also been reported to be induced by EGFR activation in trophoblast cells (7), keratinocytes (24), and bronchial epithelial cells (35). GM-CSF is also known to protect against IAV infection and postinfluenza bacterial pneumonia by activating AMs (13, 37, 41) in the BALF of patients with ARDS, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-8, but not GM-CSF, correlate with severity of pulmonary neutrophilia in ARDS. a key feature of ARDS is the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung. targeting EGFR and/or c-Met to suppress excessive neutrophil accumulation may be a potential strategy for influenza virus-induced ARDS. however, there are several critical issues and limitations. influenza-infected mice treated with an EGFR inhibitor have decreased levels of murine IL-8 homolog, MIP-2, and neutrophils in the lungs. the relative importance of c-Met signaling in vivo on neutrophil accumulation has not been investigated. recombinant HGF stimulates alveolar proliferation and alveolar repair in the mouse during influenza infection. studies using primary human AECs are an important first step in understanding the pathogenesis of influenza viral pneumonia in humans. determining the signaling pathways downstream of c-Met and EGFR responsible for cytokine/chemokine production and epithelial repair in in vivo influenza models might provide insight into potential therapeutic targets."}
