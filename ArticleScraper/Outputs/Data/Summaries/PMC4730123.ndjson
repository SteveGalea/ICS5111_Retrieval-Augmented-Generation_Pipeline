{"summary": "bats play a significant role in the destruction of pests that destroy human crops. they also facilitate the pollination of plants essential for the health of not just humans. bats are estimated to save corn farmers one billion USD globally by preying on agricultural pests. a bat box would cost a rice farmer $28 USD and last at least 10 years with little maintenance. pesticides would cost the farmer $23 USD per year per hectare to use. bat pollination occurs in about 528 plant species worldwide. the IUCN has categorized known bat species from least concern to extinct. five species are listed as extinct and 172 species are listed as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable. the disease currently affects at least seven species of hibernating bats. bat deaths around wind turbines are thought to number in the hundreds of thousands annually. the bats may be attracted to the turbines and mistake them as potential roosting sites. wildflower gardens provide habitat for bats and other wildlife. 95.6% of the bat boxes they surveyed were occupied during the breeding season. number of females with pups in bat houses increased each year during the four years over which their study was conducted. many homeowners have concerns about diseases bats may present to humans. more than 85% of rabies cases in the u.s. were attributable to a single bat species. rabies exposure from bats is comparable to that from dogs and less that from cats. 20% of college students erroneously thought most bats fed on blood. this may help reduce negative attitudes towards bats, which may motivate people to behave more charitably toward these important species. if the public is going to put forth an effort in assisting to save bat populations, they must have a more positive view of bats. researchers aimed to test whether individuals report themselves as more likely to engage in behaviors that would help save bats after attending a bat centered event. it is predicted that after attending an educational conservation program, people will be able to report greater knowledge about conservation efforts affecting bats. a staff member or volunteer from OBC is available near exhibits. the exhibit also includes interactive displays for children to utilize and learn more about bat conservation. participants had to be at least 18 years old to participate. participants at the annual Great Lakes Bat festival and walking through the exhibit \"Superheroes of The Night\" a significant increase in attendees\u2019 knowledge about threats to the well-being of bats, benefits they provide, and ways that humans can help save them. we counted as accurate responses that matched information provided by OBC during the events. all follow-up surveys were completed one week following the event. the annual Great Lakes Bat Festival is an event that informs the public about the unique lives of local bat species. the festival also features of number of activities for both adults and children such as arts and crafts. c) How likely are you to do the following things on a scale of 1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely); Put up a bat house. Plant a wildflower garden. Donate to a campaign such as \u201cSave the Bats\u201d. Attend another event put on by OBC. respondents were able to indicate significantly more threats to bats t (24) = 2.916, p = 0.008, more ways that they could help bats t (24) = 5.308, p 0.001 and more ways in which bats benefit the environment t (24) = 6.245, p 0.001. twenty-two participants indicated where and how they learned about bat conservation. six participants indicated that they learned about bat conservation from the live bat exhibit. the remaining four participants indicated that they learned about bat conservation from other sources such as books. more research aims to sample individuals who may not already have an interest in bats. such individuals may include college students who do not necessarily have an interest in bats. future sampling methods aim at providing a more representative sample of the general public. bats are critical to the future of our ecosystems and depend upon human intervention to continue to thrive."}
