{"summary": "cardioviruses comprise an important genus of the Picornaviridae family of positive-sense RNA (+RNA) viruses. the type species Cardiovirus A, or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), ostensibly infects mice but is capable of infecting a range of mammals, including humans. there are no approved antiviral therapies to treat picornavirus infections. the spectrum of antiviral activity of these agents is limited (10\u201312) one host factor required for the replication of both enteroviruses and cardioviruses is the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of enterovirus ROs is well characterized. early in infection, enteroviruses induce the formation of single-membrane tubular ROs that gradually transform into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multilamellar vesicles over the course of infection. putative transition states between single-membrane tubules and DMVs were found that mirror the transformation intermediates observed for enterovirus ROs (21) this chronological progression of RO morphology contextualizes the previous observations of single- or double-membrane EMCV ROs. we then investigated whether PI4KA plays a role in the formation of EMCV ROs. analyses were fixed between 3 and 9 hpi. the exponential phase of RNA synthesis spanned 3 to 6 hpi. the increase in viral titer lagged by 2 h. these RNA replication dynamics aligned well with increasing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) immunofluorescence signal. between 4 and 5 hpi, dsRNA signal was found at small foci distributed throughout the cytoplasm. from 6 hpi, membrane modifications became increasingly clustered into large regions that dominated the cytosol. the abundance of double-membrane structures increased (Fig. 2B, asterisks), although single-membrane structures persisted. late in infection, double-membrane vesicles became more dominant (Fig. 2C, white asterisks), and multilamellar structures were also found. double-membrane structures were often predominant and multilamellar membrane structures were found. increase in total ROs over this period is expressed as RO counts per m2 of cytoplasm. electron tomography reveals the 3D architecture and transformation of ROs. EMCV-infected cells at 5 hpi reveals connections between single-membrane ROs and ER. EMCV-infected cells were infected with EMCV and frozen at 5 hpi for EM processing and serial tomography. tomogram comprises five consecutive sections of 200-nm thickness from a representative cell. sections through the tomogram volume showing SMVs in red, SMTs in blue, and ER in green, recognizable by the membrane-associated ribosomes (arrowheads) sections through the tomogram alongside their corresponding 3D model cutaways reveal connections between SMVs (red) and ER (green) (B) and between SMTs (blue) and ER (green) ( tomograms were populated with models of simulated particles by randomly generating coordinates within the cytosolic space of the tomogram volume. the cumulative frequency distributions of the observed and generated data were significantly different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, P 0.0001). the complete tomogram volume (0.4 m by 2.3 m by 2.3 m by 2.3 m) of the region featured in Fig. 4A is shown, which represents a typical region in an infected cell at 7 hpi. similar structures were found in tomograms of EMCV-infected cells. tubular extensions of the outer membranes of DMVs were also found. similar electron-dense material was observed both in the lumen of single-membrane structures (Fig. 5A, black arrowheads) and within the intermembrane space created by these tubular extensions (Fig. 5B, black arrowheads) enwrapping mechanism of SMT-to-DMV transformation could explain presence of virus particles within a subset of DMVs. intermediate structures found in EMCV-infected HeLa cells at 7 hpi. cells were incubated with 10 g/ml dactinomycin to label newly synthesized RNA. after chemical fixation and preparation for EM, sections were processed for autoradiography. substantial autoradiography signal could be found clustered around areas containing exclusively single-membrane tubules and vesicles. PI4KB, a PI4P-generating kinase, accelerates the formation of enterovirus ROs (20) to investigate possible roles during EMCV RO formation of PI4KA, an essential PI4P-generating kinase for cardiovirus replication. the mutant, generated through serial passaging of wild-type (wt EMCV) in cells with a stable knockdown of PI4KA, is capable of establishing replication even in the presence of the PI EMCV 3A-A32V infection under PI4KA inhibition produced single- and double-membrane cardiovirus ROs. connections between single-membrane ROs and the ER were still found. morphology of ROs and time postinfection at which ROs were first detected were not affected. cells were infected with EMCV 3A-A32V, treated with PI4KA inhibitor, metabolically labeled, chemically fixed at 7 hpi. autoradiography signal (electron-dense grains) accumulated at RO clusters, similar to observations of wt EMCV infection. single-membrane and double-membrane structures found at earlier stages of infection were morphologically identical to those formed during wt EMCV infection. dsRNA signal clusters in the perinuclear Golgi region under PI4KA inhibition. the trans-Golgi network marker TGN46 was labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals) and secondary Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for immunofluorescence analysis. the exponential phase of RNA synthesis spanned 3 to 6 hpi, while the increase in viral titer lagged by 2 h. these RNA replication dynamics aligned well with increasing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) immunofluorescence signal, which provides a secondary indication of viral replication. between 4 and 5 hpi, dsRNA signal was found at small foci distributed throughout the cytoplasm, which became larger and more clustered as from 6 hpi, membrane modifications became increasingly clustered into large regions that dominated the cytosol. the abundance of double-membrane structures increased (Fig. 2B, asterisks), although single-membrane structures persisted (Fig. 2B, arrowheads) late in infection, double-membrane vesicles became more dominant. double-membrane structures were often predominant and multilamellar membrane structures were found. increase in total ROs over this period is expressed as RO counts per m2 of cytoplasm. electron tomography reveals the 3D architecture and transformation of ROs. both SMVs and SMTs were smooth-membrane structures. they were often found connected to rough ER (green) by neck-like membrane connections. some DMVs seemed to be partially enwrapped by additional cisternae late in infection. sections through the tomogram and corresponding models reveal connections between SMVs (red) and ER (green) (B) and between SMTs (blue) and ER (green) (C) the site of the connection is indicated with a black arrowhead. bars, 500 nm (A) or 100 nm (B and C) ribosome (white arrowheads) and virus particle (black arrowhead) morphology in a single tomogram section. bars, 500 nm (A) or 100 nm (B to D) distribution of EMCV virions relative to nearest RO membrane in HeLa cells infected with EMCV at 7 hpi. copyright 2018 Melia et al.

RNA synthesis occurs at single- and double-membrane structures. cells at early stages of infection revealed autoradiography signal (electron-dense grains) clustered around areas with single-membrane structures. newly synthesized RNA was also evident at RO foci comprised of DMVs at later stages of infection. PI4KB, a PI4P-generating kinase, accelerates the formation of enterovirus ROs (20). PI4KB is an essential PI4P-generating kinase for cardiovirus replication. the mutant is capable of establishing replication even in the presence of the PI4KA inhibitor A1. EMCV 3A-A32V infection under PI4KA inhibition produced single- and double-membrane cardiovirus ROs. the clustered dsRNA signal found under inhibition partially localized in the perinuclear Golgi region. connections between single-membrane ROs and the ER were still found. wt EMCV cells infected with EMCV 3A-A32V were frozen at 5 or 7 hpi. autoradiography signal (electron-dense grains) accumulated at RO clusters. the virus-induced single-membrane and double-membrane structures were morphologically identical to those formed during wt EMCV infection. cells were infected with EMCV 3A-A32V at an MOI of 75 with or without 10 nM A1 treatment. PI4KA inhibition led to clustering of dsRNA signal (green) around the perinuclear region in foci that were often proximal to the TGN46 signal (red) many of the SMTs and SMVs visualized at early stages of infection were also found connected to the ER. this finding is supported by the reported reliance of cardioviruses on ER-associated proteins like PI4KA and colocalization of calreticulin and RO-associated viral proteins. the interior of open DMVs could represent a shielded environment for replication at later stages of infection. a similar enwrapping mechanism could also underlie the formation of sparse double-membrane structures among abundant single-membrane structures identified in 2D EM investigations of foot-and-mouth disease virus infection. PI4P is an essential lipid for the replication of picornaviruses (16, 18, 45) it is generated at the ER or the Golgi apparatus by PI4KA and PI4KB respectively. expression of a mutated HCV NS5A has been shown to produce ROs with irregular morphologies. PI4K inhibition shifted subcellular distribution of EMCV dsRNA. PI4P is also required for efficient polyprotein processing in enteroviruses. it is unclear whether the different morphologies generated provide specific benefits. both single- and double-membrane ROs were found to support cardiovirus RNA synthesis. coronaviruses or HCV produce spherules or DMVs. RNA synthesis transpires predominantly on the early single-membrane structures. positive-curvature single-membrane structures appear to represent a third major form of RO. hexamer primers were used with a TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit. PCR was carried out using a lightCycler 480 (Roche) for 45 cycles (5 s at 95\u00b0C, 10 s at 60\u00b0C, and 20 s at 72\u00b0C) on a lightCycler 480 (Roche) postfixation consisted of a 1-h incubation with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer followed by a 1-h incubation with 1% uranyl acetate solution. sections of 50 nm were collected on Formvar-coated EM grids, poststained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. for this, a thin layer of silver halide photographic emulsion (Ilford sections of 70 nm were collected on EM grids and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. for tomography, thicker sections of 200 nm were collected. the gold fiducial markers were digitally erased to be eliminated. tilt series of the same region across 2 to 5 consecutive sections were collected and combined in IMOD to build tomogram volumes with a z-thickness of 400 to 1,000 nm. the maximum widths of SMTs, SMVs, and DMVs were considered the RO diameters. image segmentations were made from tomograms using Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) a nucleoSpin RNA kit was used to isolate RNA from lysed cells. random hexamer primers were used with a TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit (Roche) to synthesize cDNA. infected cells were preincubated with 10 g/ml dactinomycin for 1 h. cells were then labeled for 45 min with tritiated uridine ([5-3H]uridine; 1 mCi/ml) also containing dactinomycin. postfixation consisted of a 1-h incubation with 1% osmium tetroxide. freeze substitution device for 44 h in solution of 20% H2O, 2% osmium tetroxide, and 1% anhydrous glutaraldehyde. temperature was then raised to 0\u00b0C over a period of 22 h. sections of 70 nm were collected on EM grids and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. tilt series acquisition was performed using Xplore3D software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) tilt series alignment and tomogram reconstruction by weighted back-projection were performed in IMOD (52)."}
