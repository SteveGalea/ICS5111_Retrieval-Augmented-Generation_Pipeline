{"summary": "viral metagenomics has been performed in healthy wildlife using random PCR and next-generation sequencing (6\u20139). the most widespread member of the order Carnivora is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) foxes were provided by hunters according to Dutch wildlife regulations in the Netherlands in 2012. samples of foxes were collected in a monitoring program for parasites in foxes. all foxes were collected in southern Flevoland, the Netherlands. library of DNA fragments was sequenced on a 454 GS Junior instrument (454 Life Sciences, Roche). Obtained sequence reads of all individual fecal samples were analyzed by removing adaptor and primer sequences. contigs and single reads were analyzed according to nucleotide and translated nucleotide (BLAST). 7% of sequences had relatively low homology to known viruses. a subset of these novel viruses were further characterized. new genera (Bufavirus and Partetravirus) within this subfamily have been proposed recently. reads were detected that showed >95% identity to the sequence of fox parvovirus. two major open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. one major ORF coding for the putative nonstructural (NS) protein (nucleotides [nt] 137 to 2191) and another ORF coding for the structural protein VP2 (nt 2674 to 4425) phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree with p-distance and 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the deduced amino acid sequences of VP2 genes of various viruses of the subfamily Parvovirinae. acid sequences of the NS1 and VP2 gene of the fox parvovirus were aligned with various other parvoviruses using ClustalW in MEGA5 (23) a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated using the alignment of the VP2 and the NS1 sequences. fox parvovirus was not similar to sequences of canine and feline parvoviruses. fragment of novel virus, tentatively called fox bocavirus, is most closely related to the pine marten bocavirus and bocavirus detected in swine (7, 26, 27) reads were detected related to the VP1 gene of porcine adeno-associated virus Po3 (28) feces of fox 4 were aligned with fragments of the VP1 gene of various other adeno-associated viruses. one fragment of the polyprotein gene of 362 nt and one fragment of the capsid protein of 295 nt were amplified. 454 sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing on PCR amplicons obtained using specific primers. both fragments were most closely related to hepatitis E viruses detected in rats. fox hepeviruses are small nonenveloped, unsegmented RNA viruses. fox astroviruses are small nonenveloped, unsegmented RNA viruses. the highest number of reads obtained by 454 sequencing related to astroviruses was detected in fox 5. the partial genome of a novel astrovirus was identified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing on overlapping PCR amplicons. the 3\u2032 end was obtained using the first Choice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, TX) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. indicated are the locations of three major ORFs (1a, 1b, and 2). the locations of the start and stop codons on the nucleotide level starting from the known sequence of Fox astrovirus at the 5\u2032 end. the poly(A) tail and a ribosomal frameshift (A)6C sequence are indicated. foxes 2, 7, and 8, reads were present with >95% homology on the nucleotide level with the fox astrovirus F5. the sequence of this second novel astrovirus corresponds to nt 2608 to 2939 of the complete genome of porcine astrovirus 4 strain 35/USA (ORF1b) (46) the genome of this novel picobirnavirus was partially confirmed by Sanger sequencing using specific primers. obtained sequences of the RdRp gene were most closely related to the human picobirnavirus VS-10 and human picobirnavirus 1. foxes 5 and 9, picobirnaviruses were detected that are divergent from fox picobirnavirus F5-1. picobirnaviruses were detected in fox 7, fox 7 and fox 7. it is unknown whether these viruses can cause disease in foxes. the newly discovered viruses of the present study are examples of the diversity of viruses that are present in wildlife. a timely identification of reservoir animal hosts in case of novel outbreaks of disease in humans is crucial in mitigating infectious threats. some of the detected sequences had identities of more than 90% on the nucleotide level with known sequences of the genera Parvovirus genus. some of the detected sequences had identities of more than 90% on the nucleotide level with known sequences of the genera Parvovirus genus. reads were detected that showed >95% identity to the sequence of fox parvovirus, indicating that this virus is present in feces of multiple foxes included in this study. two major open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, with one major ORF coding for the putative nonstructural (NS) protein. codons on the nucleotide level starting from the known sequence of fox parvovirus at the 5\u2032 end are indicated by white areas. the predicted coding fragment of the VP1 is indicated based on a spliced transcript (white bar) with predicted splicing donor AAGAG|GTCAG and acceptor (TTTAG|GTTGG) sites. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the NS1 and VP2 gene of fox parvovirus were aligned with various other parvoviruses. fox parvovirus may belong to either the genus Parvovirus or to a new genus. reads were detected that were related to bocaviruses detected in swine and pine martens. bocavirus SX/China/2010 (27) was aligned with various partial VP1 genes of similar lengths of viruses of the genus Bocavirus. a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was prepared on the basis of this alignment. this fragment of this novel virus, tentatively called fox bocavirus, is most closely related to the pine marten bocavirus and bocavirus detected in swine. sequences were detected with the highest homology to hepatitis E viruses detected in rats, birds, trout, and, recently, in bats and ferrets (32, 33, 33) foxes 3 and 5 were most closely related to hepatitis E viruses detected in rats, birds, trout, and, recently, in bats and ferrets. ecal material of foxes, viruses of the family of Hepeviridae are present. it is unknown whether this virus is circulating among foxes or is derived from their prey (e.g., rats) serology could be used to measure infection of foxes with this virus. the highest number of reads obtained by 454 sequencing related to astroviruses was detected in fox 5. the partial genome of a novel astrovirus was identified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing on overlapping PCR amplicons using specific primers. indicated are the locations of three major ORFs (1a, 1b, and 2). the locations of the start and stop codons on the nucleotide level starting from the known sequence of Fox astrovirus at the 5\u2032 end. foxes 2, 7, and 8, reads were present with >95% homology on the nucleotide level with the fox astrovirus F5. foxes 2, 7, and 8, reads were present with the highest homology to astroviruses other than fox astrovirus F5. the genome of this novel picobirnavirus was partially confirmed by Sanger sequencing using specific primers based on 454 sequencing reads. obtained sequences of the RdRp gene were most closely related to the human picobirnavirus VS-10 and human picobirnavirus 1. in foxes 5 and 9, picobirnaviruses were detected that are divergent from fox picobirnavirus F5-1. the picobirnavirus detected in fox 7 had 99% homology to fox picobirnavirus F5-1 on the nucleotide level. it is unknown whether these viruses can cause disease in foxes. rat hepatitis E viruses are close relatives of the fox hepevirus. transmission of fox hepevirus to humans may occur as well. new viruses of the present study are examples of the diversity of viruses present in wildlife."}
