{"summary": "the use of chloroquine in the clinical management of a viral infection was first considered in the 1990s, on the basis of its effects on HIV-1 [6,7] the drug is now being tested as an investigational antiretroviral [8] chloroquine inhibited the viral cytopathic effect with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 14.38 M, in cells infected with the H5N9 virus at approx. 104 50% tissue culture infecting doses (TCID50)/ml. the inhibitory effects were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcritptase real-time PCR. cell supernatants were used for viral RNA extraction and subjected to a quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRRT-PCR) assay. both results obtained with inocula containing 104 and 103 TCID50/ml are reported. chloroquine inhibited the H3N2 virus (10 4 TCID50/ml) with an EC50 of 1.53 M. inhibition was confirmed using qRRT-PCR, both under similar conditions and at lower MOIs. results obtained with H1N1 viruses showed a similar drug susceptibility for the human strain (EC50 = 1.26 M) but no response to clinically achievable drug concentrations in an avian strain (IC50 > 20 M; data not shown ammonium chloride (NH4Cl; 40 mM), a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. results showed a good response of the chloroquine-sensitive virus to NH4Cl inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity (100% inhibition under conditions described above) Conversely, the lower chloroquine-sensitivity of H5N9 virus was associated with lack of response to NH4Cl. the electrostatic potential was mapped on the protein surfaces of 3D models. results showed a negative correlation between the isoelectric point of HA2 and the IC50 of chloroquine in vitro. however, no correlation was found with the isoelectric point of HA1 (P > 0.05; data not shown) the electrostatic potential is mapped to the protein surface as a range of colours from red (-1.8 V) to blue (+1.8 V) the timing of drug inhibition should match that of virus/cell fusion, an early step of virus replication occurring in endosomes. Isobologram analysis showed that the two drugs exerted an additive effect (sum of FICs = 1). this result provides further evidence that chloroquine inhibits viral replication by a mechanism different from that of one major anti-influenza drug. if this timing was correct, chloroquine should inhibit influenza A replication by a novel mechanism. chloroquine is a weak base that affects acid vesicles leading to dysfunction of several proteins. it has been shown to inhibit different viruses requiring a pH-dependent step for entry. this is consistent with chloroquine inhibition of pH-dependent steps at an early phase of influenza A virus replication. data support the hypothesis that the step of virus replication inhibited by clinically relevant chloroquine concentrations is the low-pH dependent haemagglutinin-mediated virus/cell fusion. the correspondence between antiviral effects and isoelectric point of HA2 is consistent with this mechanism. acidic pH in the endosomal compartment also activates the influenza virus ion channel, M2, that promotes the uncoating of influenza virus in endosomes. pH critically determines the antiviral activity of chloroquine by regulating virus/host cell interactions. sensitivity to chloroquine may vary in different cell populations susceptible to influenza A virus infection. viral RNA was extracted from infected cell supernatants (QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit \u2013 Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and amplified by RRT-PCR using primers and probe targeting a highly conserved region of the matrix gene of influenza type A viruses. qRRT-PCR was used to generate standard curves for quantification of the vRNA in cell supernatants. cell monolayers were washed twice with serum-free MEM. fresh medium containing TPCK-trypsin and chloroquine at different concentrations or NH4Cl (40 mM) was then added to culture wells in triplicate. cytotoxicity measurements were based on viability of cells infected with influenza viruses. RNA sequencing Hemagglutinin genes of H3N2 and H1N1 viruses were sequenced using gene-specific primers. sequence data so far unpublished will be deposited in GenBank by the time of publication of the present article. titration was performed by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in MDCK cells. virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at -70\u00b0C until used. RNA extraction and qRRT-PCR was employed. of 1.5 105 cells/ml MDCK cells in growth medium was seeded into each well in the 96-well microtiter plate. cells were washed twice with serum-free MEM. 100 l of the Type A influenza viruses under study were inoculated in wells. MDCK cells were infected with 100 l of medium containing approximately 104 TCID50 of H3N2 subtype. after 1 hour of adsorption, cell monolayers were washed twice with serum-free MEM and incubated in fresh medium containing TPCK-trypsin and chloroquine at a concentration of 10 M. eight hours post-infection, cell supernatants were collected, viral RNA was extracted and the antiviral activity was LC participated in the experimental design, data analysis and molecular modelling. EV, SN and DDO conducted the assays for antiviral activity. AC conceived and coordinated the entire study."}
