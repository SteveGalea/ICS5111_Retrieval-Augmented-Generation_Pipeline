{"summary": "the stockpile includes vaccines, antiviral drugs, and PPE. the stockpile includes vaccines, medical materials, and life-maintaining equipment. the stockpile includes vaccines, antiviral drugs and PPE. the NESS contains a variety of MCMs, including medical equipment and PPE, pharmaceuticals (antiviral agents, antibiotics, chemical and biological antidotes), social service supplies (generators, cots, blankets, blankets, flashlights), and units or kits (mini-clinics, reception center kits, etc.) these supplies have been distributed domestically and internationally in response to a variety of public health events and emergencies. the savings for P2 respirators and antibiotic rotation over 10 years would be less than 1%. the stockpile includes surgical masks, gloves, gowns, and N95 respirators. the stockpile is rotated by national hospitals and clinics. there are 11 federal warehouses for stockpiling MCMs with a 24-hour response capability. the NESS contains medical equipment and PPE, pharmaceuticals, and social service supplies. the stockpile has been distributed domestically and internationally in response to a variety of public health events and emergencies. the department of health is implementing the policy of stock rotation through suppliers for some antibiotics and P2 respirators. a 10% to 15% rotation rate of P2 respirators was made possible. the savings for P2 respirators and antibiotic rotation would be less than 1%. nationwide minimum stockpile of PPE included 3 million N95 respirators, 1.5 million coveralls, and 25 million surgical masks. in 2006, the nationwide minimum stockpile was adjusted to 2 million N95 respirators, 800,000 coveralls, and 7 million surgical masks. the stockpile in the central health authority is for nationwide epidemic control and emergency dispatch. the CDC reviewed and evaluated different stockpile models in other countries and developed a replacement model for PPE stockpile management in the central health authority. the concept is to combine the replacement of the large reservoir with the consumption of small reservoirs. the oldest stockpile of the large reservoir is regularly replaced and immediately replenished with the same amount of PPE by private contractors. warehouse management, stockpile replacement, and joint procurement are all carried out by private contractors. the private contractor must provide exclusive storage space, adequate temperature and humidity control, and security management. to ensure the quality of storage, regular inventory checks are conducted by the Taiwan CDC. service fee for surgical mask replacement is only 27% of the original purchasing cost. a total of NT$3.55 million is saved over a 4-year contract. a total of NT$13.46 million is saved over a 4-year contract. 95 surgical masks, 152,000 surgical masks and 152,000 surgical masks to support the taiwan Bureau of animal and plant health inspection and quarantine (BAPHIQ) the replacement model is designed for market sales, and therefore the success of these procurement projects depends on the market acceptability, market circulation, and sales channels. private contractors play an important role in maintaining inventory, replacing the oldest stock, acquiring new and qualified products for replenishment in the central health authority. the validity period of the released items from the central stockpile is about 212 years on average, and that of the replenished new products is 5 years. contractors must guarantee to provide 5 million surgical masks, 100,000 N95 respirators, and 15,000 coveralls within 14 days in response to an emergency request from the Taiwan CDC. the platform also provides order statistics, information about warehouse environment monitoring, historical replacement records, and other information for the Taiwan CDC. the service fee includes the manual and computational process the contractors need to refresh the stockpile. the replaced surgical masks were sold to domestic institutions via the joint e-purchasing platform. this model could play a modulating role in material supply and successfully ease the surge demand in an emergency. in response to the avian flu epidemic in 2015 in Taiwan, the CDC immediately provided 128,500 coveralls, 147,040 N95 respirators, and 152,000 surgical masks. the CDC established a 3-tier framework for the national stockpile in 2003 and implemented a replacement model for PPE in 2011. this replacement model has been proven to be more economical and efficient over traditional purchasing practices."}
