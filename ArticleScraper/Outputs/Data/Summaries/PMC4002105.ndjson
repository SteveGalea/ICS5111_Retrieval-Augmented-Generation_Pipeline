{"summary": "IFITM3 knockout mice succumb to sublethal doses of virus (10, 11) a deleterious polymorphism in the human IFITM3 gene has been associated with increased severity of infection in at least three independent studies. many questions remain regarding its mechanism of action, cellular trafficking patterns, and regulation by cellular enzymes. we also reported ubiquitination of IFITM3 occurring on four lysines. this modification negatively regulates IFITM3 by targeting the protein away from endolysosomes for degradation. phosphorylation by the protein-tyrosine kinase FYN on tyrosine 20 (Tyr20) has been reported.

IFITM3 constructs were expressed from the pCMV-HA or pCMV-myc vectors as described previously. mutants were made using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit. plasmid expressing human FYN was provided by Dr. Marilyn Resh. fluorescence microscopy Cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked for 10 min with 2% FBS in PBS. primary antibodies, anti-myc (1:500), anti-FYN (1:500), and anti-CD4 (directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 1:100, BD Biosciences, catalog no. 557695) infected cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 0.25% trypsin EDTA. cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. all antibodies were diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. IFITM3 constructs were expressed from the pCMV-HA or pCMV-myc vectors as described previously. mutants were made using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit. plasmid expressing human FYN was provided by Dr. Marilyn Resh. anti-FLAG (Sigma, catalog no. F7425), anti-HA (Clontech, catalog no. 631207), anti-IFITM3 (Abcam, catalog no. ab65183), and anti-GAPDH (Invitrogen, catalog no. 398600). primary antibodies, anti-myc (1:500), anti-FYN (1:500), and anti-CD4 (directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 1:100, BD Biosciences HEK293T cells were infected at a multiplicity of 2.5 for 6 h. infected cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 0.25% trypsin EDTA. cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. IFITM3 constructs were expressed from the pCMV-HA or pCMV-myc vectors as described previously. Mutants were made using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) fluorescence microscopy Cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. primary antibodies, anti-myc (1:500), anti-FYN (1:500), and anti-CD4 (directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 1:100, BD Biosciences, catalog no. 557695) HEK293T cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 for 6 h. infected cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 0.25% trypsin EDTA. cells were stained with anti-myc and anti-influenza nucleoprotein. tyrosine phosphorylation of both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 could be detected. tyrosine-specific phosphorylation clearly occurs primarily on Tyr20/27. tyrosine-specific phosphorylation clearly occurs primarily on Tyr20/27. cells were cotransfected overnight with the indicated myc-tagged hIFITM3 (B) or mIFITM3 (C) constructs and either a vector control or a plasmid expressing FYN. cells were then treated for 1 h with sodium orthovanadate. blots are representative of at least three experiments. mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 mutants express no detectable amount of endogenous IFITM3 but lose anti-influenza virus activity. mutation of Tyr27, although phosphorylatable, has no apparent effect on antiviral activity of mIFITM3, and Tyr27 does not compensate for mutation of Tyr20. fluenza virus activity of both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 is necessary for complete antiviral activity against influenza virus. HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with the indicated IFITM3 constructs or a vector control infected for 6 h with influenza virus strain PR8 at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5. cells were then fixed and stained with anti-myc and anti-influenza nucleoprotein to confirm the expression of IFITM IFITM3 in the absence of FYN was localized in punctate clusters intracellularly. the effect was seen for both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3. this effect mimics the effect we also observed for Tyr20 mutants. representative merged fluorescent confocal microscopy images for nuclear staining (DAPI, blue) and anti-myc staining (red) are shown for some conditions to confirm FYN expression or the lack thereof. we found that Tyr20 may be part of an endocytosis signal that can be blocked by phosphorylation or perturbed by mutating Tyr20. conservative mutation of the residue in hIFITM3 to valine (L23V) and a non-conservative mutation to the polar residue glutamine (L23Q) mutants were redistributed, including visible plasma membrane localization similar to what we saw previously with Tyr20 mutants. the YEML motif from hIFITM3 causes internalization of CD4. results provide evidence that the hIFITM3 YEML motif functions as an endocytosis signal that can be regulated by FYN-mediated phosphorylation. 293T cells were cotransfected overnight with the indicated myc-tagged IFITM3 constructs. anti-myc and anti-fyn blotting were performed. single arrows and doubleheaded arrows indicate monoubiquitinated and diubiquitinated. 293T cells were cotransfected overnight with the indicated HA-tagged IFITM3 constructs and a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) anti-HA immunoprecipitation was performed followed by anti-HA and anti-FLAG blotting. results in A\u2013C are representative of at least three experiments. ated residue Tyr20 results in decreased antiviral activity of IFITM3. we first sought to confirm that human (h) IFITM3 is phosphorylated. for these experiments, we used a murine fibroblast cell line deficient in SRC, YES, and FYN kinases (SYF cells) blots suggest additional phosphorylation sites may exist on IFITM3. tyrosine-specific phosphorylation occurs primarily on Tyr20/27. blots are representative of at least three experiments. tyrosine phosphorylation by FYN is not a requirement for its antiviral function. IFITM3 is active in the absence of FYN. cells were transfected for 18 h with control siRNA (siCont) or siRNA targeting IFITM3. mutation of Tyr27, although phosphorylatable, has no apparent effect on antiviral activity of mIFITM3 and hIFITM3. mutation of Tyr27 does not significantly compensate for mutation of Tyr20. results are presented on a log2 scale for ease of visualizing differences between WT IFITM3 and tyrosine mutants. mutation of this residue results in retention of IFITM3 at the plasma membrane (5, 23) but these experiments did not address whether phosphorylation of Tyr20 or the Tyr20 residue itself is necessary for IFITM3 internalization. IFITM3 phosphorylation or mutation affects IFITM3 localization. mutation of Lys24 does not affect IFITM3 localization or activity. mutation of Lys24 does not affect IFITM3 localization or activity. the 20YERI23 sequence of mIFITM3 conforms to this pattern. the 27YEVA30 motif involving Tyr27 does not play a major role in IFITM3 cellular distribution or antiviral activity. to test the hypothesis that the 20YERI23 sequence in IFITM3 is an endocytosis signal, we made a conservative mutation of the residue in hIFITM3 to valine (L23V) and a non-conservative mutation anti-CD4 staining showed outlining of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding WT myc-tagged CD4. under the same conditions, minimal staining of a CD4 construct containing the YEML peptide was observed. the YEML motif from hIFITM3 causes a robust internalization of CD4. we identified this banding pattern as ubiquitination through the use of mass spectrometry, anti-ubiquitin blotting, and lysine mutagenesis (4). we transfected mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 into 293T cells with or without overexpression of FYN. the bands at the expected molecular weight were largely unaffected by FYN. anti-myc and anti-fyn blotting were performed. B, 293T cells were transfected overnight with the indicated HA-tagged IFITM3 constructs and a plasmid expressing FYN. the results in A\u2013C are representative of at least three experiments. mutagenesis of the phosphorylated residue Tyr20 may suggest that phosphorylation is necessary for the function of IFITM3 (23). tyrosine phosphorylation of both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 could be detected, in accordance with the conclusion that FYN can indeed phosphorylate hIFITM3 (23) hIFITM3 is phosphorylated solely on Tyr20, whereas mIFITM3 phosphorylation can occur on both Tyr20 and Tyr27. this band does not correlate directly with anti-phospho-tyrosine blots, suggesting additional phosphorylation sites on serine or threonine residues may exist on IFITM3. murine fibroblast lines express a basal amount of IFITM3 that limits infection of these cells. we performed siRNA knockdown of IFITM3 in SYF cells. percentage of infected SYF cells increased significantly upon knockdown. HEK293T cells are a commonly used cell line for the analysis of IFITM3 mutants. they express no detectable amount of endogenous IFITM3, are readily transfectable, and retain the ability to be highly infected with influenza virus even after transfection. the mutants lose anti-influenza virus activity, as determined by an established flow cytometry assay. myc-positive cells were gated as in A and analyzed for percentage of infection on the basis of anti-influenza nucleoprotein staining. the average percentage of infection of cells expressing WT mIFITM3 was set to 1 for the calculation of relative fold infection. IFITM3 phosphorylation or mutation affects IFITM3 localization, including plasma membrane accumulation. both phosphorylation and Tyr20 mutation result in a similar change in the cellular distribution of IFITM3. the 20YERI23 sequence of mIFITM3 conforms to the pattern of a YXX motif. the 27YEVA30 motif involving Tyr27 does not play a major role in IFITM3 cellular distribution or antiviral activity. representative merged images for nuclear staining (DAPI, blue) and anti-myc staining (red) are shown. the YEML sequence of hIFITM3 functions as an endocytosis signal. permeabilized cells stained with anti-myc antibody for confocal fluorescent microscopy. representative merged images for nuclear staining (DAPI, blue) and anti-myc staining (red) are shown. 293T cells were cotransfected overnight with the indicated HA-tagged IFITM3 constructs and a vector control or a plasmid expressing FYN. anti-myc and anti-myc blotting were performed, and anti-myc blotting was performed. mIFITM3 constructs were chosen for this experiment because of the availability of the mIFITM3-Ub construct. we also previously generated a palmitoylation-deficient mIFITM3 construct (Palm) that does not have a defect in ubiquitination that served as an additional control (4). phosphorylation of mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 could be detected. FYN can indeed phosphorylate hIFITM3 (23). mIFITM3 phosphorylation is a dynamic and reversible process. lysates were subjected to anti-FYN and anti-actin Western blotting or anti-myc immunoprecipitation. blotting for anti-phospho-tyrosine (p-Tyr) and anti-myc is representative of at least three experiments. the average percentage of infection of siCont cells was set to 1 for the calculation of relative fold infection. HEK293T cells are a commonly used cell line for the analysis of IFITM3 mutants because they express no detectable amount of endogenous IFITM3. tagged IFITM3 constructs or a vector control infected for 6 h with influenza virus strain PR8. cells were then fixed and stained with anti-myc and anti-influenza nucleoprotein. myc-positive cells were gated on the basis of lack of staining in the vector control. IFITM3 in the presence of overexpressed FYN was redistributed, including accumulation at the plasma membrane. this effect was seen for both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 and mimics the effect we also observed for Tyr20 mutants. our imaging results suggest that Tyr20 may be part of an endocytosis signal that can be blocked by phosphorylation or perturbed by mutating Tyr20. previous IFITM3 mutagenesis has shown that the 17PPN19 residues immediately prior to Tyr20 are dispensable for antiviral activity. a YXX endocytosis motif was identified in IFITM3. the YEML motif from hIFITM3 causes a robust internalization of CD4. the YEML motif from hIFITM3 causes a robust internalization of CD4. mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected overnight with myc-tagged CD4 or CD4-YEML constructs. A, non-permeabilized or permeabilized cells were stained with anti-CD4 antibody for fluorescent microscopy. representative merged images for nuclear staining (DAPI, blue) and anti-CD4 staining (red) are shown. Tyr20 mutants of both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 showed decreased intensity of ubiquitinated bands. a Tyr27 mutant of mIFITM3 was ubiquitinated similarly to WT mIFITM3. anti-HA immunoprecipitation was performed, followed by anti-HA and anti-FLAG blotting. the results in A\u2013C are representative of at least three experiments. we cotransfected HA-tagged mIFITM3 and tyrosine mutants with FLAG-ubiquitin. cross-talk between phosphorylation and ubiquitination has been documented extensively for multiple other proteins. phosphorylation often serves as a signal for modification by E3 ubiquitin ligases. ubiquitination may have been expected that IFITM3 phosphorylation would promote ubiquitination. the sequence 17PPNY20 in both mIFITM3 and hIFITM3 presents a potential E3 ligase interaction motif because it conforms to the PPXY pattern recognized by HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases. it remains to be determined what effect relocalization of IFITM3 upon Tyr20 mutation or upon increasing FYN activity would have on its range of viral restrictions."}
