{"summary": "geneomics is systematically transforming medicine The \u201cGenomic Revolution\u201d has transformed our vision and understanding of how living organisms and systems interact with each other and with the environment. the science of genomics serves as the foundation for translational research for advancing the management of many important diseases [2]\u2013[7]. sequencing and other molecular technologies are everyday tools-of-the-trade in every district hospital and laboratory in hotspots of emerging infectious disease. accelerated advances in the area of infectious diseases can occur under a global collaborative framework composed of discrete and delineated activities between the public and private sectors. a coordinated Infectious Disease Genome Project (IDGP) could unify sequencing efforts, enhance data usability, and lead to essential tools for infectious disease management. a standard approach to generating depth and diversity in genomic data is essential; beyond this, continuous real-time surveillance and characterization of evolving pathogens can help effectively forestall future epidemics/pandemics. system could be facilitated by virtual community collaboration or crowd-sourcing, taking full advantage of networking tools such as Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, FusionTables, and PLoS. a single interface would link accurate, annotated sequencing information to functional genomic and proteomic/functional proteomic information. the IDGP would need to determine what the world requires in terms of genomic information. continuous real-time surveillance and characterization of evolving pathogens can help effectively forestall future epidemics/pandemics. a clear roadmap to generating a complete genomic picture of all infectious agents, emerging threats, hosts, and reservoirs would enhance data generation and application. a single interface would bring various sample collections together in formally structured biobanks. centralizing the entire spectrum of information and analytic tools also allows researchers in resource-limited settings to participate in the genomics revolution without prohibitively costly machines, laboratories, and sample accessibility. rapid technical innovation and investment from cheap netbook computers to new fiber optic cables are changing that equation. a single framework, is a difficult proposition, but many will find this perspective too grandiose. it may just be possible that the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic is a enough of a reminder of what is at stake to provide a catalyst for action. google.org has supported global public health through its \u201cPredict and Prevent\u201d initiative."}
