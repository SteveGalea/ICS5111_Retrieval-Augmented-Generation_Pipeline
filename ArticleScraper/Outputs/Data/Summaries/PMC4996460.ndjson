{"summary": "leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi) is an intracellular protozoon that cause a severe systemic disease called visceral leishmaniasis (VL) it is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Basin, Middle East, and South America. it has an annual incidence of approximately 500,000 cases [2]. leishmune\u00ae provided protection associated with the ability to trigger early and persistent activation of neutrophils and monocytes. the leish-Tec\u00ae vaccine (Hertape Calier, Juatuba, Brazil; A2 antigen plus saponin as adjuvant) has also been shown to induce increased levels of IFN- and nitric oxide (NO), thus supporting its leishmanicidal effect. LBSap-vaccinated dogs showed high IFN- and low interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 expression in the spleen. also, LbSap has been shown to induce a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response characterized by increased levels of both IL-12 and IFN- and decreased levels of TGF- by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. previous studies of dogs using the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine showed higher animals were born and bred in the kennel facility at Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto in ouro preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. the kennel facilities were sprayed with pyrethroid insecticide, every three months, as a measure to control insect access. animals were monitored twice a day, as routine inspection, during which the responsible veterinary was in charge of stimulating and playing with them. the animals were maintained with water and food ad libitum throughout the experiment time. all animals received three injections in the right flank at 28days intervals. intradermal 107 promastigotes were used during the stationary phase of cultivation. the challenge was performed in the inner side of the left ear including five Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland acini. spleens were collected to evaluate parasite loads. the whole blood samples were added over 10mL of Ficoll-Hypaque. the PBMCs were centrifuged at 450g for 40 min at room temperature. the PBMCs cultures were performed in 48-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. analysis of IL-12, IL-23 p40, catalog number DY1969), IFN- (anti-canine IFN-, catalog number DY781B), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and IL-10 (anti-canine IL-10, catalog number DY735) cytokines were performed using DuoSet ELISA. 100L of Griess reagent (1% sulfanylamide, 0.1% naphthylethylene-diamide-dihydrochloride, and 2.5% phosphoric acid) was mixed with 100L aliquot of cell-free culture supernatant. the final nitrite concentration was determined based on a standard curve interpolation constructed by using sodium nitrite solutions. primers 5\u2019TTCCACGGCACAGTCAAG 3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019 ACTCAGCACCAGCATCAC 3\u2019 (reverse) were used for GAPDH gene amplification. spleen parasite load was performed in duplicate and calculated by interpolation from the standard curve included in the same experimental batch. 2.8.2 (Institute of Systems Biology, Seattle, USA) for each experimental group (Control, \u201cSal\u201d, \u201cLbSal\u201d and LBSapSal) in all times analyzed (T0, T3rd, T90, and T885) based on correlations indices obtained by Pearson correlation analysis. the significance were considered at P0.05. animals were kept in quarantine in kennel runs (4m length x 2m width x 3m height) kennel facilities were sprayed with pyrethroid insecticide every three months. each run was installed with an infrared lamp heating (250 watts) to ensure the thermal comfort of animals during the night and on cold days. all dogs received three injections in the right flank at 28days intervals. the challenge was performed in the inner side of the left ear including five Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland acini. Lutzomyia longipalpis females were not fed, aged 4 days, and dissected in slightly hypotonic unbuffered saline 0.8%. after collection, glands were disrupted in a sonicator for 10 seconds and centrifuged at 10,000g for 2min. the supernatant was collected and stored in a freezer at -80\u00b0C. cytokine sensitivity detection levels were 62pg/mL (IL-12), 63pg/mL (TNF- and IFN-), 78pg/mL (IL-4 and IL-10) and 31pg/mL (TGF-) all experiments were performed according to instructions of R&D Systems using 96-well plates. microplate reader (EL800; Biotek, Winosski, VT, USA) was employed at a wavelength of 450nm. the WizardTM Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to extract total genomic DNA in 20mg of spleen following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. primers 5\u2019TTCCACGGCACAGTCAAG 3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019 ACTCAGCACCAGCATCAC 3\u2019 (reverse) were used to analyze the spleen parasite burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison were used for comparisons of cytokine profiles, NO levels and parasite load amongst the experimental groups. Pearson correlation analysis was further applied to evaluate the relationship between spleen parasite burden and NO profiles. the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were measured in supernatants from PBMCs cultures maintained upon vaccine-soluble antigen (VSA) or soluble Leishmania chagasi antigen (SLcA) stimuli in vitro. data were analyzed at baseline before vaccination (T0), 15 days after third immunization dose (T3rd) as well as early (90 days\u2014T90) and late (885 days\u2014T885) after experimental L. chagas analysis of IL-12 showed that the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group displayed increased levels (P0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with the same cultures in the \u201cControl\u201d, \u201cSal\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups. the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed reduced IL-12 levels (P0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d group (Fig 1B, middle panel). data analysis late after L. chagasi-challenge (T885) showed that the \u201cLbSal\u201d group displayed increased TNF- levels (P0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the \u201cControl\u201d group. no differences in the IL-12 levels were observed amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. data were analyzed at baseline before vaccination (T0), 15 days after third immunization dose (T3rd) as well as early (90 days\u2014T90) and

IL-4 (A) and IL-10 (B) the symbol Sal indicates significant differences in comparison to the \u201cSal\u201d group. the levels of TGF- were measured in supernatants from PBMCs cultures maintained upon vaccine-soluble antigen (VSA) or soluble Leishmania chagasi antigen (SLcA) stimuli in vitro. data were analyzed at baseline before vaccination (T0), 15 days after third immunization dose (T3rd) as well as early (90 days\u2014T90) and late (885 days\u2014T885) after experimental L. chagasi-challen the hallmark of the cytokine network in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group is a balanced immune response regarding positive correlation between pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN-, TNF-) and regulatory cytokines (IL-10) Aiming to identify the overall balance of the evaluated cytokines, we have applied machine-learning approaches to analyze the cytokine network for all immunization protocols generated upon SLcA and VSA-stimuli in vitr the cytokine balance was calculated as the IFN-/IL-4 and IFN-/IL-10 ratio for all experimental groups. the results re-enforce that ability of \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine to induce a long lasting IFN- production over the synthesis of both IL-4 and IL-10, regardless the antigen-stimuli. the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group showed strong positive correlation among TNF- and IFN- with IL-4. negative correlations were also observed amongst TNF- and IFN- with IL-10. a sustained prominent reduction in spleen parasite load was observed in \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group later on after L. chagasi-challenge. stigotes per20ng of total DNA control 6 Asymptomatic

VSA or SLcA-stimulated cultures. the symbols C, Sal and LbSal indicate significant differences. the groups are distinguishable by colors as follows. the control of leishmania chagasi (syn. leishmania infantum) infection in dogs is essential to stop the current spread of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis. a vaccine against VL would be an important tool for controlling CVL. the establishment of biomarkers of immunogenicity is considered critical in the rational approach for analyzing candidate vaccines. reduction in the levels of IL-4 after vaccine immunization against CVL has been considered a biomarker for protection against leishmania infection. the \u201cControl\u201d group has presented increased amounts during the late (T885) post-challenge period. analysis of TGF- revealed reduced production in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d-immunized group during the early and late post-challenge periods. analysis of TNF- before vaccine immunization (T0) showed increased levels in SLcA-stimulated cultures in the \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cLbSapSal\u201d groups. similar results were observed for IL-12 and IFN- at T0. this strategy demonstrated enhanced levels of IL-12 and IFN- post-vaccination. cytokine network indicated a balanced immune response in the \"LbSapSal\" group. positive correlations between IL-4 and type I cytokines (IFN-, IL-12, TNF-) and negative correlations showed a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response in the \"LbSapSal\" group. salivary proteins of a sand fly protect against the fatal outcome of visceral leishmaniasis. the experimental challenge in vaccine studies against canine visceral leishmaniasis is considered crucial to analyze the protection performance. leishmanial activity of macrophages, increased levels of IFN- in PBMCs supernatants, in dogs immunized with a vaccine comprising crude antigens of L. infantum. the establishment of a polarized type I immune response after \u201cLbSapSal\u201d immunization supported increased levels of NO production, favoring a reduction in parasitism. the x-axis displays the different experimental groups according to the in vitro stimuli (control culture [CC], VSA or SLcA) the y-axis represents the cytokine ratio (IFN-/IL4 and IFN-/IL-10) the connecting lines represent significant difference (P 0.05) amongst the CC, VSA or SLcA-stimulated cultures."}
