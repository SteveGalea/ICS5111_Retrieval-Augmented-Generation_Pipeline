{"summary": "transcytosis of HIV-1 has been studied as a possible mechanism to translocate virus from mucosal surfaces to deeper-lying CD4+ cells. in vitro, only a very small amount of virus finds its way through cells into the medium bathing basolateral surfaces ([9]. antibody in genital tract secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals could play a role in facilitating the transport of virus across mucosal epithelia. a characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [24]. a large amount of ejaculate may raise the pH to the neutral range. the pH of rectal secretions ranges from 6.8 to 7.2 [30] acidic pH and Env-specific IgG enhance transcytosis of HIV-1. transcytosis of four of five clade C transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped viruses was enhanced in a pH and antibody-dependent manner. indicated concentrations of HIV-specific IgG (HIVIG) or control IgG (IVIG) and 2 ng of p24 were added to the apical surface of HEC-1A cells at pH 6.0 or 7.4. IgG from serum of clade C-infected or uninfected subjects was used at 50 g/ml. results are mean+SE of two independent experiments at pH 6.0. 6.0 with 200 g/ml of HIVIG or 100 g/ml mAb 2F5. impact of both antibody and low pH suggested FcRn involvement. knock-down HEC-1A cells attained the same level of electrical resistance as wild-type cells. we compared two different IgG1 mAbs, b12 and HGN194, with their IgA class-switched versions. both enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV1157ipEL-p at pH 6.0, whereas the IgA class-switched versions did not. mAb IgG1 b12 or its dimeric (dIgA2 b12) and monomeric (mIgA2 b12) class-switched versions and mAb IgG1 HGN194 or class switched variants dIgA1 HGN194 and dIgA2 HGN194 were tested for transcytosis. the effect of FcRn-mediated transcytosis on IgG alone does not appear as strong as the effect on IgG immune complexes. this difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of IgG by the epithelial cells at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4. all Env-specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM-bl cells. however, there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity (IC50) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis (Spearman's rho = 0.86; p = 0.001). Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG, F240 and transcytosis (pH 6.0) of HIV-1JRFL by (A) poorly neutralizing HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240 and (B) neutralizing mAbs 4E10, 2F5, 2G12, VRC01 and b12. compared to den3, there was more infectious virus with F240 (p = 0.036) and with b6 (p = 0.068). IgG purified from genital tract secretions enhances transcytosis at pH 6.0. the ability of genital tract IgG to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG. none of the genital tract IgGs were able to neutralize HIVUS657. the dotted line represents a negative cutoff based on the mean+2 SD of IgG from cervicovaginal and seminal fluid of the HIV-uninfected subjects. the dotted line represents a negative cutoff based on the mean+2 SD of IgG from cervicovaginal and seminal fluid. expression was previously reported in human uterine and vaginal epithelial cells. a similar staining pattern was observed in foreskin tissue. a similar staining pattern was observed in foreskin tissue. subnatant fluid virus was quantified in the medium bathing the basolateral cell surface (\u201csubnatant fluid\u201d) by RT-PCR and expressed as a percentage of inoculum applied to the apical surface of the clade C transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped viruses. transcytosis was measured at 12 hours. data represent mean+SE of eight independent experiments. p = 3.6108 comparing HIVIG at pH 6.0 with IVIG at pH 6.0. p = 3.4106 comparing HIVIG at pH 6.0 with HIVIG at pH 7.4. pg of p24 (about 500 RNA copies) with 2F5 amounts too small to be detectable in subnatant fluid in the absence of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibody. the effects of both antibody and low pH suggested FcRn involvement. a mutant designed to abrogate FcRn binding (I253A) markedly lowered transcytosis compared with wild-type b12. the second mutant (M428L), designed to bind with higher affinity to FcRn, increased transcytosis compared with wild-type b12. enhanced transcytosis at low pH in the presence of specific antibody is mediated by IgG and is dependent on FcRn. transcytosis was performed with wild-type and FcRn knockdown cells in parallel at pH 6.0 or 7.4 using HIV-1US657. all mAbs were tested at 50 g/ml. data represent mean+SE of two independent assays for each virus. no significant difference between IgG and IgA versions at pH 7.4. the ability of HIVIG and a panel of mAbs with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH-dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV-1JRFL. both poorly neutralizing antibodies (HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240; Figure 3A ) and neutralizing mAbs (4E10, 2F5, 2G12, VRC01, and b12; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6.0. b12, resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody. strong binding activity results in more FcRn-dependent transcytosis. strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious. infectivity of HIV-1JRFL whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing or (D) neutralizing antibodies. all antibodies resulted in transcytosed virus that was infectious. less infectious virus was transcytosed with b12 (p = 3.41011), VRC01 (p = 6.91010), and 2G12 (p = 3.6104) to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG. none of the genital tract IgGs were able to neutralize HIVUS657. higher concentrations of genital tract IgGs generally resulted in greater infectivity of the transcytosed virus. the dotted line represents a negative cutoff based on the mean+2 SD of IgG from cervicovaginal or seminal fluid of the HIV-uninfected subjects. both cervicovaginal fluid IgG (D) and seminal fluid IgG (E) mediate transcytosis of infectious virus. genital tissues were also stained with negative control (non-specific) IgG. the secretions of HIV-infected individuals have antibody capable of coating virus contained in those secretions. thelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra suggest that these sites could play a major role in FcRn-mediated immune complex transcytosis. this is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for FcRn in immune complex shuttling across tissues [34], [35], [43]. cytosed virus remained infectious only when complexed with poorly neutralizing antibody. the first study to investigate transcytosis using virus coated with HIV-specific antibody in an acidic environment that mimics that of the female genital tract. in vitro observations are applicable to male-to-female transmission via vaginal intercourse. the pH of cervicovaginal fluid following ejaculation is dependent on the quantity of the ejaculate and may stay within an acidic range. the penis comes in contact with vaginal secretions that would remain at acidic pH at least until ejaculation. this would allow time for exposure of penile tissues, including the foreskin and urethra, to IgG-coated virus at low pH. cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of 3 g/ml. all of our samples mediated transcytosis at 12.5 g/ml of total IgG. anti-gp41 IgG levels were 11-fold higher than gp41-specific IgA levels. we are currently evaluating whether transmitted/founder strains are preferentially transcytosed. this would be consistent with a report showing a higher sensitivity of clade B transmitted/founder strains to anti-Env antibody binding [51]. if an antibody protects, enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity, the viral strain, the inflammatory state of the exposed individual. if an antibody protects, enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity, the viral strain, the inflammatory state of the exposed individual. gG immune complexes can prime CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in an FcRn-dependent manner. we have demonstrated that FcRn mediates enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 in the presence of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibody. our findings point toward a novel mechanism by which the sexual transmission of HIV-1 may be facilitated. pEL-p was grown in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells. antibodies HIVIG (IgG derived from pooled plasma of HIV-infected individuals) and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 2F5, 4E10, 2G12, F240, b6, and VRC01 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagents Program.

Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kits (BD Biosciences) were used to fix, permeabilize and stain cells. Knockdown of FcRn was also confirmed by western blot using rabbit anti-FcRn antibody (Novus Biologicals) neither wild-type nor knockdown HEC-1A cells stained for FcRIIa or FcRIIIa. the alkaline phosphatase immunohistology technique was described previously. two anti-FcRn antibodies were used: anti-fcRn antibody purified from rabbit serum raised against 2 (88\u2013177aa) and 3 (1782-247aa) domains of human FcRn. cell lines, cell culture media, and viruses Human Endometrial Carcinoma (HEC-1A) cells (ATCC) were propagated in Modified McCoy's 5a Medium, and Human Colon Carcinoma (T84) cells (ATCC) in modified Eagle's medium. media were supplemented with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Invitrogen Technologies), 1% Penstrep (Cellgro Mediatech Inc.) and 10% IgG1 HGN194 (a human mAb against HIV-1 Env V3), dIgA1 HGN194, and dIgA2HGN194 variants were constructed as follows: human J chain precursor (accession number NP_653247), dIgA1 HGN194, and dIgA2HGN194. supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7\u201310 days of culture. dIgA1 and dIgA2 were affinity purified by Peptide M (dIgA1 and dIgA2) or Protein A (IgG1) chromatography. purified Abs were quantified by native-PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography. Virus capture assay Half-area 96-well plates were coated with 5 g/ml (250 ng/well) of goat anti-human antibody and incubated over night at 4\u00b0C. plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk. plates were washed and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. antibodies were added in serial dilutions and incubated for 45 min. plates were read at 450 nm using a plate reader (BioTek) all subjects gave written consent in accordance with an IRB-approved protocol.
