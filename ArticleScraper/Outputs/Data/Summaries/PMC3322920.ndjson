{"summary": "a centralized surveillance system was set up for a probable case of SARS in france. all persons who returned from an area affected by recent transmission were advised to call the emergency service. each notified case was either discharged, kept as a suspect case, or classified as a probable case using the WHO SARS case definition (10,11) one-step nested RT-PCR targeting either the BNI fragment or the CDC fragment of the polymerase gene was used (7,13) the other RT-PCR was the nested RT-PCR targeting the CDC fragment. flight of the AF171 flight of march 22\u201323 2003 was followed for 10 days by the air France medical service. we obtained a detailed description of his clinical condition, his movements in the aircraft, the contacts he may have had with other persons on board, and the timing of his boarding and deplaning. a person with a symptomatic probable case had traveled was informed publicly through the media and mail of the potential exposure. RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV in at least three of the respiratory secretion samples taken on at least 2 different days after onset of symptoms. acute and convalescent serum samples were obtained for four of the probable cases, and seroconversion to SARS-CoV occurred in three samples. for patient D, the only respiratory samples available for RT-PCR were taken on day 2 after onset. seven people sat within two rows of patient A during the AF 171 flight. they indicated that patient A was breathing rapidly (superficial polypnea) and exhibited extreme pallor and pursed lips during the entire flight. at each move, he passed through the space between the plane wall and seat 25K. passengers seated in rows 28 and 24 were excluded. patient A and B used the front lavatory (WC1) while patient C used the one in the back (WC4). one developed SARS (case B, seat 25K), which accounted for an incidence density rate of 1 per 100 person hours of exposure. three healthcare workers who cared for patient D had brief episodes (24 hours) of mild fever without any respiratory symptoms and chest x-ray changes. RT-PCR on nasal and pharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV. the time at which respiratory specimens were taken could account for the fact that virus shedding remained undetected for one patient (patient D) a household contact of patient D had a febrile illness (>38\u00b0C) without any other symptoms and tested negative for the SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. patient C was neither found to have close contact with patient A nor other documented exposure. he had been traveling to Thailand, a country where local transmission has never been reported by WHO (18)."}
