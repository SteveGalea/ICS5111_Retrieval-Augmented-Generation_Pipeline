{"summary": "penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in china and Southeast Asia. miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. dcl-2 showed higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P0.001) penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing respiratory, skin and systemic mycosis in Southeast Asia [1]\u2013[4]. the fungus was first discovered in Chinese bamboo rats, Rhizomys sinensis, and subsequently isolated from other species of bamboo rats [7], [7]. emergence of the HIV pandemic in the 1980's has resulted in increasing reports of HIV-associated P. marneffei infections in Southeast P. marneffei exhibits distinct cellular morphologies in different temperatures, in mycelial phase at 25\u00b0C and yeast phase at 37\u00b0C. hyphae can differentiate to produce conidia which are believed to be the infectious form being inhaled to the lungs of infected hosts. microRNAs or miRNAs play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants. miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) have been identified in animals, plants, viruses and unicellular organisms. the existence of miRNAs and their roles in fungi has been less well understood. two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding quelling-deficient-2 were also identified. the differential expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, in mycelial phase, was dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. small RNA libraries were constructed for mycelial and yeast phases of P. marneffei. total RNAs from both mycelial and yeast phases were extracted. 10 g of total RNAs from both mycelial and yeast phases were treated with RNA-Seq. small RNA analyses Sequence reads were processed to remove low quality reads, adaptor and adaptor-dimer sequences, and nuclear and mitrochondrial rRNA sequences. small RNA sequences between 17\u201330 nt were selected to identify perfect matches to the genome using Bowtie (0.12.8) putative dcl-1, dcl-2 and qde-2 genes in P. marneffei were searched using BLASTP algorithm. introns were predicted by performing pairwise alignment with the annotated Talaromyces stipitatus and P. marneffei strain ATCC 18224 genome sequence. qde-2 and qde-2 respectively, and 465 nucleotides positions of ITS, were used for analysis. domains were predicted using the Conserved Domains Database of NCBI and PFAM. qde-2 LPW12718 5\u2032-GACCTGCAGGACACATCACCAAGTGAAGTGTCAC-3\u2032 LPW12719 5\u2032-GACCTGCAGCTTGTCAC-3\u2032 LPW12719 5\u2032-GACCTGCAGCTTGTCAC-3\u2032 Upstream of dcl-1 LPW10929 5\u2032-GAAGATCTCTTCTTTTGCGGTCTG-3\u2032 (BglII and SfoI and Sfo GGCCATAGAGCTTCGG-3\u2032 LPW22066 5\u2032-TCGGCCAAAACGTCCCTTTG-3\u2032 LPW22067 5\u2032-CTCATCTCTTGAGCGTGCAC-3\u2032 dcl-2 LPW13347 5\u2032-GTGTGAAGCTGG-3\u2032 cDNA amplification LPW22069 5\u2032-GATGCAAAATCTTGGAATGG-3\u2032 cDNA amplification LPW22069 5 LPW20742 5\u2032-CCGCTCGAGGACGCACAAAACAATGCAAA-3\u2032 pSilent-1 cloning locus LPW20743 5\u2032-CCCAAGCTTGGGGTATTGCCGTTGATCCATCG-3\u2032 (XhoI-HindIII) LPW23656 5\u2032- TTGCCAATAACAAAGACTCTTC-3\u2032 qPCR LPW23657 5\u2032- TCTTAGTCATAGCATGC flanking sequences upstream and downstream of dcl-1, dcl-2 and qde-2 were amplified by PCR using DNA extracted from strain PM1. PCR products of upstream and downstream flanking fragments were ligated into corresponding restriction sites of plasmid pAN7-1 to generate the knock-out plasmids pAN7-dcl-1, pAN7-dcl-2 and pAN7-qde-2. smids pAN7-1 and pAN8-1 were used to construct knockout plasmids of pAN7-dcl-1, pAN7-dcl-2, pAN7-qde-2 and pAN8-dcl-1 respectively. smids pAN7-1 and pAN8-1 were used to construct knockout plasmids. locus, plasmid pSilent-1 [53], obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center, was used to construct the pSilent-1 plasmid as previously described. the internal fragments (sense and antisense) were amplified with primers shown in Table 1 and cloned into the XhoI-HindIII and BglII-KpnI sites of pSilent-1 plasmid, resulting in P. marneffei strain PM1 was isolated from a patient with culture-documented penicilliosis in Hong Kong.

PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 predicted to bind complementary sequences imperfectly. predicted targets include putative RanBP10, a putative benzoate 4-monooxygenase cytochrome P450 and a conserved hypothetical protein. 20 potential targets were predicted, which include 13 transposon or transposable elements and seven conserved hypothetical proteins. RNAi proteins such as Dicer and Argonaute have been identified in many fungi, such as the model filamentous fungus N. crassa and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. no endogenous miRNAs have been reported in fungi until 2005. the presence of milRNAs in human pathogenic filamentous and dimorphic fungi was largely unknown. we have previously shown that target gene expression can be specifically knocked down by an RNAi-based method in P. marneffei [36], [40]. Moreover, two dcl genes encoding putative dicer-like proteins and a qde-2 gene encoding a putative Argonaute-like protein, QDE-2, can be identified in P PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 expressed in mycelial phase. they share similar characteristics to miRNAs in animals and plants. dimorphic fungi may encode milRNAs which are likely conserved regulators of gene expression in diverse eukaryotes. dcl-2 gene of P. marneffei is more closely related to the homologues in other geographically restricted thermal dimorphic fungi than to P. chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp. this suggests that the dcl-2 gene may have co-evolved among the thermal dimorphic fungi. this suggests that the dcl-2 gene may have co-evolved among the thermal dimorphic fungi and serve a recent study showed some milRNAs are differentially expressed in sclerotial development of S. sclerotiorum [31] milRNAs were shown to cause transgene silencing via the canonical RNAi pathway and proposed to be play a role in regulating transposons and pseudogene expression. this suggests that DCL-2 may function predominantly in the mycelial phase. the present study demonstrated the potential role of differential post-transcriptional control in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi. this may provide new insights into the mechanism governing thermal dimorphism."}
