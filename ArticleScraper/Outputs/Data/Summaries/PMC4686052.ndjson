{"summary": "the treatment of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) has been challenging, although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced the number of new cases of HIV infection. the damage caused by HIV infection is gradual and multi-staged, and ends in AIDS (3). studies have reported that Arg I regulates the bioavailability of L-arginine, which is involved in certain immune-associated pathological processes. iNOS hydrolyzes L-arginine into NO, which is important in destroying parasites, bacteria, viruses and cancer cells. LNs were routinely collected during surgery from the neck (n=27), armpit (n=20) and groin (n=5) at the same time, 10 ml peripheral blood was collected from the patient and control groups. exclusion criteria included the presence of cancer, infection and autoimmune diseases. 1,100 g for plasma separation followed by HIV RNA extraction using a Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test kit (version 2.0; Roche Diagnostics) the viral load was quantitatively measured using a Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 test kit (version 2.0; Roche Diagnostics) sections were treated with 1.5% H2O2 (Beijing Chemical Works) in methanol (Beijing Chemical Works) to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-iNOS antibody. the staining intensity above the background level was scored as follows: 1, 25%; 2, 26-50%; 3, >51%. the final score was the product of the above two scores: 0, negative (); 1-2, weakly positive (+); 3-4, positive (++); 6-9, strongly positive (+++). iNOS antibody (cat. no. ab15323; rabbit polyclonal; Abcam) or isotype control antibody (cat. no. IC0041P; monoclonal mouse IgG2B; clone 133303; R&D Systems) was added to one tube containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells and one tube containing LN mononuclear cells. cells in the iNOS group were incubated with goat anti-rabbit I enlarged peripheral LNs were recruited from the 302 Hospital of PLA (Beijing, China) and the 4th People's Hospital of Nanning (Nanning, China) between July 2009 and October 2014. enlarged peripheral LNs were routinely collected during surgery from the neck (n=27), armpit (n=20) and groin (n=5) 50 l whole blood was collected and incubated with 10 l antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. 1X BD Multitest IMK kit lysis solution was added to the tubes. after 15 min of incubation, CD4+T cells were counted using flow cytometry. xylene (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) washed three times with PBS, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2; ZLI-9062, ZSGB-BIO) sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-iNOS antibody. positive cells contained brown granules. phosphate-buffered saline was used in place of primary antibody. samples were evaluated semi-quantitatively by two pathologists. the cells in the iNOS group were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-allophycocyanin (cat. no. ab130805; polyclonal; Abcam) for 15 min at 20\u00b0C and fixed in 1% parafor-maldehyde for 24 h. Flow cytometry was performed within 24 h using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) continuous variables were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences between groups. correlation was evaluated using Pearson's or Spearman's correlation analysis. expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral LNs were positive in the (A) control group and strongly positive in the (E) asymptomatic group and (F) symptomatic AIDS group. expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the superficial LNs of the control group, asymptomatic group and symptomatic AIDS group. the frequencies of CD8+ T cells positive for Arg I in the peripheral blood were significantly higher, compared with the control (P0.05), and those positive for iNOS in the peripheral blood were significantly lower, compared with the control (P0.05). however, the frequencies were similar between these patient groups (P>0.05). compared with the (A) control, the (E) asymptomatic group and (F) symptomatic AIDS group had a significantly higher frequency of peripheral CD8+ T cells positive for Arg I and iNOS. numbers represent the percentages of cells in the indicated boxes. values are expressed as the mean standard deviation from at least three experiments. Arg, arginase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; LN, lymph node; AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. the peripheral CD4+ T cell count was negatively associated with the frequencies of iNOS+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells positive for Arg I in the peripheral blood. however, the peripheral CD4+ T cell count was positively associated with the frequencies of iNOS+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood. viral load was positively associated with the frequencies of Arg I positive CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and LNs. however, the viral load was negatively associated with the frequencies of iNOS positive CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood. load was positively associated with the frequencies of Arg I positive CD8+ T cells in the (A) peripheral blood and (B) LNs. also negatively associated with the frequencies of iNOS-positive CD4+ T cells in the (E) peripheral blood and (D) LNs. numbers of iNOS positive cells in the peripheral superficial LNs were negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell count. the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral LNs were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. the results showed that Arg I was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. expression levels of Arg I in the patient groups were almost positive or strongly positive. immunohistochemical scores for expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the superficial LNs of the control group, asymptomatic group and symptomatic AIDS group. Flow cytometry was performed to further assess the changes in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells. the frequencies of CD8+ T positive for Arg I in the peripheral LNs were significantly higher (P0.05), and those positive for iNOS were significantly lower (P0.05), compared with the control. the frequencies did not differ significantly among the patient groups (P>0.05). numbers represent the percentages of cells in the indicated boxes. Arg, arginase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; LN, lymph node; AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. numbers represent the percentages of cells in the indicated boxes. group and symptomatic AIDS group had significantly higher frequency of peripheral CD8+ T cells positive for Arg I and iNOS in the superficial LNs. compared with the (D) control, the (E) asymptomatic group and (F) symptomatic AIDS group had a significantly lower frequency of peripheral CD8+ T cells positive for Arg I. 4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood (r=0.690; P0.01 and r=0.604; respectively) and peripheral LNs (r=0.596; P0.01 and r=0.604; respectively) correlation between the peripheral CD4+ T cell count with the frequencies of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral blood and LNs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. the viral load was negatively associated with the frequencies of iNOS positive CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood. however, the viral load was negatively associated with the protein expression of Arg I in the LNs. the frequencies of iNOS-positive CD4+ T cells in the (E) peripheral blood and (F) LNs. the frequencies of iNOS-positive CD8+ T cells in the (G) peripheral blood and (H) LNs are important sites for proliferation. immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to detect expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in peripheral T cells and LNs. compared with controls, asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV infected patients showed increased frequencies of Arg I positive CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and LNs. Arg I downregulates CD3-chain expression, inhibits expression of cell cycle regulatory protein D3 and cell cycle regulatory protein-dependent kinase 4. in myeloid cells, Arg I downregulates CD3-chain expression, and inhibits expression of cell cycle regulatory protein D3 and cell cycle regulatory protein-dependent kinase 4. this mechanism is important in immunosuppression of certain inflammation-associated conditions. a reduction in L-arginine causes a decrease in NO through the iNOS pathway (11) the competition between Arg and iNOS is pivotal in the immune response to infection and determines the course of infection. the reduced synthesis of NO may directly impair innate immunity and affect anti-infection ability. the reduction in NO due to the competition between Arg and iNOS is also important in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. the reduction in NO due to the competition between Arg and iNOS is also important in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis and hypertension. abnormalities in expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in peripheral blood and LNs may be a contributor to compromised immunity in patients with HIV. the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the T cells of peripheral blood and LNs may be as a potential parameter to predict disease progression."}
