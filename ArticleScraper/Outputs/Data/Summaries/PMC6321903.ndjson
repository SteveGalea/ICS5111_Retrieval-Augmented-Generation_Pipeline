{"summary": "cellular antiviral signaling is initiated upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the host. RLRs activate signal transduction pathways, resulting in the production and secretion of type I interferons. secreted IFN-/ triggers the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. SGs are highly dynamic cytoplasmic aggregates. SGs are highly dynamic cytoplasmic aggregates. the local enrichment of nucleating factors and mRNPs most likely constitute a warning signal in the cell. pro also cleave signaling molecules of the IFN-/ signaling pathway. caliciviruses encode NS6, a 3C-like protease, which also cleaves G3BP1 to prevent SG assembly. other viral proteins have also been suggested to affect SG formation. aphthoviruses suppress the cellular stress response through the action of the viral protease Lpro. aphthoviruses can suppress the cellular stress response through the action of the viral protease Lpro. the stress response pathway is suppressed during FMDV infection. SGs were visualized by anti-G3BP1 staining, while viral replication was monitored by staining for the capsid protein VP1. in LFPK v6 cells, FMDV replication is relatively fast; virus production and release can be observed as early as 5 h postinfection (hpi) immunofluorescence staining was performed for the viral capsid protein VP1 (green) and the SG marker G3BP1 (red) LFPK v6 cells were infected with FMDV-A12, treated with 500 M sodium arsenite for the last 30 min to induce SG formation. mutation of the zinc-finger domain of EMCV L slightly reduced vRNA levels. heterologous expression of either FMDV or ERAV Lpro rescued viral replication to levels similar to those of wild-type (wt) EMCV. expression of 3Cpro (EMCV-F3C and EMCV-E3C) did not affect vRNA levels. SG sizes were analyzed for at least 50 cells per condition. one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance. SGs were visualized using immunofluorescence microscopy. IFN response is beneficial to the replication of EMCV-FL and EMCV-EL. we generated an EMCV encoding a catalytically inactive FMDV Lpro (EMCV-FL C51A) to determine if the inhibitory effect of Lpro on SG formation is dependent on Lpro\u2019s catalytic activity. LFPK v6 cells were infected with wild-type FMDV or LLV. SGs were visualized by anti-G3BP1 staining. similar amounts of VP1 were observed in cells infected with wild-type FMDV. aphthovirus proteases have an effect upstream of SG assembly. to this end, we assessed the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 by using flow cytometry. we observed increased levels of phosphorylated PKR and eIF2 in EMCV-LZn-infected cells. LFPK v6 cells were infected with wild-type FMDV-A12 or A12-LLV. lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a G3BP1 antibody. cleavage products migrate at apparent molecular weights of 65 kDa and 43 kDa. western blot analyses were performed for SG proteins G3BP1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and viral proteins VP1 and Lpro. cells were infected with ERAV at an MOI of 10 or treated with 5 g/ml actinomycin D. avages of G3BP1 and G3BP2, but not TIA-1, were observed. we observed a large cleavage product that migrated at 65 kDa and a doublet that ran at 40 kDa. however, we barely detected an 43-kDa cleavage product in ERAV-infected cells. cleavage of G3BP1 and G3BP2 in aphthovirus-infected cells is the result of a direct intervention of a viral protease. it has been suggested that EMCV infection triggers G3BP1 cleavage via 3Cpro (28). this would prevent us from investigating whether aphthovirus Lpro cleaves G3BP1 and G3BP2. Western blot analyses were performed with two different antibodies against G3BP1 and G3BP2. cells were infected at an MOI of 10 with the indicated chimeric EMCVs or ERAV. subsequent Western blot analyses were performed for G3BP1 and G3BP2. EMCV-EL, EMCV-F3C, and EMCV-E3C performed Western blot analyses for G3BP1 and G3BP2. a lysate of ERAV-infected cells was run on the same gel. a cleavage product migrating at 65 kDa was barely detected in ERAV-infected cells. in ERAV-infected cells, we detected a G3BP2 cleavage product running at 65 kDa. we observed a similar G3BP2 cleavage product, running at 65 kDa, upon infections with EMCV-FL and EMCV-EL. this suggests that Lpro has a major impact on the integrity of G3BP1 and G3BP2. infection with an EMCV encoding the catalytically inactive FMDV Lpro (EMCV-FL C51A) failed to cleave G3BP1 and G3BP2. we coexpressed N-terminally flag-tagged G3BP1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Lpro or 3Cpro. we observed multiple cleavage products migrating at 55 kDa upon overexpression of FMDV Lpro. these products were not observed upon infection with EMCV-EL or ERAV Lpro. the approximate cleavage sites in G3BP1 and G3BP2 are schematically represented in Fig. 7F. DV (39), with FMDV-A12 and performed immune fluorescence staining. SGs were visualized by anti-G3BP1 staining. viral replication was monitored by staining for capsid protein VP1. LFPK v6 cells were infected with FMDV-A12, treated with 500 M sodium arsenite for the last 30 min to induce SG formation. immunofluorescence staining was performed for the viral capsid protein VP1 (green) and the SG marker G3BP1 (red) chimeric EMCVs were encoding Lpro and 3Cpro of ERAV (EMCV-EL and EMCV-E3C, respectively) after recovering these chimeric EMCVs, we characterized viral replication kinetics by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of EMCV viral RNA (vRNA) levels at various time points. SGs were visualized using anti-G3BP1, anti-G3BP2, and anti-TIA-1 staining. EMCV infection suppressed SG formation, while EMCV-LZn lost this ability. similar observations were made at 8 hpi. the ability of Lpro to suppress SG formation is beneficial to the replication of EMCV-FL and EMCV-EL. EMCV-LZn generated an EMCV encoding a catalytically inactive FMDV Lpro (EMCV-FL C51A) SGs were visualized by immunofluorescence staining against G3BP1, eIF3 and G3BP2. LFPK v6 cells infected with wild-type FMDV or LLV visualized SG formation at 4 hpi. SGs were visualized by anti-G3BP1 staining. similar amounts of VP1 were observed in cells infected with wild-type FMDV. a one-tailed t test was used to determine statistical significance. we investigated whether aphthovirus proteases have an effect upstream of SG assembly, at the level of stress response signaling. we assessed the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 by using flow cytometry. p-PKR and p-eIF2 in dsRNA-positive (infected) cells are cleaved during aphthovirus infection. many viruses target SG scaffold proteins to antagonize SG formation. LFPK v6 cells were infected with wild-type FMDV-A12 or A12-LLV. western blot analyses were performed for SG proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, and TIA-1. cells were infected with ERAV at an MOI of 10 or treated with 5 g/ml actinomycin D. western blot analyses were performed for SG proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, and TIA-1. cleavages of G3BP1 and G3BP2, but not TIA-1, were observed. for ERAV, we observed a large cleavage product that migrated at 65 kDa and a 40-kDa doublet that ran at 40 kDa. however, we barely detected an 43-kDa cleavage product in ERAV-infected cells. cleavages in aphthovirus-infected cells were unaffected by EMCV infection. cleavages were not detected by antibodies that recognize different epitopes within G3BP1. EMCV suppresses SG formation via its leader protein (9, 26) Western blot analyses were performed with two different antibodies against G3BP1 and G3BP2. cells were lysed at 8 hpi (ECMVs) or 10 hpi (ERAV) subsequent Western blot analyses were performed for G3BP1 and G3BP2. a lysate of ERAV-infected cells was run on the same gel. a cleavage product migrating at 65 kDa was barely detected in ERAV-infected cells. a doublet cleavage product migrating at 40 kDa was observed in ERAV-infected cells. in ERAV-infected cells, we detected a G3BP2 cleavage product running at 65 kDa. we observed a similar G3BP2 cleavage product, running at 65 kDa. this suggests that Lpro has a major impact on the integrity of G3BP1 and G3BP2. a cleavage product, running at 65 kDa, was first observed at 6 hpi. infection with an EMCV encoding the catalytically inactive FMDV Lpro (EMCV-FL C51A) failed to cleave G3BP1 and G3BP2. cleavage patterns of G3BP1 resemble those observed in FMDV- and ERAV-infected cells. we did not observe the extra 45-kDa cleavage product that was apparent upon infection with EMCV-FL or EMCV-EL. these products were not observed upon overexpression of FMDV Lpro, similar to that in cells infected with EMCV-FL. the approximate cleavage sites in G3BP1 and G3BP2 are shown in Fig. 7F. aphthoviruses suppress SG formation through Lpro. this protease is well known for its ability to cleave translation initiation factor eIF4G. this protease is well known for its ability to shut off host translation. enterovirus 3Cpro does not cleave G3BP2 (25) enterovirus 3Cpro does not cleave G3BP2 (25) enterovirus 3Cpro does not cleave G3BP2 (25) the exact mechanisms used by aphthovirus Lpro and enterovirus 2Apro to suppress SG formation remains to be elucidated. some small SGs that contain TIA-1 and Sam68, but lack G3BP1, are formed in FMDV-infected cells (51, 52) there is conflicting literature about the composition of these atypical SGs. enterovirus infection induces PKR activation, leading to increase in p-PKR (p-PKR) and p-eIF2 levels (55, 56), but FMDV infection was shown to block the activation of this pathway (57) titers of FMDV LLV can be rescued in PKR knockout cells (58), hinting at a possible role for Lpro in suppressing PKR signaling. aphthoviruses actively suppress SG formation through the proteolytic activity of Lpro. aphthoviruses actively suppress SG formation through the proteolytic activity of Lpro. this results add aphthoviruses to a growing list of viruses that prevent SG assembly. proteins to sequester SG proteins, such as G3BP1, TIA-1, and TIAR, to prevent SG formation (13, 14), as well as alphaviruses, such as semliki forest virus (SFV), which prevents SG formation by sequestrating G3BP1 and G3BP2 by its nsP3 protein (15\u201317). the pM16.1-VFETQG-Zn infectious clone was omitted in the viruses used in this study. Upon total cytopathic effect (CPE), the viruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and stored at 80\u00b0C. the oligonucleotides encode flanking XhoI and NotI restriction sites that were used to ligate the PCR products into the desired plasmids. the plasmids encoding Flag-G3BP1 and Flag-G3BP2 have been described elsewhere (11). gated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were used for detection. dsRNA (J2; English & Scientific Consulting), p-PKR (E120; Abcam) and p-eIF2 (E90; Abcam) antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) secondary antibodies were used for Western blotting. \u00b0C with primary antibodies against FMDV VP1 (mouse monoclonal Ab 6HC4) and G3BP1 (ARP37713; Aviva Systems Biology) nuclei were visualized by DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining included in ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen) we analyzed the numbers of SGs and their surface areas in 100 cells per condition, the combined total of 10 to 20 images, using ImageJ software. for each image, the background signal was removed by creating a blurred duplicate and subtracting it from the original image. in the resulting image, the numbers and average surface areas of the SGs were quantified. cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and infected the next day (MOI, 10) with the viruses indicated in the figure legends. yde until analysis was performed using BD FACS Diva software.
