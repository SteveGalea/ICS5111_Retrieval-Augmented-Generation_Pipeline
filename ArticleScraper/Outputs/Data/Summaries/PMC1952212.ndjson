{"summary": "human poultry fair participants were enrolled at a larger county fair in Minnesota. both fairs were held within small cities with populations of 100,000. poultry judging often takes place in show areas that are open to the public. study participants were recruited for enrollment as they walked through the poultry exhibit area. a special sign and an information table were used to promote the study. participants were asked to complete a 1-page questionnaire that gathered demographic and poultry exposure data. a 2 2 2-foot wooden box was constructed from plywood. three black 1-foot 18-inch fluorescent lights (15 watts) and 1 white 1-foot 18-inch fluorescent light (15 watts) were mounted under the lid of this isolation box. digital photographs of the ventral and dorsal images of the hands were taken. 82 (87.2%) completed the enrollment questionnaire. 44 (46.8%) completed the end-of-study questionnaire. of all participants in county B, 29 (30.9%) were male. none of the participants in the age group of 7 to 12 years showed hand contamination. 4 participants (10.8%) in the 22- to 50-year age group had contaminated hands. 4 participants (10.8%) in the 22- to 50-year age group had contaminated hands. hand contamination with the fluorescent powder was considered a surrogate for pathogen transmission in this study. however, hand contamination of a pathogen does not necessarily lead to transmission. this depends on the amount of inoculated pathogen (dose), the ability of the pathogen to cause disease (virulence) and the ability of the host to defend against infection (17). zoos and agricultural fairs are common in the Midwest and attract thousands of people. concerns about viral and bacterial zoonotic disease transmission in these settings is growing."}
