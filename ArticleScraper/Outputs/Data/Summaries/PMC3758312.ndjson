{"summary": "fecal samples of many different bats were found to contain coronaviral genomic RNA [3]\u2013[9]. a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus, has recently been accepted. fecal samples of many different bats were found to contain coronaviral genomic RNA. ant bat coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) was able to infect primate or murine cells expressing the receptor for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). the receptor binding domain in the bat S protein was replaced by that of the S protein of SARS-CoV. other proteins that have been identified as receptors for coronaviruses are aminopeptidase N [22], [23] for the alphacoronaviruses transmis coronaviruses enter host cells by a fusion event that is also mediated by the S protein. a human airway trypsin-like protease has also been implicated in the entry of SARS-CoV into respiratory epithelial cells. in order to isolate infectious coronaviruses from bats it is necessary to use appropriate cells, i.e. cells that are susceptible to infection. to identify such cells we applied a pseudotype approach to analyze the ability of two different S proteins from SARSr-CoV to mediate infection. VSV pseudotypes containing SARS-CoV S protein are efficient in infecting vero E6 cells [50]\u2013[52]. none of the cell lines were susceptible to infection as indicated by the GFP expression. hACE2-expressing cells ranged from 5% (CpLu) to 50% (HypNi/1.1 and Tb 1 Lu) bat cells were tranfected either with control plasmid (pAPN) or with an expression plasmid for the porcine APN, the cellular receptor of TGEV (+pAPN). at 24 h post transfection, the cells were infected with TGEV. onaviruses is restricted at the entry stage, we wanted to know if such restrictions are also observed when the S proteins of the bat-derived SARSr-CoV are able to infect any of the bat cells. the S proteins of the bat-derived SARSr-CoV Bg08 and Rp3 were highly distinct from each other. infection efficiency was determined by measuring the luciferase activity 18 h p.i. VSV pseudotypes generated with VSV G (VSV G), MARV GP (MARV GP), or empty pCG1 vector alone (empty vector) served as positive and negative controls. infection was evaluated at 18 h p.i. by measuring the luciferase acticvity. analysis of the ability of human or chiropteran ACE2 to mediate infection of chiropteran cells. cells grown in white, opaque-walled 96well plates were transfected with expression plasmids for human (hACE2), Rhinolophus alcyone ACE2 (RhiLu/1.1_ACE2) or empty pCG1 vector alone (empty vector) before infection with VSV pseudotypes harboring either VSV G (VSV G), MARV GP (MARV GP), SARS-CoV S18 (SARS S18), SARSr control experiments with cells expressing ACE2 proteins did not reveal any syncytia formation. neither untreated nor trypsin-treated SARSr-CoV Bg08 S resulted in the formation of syncytia when co-expressed with either of the ACE2 proteins. screened for syncytia formation by fluorescence microscopy. all tests were performed in triplicates and repeated three times. screened for syncytia formation by fluorescence microscopy. the general resistance of bat cells to infection by coronaviruses is not observed when influenza and paramyxoviruses are analyzed. bat cells were grown on coverslips and subjected to infection by either BRSV(GFP) (BRSV), SeV(DsRed) (SeV), influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1 (H1N1), H7N7 (H7N7), and H9N2 (H9N2). VSV pseudotypes containing SARS-CoV S protein are efficient in infecting Vero E6 cells [50]\u2013[52]. none of the cell lines were susceptible to SARS-CoV S-mediated infection. hACE2-expressing cells ranged from 5% (CpLu) to 50%. bat cells were tranfected either with control plasmid (pAPN) or with an expression plasmid for the human ACE2. expression of hACE2 on the cell surface was detected by antibody staining. no replication-competent bat coronavirus is available up to now. we used the VSV pseudotype system to investigate whether the S proteins of the bat-derived SARSr-CoV Bg08 and Rp3 are able to infect bat cells. SV pseudotypes with either SARS-CoV S18 (SARS S18), SARSr-CoV Rp3 S18 (Rp3 S18) or SARSr-CoV Bg08 S18 (Bg08 S18) were applied to confluent bat cells. infection efficiency was determined by measuring the luciferase activity 18 h p.i. pCG1 vector alone (empty vector) were used to infect confluent bat cells. infection was evaluated at 18 h p.i. by measuring the luciferase acticvity. data shown are result of three independent experiments. cells grown in white, opaque-walled 96well plates were transfected with expression plasmids for human (hACE2), Rhinolophus alcyone ACE2 (RhiLu/1.1_ACE2) or empty pCG1 vector alone (empty vector) before infection with VSV pseudotypes harboring either VSV G (VSV G), MARV GP (MARV GP), SARS-CoV S18 (SARS S18), SARSr control experiments with cells expressing ACE2 proteins only did not reveal any syncytia formation. neither untreated nor trypsin-treated SARSr-CoV Bg08 S resulted in the formation of syncytia when co-expressed with either the ACE2 proteins. infection of bat cells by paramyxoviruses and influenza viruses. paramyxoviruses used in our study, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Sendai virus. the general resistance of bat cells to infection by coronaviruses is not observed when influenza and paramyxoviruses are analyzed. the resistance of the bat cells to infection by pseudotypes was overcome after the cells had been treated to express the receptor for SARS-CoV. the lack of infection in the case of the bat CoV S protein may be related to an inefficient particle production or a functional impairment of the S protein due to the deletion of the carboxyterminal amino acids of the cytoplamic tail. this deletion was found to be favourable for the function of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and TGEV in VSV and lentiviral pseudotype systems. we do not know what is the effect of such a deletion in the case of the S proteins of bat it is not known which step in the replication cycle is responsible for the host-restriction. if virus entry is the limiting step, the S proteins interact only with receptors from cells of the same species but not of the same genus. five of the cell lines used in this study were immortalized by SV40 large T antigen. CpLu cells were spontaneously immortalized. in the future, it may by worthwhile, to include primary cells in the analysis. recent data suggest that bats may serve as a natural reservoir. transmission of filoviruses, paramyxoviruses and influenza viruses from bats to new hosts appears less restricted at the level of cellular receptors than is transmission of coronaviruses. all bat cell lines were supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAA) all cells were cultivated in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, and passaged 14 (CpLu, Tb 1 Lu) or 110 when they had reached 90% confluency. oNi/22.1, and RhiLu/1.1 cell lines were generated from bats caught in Ghana. samples were exported under a state contract between the Republic of Ghana and the Federal Republic of Germany. the three influenza viruses used in this study comprise one porcine strain of the subtype H1N1 (A/swine/Potsdam/15/81) and two avian strains of the subtypes H7N7 (A/duck/Potsdam/15/81) and H9N2 (A/chicken/Saudi Arabia/CP7/98) ase N was obtained by reverse-transcription (RT-) PCR of mRNA from ST cells. the PCR product was cloned into the pCG1 vector using BamHI and SalI restriction sites. the sequence will be submitted to GenBank. sRed-linked constructs of full-lenght SARS-CoV S (Frankfurt-1 isolate, AY291315.1, pCG1-SARS-CoV S-DsRed) and SARSr-CoV Bg08 S (pCG1-SARSr-CoV S-DsRed) were generated for the cell-based fusion assay. the respective CoV S was carboxyterminally fused to a non-flexible the success of the cloning was determined by gel electrophoresis. a band of the calculated size of ACE2 was obtained. to exclude mutations generated during the cloning process, at least 4 different clones were sequenced. BHK-21 cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes. as soon as they had reached 75% confluency they were transfected with 10 g of pCG1-SARS-CoV S18, pCG1-SARSr-CoV Rp3 S18, pCG1-MARV GP, pcDNA3.1-VSV G (positive control), or pCG1 (negative control) at 16 h post transfection the supernatant was removed cells were grown to 50% confluency and transfection with either pCG1-hACE, pCG1-RhiLu/1.1_ACE2, pCG1-pAPN, or empty pCG1 vector (negative control) cells grown in 96well plates were transfected with 0.3 g, while cells grown on coverslips where transfected with 1 g of the respective expression plasmid. the cells were washed three times with PBS before they were fixed by incubation with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. after fixation, the cells were washed three times with PBS. residual paraformaldehyde was quenched by incubation with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 30 min at RT. VSVpp infected cells were fixed 18 h p.i. and representative fluorescence microscopical pictures were taken. the cell culture supernatant was removed at 18 h p.i. by aspiration and the cells were lysed by incubation with luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) for 30 min at RT on an orbital shaker. emitted light signal was measured after 1 min of incubation using the screening for the formation of syncytia was performed using the Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope (Nikon) all cells were cultivated in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. EpoNi/22.1, HypNi/1.1, and RhiLu/1.1 cell lines were generated from mechanically and enzymatically separated organ samples. samples were exported under a state contract between the Republic of Ghana and the Federal Republic of Germany. the corresponding cell line is derived from postmortem tissue of bats sacrificed for other purposes. recombinant VSV codes for an EGFP in an additional ORF between the VSV G and VSV L genes. recombinant bovine respiratory syncytial virus that codes for an EGFP, BRSV(GFP) has been described recently [71]. the ACE2 coding sequence of the cellular receptor of TGEV, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was obtained by reverse-transcription (RT-) PCR of mRNA from ST cells followed by primer-specific PCR. the PCR product was cloned into the pCG1 vector using BamHI and SalI restriction sites. the pCG1-SARSr-CoV Bg08 S18 was generated based on SARSr-CoV RNA detected in fecal samples of a horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus blasii, BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from Bulgaria. the pCG1-SARSr-CoV Bg08 S18 was generated for the cell-based fusion assay. the success of the cloning was determined by gel electrophoresis. the DNA fragment was cloned into the pCG1 vector using the BamHI and SalI restriction sites. at least 4 different clones were sequenced. anti-goat antibodies were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. all antibodies were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cell lines were seeded in 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, luciferase assay) and grown to 75% confluency before they were subjected to infection. cells were grown to 50% confluency and transfection with either pCG1-hACE, pCG1-RhiLu/1.1_ACE2, pCG1-pAPN, or empty pCG1 vector (negative control) was performed 24 h prior to infection. DMEM containing 2% FCS was applied to reduce spread of replication-competent viruses. cells were washed three times with PBS before they were fixed by incubation with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. fluorencence microscopy was performed using the Nikon Eclipse Ti and the NIS Elements AR software (Nikon) the cell culture supernatant was removed at 18 h p.i. by aspiration and the cells were lysed by incubation with luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) for 30 min on an orbital shaker. the cells were washed 3 times with serum-free medium. were either incubated with fusion medium (DMEM +2 g/ml acetylated trypsin, Sigma Aldrich) or non-fusion medium (DMEM) for 4 h. the cells were fixed, permeabilized (as described before) and ACE2 expression was confirmed by antibody staining."}
