{"summary": "DHCW are at a high risk of cross-infection through occupational exposure. the eyes are at particular risk from floating particles, which are considered serious hazards for DHCW. the majority of infections are subclinical and almost 80% of all HBV infections are undiagnosed. the majority of infections are subclinical and almost 80% of all HBV infections are undiagnosed. in 1996, the CDC adopted the term \u201cstandard precautions\u201d to generate awareness of prevention and transmission of infection. in 2016 the CDC published \u201cSummary of Infection Prevention Practices in Dental Settings: Basic Expectations for Safe Care\u201d [22], [23], [24], [25]. the questionnaire included 32 items assessing infection control practices among undergraduate dental students and interns at Riyadh Elm University. out of 400 questionnaires sent, 309 forms were filled out and returned. forty-two of the respondents were interns (21 female and 21 male) the infection control practices followed by dental students and interns during treatment and between patients are shown in Table 4 (Tab. 4) Discussion Infection control is a dynamic and ever-changing discipline. standard isolation precautions are designed to reduce the risk of acquiring occupational infections from both known and unknown sources in healthcare settings. dental students, interns and dentists in saudi arabia lacked compliance with HBV vaccination. compliance was greater than those of other studies. importance of protective eyewear was found to be in the interest of dentist and patient. the results of this study indicated increased awareness among concerned dental students and interns at Riyadh Elm university. more emphasis on compliance with HBV vaccination and protective eyewear is needed."}
