{"summary": "Cloacal swabs (n = 381) were sampled from live chickens, ducks, pigeons, and house sparrows. an average of 4 markets (range 1\u20136) were visited each month. samples were from backyard animals or local meat birds. a total of 5 samples with influenza virus (H5N1) were isolated from 1 healthy chicken and 4 visceral organs from 1 live bird market. in December 2006, a total of 5 samples with influenza virus (H5N1) were isolated from 5 visceral organs (quail, water cock) from 1 food market. nucleotide sequences were aligned with those of influenza subtype H5N1 viruses in Thailand, people\u2019s Republic of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Lao, Myanmar, and Cambodia. nucleotide sequences were aligned with those of influenza subtype H5N1 viruses. bird meats were the source of 9 virus-containing samples (5 quail, 2 moor hens, and 2 water cocks), which indicates a risk for influenza virus (H5N1) contamination in bird meats, especially quail. 3 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were isolated from healthy live poultry (1 chicken and 2 ducks) trees were rooted to A/goose/China/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) the viruses had characteristics of highly pathogenic avian influenza. the HA cleavage site consists of multiple basic amino acids RERRRKKR (in 1 isolate, CU-329, REKRRKKR) the virus sequences contain 7 glycosylation sites. live bird and wet markets play a major role in facilitating emergence or reemergence of influenza and some other respiratory diseases (10\u201312) monitoring of live bird and food markets as an early warning system should be implemented in Asian countries where such markets are still commonplace."}
