{"summary": "the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is thought to have originated in bats. but the sources of most endemic human coronaviruses, which cause mild respiratory disease, remain unknown. natural and synthetic ribozymes have been used to synthesize RNA in vitro. but their activity is limited to certain RNA sequences. authors selected randomized variants of the polymerase based on their ability to synthesize aptamers from a complementary RNA template. the authors increase this finding to account for the higher carbon-to-phosphorous ratios of early bryophytes. the carbonate carbon isotope record increased by approximately 2% around 445 million years ago and a corresponding rise in oxygen to modern levels by 420 to 400 million years ago. the authors examined 17 well-preserved hearths spanning three occupations between 13,200 to 11,500 years ago. they entered the results in a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the relative contributions of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial sources. the study demonstrates that hearth residues can record the dietary trends and practices of mobile hunter-gatherers. the B-cell developmental defects were related to defects in internalization of certain growth factor and chemokine receptors. the phenotype was likely due to increased receptor signaling caused by impaired endocytosis."}
