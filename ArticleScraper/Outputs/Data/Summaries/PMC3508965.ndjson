{"summary": "immunochromatographic strip was developed for the detection of PHE-CoV. the strip was capable of specifically detecting PHE-CoV with a HA unit of 2 within 10 min. the immunochromatographic strip was capable of specifically detecting PHE-CoV. the disease is caused by PHE coronavirus (PHE-CoV), which comprises a single strain. it is the only known neurotropic CoV affecting pigs. in 1969, an antigenically identical virus was isolated in. England from suckling pigs presenting with anorexia, depression, and vomiting, but without clear signs of encephalomyelitis. hemagglutination/hemagglutination inhibition (HA/HI) tests [13], immunohistochemistry assays [10], and molecular tools such as nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) these detection methods are laborious, time-consuming, and require laboratory procedures or special equipment. current detection strategies are also insufficient to meet emergent management after PHE outbreaks the animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions. the field samples were provided by the Jilin Center for Disease Control and Prevention to perform general surveillance on the PHE-CoV infection. hybridomas were generated through the selection of HAT (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) medium and screened using a recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and HI assays. the positive hybridoma cells were cloned by a limiting dilution to obtain four strains of secretory positive antibody hybridoma cells. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added into each well at a working concentration of 1:4000. the plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C and the plates were washed 3 times with PBST. the pH of the colloidal gold was adjusted to 8.4 with 1% potassium carbonate (wt/vol), followed by sub-installing 11 tubes with 1 ml colloidal gold solution each, to which were added 5 g, 10 g, 15 g, 20 g, 25 g, 30 g, 35 g, 40 g, or 45 g MAb 4D4. the conjugate pad was dispensed at the test or the control line on the NC membrane, at a rate of 0.8 l/cm and a speed of 4 cm/s using XYZ-3000. the membrane was dried under vacuum and stored at 4\u00b0C. a sample pad completed the assembly with 1.0- to 1.5-mm overlap sequentially by mounting on the conjugate plastic card. the immunochromatographic strip is illustrated in Figure 2. Interpretation of the results of the immunochromatographic strip. A, positive (two red bands in the readout zone); B, negative (only one red band in the control line area). Specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip To evaluate the specificity of the immunochromatographic strips, the same batch and five different batches of the immunochromatographic strip were used to detect PHE-CoV. the supernatant was collected for testing by ELISA, the immunochromatographic strips, RT-PCR. a total of 468 nasal cavity or throat swabs were collected from 12 herds in the Changchun, Jilin, Songyuan, Siping, Baishan, and Liaoyuan districts. mice were immunized subcutaneously with 0.2 ml (28 units of HA) of PHE-CoV virus purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and emulsified 1:1 with Freund's complete adjuvant. the mice were boosted three times with the same amount of antigen in 50% Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) every 2 weeks. nude mice and the mouse abdominal dropsy were purified by sequential precipitation with caprylic acid [21] and ammonium sulfate. they were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C. ELISA assay was based on the MAb of anti-PHE-CoV for the detection of PHE-CoV. ase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added into each well at a working concentration of 1:4000. one hundred microliters of substrate solution o-phenylenediamine (OPD containing H2O2) was added to each well. the color reaction was developed in the dark for 10 minutes at room temperature. the MAb 4D4 antibody (37.7 l, 9.08 mg/ml) was added dropwise into 10 ml of colloidal gold solution on a magnetic stirring apparatus for 30 min. then 1 ml 10% (wt/vol) BSA was added to block excess reactivity of the gold colloid. the mixture was then stirred on the magnetic stirring apparatus for an additional 30 min. the sample pad, pretreated conjugate pad, NC membrane, and absorbent pads were assembled into a test strip plate. the strip plate was cut into 4-mm-wide pieces using an LN-5000 cutting machine. the strips were stored in dry conditions at 4\u00b0C until required. a total of 178 brain tissue samples were collected from deceased piglets with suspected PHE-CoV infection. a 500 mg of brain tissue was measured and homogenized, then suspended 1:10 with PBS, followed by centrifuging at 7000 g for 10 min. the detection assay of PHE-CoV was established as previously described. statistical values of >0.75, 0.40 to 0.75, and 0.40 represented excellent agreement, good to fair agreement, and poor agreement respectively. a total of 468 nasal cavity or throat swabs were collected from approximately 1- to 3-week-old piglets. a total of 468 piglets were collected from approximately 1- to 3-week-old piglets. an OD490>0.263 indicated a positive result and 0.263 a negative result. also, PHE-CoV was diluted to 500 ng/ml, 250 ng/ml, 120 ng/ml, 60 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml, 15 ng/ml, 7.5 ng/ml, 3.75 ng/ml, and 1.875 ng/ml with PBS, which was detected by ELISA the colloidal gold solution was made with different concentration of MAb 4D4. the color of the tubes without sufficient protein changed from red to blue. when the amount of protein added to the tube exceeded the minimum needed, the color remained unchanged. the sensitivity of the gold immunochromatographic test was determined to be 2 units of HA antigens. to determine the specificity of the immunochromatographic strip, PHE-CoV(A) was simultaneously tested with TGEV(B), PEDV(C), HCV(D), PRV(E), BCV(F), MHV(G) and HCV-OC43(H) 178 clinical samples from deceased piglets were detected by sandwich ELISA, RT-PCR, and the immunochromatographic strip. of the 178 clinical samples, 88 were positive and 90 were negative using the immunochromatographic strip, while 90 were positive and 88 were negative using ELISA and RT-PCR. 207 out of 468 swab samples were positive for PHE-CoV infection. positive rate ranged from 61.54% in the Jilin district to 17.95% in the Songyuan district. wabs No positive samples Percent Positive Baishan 78 29 37.18 Changchun 78 37 47.44 Jilin 78 48 61.54 Liaoyuan 78 32 41.03 Siping 78 47 60.26

with PBS detected by ELISA. the standard curve was drawn by CurveExpert software with PHE-CoV concentration on the X-axis and the average OD490 value on the Y-axis. the linear regression constant R2 was 0.9987, and the linear detection range was 3.75-500 ng/ml. colloidal gold particles were uniformly distributed, with a mean diameter of about 30 nm. the colloidal gold particles had a visible clear space around the halo. the colloidal gold particles had a visible clear space around the halo. sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip was diluted to 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128, 1:256, and 1:512 with 10 mmol/l borate buffer solution (pH 8.0) were tested using the immunochromatographic strips. the results showed little variability within the same batch or in different batches. 178 clinical samples from deceased piglets were detected by sandwich ELISA, RT-PCR, and the immunochromatographic strip. of the 178 clinical samples, 88 were positive and 90 were negative using the immunochromatographic strip. the specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip, as compared with ELISA and RT-PCR, were 100% and 97.78%. 207 out of 468 swab samples were positive for PHE-CoV infection. positive rate ranged from 61.54% in the Jilin district to 17.95% in the Songyuan district. the immunochromatographic strip can be used for the detection and differentiation of PHE-CoV in clinical diagnosis. nucleotide sequence analysis of the region covering the S2 probe revealed 92.6% nucleotide sequence homology to BCV and 91.9% homology to HCV-OC43 [27]. despite the fact that PHE-CoV causes two distinct clinical syndromes in pigs, only one serotype of the virus is known to exist. if too many antibodies are added, it is easy for the colloidal particles to aggregate and precipitate, especially during purification by ultracentrifugation. the quality of the MAbs used in the strip test is crucial for the specificity and sensitivity of the strip. the membrane ensures antibody absorption and the leaching and binding of gold-labeled proteins. the membrane ensures the antibody absorption and the leaching and binding of gold-labeled proteins. the test results can be sensitive and easy to read. a total of 468 nasal cavity or throat swabs were collected from approximately 1- to 3-week-old piglets. the positive rate ranged from 61.54% in the Jilin district to 17.95% in the Songyuan district. the serum antibody positive rate was only 6.5% in the previous study. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
