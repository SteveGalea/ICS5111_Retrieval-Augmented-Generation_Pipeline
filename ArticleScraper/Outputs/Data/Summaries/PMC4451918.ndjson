{"summary": "the study vero E6 cells were infected with 100 focus-forming units of EBOV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. after a 1-h incubation, the inoculum was removed and replaced with media containing chloroquine. the supernatant was collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 after infection and media replaced with fresh drug. six-week-old BALB/c mice or Syrian hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with 100 50% lethal dose of MA EBOV. treatment groups (mice and hamsters) received 90 mg/kg of chloroquine alone (intraperitoneally) OV\u2013infected/chloroquine-treated mice, and MA EBOV\u2013infected/vehicle-treated mice, respectively, treatment had no significant effect on survival. survival of MA EBOV-inoculated mice (A) and hamsters (B) treated with CQ (90 mg/kg) was not well tolerated by the animals in this study. this finding suggests that hamsters tolerate this dose of chloroquine. however, treatment had no effect on survival; no combination-treated or vehicle-treated groups survived. median survival times were comparable in mouse and hamster models. current preclinical data do not support the continued consideration of chloroquine for use against EBOV infections in humans."}
