{"summary": "ICTV reports four coronavirus genera, including Alphacoronaviruses, Betacoronaviruses, Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses. a large, capped and polyadenylated genome contains seven common coronavirus genes in the following conserved order. ORF1a/b encompasses two-thirds of the genome and produces a genome-length mRNA (mRNA1) that encodes two overlapping viral topology of CoV N and RNA Binding Amino acid sequence comparisons have shown that CoV N proteins have three distinct and highly conserved domains. two structural and independently folded structural regions are separated by a intrinsically disordered central region (RNA-binding domain/domain 2). all three domains have been shown in different CoVs to bind with viral RNA. structures such as a central -sheet platform flanked by -helices [20], with a basic RNA binding groove along the -platform and an extended -hairpin. the flexible, positively charged finger-like extension in the NTD of both IBV and SARS-CoV N protein is able to grasp RNA by neutralizing its phosphate groups. spliceosomal protein [24] and coat protein of MS2 bacteriophage [25] bind viral RNA with residues arising from the surface of a four-stranded anti-parallel sheet. strands 2, 3, and the flexible -hairpin from the IBV N protein could fulfill a comparable role by interacting with phosphate groups on the viral RNA. three residues on the -platform have been shown to play key roles in TRS binding and helix destabilization. these residues are completely invariant in betacoronavirus N proteins. the ability of the NTD to melt dsRNA may also play a role in RNA packaging or other steps in the viral life cycle where RNA remodeling is needed. viral nucleocapsid and replication accessory proteins from other viruses have also been shown to function as RNA chaperones and facilitate helix destabilization. potential phosphorylation sites have been mapped to the Ser/Arg-rich portion of the LKR of SARS-CoV N. nsp3 binding induces a conformational change in the LKR, potentially regulating the intracellular localization of N to the site of replication. nsp3 binding induces a conformational change in the LKR, potentially regulating the intracellular localization of N to the site of replication [50], and/or other RNA binding functions of N. monomer of cSARS-N, a crystalized C-terminal construct of SARS-N, comprises five short -helices, one 310 helix, and two -strands. the general shape of the monomer resembles the letter C, with one edge formed by a -hairpin extending away from the rest of the molecule [47] the two -hairpins form a four-stranded intermolecular -sheet that is stabilized through extensive hydrogen bonding. the other part of the dimerization interface is composed of helices 5 and 6, where strong hydrophobic interactions involving Trp302, Ile305, Pro310, Phe315 and Phe316 were observed. a nuclear magnetic resonance study has reported secondary structural assignments of a SARS N protein construct. positively charged lysine and arginine residues, amino acids 248\u2013280 form a positively charged groove, one of the most positively charged regions of the N protein [55], except that the positively charged surface area is larger in the SARS-CoV construct. the NP248\u2013365 construct contains both the charge-rich region (residues 248\u2013280) and dimerization core (residues 281\u2013365) of the dimerization domain. two dimers arrange themselves into a butterfly-shaped tetramer, while two butterfly-shaped tetramers unite to form an octamer. the octamer is held together through hydrophobic interactions and hydrophilic contacts among the four dimers. networks of inter-dimer hydrogen bonds further help stabilize the octamer [55] the C-terminal tail interferes with oligomerization of the CTD and has an inhibitory effect on viral titer of HCoV-229E. further understanding this mechanism of oligomerization may provide insight into the viral assembly process and could identify additional targets for drugs to combat CoVs. cSARS-CoV, IBV and MHV have all been shown to perform both functions. coV N proteins can localize to the cytoplasm alone or to the cytoplasm and nucleolus. nucleolar localization usually requires regions in the protein that are rich in Arg residues and is likely cell-cycle dependent [34,69,70] the localization of IBV-N to the nucleolus forms part of a virus strategy to control sgRNA synthesis in both the host cell and virus. IBV-N localizes in the nucleus, but when fused with domain 3 (CTD) it localizes to the cytoplasm and thus supports the findings of other studies done on IBV-N localization. there is at least one noRS in domain 2 and eight putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs within the SARS-CoV N protein [35], of which the short lysine-rich sequence (366\u2013381) near the carboxy-terminus is a the nucleocapsid protects the genome and ensures its timely replication and reliable transmission. the filamentous nucleocapsids are 10 to 15 nm in diameter and several 100 nm in length. the filamentous nucleocapsids are 10 to 15 nm in diameter and several 100 nm in length, and these macromolecular structures are visible using electron microscopy. association of CoV N with the ER-Golgi complex plays a role in virus budding. presence of N results in increased yields of VLPs and complete virion formation. translation of N protein is implicated in stimulation of gRNA infection during RNA synthesis. the internal core consists of N protein, RNA and the CTD of M protein. the M protein is the main core shell component and a 16 amino acid domain (aa 237\u2013252) on the CTD of M protein binds directly to N protein via an ionic interaction, leading to specific genome encapsidation in the budding viral particle [81,82,83]. the nucleocapsid consists of the positive strand genomic RNA, mRNA 1, helically encapsidated by N protein monomers. the N protein region that interacts with the C-terminus of the M protein domain seems to be CoV specific. the intracellular sites of virus assembly also vary among different viruses. MHV M protein was the first example of a viral transmembrane protein that could bind to a specific viral RNA element in the absence of any other viral structural proteins. a proposed model for RNA packaging in MHV suggests that a viral transmembrane protein could bind to a specific viral RNA element in the absence of any other viral structural proteins. this segment corresponds to residues 201\u2013224 of the MHV M protein [83], which overlap with only one of the critical residues identified in the MHV M protein [61]. this region of the two M proteins is poorly conserved and the apparent disagreement between the TGEV and MHV results may relate to differences in the respective folds of the M proteins. MHV [104], IBV [105], TGEV [106], and BCoV [107] all used vaccinia-based expression systems. overexpression of viral membrane proteins may lead to release in microvesicles. this complicates the interpretation of virus-like particle experiments. a more clearly defined role for N protein in gRNA synthesis was delineated when an interaction between the SR region of the MHV N protein and a region in the amino terminal segment of the nsp3 subunit of the viral replicase was discovered [51,126]. a more clearly defined role for N protein in gRNA synthesis was delineated when an interaction between the SR region of the MHV N protein and a region in the amino terminal segment of the ns the TGEV N protein has chaperone activity [31], and that this region facilitates template switching in vitro by decreasing the energy barrier needed to dissociate the nascent minus RNA chain from the gRNA template. this facilitates template switching in vitro by decreasing the energy barrier needed to dissociate the nascent minus RNA chain from the gRNA template. inhibition of kinases means Rb remains hypophosphorylated and cannot release E2F1. inhibition of kinases means that Rb remains hypophosphorylated. inhibition of kinases means that Rb remains hypophosphorylated and cannot release E2F1. eukaryotic cells reprogram their mRNA metabolism to adapt to stress-induced damage. coVs induce host translational shutoff while maintaining synthesis of their own gene products. MHV-induces a host translational shutoff that is reminiscent of a cellular stress response. binding of the capsid to PARB late in the virus cycle could prevent recruitment of ribosomes to the nascent 40S RNA. this scenario would favour packaging of the 40S genomic RNA into nucleocapsids. N-protein mediated inhibition of cytokinesis leads to inhibition of cell proliferation in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) [75] SARS-CoV N may decelerate lymphocyte proliferation and therefore interfere with immune system function. signal transduction CoV infection is likely to activate a diversity of host cell signal transduction pathways and kinases. phosphorylation of N protein would therefore only occur at a relatively late stage of the viral cell cycle. hCoV-OC43 N protein can bind to DNA in vitro [55] coV N protein induces apoptosis of COS-1 monkey kidney cells in absence of growth factor by down-regulating extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and up-regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. the primary role of coV N protein is to package the genome into long, flexible, helical ribonu Virus Life Cycle Function 1.1 Viral Core Formation Primary role of CoV N is packaging the viral genome into long, flexible, helical RNP complexes. interaction between the viral structural proteins (N, E, S and M) as well as a host membrane envelope obtained from the site of budding is critical for viral assembly. a structural model of CoV proposes that N protein is present in the helical nucleocapsid but also in the internal spherical/icosahedral core. the internal core consists of N protein, RNA and the CTD of M protein. the internal core consists of N protein, RNA and the CTD of M protein. coVs acquire their lipid envelope by budding of the nucleocapsid through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membranes [87,88] it is believed that the interaction of the nucleocapsid with envelope proteins drives the incorporation of the nucleocapsid in enveloped viruses. such interactions are critical for viral assembly, as has been shown for alphaviruses. s is 21kb from the 5' end of MHV mRNA 1 [97,98], is necessary and sufficient for packaging RNA into MHV particles [99] it has been suggested that the M protein-ps interaction could lead to the association of M protein with N protein, thereby stabilizing the complex between M protein and the nucleocapsid. this is unlikely because N protein interacts with all mRNAs [79,93], which makes it difficult to explain how the formation of interaction between the carboxy terminus of M and nucleocapsid has been mapped to residues 233\u2013257 of the TGEV M protein [82] this segment corresponds to residues 201\u2013224 of the MHV M protein [83], which overlap with only one of the critical residues identified in the MHV M protein [61]. this region of the two M proteins is poorly conserved and the apparent disagreement between the TGEV and MHV results may relate to differences in the respective coVs assemble and bud intracellularly at the ER-Golgi complex. association of the nucleocapsid with this organelle may reflect a role in virus budding. formation requires expression of only M- and E-protein, and not N protein. the role of N protein in gRNA synthesis is implied by at least two things. MHV- and SARS-CoV N protein colocalize intracellularly with replicase components at early stages of infection. stimulation of gRNA infection is dependent upon N protein translation. the nucleocapsid protects the genome and ensures its timely replication and reliable transmission. the filamentous nucleocapsids are 10 to 15 nm in diameter and several 100 nm in length. the basic building block for CoV nucleocapsid formation is a dimeric assembly of N protein [21], and it is the CTD of N protein that possesses dimerization function [56]. association of CoV N with the ER-Golgi complex plays a role in virus budding. presence of N results in increased yields of VLPs and complete virion formation. translation of N protein is implicated in stimulation of gRNA infection during RNA synthesis. a structural model of CoV proposes that N protein is present in the helical nucleocapsid. the internal core consists of N protein, RNA and the CTD of M protein. the M protein is the main core shell component and a 16 amino acid domain (aa 237\u2013252) on the CTD of M protein binds directly to N protein via an ionic interaction. the nucleocapsid consists of the positive strand genomic RNA, mRNA 1, helically encapsidated by N protein monomers. the N protein region that interacts with the C-terminus of the M protein domain seems to be CoV specific. the intracellular sites of virus assembly also vary among different viruses. MHV M protein was the first example of a viral transmembrane protein that could bind to a specific viral RNA element in the absence of any other viral structural proteins. a proposed model for RNA packaging in MHV suggests that a viral transmembrane protein could bind to a specific viral RNA element in the absence of any other viral structural proteins. this segment corresponds to residues 201\u2013224 of the MHV M protein [83], which overlap with only one of the critical residues identified in the MHV M protein [61]. this region of the two M proteins is poorly conserved and the apparent disagreement between the TGEV and MHV results may relate to differences in the respective folds of the M proteins. MHV [104], IBV [105], TGEV [106], and BCoV [107] all used vaccinia-based expression systems. overexpression of viral membrane proteins may lead to release in microvesicles. this complicates the interpretation of virus-like particle experiments. a more clearly defined role for N protein in gRNA synthesis was delineated when an interaction between the SR region of the MHV N protein and a region in the amino terminal segment of the nsp3 subunit of the viral replicase was discovered [51,126]. a more clearly defined role for N protein in gRNA synthesis was delineated when an interaction between the SR region of the MHV N protein and a region in the amino terminal segment of the ns this region facilitates template switching in vitro by decreasing the energy barrier needed to dissociate the nascent minus RNA chain from the gRNA template during discontinuous RNA transcription. one of the MHV nonstructural proteins induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) inhibition of kinases means that Rb remains hypophosphorylated and cannot release E2F1. inhibition of kinases means that Rb remains hypophosphorylated. inhibition of kinases means that Rb remains hypophosphorylated. eukaryotic cells reprogram mRNA metabolism to adapt to stress-induced damage. coVs induce host translational shutoff while maintaining synthesis of their own gene products. MHV-induces a host translational shutoff that is reminiscent of a cellular stress response. binding of the capsid to PARB late in the virus cycle could prevent recruitment of ribosomes to the nascent 40S RNA. this scenario would favour packaging of the 40S genomic RNA into nucleocapsids. EF1, but with significantly lower affinity than SARS-CoV N, induces multinucleation much more slowly in a substantially smaller fraction of transfected cells. N-protein mediated inhibition of cytokinesis leads to inhibition of cell proliferation in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. signal transduction CoV infection is likely to activate a diversity of host cell signal transduction pathways and kinases. phosphorylation of N protein would therefore only occur at a relatively late stage of the viral cell cycle. hCoV-OC43 N protein can bind to DNA in vitro [55] apoptosis of COS-1 monkey kidney cells by down-regulating extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and up-regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. activation of p38 MAPK also causing actin reorganization in serum-deprived cells. expressed cytoplasmic p28 induces stabilization of p53, and accumulation of p53 causes transcriptional upregulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, leading to suppression of cyclin E/CDK 2 activities. resulting reduction in G1 cyclin-CDK complexes and CDK activities ultimately inhibits Rb hyperphosphorylation. the ability of N protein to inhibit CDK4 activity was dependent on the RXL motif, whereas its ability to inhibit CDK2 requires at least two mechanisms. p28-mediated (MHV) and N protein-mediated (SARS) blocking of the S phase allows these virus enough time to utilize the cellular raw materials that have been synthesized ahead of the S phase, for replication of its genome. N protein translocates to cytoplasmic SGs where it colocalizes with poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PARB) and transiently expressed TIA-1 [38], both of which are components of SGs. the nucleocapsid protein of both porcine and respiratory syndrome and rubella virus also interact with PARB, which promotes protein synthesis by circularizing mRNAs. EF1 is a multifunctional protein and has unconventional functions related to its association with the cytoskeleton. N-EF1 blocks EF1\u2013mediated F actin bundling and formation of the contractile ring. multinucleated syncytia have been observed in late-phase SARS-CoV. anti-N monoclonal antibodies protect mice from lethal infection of JMHV. hCoV-OC43 N protein can bind to DNA in vitro. hCoV-OC43 N protein can bind to DNA in vitro. nucleocapsid to bind microRNA miR-9, a negative regulator of NF-kB. NF-kB is also involved in SARS-CoV mediated activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), specifically, N protein binds to NF-kB and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein binding sites on the COX-2 gene promoter. the production of interferon [158], up-regulate the production of COX2 [162], up-regulate the activity of AP1 [163], and induce apoptosis in serum deprived cells [155]. an important piece of missing information lies in the difficulty in resolving the atomic structure of the RNP complex. a study using high-throughput mass spectrometry identified a list of cellular proteins that could potentially interact with the IBV N protein [177,178] understanding the role of N in coronavirus infection could lead to the development of novel therapeutics that could be used to combat the threat posed by the emerging lethal human. viruses identified in recent times."}
