{"summary": "we used spatial and nonspatial data in this study. data on SARS incidence were derived from case-contact interviews that are text based. associated residential address data were first cleaned, checked for completeness and accuracy. a total of 1,709 confirmed cases (out of 1,755 total cases) were extracted for the analysis. forty-six cases (i.e., 2.6% of the total) could not be pinpointed at an exact location because of inconsistencies in the address entries. three different patterns are possible: clustered (0 R 0.8), distributed randomly (0.8 R 1.8) or with uniform spacing (1.8 R 2.149). a contagious process will give rise to a clustered pattern with near-zero R values. a 5-day incubation period was used to restructure the data for a time-series study. central and western 261,884 144,824 29 99.9 Eastern 616,199 314,674 27 99.7 Islands 86,667 43,201 1 97.8 Kowloon City 381,352 185,553 82 99.9 Kwai Tsing 477,092 218,291 44 99.9 Kwun Tong 562,427 226,062 76 99.9 North 298,657 133,767 12 99.1 d Marine data were not land based and therefore excluded from the study. we created 12 kernel maps adjusted for population at risk to characterize changes in disease hot spots on 12 prototypical days over 16 weeks. each of the 15 classes was assigned a shade in proportion to the magnitudes. three disease clusters each with > 30 observations were extracted. these data were used to derive origin-and-destination plots or flow diagrams. lines were drawn to connect an origin location where the flow started (e.g., index source of infection) with related destinations where the flow ended. a total of 1,709 confirmed cases (out of 1,755 total cases) were extracted for the analysis. the criteria for inclusion in the SARSID were radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, fever 38\u00b0C. the spread of a disease in a community is revealed through the plotting of disease occurrences at residential addresses of the patients enabled with the address matching function in a GIS. the sheer number and spread of points could have impeded effective reading of the event. a kernel size of 300 300 m2 was used to reconstruct the territory of Hong Kong into a gridded surface of 208 columns and 151 rows. each grid was designated either urban or suburban based upon land use classification. each urban or suburban grid was considered a homogeneous unit. the infection rates were collapsed into 15 classes to reduce complexity of map representation. each of the 15 classes was assigned a shade in proportion to the magnitudes. each of the 15 classes was assigned a shade in proportion to the magnitudes. Moran\u2019s I coefficient ranges between 1 and 1 and is interpreted as regionalized or juxtaposition of similar values (0.6 I 1 indicating positive spatial autocorrelation), lack of autocorrelation, or the actual arrangement of values as one that we would expect from a random distribution. the OD plots are an established methodology employed by transport professionals and human geographers to examine the extent of spatial interaction and human settlement. flow data themselves can be people, goods, telecommunications, and so on. the lines help to delimit the spatial coverage revealing the extent or degree of spread. each kernel map shows the density of SARS patients adjusted for underlying population density on a prototypical day over 16 weeks. a few disease hot spots were shown to be developing in the Kowloon peninsula and southeast New Territories. n, number of SARS patients; NA, not computed because of insufficient sample size (n 25). an animated series is available online (Lai and Chan 2004). daily histograms of SARS by classes on infection rates are truncated at 600. Fifteen classes represent different ranges of infection rate per 1,000 population. PWH is a tertiary teaching hospital and the site of the first SSE and nosocomial cluster in the Hong Kong epidemic. AMOY and NTKLOW were subsequent community SSE clusters that had a strong putative environmental etiology. the null hypothesis of a random pattern is rejected and the point patterns exhibit a high degree of clustering. the point patterns exhibit a tendency toward clustering but a more widespread distribution compared with others. the NTKLOW cluster recorded the lowest R score, substantiating earlier observations from Figure 6. Figure 7. Spatial clusters of SARS patients (February\u2013June 2003) by nearest neighbor analysis. no. of SARS cases in a building No. of buildings Total no. of SARS cases 136 1 136 47 1 47 46 1 46 43 1 43 20 1 20 18 1 18 11 1 11 10 3 30 9 1 9 8 3 24 7 2 14 6 6 36 5 3 15 4 12 48 3 47 141 2 156 312 1 759 759 Total 1,709 Cluster analysis. each kernel map shows the density of SARS patients adjusted for underlying population density. the map shows that the urban population was at higher risk of contracting SARS (Moran\u2019s I = 0.78, p 0.001), having already accounted for variation in population density. the map shows that the urban population was at higher risk of contracting SARS. can infer that a larger SD signifies a wider spread of the disease over the territory. the time from day 1 (18 February) through day 16 (6 March) was the prodrome of the epidemic. days 86 (15 May) through 106 (4 June) marked the declining phase of the outbreak. .60* 2277.52* 873.57* 250.41* 58.85* 2.05 *p 0.001 indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected and that the SD is significantly different from or greater than that of day 1. z = 2.33 and F(14,14) = 3.6 at the 0.01 level of significance for one-tailed tests. aMOY cluster (n = 335; R = 0.15; p 0.001); the null hypothesis of a random pattern is rejected. the point patterns exhibit a high degree of clustering. visitors of ward 8A were found to spread the disease farthest from its source. the NTKLOW cluster recorded the lowest R score, substantiating earlier observations from Figure 6. Spatial clusters of SARS patients (February\u2013June 2003) by nearest neighbor analysis. disease mapping is a first step toward understanding spatial aspects of health-related problems. Various cartographic symbolizations can show the distribution of diseases. disease clusters and other associations can be deduced statistically and visually. the daily animated series of kernel maps shows that SARS was a highly localized disease. this confirms that SARS is only a moderately transmissible condition with a basic reproduction number of about 3. faulty sewage systems and the \u201cchimney effect\u201d is the leading hypothesis explaining the AMOY SSE (especially block E) this is a useful adjunct to the usual biomathematical modeling approach. the SD ellipses from the OD analysis yielded information on the direction of spread in a disease cluster that can be used to inform contact tracing and the design of quarantine measures. the epidemic is a clear signal that Hong Kong needs much greater investment in health informatics. integration of GIS technology into routine field epidemiologic surveillance can offer a scientifically rigorous and quantitative method for identification of unusual disease patterns in real time."}
