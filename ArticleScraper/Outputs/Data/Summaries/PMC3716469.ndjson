{"summary": "bacterial plate counts were used to determine the role of lithium chloride (LiCl) in PA keratitis. clinical score, slit-lamp photography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were used to determine the role of LiCl in PA keratitis. in vitro studies further confirmed that LiCl elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression but reduced proinflammatory cytokine production. inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, are recruited to the infection sites. if uncontrolled, these inflammatory mediators often elicit an overly robust response, favoring bystander tissue damage. bacterial virulence factors such as exoenzyme S and exoenzyme T promote neutrophil apoptosis and bacterial survival, leading to aggravation of the severity of PA keratitis [10]. lithium chloride (LiCl) has been used as a mood stabilizer for treating diseases such as bipolar disorder for many years [12] the role of LiCl in ocular infection remains to be determined. we demonstrated that treatment with LiCl in B6 mice promoted host resistance against PA corneal infection, by reducing host inflammatory responses and bacterial burden. marrow cells were flushed from the femur and tibia with ice-cold media. marrow cells were rinsed and treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer. cells were cultured in 1640 media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. more than 95% of isolated cells were neutrophils. in vitro interference, murine macrophage-like cells and mouse bone marrow\u2013derived neutrophils were cultured in the media. mRNA levels were calculated after normalization to -actin. mRNA levels were calculated after normalization to -actin. mRNA levels were calculated after normalization to -actin. blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated with the primary rabbit monoclonal antibodies (Abs) for P-GSK3 (Ser9), -catenin, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; 1:1000; Cell Signaling, Carlsbad, CA) at 4 \u00b0C eyes were fixed in a 3.7% formaldehyde solution (Sigma) and embedded in paraffin. eight-m-thick sections were cut, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and rinsed with distilled water. each section was incubated with TdT incubation buffer, which contains 45 l equilibration buffer, 5 l nucleotide mix, and 1 l TdT enzyme. cells were filtered, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) after blocking, cells were distributed into 100 l samples and incubated with the following Abs for 30 min on ice. cells were pooled, washed, and resuspended in 500 l binding buffer, followed by the addition of 5 l propidium iodide (PI) corneas from LiCl- versus NaCl-treated B6 mice were individually collected at 1 and 5 days p.i. and then homogenized in 0.5 ml of PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. the protein levels of IL-10 and TNF- were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. mice were anesthetized with inhalational anaesthetic, diethyl ether. the cornea of the left eye was wounded with three 1 mm incisions. eyes were examined at 1 day postinfection (p.i.) and/or at times described below. Isolation and culture of mouse bone marrow\u2013derived neutrophils were isolated from 6-week-old female B6 mice. marrow cells were flushed from the femur and tibia with ice-cold Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 media. marrow cells were rinsed and treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer to remove red blood cells. for in vitro interference, murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells and mouse bone marrow\u2013derived neutrophils were cultured in the media with additional 10 mM LiCl versus NaCl [35]. real-time polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was isolated from individual corneas or cell pellets by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) one g of total RNA was reversely transcribed to produce cDNA, and then amplified using SYBR Green whole corneas were lysed and pooled using a 1 ml glass tissue homogenizer in lysis buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT; all purchased from Sigma) for in vitro detection, RAW264.7 cells or bone marrow derived neutrophils were washed three times with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling assay. eyes were fixed in a 3.7% formaldehyde solution (Sigma) and embedded in paraffin. eight-m-thick sections were cut, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and rinsed with DNase-free water. corneal cells were pooled and digested in collagenase type I (Sigma) cells were filtered, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were incubated with the following Abs for 30 min on ice. in vitro cultured cells were pooled, washed, and resuspended in 500 l binding buffer. cells were pooled, washed, and resuspended in 500 l binding buffer. cells were incubated at room temperature away from light for 15 min. terial plate counts Corneas from LiCl- versus NaCl-treated B6 mice were collected at 1 and 5 days p.i. (n=5/group/time) the number of viable bacteria was quantitated as previously described. the efficacy of in vivo use of LiCl was confirmed with western blot. the results showed that subconjunctival injection of LiCl significantly upregulated the protein levels of P-GSK3 and -catenin, suggesting the efficacy of LiCl. hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to examine the histopathology of infected eyes at 5 days p.i. after treatment with LiCl (E) versus NaCl (D). images shown are representative of three individual experiments each with three mice per group. LiCl significantly upregulated the protein levels of IL-10 (Figure 2E, p0.001, p0.01, at 1 and 5 days p.i., respectively) but downregulated the protein levels of TNF- (Figure 2F, both p0.001) these data suggested that LiCl inhibited inflammatory responses in PA keratitis via increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive staining was detected in lithium chloride (LiCl)\u2013 (C and D) versus sodium chloride (NaCl)\u2013treated(A and B) corneas before (N) and at 5 days p.i. no TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the NaCl-treated corneal cells were analyzed with PI staining associated with flow cytometry. PI-positive cells accounted for 5.97% and 10.6% at 1 and 5 days p.i. in the NaCl-treated corneas. the percentages of macrophages and neutrophils in corneal infiltrating cells were determined with F4/80 and Gr-1 staining associated with flow cytometry. the results showed that in the infected corneas, the percentage of neutrophils (Gr-1 positive) and macrophages (F4/80 positive) was 75% and 20%, respectively. other cells (as shown in Gr-1 negative and F4/80 negative) accounted for only 5% of corneal cells IL-10 expression was dramatically increased (Figure 5A, p0.001), while the mRNA levels of IL-6 and TNF- were decreased in the LiCl- versus NaCl-treated RAW264.7 cells after the PA challenge. ELISA data showed that LiCl significantly upregulated IL-10 protein levels in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 5I, p0.01) but downregulated TNF- protein expression in RAW264.7 cells. the protein levels of IL-10 and TNF- were examined with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) in LiCl- versus NaCl-treated murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells (I) and mouse bone marrow\u2013derived neutrophils (J) at 6 h after PA stimulation. cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), P-GSK3 and -catenin in murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells (C) and bone marrow\u2013derived neutrophils (D) at 12 and 24 h after PA stimulation. western blot data showed that LiCl induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 6C) and neutrophils (Figure we also enucleated the infected eyes at 5 days p.i. from LiCl- versus NaCl-treated mice. the results showed that LiCl treatment decreased the bacterial load at 5 days p.i. bacterial burden was decreased in infected B6 corneas at 5 days p.i. after treatment with LiCl (E) versus NaCl (D) images shown are representative of three individual experiments each with three mice per group. mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 were unchanged. LiCl significantly upregulated the protein levels of IL-10. but downregulated the protein levels of TNF-. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5\u2032-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining (green) was detected in lithium chloride (LiCl)\u2013 (C and D) versus sodium chloride (NaCl)\u2013treated corneas before (N) and at 5 days p.i. no TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the NaCl-treated corneas. Lithium chloride promoted inflammatory cell apoptosis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u2013infected corneas. corneal cells were analyzed with flow cytometry associated with triple. PI-positive cells accounted for 5.97% and 10.6% at 1 and 5 days p.i. staining for PI, F4/80, and Gr-1 was calculated by the average percentage of PI-positive cells in either F4/80-positive macrophages (E) or Gr-1-positive neutrophils (F) infected corneas, the percentage of neutrophils (Gr-1 positive) and macrophages (F4/80 positive) was 75% and 20%, respectively. in vitro, selected inflammatory cytokines were determined with real-time PCR. IL-10 expression was dramatically increased (Figure 5A, p0.001), while mRNA levels of IL-6 and TNF- were decreased in the LiCl- versus NaCl-treated RAW264.7 cells after the PA challenge. no change was detected in IL-1 expression between the two groups (Figure 5C) the protein levels of IL-10 and TNF- were examined with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) in LiCl- versus NaCl-treated murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells (I) and mouse bone marrow\u2013derived neutrophils (J) at 6 h after PA stimulation. western blot was used to detect the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), P-GSK3 and -catenin in murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells. additional evidence for the occurrence of apoptosis was obtained with western blot analysis. l promotes apoptosis of macrophages by reducing secretion of TNF-, IL-1, prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide. inflammatory infiltration is another hallmark of corneal inflammation. swine testis cells exhibit antiapoptotic activity in human acute leukemia cells. swine testis cells exhibit antiapoptotic activity in swine testis cells. swine testis cells exhibit antiapoptotic activity in swine testis cells. specific GSK3 inhibitors SB216763 and LiCl displayed different effects in inflammatory cytokine expression. this indicated the participation of other signaling pathways in the LiCl-induced anti-inflammatory responses. the role of inflammatory cell apoptosis remains controversial."}
