{"summary": "posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant public health problem. about 6.8% of adults develop PTSD in their lifetimes. 3.5% of survivors of traumatic events will develop chronic PTSD. Xiao-Yao-San, Xiao-Tan-Jie-Yu-Fang (XTJYF) is one of the most popular [30\u201336] herbal formulas have been used to treat depression. XTJYF has been widely used in china and some other Asian countries. participants were invited to participate in a diagnostic face-to-face or telephone interview with one of three experienced psychiatrists. PTSD was the primary diagnosis of each enrollee, according to the DSM III. participation was contingent on a negative serum pregnancy test and a medically accepted method of contraception. participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time. clinical diagnoses, physicals, and laboratory examinations were conducted in the outpatient clinic at the air force Sanatorium in the city of Dujiangyan. the SCL-90-R is a questionnaire for self-reporting psychological distress. it is widely used in patients suffering from mental diseases and for psychological evaluation of healthy individuals. the questionnaire is well accepted for its good internal consistency, dimensional structure, reliability, and validity [43\u201345]. XTJYF contains all the herbs of the original formula, except sheng-Jiang, plus additional seven herbs, including Fa Ban-Xia (Rhizoma Pinelliae preparatae) and Chen-Pi (Pericarpium Citri reticulatae), commonly used for psychological disorders. the resulting granules were packaged by the Chinese Drug Preparation Department of Shanghai Changzheng Hospital. the placebo was composed of dextrin, sunset yellow fcf, and a sweetener. the proportion was 1200 : 1 : 7 after being tested on five independent volunteers. missing values in the SCL-90-R questionnaire were imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method. for primary outcomes, effect sizes (for three global indices) and number needed to treat (NNT, for rate of response in the GSI) are reported in the treatment effect assessment. clinical diagnoses, physicals, and laboratory examinations were conducted in the outpatient clinic at the air force Sanatorium in the city of Dujiangyan. clinical diagnoses, physicals, and laboratory examinations were mainly conducted in the outpatient clinic at the air force Sanatorium in the city of Dujiangyan. study interventions All patients received 12 g packages of granulated XTJYF or placebo twice a day for eight weeks. the questionnaire is widely used in patients suffering from mental diseases. the questionnaire is well accepted for its good internal consistency, dimensional structure, reliability, and validity. individual SCL-90-R factors have been used to evaluate the psychological condition of PTSD patients. patients were closely monitored for adverse events and worsening of symptoms. the time of onset of any observed or spontaneously reported AE, its duration and severity, any action taken, and the outcome were recorded. raw herbs were purchased from the Lei Yun Shang Pharmaceutical Company. the herbs were extracted with water, and the resulting granules were packaged. the placebo granules were designed to resemble the XTJYF granules in taste, smell, and appearance. Statistical analysis on both primary and secondary outcomes was done using intention-to-treat analysis. missing values in the SCL-90-R questionnaire were imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method. women constituted 72% of XTJYF-treated and 71% of placebo-treated patients. Ages ranged from 16 to 85; 64% were over 45. n (%) 7 (5.7) 11 (9.0) 0.34 Baseline outcome measures from SCL-90-R, mean (SD) Global severity index 1.14 (0.61) 1.12 (0.60) 0.78 Positive symptom total index 48.4 (20.0) 48.8 (18.8) 0.87 Positive symptom distress index 2.14 (0.97) 2.00 (0.52) 0.18 Table 3 shows the urgency of the public health needs of these earthquake-affected PTSD patients. the original data was obtained from Derogatis [41]. we recalculated the original data from \u201cmean (sd)\u201d to \u201cmean (95% CI)\u201d in order to make these data comparable. compared to the Chinese and American norms, P 0.05. 20% of the XTJYF patients versus 12% of those in the placebo group were \u201cvery much improved\u201d but this result is not statistically significant (P value = 0.001) Table 4. XTJYF treatment effect on primary and secondary outcomes. XTJYF treatment has moderate effect on somatization, depression, anxiety, and hostility, as well as a small effect on obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, and phobic anxiety. treatment tolerability Overall, XTJYF was well tolerated. compliance rate, 83% for the XTJYF and 81% for the placebo group, was reasonably high. most frequently reported AEs were nausea (14.6% versus 9.0%; P = 0.24), diarrhea (10.6% versus 6.5%; P = 0.36), and malaise (10.6% versus 12.3%; P = 0.69). women constituted 72% of XTJYF-treated and 71% of placebo-treated patients.

XTJYF treatment effect on primary and secondary outcomes. XTJYF treatment has moderate effect on somatization, depression, anxiety, and hostility, as well as a small effect on obsessive-compulsive behavior (P = 0.036), depression (P = 0.001) and hostility (P = 0.019). XTJYF treatment yielded statistically significant improvement in sleep quality. compliance rate, 83% for the XTJYF and 81% for the placebo group, was reasonably high. most frequently reported AEs were nausea (14.6% versus 9.0%; P = 0.24), diarrhea (10.6% versus 6.5%; P = 0.36), and malaise (10.6% versus 12.3%; P = 0.69). XTJYF significantly improved all of the three global indices of SCl-90-R. compared to placebo, XTJYF significantly improved all of the three global indices of SCl-90-R. a significantly greater proportion of patients were \u201cmuch improved\u201d according to changes in GSI score. co-morbid PTSD/depression appears to predict greater refractoriness to pharmacotherapy, greater symptom severity, lower levels of functioning and rates of recovery, and increased disability and potential of suicide. XTJYF also appears to improve the sleep quality of these PTSD patients; sleep disturbances are among the most treatment-resistant symptoms of PTSD [75] Xiao-Yao-San and its modifications were reported to suppress chronic stress by maintaining the stability of hippocampal neurons [84], inhibiting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis negative feedback regulation [85], and counteracting increase of Ca2+ concentration in hippocampal synaptosomes [86]. the widely used SCL-90-R captures a broader patient psychological profile than a specific PTSD questionnaire would do. only one dose of XTJYF was used in this study, that used in standard clinical practice."}
