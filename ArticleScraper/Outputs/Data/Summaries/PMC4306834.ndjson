{"summary": "eukaryotic translation is a complex process orchestrated by a wide range of players, including several protein factors and three classes of RNA (ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) this process is comprised of three main steps: initiation, elongation and termination. the process is comprised of three main steps: elongation and termination. mRNAs are capped with a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) and polyadenylated at their 3'-end immediately after transcription. the m7G cap is then recognized by the cap-binding complex (CBP80/20) HIV-1 protease partially inhibits translation initiation by targeting PABP, eIF3 and eIF4G (red lines); HIV-Tat protein and high concentration of HIV-1 TAR element indirectly promote viral translation by blocking PKR activity (red line) mRNAs undergo a CBC-mediated pioneer round of translation, which is important for the quality control of the transcript. 43S PIC employs a discriminatory sequence-based mechanism. the mRNA scans the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) until it recognizes a start codon (AUG) by complementarity with the anticodon of the Met-tRNAi. 80S ribosome decodes the mRNA sequence and mediates the addition of amino acids to elongate the growing polypeptide chain. eEF1A-GTP complex carries each aminoacylated tRNA to the 80S ribosome A site where it builds codon-anticodon interactions. eEF1A-GTP transports the aminoacylated tRNAs into the 80S ribosome A site. the HIV-1 RTC recruits eEF1 to stimulate late steps of the HIV-1 reverse transcription process (green line); polypeptide elongation continues until a stop codon triggers the translation termination step. this process is mediated by the eukaryotic translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3. after protein release, eRF1 remains bound to the post-TC. mRNA is activated (step 3) and 43S PIC formation takes place (step 4 to 5) the mRNA recruits the 43S PIC and scanning begins until an initiation codon is detected (step 6). at this point, the 48S initiation complex is formed and the 60S subunit is recruited to form the 80S complex (step 7 to 9). ternary complex formation occurs through the assembly of the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet), eIF2 and a GTP molecule. the TC is then recruited to the ribosomal subunit 40S to assemble the 43S PIC (Figure 1, step 5). in this process, other eIFs are required to promote TC binding to the 40S subunit. eIF5B causes the dissociation of eIF3, eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF5. eIF5B self-dissociates from the assembled 80S ribosome by its GTPase activity. this reaction also triggers the release of eIF1A to finally form an elongation competent 80S ribosome. mRNA recruits the 43S PIC and scanning begins until an initiation codon is detected. the 48S initiation complex is formed and the 60S subunit is recruited to form the 80S complex (step 7 to 9). mRNAs undergo a pioneer round of translation, which is important for the quality control of the transcript. ternary complex formation occurs through the assembly of the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet), eIF2 and a GTP molecule. the TC is recruited to the ribosomal subunit 40S to assemble the 43S PIC. in this process, other eIFs are required to promote TC binding to the 40S subunit. codon is mediated by eIF5B which causes the dissociation of eIF3, eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF5. eIF5B self-dissociates from the assembled 80S ribosome by its GTPase activity. eEF1A-GTP complex carries each aminoacylated tRNA to the 80S ribosome A site. the 80S ribosome-mediated peptide bond formation precedes ribosome translocation mediated by eEF2 (step 3). the ribosome begins another cycle of peptide elongation (step 4). the ribosome begins another cycle of peptide elongation (step 4). RNA helicase DDX3 directly binds to the HIV-1 5'UTR and interacts with eIF4G and PABP to promote translation initiation of HIV-1 genomic RNA. in vitro experiments revealed that cytoplasmic DDX3 is able to bind the m7G cap independently of eIF4E, but not with CBP20/80 and eIF4E. RNA Helicase A promotes translation of TAR-bearing RNAs independently of its ability to inhibit protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) other RNA-binding proteins have been shown to stimulate HIV-1 translation. the vpu-env bicistronic mRNA is formed after splicing of the 9 kb mRNA. the upstream ORF that stimulates Env translation is boxed in green. uORFs are short open reading frames located within the 5'UTR of a mRNA. cap-dependent translation of HIV-1 unspliced mRNA has been observed in vitro and ex vivo. the eIF4F complex can mediate both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation initiation. IRESs present in several viral mRNAs overcome a global translation down-regulation established by the cell during viral infection. ette et al. [34] showed that HIV-1 protein synthesis is highly dependent on cap-initiation the first 24\u201348 h of viral replication. eIF4G and PABP, two main components of the cap-dependent translation initiation, were targeted by picornavirus proteases. in vif, vpr, vpu or nef transcripts, specific ITAFs bind regions of the 5'UTR common to all these transcripts to form a \u201cCore IRES\u201d that stimulate IRES-mediated translation. but the IRES activity of these transcripts could be regulated by specific RNA sequences present downstream of the common 5'UTR [42] the HIV-1 Gag IRES mediates translation of both full length Pr55Gag polyprotein and a N-truncated 40-kDa Gag (p40) isoform lacking the matrix domain. expression of p40 has also been observed in all HIV-1 clinical isolates from a large cohort of patients. frameshift is mediated by a slippery heptanucleotide sequence. the pause forces the 80S complexes to shift one nucleotide backwards into the pol sequence. the two tRNAs are translocated only by two nucleotides due to the FSS. this region slows down the rate of translation initiation during cap-dependent translation. the distance between ribosomes is larger and the FSS has more time to refold. the increase in the 1 frameshift efficiency is antagonized by the HIV-1 Tat protein, which indirectly destabilizes TAR structure. Vpr-induced G2/M arrest also inhibits host protein translation by a process involving the regulation of eIF4E activity. translation of HIV-1 structural proteins is maintained by a process involving the regulation of eIF4E activity. despite the global reduction of host protein synthesis by Vpr-induced G2/M arrest, translation of HIV-1 structural proteins is maintained. degradation of eIF4G and PABP leads to an inhibition of the cap- and PABP-dependent translation initiation [67,68,69,70]. this cleavage presents a similar efficiency to the one of the Pr55Gag. PKR interacts with the TAR element, inducing PKR dimerization, auto-phosphorylation and activation. the HIV-1 Pr55Gag binds to eEF1A through its matrix (MA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains. both eEF1A and eEF1A-tRNA complexes are incorporated into virions. eEF1A can also interact with the cellular cytoskeleton, suggesting a possible role of eEF1A in virion assembly and budding. eEF1 binds to the HIV-1 RTC through an interaction with reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) this association enhances the stability of the RTC in the cytoplasm. further studies will be needed to establish whether eEF1 functions synergistically with the components of the RTC, or independently during reverse transcription. kinetic analyses and in vitro transcription-translation experiments showed that Vif binds to A3G mRNA and inhibits its translation in vitro. in these experiments, Vif caused a two-fold reduction of A3G translation in a 5'UTR-dependent manner, most likely through mRNA binding. cytoplasmic DDX3 is able to bind the m7G cap independently of eIF4E. DDX3 substitutes for eIF4E to stimulate compartmentalized translation initiation of HIV-1 unspliced mRNAs. this stimulation is dependent on a Rev binding site, in addition to the RRE. aring RNAs independently of its ability to inhibit protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) both proteins stimulate translation of TAR-containing reporter transcripts. this is the case with Staufen [26] and La autoantigen [27]. v translation is stimulated by a six-nucleotide upstream ORF (uORF) uORFs are short open reading frames located within the 5'UTR of a mRNA. mutations in the upstream AUG codons of the Env ORF had little effect on Env synthesis. the HIV-1 genomic mRNA presents two IRESs. one in the viral 5'UTR, named HIV-1 IRES [32] and a second within the gag coding region, known as HIV-1 Gag IRES [37]. the HIV-1 IRES has been characterized in a proviral wild-type HIV-1 clone (pNL4.3) [32], but also in the CXCR4 (X4)-tropic primary isolate HIV-LAI [38] and in viral plank et al. [42] demonstrated that the HIV-1 IRES is cell type-specific. despite the fact that all spliced and unspliced HIV-1 transcripts possess the same 289 nt long 5'UTR, the IRES activity of these transcripts differ from the gag transcript. human embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like protein (HuR) has been identified as a negative regulator of the HIV-1 IRES activity [45]. eIF5 [43], the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) and the Rev-cofactors DDX3 and hRIP [43] have been reported as cellular factors increasing the HIV-1 IRES activity. p40 is produced at a much lower level than Pr55Gag. this protein appears to be important in wild-type replication of HIV-1 in cultured cells. p40 is synthesized at a 1/10 ratio compared to Gag. pause forces 80S complexes to shift one nucleotide backwards into the pol sequence. the two tRNAs are translocated only by two nucleotides due to the FSS. this is supported by the cryo-EM structure resolved by Namy et al. [58] the helicase DDX17 is required for 1 frameshift and for maintaining proper ratios of Gag vs. Gag-Pol proteins. cap-dependent translation of HIV-1 unspliced mRNA has been observed in vitro and ex vivo. the HIV-1 IRES is harbored within the region spanning nucleotides 104 to 336 [32] the minimal active HIV-1 IRES is harbored within the region spanning nucleotides 104 to 336 [32] the 43S pre-initiation complex can mediate both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation initiation. vif, vpr, vpu, and nef transcripts can initiate translation by an IRES. despite the fact that all HIV-1 constructs contain the same 5' leader region, the IRES activity of these transcripts differ from the gag transcript [42]. cistronic mRNA identified another region upstream of the PBS, the IRES negative element (IRENE) that negatively regulates the HIV-1 IRES activity. several HIV-1 IRES ITAFs have been identified from G2/M-arrested cell extracts. the shift places the gag termination codon into an out-of-frame context. translation continues toward the downstream pol sequence. the structure of the FSS and its mechanistic mode of action are not well understood. the presence of the HIV-1 5'UTR in a reporter mRNA increases the 1 frameshift efficiency. this is associated with the presence of the TAR region within the 5'UTR. this region slows down the rate of translation initiation during cap-dependent translation. eIF4E-binding proteins 4E-BPs compete with eIF4G for the same binding site on eIF4F complex assembly. viral proteins alter cell function by affecting different cellular pathways. viral protein R (Vpr) has been identified as a viral protein capable of arresting cells. HIV-1 protease partially impairs cap-dependent protein translation. degradation of eIF4G and PABP leads to an inhibition of the cap- and PABP-dependent translation initiation. studies with TAR and other RNAs showed high concentration of double-stranded RNA inhibits PKR dimerization and therefore its activation. PKR activation is further inhibited by HIV-induced mechanisms involving the cellular factors TRBP, Adenosine deaminase ADAR1 and a change in PACT function. HIV-1 reverse transcription complex recruits eEF1 to stimulate late steps of the HIV-1 reverse transcription process. the eEF1 factor binds to the HIV-1 RTC through an interaction with reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) this association enhances the stability of the RTC in the cytoplasm. Vif impairs translation of A3G mRNA through a putative mRNA-binding mechanism [85,86] authors reported that Vif causes a 4.6 fold reduction in A3G synthesis by pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments. ribosomal scanning inhibition due to highly structured RNA elements and cap-dependent translation inhibition triggered by host immune responses. these mechanisms promote translation of HIV-1 proteins, but also guarantee the fitness of newly produced viral particles by inhibiting A3G incorporation."}
