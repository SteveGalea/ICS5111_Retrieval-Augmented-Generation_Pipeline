{"summary": "the highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples. the highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples. this signature included 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines. a signature is the minimum number of biological variables required to discriminate the phenotype of interest from other phenotypes. the derivation of gene expression signatures from multiple, independent studies is hindered by a number of factors including the absence of standard experimental protocols, biological variability, and limited sample sizes. influenza A subtype H5N1 (\"avian influenza\") was reconstructed 1918 influenza A, or SARS-CoV strain icHC/SZ/61/03. data were quality-controlled, further pre-processed and converted to gene-level data. Influenza A H5N1 HK483 (A/HK/483/97), HK486 (A/HK/486/97), HK486PB2MT (A/HK/486 PB2-627K/97) BALB/c 2, 4 dpi 0% survival (with HK483, HK486PB2MT), 25% (with HK486) Fornek 2009 [36] Influenza A H5N1 VN/1203 (Viet the compendium was assembled from multiple microarray data sets. it was either separated into intensity-level measurements or converted to log-ratios. different meta-analysis methods were applied and resulted in two classes of signatures. a third signature comprised 57 genes and was derived from the direct comparison of expression in HPIs vs. LPIs without reference to mock infections. additional normalization allowed inter-array comparisons and a fold-change-based z-test was used to determine differential expression. the highest degree of clustering and separation was obtained using the analog signature. conditions clustered more tightly by pathogenicity using this signature than other signatures. PC1 accounted for a greater proportion of the total variance, 18%. more samples would appear in two quadrants, with more LPI samples in quadrant II (LPI-high/HPI-low) and more HPI samples in quadrant IV (LPI-low/HPI-high) where quadrants are defined by an equal partitioning of the PCC scatter plot plane at (0.5, 0.5) digital gene signatures resulted in improved segregation of samples by pathogenicity, as indicated by increased numbers of LPI and HPI samples in quadrants. the analog signature yielded the best segregation of test set samples. the analog signature resulted in an accuracy rate of 83% (15 of 18 samples) the same exemplar samples were used for HPI (x-axis) and LPI (y-axis) as in Figure 3. annotations for the better-performing digital signature (derived from Fisher's statistic) indicated that a number of pathways may have been altered during HPIs. similar annotations were found to be enriched among the genes of the remaining digital signature. signature genes are shaded with those also encoding CXCR3 ligands in yellow and those also encoding CCR3 ligands in orange. specific classes of molecules are indicated by shape (legend) proportionally expressed signature genes expressed in proportion to pathogenicity could in turn be ranked by level of expression in HPIs. most highly expressed signature genes in HPIs were interferon-induced including IFIT3, CXCL10, IIGP1 and IGTP. expression overlapping between LPI and MPI, as well as between MPI and HPI. all samples of a given pathogenicity were averaged together (using variance-weighted averages) each average was used as a new exemplar.

PCA and PCC scatter plots were consistent in indicating that the analog signature achieved the best separation of transcriptional profiles by pathogenicity. analog signature yielded the best segregation of test set samples. the same exemplar samples were used for HPI (x-axis) and LPI (y-axis) as in Figure. 3. a number of pathways may have been altered during HPIs. similar annotations were found to be enriched among the genes of the remaining digital signature. analog signature was significantly enriched in genes associated with the inflammatory response and chemokine activity. different gene signatures identified inflammation as dysregulated during HPIs. genes indicated a relationship between signature expression and pathogenicity. we determined the proportion of signature genes whose expression was ordered by pathogenicity. by comparison we observed that 43% of all genes in the compendium displayed these patterns. new exemplars were generated for each pathogenicity group representing the average expression of signature genes during LPIs, MPIs, and HPIs. new exemplars were generated for each pathogenicity group representing the average expression of signature genes during LPIs, MPIs, and HPI. to this end we assembled a compendium of transcriptome measurements from the lungs of mice and used meta-analysis to determine gene signatures that distinguished high- from low-pathogenicity infections. previous studies have applied meta-analysis to infection data but focused on more general features of disease. the 74-gene signature derived using Fisher's summary statistic showed a modest capacity to separate samples into pathogenicity groups and to predict test set pathogenicity. some of the genes up-regulated during HPIs are non-essential to resolving influenza infection and that dysregulated activation may even be detrimental to the host. CXCR3 is expressed on the surface of Th1 cells as well as NK and NKT cells and regulates the migration of these cells to sites of infection. the analog signature also included genes for chemokines that bind the receptor, specifically MCP-3 (CCL7) and MCP-4 (CCL13). the expression of both sets of chemokines may reflect a high degree of dysregulation during HPIs. uteroglobin/CC16 (SCGB1A1) is secreted by bronchiolar Clara cells. it is postulated to have a role in reducing airway inflammation. but its exact function remains to be elucidated. pathogenicities of the corresponding experiments were determined by examination of published outcome data. we defined HPIs as experiments resulting in 0% survival, LPIs as experiments resulting in 100% survival, and MPIs as experiments resulting in intermediate levels of survival. a biological condition was defined as any unique study/time point/virus strain/mouse strain combination. log-ratio measurements were combined resulting in measurements for 27,567 genes by 397 biological conditions. all data-handling tasks were performed using custom scripts in Perl. modules were tested for associations with HPI and LPI outcomes. fold change-based z-test Intensity-based measurements were used to test for differential expression in all HPIs vs. all LPIs. genes with log2 (HPI/LPI) -1.6 or > 2 were retained. we identified significant annotations by enrichment scores > 1.30. data was included in the compendium if they were derived from experiments on wild-type mice. data were sourced from either in-house or external studies. two-channel data were separated into individual channels. interarray normalization was performed using NeONORM. log-ratio measurements from all studies were combined. p-values were shuffled 1000 times among biological conditions. the signature comprised genes found to be oppositely regulated in HPI and LPI. the signature comprised the largest module found to be oppositely regulated in HPI and LPI. an enrichment score is calculated for clusters of similar annotations. we assessed enrichment of the GO categories GOTERM_BP_ALL, GOTERM_CC_ALL, and COTERM_MF_ALL. each parent gene set was derived using Fisher's summary statistic following one-tailed t-tests on each biological condition in the compendium. each intersection was found to represent a significantly larger proportion of its two parent gene sets than expected by chance. genes met the criterion of being expressed from greatest to least or from least to greatest (inset) by pathogenicity. errors represent standard errors of the means across all HPI, MPI, or LPI conditions."}
