{"summary": "TEXT Klebsiella pneumoniae is part of the ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) the most common infections caused by K. pneumoniae are pneumonia, septicemias, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and soft tissue infections recent efforts to isolate inhibitors of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes led to the description of small molecules and metal ions complexed to ionophores. zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) induce a reduction in the AMK resistance levels of K. pneumoniae JHCK1 (17) growth inhibition assays were carried out in Mueller-Hinton broth. benzoic acid (DTNB) reacts with the coenzyme A (CoA)-SH released from acetyl-CoA after acetylation of the substrate (23). we recently showed that Zn2+ significantly interferes with the acetylation of aminoglycosides catalyzed by AAC(6\u2032)-Ib (19). this result agrees with that recently observed in a similar study (22). the tolerance was lost after successive cultures in the absence of pyrithione (26). however, the tolerance was lost after successive cultures in the absence of pyrithione (26). CuPT inhibited the resistance to AMK, but the level of inhibition was not as high as that observed when ZnPT was tested. the percentage of acetylating activity of AMK by AAC(6\u2032)-Ib was calculated for reaction mixtures containing different concentrations of CuCl2. the panels show the effect on cell growth of addition of ZnPT (A and B) or CuPT (C and D) in the presence (B and D) or absence of 16 g/ml AMK."}
