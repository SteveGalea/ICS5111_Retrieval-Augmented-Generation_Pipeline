{"summary": "chemokines belong to the cytokine family of peptides that induce the maturation and trafficking of leukocytes. some chemokines have been linked to pro-inflammatory events, associated with chronic pain (White et al., 2005) or brain diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (Schmidtmayerova et al., 1997; Conant et al., 1998), multiple sclerosis (Hvas CCL5 promotes migration of dorsal root ganglia cells in vitro. ex vivo activation of CCL5 receptor (CCR5) by CCL5 increases glucose transporter type 4 membrane translocation in the hypothalamus. different effects of CCL5 could be due to ability of this chemokine to bind to multiple receptors. astrocytes appear to express CCL5 at high levels (Avdoshina et al., 2010); oligodendrocytes (Balabanov et al., 2007), microglia (Avdoshina et al., 2010) and neurons (Mocchetti et al., 2013), all release CCL5. animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and intracardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) whole brains were quickly removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight. post-fixed brains were used for RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies. mounted tissue sections were serially dehydrated in 50%, 70%, 95%, 100% and 100% ethanol for 5 min each. in between all pretreatment steps, sections were briefly washed with ultra-pure water. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1:500, EMD Millipore) in presence of 2% NGS in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. brain slices treated with NeuN antibody incubated for 72 h at 4\u00b0C. the total number of CCL5 mRNA positive cells were quantified in five (corpus callosum and cortex) and three (hippocampus and VTA) microscopic fields per brain section (20X, 151.894 mm2) data for RNAscope and IHC are representative of sections obtained from three animals. coronal sections of the rat brain indicating where CCL5 mRNA puncta (red dots) were detected. representative sections through the corpus callosum (cc) and cingulate cortex (cg), external capsule (ec) and caudate/putamen (CPu) and anterior commissure (Ac) positive CCL5 mRNA hybridization was observed in GFAP (A1\u20133) positive cells. panels (A4\u2013C4) are higher magnifications of the areas shown by arrows.

Bethesda, MD, USA) three coronal sections of the rat brain indicate where CCL5 mRNA puncta (red dots) were detected. (A1\u2013A3) Representative sections through the corpus callosum (cc) and cingulate cortex (cg), external capsule (ec) and caudate/putamen (CPu) and anterior commissure (Ac) positive mRNA hybridization was observed in GFAP (A1\u20133), Iba-1 (B1\u20133), and Nkx2.2 (C1\u20133) positive cells. panels (A4\u2013C4) are higher magnifications of the areas shown by arrows. DAPI (blue) was used as a counterstaining to show nuclei. in brain sections from WT and CCL5 KO mice, the CCL5 probe produced a strong fluorescent signal, characterized by red dots co-localizing with DAPI positive cells. a subpopulation of cells expresses CCL5 mRNA, evidenced by the lack of red puncta in several DAPI-stained nuclei. the corpus callosum (cc, Figure 2A1) and the anterior commissure (Ac, Figure 2A3) contained more puncta than the caudate/putamen (CPu, Figure 2A2) in the cerebral cortex, more hybridization was observed in layers III/IV than II and VI. in the thalamus, the ventroposterior medial nucleus exhibited more CCL5 mRNA hybridization than the ventroposterior medial nucleus ( the levels of CCL5 mRNA are arbitrarily graded as occasional (+), low (++), moderate (+++) and high (++++) based on the intensity of hybridization signal. the levels of CCL5 mRNA are arbitrarily graded as occasional (+), low (++), moderate (+++) and high (++++). mRNA in the corpus callosum is predominantly inside nuclei of cells. GFAP, Iba-1 and Nkx2.2 positive cells expressed CCL5 mRNA. no CCL5 mRNA was found in neurons. layers III-V contained CCL5 mRNA, although most of the puncta were in layers III and IV (Figure 2B1) to characterize which cells express CCL5 mRNA in these layers, serial sections were examined by RNAscope\u00ae in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry. neuron-specific nuclear protein marker NeuN was used to detect neurons. chemistry were used to identify cells within the primary somatosensory cortex expressing CCL5 mRNA. chemistry were used to identify cells within the primary somatosensory cortex expressing CCL5 mRNA (red dots) in NeuN positive cells (green). mRNA were found outside and inside the nuclei (Figure 6A4) in the polymorphic cells layer of the DG. microglia (Figures 6C1\u20134) and astrocytes (Figure 6D1\u20134) were positive for CCL5 mRNA. overall, in the hippocampus, CCL5 mRNA was found in 73.2% of neurons. astrocytes and few oligodendrocytes express CCL5 mRNA in 11.4%, 13.7%, and 5.9% respectively. sections were stained with an antibody against TH, the rate limiting step enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine. rats and mouse CCL5 mRNA share high sequence similarity (>90%). therefore, we first validated the specificity of the CCL5 probe for RNAscope\u00ae by comparing mRNA signal in brain sections from WT and CCL5 KO mice. figures 2A\u2013C show a schematic representation of three representative coronal brain sections. the corpus callosum (cc, Figure 2A1) and the anterior commissure (Ac, Figure 2A3) contained more puncta than the caudate/putamen (CPu, Figure 2A2) in the cerebral cortex, more hybridization was observed in layers III/IV than II and VI. the levels of CCL5 mRNA are arbitrarily graded as occasional (+), low (++), moderate (+++) and high (++++) based on the intensity of hybridization signal. we observed CCL5 mRNA positive signal in several brain areas. striatum, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain showed more CCL5 mRNA signal than the ventromedial one (Table 1). striatum, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain showed more CCL5 mRNA signal than the ventromedial one (Table 1). mRNA is most abundant in the white matter that contains fiber tracts. a-1 and Nkx2.2 positive cells expressed CCL5 mRNA while no CCL5 mRNA was found in neurons. the results validate the notion that the corpus callosum contains a high percentage of oligodendrocytes expressing CCL5 mRNA. a-1 and Nkx2.2 positive cells expressed CCL5 mRNA. 9% of neurons, 44.1% of astrocytes, 12% of microglia and 13.3% oligodendrocytes were also positive for CCL5 mRNA. RNAscope and immunohistochemistry were used to identify cells within the primary somatosensory cortex expressing CCL5 mRNA. in neurons, red puncta that correspond to CCL5 mRNA were found outside and inside the nuclei. microglia (Figures 6B1\u20134) and astrocytes (Figures 6D1\u20134) were positive for CCL5 mRNA. in the hippocampus, CCL5 mRNA was found in 73.2% of neurons. RNAscope\u00ae in situ hybridization followed by immunohistochemistry revealed that 79% of neurons express CCL5 mRNA in this region. microglia, astrocytes, and few oligodendrocytes also express CCL5 mRNA in 11.4%, 13.7% and 5.9% respectively. our results reveal a unique expression profile of CCL5 mRNA throughout the adult rodent brain. we found that the cellular anatomical distribution of this chemokine is highly regionalized and restricted to certain parts of the brain. a constitutive expression of CCL5 mRNA was also present in some subset of neuronal cell in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. mRNA is constitutively expressed in all glial cells (microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) as well as in a subset of neurons. the fact that CCL5 proteins are detected in the adult brain supports the notion that CCL5 might have a role as potential modulators of brain function. oligodendrocyte precursors or other glial cells might be regulating their own proliferation via the release of CCL5. oligodendrocytes maintain axonal integrity, support axonal metabolism and aid neuronal survival. CCL5 is not the only chemokine that is expressed in neurons. CCL2 is constitutively expressed in neurons, and co-localizes with various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. neurotransmitters are capable of releasing CCL5. dopaminergic neurons belong to the dopaminergic mesolimbic system. it comprises several interconnected brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. this system is crucial for the reward and addictive properties of opioids. our data suggest a role for CCL5 in the CNS other than a homeostatic chemokine that attracts and activates mononuclear phagocytes at sites of inflammation. authors say the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
