{"summary": "despite the limitations of epidemiology studies, they remain a critical component of biomedical research. epidemiology studies convey important information about disease characteristics, the type of patients affected, and the frequency and outcomes of the disease. these studies reinforce the frequency of deaths related to atherosclerotic disease, cancer and sepsis in developed countries. longitudinal epidemiology studies on a local level can be used for quality control purposes. longitudinal studies are invaluable for understanding how a disease is changing and how it affects patients in the studied healthcare system. data confirm previous secular trends in the incidence and mortality of sepsis [2-4] and define the severity of disease and heterogeneity of case-mix typical of sepsis. the value of these data is even more apparent in a system of national healthcare insurance."}
