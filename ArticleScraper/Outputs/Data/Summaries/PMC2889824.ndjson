{"summary": "viral envelope glycoproteins are multimeric proteins that facilitate the fusion of viral and target cell lipid membranes during the initiation of infection. they allow rapid membrane fusion by drawing the opposing membranes together and either stabilizing or providing the activation energy to surmount the transition state [1], [2]. they behave in many aspects like a fusion catalyst. the authors of some of these structures have predicted that several regions of these proteins might be targets for inhibition [11], [14], [15]. this approach makes use of a residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF) score to identify in situ amino acid sequences that are likely to have high structural and binding stability [23], [24]. DENV E glycoprotein has multiple accessible surfaces that can be targeted by distinct inhibitors. the results indicate that the DENV E glycoprotein has multiple accessible surfaces that can be targeted by distinct inhibitors. the results presented here indicate that the DENV E glycoprotein has multiple accessible surfaces that can be targeted by distinct inhibitors. a search algorithm was used to change each amino acid in the 20 residue window to one of the other 19 naturally occurring amino acids. if a particular change resulted in a better RAPDF score (lower pseudoenergy), then a random choice was made to retain the corresponding change. this procedure enables design of peptides that will result in high structural and binding stability (i.e., the best RAPDF scores/pseudoenergies) target cells were seeded at a density of 1105 cells in each well of a 6-well plate 24 h prior to infection. 200 focus forming units (FFU) of virus were incubated with or without peptide in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, with rocking every 15 m. infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. results are expressed as the average of at least two independent trials with three replicates each. IC50 values were determined using variable slope sigmoidal dose-response curve fits with GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. DN81opt was determined graphically due to a lack of data points to produce a reasonable curve fit. purified virus was mixed with 1OAN or DN57opt at a concentration of 1 molecule of peptide for every E protein on the surface of the virus. the complex was incubated for half an hour at 37\u00b0C followed by half an hour at 4\u00b0C and then flash frozen on holey carbon grids in liquid ethane. bind to E protein in PBS with 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20 and 1 mg/ml BSA. affinities were calculated as the kinetic dissociation rate constant divided by the kinetic association rate constant. Virus was incubated at 4\u00b0C with peptides, control anti-dengue serum, or heparan sulfate in DMEM/BSA/HEPES for one hour before adding to the monolayers for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. monolayers were rinsed 3 times with cold DMEM/BSA/HEPES media. x-ray diffraction structure of DENV-2 envelope protein was used as a template. for each peptide, we randomly selected a residue side chain and substituted it with a new side chain. substitution was performed using a backbone-dependent side chain rotamer library and a linear repulsive steric energy term. Viruses and cells DENV-2 strain NG-C was obtained from the university of Texas at Galveston. a random choice was made to retain the corresponding change. a random choice was made to retain the corresponding change. at a density of 1105 cells in each well of a 6-well plate 24 h prior to infection. 200 focus forming units (FFU) of virus were incubated with or without peptide in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells with agar overlays were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 m to set the agar. Toxicity assay Cytotoxicity of peptides was measured by monitoring mitochondrial reductase activity using the TACSTM MTT cell proliferation assay. peptides were added to confluent monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells in 96-well plates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. absorption at 560 nm was measured using a Tecan GeniosPro plate reader (Tecan US, Durham, NC) biolayer interferometry was performed on an Octet QK system. peptides were biotinylated with a 51 molar ratio of NHS-LC-LC-Biotin. post-infection treatment focus forming unit assay Approximately 200 FFU of DENV-2 without peptide was allowed to bind and enter target cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. unbound virus was then removed by rinsing with PBS and peptide was added to the cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were rinsed again with cold PBS, and immunological detection was conducted as described for the focus forming unit assay. quantitative, real time, reverse transcriptase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted using the Roche Lightcycler RNA Master SYBR Green 1 qRT-PCR kit (Basel, Switzerland) the following cycling conditions: 1 h at 61\u00b0C, 30 s at 95\u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of: 5 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 61\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. DN57opt, DN80opt and DN81opt were selected for synthesis and evaluated for antiviral activity. these sequences generally had the best RAPDF scores (or \u201cpseudoenergies\u201d) for structural stability and binding, much better (lower than the original wild type sequences. names and sequences for previously tested wild type peptides are denoted with an asterisk. peptides that did not achieve 50% inhibition are noted with a dashed line. a 20 residue window moved from the N to the C terminus of the DENV-2 strain S1 E protein. RAPDF scores of a sliding window of 20 amino acid peptide sequences are shown graphically by vertical black lines. four major high binding regions are predicted, from amino acids 31\u201370, 121\u2013160, 241\u2013270, and 341\u2013380, respectively. locations of other optimized peptides are indicated by three horizontal black lines. the domain II region peptides, DN57opt and DN81opt displayed IC50 values of 81 M and 366 M (mean sem) respectively. no inhibition of infection was observed with the fusion region peptide, DN80opt. both DN57opt and DN81opt showed improved inhibition of DENV-2. optimization peptides (B) DN57opt and corresponding scrambled peptide of identical composition were tested against DENV-2 in a focus forming unit reduction assay. toxicity Because toxicity could result in a decrease in focus formation, the inhibitory peptides and their scrambled versions were assessed for cellular toxicity. DN57opt and 1OAN1 cause changes to the surface of deNV-2 viral particles. control dengue virions exhibited the normal, nearly smooth outer surface typical of mature flaviviruses. truncated peptides were immobilized onto streptavidin biosensors. the association and dissociation of increasing concentrations of truncated E protein to peptides DN57opt and 1OAN1 was monitored. treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of (A) DN57opt and (B) 1OAN1 after DENV-2 has infected cells shows no significant inhibition. treatment with (C) DN57opt or (D) 1OAN1 after DENV-2 has bound to LLCMK-2 cells at 4\u00b0C for one hour inhibits infection. inhibition of viral entry was observed for both peptides when added to the virus after it was bound to target cells. both peptides showed evidence of ability to block virus:cell binding compared to control virus without peptide. a peptide derived from the domain II fusion sequence (DN80, corresponding to amino acids 96\u2013114 in the DENV-2 E protein) and two overlapping peptides derived from the domain II hinge region (DN81, corresponding to amino acids 205\u2013223 and 205\u2013232, respectively) these sequences generally had the best RAPDF scores (or \u201cpseudoenergies\u201d) for structural stability and binding. peptides that did not achieve 50% inhibition are noted with a dashed line. a 20 residue sliding window moved from the N to the C terminus of the DENV-2 strain S1 E protein (PDB ID 1OAN) in 10 residue acid increments. the calculated RAPDF scores of a sliding window of 20 amino acid peptide sequences are shown graphically by vertical black lines. four major high binding regions are predicted, from amino acids 31\u201370, 121\u2013160, 241\u2013270, and 341\u2013380, respectively. the locations of the other optimized peptides are indicated by three horizontal black lines. synthesized peptides were tested for antiviral activity against DENV-2 strain NG-C in a focus forming unit (FFU) reduction assay. de novo designed peptides, 1OAN1, 1OAN2, 1OAN3, and 1OAN4 were also tested for inhibitory activity. a scrambled version of 1OAN1 (1OAN1scr) did not inhibit DENV-2 infection at any concentration tested. both the DN57opt and 1OAN1 peptides were also capable of inhibiting 4,000 infectious units of virus. at 24 h post-exposure, DN57opt was found to be mildly toxic to cells at 40 M (one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's post hoc test, P = 0.0004, N = 18), so only inhibitory data using lower, nontoxic concentrations was considered. purified and concentrated virus was prepared with or without incubation with peptides. panels show (A) virus only, (B) virus incubated with DN57opt, (C) virus incubated with 1OAN1. biolayer interferometry was performed to examine binding of the peptides to purified, truncated DENV-2 E protein. 1.7104 s1, 1OAN1 kd = 1.61030.2103 s1. we have previously used this system to characterize binding affinities of several human monoclonal antibodies for DENV E proteins. DN57opt or 1OAN1 after DENV-2 has bound to cells at 4\u00b0C for one hour inhibits infection. treatment of cells with DN57opt and 1OAN1 after virus binding to cells but before entry inhibits DENV-2 infection. both peptides showed evidence of ability to block virus:cell binding compared to control virus without peptide. we have used computational methods to design multiple peptide inhibitors of the DENV E glycoprotein. out of seven peptides synthesized and tested, two peptides with high activity and one peptide with intermediate activity were identified. we built upon previous work targeting DENV fusion peptide and domain II hinge regions with naturally occurring E protein sequences from these regions [9] one of the resulting peptides was identified as having antiviral activity. this confirms the use of the sliding window RAPDF minimization approach for finding tightly binding protein ligands [23], [24] the DN57opt and 1OAN1 peptides were designed for optimized binding to the pre-fusion E structure. the peptides interact directly with DENV-2 E proteins and are entry inhibitors. despite difficulties with oral administration, peptides may make useful antiviral agents when targeted against viral envelope proteins. we have established the existence of multiple, distinct inhibitory peptides targeting the DENV E glycoprotein. applications of this strategy should also be possible for the generation and refinement of lead compounds for other viral envelope fusion proteins."}
