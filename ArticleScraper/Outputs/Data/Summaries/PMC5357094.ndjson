{"summary": "septic shock is a true emergency medical condition, defined as inadequate blood perfusion to the body's tissues. this situation causes an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply, and leads to serious damage. to measure the CVP, an invasive procedure should be performed to insert a central venous catheter (CVC) it is clear that these properties cannot be prepared in all EDs. if other less-invasive and routine parameters can estimate CVP, management of septic shock will be facilitated. gular vein and those with initial CVP more than 8 cmH2O excluded from study7. those with CVP less than 8 cmH2O considered eligible cases. fluid challenge test 8, 9 with infusion of 500 cc of normal saline 0.9% in about 1 h was performed. inserted in the internal jugular vein and those with initial CVP more than 8 cmH2O were excluded from the study7. those with CVP less than 8 cmH2O considered eligible cases. 93 patients with a diagnosis of septic shock were enrolled in this study. VBG parameters, SI, AG, and CVP before and after fluid administration. Variable before fluid administration The changes (SBP 117.99 30.00 120.76 28.78 1.81 15.76 DBP 67.28 18.96 72.25 17.94 5.04 16.76 MAP 85.26 22.04 89.34 21.27 3.81 15.90 PR 87.06 19.19 84.22 19.44 1.36 14.81 SI 0.79 0.30 0.82 0.74 0.02 0.17 pH 7.35 0. correlation of pH with CVP (A); Correlation of HCO3 with CVP (B); Correlation of AG with CVP (C); Correlation of AG with CVP (D). pH and AG showed significant negative correlation (r = 0.19 and 0.22 respectively; %95 CI) with CVP. Variable Patients CVP on vasopressor Patients CVP without vasopressor P r P r pH 0.003 0.40 0.94 0.006 HCO3 0.001 0.47 0.001 0.33 Base excess 0.39 0.05 0.20 0.11 Anion gap 0.29 0.11 0.001 0.35 CVP: central venous pressure. only the change in AG before and after fluid therapy had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.38; %95 CI) with C use of CVP implies insertion of a central venous line. it causes more than 90% of catheter related infections in hospitalized patients. some studies have doubted the efficacy of CVP as a consistent measure. some studies were conducted to find non-invasive or less invasive parameters that can significantly correlate with CVP. a study by Creuter et al. indicated that patients with septic shock showed lower O2 saturation compared to normal controls. the correlation between base deficit (BD) and shock index can serve as a tool to predict the outcome of shock. the presence of some confounding variables such as mechanical ventilation and vasopressor administration might have affected our study results. further research is needed before implementation of the results of this study."}
