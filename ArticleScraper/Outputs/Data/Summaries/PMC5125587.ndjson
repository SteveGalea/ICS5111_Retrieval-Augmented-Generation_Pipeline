{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is classified as a mosquito-borne arbovirus of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. the virus was first isolated from a blood sample of a monkey in 1947. in may 2015, the first case of ZIKV originating from the Americas was reported in Brazil. all amino acids, except methionine (Met) and tryptophane (Trp), are coded by more than one synonymous codon. the alternative synonymous codons do not occur equally; they instead follow a special codon usage pattern. the codon usage bias is regarded as a consequence of the balance between the mutation and translational selection.

Axis 1 has a significant role in shaping the ZIKV codon usage pattern. aromaticity and hydrophobicity are known to play a role in peptide self-assembly and protein aggregation rates. most of the strains isolated tended to cluster together in group III. most of the strains isolated from 2010 to 2016 clustered together in group III. most of the strains isolated from 2010 to 2016 clustered together in group III. most of the american strains isolated in recent years cluster with some Asian, Europe and Oceania strains. results show that 46 strains of ZIKV can be divided into two genera (I, II) and the strains isolated from the same geographic regions cluster together. the mean values of C3s (31.97%) and A3s (33.32%) are higher compared with those of G3s (31.87%) and U3s (24.95%) in ZIKV polyprotein-coding region. the G and A nucleotides are abundant with mean values of 29.16% and 27.50%. the average values of U and C nucleotide were 21.52% and 21.82%, respectively. this study on 46 ZIKV strains revealed that the codon usage bias in the polyprotein-coding region of ZIKV is low as the mean ENc value of ZIKV polyprotein-coding regions is 53.32 (>40) this result is analogous to those of previous studies, which found that some RNA viruses, such as hepatitis A virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, SARS-coronavirus, Newcastle disease virus, marburg virus, and swine fever virus sapiens Aedes aegypti Aedes albopictus Phe UUU 1.008 0.87 0.56 0.48 UUC 0.992 1.13 1.44 1.52 Leu UUA 0.330 0.39 0.35 0.23 UUG 1.323 0.73 1.34 1.11 CUU 0.801 0.73 0.67 0.49 CUC 1.000 1.21 0.81 0.87 CUA 0.659 0.40 0.54 0.57 CUG 1.892 2.53 2.28 2.73 47 of 59 synonymous codons between ZIKV and H. sapiens are equivalently selected. 40 or 30 of 59 synonymous codons between ZIKV and a. aegypti or A. albopictus, respectively, are similarly selected. the codon usage pattern of ZIKV is different from that of its insect hosts. compared with the codon usage pattern of A. aegypti or A. albopictus, the codon usage pattern of ZIKV is more similar to that of H. sapiens. the evolution of the flavivirus genome sequence involved in anti-host countermeasures may be faster than that of other flavivirus sequences. this may be one reason why the evolution of the flavivirus genome sequence involved in anti-host countermeasures may be faster than that of other flavivirus sequence [41] the dinucleotides UG and CA are over-represented (xy > 1.23) while UA and CG are markedly under-represented (xy 0.78). this data is consistent with previous study, which suggested that the dinucleotides UA and CG are under-represented in many sequence sets. 0.454 0.431 0.025 GA 1.049\u20131.159 1.123 0.018 GU 0.818\u20130.857 0.831 0.008 GC 0.990\u20130.992 0.931 0.013 GG 0.445\u20131.079 1.046 0.091 The relative abundance of dinucleotides has been shown to influence the codon usage in some RNA viruses. a correlation analysis was performed to determine the main trends in the codon usage variation and the distribution of each gene along the continuous axes. the first axis accounts for 72.93% of the total variation, and the second, third and fourth axes account for 8.99%, 6.33%, and 3.08%, respectively, of the total variation. a plot of values of the first axis (Axis 1) and the second axis (Axis 2) of each polyprotein-coding region of ZIKV in correspondence analysis. the first axis accounts for 72.93% of total variation. the second axis accounts for 8.99% of total variation. if a gene is subject to translational selection, it will lie considerably below the expected curve [46]. the resulting points lie considerably below the solid curve, implying that other factors, such as translational selection, also influence the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. a significant correlation between GC12 and GC3 values is regarded to indicate that the mutation pressure dominates over the translational selection pressure in shaping the codon usage bias. a correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between GC12 and GC3. there was no significant correlation observed between them. tAI values of 46 ZIKV strains range from 0.329 to 0.347, with an average value of 0.344 and a SD of 0.004. positive correlation between tAI and CAI values (r = 0.457, P0.01) in ZIKV highlights the importance of translational selection in the formation of synonymous codon usage pattern. Axis 1 has a significant role in shaping the ZIKV codon usage pattern. aromaticity and hydrophobicity are known to play a role in peptide self-assembly and protein aggregation rates. a plot of Axis 1 and Axis 2 was drawn according to the geographic distribution of the tested ZIKV strains. some strains isolated in Uganda clustered together with the strains isolated from Senegal, and were classified as group II. most of the strains isolated from 2010 to 2016 tended to cluster together in group III. previous studies showed that the dengue virus strains occurring in the same continental region are more closely related to one another. the geographic origin of the strains responsible for the ZIKV epidemics that occurred on Yap island in 2007 and in Cambodia in 2010 most likely originated in Southeast Asia [14]"}
