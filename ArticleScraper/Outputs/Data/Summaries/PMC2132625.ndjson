{"summary": "Materials and Methods Materials FCS was from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA); fumonisin B1 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); chromatography plates were from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); endoglycosidase H (endo H) from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6Cer), lipid standards, and PDMP were from cell culture cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5% (BHK-21) or 10% (Vero) FCS. cells were plated in 35-mm dishes the night before the experiment to be 90% confluent the next day. cells were seeded onto 6-cm plastic dishes 2 d before the experiment. cells were seeded in DME supplemented with 50 g/ml cycloheximide. cells were then triedpsinized and washed off the plate in 0.8 ml cold PBS. plates were dipped in 10% 4,5-diphenyloxazole in chloroform for visualization by fluorography. antibodies were obtained: monoclonal anti-Bip, Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada); monoclonal anti-giantin. polyclonal antibodies to IBV M and vesicular stomatitis virus were prepared. cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5% (BHK-21) or 10% (Vero) FCS. cells were plated in 35-mm dishes the night before the experiment. cells were infected for 30 min with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M. soluble short-chain analogues of ceramide were added to cells as a complex with 0.34 mg/ml defatted BSA. after treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the appropriate antibody. samples were run on 10 10 cm high performance thin-layer chromatography plates with a mobile phase of chloroform/glacial acetic acid. plates were dipped in 10% 4,5-diphenyloxazole in chloroform for visualization by fluorography. cells were plated in 35-mm dishes the night before the experiment. cells were infected for 30 min with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M. after treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the appropriate antibody. images were acquired using a microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) cells were triedpsinized and washed off the plate in 0.8 ml cold PBS. labeled samples were doped with 10 g cold ceramide. plates were sprayed with water to visualize ceramide bands. PDMP (100 M) inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into sphingolipids in BHK-21 cells by >90%. SM synthesis by 50% in BHK-21 cells. pathway for sphingolipid biosynthesis in mammalian cells is indicated. treatment of infected cells with lower concentrations of PDMP had no effect on IBV M localization and very little effect on SM synthesis. cells were infected as before and treated for 1 h with cycloheximide. then cells were treated with PDMP for varying lengths of time up to 1 h. redistribution was first observed at 15 min and became maximal at 60 min. after 1 h in PDMP, the remaining dishes were washed three times with 1 ml DME with serum and incubated with cycloheximide-containing medium for the indicated time. for each experimental series, the Nomarski image is shown on the left and the fluorescence image on the right. PDMP induced the redistribution of the endogenous IC protein, ERGIC-53, to the ER. vero cells were incubated with cycloheximide for 1 h and then incubated for 1 h in the presence either 1% isopropanol (control) or 100 M PDMP. PDMP slows the rate of both anterograde vesicular traffic and endocytosis in CHO cells. a pulse\u2013chase experiment was performed either in the presence or absence of PDMP, CA, or FB1. pretreatment with either CA or FB1 partially corrected the PDMP effect. the decreased rate with PDMP was not due to a block in the ongoing synthesis of sphingolipids. PDMP inhibits the conversion of ceramide into glycosphingolipids. class 1 was the most commonly seen pattern in untreated cells, i.e., tight juxta-nuclear staining that colocalized with ER markers. class 3 was the most commonly seen pattern in PDMP-treated cells, i.e., diffuse staining with prominent nuclear envelope staining that colocalized with ER markers. PDMP increased the levels of ceramide 2.5-fold over control levels. pretreatment with CA reduced PDMP-induced ceramide accumulation to roughly half of control levels. this level was still threefold higher than cells treated with CA alone. cells were incubated with 50 g/ml cycloheximide and, if indicated, 5 mM CA. after 1 h, media was replaced with medium containing cycloheximide. cells were trypsinized to remove them from the dish. exogenous C6Cer did not redistribute IBV M or ERGIC-53. two other soluble analogues of ceramide, C2Cer and C8Cer, were also tested and found to have no effect on the localization of IBV M. both CA (5 mM) and FB1 (100 M) inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into sphingolipids in BHK-21 cells by >90%. PDMP (100 M) inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into sphingolipids in BHK-21 cells by >90%. PDMP-treated cells showed a marked change in the staining pattern of the IBV M protein after 1 h. treatment of infected cells with lower concentrations of PDMP had no effect on IBV M localization and very little effect on SM synthesis. redistribution was first observed at 15 min and became maximal at 60 min. cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M were treated 4 h after infection with 50 g/ml cycloheximide for 1 h. PDMP (100 M) was added, and dishes were fixed at the indicated times. after 1 h in PDMP, the remaining dishes were washed three times with 1 ml DME with serum. BHK-21 cells were incubated for 1 h with cycloheximide and then incubated for 1 h in medium with 1% isopropanol (control) or 100 M PDMP. cells were then fixed and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies to Man II, giantin, or -COP and Texas red secondary antibodies. PDMP slows the rate of both anterograde vesicular traffic and endocytosis in CHO cells. a pulse\u2013chase experiment was performed either in the presence or absence of PDMP, CA, or FB1. PDMP, but not CA or FB1, slowed arrival of VSV G at medial-Golgi by 2.5-fold. pretreatment with either CA or FB1 partially corrected the PDMP effect. pretreatment with either CA or FB1 reduced the PDMP-induced mislocalization of IBV M protein. the localization of IBV M was classified into one of three staining patterns. class 1 was the most commonly seen pattern in untreated cells, i.e., diffuse staining with prominent nuclear envelope staining that colocalized with ER markers. FB1 on PDMP-induced redistribution of IBV M. cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described in Fig. 2. at 5 h after infection, cells were treated with 1% isopropanol (control) or 100 M PDMP. 1 h later the cells were fixed and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence. treatment with PDMP increased the level of newly synthesized ceramide by 2.5-fold. cells were incubated with 50 g/ml cycloheximide and, if indicated, 5 mM CA. after 1 h, media was replaced with medium containing cycloheximide. after 1 h, cells were trypsinized to remove them from the dish. we first asked whether C6Cer slowed anterograde traffic in CHO cells. a pulse\u2013chase labeling experiment with VSV-infected cells was performed. cells chased in the absence or presence of 25 M C6Cer. we propose two models to explain the redistribution of IBV M protein induced by PDMP. the simplest model is that the M protein normally cycles between the ER and the Golgi at a significant rate. PDMP disrupts retention of the protein, which then cycles back to the ER by normal retrieval mechanisms. evidence shows that IBV M can be induced to redistribute to the ER. evidence shows that IBV M has information necessary for traffic to the ER. PDMP may act by disrupting the retention of IBV M. our results with PDMP treatment suggest that cycling of these proteins does not occur during the time scale of our experiments. it has been shown that myriocin reduces the rate of transport of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein but not other proteins out of the ER in yeast. glucosylceramide analogue PDMP causes redistribution of IBV M to ER. it is likely that PDMP exerts its effects by causing the accumulation of ceramide. ceramide accumulation is only one of the ways that PDMP exerts its effects. ceramide can be made back into sphingolipids because the enzymes SM and GlcCer synthases are inhibited in presence of PDMP. soluble analogues of ceramide mimic the effects of PDMP. some short chain analogues of ceramide do not have the same effects as endogenous ceramide. effects of ceramide are limited to the bilayers in which its concentration increases. effects of ceramide are limited to the bilayers in which its concentration increases. preliminary experiments suggest that okadaic acid does not block the PDMP-induced changes. ceramide could be activating a protein kinase but this kinase has not been fully characterized. we propose two models to explain the redistribution of IBV M protein induced by PDMP. the slowing of anterograde traffic would cause the protein to shift its steady-state distribution to the ER. a second possibility is that PDMP disrupts retention of the M protein. PDMP may act by disrupting the retention of IBV M. it is also possible that redistribution of IBV M requires both effects. PDMP-induced ER redistribution was also observed for ERGIC-53. our results with PDMP suggest that cycling of these proteins does not occur during the time scale of our experiments. it has been shown that myriocin, an inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis thought to inhibit the same step as CA, reduces the rate of transport of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein but not other proteins out of the ER in yeast. ceramide accumulation is only one of the ways that PDMP exerts its effects. other groups have found that the various effects of PDMP were concomitant with. ceramide accumulation is only one of the ways that PDMP exerts its effects. soluble analogues of ceramide mimic effects of PDMP. soluble analogues of ceramide also had no effect on localization. the rate of movement of VSV G through the late Golgi was slowed to a much greater extent by C6Cer than by PDMP. it is not yet clear how ceramide induces changes in anterograde traffic and protein localization. ceramide within the lipid bilayer directly affects the localization of IBV M. the first transmembrane domain of IBV M can target chimeras to the CGN. it is possible that CGN bilayers have distinct lipid domains."}
