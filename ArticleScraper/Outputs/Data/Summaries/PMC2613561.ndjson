{"summary": "influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year, and pandemic episodes kill millions of people. influenza pneumonia annually causes more than 40,000 deaths in the united states alone. avian influenza have accounted for as many as 50 million deaths worldwide. increased globalization suggests eventual human-to-human transmission of avian influenza may cause even greater lethality than the infamous \u201cSpanish flu\u201d [7]. viral pathogens, including influenza, are considered potential agents of bioterror [8]. mice challenged by aerosol with influenza A/H3N2 (H3N2) universally succumbed to hemorrhagic pneumonia unless pretreated with aerosolized NTHi lysate. this treatment reduced mortality >90% if delivered on the day prior to infection, >50% if delivered 3 days prior to infection. mortality occurred within 10 days of the viral inoculation, and observation for 21 days after infection showed no subsequent mortality. protection against influenza A is associated with lung-restricted inflammation. single or repeated treatment with NTHi lysate induces dramatic inflammation in the lungs, measured by cytokine levels and cellular influx. lysate acutely induces 8-fold more IL-6 and almost 40-fold more TNF than infection alone. by day 3 after treatment, the NTHi lysate-induced rise in cytokines in uninfected mice has entirely resolved. this suggests that a robust early inflammatory reaction may allow for more rapid resolution of the infection-induced inflammation. pathway analysis revealed interferon signaling to be among the most upregulated events following NTHi lysate treatment. interferon signaling pathway transcripts are reported in Table 1 showing that treatment induces expression of numerous transcripts critical for both type I (interferon-/) and type II (interferon-) signaling. s 3 3.08 4.21 NM_010501.1 Ifitm1 Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 2.66 2.59 NM_026820.2 Ifitm2 Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 1.75 1.36 NM_030694 Ifitm3 Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 1.70 1.34 NM_025378.1 Ifitm5 Interferon-induced induced transmembrane protein 5 1.5 interferon gamma receptor 1 1.03 0.69 NM_010511.1 Ifngr2 Interferon gamma receptor 2 4.67 2.96 NM_008338.2 Ifrd1 Interferon-related developmental regulator 1 7.09 11.35 NM_013562 Ifrd2 Interferon-related developmental regulator 2 0.85 1.05 NM_025903.1 Ifrg15 Interferon alpha responsive gene 1.158 1.34 NM_022329.2 I resistance 1 8.02 16.69 NM_010846 Oas1g 2\u20135 oligoadenylate synthetase 1G 2.47 3.00 NM_011852.2 Prkrir Protein kinase interferon-inducible double stranded RNA dependent repressor of (P58 repressor) 1.17 0.94 NM_028410.1 Psmb8 Proteosome (prosome macropain) subunit beta type mice were challenged with influenza in three different conditions. no lysate treatment, a single lysate treatment, or repetitive lysate treatment. observation for 21 days after the challenge showed no subsequent mortality. suspension of ribavirin in a single dose of NTHi lysate on day 1 improved survival significantly more than NTHi lysate alone. an additional NTHi lysate treatment on day 2 almost completely protected from mortality. observations through day 21 showed no subsequent mortality. mortality occurred within 10 days of the viral inoculation. observation for 21 days after infection showed no subsequent mortality. aerosolized lysate protects against hemorrhagic influenza virus pneumonia. inflammatory cytokine levels were determined in mice treated with NTHi lysate once, every third day for 6 days, or not at all. ELISA was performed on BAL fluid obtained 4 h after the final treatment. inflammatory cytokines were measured 3 days after influenza A infection. interferon signaling is essential to baseline host antiviral resistance in the lungs. fulminant influenza infections observed in untreated mice actually induce 4-fold higher levels of interferon than the NTHi lysate treatment.
