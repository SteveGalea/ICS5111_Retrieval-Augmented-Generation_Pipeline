{"summary": "the revised international health regulations has expanded traditional infectious disease notification to include surveillance for public health events of potential international importance. there are no clearly established guidelines for how countries should conduct this surveillance, which types of emerging disease syndromes should be reported, nor any means for enforcement. syndromic surveillance is meant to enhance rather than replace traditional surveillance. in many developing countries, surveillance is limited due to lack of a robust public health or laboratory infrastructure. syndromic surveillance, just as in the developed world, can augment traditional surveillance in developing countries. the revised IHR mandated reporting of only three diseases to the WHO. the revised IHR address the need for strengthening disease surveillance by modifying disease lists. the revised IHR address the need for strengthening of disease surveillance by modifying disease lists. recommended syndromes for surveillance include hemorrhagic fever, acute respiratory syndrome, acute gastrointestinal syndrome, neurological syndrome, and a provision for severe infectious illness. implementation of the syndromic approach complements the disease-specific approach with a precise definition for each syndrome. syndromic surveillance systems detect general febrile illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever, other vector-borne diseases, and foodborne illness. collaboration between countries with experience in syndromic surveillance has resulted in the introduction of syndromic surveillance to those countries. alerta, developed by Voxiva, the Peruvian Navy, and NMRCD, monitors all nationally notifiable diseases and syndromes, as well as other diseases of particular importance to the Peruvian Navy. the system monitors all nationally notifiable diseases and syndromes, as well as other diseases of particular importance to the Peruvian Navy. the use of comparative statistics in surveillance is a novel method for evaluation of the performance of malaria early warning systems. in 2002, the Uganda Ministry of Health piloted a new district level monitoring system in the southwestern highlands. dengue dengue surveillance is typically conducted by the passive notification of suspected or confirmed Dengue Fever cases and deaths. these passive systems have low specificity due to infrequent laboratory confirmation but are still useful due to their simplicity and low use of resources. waiting for reporting by clinicians may lead to delays in public health action. data is collected in real-time by a medical provider seeing a patient. data is then recorded on the available platform (PDA or a computer) syndromic surveillance data is converted to a weekly format and reported to health authorities weekly in cases of normal operation. syndromic surveillance provides the earliest opportunity to avert or contain dengue epidemics, but many dengue-endemic countries lack resources for launching these programs. a surveillance system developed in the Netherlands for early detection of WNV focuses on cases presenting with neurologic diseases. the goal of this system is to detect winter and summer spikes in influenza-like illness, respiratory syndrome, and gastrointestinal illness. syndromic surveillance for foodborne illness is important given the globalization of the food supply and the morbidity caused by diarrhea. in the Pacific region, there are four distinct levels of foodborne disease surveillance. no formal surveillance, syndromic surveillance, laboratory or pathogen-specific methods, and integrated food chain surveillance. a regional approach under the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network would include development of uniform case definitions for reporting as the basis for syndromic surveillance. the WHO strategy aims to decrease the cost of testing and improve treatment practices. the plan mandates knowledge of the prevalence of specific agents and their susceptibilities. the prevalence of STIs such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia has decreased. the revised IHR address the need for strengthening disease surveillance by modifying disease lists to include syndromes for diseases of epidemic potential. the IHR now include reporting by all countries for poliomyelitis, smallpox, human influenza caused by a new subtype, SARS, cholera, plague, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, west Nile virus [WNV], and other diseases of regional concern. syndromic surveillance may not be effective in the timely detection of emerging diseases. many countries have already implemented surveillance systems to comply with the revised IHR. many countries have already implemented surveillance systems to comply with the revised IHR, including surveillance for severe diarrhea, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. the questionnaire is filled out on a computer terminal with EWORS software. the data files are sent by email to the EWORS hub in the Ministry of Health. the hub also sends a monthly report to each participating site summarizing their surveillance data. alerta has identified over 31 disease outbreaks [15,16] and has facilitated investigation of diarrheal disease, malaria, and influenza. alerta has facilitated investigation of diarrheal disease, malaria, and influenza as well as detected an outbreak of cyclosporiasis at a naval base in Lima, Peru. one limitation of EWORS has been the challenges with linking suspected outbreaks to response actions. a second limitation is challenges with standardization of procedures at hubs. alerta monitors all nationally notifiable diseases and syndromes, as well as other diseases of particular importance to the Peruvian Navy. weekly malaria cases collected from health centers in 10 districts were reviewed. the curve demonstrated potentially prevented disease cases versus the number of alerts over a decade. syndromic surveillance can be basic while still providing useful information. similar dissemination websites could be employed in low to medium resource countries for malaria and other vector-borne diseases where remote Internet access is available. active fever surveillance is typically conducted by the passive notification of suspected or confirmed Dengue Fever (DF) or dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) cases and deaths. the system was expanded to include 25 civilian health centers that provide surveillance on sanitary conditions. before 2006, the only data available for dengue surveillance in french Guiana was laboratory confirmed cases. data on all cases of fever, suspected and confirmed cases of dengue fever and confirmed cases of malaria by syndromic surveillance syndrome definitions are employed. 900 suspected dengue cases compared to 800 laboratory-confirmed cases in 2006. limitations included incomplete report forms and dengue fever reporting being 67% higher than with traditional reports. despite its sensitivity, there has been some concern with using a febrile syndrome for dengue surveillance. many climate-based systems are not widely used due to lack of published models outside testing areas. modeling of these data sets may be useful for selected syndromes in low resource regions. monitoring of both climate triggers and vector-borne disease indicators together may increase sensitivity and specificity. completeness of syndromic surveillance reports collected via the web-based forum has been found to be as effective as similar reports from phone calls to the health department. syndromic surveillance may be useful in areas with medium resources and good communications infrastructure. in the Pacific region, there are four distinct levels of foodborne disease surveillance. this type of model could be a good model for a climate-based early warning system for cholera in this region [47] the WHO recommends a global health sector strategy as part of a multisectoral approach to responding to epidemics of STIs. the burden of public health surveillance in under-resourced and understaffed settings is a challenge. the burden of public health surveillance in under-resourced and understaffed settings is a challenge. increased use of automated reporting may decrease the burden on health care and public health workers. examples of Syndromic

component analysis/n syndromic surveillance can provide useful early warning of diseases such as malaria, but there are no guidelines for what to do with the information provided. it is still necessary to have a robust public health infrastructure for investigation of cases and implementation of an effective control program. novel applications for syndromic surveillance are enhancing traditional surveillance. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors read and approved the final manuscript Pre-publication history."}
