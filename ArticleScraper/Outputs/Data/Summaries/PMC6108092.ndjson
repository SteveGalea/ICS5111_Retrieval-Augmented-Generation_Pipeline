{"summary": "the INHAND Project is a joint initiative between the Societies of toxicologic pathology from Europe (ESTP), Great Britain (BSTP), Japan (JSTP) and North America (STP) to develop an internationally accepted nomenclature for nonproliferative and proliferative lesions in laboratory animals. the nomenclature presented in this document is also available electronically at the goreni website (www.goreni.org). the perfect eye section for a routine rodent toxicity study is a superior-inferior sagittal section, passing through the optic nerve head, with proper orientation and free of artifacts. corneal endothelial cells should not be vacuolated, and the lens should be correctly oriented in the globe, with the epithelium facing the cornea. pathologists should be involved in determining the best protocol for a particular study. Davidson\u2019s solution gives better retinal fixation than 10% formalin. but prolonged exposure will result in artifacts associated with hardening of lens. a small section should be collected for fixation in 10% formalin. possible artifacts include fissuring of the lens, clefting of the cornea, and vacuolation of photoreceptors. mouse eyes are best processed intact, but it is helpful to mark the globe with indelible tissue dye. specialized hairs and associated sebaceous glands have secretion pores along the inner margin of the eyelid. the third eyelid is located in the nasal aspect of the palpebral fissure and consists of fibrous stroma supported by hyaline cartilage covered by conjunctiva. the limbus contains populations of fibroblasts, monocytes and Langerhans cells. the stroma of the limbus is loose and contains a highly vascularized episcleral arterial circle. the rodent cornea is thicker in the central portion, and thinner in the periphery. reflectometer of the mouse (Balb/c) and rat (Wistar) were approximately 106 and 159 m, respectively. in rodents, the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% of the total corneal thickness. epithelium of the rodent cornea undergoes post-natal development and cell differentiation. superficial squamous cells have microvilli that function to increase the cell surface and promote tear adherence. the basal cells are anchored to a thin basal lamina, or basement membrane, by hemidesmosomes (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002a; Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b) keratocytes contain crystalline proteins that reduce light scattering. the curvature is maintained by an annulus of collagen fibers that circumferentially align the limbus. posterior aspect of the stroma is bordered by Descemet\u2019s membrane. uvea & Iridocorneal angle The highly vascularized ocular tissues are collectively referred to as the uvea. the posterior uvea consists of the choroid, and the anterior uvea, the iris and ciliary body. the iris extends centrally to form a circumferential diaphragm in front of the lens. the blood-retinal barrier is composed of non-fenestrated capillaries of the retinal circulation (inner blood-retinal barrier) and tight-junctions between retinal epithelial cells (outer blood-retinal barrier) preventing passage of large molecules from the choriocapillaris into the retina. the iris originates from the anterior portion of the ciliary body. the color of the iris is attributed to type and density of melanin pigment, degree of vascularization, and backscatter of incident light from stromal collagen fibers. the color of the iris is attributed to type and density of melanin pigment, degree of vascularization, and backscatter of incident light from stromal collagen fibers. the ciliary processes are the site of aqueous humor production, derived from the epithelium and vasculature of the ciliary body. aqueous humor is secreted into the posterior ocular chamber and circulates through the pupil into the anterior ocular chamber. the epithelium of the ciliary processes also secretes hyaluronic acid. trabecular meshwork (TM) is located within the sinus, posterior to the pectinate ligaments. it is composed of crisscrossing cords or sheets of collagen and elastin. the TM surface is covered by a unique population of endothelial-like trabecular cells. aqueous humor exits the JCM and flows into collecting ducts. inner leaf of the ciliary body is fibrous and extends from the root of the iris to the ora ciliaris retina. the sinus contains 1-2 rows of short, fine pectinate ligaments, and 2-3 layers of trabeculae. the blood supply to the ciliary body is derived from the two long posterior ciliary arteries. the external choroid is comprised predominantly of a venous plexus. mid-sized anastomosing vessels and melanocytes reside within a pigmented reticular connective tissue mesh located between the venous plexus and the choriocapillaris. this tissue has a role in absorption of excess radiation. cell proliferation is restricted to progenitor epithelial cells located in the germinative layer above the lens equator (nuclear bow) cells migrate posterior to the equator, where they differentiate into fiber cells. as the cells differentiate, they undergo bi-directional elongation. most of the soluble protein present in the vitreous is derived from plasma. albumin and immunoglobulins represent 80% of the protein content of the vitreous. a generalized presentation of the vitreous is provided and pertains to all species. the cortical vitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary vitreous) the cortical vitreous is relatively more condensed and fibrillar compared to the medullary vitreous. the cortical vitreous represents only 2% of the total vitreous volume. the anterior vitreous cortex is in contact with the ciliary processes and the lens zonules, as well as the posterior lens capsule. the vitreous attaches to the lens capsule in a ring-like manner, forming the ligament of Wieger (Sebag 1992). hyalocytes are phagocytic cells that vary from oval to spindle shape, possess lysosomes, mitochondria, ribosomes, and micro-pinocytotic vesicles. hyalocytes play a crucial role in the formation and contraction of proliferative membranes (vitreous fibroplasia; vitreous membranes) hyalocytes express cell surface antigens characteristic of monocyte/macrophage leukocyte lineage including CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), CD64 (Fc receptor I), CD11a (leukocyte-function antigen-1) and histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens. anterior cavity-associated immune deviation (ACAID) has been attributed to F4/80 antigen presenting cells residing in the iris and ciliary the rodent retina takes up about 175o of circumference of the globe. it is structurally divided into nine distinct layers. the nuclei of the photoreceptors reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) diurnal rodents have a relatively high concentration of cones (30\u201340%) cones are sparse in nocturnal rodents. some mice have a preponderance of blue cones in the ventral retina. horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and interplexiform cells reside in the inner nuclear layer. bipolar cells receive synaptic input from either rods (rod bipolars) or cones (cone bipolars) and transmit signals to ganglion cells. horizontal cells are less frequent and often lie in the outer part of the INL. Ganglion cell nuclei and perikarya reside near the inner surface of the retina forming the ganglion cell layer. ganglion cells are third order neurons that receive integrated visual signal from second order neurons. axons from the ganglion cells form the optic nerve. ganglion cell axons and axon bundles are surrounded by astrocytes at the surface of the optic disc. as the nerve passes through the scleral canal it crosses an open meshwork of collagenous beams or plates continuous with the sclera. this connective tissue meshwork also contains elastin and lends support for the nerve tissue. rodent retinal vasculature has a holangiotic pattern (fully vascularized) the ophthalmic artery enters the eye through the optic nerve and divides into several branches that service the entire retina. the choroid blood system posterior to the retina supplies the outer retina (particularly the photoreceptors) through diffusion. pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. the cells originate from different portions of the optic vesicle during embryonic development. they are attached by an extracellular matrix specialized to enable interaction between the retina and POS. transcellular movement of glucose, retinol, amino acids and other nutrients into the retina is regulated by receptors, ion channels and exchangers, and cytoplasmic organelles. the regulated movement of ions through the cell and IPM creates ionic gradients that maintain photoreceptor excitability and permits electrical transmission of light stimulus. in most mammalian species, RPE contain melanosomes, elliptical-shaped granules of melanin binding can unintentionally result in drug sequestration, prolonged drug exposure to sensitive ocular tissues, enhance free-radical injury. melanolipofuscin accumulation impairs light absorption, enhances oxidative stress, and results in RPE degeneration. cellular transdifferentiation, migration, and proliferation of RPE are associated with the production of sub-retinal fibroplasia (membranes) observed in macular degeneration. the Tenon capsule forms a sleeve around the attachment of the ocular muscles to the sclera. the sub-Tenon space is a site that can be potentially exploited in some species for drug administration. the rat does have a Tenon, but in the mouse it is poorly defined. single-cell necrosis is differentiated from apoptosis by the combination of cell and nuclear swelling, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, minimal nuclear pyknosis, loss of cellular detail, cellular debris, and inflammation. a diagnosis of apoptosis/single cell necrosis may be appropriate if there is no need to separate individual diagnoses. fibroblastic membranes resemble the fibrotic process that occurs in wound healing. membranes can form under the retina, on the surface of the retina, and within the vitreous or aqueous humor. contraction can place tension on attached structures, resulting in possible retinal detachments. fibroblastic membranes associated with cellular transformation can contain mature collagen and appear quiescent, rather than active, on histopathology. fibroblastic membranes associated with cellular transformation due to spontaneous disease or inflammation can contain mature collagen. Inflammation (N) Eye Species Mouse; Rat. Other Term(s) Used Varies with tissue type. Pathogenesis/cell of origin Leukocytes recruited from the systemic circulation. mitosis can also be observed in the endothelial cells of the vasculature, epithelial cells of the uvea, and occasionally in cells within the retina. other Term(s) Used None Diagnostic Features Often contiguous cells. Cell and organelle swelling. Pyknosis (nuclear condensation; minor component) Karyorrhexis (nuclear fragmentation); Karyolysis (degradation of nuclear material); Cytoplasmic new blood vessels have poorly formed or inadequate tight junctions. vessels produced under these conditions do not have adequate tight junctions. veGF antagonists have proven to be efficacious in clinical use. Differential Diagnosis Inflammation Leukocyte infiltrates without other indications of inflammation. Comment Infiltrates are not uncommon at the eyelid dermal or conjunctival margins. infiltrates may also be associated with adnexa in the dermis. diagnostic Features Irregularly shaped tubules or acini with dilated or reduced lumina. Lined by cuboidal or flattened epithelium. Loss of normal vacuolated cytoplasmic appearance. comment Modifiers are recommended in relation to the predominant inflammatory cellular type (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) a specific change observed on spectral microscopy for the corneal endothelium should not be used in place of atrophy for the cornea. pathogenesis/cell of origin Corneal or conjunctival epithelial cell; may be drug-induced or incidental. attenuation and generalized loss of corneal endothelial cells are best observed on clinical examination using spectral microscopy. attenuation is commonly observed on the peripheral margins of the cornea. proteinaceous fluid undermines the epithelium and expands all layers of the cornea. the surface of the cornea is covered by a layer of keratin (keratinization), and the stroma contains the profiles of numerous congested blood vessels (neovascularization). corneal edema occurs due to insufficient endothelial pumping mechanisms. corneal edema occurs due to insufficient endothelial pumping mechanisms. corneal mineralization may be associated with inflammation, edema and neovascularization. mineralization is most often observed in aged rats. corneal fibroplasia is more likely to occur when there is loss of enough cells to the point that the endothelium cannot respond adequately to cover a defect. comment Keratocytes are activated following corneal injury and may proliferate to fill in wound gaps. Descemet\u2019s membrane is expanded by an eosinophilic matrix (arrows) the adjacent corneal endothelium contains multiple layers of prominent endothelial cells. an aggregate of neutrophils undermines an atrophic epithelium. Differential Diagnosis Inflammation Infiltrates of lymphocytes associated with inflammatory features such as edema, hemorrhage and necrosis. Comment Infiltrates of lymphocytes, sometimes with lymphoid follicle formation, are normally present in the conjunctiva. inflammation of the conjunctiva or cornea is associated with submucosal or stromal edema respectively. inflammation of the conjunctiva or cornea is associated with submucosal or stromal edema. subepithelial mineralization occurs in subepithelial region or in anterior stroma. may be associated with epithelial necrosis, foreign body reaction and scarring. blood vessels originate from extension/proliferation of endothelial cells from the limbal vessels into the peripheral margins of the corneal stroma. may be associated with corneal stromal edema and inflammation as well as conjunctival congestion. Pigment may be endogenous (e.g. melanin), occur from hemorrhage (hemosiderin, hemoglobin), or derive from exogenous sources (e.g.foreign body) increased pigmentation associated with an increase in melanin granules can occur with chronic irritation or trauma. phospholipidosis causes lipid-like vacuoles in corneal epithelial cells and keratocytes; bluish granules may be observed on H&E staining. cationic amphiphilic drugs can cause phospholipidosis of the corneal epithelium and/or corneal endothelium. pathogenesis/cell of origin Malformation occurs from a failure in development of the spaces forming the trabecular meshwork. Diagnostic Features Disorganization or complete absence of the structures of the drainage angle and/or trabecular meshwork. glaucoma is more commonly observed spontaneously in larger species. the trabecular meshwork is scant in rodents and spontaneous collapse apparently is rare. iridal-cornea adhesion can block the outflow of aqueous humor. ocytes are not found in the anterior chamber without inflammation in some other part of the eye, e.g. the cornea, uvea, or vitreous. on occasion an increase in protein may be observed in the eye without other indications of inflammation. Iris is displaced posterior and attached to the anterior lens capsule. lens fibers subjacent to the anterior lens capsule are basophilic and fragmented, characteristic of mineralization. Differential Diagnosis Artifact Artifacts associated with tissue processing can result in displacement of the iris. pigment on the anterior lens capsule or corneal endothelium may also occur as an artifact of processing. hypoplasia of the ciliary body is associated with anatomical defects in the iris. iris contains scant stroma and has a narrow-curved profile on cross section. malformations can appear as irregular expansions of the stroma. Persistent pupillary membrane (N) Uvea: Iris and Ciliary Body Species Mouse; Rat. Pathogenesis/cell of origin Vessels and mesenchyme of pupillary membrane. Iris stroma may appear irregular in size or shape circumferentially on cross section. Irregular contours may suggest the presence of spatial defects within the stroma. Iritis is a clinical term associated with vascular congestion observed on ophthalmoscopy irrespective of the presence of inflammation. the stroma of the iris is expanded by a neutrophilic infiltrate. other Term(s) Used None Pathogenesis/cell of origin Leukocytes enter the eye via the uveal vessels of the ciliary body or processed, and iris stroma and/or epithelium. inflammatory features such as expansion of the stroma, hemorrhage and/or necrosis are present. decreased pigmentation may be associated with inflammation, edema, and aging. increased pigment deposition occurs in mice homozygous for iris pigment dispersion or iris stromal atrophy. Cystine crystal accumulation has been reported in the ciliary body stroma and process epithelium of CTNS -/- mice, an animal model for cystinosis lysosomal storage disease. a focal area of epithelial cell proliferation subjacent to the anterior lens capsule is depicted in the higher magnification image on the right. degeneration is a diagnostic term that encompasses many of the specific terms listed below. it is important to recognize artifact lens fiber fragmentation due to fixation, which is often angular. 'degeneration' may be used as an aggregate diagnostic term to include many of the nonspecific changes observed in the lens fibers. in advanced disease the cortical fibers are completely liquefied and lost and the nucleus of the lens is free floating in the lens capsule. cataract is a clinical diagnostic term used to describe opacities visualized on ophthalmic examination. Fibroplasia often occurs in association with hyperplasia of the anterior lenticular epithelium. pathogenesis/cell of origin Injury to the lens and subsequent cellular transdifferentiation of the anterior lenticular epithelium. the anterior lens capsule will continue to thicken with age in the animal, while the posterior lens capsule does not. Pathogenesis/cell of origin Injury to the anterior lenticular epithelium. Diagnostic Features Enlarged or swollen cell profile. often associated with adjacent swollen, pale lens fiber. glucose is converted to sorbitol, which does not readily diffuse out of the lens fiber. degeneration may be irreversible with agents that are not metabolized by the lens fiber. pathogenesis/cell of origin Leukocyte infiltrates (neutrophilic and/or granulomatous) within the lens. epithelium (N) Lens Species Mouse; Rat.

Deposition of calcium salts within the vitreous. Diagnostic Features Irregular deposits of mineral; may be located anywhere within the vitreous. nuclei polarized away from the center or \u201clumen\u201d of the rosette. eosinophilic linear structures resembling photoreceptors inner segments and/or ciliated cells from primitive neuroepithelial origin may be observed in the inner layer of the rosette. more severe folds affect all retinal layers and can exhibit with subretinal hemorrhage and debris from the photoreceptor outer segments. True retinal folds are differentiated from artifact by an association with preretinal traction membranes, sub-retinal deposits, hemorrhage. outer nuclear layer depicts atrophy, and is associated with loss of adjacent RPE (between arrows) atrophy involving all layers, with multifocal remnants of outer nuclear layer neuronal bodies remaining (arrows) retinal ganglion cells are target of several known retinal toxicants. toxicants preferentially target the cells in the inner nuclear layer. atrophy may be incidental following choroidal circular disturbance. g. nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors. genetic forms of atrophy occur in several strains of mice. senile retinal degeneration is characteristic of senile retinal degeneration. iatrogenic (e.g. laser treatment, subretinal injection) finding must be differentiated from treatment-related toxic effects. iatrogenic (e.g. laser treatment, subretinal injection) finding. displacement, photoreceptor nuclei, retina; hypertrophy, RPE; mouse. pyknotic photoreceptor nuclei located external to the retinal outer limiting membrane. nonpyknotic and pyknotic nuclei may be found in control eyes. but also in areas of retinal degeneration or inflammation. GFAP can be useful to highlight the presence of glial cell. idiopathic epiretinal membranes are characterized by the growth of fibrocellular tissue on the internal limiting membrane (ILM) iERM can range from subtle cellophane-like films without visual consequences to markedly contractile membranes that can cause metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity. cells with elongated nuclei, fibrillar eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct membranes are immunohistochemically positive for GFAP. comment Retinal gliosis is seen in rats as a focal lesion localized in the peripapillary retina. pathogenesis/cell of origin Inflammation may occur from immune-mediated etiologies, infectious agents, trauma, be drug-induced, or experimentally induced. can be associated with retinal degeneration and glial cell proliferation (gliosis) special techniques for diagnostics Von Kossa stain for calcium may be useful in paraffin sections. nonacidic fixatives such as neutral buffered 10% formalin or alcohol are best for tissues containing calcium deposits. mineralization can be an incidental lesion. ganglion cells with hypereosinophilic cytoplasm in paraffin sections. swollen cells, cytoplasmic vacuoles, or cytoplasmic blebs. swollen cells appear bright green against dark field. neuronal necrosis is a common end-stage cellular response to irreversible injury. it may be induced by many causes, but most common are metabolic dysfunction, ischemia, or toxicant exposure. neuronal necrosis in the retina refers to the pathway by which disruption of cellular energy systems results in fluid accumulation within organelles. special techniques for diagnostics Lipofuscin granules may be detected using several special stains. pink using PAS, pale red to red by Oil Red O, dark blue to purple by LFB, and pale blue to blue by Schmorl\u2019s technique for melanin. vacuolation of retinal neuropil (extracellular edema) can be observed in multiple degenerative processes and represent reorganization of the retinal parenchyma. retinoschisis is splitting of the retina between layers to form large spaces and may occur with extensive retinal edema. Vascular Changes Arteriolar loop, pre-retinal (N) Retina, may occur with extensive retinal edema. Special Techniques for Diagnostics Special stains for iron accumulation can be used to identify hemosiderin in old sites of hemorrhage. Retinal hemorrhages can occur in a variety of primary clotting disorders, thrombocytopenia of any cause, retinal hypertension, inflammatory retinal conditions, ocular trauma, or from compression to the animal during handling. ovascularization is differentiated from CNV by vascular profiles that extend from the IPL and INL into the outer retinal layers. Neovascular profiles can also contact the RPE cells and colonize the subretinal space similar to CNV. retinal neovascularization suggests retinal origin of the vessels. subretinal, retinal and vitreal hemorrhages can cause retinal detachment. neovascular proliferation can be a feature of chronic light induced retinopathy. ganglion cell loss, optic neuritis, or hypoxia/ischemia. degeneration occurs in several circumstances in the optic nerve. ganglion cell loss, ganglion cell loss, optic neuritis. lesions in the orbital or intracranial portions of the optic nerve can cause wallerian degeneration with consequent axon loss and ganglion cell death. causes include trauma leading to optic nerve crush, severance, or avulsion, and compression caused by tumors, periosteal proliferation at the optic foramen (where the nerve enters the calvarium) Demyelination (N) Optic nerve Species Mouse; Rat. Other Term(s) Used Myelinolysis; myelinopathy. Pathogenesis/cell of origin Oligodendroglial cell processes. Disintegration of an otherwise normally formed myelin sheath without a primary impact to the ensheathed axon. models have been developed to study human diseases such as PMD and multiple sclerosis (MS) models have been developed to study human diseases such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic Features Foci of leukocytes within the optic nerve or optic disc without other features of inflammation. inflammatory features such as edema, congestion, hemorrhage, necrosis and increased numbers of glial cells (gliosis) are also present. pathogenesis/cell of origin Separation of myelin sheaths surrounding axons. Irregular enlargement of axons observed in longitudinal sections. extracellular matrix, subretina (N) Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) Species Mouse; Rat.

PE65 is a clinical term for fibroplasia occurring in the subretinal space. membranes may be associated with neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. membranes may be secondary to subretinal hemorrhage, retinal or choroidal inflammation, or intraocular surgery. enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and accumulation of lipofuscin may be observed. hypertrophy is often associated with detachment of the retina or photoreceptor death. hypertrophied RPE often presents as uniformly enlarged RPE. pathogenesis/cell of origin RPE impaired degradation of shed photoreceptor outer segments is associated with aging processes, but may also occur with enzyme deficiency of some genetic diseases. membranes may have lamellated appearance reminiscent of outer segments of photoreceptors. Lipofuscin accumulates spontaneously with age due to impaired ability to properly remove the granules from the cell. however, clear vacuoles generally remain, representing the presence of cellular accumulations. RPE impairment is thought to have a critical role in age-related degeneration of the retina. the RPE contribution to the blood-retinal barrier and transport mechanisms between the vasculature and retina render them vulnerable to toxicities from systemically administered compounds. pathogenesis/cell of origin Melanin gradually decreases as an age-related change. but lipofuscin accumulates with age, and can fuse with melanin. Pigment may be autofluorescent if lipofuscin remains following processing. lysosomes containing membranes, lipofuscin or melanolipofuscin granules, and decreased or irregular shaped melanosomes are associated with degeneration. polarity is associated with loss of integrity of the BRB and retinal homeostasis. inflammatory cell (N) Sclera Species Mouse; Rat.

TM cells may be linearly arrayed in multiple, irregular layers overlying the TM. comment TM response to injury is limited. Activated TM cells may form distinct spindle shapes expressing -SMA. pathogenesis/cell of origin Hyperplasia occurs as focal populations of RPE that proliferate in response to lost or damaged cells or inflammation. involved cells generally lack polarity and may be loosely attached to adjacent cells or to Bruch\u2019s membrane. cells of the cornea, conjunctiva (bulbar and palpebral) are retained by a basement membrane without invasion into the underlying tissues. no cellular dysplasia observed. no or only slight mitotic activity. squamous cell carcinoma is a rare neoplasm in the rat. squamous

vesicles. leiomyoma cells have cytoplasmic myofibrils, focal cytoplasmic densities, and surface-connected vesicles. uveal melanomas may invade the cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, retina and orbit. uveal melanomas may invade the cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, sclera, retina and orbit. uveal melanomas are the most common intraocular tumors in adults. uveal melanomas are the most common primary intraocular tumors in adults. electron microscopy appears to be the best diagnostic method for differentiating these two neoplasms. schwannomas may contain melanosomes; convoluted, moderately thin cytoplasmic processes lined by a basal lamina are diagnostic for schwannomas. uveal leiomyoma cells have cytoplasmic myofibrosils, focal cytoplasmic densities, and surface-connected vesicles. melanoma cells contain cytoplasmic stage II premelanosomes. meningiomas, Schwannomas and gliomas reported in rodents. ganglioneuroma has been reported in rats. details of its histologic features were not described. meningiomas of the optic nerve of rats have exhibited characteristics of the malignant form, including local invasion and a high mitotic rate. they have an epithelioid pattern (meningothelial type), which is rare in the cranial cavity. an orbital malignant Schwannoma of an F344/N NTP rat described was believed to be of optic nerve origin since it was centered on, although obliterated, the optic nerve. the tumors consisted of large masses within the bony orbit just posterior to the globe. the eye and optic nerve are included on the core list of tissues recommended by the Society of Toxicologic Pathology for histologic examination. the perfect eye section for a routine rodent toxicity study is a superior-inferior sagittal section, passing through the optic nerve head, with proper orientation and free of artifacts. rodent eyes should remain in Davidson\u2019s solution for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours) for best results, eyes should be transferred directly to ethanol on the tissue processor. a small section should be collected for fixation in 10% formalin. fixation with solutions containing glutaraldehyde (e.g. Karnovsky\u2019s solution) is suitable if electron microscopy is planned. submerge the globe in the fixative for 2 hours to allow initial firming of the globe. then cut a small window in one side of the globe before submersion for another 2 days. lenses may need to be softened by applying gauze soaked in acetic acid or liquid phenol to the surface of the block. eyelids consist of skeletal muscle and connective tissue stroma (tarsal plate) on the external surface and conjunctiva on the bulbar surface. the limbus contains populations of fibroblasts, monocytes and Langerhans cells. the stroma of the limbus is loose and contains a highly vascularized episcleral arterial circle that originates from the superficial branch of the anterior ciliary artery. the rodent cornea is composed of 5 layers (anterior to posterior) the rodent cornea is thicker in the central portion, and thinner in the periphery (Henriksson et al. 2009). the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% of the total corneal thickness in rodents. the integrity and function of the cornea are dependent on the division of epithelial stem cells, and the amplification and centripetal migration of the daughter cells into the cornea to populate the basal epithelium. the basal cells are anchored to a thin basal lamina, or basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. the source of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) is derived from the keratocytes residing between the fibrils. these are modified fibroblasts with numerous interconnecting lamellapodia arranged parallel to the collagen bundles in a manner that similarly facilitates light transmission. the curvature is maintained by an annulus of collagen fibers that circumferentially align the limbus. the endothelial cells (posterior epithelium) form a monolayer layer of cells that line the posterior aspect of the cornea. cornea endothelial cells have incomplete tight junctions between cells that are permissive for movement of nutrients and other molecules from the aqueous humor into the avascular stroma. rance by contraction of myoepithelial cells (sympathetic innervation) and smooth muscle fibers (parasympathetic innervation) that permit dilation, and constriction. blood-aqueous barrier consists of tight junctions between nonpigmented epithelium in the ciliary processes, the endothelial cells of the iris vasculature, and the inner wall endothelium of the angular aqueous plexus in phincter muscle is composed of bundles of smooth muscle that encircle the pupil. it is composed of myoepithelial cells that extend radially from the iris sphincter muscle to the iris periphery in the posterior iris stroma. it is under sympathetic innervation associated with pupil dilation. ciliary body forms the middle component of the vascular layer of the eye. it is composed of smooth muscle, stroma, blood vessels, and epithelium. external surface consists of the inner and outer leaves of the ciliary muscle. ciliary processes are the site of aqueous humor production. the ICA is formed by the base of the iris and the corneal-scleral tunic. the iridocorneal angle (ICA) is formed by the base of the iris and the corneal-scleral tunic. the ICA is located at the periphery of the anterior chamber (limbus) aqueous physiology is similar across species, but dynamics may vary due to anatomical differences in the ICA, ciliary body, and processes across mammalian species are related to ocular size. the inner leaf of the ciliary body (also called the base-plate) is fibrous, and extends from the root of the iris to the ora ciliaris retina. the choriocapillaris is an extensive interconnected capillary network posterior to Bruch\u2019s membrane. the membrane selectively filters the passage of macromolecules between the retina and choriocapillaris. the external choroid is comprised predominantly of a venous plexus. posterior lens fibers are elongated, transparent, fully differentiated cells that derive from progenitor epithelial cells. cell proliferation is restricted to progenitor epithelial cells located in the germinative layer above the lens equator. more than 95% of the vitreous gel weight is water, while the remaining balance is comprised of the structural components of collagen and proteoglycans. most of the soluble protein present in the vitreous is derived from plasma, and albumin and immunoglobulins represent 80% of the protein content of the vitreous. the cortical vitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary vitreous) the cortical vitreous is relatively more condensed and fibrillar compared to the medullary vitreous. the anterior vitreous cortex forms the posterior limits of the posterior chamber and functions in the physiologic communication between the vitreous cavity and the aqueous humor. the anterior vitreous cortex is in contact with the ciliary processes and the lens zonules, as well as the posterior lens capsule. the medullary vitreous has, as a whole, been shown to be variable in its consistency at different ages due to differences in the proportion of gel to liquid vitreous that occur. in many animals, including rodents, the vitreous remains in a predominantly gel state throughout life. hyalocytes express cell surface antigens characteristic of monocyte/macrophage leukocyte lineage including CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), CD64 (Fc receptor I), CD11a (leukocyte-function antigen-1), and histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens. the retina lies internal to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the posterior compartment of the eye, extending from the optic nerve head and terminating posterior to the ciliary body. in the rodent, the retina takes up about 175o of circumference of the globe. cone concentration is usually referred to as the area centralis or visual streak. the macula is a cone-dominated avascular region of maximal visual acuity. cones are sparse in nocturnal rodents. plexiform layer contains synapses between the axon terminals of the photoreceptor cells and bipolar cell dendrites. bipolar cells transfer visual signals to ganglion cells through synapses formed in the inner plexiform layer. horizontal cells form connections between groups of rods and cones through lateral synapses. inner Plexiform Layer Synapses between bipolar cell, amacrine, and interplexiform cells integrate and refine the signals from the photoreceptors in the inner plexiform layer. Ganglion cell nuclei and perikarya reside near the inner surface of the retina forming the ganglion cell layer. the optic nerve is composed primarily of the axons from ganglion cells (GC) which extend from the inner retina, traversing posteriorly and centripetally within the inner nerve fiber layer to converge into bundles at the optic disc forming the nerve. the central area of the optic disc is depressed and is supported by a thickening of the retinal inner limiting membrane. the optic nerve between the globe and the optic chiasm of the rat is long (11.7-12.3 mm) the optic nerve is an extension of the brain and is surrounded by dura, arachnoid, and pia maters. the blood source of the optic nerve is derived from the internal ophthalmic artery, which lies inferior to the optic nerve. the retinal pigment epithelium is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. the basal membrane of the RPE has large infoldings and an association with Bruch\u2019s membrane. Tight junctions between RPE form an important component of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) necessary for the maintenance of immune deviation in the posterior segment of the eye. they prevent leakage of blood constituents from the choriocapillaris. albino species have melanosomes, but lack melanin granules. some pharmacological agents bind to melanin and induce pigmentary changes. melanin binding can unintentionally result in drug sequestration, prolonged drug exposure to sensitive ocular tissues. the sclera is covered by a fibroelastic membrane, the Tenon capsule. it fuses with the conjunctiva posterior to the limbus and extends posterior to fuse with connective tissue surrounding the optic nerve. the sclera has a rich nerve supply but lacks a specific vascular bed, which renders the eye vulnerable to particularly painful or prolonged inflammation. the third eyelid is located in the nasal aspect of the palpebral fissure. the conjunctiva covers the eyelids and the bulbar conjunctiva covers the sclera of the eye. the limbus contains populations of fibroblasts, monocytes and Langerhans cells. rodent cornea is composed of 5 layers (anterior to posterior): non-keratinized squamous epithelium, epithelial basement membrane, corneal stroma, Descemet\u2019s membrane, and endothelium. rodent cornea is thicker in the central portion, and thinner in the periphery. corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% of corneal thickness in rodents. epithelium undergoes post-natal development and cell differentiation. epithelial cells appear to derive from the basal cells of entire cornea during early development. the basal cells are anchored to a thin basal lamina, or basement membrane, by hemidesmosomes. an amorphous membrane containing nerve plexi adjacent to the basal epithelium has been reported using confocal microscopy. transparency of the cornea is primarily dependent on the arrangement of the stroma, an extracellular matrix of collagen fibrils. the posterior aspect of the stroma is bordered by Descemet\u2019s membrane, a specialized basal lamina that is secreted by the corneal endothelium. the endothelial cells secrete the lamina throughout life such that the membrane becomes thicker with age. uvea & Iridocorneal angle The highly vascularized ocular tissues are collectively referred to as the uvea. the posterior uvea consists of the choroid, and the anterior uvea, the iris and ciliary body. the iris extends centrally to form a circumferential diaphragm in front of the lens. retinal circulation (inner blood-retinal barrier) and tight-junctions between retinal epithelial cells (outer blood-retinal barrier) preventing passage of large molecules from the choriocapillaris into the retina. iris originates from the anterior portion of the ciliary body. s and dendritic cells grant immunity privilege to ocular tissues of the anterior segment by modulating inflammatory reactions and establishing a deviated immune response. Deviated T-cell responses, the blood-aqueous-barrier, and immunosuppressive factors present in the aqueous collectively promote a microenvironment that spares the visual axis. pigmentation of the iris has a protective role to the retina by limiting light transmission through the pupil. aqueous humor is secreted into the posterior ocular chamber and circulates through the pupil into the anterior ocular chamber. the epithelium of the ciliary processes secretes hyaluronic acid, the main constituent of the vitreous. rodents, which have scant ciliary smooth muscle, have poor visual acuity. the TM surface is covered by a unique population of endothelial-like trabecular cells that are continuous with the endothelium of the cornea and the downstream collecting duct. the TM is subdivided into three layers (in order of aqueous flow). aqueous humor exits the JCM and flows into collecting ducts. the sinus contains 1-2 rows of short, fine pectinate ligaments and 2-3 layers of trabeculae. the blood supply to the ciliary body is derived from the two long posterior ciliary arteries. in rodents, they are less developed relative to other species that have more robust aqueous humor production. lens is a crystalline, polarized spherical structure located in the posterior chamber immediately anterior to the vitreous. the ciliary zonule transmits forces resulting from contraction or relaxation of the muscles within the ciliary body that allow for visual accommodation depending on the distance of the object. crystalline proteins are arranged along thin filaments that compose the cytoskeleton of the fiber cell. injury to the lens may result in the formation of insoluble aggregates of crystallines, producing opacities that obstruct light transmission and obscure vision. the stroma of the limbus is loose and contains a highly vascularized episcleral arterial circle that originates from the superficial branch of the anterior ciliary artery. capillaries may extend as far anteriorly as Bowman\u2019s membrane before looping back, or less commonly, terminate abruptly within the peripheral stroma. the rodent cornea is thicker in the central portion, and thinner in the periphery. the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% of the total corneal thickness. in rodents, the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 10% of the total corneal thickness. the superficial squamous cells have microvilli that function to increase the cell surface and promote tear adherence. the basal cells are anchored to a thin basal lamina, or basement membrane, by hemidesmosomes (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002a; Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b) s contain crystalline proteins that reduce light scattering. the curvature is maintained by an annulus of collagen fibers that circumferentially align the limbus. the posterior aspect of the stroma is bordered by Descemet\u2019s membrane. a reserve of endothelial cells in the peripheral cornea/limbus are capable of replenishing the cornea endothelium post-injury. the posterior uvea consists of the choroid, and the anterior uvea, the iris and ciliary body. the iris extends centrally to form a circumferential diaphragm in front of the lens. blood-retinal barrier is composed of non-fenestrated capillaries of the retinal circulation (inner blood-retinal barrier) and tight-junctions between retinal epithelial cells preventing passage of large molecules from the choriocapillaris into the retina. the iris originates from the anterior portion of the ciliary body. it separates the anterior from the posterior ocular chamber, allowing for communication via the pupil. the color of the iris is attributed to type and density of melanin pigment, degree of vascularization, and backscatter of incident light from stromal collagen fibers. pigmentation of the iris has a protective role to the retina by limiting light transmission through the pupil. the ciliary processes are the site of aqueous humor production. aqueous humor is secreted into the posterior ocular chamber and circulates through the pupil into the anterior ocular chamber. the epithelium of the ciliary processes also secretes hyaluronic acid, the main constituent of the vitreous. trabecular meshwork (TM) is located within the sinus, posterior to the pectinate ligaments. it is composed of crisscrossing cords or sheets of collagen and elastin. the TM surface is covered by a unique population of endothelial-like trabecular cells. aqueous humor exits the JCM and flows into collecting ducts. the outer leaf, composed of smooth muscle, presses against the sclera and extends from the corneoscleral junction to the ora ciliaris retina. the sinus contains 1-2 rows of short, fine pectinate ligaments, and 2-3 layers of trabeculae. the blood supply to the ciliary body is derived from the two long posterior ciliary arteries. sized anastomosing vessels and melanocytes reside within a pigmented reticular connective tissue mesh located between the venous plexus and the choriocapillaris. the lens is suspended posterior to the iris by the ciliary zonule, a circumferential suspensory ligament composed of an elaborate system of fibers. the lens shares a role with the cornea for light refraction and visual acuity. growth factors, progeny cells migrate, or shift posterior to the equator, where they differentiate into fiber cells. as the cells differentiate, they undergo bi-directional elongation and produce massive quantities of crystalline proteins. injury to the lens may result in the formation of insoluble aggregates of crystallines, producing opacities. most of the soluble protein present in the vitreous is derived from plasma. albumin and immunoglobulins represent 80% of the protein content of the vitreous. studies utilizing fixation and dye injection demonstrate similarity in vitreous structure between human, non-human primate, and rabbit. cortical vitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary vitreous) the cortical vitreous is relatively more condensed and fibrillar compared to the medullary vitreous. the cortical vitreous represents only 2% of the total vitreous volume. the cortical vitreous is most firmly attached to the ILL in the area of the optic disc, the macula (in primates), and to retinal blood vessels. persistent vitreous traction on retinal tears is an important factor in the development of a retinal detachment. the bulk of the vitreous is formed by the core, or medullary vitreous. hyalocytes are phagocytic cells that vary from oval to spindle or stellate shape, possess lysosomes, mitochondria, ribosomes, and micro-pinocytotic vesicles. hyalocytes express cell surface antigens characteristic of monocyte/macrophage leukocyte lineage. anterior cavity-associated immune deviation (ACAID) has been attributed to hyalocytes. hyalocytes also express F4/80, a marker common to tissue macrophages. in non-inflamed eyes, this has been coined vitreous cavity-associated immune deviation. photoreceptors are divided into cones and rods. the nuclei of the photoreceptors reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) the outer segments contain large numbers of mitochondria and golgi complexes. the outer segments are composed of stacked membranous discs. some mice have a preponderance of blue cones in the ventral retina. but no specialized areas such as a macula, fovea, area centralis, or visual streak is present. external limiting membrane is a dense junctional zone between M\u00fcller cells and photoreceptors. bipolar cells receive synaptic input from either rods (rod bipolars) or cones (cone bipolars) and transmit signals to ganglion cells. horizontal cells are less frequent and often lie in the outer part of the INL. amacrine cells are numerous and often lie in the inner aspect of the INL. optic nerve (cranial nerve II) begins at the optic disc (optic papilla, optic nerve head) and courses from the posterior aspect of the globe to the brain. ganglion cell axons and axon bundles are surrounded by astrocytes. the lamina cribosa is composed of sparse connective tissue in rats and mice. it is composed of sparse connective tissue in both rats and mice. the optic disc is poorly demarcated from the surrounding tissue. rodent retinal vasculature has a holangiotic pattern (fully vascularized) the ophthalmic artery enters the eye through the optic nerve and divides into several branches that service the entire retina. the retinal pigment epithelium is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. retinal detachment must be differentiated from artifact detachment. apical membrane of RPE cells have long microvilli that interdigitate with the outer segments of the photoreceptors. retinoid metabolism can lead to blindness. polar distribution in RPE creates ionic gradients that maintain photoreceptor excitability. regulated movement of ions through the cell creates ionic gradients that maintain photoreceptor excitability and permits electrical transmission of light stimulus. aging and photo-oxidative stress can disrupt these pathways. changes in melanin content, lipofuscin accumulation, and conjugates (melanolipofuscin) impair light absorption, enhances oxidative stress, and results in RPE degeneration. cells transdifferentiation, migration, and proliferation of RPE are associated with the production of sub-retinal fibroplasia (membranes) observed in macular degeneration. the sclera has a rich nerve supply but lacks a specific vascular bed. inflammation occurring within the sclera may culminate in necrosis. there are species and age-related differences in the relative composition of the structural components. the vitreous collagen is arranged in fibrils with a central core of types V/XI, surrounded by type II (the predominant collagen present), all overlaid by type IX. the cortical vitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary vitreous) the cortical vitreous represents only 2% of the total vitreous volume. it contains the hyalocytes, which make up 90% of the cell population in the cortical vitreous. the vitreous cortex extends anteriorly from the vitreous base to form the anterior vitreous cortex and posteriorly to form the posterior vitreous cortex. the bulk of the vitreous is formed by the core, or medullary vitreous. it is essentially a cell-free mixture of collagens and hyaluronic acid. it is essentially a cell-free mixture of collagens and hyaluronic acid. hyalocytes are phagocytic cells that vary from oval to spindle shape. hyalocytes express cell surface antigens characteristic of monocyte/macrophage leukocyte lineage including CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), CD64 (Fc receptor I), CD11a (leukocyte-function antigen-1) and MHC class II antigens. in non-inflamed eyes, this has been coined vitreous cavity-associated immune deviation (VCAID) the retina lies internal to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the posterior compartment of the eye, extending from the optic nerve head and terminating posterior to the ciliary body. the rodent retina takes up about 175o circumference of the globe. inner segments contain large numbers of mitochondria and golgi complexes. outer segments are composed of stacked membranous discs containing the photosensitive pigments used in the visual cycle. rods predominate in all species, but respective numbers of cones and rods and spatial arrangement within the retina have considerable species variation. limiting membrane is a dense junctional zone between M\u00fcller cells and photoreceptors. perikaryon and nucleus of the photoreceptor cell reside in the outer nuclear layer. axons radiate inward to form synapses in the outer plexiform layer. M\u00fcller cells are specialized glial cells that provide structural and functional support to the retina. their long processes stretch radially across the thickness of the retina. cells in the INL can be quantified and identified by special stains. internal limiting membrane is a basement membrane secreted by the terminal footplates of the M\u00fcller cells. the thickness of the sensory retina decreases towards the periphery. the fovea is a cone-dominated avascular region of maximal visual acuity. the rodent does not have a specialized region for visual acuity. cones are sparse in nocturnal rodents. nuclei of second order neurons (bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and interplexiform cells) reside in the inner nuclear layer. bipolar cells receive synaptic input from either rods (rod bipolars) or cones (cone bipolars) rine, and interplexiform cells integrate and refine the signals from the photoreceptors in the inner plexiform layer. Ganglion cell nuclei and perikarya reside near the inner surface of the retina forming the ganglion cell layer. axons from the ganglion cells form the optic nerve. ganglion cell axons and axon bundles are surrounded by astrocytes at the surface of the optic disc forming the nerve. as the nerve passes through the scleral canal it crosses an open meshwork of collagenous beams or plates continuous with the sclera. the lamina cribosa is composed of sparse connective tissue in both rats and mice. rodent retinal vasculature has a holangiotic pattern (fully vascularized) the ophthalmic artery enters the eye through the optic nerve and divides into several branches that service the entire retina. the choroid blood system posterior to the retina supplies the outer retina (particularly the photoreceptors) retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. the retinal pigment epithelium is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of non-sensory cuboidal cells that exteriorly line the retina. in most mammalian species, RPE contain melanosomes, elliptical-shaped granules of melanin pigment found in the apical and mid-portion cytoplasm of the cell. melanin enhances object discrimination in bright light conditions by absorbing scattered light. in rodents, melanosomes are rounder and fewer in number. melanin binding can unintentionally result in drug sequestration, prolonged drug exposure to sensitive ocular tissues, enhance free-radical injury. changes in melanin content, lipofuscin accumulation, and the formation of conjugates (melanolipofuscin) impairs light absorption, enhances oxidative stress, and results in RPE degeneration. cellular transdifferentiation, migration, and proliferation of RPE are associated with the production of sub-retinal the Tenon capsule forms a sleeve around the attachment of the ocular muscles to the sclera. the sclera is covered by a fibroelastic membrane, the Tenon capsule. it fuses with the conjunctiva posterior to the limbus, and extends posterior to fuse with connective tissue surrounding the optic nerve. single-cell necrosis is differentiated from apoptosis by combination of cell and nuclear swelling, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, minimal nuclear pyknosis, loss of cellular detail, cellular debris, and inflammation. a diagnosis of apoptosis/single cell necrosis may be appropriate if there is no need to separate individual diagnoses. Fibroblastic membranes resemble the fibrotic process that occurs in wound healing. membranes can form under the retina, on the surface of the retina, and within the vitreous or aqueous humor. contraction can place tension on attached structures. pathogenesis/cell of origin Recruited fibroblasts in response to tissue injury, or endogenous ocular cells that assumed a fibroblastic phenotype. Diagnostic Features Linear arrays of fibroblastic cell types and mature collagen. Often associated with tissue injury and subsequent wound healing similar to that observed in systemic reactions. lymphocytes occur spontaneously in many structures of the eye, including the ocular glands, eyelids, conjunctiva, cilary body, choroid, and surrounding the optic nerve where it exists the eye. Differential Diagnosis Infiltrate, inflammatory cell Leukocyte infiltrates without other indication of inflammation or tissue injury. mitotic figures are normally observed in the cornea, which has a high rate of epithelial turn-over. an increase in incidence occurs following phototoxicity or administration of tubulin inhibitors. new blood vessels have poorly formed or inadequate tight junctions. vessels produced under these conditions do not have adequate tight junctions. ocular tumors are rare in animals, and there are no reports in rodents. eyelid Infiltrate, inflammatory cell, eyelid (N) Eyelid Species Mouse; Rat. Other Term(s) Used None. Differential Diagnosis Inflammation Leukocyte infiltrates with features of inflammation. Irregularly shaped tubules or acini with dilated or reduced lumina. Lined by cuboidal or flattened epithelium. Loss of normal vacuolated cytoplasmic appearance. Granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation can be observed. modifiers are recommended in relation to the predominant inflammatory cellular type (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) attenuation is a specific change observed on spectral microscopy for the corneal endothelium. pathogenesis/cell of origin Corneal or conjunctival epithelial cell may be drug-induced or incidental. endothelial cell layer may have evidence of cell drop-out. cell loss without compensatory attenuation; cornea homeostasis is compromised. attenuation is commonly observed on the peripheral margins of the cornea. epithelial cells are separated by clear spaces characteristic of extracellular edema. proteinaceous fluid undermines epithelium and expands all layers of the cornea. surface of the cornea is covered by a layer of keratin (keratinization) corneal edema occurs due to insufficient endothelial pumping mechanisms. edema may occur due to trauma, developmental abnormalities, or degenerative age changes. mineralization (Corneal dystrophy) may be associated with inflammation, edema and neovascularization. mineralization is most often observed in aged rats. corneal fibroplasia occurs as a reparative process following injury to the cornea endothelium, and from the failure of adjacent endothelial cells to adequately cover subsequent spatial defects. comment Corneal endothelial cells do not regenerate in most species. Descemet\u2019s membrane is expanded by an eosinophilic matrix (arrows) the adjacent corneal endothelium contains multiple layers of prominent endothelial cells. an aggregate of neutrophils undermines an atrophic epithelium. prominent clear cytoplasmic vacuoles are present in the superficial layer of the epithelium. Differential Diagnosis Inflammation Infiltrates of lymphocytes associated with inflammatory features like edema, hemorrhage and necrosis. eosinophilic, lymphocytic, plasmacytic or histiocytic) or mixture of different cellular types (mixed) inflammation may originate in either the conjunctiva or cornea. inflammation of the conjunctiva or cornea is associated with submucosal or stromal edema respectively. mineralization occurs in the subepithelial region or in the anterior stroma. mineralization may be confirmed with von Kossa stain, if present in sufficient quantity. mouse strains with true corneal dystrophies include C57BL/10ChPr, Rhino and OEL (Van Winkle 1991). Pathogenesis/cell of origin Blood vessels originate from extension/proliferation of endothelial cells from the limbal vessels into the peripheral margins of the corneal stroma and extend centrally into the normally avascular cornea. pigmentation may be endogenous (e.g. melanin), occur from hemorrhage (hemosiderin, hemoglobin), or derive from exogenous sources (e.g.foreign body) increased pigmentation associated with an increase in melanin granules can occur with chronic irritation or trauma. pathogenesis/cell of origin Lysosomal accumulation of lipid or other substances (including glycosaminoglycans, mucopolysaccharides and others) within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, or keratocytes. these are generally removed during tissue processing, resulting in the appearance of clear vacuolated spaces on light microscopy. corneal opacities are grossly visible on ophthalmic examination. pathogenesis/cell of origin Malformation occurs from a failure in development of the spaces forming the trabecular meshwork. filtration angle is associated with increased resistance in aqueous humour outflow and IOP. glaucoma is more commonly observed spontaneously in larger species. iridal-cornea adhesion can block the outflow of aqueous humor. severe inflammation may appear as flocculent fluid and/or contain beads or strands of fibrin. on occasion it may be possible to observe residual inflammatory cells following an inflammatory insult that have yet to be cleared from the anterior chamber. Iris is displaced posterior and attached to the cornea endothelium. lens fibers subjacent to the anterior lens capsule are basophilic and fragmented, characteristic of mineralization. Pigment on the anterior lens capsule suggests prior occurrence of posterior adhesions. Adhesions may cause opacities in either the cornea or lens. pigment on the anterior lens capsule may also occur as an artifact of processing. hypoplasia of the ciliary body is associated with anatomical defects in the iris. the rodent iris contains scant stroma and has a narrow-curved profile on cross section. localized developmental errors may lead to spatial defects/holes in other specific ocular structures such as the choroid and optic nerve. persistent pupillary membranes may block the filtration angle, impair aqueous drainage. Iris atrophy occurs in the (C57L X A/He) F1 mouse (Geiss and Yoshitomi 1999), and may occur in association with glaucoma in aging mice. atrophy of the ciliary muscle may result in distortions of the iris, and pupil size and shape. other Term(s) used None Pathogenesis/cell of origin Microvasculature of the iris. Comment Mononuclear cells, including lymphocyte aggregates, are found spontaneously in uveal tissues. other Term(s) Used None Pathogenesis/cell of origin Leukocytes have entered the eye via the uveal vessels of the ciliary body and iris. increased pigment deposition occurs in mice homozygous for iris pigment dispersion or iris stromal atrophy. variably sized clear vacuoles are present in the posterior epithelium of the iris, which contains a concentric mass that is mineralized. Cystine crystal accumulation has been reported in the ciliary body stroma and process epithelium of CTNS -/- mice. lens degeneration, lens fiber, hyperplasia, lens epithelium, or rat. lens is displaced into the anterior chamber and adhered to the cornea by fibroblastic strands of connective tissue. several features of lens degeneration are present and the retina has several folds within the outer nuclear layer. increased protein is present in both the anterior chamber and vitreous (granular eosinophilic matrix) in advanced disease the cortical fibers are completely liquefied and lost. the nucleus of the lens is free floating in the lens capsule. cataract is a clinical diagnostic term used to describe opacities visualized on ophthalmic examination. Fibroplasia occurs in association with hyperplasia of the anterior lenticular epithelium. a new lens capsule may be secreted over the fibrotic region. the anterior lenticular epithelium continues to produce lens capsule material for the life of the animal. i.e., the anterior lens capsule will continue to thicken with age in the animal. the posterior lens capsule does not. glucose is converted to sorbitol, which does not readily diffuse out of the lens fiber. degeneration may be irreversible with agents that are not metabolized by the lens fiber. pathogenesis/cell of origin Leukocyte infiltrates (neutrophilic and/or granulomatous) within the lens. deposition or calcification is not an uncommon sequela to degenerative changes of the lens, particularly those that result in devitalization of the tissue. diagnostic features See features of single cell necrosis described above. Pathogenesis/cell of origin Vacuolation of lens epithelium or fibers is associated with cytoplasmic inclusions that generally represent lysomal accumulation of molecules. several drugs are known to cause phospholipidosis resulting in lysosome accumulation. failure of the development of the vitreous has been reported in mice in association with microphthalmia. it is also possible that development of the primary vitreous may begin, but not completed. hyaloid vasculature gradually undergoes involution, especially during the first 6 weeks. incidence is less than 1% by the end of one year. intravitreal hemorrhage does not appear to be as common in mice as rats. the posterior lens capsule is rimmed by a layer of fibrovascular tissue containing inflammatory infiltrates. the retina is nearly obliterated by fibrovascular tissue which spans the vitreous and connects to the folded lens capsule. pathogenesis/cell of origin Multiple cell origins have been implicated in the formation of vitreal membranes including hyalocytes, spindle cells associated with zonule fibrils, M\u00fcller cells, glial cells, and RPE. cell transdifferentiation, proliferation, and migration are thought to occur in the eye in the same manner as fibrotic reactions that occur systemically. fibrovascularization, or organization of the vitreous body, has also been reported in rats with advanced retinal degeneration. the presence of mature collagen may warrant a diagnosis of fibrosis. hyalocytes recruited from the systemic circulation; can be observed near the retinal surface as part of the immune surveillance process of the eye. hyalocytes recruited from the systemic circulation; can be observed near the retinal surface as part of the immune surveillance process of the eye. inflammation in the vitreous implies a breach of the BOB, and loss of immune deviation. inflammation in the vitreous implies a breach of the BOB. mineralization, vitreous (N) Vitreous Species Mouse; Rat.

Species Mouse; Rat. Other Term(s) Used: None Pathogenesis/cell of origin Incidental, spontaneous, or associated with traction from fibroblastic membranes at the retinal surface and subretinal hemorrhage. more severe folds affect all retinal layers, and can exhibit with subretinal hemorrhage and debris from the photoreceptor outer segments. atrophy of nerve fiber, ganglion cell, inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers is depicted. the normal morphology of the retina on either side of the lesion. the retinal ganglion cells are target of several known retinal toxicants. atrophy may be incidental following hereditary or direct photoreceptor injury. photoreceptors have high metabolic demands, and thus are susceptible to toxins that interfere with energy metabolism. genetic forms of atrophy occur in several strains of mice, including several mutant and transgenic mouse strains and rats. degeneration may occur as a spontaneous (hereditary, aging, exposure to light, nutrient deficiency, inflammatory or trauma) or iatrogenic (e.g. laser treatment, subretinal injection) finding. detachment, retina; Inflammation, mixed cell, choroid and retina; rat. \"tented\" RPE cells have angular apices with fragments of photoreceptor outer segments still attached to the surface. displacement, photoreceptor nuclei, retina; hypertrophy, RPE; mouse. both nonpyknotic and pyknotic nuclei may be found in control eyes. both nonpyknotic and pyknotic nuclei may be found in control eyes. iERM is characterized by the growth of fibrocellular tissue on the internal limiting membrane (ILM) iERM can range from subtle cellophane-like films without visual consequences to markedly contractile membranes that can cause metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity. gliosis is seen in rats as a focal lesion localized in the peripapillary retina. inflammatory cells are often observed with immunological responses. in the retina is lymphocytic. small focal to multifocal lymphocytic infiltrates are thought to be incidental background findings. pathogenesis/cell of origin can occur in any cell layer. special techniques for diagnostics Von Kossa stain for calcium may be useful in paraffin sections. chelation chemistry (silver nitrate) is not specific for calcium salts. nonacidic fixatives such as neutral buffered 10% formalin or alcohol are best for tissues containing calcium deposits. it is suggested to represent a developmental rather than a congenital anomaly (Rubin 1986; Hubert, Gillet et al. 1994). it is suggested to represent a developmental rather than a congenital anomaly. neuronal necrosis is a common end-stage cellular response to irreversible injury. it may be induced by many causes, but most common are metabolic dysfunction, ischemia, or toxicant exposure (chemicals, drugs, or metals) neuronal necrosis in the retina refers to the pathway by which disruption of cellular energy systems results in fluid accumulation within organelles. special techniques for diagnostics Lipofuscin granules may be detected using several special stains. pink using PAS, pale red to red by Oil Red O, dark blue to purple by LFB, and pale blue to blue by LFB. special techniques for diagnostics Neuronal vacuoles in some storage diseases may be confirmed by electron microscopy or by using special stains (e.g., Luxol fast blue [LFB], periodic acid-Schiff [PAS], or Sudan black) to detect a specific biochemical component within vacuoles. retinoschisis is splitting of the retina between layers to form large spaces and may occur with extensive retinal edema. Vascular Changes Arteriolar loop, pre-retinal (N) Retina (Figure 45) may occur with extensive retinal edema. special techniques for diagnostics stains for iron accumulation can be used to identify hemosiderin in old sites of hemorrhage. stains for iron accumulation can be used to identify hemosiderin in old sites of hemorrhage. retinal neovascularization is differentiated from CNV by vascular profiles that extend from the IPL and INL into the outer retinal layers. the main differential diagnostic feature is the presence of an intact Bruch\u2019s membrane in retinal neovascularization. neovascular profiles can contact the RPE cells and colonize the subretinal space. subretinal, retinal and vitreal hemorrhages can occur. pathogenesis/cell of origin Ganglion cell axon; common response to many types of injuries including primary axonal injury, ganglion cell loss, optic neuritis, or hypoxia/ischemia. decrease of optic nerve diameter can be observed in cross sections. pathogenesis/cell of origin Axonal degeneration occurs in several circumstances in the optic nerve. loss of ganglion cells, and consequently their axons, secondary to glaucoma is likely the most common cause. causes include trauma leading to optic nerve crush, severance, or avulsion, and compression caused by tumors. axonal degeneration associated with ageing has been reported in Sprague-Dawley rats and DBA/2J and AKXD- 28/Ty mice. EM is particularly useful in the identification of remyelinated axons versus normal axons. multiple mouse models have been developed to study human diseases such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) glial cell nuclei dispersed throughout optic nerve neuropil. histiogenesis/cell of origin Primarily mononuclear cells; the cause is uncertain, but presumably an incidental, self-limiting response designed for immune surveillance. diagnostic Features Foci of leukocytes within the optic nerve or optic disc without other features of inflammation. Optic neuritis is a clinical term designating a swollen optic nerve disc from any cause when viewed on ophthalmoscopy. other Term(s) used Myelin splitting; axon swelling; myelin edema; wallerian degeneration. there may be associated subretinal edema and inflammation, or subretinal fibroplasia (formation of subretinal membranes) Drusen contain zinc, which is thought to have a role in the precipitation and activation of the complement system. Fibroplasia, subretinal (N) Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is focally replaced by a linear array of fibrovascular tissue that extends into the subretinal space and adjacent retina. there is enlargement, proliferation and migration of RPE with pigment dispersion within the lesion. immunohistochemistry for GFAP or RPE65 can be used to demonstrate the presence of glial cells and RPE, respectively in the membranes. fibroplasia occurs in the subretinal space, and in humans they tend to be associated with neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). membranes may be secondary to subretinal hemorrhage, retinal or choroidal inflammation, or intraocular surgery. pathogenesis/cell of origin RPE enlargement occurs with cellular disease, toxicity, or aging processes due to increase in size and number of organelles. enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (increased activity) or accumulation of lipofuscin may be observed. hypertrophy is often associated with detachment of the retina. pathogenesis/cell of origin RPE impaired degradation of shed photoreceptor outer segments is associated with aging processes, but may also occur with enzyme deficiency of some genetic diseases. membranes may have lamellated appearance reminiscent of the outer segments of photoreceptors. lipofuscin, melanolipofuscin conjugates accumulate in the base of the RPE cytoplasm as granules. these are best observed on fundic examination, and appear as autofluorescent particles. lipofuscin may not survive routine tissue processing unless associated with other organelles or proteins. comment RPE degeneration and necrosis can occur spontaneously due to loss of blood-retinal barrier. it is thought to have a critical role in age-related degeneration of the retina. Pigmentation, increased (N) Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) Species Mouse; Rat. Other Term(s) Used Hyperpigmentation; increased numbers of pigment granules. pathogenesis/cell of origin Melanin gradually decreases as an age-related change. however, lipofuscin accumulates with age, and can fuse with melanin, resulting in increased numbers of brown, pigmented granules. RPE cells are individualized or form aggregates that are separated from Bruch\u2019s membrane, residing in the sub-retinal space. they assume a round to polygonal shape; apical microvilli and basal infoldings are lacking. on electron microscopy, there may be decreased phagosomes observed, but more often, if associated with degeneration, there are numerous lysosomes containing membranes. inflammatory cell (N) Sclera Species Mouse; Rat.
