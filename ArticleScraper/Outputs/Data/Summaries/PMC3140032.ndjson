{"summary": "many features of the parasitic life style can surprise most people regardless naturalist or not. many features of the parasitic life style can indubitably surprise most people regardless naturalist or not. the differences between parasites, mutualists, and free-living organisms are \"almost insensible\" the term \u201csymbiosis\u201d was credited to Heinrich Anton de Bary to describe organisms coexisting or living together. the term \u201ccohabitant\u201d is often more accurate than parasite [6], because it is increasingly clear that every living being, from bacteria to mammals, is a consortium of living beings. a 40% of mammalian genome is composed of retrotransposons derived from retroviruses. microbes may account for up to half the weight of insects such as termites. most if not all known species are involved in parasitism, acting as parasites. about 374 parasite species infect the Homo sapiens sapiens being more than 300 agents of zoonosis. this is not surprising if we keep in mind that only about 1% is exclusively human. the modern Parasitology (Cohabitology) constitutes much more than a branch of biological sciences, congregating in elegant and complex fashion. symbiotic consortia involving bacteria and blue-green algae originated. the prokaryote-organelle continuum is the main stream of eukaryotic cell evolution. even the eukaryotic cell nucleus may have had a prokaryotic origin. symbionts can cross continuum between commensals, mutualists, and pathogens. parasitic and predatory life styles may be exchangeable and sometimes overlapping. symbionts can cross continuum between commensals, mutualists, and pathogens. lichen symbionts arose from parasitic fungi, and there is no general evolutionary progression from parasitism to mutualism. lichens are classified taxonomically, although made-up of two distinct species belonging to different kingdoms. the parasite-host biocartel is suggested to be the target of natural selection. most corals present zooxantellae, and these microorganisms play a pivotal role in the energy flow in the reefs, ecosystems of rich biodiversity. symbiotic microbes take part in blood meal digestion in the lice Pediculus sp. infections from wild animals such as AIDS, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, tularemia, and hemorrhagic fever comprise important sources of emergent and reemergent diseases. new vacant niches are eventually tried by parasites as in the reports of enteric parasitism of human beings by adult worms. invasive plant species that are more completely free from pathogens are more widely reported as harmful invaders of both agricultural and brucelosis, leptospirosis, salmonelosis, tuberculosis, and echinococcosis can cause considerable mortality and morbidity to human beings. the cowpox infection protected humans from smallpox, helping develop its vaccine. some bacteria of our intestinal flora produce compounds useful for our metabolism. Enteric bacteria also induce and regulate the expression of many genes in the gut. the Gram-negative anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron promotes the development of the intestine's submucosal capillaries network. if imbalanced, the intestinal flora can be highly harmful and thousands of children die every year due to bacteria such as enteropathogenic or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. the normal intestinal flora presenting bifidobacteria and lactobacilli has great metabolic importance. eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein exhibit antibacterial and antiviral activities. angiogenin-4 was found to have microbicidal activity against the pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes. pathogenic bacteria, such as Pasteurella multocida, help its hosts, killing evading preys by sepsis and subsequent bacteremia plants such as the Ipomopsis aggregata and Gentianella campestris attacked by herbivores or parasites present increased development. parasites can accumulate highly toxic heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, favoring the survival of the hosts in polluted environments. parasites may be used in monitoring environmental pollution. up to 17% of the eukaryotic protozoan genome may have been transferred. horizontal DNA transfer may take place between a protozoan and mammalian and avian hosts. infected human macrophage lines, rabbits, birds, and patients, trypanosoma cruzi minicircle sequences can integrate into LINE-1. kinetoplast is a portion of the single trypanosomatid mitochondrion, an organelle with presumed endosymbiotic origin. kinetoplast is a portion of the single trypanosomatid mitochondrion, an organelle with presumed endosymbiotic origin. other possible maladies include anxiety, panic disorder with agoraphobia, hypochondria, arsenic poisoning, chronic allergy, Cr a parasitic symbiosis can originate a mutualistic one [2]. a parasitic symbiosis between bacteria and protozoa can originate a mutualistic one. amoebae Acanthamoeba spp. can harbor and even increase the virulence of prokaryotes such as Legionella spp. and Mycobacteria. the protozoan host may protect Legionella from Bdelovibrio attack, but under stress conditions it may digest the hosted bacteria. virulence of the parasites is always varying according to the infection strategies and environment, including the host organism. iospiralis bacteria endosymbionts Caedibacter as an armament against susceptible strains. parelaphostrongylus tenuis worms were differentially advantageous in population competition. competition between coleopterans Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum is determined by presence of the sporozoan Adelina tribolli. 80% of human B lymphocytes are associated to the intestinal mucosa. each meter of intestine produces about 0.8 g of IgA daily. 80% of human B lymphocytes are associated to the intestinal mucosa and each meter of intestine produces about 0.8 g of IgA. the first evidence of bacterial parasitism is one billion years old. the most primitive mycorrhizae have been found in fossil fungi dating from 460 million years ago. the perception of parasitic disease and attempts to control it may have outdated humankind. hippocrates (460\u2013375 b. C.) named the intestinal Teaniae cestodes (taenia) but the Taenia species that infect humans were only described in detail in 1758 by Linnaeus. biblical texts presumably describe the Guinea or Medina worms Dracunculus medinensis as \u201cfiery serpents\u201d. the use of microorganisms to approach fundamental aspects of Cell Biology has been termed \u201cCellular Microbiology\u201d [156]. many discoveries were made via studies on parasitic protozoa [157\u2013159]. many pathogens have been tested and used as biological weapons. parasitic diseases resistance (vide infra) may comprise a pivotal defense against bioweapons. malaria causes nearly one million deaths annually. at least 6 popes, cardinals, and other clergymen have died due to malaria. the death of priests forced the Vatican to speed up the ordainment. even women had been authorized to give the last rites to the uncountable dying. ine obtained by Cinchona officinalis cork, a secret kept by the jesuits. it is believed that about 30 million people succumbed to typhus during world war i. the 1918 Influenza pandemics killed 21 million people, three times more deaths than the World war I. l\u00e1huac perished from smallpox before the conquest of Peru by Pizarro in 1531. it is estimated that the New World Indian population declined as much as 95% in the years following Columbus's arrival. the decay of the powerful Roman Empire may have been related to malaria. the outcome of the american civil war should not come as a surprise. diarrhea and typhoid killed 35,127 and 29,336 Union Soldiers. another 14,379 died of malaria and 9,431 of dysentery. in the past, clandestine mosquitoes carry clandestine parasites take few hours' airplane flights to reach distant continents. in the past, the epidemics followed the maritime routes or railways. in the past, the epidemics followed the maritime routes or railways. in the past, the epidemics followed the maritime routes or railways. infections in vegetables by the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea could provoke the ergotism known as \u201cSaint Antonio's fire\u201d in the Middle Ages. it could have caused the strange behavior of young girls leading to a brutal witch-hunt in 1692 in the city of Salem, USA. effects of mycotoxins are usually more pronounced in children. 500 million people are infected with Plasmodium, resulting in over 2,000 deaths a day (98 deaths/h) mostly among african children. the increased resistance to malaria, largely due to higher frequencies of hemoglobin disorders, clearly demonstrates that deleterious mutations may be favored in response to the parasite stress. parasitic infections can drastically reduce the physical and mental development of children. low physical and cognitive capacities render parasitized people less proficient. it reduces their access to good health and sanitary conditions, increasing risk of new infections. at least 15% of the human tumors have a viral etiology. parasites including helminthes may also promote tumors. parasitic infections remain considered diseases of poverty. urban superpopulation associated with poor sanitary and housing conditions in underdeveloped countries favors proliferation of pathogens and vectors. about 45% of the world population is concentrated in the urban environment, while in Brazil this percentage may reach 80%. indiscriminate use of microbicidal and insecticidal compounds has prompted the appearance of resistant organisms, hindering therapeutical and prophylactic measures. parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis carinii, Cryptosporidium parvum, Leishmania sp., and many others are often called opportunistic agents. the classification of such microorganisms as \u201copportunistic\u201d was often inadequate and misleading. two adenoviruses, Ad-36 and SMAM-1, have shown adipogenic properties. a protein of a viral origin may mediate sperm-egg fusion in mammals. retroviruses play a pivotal role in placental morphogenesis and suppressing maternal immune response. ectoparasitism and parasite cleaning produced mutualistic consortia among vertebrate and invertebrate species. the act of grooming ectoparasites assumed a very important social function among primates. the act of grooming ectoparasites assumed a very important social function among primates. toxoplasma gondii infected women show different personality profiles tend to be less moralistic, disregarding rules, and taking more risks. infected people become more agitated, less neophobic, aggressive and more prone to take part in traffic accidents. parasitism may have risen as primitive strategies to avoid alien parasites within alien populations. the more polygamous a society, the greater its parasite burden, though meaning of this observation is not clear [37, 224, 225] in polygamous animals, the variation in number of sex partners is greater among members of one sex than the other. sexually transmitted parasites should be more virulent in males than in females. the new look guides to switch the current paradigm to a new one. the current paradigm presents concepts: a) infectious agents are enemies that should be destroyed; b) the function of the immune system is to destroy the infectious agents. the cohabitation of cohabitant (symbiont) and cohabited being raises the emergency of a new and complex adaptive system: the parasitized-host [244] there is no parasite without host and vice versa. there is still a long way ahead before we can understand the language of the parasites: the parascript. the cohabitation symbiont-cohabited host is an unfinished symphony. this symphony is played in two different tones."}
