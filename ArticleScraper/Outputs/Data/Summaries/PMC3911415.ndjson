{"summary": "the causative agent, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was identified in 1978 (2, 3) PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the order Nidovirale, the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus (4). PEDV has a genome of approximately 28 kb and includes 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) and 7 known open reading a total of 679 PEDV-positive swine cases from over 17 states have been diagnosed in the following age groups. the clinical disease and lesions of PED are indistinguishable from those caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), another Alphacoronavirus. the sequences of the two U.S. PEDV isolates at different passages were compared to those of 4 additional U.S. PEDV strains. the sequences of the two isolates at different passages were compared to those of 4 additional U.S. PEDV strains whose sequences had been determined. real-time RT-PCR was performed with 50 l of small-intestine homogenates or virus isolates or 100 l of processed feces. real-time RT-PCR was performed on nucleic acid extracts using a path-ID multiplex one-Step RT-PCR kit. postinoculation medium was MEM supplemented with tryptose phosphate broth (0.3%), yeast extract (0.02%) and trypsin 250 (5 g/ml) 3.6 ml postinoculation medium was added to each well. a similar inoculation was performed on Vero cells in 96-well plates. acetone, air dried, and incubated with 200 diluted mouse monoclonal antibody 6C8 for 40 min followed by a 100 dilution of fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) cell staining was examined under a fluorescence microscope. cDNA libraries were constructed from 100 ng of total RNA using a TruSeq Stranded total RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) the pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform with 150-bp end reads. single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called using the SAMtools \u201cmpileup\u201d command. sites were filtered to avoid unreliable calls using the following criteria: (i) a minimum depth of 5 reads at each position, (ii) a minimum base quality of 10, (iii) a minimum SNV quality of 25. at least 85% of reads at the correct position to support the call as homozygous. phylogenetic analysis was performed using the entire genome, the spike gene, the S1 portion (S gene nucleotides 1 to 2205, corresponding to amino acids 1 to 735) (28), the S2 portion (S gene nucleotides 2206 to 4152, corresponding to amino acids 736 to 1383) (28), a hypothetical protein gene (ORF3), the envelope (E) gene, the membrane (M) gene, and the nucleocapsid ( -19338E-IN homogenate, ISU13-19338E-IN P3, ISU13-19338E-IN P9, and ISU13-22038-IA P9 were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KF650370, KF650371, KF650372, KF650373, KF650374, and KF650375. small-intestine tissues were used to generate a 10% (wt/vol) homogenate in Earle' real-time RT-PCR was performed on nucleic acid extracts using a path-ID multiplex one-Step RT-PCR kit. the primers and probe targeting conserve regions of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein gene were as described by Kim et al. inoculated cells in 96-well plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the mixtures were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatants were harvested for further propagation or saved at 80\u00b0C. the ISU13-22038 small-intestine homogenate was centrifuged at 4,200 g for 10 min. the supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 min. they were then negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA; pH 7.0) cDNA libraries were constructed from 100 ng of total RNA using a TruSeq Stranded total RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) the pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform with 150-bp end reads following standard Illumina protocols. the consensus sequences were generated by the VCFtools software package. the consensus sequences were generated by the VCFtools software package. phylogenetic analysis was performed using the nucleotide sequences of the six PEDV viruses from this study. the trees were constructed using the entire genome, the spike gene, the S1 portion (S gene nucleotides 1 to 2205, corresponding to amino acids 1 to 735) (28), the S2 portion (S gene nucleotides 2206 to 4152, corresponding to amino acids 736 to 1383) (28), a hypothetical protein gene (ORF3), two PEDV isolates designated ISU13-19338E and ISU13-22038 were successfully obtained from the small intestines of piglets from sow farms in Indiana. a distinct cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for ISU13-19338E from passage 1 (P1) and for ISU13-22038 from P0. prominent CPE was observed within 24 h postinoculation during the propagation process. first 10 serial passages, the infectious titers of both isolates ranged from 6 102 to 2 105 TCID50/ml. level of viral genome or transcript in each passage was also assessed by a PEDV N gene-based real-time RT-PCR. 3.5 4.3 4.3 3.5 4.8 4.5 4.8 4.8 a N.A., not applicable; N.D., not done. multiple virus particles with distinctive crown-shaped projections were visible in the 13-22038 small-intestine homogenates. EM images on original homogenate and PEDV-infected Vero cells were also examined by negative-staining EM techniques. all six PEDV viruses have a genome 28,038 nucleotides in length. the genome is similar to what was previously described (5, 27) and includes the 5\u2032 UTR, ORF1a and ORF1b, S, ORF3, E, M, N, and 3\u2032 UTR. ab (293\u201312616,12616\u201320637) pp1ab 1303 T C C 3519 C T 1076 Ala Val Val S (20634\u201324794) Spike 21403 A A G 257 Asn Asn Ser 21756 C T T 375 Leu Phe Phe ORF3 (24794\u201325468) Hypothetical protein 3 E (25449\u201325679 Envelope M (25687\u201326367) Membrane N (26379\u20132770 nucleotides of replicase proteins are numbered according to their locations in the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. c, no nucleotide or amino acid change occurred. entire genome sequences of PEDV from the homogenate and from the P3 and P9 cell cultures of the two isolated strains were compared. all of the 10 U.S. PEDV strains were genetically closely related to each other (99.7% to 99.9% nucleotide identity) and differed from each other by 1 to 55 nucleotides at the whole-genome level. nucleotide identities and numbers of nucleotide differences ranged from 96.3% to 99.5%. 99.8) 22 (99.9) 1 (99.9) 50 (99.9) 120 (99.5) 208 (99.2) 204 (99.2) 264 (99.0) 184 (99.3) 1,035 (96.3) 906 (96.7) 13-19338E P3 1 (99.9) 13 (99.9) 14 (99.9) 17 (99.9) 45 (99.8) 25 (99.9) 4 (99.9) 53 (99.8) 123 (99.5) 211 Colorado2013_KF272920 53 (99.8) 43 (99.8) 15 (99.9) 138 (99.5) 196 (99.3) 192 (99.3) 276 (99.0) 172 (99.3) 1,034 (96.3) 905 (96.7) PEDV strains are shown here. the 7 strains with lowest and highest nucleotide identities to the U.S. PEDV strains are shown. the other 16 strains having nucleotide identities of 96.4% to 98.9% compared to the U.S. PEDV strains are not shown. no of the six PEDV sequences had such an insertion at that position. a single-nucleotide insertion between positions 20,204 and 20,205 of some PEDV strains is shown. the amino acid codon immediately before the insertion is shown as underlined. 33 PEDV viruses can be clustered into group I and group II. the trees were constructed using the distance-based neighbor-joining method of the software MEGA5.2. the trees were constructed using the distance-based neighbor-joining method of the software MEGA5.2. ISU13-19338E from passage 1 (P1) and ISU13-22038 from P0 were serially passed in vero cells for a total of 10 passages (P0 to P9) prominent CPE was usually observed within 24 h postinoculation during the propagation process.
