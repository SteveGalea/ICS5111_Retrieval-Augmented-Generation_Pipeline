{"summary": "outpatients with acute respiratory illness (7 days) were tested for influenza using singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) a subset was assayed for 18 viruses using MRT-PCR. no virus was identified in 267 (40.3%) samples. most cases of respiratory viral infections are asymptomatic or relatively mild. the most common viruses associated with respiratory tract infections are human adenovirus (ADNO), human coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza virus (influenza), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) study used singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) to detect influenza virus. the study is among the first to examine a wide range of respiratory viral infections, including four CoVs and four PIVs. Specimen collection All patients except infants (2 years) were sampled by two polyester swabs (Remel) the swabs were combined in the same cryovial and couriered to the UPMC Clinical Virology Laboratory. the specimens were stored in a lysis buffer and aliquoted for nucleic acid isolation and detection of influenza virus using the eSensor XT-8 instrument. Specimens were tested by the eSensor XT-8 instrument and respiratory viral panel. panel includes adenovirus groups B, C, and E; coronaviruses (CoV) 229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63; influenza B virus; hMPV, PIV types 1, 2, 3, and 4; RSV types A and B; and HRV. bivariate multinomial regression models were used to assess the association of patient characteristics with the results of the MRT-PCRs. the dependent variable is the virus group, and the independent variables are the participants' personal characteristics. influenza vaccination status was combined from electronic medical record (EMR) data and self-report. influenza activity did not increase appreciably over baseline levels as determined by local surveillance systems until mid-january 2012. the eSensor RVP multiplex PCR assay is currently approved for clinical use in Europe. it has the same methodological characteristics but a broader range of viral analytes than the US FDA approved version. participants were divided into three age groups \u2013 children (6 months\u201317 years), young adults (18\u201349 years), and older adults (50 years). multinomial regression models were fit for each variable controlling for age and self-reported health status, with no virus detected as the reference group. of the 45 singleplex influenza positives, 41 (91%) were multiplex influenza positive (38 influenza A and 3 influenza B), 1 (2%) was multiplex negative for any virus, and 3 (7%) were multiplex positive for non-influenza viruses (HRV, mHMPV, and RSV) for children, the percentages of single virus, multiple viruses, and no virus detected were 59%, 12%, and 29%, respectively. for young adults, the percentages were 50%, 3%, and 47%, respectively. for older adults, the percentages were 49%, 5%, and 46%, respectively. the distributions of viral infections varied by week (P 0001) among those sampled over 15 weeks. overall, coV infections were readily apparent during late January through early March. hMPV infections varied over the time period, and influenza infections peaked in March. 1 Age group, (%) Children (6 months\u201317 years) 196 112 138 179 76 143 352 005 Young adults (18\u201349 years) 247 142 53 190 41 65 510 Older adults (50 years) 142 85 106 141 78 85 507 Household members 18 years, n (%) 1 135 89 89 193 89 111 430 064 2 321 125 94 175 44 100 464 3 84 119 169 60 76 503 Household smoking,% 123 146 65 203 41 89 455 052 No household smoking,% 453 113 102 166 68 95 457 Asthma diagnosis,% 153 150 65 176 52 91 464 060 No asthma diagnosis,% 416 108 101 176 67 99 450 Received 2011\u201312 influenza vaccine,% 384 112 89 172 6 12 448 020 Did not receive 2011\u201312 influenza vaccine 92 105 11 174 84 105 424 001 No fever,% 193 145 62 176 16 78 523 Wheezing,% 211 128 104 18 66 114 408 060 No wheezing,% 374 112 88 171 59 86 484 Sore throat,% 389 116 69 167 59 9 499 003 No sore throat,% 196 122 143 189 66 107 children were more likely to have hMPV and RSV detected than older adults. those presenting with fever were more likely to have hMPV or influenza than other viral infections. those who were vaccinated against influenza were more likely to have RSV virus detected. patients presenting with medically attended acute respiratory infections to viral etiology in multinomial regression analyses. control for age and self-reported health status Virus type CoV (n = 69) hMPV (n = 55) HRV (n = 102) Influenza (n = 36) RSV (n = 56) Adjusted P value Categorical variables, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) Race, white versus other 084 (063\u2013112) 112 (077\u2013 0 versus 3 092 (061\u2013139) 100 (063\u2013160) 085 (059\u2013122) 071 (040\u2013127) 087 (054\u2013141) 0210 1 versus 3 104 (063\u2013172) 079 (043\u2013143) 109 (071\u2013168) 106 (056\u2013201) 201 (123\u2013328) 2 versus 3 120 (072\u2013197) 103 (060\u2013180) 143 (095\u2013217) 081 (040\u2013164) 108 123) 126 (082\u2013194) 075 (035\u2013159) 133 (077\u2013228) Health indicators Smoker versus non-smoker 094 (043\u2013203) 090 (028\u2013289) 103 (053\u2013202) 093 (029\u2013302) 060 (019\u2013190) 0974 Household smoking versus no household smoking 116 (062\u2013220) 078 (034\u2013179) 115 (066\u2013202) 064 (023\u2013176) 092 (043 067 (043\u2013105) 162 (086\u2013307) 066 (045\u2013097) 179 (091\u2013350) 094 (058\u2013152) Fatigue 069 (037\u2013127) 094 (046\u2013191) 092 (053\u2013161) 116 (048\u2013283) 114 (055\u2013235) 0838 Fever 085 (050\u2013148) 226 (110\u2013464) 117 (072\u2013190) 662 (197\u2013222) 153 (080\u2013292) 0008 144 (081\u2013255) 207 (109\u2013394) 136 (083\u2013223) 159 (075\u2013337) 207 (111\u2013387) 0104 Continuous Variables odds ratio (95% confidence interval)** Age* (units = 5) 095 (089\u2013101) 095 (088\u2013102) 094 (088\u2013099) 097 (089\u2013106) 092 (086\u2013099) 0104 BMI (units = 5) 122 (102\u2013145) 084 (065 multinomial regression modeling was used;
