{"summary": "host population size and density play a critical role in the ability of a species to maintain viruses that cause acute or immunising infections. it is unrealistic to consider this threshold absolute; rather it should be viewed as \u2018the host population size above which stochastic fadeout of a disease over a given period is less probable than not\u2019. host species which exist in large population sizes and in high densities are capable of acting as reservoirs for a greater number of viruses than smaller, low density populations. this species has been identified as a reservoir for henipaviruses and LBV in continental Africa [12]\u2013[18]. other viruses detected in E. helvum include a novel orbivirus [19] and rotavirus [20] (both via viral isolation), a coronavirus [21] (via PCR), and a filovirus [22] (via presence of antibodies) henipavirus or LBV infections exist in the geographically isolated population of E. helvum annobonensis fruit bats on Annob\u00f3n island. sample collection was approved by the Zoological Society of London Ethics Committee (WLE/0849) plasma was aspirated and stored at 20\u00b0C. samples were heat treated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min prior to analysis. serological analyses were conducted on 73 or 70 samples. 50 g of protein was electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. the protein was electroblotted overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane. strips were then incubated for 1h with individual sera. venhage virus (DUV.RV131) and west Caucasian bat Virus (WCBV) all samples were analysed in duplicate in both assays. titres reported correspond to 100% neutralisation of pseudotype or virus input. a uniquely-numbered thumb ring was applied before the individual was released. age class (sexually immature or adult) was assessed by body size and the degree of genital and nipple development. Western blot analysis was performed on 11 sera with the highest MFI values in the binding assays (>750) using a purified recombinant NiV nucleocapsid protein. the protein was electroblotted overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane. the strips were then incubated for 1h with individual sera. assays were multiplexed with two viruses per assay LBV (as above) + Mokola virus (MOKV.NIG68-RV4) and duvenhage virus (DUVV.RV131) + West Caucasian Bat Virus (WCBV) all samples were analysed in duplicate in both assays. adult body size and forearm length were significantly smaller (p0.001) than E. helvum on either continental Africa or the other Gulf of Guinea islands. Luminex binding MFIs were higher against NiV in all samples above background levels. a similar pattern was seen in the 20 month age class (including primiparous individuals), where 6/10 individuals had MFIs under 200, and the maximum was 629 (Bat # 331). Luminex inhibition assay results were in agreement with binding results (Table S1). samples with Luminex binding MFIs over 750 were tested using a recombinant, purified Nipah virus nucleocapsid protein. the positive control sera are NiV-neutralising Pteropus alecto and polyclonal Rabbit sera raised to recombinant NiV protein. an african henipavirus has not been isolated from bats in australia [32] and NiV from bats in south east Asia [33]. the results are consistent with earlier studies, highlighting the distinctiveness and isolation of E. helvum annobonensis. henipavirus Luminex binding results showed a very low range of MFI values compared with adult bats. bats of 8 months of age also showed a very low range, except for two primiparous females with MFIs of 941 and 1188. henipavirus maternal antibodies are present in E. helvum pups at birth at levels proportional to those in the dam. aviruses in bats relies on a large, weakly-coupled, asynchronous metapopulation. populations can experience either acute \u2018explosive\u2019, or slow \u2018smouldering\u2019 epidemics. henipavirus persistence in bat populations is unknown. in other species, the CCS for other paramyxoviruses is in the order of hundreds of thousands or more individuals. henipavirus antibodies and virus have been detected in island fruit bats in Asia [33], [43], [44]. presence of previously-infected bats in the very small population on the most isolated island, Annob\u00f3n, may provide evidence from wild bat populations for viral persistence. there is only one record of another bat species being present on the island. if it is still present on the island, it appears extremely unlikely to be contributing to henipavirus persistence. studies on european bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2) have detected low seroprevalences (1\u20134%) in daubenton's bats. a long incubation period has been hypothesised to facilitate viral persistence in migratory bats, such as mainland E. helvum. a recent study by our group demonstrated antibodies against henipaviruses in a sample of domestic pigs in Ghana [59]. more information is required on the viruses involved, their infection dynamics within the bat populations, potential spillover routes, and bat population dynamics before any risk can be assessed. the MFI values represent intensity of antibody binding to recombinant HeV and NiV G glycoproteins on a continuous scale. however, since no African henipavirus is available for neutralisation testing, no gold standard assay is available. in a natural population where virus is circulating endemically, individual bat antibody levels are expected to be dynamic. the presence of high MFIs, positive western blot results and a seropositive VNT in older bats suggests that virus has circulated within the population within the last 20 months. more-detailed age-specific seroprevalences are required, however, to determine whether this represents a single epidemic wave or ongoing endemic circulation. an alternative hypothesis is that there is persistence of henipavirus in individuals with recrudescence, such as during times of stress or breeding. the related HeV in Australia has the ability to persist and fatally recrudesce in both horses [39] and humans [40] it is unclear how soon E. helvum arrived on Annob\u00f3n after it was formed 4.8 Mya. no known records exist as to whether henipa- or henipa-like viruses were introduced to the islands at the time of E. helvum colonisation. lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2) has detected low seroprevalences (1\u20134%) in daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) in the united kingdom. rabies virus has been shown to persist in populations of temperate insectivorous bats. the extended incubation periods known to exist for lyssaviruses may provide a mechanism that allows LBV persistence within isolated populations, by avoiding fade-out before new susceptibles are provided by the seasonal birth pulse. natural and experimental studies on lyssavirus transmission, pathogenesis and serological response in bats have produced highly variable intra- and inter-study results. Isolated island populations present a unique and valuable opportunity to further our understanding of the maintenance of viruses in wildlife populations. more information is required on the viruses involved, their infection dynamics within the bat populations, potential spillover routes, and bat population dynamics."}
