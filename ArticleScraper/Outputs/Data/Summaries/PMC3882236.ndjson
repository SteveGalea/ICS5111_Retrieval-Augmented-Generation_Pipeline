{"summary": "hepatitis C is a major public health problem worldwide. more than 70% of infected people fail to clear the virus during the acute phase of the disease and become chronic carriers. liver disease is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the united states. monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1H8 targets the highly conserved peptide sequence APTYSW in the E2 protein from residues 524 to 529. this region plays a role in the interaction with host entry factor CD81. this new finding may enhance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections. all peptides were synthesized on a peptide synthesizer (Model 433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) all peptides were synthesized with a Fmoc-Lys (Biotin-LC)-Wang resin (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) the construct spans the region encoding residues 384-661. 1010 phages were incubated with a mixture of 1H8 and protein A-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads\u00ae Protein A, Life Technologies) for 20 min at room temperature to allow sufficient binding. DNA from single phage plaque was sequenced; the corresponding peptide sequence was then deduced from the DNA sequence. a goat anti-human peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 13000 dilution was added to the wells. the plates were washed another 4 times and then kept in the dark for 10 min. a biotinylated peptide (YQPYRVVVVLSFELLNAPATV) was used as the negative control. 5 percent nonfat dry milk in PBS-T was used to block the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. the blocked membrane was then incubated with 1H8 (11000 dilution), as a primary antibody, for an additional hour. with PBS-T, CD81-Luc supernatant (2.5106 units of luciferase activity in 30 L) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. a 50 L mixture of the BioLUX kit substrate and buffer was added to the wells. the bioluminescent signal intensity was immediately measured with an Infinite F500 microplate reader. the hybrid cells that secreted HCV E2-reactive antibodies were further cloned, expanded, and cultured in BD CellTM MAb serum-free medium at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for antibody production. none of these samples can be directly or indirectly linked to donor identity. s 384-661 was made by PCR using a specific primer pair. cloned into a mammalian cell expression vector, pFUSE-Fc2-IL2ss. truncated forms of E2-16Fc, i.e., E2-14Fc and E2-12Fc, were transfected individually into Huh7 cells with LipofectamineTM2000 reagent. ELISA A biotinylated peptide (200 ng) was prepared in 100 L SuperBlock blocking buffer. plates were washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (pH 7.4) followed by incubation with 100 L of patient plasma (1800 dilution) a biotinylated peptide (YQPYRVVVVLSFELLNAPATV) was used as the negative control for this assay with 1H8 (14000 dilution); an A450 nm reading of 0.64 (Mean + 2 standard deviations) was obtained, which was used as the cut-off to define the positive. the samples were treated with SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Serum-free culture media containing the secreted the constructs were fused with the gaussia luciferase (New England BioLabs) and the human IgG1 Fc moieties (invivogen) to produce the constructs. they were transfected separately into Huh7 cells which secreted the resulting fusion proteins into the cell culture medium. the supernatant (100 L/well) was incubated in 96-well microtiter plates coated with protein A. 8 in 50 l cell culture supernatant with an antibody concentration of 16.67 g/mL was serially diluted (1:3) and added to the cell culture, followed by adding 50 L of CNS2 Rluc virus. mAb 1H8 was found to be a neutralizing antibody because it reduced the infectivity of HCV genotype 2a virus in a dose-dependent manner. monoclonal mouse anti-E2 antibody 2C1 supernatant was used as a positive control. percent neutralization was calculated based on an irrelevant mouse anti-CD4 antibody GK1.5 supernatant. a Western blot analysis was performed to determine the reactivity of mAb 1H8 with the proteins indicated. the secreted forms of these E2 proteins were produced after transfection of Huh7 cells. 1H8 (11000 dilution) and an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (13000 dilution) were used as primary and secondary antibodies. 5, Y527 and W529 were the direct contact points for the antibody. ELISA results showed that the stretch of residues 520\u2013533 forms a linear epitope for neutralizing antibody 1H8. the antibody no longer bound the peptide when W529 was replaced by an alanine. luciferase reporter type of assay devised a luciferase reporter type of assay with the help of a CD81-Luc recombinant protein to monitor the interactions of the E2 protein with CD81-Luc. the interaction of the E2-16Fc protein with CD81-Luc was significantly weakened in the presence of increasing amounts of 1H8. y-axis indicates the relative luciferase activity, representing the direct interaction between the E2 protein and CD81 by 1H8. single site mutations T526A, Y527A or W529A significantly reduced the binding of the E2-16Fc protein to CD81-Luc. a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments were carried out to generate two types of variations on the backbone of the E2 protein of the H77 strain. the substitution of A524 with a valine residue significantly reduced the binding of 1H8 to the E2 protein. however, the interaction of this mutated E2 with CD81 was not affected by the substitution. residues 524\u2013529 derived from the E2 protein of H77 strain, i.e., E2-16Fc, is indicated. the hyphen indicates any possible amino acids at these positions. the residues at positions of 525, 526,527 and 529 are highly conserved. either S528N or S528T substitutions did not affect the CD81 binding, although these replacements reduced the binding of 1H8 in the Western blot. this suggests that while the binding of 1H8 is residue-specific at the position of 528, the selection of residues at the position 528 is unlikely to be crucial for the E2 protein to interact with CD81. the assay cut-off was based on the negative control, a SARS virus peptide. 53 patient samples (54.08%) reacted positively to the wild-type epitope peptide. 35 samples (35.71%) also reacted positively with the mutant S528A. hepatitis C patients could produce \u201c1H8-like\u201d neutralizing antibodies. levels of \u201c1H8-like\u201d antibodies had increased significantly by days 643 and remained elevated at day 5266. antibody selected preferentially the phages that displayed peptides containing a W residue in a linear consensus sequence of APT(S)Y(S,T)SW. predicted that 524APTYSW529 in the E2 protein was likely to be the binding site of 1H8. the removal of residues 571\u2013661 did not affect binding of 1H8. however, a further deletion of residues between 510 and 570 resulted in a loss of binding by 1H8. the segment between residues 510 and 570 is involved in the binding of 1H8. residue specificity of 1H8 was determined by replacing key contact residues predicted by phage display with an alanine or glycine in the E2-16Fc construct. a Western blot analysis was then performed to test the specific effect of the substitutions on the binding of 1H8. a biotin-linked peptide (200 ng) was coated onto a well of 96-well plate. 1H8, at a 14000 dilution, was used as the primary antibody. the y-axis indicates the resulting absorbance at 450 nm. 2-16Fc was incubated with the Protein A pre-coated 96-well plates at 100 L/well at room temperature for 1 hour. 30 L supernatants containing 2.5106 units of luciferase activity of CD81-Luc were added to each well in the presence or absence of 1H8. the y axis indicates the relative luciferase activity, representing the direct interaction between E2-16Fc and CD81-Luc. the alignment of 1958 HCV E2 protein sequences showed that the four residues, P525, T526, Y527 and W529, are highly conserved. intriguingly, A524, the residue that we found to be important specifically for 1H8 binding, could be replaced by other amino acids. this raises the possibility that the binding of 1H8 to the epitope could be modified if the virus contained these substitutions. a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments were carried out to generate two types of variations on the backbone of the E2 protein of the H77 strain. the substitution of A524 with a valine residue significantly reduced the binding of 1H8 to the E2 protein. however, the interaction of this mutated E2 with CD81 was not affected by the substitution. the detection with anti-Fc (13000 dilution) was served as a control. the x-axis indicates the different constructed E2-16Fc used in the assay. the shared residues, Y527 and W529, for binding of 1H8 likely provided the basis for the neutralizing activity exerted by 1H8. the binding site of 1H8 was immunogenic enough to elicit epitope-specific antibodies during natural HCV infection. step 1 step 2 step 3 WT (+) S528A (+) W529A (\u2013) 54.08% (53/98) 35.71% (35/98) 14.29% (14/98) Sequential steps for analyzing the data. hepatitis C patients could produce \u201c1H8-like\u201d neutralizing antibodies. the y-axis indicates the absorbance at 450 nm, representing the binding activity of the \u201c1H8-like\u201d antibodies in the samples from Patient H. if detectable, these antibodies are essentially ineffective in vivo, in spite of their neutralizing activity being demonstrated in vitro. the gene diversity of HCV has posed a great challenge to the generation of antibodies capable of neutralizing the various HCV genotypes. the conserved residues in the E2 protein that are directly involved in CD81-mediated virus entry would be reasonable targets to elicit neutralizing antibodies. observed a delayed production of \u201c1H8-like\u201d neutralizing antibody during HCV infection. the weak neutralizing antibody response to E2 protein in chronically infected patients was previously reported by others [9], [35]. some HCV variants, irrelevant to their genotypes, may be able to escape from \u201c1H8-like\u201d antibody-mediated neutralization during the course of natural infections. if substituted residues in the E2 protein are associated only with antibody recognition without affecting E2-CD81 interaction, we plan to perform experiments in an animal model."}
