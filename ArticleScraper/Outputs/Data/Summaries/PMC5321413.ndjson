{"summary": "population-based studies provide essential information for effective infection control and prevention. study examined Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence among a representative sample of 18-49-year-old residents in Hong Kong. a questionnaire on sexual practice and health was conducted and polymerase chain reaction was used to test urine for genital chlamydial infection. in 2014, over 1.4 million cases of chlamydia were reported to the CDC. it was estimated in 2008 that the lifetime direct medical cost of chlamydia had reached US$516.7 million. 80% of women with genital chlamydia is asymptomatic, but itself can be highly contagious and dangerous in terms of long-term health consequences. prevalence of casual sex could be as high as 20%, half unsafe sex without condoms. syphilis incidence has nearly tripled from 12.80 per 100,000 persons in 2006 to 31.85 per 100,000 in 2015 [24, 25]. STIs are not not notifiable locally. participants were drawn from randomly selected 79 primary sampling units based on theseDCCAs in proportion to the total number of DCCAs within each district. only one eligible subject per household was permitted to participate in the study in order to reduce intra-class correlation of family members from the same household. participants were asked to provide the first part of the urine stream in a given sample container for PCR testing. only those who had completed the questionnaire were considered successful recruits. PCR testing for Chlamydia trachomatis All the test samples were taken to the laboratory by the interviewers within a week to be tested for. the prevalence was calculated among all sexually experienced and sexually active participants with 95% confidence intervals (CI) the \u201csexually experienced\u201d were those reported ever having sex, while the \u201csexually active\u201d were those reported having one or more sex partners in the past 12 months. STI and sexual health survey (TeSSHS) was a population-based, geospatial representative household survey. participants were drawn from randomly selected 79 primary sampling units based on theseDCCAs in proportion to the total number of DCCAs within each district. only one eligible subject per household was permitted to participate in the study in order to reduce intra-class correlation of family members from the same household. the questionnaire was matched and appraised according to a review of reviews of STI/HIV risk factors among the Chinese population [32]. it covered areas regarding demographic information, health and health behaviours, sexual practice and sexual health as well as partner\u2019s travel history for female participants. the questionnaire was pilot-tested twice and modified before its launch. the CT but also could detect the new variant Chlamydia trachomatis (nvCT) 377bp deletion region. RT-PCR kit enabled the RT-PCR kit to detect the majority types of CT strains. the prevalence was calculated among all sexually experienced and sexually active participants. estimated for both \u201csexually experienced\u201d and \u201csexually active\u201d. multilevel analyses were performed to examine the homogeneity of CT prevalence in regions, categorised into Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula. the highest CT prevalence was found in the 18-26-year-old sexually active women (5.8%; 95% CI 1.7\u201318.2%), followed by 4.8% (95% CI 1.2\u201317.6%) in the sexually active men. the third highest group, however, was the 40-49-year-old sexually active women at 4.1% (95% CI 1.8\u20139.0%) in the previous 12 months, they were about eight times more likely to be infected with chlamydia. the other two risk factors for CT infection were younger age (18\u201326) and living alone, with aOR at 25.4 (95% CI 2.81\u2013230) and 8.99 (95% CI 1.46\u201355.4) respectively. the highest CT prevalence was found in the 18-26-year-old sexually active women. the third highest group, however, was the 40-49-year-old sexually active women at 4.1% (95% CI 1.8\u20139.0%), giving rise to a U-shape distribution curve. women whose partners had travelled out of Hong Kong in the previous 12 months were about eight times more likely to be infected with chlamydia. the other two risk factors for CT infection among sexually active females were younger age (18\u201326) and living alone, with aOR at 25.4 (95% CI 2.81\u2013230). the proportion of male and female aged 18\u201326 years old with wisex partners in the past 12 months were 2.6% (95% CI 0.9\u20137.2%) and 3.3% (95% CI 1.1\u20139.7%) in TeSSHS respectively. the consistent condom use reported in the general population is 24% (95% CI 21.84\u201326.16%). study identifies that the socioeconomic status and lifestyle of Hong Kong would be more comparable to that of developed countries [36]. study also identifies that CT is more common among young individuals in Hong Kong. a study with cross-border china-based male truck drivers in Hong Kong found CT prevalence at 4.6% using CT DNA testing [41], which is higher than the estimation in the sexually experience but lower than that of the sexually active young women. the combined prevalence of genital CT is reported to be as high as 17.7% in a sample of 2534 patients from 34 hospitals. the public facilities could be ideal sites for health promotion, education and screening for chlamydia. the public facilities could be ideal sites for health promotion, education and screening for chlamydia."}
