{"summary": "human coronavirus (HCoV) infections are typically mild, but with remarkable rare exceptions (1). before 2003, only two coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were known to infect humans, and both produce mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract illnesses. in early 2003, outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with unknown cause. MERS-CoV represents a new species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. by early June 2013, there were 55 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections with 31 (56%) deaths. of the six coronaviruses known to infect humans, four are endemic and cause mild upper respiratory illnesses. coronaviruses can be regarded as middle-ranking in terms of the ability to generate point mutations in viral genome during the process of virus replication. the wide distribution of coronaviruses in diverse avian and mammalian species poses a threat to humans. coronaviruses have evolved into two lineages (25) the avian lineage comprises gamma and delta coronaviruses. all coronaviruses circulating in humans are believed to be evolved from mammalian coronaviruses. it has been estimated that HCoV-OC43 was transmitted to humans about 120 years ago. bats and SARS-CoV Coronaviruses have been detected from a number of bat species. the one most closely related to SARS-CoV was found in horseshoe bats (30) the key difference between bat SARS-Like CoV and human SARS-CoV lies in the spike protein which is the receptor binding protein. no SARS-CoV has been identified in bats and bats do not have the appropriate receptor (ACE2) for SARS-CoV. a number of studies have tried to detect SARS-CoV from animals. the positive rate for SARS-CoV among civet cats was as high as 100% in markets. the sequence of CoV detected from raccoon dog was identical to those from civet cats. other animals in markets tested positive for CoV included domestic cat, red fox, Lesser rice field rat, goose, Chinese ferret-badger and wild boar."}
