{"summary": "study was determined to be part of the public health response to the imported case of MHF and follow-up of contacts. a 41-year-old woman showed development of chills and high fever. she was placed in a general ward among other patients, without specific contact precautions. instructions for contacts of a person with marburg hemorrhagic fever, by risk contact group, the Netherlands, 2008*. you had or might have had unprotected contact (without PPE) with the blood or body fluids of the patient. you are strongly advised not to leave the country during the monitoring period of 3 weeks after the last possible contact with the patient or patient body fluids (date). disinfect the thermometer with 70% alcohol after every use and wash your hands with soap and water. variables and instruments Questionnaire We recorded personal characteristics of respondents and any symptoms during the monitoring period. the questionnaire addressed understanding of control measures, clarity of instructions, reported compliance with measures, and perceived interference with daily life (e.g., restrictions on social life, difficulties with control measures, extra costs incurred, and fear of becoming infected) items were scored on a Likert scale of 0\u20134 (0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 3, quite a bit; 4, extremely), which added up to a maximum score of 88. a score >20 was considered an indicator of posttraumatic stress disorder (14,15) testing was performed by using an immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay. tests were performed at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (Hamburg, Germany) monitoring contacts were set at 21 days after the last contact with the patient or patient body fluids. the public health service traced the contacts in the community. contacts were provided with written instructions. instructions on control measures during monitoring period Inform your health care provider if you use temperature-lowering medications. you are strongly advised not to leave the country during the monitoring period of 3 weeks after the last possible contact with the patient. variables and instruments Questionnaire We recorded personal characteristics of respondents and any symptoms during the monitoring period. the questionnaire addressed understanding of control measures, clarity of instructions, reported compliance with measures, and perceived interference with daily life. items were scored on a Likert scale of 0\u20134 (0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 3, quite a bit; 4, extremely), which added up to a maximum score of 88. the questionnaire addressed understanding of control measures, clarity of instructions, reported compliance with measures, and perceived interference with daily life. items were scored on a Likert scale of 0\u20134 (0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 3, quite a bit; 4, extremely), which added up to a maximum score of 88. recalled stress during the monitoring period (IES during) and persisting stress during the 7 days before the completion of the questionnaire (IES after) the same model was constructed by using the IES after the monitoring period as a dependent variable and personal characteristics (sex, education, age), risk level, clarity of instructions scale, compliance scale, and interference scale as independent variables. 78 (60.0%) completed the questionnaire. high-risk contact, n = 45, no. (%) Low-risk contact, n = 32, no.

Explicitness, completeness, unambiguity, confusion, and redundancy. the high-risk group had more women (33/45, 73.3%) than the low-risk group (13/32, 40.6%) (p = 0.004) and had a lower education level (Table 2). Respondents were comparable to nonrespondents with respect to sex. 60 (77.9%) were aware of the request not to leave the country. reasons given for negative answers were no direct contact with the patient and thus no risk. reasons given for negative answers were no direct contact with the patient. 61 respondents, 45 (73.7%) found this information to be clear, 40 (65.6%) complete, 37 (60.6%) unequivocal, 4 (6.5%) confusing, and 3 (5.0%) redundant. compliance with measures Of 45 respondents who were prohibited from traveling (high-risk group), 17 (37.7%) had planned a holiday trip abroad, of whom 12 (70.6%) cancelled the holiday trip during the surveillance period. the t distribution with 75 = 45 + 32 \u2013 2 df is almost identical with that of a normal distribution. the t distribution with 75 = 45 + 32 \u2013 2 df is almost identical with that of a normal distribution. the prohibition on leaving the country was perceived as difficult by 18 (23.4%) of 77. of 77 respondents, 28 (36.4%) reported that their family members were disturbed by control measures. 31 (40.3%) of 77 reported that their family members expressed anxiety about becoming infected. 25 (32.5%) of 77 reported that their partners were disturbed by restrictive control measures. variables during monitoring IES score after monitoring B (SE) p value B (SE) p value Constant 4.73 (0.75) 2.62 (0.59) Sex 0.11 (0.14) 0.446 0.10 (0.11) 0.349 Education 0.14 (0.08) 0.103 0.17 (0.06) 0.015 Age 0.02 (0.05) 0.714 0.04 (0.04) 0.372 Risk category 0.06 (0.16) 0.742 0.06 (0.13) 0.663 Compliance scale 0.10 (0.08) 0.296 78.1%) of 64 in the high-risk group and 35 (53.0%) of 66 in the low-risk group were negative for IgG and IgM against Marburg virus. participants in both risk contact groups will discuss implications for persons who adhere to control measures. compliance with control measures was reported as difficult to include in daily life. control measures had a substantial psychological effect on contacts and members of their household. we found the interference scale score to be the main predictor of perceived stress, suggesting that the disturbance experienced in daily life determines the magnitude of the psychological effect. despite the limitations of IFA (32), serologic findings strongly suggest that none of the contacts who provided a blood sample had become asymptomatically infected. the strengths of this study are systematic evaluation of compliance with measures and interference of measures with daily life."}
