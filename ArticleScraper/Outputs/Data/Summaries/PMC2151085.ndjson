{"summary": "new studies have examined the chemical basis for receptor activation of avian retrovirus envelope glycoproteins. they show that receptor binding creates a reactive cysteine thiolate in the surface subunit that is essential for infection that is not accounted for by current models of Env function. a helical bundle containing the fusion peptide is exposed and inserts into target cell and/or virus membranes. it is proposed that formation of the helical bundle functions as a zipper to bring virus and cell membranes into proximity and to promote membrane lipid exchange. in support of the spring-loaded model, elevated temperature or chemical denaturing agents mimic the actions of physiological factors in triggering helical bundle formation. the studies of HIV and MLV infection indicate the existence of multi-step triggering mechanisms. receptor binding is necessary but not sufficient for infection. receptor binding induces formation of a cysteine thiolate (Cys-S) in SU that is required for infection. particles were mildly sensitive to PMB, and this effect was not altered by the presence of sTva. similar results were obtained with the thiol-reactive reagents DTNB and PEO-iodoacetyl biotin. these findings strongly suggest the existence of functionally important cysteine thiolate(s) in ALV-A. SU Contains the Cys-S Target for Modification by PMB. to identify the PMB target, Env was recovered from lysates of PMB-treated ALV-A by immunoprecipitation using an anti-TM antibody. SU and TM were the predominant targets for covalent modification by SNB. SU was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against the C-terminus of TM. biotinylated proteins were detected with streptavidin-HRP. mass spectrometry identified three peptides from SU containing NEM-modified cysteine residues. peptide fragments containing 97% of all residues in SU were identified. these results concludesively demonstrate that Cys-S residues in SU are targets for sTva-dependent modification by thiol-reactive agents. mutant Envs in which the Cys residues in SU including Cys38, Cys292 and Cys309 were replaced with serine were prepared and analysed. Env in these cells rapidly restored production of fully infectious virus. evidence from both chemical and genetic-based analyses indicates that Env Cys38-S is essential for ALV-A infection. each cysteine in SU was individually mutated to serine. 293 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of SU-A IgG (squares) or Cys38Ser SU-A IgG (circles) for 1 h on ice. cells were washed, stained with an Oregon green 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. on ice, 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, pH 8.0, and then at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min at pH 5.0. the samples were neutralized, reduced, and assayed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot for formation of TM oligomer. in the absence of sTva, exposure of wild type or Cys38Ser virus particles did not trigger formation of the SDS-resistant TM oligomer. samples were reduced with DTT and resolved by SDS-PAGE without boiling. only the 90-kDa isoform of TM indicative of TM trimer is shown. we tested the ability of the R99 peptide inhibitor of ALV infection to block its formation. the effect of Cys38Ser on the temperature threshold for oligomer formation was measured. sTva binding reduced the threshold temperature for oligomer formation to 53 \u00b0C. this property was not Cys38-dependent in mutant Env. SU and TM are covalently linked by a disulfide bond. exposure of virus particles to sTva and/or low pH did not alter the composition of viral proteins identified by anti-SU and anti-TM antibodies. however, analysis under reducing conditions confirmed that sTva/low pH triggered the conversion of TM into an SDS-resistant oligomer (75 kDa) the Env of these viruses, like that of ALV, are class I fusion proteins. to test the hypothesis that Cys38-S is the active site of an intrinsic cysteine protease that resides in ALV Env, we measured ALV-A infection in the presence of E-64. E-64 treatment of virus before and/or during exposure to Tva, low pH, and target membranes did not detectably alter infectivity under conditions that blocked Ebola GP-dependent entry the pH of the sample was brought to 7.5 and formation of virus-liposome complexes was assessed by density gradient centrifugation. the liposomes migrated to the top of the gradient where they are visible and virions (located by immunoblot for virus capsid p27) virions floated to the top of the gradient with the liposomes. these studies indicate that receptor activation of the membrane-associated pre-hairpin and R99 sensitive bundle-containing conformations of TM are not dependent on Cys38-S activity. the role of Cys38 in fusion was tested further by measuring Env-dependent cell\u2013cell fusion and syncytia formation. syncytia formation mediated by wild type ALV-A Env is between pH 6.2 and 6.8. however, exposure of co-cultured cells to chlorpromazine did not rescue the Cys38Ser-imposed defect. these experiments confirm that Env lacking Cys38 is defective in cell membrane fusion. er virus particles were labeled with 1 mM PMB in the presence and absence of sTva at neutral pH. sTva-dependent PMB modification of SU was observed on wild type and mutant particles lacking Cys38. the chemically unrelated thiol-specific alkylating agent, PEO-iodoacetyl biotin also mediates this effect. s38Ser virus was exposed to increasing concentrations of PMB in the presence or absence of 10 M sTva. thiol-specific alkylating reagent, PEO-maleimide biotin, was used to probe functionally important thiolates in ALV-A. infectivity was measured on human 293 cells expressing the ALV receptor Tva (293-Tva) virus titers were determined by endpoint dilution after spinoculation on 293-mCAT cells. the suspected PMB target is the ALV-A Env glycoprotein. the effect of PMB treatment in the presence of sTva reduced infectivity to less than 0.001%. modification of ALV-A Env by PMB was Tva-dependent and limited to a single 70 kDa viral protein. the apparent molecular weight of the PMB-modified protein was reduced from 70 kDa to 45 kDa by treatment to remove N-linked glycans using the enzyme PNGase F. Identification of Essential Cys-S Residues in ALV-A Env To identify the cysteine thiolate targets in ALV-SU, LCQ-MS/MS was performed. SU was purified from virions that were incubated with the thiol-alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), in presence of sTva. DF-1 cells producing ALV-A Cys38Ser particles were maintained in culture for months without reverting to infectious virus. transient expression of wild type ALV-A Env in these cells quickly restored production of fully infectious virus. DF-1 cells producing ALV-A Cys38Ser particles were maintained in culture for months without reverting to infectious virus. immunoadhesins comprised of wild type or Cys38Ser ALV-A SU fused in-frame to the constant region of a rabbit immunoglobulin gamma chain (SUA-rIgG) were produced in 293 cells, purified by protein A affinity chromatography, and used as ligands. the binding profile of Cys38Ser SUA-rIgG for 293-Tva cells is indistinguishable from wild type SUA exposure of the Tva-bound Env to endosomal acid pH alters inter-subunit contacts and releases metastable TM to undergo the conformational change that is coupled to membrane fusion. previous studies have shown that helical bundle formation can be monitored by the formation of an SDS-resistant TM oligomer [6,15,16] ALV-A (WT, top panel) or Cys38Ser virus was incubated with or without sTva at the indicated pH in the presence or absence of the R99 inhibitory peptide. samples were reduced with DTT and resolved by SDS-PAGE without boiling. peptide containing two proline substitutions in R99 does not inhibit ALV-A infection. the presence of R99 significantly inhibited the formation of the SDS-resistant TM oligomer from both wild type and mutant viruses. however, the peptide had no effect (Figure 5A) a critical reactive thiol has also been identified in MLV SU. tests have provided evidence that the essential function of the critical MLV thiol is as a nucleophile in receptor-induced isomerization of the disulfide bond linking SU and TM. a potential consequence of this step is release constraints imposed by SU on membrane fusion by TM. SU-TM disulfide bond is not disrupted upon Env Triggering by Receptor and low pH. ALV-A was incubated with or without sTva at pH 8.0 for 20 min on ice. then for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C at pH 5.0 (+ acid) or pH 7.4 ( acid) SU and TM remain covalently linked after receptor/low pH activation of TM. this strongly suggests that Cys38-S is not the active site of papain-like protease activity that is required for infection. to address this question, the requirements for wild type and mutant ALV-A particles to associate with liposome targets was measured. the density of the virus-liposome complex was increased by a 10 min incubation of virus-liposome complexes at pH 5.0 (Figure 7A) or pH 5.5. this effect of low pH was Tva-dependent and blocked by R99 peptide. this effect of low pH was blocked by the R99 peptide. cells were washed and incubated at pH 5.5 for 15 min to activate Env-Tva complexes. DF-1 cells producing ALV-A Cys38Ser did not fuse with target cells after incubation at pH 5.5. similar results were obtained using 293-Tva cells that express much higher levels of Tva than DF-1 cells. tia formation is indicated by large, multi-nucleated cells with diffuse EGFP fluorescence and R18 positive membranes. cell cultures from B were dissociated with versene and analyzed by flow cytometry for R18 and EGFP expression. shown is the percentage of double positive cells, indicative of cell\u2013cell fusion, for each condition. ALV-A was incubated with or without the indicated concentrations of sTva for 20 min on ice at pH 8.0. samples were then exposed to 1 mM PMB (+) or buffer at the indicated pH for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. the entry of retroviruses into cells is initiated by binding of virus Env to cell surface receptor proteins. SU found that receptor binding induces a conformational change in SU that creates a CysS target that is inaccessible or unreactive in native Env. this indicates that receptor binding enhances the sensitivity of ALV SU to thermolysin cleavage. the absence of a detectable influence of Cys38 on Env maturation and the receptor-dependence of reactive thiol strongly suggests that Cys38-S mediates a post-receptor step. current models indicate that the critical post-receptor step is activation of TM. neither insertion of TM peptide into target membranes nor assembly of TM into helical bundles is Cys38-S-dependent. in this assay, brief exposure to pH 5.0 or to 5.5 was associated with apparent increase in the density of sTva-induced virus-liposome complexes. this change in density may reflect the dissociation of capsid from the liposome-associated particle. isomerization of the ALV SU-TM disulfide bond was not induced by binding to Tva or subsequent activation of TM. a second possibility is that the absence of Cys38-S results in changes in TM activation that are not detected by our assays. the failure of chlorpromazine to rescue the fusion defect of the Cys38Ser mutant suggests that fusion is blocked prior to hemifusion. the observation that thiol alkylation inhibits infection is consistent with an intrinsic enzymatic activity in SU. more extensive investigation of the integrity of Env upon fusion with cells using radiolabeled proteins may identify cleavage products that were not generated or apparent in our in vitro studies. a third possibility is that Cys-38-S is part of the active site of phospholipase or forms thioester adducts with fatty acids in the target membrane. human 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC. DF-1-ALV-A cells produce a replication-competent ALV-A encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (RCASBP(A)-EGFP, DF-1-ALV-A), a 293-derived cell line that expresses Tva (293-Tva or 2.1) supernatants were harvested twice a day, and individual collections were pooled until 1 L of supernatant accumulated. supernatants were pre-cleared by low speed centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-m filters to remove cells and cell debris. Virus was concentrated by pelleting through a sucrose cushion for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0C at 113,000 x g (max) the pH of the concentrated solutions (pH 8.0) was verified prior to addition to the virus. samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, cooled on ice, serially diluted in growth medium supplemented with 40 mM HEPES. the samples were then neutralized with 1 M HEPES, pH 8.0, lysed with 1% SDS. liposomes were created from a mixture of a 1:1:1:1.5 molar ratio of phoshatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. the mixture was then rehydrated with HN buffer by shaking for 1 hour, sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 10 min, and extruded 25 times with an Avanti mini-extruder. samples were neutralized, exposed to 100 nM sTva for 20 min on ice. samples were then exposed to 1 mM PMB or buffer at the indicated pH for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. immunoblots were then stripped with SDS/DTT and probed for SU. mass spectrometry analysis of SU. Concentrated ALV-A was thawed on ice, and sTva was added to 5 M. the sample was then concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. the pellet was dried, re-suspended in SDS-PAGE loading dye. mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. mutation was confirmed in cells infected with filtered virus. ation of mutant virus purified from supernatant by centrifugation was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using the antibody against the carboxyl-terminus of TM. SU-A IgG expression construct was a gift from J. A. T. Young (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) [38]. cells were washed twice with PBS/1% FBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG. cells were stained with 0.8 g/ml R18 in growth media for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. syncytia identified as large, multi-nucleated cells with diffuse EGFP fluorescence and R18 positive membranes. human 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC. syncytia were identified as large, multi-nucleated cells. anti-SU mAB mc8C5 was obtained from the hybridoma facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. supernatants were harvested twice a day, and individual collections were pooled until 1 L of supernatant accumulated. affinity purified rabbit antisera against the C-terminus of TM (TM-1) has been described previously. a previously described plasmid encoding ALV-A Env (pAB6-Env A) was substituted for the MLV Env-encoding plasmid in the transfection [15]. sTva was purified from E. coli as previously described. a small volume of HN buffer supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 (HNC) and incubated for 20 minutes on ice with the indicated concentration of sTva. the samples were then neutralized with 1 M HEPES, pH 8.0, lysed with 1% SDS, and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. sTva was mixed with liposomes with or without 100 nM sTva on ice. the peptides were dissolved in HN buffer, added to the virus/liposome/sTva mixtures to a final concentration of 100 M. samples were then adjusted to the indicated pH and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C prior to neutralization. samples were quenched with a molar excess of cysteine-HCl (PMB) or glycine (SNB) samples were lysed with NP-40 and immunoprecipitated with the antibody against the C-terminus of TM using Protein A beads (Pierce) the SU sample was reduced, alkylated, and digested with protease. mutagenesis and production of stable cell lines were generated by PCR mutagenesis using overlapping primers. initial PCR products were subcloned into a shuttle vector. EGFP-positive clones were periodically tested to confirm the noninfectious phenotype by co-culture with uninfected DF-1 cells or by analyzing DF-1 cells exposed to filtered supernatant for acquired EGFP expression. the presence of the mutation was again confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the provirus in the transfected cells. the column was washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 and eluted with 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0. peak fractions were identified by immunoblot, pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated using a microcon device. samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr at 179,000 x g (ave) using a TLA 100.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter) Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using antisera against Rous sarcoma virus Prague C.
