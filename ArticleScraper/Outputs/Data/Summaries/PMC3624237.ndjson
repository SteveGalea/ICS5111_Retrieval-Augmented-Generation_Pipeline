{"summary": "there are 34 known viruses belonging to the genus Nairovirus of family Bunyaviridae. the most lethal to humans is endemic across large swaths of sub-saharan Africa, southeast Europe, and Asia. CCHFV, the most lethal to humans, is endemic across large swaths of sub-saharan Africa, southeast Europe, and Asia. ERVEV was isolated from the white-toothed shrew in 1982. the genome of nairoviruses is partitioned into three RNA segments. unlike other Bunyaviridae family members, the nairoviruses' L segment contains not only a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase but also a viral ovarian tumor domain protease homologue (vOTU) noncanonical forms of poly-Ub\u2014linear and K6, -11, -27, -29, and -33\u2014comprise over half of all poly-Ub-conjugated yeast proteins. Specifically, K29-linked poly-Ub is known to facilitate trafficking proteins to the lysosome, whereas K11-linked poly-Ub has been implicated in regulating cell division. regulation of the IFNI response and activation of NF-B has been shown to go beyond phosphorylation events. however, regulation of the IFNI response and activation of NF-B relies on posttranslational modification by Ub and Ub-like IFN-simulated gene product 15 (ISG15) (32). turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus (TYMV) and arteriviruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) have spurred speculation of whether their vOTUs' specificity and subsequent role is conserved. vOTUs from nairoviruses and how they may compare to non-nairovirus vOTUs were examined. the ERVEV vOTU expression construct contained the first 171 amino acids from the L protein of DUGV (GenBank AFH89032.1) the first 171 amino acids from the L protein in ERVEV (GenBank AFH89032.1) correspond to the first 169 amino acids of CCHF vOTU and DUG vOTU. six histidines and a stop codon were added to ERVE vOTU constructs. constructs of expression plasmids for truncated human Ub (hUb) to be modified with 3-bromopropylamine were designed according to previously established studies. the vOTUs are from Dugbe virus (DUGV; GenBank accession no. AAB18834.1); Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV; GenBank accession no. AAQ98866.2); Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV; GenBank HFV, DUGV, ERVEV, and TYMV, as well as mISG15, were grown at 37\u00b0C in 6 liters of Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 g of ampicillin/ml. the culture was further grown for 4 h at 37\u00b0C and then centrifuged at 6,000 g for 10 min. the cells were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the clarified extract was filtered with a 0.80-m-pore-size filter. resuspension was rocked gently overnight at 4\u00b0C. resulting hUb thioester was derivatized with 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide. the complete coding regions for all mutant enzymes were sequenced by GenScript, Inc., or Eton Bioscience, Inc. Fluorescent vOTU deubiquitination and deISGylation assays were performed in duplicate in buffer D. the rates of the reactions were observed using an Infinite M1000 series plate reader (Tecan, Inc.) CCHF vOTU and associated mutants were used against hISG15-AMC, hUb-AMC, and ZRLRGG-AMC. the enzyme concentrations for CCHF vOTU and associated mutants were the same concentrations as those of DUG vOTU. ERVE vOTU's Vmax and Km values for hUb-AMC and hISG15-AMC were determined maintaining an enzyme concentration of 125 nM while the hUb-AMC concentration was varied from 0 to 51 M. an enzyme concentration of 4 nM was maintained while the hISG15-AMC concentration was varied from 0 to 51 M. vOTUs from CCHFV (100 nM), DUGV (100 nM), ERVEV (2.6 M), TYMV (20 nM) were incubated with each vOTU (4 nM CCHF vOTU, 4 nM DUG vOTU, 100 nM ERVE vOTU and 6. the reactions were stopped at various times of > 1 h by mixing 9 l of each reaction with 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate-Tricine sample buffer, followed by boiling at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the results were visualized on 10 to 20% Mini-Protean Tris-Tricine precast gels (Bio-Rad) DUG vOTU-Ub was concentrated in a GE Vivaspin 6 10-kDa MWCO concentrator. filtered using a 0.22-m-pore-size Costar spin filter. initial phase solution was elucidated using a homology model. the structure was refined using iterative cycles of model building and refinement using COOT and REFMAC respectively (45, 46). the final model was checked for structural quality using the CCP4 suite programs Procheck and Sfcheck. vOTUs from TYMV, ERVEV, and DUGV (TYM vOTU, ERVE vOTU, and DUG vOTU) were generated using the Escherichia coli BL21 codon optimized synthesis by GenScript, Inc. DUG vOTU, TYM vOTU, and ERVE vOTU were incorporated into pET11a plasmids using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. heat shock transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells. plasmids were purified, restriction analyzed, and sequenced to verify the construct. DSSP is shown as gray cylinders (helical regions), pink arrows (-sheets) and gray lines (loops) breaks denote regions were DUG vOTU does not have residues. orange brackets indicate residues involved in a backbone shift between CCHFV and DUGV. expression and purification of vOTUs and Ub-Br3 was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.8 mM hydrochloride(TCEP-HCl), and buffer B contained 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) all final protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an experimentally determined extinction coefficient (43). hUb(1-75) was expressed according to previously established protocols. CCHF vOTU and DUG vOTU genes were created by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis according to manufacturer's protocol. mutant plasmids were introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells by heat shock transformation. 15-AMC (hISG15-AMC) and ZRLRGG-AMC (Bachem) substrates were monitored for each of the vOTUs. the extinction coefficients were determined by adding excess vOTU to various concentrations of each substrate. used to cleave hISG15-AMC, hUb-AMC, and ZRLRGG-AMC respectively. to determine the DUG vOTU's Vmax and Km values for hUb-AMC, the concentration was maintained at 2 M enzyme while the hUb-AMC concentration was varied from 0 to 75 M. each di-Ub FRET substrate at 1 M was evaluated against an enzyme concentration of 2 nM (CCHF and DUG vOTU), 125 nM (ERVE vOTU), or 500 nM (TYM vOTU). each di-Ub FRET substrate at 1 M was evaluated against an enzyme concentration of 2 nM (CCHF and DUG vOTU), 125 nM (ERVE vOTU) dimeric-Ub substrates (10 M) were incubated with each vOTU (4 nM CCHF vOTU, 4 nM DUG vOTU, 100 nM ERVE vOTU, and 6 M TYM vOTU) in reaction buffer F (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 2 mM DTT) at 37\u00b0C. vOTU-Ub was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer G (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) and purified using a GE Mono-Q column with a linear gradient of buffer G to buffer H (1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]. an X-ray data set was collected using a crystal mounted onto a nylon loop flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. the frozen crystal was mounted under a stream of dry N2 at 100\u00b0K. X-ray images were indexed, processed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (44) set 567 Rwork (%) 21.0 Rfree (%) 27.8 RMSD Bond length () 0.01 Bond angle (\u00b0) 1.2 No. of protein/water atoms 3,706/46 Avg B-factors (2) Total 20.8 Protein 20.8 Water 12.9 Ions 41.6 a Rmerge = hI |II(h) I(h)>|/hi> II(h), where II(h) is the ith measurement and I(h)> vOTUs of ERVEV and TYMV have a substantially more robust activity toward this substrate than those of CCHFV and DUGV. CCHF vOTU cleaves the hUb-AMC 5-fold faster than its hISG15-AMC counterpart (17) TYM vOTU has 6-fold higher activity for ZRLRGG-AMC versus hUb-AMC and 30-fold more than hISG15-AMC. cleavage activities of vOTUs from CCHFV, DUGV, and TYMV were determined. errors represent standard deviations from the average. ERVE vOTU has the highest catalytic efficiency for hISG15 of any known to vOTU. saturating concentrations of hUb-AMC are beyond the maximum substrate concentrations achievable. saturating conditions of the hUb-AMC substrate are beyond the maximum substrate concentrations achievable. vOTUs of DUGV, CCHFV, and ERVEV were assessed for their ability to cleave the eight different linkage types of poly-Ub, K6, K11, K27, K33, K48, K63, and linear, side by side. only nanomolar quantities were necessary to observe poly-Ub cleavage within a 60-min time frame. all four vOTUs have a relatively clear preference for K6 poly-Ub linkages. CCHF vOTU appears to favor K63 poly-Ub linkage (17) samples were heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then run on a 10 to 20% mini-protean tris-Tricine precast gels. the bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie blue. a quantitative approach was used to understand the extent of the differences for these two substrates. TYM vOTU and ERVE vOTU cleaved poly-Ub linkage substrates poorly. the two vOTUs had 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less activity than vOTUs from CCHFV and DUGV. a K11 FRET substrate was subsequently used to gauge the cleavage rates of the four vOTUs. a 20 M concentration of each tri-Ub linkage was incubated with either 4 nM CCHF vOTU, 4 nM DUG vOTU, 100 nM ERVE vOTU, or 6 M TYM vOTU at 37\u00b0C for an hour. the samples were heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then run on a 10 to 20% mini-protean tris-Tricine precast gels. vOTU inhibited by ca. 30% at the same mISG15 concentration. previous structural elucidation suggested that CCHF vOTU's ability to cleave hISG15 was primarily the result of the orientation in which CCHF vOTU bound to its hUb or hISG15 substrate (16, 17, 47) this suggested that vOTUs might possess deISGylating activity. CCHF vOTU is comprised of a core of seven -sheets flanked by five -helices and three 310-helices with an additional antiparallel sheet, 2a. DUG vOTU appears to accommodate hUb in the same manner as CCHF vOTU, suggesting that DUG vOTU employs no overtly tertiary structure rearrangement. hUb or hISG15 does highlight two variances between the vOTUs. one is the 3-4 loop, which encompasses DUG vOTU residues 121 to 126. this loop has a higher than average B-factor in both structures of vOTUs. side chains of these two amino acids appear to insert into hydrophobic patches on hUb and internally on CCHF vOTU. wall-eyed stereo views of interactions between CCHF vOTU and CCHF vOTU. DUG vOTU 3-chimera's ability to cleave the hUb-AMC conjugate decreases significantly. glu128, which in CCHF vOTU forms hydrogen bonds with hISG15's Asn89 and Lys90, is absent in DUG vOTU because the glutamate is replaced by a threonine. however, replacement of this glutamate in CCHF vOTU to a threon a glycine in CCHF vOTU's Ser101 was mutated to glycine. a reduction in activity toward all assessed substrates of >60% was found. CCHF vOTU's Thr102 appears to be twisted in relation to the corresponding residue in DUGV via surrounding hydrophobic environment created by Ile118. nairovirus vOTUs from CCHFV, DUGV, and ERVEV were evaluated for their ability to remove 7-amino-4-methylcourmarin (AMC) from the C terminus of 1 M hUb-AMC, hISG15-AMC, or a peptide that contains the last five highly conserved amino of hISG15 and hUb (ZRLRGG-AMC; Fig. 2). four vOTUs were assessed against the ZRLRGG-AMC conjugate. the vOTUs of ERVEV and TYMV have a substantially more robust activity toward this substrate than those of CCHFV and DUGV. the other three vOTUs have widely divergent activities from CCHF vOTU toward these two substrates. TYM vOTU has 6-fold higher activity for ZRLRGG-AMC versus hUb-AMC. cleavage activities of vOTUs from CCHFV, DUGV, and TYMV were determined. errors represent standard deviations from the average. ERVE vOTU has the highest catalytic efficiency for hISG15 of any known to vOTU. saturating conditions of hUb-AMC are beyond the maximum substrate concentrations achievable. saturating conditions of the hUb-AMC substrate are beyond the maximum substrate concentrations achievable. vOTUs of DUGV, CCHFV, and ERVEV were assessed for their ability to cleave the eight different linkage types of poly-Ub, K6, K11, K27, K33, K48, K63, and linear, side by side. only nanomolar quantities were necessary to observe poly-Ub cleavage within a 60-min time frame. all four vOTUs have a relatively clear preference for K6 poly-Ub linkages. CCHF vOTU appears to favor K63 poly-Ub linkage (17), but the other three seem to favor K48 poly-Ub linkages. samples were incubated with either 4 nM CCHFV, 4 nM DUGV, 100 nM ERVEV, or 6 M TYMV at 37\u00b0C for an hour. samples were heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then run on a 10 to 20% mini-Protean Tris-Tricine precast gels. the bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie blue. TYM vOTU and ERVE vOTU cleaved poly-Ub linkage substrates poorly. two vOTUs had 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less activity than vOTUs from CCHFV and DUGV. vOTU preference for FRET poly-Ub linkage substrates, as well as human and mouse ISG15. a 20 M concentration of each tri-Ub linkage was incubated with either 4 nM CCHF vOTU, 4 nM DUG vOTU, 100 nM ERVE vOTU, or 6 M TYM vOTU at 37\u00b0C for an hour. samples were heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then run on a 10 to 20% mini-protean tris-Tricine precast gels. erVE vOTU is inhibited by ca. 30% at the same mISG15 concentration. this suggests affinity for certain species' ISG15s may vary among nairovirus vOTUs. a significant divergence in their preference between hUb and hISG15 conjugates was observed. CCHF vOTU and CCHF vOTU in complex with hUb adopted a comparable fold. CCHF vOTU is comprised of a core of seven -sheets flanked by five -helices and three 310-helices with an additional antiparallel sheet, 2a, formed between residues 100 to 102 of the protease. CCHF vOTU bound to either hUb or hISG15 does highlight two variances between the vOTUs. one is the 3-4 loop, which encompasses DUG vOTU residues 121 to 126. this loop has a higher than average B-factor in both structures of vOTUs. TU possesses not only a leucine at position 81 but also a valine at position 82. the hydrophobic side chains of these two amino acids appear to insert into hydrophobic patches on hUb and internally on CCHF vOTU. lix chimera possesses a relatively significant increase of 150% activity for hISG15-AMC. however, the ability to cleave the hUb-AMC conjugate decreases significantly, suggesting other primary structural elements are necessary to confer robust deISGylating activity. however, these bonds are absent in DUG vOTU because the glutamate is replaced by a threonine. mutants of CCHF vOTU (light gray) or DUG vOTU (dark gray) were determined at 1 M against 1 M hUb-AMC (a and d), 1 M hISG15-AMC (b and e), or 50 M ZRLRLGG-AMC (c and f) position 101 was identified as a potential key residue. the serine at this position in the structure of CCHF vOTU partially comprises 2a that residue in DUGV via surrounding hydrophobic environment created by Ile118, Ile131, and Phe133. this twist results in fixing the orientation of Ser101 in manner that the side chain points toward CCHF vOTU's bound substrate. DUG vOTU's Glu10 is within hydrogen bonding range of Arg87 in hISG15. nairovirus vOTUs and bound hUb and other OTU superfamily members are conserved. mutation of Q16R and P77D was shown to ablate CCHF vOTU affinity for hUb and hISG15, respectively (16, 47) however, these conserved sites do not solely indicate substrate preference. CCHF vOTU residue Glu128, which is a glycine in a CCHFV strain, UG3010, exemplifies this point by suggesting that even vOTUs that harbor polymorphisms can have considerably divergent enzymatic behavior. these structures have limitations in directly revealing any specifics on what may drive nairovirus vOTUs to cleave only K6, K11, K48, and K63 poly- vOTUs from arteriviruses, such as PRRSV, have not been evaluated against all eight poly-Ub types of linkages. this could suggest arteriviruses may also have activity toward K6 and K48 poly-Ubs. this could suggest arteriviruses may also have activity toward K6 and K48 poly-Ubs. nairovirus vOTUs from CCHFV, DUGV, and ERVEV may have proposed. nairovirus vOTUs do not always possess robust dual human deubiquitinating and deISGylating functionality. the preference of nairovirus vOTUs could be either for human ubiquitinated substrates, ISGylated ones, or both. erVE vOTU shares deISGylating functionality with CCHF vOTU. the two vOTUs respond differently when mISG15 is used as a competitive inhibitor. this diversity has previously been linked to influenza virus B's ability of NS1 to specifically bind ISG15 of human or nonhuman primate origin. CCHF vOTU appears to be unique among the three evaluated nairovirus vOTUs for its ability to robustly cleave K63 poly-Ub linkages. CCHF vOTU is also the most specific to the four poly-Ub linkages. evaluated vOTUs prevailingly cleave vOTUs. this suggests a virus containing a vOTU capable of not only deubiquitinase and species-specific deISGylase activities but also robust deubiquitinase activity toward K63 poly-Ub links might have the best chance for viral immune evasion and pathogenesis. CCHF vOTU affinity for hUb and hISG15 appears to be synergistic. residues such as Thr102 in CCHF vOTU seem necessary for the positive influence of serine at the preceding position. however, single unfavorable amino acid changes within nairovirus vOTUs can have deleterious effects. nairovirus vOTUs cleave only K6, K11, K48, and K63 poly-Ub linkages. differences between nairovirus vOTUs and other vOTUs are likely structural in nature. vOTUs from arteriviruses, such as PRRSV, have not been evaluated against all eight poly-Ub types of linkages. vOTUs from arteriviruses, such as PRRSV, have not been evaluated against all eight poly-Ub types of linkages. this suggests arteriviruses may also have activity toward K6 and K48 poly-Ubs. nairovirus vOTUs do not always possess robust dual human deubiquitinating and deISGylating functionality with a preference for ubiquitinated substrates. the preference of nairovirus vOTUs potentially could be either for human ubiquitinated substrates, ISGylated ones, or both. mice unable to respond to IFNI developed a disease mimicking several aspects of the clinical course of CCHF in humans. the significantly reduced affinity of CCHF vOTU for mISG15 suggests that ERVE vOTU has a higher affinity for mISG15 and is possibly less selective for particular species ISG15. CCHF vOTU appears to be unique among the three evaluated nairovirus vOTUs for its ability to robustly cleave both hUb and hISG15. this is in contrast to other known viral deubiquitinases, such as herpesvirus M48, or vOTUs from other nairoviruses. this is in contrast to other known viral deubiquitinases, such as herpesvirus M48, deubiquitinase activity toward K63 poly-Ub linkages might have the best chance for viral immune evasion and pathogenesis. e and species-specific deISGylase activities but also robust deubiquitinase activity toward K63 poly-Ub linkages might have the best chance for viral pathogenesis."}
