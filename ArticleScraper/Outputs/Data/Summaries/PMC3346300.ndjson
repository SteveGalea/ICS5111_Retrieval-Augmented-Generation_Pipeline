{"summary": "previous pandemic influenza viruses involved an antigenic shift from a human H1N1 subtype to a swine H1N1 subtype. pig surveillance programs have not been able to detect the immediate precursor of this virus in pigs in south China and other parts of the world (51). pig surveillance programs have not been able to detect the immediate precursor of this virus in pigs in south China and other parts of the world (51). the PDZ motif of NS1 were previously speculated to be useful in predicting the virulence of the influenza A virus were present in this pandemic virus (293) only the hemagglutinin D222G (H1 numbering) mutation with a predilection for -2,3-linked sialic acid was associated with clinically severe disease. influenza virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a lipid-containing envelope and an eight-segment genome encoding 11 or 12 proteins (545). the pleomorphic viral particles observed in cell culture or clinical specimens may vary from spherical to filamentous in shape, with a diameter of 120 nm. each year, the world health organization selects the strains of virus that are to be used for the annual influenza vaccination in humans according to this antigenic drift. the nomenclature of the viral strain is written in order: type/place of isolation/strain number/year of isolation(subtype) this antigenic change is called antigenic drift (424) in previous pandemic viruses, the H subtypes shifted from H1 to H2 in 1957 and H2 to H3 in 1968. the 2009 pandemic virus had North American swine H1 and Eurasian swine N1, replacing the circulating human seasonal H1N1 virus subtype (472). this form of genetic shift is different from those of the 1957 pandemic H2N2 virus, which evolved from the circulating H1N1 virus by acquiring the H2, N2 the 8 gene segments of the influenza A virus genome encode 11 to 12 viral proteins with various functions in the life cycle. three gene segments encode the polymerase proteins PB1, PB2, and PA and two smaller proteins, PB1-F2 and N40. PB2 is necessary for cap binding and endonuclease activity but can also inhibit the induction of type I interferon (276). matrix protein M1 is a structural protein for the nuclear export of viral RNA (vRNA) and viral budding. M2 is the antiviral target of the adamantanes, which include amantadine and rimantadine. pandemic influenza virus behaves like other influenza viruses, which are infectious for more than 24 h under low (25%) and high (>80%) relative humidity but less stable at intermediate humidity (50%) and higher temperatures (366, 490), thus, the virus should be most stable in cold winters. PB2 and NP both have a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and can bind to importin 1 (a cellular nuclear import factor), the most abundant importin in human cells. the nuclear viral RNP then becomes the template for the production of mRNA that snatches its 5\u2032 cap of 9 to 15 nucleotides from host mRNA. the export of viral RNP back to the cytoplasm depends on M1 which binds to the RNP and interacts with NS2 which has a nuclear export signal (471). the packaging of vRNA in viral particles depends on the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 noncoding regions with cis-acting signals (268). the packaging of vRNA in viral particles depends on the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 noncoding regions with cis-acting signals. the -2,3-linked sialic acid receptors are present in the distal bronchiole, type 2 pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages of humans (473). the H of the A/2009/H1N1 virus adheres to the -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors and to the -2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, which are more highly expressed in the human lower respiratory tree. pigs are an important \u201cmixing vessel\u201d due to their tracheae containing receptors with both -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid moieties. pigs can be infected by human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. the /1918/H1N1 virus has an additional G225D (H3 numbering) substitution. this is sufficient to switch the receptor preference from -2,3 to -2,6 in cell-based assays. a difference in only two other amino acids, at positions 200 and 227, differentiated the receptor binding specificities of the swine H1 virus. the lysine fence at the H of the A/2009/H1N1 virus favors the binding of the virus to both -2,3- and -2,6-glycans (487). PB2-K627 confers efficient replication at 33\u00b0C (the temperature of the upper airway in humans), while PB2-E627 does not. both variants mediate efficient replication at 37\u00b0C. most virus strains have a truncated version of PB1-F2 that consists of 11 amino acids. three isolates of the A/2009/H1N1 virus were reported to have PB1-F2 that consists of 57 amino acids. the only consistent viral signature associated with clinical severity is the D222G mutation (Table 1). strain 280 Human (293T) and porcine cells found important in regulation of polymerase activity in human cells 381 Mouse and ferret model. to study the effect of varying the amino acids at positions 591, 627, and 701 of PB2 in A/2009/H1N1 R591Q reduced polymerase activity, while E627K and D701N had only mild effects. s found at position 187 12 Analyze 117 clinical specimens in Hong Kong D222G found in 12.5% of patients with severe disease but not in patients with mild disease. D222G identified mainly in endotracheal samples; D222N found in 2 severe cases and in 1 mild case 96 Analyze 11 specimens from 5 deceased patients and 9 specimens from 5 ICU patients in canada.

M2 proteins were predominantly in the human influenza virus but not in the swine or avian influenza viruses. mutations in NP (V100I), NS1 (I123V), N (V91I and N233D) and H (S206T) have emerged as the predominant type, from fewer than 11% of the strains collected from April 2009 to more than 75% of the strains collected from June to December 2009. the retrograde passage of the A/2009/H1N1 virus back into pigs was well documented with genetic reassortment (530) oseltamivir resistance or D222G viral mutation associated with severe disease was reported within 9 months, but proportions were very low (372) influenza virus vaccines for the upcoming northern Hemisphere influenza season 10 August 2010 WHO issued recommendations for the postpandemic period. many scientists were surprised that the 2009 pandemic may have originated from swine (481) and not from avian populations. real-time predictions of the spread of the pandemic have been performed but with only modest accuracy. mathematical modeling can estimate worst- and best-case scenarios to gauge the magnitude of the pandemic only when a sufficient caseload is available to calculate the basic parameters for the modeling. however, the interval for data accumulation has diminished the predictive value of mathematical modeling and its impact on epidemiological control. 2.2\u20133.3 (65, 543) AR, 7.7\u201361;

Gram staining was used for panel D. myocarditis with myofibril degeneration and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate were found in several fatal cases of 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection. cytokine activation levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed no significant differences between the A/2009/H1N1 and seasonal H1N1 viruses. c Compared children with or without pneumonia. lower in severe cases only if 3 days after onset of symptoms. influenza virus triggers an immediate response from the innate immune system through nonspecific PRRs, including TLR3, -7, and -9 (150, 220), at the plasma membrane or within endosomes. it is unclear whether the influenza virus produces dsRNA in infected cells. NS1 can interfere with the activation of RIG-1 by viral ssRNA harboring free 5\u2032-triphosphate groups (443) Alternatively, NS1 reduces RIG-I signal transduction by inhibiting the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I\u2013CARD ubiquitination (190) the significance of these molecular interactions between the viral and host factors is shown in cell culture and mouse challenge models infected with the prototype influenza A virus (PR8). infection by the A/2009/H1N1 virus may induce broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies that target the H stalk and globular head domain in multiple influenza virus strains. patients with severe influenza were shown to have lower serum complement levels and higher titers of antibodies, with a lower avidity for attaching to H, than those with mild cases. 1 live attenuated vaccine, decreased morbidity and mortality were observed (92) cross-reactive adaptive immune responses against A/2009/H1N1 virus in humans and experimental animalsa Type of response Study design (location) 12 adults CTL from uninfected individuals could directly lyse A/2009/H1N1-infected target cells and produce IFN- and TNF-. seasonal influenza vaccination could expand the functional M158\u201366 epitope-specific CTLs in 20% of HLA-A2+ individuals 518 Investigate the degree of T-cell cross-reactivity between seasonal influenza A (sH1N1, H3N2) from 1968 to 2009. antibodies compare the T cell responses elicited by trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine (USA) 30 healthy adults Both vaccines boosted preexisting T cells to the seasonal and pandemic H. but responses were significantly greater following immunization with LAIV. antibody levels against A/2009/H1N1 in sera collected between 2004 and 2005 by HI assay (Finland) Born between 1909 and 1919 (n = 27), between 1920 and 1929 (n = 104), between 1930 and 1939 (n = 125), 1940 or after (n = 775) Proportion of patients with cross-reactive antibody (HI titer, > 10): born between 1909 and 1919, 96%; born between 1920 and 1929, 56.7%; born between 1930 and HI, SRH, and VN assay (Italy) Born between 1909 and 1938 (n = 201), 1939 and 1948 (n = 193), 1949 and 2004 (n = 193) Proportion of patients with HI titer of 40: born between 1909 and 1938, 22.4%; born between 1939 and 1948, 12.4%; born between 1949 and 2004, 6.7% 459 Mouse model; expose mice to virus (1947 virus A/FM/1/47 or 1934 virus A/ 1,693 serum samples collected in 2007 to 2008 HI titer increased from 40.5% in those 0\u201324 yr to 70% in elderly 143 Measure the cross-reactive antibody titer (France) 1,693 serum samples collected in 2007 to 2008 HI titer of 40 increased from 40.5% in those 0\u201324 yr to 70% in elderly.

TPCK treatment will inactivate the chymotrypsin in a pancreatic extract, whose proteolytic activity on H will nullify the trypsin-mediated enhancement of viral infectivity. a 4-fold rise in the complement fixation antibody titer with these antigens indicates a recent influenza A virus infection without differentiating between seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 infection and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection. cross-reactivity between seasonal H1N1 and pandemic H1N1 may still occur, because their overall amino acid identity was 80.1% for H. antibody levels accurately correlate with protection from (or susceptibility to) disease and vaccination status (84). a definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of a 4-fold increase in antibody titers on paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples. resistance to adamantanes can be detected by standard cell protection assays. the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of N is the most sensitive and specific phenotypic means of detecting resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. multiplex PCR can simultaneously detect the presence of the A/2009/H1N1 virus and the mutations responsible for the resistance. pyrosequencing can detect the emergence of resistant quasispecies in treated individuals without laborious cloning and Sanger sequencing. lower respiratory tract specimens, including sputum, endotracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, may be more sensitive in some cases with predominantly lower respiratory tract involvement (35). fecal specimens should also be collected in a viral transport medium, such as Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin or 0.1% gelatin. patient demographic (if available), and country Analytical performance Reference Real-time RT-PCR (Luminex xTAG respiratory virus panel;

methylprednisolone, 38%; other corticosteroid, 12% No significant difference in oseltamivir use between steroid group and nonsteroid group. only early administration of corticosteroids within 3 days of mechanical ventilation was associated with the increased risk of death, not administration at >3 days. corticosteroid corticosteroid was changed to methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days, then 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days. for patients with ARDS, hydrocortisone was changed to methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days. for patients with ARDS, hydrocortisone was changed to methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies were shown to protect against lethal challenge by H5N1 and H3N2 viruses. a monoclonal antibody targeted the conserved F subdomain of HA2 has been shown to protect mice and ferrets from both H1N1 and H3N2 infections. a randomized controlled trial of treatment with specific human monoclonal antibodies or hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with severe influenza infection is warranted antiviral treatment oseltamivir is available orally. zanamivir is available either as a dry powder or as an intravenous formulation. nebulization of powder form of zanamivir has been found to clog the ventilator circuit. the side effects of aprotinin treatment, including stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, thrombosis, and anaphylaxis, must be considered (582). randomized controlled trials with patients having seasonal influenza suggested that neuraminidase inhibitors shortened the duration of illness by approximately 1 day (245). however, most authorities would not recommend routine oseltamivir treatment for mild illness because of the risk of fostering drug resistance. late treatment was associated with ICU admission or death 281 USA Hospitalized patients 2 (n = 36) vs >2 (n = 120) Early treatment was associated with shorter lengths of stay in hospital (P = 0.03) 75 Spain Hospitalized patients 3 (n = 297) vs >3 (n = 288) Early treatment was associated with nonsevere disease (OR, 0.32) 529 Canada, USA Solid-organ transplant recipients 2 (n = 90) vs >2 (n = 125 intravenous zanamivir and peramivir have been used in patients with severe disease. they have in vitro activity against the A/2009/H1N1 virus. no randomized controlled trials or comparative clinical trials have been reported. RNA still detected after 6 days of oseltamivir and nebulized zanamivir. liver and renal function worsened 151 USA F/18 mo, undergoing allogeneic matched related stem cell transplant Regimen was well tolerated. antiviral resistance All A/2009/H1N1 strains are resistant to adamantanes due to the S31N mutation in the M2 protein (79, 554) oseltamivir resistance due to the H275Y (by N1 numbering) substitution in neuraminidase accounts for fewer than 2% of the strains tested (554) other mutations (E119G, E119V, and I222V) have been found to confer oseltamivir resistance in vitro. but they have not been reported in clinical strains (445) oseltamivir was changed to zanamivir 7 Asia-Pacific region (1,488) Singapore, 3.1%; Australia, 1.3% H275Y NA 267 Japan (75) 1 strain H275Y, 46 NA 300 Japan (253) 3 patients H275Y (2 patients), 27.3 NM 454 USA 2 adolescent girls attending summer camps who received oseltamivir prophylaxisc H275Y, I223V Changed to zanamivir ltamivir-resistant influenza infection not shown in this table are in references 11, 88, 160, 168, 194, 197, 257, 259, 384, 488, 505, and 590. c Oseltamivir resistance developed after oseltamivir therapy. the combined S247N and H275Y mutations resulted in a >5,000-fold reduction in oseltamivir susceptibility. oseltamivir and its metabolites may have excitatory effects on the central nervous systems of rats. the safety of these agents in infants and pregnant women is unknown. there is no evidence that oseltamivir is teratogenic. convalescent-phase plasma collected from surviving patients by apheresis (548) limitations included failure of donors to meet blood donation eligibility criteria, failed laboratory tests, insufficient neutralizing antibody titers. none of the patients in the treatment group developed adverse effects after convalescent serotherapy. mortality in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the nontreatment group. hydrocortisone, 57.8%; methylprednisolone, 37.3%; prednisolone, 4.8% No significant difference in oseltamivir use between steroid group and nonsteroid group Corticosteroid associated with death. 126 received corticosteroid at ICU admission. plasma treatment reduced mortality (OR = 0.2) 264 Australia 5 patients IVIG 3 patients received ECMO, 2 patients received intravenous zanamivir 3 patients had clinical improvement. 2 patients had respiratory deterioration following IVIG 207 UK 1,520 patients Statin NM No significant association between preadmission statin use and severity of outcome 43 Spain 197 patients with pneumonia. the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe influenza infection is controversial because no randomized controlled trials have been conducted. some studies have shown a beneficial effect of corticosteroids, while others showed no effect or even a detrimental effect. the rate of ECMO use for mechanically ventilated patients with A/2009/H1N1 pneumonia ranged from 4% to 9%. the mortality from severe A/2009/H1N1 infection is substantial. prevention by vaccination is crucial. rion inactivated vaccines and dose-sparing adjuvants boosted vaccine supply. hemagglutination inhibition titer of 1:40 achieved in more than 90% of vaccinees. children less than 11 years of age or adults greater than 61 years of age had poorer responses (588) the acceptance of the pandemic influenza vaccine is low, partly due to concerns regarding safety, such as the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome after vaccination (330, 466, 467, 512) the risk of developing Guillain-Barre syndrome in individuals receiving the vaccine is similar to that in the general population (76, 353) the transmissibility of the A/2009/H1N1 virus in the household was broadly similar to that of seasonal influenza A viruses (124). the attack rate was highest among children and adolescents. oseltamivir was used as postexposure prophylaxis. only 4 (0.48%) of 836 people exposed to laboratory-confirmed patients and staff with A/2009/H1N1 infection were virologically confirmed to have A/2009/H1N1 infection. not wearing a surgical mask, either by exposed persons during contact with index cases (4/4 versus 264/832; P = 0.010) or vice versa (4/4 versus 300/832; P = 0.017), was found to be a significant risk factor for the nosocomi the A/2009/H1N1 vaccination uptake rate is higher in the united states. 98.1% of HCWs were vaccinated, whereas only up to 70% of HCWs were vaccinated without employer requirement. a high level of acceptance with a voluntary uptake rate of up to 70% was observed in Canada. growth in many developing areas of the world has led to an increasing demand for animal proteins. inadequate biosecurity measures allow for continued jumping of novel influenza virus reassortants or multidrug-resistant bacteria from swine to humans. the potential combination of influenza and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections could prove disastrous should future pandemics occur. edward et al."}
