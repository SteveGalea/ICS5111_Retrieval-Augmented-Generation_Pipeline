{"summary": "study was conducted by reviewing the number of cases reported as acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention between June, 2002 and July, 2008. the difference between two groups was measured and their transitions were compared. the difference between two groups was measured and their transitions were compared. five target syndromes including acute rash syndrome, acute neurologic syndrome, acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome, acute respiratory syndrome and acute diarrheal syndrome (sporadic type and mass type) are monitored. the target subjects include infectious disease are not only the potential bioterrorism but also they are capable of spreading mass type diarrheal illness. there was no change in domestic EDSS in the way of syndrome reporting method since its introduction in 2002. there was no change in domestic EDSS in the way of syndrome reporting method since its introduction in 2002. the anti-bioterrorism Information Network indicates the total number of cases, not the number of individual patients. the reporter must fill out the form and send it to district public health center by fax. when bioterrorism is highly likely, he must telephone immediately. the Korean CDC monitors daily reports from 125 emergency departments nationwide to detect the emergence of 5 syndromes which can be used as bioterrorism attack. every morning before 10 a.m., designated emergency departments must report the number of patients of subject syndromes, visited between 9 a.m. the day before and 9 a.m. of the day. the KFDA reports mass food poisoning statistics on the basis of public health centers' report data. the differences between the number of mass food poisoning cases from the KFDA and acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) cases from the Korean CDC during the same period are tabulated. the number of mass food poisoning cases in different districts aData was calculated until July, 2008. in march 2007, the number of mass food poisoning cases from the KFDA was 41, increased from 31 in January and 28 in February. on the contrary, none of the cases were reported from the Korean CDC. the number of mass food poisoning cases reported by the Food Poisoning Statistical System of the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) and the Anti-Bioterrorism information network of the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year. the differences between the number of mass food poisoning cases from June, 2002 to July, 2008 according to the KFDA and the number of acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) cases from the Korean CDC during the same period are tabulated. the number of mass food poisoning cases in different districts aData was calculated until July, 2008. in march 2007, the number of mass food poisoning cases from the KFDA was 41. despite 32 cases from the KFDA in November, none was reported from the Korean CDC. food poisoning outbreaks increased annually since 2003. 75.6% of the total food poisonings were related to cafeterias and restaurants dealing sea foods. there are substantial discrepancies between the data reported from the anti-bioterrorism information network and the actual disease outbreaks. if performed effectively, it could offer great opportunities for early detection and preparedness for the target diseases or accidents like bioterrorism. if performed effectively, it could offer great opportunities for early detection and preparedness for the target diseases. the EDSS used the chief complaint code alone or in combination with the chief complaint code. but the limitations in using the diagnostic code are the variance in coding, errors in input, time consumption until the diagnosis being made and changes in the confirmative diagnosis after short term emergency care. despite diverse attempts in improving syndromic surveillance performance in other countries, the EDSS still maintains the method of inputting data manually to the computer by the reporter's judgment. ERSS was a computerized program invented in our institution. it is carried out by collecting the daily numbers of patients' chief complaints. this process is carried out by gathering the daily numbers of patients' chief complaints related to target syndromes. et al. pointed out that the following factors must be fulfilled in achieving effectiveness of the EDSS. current EDSS in Korea has major defect in accuracy of data collecting system, which hampers early detection."}
