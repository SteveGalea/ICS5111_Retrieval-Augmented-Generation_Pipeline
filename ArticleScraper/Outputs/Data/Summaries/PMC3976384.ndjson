{"summary": "china has made remarkable progress in schistosomiasis control over the past decades. transmission control has replaced morbidity control as the country moves towards the goal of elimination. the current challenge is to find a sensitive measure capable of gauging transmission risk in low-prevalence areas. schistosomiasis is caused by the zoonotic trematode worm Schistosoma japonicum. the disease is caused by the zoonotic trematode worm Schistosoma japonicum. the oncomelania hupensis snail is the intermediate host for the parasite. the use of mice challenge to assess environmental risk is widely used. however, the sensitivity of the mouse bioassay becomes unreliable when transmission levels decrease. these limitations present formidable challenges for surveillance and control, which have yet to be overcome. use of the Delphi method to develop a Schistosomiasis Early Warning Index (SEWI) and assess its utility in Jiangsu Province of the lower Yangtze River. the study area covered 19 endemic counties in the marshlands along the Yangtze River. we then assessed the present situation of schistosomiasis transmission and control, monitoring and surveillance. we proposed a basic framework of monitoring and early warning indicator system for schistosomiasis transmission. two important characteristics were specifically considered in selecting indictors. about 80% of the experts chosen had been engaged in schistosomiasis control for more than ten years. 80% of them had senior titles and 73% were heads of county-level departments of schistosomiasis control. their ages ranged between 28 and 54 with an average age of 42 years. development and application of the SEWI The Schistosomiasis Early Warning Index (SEWI) is an integrated index to evaluate the risk of schistosomiasis transmission and its value varies between 0 and 1. the level was divided into four categories, namely very high risk at SEWI >0.8, high risk (SEWI >0.6), medium risk (0.3SEWI0.6) and low risk (SEWI0.3). first-order indicator (Weight) second-order indicator (Weight) third-order indicator The standardized or reference value weight a value of example point b SEWI calculation c A: Endemic status (0.366) A1: Endemic status of human (0.129) A12: The infection rate of schistosomiasis The true infection rate 0.0424 0.1 0.04240.1 A13: The acute case of schistosomiasis within last three years Whether there exists the true value divided by reference value of 10 thousand square meter 0.0147 2 000 0.0147(2 00010 000) A26: The density of infected snail The true value divided by the reference value of 0.05 snail per 0.1 square meter 0.0151 0.2 0.0151(0.20.05) Yes = 1; and No = 0.

Yu et al. [36] established three first-order indicators, namely the infection rate of humans, livestock and snails, and six second-order indicators. Luo et al. [37] and Yu et al. [38] established the effect-evaluation index system of schistosomiasis in the mountainous region of Yunnan Province and the marshl the number of second-order indicators decreased from 11 to 7. four indicators were close to the livestock, including the Endemic status of livestock, Control measures for livestock. the other two indicators were Health resources and Climate factors. the human seroprevalence declined by 64% and the parasitological prevalence by 58% from 2005 to 2008. there remains a potential for re-emergence of the disease in the study area as infected snails and human infections continue to be reported in the region."}
