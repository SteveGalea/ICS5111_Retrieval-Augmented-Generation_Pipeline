{"summary": "arenaviral hemorrhagic fever is an acute, often-fatal, viral syndrome characterized by intense fever, malaise, and less frequently, bleeding and neurologic manifestations. cases of hospitalized patients suffering from arenaviral hemorrhagic fever range from 15\u201330% [1], [2], [3], [4]. cIFN-, also known as IFN alfacon-1 and Infergen, is a licensed, second generation IFN- engineered to contain the most frequently occurring amino acids among the nonallelic IFN- subtypes. cIFN- has clinical value, but its usefulness is hindered by its short half-life and cost to manufacture. 201 was first developed in mice and recently shown to be active against yellow fever virus (YFV) infection in hamsters. the intranasal (i.n.) inoculation used in the YFV study prevents the host immune system from recognizing the Ad5 vector, bypassing any possible pre-existing immunity. both viruses were prepared in PBS for i.n. instillation in a 200 l volume. a specific volume of liver or spleen homogenate or serum was serially diluted. the viral cytopathic effect was determined 7 to 8 days post-virus inoculation. 201 dose range titration experiment Hamsters were weighed on the morning prior to the day of infection and grouped (n = 15 for drug treatment groups, 26 for the placebo group) the average hamster weight per group across the entire experiment varied by less than 5 grams. single dose i.n. treatments with 108 pfu of DEF201 or rAd EV were administered 24 h prior to challenge with 5 pfu of PICV. the surviving animals (including 6 nave sham-infected controls) were re-challenged. a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with newman-Keuls post test or the Kruskal-Wallis (two-tailed) test. both viruses were prepared in PBS for i.n. instillation in a 200 l volume. a specific volume of liver or spleen homogenate or serum was serially diluted. the viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was determined 7 to 8 days post-virus inoculation. experimental design def201 dose range titration experiment Hamsters were weighed on the morning prior to the day of infection and grouped (n = 15 for drug treatment groups, 26 for the placebo group) the average hamster weight per group across the entire experiment varied by less than 5 grams. surviving animals were re-challenged on day 28 post-infection. Morbidity and mortality were observed out to 58 days after challenge. def201 dose range titration experiment Hamsters were weighed on the morning prior to infection. single dose i.n. treatments with 108 pfu of DEF201 or rAd EV were administered 24 h prior to, or 6, 24, or 48 h after challenge with 5 pfu of PICV. on day 28 post-infection, the surviving animals (including 6 nave sham-infected controls) were re-challenged. def201 pretreatment protects PICV-infected hamsters from mortality. animals were treated 24 hours prior to infection with a single i.n. instillation of the indicated dose of DEF201, the rAd EV control virus, or PBS placebo. 107 and 108 pfu DEF201 groups presented with little to no day-7 virus burden in the serum, liver, or spleen. the 106 group developed viral titers comparable to the rAd EV and placebo controls. a delay in the development of liver disease may explain the reduced ALT levels. def201 extended pre-exposure prophylaxis protects hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. animal weights were measured two weeks prior to, and at the time of, PICV challenge. effect of 7-day and 14-day pretreatments on A) weight change over two weeks prior to PICV challenge. def201 significantly reduced day-7 viral loads and liver disease (ALT) compared to the controls. tissue titers were slightly lower when DEF201 was given 7 days prior to challenge compared to the 14 day pretreatment. this was not evident with serum viral burden. a final experiment was conducted to determine the therapeutic value of DEF201 in the hamster PICV infection model. Efficacy waned when treatment was delayed to 48 h post-infection. the treatment given 24 pre-challenge verified previous activity, with all animals surviving challenge. all six nave animals that were initially sham-infected survived a second challenge on day 28. reductions in ALT and viral titers were most evident in the groups that received deF201 within 24 h of infection. this trend may suggest a low-level immune stimulation in the hamsters relative to the time at which the rAd EV was given. u of deF201 resulted in 100% survival, and 107 and 106 pfu doses also protected 90% and 60% of hamsters from mortality. only one out of ten hamsters treated with 108 pfu of the control rAd EV virus survived the infection; however, there did appear to be a slight delay in the time to death. the high-dose of rAd EV control virus also resulted in a slight reduction in weight compared to the controls. there was no elevation in serum ALT levels on day 7 of infection in samples collected from parallel treated and infected hamsters receiving DEF201. a delay in the development of liver disease in the 106 pfu DEF201-treated animals may explain the reduced ALT levels. hamsters treated with the 108 pfu dose of DEF201 had significantly reduced weights compared to those that received the rAd EV and placebo control treatments. however, the pretreatment with DEF201 seven days before infection was highly protective (90% survival rate; Figure 3B). def201 significantly reduced day-7 viral loads and liver disease (ALT) on both the 7-day (Figure 4A, C, E, G) and 14-day (Figure 4B, D, F, H) pretreatments, def201 significantly reduced day-7 viral loads and liver disease (ALT) compared to controls. def201 post-exposure prophylaxis and acquired immunity against PICV re-challenge. Efficacy waned when treatment was delayed to 48 h post-infection. rAd EV treatments initiated 24 and 48 h post-infection. the surviving hamsters from this experiment were re-challenged with PICV to assess the ability of DEF201 to enhance longer-term protection via acquired immunity. a single animal in the rAd EV 48 h group survived a second challenge on day 28. expression of cIFN- following a single i.n. administration of DEF201 offers strong protective effect in hamsters against challenge with PICV. lack of significant antiviral activity elicited by the rAd EV control virus suggests that the enhanced antiviral response produced by DEF201 is largely due to the expression of the cIFN gene. early induction of a strong type I IFN response is associated with favorable disease outcome in nonhuman primates challenged with Lassa virus [30]. early post-exposure prophylaxis was also required with exogenous cIFN- protein administered by the i.p. route [15], [16]. the utility of DEF201, recombinant IFN proteins and IFN inducing agents will depend upon the nature of the IFN pathway blockade. activity results from fully glycosylated cIFN- expressed from cells transduced with DEF201. previous studies in mice with a related virus expressing mouse IFN- (mDEF201) have shown the utility of adenovirus-based system to counter viral infections. the production of a shelf-stable, powdered formulation of DEF201 for easy i.n. administration and long-term storage would be ideal for stock-piling in the event of the need for mass distribution."}
