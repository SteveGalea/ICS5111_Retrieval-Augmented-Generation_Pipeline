{"summary": "as of November 2014, forty-seven mAb products have been approved in the us or Europe for the treatment of a variety of diseases. most protein-based therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines are made using traditional recombinant protein production platforms. the selling prices of pharmaceuticals are increasing along with global price inflation, and in turn, over half of the global population cannot afford critical medicines. production of recombinant biologics in plants has received considerable attention because the platform provides specific advantages over traditional microbial and animal cell cultures. plants possess an exceptional biosynthetic capacity for expression of recombinant proteins without supporting growth of adventitious agents (e.g., prions, pathogenic viruses) the transient plant expression system is associated with a simple raw material (plant biomass) grown using an inexpensive, chemically-defined nutrient solution and light. upstream processing using transient plant expression systems is simpler and requires less capital expense/investment than bioreactor-based processes. only a few techno-economic analyses of transient protein production in plants have been published. the simulations were used to investigate the effects of expression level (g mAb/kg fresh weight) of plant biomass on CAPEX, OPEX and COGS. cost for validation, laboratory, quality control (QC), quality systems development and maintenance (QA) were also included to support a model that would conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) compliance. alternative facilities were simulated by varying the expression level from 0.25 g mAb/kg FW to 5 g mAb/kg FW. production capacity was modeled in the range from 25 kg mAb/year to 600 kg mAb/year at an expression level of 1 g mAb/kg FW. the model can also be used to identify process bottlenecks (e.g., cost of utilities, labor, major equipment) the downstream portion of the process includes harvesting, homogenization and extraction, recovery, purification, and preparation of bulk drug substance. the total capital investment for the Base Case scenario was estimated at $121.6 million USD, where 35% is associated with the upstream part of the facility. total annual operating cost including depreciation in millions USD (% of Total) $13.4 (37%) $23.0 (63%) $36.4 Total annual operating cost excluding depreciation in millions USD (% of Total) $9.5 (35%) $17.4 (65%) $26.9 Cost of Goods Sold including depreciation ($/g mAb) $44 $77 $121 Cost of Goods Sold excluding depreciation ($/g mAb) $32 $58 $90 expression level from 0.25 to 1.5 g mAb/kg FW is modest. the reduction in COGS and CAPEX for increasing expression level is modest. analysis of COGS and CAPEX for different production capacities. we developed a process model and performed a techno-economic analysis for a biomanufacturing facility that produces a mAb bulk drug substance product using transient agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) hydroponically grown indoors under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. the model includes material and energy balances on each unit operation as well as batch scheduling, including clean-in-place (CIP) and steam-in-place (S the base case model indicates potential targets to reduce the CAPEX, as well as the COGS in the PMP facility. a significant portion of the equipment costs (39%) is associated with the lighting, racking, and hydroponic plant growth systems. however, these systems require very little maintenance compared to standard stainless steel bioreactors. the base case model was developed for very small batches, 5 g of purified mAb/batch, and low expression levels, ranging from 0.037\u20130.065 g mAb/kg FW. the model does not include facility-dependent costs (e.g., depreciation, equipment maintenance) or laboratory QA/QC, which would be important for cGMP operation. the COGS was lowered to $611/g, resulting in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 26% for a selling price of $1,250/g. the downstream processing costs accounted for 80% of the total production costs. greenhouse production is likely to be less expensive than indoor, hydroponic, LED-illuminated plant growth. our COGS of $121/g agrees quite well with the Wilken and Nikolov study. the downstream processing cost was estimated at $5.90/g purified rhLF. the downstream processing cost was estimated at $5.90/g purified rhLF. a similar plant-based facility is estimated to have an OPEX of $33M/year and COGS of $131/g, assuming an expression level of 1 g/kg FW. the downstream processing costs for a mAb produced using a conventional mammalian cell culture process at a high production capacity (1,000 kg/year) was estimated to be $232/g. bs, as well as other biotherapeutics, tend to be developed for small to intermediate size (10 to 100 kg/yr) production facilities. average production capacity is about 250\u2013300 kg/year and average mAb selling price is $1,450/g. new markets are opening with demand below 50 kg/year. each batch corresponds to 9,830 kg of plant biomass to harvest/process each week. the upstream portion of the process includes plant growth, preparation of agrobacteria, vacuum infiltration, and post-infiltration incubation of the plants. the unit production cost, or COGS, was calculated taking into account all material (raw and consumables) and production costs (labor, facility-dependent costs, utilities and waste disposal) divided by the product output, the COGS drops to $90/g mAb when depreciation is not included in the calculation. analysis of COGS and CAPEX as a function of expression level. effect of expression level (mg of mAb produced per kg plant FW following agroinfiltration/incubation) on COGS and CAPEX was assessed. production level was kept at the Base Case of 300 kg/year. a biomanufacturing facility produces a mAb bulk drug substance product using transient agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) hydroponically grown indoors under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. the model includes material and energy balances on each unit operation as well as batch scheduling, including clean-in-place (CIP) and steam-in-place (SIP) operations. models are useful for determining ranges of mAb selling price, production capacity and expression level that would be required for profitability of novel types of PMP facilities using current processing technology. for example, expression levels will need to be greater than about 0.4 g/kg FW at a production capacity of 300 kg/year, or, at an expression level of 1 g/kg FW, the production capacity needs to be greater than 110 kg/year. the cost of drug research and development, preclinical and clinical trials, royalty payments, and other factors are not included in the model. the cost of drug research and development, preclinical and clinical trials, and other factors are not included in the model. a study by Walwyn et al.19 presented a techno-economic analysis of the transient production of a non-therapeutic protein, recombinant horseradish peroxidase. the downstream processing includes harvesting, homogenization, centrifugation, centrifugation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, lyophilization, and packaging. in the study, the downstream portion of the process accounted for about the same percentage of the CAPEX (61%) compared with the current study (65%). the COGS for the greenhouse production and bioreactor production are $98/g and $138/g in 2012 USD. the downstream processing cost was estimated at $5.90/g purified rhLF. but was found to be very sensitive to the expression level, increasing up to $375/g at 0.005% rhLF in rice flour. the general trends for the effects of expression level and production capacity on downstream COGS are quite similar. many of these estimates are for facilities with very large production capacities. for mAbs produced in conventional batch CHO bioreactors, Kelly28 estimated COGS to range from $134/g at 1,000 kg/year to $26/g at 10,000 kg/year. petrides et al.29 estimates a COGS of $86/g at 1,580 kg/year and a CAPEX of $512M. only a few commercial scale facilities have been built for commercial-scale production. the proposed facility follows a unilateral flow from upstream processing to downstream processing. the proposed facility follows a large-scale hydroponic growth system with plants grown under LEDs. plant germination room is part of upstream portion of facility at iBio CMO. bioreactor room adjacent to infiltration room provides necessary volume of A. tumefaciens culture. plant biomass is homogenized and the clarified extract moves to downstream process train for the purification and concentration of the mAb drug substance. each grow tray holds 320 plants. a total of 3,069 grow trays are processed per batch. plants are ready for vacuum agroinfiltration. filtration is performed at pH 5.6 to allow the activation of Agrobacterium virulence genes. plants are then inverted and immersed in the diluted suspension of the A. tumefaciens in the vacuum infiltrator. the entire process takes about 26 h to complete for one batch with 2 automated 33 ft vacuum infiltration systems. post-infiltration plants are harvested using a mechanical harvester (GBX-110) and then transported to a double-stack disintegration system that consists of a disintegrator (GBX-111) and a grinder (GBX-112) this process ensures that the plants are homogenized for optimum protein extraction. a sodium phosphate-based extraction buffer is introduced to the slurry to aid in extraction efficiency. the entire procedure takes 4.2 h and requires a resin volume of about 266 L. the eluted protein solution pools were then subjected to an anion exchange chromatography (AEXC) step takes 3 h to complete and requires a resin volume of about 119 L. a part of the model, the purified mAb solution was buffer exchanged (into a phosphate buffer) through an ultrafiltration and diafiltration step (DF-102) the filtration step takes 1 h and requires a total membrane of 10 m2. the 100 L of final protein solution is stored in 50 L disposable storage bags. downstream process is highly instrumented, requiring biopharmaceutical-grade materials, classified environments, and extensive auxiliary systems. downstream process was 3 times the upstream equipment purchase cost and the downstream DFC was 11.3 times the downstream equipment purchase cost. some of the unit procedures needed for the process model were not available in SuperPro Designer\u00ae. depreciation was calculated based on straight-line depreciation over a 10-year period with a salvage value of 5% of the DFC. the proposed facility follows a unilateral flow from upstream processing to downstream processing, and then finally to a bulk drug substance containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient. the upstream segment of the proposed facility was designed based on a vertical farming environment for the production of the plant N. benthamiana using a large-scale hydroponic growth system. the upstream process grows the plant biomass to feed the vacuum infiltration procedure. the clarified extract moves to a traditional downstream process train for the purification and concentration of the mAb drug substance. the process is split into four parts: growing N. benthamiana, growing A. tumefaciens, vacuum infiltration, and protein production in a post-infiltration plant incubation step. a total of 4092 germination trays are required per batch to achieve the base case annual production target of 300 kg of purified mAb. an inoculum is prepared in 4 L flasks (SFR-101 and SFR-102) from working cell banks. antibiotics are used in the shake flasks to ensure only the desired clones of A. tumefaciens are grown. a single-use bioreactor was chosen to limit the cleaning and validation cost required for reusable stainless steel equipment. a moderate vacuum is briefly applied to remove air from the interstitial space of the leaf. the vacuum is quickly released to allow penetration of Agrobacteria into the inner tissue of the leaves effectively transfecting the leaf cells. plants are transported to a separate temperature and humidity controlled room and added to vertical racks. the extraction buffer was added until the ratio of plant biomass to buffer reaches 1:1 (w/w) the clarified liquid is then moved to a tangential flow filtration (DF-101) step. this step takes 1.4 h, concentrating the extract 10-fold using extraction buffer as the diluent, and requires a total membrane area of 200 m2. column equilibration, wash, and regeneration used a total of 16 CVs of respective buffers and solutions. this process takes 3 h to complete and requires a resin volume of about 119 L. the eluent is a Tris and sodium chloride buffer, and its volume is equal to 7 membrane volumes. the total output is close to 300 kg per year. the total capital investment included the direct fixed capital (DFC), working capital to cover expenses for 30 d of labor, raw materials, utilities and waste treatment. the total purchased equipment cost included all equipment shown in the process flow diagrams as well as additional equipment (e.g., pumps, valves, forklifts, lab equipment) not included in the flow diagram. labor-dependent cost items such as shift supervisors, benefits, QC, QA, administration and laboratory services were estimated as a multiplier to operator labor costs. for the downstream portion of the process, the laboratory, QC and QA costs were assumed to be 15% of the total labor costs for the downstream. for the downstream portion of the process, the laboratory, QC and QA costs were assumed to be 50% of the total labor costs for the downstream. equipment cost per unit of production capacity scales in proportion to size. this characteristic is observed in the following correlation C a = C b ( Q a Q b ) x where C a is the equipment cost of production capacity, Q a, C b and Q b are the base costs and capacities. x is the power factor that relates the production capacities. outcomes do not reflect any financial or commercial interest of either the University of California, Davis or iBio, CMO."}
