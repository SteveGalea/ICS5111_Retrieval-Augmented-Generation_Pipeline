{"summary": "despite the passing of more than a year since the first outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), efficient counter-measures are still few and many believe reappearance of SARS is not unlikely. pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases. coronaviruses are found in different species ranging from chicken to cattle and humans. seven coronavirus genomes, including SARS coronavirus (CoV), have been sequenced and clustered into four main groups. the main proteinase 3CLpro performs at least eleven proteolytic cleavages within a single viral polyprotein. preliminary studies revealed that this model is not compatible with coronavirus cleavage sites. the general approach is still valid though, and we decided to apply this method to the problem of predicting the 3CLpro proteinase cleavage sites. the method is based on known cleavage sites in seven members of the coronavirus family. the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase shares many traits with its picornavirus 3C proteinase counterpart. position P1', P1, and P4 have similar amino acid distribution in the 3C and 3CL proteinase cleavage sites. position P1', P1' and P4 have similar amino acid distribution in the 3C and 3CL proteinase cleavage sites. the false positive rate is now down to 36 wrong sites, but at the same time only 48 (62%) of the correct cleavage sites are detected. the best model was obtained using a three-layered neural network with two hidden neurons and a sequence window encompassing nine amino acids. the posterior probability of a positive prediction (a prediction indicating a cleavage) being true was calculated and plotted. results indicate prediction scores can be classified into three categories. those that fall below 0.5 are most likely not cleaved, those that fall between 0.5 and 0.8 are possibly cleaved. if this protein is indeed a cellular proteinase target it might cause disruption of the RNA polymerase III complex upon infection with a coronavirus. a similar disruption would be expected in case of a cleavage of the largest subunit of the complex (RPA1_HUMAN) several subunits of the transcription initiation factor TFIID have predicted cleavage sites. the 250 kDa subunit (T2D1_HUMAN), the 135 kDa subunit (T2D3_HUMAN), and the 105 kDa subunit (T2DT_HUMAN) the tumor-suppressor protein P53 is known to be cleaved by picornavirus 3Cpro proteinase [24] but this protein is a number of proteins involved in the ubiquitin pathway have predicted cleavage sites. IRAK-1 (IRA1_HUMAN) which is involved in IL-1 induced activation of cells has a predicted cleavage site following Gln97 (0.890) this part of the membrane protein is cytoplasmic and contains several phosphorylation sites. we have listed the human proteins analysed in a table (Table 1). Table 1. Table 1. Selected potential cleavage sites in human proteins examined in this work. columns represent Swiss-Prot identifier, predicted cleavage site position of P1 in the target protein, cleavage site score, and cellular localisation of target protein. 77 annotated coronavirus polyprotein main proteinase cleavage sites were aligned without gaps by constraining the P1 position. positions P1', P1', and P4 have similar amino acid distribution in the 3C and 3CL proteinase cleavage sites. a strong consensus is evident around the cleavage site. a study of the crystal structure of 3CLpro from the 229E strain of human coronaviruses indicates that residues at positions P5 to P3 form an anti-parallel sheet with part of the proteinase. it is clear from the above that a simple, position specific consensus sequence is difficult to define. however, an additional 196 sites in the viral polyproteins are incorrectly classified as cleavage sites. this model was able to classify correctly 67 of 77 known cleavage sites (87.0%) and 1,358 of 1,372 (99.0%) sites assumed not to be cleaved by the proteinase. the neural network method could thus identify many more positive sites with fewer false positives than simple consensus-type methods. two subunits of the RNA polymerase III are predicted targets of the coronavirus proteinase 3CLpro. if this protein is indeed a cellular proteinase target it might cause disruption of the RNA polymerase III complex upon infection with a coronavirus. the highest scoring is CREB-RP (AT6B_HUMAN) with a predicted cleavage site at Gln358 (0.916) close to the DNA binding leucine zipper motif. the highest scoring is CREB-RP (AT6B_HUMAN) with a predicted cleavage site. MAP-4 (MAP4_HUMAN) is cleavable in HeLa cells by the poliovirus 3Cpro proteinase. microtubule-associated protein RP/EB member 1 and 3 have sites which obtain scores above 0.519. the position of the possible cleavage site in MAP-4 is different from that observed with poliovirus 3Cpro. IRAK-1 (IRA1_HUMAN) involved in IL-1 induced activation of cells has a predicted cleavage site after Gln457 scoring 0.859. protein 6\u201316 precursor (INI2_HUMAN) is a membrane protein and was predicted to possess a cleavage site following Gln97 (0.890).

Negative examples predicted to be cleave by the neural network during cross-validation. position refers to position in the viral polyprotein. the method may facilitate proteinase blocking based drug discovery by providing hints about proteinase affinity to various non-cleavable peptide ligands. a total of 77 of these sites were identified. all testing and results reported are combined values of the three test sets. each test set thus contained 483 examples of which 25 or 26 were positive examples. sequence logos may be visualised using sequence logos. the posterior probability P(Cpos|Xl) gives the probability of a positive prediction (that is, a cleavage) being true given the bin. this can be calculated from the prior probability P(Cpos) and the class-conditional probability P(Xl|Cpos) for positive examples. aligned and cleavage sites identified from the annotation in NC_004718. each sequence contained eleven 3CLpro proteinase cleavage sites. 77 of these sites were identified. the validity of the statistics depends on the expected fraction of cleavage sites in a given data set. the posterior probability P(Cpos|Xl) gives the probability of a positive prediction (that is, a cleavage) being true given the bin. authors' contributions LK carried out sequence retrieval, alignment, neural network training, prediction on potential proteins and drafted the manuscript. OL provided input on virus pathology and suggested human proteins for prediction."}
