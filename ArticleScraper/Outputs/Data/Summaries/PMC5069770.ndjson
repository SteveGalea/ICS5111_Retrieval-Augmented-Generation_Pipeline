{"summary": "the SOP rapidly generates noninfectious, barcoded DNA libraries for ssRNA+ viruses. first, viral RNA is isolated using a commercially available RNeasy kit or Trizol. second, purified viral RNA is used as a template for sequence-independent cDNA synthesis. third, DNA products of the SOP are purified. step 1, generating cDNA and SISPA, uses a primer with a random hexamer coupled to a unique barcode (BC-N6) the primer is used for both generating single-stranded cDNA from input RNA and generating double-stranded DNA by randomly priming the synthesized cDNA. sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) uses a random hexamer primer coupled to a unique barcode (BC-N6) small PCR products are generated with unique barcodes on each terminus of randomly primed amplicons. a PCR step with primers encoding only the barcode sequence amplifies and uniquely barcodes a sample. representative genomic coverage for FMDV, WNV, HRV-16, CHIKV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) obtained from Illumina MiSeq sequencing illustrates that 99.9 to 98% genome coverage was achieved for each virus. areas where low coverage was observed include the terminal 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome. sequencing reads were mapped corresponding to input viruses. these viruses include foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type O (GenBank accession no. KF112887.1) (A), west Nile virus (WNV) AF404756.1) (B), human rhinovirus 16 (HRV-16) (GenBank accession no. L24917.1) (C), Chikungunya virus (pJM6-3-CHIKV 181/25-mkate) (D high-titer samples of coronaviruses, flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and picornaviruses were processed. aliquot of each sample was used to test for infectious virus or infectious viral gRNA. blind passaging of potentially infectious material on permissive cells is a standard assay for infectivity. SISPA products lack both viral and RNA infectivitya Input virus for SISPAb Locationc Viral infectivity testse Cell line LODf (GE) Loss of infectivity (no. positive/no. tested) Loss of infectivity (no. positive/no. tested) Cell line LODf (GE) [no. positive/no. tested] Loss of infectivity (no. positive/no. tested] Loss of infectivity blind passaging of potentially infectious material on permissive cells is standard for removing products out of a BSL-3 facility. a total of 324 samples were tested for genomic RNA loss of infectivity. a total of 309 samples tested for virus loss of infectivity. heat treatment abolishes ssRNA+ viral infectivity. an additional heat inactivation step was included to further reduce the risk of residual infectious material leaving BSL-3/4 containment. RNA from 106 PFU of HRV-16 was treated with the amount of RNase from the SOP. material from each group was then transfected into H1 HeLa cells. a subset was purified at each step and tested for the presence of infectious RNA over three blind passages. the subsequent PCR step and downstream RNase cocktail inactivate gRNA from at least 1 106 PFU equivalents for HRV-16. this is true for both FMDV and HRV-16, and supports data in Table 1 which clearly demonstrate that the SOP abolishes gRNA infectivity across diverse virus families. RNA from serial 10-fold dilutions of an HRV-16 virion stock was treated according to the SOP. samples were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq platform. the left y axis denotes the number of reads mapped to the HRV-16 reference genome. the right y axis denotes the percentage of the reference genome covered. ilutions of HRV-16 virions and HRV-16 gRNA in pure and mixed samples were performed. a virion dilution series precedes RNA extraction, followed by the SOP. aliquots from each dilution were added to 1 g of total HeLa cell RNA. rRNA was removed, and the material was subjected to the SOP. HRV-16-specific reads obtained by MiSeq (black solid lines) are plotted on the left y axis. the cycle threshold (Ct) values are plotted on the right y axis. qrRT-PCR and miSeq data from each test are displayed in Fig. 5A to D as the number of HRV-16-specific sequencing reads per sample. qrRT-PCR LOD of 8.33 PFU and MiSeq LOD of 83.3 PFU in test 1. qrRT-PCR LOD of 2.78 PFU and MiSeq LOD of 162 PFU in test 3. qrRT-PCR LOD of 8.33 PFU and MiSeq LOD of 27 PFU in test 4. viral loads peak in the footpad at day 5 and diminish by day 29. peak brain titers occur at day 10 postinoculation. virus-specific reads were detected in the brain of one animal at 29 days postinfection. three viral stocks were subjected to the SOP, anonymized, and shipped to JCVI for sequencing and data analysis in a blind manner. raw data underwent de novo assembly, and large contigs (>500 bp) were used to identify the best full-length viral genome references by a nucleotide BLAST search. Sequencing reads were then mapped onto the selected reference genome, and mapping coverage was determined. in panels B to D, nucleotide coverage depth is indicated on the y axis. genomic position, with the length of each genome indicated as well as the best available reference genome, is indicated on the x axis. an SOP was established for work at each institution. a list of BC-N6 and PCR primer sequences has been described previously (15). all SOP products were treated with an RNase cocktail (Life Technologies) and purified (Qiagen) a subset of samples were subjected to heat inactivation at 72\u00b0C for 30 min. final products of the SOP were shipped to JCVI, pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (two 300-bp paired end [PE] reads) the resulting contigs longer than 500 nucleotides (nt) were used to search for the most appropriate reference sequences available in GenBank. the number of reads that mapped to the references, the percent genome coverage from these mappings, and the number of unmapped reads were determined. cells were propagated using Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 (35). samples in which no infectivity was observed were amplified through three blind passages. RNA was isolated from supernatants of cell lysates previously electroporated with viral RNA, cDNA, or SISPA. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) superscript III reverse transcriptase (RT) (Life Technologies) was used for cDNA synthesis following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was isolated from samples with the Qiagen RNeasy kit. the initial sample volume was 100 l, and isolated RNA was eluted in 30 l water. all animal studies that resulted in tissue sample harvest were approved by the university of Wisconsin\u2014Madison. a negative-control sample (diluent alone) and a positive-control sample containing 100 PFU were prepared in parallel. the 1-ml samples were inoculated into a T25 flask of Vero cells (18) and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h, rocking every 15 min. monolayers were monitored daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) the cells were incubated for 10 min at rt before they were transferred to a flask containing 15 ml warmed complete medium. the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 and were observed daily for CPE. after 4 days, 1 ml of supernatant from each flask was inoculated onto vero cells, and the samples were serially passaged. the pWR3.26 molecular clone was obtained from the ATCC to rescue HRV-14 viral stocks. the pR16.11 plasmid was obtained from the ATCC to generate HRV-16 viral stocks. supernatants containing infectious virus for both HRV-16 and HRV-14 were isolated and aliquoted. transcription was performed with oligo(dT) priming. cDNA was diluted to 1:100 and run in duplicate using the TaqMan custom HRV-16 custom primers and probe on the Applied Biosystems 7500 platform. DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. if no CPE observed, 3 ml of supernatant from each petri dish was inoculated into fresh HeLa cells. this was repeated for a total of three passages. for all experiments, an HRV-16 genomic RNA was transfected in parallel as a positive control for RNA infectivity. the supernatant was removed, and the pooled 137.5 l was mixed with 3 ml of infection medium (1 DMEM plus 1% FBS) this mix was used to infect T75 flasks for 1 h, gently rocking flasks every 20 min. after 1 h, the medium was replaced, and flasks were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 72 h. using SP6 mMessage mMachine RNA transcription kits (Ambion) 107 BHK-21 cells were electroporated with 15 l of the pooled SISPA library. 107 BHK-21 cells were electroporated with 15 l of the pooled SISPA library. monolayers were maintained for 72 h at 37\u00b0C and assessed for CPE and red fluorescence every 24 h. at 72 h, 3 ml (20%) of supernatant was transferred to a new T75 flask of Vero cells (P:2). 20% of the supernatant from P:2 was placed on a third monolayer (P:3) of Vero cells, which was assessed for CPE for 72 h. media from infected cells and processed RNA were placed on vero E6 cells to determine the titer in PFU per milliliter as previously described. RNA or cDNA intermediates or final purified products were used to infect vero E6 cells in a six-well plate."}
