{"summary": "crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV) is an acute infectious disease with a wide geographic distribution and an average case fatality rate of approximately 20\u201330%. the etiological agent, CCHF orthonairovirus (CCHFV), belongs to the genus of the Nairoviridae family. the virus has a wide host range and causes a transient viremia in many wild, domesticated and laboratory mammals. CCHF is considered endemic in more than 30 countries across the african continent, the Balkans, the Middle East, Southern Russia and Western Asia. over the past 20 years, CCHF has emerged or re-emerged in several countries often with dramatically increased case numbers. there has been a marked increase of imported cases of CCHF in European and South Asian countries. experimental CCHFV vaccine vector based on human adenovirus type 5 (Ad) expressing the CCHFV N (Ad-N) mice developed an anti-N humoral immune response. a single dose of Ad-N resulted in 30% protection of IFNAR-/- mice against lethal CCHFV challenge. adenovirus (Ad) expressing the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the N of CCHFV Strain IbAr 10200 (Ad-N) were constructed and rescued using the Adeno-X Adenoviral System 3 and titered using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. groups of IFNAR-/- mice (n = from 3\u201318 animals per group) were vaccinated with 1.25107 infectious units (IFU) of Ad-wt or Ad-N by the intramuscular route delivered into the hind-leg musculature. Vaccinated mice were acclimatized to the BSL4 environment for 5\u20137 days prior to CCHFV challenge. blood collected into EDTA tubes for RNA extraction and frozen at 80\u00b0C for virus isolation. the remaining mice (n = 3, 6 or 9) per vaccine group were monitored daily for 30 days post infection. supernatants from CCHFV infected (positive antigen) and mock-infected (negative antigen) SW13 cells were harvested, cleared from cell debris through low-speed centrifugation. slides were examined by a veterinary pathologist and scored as follows. 0 = no obvious pathological changes; 1 = minimal increase in the number of inflammatory cells and hepatocellular necrosis. 3 = moderately increased numbers of inflammatory cells and multifocal hepatocellular necrosis or lymphocytolysis. Vaccine vector The adenovirus (Ad) expressing the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the N of CCHFV Strain IbAr 10200 (Ad-N) were constructed and rescued using the Adeno-X Adenoviral System 3 and titered using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Vaccine efficacy studies IFNAR-/- mice were vaccinated with 1.25107 infectious units (IFU) of Ad-wt or Ad-N by the intramuscular route delivered into the hind-leg musculature. Vaccinated mice were acclimatized to the BSL4 environment for 5\u20137 days prior to CCHFV challenge. liver and spleen specimens were collected for pathological evaluation or immediately frozen at -80\u00b0C for virus isolation. remaining mice (n = 3, 6 or 9) per vaccine group were monitored daily for 30 days post infection. supernatants from CCHFV infected (positive antigen) and mock-infected (negative antigen) cells were harvested, cleared from cell debris through low-speed centrifugation. slides were examined by a veterinary pathologist and scored as follows. 0 = no obvious pathological changes; 1 = minimal increase in the number of inflammatory cells and hepatocellular necrosis. 3 = moderately increased numbers of inflammatory cells and multifocal hepatocellular necrosis or lymphocytolysis. IFNAR-/- mice (n = 9 for Ad-N; n = 6 for Ad-wt) were vaccinated with recombinant adenoviruses. the animals were monitored for weight (C) and disease progression/survival (D) over 30 days. IFNAR-/- mice were immunized at day -56 (1.25107 IFU) and boosted on day -28 (108 IFU) with recombinant adenoviruses, challenged on day 0 with CCHFV (1000 LD50) and monitored for survival. Ad-wt vaccinated animals showed increased protection from lethal CCHFV challenge (78% survival, p0.0001) groups of IFNAR-/- mice were either single-dose (1.25107 IFU; intramuscular) or prime-boost vaccinated and challenged with 1000 LD50 of CCHFV. mice were anesthetized, bleed and euthanized to harvest organ samples on day 3 post CCHFV challenge. t vaccinated animals consisting of mild focal necrosis and infiltration of small numbers of viable and degenerate neutrophils. results improved by prime-boost vaccination which resulted in further reduction of hepatic lesions. mice immunized with Ad-wt vector showed strongly reduced numbers of CCHFV antigen-positive cells. images are at a magnification of 10x with 500x insets. antigen expression and immunogenicity of Ad-based vaccine vector Confluent 293 cells infected with Ad-wt and Ad-N. IFNAR-/- mice (n = 9 for Ad-N; n = 6 for Ad-wt) were vaccinated with recombinant adenoviruses. the animals were monitored for weight (C) and disease progression/survival (B) over 30 days. IFNAR-/- mice were immunized at day -56 (1.25107 IFU) and boosted on day -28 (108 IFU) with recombinant adenoviruses, challenged on day 0 with CCHFV (1000 LD50) and monitored for survival. Ad-wt vaccinated animals showed increased protection from lethal CCHFV challenge (78% survival, p0.0001) groups of IFNAR-/- mice were either single-dose (1.25107 IFU; intramuscular) or prime-boost (1.25107 IFU; intramuscular / 108 IFU; intranasal) vaccinated with Ad-N or Ad-wt and challenged with 1000 LD50 of CCHFV. mice were anesthetized, bleed and euthanized to harvest organ samples. IHC showed high amounts of CCHFV N antigen in the liver and spleen of animals immunized with Ad-wt vector. mice immunized with Ad-wt showed strongly reduced numbers of CCHFV antigen-positive cells in liver and spleen. images are at a magnification of 10x with 500x insets. CCHFV is a serious threat to public health. the only CCHF disease models are certain immunocompromised mouse strains. IFNAR-/- mice are highly susceptible to severe disease caused by several viral agents. the IFNAR-/- mice often do not respond as quickly to infection as wild type mice. increased difficulty in protecting IFNAR-/- mice from infection seems associated with insufficient immune responses due to inadequate cross-priming of antigen presenting cells. IFNAR-/- mice vaccinated with Ad-N developed IgG responses to CCHFV N (S1 Fig) and were partially protected from CCHFV challenge (Figs 1\u20133; S2 Fig) protection by Ad-N as demonstrated here provides critical information for future development of CCHF vaccines. the identification of a protective Ad-based vaccine could be critical in developing an effective CCHFV combination vaccine regimen. however, mass-scale vaccinations are unlikely to be used in case of CCHF. 293 cells were harvested, lysed in SDS lysis buffer and analyzed. expression of CCHFV N was demonstrated utilizing rabbit N1028 polyclonal antiserum. spleen material was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or with IHC. images are at a magnification of 10x with 500x insets."}
