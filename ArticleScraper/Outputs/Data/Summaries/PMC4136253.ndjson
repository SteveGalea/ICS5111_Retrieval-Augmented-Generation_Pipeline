{"summary": "the causal agent, PED virus (PEDV), is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb (1). at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified in the PEDV genome. at least eight proteins encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been identified as IFN antagonists: nsp1, papain-like protease (PLP), nsp7, nsp15, N, M, ORF3b, and ORF6 (21, 32\u201340). coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant protein in virus-infected cells. PEDV N protein targets TBK1 to prevent its interaction with IRF3 after stimulation, leading to a blockade of IFN production. clonal antibodies directed against IRF3, phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3), and TBK1 were obtained from ABclone (China) and Cell Signaling Technology. human IFN-linked immunosorbent assay kits were purchased from TFB (Japan) HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.1 g/well reporter plasmid, 0.02 g/well plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) where indicated, the cells were also mock infected or infected with SEV 24 h after cotransfection. the data are expressed as relative firefly luciferase activities normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. the abundance of the individual mRNA transcript in each sample was assayed three times and normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. the primers were designed with Primer Express software v.3.0 (Applied Biosystems) hek-293T cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids for 28 h. lysates were boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 min before they were separated by SDS-PAGE. lysates were then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. hek-293T cells seeded onto microscope coverslips were transfected. cells were mock infected or infected with SEV 24 h after transfection. PEDV strain AJ1102 (GenBank accession number JX188454) was isolated from a suckling piglet with acute diarrhea in 2011. HEK-293T cells were cultured and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and used to amplify PEDV. mouse monoclonal antibodies against Flag, hemagglutinin (HA) and -actin were purchased from medical and Biological Laboratories (Japan) the expression vector was a gift from Edward W. Harhaj (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA) the DNA expression constructs encoding MDA5, IPS-1, and IRF3 were described previously (45). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. hek-293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 g of the empty vector or a plasmid encoding PEDV N protein. after 24 h, the cells were mock infected or infected with SEV for 12 h. HEK-293T cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated or not with SEV for 12 h. the cells were then harvested for an ELISA with a human IFN- detection kit. the transfected cells were lysed in 200 l of lysis buffer. the cells were boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 min before they were separated by SDS-PAGE. they were then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the proteins were then cleared by centrifugation. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a DNA expression construct encoding the HA-tagged N protein and then infected with SEV. expression of PEDV N protein significantly inhibited SEV-induced mRNA expression and the secretion of IFN-, indicating that N protein antagonizes IFN- production. grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 g of a plasmid encoding PEDV N protein (pCAGGS-HA-N) and 24 h later, the cells were infected with SEV. expression levels of the IFN- (A), ISG56 (C), ISG54 (D), ISG20 (E) and GAPDH genes were evaluated. overexpression of PEDV N protein significantly reduced expression levels of ISG56 (Fig. 1C), ISG54 (Fig. 1D) and ISG20 (Fig. 1E) induced by SEV. these results further confirm that PEDV N protein antagonizes the production of IFN- rather than IFN signaling. the results represent the means and standard deviation of data from three independent experiments. the relative firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla reniformis luciferase activity. the untreated empty vector control value was set to 1. the expression of PEDV N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmid pCAGGS-HA-N or an empty vector. at 24 h, the cells were infected with SEV for 8 h. an immunofluorescence analysis was performed to detect endogenous IRF3 (red) and N protein (green) with rabbit anti-IRF3 and mouse anti-HA antibodies. the activation of the IFN- promoter driven by TBK1/IKK was inhibited by the PEDV N protein. however, the activation of the IFN- promoter induced by IRF3 was not affected by PEDV N protein. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with IFN-\u2013Luc, the pRL-TK plasmid, and pCAGGS-HA-N together with constructs expressing RIG-I/RIG-IN TBK1 and IKK were coprecipitated with HA-N, suggesting a direct interaction between PEDV N protein and TBK1/IKK. previous studies suggested that TBK1 has a more important role than IKK in the induction of IFN in response to double-stranded RNA. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged N protein and Flag-tagged TBK1 expression plasmids. the cells were then fixed for an immunofluorescence assay to detect N protein (red) and TBK1 (green) with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies, respectively, 28 h after transfection. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-N and a DNA expression construct encoding TBK1. phosphorylation of endogenous IRF3 was detected 28 h after transfection. phosphorylation of endogenous IRF3 was reduced in cells cotransfected with pCAGGS-HA-N. HEK-293T cells were immunoprecipitated with increasing amounts of pCAGGS-HA-N and then infected with SEV. TBK1 efficiently pulled down IRF3 but the amount of IRF3 that bound to TBK1 gradually decreased as the amount of N protein increased. HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 g of a plasmid encoding PEDV N protein (pCAGGS-HA-N) or an empty vector, and 24 h later, the cells were infected with SEV (10 hemagglutinating activity units/well) total RNA was extracted from cells, and expression levels of the IFN- (A), ISG56 (C), ISG54 (D), ISG20 (E the results showed that IFN-induced ISG expression could not be inhibited by PEDV N protein, suggesting that PEDV N protein does not antagonize IFN signaling. overexpression of PEDV N protein significantly reduced expression levels of ISG56 (Fig. 1C), ISG54 (Fig. 1D) and ISG20 (Fig. 1E) induced by SEV. hek-293T cells were mock transfected with pCAGGS-HA-N. the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of endogenous IRF3 were investigated. the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of endogenous IRF3 were investigated. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmid pCAGGS-HA-N or an empty vector. at 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with SEV for 8 h. an immunofluorescence analysis was performed to detect endogenous IRF3 (red) and N protein (green) with rabbit anti-IRF3 and mouse anti-HA antibodies. Luciferase assays were performed 28 h after transfection. the overexpression of any molecule of the RLR signaling pathway resulted in a significant activation of the IFN- promoter. however, the activation of the IFN- promoter induced by IRF3 was not affected by PEDV N protein. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding HA-tagged PEDV N protein and Flag-tagged RIG-I, MDA-5, IPS-1, TRAF3, IKK, TBK1 and IRF3. the lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA MAb. previous studies suggested that TBK1 has a more important role than IKK in the induction of IFN in response to double-stranded HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding flag-tagged TBK1 and HA-tagged TBK1 expression plasmids. the cells were then fixed for an immunofluorescence assay to detect N protein (red) and TBK1 (green) with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies, respectively, 28 h after transfection. TBK1 (detected with anti-Flag antibody) colocalized and distributed mainly in the cytoplasm. PEDV N protein sequesters the interaction between IRF3 and TBK1. phosphorylation of endogenous IRF3 was detected 28 h after transfection. whole-cell lysates were used to analyze expression of TBK1, IRF3, and N protein by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against TBK1, IRF3, or HA. previous studies demonstrated a physical interaction between TBK1 and IRF3, which is a critical step in the activation of IRF3 (52). TBK1 is a member of the IKK protein kinase family and plays an important role in the regulation of type I IFN signaling. it is well known that toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RLRs are the two main PRRs for RNA viruses. the interaction between TBK1 and PEDV N protein suggests three possible models. one possibility is that PEDV N protein directly affects the TBK1 kinase activity. the other possibility is that PEDV N protein disrupts the interactions between TBK1 and one or more of the TBK1 adaptors and blocks upstream signaling. the VP35 protein of EBOV binds to both IKK and TBK-1 to antagonize IFN. the VP35 protein of EBOV binds to both IKK and TBK-1. phosphorylation may affect nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N protein. TBK1 is directly involved in phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7. TBK1 is completely dispensable for type I IFN responses to viral infection. TBK1 is completely dispensable for the type I IFN responses. the N protein of MHV A59 antagonizes IFN activity by interfering with the RNase L activity associated with the induction of 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (43), but this has not yet been demonstrated for the SARS-CoV N protein (21). however, no interaction could be observed between TBK1 and SARS-CoV N protein or MHV N protein (data not shown)"}
