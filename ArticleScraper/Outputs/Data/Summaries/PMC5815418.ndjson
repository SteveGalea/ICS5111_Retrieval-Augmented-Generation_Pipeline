{"summary": "the prevalence of hospitalized children under 5 years with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) is estimated to be 20% and 90% of those were due to pneumonia. ARIs are caused mainly due to viruses; respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), parainfluenza viruses, influenza virus A and B, and human metapneumovirus are the most common viruses isolated. the aim of this study was to investigate the viral and/or bacterial infections associated with ARIs in children under 5 years. the study was conducted between January 2015 and January 2016 at the Albert Royer Paediatric hospital, the Roi Baudouin Hospital, and the Abass Ndao Hospital. influenza viruses (fluA and fluB), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSVA and RSVB), human adenoviruses (HAdV), human coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43), human parainfluenza virus (PIV1, 2, 3, and 4), human rhinovirus (HRV), human enterovirus (HEV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). a 2-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX-96 thermo cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Singapore) and the Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) for a simultaneous testing of influenza viruses (fluA and fluB), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSVA and RSVB), human adenoviruses (HAdV), 74 (45.68) 0 (0) 54 (33.33) 0 (0) 20 (12.35) 2.53 15 7 20 23 9 Rhinovirus 65 (40.12) 3 (1.85) 40 (24.69) 7 (4.32) 15 (9.26) 1.96 18 10 6 4 5 5 1 Enterovirus 41 (25.31) 3 (1.85) 31 (19.14) 1 (0.62) 6 (3.7) 2.11 8 8 7 14 4 Influenza virus infections were associated with single-virus coinfections (33.3%, the distribution of major bacterial clinical strains is shown in Table 2. Among isolated bacterial species, S. pneumoniae was the most prevalent bacteria (17%) followed by M. catarrhalis (15.43%) and H. influenzae (8.02%). chitis 25 16 21 10 6 Bronchiolitis 12 9 11 3 7 Rhinitis 20 28 26 10 10 10 Tonsillitis 10 8 8 8 0 Angina 1 3 3 6 0 Abbreviations: ADV, adenovirus; HEV, human enterovirus; HRV, human rhinovirus. similar findings have also been reported in a study conducted in the united states. virus codetection in clinical settings is becoming more common in ARIs. ARIs were associated with bacterial pathogens. high rate of S. pneumoniae detection was observed in Niger. the high prevalence rates of viral infections and its clinical impact highlight the need to implement a systematic surveillance program for a better management of ARIs in children."}
