{"summary": "the sterility of the gowns was investigated during eight total joint arthroplasties performed by four surgeons. the samples were taken from the arms and frontal part of the sterile gowns pre- and postoperatively. periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is one of the most concerning complications associated with morbidity and mortality after TJA and a leading cause for revision surgery (3-5) the rate of PJI has been reported within 1% to 2% after arthroplasty that is expected to substantially increase with the increased number of arthroplasties (6-10) eight TJAs (five total hip arthroplasties and three total knee arthroplasties) were performed by the same surgeon from whom the required data were collected. in each surgery, the disposable gowns of the same four staff, including the senior surgeon, were investigated. each plate was divided into four quadrants and graded by the number of quadrants with positive growth. the contamination was defined as the presence of one or more quadrants with positive growth. the frontal parts of the gowns were divided to three proximal (with the most proximal two strips), distal (two strips below the level of operating room table), and middle (three strips between the proximal and distal areas) parts. more than 75% of surgeons believe that using sterile surgical gowns is significant or critical for the intraoperative prevention of infection prevention (15), but there are several concerns using surgical gowns. one of the most important features of a surgical gown is the material of which the gown is made. in the present study, contamination was preoperatively observed in four samples and many other samples after the operation completion. preoperatively, the contamination was observed in the most proximal frontal part of surgical gown near the neckline. the lower parts of the body, such as the perineal region and groins, are accumulated by microorganisms. the lower parts of the body, such as the perineal region and groins, are accumulated by microorganisms. this can pass from the body surface through the gown material and contaminate the frontal part. the type of contaminating microorganism was not investigated in the present study. the findings are concerning and necessitate the knowledge about the sources of contamination."}
