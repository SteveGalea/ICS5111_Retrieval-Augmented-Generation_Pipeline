{"summary": "Specimens tested for influenza and RSV were obtained from pediatric inpatients at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, patients from Singapore General Hospital and other public-sector hospitals. influenza viruses were identified by direct antigen detection with immunofluorescence techniques and serologic tests with complement fixation. mortality data were obtained from the Registry of Births and Deaths. under the registration of births and deaths Act, all deaths occurring within Singapore and its territorial waters are required to be registered within 3 days of the occurrence. linear and squared terms of time trend were included to capture secular trends, including population growth, changes in completeness of ICD coding, and changes in diagnostic methods. for each model, residuals were examined for discernible patterns and autocorrelation by means of residual plots and partial autocorrelation function plots. influenza viruses were identified by direct antigen detection with immunofluorescence techniques, serologic tests with complement fixation, and virus isolation. if no effect was observed, the HeLa tubes were passaged blind at weekly intervals, and monkey kidney tissue cultures were tested for hemadsorption with guinea pig erythrocytes. death records were aggregated according to month of death from January 1996 through December 2003. underlying pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths (ICD-9: 480\u2013487), underlying circulatory and respiratory (C&R) deaths (ICD-9: 390\u2013519) and all-cause deaths (ICD-9: 000\u2013999) the proportion of positive influenza results was set to 0 in model 6. the 95% CI for each estimated fraction was obtained by using 1,000 bootstrap resamples. the number of excess deaths attributable to influenza was then derived by multiplying the total number of deaths in each mortality category by the respective influenza-associated mortality fraction (6,20) influenza isolates were subtyped by strain-specific antisera from the centers for disease control and prevention. influenza isolates were subtyped by virus isolation, direct antigen detection, and serologic tests. an average of 1,798 (range 1,545\u20132,340) underlying P&I deaths and 8,237 (range 7,833\u20138,715) underlying C&R deaths occurred each year. peaks in monthly influenza A viruses corresponded very well with peaks in monthly all-cause deaths. the influenza A (H3N2) subtype had a high correlation with influenza A (r = 0.75). temperature (r = \u20130.71) was highly correlated with relative humidity. the relationship between deaths and each respiratory virus (influenza A, influenza B, and RSV) was examined by using a stepwise sequential approach. each 1% change was used for influenza B because of the small range of positive influenza B test results. 0.000 \u2013 \u2013 1.08 (1.06\u20131.10), 0.000 1.08 (1.06\u20131.11), 0.000 1.09 (1.07\u20131.11), 0.000 Influenza B \u2013 1.01 (0.99\u20131.02), 0.360 \u2013 1.02 (1.01\u20131.03), 0.004 \u2013 1.02 (1.01\u20131.03), 0.002 RSV \u2013 \u2013 1.00 (0 in positive test results, without adjusting for influenza B virus, RSV, and other confounding factors, we replaced influenza A variable with influenza A subtypes and adjusted for influenza B virus, RSV, and other confounding factors. only influenza A (H3N2) had significant (all p values 0.001) effects on all-cause deaths. 0.771 \u2013 1.01 (0.99\u20131.02), 0.343 1.00 (0.99\u20131.01), 0.626 \u2013 1.05 (1.04\u20131.07), 0.000 1.01 (1.00\u20131.03), 0.037 1.00 (1.00\u20131.01), 0.166 *CI, confidence interval; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; P&I, pneumonia and influenza. deaths All ages 3.8 (2.5\u20135.0) 588 (396\u2013782) 14.8 (9.8\u201319.8) >65 4.2 (2.7\u20135.6) 421 (273\u2013571) 167.8 (107.0\u2013229.5) 20\u201364 2.3 (0.9\u20133.7) 114 (42\u2013186) 4.2 (1.6\u20136.8) underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths All ages 6.5 (2.2\u201310.5) 116 (40\u2013196) 2.9 (1.0\u20135.0) >65 7.7 the model was developed by using monthly number of deaths and monthly proportion of positive influenza test results. linear and nonlinear time trends, 3\u20134 pairs of seasonality variables, monthly mean temperature and relative humidity. our estimates of annual influenza-associated all-cause deaths, underlying P&I deaths, and underlying C&R deaths in Singapore were 14.8, 2.9, and 11.9 per 100,000 person-years. this finding would translate to an estimated 588 deaths (3.8% of total deaths) due to influenza annually. the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) in the united states (22). Vaccine coverage among elderly persons (>65 years) in the united states increased from 15% to 20% before 1980 to 65% in 2001 (23), and the national target of 60% coverage in this population has been achieved since 1997 (24). the vaccine has been recommended for institutionalized elderly since 1997. influenza B virus did not have any significant and observable impact on underlying P&I deaths. a limitation of our study may have been that the effect of RSV could have been obscured when we analyzed data on all ages. a new infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerged in 2003. the outbreak galvanized public health actions in surveillance and control. surveillance and plans for containing a resurgence of SARS remain in place, in spite of the low risk of a recurrence. mean temperature + monthly mean relative humidity Model 3 Monthly number of deaths = monthly proportion of RSV + number of days in each month + linear time trend + squared time trend + 3\u20134 pairs of seasonality variables + monthly mean temperature + monthly mean relative humidity Model 4 Monthly number of deaths = monthly proportion of influenza A + monthly proportion of influenza B + number of days in each month + linear time trend + squared time trend + 3\u20134 pairs of seasonality variables + monthly mean temperature + monthly mean relative humidity Model 5 Monthly number of deaths = monthly monthly mean temperature + monthly mean relative humidity Model 6 Monthly number of deaths = monthly proportion of influenza A + monthly proportion of influenza B + monthly proportion of RSV + number of days in each month + linear time trend + squared time trend + 3\u20134 pairs of seasonality variables + monthly mean temperature + monthly mean relative humidity."}
