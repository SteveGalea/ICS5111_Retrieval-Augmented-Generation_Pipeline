{"summary": "the disease usually manifests itself as chronic hepatitis, which can progress into fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). how the virus establishes persistence and causes diseases is still far from clear. Hepatitis C virus Life cycle HCV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA Hepacivirus (a genus of the family Flaviviridae) with a 9.6 kb genome. the virus particles are unusual in that they are associated with low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) to form the lipoviroparticles. the polypeptide is then cleaved by the host signal peptidase and signal peptidase peptidase and viral autoprotease NS2-3 and serine protease NS3/NS4A co-factor into the structural proteins core, envelopes E1 and E2, and non-structural (NS) proteins p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. virion assembly is initiated on core-coated lipid droplets followed by budding into the ER. envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, form non-covalently-bonded heterodimers and disulphide-bonded aggregates. assembly, budding and egress are tightly coupled to host lipoprotein synthesis. p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. replication is catalyzed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. formation of the membranous web is induced by NS4B and NS5A. yama and Hayes, 2011; Ripoli and Pazienza, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; Ripoli and Pazienza, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; yama and Hayes, 2011; Mercer et al., 2001; Dor a selectable sub-genomic replicon (SGR) of genotype 1b Con1 isolate was successfully established. a pseudotyped virus containing HCV envelope proteins in a retrovirus or lentivirus genomic backbone (HCVpp) was also established to facilitate the study of virus entry. breakthrough came in 2005 when a cell-cultured infectious system (HCVcc) was established from a wild type genotype 2a JFH1 strain fulminant he cell lines harboring the hepatitis C virus were established by neomycin selection. the genomic replicon is similar to that of SGR, apart from that the 3' mRNA encodes core-NS5B plus 3' UTR. interaction between CD81 and claudin 1 facilitates viral uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. the polypeptide is then cleaved by the host signal peptidase and signal peptide peptidase and viral autoprotease NS2-3 and serine protease NS3/NS4A co-factor into the structural proteins core. replication takes place in a membranous web, which is a re-organized intracellular membrane structure consisting of single, double, and multiple membrane vesicles. formation of the membranous web is mainly induced by NS4B and NS5A. the viroporin, p7, forms ion channels to equilibrate pH gradients during trafficking through the secretory pathway to protect the virion. interaction between CD81 and claudin 1 facilitates viral uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. formation of the membranous web is induced by NS4B and NS5A. assembly of virion is initiated on core-coated lipid droplets. the viroporin, p7, forms ion channels to equilibrate pH gradients. study on the virus was limited to cell-free systems and cell culture expression systems employing transient transfection or viral vectors. in vivo study was made possible by the successful infection of chimpanzees by intrahepatic inoculation of RNA transcript. the breakthrough came in 2005 when a cell-cultured infectious system (HCVcc) was established from a wild type genotype 2a JFH1 strain fulminant hepatitis C patient. a cell-cultured infectious system (HCVcc) was established from a wild type genotype 2a JFH1 strain fulminant hepatitis C patient, coupled with derivation of cell lines from the parental Huh7. cell lines harboring the SGR were established by neomycin selection. the genomic replicon is similar to that of SGR, apart from that the 3' mRNA encodes core-NS5B plus 3' UTR from JFH1. PERK is sequestered in an inactive state by BiP. unfolded/malfolded proteins \u201cdistract\u201d BiP from PERK. translation of ATF4 is upregulated to drive transcription of UPR genes with an ATF4 element in their promoters. IRE1 possesses endoribonuclease and kinase activity. the endoribonuclease activity mediates unconventional splicing of XBP1 (purple scissor); sXBP1 mRNA is translated into an active transcription factor sXBP1 to transactivate genes with ERSE or UPRE. ATF6 de-oligomerizes and migrates to the Golgi where it is cleaved sequentially by site-1 protease and site-2 protease to release an active transcription factor into the nucleus. PERK is an ER stress kinase activated by dimerisation and autophosphorylation causing global inhibition of protein synthesis but paradoxically enhances translation of the transcription factor ATF4. CHOP is a pro-apoptotic transcription factor owing to its ability to transactivate a number of apoptotic genes and downregulate the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. IRE1 is a kinase/endoribonuclease activated by self-oligomerisation and autophosphorylation. sXBP1 transactivates ERSE in promoters of UPR genes and the mammalian UPR element (UPRE) in the promoters of ERAD genes. UPRE-mediated transcriptional induction of the ER degradation-enhancing -mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) is directly involved in the recognition of malfolded proteins for degradation. the adaptor protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 initiates a cascade of phosphorylation culminating in that of the pro-apoptotic Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and pro-survival c-Jun. no consistent clinical data to support or refute the presence of ER stress in hepatitis C patients. a study on a cohort of HCV HCC patients also demonstrated increased UPR markers of sXBP1, BiP, and ATF6 in liver biopsy. it is therefore essential that concrete clinical evidence should await the use of more sensitive methods to detect, at single cells level, co-localization of ER stress markers in infected cells. humanized mice with another genotype (2a) JFH1 strain also resulted in increased levels of BiP and CHOP in the livers. further in vivo evidence of ER stress was obtained in transgenic mice stably expressing the entire open reading frame, the core protein or inducibly expressing C-E1-E2-p7 in the livers. infection of the hepatocyte sub-line Huh7.5.1 with JFH1 (2a) induced an acute ER stress peaking at 2\u20135 days post-infection (dpi), concomitant with phosphorylation of IRE1, eIF2, and JNK, XBP1 splicing. it then subsided into a chronic and milder ER stress response persisting up to 14 dpi. in vitro infection study with wild type genotype is only achievable with the strain JFH1. yet JFH1 was isolated from a patient with fulminant hepatitis. ER stress is a common phenomenon of chronic hepatitis C. a genomic replicon devoid of envelope proteins E1 and E2 failed to elicit UPR in transfected Huh7 cells. the core protein, which does not enter the ER lumen, is important in lipid droplet formation and virus assembly and budding. evidence of ER stress has been documented in tissue-cultured cells transfected with the HCV-core and in the livers of HCV-core transgenic mice. significant role of the core protein can be illustrated by the considerable effects of mutating the core residues R70Q, R70H, L91M on the UPR in Huh7 cells infected or transfected with JFH1. NS4B cells harboring SGR were capable of inducing ATF6 cleavage and XBP1 splicing but suppressing downstream activation of UPRE and EDEM by sXBP1. this suppressive effect could be attributed to NS4B as ectopic expression of NS4B in Huh7 cells displayed similar pattern of ATF6 cleavage and XBP1 splicing. NS5A/5B NS5A/5B are integral to viral replication. infection of humanized mice with NS5A/5B mutants led to increased expression of BiP and CHOP. it is possible that the enhancing effect of the NS5 proteins on the UPR may be an indirect result of higher replication rate of these mutants. NS2 NS2 does not enter the ER lumen despite being a transmembrane protein. it is important in lipid droplet formation and virus assembly and budding. NS2 NS2 is important in organizing the virus assembly complex. ectopic expression of NS2 from genotype 1a in Huh7 cells resulted in eIF2 phosphorylation and modest increases of BiP, CHOP, and ATF6 at the promoter and mRNA levels. another hepatocyte cell line Hep3B stably expressing NS2 from genotype 1b failed to induce ATF6 cleavage. NS4B is important in membranous web/replication complex formation. EDEM interaction with E1 and E2 resulted in ubiquitination of E2 and decrease in virus particle production. NS4B may act to modulate the UPR by suppressing the ERAD. viruses budding through the ER are trafficking through the ER en route to the plasma membrane. mutated viral envelope proteins are significant UPR inducers and major determinants of virulence. virulent strains of retrovirus harbor mutations in envelope proteins. mutations in the large surface protein resulted in ER retention. ER stress is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. in flavivirus, 60 trimeric prM/E assemble as immature virion in the ER. during transit through the Golgi E undergoes dramatic re-organization and collapses onto the virion surface. a cleavage site on prM is exposed for furin proteolysis. it is not clear which of these forms of E1E2 is acquired by the virion when the virus buds into the ER. there has been evidence to suggest that HCV envelope proteins are major UPR inducers. the envelope proteins of Semliki Forest virus have been shown to be responsible for the induction of UPR. E1 and E2 aggregates distract BiP from PERK (purple arrow), allowing PERK oligomerization and activation (brown arrows, 2). Direct binding of E1 and E2 aggregates to the luminal domain of IRE1 can also activate UPR (6). we have shown ERAD engagement in cells transfected with E1 and/or E2. some of them have been directed to the cytoplasm during synthesis or as a result of retro-translocation from the ER. there is in vivo evidence of retrograde transport of E1 from the ER to the cytoplasm for proteasome degradation. studies with yeast have shown that UPR can be triggered by direct binding of unfolded proteins to the luminal domain of IRE1. direct binding of unfolded proteins to PERK can also be feasible. hepatitis B virus buds into the ER-Golgi intermediate or other intracellular compartments. mutations in the large surface protein resulted in ER retention. ER stress is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. lgi E undergoes dramatic re-organization and collapses onto the virion surface. a cleavage site on prM is exposed for furin proteolysis. it is not clear which of these forms of E1E2 is acquired by the virion when the virus buds into the ER. 1E2 undergo further conformational changes into aggregated oligomers when the virus particles transit through the secretory pathway. there has been evidence to suggest that HCV envelope proteins are major UPR inducers. UPR has been documented in infections of Chikungunya and Sindbis virus. E1 and E2 are targeted and mature in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form non-covalently-bonded heterodimers and disulphide-bonded aggregates. the E2 aggregates distract BiP from PERK (purple arrow), allowing PERK oligomerization and activation (brown arrows, 2). cytosolic E1/E2 can also activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in vivo evidence of retrograde transport of E1 from the ER to the cytoplasm for proteasome degradation. there is in vivo evidence of retrograde transport of E1 from the ER to the cytoplasm for proteasome degradation based on the detection of a deglycosylated-deamidated T-epitope from an HCV-infected chimpanzee. the luminal domain of PERK bears secondary structure homology with that of IRE1. direct binding between the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B and the luminal domain of PERK can also be feasible. binding results in repression rather than elicitation of the UPR. the core protein is never directed inside the ER to be able to interact with BiP to trigger the canonical UPR signaling. this is also true for the NS proteins which do not appear to enter the ER lumen even though NS2 and NS4B are transmembrane proteins. protein can also be imported into the nucleus by association with proteasome activator PA28 and importin (purple arrow) also shown is the polyubiquitination and degradation of non-structural protein 2 (NS2) and NS5B by the 26S proteasome. inhibition of HSP90 activity reduces protein folding, accelerates proteasome degradation and induces the UPR. mutation of a single amino acid V/I121A in NS5A is sufficient to abolish its interaction with FKBP8 impairing virus replication. previously, it has been found that mutation of a single amino acid is sufficient to abolish its interaction with FKBP8 impairing virus replication. NS4B interacts with ATF6 to modulate UPR. hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural (NS) 4B protein binds to b-ZIP and transmembrane domains. binding of ATF6 likely triggers its Golgi translocation and activation. lipid perturbation is one of the triggers of UPR. hepatitis C patients exhibit many lipid and lipoproteins. lipid perturbation is one of the triggers of UPR. hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), hypobetalipoproteinaemia, and hypocholesterolemia. both exogenous and endogenous sources of fatty acids were capable of inducing ER stress in Huh7 cells infected with JFH1 or harboring a SGR. the hepatitis C virus core protein (C) plays a part in lipid droplet formation. core, NS2 and NS5B proteins have been shown to interact with proteasomal pathways. interaction of the core protein with proteasome activator PA28 is responsible for pathogenesis of steatosis, HCC and other liver pathology in core-transgenic mice. cytosolic chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) promotes HCV replication by facilitating host and viral protein folding in the replication complex of the membranous web. inhibition of HSP90 activity reduces protein folding, accelerates proteasome degradation and induces the UPR. heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperones folding of viral non-structural (NS) 3-NS5B proteins and host protein cyclophilin A (CYPA) etc. in the replication complex to facilitate viral replication. currently there is no evidence for interaction of the core protein with any of the cytosolic domains of the UPR sensors. expression of NS4B alone also induced XBP1 splicing. NS4B interacts with ATF6 to modulate UPR. fate of NS4B binding to ATF6 is unknown. hepatitis C patients exhibit many lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. hepatitis C patients exhibit many lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. hepatitis C patients exhibit many lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. hepatitis C virus core protein (C) plays a part in lipid droplet (LD) formation. lipid droplet coats the lipid droplet to initiate virion assembly and budding into the envelope proteins E1- and E2-coated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) clinical data will need to be further corroborated and elaborated using well-controlled experiments. ER stress is a common phenomenon of chronic hepatitis C. research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
