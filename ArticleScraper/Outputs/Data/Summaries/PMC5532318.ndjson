{"summary": "the neurological manifestations of MERS have rarely been reported since it first emerged in 2012. 4 patients were from a cohort of 23 patients who were treated at a single designated hospital during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea. potential diagnoses included Bickerstaff's encephalitis overlapping with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. a retrospective study in Saudi Arabia found that 25.7% of MERS patients developed confusion and 8.6% experienced a seizure. only four cases with central nervous system involvement (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, stroke, and encephalitis) have been reported for patients with MERS. the virus transmission was associated with health-care facilities in all of the identified patients. 19 patients survived following treatment with antiviral agents and maximal supportive care. four patients died due to early or late respiratory failure caused by the progression of the disease. symptoms during the disease course Fever38\u00b0C 13 (56.5) Cough/sputum 17 (73.9) Dyspnea 9 (39.1) Myalgia or arthralgia 6 (26.9) Headache 2 (8.7) Confusion 5 (21.7) Outcomes Need for oxygen supply 9 (39.1) Need for high-flow nasal cannula 3 (13.0) Need for mechanical ventilation 5 (13.0) Need for ECMO 1 (4.3 HFNC 5 L/min nasal oxygen 2 L/min nasal oxygen PSI 104 63 56 48 Sepsis severity* Septic shock Sepsis Sepsis Pneumonia SAPS II 74 37 42 30 Antiviral regimen IFN, Rb, and LR IFN, Rb, and LR IFN, Rb, and LR IFN, Rb, and LR IFN, Rb, and LR IFN, Rb, and LR IFN, Rb, s, and weakness in both legs Tingling in distal parts of both hands and feet Tingling in both hands Days after MERS onset Unclear* 16 20 21 Neurological examination Cranial nerves Ptosis and ophthalmoplegia Normal Normal Motor Weakness in all four limbs Proximal dominant weakness in both legs Normal Deep tendon reflex Hyporeflexia in both legs Hyporeflexia in both legs Normal Cerebellar function Limb ataxia Normal the patient remained drowsy and exhibited bilateral ptosis up to 31 h. neurological examination revealed complete external ophthalmoplegia and mild limb ataxia. weakness was also suspected in all four limbs. a 43-year-old woman was diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. she developed severe myalgia, chills, fever, cough, and headache. after 1 week, she developed gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and headache. tingling and pain in the four distal limbs continued until the last follow-up. this patient was presumed to have ICU-acquired weakness or GBS. he had previously experienced contact with patients with MERS in another hospital. at 4 days after this exposure, he developed a fever, coughing, chest discomfort, dyspnea, and stool loss. four patients died due to early or late respiratory failure caused by the progression of the disease. four patients died due to early or late respiratory failure caused by the progression of the disease. time from symptom onset to antiviral therapy, days 6 (2\u20138) Comorbid illness 12 (52.2) Diabetes mellitus 3 (13.0) Hypertension 1 (4.3) Chronic heart disease 2 (8.7) Chronic renal disease 1 (4.3) Bronchiectasis 1 (4.3) Malignancy 1 (4.3) Psychiatric disorder 2 (8.7) Ankylosing spondylitis 1 (4.3) Symptoms during the disease course Fever38\u00b0C 13 (56.5 patients with MERS experienced neurological complications, and the therapies applied to them are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The clinical presentations of these four patients are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2. Clinical presentations of patients with MERS who experienced neurological complications, and the therapies applied to them. patient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Patient 4 Neurological symptoms Hypersomnolence and weakness in all four limbs Tingling/pain in both hands and below the knees. weakness in both legs Tingling in distal parts of both hands and feet Tingling in both hands and feet Tingling in both hands. antimicrobial therapy was added to his treatment regimen. he was intubated, and a mechanical ventilator was added on HD 10. he remained drowsy and exhibited bilateral ptosis up to 31 h. a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection was referred to our hospital. she developed gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. on HD 3, she developed acute respiratory failure and flow rate of her high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy increased to 60 L/min with an inspiratory fraction of oxygen of 1.0. laboratory findings did not indicate the presence of any underlying autoimmune, infectious, or nutritional diseases. tingling and pain in the four distal limbs continued until the last follow-up. this patient was presumed to have ICU-acquired weakness. a 38-year-old woman developed a cough, sore throat, and fever 3 days after being exposed to patients with MERS in another hospital. a chest radiograph showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs. he was assumed to have infectious or toxic polyneuropathy. the patient remained drowsy and exhibited bilateral ptosis up to 31 h. neurological examination revealed complete external ophthalmoplegia and mild limb ataxia. weakness was also suspected in all four limbs. a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection was referred to another hospital 10 days before the onset of her symptoms. she developed gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. on HD 3, she developed acute respiratory failure, and the flow rate of her high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was increased to 60 L/min with an inspiratory fraction of oxygen. patient 3 A 46-year-old man with hypertension and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis was admitted due to infection with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV. at 4 days after this exposure, he developed a fever, coughing, chest discomfort, dyspnea, and stool loss. a chest radiograph displayed diffuse ground-glass opacities in his left lung. a neurological examination showed that her cranial nerves and muscle strength were normal. she experienced normal sensations in pinprick, temperature, vibration, and proprioception tests. a nerve conduction study was not performed because the patient was lost to follow-up. we excluded many BBE-mimicking conditions in this patient based on his clinical history, brain MRI, and CSF findings. the absence of laboratory findings does not rule out a BBE diagnosis. ICU-acquired weakness is diagnosed when a critically ill patient has limb weakness or ventilator dependency without heart or lung disease. the patient experienced symmetric limb weakness following viral infection with a typical monophasic disease course. this is because a paraparetic presentation is extremely rare in GBS. coVs are a group of enveloped RNA viruses that include the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus [including MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV] genera. these viruses have neurotrophic and neuroinvasive characteristics and coV RNA has been detected in the central nervous systems of patients with various neurological diseases. neurological complications are not rare and may be delayed by 2\u20133 weeks. some neurological complications interfere with the prognosis and require appropriate treatment."}
