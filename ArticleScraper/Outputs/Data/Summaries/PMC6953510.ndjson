{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Echoviruses are members of the Enterovirus B species of the Enterovirus (EV) genus in the Picornaviridae family of nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. they were found to be associated with respiratory illness, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and aseptic meningitis. the next-generation sequencing (NGS) library was prepared using a Nextera XT kit and sequenced on a MiSeq platform 300-cycle paired-end run (Illumina, CA) the data were analyzed using an in-house Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pipeline. the final consensus genome was inspected and annotated using Geneious v10.0.9 (9) the genome sequence of E-30 USA/2017/CA-RGDS-1005 shares less than 89% nucleotide identity (NI) and less than 98% amino acid identity (AI) with other publicly available E-30 sequences. the sequence contains the complete protein-coding region, with short sections in the untranslated regions missing due to a lack of read coverage."}
