{"summary": "influenza viruses are known to constantly evolve and cross species barriers. this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of ecology and evolution of influenza viruses. influenza viruses are among the major infectious disease problems affecting animal and human health globally. IAVs and Influenza B viruses are classified into subtypes based on antigenic properties of external glycoproteins. IAVs can cause severe upper respiratory disease in humans. IBV and ICV have a relatively narrow host range. the segmented nature of IAV genomes requires a complex coordination for the selective packaging of the eight-distinct viral ribonucloeprotein complexes (vRNPs) into a progeny virion. all eight genome segments of IAVs carry packaging signals [14] which mediate the formation of eight different vRNPs that are packaged into a progeny virion. avian virus-like H3N2 strain was transmitted to dogs around 2005 or 2006. more than 500 cats became infected with influenza subtype H7N2 in animal shelters in new york, NY, USA in 2016\u20132017. transmission of animal viruses is bidirectional such that humans are infected by animal influenza viruses. newly identified bat flu viruses are genetically distinct from all previously known IAVs. the first was in a frugivorous yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira lilium) in Guatemala. a second virus was found in the flat-faced fruit bat (Artibeus planirostris) in Peru. NS1 fails to bind to the host p85, a regulatory subunit of the cellular metabolism-regulating enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). surface glycoprotein HA and NA genes of bat IAVs only show low nucleotide sequence identity with those of conventional IAVs [28,41]. HA of bat IAVs does not bind to the classical avian (SA2,3-Gal) or human (SA2,6-G the receptors for previously known IAVs are sialic acids (SA) on host cells. hosts that co-express both SA2,3-Gal and SA2,6-Gal receptors could support reassortment of IAVs. novel influenza virus has been identified in several animals including swine, cattle, sheep, and goats. the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses has recently released revised classification of Orthomyxoviridae. the most recent classification of Orthomyxoviridae includes eight genera and nine species. IDVs have been isolated from a range of animals including pigs, sheep, goat, horses and camelids. the precise role of IDVs in clinical disease in animals is not yet fully investigated. but their role in causing respiratory infections in cattle has been implied. many viral pathogens have been implicated in BRD, including bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3. a recent study found IDV antibodies in 34 out of 35 people that had contact with cattle and only 2 out of 11 that did not have any exposure to cattle [68]. the shift from SA-2,3-Gal to SA-2,6-Gal binding requires four mutations for a HA of HPAI H5N1 viruses. however, several newly emerged H5N1 AIVs in Egypt have acquired the human receptor SA-2,6-Gal binding ability during their emergence in birds. the newly discovered IDVs have the widest host range after IAVs."}
