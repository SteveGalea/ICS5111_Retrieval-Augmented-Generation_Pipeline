{"summary": "rabies virus (RV) is a negative-strand RNA virus of the family Rhabdoviridae. the main feature of RV is neuroinvasiveness, which refers to its unique ability to invade the central nervous system from peripheral sites. axonal transport, transsynaptic spread and the rate of viral replication are key factors that determine the neuroinvasiveness of particular RV variants. this more desirable outcome refutes the general belief that death from an established RV infection with pathogenic RV is virtually inevitable. the specific host-virus interactions targeted by TriGAS that result in the clearance of an RV infection in the CNS have not been resolved. the safe clearance of RV from the CNS correlate with the rapid production of high levels of serum RV-neutralizing antibodies. the cells were fixed with 80% acetone and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled RV nucleoprotein (N)-specific antibody. titers in triplicate samples were determined using a fluorescence microscope. eight- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the national cancer institute at Frederick, MD. four, 6, 8, 12, and 40 days p.i., 4 mice each from the TriGAS- and 4 mock-treated groups were euthanized. qPCR was performed on each individual mouse brain RNA in quadruplicate. IFN-1 forward (5\u2032-CATCAACTATAAGCAGCTCCA-3\u2032), reverse (5\u2032-CGTCAGTGCGCTTTTTGAG-3\u2032), and probe (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM-5\u2032-TGATCCCGATGATGTATGC-3\u2032-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]) titers were normalized to international units (IU) using the world health organization anti-RV antibody standard. p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNNP) (Sigma) was used as a substrate. absorption was measured at 405 nm for phosphatase activity in a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek, Winooski, VT) differential expression P values were computed from the t statistic of the log2 RPKM expression ratio across a gene's constituent exons. the set of transcripts analyzed by Cuffdiff included the mouse refGene database, obtained from the UCSC genome browser. hierarchical clustering was performed among the transcripts differentially expressed in at least one of these three comparisons. gene groups resulting from the hierarchical-clustering analysis were also analyzed for gene ontology term enrichment.

RNA (2.5 g) was reverse transcribed using an RT2 First-Strand Kit (Qiagen) and mixed with RT2 SYBR green qPCR MasterMix (Qiagen) 57BL/6 mice were infected i.n. with 10 LD50 of DOG4 RV and then treated 4 h later i.m. with either PBS (mock treatment) or 107 FFU of live-attenuated TriGAS vaccine. the mice that survived showed only subtle clinical signs and loss of body weight. but completely recovered by 40 days after infection. no TriGAS N mRNA was detected with primer-specific DOG4 N mRNA probe. the detection of these two RV N mRNAs is mutually exclusive. mRNA levels increased in the brains of both groups of mice between days 6 and 8 p.i. treatment induces rapid development of RV-specific antibodies in mice intranasally infected with DOG4 RV. mice were infected i.n. with 105 FFU of DOG4 RV and treated with 107 FFU of TriGAS or mock treated with PBS 4 h later. despite rapid production of VNA shortly after TriGAS treatment, DOG4 RV was able to invade the brain and replicate prior to clearance. findings consistent with evidence that immune mediators other than VNA, including type I interferons and T cell products, are likely to be essential in the clearance of the virus from the CNS. mRNAs specific for CD8 and CD19, a marker found on B cell subsets but not plasma cells, were present at their highest levels in mice at 12 days postchallenge. mRNAs specific for CD8 and CD19 were present at their highest levels in the mock-treated mice. asterisks indicate significant differences in copy numbers between different time points determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple-comparison test. the kinetics of RV replication in CNS tissues with those of markers of immunity may ultimately be responsible for the clearance of DOG4. however, the initial reduction in DOG4 N mRNA accumulation in triGAS-treated animals manifests at 6 days postchallenge. the 63 mRNAs of cluster 3 are also upregulated in infected mouse brain. cluster 4 consists of genes that are strongly upregulated in triGAS-treated mouse brain but remain almost unchanged in mock-treated brain. members of the 95 mRNAs of this cluster have been implicated in the control of programmed cell death. clusters of genes are differentially expressed in the transcriptomes of whole brains from mice at 6 days p.i. transcript profiles are mean centered and scaled to unitary standard deviation. subsequent differential-expression analysis identified 132 RNAs with significant differences among the brains of mice. ncRNAs of clusters 1 and 2 are small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which have been associated with pseudouridylation of other RNAs. these molecules guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs (26). the majority of ncRNAs in clusters 5 and 6 consist of noncoding antisense RNAs. expression levels of these genes are in certain cases higher in the brains of mock-treated mice. at the earliest stage of infection studied, day 4 p.i., when DOG4 N protein mRNA is virtually undetected. expression of 16 mRNAs was already increased in the brains of the mock-treated mice. however, at this time only 3 mRNAs (Irf7, Usp18, and GzmA) were expressed at significantly higher levels in the brains uninfected controls, as well as 3 mice from each treatment group, were collected at 4, 6, and 8 days (d) p.i. RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR array analysis. a limited number of genes are expressed at higher levels in triGAS-treated mice than in mock-treated mice at days 4 (A) and 6 (B) after DOG4 RV infection. triGAS-treated mice develop RV-specific immunity considerably more rapidly than mock-treated mice. low levels of VNA become detectable in mock-treated mice only by day 8 (0.5 IU) after challenge, TriGAS-treated mice produce high VNA titers as early as 4 days after challenge. no DOG4 N mRNA could be detected in the brains of surviving mice at day 40 p.i. no mRNA copies were detected in the brains of the treated mice at day 40 p.i. RV G-specific antibody isotypes were determined using ELISA. they are presented in graphs a (IgM), b (IgG1), c (IgG2a) and d (IgG2b) as means SD of the absorbance at a serum dilution of 1:10. we used qPCR analysis to compare the expression of several adaptive and innate immune effectors in the brains of mock- or TriGAS-treated mice. IFN-4 and IFN-1 mRNAs were expressed at the highest levels in the brains of the mock-treated mice at day 8 p.i., correlating with the expression levels of DOG4 RV N mRNA. light-chain mRNA was elevated to high levels only in the triGAS-treated mice. increased expression of mRNAs relevant to innate and adaptive immunity is due to combined infection with both viruses. administration of TriGAS i.m. results in a low TriGAS N mRNA copy number in CNS tissues. mRNAs for either the innate or adaptive markers of immunity studied have become significantly elevated in CNS tissues. transcriptome analysis initially identified 411 protein-coding mRNAs that were differentially expressed in the brains of these mice. cluster 2 contains 35 mRNAs involved in nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic processes, transcription, and chromosome organization. genes that are expressed at higher levels in triGAS-treated brain. but lower levels in mock-treated brain comprise cluster 5. members of the 95 mRNAs of this cluster have been implicated in the control of programmed cell death. subsequent differential-expression analysis of noncoding transcripts identified 132 RNAs with significant differences among the brains of mice. cluster 1, high expression in mock-treated brain with roughly equivalent lower expression in normal mouse brain and triGAS-treated mouse brain. cluster 3, strongly elevated in triGAS-treated mouse brain, with comparably low levels in normal and mock-treated mice. cluster 5, expressed at the highest levels in normal mouse brain, downregulated in triGAS-treated and more so in mock-treated mouse the majority of ncRNAs in clusters 5 and 6 consist of noncoding antisense RNAs. the majority of ncRNAs in clusters 5 and 6 are downregulated in the brains of mock-treated mice. the expression of 63 of these genes is significantly altered in the brains of mock-treated mice between 4 and 8 days p.i. only 3 mRNAs (Irf7, Usp18, and GzmA) were expressed at significantly higher levels in the brains of the triGAS-treated mice. by day 6 p.i, both the number of upregulated genes and their expression levels had increased in the two experimental groups of mice. mice treated i.m. with TriGAS 4 h after i.n. infection with the highly pathogenic DOG4 RV strain generally survive, despite clear evidence of DOG4 replication in brain tissue. differences in measures of adaptive immunity are evident between triGAS- and mock-treated mice both in the induction of vaccines. titers of circulating VNA of the IgM isotype switched to IgG isotypes within 2 days. serum VNAs are virtually undetectable until 8 days p.i., when their levels are less than 0.5% of those of the triGAS-treated mice. truncated CD4 transcripts with no known function are expressed by CNS-resident cells. the innate response of brain tissues to TriGAS infection may play an important role in the control of DOG4 replication. significant upregulation of the expression of the IFN- and IFN- mRNAs was seen only in the brains of the mock-treated mice at 8 days p.i. a number of genes activated in the brain of the mock-treated mouse are involved in nucleic acid metabolism, RNA transcription, and other processes. a number, such as those encoding 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (Oas), interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (Ifih1) and guanylate binding protein (Gbp), represent type I IFN response genes. 63 of the 90 genes identified by ontology analysis were expressed at different levels in the brains of the mock- or triGAS-treated, DOG4-infected mice. only 3 genes, encoding granzyme A (GzmA), IL-12B, and chemokine ligand 3 (Ccl3), were found to be expressed at high levels in the brains of both cohorts. survival of a rabies virus infection requires rapid induction of RV-specific immunity (2). the finding that TriGAS superinfection rapidly induces the expression in the brain of genes involved in immune activation and cell recruitment has implications for its mode of action in containing and clearing DOG4 infection. IL-12 p40 homodimers have been found to act as IL-12 antagonists (15, 19), as well as to induce iNOS expression in primary mouse microglia. p40 homodimers may contribute to the iNOS expression and iNOS-associated radical-mediated formation of nitrotyrosine seen in the CNS of mice clearing apathogenic RV. the early production of these factors promotes the containment of DOG4 infection and its eventual clearance from the CNS. current PET is very effective when initiated shortly after exposure before the virus infects the brain (2)."}
