{"summary": "lectins are defined as carbohydrate binding proteins of non-immune origin. they can recognize and bind simple or complex carbohydrates in a reversible and highly specific manner. this concept is used when the specificity is unknown. monomeric lectins do not exhibit this agglutinating activity. quaternary interfaces are formed between -sheets. the -sheets are connected by loops forming antiparallel chains usually devoid of helices. analysis of legume lectin monomers reveals high similarity in sequence as well as structure. Phaseolus vulgaris lectins (PHA) are well-studied lectins of the first group [21,22,23,24,25,26] there are more than forty structures of legume lectins reported in either the apo (ligand-free) or holo (sugar-bound) form in the Protein Data Bank [15,26,27,28,29,30,31,32] lectins from wild legumes are rare. specificity of Legume Lectins Legume lectins represent a crucial point in the study of the molecular basis of protein\u2013carbohydrate interactions. the CRD of legume lectins lies in close proximity to the metal binding sites, which may aid in binding activity [18], but are not often directly involved in carbohydrate binding. etra-saccharides with association constants significantly higher than those for monosaccharides. some lectins have shown affinity towards carbohydrate structures not present in plants. the specificity of legume lectins has led to the suggestion that legume lectins play a role in plant defense against insects. glycan structures present in glycoproteins are known to have N and O linked oligosaccharides, but desialylation of the glycan can result in an increase or decrease in lectin binding affinity. many studies on lectin\u2013carbohydrate specificity have been published. a critical re-evaluation of lectin binding specificities is required. lectins can interact with glyco-components present on the cell membrane surface, in cytoplasmic and nuclear structures and in the extracellular matrix of cells and tissues from almost all kingdoms of life. plant lectins are thought to play important roles in the plant immune defense and emerge as potential antimicrobial candidates for drug therapies. trials are needed to establish therapeutic efficacy, to optimize dosage, delivery and bioavailability, and to assess potential allergic reactions. trials are needed to establish therapeutic efficacy, to optimize dosage, delivery and bioavailability. etragonolubus agglutinin Lens culinaris agglutinin Vicia faba agglutinin Pisum sativum agglutinin Erythroagglutinin Bind to the glycosylated envelope protein and block cellular entry. lectins from the Vicieae tribe strongly react with the bacterial cell wall components, muramic acid, N-acetylmuramic acid and mura lectins from legumes from canavalia ensiformis, T. foenumgraecum, Arachis hypogaea, Cajanus cajan, P. vulgaris and Pisum sativum were shown to inhibit biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans. the rapid evolution of bacteria with antibiotic resistance has reduced the efficacy of conventional treatments against their biofilms. plant lectins do not penetrate the cell wall or the membrane to reach the cytoplasm of fungi. indirect responses produced by the attachment of lectins to chitin and other glycans on the fungal surface could affect fungal survival or other activities. lectins with antiviral activity are of substantial therapeutic interest. some of these carbohydrate binding proteins exhibit significant activity against human immunodeficiency virus and other viruses. lectins can crosslink surface viral glycans and prevent interactions with other co-receptors. antiviral non-legume lectins are recommended for incorporation into vaginal and rectal gels, creams or suppositories that act as a barrier to prevent HIV transmission. lectins bind the virus preventing its entry and fusion to target cells, consequently averting contamination. lectins of Triticum vulgare, Dolichos lablab L., Trigonella foenumgraecum, Trifolium alexandrium L., Bauhinia variegata L. and Delonix regia have shown antimicrobial activity against mycobacterium rhodochrous, Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, B. sphaericus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, lectins from the legumes from canavalia ensiformis, T. foenumgraecum, Arachis hypogaea, Cajanus cajan, P. vulgaris and Pisum sativum were shown to inhibit biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans. the rapid evolution of bacteria with antibiotic resistance has reduced the efficacy of conventional treatments against their biofilms. lectins from the legumes Astragalus mongholicus, P. coccineus, Archidendron jiringa Nielsen, B. ungulata, Glycine max, Indigofera heterantha and A. hypogaea exhibit antifungal activity against various species of phytopathogenic fungi. some of these carbohydrate binding proteins exhibit significant activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) retroviruses have a surface covered by highly glycosylated virally-encoded glycoproteins, e.g., gp120 (that contains high mannose and/or hybrid glycans) and gp41. lectins crosslink surface viral glycans and thereby prevent interactions with other co-receptors. several legume lectins possess antiviral activity. lectins like C. ensiformis agglutinin (Con A), Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), Vicia faba agglutinin, P. sativum agglutinin (PSA) and PHA-E bind to the envelope glycoprotein gp120. insecticidal lectins can exert a toxic effect via binding to the peritrophic membrane (PM), peritrophic gel (PG) or the brush-border microvilli of epithelial cells. lectins can exert a toxic effect via binding to the peritrophic membrane (PM), peritrophic gel (PG) or the brush-border microvilli. the interaction of lectins with different glycoproteins or glycan structures in insects may interfere with important physiological processes. if lectins are internalized, they may interact with a new set of targets located in the intracellular space. such internalization has been more studied for non-legume lectins. Galantus nivalis lectin Ferritin Nilaparvata lunges Spodoptera littoralis [127] [128] Myracrodruon urundeuva leaf lectin (MuLL) Trypsin -amylase Aedes aegypti [129] Bauhinia monandra leaf lectin (BmoLL) -amylase Callosobruchus maculatus insecticidal effect of some lectins is attributed to the resistance of these proteins to proteolysis. PF2 is resistant to in vitro proteolysis by insect digestive enzymes. other lectins with insecticidal activity that share common feature of resistance to proteolysis by different digestive enzymes. study of potential non-yet-identified insecticidal plant lectins may contribute to the development of distinctive tools for sustainable pest control. study of potential non-yet-identified insecticidal plant lectins may contribute to the development of distinctive tools for sustainable pest control. lectins have shown in vivo and in vitro antitumor activity. lectins can alter the expression of interleukins and some protein kinases. lectins could alter the signaling pathways involved in the expression of members of the Bcl-2, Autophagy (ATG) related, and caspase families. soybean lectin produces reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa cells inducing apoptosis, autophagy and DNA damage in the cells [142]. the cell surface carbohydrates are key targets for lectins; in cancer, a general pathway involves recognition of carbohydrate receptors triggering the activation of enzymes such as MBL-associated serine proteases. domesticated legumes provide an accessible and abundant source of lectins, unlike wild legumes. successful recombinant production of lectins would be a key factor in whether a specific lectin could find use in a feasible industrial application."}
