{"summary": "the viral protein U (Vpu) is one of the four accessory proteins encoded by HIV-1 that has an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain [1]\u2013[10]. the cytoplasmic domain has two -helices [11], [12], and is involved in the degradation of CD4 molecules in the host cell [13], [14]. the TM domain, which is known to have a helical topology [15] the channel has been suggested to exist in a number of conductance states. the duration for which the channel remains open is independent of the voltage, and the channel shows biphasic voltage activation. ion transport activity is rather weak, though the channel shows pore-like characteristics. a multi-ion free energy profile was obtained for the KcsA K+ channel. results from that study showed that an ion trapped in the selectivity filter is able to proceed further into the channel because of electrostatic repulsion from ions that subsequently approach the filter. the method has subsequently been used for calculating the free energy profile of ion transport through the gramicidin channel as a function of both axial and radial positions. the system was equilibrated for 30 ns without any restraints. it was found to be adequately equilibrated for 30 ns without any restraints. the ion was pulled along the pore axis using steered molecular dynamics simulations. independent simulations were performed for different positions of the ion along the pore axis. the biasing potential has the form where k is the harmonic constant, zi,0 is the center of the window i, and z is the position of the ion along the reaction coordinate at any given instant. the ion position ranged from z = 30 to z = 36, giving a total of 133 windows along the z-axis spaced 0.5 apart. the model structure used in the study had previously been aligned along the z-axis. a distribution of ion positions around the center of a given window was obtained. a total of 395 windows spaced 1 apart were sampled with the two ions at different positions along the pore axis. a biasing harmonic potential of force constant 10 kcal mol1 2 was applied on the two ions. a total of 661 independent simulations were performed for each window. a serine at position 23 faces the lumen of the pore. the pore is constricted in the middle, which is a largely dehydrated region. the occurrence of a serine residue gives rise to a slightly hydrophilic region. the length of the hydrophobic stretch would have been greater in the absence of this serine residue. it has been reported that the Ser23Leu mutant of Vpu is inactive towards ion permeation [28] the PMF along the pore axis is shown, with the C-terminus (or the intracellular side) on the left and the N-terminus (extracellular side) on the right. the residues lining the pore are also marked appropriately in the plots. the soft minimum around Ser23 is marked with an arrow. the features of the two free energy profiles (Na+ and K+) were found to be very similar to each other. the movement of the ion into the channel from the C-terminal side is accompanied by the release of 2 kcal/mol of energy. 1.1 ns long MD simulations for each of the 133 windows per free energy profile is deemed adequate. the total simulation time for each of the two ions was therefore (1.1 ns * 133)146 ns. the loss in hydration number leads to a destabilization of the ion in the middle region relative to the C-terminal region. this is consistent with the earlier discussion on the nature of the pore in this region that this region is rich in hydrophobic residues. the stabilization of the ion by this solvation explains the occurrence of the soft minimum seen in the PMF. the cutoff used was 2.8 for Na+ and 3.2 for K+. values for each window have been averaged over the trajectory. pore-lining residues are also shown at their respective position. the interaction of the ion with the protein shown in Figure 7 reveals a shallow minimum for both Na+ and K+ near the serine residue, suggesting weak binding ability. on the other hand, there is a remarkable enhancement of stability due to solvation as the ion moves towards the serine residue. the ser23 makes conditions conducive for ion transport. a mechanism is hypothesized in which only one ion crosses the hydrophobic region of the channel at a given time. the second ion starts crossing the hydrophobic stretch in the pore. this means that two ions cannot enter the middle region of the channel simultaneously. conformations with the spacing close to 3 are sampled in the terminal regions of the channel. this suggests a propensity of the two ions to stay close together. in the middle region of the channel, the ions tend to stay as far apart as possible, thereby minimizing interionic repulsion. the rate for the ion conduction to be several orders of magnitude lower than that estimated using the conductivity measurements previously reported by mehnert et al. [28]. the difficulty in reproducing experimentally determined conductances from the height of energy barriers derived from PMFs has been reported by Sansom and coworkers. meation through the channel in a number of phospholipid environments with varying lateral pressure. further studies are necessary in understanding the role of applied external voltage on the structure and dynamics of Vpu. the calculations reveal reasonably high energy barriers for ion movement through the channel, owing to the highly hydrophobic environment of the pore. the channel consists of five helical TM domains held together predominantly by van der Waals forces. the channel is wider at the C-terminal end than at the N-terminal end, leading to a relatively greater degree of hydration at this end. the residues Arg30 and Tyr29 at the C-terminal end of the TM domain face the exterior side of the channel. the occurrence of a serine residue gives rise to a slightly hydrophilic region. the length of the hydrophobic stretch would have been greater in the absence of this serine residue. it follows that the length of the hydrophobic stretch would have been greater in the absence of this serine residue. the axis of the pore has proved to be a valuable reaction coordinate in the study of ion conduction through channels [46]\u2013[49], [64], [65]. the axis of the pore has proved to be a valuable reaction coordinate in the study of ion conduction through channels [46]\u2013[49], [64], [65] the high energy barrier encountered by the permeating ion is likely to make the process kinetically slow. this is consistent with previous conductance studies on mutant forms of Vpu, which have proposed that the serine can act as a weak binding site. Figure 4 shows snapshots of the Na+ ion at two places inside the channel. the first snapshot shows the ion near the ring of Ser23 residues. the second snapshot shows the ion near the ring of Val12 residues. the hydration numbers were calculated based on cutoff values of the distance between the ion and the oxygen atom of water molecules. as the ion enters the C-terminal side of the channel, it retains its hydration shell, and proceeds spontaneously into the channel. the loss in hydration number leads to a destabilization of the ion in the middle region relative to the C-terminal region. the hydration number was calculated by determining the number of water molecules within a certain cutoff distance of the permeating ion. the cutoff used was 2.8 for Na+ and 3.2 for K+. the permeating ion encounters two principal interacting partners inside the channel. ion-protein interaction energy and average solvation energy for different positions of the permeating ion. the interaction of the ion with the protein shown in Figure 7 reveals a shallow minimum for both Na+ and K+ near the serine residue. this is seen as a fall in the solvation energy of the ion. the free energy surface as a whole shows that permeation of two ions at the same time is not thermodynamically favorable compared to the movement of one ion. if one follows the minimum energy path given in the figure, one can see that when the two ions are near the C-terminal side of the pore. the x-axis labels at bottom show the position of the top ion along the channel axis. the labels at the top show the pore-lining residues at their respective positions along the channel axis. the pathway with the lowest free energy barrier is highlighted in maroon color. an estimate of the rate of ion conduction can be made using the Arrhenius equation. an energy barrier of around 43 kcal/mol suggests that the rate for the ion conduction to be several orders of magnitude lower than that estimated using the conductivity measurements previously reported by Mehnert et al. states are to model the channel in the presence of a voltage. however, the open time for the channel has been shown to be voltage-independent. the factors leading to the occurrence of the different conductance states are still not understood. only one ion can pass through the middle hydrophobic region of the channel. the mechanism proposed is able to account for the slow kinetics of ion transport across the channel. it suggests a role for the hydrophobic stretch in controlling the kinetics."}
