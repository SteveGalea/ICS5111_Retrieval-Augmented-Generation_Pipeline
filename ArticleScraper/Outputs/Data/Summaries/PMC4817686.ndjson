{"summary": "Approximately 60%\u201380% of human EIDs originate from wildlife. the primary issues associated with the prevention and control of EIDs are how to quickly identify the pathogen, determine where it originated and control the chain of transmission. these issues, along with the limited knowledge of the viral population, complicate the study of EIDs. bat individuals of 40 representative species across china were sampled by pharyngeal and anal swabbing to assess the variety of viruses residing in bat species. the identification of novel bat viruses in this study also provides genetic evidence for cross-species transmission between bats or between bats and other mammals. supernatant from each sample was filtered through a 0.45-m polyvinylidene difluoride filter. the filtered samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. the pellets were re-suspended in a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes. PCR amplification was conducted using 1 M primer K (5\u2032-GACCATCTAGCGACCTCCAC-3\u2032) and 0.5 U Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) the amplified viral nucleic acid libraries were then analyzed using an Illumina GA II sequencer (Illumina, Sandiego, CA, USA) each read was evaluated for viral origin by conducting alignments with the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (NT) and protein database (NR) sequence reads classified into the same virus family or genus by MEGAN 4 were extracted and then assembled with seqMan program (Lasergene, DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA) a draft genome with several or a large number of single-nt polymorphisms of each virus was obtained. genome sequencing of each virus in positive samples by PCR. the best substitution model was then evaluated using MUSCLE package. a maximum-likelihood method with an appropriate model was used to conduct phylogenetic analyses. cDNA was digested in a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes. cDNA was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h in 1 DNase buffer. cDNA was synthesized using primer K-8N (5\u2032-GACCATCTAGCGACCTCCAC\u2013NNNNNNNN-3\u2032) each read was evaluated for viral origin by conducting alignments with the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (nt) and protein database (NR) reads with no hits in NT or NR were further assembled using the Velvet software (v1.2.10, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) genome sequences and phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses All genome sequences have been submitted to GenBank. genome sequences and phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses All genome sequences have been submitted to GenBank. the numbers of samples from the 40 bat species and the provinces and dates of collection are indicated by a pie chart for each province. a total of 179 GB of nt data (2 241 761 959 valid reads, 81 bp in length) was obtained. the reads related to the family Parvoviridae comprised the largest proportion of viruses as shown in Figure 2. the dominating abundance of insect densoviruses was associated with the insectivorous habits of bats. samples from 307 frugivorous bats of two species (Rousettus leschenaultia and Cynopterus sphinx) were collected for virome analysis. only a few reads related to herpesvirus, papillomavirus and retrovirus were found. virome of frugivorous bats is far less abundant than that of insectivorous bats. the subfamily includes four approved genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. six - and -CoVs (HKU1, OC43, NL63, 229E, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) are human pathogens. the BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013 identified in Vespertilio superans bats had a closer genetic relationship with MERS-CoV than with other BtCoVs. one BtCoV, BtHp-BetaCoV/ZJ2013, represented a separate clade related to lineage-B CoVs. the ORF1ab, E, M and N genes of BtRf-AlphaCoV/HuB2013 and BtMs-AlphaCoV/GS2013 shared very high sequence identities. a similar phenomenon was observed between BtRf-AlphaCoV/YN2012 and HKU2. ARS-CoVs and lineage-B CoV strains of sublineage 1 and 2 of group 1 in miniopterus fuliginosus were detected in two anal specimens. the coVs of sublineage 1 with highly similar backbone sequences presented differing degrees of variation in the S region. the genomes of BtMs-ParaV/Anhui2011 and BtMl-ParaV/QH2013 were shorter in length than those of three previously reported members of the genus Jeilongvirus. however, the sequence identities were low. the remaining two novel BtParaVs could be clustered together with Rubulaviruses as new species. Clade 4 contained two BtPicoVs identified in the same bat genus. previously reported miniopterus schreibersii PicoV-1 was closely related to the genera Cardiovirus and Senecavirus. seven BtCVs were assigned to the proposed genus Cyclovirus. clade 7 was constructed from two BtCVs and closely related to the genus Cyclovirus. 17 novel BtCVs branched out of the root of CVs and cycloviruses. the aa identities among the predicted VP1 proteins of these BtPVs and bat bocaviruses are shown in Supplementary Table S8. adeno-associated viruses have been described previously (Li et al., 2010b); however, considering the nonpathogenic nature of adeno-associated viruses, we did not perform further verification of these viruses. a total of 4440 bats were sampled by obtaining both pharyngeal and anal swabs from October 2010 through October 2013 in 29 provinces throughout China. the numbers of samples from the 40 bat species and the provinces and dates of collection are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. the number of virus-associated reads in each lane varied between 8283 and 2 919 423. in total, 79 families of phages, insect viruses, fungal viruses, mammalian viruses and plant viruses were parsed. the boxes colored from blue to red represent the metagenomic sequencing reads observed. different families are labeled in different colors. the viruses that could not be assigned to any known genus are labeled in red font. samples from 307 frugivorous bats of two species were collected for virome analysis. only a few reads related to herpesvirus, papillomavirus and retrovirus were found. virome of frugivorous bats is far less abundant than that of insectivorous bats. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the deduced RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12) (Figure 3a Spike (S) and Figure 3b proteins) the sequence identities of these BtCoVs are shown in Supplementary Table S4. -dependent RNA polymerase and S proteins shared only 78% and 41% aa identities with those of lineage-B CoVs. a signal peptide (1\u201313 aa) and a transmembrane region (413\u2013435 aa) were identified in the S-related ORF2 suggesting that this protein might be a surface protein. two BtCoVs, BtRs-betaCoV/YN2013 and BtRs-betaCoV/GX2013, identified in Rhinolophus sinicus from the Yunnan and Guangxi provinces shared the highest similarities with SARS-CoVs in the backbone (including ORF1ab, E, M and N genes), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 genes compared with other bat line bat paramyxoviruses (BtParaVs) were separately identified in 9 bat species. full-length sequence of 3 viruses (BtMf-ParaV/AH2011, BtMl-ParaV/QH2013 and BtHa-ParaV/GD2012) were almost completely determined. 11 other viruses were partially or completely sequenced in the L gene. Picornaviruses (PicoVs) of the family Picornaviridae are small, non-enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of 7\u20139 kb in size. nineteen bat PicoVs (BtPicoVs) were identified in 11 bat species from 9 provinces. the predicted P1, P2 and P3 regions showed typical features of PicoVs. the family Circoviridae is a group of viruses with small, non-enveloped, circular single-strand DNA genomes of 1.7\u20133 kb in length. bat viruses identified in this study are labeled in red. bat parvoviruses (BtPVs) and bat bocaviruses were identified in nine bat species from eight provinces. adeno-associated viruses have been described previously. bat caliciviruses (BtCalVs), four bat polyomaviruses, one bat hepatitis E virus, one bat bunyavirus, one bat orthoreovirus and one bat rotavirus were identified. phylogenetic analysis revealed that these bat viruses represented separate evolutionary lineages within each family. two bat virome analyses conducted by Li et al. and Donaldson et al. (2010) have revealed the presence of CoVs, herpesviruses, PicoVs, CVs, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses and astroviruses in some bat species of north America. one bat virome analysis conducted by Ge et al. (2012) mainly described insect viruses in some bat species of china. the diverse BtCoVs were grouped into several novel evolutionary clades that significantly differ from those of all known - and -CoVs. this study extends the host range for members of each viral family and reveals unique ecological and evolutionary characteristics of bat-borne viruses. henipaviruses, rabies virus and pathogenic bunyaviruses were not detected in the bat species examined in this study. diverse herpesviruses and papillomaviruses identified countrywide support the hypothesis that these DNA viruses from different bat species are located in different phylogenetic positions within each family without strict host or geographic specificity. a functionally similar S gene has been identified in SL-CoVs of R. sinicus and R. affinis (WIV1, Rs3367 and LYRa11) with less sequence identity to the S gene of SARS-CoV, but capable of using the human ACE2 as a receptor for virus entry. only lineage-B -CoVs of six bat species are closely related to SARS-CoVs. two BtCoVs (BtRs-betaCoV/YN2013 and BtRs-betaCoV/GX2013) in horseshoe bats (R. sinicus) provided bat-originated unique structural ORFs that were nearly identical to the original SARS-CoV isolated during the earliest phase of the SARS pandemic. the higher similarities of the backbone of these two BtCoVs to SARS-CoVs, and the the diverse S genes of these MERS-related CoVs may provide an opportunity for their recombination to ultimately generate new CoVs. the understanding of the viral community characteristics, genetics and ecological distribution of bat viruses could enable the rapid identification of novel viruses with variant genomes."}
