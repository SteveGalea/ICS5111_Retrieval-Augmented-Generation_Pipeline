{"summary": "EBOV is a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen (5). it is responsible for the 2013-2015 outbreak in west africa. more than 28,000 suspected cases had been reported. over 11,000 deaths had been recorded as of September 2015. previous studies have shown that coexpression of the EBOV matrix protein (VP40), nucleoprotein (NP) and GP in mammalian cells resulted in the assembly of EBOV-like particles (EBOVLP) the fusion of -lactamase to VP40 slightly impaired the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) (18) EBOVLP functionally mimics EBOV in its entry into target cells. HEK293T cells and Vero cells were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection (CBTCCCAS) genes encoding GP, VP40, and NP of EBOV (ebola virus H.sapiens-wt/GIN/2014/Makona-Gueckedou-C07; GenBank accession no. KJ660347) were codon optimized and synthesized by GenScript (Nanjing, China) hek293T cells with pcDNA-EBOV-VP40, pcDNA-EBOV-NP, and pLenti6-Fluc were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 27,000 rpm for 3 h. pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then layered onto 20 to 60% sucrose gradients for ultracentrifugation at 39,000 rpm for EBOV GP-pseudotyped HIV (HIV/EBOVpv) was generated as previously described. hek293T cells were cotransfected with the HIV packaging plasmid psPAX2 (25), pLenti6-Fluc, and pcDNA-EBOV GP using PEI. the wells were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h. the samples were incubated with 50 l (5 g/ml) of 13C6 MAb for 2 h. the plates were washed three times with PBST (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) female BALB/c mice were inoculated with EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ or EBOVLP/Fluc/GP containing 2 g of VP40 via tail vein injection. at indicated time points postinoculation, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. HEK293T cells and Vero cells were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection (CBTCCCAS) two EBOV GP-specific MAbs, 13C6 and 6D8 (23), were produced in HEK293T cells. the synthesized genes were cloned into the backbone vector pcDNA3.1. hek293T cells were cotransfected with pcDNA-EBOV-GP, pcDNA-EBOV-VP40, and pcDNA-EBOV-NP. supernatants were collected after 48 h and clarified by centrifugation. s were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then layered onto 20 to 60% sucrose gradients for ultracentrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 2 h. resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS, giving rise to purified EBOVLP preparations. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the HIV packaging plasmid psPAX2 (25), pLenti6-Fluc, and pcDNA-EBOV GP using PEI. supernatants were normalized according to their HIV p24 levels by ELISA and then infect cells preseeded (1 104 cells/well) in 96-well plates. 105 Vero cells were seeded on glass coverslips placed in wells of 24-well plates. they were then inoculated with purified EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ or EBOVLP/Fluc/GP. the cells were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer. mice were inoculated with EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ or EBOVLP/Fluc/GP containing 2 g of VP40 via tail vein injection. mice were anesthetized using isoflurane inhalation anesthesia and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1.5 mg of VivoGlo Luciferin (Promega) high luciferase activity was detected in the samples cotransfected with the fluc plasmid and the VP40 plasmid. the sample cotransfected with the fluc and NP plasmids did not show detectable luciferase activity. luciferase activity was also detected in the medium of cells expressing NP plus GP. EBOV proteins GP, NP, VP40, and Fluc were identified by Western blotting. the presence of EBOV proteins in the collected fractions was detected by ELISA and Western blotting. 40-NP-GP-Fluc plasmids were subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. ELISA and Western blot and luciferase assays revealed cosedimentation of GP, NP, VP40, and Fluc with a profile typical for particulate structures. the fluc DNA was also detected in peak fractions containing GP-NP-VP40-Fluc. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ was tested in ELISA for binding to a GP-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 13C6, which recognizes a conformational epitope (8). EBOVLP lacking GP (designated EBOVLP/Fluc/GP), which was produced from cells cotransfected with the VP40, NP, and Fluc plasmids, was used as a negative control. ase activities in target cells inoculated with either EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ or EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ were inoculated onto fresh Vero cells. vero cell samples were harvested at the indicated time points, washed, and treated with trypsin. administration (5 min) of trypsin resulted in substantially decreased Fluc signal. no significant difference in luciferase activity was observed between samples. previous studies showed that EBOV enters host cells via endocytosis and macropinocytosis. VP40 and EEA1 (A), VP40 and LAMP1 (B) and VP40 and NPC1 (C) were stained with Hoechst to show nuclei. the cells were also stained with Hoechst to show nuclei. a known anti-EBOV neutralizing monoclonal antibody was used as the model antibody in the experiment. a known anti-EBOV neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 13C6 (8, 23) neutralized EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ entry in a dose-dependent manner. an irrelevant control MAb, 9B5, exhibited no neutralization. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ has broad tropism and is capable of transducing all three mouse cell lines (Hepa1-6, NIH 3T3 and L929) with different tissue origins. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ inoculation did not yield significant signal in the same target cells. mice were inoculated with EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ and analyzed for intracellular luciferase activity. asterisks represent significant differences: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; ***, P 0.001. mice were monitored for bioluminescence over a 12-h period. fluc signals gradually increased from 30 min to 1 h postinfection. anti-EBOV neutralizing antibody blocks EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ entry in mice. the average bioluminescence intensity for individual animals tested is shown in Fig. 6D. the results thus demonstrate the in vivo use of the EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ model for testing the protective efficacy of anti-EBOV compounds under non-BSL-4 conditions. luciferase activity was detected in the samples cotransfected with the fluc plasmid and the VP40 plasmid. the sample cotransfected with the fluc plasmid did not show detectable luciferase activity. luciferase activity was also detected in the medium of cells expressing NP plus GP (Fig. 1B, lane 4) or GP (lane 7). EBOV proteins GP, NP, VP40, and Fluc were identified by Western blotting. the presence of EBOV proteins in the collected fractions was detected by ELISA and Western blotting. the distribution of Fluc protein and Fluc plasmid was tested by luciferase assay. ELISA and Western blot and luciferase assays revealed cosedimentation of GP, NP, VP40, and Fluc with a profile typical for particulate structures. the fluc DNA was also detected in peak fractions containing GP-NP-VP40-Fluc (Fig. 1D) EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ was tested in ELISA for binding to a GP-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 13C6, which recognizes a conformational epitope (8). EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ reacted with 13C6, but not with the irrelevant control antibody 9B5 in a dose-dependent manner. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ is capable of delivery of luciferase into target cells. luciferase activities in target cells inoculated with either EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ or EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ were inoculated onto fresh Vero cells. luciferase activity was determined by a trypsin treatment experiment. trypsin treatment prior to 37\u00b0C incubation (0 min) abolished luciferase activity. early administration (5 min) of trypsin resulted in substantially decreased Fluc signal. previous studies showed that EBOV enters host cells via endocytosis. vero cells were preattached by EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ or EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for the indicated times before double staining of VP40 and EEA1 (A), VP40 and LAMP1 (B), and VP40 and NPC1 (C) the cells were also stained with Hoechst to show nuclei. EBOVLP enters the cytoplasm through NPC1+ endosomes/lysosomes. a known anti-EBOV neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 13C6 (8, 23), was used as the model antibody in the experiment. an irrelevant control MAb, 9B5, exhibited no neutralization. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ is capable of entering cells in vivo. we compared the entry abilities of EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ and EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ in mouse cell lines and primary cells isolated from organs. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ has broad tropism and is capable of transducing all three mouse cell lines. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ inoculation produces bioluminescence in mice. asterisks represent significant differences: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; ***, P 0.001. in vivo imaging was performed 12 h postinoculation. inoculated mice were subjected to live imaging at the indicated time points. the images were adjusted and are shown at the same scale. we then determined the dynamics of EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ entry in vivo. ed, as manifested by reduction of the bioluminescent signal to a level comparable to that of controls, whereas the irrelevant control MAb (9B5) did not decrease bioluminescent signals. these results thus demonstrate the in vivo use of the EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+ model for testing the protective efficacy of anti-EBOV compounds under non-BSL-4 conditions. ns, no significance (P 0.05); *, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. the primary aim of the present study was to develop a noninfectious animal model for in vivo evaluation of anti-EBOV drug candidates. EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+-based system is suitable for high-throughput screening. a recent study showed that EBOV GP-pseudotyped VSV did not accurately predict the neutralization activities of MAbs against authentic EBOV. however, following our protocol, reporter VLPs incorporating GP from different strains of EBOV could be easily generated by swapping the GP construct, thus enabling the evaluation of cross-neutralization against heterologous strains. in mice inoculated with 100 PFU of mouse-adapted EBOV, a high virus titer (104 PFU/g) was detected in the liver 1 day after virus challenge, which then increased to approximately 107 PFU/g on day 2 postinoculation (42). the mechanism for the liver tropism observed in our mouse model remains unclear. a high level of Fluc activity was detected in the EBOVLP/Fluc/GP+-transduced cell cultures at 12 h postinoculation. in vitro and in vivo data suggest that VLP-associated Fluc is somewhat protected from degradation, resulting in a prolonged half-life."}
