{"summary": "in children with acute febrile illnesses where fever persists beyond 5 days, KD must be considered as a possible diagnosis. timely and appropriate treatment can decrease the risk of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) 265/100,000 children below 5 years of age, followed by Korea and Taiwan. incidence of KD in Japan has increased more than twice over the last 20 years. 1% would get KD by 10 years of age. no definite organism has yet been identified. a cause and effect relationship has not been established. bacterial superantigens have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of KD vasculitis. thombosis and aneurysms of the coronaries were first demonstrated at autopsy in patients with KD by Tanaka et al. from japan. subsequent healing of the inflamed vessel may result in stenosis as well as thrombosis at the affected site. skin lesions have been shown to have interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of KD. three important pathways have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of KD. these include single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in transforming growth factor 2 (TGF2) and TGFR2, SNP in the gene encoding 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC);[26] and SNP in the Fc gamma receptor IIa gene. diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease Diagnosis of KD depends upon:[3,4,42,43] (A) Presence of fever for 5 days. (B) Presence of 4 of the following 5 principal clinical features. Rash Rash in KD appears during the first few days of onset of fever (acute febrile phase) it is polymorphous, varying from macular to maculopapular or morbilliform. it most commonly begins on the trunk and spreads over the next few days. it usually disappears with the resolution of fever. subacute phase of KD is characterized by desquamation beginning at the tips of fingers and toes. Beau lines may appear during the convalescent phase as transverse ridges over nails. a subset of patients with KD may exhibit distinct dermatologic manifestations. KD has surpassed rheumatic fever to become the leading cause of acquired pediatric heart disease in developing countries as well. it is not often recognized that myocarditis is also an integral part of KD. it is usually asymptomatic but can clinically manifest in small proportion of patients. majority of coronary aneurysms show regression or a decrease in size. stenosis may develop insidiously and present later in adulthood as coronary ischemia. timely diagnosis and treatment of CAAs is therefore critical. adult onset kawasaki disease Adult patients with KD have similar clinical features, including dermatologic manifestations, as in children. although rare, adult onset KD is associated with high frequency of cardiovascular involvement. dermatologist's point of view, it is important to distinguish KD from other infectious conditions, especially Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS),[65] Scarlet fever,[66] and measles. lack of other mucocutaneous features, presence of localized staphylococcal infection, accentuation of rash in the flexures, and progression to superficial blister formation differentiate SSSS from KD. almost 30% of patients were above 5 years of age at diagnosis of KD. in the united states, most cases are clustered in January, June, and July. this seasonal variation has been noted in patients with KD in some countries. a probable etiological agent (suspected fungal spore) is believed to trigger an abnormal immune response in genetically susceptible hosts. other than fungi, several different microbial agents may also trigger an immunologic response which manifests as KD. skin lesions in KD show edema, dilatation of small vessels in papillary dermis, and infiltration of CD4+T cells and CD13+ macrophages in dermis and epidermis. recurrence rate of KD among Japanese is 3%, and 1% of cases have a positive family history. acute febrile phase It lasts for initial 10\u201314 days and is characterized by fever, redness of the eyes, inflammation of tongue (strawberry tongue) and pharyngeal mucosa, unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, dry cracked lips, edema over the extremities. myocarditis may occur commonly during the acute phase manifesting as tachycardia and congestive cardiac failure. features that may be seen during this stage include hydrops of gall bladder, sterile pyuria, and BCG site reactivation. however, these features do not figure among the criteria for diagnosis of KD. CAAs on echocardiography are most commonly seen during this phase. there is no gold standard for diagnosis of KD, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic criteria is virtually impossible to define. strict application of the above mentioned clinical criteria would have high specificity but low sensitivity. this may result in several children with KD being denied treatment that can be potentially beneficial. conjunctival injection must be differentiated from conjunctivitis. extreme changes Erythema involving palms and soles, and edema of the dorsum of hands and feet occur during the acute febrile phase of the disease. some reports suggest an increased incidence of atopic dermatitis among children with KD. patients with KD may have several additional findings involving other organ systems as well. findings may create diagnostic difficulties for the treating physician. KD shock syndrome is being increasingly recognized in children with systolic hypotension. the most characteristic and clinically significant complication of KD is the occurrence of CAAs. the severity of CAAs may vary from asymptomatic coronary artery dilatation or aneurysms to giant aneurysms. asymptomatic myocarditis may be recognized by tachycardia and decreased systolic function of the left ventricle. the most characteristic and clinically significant complication of KD is the occurrence of CAAs which can be seen in 15\u201325% of untreated patients. incomplete KD is most commonly seen in infants,[60] and is often associated with development of CAAs. incomplete KD is most commonly seen in infants,[60] and is often associated with development of CAAs. adenovirus, measles, parvovirus, human herpes viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus) Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome Serum sickness Rheumatic diseases Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis Polyarteritis nodosa KD may be difficult to diagnose and manage in resource limited settings[63]. the acute febrile phase is associated with laboratory parameters that suggest ongoing inflammation. these include elevated ESR, raised CRP, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, and thrombocytosis. some children may have normocytic, normochromic anemia. echocardiography can visualize proximal segments of coronary arteries. but it is not a good modality for distal segments of coronary arteries. some children may have normocytic, normochromic anemia. two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography has long been used for the assessment of CAAs in patients with KD. corroborative findings include loss of normal tapering of the coronary arteries, increased brightness of the vessel wall, and pericardial effusion. echocardiography can visualize proximal segments of coronary arteries. IVIG should be initiated slowly to prevent or minimize infusion reactions. aseptic meningitis presenting as headache, vomiting, and irritability is another prominent adverse effect seen with IVIG. it can be prevented by slowing the rate of IVIG infusion and increasing the intake of oral fluids. the risk of development of CAAs can be brought down to less than 3% if the condition is diagnosed in time and treated appropriately. the risk of development of CAAs can be brought down to less than 3% if the condition is diagnosed in time. in most exanthemata, fever generally settles within a few days. rash and fever need to be jointly assessed by the dermatologist and pediatrician Diagnosis of KD. aneurysms less than 1 year, fusiform aneurysms, and aneurysms located in the distal coronaries have an increased likelihood of resolution. stenosis may manifest clinically as arrhythmias, congestive cardiac failure, and myocardial ischemia. children with rash and fever need to be jointly assessed by the dermatologist and pediatrician Diagnosis of KD needs to be made promptly and appropriate treatment initiated early for preventing the dreaded coronary complications associated with the disease."}
