{"summary": "multiple-emitter automated UV-C disinfection system consists of 3 ultraviolet C (UV-C) emitters with a diameter of 59 cm and a height of 195 cm. system uses a laser to identify the size of the disinfection space and to identify near-field objects. the system calculates the disinfection cycle time accordingly while rotating 360\u00b0. MERS-CoV was loaded onto glass coverslips as small droplets at a concentration of 8.9e5 pfu/mL in UV-C permeable dishes. samples were removed between 0 and 30 minutes. DMEM was layered on top to prevent drying. Virus was reduced by 2.71 log10 in 5 minutes and by 6.11 log10 in 10 minutes to undetectable levels. DISCUSSION The multiple-emitter continuous UV-C disinfection system was >99.999% effective against MHV-A59."}
