{"summary": "in 1983, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) was identified as the causative agent of the Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 30 years of pandemic, HIV-1 has infected more than 60 million individuals and killed 25 million. thirty-three million individuals are currently living with HIV-1 making this disease a major worldwide public health problem. glycoprotein gp120 undergoes conformational changes exposing the V3 loop. coreceptor binding leads to the insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the cell membrane, the creation of a hairpin loop intermediate and finally the fusion of both viral and cell membranes. most viral strains use only one coreceptor to enter host cells. effective neutralizing antibodies are impaired by the gp120 glycan shield or steric hindrance of its constant regions. only 1% of infected patients develop a broad neutralizing response against heterologous virus strains. recent identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies and mapping of their epitopes fueled interest in the humoral immune response against HIV-1. the phage biopanning process consists of iterative cycles of binding, washing and elution steps leading to the progressive selection of phages displaying peptides/proteins binding to the target of interest [14] phages may be used to display a collection of sequences (phage library), reaching up to billions of distinct sequences. the technology is versatile as it can be applied to different domains of research. phage particles or derived Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) are used to display immunogenic peptides or whole antigens to the immune system. epitope mapping relies on screening of random peptide libraries on immobilized monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to determine the linear and/or conformational epitopes recognized by these antibodies. this review is intended as an overview of the different studies conducted using phages in the field of HIV-1. it is intended as an overview of the different studies conducted using phages in the field of HIV-1. the main results are presented in tables. monoclonal antibodies were mapped to different sites on the surface of the gp120 and gp41 proteins.

constructed and panned against MAb 58.2 according to two different protocols. ization of MAb 58.2 to 14-mer peptides containing all possible point substitutions within the V3 loop sequence demonstrated that both phage display and peptide array experiments identified the same critical amino acids. biopanning with a 15-mer RPL resulted in the selection of sequences compatible with the minimal binding site (-I----G--FY-T) the mimotope with the highest affinity for the MAb 1001 was expressed in fusion with the E. coli alkaline phosphatase. binding was independent from the scaffold, although interactions were weaker when the peptide was displayed in the fusion protein format than in the phage scaffold. the same authors screened a 6-mer RPL on the MAb 268, specific to the V3 loop of the MN isolate. two sequences of the second group showed no homology to linear HIV-1 epitopes. both peptides 268.1 and 268.2 inhibited the interaction of MAb 268 with gp120, indicating that peptide 268.2 was also a mimotope of peptide 268.1. a linear 12-mer RPL and a constrained 7-mer RPL were screened against this antibody. all the sequences selected from the 12-mer RPL contained the D(K/R)W core motif, with flanking residues L, A and S present at different frequencies. the strong epitope specificity postulated by Menendez [25] is only displayed when the epitope sequence is presented in a certain structural context. biopanning on GV1A8 and GV4D3 allowed for identification of mimotopes sharing a (L/I)W motif identical to residues 111\u2013112 of the gp120 C1 domain. the epitope maps to the FNMWKND sequence satisfying the helical motif FxxWxxD. binding of MAb ID6 to gp120 or gp160 was abrogated in the presence of 12-mer mimotopes. heptapeptide mimics only slightly impaired this binding, supporting the hypothesis that the MAb-ID6 epitope probably encompasses residues additional to the FxDWxF motif. phage-borne B2.1 peptide was used to screen the Fab library from which b12 was identified. the peptide was immunogenic in mice and rabbits but did not elicit significant anti-gp120 cross-reactive Abs titers. clones shared a M/VArSD consensus motif as previously observed. b12 was conducted with the Mapitope algorithm developed by Enshell-Seijffers et al. to facilitate the identification of discontinuous epitopes. a constrained 12-mer RPL was screened against b12 and selected sequences were compared to those obtained from previous panning experiments performed against b12 [18,29,30,43]. gp120 unable to compete with 5145A CD4-binding site specific MAb. 2.1.1.5. extreme C-terminus of gp120 forms a pocket which may interact with gp41. epitope mapping of MAb 803\u201315.6 achieved by cross-blocking experiments on gp120 suggested that the Ab recognized residues 502\u2013516. the algorithm was finally applied to the Mab CG10, an Ab with an unknown epitope competing with the Mab 17b for the binding to the CD4/gp120 complex. the epitope was capable of binding Mab CG10 when reconstituted in a phage scaffold. peptide 2G12.1 complexed to the synthetic 2G12.1 peptide was compared to structures of 2G12-oligomannose epitopes. the peptide selected from RPL panning experiments is not a structural mimic of the 2G12 oligomannose epitope. the phagotope 2G12.1 was used in rabbit immunization experiments and elicited high titers of peptide-specific antibodies. gp41 ID GKLIC region Reactivities of positive clones assessed on 22 LTNP, 25 HIV, 50 HD. 12-mer, 7-mer, 7-mer-c RPLs Microwells coated with purified IgG HIV+ (HAART) IgG Panning on

xCxxSDLx3CI) Biotinylated IgG1b12 captured on a 20-mer RPL was constructed and panned against MAb 58.2 according to two different protocols. a phage display technology was applied to the MAb 58.2. the micropan protocol allowed for the identification of sequences sharing the same motif, of which two were also identified in the SA-Bio panning. phage display and peptide array experiments identified the same critical amino acids, thereby confirming the quality of the 20-mer RPL. clones were obtained and presented the common motif (R/K/H)xGR mimicking the crown of the V3 loop sequence. the mimotope with the highest affinity for the MAb 1001 was expressed in fusion with the E. coli alkaline phosphatase. a representative sequence from the first group (268.1, HLGPGR), corresponded to the crown of the V3 loop, a linear epitope, while two sequences of the second group (268.2, KAIHRI and 268.3, KSLHRH) showed no homology to linear HIV-1 epitopes. both peptides 268.1 and 268.2 inhibited the interaction of MAb 268 with gp120, indicating that peptide 268. menendez et al. screened a panel of 17 libraries of linear and constrained peptides against the MAb 2F5. they deduced that residues flanking the DKW core were important for high-affinity binding to the MAb. they subsequently constructed and screened two phage sublibraries displaying 12 random residues upstream or downstream of the DKW core. each clone bound 2F5 according to a different mechanism. immunotherapy studies performed with both linear and constrained forms of the peptide in mice and rabbits resulted in the inhibition of cell fusion only with sera of rabbits immunized with the linear peptide. a 20-mer RPL was used to analyze two different mouse MAbs recognizing non-overlapping sequences between residues 1 and 142 of gp120. resistance to the ADCC-inducing MAb ID6 resulted in the identification of phages with TxxFxxWxxD (12-mer RPL) and FxDWxF (7-mer and 7-mer-c RPLs) motifs homologous to the C1 domain of gp120. heptapeptide mimics only slightly impaired this binding. a phage-borne B2.1 peptide was used to screen the Fab library from which b12 was identified. the peptide was immunogenic in mice and rabbits but did not elicit significant anti-gp120 cross-reactive Abs titers. a second- and third-generation of semi-RPL containing fixed consensus motifs were constructed. mapitope algorithm was developed by Enshell-Seijffers et al. to facilitate the identification of discontinuous epitopes. a constrained 12-mer RPL was screened against b12 and selected sequences were compared to those obtained from previous panning experiments performed against b12 [18,29,30,43]. the two most affine peptides (AECGPAEPRGAWVC and AECGPYEPRGDWTCC) were used to immunize rabbits and elicited antibodies binding to recombinant monomeric gp120. but generated Abs seemed to target a different epitope since they were unable to compete with the 5145A CD4-binding site specific MAb. 2.1.1.5. the algorithm was finally applied to the Mab CG10, an Ab with an unknown epitope competing with the Mab 17b for the binding to the CD4/gp120 complex. a 15-mer RPL against MAb 50\u201369 yielded several phages which only shared a Trp residue. menendez et al. screened a set of previously described RPLs against 2G12 and identified one phagotope specifically binding to 2G12 (2G12.1). the peptide selected from RPL panning experiments is not a structural mimic of the 2G12 oligomannose epitope. the phagotope 2G12.1 was used in rabbit immunization experiments. mers selected for peptides defining the gp41 ID epitope CSGKLIC were further assessed against a panel of HIV positive plasma. the levels of reactivity of these phagotopes were further assessed against a panel of HIV positive plasma. 12-mer, 7-mer, 7-mer-c

GKLIC region, other ID regions and MPER domain) clones showed no homology to linear HIV-1 regions and were analyzed with the 3DEX software. epitope region in the MPER domain (NWFNLTQTLMPR) or the lentivirus lytic peptide 2 (SLxxLRL) shared homologies with the C1 domain (KxWWxA) and the crown of the V3 loop (Kx3IGPHxxY) of gp120. reactivity against the V3 loop-like phages decreased slightly in all plasma samples. t al. evaluated the reliability of using targeted antigen gene fragment libraries for the identification of epitopes recognized by antibodies elicited in rabbits immunized with p24. only one phagotope mapped to the central region of Gag (269\u2013310) at the end of the second round, selected phages displaying longer inserts of 40 to 50 AA corresponding to the N- and

the validity of the screenings performed. a monoclonal antibody (MAb 19b) isolated from an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient showed that not all residues within this recognition motif were crucial for reactivity. the mimotope with the highest affinity for the MAb 1001 was expressed in fusion with the E. coli alkaline phosphatase. binding was independent from the scaffold, although interactions were weaker when the peptide was displayed in the fusion protein format than in the phage scaffold. a 6-mer RPL on the MAb 110-A allows the selection of numerous sequences with a consensus motif. a

different protocols. a monoclonal antibody (MAb 19b) was isolated from an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient and recognizing the xxIx3PGRAFYTT motif within the V3 loop sequence. a 15-mer RPL resulted in the selection of sequences compatible with the minimal binding site (-I----G--FY-T) inferred from gp120 sequence alignment from clades A to F which bound MAb 19b. ELISA, Western Blot and SPR assays assessed binding of the phage and fusion protein to the MAb 1001. binding was independent from the scaffold, although interactions were weaker when the peptide was displayed in the fusion protein format than in the phage scaffold. the screening of a 6-mer RPL on the MAb 110-A allows the selection of numerous sequences with a consensus motif. peptides 268.1 and 268.2 inhibited the interaction of MAb 268 with gp120. both peptides were able to elicit gp120-reacting antibodies. peptides 268.1 and 268.2 were also a mimotope of peptide 268.1. ala substitution and deletion studies revealed that each clone bound 2F5 according to a different mechanism. the 2F5 paratope was composed of two binding domains recognizing the DKW core with strong specificity or multispecifically binding to the residues located at its C-terminus. additional investigations were recently conducted on the BNtAb 2F5 epitope. biopanning performed on GV1A8 allowed for identification of mimotopes sharing a (L/I)W motif identical to residues 111\u2013112 of the gp120 C1 domain. biopanning on MAb GV4D3 yielded sequences with a trend towards an Nx3WxxD motif.

a further 420-fold improvement of the binding affinity of 3B3 for gp120 was achieved, reaching 15 pM [72] the authors engineered 3B3 ScFv fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. the 3B3(Fv)-PE38 fusion immunotoxin bound to the MN strain of gp120 with the same affinity as the parental Fab antibody and specifically killed a gp120-expressing cell line and a chronically HIV-infected lymphocytic cell line. the authors performed further epitope masking by using different selection strategies with the same Fab phage library. the first strategy involved masking the CD4-binding site epitopes either with soluble CD4 or with a CD4BS Ab. clones from the unselected library recognized the V3 loop. clones from the unselected library targeted the CD4 BS or a CD4-induced epitope encompassing the C1 region. most of the circulating HIV-1 specific antibodies were elicited by viral debris. a library of light chains prepared from three lupus patients [132] was screened with an electrophilic analogue of gp120 residues 421\u2013433 to isolate antibodies capable of binding and hydrolyzing gp120. one of the light chain clones selected (SKL6) cleaved a gp120 421\u2013433-reporter substrate as well as full-length gp120. more than 30 phagotopes were tested for their ability to neutralize 3 clade B and 3 clade C strains. the breadth of neutralization potency appeared to be correlated to the presence of an YYD motif in the C terminus of A12. five clones with increased affinity for gp120 and presenting mutations within the CD4 V1 domain were identified. all of these clones inhibited HIV-1 entry with IC50 ranging from 0.2 to 1 g/mL. phage display technology was used to improve the affinity of the Mab 447-52D for its V3 loop epitope. the 12p1 peptide was further investigated and shown to inhibit binding of monomeric YU2 gp120 to both sCD4 and 17b with IC50 values of 1.1 and 1.6 M respectively. the 12p1 peptide also inhibited binding of these ligands to trimeric envelope glycoproteins and blocked binding of gp120 to the native coreceptor CCR5. X5 is the first BNtAb recognizing a receptor-induced epitope identified to date. the sulfated form of the XD3 peptide recognized X5, R4 and dual-tropic strains and inhibited HIV-1 entry in the high micromolar range. authors screened a 7-mer RPL against Salp15 and isolated a HVITPLW sequence homologous to an (I/L)TPL motif. they mapped the interaction site of full-length Salp15 protein or of its 95\u2013114 C-terminal domain were able to bind to the PCVKLTPLCVTLNCT peptide within the gp120 C1/V1 region. gp120 displays superantigenic properties giving it the ability to bind and stimulate non-immune B cells to secrete VH3 Ig in vitro. gp120 is the most represented immunoglobulin gene family in healthy adults (54% of peripheral repertoire) three IgG Fabs were submitted to reverse mutations to reconstitute the germline amino acid residues. the higher affinity and neutralizing ability of S20 were due to the Ala30Arg and Ala31Asp somatic mutations in the HCDR1 region of the germline gene sequence. the m19 Ab targeted highly conserved epitopes located near the CD4 binding site or the coreceptor binding site. the high immunogenic capacity of the conserved non-neutralizing epitopes could divert the immune system from actually neutralizing epitopes. the authors suggested that these newly identified MAbs could be used as probes to further characterize conserved non-neutralizing epitopes. Fabs sublibraries of Z13 variants were engineered and screened against an MPER peptide and gp41. the selected Z13 variant displayed an over 100-fold increase in neutralization breadth and potency compared to the parental Z13 MAb. the most mutated variant (M66.6) neutralized HIV-1 with a higher potency than M66. the gp41 hydrophobic pocket fused to a trimeric coiled-coil creates grooves where the CHR bind. the viral and cellular membranes are brought into close proximity, enabling fusion. d-peptides over l-peptide inhibitors are their resistance to natural proteases. peptides with consensus motif Cx5EWxWLC were identified and inhibited cell fusion or HIV-1 entry into cells with an IC50 in the micromolar range. the most potent peptide was a 8-mer with a Cx3EWxWLC motif which was probably selected from the 10-mer sublibrary. in 2005, there was no evidence of Abs capable of binding the highly conserved NHR region targeted by the T20 inhibitor. Miller et al. constructed a phage-displayed nave ScFv library and screened it against a synthetic protein mimicking the 6-HB. this construct lacks one of the three CHRs and the NHR trimer is partially exposed, presenting a single binding site for a CHR mimic. a minimalist Fab library was screened against antigens comprising the trimeric coiled-coil NHR fused or not to the gp41 six-helix bundle. two clones, Fabs 3663 and 3670, inhibited cell fusion while one Fab 3674 clone selected against NCCG-gp41 was also effective in infection neutralization assays. the authors subsequently demonstrated that the N36Mut(e,g) peptide presenting mutations within the 5th and 7th AA residues of the heptad repeat [158] increased the temporal window of viral sensitivity to Fab 3674 and thereby synergistically enhanced the neutralizing activity of Fab 3674. a Fab sublibrary was created by affinity maturation of the Fab 3674 HCDR2 loop and screened against NCCG-gp41 p140 (gp140 R2) isolated from asymptomatic seropositive patient with BNtAbs was reported to elicit BNtAbs in monkeys. the competitive antigen panning approach against gp140/120 thus allows the selection of Abs recognizing conformational epitopes on gp41, which are not properly folded when gp41 is used. Viral Protein of Regulation (Vpr) is involved in the nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex (PIC) and induction of apoptosis after cell cycle arrest and can be packaged into virions in quantities similar to the structural proteins. a 7-mer RPL was used to determine a common motif involved in the interaction between Vpr and its various ligands. in 2004, Desjobert et al. screened a 7-mer RPL against recombinant HIV-1 integrase and identified a high affinity phagotope displaying the FHNHGKQ sequence. this sequence inhibited the strand transfer activity of IN by competing with the target DNA, providing the proof-of-concept that IN is also a valuable target for phage display. the TAR RNA sequence adopts a specific structure recognized by the basic Arginine Rich Motif (ARM) of Tat. in 2005, Kolb and Boiziau screened a 12-mer RPL against TAR RNA molecules and selected 12-mer and unexpectedly 57-mer sequences from the library. psi RNA was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated surface by annealing its 5\u2032-end to a biotinylated oligomer. the most efficient binder was shown to strongly reduce virus release by infected cells. a similar screening campaign was conducted, where the 5\u2032-end of the psi RNA was covalently immobilized. peptides bound the C-terminus of Vif with high affinity. these peptides inhibited HIV-1 replication in cultured cells. the discovery of Abs targeting Nef and Vif applicable to intrabody-based therapy may represent an alternative way to impede viral replication. the panning procedure yielded clones binding specifically to Nef 138-10/A24. Clones ScFv3 and ScFv27 were able to bind to Nef 138-10/A24 expressed at the cell surface. this study was the first to address the identification of monoclonal antibodies binding specifically to an immunodominant HIV-1 CTL epitope loaded on an HLA class I molecule. a semisynthetic phage display library of human ScFvs with randomized heavy and light chain CDR3 was screened against recombinant RT. five different ScFv Abs directed against RT were isolated, of which three (F-6, 6E9, 5B11) also inhibited RDDP activity. Fabs were directed against sites adjacent to the Rev basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) and to the activation domain (residues 75\u201388) two years later, Jensen et al. screened a 15-mer RPL to identify potential Rev peptidic antagonists. three groups of sequences shared a SRLxG(x)2\u20133R motif (group I) or featuring no sequence similarity (group III) were obtained. a corresponding ScFv has been engineered and may have anti-HIV-1 properties. phagotopes competed with phagotopes for binding to CA and inhibiting capsid assembly in vitro. one of these sequences competed with phagotopes for binding to CA. the phage display technology identifies HIV-1 epitopes susceptible to discriminate between successfully immunized vaccinees and seroconverters. they constructed a phage library displaying the full HIV-1 genome and screened it against the sera of newly infected HIV-1 positive individuals. they identified conserved epitopes present in gp41 and in Gag p6 that were not part of the vaccine used at that moment.

Vyroubalova et al. screened a partially randomized 10-mer phage library (CDx3KPCALLRYx10-PIII) using competitive elution with a CCL5 analogue (NNY-CCL5, 100 nM) and selected a unique peptide (ALLRYNPFYYLSFSP) this peptide was further optimized through N-terminal extension, exon shuffling and biopanning. in 2010, llamas were immunized with CXCR4-expressing HEK293T cells. a phage library was constructed from the PBMCs of immunized camelids. several phage clones inhibiting the binding of labeled CXCL12 chemokine to the receptor were identified. the CD40 receptor and its CD40L ligand are involved in several biological processes including cell proliferation, activation and production of cytokines and chemokines. viruses were proposed to selectively downregulate or even deplete the pool of CD40L-expressing CD4+ T cells. the phage display technology has also been applied for fundamental studies of host proteins. a study focusing on the roles and diversity of the anti-CD34 autoimmune repertoire in the myelosuppression appearing in HIV-1 infected individuals was reported by Rubinstein et al. combinant gp120 JL413 SKL6 NA 0.1\u201325.6 g/mL NA 23135, SF-162, ZA009, BR004, Ug246 NA gp120-hydrolyzing Abs [75,76] gp120 (CD4 BS) CD4 V1 and V1-V2 variants Recombinant gp120 E6, B6, 22, F8, D11 NA 0.2\u20131 g/mL BH 7-mer, 7-mer-c and 12-mer RPL sCD4-89.6 Env on retroviral particles XD3 NA 50 M NL4-3, D117III NA [84] gp41 MPER HIV-1 infected FDA-2 patient FAb Z13-derived Fab MPER peptide Z13 Z13e1 NA >40\u2013190 g/mL 2\u2013190 nM B, C and E NA.

Fab Libraries Burton et al. were the first to report the construction of a phage-displayed Fab library from the bone marrow of an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient with high titers of gp120-specific Abs. clones displaying high affinities (10 nM) for gp120 were selected. a pro96Glu mutation of the HCDR3 was identified in the clone with highest affinity, 3B3, which bound IIIb gp120 with an 8-fold improved affinity compared to the parental b12 Fab. a further 420-fold improvement of the binding affinity of 3B3 for gp120 was achieved, reaching 15 pM [72] the authors engineered 3B3 ScFv fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. the 3B3(Fv)-PE38 fusion immunotoxin bound to the MN strain of gp120 with the same affinity as the parental Fab antibody and specifically killed a gp120-expressing cell line and a chronically HIV-infected lymphocytic cell line. clones were influenced by the V2 loop and the CD4-binding site. one of these Fabs (L78) featured a broad neutralization spectrum against various HIV-1 strains. the first strategy involved masking the CD4-binding site epitopes. clones from the unselected library recognized the V3 loop. clones from the unselected library targeted the CD4 BS or a CD4-induced epitope encompassing the C1 region. most of the circulating HIV-1 specific antibodies were elicited by viral debris. a library of light chains prepared from three lupus patients was screened with an electrophilic analogue of gp120 residues 421\u2013433 to isolate antibodies capable of binding and hydrolyzing gp120. one of the light chain clones selected (SKL6) cleaved a gp120 421\u2013433-reporter substrate as well as full-length gp120. the advantages of reduced antibody formats were also explored with naturally occurring smaller antibodies more than 30 phagotopes were tested for their ability to neutralize 3 clade B and 3 clade C strains. the breadth of neutralization potency appeared to be correlated to the presence of an YYD motif in the C terminus of A12 CDR3. in 1997, Krykbaev et al. constructed a phage-displayed library of CD4 V1 and V1-V2 variants generated by error-prone PCR and screened it against gp120. all of these clones inhibited HIV-1 entry with IC50 ranging from 0.2 to 1 g/mL. the 12p1 peptide was further investigated and shown to inhibit binding of monomeric YU2 gp120 to both sCD4 and 17b with IC50 values of 1.1 and 1.6 M respectively. the 12p1 peptide also inhibited binding of these ligands to trimeric envelope glycoproteins and blocked binding of gp120 to the native coreceptor CCR5. X5 neutralized all isolates with potency comparable to that of b12. X5 is the first BNtAb recognizing a receptor-induced epitope identified to date. X5 is the first BNtAb recognizing a receptor-induced epitope. the authors screened a 7-mer RPL against Salp15 and isolated a HVITPLW sequence homologous to an (I/L)TPL motif of the gp120 C1/V1 domain. they mapped the interaction site of full-length Salp15 protein or of its 95\u2013114 C-terminal domain were able to bind to the PCVKLTPLCVTLNCT peptide within the gp120 C1/V1 region. gp120-binding Fabs originated from different VH germline genes. gp120 displays superantigenic properties giving it the ability to bind and stimulate non-immune B cells to secrete VH3 Ig in vitro. gp120 is the most represented immunoglobulin gene family in healthy adults. the three IgG Fabs were proposed to be associated with the 100-fold affinity increase for gp120 and higher neutralizing activity of IgG Fab S8 (ID50 = 23 ng/mL) than of IgM M025 (ID50 = 3 g/mL) the higher affinity and neutralizing ability of S20 were due to the Ala30Arg and Ala31Asp somatic mutations. the m19 Ab targeted highly conserved non-neutralizing epitopes near the CD4 binding site or the coreceptor binding site. the high immunogenic capacity of the conserved non-neutralizing epitopes of such antibodies could divert the immune system from actually neutralizing epitopes. Fabs sublibraries of Z13 variants were engineered and screened against an MPER peptide and gp41 [86] to enhance binding potency. the selected Z13e1 variant displayed an over 100-fold increase in neutralization breadth and potency compared to the parental Z13 MAb. the gp41-encoded fusion peptide collapses to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) the NHR form a trimeric coiled-coil, creating grooves where the CHR bind. the viral and cellular membranes are brought into close proximity, enabling fusion. a synthetic CHR mimic Enfuvirtide (T20) is highly conserved among HIV-1 sequences. pocket-specific binders with consensus motif Cx5EWxWLC were identified and inhibited cell fusion or HIV-1 entry into cells with an IC50. the most potent peptide was a 8-mer with a Cx3EWxWLC motif which was probably selected from the 10-mer sublibrary because its smaller size favored a more compact hydrophobic core upon binding. in 2005, there was no evidence of Abs capable of binding the highly conserved NHR region targeted by the T20 inhibitor. Miller et al. constructed a phage-displayed nave ScFv library and screened it against a synthetic protein mimicking the 6-HB. this construct lacks one of the three CHRs and the NHR trimer is partially exposed. Fab library was screened against antigens including the trimeric coiled-coil NHR fused or not to the gp41 six-helix bundle. two clones, Fabs 3663 and 3670, inhibited cell fusion. one Fab 3674 clone selected against NCCG-gp41 was also effective in infection neutralization assays. a Fab sublibrary was created by affinity maturation of the Fab 3674 HCDR2 loop and screened against NCCG-gp41. three N35CCGN13 binders were selected, and one of them, 8K8, displayed neutralizing activity against HXB2. a more complex Fab library was constructed from the FDA-2 HIV-1-positive patient from whom Z13 Ab had previously been isolated. a recombinant gp140 (gp140 R2) isolated from an asymptomatic seropositive patient with BNtAbs was reported to elicit BNtAbs in monkeys. the competitive antigen panning approach against gp140/120 thus allows the selection of Abs recognizing conformational epitopes on gp41. Vpr is involved in the nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex (PIC) as well as in the induction of apoptosis after cell cycle arrest and can be packaged into virions in quantities similar to the structural proteins [160\u2013163]. in 2004, Desjobert et al. screened a 7-mer RPL against recombinant HIV-1 integrase and identified a high affinity phagotope displaying the FHNHGKQ sequence. this sequence inhibited the strand transfer activity of IN by competing with the target DNA, providing the proof-of-concept that IN is also a valuable target for phage display. cyclinT1 or interacting with the Tat/TAR recognition motif (TRM) were isolated after panning against the 272 N-terminal amino acids of cyclinT1. one of these ScFvs inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation without impairing cellular basal transcription or inducing apoptosis. psi RNA was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated surface by annealing its 5\u2032-end to a biotinylated oligomer. the most efficient binder was shown to strongly reduce virus release by infected cells. a similar screening campaign was conducted, where the 5\u2032-end of the psi RNA was covalently immobilized. peptides bound the C-terminus of Vif with high affinity. these peptides inhibited HIV-1 replication in cultured cells. the discovery of Abs targeting Nef and Vif applicable to intrabody-based therapy may represent an alternative way to impede viral replication. et al. screened pooled ScFv libraries [173] on an immunodominant HLA-A*2402(A24) restricted CTL epitope within the Nef protein. Clones ScFv3 and ScFv27 were able to bind to Nef 138-10/A24 expressed at the cell surface. a semisynthetic phage display library of human ScFvs with randomized heavy and light chain CDR3 was screened against recombinant RT. five different ScFv Abs directed against RT were isolated, of which three (F-6, 6E9, 5B11) inhibited RDDP activity while the light chain peptide had no effect. two Fabs were identified from a Fab library derived from the Ab repertoire of an HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patient. these Fabs were directed against sites adjacent to the Rev basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) and to the activation domain (residues 75\u201388) two years later, Jensen et al. screened a 15-mer RPL to identify potential Rev peptidic antagonists. a corresponding ScFv has been engineered and may have anti-HIV-1 properties. phagotopes competed with phagotopes for binding to CA and inhibiting capsid assembly in vitro. the phage display technology was used to identify HIV-1 epitopes. they identified conserved epitopes present in gp41 and in Gag p6 that were not part of the vaccine used at that moment. they established a new detection test that demonstrated over 99% selectivity and sensitivity for the early detection of seroconversion. a pro96Glu mutation of the HCDR3 was identified in the clone with highest affinity, 3B3, which bound IIIb gp120 with an 8-fold improved affinity compared to the parental b12 Fab. a further 420-fold improvement of the binding affinity of 3B3 for gp120 was achieved, reaching 15 pM [72] the authors engineered 3B3 ScFv fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. the 3B3(Fv)-PE38 fusion immunotoxin bound to the MN strain of gp120 with the same affinity as the parental Fab antibody and specifically killed a gp120-expressing cell line and a chronically HIV-infected lymphocytic cell line. clones were influenced by the V2 loop and the CD4-binding site. one of these Fabs (L78) featured a broad neutralization spectrum against various HIV-1 strains. the first strategy involved masking the CD4-binding site epitopes. clones from the unselected library recognized the V3 loop. clones from the unselected library targeted the CD4 BS or a CD4-induced epitope encompassing the C1 region. most of the circulating HIV-1 specific antibodies were elicited by viral debris. a library of light chains prepared from three lupus patients was screened with an electrophilic analogue of gp120 residues 421\u2013433 to isolate antibodies capable of binding and hydrolyzing gp120. one of the light chain clones selected (SKL6) cleaved a gp120 421\u2013433-reporter substrate as well as full-length gp120. the advantages of reduced antibody formats were also explored with naturally occurring smaller antibodies more than 30 phagotopes were tested for their ability to neutralize 3 clade B and 3 clade C strains. the breadth of neutralization potency appeared to be correlated to the presence of an YYD motif in the C terminus of A12 CDR3. in 1997, Krykbaev et al. constructed a phage-displayed library of CD4 V1 and V1-V2 variants generated by error-prone PCR and screened it against gp120. all of these clones inhibited HIV-1 entry with IC50 ranging from 0.2 to 1 g/mL. the 12p1 peptide was further investigated and shown to inhibit binding of monomeric YU2 gp120 to both sCD4 and 17b with IC50 values of 1.1 and 1.6 M respectively. the 12p1 peptide also inhibited binding of these ligands to trimeric envelope glycoproteins and blocked binding of gp120 to the native coreceptor CCR5.

Fab Libraries Burton et al. were the first to report the construction of a phage-displayed Fab library from the bone marrow of an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient with high titers of gp120-specific Abs. the library was screened against recombinant gp120 from the IIIb isolate and clones displaying high affinities (10 nM) were selected. a further 420-fold improvement of the binding affinity of 3B3 for gp120 was achieved, reaching 15 pM [72] this led to the construction of many Fab libraries to elucidate the immune response to HIV-1 and to identify therapeutic antibodies. the authors engineered 3B3 ScFv fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. ditzel et al. panned a Fab library from an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient on immobilized gp120 and identified two dominant clones targeting the CD4-binding site. the authors performed further epitope masking by using different selection strategies with the same Fab phage library. isolated Fabs bound targets with affinities ranging from 4 to 300 nM. these FAbs targeting weakly immunogenic regions were not neutralizing. clones from the unselected library recognized the V3 loop. a subset of gp120-binding antibodies was shown to hydrolyze gp120 by a mechanism analogous to serine protease. a subset of gp120-binding antibodies was shown to hydrolyze gp120 by a mechanism analogous to serine protease. nanobodies were successfully used for panning against various pathogens. forsman et al. immunized llamas with a recombinant gp120 of subtype B/C. these nanobodies bound gp120 with affinities from 0.1 to 1 nM. Fab Libraries Burton et al. were the first to report the construction of a phage-displayed Fab library from the bone marrow of an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient with high titers of gp120-specific Abs. one Fab (b12) was able to neutralize the clade C strains. the b12 Fab is the most potent neutralizing Ab isolated to date. a pro96Glu mutation of the HCDR3 was identified in the clone with highest affinity, 3B3, which bound IIIb gp120 with an 8-fold improved affinity. a further 420-fold improvement of the binding affinity of 3B3 for gp120 was achieved. authors engineered 3B3 ScFv fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. the 3B3(Fv)-PE38 fusion immunotoxin killed a gp120-expressing cell line and a chronically HIV-infected lymphocytic cell line. most antibodies obtained through screening Fab libraries against monomeric gp120 targeted epitopes related to the CD4-binding domain the authors performed further epitope masking by using different selection strategies with the same Fab phage library. the first strategy involved masking the CD4-binding site epitopes either with soluble CD4 or with a CD4BS Ab. clones from the unselected library recognized the V3 loop. clones from the unselected library targeted the CD4 BS or a CD4-induced epitope encompassing the C1 region. most of the circulating HIV-1 specific antibodies were elicited by viral debris and were therefore devoid of neutralizing activity. the nucleophilic region responsible for this activity was localized in the light chain [134,135], a library of light chains prepared from three lupus patients [132] was screened with an electrophilic analogue of gp120 residues 421\u2013433 to isolate antibodies capable of binding and hydrolyzing gp120. the nanobodies were successfully used for panning against various pathogens (reviewed by Vanlandschoot [137]. more than 30 phagotopes were tested for their ability to neutralize 3 clade B and 3 clade C strains. the breadth of neutralization potency appeared to be correlated to the presence of an YYD motif in the C terminus of A12. five clones with increased affinity for gp120 and presenting mutations within the CD4 V1 domain were identified. all of these clones inhibited HIV-1 entry with IC50 ranging from 0.2 to 1 g/mL. phage display technology was used to improve the affinity of the Mab 447-52D for its V3 loop epitope. the 12p1 peptide was further investigated and shown to inhibit binding of monomeric YU2 gp120 to both sCD4 and 17b with IC50 values of 1.1 and 1.6 M respectively. the 12p1 peptide inhibited binding of monomeric YU2 gp120 to both sCD4 and 17b with IC50 values of 1.1 and 1.6 M respectively. clades A, B, C, D, F and G demonstrated that X5 neutralized all isolates with potency comparable to that of b12. X5 is the first BNtAb recognizing a receptor-induced epitope identified to date. X5 is the first BNtAb recognizing a receptor-induced epitope identified to date. the GPNGQTCAEKNKCVGHIPGC peptide also interacted with gp120. the authors screened a 7-mer RPL against Salp15 and isolated a HVITPLW sequence homologous to an (I/L)TPL motif. they mapped the interaction site of full-length Salp15 protein or of its 95\u2013114 C-terminal domain were able to bind to the PCVKLTPLCVTLNCT peptide within the several studies reported that gp120 displays superantigenic properties giving it the ability to bind and stimulate non-immune B cells to secrete VH3 Ig in vitro. the VH3 antibody family is the most represented immunoglobulin gene family in healthy adults (54% of peripheral repertoire) the three IgG Fabs were submitted to reverse mutations to reconstitute the germline amino acid residues. the higher affinity and neutralizing ability of S20 were due to the Ala30Arg and Ala31Asp somatic mutations in the HCDR1 region of the germline gene sequence. the m19 Ab targeted highly conserved epitopes located near the CD4 binding site or the coreceptor binding site. the high immunogenic capacity of the conserved non-neutralizing epitopes could divert the immune system from actually neutralizing epitopes. the authors suggested that these newly identified MAbs could be used as probes to further characterize conserved non-neutralizing epitopes. Fabs sublibraries of Z13 variants were engineered and screened against an MPER peptide and gp41. the selected Z13 variant displayed an over 100-fold increase in neutralization breadth and potency compared to the parental Z13 MAb. the most mutated variant (M66.6) neutralized HIV-1 with a higher potency than M66. the gp41 hydrophobic pocket fused to a soluble trimeric coiled-coil creates grooves where the CHR bind. the viral and cellular membranes are brought into close proximity, enabling fusion. a synthetic CHR mimic Enfuvirtide (T20) is highly conserved among HIV-1 sequences. binders with consensus motif Cx5EWxWLC were identified and inhibited cell fusion or HIV-1 entry into cells with an IC50. the most potent peptide was a 8-mer with a Cx3EWxWLC motif. the most potent peptide was a 8-mer with a Cx3EWxWLC motif. in 2005, there was no evidence of Abs capable of binding the highly conserved NHR region targeted by the T20 inhibitor. this construct lacks one of the three CHRs and the NHR trimer is partially exposed, presenting a single binding site for a CHR mimic. the authors identified a ScFv (D5) which blocks HIV-1 entry and inhibits infection in a single-cycle infectivity assay. Fab libraries targeting 6-HB, 6-HB, trimeric coiled-coil and trimeric coiled-coil. Fabs 3663 and 3670 inhibited cell fusion while one Fab 3674 clone selected against NCCG-gp41 was also effective in infection neutralization assays. the authors demonstrated that the N36Mut(e,g) peptide presenting mutations within the 5th and 7th AA residues of the heptad repeat [158] increased the temporal window of viral sensitivity to Fab 3674 and thereby synergistically enhanced the neutralizing activity of Fab 3674. a Fab sublibrary was created by affinity maturation of the Fab 3674 HCDR2 loop and screened against NCCG-gp41. gp140/120 isolated from asymptomatic seropositive patient with BNtAbs was reported to elicit BNtAbs in monkeys. competitive antigen panning (CAP) was designed to outcompete phagotopes binding to an immunodominant region of a multi-domain target through concomitant addition of an excess of soluble forms of this immunodominant domain. viral protein of regulation (Vpr) is involved in the nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex (PIC) and induction of apoptosis after cell cycle arrest and can be packaged into virions in quantities similar to the structural proteins. a 7-mer RPL was used to determine a common motif involved in the interaction between Vpr and its various ligands. in 2004, Desjobert et al. screened a 7-mer RPL against recombinant HIV-1 integrase and identified a high affinity phagotope displaying the FHNHGKQ sequence. this sequence inhibited the strand transfer activity of IN by competing with the target DNA, providing the proof-of-concept that IN is also a valuable target for phage display. the TAR RNA sequence adopts a specific structure recognized by the basic Arginine Rich Motif (ARM) of Tat. in 2005, Kolb and Boiziau screened a 12-mer RPL against TAR RNA molecules and selected 12-mer and unexpectedly 57-mer sequences from the library. the latter proposed to arise from incomplete enzyme restriction during the construction of the initial library. psi RNA immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated surface by annealing its 5\u2032-end to a biotinylated oligomer. the most efficient binder was shown to strongly reduce virus release by infected cells. the most prevalent sequence (SYQWWWHSPQTL) was expressed in fusion with the maltose-binding protein. peptides bound the C-terminus of Vif with high affinity and inhibited HIV-1 replication in cultured cells. the discovery of Abs targeting Nef and Vif applicable to intrabody-based therapy may represent an alternative way to impede viral replication. the panning procedure yielded clones binding specifically to Nef 138-10/A24. Clones ScFv3 and ScFv27 were able to bind to Nef 138-10/A24 expressed at the cell surface and retained this specificity when expressed as reconstituted whole IgGs. this recent study was the first to address the identification of monoclonal antibodies binding specifically to an immunodominant HIV-1 CTL epitope loaded on an HLA class I molecule 5F and 5G recognized an epitope similar or closely related to the epitope targeted by the mouse MAb (7C4) previously described by the same authors. a semisynthetic phage display library of human ScFvs with randomized heavy and light chain CDR3 was screened against recombinant RT. Fabs were directed against sites adjacent to the Rev basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) and to the activation domain (residues 75\u201388) two years later, Jensen et al. screened a 15-mer RPL to identify potential Rev peptidic antagonists. three groups of sequences shared a SRLxG(x)2\u20133R motif (group I) or featuring no sequence similarity (group III) were obtained. Sticht et al. screened a 12-mer RPL against the capsid (CA) protein generated by proteolysis of the Gag precursor and identified phagotopes. one of these sequences competed with phagotopes for binding to CA and inhibiting capsid assembly in vitro. mutants were constructed and confirmed the importance of this motif for Vpr binding. the motif might be used to deliver a fusion protein into the HIV-1 virion. in 2003, Krichevsky et al. conducted a study to elucidate the exact role of Vpr and its contribution to the nuclear import process of the HIV-1 PIC. the first study was conducted in 1996, when Pilkington et al. screened a Fab library constructed from the Ab repertoire of an HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patient. a non-immune human ScFv phage-displayed library was explored to identify peptides binding to cyclinT1. lener et al. screened a 9-mer RPL against NCp7 and selected phagotopes sharing a PPx(D/E)R consensus motif. a similar screening campaign was conducted, where the 5\u2032-end of the psi RNA was covalently immobilized, leaving the secondary structure intact. Nef/Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif) HIV-1 accessory proteins Nef and Vif have an important role in HIV-1 viral replication and infectivity. peptides bound the C-terminus of Vif with high affinity and inhibited HIV-1 replication. anti-Nef sdAb inhibited important biologic functions of Nef in vitro and in vivo in CD4C/HIV-1Nef transgenic mice. the first step in cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation is the recognition by a T cell receptor (TCR) of the antigen-derived peptide/MHC class I complex (pMHC) two Ab fragments inhibited RDDP activity of RT. both inhibited the activities of avian and murine retroviral RTs. the human DNA polymerase and prokaryotic DNA polymerases. peptides represent the smallest antibody fragments inhibiting the RT. HCDR3 repertoire is a potential source of bioactive molecules. despite considerable efforts, the structure of Rev is poorly characterized. recombinant Rev allowed the identification of 12 Rev-binding nanobodies. one of them (Nb190) prevented or disrupted Rev multimerization. Fabs were recently proposed as \u201ccrystal chaperones\u201d to support crystallization of their partners by locking them in specific conformations and blocking aggregation. de Haard et al. constructed a phage library from PBLs of an HIV-1 positive patient presenting antibodies against gp120, gp41 and p24 and screened the library against gp160 and p24 [176] one phagotope recognizing an epitope within the 2F5 and 4E10 BNtAbs epitopes on gp41 (AB#31) with affinities in the nanomolar range was isolated. target library Target presentation Biopanning procedure Phagotope Affinity Inhibition Virus isolates/clades Additional Reference CCR5 Human VH-Rabbit ST6 HCDRs CCR5 Nterm-GST fusion Four rounds, acidic elution Rabbit ST6/34 2.7 nM 8.5 nM NA NA Inhibit CCR5 export when expressed as intrabodies [184] CCR5 Randomized and extended CCL5 chemokine all active ScFv were selected on cyclic peptides [181] CCR5 12-mer RPL CHO-CCR5 cells Four rounds, acidic elution AFDWTFVPSLIL IC50 = 2.5 M NA NA Antagonist of CCR5 [179] CCR5 Partially randomized CDx3KPCALLRYx10 x10ALLRYNPFYYLSF SP CHO-CCR5 cells Four rounds, competitive elution Four rounds, the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is one of the two major HIV-1 coreceptors and binds three different endogenous chemokines CCL5 (RANTES), CCL4 (MIP-1) and CCL3 (MIP-1) which were reported to prevent R5-tropic HIV-1 entry. the first biopanning experiment targeting CCR5 was performed using receptor embedded in paramagnetic proteoliposomes. magnetic beads were added to a mixture of synthetic lipids, a detergent-solubilized C9-tagged CCR5 receptor and a capture antibody. the same year, Steinberger et al. used the phage display technology to select and to humanize rabbit anti-CCR5 antibodies preventing the export of CCR5 to the cell surface. mutated and N-terminally extended CCL5 chemokine variants were constructed and screened on CCR5-expressing cells. only intracellular phagotopes that had induced CCR5 receptor internalization were recovered. a mouse phage-displayed ScFv library was incubated with biotinylated-ECL peptides. three clones (A1, B7 and L9) selected on cyclic ECL1 or ECL2 peptides inhibited R5- tropic HIV-1. screening of RPL was also applied to the discovery of small CCR5-binding peptides through the targeting of receptor-expressing cells. chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is the second major HIV-1 coreceptor. in 2010, llamas were immunized with CXCR4-expressing HEK293T cells. two phage clones inhibiting the binding of labeled CXCL12 chemokine to the receptor were identified. IC50 values ranging from 10 to 100 nM increased antiviral properties. the two VHHs inhibited CXCR4 mainly through binding to the second extracellular loop. a peptide corresponding to this particular extracellular loop (ECL2) was used as target. IgG1 one antibody (clone B44) suppressed HIV-1 infection by a R5-tropic virus. this protein presents a unique region (ALRAMKENG) responsible for high affinity binding to the HIV-1 RNA. they identified a 7-mer peptide blocking the replication of an X4-tropic virus with an IC50 of 20 M [190] the only phage display biopanning assays reported to date targeted the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. however, to circumvent the difficulties of purifying and immobilizing such complex receptors on a solid support without losing their native structure, biopanning procedures had to be adapted. a phagotope (ST6) binding strongly and specifically to the immobilized antigen was identified, expressed as a ScFv and humanized by successive replacements of the rabbit light and heavy chains. one humanized antibody fragment, ST6/34, that retained the strong CCR5-binding capacity of the parental ST6 antibody was isolated from the screening of the intermediate libraries. three successive generations of libraries were constructed and screened as previously described. the three most interesting candidates (5P12-CCL5, 5P14-CCL5 and 6P4-CCL5) displayed highly potent antiviral activities. Vyroubalova et al. screened a partially randomized 10-mer phage library (CDx3KPCALLRYx10-PIII) using competitive elution with a CCL5 analogue (NNY-CCL5, 100 nM) and selected a unique peptide (ALLRYNPFYYLSFSP) this peptide was further optimized through N-terminal extension, exon shuffling and biopanning. llamas were immunized with CXCR4-expressing HEK293T cells. a phage library was constructed from the PBMCs of immunized camelids. several phage clones inhibiting the binding of labeled CXCL12 chemokine to the receptor were identified. CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is one of the two major HIV-1 coreceptors. binds three different endogenous chemokines CCL5 (RANTES), CCL4 (MIP-1) and CCL3 (MIP-1). inhibition of CCR5 binding to HIV-1 provides an almost complete protection against R5-tropic viruses with only minor effects on the normal physiological functions of the cells. a phage library displaying randomly mutated and N-terminally extended CCL5 chemokine variants was constructed and screened on CCR5-expressing cells. two CCL5 variants (P1 = LSPVSSQSSA-CCL5 and P2 = FSPLSSQSSA-CCL5) were identified. the three most interesting candidates (5P12-CCL5, 5P14-CCL5 and 6P4-CCL5) showed highly potent antiviral activities. 5P12-CCL5 acted as an agonist and sequestered CCR5, 5P12-CCL5 induced no signaling or receptor sequestration while 5P14-CCL5 induced CCR5 internalization without triggering G-protein signaling. this peptide was further optimized through N-terminal extension, exon shuffling and biopanning. in parallel, Wang et al. screened a fully randomized 12-mer RPL using acidic elution and identified phagotopes binding specifically to CCR5-expressing cells. a phage library was subsequently constructed from the PBMCs of immunized camelids. several phage clones inhibiting the binding of labeled CXCL12 chemokine to the receptor were identified. a peptide corresponding to this particular extracellular loop (ECL2) was used as target to identify short CXCR4 antagonists. in 2002, the DDX3 protein suppressed HIV-1 infection by a R5-tropic virus. a 7-mer peptide (SDVPTQV) blocking the replication of an X4-tropic virus with an IC50 of 20 M. a study focusing on the roles and diversity of the anti-CD34 autoimmune repertoire in the myelosuppression appearing in HIV-1 infected individuals. encing and binding analyses of these antibody fragments demonstrated the heterogeneous origin of the anti-CD34 autoimmune repertoire. this approach relies on the use of phage particles to screen for enzyme substrates instead of classical binder selection. the phage substrate approach allows thus to rapidly determine the cleavage profile of a given protease and provides optimized substrate candidates. phage library was constructed by fusing the Mab 3-E7 epitope upstream of the randomized sequences. hexapeptides fused to the MAb 3-E7 epitope and displayed on Fd phage 5 rounds with progressive decrease of the protease concentration and contact time. HIV-1 proteases 4 rounds with progressive decrease of the protease concentration Protease IC50(nM) underlined substrates correspond to sequences used to derived inhibitors. the most potent selected substrate (GSGIFLETSL) was cleaved 60 times more efficiently and had a Km value of 5 M i.e., 260 times lower than the natural substrate (Km = 1300 M) the optimal cleavage site model was designed based on the most frequently selected residues for each position. bacteriophages were exploited as carriers for the development of anti-HIV-1 vaccines. phages are not used as affinity selection tools but rather to display antigens to the immune system, aiming to elicit specific neutralizing antibodies or/and efficient cytotoxic T-cell responses. use of phage particles as HIV-1 antigen carrier. a few studies were exclusively dedicated to the use of phage particles as vehicles to prime new immune responses. fd phage particles displaying a small peptide elicited the production of specific IgGs reacting with the natural p17 antigen and with the Gag precursor protein. mice immunization with phages displaying the gp120 V3 loop fused to the pIII protein induced high titers of antibodies cross-reacting with V3 loops. mice immunized with these variable epitope libraries are capable of neutralizing half of the subtype B viral isolates used for challenge. phages present limitations for vaccination, namely low display level and the limited size of the foreign peptides that can be incorporated without interfering with the natural functions of the phage coat proteins. alternative bacteriophage models were explored. lambda phage and its decorating capsid protein were used for dense display of gp140 protein. lambda phage provided a display level of 30 copies of gp140 trimer per particle, a 20-fold higher display than observed on native HIV-1 virions. the results were proposed to be due to the sequential immunization process. the phage display technology applied to HIV-1 has provided valuable knowledge concerning the regions recognized by the immune system. it has also allowed to map the epitopes of numerous monoclonal antibodies directed against viral and host proteins. this strategy led to the identification of Fabs binding with high affinity to specific targets. immunization trials performed with mimotopes/phagotopes selected through phage display remained rather disappointing as no long-lasting neutralizing response was reported. the weak immunogenic properties of the identified mimotopes or native antigens are among the bottlenecks in the field of HIV-1 vaccine research and development. some of the most potent inhibitors originated from Fab libraries. other inhibitors were identified from semi-synthetic (ligand analogues of CCL5) and randomized peptide libraries (d-peptides: PIE123) phages are being extensively explored to increase immune responsiveness. the latest developments include exploiting the phage as DNA vaccine carrier or hybrid phage."}
