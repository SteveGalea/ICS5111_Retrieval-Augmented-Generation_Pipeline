{"summary": "the immune system is balanced by the action of activating and inhibitory receptors. lack of inhibition leads to excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. the CD200R intracellular domain is devoid of the classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif. mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is an accepted model for the most illustrious coronavirus (SARS)-CoV. mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is an accepted model for the most illustrious coronavirus (CoV) CD200-deficiency greatly decreased virus load in female mice. this was confirmed in histological liver sections stained with a monoclonal antibody against MHV. CD200-deficiency and sex determine the outcome of MHV infection. ns = not significant. * = p0.05. ** = p0.01. *** = p0.005. Similar results were obtained in 3 independent experiments. MHV critically depends on TLR7-mediated type I IFN production by hematopoietic cells. male and female WT (open bars) and Cd200/ (gray bars) mice were injected intraperitoneally with the TLR7 ligand imiquimod (50 g/mouse) twenty-four hours later livers were collected and IFN expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Mean SEM was calculated with Mann-Whitney test. ns = not significant. CD200R-mediated inhibition leads to increased production of type I IFN in response to TLR7 ligands. this leads to increased production of type I IFN in response to TLR7 ligands. this allows for efficient cross-linking using anti-LAIR-1 antibodies. the enhanced type I IFN production and viral clearance of MHV in female Cd200/ mice can be explained by the release of CD200R-mediated inhibition of the intrinsically higher TLR7 responses. a HEK 293 T cells with stable expression of TLR7 were transiently transfected with a NF-B luciferase reporter construct or an IFN luciferase reporter construct and a LAIR-1-CD200R chimera. female mice had lower viral loads compared to male mice. CD200-deficiency did not enhance type I IFN production in influenza virus infection. sex was determined by qRT-PCR. lack of CD200 results in a more severe pathology in females. the total number of cells in BAL fluid was higher in all female groups. the number of lymphocytes was increased in females of both genotypes. sex bias in TLR7 induced type I IFN production has previously been reported for humans [16], [17] in mice this has a strong impact on the course of a viral infection. sex-dependent epigenetic mechanisms may contribute [16], [17]. sex-biased type I IFN production and viral clearance are not regulated by CD200R. clearance of influenza A virus is not dependent on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. the main source of type I IFN is the respiratory epithelium. we are the first to demonstrate a strong sex bias in type I IFN production and viral clearance in mice utilizing two different models of virus infection. this is of importance for scientists studying these widely used models and may result in a completely different interpretation of data obtained. we monitored viral spread using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at day 2 and 4 after infection [14], [15]. Interestingly, at both time points we observed a decreased viral spread in female mice compared to males. however, lack of CD200 resulted in a significantly lower level of viral replication in females. this was confirmed in histological liver sections stained with a monoclonal antibody against MHV. ns = not significant. ** = p0.01. *** = p0.005. similar results were obtained in 3 independent experiments. MHV critically depends on TLR7-mediated type I IFN production. the concentrations of IFN were measured by ELISA (n = 6) male and female WT (open bars) and Cd200/ (gray bars) mice were injected intraperitoneally with the TLR7 ligand imiquimod (50 g/mouse) twenty-four hours later livers were collected and IFN expression was determined by qRT-PCR (n = 6). females expressed more IFN- mRNA than males. CD200-mediated inhibition leads to increased production of type I IFN in response to TLR7 ligands. CD200R inhibits signaling via TLR7. luciferase expression was driven by an IFN- promoter. a similar effect was observed when luciferase expression was driven by an IFN- promoter. a strong anti-viral response can also cause immune mediated pathology that can be detrimental. sex bias in viral load measured in the lungs at day 8 post infection. female mice had lower viral loads compared to male mice. CD200-deficiency did not enhance type I IFN production. lack of CD200 resulted in significantly higher neutrophil counts in females. IL-6 concentrations were increased in all females at 4 and 8 days after infection. lack of CD200 resulted in a more severe pathology in females. this study is the first to report a significantly enhanced viral clearance in female mice due to a sex bias in TLR7 induced type I IFN production. in mice this has a strong impact on the course of a viral infection, the mechanism for this is not understood. Upon influenza virus infection, CD200-deficiency strongly enhances neutrophil influx into the lungs of female mice possibly leading to pathology. but it does not affect viral clearance and type I IFN production. clearance of influenza virus is not dependent on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. anti-CD200 antibody aims to enhance anti-tumor responses towards CD200-expressing malignancies. the combination of lack of CD200R signaling and female sex has such a profound impact on the control of virus infection as well as on immune pathology. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 106 TCID50 of MHV strain A59. mice were monitored once every 24 hours for symptoms of illness. mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and subsequently injected with 100 l of the FL substrate D-luciferin dissolved in PBS. the tissues were processed in Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedical) the tissues were homogenized at 3300 g for 40 sec and immediately placed on ice. total RNA was isolated from the homogenates using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) ed and cytospins were prepared and stained with May-Grunwald/Giemsa. neutrophils were scored on the basis of morphology. blood was sampled from nave mice or four days after MHV infection. a chimeric construct containing the extra cellular region of human LAIR-1 (amino acids 1\u2013160) fused with the transmembrane and intracellular rat CD200R (amino acids 236\u2013327) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo (Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands) all sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 106 TCID50 of MHV strain A59 expressing the firefly luciferase reporter gene (MHV-EFLM) in 200 l PBS. mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and injected with 100 l of the FL substrate D-luciferin. five mice were imaged simultaneously exactly 5 min after the injection of D-luciferin. a low-intensity visible light image was generated and used to create overlay (heatmap) images for each animal. primers mapping to the influenza A nucleoprotein (N) gene were used. samples were controlled for the presence of possible inhibitors of the amplification reaction by internal control (murine encephalomyocarditis virus DNA) seven m liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. total liver sections were examined by light microscopy. reporter assays HEK 293 T cells were transiently co-transfected. luciferase activity was measured on a luminometer (Berthold technologies Centro LB 960) cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), luciferase activity was measured on a luminometer (Berthold technologies Centro LB 960), and data were analyzed with Microwin software. total protein content was determined with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific) the relative nuclear surface area (nuclear surface area/lung surface area * 100) of the lung sections was used as a measure of the tissue response to exposure to the influenza virus (B) Total cell count in BAL fluid. quantification of monocyte (C) and lymphocyte (D) numbers in BAL fluid by differential cell count."}
