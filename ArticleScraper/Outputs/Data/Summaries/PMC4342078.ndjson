{"summary": "fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be used for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia. failure of passive transfer in calves is a common condition that predisposes calves to increased morbidity and mortality. plasma obtained from blood was collected using a needle and syringe. they were transferred into lithium-heparin tubes containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine-1 (CPDA-1) anticoagulant and stored in plastic bags at 20\u00b0C. there is a lack of information about protein stability of frozen bovine plasma. closed-collection system consisted of a primary bag containing 63 mL of citrate phosphate-double dextrose solution as anticoagulant. additive bag contained 100 mL of additive solution (SAG-Mannitol) and 1 empty satellite bag. manual plasma extractor was then used to generate 1 bag of 300 mL of plasma. plasma albumin concentration was measured using a semiautomatic agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) system. plasma was electrophoresed for 7 minutes at 33-volt hours and stained with diluted Amidoschwarz dye at pH 2 (4 g/L Amidoschwarz dye and 6.7% ethylene glycol) blood was collected from 20 healthy lactating adult donors. a total volume of 4 L of blood was collected from each cow. a closed-collection system was used, consisting of sterile human 450 mL blood bags. small hand sealer clips were used to create 4 segments of tubing. one segment was used immediately as fresh plasma to obtain baseline concentrations of plasma total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) concentrations and plasma protein electrophoresis. protein fractions were analyzed using a semiautomatic agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) system. plasma was electrophoresed for 7 minutes at 33-volt hours. plasma was stained with diluted Amidoschwarz dye at pH 2. concentrations of total protein and ALB and alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma globulin fractions are reported in Table 1. concentrations of albumin (ALB) and alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma globulin fractions are evaluated at different time of storage. plasma concentrations (g/dL) of TP and ALB change after 1 month of storage at 20\u00b0C. concentrations of beta-2 protein fractions were stable for 6 months at 20\u00b0C. on electropherograms there were 6 protein fractions: albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and gamma globulins. the mean values of alpha globulin and gamma globulins are lower and higher than those reported by Kaneko. CPDA-1 was used as the anticoagulant, while serum or plasma was obtained using lithium-heparin anticoagulant. results suggest that the type of anticoagulant does not affect the resolution of the electrophoretic method. most analytes show no or very mild change in canine plasma [16] in bovine plasma stored at 20\u00b0C changes in protein fractions occur in TP, ALB, and beta-2 globulin expressed as g/dL after 1 month and 6 and 12 months. this study suggests that total gamma globulin concentration in bovine frozen plasma is stable for 12 months at 20\u00b0C. bovine fresh frozen plasma appears to be suitable for treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer) in calves when stored for 12 months at 20\u00b0C."}
