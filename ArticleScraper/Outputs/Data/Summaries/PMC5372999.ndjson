{"summary": "mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the most dangerous pathogens causing the highest human mortality and morbidity among various infectious diseases worldwide. the prevalence of TB cases co-infected with HIV was highest in the africa region compared with other regions. artemisinin is an anti-malaria first-line drug derived from the plant Artemisia annua. artemisinin is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, a part of the artemisinin group. they are being effectively used as anti-malaria drugs. 2% Ogawa slant medium was purchased from Union Lab Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Merck Chemical Co., Ltd. (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA) Mtb H37RV was grown in fresh broth supplemented with 10% (v/v) oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase (OADC) enrichment (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for five weeks with a shaking incubation of 100 rpm until the mid-log phase. 20 L of freshly prepared 0.05% (v/v) resazurin solution was added to all wells of a 96 well microtiter plate. plates were re-incubated at 37 \u00b0C for two days. MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) was expressed as lowest concentration of the drug. ate and artemisinin against M. tuberculosis were evaluated by 2% Ogawa slant medium assay. the bacterial suspensions were inoculated into all wells of a 96 well microtiter plate containing artesunate, artemisinin, anti-Mtb first-line drugs. the rats were orally administered with a single dose of 5 mg/kg of isoniazid, and 3.5 mg/kg of artemisinin and artemisinin. the rats were euthanized by CO2 gas in CO2 chamber at each time point. the organs were homogenized in 1X PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80. rats were divided into normal (n = 4) and experimental groups (artesunate and artemisinin groups, n = 4/each group). the two different doses (1.75 and 3.5 mg/kg) of artesunate and artemisinin was administered orally in rats of the experimental groups. the body weight of all animals was recorded at each time point, once a day for 28 days. reagents were purchased from Merck Chemical Co., Ltd. (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA) all animals were kept at 23 0.5 \u00b0C and in a 12 h light/dark cycle in a controlled environment of the central animal care facility. oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase (OADC) enrichment was confirmed by a resazurin microtiter assay using a 96-well micro-plate. the bacteria were inoculated into all wells of a 96 well microtiter plate containing final concentrations (9.375\u2013300 g/mL) of artesunate, artemisinin, and anti-Mtb first-line drugs 20 L of freshly prepared 0.05% (v/v) resazurin solution was added to all wells of a 96 well microtiter plate. the plates were re-incubated at 37 \u00b0C for two days. the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) was expressed as the lowest concentration of the drug that inhibited Mtb-growth or prevented change in color of the resazurin from blue to pink based on a REMA 106 CFU/mL in fresh Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10% (v/v) oleic acid/ albumin/dextrose/catalase (OADC) enrichment. the bacterial suspensions were inoculated into all wells of a 96 well microtiter plate containing artesunate, artemisinin, anti-Mtb first-line drugs, and growth controls without inoculation. animals were euthanized by CO2 gas in CO2 chamber at each time point. the organs were homogenized in 1X PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80. total viable count at each time point was measured by serial dilution plating on Meddlebrook 7H11 agar. the body weight of all animals was recorded at each time point, once a day for 28 days. the animals were euthanized using CO2 gas in CO2 chamber at final time point. MIC values of both artesunate and artemisinin against the growth of Mtb were measured as 75 g/mL, respectively. artesunate did not indicate higher anti-Mtb activity/effects than artemisinin in the REMA. the blue color and dotted lines show the anti-Mtb activity/effect, and the pink color indicates bacterial growth. all results were expressed as mean standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments. inin and anti-Mtb first-line drugs (5 and 20 g/mL) were incubated with 150 g/mL of artesunate. growth units were markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. artesunate has a strong anti-Mtb effect that causes the inactivation of Mtb. artesunate incubated with different concentrations (150\u2013600 g/mL) of artesunate. growth colonies were not observed or proliferated on the 2% slant medium. differences in drug susceptibility of Mtb were clearly confirmed. the in vivo tests of artesunate and artemisinin were carried out three times independently. the rats were divided into a normal group (n = 5), positive control group (n = 5/), positive control group (n = 5/). the rats were orally administered with a single dose of 5 mg/kg of isoniazid and 3.5 mg/kg of artesunate and artemisinin, once a day for four weeks, after four weeks of Mtb infection. the rats were carefully observed during the experimental periods. rats were orally administered with two different doses (1.75 and 3.5 mg/kg) of artemisinin and artemisinin, once a day for four weeks, and additionally observed for seven days. rats were carefully observed during the experimental period of five weeks. artesunate and artemisinin demonstrated their Mtb-inhibitory effects causing anti-Mtb activity. artesunate did not indicate higher anti-Mtb activity than artemisinin in the REMA. the in vitro anti-Mtb activity/effect of artesunate and artemisinin against Mtb H37Rv measured using the REMA. the results were expressed as mean standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments. artesunate and artemisinin were incubated with various concentrations of artesunate or artemisinin. growth units were markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. artesunate has a strong anti-Mtb effect that causes the inactivation of Mtb compared with artemisinin. esunate and artemisinin measured using the MGIT 960 system assay. Mtb was incubated with different concentrations (37.5\u2013600 g/mL) of compounds in the MGIT 960 system device. the anti-Mtb effect of artesunate against the growth/proliferation of Mtb was confirmed using the Ogawa slant assay. the growth/proliferation colonies of Mtb were significantly inhibited or decreased in the artesunate-treated groups compared with artemisinin-treated groups. the rats were divided into a normal group (n = 5), positive control group (n = 5/isoniazid group) and experimental groups (artesunate and artemisinin groups, n = 5/each group) the rats were orally administered with a single dose of 5 mg/kg of isoniazid. the rats were carefully observed during the experimental periods. the rats were orally administered with two different doses (1.75 and 3.5 mg/kg) of artemisinin and artemisinin, once a day for four weeks, and additionally observed for seven days. the rats were carefully observed during the experimental period of five weeks. tuberculosis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS, Zika, and Ebola have caused serious concerns in public health fields worldwide. the increase of HIV co-infection and the rapid appearance of MDR or XDR strains represent an urgent need to develop novel, effective, and safe anti-Mtb drugs for treating TB. research focused on two key points for the discovery of new candidate substances. first, the minimization of side effects and safety of drugs. second, finding novel pharmacological activity/effects of drugs causing anti-Mtb activity/effects through existing drugs which are used in other diseases. esunate with ampicillin or oxacillin against sepsis animal models induced by Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. artemisinin is caused by inducing or promoting apoptosis, and by inhibiting the growth of various cancer cells such as breast, colon, leukemia, and prostate cancer cells. artesunate showed its anti-Mtb activity and persistent effects by strongly inhibit the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria consists of only a single-unit-thick peptidoglycan layer and a plasma membrane. artemisinin is a multi-complex of heteropolymers such as peptidoglycans, arabinogalactans, mycolic acids, and capsular lipids. the differences in the specificity and superiority of artesunate and artemisinin regarding anti-Mtb activity/effects were confirmed by esunate and artemisinin did not induce side effects and toxicity in in vivo tests. the compound-treated groups consistently induced the inhibition and decrease of Mtb. artesunate and artemisinin effectively inhibited the growth/proliferation of Mtb. artesunate has a higher potential for being repurposed through novel anti-Mtb activity/effects than artemisinin. this study provides novel insights and the potential that artesunate can be used as a promising candidate agent of novel anti-TB drugs for the effective/safe next generation for tuberculosis."}
