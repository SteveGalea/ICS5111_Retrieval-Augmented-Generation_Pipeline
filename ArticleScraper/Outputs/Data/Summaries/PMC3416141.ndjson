{"summary": "human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 infections carry an alarming mortality rate of 50 to 60%. despite its high death rate in humans, HPAI H5N1 virus infections are generally confined to wild birds and poultry. experimental H5N1 virus challenge studies in pigs found no or only transient and mild clinical symptoms, such as pyrexia, and subsequent seroconversion (6, 12, 19). a retrospective analysis of farm pigs found evidence of previous exposure to HPAI H5N1 virus infection without noticeable clinical signs (8, 27) pig respiratory epithelial cells isolated from stripped tracheobronchial mucosae from eight 3- to 4-month-old pigs. washed mucosae were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with 0.06 U/ml pronase (Sigma) in a 1:1 dilution of DMEM-Glutamax. nonadherent cells were removed with multiple PBS washes. all the viruses were grown in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs by allantoic inoculation. the human USSR H1N1 virus was moderately pathogenic in humans. all HPAI H5N1 virus infection work was carried out in the biological containment level 3 (CL3) facility. superScript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit was performed with a lightCycler-480 instrument (Roche) using a relative standard curve approach, normalized to 18S rRNA. Sequence details of human genes are as follows:. all pig work was carried out at the AHVLA using biological containment level 3 facilities (ACDP3/SAPO4) all pig work was carried out at the AHVLA using biological containment level 3 facilities (ACDP3/SAPO4) 4-week-old pigs were inoculated with influenza virus at 106 median egg infectious doses (EID50) by the upper respiratory tract route, delivered intranasally (2.5 ml) and intratracheally (2.5 ml), and monitored daily for clinical signs (including pyrexia) and nasal virus shedding by real-time PCR (20). pigs were culled sequentially, and all major tissues were collected for virus detection on days 4, 12, and 30 postinfection transfected macrophages were allowed to recover for at least 48 h before virus infection. quantification of viable virus was conducted as previously described (16) at 48 h posttransfection, cells were infected with USSR H1N1 virus for 24 h. a significantly lower influenza virus M gene RNA level was detected in culture supernatants from SOC3-overexpressed macrophages. corresponding induction of the TNF- protein by USSR H1N1 virus was significantly reduced in SOCS3-overexpressed macrophages. supernatants of infected human and pig cells collected at 24 h and 48 h postinfection were used to infect MDCK cells for 6 h, followed by immunodetection for virus nucleoprotein. the number of infected MDCK cells per microliter of supernatant was determined. cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin\u2013100 g/ml streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. clade 2.2.1 HPAI H5N1 (A/turkey/Turkey/1/05) (21) and human H1N1 (A/USSR/77 [USSR]) (38) influenza viruses were used in this study. all the viruses were grown in 10-day-old embryonated eggs by allantoic inoculation. l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml (16, 34) was used throughout infections with HPAI H5N1 and USSR H1N1 viruses. PCR quantification of virus and host genes. pig genes are as follows: CCCGACTATCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT pigs were inoculated with HPAI H5N1 virus at 106 median egg infectious doses (EID50) by the upper respiratory tract route, delivered intranasally (2.5 ml) and intratracheally (2.5 ml) all major tissues were collected for virus detection on days 4, 12, and 30 postinfection. the proportion of hypodiploid (nuclear fragmented) cells was quantified with a BD FACS canto II flow cytometer. Western blotting to detect endogenous SOCS3 was performed by using a polyclonal rabbit SOCS3 antibody (2923; Cell Signaling Technology) cells positive for viral nucleoprotein were counted with an inverted microscope. the mean numbers of positive cells in four 96-well plates were used to calculate infectious focus-forming units of virus per microliter of infection volume. SOCS3 overexpression in human macrophages reduced USSR H1N1-induced TNF- production. a new tab Pig respiratory epithelial cells released less infectious virus than human cells infected with HPAI H5N1 (A/turkey/Turkey/1/05) and USSR H1N1 (A/USSR/77) viruses. real-time PCR on 24-h-infected culture supernatants showed that the H5N1 M gene RNA level was about 10-fold lower than in from human cells. both receptor types were detected in human and pig macrophages. both receptor types were also detected in human and pig macrophages. pig epithelial cells and macrophages appeared to be equally permissive to virus entry and initial replication with HPAI H5N1 virus. human (A and C) and pig (B and D) respiratory epithelial cells were positively immunolabeled (C and D) for cytokeratin (epithelial cell marker), with panels A and B as the negative controls. the host 2,6-galactose (SA2,6-Gal)-linked sialic acid receptor (associated with human influenza virus binding), shown in green, and the 2,3-galactose (SA2,3-Gal)-linked human and pig respiratory epithelial cells (O, Q, and S) showed less severe cytopathogenicity (cell shrinkage, rounding, and detachment) than pig respiratory epithelial cells (P, R, and T) infected by HPAI H5N1 (Q and R) or USSR H1N1 (S and T) virus. pigs challenged with the same HPAI H5N1 virus showed no apparent induction of the TNF- or interferon 1 gene in their lungs. expression levels of three related chemokines were detected in human epithelial cells and macrophages. TNF- RNA expression levels in human epithelial cells (A) and human macrophages were at least 100-fold higher than those in the corresponding pig cells for both viruses and at both time points. for human or pig, the virus-induced TNF- mRNA expression level in macrophages was many times (1 to 2 orders) higher than that in epithelial cells. IFN1 after challenge induction coincided with only transient signs of pyrexia in the first 48 h and intermittent nasal virus shedding within the first 4 days of virus challenge. no virus M gene RNA was detected in the lung at all time points. chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), cytokines (IL1, IL6, and IFN1), and IFN1-inducible genes (OAS1 and Mx1) in human in human epithelial cells, at 24 h after infection with HPAI H5N1 virus, IL6 expression levels showed a wide variation between experimental repeats. pig epithelial cells, the HPAI H5N1 subtype induced a stronger and increasing IFN1 response, but in human cells, IFN1 induction was less pronounced. differences in IL6 responses to HPAI H5N1 virus infection between human and pig cells were less straightforward. in human epithelial cells infected with HPAI H5N1 virus, level of IL6 induction was consistently high. induction was much stronger in pig macrophages. the SOCS family of eight genes (28, 44) has been widely recognized to negatively regulate a range of cytokines and growth factors. most SOCS members examined were downregulated in human epithelial cells infected with the HPAI H5N1 subtype (P. X. Chang, personal communication) CS3 protein in human epithelial cells and macrophages was barely or not detected before and after infection. in human epithelial cells, SOCS3 expression was downregulated by HPAI H5N1 virus infection. in pig epithelial cells, SOCS3 expression was induced by both viruses. the native SOCS3 protein (28 kDa) was weakly expressed (3 h) or absent. the protein was highly expressed in pig macrophages regardless of infection. pig respiratory epithelial cells infected with HPAI H5N1 virus underwent greater nuclear fragmentation at 48 h postinfection. pig epithelial cells also showed a greater reduction in cell viability when infected at an MOI of 10 with HPAI H5N1 and USSR H1N1 virus. human and pig respiratory epithelial cells labeled with propidium iodide were sorted by flow cytometry to determine the proportion of hypodiploid cells as an indication of cells undergoing nuclear fragmentation. a more severe nuclear fragmentation of pig cells was observed at 48 h infection. both mammalian hosts appeared to be equally permissive to virus entry and initial replication with HPAI H5N1 virus. pig epithelial cells and macrophages continued to accumulate viral M gene RNA at 24 h and 48 h of infection. however, in pig epithelial cells, there was no increase in M gene expression beyond the first 24 h. receptor (associated with avian influenza virus binding) were widely distributed and coexpressed in human (E) and pig (F) respiratory epithelial cells (G and I) and macrophages (I and J) showed extensive viral nucleoprotein staining after HPAI H5N1 virus (A/turkey/Turkey/1/05) infection (6 h) at an MOI of 1.0. a similar uniform nucleoprotein detection was found following infection with USSR H1 the expression levels of several key proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines linked to the development of hypercytokinemia were determined in human and pig respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages. for each mammalian host, the virus-induced TNF- expression level in macrophages was at least 100-fold higher than that in the corresponding pig cells for both viruses. 4-week-old pigs challenged with same HPAI H5N1 virus showed no apparent induction of the TNF- or interferon 1 gene in their lungs. expression levels of three related chemokines, CXCL9, CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11, were detected in human epithelial cells and macrophages. pig macrophages infected for 48 h with HPAI H5N1 and USSR H1N1 viruses showed strong TNF- induction in human cells. TNF- was undetectable or barely detectable in pigs infected by all 3 virus subtypes. human and pig cells were infected with HPAI H5N1 and USSR H1N1 viruses at an MOI of 1.0. chemokine induction was absent or barely detected in pig epithelial cells. IL1 expression in human macrophages appeared less responsive to HPAI H5N1 and USSR H1N1 infections. in human and pig cells infected with USSR H1N1 virus, levels of OAS1 (H) and Mx1 (I) expression closely mirrored the relative expression level of IFN-1. a clear induction of OAS1 (H) and Mx1 by the HPAI H5N1 subtype was found only in human cells at both time points. HPAI H5N1 and USSR H1N1 viruses induced an increasing transcriptional response of IFN1 in pig but not in human epithelial cells. in response to USSR H1N1 virus infection, expression profiles of two IFN-inducible genes closely followed the relative expression levels of IFN1 in both host species. SOCS3 expression showed a marked contrast between infected human and pig cells. in human epithelial cells, SOCS3 expression was upregulated (>1.5-fold change) by USSR H1N1 virus but downregulated (0.7-fold change) by the HPAI H5N1 subtype. in pig epithelial cells, both viruses upregulated SOCS3 expression. pig macrophages showed higher fold increases of SOCS3 expression levels with both viruses than human macrophages. the fold change in the SOCS3 expression level was in relation to levels in uninfected controls. pig macrophages transfected with a SOCS3 expression plasmid were challenged with the USSR H1N1 subtype. the overexpression of SOCS3 in human macrophages did not appear to affect virus entry and early infection. the level of virus M gene RNA detected in the supernatants of infected cells was clearly blunt by the overexpression of SOCS3. the virus M gene RNA level found in the supernatants of H5N1 virus-infected human cells was about 10-fold higher than that in the corresponding pig epithelial cells. pig epithelial cells infected by HPAI H5N1 or USSR H1N1 virus released significantly less new infectious virus into culture supernatants. study links apparent HPAI H5N1 virus resistance in pigs to innate resistance of key cell types of respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages. this is manifested as attenuated proinflammation and a reduced de novo infectious-virus output. IL1 or IL6 on its own may not be decisive in the induction of hypercytokinemia in human H5N1 virus infections. the vigorous induction of type I IFNs and IFN-inducible genes in the lungs of HPAI H5N1 virus-infected human patients (41), ferrets (3), and macaques (1) has been well described. helial cells and macrophages infected by HPAI H5N1 virus showed a consistent upregulation of SOCS3. the high constitutive SOCS3 protein expression level detected in pig cells was not found in human cells. the presumptive phosphorylated SOCS3 protein (38 kDa) was the dominant constitutive form. the high constitutive SOCS3 protein expression level in pig epithelial cells was associated with a weak expression of IFN-inducible genes. at present, it is not clear what are the key targets of SOCS in proinflammatory modulation during HPAI H5N1 virus infection. the establishment of pig primary cells as a mammalian model of host innate resistance against HPAI H5N1 virus infection should greatly accelerate our understanding. mechanisms at the molecular level moderate proinflammation and inhibit virus production. both of these mechanisms are of vital clinical importance."}
