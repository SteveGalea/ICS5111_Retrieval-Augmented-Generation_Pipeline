{"summary": "acute exacerbation of COPD leads to rapid deterioration of pulmonary function and quality of life. it is unclear whether the prognosis for AECOPD differs depending on the bacterium or virus identified. ECOPD impacts quality of life, accelerates the decline in pulmonary function, and increases mortality.3\u20135 Appropriate treatment is needed to prevent frequent acute exacerbation and hospitalization. sening of a patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variation was defined as AECOPD requiring hospitalization. events included if the following criteria were met. propensity scores were calculated for each patient using multivariable logistic regression based on the covariates. matching was performed using the nearest neighbor method to select for the most similar propensity scores. 1.000 0.0000 Cerebrovascular accidentb 2 (3.1%) 31 (4.9%) 0.760 0.2612 2 (3.8%) 3 (5.8%) 1.000 0.2347 Severity of COPD GOLD Ib 5 (7.7%) 50 (7.8%) 0.434 0.1020 4 (7.8%) 3 (5.8%) 0.798 0.1159 GOLD IIb 25 (38.5%) 246 (38.5%) 18 (34.6%) 22 (42.3%) GOLD IIIb 22 (33.8%) 266 (41.6 0.277 0.3522 0 (0.0%) 2 (3.8%) 0.730 0.0348 LAMAs 13 (20.0%) 75 (11.7%) 10 (19.2%) 6 (11.5%) LABAs + LAMAs 16 (24.6%) 97 (15.2%) 12 (23.1%) 15 (28.8%) ICS/LABAs 3 (4.6%) 51 (8.0%) 3 (5.8%) 3 (5.8%) 3 (5.8%) Triple therapy (ICS/LABAs + LAMAs) 24 ( logistic regression analysis was assessed using the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test. we analyzed factors that showed meaningful values after propensity score matching. a P0.05 was considered statistically significant. a real-time PCR can detect influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. the three most frequently identified bacteria and viruses were analyzed in the study. readmission group (n=639) P-value d Age (years)a 73.99.6 71.89.3 0.078 0.2251 72.99.2 73.17.6 0.908 0.0237 Gender Maleb 48 (73.8%) 444 (69.5%) 0.465 0.1186 40 (76.9%) 38 (73.1%) 0.651 0.1133 Femaleb 17 (26.2%) 195 (30.5%) 12 (23.1%) 14 (26.9%) Smoking history Current 0%) 77 (12.1%) 10 (19.2%) 7 (13.5%) Length of hospital stay (days)a 14.010.4 9.68.1 0.001 0.5278 12.28.0 10.58.2 0.307 0.2099 ICU admission 10 (15.4%) 63 (9.9%) 0.164 0.2802 7 (13.5%) 8 (15.4%) 0.780 0.0860 Use of mechanical ventilation 8 (13.8%) 38 (5.9%) 0.031 0.4396 6 (11.5%) 8 (15 logistic regression analysis was assessed using the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test. we analyzed factors that showed meaningful values after propensity score matching. the mean age was >70 years in all groups. the proportion of males was higher than that of females in all groups. most patients were at GOLD stage II or III. the P. aeruginosa identification rate remained significantly greater in the readmission group (P=0.030) after matching, the P. aeruginosa identification rate was significantly greater in the readmission group. multivariate analysis We performed multivariate analysis of P. aeruginosa identification rates. first, we adjusted the propensity score and variables associated with prognosis. the P. aeruginosa identification rate was higher in readmission groups compared to the no-readmission group. pulmonary medication or treatment We analyzed pulmonary medication use or treatment before admission. most patients (80%) were using inhalers. triple therapy was the most commonly used type of inhaler in all groups. identified pathogen in readmission events before and after propensity score matching After matching Readmission group (n=65) No-readmission group (n=639) P-value Readmission group (n=52) No-readmission group (n=52) P-value Identification of bacteria or virus Only bacterial pathogen identification 27 (41.5%) 158 (24.7%) 0.003 20 (38.5%) 14 (26.9%) 0.210 Only viral pathogen identification 9 (13.8%) 149 (23.3%) 0.081 the P. aeruginosa identification rate was higher in the readmission groups compared to the no-readmission group (OR, 3.600; 95% CI, 1.077\u201312.035; P=0.038) a previous study showed that 10.2% of severe AECOPD patients were readmitted within 30 days after discharge and 17.8% were readmitted within 90 days. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative rod bacterium that can cause opportunistic infections. it is the causative agent of infections mainly in immunocompromised patients. it is currently the most common causative agent of nosocomial infection. in our study, P. aeruginosa is the most commonly identified pathogen. however, the most commonly identified bacteria in AECOPD are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. sputum culture assay was not conducted before and after admission. some patients lacked chest computed tomography data, thus limiting analysis of associations with bronchiectasis."}
