{"summary": "nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 600 patients of all ages older than 1 month hospitalized with pneumonia. the most prevalent virus detected was RSV-A (14.2%) followed by AdV (10.4%) and IAV (10.4%), then RSV-B (6.2%), EV (4.2%), IBV (2.2%), PIV-3 (1.7%), CoV (1.0%), PIV-1 (1.0%), PIV-4 (0.7%), and PIV-2 ( as of 2016, approximately 37.8% of the population in Sibu was Iban. 60.7% of the population in Kapit was Iban. all patients older than 30 days admitted to Sibu or Kapit Hospitals were considered for study eligibility. questionnaire captured demographic information, household size and contact with animals within the last 30 days. all pre-existing health conditions and current medications were self-reported by the subject or their parent/guardian during the questionnaire. the MO then used a flocked swab to collect 1 nasopharyngeal swab from the subject\u2019s nose. a positive control and a no-template control were included in each run. all specimens were first run at SHCRC. laboratory staff at Duke-NUS and Duke were blind to the results. participants Study enrollment took place between June 2017 and may 2018 at Sibu and Kapit Hospitals. approximately 37.8% of the population in Sibu was Iban and 60.7% of the population in Kapit was Iban. if we enrolled 600 pneumonia patients, we could be confident to calculate an estimated prevalence within 3.8% of the true prevalence of IAV. MOs enrolled patients on 2 of 3 randomly selected days of the week. the questionnaire captured demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity) and contact with animals within the last 30 days. all NP swabs were examined for molecular evidence of influenza A (IAV), IBV, ICV, and IDV, human adenovirus (AdV), human enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (CoV), RSV subtype A (RSV-A) and RSV-B, and PIV types 1\u20134 (PIV-1, -2, -3, and -4) a total of 600 hospitalized pneumonia patients were enrolled at Sibu and Kapit Hospitals between June 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018, with 389 of the subjects enrolled at Sibu Hospital (64.8%) and 211 enrolled at Kapit Hospital (35.2%). a total of 385 (64.2%) enrolled subjects were children 5 years of age or younger and 439 (73.2%) were of age 18 years and younger. 93 (23.9) 87 (41.2) 1\u20132 years (1.4) 105 (17.5) 60 (15.4) 45 (21.3) 2\u201318 years (6.4) 154 (25.7) 94 (24.2) 60 (28.4) >18 years (63.9) 161 (26.8) 142 (36.5) 19 (9.0) Household Size (Quartiles) 0\u20133 (2.0) 161 (26.8) 113 (29.0) 48 (22.8) 4\u20135 ( cAnimal contact defined as touched or come within 1 meter in the last 30 days. 1 NP swab collected from a pediatric patient at Sibu Hospital was accidentally destroyed before molecular screening. more viruses were detected by rRT-PCR/rPCR in 48.1% of the 599 samples. the prevalence of each pathogen out of the total number of patients enrolled by month is shown in Figure 1. n (%Total Positive) Respiratory syncytial virus A 85 (14.2) 71 (83.5) 14 (16.5) Adenovirus 62 (10.4) 35 (56.5) 27 (43.5) Influenza A virus 62 (10.4) 53 (85.5) 9 (14.5) Influenza A virus 62 (10.4) eighty-two of the RSV-A-positive samples were from children 5 years age 5. a total of 37 (6.2% prevalence) specimens were positive for RSV-B by rRT-PCR, with 2 additional suspect-positive specimens. after RSV, AdV and IAV were the most prevalent, each with 62 positive specimens detected by rPCR and rRT-PCR. a lower prevalence (2.2%) of IBV was detected, with 13 IBV-positive specimens. 6 specimens tested positive for PIV-3, followed by 6 PIV-1 detections, 4 PIV-4 detections, and 1 PIV-2 detection. no specimens were determined to be positive for ICV or IDV. one patient of the 600 enrolled was pregnant and tested positive for IAV. uly 2017 with an adjusted OR of 7.2 (95% CI, 1.6\u201333.5) compared with RSV-A detection by rRT-PCR in November\u2013December 2017. we detected AdV in over 30% of the 72 specimens collected from April 15 to May 14, 2018. uly 14 97 28 (28.9) 8.1 (1.83\u201335.9) 7.2 (1.6\u201333.5) July 15\u2013August 14 51 9 (17.6) 4.3 (0.9\u201321.1) 4.9 (0.9\u201325.6) August 15\u2013September 14 41 5 (12.2) 2.8 (0.5\u201315.2) 3.6 (0.6\u201321.2) September 15\u2013October 14 53 8 (15.1) 3.6 (0.7\u201317.7) 3.2 (0.6\u201316.9) October 15\u2013November 14 46b >1\u20132 years 105 11 (10.5) 9.3 (2.0\u201342.9) 10.4 (2.1\u201351.2) >2\u201318 years 154 4 (2.6) 2.1 (0.4\u201311.7) 2.3 (0.4\u201310.9) >18 years 161 2 (1.2) Ref.
