{"summary": "CAD is the leading cause of death in the united states. it occurs when the arteries that supply blood to cardiac muscle become hardened and narrowed. factors that account for the risk of atherosclerosis include dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and smoking. plasma apoD levels range from 3 to 11 mol/L. this level is equivalent to plasma levels of apolipoprotein C-III. this level is equivalent to plasma levels of apolipoprotein C-III. nipple fluid apoD levels do not seem to correlate with the stage of the breast cancer disease. it is suggested that upregulated apoD production serves the function of transporting cholesterol and phospholipids, a remodeling process that is required for the recovery of brain injury. apoD protein levels are found in patients with failing hearts, compared with non-failing control subjects. apoD and leptin receptor expression are coordinately regulated in the hypothalamus in modulating food intake and energy homeostasis in mice. posttranslational modification of apoD ApoD possesses two N-glycosylation sites (Asn45 and Asn78). this raises the hypothesis that apoD is regulated at the post-translational level. apoD is an atypical apolipoprotein of 169 amino acids. apoD does not share significant degrees of homology in the amino acid sequence with other apolipoproteins. lipocalin superfamily of proteins share highly conserved -barrel structure. such a tertiary architecture is predicted to form a ligand-binding pocket. this characteristic lipocalin fold is validated for apoD by Eichinger et al. [41] who recently crystalized the human apoD protein in its free form and in complex with progesterone. plasma apoD levels are significantly reduced in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder. apoD is highly enriched in HDL isolated from seven subjects with CAD compared to six healthy controls. apoE knockout mice display a marked increase in plasma apoD levels. plasma apoD levels are markedly increased in apoE knockout mice. apoD production is upregulated in atherogenic mice. apoD is associated with the development of obesity, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in the British Caucasoid population. no significant association is detected between the apoD polymorphism and body mass index (BMI) or waist to hip ratio in the same cohort of subjects. hypothalamic apoD mRNA is markedly induced in response to high fat feeding. however, this effect is abolished with a concomitant reduction of apoD mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of obese db/db mice. apoD may participate in the regulation of food intake and body fat accumulation via crosstalking with the leptin receptor. apoD contributes to HDL remodeling via its covalent cross-link with apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), a structural component of HDL. apoD-apoA-II heterodimer has an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa. apoD-apoA-II heterodimer has an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa. fibroblasts that apoD expression is significantly induced in response to cellular stress, regardless of whether the stress condition is caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, H2O2 treatment or UV-light irradiation. apoD confers a neuroprotective effect in the brain of mice. this effect correlates with the ability of apoD to prevent oxidative stress. apoD is abundantly expressed in the brain, but the pathophysiology is unknown. apoD is localized in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE knockout mice. this is correlated with the ability of apoD to bind and transport cholesterol. apoE knockout mice were subjected to oil red O staining (A) and immunohistochemistry using control rabbit IgG against bacterial -galactosidase (B) and rabbit anti-apoD antibody (C) the secondary antibody used in immunostaining is the donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3. apoD is apolipoprotein due to its initial isolation from human HDL. plasma apoD is also present at a relatively low content in VLDL and LDL, suggesting that apoD plays significant roles in both triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism. apoD production is seen in aging brains and altered brain apoD expression is associated with neurological disorders. it is of paramount importance to define apoD function in the brain and understand the molecular basis by which apoD affects aging and contributes neurological diseases. the aorta was mounted in Cryomatrix (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and frozen in isopentane. transverse cryo-sections (10 m) were cut and stained by oil red O."}
