{"summary": "fecal diagnostics including parvovirus testing, fecal flotation, routine aerobic and anaerobic fecal culture including special agar media for each of salmonella (Brilliant Green and XLT4, Oxoid, Nepean, Ontario) and Campylobacter spp. are summarized in Table 1. spp. 4+ Campylobacter spp. \u2014 few a PCR showed that all E. coli were positive for the eae gene and negative for estA, stx1 and stx 2 genes. there was no gender or breed predilection identified. 2 y FS miniature dachsund 3 as puppy, 1 y booster 2 d, increased frequency, mild hematochezia NR 39.3\u00b0C Abdominal pain 5c 4 y F English springer spaniel 3 as puppy, 1 y booster 2 d, hematemesis NR NR 6 3 y FS German shepherd cross 3 as puppy, 1 y booster 1 d, hematemesis NR NR 6 3 y FS a synthetic colloid (Pentospan; Bristol Myers, Montreal, Quebec) was administered at 20 mL/kg body weight (BW) per day as a constant rate infusion (CRI) to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. despite antiemetic therapy, euthanasia was elected on day 5 of therapy. acute, extensive erosive to ulcerative esophagitis was present and attributed to protracted vomiting. the bone marrow was hypocellular (estimate 30%) with adequate megakaryocytes present. the second dog was a Labrador retriever cross less than 1 y of age. microbial therapy consisted of ampicillin, 22 mg/kg BW, IV, q6h, for 24 h. two days after initiating supportive therapy, a recheck of the CBC found a severe leukopenia characterized by neutropenia and lymphopenia. a mild, normocytic, normochromic nonregenerative anemia was also noted. dog 5 had hemorrhagic staining around the perineum. both were treated with IV fluid therapy, ampicillin, 22 mg/kg BW, IV, q6h, and bland diets for 12 to 24 h. they were then discharged from the hospital with no further clinical signs reported by owners. fluorescent antibody testing for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium canis was available for 1 dog and both were negative. the number of colonies tested varied and neither the number tested nor results for each colony were reported. dogs 4 to 7 were all older than 2 y and all had been appropriately vaccinated. no dogs were tested for canine coronavirus, which has been associated with mild (19) and severe (20,21) diarrhea in young dogs. coronavirus infection cannot be excluded as an inciting factor in these dogs. this is the first report of EPEC being associated with hemorrhagic diarrhea in naturally infected dogs. Escherichia coli was identified on fecal culture in all cases. but the amount of growth varied substantially among dogs. more severe disease in animals less than 1 y of age, consistent with previous findings (4,8\u201311) we recommend including EPEC as a differential diagnosis in young animals with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or neutropenia."}
