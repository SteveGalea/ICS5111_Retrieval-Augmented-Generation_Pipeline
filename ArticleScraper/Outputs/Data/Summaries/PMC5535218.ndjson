{"summary": "nanoparticles (NP) have been extensively investigated in biomedical applications ranging from biomaterials, diagnostics, to therapeutic treatments for cancers and other related diseases. research into the use of engineered bulk size materials (i.e., stainless steels) [11,12,13], micro- [14,15], and nano- [1,16] sized materials against a spectrum of bacteria and viruses have been a popular field. AMNP derivatives were synthesized in a previous work with a stable efficacy (99.99% killing rates) in order to counteract a range of super bugs (i.e., E. coli, MRSA) and a range of viruses (SARS, H5N1, and Noroviruses) [30,31] AMNP doped polymer fibres produced using pressurized gyration were recently found to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. we found that C, W, Ag, Cu, and O are the main elements contained in these AMNP formulations. by understanding the lattice structures and chemistry of these antimicrobial nanoparticle composites, we hope to identify biological surface-interactions. this will help in studying the reaction mechanisms involved in target bacterium or viruses. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to identify the types of components (organic/inorganic/polymer) that may be contained in these nanoparticles. four samples were investigated; this included the commercially available WC (1 m) from Alfa Aesear\u00ae, AMNP0, AMNP1 and AMNP2. detailed analysis of the Raman spectra acquired, additional composition information was obtained in line with the characteristic spectral profiles. the Raman spectra for AMNP1 and AMNP2 (Figure 3a,b) were observed to exhibit significant differences with respect to those of the commercial WC and AMNP0. the lack of NMR study in metal carbides is due to the lack of aliphatic carbon (CH) present in carbide ions and also the attribution of the sp hybridised carbon. this is due to the lack of aliphatic carbon (CH) present in carbide ions. commercial WC and AMNP0 samples contain single phase hexagonal WC. XRD analyses also identified 0.3\u20130.5% of the impurities as monoclinic MoO3 and hexagonal MoS2 in the commercial WC sample. multiple phase tungsten carbides were identified in AMNP1. this includes hexagonal WC (P 6 m2) and two carbon deficient ones. tungsten carbide derivatives, some W and Ag in cubic forms were also found in both AMNP1 and AMNP2. multiple point selective analyses of AMNP1 and AMNP2 were performed using EDX. XPS spectra of AMNP1 and AMNP2 were performed to quantify elemental ratio. the initial asymmetric peak at 284 eV with a tailed binding energy of 288 eV was found in both C1s spectra. both AMNP1 and AMNP2 have a high concentration of sp2 carbons. if the sample contains a high sp3 concentration, the peak will appear to be more symmetrical. several binding energies were measured at the W4f core in AMNP1. they all appeared as asymmetric doublets at 30/32 eV, 31.5/33.5 eV, and 32.5/35 eV. these three sets of doublets are believed to be associated with the multiple phases of W identified in the XRD results. atomic ratio of samples AMNP0, AMNP1 and AMNP2 measured at 932.8/952.6 eV in AMNP2 is substantially higher than those found in AMNP1. XPS atomic percentage for AMNP0, AMNP1 and AMNP2 is given in Table 2. the exact content of these elements are not easy to determine in highly complex and heavily agglomerated nanopowders prepared using bulk forming methods. both AMNP1 and AMNP2 were found to be heavily agglomerated and highly charged due to the nonconductive nature of the samples. FTIR spectroscopies provided complimentary analyses to characterise the presence of intramolecular bonding in these composites. four samples were investigated; this included the commercially available WC (1 m) from Alfa Aesear\u00ae (Lancashire, UK), AMNP0, AMNP1 and AMNP2. the Raman spectra for AMNP1 and AMNP2 (Figure 3a,b) were observed to exhibit significant differences with respect to those of the commercial WC and AMNP0. in summary, clearly defined vibrational bands centred at ca. 1335/1298 and 1582/1597 cm1 were observed for AMNP1/AMNP2 respectively. the relative intensity of the D and G vibrational bands indicates a greater degree of graphitisation in AMNP2 [40], respectively. three active carbon chemical signals resonating at C 123, 254 and 307 ppm. the one that resonated at C 123 ppm is typically associated with aromatic/graphitic/charcoal type of carbon. the other two deshielded resonances at C 254 and 307 ppm indicated carbon environments that are less electronegative. commercial WC and AMNP0 samples have unambiguously confirmed that these two samples contain single phase hexagonal WC, known as Qusongite [44] XRD analyses also identified 0.3\u20130.5% of the impurities as monoclinic MoO3 and hexagonal MoS2. tungsten carbide derivatives, some W and Ag in cubic forms were also found in both AMNP1 and AMNP2. a trace amount of cubic CuO was also detected in the AMNP2 sample. EDX spectra of AMNP1 and AMNP2 were performed in previous Raman, NMR, and XRD analyses. XPS energy profiles were measured at different etch times. XPS W4f spectrum acquired from AMNP0, consistent binding energies (eV) at 32, 34 (4f7/2 and 4f5/2 doublet) and 37 (5p3/2) were measured throughout, and these signals again indicated the presence of the carbidic bonding associated with WC in the AMNP0 [53]. metal Tungsten (W) has reference XPS binding energy of 31.6/33.5 (doublet) and this W4f7/2 feature in lost as the transition state of W changes to other W compounds (i.e., W2C/WC) eV shifts to higher energy are observed in both AMNP1 and AMNP2. a significant amount of Ag in AMNP2 was detected when compared to AMNP1. a significant amount of Ag in AMNP2 was detected when compared to AMNP1. atomic ratio variation between C, O, W, Ag, and Cu was investigated. AMNP0, AMNP1 and AMNP2 were previously prepared by Qinetiq Nanomaterials\u00ae using patented TesimaTM thermal plasma technology (Farnborough, UK) all materials were used as received unless indicated otherwise. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope (Gloucestershire, UK) and associated WiRE 3.4 software supplied by the manufacturer. all measurements were performed by means of the 785 nm excitation wavelength and a 2 mW power laser. X-ray Powder Diffraction Multiple XRD analyses were performed on each sample using different instruments and methods. selected XRD results of commercial WC and AMNP0 were acquired on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) using Cu K radiation. data were collected from 5 to 80\u00b0 2 in steps of 0.04\u00b0 and a counting time of 1 s equivalent was used at each point. all data were collected with an accelerating voltage of 0.1\u201330 kV, a spot size of 70 50 mm, and at a working distance of 1\u201340 mm. 3.7. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy All powder samples (1\u20132 g) were moulded and pressed into disks (2 2 mm2) with a thickness of 1 mm. AMNP0 (3 mg) was secured onto a carbon based adhesive substrate. powder samples (3 mg) of AMNP1 and AMNP2 were dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol prior analysis. samples were sputter-coated with 20 nm of gold for 180 s under argon. the data were further analysed using the BioRed\u00ae (Philadelphia, PA, USA) program. all visible Raman shifts were studied against the references supported by the database within the program. between 1000 and 1600 repetitions were accumulated. data were collected from 5 to 120\u00b0 2 in steps of 0.04\u00b0. a counting time of 200 s equivalent was used at each point. all four data sets were analysed using the HighScore program. VG Scientific ESCALAB250 (Waltham, MA, USA) surface analysis system equipped with 3 kV Argon ion sputtering device operated at 500 eV and at a sputter etching rate of 0.02 nm/s. the pass energy of 50 eV and energy step size of 0.1 eV were used in all experiments. the high metallic ratio in AMNP2 was found to be five times more than that found in AMNP1 (17% vs. 3%). the majority of the high carbon content found in both AMNP1 and AMNP2 may have been designed to increase bio-compatibilities."}
