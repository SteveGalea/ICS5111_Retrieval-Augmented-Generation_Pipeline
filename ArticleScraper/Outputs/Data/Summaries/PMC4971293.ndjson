{"summary": "notable viral pandemics include the small pox pandemics of Eurasia and North America, the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (H1N1 virus, 50 million deaths), and the 1957 Asian flu pandemic (H2N2 virus, 69,800 deaths) globalization has heightened the risk of rapid widespread viral transmission, especially of viruses transmitted via the respiratory route or close contact. sporadic cases of influenza caused by emerging respiratory viruses have been observed in china. some sporadic cases of influenza caused by the emerging viruses of H10N8 (3 cases/2 deaths) and H5N6 (2 cases/1 death) have been observed in china. china has accumulated valuable experience in the ongoing war to control emerging virus outbreaks. we analyze the lessons from the SARS Tragedy The SARS virus spread rapidly in china and internationally, causing global panic. china missed its best opportunity to contain the epidemic in a timely manner. the government did not organize effective collaborations to facilitate identification of the offending pathogen as soon as possible. china missed its best opportunity to contain the epidemic in a timely manner. china accelerated the establishment of an effectual and national unified management system for public health emergencies. in 2004, two cases of laboratory-acquired SARS were reported. these infections were transmitted to seven additional people, one of whom died as a result. china issued a technical guide for avian flu prevention and control in 2004 [21] it requires that suspected and confirmed cases be handled quickly at designated hospitals with the equipment to prevent nosocomial infection. the guide suggests that persons exposed to dead poultry infected by avian flu be isolated and observed for 7 days. china has built 11 national technology platforms, 11 national research centers, 6 national key laboratories, and 2 national engineering laboratories. in 2010, the Chinese National Influenza Centre was designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. to achieve it, China has developed state-of-the-art pathogen isolation and identification technologies such as high-throughput sequencing method. researchers have revealed the crystal structures of key viral proteins (e.g., SARS-Cov protease, H1N1 neuraminidase N1, and H5N1 polymerase PAC-PB1N complex) a traditional Chinese medicine herbal formula was confirmed to reduce H1N1 influenza-associated fever safely and with efficacy similar to that of oseltamivir in a randomized clinical trial. report of 37 notifiable diseases reported delay to be reduced from 5 days to within 4 hours. as of June 2015, nine countries have been affected by Ebola (27,273 cases/11,173 deaths) as of June 2015, nine countries have been affected by Ebola. more healthcare funding is needed in rural areas. it will be important to construct a better epidemic disease surveillance system. the government should restrict the consumption of wild animals, centralize poultry slaughtering."}
