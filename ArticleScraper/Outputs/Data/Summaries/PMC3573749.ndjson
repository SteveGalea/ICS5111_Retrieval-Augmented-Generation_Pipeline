{"summary": "HCV is an important cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leading to a need for liver transplantation (2,3) no vaccines are available. curcumin inhibited a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1)-induced HCV replication via the inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway. the catabolism of heme by heme oxygenase (HO) resulted in the production of biliverdin, carbon monoxide and free iron. curcumin has been found to have anti-metastatic properties via the inhibition of NF-B in the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (33) curcumin inhibited connective tissue growth factor gene expression by suppressing ERK signaling in activated hepatic stellate cells (35) curcumin inhibited phorbol myristate acetate-induced MCP-1 gene expression by inhibiting ERK and NF-B lucFMDV2aUb containing Renilla luciferase reporter was cultured in DMEM. the nuclear extraction kit was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA, USA) Curcumin (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium), LY294002, U0126 and Ro1069920 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK) real-time RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from Huh7.5 cells expressing the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon. RT was performed on 2 g of total RNA by 1.5 M random hexamer. Western blotting For western blotting, analytical 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed. proteins in the SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a trans-blot apparatus. antibodies against HCV NS5A and HCV NA5B were used. equent to adding siRNA for 6 h, the medium was changed to fresh condition medium for 18 h. the transfected cells were then analyzed by western blotting. all statistics were calculated using SigmaStat version 3.5 (Systat Software) Luciferase reporter assay Cells were subcultured at a density of 4105 cells/well in 1 ml of culture medium in a 12-well plastic dish for 6 h. the cells were lysed and cell lysates were prepared for a Renilla luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) gene expression changes were assessed using the comparative Ct method. the relative amounts of mRNA for HCV were optimized by subtracting the Ct values of HCV from the Ct values of GAPDH mRNA. HO-1 knockdown by siRNA Cells (3106) were seeded in 10-cm dishes for 6 h. negative control small interfering (siRNA) (10 nM) or HO-1 siRNA (10 nM) (Invitrogen) was transfected into cells using the RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent. transfected cells were then analyzed by western blotting. curcumin dose-dependently inhibits HCV replication in hepatoma cells. cells were subcultured at a density of 4105 cells/well in a 12-well plastic dish for 6 h. curcumin or DMSO was added to the medium for 24 h. total protein was isolated and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. cells were subcultured at a density of 1.5106 cells in 4 ml of culture medium. curcumin or DMSO was added to the medium for 24 h. total protein was isolated and analyzed by western blot analysis. cells were subcultured at a density of 1.5106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium for 6 h. total protein was isolated and analyzed by western blot analysis. HO-1 knockdown partially reversed curcumin-inhibited viral protein expression. cells were subcultured at a density of 1.5106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium for 6 h. curcumin or DMSO was added to the medium for 24 h. total cell lysates (up) or cytosol-nuclear fraction (down) were isolated. curcumin was the only chemical to induce the HO-1 expression. PI3K-AKT LY294002 slightly inhibited the HCV protein expression. curcumin-inhibited HCV replication was partially mediated. curcumin inhibits luciferase reporter gene activity in hepatoma cells. cells were subcultured at a density of 1.5106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium in a 6-cm plastic dish for 6 h. curcumin is known to induce HO-1 expression in various cells. this effect was analyzed in Huh7.5-HCV cells. curcumin slightly induced HO-1 expression in a 6-h treatment, while significantly inducing it in 12 and 24 h. total protein was isolated and analyzed by western blot analysis. hemin reduced HCV replication and the HCV protein expression. curcumin inhibited the protein expression of NS5A and NS5B. HO-1 knockdown slightly increased the NS5A and NS5B protein expressions in the basal condition. at the same time, it partially but significantly reversed the curcumin-inhibited expression of NS5A and NS5B. curcumin-induced HO-1 was involved in curcumin-inhibited HCV replication. cells were subcultured at a density of 1.5106 cells in 8 ml of culture medium for 6 h. chemical (LY, LY294002; U0, U0126; Ro, Ro1069920) or DMSO was added to the medium for 24 h. the experiments were repeated three times. curcumin inhibits HCV replication in cellular analysis. curcumin-induced gene is thought to be a potential therapeutic protein for the re-establishment of homeostasis. HO-1 knockdown partially reversed curcumin-inhibited HCV replication. curcumin-inhibited PI3K-AKT was slightly involved in the anti-HCV activity of curcumin. in the case of HBV, activation of MEK-ERK signaling led to the inhibition of HBV replication. HCV NS2 activates the IL-8 gene expression by activating the NF-B pathway in hepatoma cells. in the infectious JFH1 model, HCV is suggested to enhance hepatic fibrosis progression through the induction of TGF-1. NF-B expression is abundant in the cytoplasm of Huh7.5 cells. curcumin-inhibited NF-B does not have any benefit in anti-HCV activity. the presence or absence of the inhibition of NF-B in anti-HCV therapy is likely to depend on the activation status of NF-B."}
