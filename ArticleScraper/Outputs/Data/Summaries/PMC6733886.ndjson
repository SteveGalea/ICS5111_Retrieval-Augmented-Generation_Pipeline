{"summary": "recent studies have indicated that protease inhibitors suppress tumor growth and progression. NM is a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor synthesized by Fujii et al. NM inhibits liver metastasis at concentrations of 106\u2013107 M in colon adenocarcinoma. NM has been proven to downregulate the expression of both matrix metalloproteinase2 and9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1) NM significantly inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion in triple-negative breast cancer. NM reversed tumor progression induced by MC-derived tryptase. c-IAP1/2 is no longer recruited, and RIP1 is not ubiquitinated. c-IAP1/2 modifies RIP1 with polyubiquitin chains. NF-b activation occurs via degradation of the inhibitor of B (IB) family. cytoplasmic NF-B binds in a resting state. the entire pathway induces activation of NF-B heterodimers. only deficiency of c-Rel in NF-B subunits could suppress the generation and maintenance of activated regulatory T cells for impeding immune tolerance. NM has been shown to potently inhibit canonical NF-B pathways and further suppress the aggressive behavior of various cancer. the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), VEGF, and MMP-9, the downstream transcription target genes of NF-B (34\u201336), was stifled owing to NM-induced suppression of NF-B activity. NM could significantly decreased NF-B activation which reducing tumor growth, neovascularization and prolonged survival by apoptosis modulation in pancreatic in vivo models. combination of NM and chemotherapeutics agents, such as oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, could increase sensitivity of single-agent and combination chemotherapy. similar studies have revealed that NM inhibited NF-B activity in hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder and gastric cancers both in vitro and in vivo. NM treatment combined with 5 Gy ionizing radiation in pancreatic cancer. both NF-B and p53 are activated in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation. c-IAP1/2 Inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis. nPTX (0.5, 0.683, and 4.9 mM, respectively) and NM (80 g/mL) (21) Paclitaxel AsPc-1 cells p65 and phosphorylated IB; Cleaved caspase-8/caspase-3; Induction of apoptosis andG2/M arrest Paclitaxel (10 M) and NM (80 g/mL) (22) IR Panc-1/MIA PaCa proliferation Induction of apoptosis and G1 arrest Paclitaxel (1 M) and NM (16 g/ml) TNF-a Huh-7/Hep3B cells p65, p50, and phosphorylated IB; Cleaved caspase-8/PARP; Inhibition of cell proliferation Induction of apoptosis Gemcitabine (1 M) and NM (20 g/ml) TNFR1; Cleaved caspase-8/caspase-3/PARP; c-IAP1/2; Inhibition of tumor growth Induction of apoptosis AxCAhTNF- (1*108 particle units in 20 l of PBS) Gemcitabine (100 mg/kg) and NM (30 mg/kg) (20) Gemcitabine (GEM) plus nab-paclitaxel (nPTX) NM (30 mg/kg) (24) Gastric cancer Paclitaxel Injection Xenografts nude mice p65 and phosphorylated IB; Cleaved caspase-8/caspase-3/PARP; Inhibition of tumor growth Induction of apoptosis AxCAhTNF- (1*108 particle units in 20 l of PBS) NM (30 mg/kg) (17) gallbladder cancer Gemcitabine Injection X NM, alone or in combination with other anticancer treatments, plays a powerful role as a candidate intervention in NF-B signaling for cancer therapy. TNFR1 signaling Apoptosis is a cellular suicide program that plays a pivotal role in the repression of cancer development. complex recruits a series of proteins, including TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRADD, c-IAP1/2, and RIP1. this complex leads to the activation of canonical NF-B signaling pathways. targeting TNFR1-induced pro-apoptotic pathways may represent a pivotal approach for cancer therapy. NM inhibits oxaliplatin-induced and TNF-- and gemcitabine-induce c-IAP1/2 activity in pancreatic cancer. NM potentiates antitumor effects via inhibition of c-IAP1/2 expression in a positive feedback loop. tryptase, a trypsin-like serine-proteinases, is the most abundant secretion of mast cells (42) e is a vital mediator in biological pathways, including tissue remodeling and carcinogenesis. a correlation was demonstrated between serum mast cell densities positive for tryptase (MCDPT) and microvascular density and endothelial area in patients undergoing surgery in colorectal, breast and gastric cancers. tryptase itself or the process that tryptase acts on might become potential drug targets for cancer therapy. NM possessed the ability to reverse tube formation caused by tryptase. it is well-known that ANGPT1 targets the TIE2 receptor as an agonist. more studies are needed both in vitro and in vivo in the future. the entire canonical pathway induces activation of NF-B heterodimers, including p50 and p65 or p65 or p50 and c-Rel. activation of the non-canonical pathway generates p53 and RELB at a slow and persistent speed with involvement of only IKK (30). mice lacking c-REL experienced delayed melanoma growth and enhanced antiprogrammed cell death-1 immunotherapy responses. targeting only c-Rel may prevent undesirable side effects. NM has been shown to potently inhibit canonical NF-B pathways. NM inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis by IB/NF-B/p65 nuclear translocation and caspase families regulation in colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (15\u201317). NM have confirmed effective antineoplastic properties with reduced diameters, volumes, and weights of tumors as a single agent. similar studies have revealed that NM inhibited NF-B activation in hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder and gastric cancers both in vitro and in vivo. NM sensitized oxaliplatin-induced NF-B/p65 activation via suppressing phosphorylated IB and IKK/ in colorectal cancer. c-IAP1/2 Inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis Oxaliplatin (20 M) and NM (160 g/ml) Gemcitabine and TNF-a MIAPaCa-2/AsPC-1 cells p50, p65, and phosphorylated IB. nPTX (0.5, 0.683, and 4.9 mM, respectively) and NM (80 g/ml) colorectal cancer Oxaliplatin HCT 116/SW 1116 cells p65, phosphorylated IB and phosphorylated IKK/. cleaved caspase-8/caspase-3; Mdm2/p53/ p21Waf1/Cip1; Inhibition of cell proliferation; induction of apoptosis; arrest 6Gy (2, 6, 10Gy for cell proliferation assay) the anti-tumor activities of combination of NM and chemotherapy/radiotherapy in vivo. the anti-tumor activities of combination of NM and chemotherapy/radiotherapy in vivo. inhibition of tumor growth Induction of apoptosis GEM (50 mg/kg), nPTX (0.5 mg/kg) and NM (30 mg/kg) (21) Paclitaxel Injection Xenografts nude mice p65 and phosphorylated IB; Cleaved caspase-8/caspase-3; Inhibition of tumor growth; neovascularization Induction of apoptosis. apoptosis is a cellular suicide program that plays a pivotal role in the repression of cancer development. TNFR1 Signaling Apoptosis is a cellular suicide program that plays a crucial role in the repression of cancer development. TNFR1 is ubiquitously expressed on almost all cells of the human body. it is the primary mediator stimulated by soluble TNF. when TNF binds and activates TNFR1, both pro-apoptosis pathways and anti-apoptosis pathways are affected. NM upregulates expression of TNFR1 in a dose-dependent manner. expression of caspase-8 was upregulated to facilitate apoptosis. NM inhibits oxaliplatin-induced and TNF-- and gemcitabine-induce c-IAP1/2 activity in pancreatic cancer. tryptase is the most abundant secretion of mast cells (42) tryptase contains a hydrolyzing peptide that binds to the carboxyl terminus of basic residues and a tetrameric structure. tryptase- is the major circulating isoform, and tryptase- is the major form stored in secretory granules (42). NM inhibits tryptase in colon and pancreatic cancer. NM blocks cell proliferation induced by tryptase or protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) in a concentration-dependent fashion. studies on the mechanism of targeting tryptase cancer therapy are in their infancy. NM is a synthetic low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor clinically used for acute pancreatitis. NM reduces anticoagulation values of patient to safe levels with an infused rate of 0.2\u20130.5 mg/kg per hour (52) phase I study was performed with 12 patients enrolled. the regimen contained administration of gemcitabine at a fixed dose of 1,000 mg/m2 for 30 min on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. no patients experienced dose-limiting toxic effects at any level of incremental dose. in unresectable pancreatic cancer, in vivo studies found that known adverse effects of NM, such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hepatopathy, were comparable between mice treated with NM at a dosage of 30 g/g and PBS three times a week for 6 weeks. in a single-arm, single center, phase II trial, leukopenia and neutropenia primarily appeared in pancreatic cancer patients who received NM (4.8 mg NM suppressed local C5a/C3a production and attenuated T cell auto-reactivity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. NM effectively increased the activity of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in hepatic resection patients (64). NM induced CD8 T-cell proliferation, and played a co-adjuvant for peptide vaccination (65). NM reversed IFN--induced up-regulation of PD-L1 in lung cancer and pancreatic cancer cells. the pivotal immune escape factor human leukocyte antigen-ABC (HLA-ABC) may help differentiate benign from malignant indeterminate pulmonary lesions. antitumor effects of NM have been analyzed (74\u201376) and compared to GM in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP), wound healing and DIC (7, 77, 78). similar to NM, GM exerted significant antitumorigenic effects on suppression of TNF-induced NF-B expression and promotion of caspase-3, 7 activity in human pancreatic cancer cells. the protease inhibitor bortezomib is the first drug approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma treatment. NM showed the analogous inhibitory effects on NF-B activation and IFN-induced PD-L1 expression (66). NM could sensitize solid tumors to chemotherapy or classical chemo-radiotherapy (15\u201324, 37, 80) NM exerts a dose-dependent inhibition of chlamydial infection. NM could inhibit middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections and the ebola virus disease. NM decreased the generation of proinflammatory factors TNF-, interleukin-1 (IL-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo-oxygenase-2. NM effectively increased the activity of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in hepatic resection patients. the pivotal immune escape factor human leukocyte antigen-ABC (HLA-ABC) may help differentiate benign from malignant indeterminate pulmonary lesions (67). the inhibited effects of NM are associated with PD-L1-mediated immune evasion pathways including PAR-1, STAT1, STAT3, protein kinase B (Akt), interferon regulatory factors-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase signals. NM exerted significant antitumorigenic effects on suppression of TNF-induced NF-B expression and promotion of caspase-3, 7 activity in human pancreatic cancer cells. in vitro and in vivo studies reported that GM attenuated MMP activities and reduced cell growth, invasion and angiogenesis in colon cancer. GM may represent a promising therapeutic agent for metastatic colorectal cancer. NM showed the analogous inhibitory effects on NF-B activation and IFN-induced PD-L1 expression (66). NM could sensitize solid tumors to chemotherapy or classical chemo-radiotherapy (15\u201324, 37, 80). despite limitations of current proteases inhibitors, NM may apply for the treatment of solid tumor as new aspect. NM exerts a dose-dependent inhibition of chlamydial infection. NM could effectively minimize pathological features of chlamydial-induced arthritis. NM has been validated to ameliorate cancer therapy resistance and avoid immune resistance. existing clinical data showed relatively preferable efficacy and safety in NM treatment. NM has comparable antitumor activities and advantages in human pancreatic and colorectal cancer."}
