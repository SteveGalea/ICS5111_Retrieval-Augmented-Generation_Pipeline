{"summary": "a diverse and growing family of viruses can be divided into the old and new world arenaviruses. the names reflect both their antigenic relationships and geographic divisions. the new world arenaviruses include the Junin (JUNV), Chapare (CHPV), Machupo (MACV), and Sabia (SABV) viruses. arenavirus NP is a multifunctional protein and is the most abundant structural component of viral particles (5). if administered early in the course of disease, this treatment reduces the case fatality rate from 20% to 1% (3, 4). apoptosis can be initiated by both extrinsic and intrinsic signals. the extrinsic pathway is mediated by death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor family on the cell surface. the intrinsic pathway is triggered by the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c from its inner membrane into the cytosol (15). both pathways activate a proteolytic cascade of caspases. the presence of NP leads to a reduction in caspase 3 cleavage in apoptotic cells. this property of NP likely plays a significant role in the lack of apoptosis induction observed in JUNV-infected cells. the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. the cells were placed in fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS, 2 ml. all caspase cleavage NP mutants contained Flag tags. veroE6 cells (80% confluent) were infected with DMEM in a 162-cm2 flask (Greiner) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after infection, the inoculum was removed and fresh DMEM was added. the cells treated with DMSO only were used as controls. the cells were incubated in cell extraction buffer (Invitrogen) for 30 min. tubulin and vinculin were detected using mouse monoclonal antibodies (1:5,000 dilution) (Sigma-Aldrich) and a secondary Alexa 680-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5,000 dilution) (Molecular Probes) or a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:30,000 dilution) (Dako) a pCAGGS-JUNV NP-specific antibody (guinea pig) at a dilution of 1:100 and a secondary Alexa 488-coupled goat anti-guinea pig antibody (1:500 dilution) were used. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was provided by Friedemann Weber (Philipps Universit\u00e4t Marburg) all caspase cleavage NP mutants contained Flag tags at the C termini. transfections into HEK293, Huh7, and veroE6 cells (60% confluent) were carried out using transIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to manufacturer's instructions. DMEM containing 2% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin was added. the cells were seeded for 50 to 60% confluence in 12-well culture plates. the cells were further incubated for 24 h and harvested for Western blot analyses. fonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the cell extraction buffer prior to incubation. proteins were separated on 8% to 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis. tubulin and vinculin were detected using mouse monoclonal antibodies (1:5,000 dilution) a rabbit anti-caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and a rabbit anti-PARP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) were used. a secondary swine anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:30,000 dilution) (Dako) were used. ULTS JUNV NP is cleaved in transfected and in infected cells. expression of the closely related TCRV NP did not lead to a distinct cleavage pattern. expression of the closely related TCRV NP did not lead to the formation of a distinct cleavage pattern. veroE6 cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression plasmids pCAGGS (pC)-JUNV NPn-Flag, pC-JUNV NPc-Flag, pC-TCRV NPn-Flag, and pC-TCRV NPc-Flag. after 48 h, cell lysates were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using either cleavage products were visualized as described for panel C. they were then quantified and expressed as a percentage of corresponding bands in the NP cell lysate fractions. a similar cleavage pattern was also detected, again indicating that these products were indeed derived from JUNV NP. we purified the supernatant of JUNV-infected VeroE6 cells over a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion to determine whether the cleaved NP fragments were present in viral particles. most of the observed NP cleavage products were also incorporated into released virions. however, the 62-kDa band did not demonstrate detectable incorporation into virions. GraBCas analyzed its amino acid sequence for conserved proteolytic cleavage motifs. the predicted sizes of the cleavage products for DSID (62 kDa), LASD (53 kDa), DVKD (47 kDa) and QEHD (40 kDa) closely fit the observed cleavage pattern of NP. a prediction score of >15 for one or more caspases, as predicted by GraBCas, as well as the predicted cleavage products. the eukaryotic expression plasmid pC-JUNV NPc-Flag (wt) mutants were transfected with the eukaryotic expression plasmid pC-JUNV NPc-Flag (wt) or with the various constructs containing mutations in the predicted mutants NP(NSIN), pC-NP(LASN), pC-NP(QEHN), pC-NP(QEHN), and pC-NP(NSIN/LASN/QEHN) showed the same cleavage pattern as wild-type (wt) NP, indicating that these cleavage sites were not involved in producing the observed NP cleavage products. however, an analysis of the expression of NP(NV mutations of both motifs (DVKD and QEHD) in the double mutant resulted in reductions of over 90% (47 kDa) and 95% (40 kDa) of the respective cleavage products. caspase activation promotes cleavage of NP. an analysis of NP expression revealed enhanced cleavage of NP. increased cleavage of NP, reflecting increased caspase activity, varied from 40 to 80% for each of the individual cleavage products. kDa, 47-kDa, and 40-kDa NP bands were quantified for each condition and set in relation to uncleaved NP (65 kDa) values given are the averages of three independent experiments. caspase 3 and PARP cleavage were analyzed as hallmarks of apoptosis. cleavages of effector caspase 3 and of PARP were analyzed as hallmarks of apoptosis. cleavages of effector caspase 3 and of PARP were analyzed. the knockout of caspase cleavage motifs DVKD and QEHD within JUNV NP diminished the ability of JUNV NP to reduce caspase 3 cleavage in apoptotic cells. V NP served as a control; statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. nonsignificant differences (n.s.) are also indicated. V infection of veroE6 cells does not induce apoptosis. the cells were inoculated with JUNV at MOIs of 1 and 3. the formation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in infected cells was monitored daily. JUNV infection in veroE6 cells does not induce apoptosis. the cells were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1 or 3. no cleavage of caspase 3 or PARP was detectable. the prominent bands corresponded to sizes of about 53, 47, and 40 kDa. expression of the NPn-Flag did not reveal the presence of similarly sized cleavage products. expression of the closely related TCRV NP did not lead to a distinct cleavage pattern. pC-JUNV NPc-Flag, pC-TCRV NPn-Flag, and pC-TCRV NPc-Flag. cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression plasmid pC-JUNV NPc-Flag. after 48 h, cell lysates were collected and analyzed by blotting. untagged JUNV NP showed comparable cleavage products. lysates were analyzed using a specific anti-JUNV NP antibody. the presence of the Flag tag had no influence on NP degradation into the distinct products. purified virions showed incorporation of the 53-kDa, 47-kDa, and 40-kDa NP fragments. however, the 62-kDa band did not demonstrate detectable incorporation into virions. these data were then further quantified by calculation of the amounts of each cleavage product in relation to the full-length NP. the relative positions of the putative caspase cleavage motifs, as well as the predicted cleavage products, are illustrated in Fig. 2A. the predicted caspase cleavage motifs can be recognized by a variety of caspases, including caspases 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. cell lysates were quantified and expressed as percentages of the corresponding bands in the NP wild-type (wt) cell lysate fractions. data represent the mean values and standard deviations of four independent experiments. mutants NP(NSIN) and NP(LASN) showed the same cleavage pattern as wild-type (wt) NP, indicating that these cleavage sites were not involved in producing the observed NP cleavage products. however, an analysis of the expression of NP(NVKN) and NP(QEHN) showed clear alterations in their cleavage patterns. mutations of the DVKD motif were accompanied by the disappearance of kDa product relative to the corresponding levels of NP (wt), while the QEHD motif resulted in a 95% decrease in levels of the 40-kDa protein band. the double mutant resulted in reductions of over 90% (47 kDa) and 95% (40 kDa) of respective cleavage products. quantifications of cleavage products showed a reduction of slightly more than 50% in the formation of each of the various cleavage products. caspase activity directly influences JUNV NP cleavage. DMSO only, 2.5 M CPT, or 50 M Z-VAD-FMK were quantified. the values given are the averages of three independent experiments. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in comparison to the control fractions. caspase 3 and PARP cleavage were examined by Western blotting. expression of JUNV NP shifted the ratio toward uncleaved caspase 3. however, expression of TCRV NP had no significant influence on caspase 3 cleavage after the induction of apoptosis. a direct comparison of CPT-treated cells (2.5 M) expressing JUNV NP (wt) with the mutant NP (NVKN/QEHN) revealed that the missing cleavage events were accompanied by a strong reduction of the antiapoptotic effect of NP (wt) 6 cells were treated with 50 M Z-VAD-FMK before apoptosis was induced. after 24 h, cell lysates were collected and analyzed by blotting. samples were probed for PARP and caspase 3 and their respective cleavage products. the formation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in infected cells was monitored daily. samples were harvested for analysis of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. the cells were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize chromatin condensation. veroE6 cells were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1 or 3 and with VSV (MOI of 0.01) as a positive control. the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI to visualize chromatin condensation. PARP and caspase 3 cleavage during JUNV infection. several viruses from different families have developed different mechanisms for suppressing apoptosis in infected cells. caspases modulate caspase activity via several direct and indirect mechanisms. the prevention of mitochondrial permeabilization has been described for the myxoma virus and the Epstein-Barr virus. the formation of these products appears to be conserved among members of both the Old World and New World arenaviruses. however, none of the putative caspase cleavage sites were directly linked to the formation of the 53-kDa cleavage product. the extent of intracellular NP cleavage was directly dependent on the enzymatic activity of caspases. the presence of NP and its cleavage are sufficient to reduce caspase 3 cleavage in apoptotic cells, demonstrating its antiapoptotic function. this conclusion is supported by the results of experiments showing an absence of any hallmarks of apoptosis induction. the DVKD motif is not used, which might explain the functional differences between the TCRV and JUNV NPs in terms of their abilities to inhibit apoptosis. a novel mechanism by which the JUNV NP facilitates evasion of programmed cell death. cleavage of NP by caspases and resulting formation of truncated products may have specific consequences for viral replication, budding, and/or pathogenesis. in this case, cellular enzymatic caspase activity would be used for production of additional protein products with distinct biological activities. truncated forms of NP may play additional roles early in the viral life cycle. this opens the possibility that these truncated forms of NP may play additional roles early in the viral life cycle. a balance between caspase activation and apoptosis inhibition might be needed for JUNV infection."}
