{"summary": "infantile-onset Pompe disease is the most severe phenotype. enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa improves medical and functional outcomes in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease. patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease develop cardiomegaly and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that progress to left ventricular outflow obstruction, as well as systolic and diastolic dysfunction. progressive deposition of glycogen results in conduction defects as seen by shortening of the PR interval on electrocardiogram. reevaluate the patient at a later date to allow her pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease and her right ventricle to remodel. at follow-up at 2 months of life, the patient demonstrated new biventricular hypertrophy and new, moderately diminished left ventricular systolic function. four days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with severe hypotonia, decreased oral intake, and vomiting. an echocardiogram revealed worsening of her systolic function with an ejection fraction of 25%-30%, down from 30%-35% the week prior. she was transferred from the general pediatric unit to the pediatric cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) to initiate a milrinone infusion. the patient had increased work of breathing, elevated heart rate, and elevated brain natriuretic peptide level. the patient was fed via a nasogastric tube during her initial stay. she underwent a swallow study that showed severe pharyngeal dysphagia. the recommendation from speech therapy was no oral feeds. she subsequently had a gastric tube placement. at age 2 months, the patient presented with new systolic dysfunction and worsened biventricular hypertrophy. at 3 months she was diagnosed with Pompe disease; at 3 months, 3 weeks she was admitted to the hospital for bronchiolitis and worsening heart function. at 9 months, she rolled over for the first time and was discharged home from the hospital at 8 months. osomes disrupt the contractile apparatus in muscle fibers. currently unknown abnormalities in a subset of lysosomes interfere with the recycling of autophagosomes and their contents, which leads to cardiac and skeletal muscle damage. despite her death, we believe that her heart had significantly improved. her death was related to the sequelae of her respiratory infection and hypotonia."}
