See above Amoxicillin A higher affinity for pbp. a total of 527 patients (18\u201370 years old) were randomized to treat with nemonoxacin or levofloxacin. nemonoxacin was as effective and safe as levofloxacin in the treatment of adult CAP patients. nemonoxacin does not induce or inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, C19, and 3A4 isozymes. nemonoxacin does not exhibit evidences of phototoxicity, systemic active allergic reactions, significant hepatotoxicity or severe CNS toxicity. 345 participants with moderate acute bacterial exacerbation COPD were selected. antibacterial efficacy of zabofloxacin and moxifloxacin therapies were observed. no statistical differences of acute AEs and serious AEs were detected between the two arms. tetracycline Omadacycline was a novel once-daily aminomethylcycline antibiotic. it became the second tetracycline antibiotic approved by the FDA in 2018. it has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical pathogens. omadacycline is a novel once-daily aminomethylcycline antibiotic. omadacycline has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical pathogens. omadacycline has antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative, Gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical pathogens. omadacycline has good activity against H. influenza, M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Enterobacteriaceae, Ureaplasma spp., Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Clostridium difficile. a phase 3 trial (NCT02531438) on the efficacy and safety of omacycline for CAP patients had been successfully completed. omadacycline contains a unique alkylaminomethyl side chain at the C9 position of the tetracycline. omadacycline does not affect cytochrome P450, and most common AEs of omadacycline are gastrointestinal symptoms (2019). there is no need for the elderly with impaired or hepatic function to adjust dose of omadacycline. 78.2% participants had an ECR in the solithromycin group compared with 77.9% in the moxifloxacin group. subjects over 65 years of age with a history of asthma had higher success rates for ECR and short term follow-up than those without COPD. solithromycin is a novel 4th generation macrolide. it is the first fluoroketolide to complete phase 3 clinical trials. it is less susceptible to mef(A)-mediated efflux than other macrolides. 78.2% participants had an ECR in the solithromycin group compared with 77.9% in the moxifloxacin group. subjects over 65 years of age with a history of asthma and COPD had higher success rates for ECR and short term follow-up than those without COPD. solithromycin is available in both oral and intravenous formulation. it is highly potent with effective bacteriostatic properties and eradication rates. solithromycin is available in both oral and intravenous formulation. in both FOCUS 1 and 2, ceftaroline and ceftriaxone were well tolerated, with similar rates of AEs, serious AEs, deaths and discontinuations. the experimental group used exactly the same intervention as in FOCUS. the control group used double dosage of ceftriaxone. ceftobiprole Ceftobiprole has good activity against Gram-positive pathogens. it has species-dependent activity against Gram-negative pathogens. clinical cure rates for CAP patients were 86.6% vs 87.4%. 5%CI, 6.9, 5.3) and 76.4% vs 79.3% (ITT population, 95% CI, 9.3, 3.6) common and serious AEs in the ceftobiprole arm were mild and comparable to those in the ceftriaxone arm. the incidence of adverse events caused by ceftobiprole is similar to that of non-high-risk patients, suggesting that ceftobiprole is safe and effective for high-risk groups. the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline are established in two milestone studies. ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone in clinically evaluable (CE) and mITT population. a phase 4 multicenter study was proposed to specifically evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline in the treatment of CAP. ceftobiprole had strong activity against MSSA (100%, 100% susceptible, respectively), MRSA (98.3%, 99.3% susceptible, respectively), S. pneumoniae (99.3%, 99.7% susceptible, respectively), and the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3%, 82.5% susceptible, respectively) the potency of ceftobiprole against P. aeruginosa (64.6%, 72.7% susceptible, respectively) was similar to that of ceft the second RCT (NCT00210964) showed ceftobiprole was non-inferior to ceftazidime with or without linezolid. cure rates for VAP patients were 23.1% vs 36.8% and 37.7% vs 55.9%, suggesting that ceftobiprole was unsuitable for the treatment of VAP. Pleuromutilin Lefamulin is a potent semi-synthetic antibacterial agent. the antibacterial spectrum comprises S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, the atypical respiratory pathogens, MRSA, -haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium. lefamulin has a low incidence of drug resistance and minimal cross-resistance with other types of antibiotics, making it a new monotherapy for elderly CAP. the oral dosage form of lefamulin is under the investigation in LEAP 2 (NCT02813694), and the primary endpoint is similar to LEAP 1. lefamulin's in vitro antibacterial profile includes the most important bacterial pathogens causing LRTIs. the antibacterial spectrum comprises S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, the atypical respiratory pathogens, MRSA, -haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium. lefamulin has a low incidence of drug resistance and minimal cross-resistance with other types of antibiotics, making it a new monotherapy for elderly CAP. the oral dosage form of lefamulin is under the investigation in LEAP 2 (NCT02813694), and the primary endpoint is similar to LEAP 1. Pristinamycin is a streptococcal-type antibiotic produced by Streptomyces faecalis. it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial ribosome 50S subunit. pristinamycin has a synergistic antibacterial effect with vancomycin. pristinamycin is a broad-spectrum diaminopyrimidine antibiotic. it inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase and does not cross react with human enzyme. iclaprim is not recommended as a routine treatment for elderly HAP. telavancin and vancomycin have similar effects and similar rates of AEs. telavancin causes a higher proportion of people with elevated serum creatinine levels than vancomycin (10% vs 8%) telavancin can cause cell death by increasing membrane permeability. telavancin has mild inhibitory effect on CYP3A. it can also be used in elderly with hepatic dysfunction. but high protein binding capacity could lead to drug to drug interaction. no documented short-term animal and clinical studies have reported neuropathies or thrombocytopenia associated with tedizolid. a randomized phase 3 study of the safety and efficacy of tedizolid in comparison with linezolid in patients with HAP and VAP is currently ongoing. Iclaprim is a broad-spectrum diaminopyrimidine antibiotic that inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase and does not cross react with human enzyme. iclaprim is being developed to treat serious respiratory infections, such as hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP), attributed to multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens and cystic fibrosis caused by S. aureus. avancin was approved by the FDA in 2013 for the HAP and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) telavancin has high antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L), S. epidermidis (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L), VISA (MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L), Streptococcus (MIC90 = 0.03mg/L), and VanB protein enterococcus (MIC telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptides that is active against multidrug resistant staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci. telavancin can cause cell death by increasing membrane permeability, resulting in leakage of intracellular potassium and ATP. telavancin was no worse than vancomycin in terms of the clinical cure rate of TOC visits in both ATTAIN studies. telavancin has a dual antibacterial mechanism of action, which is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with cross-linking (transpeptidation) and polymerization. telavancin can cause cell death by increasing membrane permeability, resulting in the leakage of intracellular potassium and ATP. telavancin has mild inhibitory effect on CYP3A. no phase 3 trials assessing efficacy of tedizolid have been completed. no documented short-term animal and clinical studies have reported thrombocytopenia associated with tedizolid. the safety of tedizolid for long-term administration remains to be seen. izolid was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) in 2016. it shares many structural features with linezolid and has increased antimicrobial potency than linezolid. no phase 3 trials assessing efficacy of tedizolid have been completed. tedizolid penetration into epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and alveolar macrophages (AM) is much higher than free-drug exposures in plasma (Housman et al., 2012). in the presence of linezolid resistance or hematologic side effects, tedizolid is a better choice. double hit from an aging immune system, host defense may be impaired in diabetes together increase the risk of bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. respiratory dysfunction and microangiopathy together lead to a higher morbidity and mortality in diabetes elderly. antimicrobial pharmacotherapy for elderly with diabetes is the same as for all age groups. fluconazole or itraconazole are recommended for immunecompetent pulmonary cryptococcosis hosts. immunocompromised patients with pulmonary aspergillosis are advised to inhale glucocorticoids and bronchodilators. for elderly patients with immunodeficiency, intravenous caspofungin is recommended. ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity by inhibiting viral RNA synthesis and mRNA capping. ribavirin alone or in combination with IFN- for the treatment of SARS is inconsistent and controversial. there are still no commercial vaccines available against MERS-CoV. combinant vector vaccines (Kim et al., 2014; Gilbert and Warimwe, 2017); and DNA vaccines (Al-Amri et al., 2017; Chi et al., 2017). other agents, such as mycophenolic acid (MPA), have shown strong inhibition activity against MERS-CoV in vitro studies. passive immunotherapy using human plasma was also applied in the treatment of SARS and MERS. from 1979 to 2001, adults 65 years old accounted for 60% of influenza-related hospitalizations (Casey et al., 2010; Nicoll, 2010). from 1979 to 2001, adults 65 years old accounted for approximately 60% of influenza-related hospitalizations. neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI), including zanamivir (Heneghan et al., 2014), and peramivir (2015), are effective against both influenza A and influenza B viruses. neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI), including oseltamivir (Dobson et al., 2015), zanamivir (Heneghan et al., 2014), are effective against both influenza A and influenza B viruses. patients who have not used antibiotics can take advanced macrolides or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. patients who have used antibiotics recently can choose advanced macrolides. patients who have used antibiotics recently can choose fluoroquinolone and advanced macrolides. patients with pulmonary aspergillosis are advised to inhale glucocorticoids and bronchodilators and leukotriene receptor antagonists. immunocompromised patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis are advised to take oral fluconazole or itraconazole or intravenous amphotericin B. the efficacy of ribavirin alone or in combination with IFN- for the treatment of SARS is inconsistent and controversial. there are still no commercial vaccines available against MERS-CoV. antiviral peptides, monoclonal antibodies, cellular or viral protease inhibitor may be promising agents for vitro and/or animal models. but the efficacy in patients with SARS and MERS needs further clinical validation. the high-dose (HD) trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) was 22% more effective than SD influenza vaccine at preventing probable influenza infections. the high-dose (HD) trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) was 22% more effective than SD influenza vaccine at preventing probable influenza infections. telavancin's better bioavailability, food-independent efficacy, and simple dosing regimens make it a potential therapy for the elderly with LRTIs. all the above trials of this medicine enrolled patients over the age of 65, while this age group had not been separated into a subgroup to test the safety and efficacy of certain antibiotics. omadacycline was a novel once-daily aminomethylcycline antibiotic. it became the second tetracycline antibiotic approved by the FDA in 2018. solithromycin has little potential for the treatment of LRTIs in elderly. ceftaroline has weak antibacterial activity against E.faecium, VRE, ESBL-E, and P. aeruginosa. in FOCUS 1, 1.4% of ceftaroline patients and 1.0% of ceftriaxone patients developed QTcB prolongation, both of which were >500 ms. tedizolid is still not a FDA/EMA-approved antibiotic for the treatment of LRTIs. but it brings hope to patients suffering renal or hepatic failure. despite significant decreases in number of deaths due to LRTIs, there remains an urgent need to make efforts to reduce the burden of disease in the elderly. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
