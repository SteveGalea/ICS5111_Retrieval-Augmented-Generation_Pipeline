{"summary": "a diverse group of large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. some coVs can cause severe diseases in animals and humans. most recently, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemics in humans have sparked renewed interest in coronaviruses. myotis brandtii (M. brandtii), Myotis nattereri (M. nattereri), and Plecotus auritus (P. auritus) collected from bats in Denmark between 2013 and 2017. the limestone mines of Mnsted were chosen as sampling locations. sted Individual 5 (0) May 2016 Mnsted Individual 58 (13) September 2016 Mnsted Individual 2 (0) April 2017 Mnsted Individual 6 (0) October 2014 Mnsted Individual 2 (1) April 2015 Mnsted Individual 1 (1) November 2015 Mnsted Individual 6 (1) September 2016 Mnsted Individual 2 (2) November 2016 Mnsted Individual M. nattereri 7 (0) August\u2013September 2013 Bornholm Individual 1 (0) August 2015 Bornholm 1 individual and 1 from nest box 3 (0) August 2016 Bornholm faecal pellets were collected from individual bats using sterile tweezers. samples were taken directly from individual bats when handled or from the floor under roosting bats. faecal samples were homogenized for 1 min in 500 L Eagle\u2019s medium (in-house production) using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. RNA was extracted from 200 L of the supernatant using the MagNa Pure 96 robot. sequences were aligned with selected reference coronavirus strains approved by ICTV [13] and relevant and/or more recent European bat coronavirus sequences found by BLAST searching in the NCBI database. the sequences were aligned with selected reference coronavirus strains approved by ICTV [13], as well as relevant and/or more recent European bat coronavirus sequences found by BLAST searching in the NCBI database. cal sample containing a coronavirus very similar to the coronaviruses from M. daubentonii was selected for confirmatory species testing. faecal samples were submerged in 500 L phosphate buffered saline and nucleic acids extracted from 200 L on the MagnaPure 96 robot.

morphological features. samples were taken from bats during non-hibernating seasons. faecal samples were homogenized for 1 min in 500 L Eagle\u2019s medium (in-house production) using the TissueLyser II. centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. extracted RNA samples were screened using two independent real-time RT-PCRs. the sequences were aligned with selected reference coronavirus strains approved by ICTV [13] and relevant and/or more recent European bat coronavirus sequences found by BLAST searching in the NCBI database. the sequences were aligned with selected reference coronavirus strains approved by ICTV [13], as well as relevant and/or more recent European bat coronavirus sequences found by BLAST searching in the NCBI database. faecal sample containing a coronavirus very similar to the coronaviruses from M. daubentonii was selected for confirmatory species testing. faecal samples from five of the 10 sampled bat species tested positive for the presence of CoV RNA in screening assays. three most sampled bat species had an observed prevalence of coronavirus RNA in their faeces of around 20\u201325%. only one out of eleven samples from M. nattereri was CoV positive. a fourth sample, collected at a different location, tested negative. the majority of samples were collected during autumn (172 from M. daubentonii) due to the seasonally skewed sample collection, it was not possible to infer a seasonal pattern for the presence of coronavirus from the available data. tests of bat gender indicated slightly higher odds of coronavirus presence in females than in males. all the Danish M. daubentonii CoV sequences are closely related (>95% nt identity, maximum 9 nt differences), or identical. the latter sequence has only 3 nt differences from the Danish M. dasycneme derived sequence and a maximum of 9 nt differences compared to any of the Danish CoV sequences in the cluster. the single Danish CoV sequence from E. serotinus does not cluster with any of the other Danish virus sequences. the tree was constructed based on sequenced RT-PCR amplicons from the screening assay C (208 bp without primer sequence [11]). the minimum bootstrap value was set to 50. the closest related sequence in the NCBI database is from Kenya (HQ728480), with 20 nt differences. samples from other species of bats tested negative in assay A, so no products were available for sequencing. the d PCR products generated with the mitochondrial 16S-gene specific assay were most similar to reference sequences from M. fimbriatus and M. pilosus. for the cytochrome B gene-specific assay, the lowest E-value was found for M. dasycneme. five different aa sequences were found for the short B assay amplicons. the sequences had 4\u201310 aa differences between each other. the coVs from E. serotinus, M. nattereri and M. daubentonii had two. three most sampled bat species had an observed prevalence of coronavirus RNA in their faeces of around 20\u201325%. only one out of eleven samples from a maternity colony of E. serotinus proved positive in the CoV screening. the majority of samples were collected during autumn (172 from M. daubentonii) due to the seasonally skewed sample collection, it was not possible to infer a seasonal pattern for the presence of virus from the available data. it is not possible to infer a seasonal, year, or gender specific pattern from these sparse samples, as they were collected from different species and from different geographical locations. all the Danish M. daubentonii CoV sequences are closely related (>95% nt identity, maximum 9 nt differences), or identical, and form a single cluster within the tree. outside of this cluster, branching from an unresolved node, are two other Danish CoV sequences from P. pygmaeus and M. nattereri. the three remaining Danish M. dasycneme virus sequences are identical. their closest reference sequence is from a Myotis emarginatus in 2016. the other available Danish P. pygmaeus CoV sequence is most closely related to a sequence from a Pipistrellus kuhlii specimen in Italy from 2010. the closest related sequence in the NCBI database is from Kenya (HQ728480), with 20 nt differences. the sample no. 18799-20 was confirmed to be from the species M. dasycneme on the basis of BLASTn searches of the sequenced PCR products from both assays. the PCR products generated with the mitochondrial 16S-gene specific assay were most similar to reference sequences from M. fimbriatus and M. pilosus. the predicted aa sequences from all of the M. daubentonii samples were identical as the nt sequences within each assay only had synonymous nt differences. the sequences had 4\u201310 aa differences between each other, with the coVs from E. serotinus, M. nattereri and M. daubentonii each having one distinct aa sequence. the average prevalence, at around 20%, is high in comparison with other European studies reporting prevalences of 9.8% [18], 4.2% [21] and 1.8% [22]. this could possibly be due to the testing strategy employed, with two different, sensitive screening assays. nt sequencing revealed distinct CoV sequences to be present within each of the five bat species, indicating specific CoVs are, at least predominantly, restricted to individual host species. aa motifs in the ORF1ab encoded RNA polymerase gene of the SARS coronavirus were inferred by comparison. the region targeted by RT-PCR assay C encodes 69 aa. the ends of this region contain conserved motifs, but there are no internal conserved motifs. the nt sequences also function as a tool for establishing the genus of the coronaviruses detected. the two other P. pygmaeus collection sites, at Borup and Sollerup, are more than 100 km apart and separated by a large stretch of water (Storeblt) the coronavirus present in the positive sample from E. serotinus could only be detected using the screening assays. phylogenetic analysis shows a close resemblance between the Danish M. daubentonii bat CoVs and CoVs from the same bat species in more recent research indicates that the distinction between these categories is not so sharp [33] of the several hundred bats ringed in the Danish limestone mines in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s [34] none have been recaptured in northern Germany and likewise, bats ringed in northern Germany have, to the knowledge of the authors, hardly ever been found in the Danish limestone mines. in the active part of the year, many bats often roost together, in hollow trees, enabling faecal-oral transmission of viruses. in the active part of the year, many bats often roost together, in confined spaces in hollow trees, enabling faecal-oral transmission of viruses. in the active part of the year, many bats often roost together, in confined spaces in hollow trees. the majority of the samples from these species were collected on the island of Bornholm. none tested positive for coronavirus RNA; coVs were detected in samples from each of the three major geographical regions of Denmark."}
