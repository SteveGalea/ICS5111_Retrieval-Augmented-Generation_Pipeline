{"summary": "KSHV is a 2-herpesvirus that has been directly linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) this virus is closely related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), murine gammaherpesvirus-68, and herpesvirus saimiri [2]. a zinc-finger gene family includes Egr-2, Egr-3, Egr-4, and the Wilms tumor suppressor. Egr-1 mediates the effect of TPA activation and is a downstream target of MAPK signaling. despite the ability of Egr-1 to bind to ORF50P, there is little information available. EMSA experiments were performed using 8 different DIG-labeled probes. IVT of egr-1/pcDNA3.1(+) construct yielded a protein of roughly 78 kda. of all the probes tested, IVT-synthesized Egr-1 proteins bind and form separate protein:DNA complexes with the ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 probes. EMSA studies were performed using IVT-synthesized Egr-1. Egr-1 binds to ORF50P probes. EMSA experiments were performed using wt ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 probes. corresponding probes showed mutations in the putative Egr-1 binding domain. arrowhead indicates protein/DNA complex formation. wt probes with Egr-1 were formed producing separate band shifts. a supershift occurred exhibiting a discrete band when nuclear lysates were pre-treated with Egr-1 specific Abs. a semi-quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using the nuclear extract from KSHV-infected cells. TPA-induced KSHV-infected cells were used to assess binding ability of Egr-1 to ORF50P via ChIP assays. recruitment of Egr-1 to the nonspecific ORF50NP region was not detectable in our experiments. positive controls using specific Abs to histone proteins recovered ORF50P targets. the nucleotide locations correspond to the old KSHV genome sequence NC_003409. luciferase reporter constructs were used to investigate the necessity of ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 during Egr. luciferase activity was significantly greater in cells transfected with constructs encoding full length ORF50P. luciferase activity was never completely abolished, suggesting the need for an intact ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 for optimal Egr-1-induced transcription of ORF50. KSHV-infected HEK293 cells were used to evaluate expression pattern of Egr-1 and KSHV RTA. expression of Egr-1 and RTA proteins was significantly elevated by 1 hour post infection. a significant decrease in expression of these proteins was observed from 12\u201348 hPI. mRNA extracted from HEK293 cells was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis in order to evaluate egr-1 and ORF50 transcriptional activity. uninfected cells (0 hPI) did not show detectable ORF50 expression. a low baseline level of egr-1 expression was observed in the uninfected samples. qRT-PCR studies were performed to identify changes in egr-1 and ORF50 gene expression. levels of egr-1 were significantly increased in cells transfected with egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+) over controls. peak expression for both genes was observed by 48 h post transfection. RNA was extracted, cDNA was synthesized, and expression of cellular egr-1. KSHV-infected cells were untransfected, mock-transfected, transfected for 48 h. each group of cells was left untreated or treated with 10 M of U0126 1 h prior to transfection. target cells transfected with empty vectors showed low levels of ORF59 expression. but transfection cells with egr-1/pcDNA3.1(+) augmented level of ORF59 protein expression in KSHV-infected cells. we analyzed MAPK signaling in the above cells. resveratrol inhibits Egr-1 and ORF50 during early and late stages of infection due to the vital role of MAPK signaling on Egr-1 expression and KSHV reactivation. resveratrol inhibits ERK1/2 activity in virus-infected cells. resveratrol inhibits ERK1/2 activity in virus-infected cells. resveratrol inhibited egr-1 expression by as early as 6 hPI in HEK293 cells. hek293 cells were mock-infected with 5 MOI of KSHV for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after infection, the cells were washed and cultured in growth medium in the presence or absence of different concentrations of resveratrol for 4 h. the cells were lysed using gold lysis buffer (GLB) and the lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using specific antibodies. the results were confirmed by the conventional trypan blue test. more than 95% of the target cells were found to be viable. uninduced cells transfected with vectors encoding egr-1, and (ii) TPA-induced KSHV reactivation in BCBL-1 cells by performing qRT-PCR. results clearly demonstrate the ability of RDS to lower the expression of both egr-1 and ORF50 under both circumstances. RNA was extracted, cDNA synthesized, and egr-1 and KSHV ORF50 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. each point denotes the averageS.D. (error bars) of three experiments. the cells were further treated using unfiltered RDS containing 100 M of resveratrol and incubated for 6 h. PCR experiments were performed using samples from 1% input DNA and IP samples in order to determine the expression of ORF50P8. cDNA at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cycles were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. the sequence for ORF50P3 is the same for the probe used in earlier study [6]. band shifts were not observed when ORF50P probes were incubated with IVT-synthesized KSHV glycoprotein L (gL) experiments using the ORF50PNP probe did not form a complex with Egr-1 protein. EMSA studies were performed using IVT-synthesized Egr-1 products and DIG-labeled ORF50P probes. mutations in the putative Egr-1 binding domain inhibit binding. arrowhead indicates protein/DNA complex formation. a second set of EMSA studies were conducted using ORF50P probes carrying mutations in the putative Egr-1 binding region. samples consisting of wildtype (wt) or mutated probes alone did not display a shift in the respective probes. Egr-1 binding to ORF50P was confirmed by incubating lysates with specific Abs and performing a supershift. a supershift occurred exhibiting a discrete band when nuclear lysates were pre-treated with Egr-1 specific Abs. these experiments provide support for the ability of Egr-1 to specifically bind to two separate locations on KSHV ORF50P. BCBL-1 cells were synchronized in S phase [28] and treated with 20 ng/ml of TPA for 8 h. cDNA at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cycles were removed and resolved. IP of BCBL-1 DNA using specific antibodies to histone H3 was used as positive controls. luciferase activation of pGL3 by egr-1/pcDNA3.1(+) was represented as 1-fold. each point denotes the average SD of three experiments. columns with different alphabets are statistically significant (P0.05) by least significant difference (LSD) the absence of ORF50P3 contributed to a decrease in luciferase activity. this activity was never completely abolished suggesting the need for an intact ORF50P3 and ORF50P8. these results suggest a role for Egr-1 to specifically bind and activate ORF50P to trigger a lytic infection. expression of KSHV RTA and Egr-1 were elevated up to 6 hPI. Western blotting was performed using specific Egr-1 or KSHV RTA Abs. Abs targeting -actin were used as internal controls. elevated egr-1 expression coincides with an increase in KSHV ORF50 transcription. qRT-PCR studies were performed to identify changes in egr-1 and ORF50 transcription in target cells. Elevated Egr-1 was observed in cells transfected with egr-1/pcDNA3.1. cells to be used as controls were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. cells to be used as controls were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. each group of cells was transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) or egr-1/pcDNA3.1(+) for 48 h. each cell was left untreated or treated with 10 M of U0126 1 h prior to transfection. lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane. treatment of infected cells with known inhibitor of MEK1/2 significantly lowered expression levels of Egr-1 and ERK1/2 activity. inhibition of ERK1/2 activity and Egr-1 levels was greatest following treatment of infected cells with 10 M of U0126. effect of resveratrol on early stages of infection was analyzed in HEK293 cells. its effect on late stages (reactivation using TPA) was analyzed predominantly in BCBl-1 cells. the doses tested in this study were confirmed by trypan blue test to be non-toxic to cells. HEK293 cells were mock-infected or infected with 5 MOI of KSHV for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after infection, the cells were washed and cultured in growth medium. at the end of incubation, the cells were lysed, RNA was extracted, cDNA was synthesized, and egr-1 levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. each point denotes the averageS.D. (error bars) of unfiltered RDS successfully inhibited phospho-ERK1/2, Egr-1, and RTA expression in TPA-induced KSHV-infected cells. a slightly lesser inhibitory effect was observed in cells treated with RDS that had particulates removed using a 0.2 m filter. veratrol in its chemical form and RDS may lower Egr-1 and KSHV RTA expression. each group of cells was left untreated or further treated using filtered or unfiltered RDS containing 100 M of resveratrol. each group was left untreated or was further treated using filtered or unfiltered RDS containing 100 M of resveratrol. each point denotes the averageS.D. (error bars) of three experiments. RDS inhibits the ability of Egr-1 to bind KSHV ORF50 in vivo. results from using the ChIP assay show that Egr-1 may bind ORF50P with a greater affinity at positions between 100 \u2013 76 bp (ORF50P8) compared to 2173 \u2013 2149 bp (ORF50P3). however, we did not observe any such differences in binding affinity of Egr-1 to ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 by EMSA using IVT Egr-1. transfection of cells with egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+) resulted in a significant increase in virus-encoded ORF50 transcription followed by the expression of early-lytic ORF59 protein and late-lytic gene (ORF8) encoding gB. all of which are indicators of an active lytic replication of KSHV [12], [28], [29]. resveratrol, in its chemical form, inhibits Egr-1 and phospho-ERK1/2 in KSHV-infected cells. the decrease in expression of RTA by RDS coincided with a sharp decline in the ability of Egr-1 to bind ORF50P. resveratrol has also been shown to induce virus replication. resveratrol significantly lowers phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (directly upstream of Egr-1) in target cells. further research is required to confirm if this ability of RDS to promote viral latency is by its direct inhibitory effect on the expression Egr-1 or the upstream MAPK signaling component(s) 293 cells and BCBL-1 cells were cultured in DMEM and RPMI. mouse antibodies to ORF59 were used in this study. mouse antibodies to phospho-ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, actin, and Egr-1 were used. IVT of egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+) and gL/pCDNA3.1(+) was conducted as per earlier studies [45] using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) Primary infection of HEK293 cells HEK293 cells were infected as per earlier procedures (25) cells were washed in PBS, mounted by using an anti-fade reagent containing DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular Probes) and examined under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters. EMSA IVT products of Egr-1 or KSHV gL were evaluated for DNA binding using several 25 bp digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled probes containing sequences from the ORF50P ase activity to control Renilla luciferase activity was plotted as a percentage of the activity of the empty pGL3 vector. cross-linked cells were washed in 1 PBS and counted to collect chromatin.
