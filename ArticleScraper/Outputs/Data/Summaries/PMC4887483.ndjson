{"summary": "renal proximal tubular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activated in pathogenic states such as diabetic nephropathy. enhanced generation of vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin (Ang) II contributes to progressive nephron injury. proximal tubule expresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 cleavage in mouse proximal tubular cells in conditions of high glucose involves activation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), a zinc-dependent protease known as tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme (TACE) cleavage by ADAM17 has also been demonstrated in cultured HEK293, HK-2 proximal tubular, Huh7, COS7, and human respiratory epithelial cells ectodomain shedding of proteins may be regulated by several stimuli, including protein kinase C (PKC), calcium ionophores, G-protein-coupled receptors, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. however, constitutive (basal) shedding of ACE2 from proximal tubular cells is not affected by inhibition of ADAM17. cells were grown in a defined medium of DMEM-F12 (1:1), supplemented with insulin (5 g/ml), transferrin (5 g/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (50 nM), 3,3\u2032,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (2.5 nM), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum media was centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to remove dead cells and cellular debris. cell media (15 L) was then added to the wells of a 96-well plate. samples were protected from light and incubated for 16 h on a plate shaker. proximal tubular cells were prepared in a buffer consisting of 31.3 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% wt/vol SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, and 0.025% wt/vol bromophenol blue. 20 microliter of concentrated media (20-fold concentrate) was run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. siRNA was added to 250 l Opti-MEM\u00aeI Reduced Serum Medium. the siRNA-LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX complexes were then added to 35-mm culture dishes containing primary cultures of mouse proximal tubular cells. ACE2 activity was assayed in the cell culture medium. cleotides were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) all vehicle controls with use of inhibitors consisted of cells exposed to an equivalent amount of DMSO (0.05%). in preliminary experiments, cells were exposed to an equivalent amount of DMSO (0.05%). cells were switched to a serum-free medium, with D-glucose concentration for most experiments set at 7.8 mM. after 24 h, cells reached 70% confluence and had a typical epithelial cell morphology. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2/room air. mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 0.75 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 11.25 M ACE2 substrate, with or without 1 M of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760. ACE2 activity in the culture medium was corrected for the cell protein amounts on the culture dishes. twenty-five microliters of concentrated media (20-fold concentrate) was run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. mouse shed ACE2 fragments by mass spectrometry (1.5\u201310 g protein) mice kidney cortex lysates were used as controls. ACE2 activity was assayed in the cell culture medium. materials D-glucose and L-glucose were obtained from Sigma. the ADAM17 inhibitor, TNF- Protease Inhibitor-1, was from Calbiochem. concentration-dependent effect of D-glucose on ACE2 shedding in mouse proximal tubular cells. after 72 h ACE2 activity in the media rose progressively with increasing concentrations of D-glucose in the media. this effect was significant at the basal level of 7.8 mM D-glucose (compared to 0 mM D-glucose), and peaked at 16 mM D-glucose. representative immunoblot shows ACE2 fragments at 90 and 70 kDa. mouse kidney cortex ACE2 at 100 kDa. effects of PKC inhibition on Constitutive ACE2 Shedding. Graph depicts effect of varying concentrations of sotrastaurin on ACE2 shedding into culture media, determined by immunoblot analysis. neither the PKC- and -1 inhibitor Go6976, nor the PKC-1 and -2 inhibitor ruboxistaurin had any effect on ACE2 shedding. ADAM10 inhibitor GI250423X did not affect ACE2 shedding from proximal tubular cells in 7.8 mM D-glucose. lack of inhibitory effect of the PKC- and -1 inhibitor Go6976 (A) and the PKC-1 and -2 inhibitor ruboxistaurin (B) on constitutive ACE2 shedding in mouse proximal tubular cells. incubation of cells in high glucose induced no significant difference in total cell lysate expression of PKC- compared to normal glucose. the ADAM17 antagonist TAPI-1 had no effect on ACE2 shedding in 7.8 mM D-glucose, but inhibited high glucose-mediated ACE2 shedding in mouse proximal tubular cells. RNA silencing was used to further study the role of PKC- in ACE2 shedding. in mouse proximal tubular cells grown in 7.8 mM D-glucose, silencing of mRNA for PKC- was associated with a modest reduction in protein expression of PKC-. this caused a significant (20%) decrease in ACE2 activity in the culture media. Graph depicts effect of transfection of siRNA against PKC- (30 nM) on ACE2 activity in cell culture media. results are depicted as ACE2 activity relative to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA sequence. Graph depicts effect of varying concentrations of D- or L-glucose on ACE2 activity recovered from cell culture media. P 0.01 vs. 0, 2, 4, and 7.8 mM D-glucose; P 0.01 vs. 0 mM D-glucose; n = 4\u20135. sotrastaurin (10-5 M) completely inhibited ACE2 shedding under conditions of high D-glucose (28 mM), with or without TAPI-1. administration of the activator of PKC, PMA (10-7 or 10-6 M) for 30 min increased ACE2 activity in the cell culture media by 192 and 209%, respectively. in D-glucose 28 mM, P 0.001 vs. Control and TAPI-1, P 0.05 vs. Control; P 0.001 vs. Control (D-glucose 7.8 mM); n = 4\u20135. In contrast to sotrastaurin, neither the PKC- and -1 inhibitor Go6976 nor the PKC-1 and -2 inhibitor ruboxistaurin had any effect on ACE2 shedding in cells incubated rottlerin significantly inhibited shedding of ACE2 fragments, as determined by enzyme activity assay and immunoblots. in separate experiments, incubation of cells in high glucose induced no significant difference in total cell lysate expression of PKC-, compared to normal glucose. rottlerin reduced constitutive and high D-glucose-induced ACE2 shedding in mouse proximal tubular cells. representative immunoblot depicts effect of rottlerin (1 M), with or without the ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-1 (10-5 M), on ACE2 activity in the culture media. RNA silencing was used to further study the role of PKC- in ACE2 shedding. in mouse proximal tubular cells grown in 7.8 mM D-glucose, silencing of mRNA for PKC- was associated with a modest reduction in protein expression of PKC results are depicted as PKC- protein relative to cells transfected with scrambled siRNA sequence. Representative immunoblot is shown above graph, with PKC- at 78 kDa, and -tubulin loading control at 50 kDa. results are depicted as ACE2 activity relative to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA sequence. no effect on basal ACE2 shedding (7.8 mM D-glucose), but inhibited high glucose-stimulated shedding (28 mM D-glucose). the results suggest that PKC- is an upstream regulator of ACE2 shedding in proximal tubular cells, and is linked to downstream activation of ADAM17 in high glucose. the mechanism for enhanced urinary ACE2 shedding in diabetes appears to involve activation of the sheddase ADAM17. in cultured proximal tubular cells, ADAM17 activity is increased by exposure to high glucose. restoration of normoglycemia inhibits renal ADAM17 expression and reduces urinary ACE2 shedding. expressing silencing RNA constructs against endogenous ADAM17 was associated with reduced constitutive shedding of the larger of the two soluble ACE2 fragments. this effect was rescued by reconstitution of ADAM17 in these cells. these studies highlight complexity of pathways involved in proteolytic cleavage of ACE2. a modest 30% reduction in its protein expression induced a significant decrease in constitutive ACE2 shedding. knockdown of PKC- had no effect on shedding. these results support a unique role for PKC- in constitutive ACE2 shedding in these cells. inhibition of PKC- in mouse proximal tubular cells reduces constitutive proteolytic shedding of ACE2 and blocks high glucose- or ADAM17-stimulated ACE2 shedding. the data suggest that PKC- is a critical upstream regulator of ACE2 shedding in these cells. absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
