{"summary": "the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused at least 2,040 human infections and 712 deaths worldwide. unlike most other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV has a zoonotic origin. these characteristics are reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a large outbreak of human infections in 2003. non-human primates have been successfully infected, with rhesus macaques displaying a mild, transient illness and marmosets demonstrating a more severe and sometimes lethal infection. the expense and care of camels and the ethical concerns surrounding the use of non-human primates limits their widespread utility for research studies. viral RNA titers were measured by qRT-PCR using primer pairs targeting the nucleocapsid protein (N3) and are reported as genome equivalent per gram of tissue [30], as we found this method to be more sensitive and less variable than recovering infectious virus from infected rabbit tissues. rabbits were inoculated intranasally with EMC/2012 strain of MERS-CoV. the higher dose of virus resulted in greater mean genome equivalent titers than infection with the lower dose of MERS-CoV. 105 TCID50 inoculum resulted in significantly higher titers than infection with 103 TCID50 of virus on days 1 and 3 post-infection. images at 10x (bar equivalent to 100m) with 40x insets (bar equivalent to 20m) images shown are from day 3 post-infection for all groups. rabbits were inoculated with 106.5 TCID50 of EMC/2012. titers in the lung were sustained until day 5, then dropped to almost baseline levels by day 10. the peak in viral titers occurs at day 3 post-infection, with higher titers observed following infection with 105 or 106.5 TCID50 of virus. neither anti-S nor anti-N protein antibodies provide protection from reinfection. viral RNA titers were lower compared to the 103//105 TCID50 and 105 TCID50 primary infection groups. mean titers were 102.9, 103.7, and 104 TCID50 eq per gram of tissue respectively. images show H&E and IHC for the MERS-CoV N protein. the rabbits in the 103//105 TCID50 group had antigen levels comparable to primary infection. the 105//105 TCID50 group had lower antigen levels by IHC. low titers of non-neutralizing antibodies do not protect rabbits from reinfection. a significant decrease in viral RNA was observed in both the 105//105//105 TCID50 group and the 103//105//105 TCID50 group compared to primary infection. titers of 101.9, 102.6, and 104.5 TCID50 eq per gram of tissue respectively. this decrease in viral load was also observed by IHC. lenge serum neutralizing antibody titers inversely correlated with viral RNA titers following tertiary infection. non-neutralizing antibodies mediate enhanced inflammation following reinfection. ELISA antibodies against the S protein were barely detectable in the serum. rabbits that received the undiluted passively transferred (PT) serum showed immunopathology similar to that observed in previously infected rabbits. pathology in rabbits that were infected after PT of post-infection serum was milder than in other reinfection studies. qRT-PCR or IHC was used to examine the replication of MERS-CoV in macrophages. sera from nave rabbits (week 0), week 8 following primary infection (only non-neutralizing antibodies present) and week 13 following secondary infection (neutralizing antibodies present) were tested at three dilutions. ELISA against rabbit complement protein C3a showed an increase in C3a levels during reinfection compared to primary infection (p = 0.02) this increase was significant for the 103//105 group compared to primary infection. a substantial increase in the number of CD3+ T cells in the lung compared to primary infection (Fig 9A and 9B) these T cells were distributed in the same areas as virus antigen, mostly in the areas immediately surrounding vessels and airways (Fig 9C). Attempts to further characterize the CD3+ cells were unsuccessful. three rabbits were necropsied at each time point. numbers indicate days since virus administration for primary, or [tertiary] infections. viral RNA titers were determined in the nasal turbinates (A) and lungs (B) of rabbits following infection with either 103 or 105 TCID50 of MERS-CoV through day 5 after infection. the cellular infiltrate was composed of eosinophils and macrophages. inflammation was not observed following infection with 103 TCID50 of virus or in media-only controls (Fig 3B and 3C and S1 and S3 Tables) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were detected by IgG ELISA in two rabbits previously inoculated with 105 TCID50 and one rabbit with 103 TCID50. but neutralizing antibodies were not detected in rabbits inoculated with any dose (103, 105, or 106.5) of EMC/2012. 105 and 106.5 TCID50 doses gave similar results, the 105 TCID50 dose was chosen for the remaining studies. qRT-PCR confirmed infection with MERS-CoV that failed to elicit either a neutralizing antibody response, or any detectable antibody response against the virus. TCID50 reinfection group (B,E) and 105//105 TCID50 reinfection group (C,F) showed that the observed inflammation was not residual from the primary infection (D,G) n = 3 rabbits per group, images at 10x, (bar equivalent to 100m) with 40x inset (bar equivalent to 20m) images from day 3 post-infection. the 103//105 TCID50 group had lower neutralizing titers than the 105//105 TCID50 group. the titer in one rabbit in the 103//105 TCID50 group dropped below detection limit by five weeks post-infection. images show H&E staining (B) and IHC with an antibody against the MERS-CoV N protein (C) in the 105//105//105 TCID50 group. images are representative of all rabbits following tertiary infection. ELISA antibodies against the S protein were barely detectable in the serum. the serum was concentrated ten-fold prior to administration. titers of non-neutralizing antibodies were present in the transferred serum. the pathology in the rabbits that were infected after PT of post-infection serum was milder than in other reinfection studies. increased complement activation is associated with enhanced inflammation Non-neutralizing antibodies typically enhance inflammation during an immune response through interactions with Fc or complement receptors. a positive control (Fig 7A) and Raji cells were included as a negative control. addition of rabbit sera produced no enhancement of viral replication. in the presence of rabbit sera, there was a significant decrease in viral replication in THP-1 cells compared to titers in the absence of rabbit serum. immunofluorescence images show MERS-CoV N antigen (green) and complement (red) following secondary infection (B) and primary infection (C). images from day 3 post-infection at 40x, bar equivalent to 20m. n = 3 rabbits per group. rabbit infection model is the only model of MERS-CoV infection in which non-neutralizing antibodies are exclusively elicited following primary infection. this is likely a consequence of different routes of inoculation. this is likely a consequence of different routes of inoculation. in rabbits, the highest mean viral RNA levels were observed in the lower respiratory tract. a direct correlation was observed between the distribution and amount of viral antigen and inflammation in the lungs of the rabbits. there was no evidence of parasitic or fungal infection in the rabbits. rabbits lack any discernible clinical signs of infection. increased inflammation and congestion in the lungs could be explained by factors. the presence of CD3+ T cells in the same regions of the lung as MERS-CoV N antigen during reinfection is consistent with this scenario. antibody-mediated protection has also been exhibited in rabbits and mice following prophylaxis with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the MERS-CoV spike protein. primary infection in rabbits produces an immune response without overt clinical symptoms. secondary infection acts as a \u201cbooster\u201d, activating the memory response elicited by the primary infection. additional vaccine doses may be needed if neutralizing antibody titers wane rapidly. male new Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized with a combination of intramuscular dexmedetomidine and isoflurane inhalation. rabbits were monitored daily for 14 days after infection for clinical signs of disease including temperature, weight, lethargy, ocular discharge, rhinitis, labored breathing.
