{"summary": "monkeypox outbreaks are sporadic and affect a small number of patients. the animal rule allows the use of animal models of monkeypox or smallpox to link antiviral efficacy to clinical outcome in lieu of human clinical trials. [18F]-FDG-PET imaging has been used for elucidating the host immune response and patterns of inflammation of various infectious diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and influenza (10\u201314). few studies have been performed to identify biomarkers for monitoring infections using in vivo imaging. antibody titers were in the same range (1:500 to 1:600) for the three treated NHPs and the untreated survivor and peaked on day 16 p.i. mean day of peak lesion counts 12 10 (n = 1; survivor) Mean day of peak viremia 8 2 (n = 2)a Mean peak viremia 3.3 7.96a Mean day of fever onset 1 2 Range of peak temp (\u00b0C) 40\u201340.7 39.2\u201339.5 Mean day of peak antibody response 16 16 (n = 1; survivor) Mean peak antibody titer (serum dilution)b 500 500 (n = 1; survivor) surviving NHPs showed significantly higher uptake (P 0.01) of [18F]-FDG in BM (SUVmean = 9.33 2.29; n = 2) than surviving NHPs (SUV = 5.63 0.97; n = 4; Fig. 1B and C) representative [18F]-FDG-PET images fused with corresponding CT images of one moribund NHP (UNTR-1) and one untreated survivor (UNTR-2) on days 4 preexposure and +4 p.i. VOIs were drawn around the manubrium marked by white arrows on the images in the coronal view. each data point represents one scan on one of six animals on 1 of 18 imaging days. three preinfection imaging sessions were performed per NHP. analysis of fused PET and CT images showed that MPXV infection induced an increase in [18F]-FDG uptake in LNs and lymphadenopathy in all six NHPs. axillary LN over time were measured by CT images in moribund and CDV-treated and untreated surviving NHPs. Survivors did not show increase in [18F]-FDG uptake until day 8. the high [18F]-FDG uptake on day 4 p.i. in the moribund untreated NHP (UNTR-1) was not detected in the untreated surviving NHP (UNTR-2) that was scanned on the same day (Fig. 2E and F) similar patterns of changes in [18F]-FDG uptake in the LNs were observed irrespective of the timing of the scans. al LN did not significantly alter the overall response of the remaining LNs. changes in [18F]-FDG uptake during MPXV infection of NHPs in LNs at different locations. compared [18F]-FDG uptake in axillary LNs to histopathological and immunological changes in inguinal LN tissues. results from immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody against Ki-67 identified proliferating cells in LNs from surviving CDV-treated. ocytosis with large proliferating B cells was also detected in nonsurvivors. the distinguishing characteristic of LNs among survivors at day 9 p.i. was uniform proliferation of T cells and B cells. concurrent depletion of B cells and histiocytes and limited proliferation of lymphocytes in LNs were noted. the increase in Ki-67-positive cells in LNs was mirrored in the PBMC population with a small increase in proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ cells (9 to 12%) on day 8 p.i. in surviving animals. only UNTR-2 demonstrated strong B-cell proliferation (approximately 40% of cells were Ki-67-positive on day 8 p.i.) monkeypox virus (MPXV) intravenous (IV) challenge study and treatment with CDV in treated and untreated survivors versus moribund NHPs. two NHPs in the untreated control group met clinical endpoint criteria (UNTR-1, UNTR-3), and one survived. CDV-1 Survived 20, 12, 5 1, 3, 8, 10, 16, 22 CDV-2 Survived 20, 12, 5 1, 3, 8, 10, 16, 22 UNTR-1 Became moribund (day 7) 19, 11, 4 2, 4, (7)c UNTR-2 Survived 19, 11, 4 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 22 UNTR-3 Became moribund (day 7) 19, 11, 4 2, 4, (7)c UNTR-2 Survived 19, 11, 4 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 22 UNTR-3 Became mo b Titers were determined as the inverse of the serum dilution with 50% plaque reduction. moribund subjects had significantly higher [18F]-FDG uptake in bone marrow. moribund NHPs demonstrated significantly higher uptake (P 0.01) of [18F]-FDG in BM (SUVmean = 9.33 2.29; n = 2) than surviving NHPs (SUV = 5.63 0.97; n = 4; Fig. 1B and C) the correlation was determined using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient exposure. BM [18F]-FDG uptake correlated with the WBC counts throughout the course of disease (r = 0.52; P = 0.0002) but not with red blood cell (RBC) counts. in untreated survivors, [18F]-FDG uptake in LNs gradually increased 4- to 9-fold. LN volumes increased 3- to 4-fold and peaked on day 10 p.i.. duration of lymphadenopathy was longer and more pronounced. axillary LNs fused with corresponding CT images of one moribund NHP (UNTR-1) (E), one untreated survivor (UNTR-2) (F), and one treated survivor (CDV-1) (G) at the indicated days pre- or postinoculation. surviving NHPs did not show increase in [18F]-FDG uptake until day 8 p.i. the [18F]-FDG uptake pattern for the LNs in axillary and inguinal areas followed the same trend during MPXV infection irrespective of LN location. the smaller LNs responded less strongly to viral infection. s on select days in one moribund NHP (UNTR-1) and one survivor (UNTR-2) abbreviations: [18F]-FDG, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose; LN, lymph node; MPXV, monkeypox virus; mSUVthr, modified SUVthreshold; UNTR, untreated. results from immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody against Ki-67 identified proliferating cells in LNs from surviving CDV-treated and untreated moribund. T and B cells were identified with antibodies against CD4, CD8 or CD20 and were in the expected anatomical locations for these cell types. on day 19 preexposure, LN biopsy samples from both survivors and nonsurviving subjects demonstrated limited proliferation of B and T cells in cortical follicles and the paracortex. the red oval shows Ki-67-positive proliferating B cells in the sinus. areas of follicle, paracortex, and subcapsular sinus were scored. the red oval shows Ki-67-positive proliferating B cells in the sinus. psies of surviving NHPs on day 9 p.i. confirmed the increase in proliferation of lymphocytes (e.g., CD4+, CD8+, and B cells) only UNTR-2 demonstrated strong B-cell proliferation (approximately 40% of cells were Ki-67-positive on day 8 p.i.) that lasted into the recovery period. the baseline BM [18F]-FDG uptake in healthy animals was moderate. only the two animals that would eventually meet moribund endpoint criteria demonstrated a substantial increase in [18F]-FDG uptake. increased BM [18F]-FDG uptake has been directly correlated with neutrophil mobilization in cancer patients (18, 19) lymphadenopathy can be an indication of a pathological process within the lymph node. all NHPs treated with CDV showed a gradual elevation in LN volume that correlated with an increase in [18F]-FDG uptake that peaked on day 10 p.i. the high [18F]-FDG uptake on day 4 p.i. was observed only in the two subjects that would become moribund and occurred without significant lymphadenopathy. additional testing could confirm which cell subsets are ultimately responsible for [18F]-FDG uptake at key time points in MPXV infection in moribund subjects. the main differences in [18F]-FDG patterns in BM and LNs were observed in surviving versus moribund subjects. larger animal numbers are required to confirm that the observed [18F]-FDG uptake patterns in LN and BM have predictive value for determining the outcome of disease. monkeypox virus (MPXV) Zaire 79 strain (V-79-I-005) was propagated in vero E6 cells. to prepare inoculum, vero cells were disrupted with a VCX-750 ultrasonic processor. animals were intubated and placed on isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (1 to 4%, to effect) in oxygen. animals were injected IM with either ketamine or a tiletamine and zolazepam combination (3 to 6 mg/kg) three of six rhesus macaques were treated IV with CDV (Gilead, Foster City, CA) at 5 mg/ml/kg of body weight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gilead Sciences), a dose that was shown to be effective against monkeypox (17). three animals comprise the untreated control group. CT images were acquired with settings of a 120 kV peak, 5 mA, 1.25-mm scan thickness for 190 slices with 0.49 by 0.49 mm2 in-plane resolution. VOIs for BM from the manubrium and body of one thoracic vertebra were drawn on CT images and transferred to PET images. data were collected on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by FlowJo 9.3.1 software (TreeStar, Inc., Ashland, OR) or by BD FACSDiva software. inguinal LNs were collected by excisional biopsy from the right side of healthy subjects on day 19 or 20 preexposure. two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to explore whether the pattern of changes in [18F]-FDG uptake could predict disease outcome. the goal was to examine the difference in SUVs (the dependent variable) either by time and survival status or by time and treatment application. six male rhesus macaques were screened to be seronegative for simian retrovirus, simian T cell leukemia, simian immunodeficiency virus, vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and MPXV. all experimental procedures were approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. animals were intubated and placed on isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (1 to 4%, to effect) in oxygen. animals were injected IM with either ketamine or a tiletamine and zolazepam combination. three of six rhesus macaques were treated IV with CDV. three animals comprise the untreated control group. CDV was administered IV on day 1 preexposure and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13 p.i. (17) VOIs for LN were drawn on CT images and transferred to PET images. the modified SUV threshold (mSUVthr) was calculated by averaging the voxels in the PET images with SUVs above 50% of the maximum value inside the LN VOI (8). the strongest immune response in LNs was expected based on results from a previous study (20). tissue samples were collected from all major organs, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 5-m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) post hoc comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni test. correlation between changes in BM SUVs and complete blood cells with differential was calculated using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient."}
