{"summary": "ADEM is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) it produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter. most of these disorders are thought to be caused by immune system dysregulation triggered by an infectious or other environmental agent. measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination are most often associated with postvaccination ADEM. the pathogenesis of ADEM is incompletely understood. pediatric MS, defined as onset of MS before the age of 16 is being increasingly recognized. most common neurologic features of ADEM include long tract (pyramidal tract) signs, acute hemiparesis, cerebellar ataxia, cranial neuropathies, including optic neuritis. inflammation of the optic disc may be seen by direct funduscopic examination. acute inflammation and demyelination in a critical area of the brain, optic nerves, or spinal cord can induce a corresponding neurologic deficit. there are no clinical signs that are unique to this disorder. common symptoms of MS are listed in Table 220. the MRI abnormalities seen in ADEM are best defined using T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated. elitis demonstrates multifocal areas of hyperintensity in both cerebral hemispheres involving cortical gray matter, centrum semiovale, and deep gray nuclei. a saggital T2-weighted MRI of the spine in the same child demonstrates high signal intrinsic to the spinal cord, consistent with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis 50 white blood cells/mm can be observed in ADEM. this finding is highly atypical for multiple sclerosis. monophasic ADEM may evolve over as long as 3 months. the 2001 McDonald Criteria was considered the most useful in making a diagnosis of pediatric MS24. the McDonald criteria integrate MRI findings and allow the physician to make a diagnosis of clinically definite MS based upon the time interval preceding the development of new white matter lesions. the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space specify a minimal number of lesions, with or without MRI contrast enhancement, being present in specific areas of the CNS. a characteristic pattern of MS on MRI would include multiple well-demarcated lesions in the periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord white matter. a characteristic pattern of MS on MRI would include multiple well-demarcated lesions in the periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord white matter. the utility of CSF oligoclonal bands in diagnosis has been questioned. positive CSF findings can be used to make diagnosis of MS even in the case of a single clinical attack25."}
