{"summary": "health library is a free-of-charge medical portal on the Internet providing medical information for the general public. Physician\u2019s Databases provides medical information for health care professionals (HCPs) to support their clinical practice. the latter is used only by health professionals and pharmacies. the general public\u2019s article openings appeared stronger among the general public. media coverage may also have an influence on HCPs. the higher the media coverage by some publications, the higher the general public\u2019s access to Health Library. in 2013, 80% (3800/4750) of households in Finland had broadband internet [11] of health information topics sought after on the Web. specific diseases are the most common [1], including disease with a seasonal incidence. the use of population health technologies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic demonstrated that an epidemic of fear may trigger changes in collective searching behavior gathered by early warning systems. false positive warnings may lead to media reports and then affect the public\u2019s search behavior on the internet [18]. duodecim Medical Publications Ltd publishes a wide selection of medical information targeted at HCPs. it also produces and maintains an Internet medical portal aimed at the general public. each opened article is tracked in a log file. two-thirds of Physician\u2019s Databases\u2019 users consist of physicians working in Finland. they include 60% (12,507/20,970) females and 40% (8463/20,970) males. general search engines cannot profile their users [8], although the characteristics and behavior of those seeking health information from the Internet have been assessed [1]. health-related information-seeking behavior may be affected by several factors such as personal health disorders, thirst for knowledge, or even media coverage. a bite from an infected tick and the resulting human infection typically appear during summer. in the early stage of the disease, local reddish ring-form skin rash occurs 3 to 30 days after exposure. infection may disseminate throughout the body via bloodstream. Lyme disease could trigger an epidemic of fear, especially at the time of extensive media coverage on Lyme disease. infodemiology is defined as a discipline within public health informatics that studies information in an electronic medium or in a population. the articles in Health Library follow the guidelines published on the internet-based commercial portal service (Terveysportti) the principal service is the Physician\u2019s Databases, produced and maintained by Duodecim Medical Publications Ltd. the guidelines include 1300 primary care practice guidelines. the general public\u2019s and HCPs\u2019 article openings on Lyme disease are mainly similar, thus making it possible to use the general public\u2019s article openings as an additional source of information for disease surveillance. we hypothesized that the timing of the general public\u2019s and HCPs\u2019 article opening on Lyme disease is mainly similar. health library\u2019s article on Lyme disease is one of the first links to come up directing the information seeker to the Health Library database. others use the Health Library\u2019s home page link from the Web browser\u2019s address bar to link directly to the Health Library database. the three largest and most influential nationwide media companies in Finland are Sanoma, Yleisradio (Yle), and Alma Media [11]. 85% (4180/4750) and 77% (3658/4750) daily reached the Internet mass media in the younger age group of 15 to 44 years and older age group of 60 to 69 years respectively. each media website has a search functionality on their home page allowing consumers to search for the information they desire. articles on Lyme disease were categorized by publication date for every week to be comparable to weekly openings in the Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases. me disease for all 21 health care districts in Finland was chosen to allow comparable data from Health Library and Physician\u2019s Databases. less than a fifth of users are not directed to Health Library via Google. most search Lyme disease from a general search engine such as Google by using words borrelioosi (borreliosis in Finnish) or borrelia. internet daily reached 84% (3990/4750) of Finnish people aged 15 to 69 years, 83% (3943/4750) of females and 85% (4038/4750) of males. a total of 88% (4180/4750) and 77% (3658/4750) daily reached the Internet mass media in the younger age group of 15 to 44 years. the openings of health library and Physician\u2019s Databases peaked at 14,956 in May 2015 and at 2144 in July 2012. from 2011 to 2015, the general public\u2019s article openings on Lyme disease considerably increased in both the maximum (from 3329 to 14,956, 4.5-fold increase) and minimum values (from 1868 to 2132, 1.1-fold increase) from 2013 to 2014, there were three off-season peaks in openings occurring simultaneously with media publications. in December 2013, three media publications occurred simultaneously as a peak in the general public\u2019s article openings, while a peak in the HCPs\u2019 article openings appeared before the publications. the data are shown in Table 3 and in Multimedia Appendices 1-3. the number of media publications released on the top five Finnish media websites during off-season months (January, November, and December) from 2011 to 2015. the general public\u2019s article openings on Lyme disease start rapidly at the beginning of May, peak from May to September, and then decline to the lowest point from December to January. the openings of health library and Physician\u2019s Databases peaked at 14,956 in May 2015 and at 2144 in July 2012, respectively. from 2011 to 2015, the general public\u2019s article openings on Lyme disease considerably increased in both the maximum (from 3329 to 14,956, 4.5-fold increase) and minimum values (from from 2013 to 2014, there were three off-season peaks in openings occurring simultaneously with media publications. in January 2013, three media publications occurred simultaneously as a peak in the general public\u2019s article openings, whereas a peak in the HCPs\u2019 article openings appeared before the publications. seven personal stories included a person\u2019s experience on Lyme disease. one publication included both the institutional view and personal story. two other articles included journalists\u2019 reports on ticks or Lyme disease. the information-seeking behavior of the general public and HCPs on Lyme disease resembles the trend demonstrated by epidemiological data [13,14,16]. the general public\u2019s opening patterns from Health Library appeared more seasonally fluctuating, and they increased over time. the general public has shown a seasonally different interest on Lyme disease compared with the general public. the general public has shown a seasonally different interest on Lyme disease than the general public. infoveillance has been used for assessing the epidemiology of influenza. it included substantial flaws in geographic scales and timing. it included substantial flaws in geographic scales and timing. the general public's information-seeking behavior on Lyme disease has significantly increased during summertime and wintertime from 2011 to 2015. this is the first study on the general public\u2019s information-seeking behavior on Lyme disease from a dedicated Internet medical database. general public\u2019s article openings from medical databases should be considered as an additional information source for disease surveillance. from 2011 to 2015, the general public\u2019s article openings from Health Library appeared to fluctuate more and showed a net increase compared with the seasonal steadiness and absence in weekly fluctuation in openings. the following peaks in searches by the general public coincided with released media publications. in January 2013, there were two institutional texts and one personal story with institutional view. in December 2013, there was one institutional text and one personal story with institutional view. general search engines could not characterize their users, which consisted of both HCPs and the general public. a fear of disease epidemic may have an influence on Internet search behavior. limitations include certain limitations. the general public\u2019s searching behavior on Lyme disease has considerably increased during summertime and wintertime from 2011 to 2015. this indicates that as interest in Lyme disease coincides with increasing numbers of Lyme cases, the Internet openings could be used as a supplementary source of information for disease surveillance."}
