{"summary": "inflammatory lesions predominantly in white matter regions of the brain early in disease. gray matter atrophy is detected by MRI imaging and marks the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. none of the treatments currently used in MS reverse or directly prevent neurodegeneration in the CNS - instead they reduce inflammation by attenuating T cell activation and/or infiltration into the CNS. treatment cannot be classified as neuroprotective if immune cells never reach the CNS. this protocol makes use of flow cytometric analysis of brains, spinal cords, and spleens from EAE mice to determine effects of treatment on immune cell infiltration into the CNS and proliferation of immune cells in the periphery. treatment Treat EAE mice before disease onset to determine if treatment protects the CNS after immune cell infiltration has occurred. treat mice at peak of disease (about day 15) as in step 3.1 and its sub-steps. Flow Cytometry analysis Dissection Label three 15 ml conical tubes per animal. sacrifice mice at peak of disease using carbon dioxide with a flow rate of about 15% container volume per minute for 2 - 3 min. cut vertebral column into about 5 roughly equal pieces with surgical scissors. squeeze one end of one piece with a hemostat and then use another hemostat. repeat this for each piece of the vertebral column and place the cords into individual, labeled 15 ml conical tubes containing media. resuspend pellet in 200 l of restimulation media. centrifuge the plate at 410 x g for 5 min. resuspend pellet in 200 l of restimulation media. centrifuge cells at 410 x g for 5 min and flick off supernatant. wash cells 2x in 200 l PBS then centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. wash cells 2x in 200 l PBS then centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. lyze cells by flow cytometry, gating on live CD4+ TCR+ cells. lyze cells using a hemocytometer 18 or other validated method to determine the number of cells per mouse with each of the CD4+ T cell phenotypes. flick off supernatant and wash cells 1x in 200 l PBS and centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. repeat centrifugation followed by intracellular staining. anesthetize mice with 2.5% isoflurane and 97.5% oxygen. perform transcardiac perfusion as described in step 3.1.3. avoid inhalation, ingestion, and contact with skin and eyes. remove calcium from vertebral column by rinsing it 3 times in 1x PBS. place it in a large volume of 0.5 M EDTA in 1x PBS for 2 - 3 weeks. Embed brains and vertebral columns in OCT following the sub-steps below. slide 1 will have sections 1, 11, and 21, and slide 2 will have sections 2, 12, and 22, and so on. choose one slide each for brain and spinal cord per stain for every animal in the same (or as similar as possible) region. wash slides 3 times each in 1x PBS with 0.1% nonionic detergent. horse serum for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and goat serum for Iba1. add primary antibody (1:1,000 or 0.2 g/ml goat anti-myelin basic protein for oligodendrocytes, 1:1,000 or 1 g/ml to 3 g/ml mouse anti-GFAP for astrocytes, or 1:750 or 0.67 g/ml rabbit anti- wash slides 3 times in 1x PBS for 5 min, then 2 times in water for 5 min. dehydrate the tissue by placing in the following solutions for 2 min each. perform immunofluorescent staining as previously described 11. de-noise the image by going to Process > Subtract Background. set the \"Rolling ball radius\" to at least the size of the largest object. check \"Sliding parabloid\" and click \"OK\" when complete. EAE induction and Scoring Induce EAE in C57BL/6 mice 11-13 or SJL mice 10,11 as previously described 13. treat EAE mice before disease onset to determine if treatment affects immune cell infiltration or proliferation. conduct flow cytometry on mouse spinal cords to determine immune cell infiltration of the CNS. SJL mice have measurable disease remissions. treat mice during the first peak in disease. take spinal cords to quantify reactive gliosis and myelin. cut off the head and make a cut up the midline of the scalp with surgical scissors. remove the skull with forceps and use a scoop to free the brain. cut off the limbs, tail, ribs, and any surrounding muscle with surgical scissors. resuspend pellet in 200 l of restimulation media (RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1x non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 750 ng/ml ionomycin, and the protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A) centrifuge cells at 410 x g for 5 min and flick off supernatant. wash cells 2x in 200 l PBS then centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. incubate cells with 200 l PBS containing 2% FCS. centrifuge cells at 410 x g for 5 min and flick off supernatant. wash 3x in 200 l permeabilization buffer then centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. resuspend in 200 l PBS. aliquot (typically 200 l) of equivalent numbers of splenocytes from 3.3.3 into individual wells. centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min and flick off supernatant. incubate for 10 - 15 min on ice. analysis of peripheral CD4+ T cell phenotypes Place 200 l of cells (from step 3.3.3) in a 96-well round-bottom plate and centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min and re-stimulate as in 3.2.5. perform the same staining procedure as in step 3.2.6 and its sub-steps. ls labeled with animal's ID with about 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. spinal cords in 50 ml conical tubes labeled with animal's ID. rinse 3 times in 1x PBS and store at 4 oC in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS. remove calcium from vertebral column by rinsing it 3 times in 1x PBS. 2-methylbutane can hold embedding molds for flash-freezing. place the dish on dry ice and cover to pre-cool. store at -80 oC inside of a container to prevent dehydration. te slides at 37 oC for 30 min and wash 3 times in 1x PBS with 0.1% nonionic detergent for 5 min. circle an area around the tissue with a hydrophobic barrier pen. incubate for 30 min at RT. avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) in immunoperoxidase 30 min before use and agitate on a shaker until needed in 4.2.12. Flick solution off the slides and wash 3 times in 1x PBS for 5 min, then 2 times in water for 5 min. make 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution and add it to cover sections. nih.gov/ij/ shows hemispheres in analyses. measure mean fraction area for reactive gliosis (Iba1 and GFAP staining) use the menu string File > Open and select an image from step 4.2.16. for analysis, compare \"Area fraction\" values between treatment groups. Ensure that \"Limit to threshold\" is unchecked and \"Display label\" is checked. click \"OK\" when complete. a clinical score of 1 represents a partially limp tail, which may be determined by lifting the mouse by the base of the tail. the normal helicopter-like rotating may be weakened or absent, and part of the tail may be completely limp. a clinical score of 2 represents a completely paralyzed tail. a clinical score of 2 represents an inability to walk in a straight line. a clinical score of 3 represents an inability to walk in a straight line. a clinical score of 4 represents a mouse laying on its side, unable to walk due to balancing issues. a reduction in immune cell infiltration would also result in diminished neuroinflammation. astrocytes with GFAP and microglia with Iba-1 can then be used to assess changes in mean area fraction staining to quantify neuroinflammation. Statistical analysis should be performed on CD4+, IFN-+, IL-17+, and Foxp3+ cell numbers to demonstrate a significant reduction. no change in the percentage of CD4+, IFN-+, IL-17+, or Foxp3+ should be found if activation and differentiation are unaffected. pathological assessment of myelin must corroborate a reduction in myelin damage consistent with improved clinical scores. to further substantiate that neuroinflammation is sustained or decreased by therapeutic interventions, reactive gliosis can be assessed by measuring mean fraction area for reactive gliosis. methods for brain and spinal cord assessment of immune cell infiltration should be performed as described above. clinical scores (mean SEM) of C57BL/6 mice treated with PBS (n = 20) or SAS (n = 19) from day 7 postimmunization with MOG35-55. Statistical difference was determined using a nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, *p 0.05. IFN--/IL-17+ cells in CD4+ gate (upper panels) and T regulatory cells (Foxp3+) (lower panels) dot plots show percentages in upper right quadrant. n = 10 for PBS treated, n = 9 for SAS treated from two independent experiments. Statistical difference was determined using a nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, ***p 0.001. bar graphs represent two-tailed t test, ***p 0.001. patients with MS continue to experience disease relapses while taking drugs that attenuate T cell activation and/or infiltration into the CNS. EAE can be a powerful tool when studying the nature of interactions between the immune system and the CNS in vivo. treatment can begin during a relapse, where immune cells are actively infiltrating and causing inflammation. treatment can also begin during a relapse, where immune cells may be less prevalent in the CNS with less inflammation. flow cytometric analysis of the spinal cord can determine how many cells have entered the CNS at a given time. 20 may improve the efficacy of B cell-targeted therapeutics 23. if it is experimentally desirable to eliminate the effects of immune cell proliferative changes in the periphery, it may be possible to do so using passive transfer induction rather than the active induction described in this protocol. the method described herein focused on assessing neuroprotection by quantifying myelin loss. the number of progenitor cells as well as their ability to proliferate and mature would also be important to investigate. the authors have nothing to disclose."}
