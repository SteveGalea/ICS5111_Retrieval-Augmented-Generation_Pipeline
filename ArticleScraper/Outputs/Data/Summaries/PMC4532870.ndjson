{"summary": "the case of a child with central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) was presented. the pediatric intensive care unit received an 8-year-old boy with central hypoventilation with respiratory infection and decompensation. he was ambulatory, only needed home ventilatory support at night via tracheostomy. tracheostomy was temporarily connected to the ICU ventilator on SIMV mode. settings were FiO2 0.25, inspiratory time (Ti) 0.9 seconds, intermittent mandatory ventilation rate 20/min, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm H2O, pressure control 15 cm H2O above PEEP, and PS 13 cm H2O above PEEP. travel medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention and management of health problems of international travelers. potential problems that may arise during travel include cardiopulmonary disease mortality, injury, and accident. international travel is made possible even for patients who need ventilatory support. travel with a Ventilator: Ventilation Resource Site (http://www.livingwithavent.com/pages.aspx\"view=noninv&page=Living/Travel) travel with a Ventilator: Ventilation Resource Site (http://www.livingwithavent.com/pages.aspx\"view=noninv&page=Living/Travel) Travel with a Ventilator: Ventilation Resource Site (http international ventilator users network, 2003 (http://www.ventusers.org/edu/valnews/val17-3c.html#air). Ideally, patients with an acute respiratory infection should not be travelling for the sake of other passengers. travel may be once-in-a-life-time opportunity for a young person with chronic illness as was in our case."}
