{"summary": "re-emergent transmission in areas formerly meeting the criteria for transmission control or interruption has signalled the need for a more comprehensive approach. the objective here is to address this practical need by synthesizing over 15 years of collaborative research on the factors controlling the intensity of the disease transmission cycle in southwestern china. the metapopulation or disease control perspective is a central question of scale. attention must be focused at a scale larger than that of a single village. this includes the sources of these imported parasites and the mechanisms by which they are dispersed. adequacies can be addressed through the development and deployment of improved methods to inform the final effort to achieve sustainable interruption of schistosomiasis transmission in china. the amphibious snail Oncomelania hupensis robersoni is the intermediate host of the parasite and lives mainly in irrigation ditches. however, snails are exposed to miracidia which hatch from schistosome eggs. a qualitative picture of the setting of these villages can be gained from the map included in the electronic supplementary material. they are irrigated agricultural villages typical of the hilly and mountainous classification of schistosomiasis transmission ecologies used in china. the amphibious snail Oncomelania hupensis robersoni lives mainly in irrigation ditches. uous villages were excluded because their parasite-related connections with their immediate neighbours were not the focus of interest at the time. a qualitative picture of the setting of these villages can be gained from the electronic supplementary material. a differential equation model of the type extended and popularized by Anderson & May [10] was used to develop an index of internal transmission intensity. external inputs of cercariae and miricidia represent the spatially averaged sum of all sources of each of the two forms of the parasite. either form may be present in irrigation water entering the village or, for miracidia, faecal inputs from infected bovines or reservoir hosts may be deposited and hatch within the village environment. w X 0.001 worm natural mortality (per day) w X 30 development time of worms in human host (day) X see text spatial index for the distribution and interaction between snails and miracidia Xm X table 2 annual maximum uninfected snail density (snails m2) H X 1.8 eggs excreted (per worm pair per gram faeces) the function H(I,k) is described in Wang [12] for individuals and a community-level example is shown graphically in the electronic supplementary material. a distinction was drawn between site-specific and site-invariant factors. to derive that index, consider an isolated village in which only internal transmission of the parasite occurs. the objective is to derive an index of the strength of internal transmission. a relative rather than absolute index is sufficient, although a close linkage to the genuine R0 is desirable. an approximate index will be derived based on stability criteria for an averaged system in which both the gating parameters and the time-variable external inputs are replaced. the constant parameters occurring in the foregoing equations are divisible into site-invariant and site-specific subsets as specified in table 1. the site-specific group is defined as: 2.6 As indicated in table 1, Sm and relate to human water contact, Xm to uninfected snail density, ngo to parasite-contaminated fertilizer use. 7602 188 103.7 29.6 37.9 15.7 0.227 0.128 Shian 5 2.50 3784 125 90.8 10.7 25 14.0 0.400 0.104 Jianxing 6 1.24 8898 219 59.9 27.6 18.3 14.4 0.378 0.058 Jiaojia 4 1.90 4991 223 4.1 2.4 10.5 4.9 0.105 0 Hexing 1 2.29 10 691 227 25.7 2.0 9.7 14.5 0 equation (2.8) can be solved for given the values, f and H, which depend only on the equilibrium state, and the village-specific aggregation constant of the negative binomial distribution, k. equations (2.6) and (2.8) produce a second estimate of based on the remaining system parameters. both will be used below. initial cross-sectional survey data were obtained in 2000 and covered 20 villages of which the 10 discussed here were followed up in 2002. estimates of infected snail density are based on snail surveys and are particularly problematic because the infection rate in snails, even in highly endemic villages, exceeds 2 per cent only rarely. seto et al. [15] make a compelling case that is generally an important descriptor of human exposure. the exceptions are where the infected snail density is zero, in which case only external cercarial inputs are possible, or if a village is classified as isolated. equilibrium equations of the averaged system were used to derive upper bounds on both and for each village. these upper bounds correspond to setting both and equal to zero and imply that all transmission is internal. similarity of estimates of and for the two isolated villages suggests that those values may serve as reasonable central estimates for all villages in the region with similar irrigation systems and agriculture. the 50th percentile from the Monte Carlo runs was used with the and values corresponding to and at the approximate median of the range of sampled values. to determine the adequacy of approximations based on the averaged system, equations (2.4), the time-variable system including the time-variable developmental delay in snails, z, were simulated using Matlab v. 7.7. the two villages with no infected snails in 2000 were not simulated. in a stationary environment, the time-variable gating parameters 12(t) and 21(t) are annually periodic. it follows that a non-zero endemic steady-state level of system (2.1) is that in which the state variables are also annually periodic with constant time-weighted average values. the accuracy of this approximation will be assessed by simulation of equations (2.1) in comparison with the values predicted by equations (2.4) in the context of both the 2000 steady state and the 2002 re-infection studies discussed below. the success, or lack thereof, is intended to point to key data insufficiencies as well as inadequacies in approximating the behaviour of the time-variable system by the averaged model. irrigation profiles that alter the long-term average values of the gating parameters 12(t) and 21(t) vary between villages, but are here treated as site-invariant because of a regional pumped irrigation system. the site-invariant parameter estimates listed in table 1 include those pertaining to acquired immunity. equation (2.4) can be solved for given the values, f and H, which depend only on the equilibrium state, and the village-specific aggregation constant of the negative binomial distribution, k. equation (2.8) can be solved for given the values, f and H, which depend only on the equilibrium state, and the village-specific aggregation constant of the negative binomial distribution. the endemic equilibrium point can exist for what seem to be quite low values of if is only slightly in excess of 1.3. this is of some explanatory interest since it can account for the wide range of endemic levels of worm burden observed epidemiologically over quite small geographical areas. in five of the 10 villages followed up here, between zero and five infected snails were found in samples of between 500 and 1500 total snails. for the villages on the low end of the spectrum, the ratio of the lower to the upper 95% binomial confidence intervals on the infection fraction exceed an order of magnitude. for the two isolated villages, it is possible to solve the equilibrium equations of the averaged system for and using the field data in 2000. for Xinlong 7, the worm burden was 90.8 with the aggregation parameter of the negative binomial distribution estimated to be k = 0.45. these values result in estimates of 1.03 and 1.11 for and 1.83 and 1.89 for. the 2 year re-infection rates in human residents of Xinmin 7 varied by 5\u201310% over the range of values of and for a given. the 2 year re-infection rates in snails, in contrast, varied over a twofold range. the lack of specific knowledge of these external inputs leads to greater uncertainty in the re-infection predictions. the initial conditions on worm burden were set to 5 per cent of those in 2000. the same, and values were used as in the steady-state estimating simulations for each of the eight villages.

[7]. measurements would allow estimation of the sum of CE(t) and ME(t) similar measurements would be greatly enhanced by the development of advanced methods to distinguish cercariae from miracidia. preliminary results hold the promise of circumventing the longstanding difficulty of cercarial monitoring of water."}
