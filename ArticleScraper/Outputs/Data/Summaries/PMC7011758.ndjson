{"summary": "innate immunity functions as an early defence system to prevent the invasion of viruses and establishment of productive infections. but some of these antiviral mechanisms can be detrimental to the host through induction of cellular apoptosis or by tissue damage if inflammatory responses are left unchecked. viruses have developed fascinating mechanisms to take advantage of PTMs to establish productive infections while also circumventing antiviral responses. ubiquitination is a stepwise series of enzymatic reactions involving an E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzyme. ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid (aa) protein and is able to interact with targets through covalent bonds (anchored ubiquitin) or non-covalent associations (unanchored ubiquitin) free ubiquitin is bound through its C-terminal Gly to the E1 active site through a thioester bond in an ATP-dependent reaction. RING family E3 ligases facilitate direct movement of ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate. ubiquitin can become covalently bound usually to the -amino group of a lysine (Lys, K) on the target protein. ubiquitin machinery is capable of synthesizing polyubiquitin chains that are not covalently bound to a substrate. these unanchored polyubiquitin chains retain their free C-terminal Gly. this absence of direct conjugation allows unanchored ubiquitin to function as a three-dimensional signal. unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin activates both TAK1 and RIG-I signalling in vitro. unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin facilitates activation of the IKK complex for downstream antiviral signalling. TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases Determining the target to receive ubiquitin is the responsibility of the ubiquitin-ligating enzyme. TRIM family members are characterized by their conserved RBCC domain. the coiled-coil domain allows for dimerization and oligomerization of TRIMs. the coiled-coil domain is probably conserved amongst TRIM family members due to conservation in coiled-coil sequences. TRIMs allow for interaction with target substrates with high specificity. the most prevalent C-terminal domain is the PRY-SPRY domain (or B30.2) which is only present in vertebrates. TRIMs can take direct action against foreign organisms through canonical proteasome-mediated destruction and a variety of non-canonical means. TRIM79 degrades NS5 not through proteasomes, but rather through lysosomes. the entire replication complex containing NS5, NS3 and NS2B was shown to be re-directed for lysosomal degradation by TRIM79. initial studies on TRIM56 demonstrated its ability to inhibit a range of pathogens including members of the pestivirus, flavivirus and coronavirus families. TRIM56 and TRIM25 inhibit influenza replication by inhibiting vRNA synthesis and blocking vRNA chain elongation respectively. TRIM25 was still capable of limiting IAV replication in the absence of IFN signalling. TRIM25 was shown to directly bind IAV vRNPs in vitro and in the nucleus of infected cells. recognition of vRNPs by TRIM25 did not alter the endonuclease activity or cap-binding functions of the viral PA or PB2 respectively. TRIM25 uses its RNA-binding activity to halt onset of viral mRNA chain elongation. studies on TRIM19 have identified it as a cellular stress sensor. production of ROS as a result of EV71 infection may activate TRIM19\u2019s function as an autophagy repressor through a mechanism that has yet to be determined. TRIM19\u2019s effect on autophagy highlights a developing field of TRIM research [53] TRIM11-microtubule restriction is not broad spectrum for other retroviruses such as MLV. TRIM-dependent blockades against the formation of host\u2013viral protein complexes has been observed to counter hepatitis B virus replication [59]. TRIM5 is thought to directly restrict retroviruses through recognition, binding, hexagonal lattice formation around the viral capsid, and ubiquitination. the inhibition of retroviral reverse transcription has been shown to require all domains of TRIM5 each providing a unique tool for host defence. TRIM5\u2019s B-box 2 domain is necessary for the formation of higher-order complexes that direct the characteristic retroviral capsid binding and restriction. TRIM5 assembly onto retroviral capsids has been shown to promote its E3 ligase activity. interactions between TRIM5 trimers is thought to obstruct the RING and TRIM5 domains such that they face away from the capsid. the TRIM5 RING dimer mutant (I77R) has a reduced ability to restrict HIV that correlated with an inability to synthesize K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. TRIM5 has been described suppressing flavivirus replication with the help of the proteasome. TRIM5 targets the viral NS2A protein for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation resulting in a loss of JEV replication. TRIM52 targets the viral NS2A protein for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation resulting in a loss of JEV replication. TRIM69 can reduce the NS2B/3-mediated cleavage of NS2B/3. TRIM14 and TRIM22 are two TRIMs that function as ISGs during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. TRIM21 promotes destruction of viral capsids via proteasome. arginine (Arg, R) to Lys mutations appeared on the NP of seasonal strains of IAV after the 1918 pandemic. authors suggest they may allow for evasion of T-cell-mediated immunity because some of the mutations reside in known cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes. TRIM41 was found to identify and target NP through its SPRY domain without prior IFN induction. this association showed TRIM41 to be a host restriction factor against IAV through polyubiquitin-mediated degradation. additional IAV components are known to be substrates for TRIMs. TRIM33 targets HIV-I IN for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. TRIM33 localization is primarily nuclear, which is consistent with the presence of a bromodomain that can interact with acetylated Lys residues on histones. TRIM79 plays a significant role in suppression of tick-borne encephalitis virus replication through a direct interaction with the viral NS5 protein. TRIM79 degrades NS5 not through proteasome or ubiquitination, but rather through lysosomes. the entire replication complex containing NS5, NS3 and NS2B was shown to be re-directed for lysosomal degradation by TRIM79 [40, 41]. portion of TRIM56 was shown to relocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon IAV infection. this suggests TRIM56 may target a component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) or the vRNA itself. TRIM56 can indeed identify and capture vRNA. TRIM25 was shown to directly bind IAV vRNPs in vitro and in the nucleus of infected cells. this interaction required vRNA as RNA-free oligomeric nucleoprotein (NP) complexes could not associate with TRIM25. TRIM25 uses its RNA-binding activity to halt the onset of viral mRNA chain elongation. EV71-induced autophagy can facilitate replication and absence of TRIM19 during EV71 infection correlated with a loss in the expression of p62 and an increase in the presence of LC3-II. production of ROS as a result of EV71 infection may activate TRIM19\u2019s function as an autophagy repressor. TRIM11-microtubule restriction is not broad spectrum for other retroviruses such as MLV. TRIM-dependent blockades against the formation of host\u2013viral protein complexes has been observed to counter hepatitis B virus replication [59]. TRIM5 is thought to directly restrict retroviruses through recognition, binding, hexagonal lattice formation around the viral capsid, and ubiquitination. the inhibition of retroviral reverse transcription has been shown to require all domains of TRIM5 each providing a unique tool for host defence. TRIM5\u2019s B-box 2 domain is necessary for the formation of higher-order complexes that direct the characteristic retroviral capsid binding and restriction. TRIM5 assembly on retroviral capsids has been shown to promote its E3 ligase activity. the interactions between B-box 2 trimers is thought to obstruct the RING domains such that they face away from the capsid. dimer, antiparallel interactions in the CC domain result in the placement of the RING and B-box domains at opposing ends. the TRIM5 RING dimer mutant (I77R) has a reduced ability to restrict HIV that correlated with an inability to synthesize K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. TRIM5 has been described suppressing flavivirus replication with the help of the proteasome. TRIM5 targets the viral NS2B/3 protease for proteasomal degradation. the NS2A protein of flaviviruses is involved in vRNA replication, countering host innate immune responses and the formation and release of nascent viral particles. NS3 combines with NS2B to form NS2B/3 which functions in cleavage of DENV precursor polyproteins. expression of TRIM69 can reduce NS2B/3-mediated cleavage of STING. TRIM14 and TRIM22 are two TRIMs that function as ISGs during hepatitis C virus infection. TRIM22 is an ISG that is significantly upregulated upon IFN treatment or IAV infection. arginine (Arg, R) to Lys mutations appeared on the NP of seasonal strains of IAV after the 1918 pandemic. TRIM14 was shown to interact with IAV NP through its PRY-SPRY domain. TRIM41 was found to identify and target NP through its SPRY domain without prior IFN induction. TRIM41 was found to be a host restriction factor against IAV through polyubiquitin-mediated degradation. TRIM32 was an interacting partner for PB1 that was conserved in multiple IAV strains. TRIM32 was recognized in an RNAi screen of all host ubiquitin machineries as a direct antiretroviral factor that inhibits the HIV-1 integrase (IN). TRIM33 targets HIV-I IN for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thus impeding HIV-I. TRIMs have indirectly found themselves at the forefront of PTM control of innate immune signalling by TRIMs. TRIMs can be involved in the inhibition of viral invasion indirectly by promoting induction of antiviral cytokines, including IFNs. TRIMs can be involved in the precise cascades of immune pathways. interactions with TRIM56 promote downstream signaling and a complex with UBXN3B and TRIM56 may promote STING K63-linked polyubiquitination. other chain types can also be critical in certain situations. TRIM21 is expressed and interacts with MAVS through its PRY-SPRY domain. TRIM28 is a regulator of IFN-I and pro-inflammatory signalling by balancing their expression as a transcriptional co-repressor during infection with human strains of IAV [98] the delicate balance of these TRIM-regulated mechanisms can become easily distorted as highly pathogenic avian influenza strains alter the effect TRIM28 has on the immune response. TRIM28 becomes phosphorylated at S473, resulting in a forfeiture of its repressor only a handful of studies have proposed RIG-I-independent mechanisms. some groups suggest a single factor operates as the critical component. others have put forth a cooperative model based on trends gleaned from numerous studies. ubiquitination of TRIM25, TRIM4, MEX3C and Riplet activates innate immune signalling through ubiquitination at various RIG-I Lys residues. the notion of different E3 ligases playing critical roles in the activation of RIG-I has recently been. a single TRIM25\u2013/\u2013 HEK293T clone would not eliminate the possibility of off-target effects as a result of the guide RNA used. a single TRIM25\u2013/\u2013 HEK293T clone would not eliminate the possibility of off-target effects as a result of the guide RNA. authors claimed only Riplet, and not TRIM25, could promote RIG-I ubiquitination in a dsRNA-dependent manner using an in vitro ubiquitination assay. but they also showed that TRIM25 is able to ubiquitinate the 2CARD domain of RIG-I, albeit at higher concentrations of TRIM25 [126] a recent study using the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line required an interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I that depended on the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Lnczc3h7a [118] one additional challenge that has been ignored in these CRISPR knockout studies is the possibility that TRIM25 has different isoforms. a perfect example of this type of redundancy has been described for the kinases TBK1 and IKK. TBK1 is constitutively expressed in many cell types and knockout cells almost completely lose IFN induction. a full in vitro reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway utilizing TRIM25 is known to potently activate RIG-I signalling through unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. the residue K172 in the 2CARD domain of human RIG-I is not conserved in mouse RIG-I. this study also suggested that, at least in mice, Riplet is unlikely to ubiquitinate the 2CARD domain of RIG-I because IAV NS1 did not inhibit ubiquitination of the murine 2CARD [104] TRIM25 does not play a role in RIG-I activation. ubiquitin-independent function could implicate the E3 ligase structure as a novel aspect of RIG-I activation. there is overwhelming evidence that TRIM25 is indeed involved in RIG-I-mediated IFN induction. TRIM5 was identified as a restriction factor that specifically recognizes incoming retroviral capsids. TRIM5 itself can be monoubiquitinated at its N terminus, leading to its proteasomal degradation before formation of higher-order assemblies. this occurs as a result of an interaction with the E2 conjugase Ube2W that cooperates with an additional E2 (Ube2N/Ubc13) to conjugate additional ubiquitin moieties onto TRIM5. TRIM22 and TRIM19 inhibit HIV-1 transcription through the host Specificity protein 1 (Sp1). this is achieved via blockade of the interaction between Sp1 and the HIV-1 LTR promotor region. both human and murine TRIM19 are capable of preventing HIV-1 replication by downregulating expression of the viral LTR [145, 146]. three TRIMs from orange spotted grouper (EcTRIM39, EcTRIM25 and EcTRIM32) were shown to counteract pathogens that can be detrimental to aquaculture farms. the exact means of antiviral activity of these fish TRIMs is unknown. this antiviral function appears to rely on cellular re-localization. TRIM2 reduces infection of new world arenaviruses such as the Junn virus (JUNV) vaccine strain Candid 1 but not Old World arenaviruses such as Lassa. restriction by TRIM2 halted infection of target cells without preventing interaction. TRIM2 was independent of the RING domain yet required the FIL domain. association between herpesvirus chromatin and host chromatin are inhibited, thereby lowering viral replication. TRIM27 expression becomes induced during infection or IFN-I stimulation, which coincides with an increase in HCV replication. TRIM27 attenuates the antiviral response of both the IFN-I and pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. TRIM27 targets TBK1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. TRIM38 prevents NF-B signalling through proteasomal degradation of TRIF. TRIM9 prevents -TrCP from targeting IB for release of NF-B. RNA virus infection led TRIM29 to target both NEMO and MAVS for proteasomal destruction. TRIM29 directly interacted with the cytosolic DNA sensor STING for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. TRIM9 is present in high concentrations in neuronal tissues during all life stages. TRIM9 expression appears to be cell-type-specific, with high levels of expression in CD4 regulatory T cells that produce high levels of IL-10 cytokine [28] TRIM38 negatively regulates initial IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by targeting the TRIF adaptor protein for K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation after PAMP recognition by TLR3/4 [170] enhanced green fluorescent protein vesicular stomatitis virus (TRIM9s) screen to identify TRIMs important in immune responses identified TRIM9s. TRIM9s expression promoted IFN-I and ISG responses while simultaneously obstructing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. TRIM56 is also capable of enhancing the performance of PRRs such as cGAS and STING. TRIM21 is expressed and interacts with MAVS through its PRY-SPRY domain. TRIM52 promotes NF-B signalling and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF and IL-6 cytokines) but does not affect levels of either IB of p-p65. TRIM28 becomes phosphorylated at S473, resulting in a forfeiture of its repressor functions and a subsequent IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. this effect was found not to originate from TRIM28\u2019s known roles in the DNA damage response nor from ROS production during IAV infection. TRIM21 counteracts this challenge to afford the host an early opportunity to commence innate immune signalling. initial recognition of vRNA triggers a conformational change in RIG-I. regulation of RIG-I signalling was initially found to rely on K63-linked polyubiquitination on residue K172 of its N-terminal 2CARD domain by TRIM25. studies showed that regulation of the CTD release step relied on another E3 ligase called Riplet. additional evidence showing regulation of RIG-I by TRIM25 comes from studies that have uncovered several host proteins that regulate the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25. direct interactions between endogenous TRIM25 and RIG-I have been demonstrated during viral infection [105, 110]. a single TRIM25\u2013/\u2013 HEK293T clone has yielded different results. the authors examined a single TRIM25\u2013/\u2013 HEK293T clone. it would not eliminate the possibility of off-target effects as a result of the guide RNA used. this study only used the E2 enzyme Ubc13 alone or with Uev1A and ignored other E2 enzymes (Ubc5c) found to promote TRIM25-mediated polyubiquitin chain synthesis. this effect can be further enhanced by other host factors such as NDR2 [116] previous studies have shown that TRIM25 may play an antiviral IFN-I-mediated role via RIG-I-independent pathways. for example, knockdown of TRIM25 in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells reduced IFN and ISG induction upon stimulation with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. a full in vitro reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway utilizing TRIM25 as the E3 ligase is known to potently activate RIG-I signalling through unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. viral products have been found to directly antagonize TRIM25, consequently reducing RIG-I ubiquitination and downstream signalling. TRIM25 involvement in RIG-I signalling dawned from the remaining presence of an innate immune response in TRIM25\u2013/\u2013 cells upon stimulation. in 2014 two additional E3 ligases (MEX3C and TRIM4) were identified as important components in mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I 2CARD. TRIM4 and Riplet also target K172, indicating a redundant role. TRIM5 was fused to the small catalytic domain of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL36 DUB [65]. TRIM5 itself can be monoubiquitinated at its N terminus, leading to its proteasomal degradation before formation of higher-order assemblies seen during infection. TRIM5 receives its N-terminal monoubiquitin early, creating a \u2018standby\u2019 protein ready for degradation in the absence of infection and higher-order assemblies. this stepwise progression of capsid recognition, higher-order assembly, K63-linked polyubiquitination and NF-B signalling function as checkpoints. both human and murine TRIM19 are capable of preventing HIV-1 replication by downregulating expression of the viral LTR. this effect holds true for several isoforms of TRIM19, including I, II, IV and VI. TRIM19 recruited to TRIM22 NBs and IFN stimulation alone was sufficient for NB formation and integration of both TRIM19 and TRIM19. the exact means of antiviral activity of these fish TRIMs is unknown. this antiviral function appears to rely on cellular re-localization. the presence of RING domain knockout mutants failed to activate innate immune responses, but also appeared misplaced in the cell. TRIM2 identified signal regulatory protein (SIRPA) as the necessary molecule for halting JUNV entry. TRIM43 was found to be important in limiting the reactivation of latent herpesviruses including Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). TRIM27 targets TBK1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. TRIM38 prevents NF-B signalling through proteasomal degradation. TRIM40 and TRIM13 both target MDA5 for ubiquitination. TRIM9 prevents -TrCP from targeting IB for release of NF-B. TRIM29 can inhibit multiple innate immune pathways by independently targeting NEMO, MAVS and STING for proteasomal destruction. TRIM29 directly interacted with the cytosolic DNA sensor STING for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. TRIM9 is present in high concentrations in neuronal tissues during all life stages. TRIM9 is present in high concentrations in neuronal tissues during all life stages. TRIM9 is involved in regulating IL-10 expression for the development of specific T-cell subsets. TRIM38 negatively regulates initial IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by targeting the TRIF adaptor protein for K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. further inhibition is observed at the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine signalling. the matrix protein from henipavirus (NiV-M) was found to prevent IFN-I production by inhibiting the IKK kinase. the henipavirus structural protein binds TRIM23 and prevents the necessary incorporation of TBK1 into the budding autophagy initiation complex consisting of TRIM23, TBK1 and Hsp90. HCMV IE1 can directly target and accumulate near forming TRIM19 NBs. several TRIM genes are IFN-inducible, allowing for induction of their potent antiviral effect only when deemed necessary. some viruses have developed methods for preventing such rapid activation of immune programmes through epigenetic manipulation of these host genes. a majority of TRIM-related studies have focused on the roles TRIMs play as antiviral factors. the original works identifying TRIMs as restriction factors sparked a flurry of investigations thereafter focused on these antiviral and innate immune roles. this presents itself as a striking mechanism used by viruses because hijacking a known antiviral factor and repurposing its functions to enhance replication would give double the advantage. TRIM23 requires K63-linked polyubiquitin from TRIM23 in order to interact with STAT2 and inhibit IFN-I signalling. other screens have identified additional TRIMs as potential pro-viral factors for flaviviruses. TRIM7 has also been reported to have antiviral restriction activity against noVs. EBOV replication in TRIM6 knockout cells was not increased, suggesting that TRIM6 is required for optimal EBOV replication. a known IFN antagonist and cofactor of the viral polymerase was found to interact with the SPRY domain of TRIM6, implicating VP35 as a target for ubiquitination and co-expression of TRIM6 enhanced ubiquitinated forms of VP35. avibirnavirus infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and duck tembusu virus (DTMUV) also show reliance on host ubiquitin system for replication. ubiquitination at K751 of VP1 promoted IBDV replication while mutant K751R viruses exhibited significant impairments [193] ubiquitin chains, which retain their free C-terminal Gly residue, have been proposed to play roles in both immune signalling and virus replication. there has been debate as to whether these chains have biological functions or whether they might be detected in cells as an artefact after cleavage of covalent polyubiquitin by DUBs. TRIM6 synthesizes unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate TAK1. regulation of TRIM6\u2019s activity may rely on phosphorylation by JAK1. evidence suggests unanchored ubiquitin is relevant comes from in vivo studies. ubiquitin chains can activate the host aggresomes pathway to help the virus uncoat during the entry stage of its life cycle. if this viral strategy also inadvertently triggers host immune signalling through the recognition of these free ubiquitin chains after virus uncoating is currently unknown. review has focused on recent advancements in TRIM-mediated innate immunity. expression and knockdown studies have become an increasingly common tool for data robustness. the high degree of redundancy between TRIMs has made isolating their individual contributions a challenge. an increase in the utilization of in vitro assays may aid in assessing the individual effect one TRIM may have on a particular pathway. viruses shows beautifully how interconnected a host and pathogen are. the difficulty in elucidating the unknown has spurred the very innovation needed to advance this field."}
