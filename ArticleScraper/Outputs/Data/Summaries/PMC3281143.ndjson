{"summary": "HCV has been recognized as a major cause of chronic liver disease. persistent infection is associated with the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. protective vaccine for HCV is not yet available and even the most recent combination of antiviral therapy is often poorly tolerated. zymogens are inactive enzyme precursors that are converted to their active form following a biochemical modification, such as proteolytic processing. zymoxins were composed of a fusion between binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and NS3-activable modified catalytic domains of the bacterial or the plant toxins diphtheria toxin. toxic proteins that are completely inhibited by a natural inhibitor can be found in bacterial \u201ctoxin-antitoxin\u201d systems. the system consists of a pair of genes encoding for a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin organized in a bicistronic operon. when coexpressed in plasmid harboring cells, the antitoxin component interferes with the lethal action of the toxin. MazF induced toxicity is executed by blocking de-novo protein synthesis through its endoribonuclease activity that catalyze the cleavage of single-stranded mRNAs at ACA sequences. the complexed with the toxin and a catalytically inactive heterohexamer is formed in which a MazE dimer is sandwiched between two MazF dimers. the zymoxin encodes for a fusion between MazF and a potent inhibitory peptide derived from its natural antidote MazE. the self-inhibited, zymogenized toxin is well tolerated when expressed in nave cells. in contrast, NS3-mediated cleavage separates between the toxin and its inhibitor. a flexible linker was fused to the C terminus of the inhibitory peptide. the whole construct was fused to the monomeric red fluorescence protein mCherry. the fusion protein is expected to colocalize with the ER membrane-bound viral NS3 protease. NS3 cleavage sequence replaced by mutated 14 amino acids cleavage sequence (P10-P4') from HCV genotype 1a NS5A/B junction in which the P3 valine was substituted by alanine, the P2 cysteine by glycine, the P1 cysteine by glycine and the P4' tyrosine by alanine. schematic representation of the NS3-activated MazF-based the toxic ribonuclease, no longer covalently tethered to its inhibitory peptide, is now free to diffuse to the cytoplasm (which lacks the antidote) the toxic ribonuclease is now free to diffuse to the cytoplasm (which lacks the antidote) expression of NS3-activable ribonuclease in nave HEK293 cells causes minimal toxicity. growth was severely inhibited when cells were transfected with EGFP-fused active (uninhibited) toxin. transfection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. cell line which inducibly expresses a fusion between EGFP and the coding sequence of the full length NS3 (including the helicase domain) followed by NS4A from HCV 1a genotype [10] were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the NS3-activated zymoxin \u201cmCherry-NS3 activated MazF\u201d or the uncleavable control (\u201cmCherry-uncleavable 1105 Tet-NS3/activated MazF or Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated cover-slips in a 24 well-plate. 12 h later, the cells were supplemented with 1 g/ml of tetracycline or left untreated. a complete shutoff in protein synthesis was observed as soon as 24 h post NS3 induction in cells that express the uncleavable toxin. protein synthesis was not impaired following NS3 induction in cells that express the cleavable construct. an immunoblot assay revealed a near complete cleavage of the zymoxin following tetracycline-induced expression of NS3 protease in NS3-activated cells. this proteolytic activation of the ribonuclease toxin resulted in a cessation of cellular protein synthesis soon after induction. this cleavage can be attributed to the \u201cleakiness\u201d of the Tet inducible three 96 well plates were seeded with Tet-inducible full NS3-4A, Tet-NS3/activated MazF or Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF cells. after 72 h, the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. the expression level of NS3 can be roughly tuned by modulation of the final tetracycline concentration in the growth media. both green and red fluorescence were faint in these cells. none of the above observations was evident when these cells were not supplemented with tetracycline or when NS3 expression was induced to high level in cells that constitutively express the uncleavable toxin. 1105 Tet-NS3/activated or Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated cover-slips in a 24 well-plate. 12 h later, cells were supplemented with 10 ng/ml or 1000 ng/ml of tetracycline, or left untreated. 36 h later, cells were fixed. adenovirus-mediated delivery of NS3 activated MazF encoding cassette to eradicate hepatocytes, wild-type Huh7.5 hepatoma cells and our previously described NS3-4A expressing Huh7.5 cells. the cells were infected with a series of multiplicity of infection (MOI) ratios in order to find an optimal MOI that leads to eradication of NS3-expressing hepatocytes while maintaining minimal toxicity to nave cells. 1104 wild-type (W.T) or EGFP-full NS3-4A expressing Huh7.5 cells were seeded per well in 96 well plates. after 24 h, recombinant adenoviruses encoding for mCherry-fused NS3 activated MazF or uncleavable-MazF zymoxins were added at the indicated MOI's. mixed culture and culture of uninfected cells were treated with NS3-activated MazF zymoxin-encoding adenovirus at MOI of 3. viability assay and microscopic examination of the treated mixed culture revealed two cell populations that differ in their appearance. treatment with the uncleavable zymoxin significantly reduced the fraction of the HCV infected cells from the general population. no significant effect on the HCV infected cell population was observed following treatment with the uncleavable zymoxin. 3104 cells from mixed culture were seeded per well into 8-well chamber slides. 24 h later, cells were treated with recombinant adenoviruses (MOI of 3) encoding for the mCherry fused NS3-activated MazF or uncleavable-MazF zymoxins. a short inhibitory peptide corresponding to MazE C-terminal 35 amino-acids was fused to the C terminus of the inhibitory peptide. a flexible linker, followed by the C-terminal ER membrane anchor of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B [28] was fused to the monomeric red fluorescence protein mCherry [29]. the fusion protein is expected to colocalize with the ER membrane fusion to the fluorescent protein mCherry makes the whole construct trackable. the NS3 cleavage sequence was replaced by a mutated 14 amino acids cleavage sequence (P10-P4') from HCV genotype 1a NS5A/B junction in which the P3 valine was substituted by alanine. terminal 35 amino-acids include the 23 amino-acids inhibitory peptide (MazEp) that has been described by Li et al. [25]. the NS3 cleavage site is located between the ribonuclease and the inhibitory peptide in the \u201cmCherry-NS3 activated MazF\u201d construct. the toxic ribonuclease, no longer covalently tethered to its transfected cells were seeded in 3 fold dilutions and were treated with G418. after 10 days of selection, surviving colonies were stained. similar numbers of surviving colonies were observed when cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding mCherry-NS3 activated MazF or the red fluorescent protein alone. the ER membrane-targeted zymoxin colocalizes with NS3 protease in vivo. each bar represents the mean standard deviation (SD) of a set of data from two wells. the ER membrane-targeted zymoxin colocalizes with NS3 protease. t-NS3/uncleavable maF cells were permeabilized and incubated with rabbit-polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody followed by Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for ER visualization (green). a colocalization of NS3 protease and the ER-membrane targeted zymoxin could be observed. Tet-NS3/activated MazF and Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF cells were supplemented with tetracycline for 24 or 48 h, or left untreated. levels of de-novo protein synthesis were than determined by [3H]-leucine incorporation assay. protein from lysates of the described cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-mCherry (for detection of the zymoxin), mouse anti-GFP (for the detection of EGFP-NS3) and mouse anti actin antibodies (loading control) in support of these findings, an immunoblot assay revealed a near complete cleavage of the zymoxin following tetracycline-induced expression of NS3 protease in NS3 NS3-activated MazF eradicates cells that express the NS3 protease. three well plates were seeded with Tet-inducible full NS3-4A, Tet-NS3/activated MazF or Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF cells. after 72 h, the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. no cytotoxicity was detected when the controls were similarly treated. both lower and higher induction levels of NS3 protease caused growth inhibition and rounding of cells that constitutively express the cleavable toxin. both green and red fluorescence were faint in these cells, probably because of the destructive ribonuclease activity of the cleaved toxin toward the NS3 protease. mCherry-NS3 activated MazF cells were supplemented with 3 fold dilutions of tetracycline for 48 h. cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated cover-slips in a 24 well-plate. cells were supplemented with 10 ng/ml or 1000 ng/ml of tetracycline. adenovirus-producing foci were apparent upon infection of packaging cells with both recombinant viruses (encoding cleavable or uncleavable constructs) the production yields for both viruses were 3108 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml, after two \u201ccycles\u201d of virus amplification. the cells were infected with a series of multiplicity of infection (MOI) ratios in order to find an optimal MOI that leads to eradication of NS recombinant adenoviruses encoding for mCherry-NS3 activated MazF zymoxin were added at the indicated MOI's. 1104 wild-type (W.T) or EGFP-full NS3-4A expressing Huh7.5 cells were seeded per well in 96 well plates. controls remained untreated. zymoxin encoding cassette specifically eradicates HCV infected hepatocytes. mixed culture and culture of uninfected cells treated with NS3 activated MazF or uncleavable-MazF encoding adenovirus. viability assay and microscopic examination performed. the fraction of HCV infected cells from the general population was evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-HCV core protein specific antibodies. treatment with the uncleavable zymoxin showed a \u201ccuring effect\u201d upon the partially infected cell population. the uninfected (HCV-negative) cells, the mixed culture of HCV infected and uninfected cells and the control untreated cells were fixed and subjected to microscopic examination. each bar represents the mean SD of a set of data collected from five representative microscopic fields. discussion Fight against viral infections is considered as one of the most challenging areas in modern medicine. vaccination is considered to be the most efficient method for fighting viral infections. for some viral pathogens which cause world-wide health problem, no efficient vaccine has yet been developed. study based on the concept of'sitoxins' which are anti-viral agents that are designed to eradicate viral-infected cells by taking advantage of a specific viral activity instead of inhibiting it. a sitoxin is comprised of an effector domain (e.g. a toxin); a domain bearing an intracellular signaling moiety (e.g. a degradation or an intracellular localization signal); and a domain located between the effector domain and the domain bearing the several enzymes, including bovine RNase A, Vip2 and the maize ribosome inactivating protein (maize-RIP) were converted into protease activated forms by means of fusion to specific, rationally designed inhibitory peptides. the first is the incomplete inhibition of the toxic enzymatic activity conferred by the rationally designed fused peptide. the second relates to the necessity of relatively high level of expressed viral protease for achieving adequate antidote polypeptides in toxin-antitoxin systems were \u201cevolutionary shaped\u201d to strongly inhibit the destructive activity of their toxic counterparts. a very efficient inhibition may be achieved when using them as inhibitory peptides in the construction of zymoxins. a cytoplasmic version of the NS3-activated MazF based zymoxin is barely toxic to NS3 protease-expressing cells. this property may contribute to the specificity and general safety of zymoxin-based therapeutics. tethering the zymoxin to the ER membrane through its inhibitory peptide may also enhance its cleavage-dependent toxicity. infection with adenoviral vector that delivers a transgene encoding the engineered BID molecule was demonstrated to induce activation of apoptosis in cells expressing the HCV NS3 protease. a significant reduction in HCV titer in the serum of the infected mice was detected following injection of the engineered adenoviral vector. the described zymoxin may be extended by replacing the protease cleavage site. this could facilitate eradication of cells that are infected with other protease expressing viruses other than HCV. in addition, one may replace the C terminal ER anchoring peptide with sequence that tethers the construct to a different intracellular location. recombinant
