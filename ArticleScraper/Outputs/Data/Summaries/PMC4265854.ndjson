{"summary": "lipids are a highly diverse group of naturally occurring hydrophobic biomolecules indispensible for cellular life. they serve for compartmentalization of organelles and their diverse functions. the plasma membrane serves to selectively separate the intra- and extracellular environments and acts as the first barrier against invading pathogens. how viruses enter host cells and reprogram the cellular environment is one of the most compelling subjects in host\u2013pathogen interaction. virus-mediated subjugation and modulation of host lipids during infection. the lifecycle of most viruses proceeds through a series of basic steps. for binding and entry viruses hijack lipid based receptors. they rely on host phosphatidylinositol phosphate signalling. s and virus entry The first encounter between a virus and a target cell occurs at the plasma membrane. the plasma membrane controls and co-ordinates the internalization of particles and fluids. in animal cells, phospholipids account for more than half of the lipids in cellular membranes. the sialyllactose moiety on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) membrane gangliosides has been suggested to promote uptake of HIV into mature dendritic cells. gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3 are key molecules that mediate liposome uptake in mDCs. an elegant study by Ewers et al. has demonstrated that association of SV40, or the isolated pentameric receptor VP1, with GM1 is sufficient to induce membrane curvatures. other polyomaviruses, as well as Shiga and cholera toxin, can also induce plasma membrane curvature and promote their endocytic uptake. cholesterol-sensing receptors Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) are important entry factors for filovirus. silencing of NPC1 prevents fusion from lysosomal compartments. negative charged phospholipids have been implicated as virus receptors for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the least abundant phospholipid in the cell membrane. it plays a central role in endosome trafficking and maturation. differential phosphorylation of PI, regulated by specific PI kinases and phosphatases, results in the formation of different PI phosphate species. Activation of PI3K upon virus binding has been observed for a number of viruses using this entry mechanism. many viruses activate PI3K signalling for modulation of post-internalization events. VACV requires activation of PI3K early for macropinocytic internalization. lipid composition influences from which endosomal compartment a virus will fuse. dengue virus exploits the late endosome specific anionic lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate to promote fusion from late endosomes. gangliosides are acidic glycosphingolipids carrying one or more terminal sialic acid. the sialyllactose moiety on gangliosides has been suggested to promote uptake of HIV into mature dendritic cells (mDCs) low-density lipoprotein receptors, negatively charged phospholipids and gangliosides have all been shown to assist entry of different viruses. low-density lipoprotein receptors, also known as cholesterol receptors, can also act as virus entry receptors. the interaction is likely to occur through lipoproteins associated with the virion, such as cholesteryl esters and apolipoproteins. recent reports have indicated that the trans-membrane, cholesterol-sensing receptors Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) are important entry factors for filovirus (Carette et al., 2011) trafficking within the endosomal network is a highly co-ordinated process. the importance of lipids in co-ordinating these various events has come to light in the past decade. PI is the least abundant phospholipid in the cell membrane. PI3K serves to coordinate signalling and cytoskeletal modulation during protrusion, extension, and closure phases of macropinosome formation. many viruses activate PI3K signalling for modulation of post-internalization events such as virus replication and assembly. VACV requires activation of PI3K early for macropinocytic internalization. lipid-dependence of DENV fusion machinery assures that DENV does not fuse prematurely. endosomal lipid content has been shown to be important for west Nile and alphavirus fusion. viruses use lipids to modify their own proteins to promote viral replication complex formation, production of new viral particles, viral egress and spread of infection. dsDNA poxviruses which transiently recruit endoplasmic reticulum cisternae around viral RCs reorganize ER, Golgi, endosomal, lysosomal or mitochondrial membranes to form specialized membrane-bound RCs. lipids involved in controlling membrane fusion, fission, trafficking and cytoskeletal function are enriched in deNV infected cells. the NS5A protein of Hepatitis C virus recruits PI4K-III to virus replication sites to increase local levels of PI(4)P. studies on several different viruses indicate that metabolic pathways and enzymes tend to be manipulated in a virus specific fashion. this is likely dependent upon the metabolic precursors the individual viruses find most advantageous for their replication. large enveloped viruses are not the only viruses that manipulate cellular lipid metabolism. dsDNA poxviruses reorganize ER, Golgi, endosomal, lysosomal or mitochondrial membranes to form specialized membrane-bound RCs. a number of studies are now shedding light on virus-mediated modification of lipid profiles to shape the membrane environment to promote infection. the NS5A protein of Hepatitis C virus recruits PI4K-III to virus replication sites to increase local levels of PI(4)P. it has been proposed that high levels of PI(4)P directly contribute to RC formation by influencing membrane bending or by regulation of intracellular processes including vesicle bending. large enveloped viruses are not the only viruses that manipulate cellular lipid metabolism. this is likely to be required to assure sufficient viral lipid membrane for building new viral progeny, and for remodelling of viral and cellular membranes. the majority of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, and orthomyxoviruses acquire their envelope by budding. this can occur either at the plasma membrane or internal membranes. viruses promote lipid synthesis and reorganization of cellular membrane lipid composition for virus assembly and exit. HCMV has been shown to contain more phosphatidylethanolamines and less phosphatidylserine than the host cell membrane. this lipid content, which resembles that of synaptic vesicles, is thought to facilitate HCMV budding and release. with the exposure of PS, VACV mature viruses resemble apoptotic bodies. lipid-mediated entry mechanism used by several enveloped viruses. antibodies directed against PS can neutralize lethal pichinde and cytomegalo virus infections. lipids serve to orchestrate different stages of viral replication, from entry to spread. a deeper understanding of how viruses manipulate the host cells lipid program will serve to further our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that govern lipid modification, compartmentalization and metabolism."}
