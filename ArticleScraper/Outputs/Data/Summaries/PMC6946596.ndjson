{"summary": "potentiality of cross-species or cross-populations transmission depends on characteristics of host and virus traits. traits such as host phylogenetic relatedness, conservation status, and geographical overlap are critical in the potentiality of cross-species transmission of viruses. bats occupy all kinds of habitats throughout all continents except Antarctica. all European bats are insectivorous but use very different foraging strategies. a high diversity of AdVs has been isolated from bats from America, Africa and Asia. Iglesias-Caballero et al. conducted a country-wide survey in spanish. it was the largest screening for AdVs in bats to date. the study focuses on the analysis of fecal samples and internal tissues. no study has focused so far on the analyses of the determinant factors influencing prevalence of viruses on bats at both species and individual levels. Webber et al. [32] found that viral richness was positively correlated with group size as predicted by the contact-rate hypothesis. cci\u00f3n general de Gesti\u00f3n del Medio Natural y Espacios Protegidos (Consejera de Medio Ambiente), 10/085545.9/17.9/17 issued by \u2018Administraci\u00f3n Local y Ordenaci\u00f3n del Territorio, Comunidad de Madrid\u2019. permits for the collection of punch biopsies of wing membranes from bats were issued by Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientfica phylogeny and phylogenetic signal A fully resolved phylogeny containing all the study species was not available from the literature. a hybrid approach was taken where published trees were grafted to obtain a full-solved topology. branch lengths were estimated using molecular sequence data. 1.1 [47] was run on the concatenated alignment (1805 base pairs in length) to obtain the optimal partitioning scheme and substitution models. a maximum of six possible partitions were allowed; the three codon positions of the two loci. value for trait evolution under Brownian motion suggests stronger phylogenetic signal than predicted by brownian motion [51,52] Variables selection and modeling Ecological and behavioural traits were selected considering their \u2018a priori\u2019 importance for the virus transmission. Species with fewer than 10 samples were eliminated from the matrix and from the phylogeny. phylogenetic linear regressions were carried out with the package \u2018phylolm\u2019 [57] that respects the shared evolutionary histories of species [58]. we used general linear mixed models implemented in the \u2018lme4\u2019 package [64] to test for associations between traits and presence of AdVs for each species considered. \u2018Forearm\u2019 and \u2018Sex\u2019 were set as independent variables. permits for the collection of punch biopsies of wing membranes from bats were issued by Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientficas and Consejera de Agricultura y Pesca y Desarrollo Rural, Junta de Andaluca. phylogeny and phylogenetic signal A fully resolved phylogeny containing all the study species was not available from the literature. a hybrid approach was taken where published trees were grafted to obtain a full-solved topology. branch lengths were estimated using molecular sequence data. a maximum of six possible partitions were allowed; the three codon positions of the two loci were allowed. beAST v2.4.7 [48] was fed the alignment and the fixed topology. a relaxed clock log normal model with exponential priors on the mean (mean = 10) was allowed to estimate the branch lengths over 20 million MCMC iterations. Variables were selected considering their \u2018a priori\u2019 importance for the virus transmission and their availability for the European bat species from the bat literature and general revisions [53], identification guides [34]. the analysis focused on the three species that showed the highest AdVs presence combined with a large enough sample size. Species with fewer than 10 samples were eliminated from the matrix and from the phylogeny. phylogenetic linear regressions were carried out with the package \u2018phylolm\u2019 [57] that respects the shared evolutionary histories of species [58]. 'Locality' was included in the models as a random variable. the variance explained by only the fixed variables was compared to the variance obtained using the package \u2018MuMIn\u2019. inclusion in the analyses of the published results from Vidovszky et al. [26] and Sonntag et al. [25] allowed the addition of six European species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Myotis brandtii, M. dasycneme, M. nattereri, Pipistrellus nathusii and Vespertilio murinus) not found in Iberia.

Fritz\u2019s D parameter was 0.482. we detected a marginally significant departure from Brownian motion structure. probability of D resulting from Brownian motion structure was p = 0.165. the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. dots beyond the end of the whiskers indicate outlying points. at individual level and for the three species considered the GLMM analysis revealed a significantly higher AdVs presence for males. adenovirus prevalence and its correlation with host traits is studied across a wide range of bats both at the species and individual level. the understanding of which and how host traits affect the presence of viruses in bats is a key step to the understanding of the transmission mechanisms and evolutionary strategies of viruses. phylogenetic component of the distribution pattern of AdVs in bats was recently suggested by Iglesias-Caballero et al. [16] as the sequences of new mastadenoviruses were clustering generally in accord with the host bat families or even with the bat species. a second plausible hypothesis is based on the fact that mammals with high infection risk develop a stronger immune system compared to species with low infection risk [71,72]. the site of capture explains an important part of the variance of all models suggesting an underlying general pattern across species and supporting the contact-rate hypothesis. a similar pattern was already found for the viruses responsible for avian influence, Marburg or Ebola. males more likely to be infected by adenoviruses for pipistrellus kuhlii. subadult bats usually have slightly longer forearms. lower prevalence in bats with larger measures could be explained by the influence of the antibody loads transferred to them through their mother\u2019s milk in still developing bats. \u2018Refuge\u2019: 1, 2, 3 indicate respectively whether the species roosts in caves, trees or crevices. \u2018Sociability\u2019: 0 indicates species that never share the roost with other species. \u2018Migration\u2019: 0 indicates species not performing seasonal movement or performing no movement, 1 indicates species sometimes or always share the roost with other species. GLMM model (individual level) for each species taken into account. species screening positive (black) or negative (white) for AdVs. only localities with at least 10 individuals sampled have been taken into account.
