{"summary": "intracellular bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), infects macrophages as host cells. IRAK-M is a negative regulator in TLR signaling and expresses in monocytes and macrophages. IRAK-M knockdown induced M1-type, while inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage. polarization of U937 cells was reversed by IRAK-M knockdown in U937 cells."}
