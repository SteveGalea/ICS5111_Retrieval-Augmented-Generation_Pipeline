{"summary": "influenza viruses and the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pose a serious threat to human health. the yearly recurring influenza epidemics are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among the elderly. global spread of pandemic influenza viruses can cause millions of deaths. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT can activate human influenza viruses for spread in protease transfected cells. TMPRSS2 and HAT are coexpressed with ACE2 and 2,6-linked sialic acids. TMPRSS2 and HAT are coexpressed with ACE2 and 2,6-linked sialic acids. 293T target cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty plasmid together with plasmid pGal5-luc. transfected effector and target cells were mixed, incubated with trypsin or PBS and fusion was quantified by determination of luciferase activities in cell lysates. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding SARS-S [17] or 1918 HA and plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty vector (pcDNA) the cells were treated with either PBS or trypsin followed by incubation with 293T target cells for three days before cells were lysed and luciferase-activities determined using a commercially available kit. tissue sections were immunostained for TMPRSS2, HAT and ACE2 or with the elderberry lectin, Sambucus nigra. antigen retrieval was performed by pressure cooking in different antigen retrieval solutions. immunostaining was detected using the NovolinkTM max polymer detection system after antigen retrieval in Tris EDTA pH9.0. avidin-HRP (Ar-Med Limited, Egham, UK) was detected using Dako DAB chromogen substrate (Dako, Cambridge, UK) after antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA pH 9.0. bronchus was used as a positive control for TMPRSS2 and HAT immunostaining. normal goat polyclonal serum was substituted for primary antibody/lectin staining step. 293T target cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty plasmid together with plasmid pGal5-luc. transfected effector and target cells were mixed, incubated with trypsin or PBS and fusion was quantified by determination of luciferase activities in cell lysates 48 h after cocultivation. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding SARS-S [17] or 1918 HA and plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty vector (pcDNA) the cells were treated with PBS or trypsin, lysed, separated via 12,5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. a mouse monoclonal antibody was used for detection of HA. ACE2 immunostaining (affinity purified goat polyclonal serum, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was performed and detected using a mouse anti-goat Ig (GTI-75) [20] and the NovolinkTM max polymer detection system. immunostaining was detected using the NovolinkTM max polymer detection system after antigen retrieval in Tris EDTA pH9.0. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT were shown to activate influenza virus in transfected cells [4], [9], [10], but only for TMPRSS2 further evidence for a potential contribution to viral spread in humans was reported. in order to assess the role of TMPRSS2 in the influenza virus zoonosis, we tested whether this protease from chicken and swine is able to cleave HA. swine, chicken and mouse TMPRSS2 cleaved SARS-S into multiple fragments. no HA cleavage and activation was observed in cells transfected with empty vector or cells expressing human TMPRSS3. trypsin digestion produced the S1 subunit, as expected [24], [25] transfection of ACE2 plasmid into target cells also boosted cell-cell fusion efficiency. cleavage-activation of influenza HA and SARS-S is conserved between human, porcine, avian and murine TMPRSS2 as well as human and murine HAT. mice are suitable models to study role of TMPRSS2 in viral spread and pathogenesis. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicates are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD). similar results were observed in two independent experiments. immunostaining showed the presence of 2,6-linked sialic acids on the surface of almost all cell types. TMPRSS2 was expressed by epithelial cells at all sites examined in the aerodigestive tracts, as well as by many endothelial cells and myocytes of blood vessels, leucocytes and smooth muscle cells. but immunostaining of pneumocytes was weaker, implying low levels of protease expression at this site. TMPRSS2 expression by bronchial and intestinal smooth muscle cells was noted, although some vascular smooth muscle cells were found to be positive (table 1). Interestingly, TMPRSS2 but not HAT was expressed by cardiac myocytes, suggesting that influenza myocarditis might be promoted. there is strong positive anti-TMPRSS2 immunostaining of sinus epithelium (Ep) and lymphoid cells (Ly) there is moderately strong anti-HAT immunostaining of sinus epithelium (Ep) and occasional weakly positive immunostaining of lymphoid cells (Ly) all structures are strongly stained for 2,6-sialic acid. there is strong positive anti-TMPRSS2 immunostaining of buccal epithelium. there is strong positive anti-ACE2 immunostaining of buccal epithelium (Ep) and weaker positive immunostaining of a blood vessel (BV) in the underlying connective tissue (CT) there is strong positive anti-ACE2 immunostaining of ileal epithelium (Ep) and also of lymphocytes (Ly) within the villus core. there is strong positive anti-HAT immunostaining of the basal part of the ileal epithelial cells (Ep) but only weak positive immunostaining of occasional lymphocytes (Ly) within the villus core. dendritic cells +at all sites, except the majority of smooth muscle cells (SMC) Bronchus & Larynx Epithelium +on respiratory, glandular, transitional and (weakly on) squamous epithelium +on respiratory, glandular, transitional and squamous epithelium; strongly+on glandular epithelium +on respiratory, glandular, transitional and squamous epithelium; but not glandular epi TMPRSS2 activates SARS-S on adjacent cells for cell-cell fusion. TMPRSS2 activates virion-associated SARS-S for infectious host cell entry. ACE2 expression is absent from the trachea, vocal folds and epiglottis. ritic cells in intra-alveolar septa of the lung, adjacent to TMPRSS2-expressing type 2 pneumocytes. the two molecules were also expressed in cardiac myocytes. TMPRSS2 could promote SARS-CoV spread in important target sites, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. type I pneumocytes have been suggested to be major targets of influenza virus in the alveoli [40] and were found to be positive for 2,6-linked sialic acid. the protease responsible for HA activation in these cells remains to be defined, since TMPRSS2 was absent from this cell type and expression of HAT was infrequent and weak. replication of viruses with a mono-basic cleavage site is confined to the aerodigestive tract. TMPRSS2 expression was conserved between avian, porcine and human TMPRSS2. ACE2 has been identified as the SARS-CoV receptor and expression of ACE2 on type II pneumocytes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed by cells in the nasal and buccal mucosa. the gastrointestinal tract is a well-established target of SARS-CoV. a wide range of tissues and organs can be infected by the virus. cleavage was detected by Western blot analysis using a serum specific for the S1 subunit of SARS-S. cleavage fragments produced by trypsin and TMPRSS2 are indicated by asterisks. identifies amino acids are marked in black, similar amino acids are marked in grey."}
