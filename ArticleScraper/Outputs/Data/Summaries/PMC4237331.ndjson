{"summary": "as of June 11, 2014, MERS-CoV caused 699 laboratory-confirmed human infections in 21 countries. as of June 11, 2014, MERS-CoV caused 699 laboratory-confirmed human infections in 21 countries, including 209 deaths. increasing evidence points to dromedaries as an intermediate reservoir contributing to the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. a novel coronavirus (NeoCoV) closely related to MERS-CoV was discovered in cape serotines (Neoromicia capensis) in south africa. ten cell lines from phylogenetically diverse bats were productively infected. the susceptibility or resistance of the ten cell lines to MERS-CoV infection directly correlated with the absence of naturally expressed CD26/DPP4. human CD26/DPP4 infections can be established in permissive bat cell lines after sequential virus passage. the host cell tropism of MERS-CoV may largely depend on the expression of suitable CD26/DPP4 orthologs, and that bats cannot be excluded as MERS-CoV reservoirs. hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) adult kidney pteropid (frugivorous) angola; Benin; Burkina Faso; Cameroon; Central African Republic; C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Ethiopia; Gabon; Gambia; Ghana; Guinea-Bissau; Kenya; Lesotho; Liberia; Malawi; Mali; Mauritania; Mozambique rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) embryo pteropid (frugivorous) angola; Burundi; Cameroon; C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; Cyprus; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Egypt; Equatorial Guinea; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Gabon; Gambia; Ghana; Iran; Israel; Jordan; Kenya; Lesotho; Liberia; Libya; Malawi; Mozambique; mERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012 (MERS-CoV/Jor) was kindly provided by the Department of Viroscience Lab, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, NL. both viruses were propagated in vero cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates were exposed to serial dilutions of MERS-CoV, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h under gentle rocking every 15 min. infected cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. tragacanth overlay was removed and cells were stained with 2% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10% neutral buffered formalin. polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV spike protein antibody (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) followed by secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) the percentage of infected cells was measured and analyzed using the Operetta high content imaging system (PerkinElmer Waltham, MA) cells were scraped off the dishes with a cell scraper, centrifuged at 500g for 20 min. post-fixed cells were stained en bloc with 2% uranyl acetate. a FEI EM UC7 ultramicrotome was used to section embedded blocks into ultra-thin sections. at 24 h or 48 h post transfection, cells were washed once with 0% DMEM and then inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC at an MOI of 3. at 1 h after exposure, supernatants were harvested for virus yield determination. lysates were resolved in bis-tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) and then dry-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were incubated overnight with goat anti-human CD26/DPP4 antibody (1500), followed by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) all others bat cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. all other cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) adult lung vespertilionid (insectivorous) Belize; Canada; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; United States R05T [38] Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) embryo pteropid (frugivorous) Angola; Burundi; Cameroon; C\u00f4te d'I coronavirus isolate HCoV-EMC/2012 (MERS-CoV/Jor) was kindly provided by the Department of Viroscience Lab, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, NL. both viruses were propagated in Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) bat cell lines were seeded in collagen-coated 24-well plates. one day later, media were removed, and cells were washed once with DMEM without FBS (0% DMEM) cells were then exposed to MERS-CoV/EMC or MERS-CoV/Jor at an MOI of 1. antibody-treated cells were exposed to MERS-CoV/EMC at an MOI of 1 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of antibodies. Virus-antibody inocula were then removed, cells were washed in 0% DMEM, fresh DMEM (2% FBS) was added, supernatants were harvested 24 h post-exposure. transmission electron microscopy Confluent bat cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC at an MOI of 1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after viral inocula were removed, cells were washed once with 0% DMEM and then supplemented with 2% DMEM. electron microscopy grade fixative, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, was added directly to the dishes. cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing human CD26/DPP4 (pCMV-xL-hDPP4, Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD) or control plasmid pcDNA3.1+ (Life Technologies) at 24 h or 48 h post transfection, cells were washed once with 0% DMEM and then inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC at an MOI of 3. 75 cm2 flasks were infected with MERS-CoV/EMC or MERS-CoV/Jor at an MOI of 1. supernatants were harvested for virus yield analysis by plaque assay. six out of ten cell lines (EidNi/41.3, EpoNi/22.1, HypLu/45.1, HypNi/1.1, RoNi/7.1, and RoNi/7.2) propagated MERS-CoV. ten different bat cell lines were exposed to MERS-CoV/EMC (A) or MERS-CoV/Jor. red arrows point at double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) typical of coronavirus infections. infected cells were detected by MERS-CoV spike protein IFA. representative images were picked from those taken on day 1 or day 3 post-exposure. cell-surface expression of CD26/DPP4 on bat cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. anti-human CD26/DPP4 antibody inhibits MERS-CoV infection in bat cells. expression of human CD26/DPP4 confers MERS-CoV susceptibility to otherwise resistant bat cells. we transfected MERS-CoV-resistant bat cell lines with a human CD26/DPP4 expression plasmid and then inoculated the cells with MERS-CoV. these results were confirmed by IFA using the same cells stained against MERS-CoV spike protein or CD26/DPP4. cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing human CD26/DPP4 or empty control plasmid and exposed 48 h later to MERS-CoV/EMC at an MOI of 3. supernatants were harvested at 24 h after virus exposure. TEM images taken on day 33 after staining against MERS-CoV spike protein also confirm persistent infection in the same cell lines. intracellular viral particles, virion budding, and virion egress from EidNi/41.3 and EpoNi/22.1 cells and control Vero E6 cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine CD26/DPP4 cell-surface expression in persistently infected EidNi/41.3 cells. western blot analysis of EidNi/41.3 cells showed no or minimal expression of CD26/DPP4. six of ten tested bat cell lines are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. culture supernatants were determined by plaque assay on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 post-exposure of MERS-CoV. ten different bat cell lines were exposed to MERS-CoV/EMC (A) or MERS-CoV/Jor (B) at an MOI of 1. cytopathic viral effects diminished immunofluorescence in some cell lines. images of bat cells (day 1 post-exposure) inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC taken by a transmission electron microscope. none of the four MERS-CoV-resistant cell lines tested positive for MERS-CoV infection. anti-human CD26/DPP4 antibody inhibits MERS-CoV infection in bat cells. antibody treatment reduced MERS-CoV particle production in both RoNi/7.1 cells and Huh-7 cells. CD26/DPP4 plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV cell entry into bat cells. we transfected MERS-CoV-resistant bat cell lines (PESU-B5L, R05T, R06E, TblLu) with a human CD26/DPP4 expression plasmid and then inoculated the cells with MERS-CoV. the results were confirmed by IFA using the same cells stained against MERS-CoV spike protein or CD26/DPP4. representative immunofluorescence assay (IFA) images of cells stained with anti-MERS-CoV spike protein antibody (green, top) or anti-human CD26/DPP4 antibody (red, bottom) showed colocalization of MERS-CoV spike protein and CD26/DPP4. intracellular viral particles, virion budding, and virion egress from EidNi/41.3 and EpoNi/22.1 cells and control Vero E6 cells are clearly visible on TEM images acquired at day 56 post-exposure. persistent MERS-CoV infection of bat cells induces downregulation of bat cell CD26/DPP4 expression. Flow cytometry was used to determine CD26/DPP4 cell-surface expression in EidNi/41.3 and control Vero E6 cells before virus exposure. at day 63, CD26/DPP4 expression was nearly absent in EidNi/41.3 cells. surface expression of CD26/DPP4 could barely be detected in cells inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC. cellular susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection depends on the expression of CD26/DPP4. this evolutionary conserved dimeric ectopeptidase is differentially expressed in various tissues but may not be sole determinant for susceptibility at the organism level. overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 in already MERS-CoV-susceptible bat cell lines led to an increase in virus yield in some bat cell lines. overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 in a naturally high bat cell line may not have an effect on virion entry efficiency. if a bat cell line expresses little CD26/DPP4, finding a binding partner would present a bottleneck for MERS-CoV virions. a number of zoonotic viruses are known to persistently and subclinically infect rodents (e.g., arenaviruses, hantaviruses) or bats (henipaviruses), which then directly or indirectly infect humans [17], [27]\u2013[31]. a number of zoonotic viruses are known to persistently and subclinically infect rodents (e.g., arenaviruses, hantavirus persistent MERS-CoV infection in bat cell lines and vero E6 cells was associated with downregulation of CD26/DPP4. the mechanism of CD26/DPP4 downregulation upon persistent MERS-CoV infection is consistent with receptor downregulation as one mechanism for persistent infection with MERS-CoV in our experiments. ERS-CoV infection in animal models and whether receptor influences pathogenesis in a manner similar to that seen with ACE2 downregulation in persistent SARS-CoV infection."}
