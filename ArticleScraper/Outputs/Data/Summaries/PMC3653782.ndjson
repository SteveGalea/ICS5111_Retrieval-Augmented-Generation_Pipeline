{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae is thought to be a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. the diagnosis relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. 15 of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae tested negative after 1 mo. 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae tested negative after 1 mo. current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection. the researchers recruited 726 children over the study period. the prevalence of M. pneumoniae did not differ between the asymptomatic group and the symptomatic group, with prevalences of 21.2% and 16.2% respectively. asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae cannot be differentiated from symptomatic respiratory tract infection by diagnostic tests (serology or PCR) the prevalence of M. pneumoniae varied between year and season. this study is from a single study site in one city in the Netherlands. if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT of children, the detection of this bacterial species may not indicate a symptomatic infection. this would have major implications for the interpretation of the results of current diagnostic methods for M. pneumoniae RTIs. previous studies have reported the presence of M. pneumoniae in seemingly healthy individuals. these studies all suffered from drawbacks related to the study design. asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated. two study-team members collected respiratory and blood samples just prior to the start of the surgical procedure, while the child was under general anesthesia. three to four weeks later, a questionnaire was completed by phone on development of RTIs in the weeks after enrollment. a standardized questionnaire was used to record baseline characteristics, clinical symptoms, and diagnosis at the discretion of the attending physician. children who tested positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR were invited to participate in a longitudinal follow-up study, from august 1, 2010 to November 30, 2011. samples were either cultured or used for nucleic acid isolation. each step in the PCR procedure, i.e., the preparation of real-time PCR premixes, the addition of purified nucleic acids to these premixes, and the actual PCR reactions, were carried out. 60 l of the original sample from a pharyngeal swab was diluted 10-fold with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium to a total of 600 l. internally controlled nucleic acid extraction (input volume 200 l, output volume 100 l), subsequent (multiplex) real-time PCR, and its quality control were performed as described before [19]. the children in the symptomatic group with a M. pneumoniae infection were divided into two groups according to the presence of co-infections. additional variables in the asymptomatic group were RTI prior to enrollment and RTI just following enrollment. study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Board of the Erasmus MC. it was conducted at the Erasmus MC\u2013Sophia Children's Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. participants aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in two groups. symptomatic group total (n = 321) Emergency Department (n = 190) Age 5.17 (4.76) 2.65 (3.48) 2.18 (3.38) 2.97 (3.50) Female 137 (34.1) 155 (48.0) 58 (44.3) 95 (50.0) Immunizations 383 (96.0) 307 (95.3) 124 (95.4) 183 (96.3) Parental Smoking 145 (36.4) 132 (41.1) 42 (31.8) 90 (47.6) Family size 5 16 a pharyngeal swab (BBL CultureSwab EZ, BD) was taken by gently stroking between the palatine arches superior to the tonsils. the swab was stored in phosphate-buffered saline. two nasopharyngeal specimens were taken. DNA isolation was performed on 200 l of the original samples using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) a quantitative real-time (TaqMan) PCR assay was used to detect and quantify M. pneumoniae genomic DNA. the prevalence of a positive test result for M. pneumoniae was calculated in both groups and compared using the 2 test. a cycle threshold below 40 was considered a positive result. groups were compared for variables that could reasonably have an effect on M. pneumoniae prevalence. additional variables in the asymptomatic group were RTI prior to enrollment and RTI just following enrollment. 26 children, aged 3 mo to 16 y, were enrolled in this study from July 1, 2008, until November 30, 2011. there were no differences between the group of children for whom consent was given (enrolled in the study) and the group of children for whom consent was not given (Table S1). in the asymptomatic group, we found the presence of M. pneumoniae to be positively associated with enrollment in 2010 and 2011. the presence of M. pneumoniae was not significantly associated with age or asthma-like symptoms. the vast majority of the children were immunized (>95%). a similar distribution of M. pneumoniae DNA loads was observed among the asymptomatic and symptomatic children. a longitudinal follow-up study was performed among children who tested positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR. 43 (68%) of 63 children who were eligible for inclusion participated in the follow-up study. three of the symptomatic children tested positive at 2 mo. none tested positive at 3 mo. children were tested an additional time after becoming negative. the prevalence of a positive ELISA for anti\u2013M. pneumoniae IgA antibodies was very low in both groups. a higher percentage of asymptomatic PCR-positive children tested positive for IgG compared to symptomatic PCR-positive children. this difference was not statistically significant when adjusted for age. the agreement between an immunoglobulin class switch and a positive PCR result was poor (Kappa = 0.10). a second serum sample was collected from 233 (72.6%) of the symptomatic children. the prevalence of the four bacterial pathogens is shown in Table 5. we found a significantly higher prevalence of S. aureus in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group. however, when adjusted for age this difference in prevalence was not significant. virology results in 202 study participants indicated by 2 test. p-Value Ct Value, Median (IQR) n (Percent) Influenza A virus 20.1 1 (0.9) 23.0 (18.0\u201333.8) 6 (6.7) 0.03 Influenza B

by 2 test. season of sampling from 3% during the spring of 2009 to 58% during the summer of 2010 suggest that carriage follows a cyclic epidemic pattern. this fluctuation in prevalence is related to the known cyclic epidemic pattern of M. pneumoniae infections that occurs at intervals of 3\u20137 y, in addition to a background endemic pattern. we aimed to assess the association between severity of disease and M. pneumoniae subtype and genomic copy load. participants positive for M. pneumoniae subtype 2 were underrepresented overall. this small number hampered the analysis of this secondary research question. the finding of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has major implications for the interpretation of the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections and for clinical management, as well as the interpretation of studies of the etiology of RTD in children. study demonstrates for the first time that M. pneumoniae carriage is carried at high rates in the URT of healthy children. this asymptomatic carriage cannot be differentiated from symptomatic RTI by serology or quantitative PCR. longitudinal sampling of M. pneumoniae\u2013positive asymptomatic children indicated that M. pneumoniae can be present in the URT without causing disease, followed by clearance within several weeks. some studies explained the presence of M. pneumoniae in an asymptomatic individual as a consequence of a recent infection with this bacterium [14],[15]. a poor correlation was found between data obtained by PCR and serology [22],[23]. it is possible that the positive serological results simply reflect one or more previous encounters with M. pneumoniae. asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae may in some cases lead to symptomatic infection. many studies and some reviews have addressed the performance and clinical value of different diagnostic methods for M. pneumoniae. the occasional presence of M. pneumoniae in respiratory secretions of healthy individuals has often been explained as the first sign of a developing symptomatic infection. a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae\u2013induced RTD cannot be based exclusively on serology or the detection of M. pneumoniae DNA in the URT. caution should be taken in the interpretation of diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae. future studies should address this diagnostic challenge.
