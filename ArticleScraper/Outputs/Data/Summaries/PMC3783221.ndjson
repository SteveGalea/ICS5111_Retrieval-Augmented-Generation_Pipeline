{"summary": "the cartilaginous proximal airway through the bronchi is lined with pseudostratified epithelium. the cartilaginous proximal airway starts from nasal cavities to bronchi and 2\u20133 generations of bronchioles. non-cartilaginous distal airway consisting of terminal and respiratory bronchioles is lined by a continuous layer of epithelial cells. apicolateral junctional complex regulates paracellular permeability. antimicrobial peptides in the mucus layer kills inhaled pathogens. 200 to 300 cilia are found on the luminal surface of each ciliated cell. goblet cells secrete high molecular weight mucin glycoproteins into the airway lumen. they trap and remove foreign particles, thus protecting the epithelial surface. mucin secretion must be tightly regulated for normal functioning, as overproduction can block the airway. in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the potential of Clara cells to differentiate into ciliated and goblet cells. immunohistochemistry studies in human lungs clearly indicates the presence of Clara cells only in the terminal bronchioles, and not in the proximal airways. the primary function of airway epithelium is to function as a physical barrier between the external environment and internal milieu. at least 12 mucins are detected in human lungs. MUC5AC and MUC5B are the predominant mucins in normal airways. the combination of Cl- secretion and reduced reabsorption of Na+ favors normal ASL hydration and efficient mucociliary clearance. in normal airways, the coordinated functioning of ATP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), calcium-activated Cl channel (CaCC), outwardly rectifying Cl- channel (ORCC), and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) regulate the ASL hydration. blet cell metaplasia,61,62 SPDEF promotes goblet cell hyperplasia by downregulating FOXA2 and TTF-1. recently increased SPDEF and decreased FOXA2 expression has been shown to contribute to the development of goblet cell hyperplasia. changes in number and function of cilia can significantly impair the mucociliary clearance function of airway epithelium. however, the impact of the interaction of mucin glycoproteins with pathogens in vivo is yet to be established. junctions in normal airway epithelium prevent inhaled pathogens and other environmental insults from injuring the airways. disassociation or sustained insults that affect junctional complexes will disrupt not only barrier function, but also interfere with normal repair and differentiation of airway epithelium. ectoexpression of protein E delays tight junction formation in airway epithelial cells. the PAR complex is composed of two scaffolding proteins, PAR3 and PAR6, and atypical protein kinase C. the molecular actions of the PAR complex in airway epithelial polarity are not known. several respiratory viruses have been shown to increase permeability and decrease transepithelial resistance of airway epithelium. adenovirus and coxsackievirus bind to CAR, inducing disassembly of the tight junction and reduction in transepithelial resistance (TER) the principal proteins in adherens junctions are type I transmembrane glycoprotein, epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin),-catenin, and -catenin. an extracellular domain of E-cadherin of adjacent cells forms homotypic adhesions between epithelial cells. cigarette smoke causes aberrant activation of canonical Wnt/-catenin signaling. chronic cigarette smoke exposure decreases barrier function and facilitates invasion of airway epithelium by environmental allergens, pollutants, and pathogens. lactoferrin levels increase in response to bacterial and viral infections. lower levels of salivary lysozyme correlated with increased risk of exacerbations136. reduced lysozyme levels in COPD thought to be due to degradation by proteases elaborated by bacterial pathogens or neutrophils. hBD1 constitutively expressed, hBD2 to hBD4 expression is induced by LPS via NF-B activation and by IL-1.144,145 hBD2 is induced by P. aeruginosa infection in normal but not in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. environmental factors such as air pollutants have also been shown to decrease the expression defensin genes in the airways. COPD airway epithelial cells show a trend in decreased expression of NOS2. this was associated with impaired clearance of rhinovirus. innate defense mechanism is defective in cystic fibrosis airway epithelium. airway epithelial cells do not differentiate normally necessitating primary airway epithelial cells for these studies. primary cells are not readily available and not amenable to transfection or transformation."}
