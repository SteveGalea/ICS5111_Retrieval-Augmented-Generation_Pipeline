{"summary": "enteroviruses (HEVs) are frequently detected in the stool of healthy Norwegian infants by using monthly sampling. human parechoviruses (HPeVs) were detected in the stool of 48% of healthy Finnish infants by the age of 22 months (41), while 86% of Norwegian infants had been infected by 24 months (60). for child 1 (male, born in July 1983), stool samples were examined starting at 116 days of age. in total, 34 samples were analyzed. trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) was given on days 107, 218, and 299 after birth. samples were screened for three DNA viral groups (Adenovirus, Anellovirus, and Bocavirus) and 12 RNA viral groups (Aichi virus, Astrovirus, Cardiovirus, Cosavirus, Coronavirus, Enterovirus Norovirus, Parechovirus, Picobirnavirus, Rotavirus, Salivirus, Sapovirus) sample was denatured at 72\u00b0C for 2 min and then chilled on ice.

Isolated time point detection was recorded on days 312 and 368 for another anellovirus, TTMV, and again for TTV on day 333 (Table 2). Sequences similar to human mink-ovine-like astrovirus B (HAstV-HMO-B) isolate NI-196 were detected at the same time as the Aichi virus over a 1-week period the virus protein 1 region of the HPeV-1 was determined for each time point and found to be invariant throughout the sampling period. the closest VP1 sequence of HPeV-1 in GenBank varied by 4% of nucleotides. fecal samples collected at days 142 to 405 after birth were positive for 5 viral groups. 221 TTV/TTMV HBoV-1 HPBV-GI 228 TTV HBoV-1 HEV-A/CV-A16 HPBV-GI 235 TTV/TTMV HBoV-1 HPBV-GI 250 TTV/TTMV b HPBV-GI 257 TTV HEV-C/PV1 HPBV-GI 264 TTV HEV-C/PV3 HPBV-GI 271 TTV/TTMV HPBV-GI 278 TTV mplification was observed for both TTV and TTMV in 13 of 38 TTV-positive samples. prolonged shedding of human bocavirus type 1 (HBoV-1) was detected during eight samplings from days 192 to 243, for at least 51 days. Sporadic detection of HBoV-1 was also seen in samples from days 284 and 313. ly collected samples, lasting 185 days, except for two negative samples near the end of the extended period of shedding. the PCR amplicons were directly sequenced and were all identical. the number of coinfections was high, with 41% of samples from child 1 and 68% of samples from child 2 containing at least 4 distinct human viruses. human parechoviruses (HPeV types 1 and 6) were the next most common infection (15/72 [21%] samples were positive) HBoV-1 was found in 10 samples of one infant and at a single time point of her sibling (11/72 [15%] samples were positive) adenovirus groups C and F were detected in only one infant at 7 time points. anelloviruses have been detected in many tissues (49), blood (7, 49), umbilical cord (22, 24), breast milk (24, 46), feces (51, 53), and urine (13), and multiple routes of transmission have been proposed. the early and nearly chronic detection of different anellovirus species in these infants' feces may reflect enteric infections, viruses from plasma, secretion of infected bile (31), or swallowing of infected respiratory secretions the duration of parechovirus shedding in stool has been calculated to be on average 51 (60) or up to 93 (41) days. the duration of parechovirus shedding in stool has been calculated to be on average 51 (60) or up to 93 (41) days. seroprevalence to HBoV-1 is high in young children (34, 35) serological testing of a closely related astrovirus species (HMOAstV-C) indicated a high rate of exposure in children, likely reflecting a generally mild infection (12). the apparent absence of these viruses may also be due to their presence below the sensitivity of these RT-PCR assays, to target sequence mismatches preventing primer annealing. infections and long-term persistence detected by PCR show that as more sensitive methods of viral detection are used, an increasing number of asymptomatic infections can be detected. the effect on the education of these infants' immune systems of such frequent and long-lasting viral infections remains to be determined."}
