{"summary": "FAs are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with carbon atoms ranging from 4 to 28, which are obtained by hydrolysis of natural triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters. in nature, UFAs generally have cis configurations, the opposed trans-UFAs (TUFAs) naturally present in ruminant adipose tissue and related dairy products. the approaches to determine FAs profile in food industries are important to correct nutrition labeling and control of labeling authenticity. the structures of FAs are diversity, because the length (carbon number) and unsaturation degree (olefinic bond number) of alkyl chains, position and configuration (cis/trans) of the olefinic bond in FAs are different. the stabilities of Ag+-olefin complexes are highly dependent on the properties of olefins that can usually be divided into two groups, namely steric (chain length, cis/trans isomers and number of olefinic bonds) and electronic (conjugation and electron cloud density) properties. a FAs sensor based on the selective complexation between Ag+ and olefinic bonds has never been explored. we propose a test paper for FAs inspection (Scheme 1). by mixing Ag+ with FAs in a solution, a part of Ag+ could form Ag+ complexes and the remnant part is free Ag+ ions. the proportion of free Ag+ is dependent on the concentration and type of FAs. oleic acid was heated at 180 \u00b0C with vigorous stirring and collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 h respectively. collected samples dissolved in ethanol for further colorimetric sensing. oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, elaidic acid, silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium acetate and acetic acid were obtained from aladdin Reagent Database Inc. without further purification. dilution was completed by using sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer solution. 0.2 M NaAc buffer solution with different pH range from 4.0\u20136.5. a 10 L of FAs was added to 100 L AgNO3 solution with final concentration range from 0.05\u20130.20 mM. then 200 L of TMB with final concentration range from 0.1\u20130.5 mM was added to the mixture and reacted at room temperature for 5\u201330 min. there was no blue color and absorbance peaks when oleic acid was added to TMB. the blue color of oxidized TMB faded and its absorbance at 652 nm was decreased. oleic acid alone has no effect on the oxidation of TMB. A = A0 A, A0 and A represent the absorbance of Ag+-TMB system at 652 nm in the absence and presence of oleic acid respectively. Increasing the time has no effect on the increasing of A, as a result, 10 min is appropriate for the experiments followed. the pH affected the oxidation capacity of Ag+. pH 5.0 for the FAs sensing experiments. the higher concentration of TMB and AgNO3 needs higher concentrations of FAs. the low concentration of TMB and AgNO3 makes the low absorbance of oxidized TMB which introduces the larger experimental error. the equation fitted as A = 0.01 + 0.63C (C is the concentration of oleic acid) with the corresponding R2 = 0.989. a) Absorption spectra (inset is digital photo) of Ag+-TMB system in the presence of different concentrations of oleic acid. oleic acid (2), linoleic acid (3) and linolenic acid (4) are all CUFAs but with different numbers of olefinic bonds: 1, 2 and 3 respectively. stearic acid has no olefinic bond, it cannot complex with Ag+ and produce color change. a test paper for colorimetric sensing of FAs based on the proposed Ag+-TMB sensing system. the paper-based devices exhibit distinct colors toward the above five types of FAs. uFAs including oleic acid (2), linoleic acid (3) and linolenic acid (2) show the gradual fading blue color for their number of olefinic bond are increasing. the color changes of the sensor are ascribed to the unsaturation and configuration variation of oleic acid induced by heating. in order to prove the feasibility of the test paper, we profiled the quality changes of edible hot pot oils with heat treatment based on the method described herein. the original oil (0 h) without heating is almost colorless. with the increased heating time from 0 to 8 h, the color of the sensing system gradually turns dark blue. the color changes were mainly attributed to the variation of unsaturation degree and configuration of FAs. the adequate free Ag+ could oxidize TMB and develop blue colors."}
