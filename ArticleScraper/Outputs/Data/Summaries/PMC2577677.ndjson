{"summary": "the highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 g/L in 14/35 (40%) patients and more than 0.25 g/L in 10/35 (29%) patients. the highest PCT levels were less than 0.25 g/L in 14/35 (40%) patients. the presence or absence of viruses did not influence PCT at time of admission. the likelihood of bacterial infection is low among COPD patients admitted to ICU for AECOPD (40% with PCT 0.1 g/L), suggesting a possible inappropriate use of antibiotics. COPD patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit were assessed for eligibility. only those with AECOPD were included in the analysis. a culture, indirect immunofluorescence assay (PCR) was considered evidence for a viral pathogen. baseline assessment included severity of COPD according to GOLD criteria. comorbidities such as smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or chronic cardiovascular diseases. group 1 PCTmax 0.1 g/L indicating an absence of infection. group 3 PCTmax > 0.25 g/L indicating a possible infection. tracheal aspirates were bacteriologically processed if less than 1% of the observed field contained squamous epithelial cells. quantitative variables were compared using the chi-square or Fischer's exact test as appropriate. the level of significance was set at 0.05 and all tests were two-sided. only those with AECOPD were included in the analysis. a culture, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay positive for viruses was considered evidence for a viral pathogen. the ethical board decided that approval was not necessary given the observational nature of our study. according to French legislation at the time of the study, no informed consent was obtained from the patients. the circulating levels of procalcitonin were sequentially assessed at ICU admission (PCT-H0), after six hours (PCT-H6) and twenty fours (PCT-H24) hours. patients were classified into three groups based on the probability of bacterial infection according to the highest procalcitonin level measured (PCTmax) Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were also detected by PCR assay. quantitative and qualitative data were expressed as means (+/- SD) and percentage (with their 95% CI) the level of significance was set at 0.05. procalcitonin levels were not assessed in 4 patients. the arrow indicate cross-over between groups. 9) 0 GOLD stage II (moderate) 3(8) 1(7) 2(18) 0 GOLD stage III (very sever) 3(8) 0 2(18) 1(10) GOLD stage IV (very sever) 26(67) 9(64) 6(54) 9(90) Home oxygen, no.
