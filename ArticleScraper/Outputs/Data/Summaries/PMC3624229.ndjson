{"summary": "influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) uses sugar moieties on host cell membranes. it is a major determinant of the host range, tropism, and antigenicity of the influenza virus. rotavirus VP4, adenovirus GD, and coronavirus spike NTD have been shown to share the same structural folds with human galectins. andwich cores of rotavirus VP4, adenovirus GD, and coronavirus spike NTD have the same structural topologies as human galectins. coronavirus spike NTD has two more -strands in one of the -sheet layers. despite structural differences, virtually all of the -strands in these viral lectins are connected in the same order from the N terminus to the C terminus as human galectins. the sugar-binding site in human galectins is located on the top of the -sandwich core. it is wide open and easily accessible to incoming sugars. sugar-binding sites in viral lectins are hidden in cavities. the sugar-binding site in coronavirus spike NTD was identified by mutagenesis studies. human rhinoviruses hide receptor-binding sites in deep canyons to evade host immune surveillance. the cavities in viral lectins are shallower and more accessible to host antibodies than the canyons in rhinoviruses. viral lectins have evolved to adapt to viral host ranges and tropisms. this study reveals two evolutionary strategies used by influenza virus and other viruses, stealing a host lectin as their own cell entry machinery and evolving hidden sugar-binding sites."}
