{"summary": "miR-155 is a multifunctional miR that plays essential roles in hematopoietic development (2, 3), inflammatory responses (4\u20136), autoimmunity (7), and cancer progression (8, 9). the impact of miR-155 on the prognosis of human solid tumors remains to be elucidated. emerging single-cell RNA sequencing (SCseq) technologies provide a powerful alternative to investigate the characteristics of the TME and study antitumor immune responses at an unprecedented resolution. new studies have employed SCseq technology to dissect molecular features of the TME in both preclinical and clinical models. miR-155 expression was associated with an improved clinical outcome, especially in cancers with high mutational burden such as melanoma and lung cancer. findings also delineate the characteristics and kinetics of miR-155\u2013mediated antitumor immunity in melanoma for the first time to our knowledge. we aggregated data from 11,054 individual cells and performed unsupervised clustering analysis based on similarity of gene expression signatures. this analysis revealed 15 distinct cell clusters representative of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. cells from 4 mice per group were combined and equal numbers were processed for 10 SCseq. expression pattern of miR-155 host gene (Mir155hg) is shown. the size of the dots represents the frequency of cells within the cluster expressing the gene of interest. the color intensity indicates the level of expression. differential expression analysis between clusters revealed distinct gene signatures in support of unique molecular characteristics of clusters. miR-155 host gene expression was detected in activated T cells, NK cells, and Langerhans cells. id and myeloid cell subpopulations in the TME exhibit distinct molecular characteristics. a distinct population of activated CD8+ cells characterized by the expression of cell cycle genes was also enriched in WT mice on day 12. miR-155 was previously shown to be important for optimal antitumor responses (6, 11, 12) but the molecular characteristics of miR-155\u2013competent and \u2013deficient T cell subsets in the TME have not been studied temporally. the loss of miR-155 resulted in lower frequencies of intratumoral CD3+CD8+ cells at both days 9 and 12. CD44 and L-selectin (CD62L, encoded by the Sell gene) are 2 commonly used markers to distinguish activated (CD44hiCD62Llo) and naive (CD44loCD62Lhi) T cell subsets. both at day 9 and day 12 we observed higher expression levels of Ifng and granzyme B (Gzmb) in WT CD3+CD8+ T cells compared with miR-155 TCKO counterpart cell-intrinsic expression of miR-155 is necessary for optimal antitumor T cell activation. Flow cytometric analysis of the B16F10-OVA tumor-infiltrating immune cells on day 12 showed elevated levels of CD8+ T cells in tumors of WT mice. analysis of miR-155 targets in activated CD8+ T cell clusters on day 9. x axis indicates normalized expression values of target genes. frequency of cells with no expression of the indicated genes was scaled to 1. the frequency of cells not expressing a gene of interest was normalized to 1. the relative number of cells expressing the target genes was higher in miR-155 TCKO mice at both time points. the difference between WT and miR-155 TCKO T cells was consistent across the spectrum of target gene expression. Flow cytometric analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells validated the observations of SCseq. CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages in miR-155 TCKO mice expressed higher levels of arginase 1 (Arg1), TGF- (TGFb1), and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3, also known as Ym1). the enrichment of an IFN-\u2013response signature was evident in several other cell types in the WT tumor microenvironment by day 12. we also found Arg1 and TGFb1 to be elevated in CD11b+F4/80\u2013 cells within the TME of miR-155 TCKO mice. Flow cytometric analysis of the tumor microenvironment shows a higher frequency of CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages and CD11b+Ly6G+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in miR-155 TCKO mice on day 12. Graphs were prepared similarly to those in panel C. miR-155 expression defines an immune-enriched subtype of human melanoma. in addition to their roles in immunity, miRs are known to be important determinants of tumorigenesis (25) miR-155 expressed in tumor cells or in infiltrating immune cells can exert different functions. miR-155 expression defines an immune-enriched phenotype in human cutaneous melanoma. miR-155 expression defines an immune-enriched phenotype in human cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) patients. miR-155\u2013high subpopulation of SKCM tumors expressed higher levels of immune-related genes. the miR-155\u2013high subpopulation of patients corresponded to an immune-rich melanoma subtype. miR-155\u2013high human melanoma tumors are highly infiltrated by lymphocytes. the miR-155\u2013low subset was significantly enriched for other inflammatory pathways including tumor necrosis factor (TNFa), IFN- (IFNa) and interleukin 2 (IL2) signaling. TCGA melanoma tumor samples with the highest and lowest miR-155 expression are shown. miR-155 expression is strongly correlated with an immune signature (IS) score that predicts immunotherapy response. miR-155 expression is strikingly correlated with IS score in human melanoma. miR-155 expression positively correlates with immune enrichment in a variety of distinct human solid tumors. a recent study examined gene expression profiles of TCGA tumors. if a gene is found to be differentially expressed in the miR-155\u2013high subsets of all TCGA cancers analyzed, the frequency of differential expression would be 100%. expression of miR-155 host gene (MIR155HG) was elevated in the patient subsets where the mature form of miR-155 was higher. miR-155 expression defines a multicellular immune-enriched phenotype in a wide variety of human solid tumors. miR-155 positively correlates with immune infiltration in human solid tumors. genes in RNAseq data sets (15,151 genes analyzed) showed an inverse correlation between the univariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) of miR-155 and the average levels of miR-155 expression in TCGA tumors. high mutational burden was found to be loosely associated with a lower HR (i.e., improved clinical outcome). miR-155 expression designated tumors with a common immune signature distinctly from miR-155\u2013low counterparts. the same trend was observed when PCA was performed with 548 immune-associated genes downloaded from the ImmPort database. miR-155 expression did not define a distinct tumor population. SKCM had an HR value of 0.84, corresponding to a 16% decrease in clinical hazard in the miR-155\u2013high patient subset. SKCM exhibited the highest mutational burden, followed by lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) in both cases, miR-155 expression correlated with an improved prognosis. live CD45+ immune cells were sorted from pooled tumors (n > 4 per time point) via flow cytometry and subjected to SCseq (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article. we aggregated data from 11,054 individual cells [3,624 cells-WT(d9); 1,956 cells-miR-155 TCKO(d9); 1,759 cells-WT(d12); and 3,715 cells- gene expression heatmap shows top 10 differentially expressed genes in clusters. column widths are proportional to the numbers of cells in clusters. expression pattern of miR-155 host gene (Mir155hg) is shown. the ImmGen database hosts microarray and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from more than 200 purified immune cell subsets. this algorithm calculates an aggregate identity score for each SCseq cell cluster as a measure of molecular similarity to the ImmGen subsets. with this algorithm, certain cell clusters including plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were confidently identified. a significant overlap was observed in the gene expression profiles of closely related cell clusters. the results underscore the need for a multidimensional analytical approach to characterize cellular heterogeneity in the TME. myeloid populations were expanded in tumors grown in miR-155 TCKO mice by day 12. this was true for all 3 neutrophil subsets and monocytes in our data set. the levels of F4/80+ macrophages and pDCs were also elevated. CD44 and L-selectin (CD62L, encoded by the Sell gene) are 2 commonly used markers to distinguish activated (CD44hiCD62Llo) and naive (CD44loCD62Lhi) T cell subsets. both IFN- and Gzmb are critical mediators of T cell cytotoxicity against tumors and pathogens. T cells from WT and miR-155 TCKO mice on day 12 revealed an enrichment for cellular proliferation and effector T cell gene expression signatures for WT samples. when we limit the analysis to only the activated T cell cluster, we observed higher expression frequency of multiple activation marker genes. gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of CD3+CD8+ cells in SCseq data on day 12. normalized enrichment score (NES) and adjusted P value are shown. the frequency of cells with no expression of the indicated genes was scaled to 1. miR-155 expression is induced in T cells upon activation and floxed miR-155 in our model is deleted only in T cells. we investigated expression levels of miR-155 targets only in activated T cell clusters within our data set. we scaled the frequency of cells to the same relative abundance. miR-155 TCKO mice had more than 2-fold higher frequency of macrophages. levels of intratumoral macrophages decreased from day 9 to day 12. Flow cytometric analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells validated the observations of SCseq. gene expression signatures of CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages were found to be enriched in WT mice. miR-155 TCKO macrophages were enriched for a wound-healing phenotype at both days 9 and 12. enrichment of an IFN-\u2013response signature was evident in several other cell types in the WT tumor microenvironment by day 12. the proportions of cells expressing Itgam and Adgre1 encode myeloid/macrophage markers CD11b and F4/80. Flow cytometric analysis shows a higher frequency of CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages and CD11b+Ly6G+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells. miR-155 expression defines an immune-enriched subtype of human melanoma. miR-155 expression defines an immune-enriched subtype of human melanoma. expression levels of miR-155 across the SKCM group were categorized at the top and bottom thirds. several hundred genes were found to be differentially regulated in miR-155\u2013high melanoma patients. the PTPRC gene encoding pan-leukocyte marker CD45 was found to be among significantly upregulated genes. miR-155 expression defines an immune-enriched phenotype in human cutaneous melanoma. miR-155\u2013high and miR-155\u2013low SKCM subpopulations expressed higher levels of immune-related genes. a landmark study published by TCGA consortium in 2015 described multiple molecular and clinical characteristics of SKCM. the miR-155\u2013high subpopulation corresponded to an immune-rich melanoma subtype. the findings were further supported by higher lymphocyte infiltration scores in miR-155\u2013high tumors. miR-155\u2013high melanoma tumors are highly infiltrated by lymphocytes. miR-155\u2013low subset also exhibited an enrichment of genes regulated by MYC, an oncogene that was shown to negatively regulate antitumor immune responses. normalized enrichment score (NES) and adjusted P value are shown. miR-155 expression is strikingly correlated with IS score in human melanoma. miR-155 expression positively correlates with immune enrichment in a variety of distinct human solid tumors. miR-155 expression in TCGA miRseq data sets and observed variable levels of expression across different tumor cohorts. we categorized mature miR-155 expression levels in each cancer type by dividing the patient cohort to the top and bottom thirds. if a gene is significantly upregulated only in half of the TCGA cancers, the frequency would be 50%. multiple other genes encoding canonical markers of immune cell subsets were also upregulated in miR-155\u2013high cancer subsets. miR-155 expression defines a multicellular immune-enriched phenotype in a wide variety of human solid tumors. a total of 2,038 genes with human \u201cimmune process\u201d GO annotation were used for this analysis. a total of 2,038 genes with human \u201cimmune process\u201d GO annotation were used for this analysis. we performed PCA with 2,038 genes annotated with the Immune Process GO term. high miR-155 expression designated tumors with a common immune signature distinctly from miR-155\u2013low counterparts. the same trend was observed when PCA was performed with 548 immune-associated genes downloaded from the ImmPort database. SKCM had an HR value of 0.84, corresponding to a 16% decrease in clinical hazard in the miR-155\u2013high patient subset. in both cases, miR-155 expression correlated with an improved prognosis. in this study, we described molecular characteristics of antitumor immune responses mediated by miR-155. loss of miR-155 in T cells was detrimental to antitumor T cell responses. miR-155 expression was also critical for shaping the intratumoral myeloid immune compartment. miR-155 expression marked an immune-enriched phenotype in 29 other solid tumor types. characterization of miR-155\u2013expressing cells within the TME is critical to reveal which populations are dominant. previous studies reported that miR-155 is induced in T cells upon activation (7, 12, 36) deletion of miR-155 specifically in T cells resulted in lower levels of activated T cells. a deeper sequencing coverage may be needed to detect genes with low transcript counts in SCseq experiments. the findings suggest that a deeper sequencing coverage may be needed to detect genes with low transcript counts in SCseq experiments. miR-155 expression may be a general marker of immune infiltration in human cancer. elucidating the cellular origins of the miR-155 transcript in bulk RNAseq is challenging. findings suggest miR-155 expression may be a general marker of immune infiltration in human cancer. studies have revealed a positive correlation between intratumoral lymphocyte levels and the clinical prognosis. the enhanced immune signature marked by higher expression of miR-155 did not always correlate with an improved clinical outcome across TCGA data sets. SKCM and LUSC are characterized by the highest mutational burden among TCGA cohorts. mice containing a floxed miR-155 cassette were crossed with CD4-Cre mice on the same genetic background. mice containing a floxed miR-155 cassette, but lacking the Cre recombinase were used in the experiments. tumor tissue was dissociated using scissors and forceps. cells were stained with DAPI and APC-conjugated CD45. samples were then processed for SCseq via a 10 platform. this function identified 14 distinct clusters spanning the lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages. we manually separated this cluster and named it accordingly. the biological identities of cell clusters were annotated with the help of an immune-cell scoring algorithm. a gene is inversely regulated in ImmGen and SCseq clusters, the immune identity score is reduced. we surveyed the expression of known genes in the data set. this approach allowed us to further differentiate subsets of neutrophils, macrophages, and T cell clusters. data analysis was done using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. cells were washed and analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. RNAseq differential expression analysis from miR-155\u2013high and miR-155\u2013low patient subpopulations were downloaded by using the TCGABiolinks R package. RNAseq data were normalized via voom transformation as part of this package for each tumor type separately. differentially expressed genes were visualized in volcano and bar plots. a board-certified anatomic pathologist was blinded to the miR-155 expression levels. a ++ score was given if a non-brisk localized lymphocyte infiltrate was observed. a brisk and widespread lymphocyte infiltration was present across the tumor tissue. mice containing a floxed miR-155 cassette, but lacking the Cre recombinase were used. five to 10 mice per group were used in the experiments, which were repeated at least 2 times. live CD45+ cells were sorted via BD FACSAria cell sorter. samples were then processed for SCseq via a 10 platform. gene expression signatures defining cell clusters were analyzed after aggregating 4 samples (WT and miR-155 TCKO, days 9 and 12) the raw data from SCseq experiments in this manuscript can be found in the NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO GSE121478) genes that are differentially upregulated or downregulated in both ImmGen and SCseq data sets contribute to the immune identity score more heavily. if a gene is inversely regulated in both ImmGen and SCseq clusters, the immune identity score is reduced. ted for 30 minutes in 5 ml Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies) cells were stained in HBSS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA. cell surface antigens were stained on ice for 15 minutes. hsa-mir-155 expression was categorized at the top- and bottom-third quantiles. patient subpopulations were designated as miR-155\u2013high and miR-155\u2013low. survival outcome in miR-155\u2013high versus miR-155\u2013low patient subpopulations was examined. tumor cohorts with at least 100 patients exhibit a gradual time-dependent decline in survival were excluded from analysis due to the lack of miRseq. only primary and metastatic tumor data were considered for all tumor types except cutaneous melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) gene sets used in these analyses were derived from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) and previously published manuscripts that investigated immune signatures in various tumor contexts. PCA PCA was used to investigate the relationship between miR-155\u2013high and miR-155\u2013low patient subpopulations. study approval All experimental procedures and handling of mice were performed in accordance with the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regulations and approved protocols."}
