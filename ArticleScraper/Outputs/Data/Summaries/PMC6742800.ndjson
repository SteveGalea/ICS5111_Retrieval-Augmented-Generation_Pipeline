{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Sapelovirus A (SV-A) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Picornaviridae, genus Sapelovirus. SV-A infects mainly through the oral route, replicates in the gastrointestinal epithelia, and is excreted into feces, which are a source for secondary infections. the collected data of 29,649 reads in total were assembled de novo using the Torrent Suite version 5.0.5 and the SPAdes software version 3.1.0 with default parameters. the assembly was 7,301 nucleotides (nt) long with an average coverage depth of 6.39. the sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini were amplified with the SMARTer rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) 5\u2032/3\u2032 kit (Clontech) using the universal primer the genome sequence of the XTND/2018 strain has been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank. the raw sequence reads were deposited in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive."}
