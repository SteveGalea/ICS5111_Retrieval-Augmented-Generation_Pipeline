{"summary": "88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished an H1N1 training program, only 41.9% admitted that they had the knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. 88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished an H1N1 training program. 40,000 ICU admissions (13 - 46 per 100,000 population) compared to 2.7 million hospitalizations. study was conducted in 21 adult ICUs in 17 provinces in china. study was conducted in 21 adult ICUs in 17 provinces. survey questionnaire sent by e-mail to contact persons of participating ICUs. survey questionnaire in companion to instruction was sent by e-mail. contact persons were asked to encourage as many as HCWs in their ICUs to participate. the respondents were asked to report their experience of caring for H1N1 patients, as well as relevant training. they were also required to report the level of knowledge and the level of confidence in their ability to protect themselves and their patients from exposure to influenza. survey questionnaire sent by e-mail to contact persons of participating ICUs. contact persons were asked to encourage as many as HCWs in their ICUs to participate in the survey. a reminder was e-mailed to all contact persons 2 weeks after the first mailing. a 5-point Likert scale was used to elicit preferred answers. the respondents were asked to report their willingness to care for H1N1 patients. an OR of less than 1 was associated with less likelihood to care for patients. only 37 (5.3%) of all respondents reported to receive vaccination for seasonal influenza during the current influenza season. concern about vaccine safety (185, 57.1%) was the most common reason, followed by concern about vaccine efficacy (145, 44.8%) 88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished the H1N1 training program. only 41.9% admitted they had adequate knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. more physicians (60.9%) obtained relevant knowledge from medical journals compared with nurses (33.8%) and other professionals (8.0%) (table 2). 316 out of 376 respondents who finished advanced training were confident of self-protection, compared with only 218 out of 319 without advanced training. most common reasons for unwillingness to care for H1N1 patients included concern about infection of family members and themselves (33/100, 33.0%). the vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza did not influence the willingness to care for H1N1 patients. the level of confidence to know how to protect themselves and their patients significantly increased the likelihood for respondents to care for H1N1 patients. data are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD), or n (%) Logistic regression analysis revealed that physicians or nurses rather than other professionals, advanced training, and the confidence to know how to protect themselves and their patients were all independent variables associated with more likelihood to care for patients. only 37 (5.3%) of all respondents reported to receive vaccination for seasonal influenza during the current influenza season. concern about vaccine safety (185, 57.1%) was the most common reason, followed by concern about vaccine efficacy (145, 44.8%), belief that H1N1 influenza is a mild disease in most patients. 88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished the H1N1 training program. only 41.9% admitted that they had adequate knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. more physicians (60.9%) obtained relevant knowledge from medical journals compared with nurses (33.8%) and other professionals (8.0%) (table 2). data are expressed as n (%) Significant associations between knowledge training and level of knowledge, as well as degree of confidence regarding protection. 316 out of 376 respondents who finished advanced training were confident of self-protection, compared with only 218 out of 319 without advanced training. vaccination for 2009 H1N1 influenza did not influence the willingness to care for H1N1 patients. the percentages reflect a complete pandemic. data are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD), or n (%) Logistic regression analysis revealed that physicians or nurses rather than other professionals, advanced training, and the confidence to know how to protect themselves and their patients were all independent variables associated with more likelihood to care for patients. only 40% of critical care clinicians reported to have extensive knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. lack of knowledge with regard to influenza pandemic was a common finding in previous studies [13,14] because the general public felt that infection control behaviors might do more harm than good and/or were unnecessary [15]. some investigators believed that people were more likely to implement the recommended behaviors in the event of perceived personal risk. the reason for such a significant difference between critical care clinicians and general HCWs remains to be elucidated. the psychosocial impact of a pandemic on HCWs can be significant and multifaceted. 90% expressed great concern about the possibility of contracting and/or transmitting H1N1 influenza to their family and themselves. the study was conducted in 21 tertiary hospitals, possibly limiting generalization of findings to other hospitals. this study was conducted in hospital settings where most severe cases of H1N1 influenza were likely to be treated. authors declare that they have no competing interests. YH, and YW conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination, and helped to draft the manuscript. all authors reviewed and approved the final manuscript."}
