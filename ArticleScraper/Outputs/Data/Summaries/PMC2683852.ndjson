{"summary": "one case-control study has reported an association between susceptibility to SARS and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) in china. variants of the MBL-associated serine protease-2 gene may be associated with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in the same population. a few case-control studies have reported an association between SARS susceptibility and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and MBL. Deficiency of MBL, a key component of the innate immune system, has been detected in SARS patients. MASP2 deficiency is observed because of genetic polymorphisms. it is known that a MASP2 polymorphism, namely D120G, has a functional effect on the protein. this variant has been described for the first time in a patient with an inherited deficiency of MASP2. genomic DNA was quantified using fluorometric reading on a DU 650 spectrophotometer. each sample was diluted to a final concentration of 10 ng/ul. PCR products were sequenced using a geneAmp PCR system 9700(ABI). cycle parameters were 5 min 94\u00b0C (initial denaturation), 32 rounds of 94\u00b0C 30 s, 54\u201355\u00b0C 30 s, and 72\u00b0C 45 s, and a final extention for 5 min at 72\u00b0C. the error rate based upon sequencing for 10% of the SNPs examined in the present study was 0\u20131.2%. the exact test was calculated to evaluate if the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by the Markov chain method. DNA was quantified using a fluorometric reading on a DU 650 spectrophotometer. each sample was diluted to a final concentration of 10 ng/ul. the sample included 60 chromosomes. PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit. polymorphism candidates were identified by the polyPhred program. each SNE primer contained 1 of the 20 oligo-nucleotide tags. NPs examined in the present study were 0\u20131.2%. Statistical analysis The Exact Test was calculated to evaluate if the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by the Markov chain method. the tagSNPs were chosen on a pairwise basis and linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculation was performed using Haploview 3.2 software. 11 exons of MASP2, the 5' and 3' regions of the gene, and some intronic sequences in 30 individuals with SARS identified 17 polymorphisms. nine SNPs (allele frequency >5%) were chosen with Haploview for assessment.
