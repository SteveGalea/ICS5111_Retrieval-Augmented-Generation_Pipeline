{"summary": "SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other diseases and in a secondary form that complicates other rheumatic conditions. circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgM kappa or IgG lambda) were detected in a significant higher frequency (43%) of SS-HCV patients as compared with the primary SS patients. physiological RF belongs to IgM isotype. it facilitates the clearance of antigen by enhancing complement activation and phagocytosis. monospecific RFs are implicated in causing inflammation and tissue damage in the rheumatoid synovium. molecular modeling has been employed as a powerful and reliable approach for rational model prediction of an antibody-antigen complex. the isolated IgG RF has a better binding affinity than the existing complex generated by the IgM RF molecule. the logical and reasonable predicted results provide a probable explanation and further insights into the diversity and origin of these IgG RFs. phages were washed vigorously with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 10 times. bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl/glycine (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 2 M Tris-base. phages were rescued from infected E. coli XL1-blue strain growing in log phase. the wells were reacted with horseradish-peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated goat anti-human or light chain antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. the wells were then washed with PBST six times and 3,5,5-Tetramethubezidine dihydrochloride (TMB) substrate was added for color development. lysates containing recombinant Fab molecules or sera from patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome were incubated with human Fc fragment fixed on western blots. the experiments were performed as described above. the IMGT/V-QUEST international immunogenetics information system was used to compile and analyze sequence data in parallel with germline gene. Molecular Modeling RFL11, an anti-human IgG Fc Fab, was found to possess the highest affinity among several clones screened in this study. complex structural model was built by aligning RFL11 and the complex structure of RF61-IgG Fc to obtain an RFL11-IgG Fc complex instead of using docking methods [23] to avoid uncertain orientation of the interaction between these two proteins. the CDRs of RFL11 interacting with IgG Fc were energy minimized using Dreiding-like force field from Discovery Studio v.3.5. antibody library Two antibody libraries were constructed to express antibody binding fragment (Fab) from patients with hepatitis C infection. library sizes for and light chain were 1.3 107 and 2.1 106. phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl/glycine (pH 2.2) for ten times. bound phages were neutralized with 2 M Tris-base. phages were rescued from infected E. coli cells with 1011 pfu of phage. the wells were reacted with horseradish-peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated goat anti-human or light chain antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. the wells were then washed with PBST six times and 3,5,5-Tetramethubezidine dihydrochloride (TMB) substrate was added for color development. lysates containing recombinant Fab molecules were incubated with human Fc fragment fixed on western blots. the experiments were performed as described above. the IMGT/V-QUEST international immunogenetics information system (http://www.imgt.org/) was used to compile and analyze sequence data in parallel with germline gene. Molecular Modeling RFL11 was found to possess the highest affinity among several clones screened in this study. complex structural model of RF61 interacting with IgG Fc was built by aligning RFL11 and the complex structure of RF61-IgG Fc to obtain an RFL11-IgG Fc complex instead of using docking methods [23] to avoid uncertain orientation of the interaction between these two proteins. the CDRs of RFL11 interacting with IgG Fc antigen were energy minimized using Dreiding-like force field from Discovery Studio v.3.5. the results revealed that over 93% (14/15) of the clones selected from two libraries had correct gene inserts. the input phage number of 1011 was applied for each panning process. the results showed that more than 90% of the clones contain a fragment of 750 bp in plasmid DNA after second around panning. the results showed that more than 90% of the clones contain a fragment of 750 bp in plasmid DNA after second around panning. the panning eliminated most of the phage clones not displaying Fab fragments on their surfaces. GG3 and GG48 clones with high binding specificity to Fc [24] and LPSL and BL12 clones with anti-LPS and anti-red-blood surface Ag were applied as positive and negative controls. both serum of HCV-infected patient with SS disease (Figure 2(b)) and recombinant Fab molecule as represented by RFL11 (Figure 2(c) could clearly recognize Fc protein. GG3 and BL12 denoted positive and negative Fab controls. binding specificity and affinity of RFL11 was further determined by competitive inhibition assay. two nucleotide changes in 158 and 171 of CDR2 of the heavy chain of RFL11 mutated Tyrosine (Y) to Phenylalanine (F) and Lysine (K) to Asparagine (N), respectively. four continual residues were somatically mutated making NYYY to TTDF in CDR3 region. the background of the residues is colored according to sequence similarity. deep blue color shows conserved residues in all sequences. the color scheme is from deep blue and light blue to cyan. gG Fc antigen was colored in cyan. the colors of the six CDRs of RFL11 were the same as that in Figure 6. the format of residues of Fc antigen and H2/H3 loops is abbreviated as three words. clones with either or light chain were 2.1 106 and 1.3 107, respectively. the results revealed that over 93% (14/15) of the clones selected from two libraries had correct gene inserts. the eluted phage titer of final round was about one order higher than that of first panning. the gene III fragment was removed from phagemid DNA purified from coli culture after 4th panning. the expression of IPTG-induced Fab antibodies under the nonreducing condition was clearly detected and shown in Figure 1(b) panel showed human Fc fragment on a coomassie blue-stained polyacrylamide gel. the Fc fragments were detected by serum of HCV-infected patient with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (b) and RFL11 (c) but not an irreverent Fab molecule. three nucleotide differences were identified in CDR3 region of the light chain gene. two changes in nucleotide positions 277 and 279 resulted in amino acid residue that changed from Aspartate (D) to Glutamine (Q) the boundaries of framework region (FR) and complementarity-determining region (CDR) were indicated above each germline gene sequences. light chain shows the most similarity except CDR3. the framework of RFL11 to 2J6E was high similarity. the side chain of Arg50 acts on the side chains of Gln438 and Tyr436 via two H-bondings. the side chains of Ser51 and Asn52 interact with the main chain of Gln438 and produce H-bondings. an H-bonding is also produced between the side chain of Asn52 and the side chain of Gln438. the side chain of Phe105 on the CDR-H3 loop interacts with Pro352 in the H/L chain of C3 domains via two hydrophobic contacts. the Thr102 side chain and Thr103 side chain on the CDR-H3 loop interact with Ser444 and Ser442 on the IgG Fc. the isolated IgG RF was proven to bind specifically to human IgG Fc fragment. subsequent result of an additional serum sample from a patient with ten probable somatic mutations were identified by a comparison of the heavy chain and light chain variable gene sequence with germline counterpart. two in frameworks (Tyr88Phe and Gln16His) and eight in CDRs (Asp93Gln and Ser95Asn (L3); Tyr54Phe and Lys58Asn (H2); asn108Thr, Tyr109Thr, Tyr110Asp, and Tyr111Phe (H3)). a high binding affinity of RFL11 Fab having anti-human IgG Fc capability was confirmed after the final panning. it is another verification to convince an efficient panning process resulting in high affinity clone to become dominant in the final library pool. Gln438 and Lys439 are key residues for both RFL11 and RF61 on the IgG Fc epitope. but from the paratope of the CDR-H2 loop, asn52 and Phe48 on the RFL11 CDR-H2 loop, respectively, form H-bonding and anion-pi interactions with respect to Gln438 and Asp356, indicating the importance of somatic mutation to the CDR-H2 loop the RFL11 CDR-H3 loop forms a finger-like structure extending into the bottom of a deep pocket of IgG Fc. due to the finger-like structure, the CDR-H3 loops of RFL11 can interact with each other as a dimer and together form interactions with IgG Fc. a novel epitope was not found, but we found a different CDR loop. a direct relationship between isolated RFs and autoimmune diseases has not been established. we have demonstrated how these meaningful RFs change the paratopes on CDR through somatic mutation to induce pathogenic high binding affinity."}
