{"summary": "multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and osmotic demyelination have been described in humans. oligodendrocytes and/or the myelin sheath are the target of immune system-mediated destruction in MS. despite numerous attempts, a particular responsible virus has not been identified. oligoclonal IgG found in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) brain and CSF is directed against measles virus. in cryptococcal meningitis, the IgG is directed against cryptococcus and not another fungus such as candida. mouse model studies using theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have given useful information on putative MS mechanisms. chronic viral-induced demyelination is associated with viral persistence [24, 25] and concomitant enhancement of major class I antigens [26\u201330] viral infection causes damage to the nervous system by two mechanisms. it has been proposed that demyelination is caused by an immune-mediated mechanism. TMEV-induced CD8+ T cells have been suggested to function as autoreactive cytotoxic cells. MHV-induced demyelination can serve as a model for oligodendroglial tropic, nonimmune-mediated mechanisms of demyelination. the outcome and degree of MHV-induced disease are dependent on several factors, including the age and strain of the mouse and the route of virus inoculation. inin-esterase protein (HE) is a highly glycosylated protein. the outward radial projection of S gives the virus its family name corona (like a crown) HE forms smaller spike on virions, but its function in the virus life cycle is yet not clearly defined. gene 2 encodes two proteins including a 30 kD product of ORF2a. gene 4 encodes a 12\u201314 kD product while gene 5 encodes a 13 kD product of a still unidentified nonstructural protein. gene 5 encodes a 13 kD product of a membrane-associated E protein. a full-length infectious clone of the viral genome has been exceptionally useful in the study of viral properties. in sindbis virus and picornaviruses, a full-length infectious clone of the viral genome has been exceptionally useful in the study of viral properties. MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 cause inflammatory demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 cause inflammatory demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. serial cross-sections (5 m thick) from MHV-A59-infected mouse spinal cord at day 7 p.i. were stained for myelin with LFB or by Bielchowsky silver impregnation. demyelinating plaque of MHV-A59-infected spinal cord shows loss of axons. CD4+ T cells are necessary for proper CD8+ T cell activation, survival, and retention in the infected CNS [75]. cytolytic-and cytokine-mediated mechanisms of MHV-induced demyelination are unclear. severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, Rag-1 knockout mice, and UV-irradiated mice infected with MHV-JHM have few lesions 7\u201315 days p.i despite viral replication persistence-positive, demyelination-negative phenotypes of Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 (S protein recombinant strain) [81] may persist in neuronal cells of gray matter while demyelinating strains, such as MHV A59, persist in white matter. it is not known which glial cells are mainly responsible for the induction of demyelination. chemokines, tumor necrosis factor, IL-2, Il-6, IL-1, and IL-1 are all induced during the acute stage of MHV infection in the CNS [88]. the role of individual CNS cells in the induction of demyelination remains to be further elaborated. Coronal sections stained for LCA show acute encephalitis in brain section. majority of inflammatory cells are stained positive for the macrophage/microglia marker CD11b in MHV-A59-infected brain parenchyma. axonal damage is immune mediated in MHV-infected mice and occurs concomitantly with demyelination. MHV clearance requires both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells [74\u201376]. ral RNA persistence has been demonstrated in infections with all neurotropic demyelinating strains of MHV including JHM and MHV-A59 [24, 25, 80]. MHV strains that do not persist, such as MHV-2 and Penn 97-1 (laboratory recombinant strains of MHV) [81, 82] also do not demyelinate. MHV3 can induce an initial ependymitis, meningitis, and encephalitis in the absence of white matter lesions. these observations reinforce the importance of glial cell infection in the onset of demyelination. cytokines are believed to aid in host defense against MHV. MHV-A59 infects a variety of cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells. it causes acute meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, and chronic demyelination. MHV-2, a closely related fusion negative [93] strain to MHV-A59, has limited ability to invade brain and spinal cord. the majority of infiltrating cells were CD11b+, a macrophage/microglia marker (Figures 5(i) and 5(j)) some CD3-stained infiltrating T cells were also found. MHV-induced CNS inflammation consists of mixed inflammatory cells. inflammatory cells stained positive for the macrophage/microglia marker CD11b in MHV-A59-infected brain parenchyma (i) the few positive cells in MHV-2-infected brain (j) remained restricted to subependyma (arrows) original magnifications for (a\u2013d) and (h) are 100x, for (g, i, and j) are 200x, and for (e) and (f) MHV-A59-infected mice showed a similar pattern of demyelination as on day 5. the number and area of plaques were larger, and MHV-2-infected mice did not exhibit any demyelination. to avoid a high mortality rate of MHV-2 due to hepatitis, 0.5 LD50 doses (50 PFUs) were used. in MHV-2-infected mouse spinal cord no parenchymal lesions were observed (b), with only rare LCA+ infiltrates observed near the central canal. normal myelin was observed in MHV-2-infected mouse spinal cord (f) original magnification of (a\u2013f) is 40x. light diffuse staining detected in optic nerves from MHV-A59-infected mice. optic nerves from MHV-A59-infected mice had areas of demyelination detected by LFB staining 30 days post inoculation. no demyelination occurred in MHV-2-infected mice. longitudinal sections (5 m thick) of optic nerve from MHV-infected mice are shown. inflammatory cells are evident in an MHV-A59-infected optic nerve. inflammatory cells are evident in an MHV-A59-infected optic nerve. the area of axonal staining (mean SEM) detected by Bielschowsky silver impregnation is significantly lower in optic nerves from MHV-A59-infected mice. optic nerves were stained by Bielschowsky silver impregnation. the area of axonal staining was quantified as described previously. cells were CD11b+, a macrophage/microglia marker. nonspecific background staining of neurons with available anti-CD3 antibodies made staining difficult to quantify. together, data suggests that MHV-induced CNS inflammation consists of mixed inflammatory cells. few positive cells in MHV-2-infected brain (j) remained restricted to subependyma (arrows) original magnifications for (a\u2013d) and (h) are 100x, for (g, i, and j) are 200x, and for (e) and (f) are laser-scanned images. inflammation in the Spinal Cord Pathology was also assessed in cross-sections of spinal cord from cervical, thoracic, and lum MHV-A59 produced larger demyelinating lesions given at 2,000 PFUs than at 50 PFUs. results confirm earlier findings that MHV-A59 induces demyelination. MHV-2 is nondemyelinating at day 30. optic nerves from MHV-A59- and MHV-2-infected mice were cut into 5 m longitudinal sections and stained with H & E and inflammatory cell markers. relapsing EAE was induced in 8-week-old SJL/J mice by immunization with proteolipid protein peptide as described previously in [96]. optic nerves from MHV-A59-infected mice had areas of demyelination detected by LFB staining 30 days post inoculation. no demyelination occurred in MHV-2-infected mice. ON was detected as early as 3 days post inoculation with MHV-A59. axonal staining of optic nerve from an MHV-A59-infected mouse shows low-level axonal staining. no viral antigen is detected in MHV-2-infected (f) mouse optic nerve. axonal loss is detected as early as day 3 post inoculation with MHV-A59. MHV-A59 induces demyelination in the CNS during acute encephalitis, as early as 5 days post inoculation, in addition to chronic demyelination previously observed at day 30. MHV-A59 also induces ON with similar severity and incidence as seen in the autoimmune antigen-triggered model EAE. genome comparison between MHV-A59 and MHV-A59 revealed 94%\u201398% sequence homology of replicase genes, 83%\u201395% sequence homology of genes 2a, 3, 5b, 6, and 7. a marked difference in the sequence of genes 2a, 3, 5b, 6, and 5a among two strains. targeted RNA recombination studies have directly demonstrated that the S gene is a major determinant of virulence of MHV in mouse brain and liver. targeted RNA recombination was used to create new MHV strains, Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2, by replacing the S gene of a closely related, nonencephalitic NDS (MHV-2) [81]. isogenic recombinant strains RSA59 (S gene denoted in green color) and RSMHV2 (S gene demoted in pink color) mice infected with either RSA59 (a) or RSMHV2 (b) at day 5 post infection were stained with Luxol fast blue. isogenic EGFP-expressing viruses differ only in the S gene. they express either the S gene of the highly neurovirulent. differences in virulence and patterns of spread of viral antigen reflected differences between parental viruses expressing each of these S genes. the curved line between the genome and the pMH54 RNA indicates the region in which the crossover must have occurred. the restriction sites relevant to the introduction of the EGFP gene are shown. the IGS (intergenic sequence) is the site of initiation of transcription of mRNA 4. a portion of sagittal brain sections was cut from the middle of the brain of infected mice. a portion of sagittal sections was cut from the middle of the brain of infected mice. a portion of sagittal brain sections was cut from the middle of the brain. NDM-infected mice showed a similar pattern of demyelination as on day 7. arrows indicate a region of demyelination, and the arrowheads indicate normal myelinated area of white matter. in all cases, there is a brisk leptomeningeal lymphocytic infiltrate. both RSA59EGFP and RSMHV2EGFP viruses produced meningoencephalitis. axonal loss with demyelination in the optic nerve of MHV-A59-(parental DM) infected mice has been recently observed. serial cross-sections (5 m thick) from DM- and NDM-infected mouse spinal cord at day 7 p.i. were stained for myelin with LFB (a, e) or by Bielchowsky silver impregnation (b, f) or toluidine blue to delineate preservation of myelin, axons, and axon-myelin coherence following DM and NDM infection. in mouse spinal cord, myelin remains relatively preserved. rare examples of early axonal degeneration characterized by loss of the central axon and collapse of the myelin sheath (arrows) representative foci of demyelination and axonal injury were selected from toluidine blue-stained sections. 600 ultrathin sections from Poly-Bed-embedded blocks were processed for TEM. there are extensive axonal loss and many residual empty vacuoles corresponding to totally degenerated fibers. demyelinating plaque in DM-infected mouse spinal cord showed extensive loss of myelin, hypomyelination (arrows), complete axonal degeneration with only residual empty vacuoles (arrowheads) a high-magnification image (120,000x) of a naked axon surrounded only by a single lipid bilayer shows preservation of cytoskeleton elements (microtubules and intermediate filaments) the outer portion of the myelin sheath as the macrophage strips away and engulfs the myelin sheath. a macrophage is observed surrounding an intact axon (lower portion of the figure) with uncompacted myelin. original magnification for (a) is 15,000x and for (b) is 40,000x. CD11b staining showed that the majority of LCA+ cells in the spinal cord were CD11b+ (Figures 16(b) and 16(f)) at day 30 p.i., LCA+ cells were still present in abundance in demyelinating plaques produced following DM infection. in DM- and NDM-strain-infected mice, no demyelinating plaques were present. serial cross sections (5 m thick) from DM- or NDM-infected mouse spinal cords at day 30 p.i. were stained with LFB (g, h) or LCA (i, j) large demyelinating lesions (g) with infiltrating LCA+ cells (i) were observed in DM-infected mouse spinal cord white matter. normal myelin (h) was observed in NDM-infected mouse spinal cord with only rare DM and NDM differ in their ability to translocate from gray matter to white matter during acute infection. in DM-infected mice, EGFP positive cells with viral antigen are predominantly restricted to the gray matter. four-day-old primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were infected with DM and NDM at MOI of 2. by 72 hours p.i. DM-infected neurons were observed to spread from one neuron to the next, as nearly all cells in the culture contained viral antigen despite initial infection of only a small percentage of cells. DM and NDM Strains Exhibit Different Cellular Tropism. the severity of tissue destruction in MHV infection is mediated by direct viral infection and immune-mediated destruction. the relative contributions of these two components differ depending on a number of virus and host factors. RSJHMEGFP- infected mice only a very small number of viral antigen positive cells were also positive for the astrocytic marker GFAP. in RSA59EGFP-infected mice EGFP completely colocalized with GFAP. in RSMHV2EGFP-infected mice EGFP colocalized with GFAP. infected mice were sacrificed at day 5 post-infection. brains were processed, sectioned and then immune labeled with anti GFAP antiserum. red fluorescence was used to detect GFAP in astrocytes. nondemyelinating strains are highly neuron tropic and spread rapidly through neurites. a temperature-sensitive demyelinating mutant of JHM infects mainly nonneuronal cells. a monoclonal antibody selected JHM variant infects the glial cells predominantly in the CNS, causing subacute demyelination. EGFP fluorescent was colocalized with viral antigen in both RSA59EGFP- RSMHV2EGFP and-infected brain cortical sections. there is a high degree of colocalization of EGFP and viral antigen in the majority of sections analyzed. EGFP fluorescence can be used to detect viral antigen without performing any immunostaining. arrows indicate a region of demyelination, and the arrowheads indicate normal myelinated area of white matter. arrows indicate the microglial nodules and lymphocytes in the vicinity of neurons in mice infected with EGFP tagged MHVs at day 7 post infection. brain sections from RSA59EGFP showed comparatively more parenchymal inflammation compared to RSMHV2EGFP. axonal loss with demyelination in the optic nerve of MHV-A59-(parental DM) infected mice has been recently observed. a large demyelinating plaque was observed in DM-infected mouse spinal cord. the same demyelinating plaque of DM-infected spinal cord showed loss of axons. thin spinal cord sections cut at 1-micron intervals were stained with toluidine blue. control mock-infected mouse spinal cord was used to evaluate for background fixation and/or postfixation artifacts. DM-infected spinal cords showed significant myelin loss within plaques. these naked axons are fully intact with surrounding axolemmas and axoplasm with preserved microtubules and intermediate filaments. there are no hypomyelinated fibers, no naked axons, no macrophages, and no evidence of macrophage-mediated myelin stripping. mouse spinal cords show only rare examples of early axonal degeneration. such early axonal degeneration was not observed in mock-infected mice. a macrophage is observed surrounding a myelinated axon. axoplasm and axolemma are intact and the adjacent myelin shows vesiculation indicative of myelin degeneration. original magnification for (a) is 15,000x and for (b) is 40,000x. serial sections from DM- and NDM-infected mice were stained with anti-CD45 (LCA), anti-CD11b, or anti-CD3. serial cross sections (5 m thick) from DM- and NDM-infected mouse spinal cords at day 7 p.i. were stained with H & E (a, b), LCA (c, d), or CD11b (e, f) the majority of the LCA+ inflammatory cells in the inflammatory plaques were positive for the microglia/macrophage marker CD11b (e) h) was observed in mouse spinal cord with only rare scattered LCA+ cells in the gray matter (j) original magnification for (a\u2013j) is 40x. cross-sections from spinal cord of DM- and NDM-infected mice were examined. since the DM and NDM viruses used in these studies express EGFP, viral distribution was assessed directly by fluorescence microscopy. DM and NDM differ in their ability to translocate from gray matter to white matter during acute infection. brain and spinal cord tissues were harvested and processed for frozen sections. DM- and NDM-infected mice were sacrificed at day 7 p.i. DM-infected neurons were observed to spread from one neuron to the next. nearly all cells in the culture contained viral antigen despite initial infection of only a small percentage of cells. cross-sections from several regions of all spinal cords were stained with viral antinucleocapsid antiserum. at day 5, most of the viral antigen in RSA59EGFP was found in white matter. astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes have been shown. the phenomenon of demyelination may be due to primary infection of a single cell type, or alternatively, infection of diverse CNS cell types leading to the final destruction of OLGs. infected mice were infected intracranially with RSJHMEGFP, RSA59EGFP, and RSMHV2EGFP. infected mice were sacrificed at day 5 post infection. brains were processed, sectioned and then labeled with anti-MAP2b as primary antiboelies and with Texas red goat anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibodies. MHV strains differ in their neurovirulence and ability to demyelinate. RSJHMEGFP infects neurons with greater efficiency. RSMHV2EGFP infects neurons with limited efficiency. neurotropic and nondemyelinating MHV3 strain has an in vitro tropism for neurons, ependymal cells, and meningeal cells but not for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. astrocyte tropism may be a relevant factor in persistent infection but direct astrocytic infection alone may not be sufficient to induce demyelination. demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains differ in their viral antigen distribution in gray matter and white matter during acute infection. RSMHV2 is unable to induce demyelination due to lack of viral RNA persistence in the white matter. DM MHV infection begins in the neuronal cell body and propagates centripetally to the axon [73] which subsequently induces axonal degeneration and demyelination. MHV infection triggers axonal loss and macrophage-mediated demyelination. axonal degeneration and myelin disruption can occur in the absence of macrophages. the failure of MHV to trigger macrophage-mediated damage is entirely a function of transport failure to the white matter. it may be that neuroinvasion by MHV may require entry into the nerve endings, transport to the cell body, replication in the cell body, and transneuronal viral spread. the recombinant DM and NDM viruses used are isogenic on a background of the DM MHV-A59 strain and differ only by the virus-host attachment S glycoprotein. the difference in the S proteins between the DM and NDM strains does not impair host-receptor interactions or viral entry. MHV-A59 and MHV-2 S proteins have 82% amino acid sequence identity. MHV-2 S protein is not cleaved and unable to cause fusion in vivo and in vitro. genes other than the S sometimes referred to as \"background genes\" also influence pathogenesis. e protein has been implicated in MHV-induced hepatitis. replicase and other non structural proteins could affect tropism and pathogenesis by influencing the rate of viral replication perhaps by interactions with cell type specific factors or with elements of the immune response. the S proteins interact with the axonal transport system. a mouse model provides an excellent means by which the particular host-virus interactions responsible for successful axonal transport can be dissected and clarified."}
