{"summary": "standardized mortality ratio due to respiratory illness among pilots was lower than in the general population [8]. pilots have a lower prevalence of asthma (4.2%) as compared to the general population (9.6%) in new Zealand. transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can occur on board faster and at wider areas than the typical transmission model [14] spread of influenza follows previously observed transmission model, but passengers sitting further away than two rows can be infected. transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can occur on board faster and at wider areas than the typical transmission model. furry pet allergens can be transported from homes by furry pet keepers to crowded public places through clothes and hairs. furry pet allergens in settled dust in the indoor environment can cause allergic reactions among sensitized subjects. no previous studies evaluated effects of ban of smoking on board with respect to respiratory illness and allergies among pilots. first aim was to investigate prevalence and 3-year incidence of doctors\u2019 diagnosed asthma, asthmac symptoms, bronchitis, nonspecific hyperreactivity, airway infections and pollen or furry pet allergy. second aim was to study associations between prevalence and incidence of asthma symptoms, bronchitis, nonspecific hyperreactivity, airway infections and pollen or furry pet allergy. questionnaire was sent to all pilots who participated in 1997, 436 participated. pilots operated the same aircraft for a longer period as they were contracted with the company. smokers were classified as smokers and nonsmokers according to this definition. the questions on asthma and respiratory symptoms were obtained from a standardized indoor questionnaire (MM 040 NA) the questions on specific work environment factors relevant for airline crews were obtained from another questionnaire[6], which was developed by the Clinic for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University. the question \u2018\u2018interesting/stimulation at work\u2019 measure work satisfaction. there were four possible answers: \u2018\u2018yes, often\u201d, \u2018\u2018yes sometimes\u201d, \u2018\u2018no, seldom\u2019 and \u2018\u2018\u2018no, never\u2019. a dichotomous variable of \u201casthma symptoms\u201d was created, coded as yes if there was a \u201cyes\u201d answer to at least one of these questions and coded as \u201cno\u201d if there were no asthma symptoms. for work and home exposure, we created new variables measuring the change of exposure by subtracting the baseline exposure from the exposure at follow up. atopy was calculated, excluding subjects with the particular symptom at baseline. the only difference was that atopy was not included as a confounder. atopy was not included as a confounder. the study procedure and study protocol were approved by the regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden. all participants gave their informed consent. if the subjects answered and returned the questionnaire, it meant they had given their informed consent. a current smoker was defined as a subject who reported current smoking. the pilots were classified as smokers and nonsmokers according to this definition. short haul flights were defined as intercontinental flights between Scandinavia and America or Asia with flight duration of 7\u201312 hours. the third set was about current home environment. subjects reporting at least one of these symptoms were defined as having current asthma symptoms. there were two more \u201cyes/no\u201d questions on ever had doctor diagnosed asthma. hay fever/pollen allergy was defined as reporting allergy to pollen. there were three levels for construction year, including \"before 1960\", \"1960\u20131975\" and \"after 1975\" yes/no questions about indoor painting and redecoration last 12 months, window pane condensation in winter, and four yes/no questions on water damage, visual moulds, signs of floor dampness and mould odour at home. differences in age or years of employment between participants and nonparticipants were calculated by Student\u2019s t-test. for work and home exposure, we created new variables measuring the change of exposure, by subtracting the baseline exposure from the exposure at follow up. the change of psychosocial variables were coded in a similar way, and had a range -1 to 1, after dividing the score by a factor 3. forward stepwise logistic regression analysis (Wald) performed for prevalence and incidence of self-reported atopy, using the same models and procedures as for the four respiratory health variables. the only difference was that atopy was not included as a confounder.
