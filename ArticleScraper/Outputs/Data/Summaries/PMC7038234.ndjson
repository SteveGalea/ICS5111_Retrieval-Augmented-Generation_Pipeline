{"summary": "a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome encodes three structural proteins, including the capsid (C), membrane (prM and M), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). a number of compounds with anti-JEV activities are available. the results of this study are expected to contribute to our understanding of the biology of JEV infection. the assay conditions for HCS were optimized as follows: cell density of 10,000 cells per 96-well plate, multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.8, and an endpoint of 24 h postinfection. n were subjected to further investigation because of their high selective indexes. they are cardiac glycoside compounds and act as inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase. each dot represents the percent inhibition achieved with each compound at a concentration of 50 M. data are represented as the means standard deviations (SDs) from at least two independent experiments. the antiviral effects of digoxin and ouabain against two JEV strains were assessed by qRT-PCR. the cell culture supernatants were collected to perform the plaque assay. a time-of-addition experiment was performed to determine the cellular process that these drugs target. neither digoxin nor ouabain showed suppression of JEV in virucidal treatments or pretreatments. but both ouabain and digoxin exerted full inhibitory effects on JEV infection. infected cells were treated with DMSO and two compounds in the presence of increasing NaCl and KCl. two compounds inhibited JEV in a dose-responsive manner. the results confirm that both ouabain and digoxin exert the antiviral effect. limb paralysis, restriction of movement, piloerection, body stiffening, and whole-body tremor at day 5 postinfection. all mice in the vehicle-treated group succumbed to the infection. the results suggest that ouabain provides effective protection against JEV-induced mortality. ouabain treatment significantly reduced viral load in infected mice. no plaques formed in the ouabain-treated group on day 21 postinfection. damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, and vacuolar degeneration, was observed. a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.8, and an endpoint of 24 h postinfection. the signal-to-basal ratio, coefficient of variation (CV), and Z factor were 2,177, 8.9%, and 0.72 respectively. an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)-based HCS assay was performed by screening a library of 1,034 natural extracts. a library of 1,034 natural extracts for primary candidates inhibiting JEV infection. each dot represents the percent inhibition achieved with each compound at a concentration of 50 M. data are represented as the means standard deviations (SDs) from at least two independent experiments. oxin and ouabain against two JEV strains in Huh-7 cells and U251 cells. the cell culture supernatants were collected to perform the plaque assay. data are represented as the means SDs from at least three independent experiments. time-of-addition experiment and JEV reporter replicon assay of the antiviral activities of ouabain and digoxin. the inhibitory effects of digoxin and ouabain with the indicated concentration in each group were determined by plaque assay. ouabain and digoxin exert the antiviral effect by targeting the Na+/K+-ATPase. vero cells infected with JEV AT31 were treated with increasing concentrations of NaCl (A and C) and KCl (B and D) at 1 h preinfection. ouabain protects mice from JEV-induced mortality. mice were infected with 1 106 PFU of JEV together with ouabain or vehicle. survival of mice in each group was monitored for 21 days. viral loads of brain, blood, and spleen were also evaluated at the early stage of infection. ouabain had little effect on decreasing viral titers in the blood and spleen. titers in the blood decreased sharply from day 1 to day 3 postinfection. our high-content screening assay design could identify compounds that inhibit JEV viral entry, translation, and RNA synthesis. eight hit compounds with SI indexes greater than 10 were found to exert inhibitory effects on JEV. lycorine, emodin, and procyanidin have been proven to be effective in inhibiting flavivirus or HCV infections via different mechanisms (16\u201320) cardiac glycoside acts via inhibiting the sodium-potassium ion pump. changes in intracellular concentration of sodium, potassium, and calcium have been shown to play essential roles in many cellular biosynthetic signaling and vesicular sorting pathways. ATPase is a promising pharmacological target in JEV infection. ATPase is a promising pharmacological target in JEV infection. ability was detected at different times (24 to 72 h) after JEV inoculation. the appropriate cell density, infective dose, and assay endpoint were selected. 10 M manidipine and 0.5% DMSO were used as positive and negative controls. the cells were stained with DyLight 488-labeled antibody to rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) nine fields per well were imaged on an Operetta high-content imaging system. the percentages of infected and DAPI-positive cells were calculated using the associated Harmony 3.5 software. in vitro transcripts were synthesized from linearized JEV replicon. in vitro transcripts were synthesized from linearized cDNA clone. in vitro transcripts were synthesized from linearized JEV replicon. mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a dose of 1 106 PFU JEV (AT31) mice were normalized to DMSO-treated cells for at least triplicate repeat experiments. the hematoxylin-eosin staining protocol was followed for tissue staining. a value of P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. all animal experimental procedures were carried out according to ethical guidelines. cell viability was detected at different times (24 to 72 h) after JEV inoculation. the appropriate cell density, infective dose, and assay endpoint were selected. 10 M manidipine and 0.5% DMSO were used as positive and negative controls. the cells were stained with DyLight 488-labeled antibody to rabbit IgG. nuclei were counterstained by DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) nine fields per well were imaged on an Operetta high-content imaging system. in vitro transcripts were synthesized from linearized JEV replicon using a T7 mMessage mMachine kit. in vitro transcripts were synthesized from linearized JEV replicon. luciferase activity was measured using the Rluc assay system.
