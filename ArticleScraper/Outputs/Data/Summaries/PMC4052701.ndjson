{"summary": "corrosive chemicals may be improperly selected and used in the event of potential international epidemics such as influenza or SARS. thermal inactivation of biological microbes is a well-known physical procedure that applies to both food sterilization and decontamination of inanimate objects. thermal inactivation of biological microbes is a well-known physical procedure that applies to both sterilization and decontamination of inanimate objects. several manuscripts have been published describing thermal inactivation of Bacillus spores. three variables to control thermal decontamination are time, temperature and water content. adaptation of these variables may be less damaging to materials compared to application of corrosive chemicals. B. anthracis Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores were selected for decontamination testing that measured decontamination on greater than 2,500 tests and controls with 7 logs of spores per test. the objective is to mathematically describe the effectiveness of hot, humid air decontamination using first or second order polynomial surfaces. this threshold was selected because it is a requirement for the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense. a substrate was defined as an individual coupon, polypropylene or wet sample. each substrate was cut into 22 centimeter squares except polypropylene. spores were dried inside 50 ml conical tubes for polypropylene tests. temperature and relative humidity was set at 60\u00b0C, 60% relative humidity. final conditions for time were 1, 4, and 7 days. each temperature/relative humidity combination was above the dew point to prevent condensation. 1,330 independent tests and 1,330 independent room temperature controls for the entire study. wet spore controls were exposed to specified temperature, relative humidity and time. after decontamination, spores were extracted in ten ml of extraction medium. k ij x i x j (1) are most commonly used in RSM because they are flexible in describing data in which there is curvature. an experiment is first done to screen potential predictor variables. supplementary runs are done to fit a second order model. 0 1 0 68.3 60 4 1 18 0 0 1 68.3 75 1 1 19 0 0 1 68.3 75 7 1 17 0 1 0 68.3 90 4 1 15 1 0 0 76.7 75 4 1. the codes were transformed to the coded variables, x1, x2 and x3. if a group of terms was deemed significant, all terms from that group were kept in the model (Lenth [2009]). a blocking variable, b, was included in each model since the observations were gathered in two phases. each model was subjected to diagnostic measures consisting of the F-test for lack of fit, examination of raw residuals and jackknifed residuals. each substrate was cut into 22 centimeter squares except polypropylene. the highest (strongest) selected combination of conditions was expected to result in complete spore inactivation. temperatures of 140, 155 and 170 \u00b0F were selected, then converted to Celsius. final conditions for time were 1, 4, and 7 days. each temperature/relative humidity combination was above the dew point to prevent condensation. 1,330 independent tests and 1,330 independent room temperature controls for the entire study. wet spore controls were exposed to specified temperature, relative humidity and time. after decontamination, spores were extracted in ten ml of extraction medium. an experiment is first done to screen potential predictor variables. the method of steepest ascent can be used to find the optimum. in other situations, the region of operability is the entire experimental region. x1 = T 68. 3 8. 3 x 2 = RH 75 15 and x 3 = D 4. the measured response, p(x1, x2, x3), was the proportion of spores inactivated divided by the average number of spores tested. each model was subjected to diagnostic measures consisting of the F-test for lack of fit, examination of raw residuals and jackknifed residuals vs. fitted values. results In the sections that follow equations were fitted for each strain/substrate combination and graphically compare the two strains when possible. the fitted equation for inactivation of B. anthracis Sterne is = 17.5984 0.7847b + 6.7224x1 + 6.2954x2 + 6.7968x3 2.6850x1x2 3.4490x1x3 2.8576x2x3 3.6926x21 3.3049x22 2.7348x23, where is the log odds of spore inactivation.
