{"summary": "influenza is an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract caused by influenza type A, B, and C viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family. the periodic emergence of novel influenza strains can result in widespread pandemics capable of extensive morbidity and mortality. the vast majority of reported cases have been mild and self-limiting [4]\u2013[6]; typical symptoms have included fever, sore throat, malaise, and headache [7] IL-6 is the chief mediator of the acute phase response and fever [14]. IL-6 has been implicated in the cytokine storm following avian influenza A H5N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection [16]\u2013[18]. IL-6 levels have been associated with symptom duration and severity in cases of seasonal influenza infection. a total of 45 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm infection were included in our analysis. IL-6 levels associated strongly with disease severity in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection. human clinical data implicated IL-6 in H1N1pdm infection. we infected three mouse strains, C57BL/6J mice (n = 17), BALB/cJ mice (n = 17), and B6129SF2/J mice (n = 17), intransally with 104 EID50. survival curves for C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice infected intranasally with 104 EID50 A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) n = 11 for all three groups. the two-tailed, two-sample unequal variances Student\u2019s t-test was used to ascertain significance (p-value 0.05 = *, p-value 0.01 = **, p-value 0.001 = ***) no significant differences were seen among the mouse groups on day 3. levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were also increased following infection, with no significant differences between groups. results revealed similar disease severity in C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J H1N1pdm infected mice. further, increased IL-6 expression was consistently observed in all groups, suggesting an important role in host responses across mice of different genetic expression levels of interferon response genes increased early and subsequently stabilized by day 3 pi. inflammatory response gene expression levels increased more gradually and stabilized later than day 3 pi. two-tailed, two-sample unequal variances Student\u2019s t-test was used to ascertain significance (p-value 0.05 = *, p-value 0.01 = **) associated genes as determined by IPA were investigated. early in infection, downstream signalling machinery, mostnotably IL-6 binding receptor subunit alpha (Il6ra) and intracellular signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), were upregulated. IL-6 signalling were upregulated early and throughout infection. expression status of genes associated with the acute phase response was assessed. multiple functional classifications were used to identify functionally related gene networks from all 7,803 probes. pdm and mouse models of IL-6 implicated IL-6 in host response to infection. abrogation of IL-6 would reduce symptom severity and improve clinical outcome. IL-6 wild-type mice (n = 22) and IL-6/ mice (n = 34) both showed severe illness following infection. survival curves for IL-6 wild-type (closed squares) and IL-6/ (open squares) mice infected intranasally with 104 EID50 A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) n = 34 for IL-6/ mice and n = 22 for IL-6 wild-type mice. 106.9 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)50/g for IL-6 wild-type and IL-6/ mice. differences in viral loads were not statistically distinguishable ( = 0.05), although IL-6/ mice did exhibit slightly lower viral loads. levels of IL-6 (log10 IL-6 (pg/mL) adjusted by age and sex were significantly associated with increased risk of fatal outcome. IL-6 levels associated strongly with disease severity in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection. s in weight were observed as of day 3 post-infection (pi) through to days 7\u20138 pi. final percent survival was 36.4% (4/11), 18.2% (2/11), and 0% (0/11) for C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice. the assay had a limit of detection of 101.75 TCID50/g of lung tissue. results are expressed as fold changes over expression in uninfected day 0 pi controls. vertical error bars indicate +1 standard deviation (Ci&ii) levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were also increased following infection. levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were also increased following infection, with no significant differences between groups. RNA extraction and subsequent analysis of gene expression data identified 7,803 probes for significantly differentially regulated genes. hierarchical clustering by Pearson\u2019s correlation revealed several groups of co-ordinately expressed genes. cell growth and metabolism cluster was characterized by a gradual decline in gene expression over the course of infection. expression data of genes associated with IL-6 signalling profiled over the course of infection. overlaid colors represent gene regulation status; upregulated genes are red, downregulated genes are blue. color intensity correlates with the magnitude of change in gene expression (Bii) mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (Mapk3) and serum response factor (Srf) were persistently downregulated throughout infection. IL-6 has diverse functions, among which is positive regulation of the acute phase response [14] IL-6 Deficiency does not Significantly Impact H1N1pdm Infection Outcome in mice. IL-6 Deficiency does not significantly impact H1N1pdm infection in mice. IL-6/ mice tended to lose weight faster than IL-6 wild-type mice. weight loss was observed until days 6\u20137 pi, followed by a recovery phase. of the surviving mice, weight loss was observed until days 6\u20137 pi. Lung tissue collected at day 3 pi. n = 3 for IL-6/ mice and n = 3 for IL-6 wild-type mice. vertical error bars indicate +1 standard deviation. inflammatory mediator IL-6 has been implicated in both avian influenza A and SARS-induced cytokine storms [16]\u2013[18], [33], and from our data in humans we hypothesized that IL-6 would have a similar damaging role during severe H1N1pdm infection. we investigated IL-6 levels in three mouse strains infected with H1N1pdm. Previously, Otte et al. reported that BALB/cJ mice were less susceptible than C57BL/6J mice to H1N1pdm infection. however, we found that C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice were similarly susceptible to H1N1pdm infection. our findings implicated IL-6 in the host response to H1N1pdm in mice. IL-6-mediated inflammatory response genes were prominently upregulated. IL-6 protein levels were elevated in mice infected with 104 EID50. IL-6/ mice were not protected during H1N1pdm infection. IL-1 and TNF- signalling are negatively regulated by IL-6. this could explain why IL-6/ mice were not protected. IL-6 deficiency did not impact disease outcome in C57BL/6J mice. but the consistent association of IL-6 with severe disease suggests host response elements that contribute to disease may be regulated by a common upstream event. further investigation is critical to elucidate the role of IL-6 as a disease severity marker in influenza, specifically severe H1N1pdm. IL-6 deficiency in mice had no significant bearing on any of the clinical manifestations studied. study suggests IL-6 may serve as an important biomarker for the identification of patients at risk of severe complications following H1N1pdm infection. qRT-PCR using either the Influenza A (H1N1) MGB Detection Assay from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA, USA) or the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set from Roche\u00ae (Basel, Switzerland) 45 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm were enrolled in the study. mice were kept on standard animal feed and water ad libitum in clean environmental conditions. animals were housed in HEPA-filtered cage racks adherent to ABSL2+ conditions. all animal procedures were performed in a certified class II biosafety cabinet. mice (n = 3) were euthanized and lung homogenates collected for viral load determination. lungs were homogenized (10% w/v) in DMEM supplement. qRT-PCR was performed using the ABI-Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection Systems. each reaction well contained 0.25 L of 20 ng/uL cDNA, 0.5 L each of forward and reverse primers, for a total reaction volume of 10 uL. time series analysis was performed with Extraction of Differential Gene Expression (EDGE) software. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was employed to assess the occurrence of false positives. both age and sex were identified as confounding variables. the Student\u2019s t-test ( = 0.05) was used to identify statistically significant increases in expression of genes assayed by qRT-PCR. only those patients with confirmed H1N1pdm by qRT-PCR were included in the study. a total of 45 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm were enrolled. female C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, B6129SF2/J, and B6.129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J (IL-6/) mice (8\u201310 weeks of age) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, MN, USA) and used in influenza studies. Virus dosage was 1105 EID50 for host response profiling in C57BL/6J mice and 1104 EID50 for comparing disease severity between C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice. animals were euthanized when recorded body weight fell below 80% of original body weight. 50% of wells were positive for viral infection. limit of detection of 101.75 TCID50/g. lung tissues and serum were collected for cytokine measurement (n = 3 for each) cRNA (1.5 g) was labelled and hybridized to MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and scanned on Illumina BeadStation 500GX. raw data was collected with Illumina GenomeStudio V2010.3 software. microarray expression data are available in the MIAME-compliant Gene Expression Omnibus database. serum IL-6 levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. both age and sex were identified as confounding variables. vertical error bars indicate 1 standard deviation for the average weight at each time point. table S1 Increased expression of acute inflammatory response genes in C57BL/6J mice infected with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm)"}
