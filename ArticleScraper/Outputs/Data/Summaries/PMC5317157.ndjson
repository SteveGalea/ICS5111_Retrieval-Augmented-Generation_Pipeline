{"summary": "compared to community participants with ARI, inpatients were older, more likely to be male and to have chronic medical conditions. historical-FLU participants with medical indications were fairly similar to those who were admitted for public health and medical indications for admission. aARI: episode with acute onset with any key respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or runny nose. aARI: episode with acute onset with any key respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or runny nose. one hundred and thirty episodes were reported from 99 community participants (community-ARI) there were no co-infections detected by MRT-PCR in either community-ARI episodes or influenza negative inpatient-ARI episodes. 5 influenza positive inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for more than one pathogen, including 4 dual-pathogen (influenza A + influenza B [2], influenza A + rhinovirus, and influenza B + respiratory syncytial virus) non-influenza mono-infection episodes in community-ARI and inpatient-ARI compared to 46.2% for community-ARI. cFor inpatient-ARI, this excludes 5 episodes where there was a co-infection between influenza and non-influenza viruses on MRT-PCR. MRT-PCR detected influenza in only 70.8% of the samples that were positive for influenza by SRT-PCR. the proportion positive by either assay decreased as days post-onset increased for both the community and inpatient samples. inpatient-ARI had a higher starting Ct value than community-ARI. patients 0.58 0.32, 0.83 0.001 aGeneralized Estimating Equation model. included participants type (community cohort or inpatient), days post episode onset, age, gender, comorbidities. comorbidities included diabetes, asthma, COPD, heart disease, cancer and other significant conditions. clinical features of historical-FLU admitted for public health indications were fairly similar to influenza cases identified amongst community-ARI. clinical features of historical-FLU admitted for public health indications were fairly similar to influenza cases identified amongst community-ARI, which justified grouping them together as mild-ARI. 0.001 T 37.8 \u00b0C 62 (31.8) 50 (66.7) 7 (11.7) 5 (8.3) 0.001 T 38.0 \u00b0C 51 (26.2) 41 (54.7) 6 (10.0) 4 (6.7) 0.001 FRId 109 (55.9) 70 (93.3) 22 (36.7) 17 (28.3) 0.001 ILI-Ue 61 (31.3) 49 (65.3) 7 (11.7) 5 (8.3) 0.001 ILI-Wf 46 (23.6 bCombines the community-ARI and the historical-FLU with public health indications cCombines the inpatient-ARI and the historical-FLU with medical indications dFRI: ARI with self-reported fever, regardless of body temperature (T) measurement eILI-U: ILI as defined by world health organization, i.e. fever of 38 \u00b0Cplus cough with onset within the last 10 days. discriminating influenza from other causes of ARI in mild-ARI (A) and severe-ARI (C) and discriminating infections positive for any MRT-PCR panel viruses from samples negative by MRT-PCR for mild-ARI (B) and severe-ARI (D) there were insufficient numbers of mild-ARI with age 60 years for age-stratified analysis. 60 years Influenza Non-influenza P value Influenza Non-influenza P value Influenza Non-influenza P value Influenza Non-influenza P value n = 74 n = 112 \u2014 n = 70 n = 43 \u2014 n = 39 n = 51 \u2014 Cough 66 (89.2) 98 (87.5) 0.819 68 (97.1) 42 (97.7) 1.000 39 (100) 51 (100) 1.000 So 5 influenza positive inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for more than one pathogen. 46 inpatient-ARI episodes were positive only for one influenza type/subtype. only 24 inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for non-influenza panel viruses. non-influenza mono-infection episodes in community-ARI and inpatient-ARI episodesVirus identified. inpatient-ARI, this excludes 5 episodes where there was a co-infection between influenza and non-influenza viruses.

PCR-based assays may still be relevant for detecting influenza amongst inpatients that present late but less so for community-ARI episodes with delayed presentations. the PathChip may add value for respiratory virus detection in samples negative by multiplex RT-PCR, but only for community-ARI. we intentionally oversampled influenza to obtain a ratio of approximately 1 influenza positive to 2 influenza negative patients. additional swabs were taken on days 3 to 5 and days 7 to 9 post-onset (community-ARI) or post-enrolment (inpatient-ARI) for influenza positive episodes where possible. ARI patients with medical indications were admitted alongside ARI cases referred to TTSH for public health indications. influenza A positive specimens were then subtyped with subtype specific primers and probes that targeted at haemagglutinin (HA) gene of A(H3N2)3, and HA and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of A(H1N1)pdm0930. cycle threshold (Ct) values were documented for positive samples. inpatient-ARI was grouped with historical-FLU cases admitted for medical indications. this increased the number of influenza cases available for evaluating the discriminatory value of clinical parameters and case definitions. inpatient-ARI was grouped with historical-FLU cases admitted for medical indications. for community-ARI, this was assumed to be what was obtained in ARI samples from the community cohort. the proportion positive for influenza was estimated based on the proportion positive for influenza from routinely ordered tests of ARI admissions to TTSH (Adjusted_FLU), which was then applied to derive the adjusted (Adjusted_Non-FLU) from the crude proportion (Crude_Non-FLU) positive for non-influenza viruses detected in MRT- nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from consenting inpatients. swabs were taken on days 3 to 5 and days 7 to 9 post-onset (community-ARI) or post-enrolment (inpatient-ARI) for influenza positive episodes where possible. a prospective study of admissions to TTSH testing positive for influenza between may 2009 and September 2009 (historical-FLU) cycle threshold (Ct) values were documented for positive samples. influenza A positive specimens were then subtyped with subtype specific primers and probes that targeted at haemagglutinin (HA) gene of A(H3N2)3, and HA and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of A(H1N1)pdm0930. the protocols had been adopted from the studies by Spackman et al.28 and Krafft et al.29 and, respectively, with cycle threshold (Ct) values documented for positive samples. influenza A positive specimens were then subtyped with subtype specific primers and probes that targeted at haemagglutinin (HA) gene of A(H3N2)3, and HA and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of A(H1N1)pdm0930 compared the ability of SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR to detect influenza in terms of days post-onset and Ct values. a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was applied to evaluate the effect of study population and days post-onset on the Ct values. the proportion of episodes fulfilling different criteria was compared by viral pathogen status (influenza viruses, non-influenza panel viruses and negative) we then investigated the discriminatory performance by calculating the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for positive detection of influenza and any viral infection."}
