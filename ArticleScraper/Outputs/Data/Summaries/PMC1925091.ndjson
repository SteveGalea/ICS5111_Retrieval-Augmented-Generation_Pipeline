{"summary": "the ACE3 gene is located on the same chromosome downstream of the ACE gene. in mouse, rat, cow and dog, the predicted protein has mutations in some of the critical residues involved in catalysis. in humans, the predicted protein has an intact HEXXH motif. ACE regulates blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis. inhibitors of ACE, such as captopril and lisinopril, are front line therapeutics in a range of cardiovascular disorders. ACE exists in two forms as a result of alternative use of promoters within the same gene. the gene encoding ACE2 is located on the X chromosome. ACE2 acts as a carboxypeptidase removing single amino acids from the substrates. ACE2 is also the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae there are 9 genes which code for proteins with similarity to mammalian ACE [19], while in caenorhabditis elegans there is a single ACE-like gene which encodes a protein that is predicted to be catalytically inactive. in humans, no evidence that the ACE3 gene is expressed and the presence of deletions in the sequence indicate that in humans ACE3 is a pseudogene. in murine ACE3, the HEMGH zinc binding motif characteristic of other members of the ACE family was HQMGH (Fig. 1). predicted ACE3 sequences were identified also in the rat, dog and cow genomes. neither the cow nor dog ACE3 predicted sequences contain an N-terminal signal peptide, although the rat ACE3 predicted sequence does. the predicted murine ACE3 protein sequence was mapped onto the genomic DNA and the intron-exon boundaries determined. the murine ACE3 gene contains 13 exons, interspersed with 12 introns, spans 10.7 kb and is located 5.5 kb downstream of the ACE gene. codon phase 1 264 1\u2013264 catgGTGTGGT 385 CAGctgc 0 2 159 265\u2013423 agagGTGACAG 261 CAGtaca 0 3 88 424\u2013511 gcctGGTGAGCA 118 CAGACctcc 1 4 144 512\u2013655 taatGGTAAGTG 740 TAGGAtaca 1 5 192 656\u2013847 cct RT-PCR analysis of ACE3 mRNA expression in various murine tissues. a transcript encoding ACE3 was detected in testis, heart and embryo. but not in a range of other tissues, including, kidney, lung, and liver. amide side chain atoms involved in hydrogen bonding to two neighbouring residues. asp415 to ser affects zinc binding by interfering with the hydrogen bond network to His383. murine ACE3 model superimposed on human testicular ACE structure. the ancestral ACE3 is compared to three known ACE transcripts. exons 28, 31 and 35 are not part of ACE3 (non-ACE like exons) exons 1, 4 and part of exon 2 are spliced out in the isoform 3 transcript. the ancestral ACE3 gene is predicted to contain at least 14 exons. all of the predicted intron-exon junction sequences follow the GT/GA rule. hydropathy analysis and transmembrane prediction revealed two hydrophobic regions at the C-terminus. the human ACE3 gene sequence, however, has several frame shifts and premature stop codons. predicted amino acid sequence of murine ACE3 exhibits significant homology to existing members of the ACE family. the predicted amino acid sequence of murine ACE3 exhibits significant homology to existing members of the ACE family. the predicted amino acid sequence of murine ACE3 exhibits significant homology. the predicted ACE3 genes in rat, rat, mouse and cow are also located on the same chromosome as ACE. the predicted ACE3 genes in rat, dog and cow are also located on the same chromosome as ACE. no other hit exists with an e-value of less than 0.01. no further closely related homologue of ACE3 other than ACE and ACE2 in the mouse genome. expression of mRNA encoding ACE3 was examined in several murine tissues. RT-PCR using selective primers was performed on a panel of total RNA samples. a transcript encoding ACE3 was detected in testis, heart and embryo. the predicted murine ACE3 sequence was modelled on the C-terminal domain of human somatic ACE. however, several substitutions occur in the ACE3 predicted active site. most significant substitution is unquestionably Glu384 to Gln that replaces the catalytic Glu in HEXXH zinc binding motif. a loop missing in testicular ACE is modelled in red. a loop missing in testicular ACE is modelled in red. ACE3 can be partly reconstructed from the ACE isoform 3 transcript. individual ACE3 exons are identical to isoform 3 except for exons 2 and 11. exons 28, 31 and 35 are not part of ACE3 (non-ACE like exons) exons 1, 4 and part of exon 2 are spliced out in isoform 3 transcript. RT-PCR was used in an attempt to identify potential mRNA transcripts of human ACE3. however, RT-PCR using various primer sets failed to identify a transcript. the specificity of the primers was checked by using them to PCR genomic DNA extracted from Hek293 cells from which they amplified a band of the predicted size that correspond to the sequence of ACE3. ACE3 affects zinc binding by interfering with the hydrogen bond network to the first histidine residue in the HEXXH zinc binding motif. this residue is conserved among vertebrate ACEs and in other metalloproteases, corresponding to Asp650 in neprilysin (M13 family) and asp170 in thermolysin (M4 family). ACE3 in mouse, rat, cow and dog ACE3 will not be functional as a prote GH X X X X Cow 738 HQMGH X refers to restored ancestral sequence. several members have subtle or more complete mutation of the HEXXH motif. in ADAM4 the Glu is mutated to Ala, while in ADAM29 it is His. non-processed pseudogenes are often silenced by point mutations, insertions or deletions, as seen in human ACE3. this 'pseudogenization' of genes in humans results in the human degradome containing only 561 functional genes, while the mouse degradome is larger with 641 genes. ACE3 gene being located downstream of the ACE gene in all five genomes analysed may reflect an evolutionary relationship. in humans ACE3 would lack catalytic activity as a zinc metalloprotease. this lack of expression, along with the presence of deletions and insertions, indicate that in humans ACE3 is a pseudogene. RT-PCR was performed with a one step Titanium RT-PCR kit (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) with 1 g of RNA and the appropriate forward and reverse primers at 50 pmol/l. for human ACE3 the primers were forward 5'-GTGGGCCGCTCTCTAGGCACCAA-3' and reverse 5'-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCGATTTC-3'. transmembrane and signal peptide regions were predicted using TMpred [41] and SignalP [42] respectively. reverse transcription-PCR Human and murine total RNA was from Ambion (Europe) Ltd.
