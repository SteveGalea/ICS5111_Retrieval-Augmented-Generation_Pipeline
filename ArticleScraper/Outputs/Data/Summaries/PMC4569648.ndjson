{"summary": "training lasts 8.5 weeks, with 6000\u20137000 recruits present at any given time. the population is approximately 80% male. Ill or injured trainees present for care at an outpatient medical clinic. rhinitis, conjunctivitis, otitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, sore throat were considered representative of URTI vs lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) the terms \"bronchitis, pneumonia\" were not included in the URTI vs LRTI analysis. influenza respiratory viruses, enterovirus and rhinovirus thermocycling conditions were 30 minutes at 50\u00b0C, 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C, followed by 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 35 seconds at 60\u00b0C for 45. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes, and bocavirus thermocycling conditions were 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C followed by 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C for 45. Ill or injured trainees present for care at an outpatient medical clinic. those with respiratory illness and fever are then cohorted until well enough to return to training. influenza vaccine against pdm09H1N1 influenza was available and administered after December 1, 2009. rhinitis, conjunctivitis, otitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, sore throat were not included in the URTI vs LRTI analysis. terms including \u201ccommon cold\u201d, \u201cviral syndrome\u201d, \u201cfever\u201d or \u201ccough\u201d were not included in the URTI vs LRTI analysis given their lack of anatomical description. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes, and bocavirus thermocycling conditions were 10 minutes at 48\u00b0C, 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C, followed by 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 1 minute at 60\u00b0C for 45. Statistical analysis analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS), version 19.0, SPSS. the male predominance of enrolled subjects decreased from 89% to 79% (P.01) the male predominance of enrolled subjects decreased from 89% to 79% (P.01) from June 2008 to August 2013, Pre-VI and Post-VI Total (n = 2660) Pre-VI (n = 1906) Post-VI (n = 754) P Value Age (years, IQR) 20 (19, 22) 20 (19, 22) 20 (19, 22) 20 (19, 22) one or more diagnoses representative or URI, LRTI, or both, were present in 64.3% pre-VI and 74.5% post-VI. terms associated with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were more commonly included post-VI (26.1% vs 12.9%, P.01) and terms associated with URI were less commonly included post-VI (79.0% vs 89.5%, P.01) throat 2659 1663 (87.3%) 654 (86.7%).70 Sinus congestion 2656 1492 (78.4%) 660 (87.5%).01 Coryza 2658 1221 (64.1%) 590 (78.2%).01 Malaise 2654 1111 (58.4%) 377 (50.0%).01 Vomiting 2658 297 (15.6%) 64 (8.5%).01 Diarrhea 2656 211 (11.1%) 42 (5.6%).01 Conjunctivitis rhinovirus accounted for the largest proportion of these (n = 24), with influenza detected in 7 cases and any Ad in 5 (4 serotype 4, 1 serotype 3). the rate of detection of rhinovirus doubled in the post-VI period; an increase in raw numbers of rhinovirus positive enrollments per month was also seen. 42/1778 (69.9%) 9/754 (1.2%).01 7 92/1182 (7.8%) 0/754 (0%).01 3 16/1060 (1.5%) 1/754 (0.1%).01 11 0/793 (0%) 0/754 (0%) 21 0/1013 (0%) 0/754 (0%) 2 0/25 (0%) 4/630 (0.63%) 1.0 5 0/25 (0%) 7/741 (9.4%) 1.0 Rhinovirus 335 no pathogen identified 260/1906 (15.6%) 383 /754 (50.8%).01 Any coinfection 198/1906 (15.6%) 33/754 (4.4%).01 Abbreviations: C, Chlamydophila; M, Mycoplasma; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; S, Streptococcus; pneumoniae; VI, vaccine introduction. b Bocavirus testing had been exploratory and was discontinued shortly post-VI after low rates of detection. large outbreaks of pharyngitis caused by S. pyogenes have been reported in the past century, prompting widespread use of antimicrobial prophylaxis at training sites. others, including Neisseria meningitidis, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae, have been well-described in this population [27] pharyngitis is distinct from the afebrile, coryza/cough presentations of those presenting post-VI and with rhinovirus. the predominant organism identified among these was rhinovirus. despite a relatively broad panel of respiratory pathogens targeted with molecular methods, >50% post-VI had no pathogen detected. dozens of additional Ad serotypes and other respiratory viral pathogens have been identified. bocavirus and human metapneumovirus have been identified. the decrease in frequency of influenza A was driven by the unusually high number of influenza A cases in 2009. the most significant strength of the study is the collection of a wide array of respiratory pathogen data alongside a detailed collection of clinical and demographic data. other limitations include the high uptake of Ad vaccine, consistency in access to care, living and training conditions, and preventive medicine measures throughout the study period. acute respiratory illness has transitioned from a febrile pharyngitis to a predominantly afebrile coryza and cough illness. no evidence of Ad serotype shift has been demonstrated. rhinovirus is emerging as a potential pathogen of importance."}
