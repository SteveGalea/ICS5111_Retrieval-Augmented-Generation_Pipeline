{"summary": "TEXT Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae, together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). we recently discovered two novel SHFV variants in a male red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) from Kibale de novo assembly of sequence reads yielded complete SHFV coding genomes from three individuals (two females, RT05 and RT11, and one male, RT10). a fourth nearly complete SHFV coding genome was recovered from another individual, RT09. all four new viruses from red-tailed guenons contain two large replicase-encoding ORFs and several smaller downstream ORFs. the new viral genomes contain three ORFs, 2a, 2b, and 3, immediately downstream of the replicase. the viruses from individuals RT05 and RT11 were similar to each other at the nucleotide level. phylogeny is consistent with established relationships of arteriviruses (8, 20, 21) and supporting the monophyly of SHFV variants. new viruses are highly divergent from the prototype variant and from SHFV variants found in sympatric red colobus (8, 22). other viruses represent the known diversity within each viral species based on available full-genome sequences. phylogenetic divergence between SHFV and red-tailed guenons is approximately equivalent to that between PRRSV and LDV, currently assigned to different viral species. s in both red-tailed guenons and red colobus may indicate ancient diversification of SHFV within sympatric host species. the unique 3\u2032 genomic architecture of SHFV is conserved even across highly divergent SHFV variants."}
