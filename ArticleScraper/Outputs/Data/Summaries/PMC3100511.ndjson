{"summary": "dengue-2 strain, 16681, was grown in C6/36 cells, vero cells, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. cell-free supernatants were used either neat or after concentration by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. the virus pellet was resuspended in 1.5% fetal bovine serum. CD14+ monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 20 ng/mL rhuGM\u2013CSF (First Link) and 25 ng/mL rhuIL-4 (eBioscience) the appropriate phenotype of immature DC (ie, lacking CD14+ but expressing major histocompatibility complex class I and class II and DC-SIGN) was confirmed. monitoring deNV infection Cells were infected with DENV at pcDNA3-lL-SIGN plasmids expressing 7 (N7) and 5 (N5) tandem neck region repeats or a mixture of N7 and N5 plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using the Fugene6 (Roche) dengue-2 strain, 16681, was grown in C6/36 cells, vero cells, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) cell-free supernatants were used either neat or after concentration by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. the virus pellet was resuspended in 1.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS/Leibovitz L-15) CD14+ monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 20 ng/mL rhuGM\u2013CSF (First Link) and 25 ng/mL rhuIL-4 (eBioscience) the appropriate phenotype of immature DC (ie, lacking CD14+ but expressing major histocompatibility complex class I and class II and DC-SIGN) was confirmed. monitoring deNV infection Cells were infected with DENV at pcDNA3-lL-SIGN plasmids expressing 7 (N7) and 5 (N5) tandem neck region repeats or a mixture of N7 and N5 plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using the Fugene6 (Roche). RESULTS DENV Produced in Insect Cells But Not in DCs Can Infect DCs Following the bite from an infected mosquito, the host first encounters virus produced in the mosquito. compared viruses from C6/36 (insect cells) and virus produced from primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. at 24, 48, and 72 h, cells were intracellularly stained with anti-NS1 mAb (2G6) and analyzed by flow cytometry. the results are shown as mean SE from 4 independent experiments. the lack of infectivity of DC-produced virus on DCs was also shown using a different mAb, 4G2. DEN-4 H241, and DEN-2 NGC derived from either DCs or C6/36 cells. at 24 and 48 h, cells were intracellularly stained with anti-NS1 mAb. D, vero cells and DCs were incubated with a mixture of C6/36-produced and DC-produced DENV. DC-produced virus selectively infects via L-SIGN. insect-derived virus could efficiently infect both DC-SIGN\u2013 and L-SIGN\u2013expressing cells compared with control 3T3 cells. dengue infection and binding data shown in panels B\u2013D for L-SIGN were derived by gating the L-SIGN\u2013positive population. previous reports with dengue virus suggest that the virus shows equal tropism for both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. dengue produced in DC contained complex glycans. DC-, Vero-, and C6/36-produced DENV were run on 10% SDS Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by western blotting. lectin binding signals occurred at the same position on the gels as E protein in the region of 60 kDa. we did not see any signal at 19 kDa where prM would be expected to migrate. this could be due to a low level of prM on these viruses. heterogeneity of L-SIGN neck lengths has no effect on DENV infection. a tandem repeat in its neck region, N-terminal to the carbohydrate recognition domain, can be of variable length between 3 and 9 repeats. previous studies have suggested that heterogeneity in the tandem repeat region may contribute to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) susceptibility. 293T cells were transfected with L-SIGN constructs expressing 5 or 7 repeats. cells were stained with anti\u2013L-SIGN and 4G2 to reveal dengue-infected cells. data are representative of 2 independent experiments. infection was detected by intracellular staining with anti-NS1 mAb (2G6).
