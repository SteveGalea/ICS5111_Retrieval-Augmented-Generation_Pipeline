{"summary": "the chicken was considered the only natural host of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) but recently pheasants has been introduced as the other natural host for IBV. the disease is transmitted by the respiratory route, direct contact and indirectly through mechanical spread. the use of live attenuated and killed IBV vaccines is the most important preventive measure of the disease. but anti-genically different serotypes and newly emerged variants from field chicken flocks sometimes cause vaccine breaks. a virus similar to the european 793/B type was isolated in Iran in 1998. cDNA was immediately used in a PCR or stored at \u201320 C for later use. the resultant cDNA was immediately used in a PCR or stored at \u201320 C for later use. reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using spike gene primers. reaction was performed using 25 L reaction mixture containing 1 L dNTP (10 mM), 0.50 L of each primer (25 pmol L-1), 1 L MgCl2 (50 mM), 2.50 L 10X PCR buffer, 0.20 L Taq DNA Polymerase, 2.50 L cDNA and 16.80 L dH2O. Purified RT-PCR products were sequenced by aBI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) in a forward direction using primer SX3 and in a reverse direction using primer RX4. sequence similarities were analyzed by BLAST using the Neighbor-joining tree method. two different IB viruses (variant 2 and Mass) were detected in samples from two farms (13.3%), simultaneously. the detected variant 2 genotype in Bushehr demonstrated a high similarity to variant 2 as those reported from the Middle East. phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of the S1 glycoprotein gene, revealing that the sequences of the recent Iranian strains formed two main groups. the first group was subdivided into two subgroups. seven IBV field isolates showed 91.80% to 97.60% nucleotide sequence identity to IBV- strains Kurdistan-Sulaymania/12, Egypt/Beni-Suef/01, Turkey/ 10RS-3161/2010, IS/VAR2-06, variant 2, Eg/CLEVB-2/IBV/012 and Libya-06-2012. results showed 72.90% to 76.50%, 71.80% to 75.30% and 78 the implementation of nationwide genotyping of IBV strains is necessary to determine the distribution of virus genotypes. new serotypes or variant strains may emerge due to only a few changes in the amino acid sequence of the S1protein. therefore, the S1 gene of the isolates should be determined to differentiate field and vaccine isolates. circulating in the kurdistan region between 2010 to 2014.27. IR/7/2011, R/8/2011, and IR/9/2011 isolates formed separate branches in the phylogenetic tree (variant 2). their results indicated the circulation of 793/B with variant 2 in poultry flocks in Iraq. despite their use, diagnosis of IB in the vaccinated chickens is common. the results of this study may partially explain the failure of Massachusetts-type vaccines and therefore necessitates revising the Iranian vaccination strategy against infectious bronchitis. the results emphasize the need for new control strategies and re-arrangement of preventative measure of IBV in Bushehr, Iran."}
