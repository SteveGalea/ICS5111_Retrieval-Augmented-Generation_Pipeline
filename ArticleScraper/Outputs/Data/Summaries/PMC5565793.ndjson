{"summary": "NP/OP swabs from 70 children 5 years with CAP of unknown etiology. RNA-seq/PVG PCR detected previously missed, putative pathogens in 34% of patients. RNA-seq was more sensitive for RNA viruses whereas PVG PCR detected more DNA viruses. patients included if they lived in the catchment area and were hospitalized for CAP, defined as acute infection, acute respiratory illness, and radiographically confirmed pneumonia. exclusion criteria included recent hospitalization and severe immunosuppression. nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected within 72 hours of hospital admission. adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human metapneumovirus, human metapneumovirus, human influenza, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 [HPIV] and respiratory syncytial virus were detected. RNA Sequencing Nucleic Acid Extraction Nasopharyngeal and OP swabs (75\u2013200 L) were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. libraries were quantified with the Illumina Universal Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences) Viral taxa identified based on 100 reads were only considered if reads were not an identical match to any other sample within the same batch by manual analysis.

Viral taxa identified based on 100 reads were only considered if reads were not an identical match to any other sample within the same batch by manual analysis. PCR assays were designed to amplify known and potentially novel members of the viral families/genera listed below. viridae, orthomyxoviridae, parvoviridae, Picornaviridae (enterovirus and parechovirus; primers do not target all human rhinoviruses), polyomaviridae, Reoviridae, and Togaviridae (alphavirus) first- and second-round PCR for RNA viruses was performed with Hot Start Ex Taq kits (Takara) PCR assays were designed using consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) principle to conserve genes and regions. samples (5 l of total nucleic acid) were tested with broadly reactive PVG PCR. the Picornaviridae PCR targets only a subset of human rhinoviruses. first- and second-round PCR for DNA viruses was performed with Hot Start Ex Taq kits (Takara) Positive and negative PCR controls containing mutation-engineered synthetic RNA transcript or DNA amplicon and nuclease-free water were visualized on 2% agarose gels. RNA-seq and PVG PCR were analyzed by RNA-seq and PVG PCR. proportions of putative pathogens detected by each method individually or in combination were determined. sensitivity was lowest for adenovirus; RNA-seq did not detect any of the 8 ADV-positive samples. RNA sequencing detected HRV in 46 (92%) of 50 PCR-positive specimens.

HBoV was statistically more common than in control subjects. extensive testing using standard approaches is unable to identify a pathogen in approximately 20% of children and approximately 60% of adults. the 2 patients with measles virus detection did not show measles but had been vaccinated 7 days (positive by RNA-seq only) and 9 days (positive by RNA-seq and PVG PCR) before sample collection. the low number of sequencing reads precluded this by examining the complete viral genome. this strong association is in contrast with numerous PCR-based studies targeting viral genomic DNA [37, 40], suggesting that detection of HBoV mRNA may serve as a marker for acute (ie, clinically relevant) infections. our results suggest that HBoV may be associated with CAP and may be a true pathogen. human herpesviruses that can cause respiratory tract infections including pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts were more frequently detected in patients than control subjects. RNA sequencing is highly unbiased, demonstrated by the detection of divergent enteroviruses not identified by PVG PCR. in contrast, PVG PCR identified DNA viruses that were not detected by RNA-seq. this may have been due in part to shedding predominantly of viral particles (containing genomic DNA) with low levels of active replication (ie, production of mRNA) in the upper respiratory tract. a potential pathogen was still not detected in 46 children (65.7%) with CAP of our findings highlight the limits of etiologic diagnosis of CAP with noninvasive samples. further advancing the diagnosis of CAP is likely to require additional sampling as well as host-based markers of infectious processes that may help confirm infectious etiologies."}
