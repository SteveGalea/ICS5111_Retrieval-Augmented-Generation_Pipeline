{"summary": "coronavirus (SCoV) carries a large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. the 5\u2032-most two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames that encode two polyproteins. nsp1 of different CoVs employ different strategies to inhibit host gene expression. nsp1 induces RNA cleavage in nonviral capped mRNAs and mRNAs carrying picornavirus type I and type II internal ribosome entry sites. it does not induce the RNA cleavage in SCoV mRNAs and RNA transcripts carrying IRES of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or classical swine fever virus (12, 15) pCAGGS-nsp1-CD encodes nsp1 (16) by using a recombinant PCR-based method. insertion of nsp1-CD gene into pcDNA 3.1 HisA myc and pGEX vector resulted in generation of pcDNA-nsp1-CD. p1-mt were synthesized from linearized plasmids using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Ambion) p1-mt were synthesized from linearized plasmids using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Ambion) p1-mt were synthesized from the PCR products obtained from HCV16Luc plasmid, while other IRES-containing RNAs were subconfluent 293 cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with pRL-SV40 reporter plasmid (0.1 g/well) and pCAGGS-based plasmid expressing CAT, nsp1-wt, a biologically inactive nsp1 mutant, nsp1-mt, or nsp1-CD (0.4 g/well) at 30 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts were added to the RRL. in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts were added to the RRL. the samples were incubated for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. toeprinting assays performed as described previously (15, 17, 24), with minor modifications. sequence of 5\u2032 32P-labeled primers and RNAs used with the primer are: 5\u2032-TTT TGA ATC ATA ATA ATA ATT AA-3\u2032 for leaderless rLuc RNA, GLA RNA (12), and HCV-rLuc RNA. dGTP, dTTP, 20 mM Tri-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 U/l SuperScript III (Invitrogen) were incubated for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. for toeprint analysis of binary complexes, purified 40S subunits were used in place of RRL and GMP-PNP or CHX was not added to the samples. purified 40S and 60S subunits were incubated with nsp1 or nsp1-mt for 20 min at 30\u00b0C in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM KCl. fractions were collected, one-fourth of each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid pRL-leaderless-rluc was generated by inserting the promoter and rLuc gene into pRL-SV40 (Promega) plasmids confirmed the presence of the expected sequence. expression and purification of recombinant proteins. GST tag was removed from the GST-fused proteins using preScission protease (GE Healthcare) the cells were incubated with methionine-free medium for 30 min. they were labeled with 20 Ci/ml of Tran35S-label (1,000 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals) for 1 h. anti-myc (Millipore), anti-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-actin (Sigma) were used as primary antibodies. 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, and 1% Triton-X were incubated with anti-myc antibody (Millipore) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by incubation with Protein G Plus-Agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C. pellets were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-His (Santa Cruz) or anti-S the percentage reduction in the ribosomal peaks was calculated relative to the control GST sample. the average inhibitory percentages shown in the text were calculated from three independent experiments. the samples were incubated with either 1 mM GMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, or 0.6 mM cycloheximide (CHX) for 5 min at 30\u00b0C. the 5\u2032-labeled primer was incubated with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts for 1 min at 65\u00b0C and then at 37\u00b0C for 8 min to generate primer-RNA complexes. the primer-RNA complex and purified 60S subunits were added to the sample and incubated for 20 min at 30\u00b0C. band intensities of the binary complex and 48S- and 80S-specific toeprint signals were measured by densitometric scanning. the percent reduction in the toeprint signals in the presence of nsp1 and nsp1-CD was calculated relative to the control GST sample. nsp1 mutants exhibit the translation inhibition activity but lack the mRNA cleavage function of nsp1. we tested a series of nsp1 mutants, each carrying alanine substitution(s) of the charged amino acid residue(s) exposed on the surface of nsp1 (1), for their ability to inhibit host translation. nsp1-CD accumulated to a slightly higher level than nsp1-mt. its levels were lower than those of nsp1-mt. nsp1 promotes host mRNA degradation (16); mRNAs that undergo nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage are subsequently degraded by the cellular exonuclease Xrn1 (9). t, nsp1-CD, or CAT, with anti-myc antibody showed the coimmunoprecipitation of the 40S ribosomal subunit with nsp1 and nsp1-CD but not nsp1-mt or CAT. nsp1 (15) and nsp1-CD, but not nsp1-mt or CAT, were tightly associated with the 40S ribosom nsp1-CD inhibits host protein synthesis. 293 cells were transfected with RNAs encoding CAT, nsp1 (nsp1), nsp1-mt (nsp1-mt) or nsp1-CD (nsp1-CD) all of the proteins carried a C-terminal myc epitope tag. 293 cells were cotransfected with the plasmid encoding Ren-EMCV-FF RNA. total RNA was extracted, treated with DNase I. RNA 1 and RNA 2 represent in vitro-synthesized RNA 1 and RNA 2. purified nsp1, nsp1-mt, and GST served as controls. purified nsp1 and its mutants carried a C-terminal myc-His tag. RNA transcripts (12), encoding the rLuc gene carrying the 53-nucleotide (nt)-long 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of rabbit -globin mRNA, were incubated in the presence of nsp1, nsp1-CD induced RNA cleavage in Ren-EMCV-FF RNA in RRL. nsp1-CD bound to the 40S subunit and inhibited mRNA translation. nsp1-CD lacks endonucleolytic RNA cleavage function. nsp1-CD inhibits translation initiation complex formation on cap-dependent and IRES-driven template mRNAs. for testing the effect on cap-dependent and IRES-driven template mRNAs, we used capped and polyadenylated SCoV mRNA 9. the leaderless rLuc RNA lacks a 5\u2032 UTR and carries only a single G residue at the 5\u2032 end followed by the rLuc gene. nsp1-CD and nsp1-mt were used for the experiments with SCoV mRNA 9. GMP-PNP blocks GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 in eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013Met-tRNAiMet ternary complexes. CHX blocks elongation and arrests translation at the 80S complex stage. nsp1-CD inhibits 48S complex formation on cap-dependent and IRES-driven mRNAs. nsp1-CD inhibits 48S complex formation on cap-dependent and IRES-driven mRNAs. toeprint analyses were performed using leaderless rLuc RNA (E), GLA RNA (F), EMCV-fLuc RNA (G) and SCoV mRNA 9 (H) in the presence of GST, nsp1, nsp-1-mt, or nsp1-CD. the same primer used for toeprint analysis was also used to sequence the plasmid carrying the corresponding RNA transcripts. nsp1 and nsp1-CD inhibited 48S and 80S complex formation on SCoV mRNA 9 to a similar extent. nsp1-CD inhibited both 48S and 80S initiation complex formation on cap-dependent and IRES-driven mRNAs. the 60S subunit joins the CrPV IRES-40S binary complex in the absence of any initiation factors to form the 80S complex. nsp1 inhibits translation initiation on capped mRNAs and the IRESes of EMCV, CrPV, and HCV. nsp1 (A and B) or nsp1-mt (C and D) was incubated with purified 40S subunits. twenty fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. the presence of nsp1 or nsp1-mt in each fraction was monitored. toeprint 1 is formed by the interaction of pseudoknot III of the IRES with the 40S subunit. major CrPV toeprint 2 is produced by the leading edge of the 40S ribosome at nt +15 to +16 downstream of the first nucleotide (+1) of the CCU triplet in the P site. the average percent reduction in the intensity of CrPV toeprint 1 was 18 2 and 13 3, respectively, relative to the control GST sample. SGC (C) and toeprint analyses (D) of 80S complex formation on CrPV-fLuc RNA were performed by incubating purified 40S subunit with GST (black), nsp1-CD (red) or nsp1 (blue) followed by the addition of RNA and purified 60S subunit to the sample. p1 suppressed CrPV IRES-mediated translation primarily by blocking the formation of stable binary complex on CrPV-fLuc RNA. both nsp1 and nsp1-CD had a negligible effect on the binary complex formation on HCV-rLuc RNA. nsp1 and nsp1-CD efficiently inhibited 48S complex formation on HCV-rLuc RNA. nsp1 mutant(s) exhibit the translation inhibition activity but lacks the mRNA cleavage function of nsp1. we tested a series of nsp1 mutants, each carrying alanine substitution(s) of the charged amino acid residue(s) exposed on the surface of nsp1 (1), for their ability to inhibit host translation and induce an endonucleolytic cleavage. nsp1 expression resulted in a marked reduction in the abundance of expressed reporter rLuc RNA and endogenous glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. nsp1-CD expression resulted in only a moderate reduction in rLuc RNA levels. nsp1 showed a stronger inhibitory effect than nsp1-CD. nsp1 (15) and nsp1-CD, but not nsp1-mt or CAT, were tightly associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit. pCAGGS-CAT (encoding the CAT gene), pCAGGS-nsp1 (encoding nsp1), or pCAGGS-nsp1 (encoding biologically inactive nsp1-mt) was used in place of 93 cells were transfected with RNAs encoding CAT (CAT), nsp1 (nsp1), nsp1-mt (nsp1-mt) or nsp1-CD (nsp1-CD) all of the proteins carried a C-terminal myc epitope tag. the cells were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D from 1 h posttransfection and then labeled with Tran35 total RNA was extracted, treated with DNase I, and subjected to Northern blot analysis using digoxigenin-labeled antisense rLuc riboprobe. full length represents full-length expressed Ren-EMCV-FF RNA. RNA 1 and RNA 2 represent in vitro-synthesized RNA 1 and RNA 2. nsp1 and nsp1-CD were incubated in the presence of nsp1, nsp1-CD, nsp1-mt, or GST. both nsp1 and nsp1-CD inhibited rLuc reporter gene expression. RNA was extracted from the remaining samples after adding the same amount of EMCV-fLuc RNA, encoding the fLuc gene as a spike RNA. p1-CD inhibited mRNA translation but was defective in inducing an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in the mRNA template. nsp1-CD lacks the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage function. after incubation, a small aliquot was removed and used to determine rLuc activities. the effect of nsp1-CD on the formation of 48S and 80S initiation complexes on cap-dependent and IRES-driven template mRNAs. we used capped and polyadenylated SCoV mRNA 9 carrying the authentic 5\u2032 UTR of SCoV mRNA 9. the leaderless rLuc RNA lacks a 5\u2032 UTR and carries only a single G residue at the 5\u2032 end followed by the rLuc gene analysis of 48S and 80S complex formation, GMP-PNP and CHX were added, respectively, to the RRL that had been preincubated with GST, nsp1, nsp1-mt, or nsp1-CD. the samples were incubated with radiolabeled template RNA and subjected to SGC analysis. each template that had been preannealed with the 5\u2032-end-labeled primer was incubated in the RRL the average percent reduction relative to the GST control for leaderless rLuc RNA, GLA RNA, EMCV-fLuc RNA, and SCoV mRNA 9 was 27 6, 10 2, 38 5 and 11 2, respectively. nsp1-CD inhibits 48S complex formation on cap-dependent and IRES-driven mRNAs. the toeprint of the 48S complex was obtained in the presence of nsp1-CD. the same primer used for toeprint analysis was also used to sequence the plasmid carrying the corresponding RNA transcripts. nsp1-CD inhibited both 48S and 80S initiation complex formation. the extent of nsp1-CD-mediated inhibition of 48S complex formation was template dependent. eIF3 and the eIF2\u2013GTP\u2013Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex results in the formation of the 48S complex (7, 32, 34), which proceeds to form the 80S initiation complex using the same mechanisms operating on capped mRNAs. nsp1 inhibits the translation of all of these mRNAs and induces an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in EMCV, CrPV, and HCV mRNAs the samples were subjected to 10 to 40% sucrose density gradient centrifugation. the presence of nsp1 or nsp1-mt in fractions 3 to 13 was monitored by Western blot analysis with anti-nsp1 antibody. the numbers at the top of the panel represent fraction numbers. nsp1 and nsp1-CD were incubated with nsp1 and nsp1-CD. nsp1 and nsp1-CD were incubated with nsp1 and nsp1-CD. nsp1 and nsp1-CD were incubated with nsp1 and nsp1. the description of CrPV toeprint 1 and toeprint 2 is provided in the text. arrows indicate binary complex (A and E) or 48S complex on HCV-rLuc RNA (G), while arrowheads indicate 80S complexes (C and I) each panel shows representative data from at least three independent experiments. nsp1 and nsp1-CD effectively inhibited 48S complex formation on HCV-rLuc RNA in RRL. nsp1 and nsp1-CD effectively inhibited 48S complex formation. nsp1 and nsp1-CD also inhibited 48S complex formation on HCV IRES. nsp1 and nsp1-CD exhibited identical inhibitory effects on translation of mRNAs resistant to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. nsp1-CD expression resulted in the reduction of coexpressed rLuc RNA levels. nsp1-CD inhibited host protein synthesis more efficiently than nsp1-CD. nsp1 and nsp1-CD showed a strong inhibitory effect on the 80S complex formation on leaderless rLuc RNA, EMCV-fLuc RNA, GLA RNA, and SCoV mRNA 9. nsp1 and nsp1-CD could inhibit at least two separate stages of translation initiation, 48S initiation complex formation and the steps involved in the formation of the 80S complex from the 48S complex. nsp1 and CrPV IRES could compete for the binding site in the 40S subunit. binding sites of HCV IRES and CrPV IRES on the 40S subunit are different. the presence of nsp1 on the 40S subunit could interfere with the recruitment of the ternary complex and/or eIF3 to the HCV IRES-40S binary complex. nsp1- and nsp1-CD exerted a similar inhibitory effect on 48S and 80S initiation complex formation on HCV-rLuc RNA. both nsp1 and nsp1-CD inhibited the binary complex and 80S complex formation on CrPV-fLuc RNA to a similar level. nsp1-bound 40S subunit can load onto these mRNA templates. further studies are required to delineate the mechanism of escape of mRNAs."}
