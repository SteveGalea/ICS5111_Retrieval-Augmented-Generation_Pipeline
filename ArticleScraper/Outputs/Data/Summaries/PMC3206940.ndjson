{"summary": "Background Coronaviruses (CoVs) can be classified into alphacoronavirus (group 1), betacoronavirus (group 2), and gammacoronavirus (group 3) based on diversity of the protein sequences. their 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins for viral replication, is a potential target for anti-coronaviral infection. a number of coronaviruses (CoVs) have been identified as causative agents of respiratory tract and gastroenteritis diseases in mammals and birds. the sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), discovered in 2003, was found to be diverse from any existing groups of CoVs. most of coronaviral strains are group 1 and 2a members. a detailed knowledge of substrate specificity of 3CLpro is helpful in the rational design of inhibitors. a detailed knowledge of substrate specificity of 3CLpro is helpful in the rational design of inhibitors. we have previously created a 198 substrate library by performing saturation mutagenesis at P5 to P3' positions on the wild type (SAVLQSGF) the values of kobs/[3CLpro] of the proteases against this WT sequence were 44311, 12413, 1805 and 17419 mM-1 min-1 for HCoV-NL63 (group 1), HCoV-OC43 (group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2 the relative protease activities of 3CLpro from HCoV-NL63 (shaded, group 1), HCoV-OC43 (white, group 2a), SARS-CoV (black, group 2b) and IBV (grey, group 3) were correlated with structural properties of substituting residue properties, including side chain volume [28], hydrophobicity [29] and -helix and -sheet propensities [30]. 3CLpro is found natively at P1 positions in the polyproteins from group 1 and 2a CoVs. the ability to cleave His at P1 position is a conserved property for all 3CLpro. the protease activities correlate positively with the hydrophobicity of substituting residues at P2 position. branched residues are not preferred in all 3CLpro, probably due to steric clashes with the P2 binding pocket. the protease activities on Arg/Lys-substituting variants were 5 to 14 fold higher than that on Asp/Glu-substituting variants. in the active site of 3CLpro, there is no substrate-binding pocket for P3 residue. all 3CLpro activities are highly correlated to hydrophobicity of residues with side chain volumes of 70 3 (filled symbols) the activities of 3CLpro correlate positively with the hydrophobicity and -sheet propensity of substituting residues at P5 position. the protease activities of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and IBV against the doubly-substituted sequence were 1.700.07, 1.870.17, 1.700.12 and 3.240.37, respectively. at P2' position, all variants, except G2'P, could be cleaved with relative activities of 0.17 to 1.04. 3CLpro from SARS-CoV and IBV have different substrate preferences at P4 position.

SVVLQSGF 0.760.10 0.590.07 1.390.19 0.590.09 VVVLQSGF 1.230.06 0.600.05 1.970.19 0.860.05 VVRLQSGF 1.630.07 0.550.04 2.500.51 2.190.13. the protease activity of IBV 3CLpro against this sequence was boosted to 4.330.98, while that of the other strains were significantly reduced. strand-11 of IBV 3CLpro is positioned further away from the P4 and P5 substrate-binding site compared to other 3CLpro. this results in a wider substrate-binding pocket in IBV 3CLpro. strand-11 of IBV 3CLpro is positioned further away from the P4 and P5 positions. the structure of IBV 3CLpro (PDB: 2Q6D, yellow cartoon and white surface) is superimposed with 3CLpro from HCoV-229E (PDB: 1P9S, light blue), HCoV-HKU1 (PDB: 3D23, light green), and SARS-CoV (PDB: 2Q6G, pink) [31], [32], [33]. strand-11 of IBV 3CLpro is positioned further away from P4 to a substrate sequence 'VARLQSGF' can be cleaved with high relative activities by 3CLpro from all groups of CoVs. this substrate sequence may serve as a good starting point of the design of broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors for 3CLpro. there are exceptions to the dogma that good peptidomimetic inhibitors should be derived from good substrate sequences. the coding sequences of 3CLpro from HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and IBV were sub-cloned and expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS as fusion proteins with N-terminal tags of poly-histidine-small ubiquitin-related modifier. protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mM of isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyrano the protease activity of 3CLpro was measured by the FRET assay we developed previously [26]. purified 3CLpro at 0.2 to 2 M were mixed with 35 M of the substrate protein in buffer A. protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mM of isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) escence at 530 nm when reaction mixture was excited at 430 nm. protease activity against variant substrates was normalized against the WT activity to yield the relative activity. correlation analysis Structural properties of substituting residues were correlated with relative activity.
