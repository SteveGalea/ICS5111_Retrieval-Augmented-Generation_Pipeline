{"summary": "the usefulness of outbreak detection strategies depends on their specificity; the false alarm rate affects the interpretation of alarms. results We develop an outbreak detection method, called the expectation-variance model, based on generalized additive modeling to achieve a constant specificity. this likelihood depends in part on the specificity of the detection method. it is equal to the proportion of non-outbreak days for which no alarm is raised. even small changes in the specificity of the detection method may have a large impact on the likelihood of a true outbreak. all patients with respiratory presenting complaints seen in the ED between august 1, 1992 and July 30, 2004 were included in the study. the data were divided into a six-year training period, and a test period consisting of the final six years. the study was approved by the institutional review board. the predicted number of visits on day t was E t = k = 0 6 a k k, dow ( t ) + a 7 + a 8 t + a 9 t 2 + a 10 sin ( 2 doy ( t ) 365. each day after February 28 was treated as though it occurred on the previous day. a first-order autoregressive, first-order moving average model was then fitted to the errors. the predicted number of visits Et was calculated by summing the overall average, the average for the day of the week, the average for the day of the year, and the ARMA prediction for day t. dow ( t) + k = 0 11 k + 6 k, moy ( t ) + 18 I holiday ( t ) + 19 t. an alarm sounded if the value of the cumulative distribution function of a Poisson random variable with mean Et exceeded the desired specificity. this model was found by Jackson et al. [18] to have superior sensitivity to a variety of outbreak types. no smoothing was performed for the day-of-week term, since many replicates were available for each day of the week. a Gaussian kernel smoother with circular boundaries was used for the trend term, and a Gaussian kernel smoother with circular boundaries was used for the day-of-year term. the expected GAM was a function of linear time, day-of-year, and day-of-week variables. the optimal smoothers corresponded to Gaussian distributions with standard deviations of 6 and 253 days for the day-of-year and trend terms. ance models used expectation-variance model to generate alarm thresholds for each day during the test period from august 1, 1998 to July 30, 2004. the model was trained on the previous six years of data, ending the day before the day to be predicted, and was blind to the actual number of ED visits on the prediction day. the generalized linear model was the largest integer At for which the cumulative distribution function of a Poisson random variable with mean Et was at most s. the wavelet model requires a training period having length equal to a power of two. chi-square analysis was performed under the null hypothesis that all days of the week had an equal fraction of alarm days. the sensitivity was calculated as the fraction of outbreaks for which there was at least one alarm day. an alarm sounding on the first outbreak day corresponded to a lag of zero. an alarm sounding on the first outbreak day corresponded to a lag of zero. the standard deviation was 9.03 (see figure 1). these data and other hospital visit data time series depend significantly on the day of the week and the season of the year. dow(t) is the day of the week from 0 to 6, doy(t) is the day of the year from 1 to 365. the Kronecker delta function x,y is equal to 1 when x = y and 0 otherwise. each day after February 28 was treated as though it occurred on the previous day. this period was selected by Zhang et al. because it removes seasonal effects while preserving higher-frequency information. this low-frequency baseline was subtracted from the original signal. predicted number of visits on day t was the value of the low-frequency component on the previous day. expectation-variance model In addition, we developed and implemented a novel method for outbreak detection that captures changes in the ED visit standard deviation, as well as in the expected number of visits. in other applications, several statisticians have modeled the variance as a function of the same or additional covariates used to model the mean. the two Gaussian smoothers were chosen to minimize the PSE on the training data set using the same procedure as above. the optimal smoothers corresponded to Gaussian. expectation-variance model was trained on the previous six years of data. alarm threshold for the next day was calculated as the sum of the expected number of ED visits, as predicted by the expectation GAM. the predicted threshold for day T was ET + T. alarm thresholds for each day of the test period were calculated using the six years of visit data immediately preceding the prediction day. value less than 0.05 indicated that the specificity was dependent on the day of the week. we superimposed three synthetic outbreaks on the test data set. for each model, each outbreak type, and each day of the test period, we created a new semisynthetic data set by adding an outbreak beginning on that day. receiver-operator curves were constructed for all models. ROC curves show the dependence of the mean sensitivity on the mean specificity. the area under the ROC curve is an indicator of overall performance. the expectation-variance model has a p-value over 0.05 for the entire range of mean specificity values for all three timescales. the null hypothesis of constant specificity is not rejected. all plots not shown are highly significant (p 0.001) for non-constancy. the expectation-variance method performed well in terms of earliness of detection. it detected a seven-day outbreak consisting of five additional patients each day with a shorter lag than the autoregressive, Serfling, trimmed seasonal, and wavelet models. the expectation-variance model also had earlier detection than these models at 85 percent specificity. plots of sensitivity over time for the autoregressive, trimmed seasonal and wavelet models showed a paradoxical increase in sensitivity to synthetic outbreaks during winter months compared to summer months. the specificity was significantly higher during the summer, corresponding to a shift to the left along the summer ROC curve and a concomitant decline in summer sensitivity. autoregressive model demonstrated a variable specificity with the study month and day of the week (p 0.05) for the same range of mean specificities. the wavelet model had variable specificity (p 0.05) on all three time scales. similar trends were observed at other mean specificity values. expectation-variance model specificity was constant as a function of the study year, study month, and the day of the week. hypothesis testing resulted in a p-value above 0.05 for the entire range of input specificities on all three time scales. the area under the expectation-variance model ROC curve was equal to or greater than that of the five comparison models for all three outbreak types. expectation-variance 0.97 0.58 1.96 Mean lag in detecting outbreaks of five additional patients per day superimposed on pediatric ED respiratory visits. sensitivity depends on the size and shape of an outbreak, as well as on the amount of noise in the ED utilization signal. sensitivity of the method must be considered when interpreting the detection lag. the sensitivity of the trimmed seasonal and autoregression models is higher during the winter than during the summer. the sensitivity of the trimmed seasonal and expectation-variance models is higher during the summer than during the winter. cTP, cFP, cTN and cFN denote the costs associated with false positive alarms. the expected total cost of an alarm strategy on a given day is a weighted sum. lowering the specificity contributes to the cost due to fruitlessly investigating more false positive alarms. a perfect outbreak detection model operating at a specificity of 0.95 would output an alarm threshold equal to the 95th percentile for each day, above which an alarm would sound. the autoregressive, Serfling, trimmed seasonal and wavelet models assume that the data have normally distributed errors with constant variance. data were smoothed using 5-day and 11-day moving averages. the ED utilization mean and variance are highest in the winter and lowest during the summer. expectation-variance model is a general time series method which could be applied to surveillance of other syndromes and populations. it could be imported to other platforms, and requires minimal additional computational resources for public health departments collecting surveillance visit data. an approach to temporal and spatial surveillance provides the probability that an observed event would be expected in the absence of an outbreak. a graph of the specificity as a function of the alarm threshold corresponds to a predicted cumulative distribution function of the number of visits on any given day. the model is preferable to previous models for real-world surveillance. authors' contributions SW participated in the study design, carried out the study, and helped to draft the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
