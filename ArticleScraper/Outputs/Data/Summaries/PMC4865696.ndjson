{"summary": "Swiss Webster mice and Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were singly housed in conventional cages with shavings for bedding. all of the indicated animals were free of parasites and negative for viral and bacterial pathogens. mice were free of epizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus, Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus, minute virus of mice, Mycoplasma pulmonis, mouse parvovirus types 1 through 5. rats were free of cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, H1 virus, Kilham rat virus, rat minute virus, rat parvovirus, parvovirus NS1, pneumonia virus of mice, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus all of the animals received oral NSAID medication (carprofen 5 mg/kg) once daily for 2 d after each procedure. each animal was allowed 14 d of recovery before the next procedure. none of the animals were treated with antibiotics at any time during this study. absorbable suture was chosen because the suture was buried beneath the skin, that is, no external exposure, and because complete degradation of the suture would not take place within the time intervals between laparotomies. at each successive surgery, the suture material from the previous surgery was removed, and a different area of the liver was biopsied. the abdominal wall and skin of 4 of the mice were closed with 4-0 polyglycolic acid suture in the same manner as described previously. in the 2 remaining mice, the abdominal wall was closed with 4-0 polyglycolic acid suture in a simple continuous pattern. the skin was closed by using suture glue. the data were processed using TI-84 Plus software (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX) the Pearson 2 test was used to evaluate our null hypothesis. the survival of our subjects was independent of their weight loss or gain throughout the study. iron-base powdered diet ad libitum (Teklad 8604, Harlan Laboratories) and a nylon bone (catalog no. 3203 or 3580, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ) to maintain appropriate incisor length except for the 14-d period between the first and second procedures. rats were free of epizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus, Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus, minute virus of mice, mycoplasma all animals were placed in dorsal recumbency and prepared aseptically for surgery. each animal received a NSAID (carprofen 5 mg/kg SC) at the completion of surgery, each animal received a 2-mm biopsy punch and a package of the absorbable gelatin sponge product. the defect in the liver created by the biopsy punch was filled with a small quantity of absorbable sponge (Gelfoam, Pfizer Pharmacia and Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) the abdominal wall was closed with 3-0 absorbable suture (polyglycolic acid suture, Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) in a simple interrupted pattern. the skin was closed using the same suture in a subcuticular pattern placed in the subcutaneous layer. the linea alba was incised by using a no. 15 scalpel blade instead of a no. 10 blade. the liver biopsies were obtained in the same manner using a 2-mm biopsy punch. in 2 of the mice, the defects made in the liver by the biopsy punches were not filled with the gelatin sponge product. the variables considered to be the most important in this study were the age of the subjects at the time of the first collection, the percentage of weight loss or gain between procedures, and the health status of the subject at the time of the first surgery. the data were processed using TI-84 Plus software (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX) the diarrhea resolved after the second procedure, when the carbonyl iron diet was discontinued. all of the rats recovered well from the second procedure, with no additional loss of weight between the second and third biopsy collection procedures. despite these secondary issues, this mouse continued to thrive and gain weight throughout the study. none of the other rodents in the study developed adhesions or abscesses. investigators did not observe any gross abnormalities at the time of the subsequent liver biopsy collections. no of the other subjects were fed this diet and none of the other subjects developed diarrhea or dehydration during this study. at the completion of the analysis, our P value was 0.72615, which resulted in the acceptance of our null hypothesis. liver biopsy techniques include fine-needle aspiration, laparotomy, resection of a liver lobe, fine-needle aspiration and fine-needle aspiration. the method should be highly sensitive and specific, technically easy to measure, inexpensive with minimal to no side effects, and useful for monitoring the progression or regression of liver disease. a technique described in the literature for obtaining multiple liver biopsies in rats used the same approach as our study. bleeding from the stump was controlled by electrocautery. the technique induced the formation of numerous adhesions between the biopsy sites and the peritoneum and omentum and resulted in scarring at all of the biopsy sites. the method we developed during the current study may be more invasive than the previously published procedure, but can be performed by any appropriately trained researcher at any facility. another mouse study outlined the use of cryobiopsy for collecting liver samples. the technique does not create such artifacts in the tissue samples. the hepatic histology is not ideal, but the appearance of the hepatic histology and the fact only 2 animals did not survive to the third and final collection support the use of the current proposed method of tissue collection. some of the Belgrade rats sustained dramatic weight losses, but these were directly related to the carbonyl iron diet and not to the surgical procedures."}
