{"summary": "long-acting drug implants made by combining a drug with biodegradable implants composed of lipids or polymers. the utility of this strategy decreases when the food or water mixture may be released inadvertently to the environment or the drug is highly regulated. mice and rats treated with up to tenfold excess of the intended dose of drug and control animals following 4- and 12-day drug trials [19\u201321] no significant differences between the drug-treated and control animals. rat theilovirus, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycoplasma pulmonis, and pinworms throughout the study. animals were group housed (up to 3 per cage) during the quarantine and acclimation period based on group/sex designation. no disease-related signs were noted during the quarantine/acclimation period. rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal solution of ketamine, 80 mg/kg, and xylazine, 8 mg/kg, in a saline solution containing 14.25% ethyl alcohol. each rat was injected with the designated dose of test article or buprenorphine-free control suspension. euthanasia was administered by CO2 inhalation and blood collection by and exsanguination cardiocentesis, followed by a thoracotomy. euthanasia was administered by CO2 inhalation and blood collection by and exsanguination cardiocentesis. animals and Husbandry studies were approved by a Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) the protocol complies with the National Research Council's Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. rats were housed 1 per cage for 7 days to prevent redosing by coprophagy. on day 8, rats were housed 2 per cage for 7 days to prevent redosing by coprophagy. rats were provided enrichment devices of polycarbonate red tubes. the drug suspension consisted of buprenorphine, cholesterol, glycerol tristearate, suspended in medium-chain triglyceride oil, and Miglyol 812, (Sasol, Hamburg Germany), 8 mg/100 uL. each rat was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) solution of ketamine, 80 mg/kg, and xylazine, 8 mg/kg, in a saline solution serum chemistry tests included glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin (as calculation), total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphate. tissues for histopathology were immersion fixed in individually labeled containers containing 10% neutral-buffered formalin. there was no significant difference in organ weights of liver, spleen, heart, kidneys (both), brain, adrenal glands (both), uterus + cervix, and ovaries. blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values were 16.50 1.29, 15.50 1.00, and 13.25 0.96 mg/dL for the control. female rats were chosen for a long-term trial because female rats may have increased susceptibility to opiates. lipid-based delivery system caused no significant adverse effects in a rat model. one rat illustrated signs of nausea at days 1-2, signs that have been observed previously. previous studies have demonstrated that the risk of pica-related gastric distress can be controlled by the appropriate choice of bedding. there were no significant differences between the organ weights or appearances of the drug-treated rats."}
