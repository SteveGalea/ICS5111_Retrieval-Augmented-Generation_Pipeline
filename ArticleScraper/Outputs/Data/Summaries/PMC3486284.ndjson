{"summary": "CoVs infect a wide variety of animals, causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity. the nomenclature and taxonomy of CoVs were revised by the Coronavirus Study Group of the international committee for taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) the spike (S) protein of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV possesses only 80% amino acid identity to that of civet SARSr-CoV. a potentially novel alphacoronavirus, BatCoV HKU10, was detected in two very different bat species. after its first detection in a Leschenault's rousette in Guangdong, the virus was also found in Pomona leaf-nosed bats in Hong Kong. specimens were collected using disposable swabs with protective gloves. RNA was eluted in 50 l of AVE buffer and was used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the PCR products were gel purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) the sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences of the RdRp genes of CoVs in the GenBank database. the cDNA was amplified by degenerate primers designed by a multiple alignment of the genomes of human coV 229E (HCoV 229E) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification using the 5\u2032-3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Germany) the complete RdRp and S genes of 25 Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains were amplified and sequenced using primers available from genome sequencing. the sequences of the PCR products were assembled manually to produce the complete RdRp and S gene sequences. the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, Ka, for each coding region were calculated using the Nei-Go sites under positive selection in the S gene were inferred using single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL) and random-effects likelihood (REL) methods. positive selection for a site was considered statistically significant if the P value was 0.1 for the SLAC and FEL methods. the mean time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and the highest posterior density regions at 95% (HPD) were calculated. the best-fitting model was selected by a Bayes factor, using marginal likelihoods implemented in Tracer (56). the nucleotide sequences of the eight genomes of batCoV HKU10 have been deposited in the GenBank sequence database under accession no. JQ989266 to JQ989273. the PCR mixture (25 l) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% gelatin) the mixtures were amplified with 60 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 48\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. four samples positive for BatCoV HKU10 were cultured in FRhK-4 (rhesus monkey kidney; ATCC CRL-1688), vero E6 (African green monkey kidney; ATCC CRL-1586) and HRT-18G (human colorectal adenocarcinoma; ATCC CRL-11663) cell lines and primary bat kidney and lung fibroblast cells derived from a Chinese horseshoe bat. KU2 (Rh-BatCoV HKU2) and additional primers covering the original degenerate primer sites were designed from the results of the first and subsequent rounds of sequencing. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. additional PCR targeted to other genome sites, including partial fragments of the helicase (Hel) and S genes. the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, Ka, for each coding region were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in MEGA version 5 (57). bootscan analysis and genetic algorithm recombination detection (GARD) was performed among genomes of batCoV HKU10 strains using the Kishino-Hasegawa ( an unrestricted random-effects branch site model, branch site REL, was implemented for detecting lineage-specific selection (26). this method is usually used to identify branches in a tree with evidence of episodic diversifying selection. it is known to be more robust to errors because it does not enforce uniform selective pressure on all background branches (26). the nucleotide sequences of the eight genomes of batCoV HKU10 have been deposited in the GenBank sequence database under accession no. JQ989266 to JQ989273. RT-PCRs for a 440-bp fragment in the RdRp genes of CoVs were positive for the potentially novel alphacoronavirus.

Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 genomes showed only 93 to 97% nucleotide identity. their genome organization was similar to that of other alphacoronaviruses. a putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif, 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032, was identified at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence. 27532\u201327777 246 81 +1 27518 CUAAAC(5)AUG NS7b 27787\u201328248 462 153 +2 NS7c 27986\u201328216 231 76 +2 Hi-BatCoV HKU10 TLC1310A 1ab 303\u201320647 20,345 6,781 +3, +2 74 CUAAAC(220)AUG S 20644\u201324699 4,056 1,351 putative nonstructural proteins (NSPs) of ORF1 of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 and their predicted cleavage sites are represented by green boxes. a unique putative cleavage site at NSP10/11 or NSP10/12 was observed in both Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10.

NS7b and NS7c share 92 to 95% and 88 to 90% amino acid identities. a BLAST search revealed no significant amino acid similarities between these putative nonstructural proteins and other known proteins. some alphacoronaviruses, such as TGEV, porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), Rh-BatCoV HKU2, and Sc-BatCoV 512, are also known to possess genes downstream of that for N. further experiments will delineate the function of such ORFs in bat CoVs. a total of 951, 609, 1,899 and 572 amino acid positions in RdRp, Hel, S, and N, respectively, were included in the analysis. the scale bars indicate the estimated number of substitutions per 5 or 10 aa. phylogenetic analysis confirms marked sequence divergence between the S proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains. further sequencing of the S genes of one additional Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and four additional Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains. strains, TLC43A and TLC47A, both detected in 2010, appeared to form a distinct cluster. most of the substitutions were nonsynonymous substitutions localized within the S1 region. high Ka/Ks ratios and substantial changes in the spike proteins may reflect rapid viral evolution soon after introduction into a new animal host. KU10 from 2005-2006 likely underwent rapid evolution under positive selection in Pomona leaf-nosed bats. estimates of nonsynonymous substitution and synonymous rates in the genomes of four Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2005-2006 were 2.000. that of four Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2007-2008 was 0.333. 10 strains from 2010 was 0 (Ka = 0, Ks = 0.001). no significant recombination breakpoint among batCoV HKU10 genomes was detected by bootscan or GARD analysis. only the branch of two Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2010 was under significant positive selection. the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of the S proteins of TGEV, HCoV NL63, and HCoV 229E were mapped previously (3, 14, 74). the heptad repeat regions were predicted by using the coiled-coil prediction program MultiCoil2 (61). RT-PCRs for a 440-bp fragment in the RdRp genes of CoVs were positive for the potentially novel alphacoronavirus BatCoV HKU10 in the alimentary and respiratory samples. all positive samples were confirmed by RT-PCR of multiple genome sites using primers targeted to Hel or S genes. settus leschenaulti Leschenault's rousette 416 0 (0) 3 (0.7)a Microchiroptera Hipposideridae Hipposideros larvatus Intermediate leaf-nosed bat 2 0 (0) 0 (0) Hipposideros pomona Pomona leaf-nosed bat 524 3 (0.6)b 36 (7.2)b Rhinolophidae Rhinolophus affinus Intermediate horseshoe bat 339 0 (0) 0 b Hi-BatCoV HKU10 was detected in 37 (7%) of 523 Pomona leaf-nosed bats in Hong Kong. no obvious disease was observed in bats positive for Ro-BatCoV HKU10 or Hi-BatCoV HKU10. the complete genome sequences of two strains of Ro-BatCoV HKU10, 175A and 183A (from alimentary samples of two Leschenault's rousettes) were determined to look for genomic differences between viruses from the two bat species. the eight genomes possessed genome sizes of 28,483 to 28,494 nucleotides. atCoV HKU10 genomes, a putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif, 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032, preceded each ORF except the NS3 and envelope (E) genes. preceding the E gene, an alternative TRS motif, 5\u2032-CUAAAU-3\u2032, was also identified in both the Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 genomes. 6,781 +3, +2 74 CUAAAC(220)AUG S 20644\u201324699 4,056 1,351 +1 20631 CUAAAC(4)AUG NS3 24699\u201325355 657 218 +3 24664 E 25384\u201325611 228 75 +1 25362 CUAAAU(13)AUG M 25617\u201326297 681 226 +3 25605 CUAAAC(3)AUG N a unique putative cleavage site was observed in both Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10. this amino acid substitution was due to mutations from TC(A/T), AG(T/C) or GCT in Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10. 4116 NSP12 RdRp A4098-Q5024 A4099-Q5025 NSP13 Hel S5025-Q5621 S5026-Q5622 NSP14 ExoN, N7-MTase A5622-Q6139 A5623-Q6140 NSP15 NendoU S6140-Q6478 S6141-Q6479 NSP16 2\u2032-O-MT S6479-R6780 S6480-R67 TMHMM analysis showed three putative transmembrane domains in NS3 of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 strain 175A and all six Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains. only two putative transmembrane domains were observed in NS3 of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 strain 183A (at residues 33 to 53, 62 to 82, and 88 to 106, respectively) two heptad repeats (HR) were located at residues 959 to 1085/1086 (HR1) and 1234 to 1284 (HR2) for Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and at residues 952/955/959 to 1048/1051/1053 (HR1) and 1235/1237 to 1284/1286 (HR2) for Hi-BatCoV HKU10. virus TGEV 28,586 63.6 75 77 42.8 32.9 47 36.7 63.2 74.7 76.8 42.5 32.9 44.9 36.7 FIPV 29,355 62.6 75.2 77 42.8 32.9 44.9 33.3 62.3 74.9 76.8 42.8 32.9 42.6 35.3 PRCV 27,550 63.6 74.8 76.6 41.1 36.6 36.1 63.2 74.5 76.5 41.1 36.6 45.4 36.3 CCoV 29,363 61.3 74.9 7 67.7 46.3 74.5 83.8 85.9 51.2 50.7 66.9 45.8 Sc-BatCoV 512 28,203 70.9 80.7 82.6 46.3 53.2 69.9 46.7 71.2 80.4 82.4 45.5 53.2 69.6 46.9 Ro-BatCoV HKU10 183A 28,494 99.7 99.5 99.8 60.5 100 96.1 97 Hi-BatCoV HKU10 LSH5A 28,492 betacoronavirus subgroup C Ty-BatCoV HKU4 30,286 45.3 59.9 62.5 27.8 24.4 35.7 26.5 45 59.8 62.3 26.7 24.4 36 26.9 Pi-BatCoV HKU5 30,488 45.9 59.4 63.5 25.8 23.2 33 26.7 45.6 59.3 63.3 26.4 23.2 33.2 26.9 Betacoronavirus subgroup D Ro-BatCoV H HCoV NL63, human coronavirus NL63; PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; CCoV, canine coronavirus; MCoV, canine coronavirus; MCoV, canine coronavirus; MCoV, canine coronavirus; MCoV, canine coronavirus; MCoV, canine coronavirus; MCoV, canine coronavirus; MCo NS7b and NS7c share only 60% amino acid identity in NS7a to other strains.

IPV, TGEV, porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), Rh-BatCoV HKU2 and Sc-BatCoV 512 are also known to possess genes downstream of that for N. in TGEV, the gene downstream of the N gene may play a role in membrane association of replication complexes or virus assembly. further experiments will delineate the function of such ORFs in bat CoVs. a total of 951, 609, 1,899 and 572 amino acid positions in RdRp, Hel, S, and N, respectively, were included in the analysis. the scale bars indicate the estimated number of substitutions per 5 or 10 aa. porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus; GiCoV, giraffe coronavirus; SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3; Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU4; Pi-BatCoV HKU5, Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; BWCoV SW1; beluga whale coronavirus SW1; in studies on the evolution and cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses, high Ka/Ks ratios and substantial changes in the spike proteins of coronaviruses may reflect rapid viral evolution soon after introduction into a new animal host. we hypothesize that interspecies transmission between the two bat species occurred recently, with subsequent viral adaptation in the new host species. the Ka/Ks of S sequences of three Ro-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2005\u20132006 was 0.070. no significant recombination breakpoint among BatCoV HKU10 genomes was. REL analysis found that only the branch of two Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2010 was under significant positive selection. strength of positive selection (+) and proportion of total branch length affected by positive selection (q+) were 4,378.93 and 0.03, respectively. tMRCA of all batCoV HKU10 strains was estimated at 1959.34 (HPDs, 1886.23 to 2002.77), approximately 53 years ago. tMRCA of all batCoV HKU10 strains was estimated at 1959.34 (HPDs, 1956.17 to 2004.76) and that of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 at 1991.58 (HPDs, 1968.62 to 2004.41) the genomes of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 were highly similar except in the S region, where the two viruses shared only 60.5% amino acid identities. however, they formed a distinct cluster within Alphacoronavirus upon phylogenetic analysis, supporting the idea that BatCoV HKU10 represents a novel species. a significant positive selection was observed at the branch of two Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2010. molecular-clock analysis of the RdRp genes dated the tMRCA of all BatCoV HKU10 strains at around 1959 (HPDs, 1886 to 2002) and that of Hi-BatCoV HKU10 at around 1986 (HPDs, 1956 to 2004), which supported the recent emergence of BatCoV HKU10 and recent interspecies transmission to Pomona leaf-nosed bats. further studies on more samples and virus isolation in cell cultures derived from the the sequence divergence between the S proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 is even higher than that between SARSr-Rh-BatCoV and civet SARSr-CoV (30, 40), which in turn supported the idea that horseshoe bats could well be the reservoir for the direct ancestor of SARSr-CoVs in civets. ettes are fruit bats belonging to the suborder Megachiroptera, family Pteropodidae. the bat species is widely distributed in Asia and roosts in densely packed colonies of up to several thousand individuals. transmission of batCoV HKU10 from Leschenault's rousettes to Pomona leaf-nosed bats in Hong Kong is possible. the present study provides the first evidence for interspecies transmission of a CoV between two very different bats belonging to different suborders. the present hi-BatCoV HKU10 genomes represented the first genome data available for CoVs in bats belonging to the genus Hipposideros. supplementary material supp_86_21_11906___index.html (1.3KB, html)."}
