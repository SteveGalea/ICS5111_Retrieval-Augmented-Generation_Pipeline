{"summary": "the role of PGE2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown. we evaluated the effects of c-Jun and 3-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE2. K1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity. overexpression of c-Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity followed increased cell proliferation."}
