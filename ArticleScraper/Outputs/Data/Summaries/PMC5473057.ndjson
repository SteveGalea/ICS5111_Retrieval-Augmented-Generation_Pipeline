{"summary": "Philip Alston, the u.n. special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, issued a statement at the end of his mission in china. he noted the extraordinary progress that China has made over the past three decades in bringing people out of poverty. he concluded that there were lessons to be drawn from other countries to be drawn from china\u2019s achievements. article 12 of the ICESCR recognizes the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. it also establishes the obligations of states parties to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right to health. states parties are required to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health, including the right to health care. the article discusses judicial accountability, political accountability, administrative accountability, professional accountability, and social accountability. it concludes that there is a domestic accountability framework, although very different from that of Western democracies. this accountability framework involves largely top-down processes. accountability for human rights hinges on the notion of participation of people and groups in health-related decision making. accountability for human rights also hinges on the notion of participation of people and groups in all health-related decision making. wen ze carries with it the connotations of \u2018questioning\u2019 and \u2018blaming\u2019, closely reflecting the essence of the liberal notion of accountability. in 2006, the prime minister delivered a report on governmental reform and development and stressed the need to strengthen administrative accountability. he further emphasized the principle of transparency as an important component in the process of developing appropriate systems of accountability. there is no constitutional court in china, and no rights-holder has claimed a constitutional right to health in any Chinese court. in practice, the right to health can be deconstructed into component rights, including the right to health care, the right to clean water, the right to safe food, the right to clean air, the right to a healthy environment, and so on. a central concern of the right to health is participation in the development of laws, policies, and practices to realize the right to health. a central concern of the right to health is participation in the development of laws, policies, and practices to realize the right to health. political accountability requires a democratic political framework carried out through mechanisms such as free and fair elections and the workings of parliaments. the state council is directly accountable to the National People\u2019s Congress for all its decisions and actions. three forms of political accountability are reflected in the Chinese political system. the national people\u2019s Congress is composed of representatives at the national level. candidates at all levels of the people\u2019s representatives system are composed of elites from various professions. in practice most candidates are nominated by the Nomination Committee of the People\u2019s Congress at each level. the right to health demands that health facilities, services, and medicines be available, accessible, acceptable, and of good quality. at the first stage, resources from the whole state budget are allocated to health. at the second stage, these allocations are further distributed to satisfy different demands within the health system. the public is not able to obtain remedies for the council\u2019s failure to implement the approved governmental plan. accountability functions well insofar as it relates to government planning. but it does not function for the review of performance. accountability essentially functions through a combination of political and social accountability. political accountability includes monitoring and supervising health administrative management, as well as administrative procedures for people to bring complaints. in this respect, there are two types of accountability mechanisms: general administrative mechanisms. in the past 10 years, the government has moved toward increasing transparency and public participation in health policymaking. it is only in the past 10 years that the government has moved toward increasing transparency and participation in health policymaking. however, the move is not yet reflected in its monitoring of implementation of health policy. the state food and drugs administration is directly authorized by the state council to legislate, make policies and work plans, set market criteria, license, and supervise industry. in both cases, it was the attention of the media, rather than the state food and drugs administration, that resulted in the government taking action to hold the responsible parties accountable. a criminal procedure will be triggered in practice. health professionals answer to hierarchical superiors, participate in hearings to provide answers to the public, and provide explanations of treatments administered to patients. professional accountability mechanisms must rely upon experts in health care or operate through associations with professional knowledge. in some countries, professional associations supervise and monitor health professionals through licensing requirements and codes of conduct. despite this interlocking system of accountability, there are important areas where professional accountability of health professionals is absent. in many hospitals, doctors\u2019 income is linked to the quantity of their work, which includes the quantity of operations they perform and the quantity of medicines they prescribe. in many hospitals, doctors\u2019 income is linked to the quantity of their work. social accountability is necessary when there is a failure of other formal accountability mechanisms. the presence of effective social accountability is therefore an essential component to hold formal accountability mechanisms for the right to health to account. there is no constitutional court in china, and no rights-holder has claimed a constitutional right to health in any Chinese court. in practice, the right to health can be deconstructed into component rights, including the right to health care, the right to clean water, the right to safe food, the right to clean

accountability is therefore an essential component to hold formal accountability mechanisms for the right to account. political accountability in china has traditionally been performed through the National People\u2019s Congress, through the reporting of the State Council, and through supervision mechanisms within the Communist Party. lack of public participation has rendered it a very weak mechanism by which to hold the government to account. this process can be achieved by government action or through administration litigation. social accountability has gained momentum through media censure. the media has spurred the Communist Party of China to take action in a number of highly publicized cases. the process of accountability has been hindered by longstanding cultural and political barriers."}
