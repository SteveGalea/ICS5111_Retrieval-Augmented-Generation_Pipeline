{"summary": "innate immune pattern recognition receptors recognize self- and microbe-associated molecules. PRRs are transmembrane receptors that are expressed either on the cell surface or within the endosomal compartment and respond to a variety of PAMPs. early type I IFN signaling is necessary for NK cell recruitment to the liver. the response induces IFN-dependent chemokines, which contribute to the recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the liver. early responses to MCMV infection in the liver are well understood. mice containing an H412R missense mutation in the endoplasmic reticulum protein UNC93B1 have severely impaired liver cytokine and cellular responses. cytokine production after early MCMV infection is dependent on UNC93B1 deficiency. MCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses are not impaired. 3d mice were uninfected or MCMV-infected for 40 h or 48 h. maximum production of IFN-, IFN-, IL-12p70 and TNF- was detected at 40 h post-MCMV infection before declining by 48 h post-infection. in 3d mice, average concentrations of TNF- were 6-fold lower than WT at 40 h and 2.5-fold lower than WT at 48 h after infection. results indicate a requirement for endosomal TLR signals for early systemic proinflammatory cytokine production. pDCs expressing marker PDCA-1 have been shown to produce the majority of liver IFN- at 40 h post-MCMV infection. there were 4-fold fewer PDCA-1+ pDCs expressing intracellular IFN- at 40 h, and 3-fold fewer at 48 h post-infection. 3d mice were either uninfected or infected with MCMV for 40 h or 48 h. leukocytes were stained for cell surface expression of PDCA-1 or NK1.1 and TCR. results show total numbers of (B) PDCA-1+, (C) IFN-+ PDCA-1+, (E) NK1.1+ TCR\u2013 and (F) IFN-+ NK1.1+ TCR\u2013 cells. in 3d mice by proportion (0.8%0.3% and 1%0.4%) at 40 h and 48 h respectively. combined endosomal TLR signals can affect the expression of critical proinflammatory cytokines in the liver during MCMV infection. innate immune response is important both in establishing early control of virus replication and in coordination downstream adaptive responses. MCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the liver are not compromised in the absence of endosomal TLR signals. liver sections prepared from 3d and WT mice that were either uninfected or infected for 5 or 7 days were hematoxylin and eosin. the histological appearance of liver sections from uninfected 3d and WT mice appeared comparable (Fig. 4, A and B) by day 3 post-MCMV infection, clusters of infiltrating cells or inflammatory foci were present in WT mice and persisted through day 5. inflammatory foci per area of liver were equally apparent in liver sections from 3d mice infected for 3 days. no.

IL-12p70 production similarly peaked at 40 h post-MCMV infection. 3d mice produced 12-fold less IL-12p70 at this infection time point. cytokine responses in liver cells from 3d mice infected with MCMV were evaluated to address the impact of endosomal TLR signaling in a localized tissue site of infection. pDCs from 3d mice were impaired in their ability to express IFN-. 3d mice were either uninfected or infected for 40 h or 48 h with MCMV. PDCA-1+ IFN-+ pDCs at 40 h and 48 h post-infection compared to WT. effect of 3d mutation on liver cytokine production and innate effector cell accumulation. 3d mice showed a defect in liver IFN- production in response to MCMV infection. at 40 h post-infection, 3d mice induced 5-fold less IFN- than WT. NK cells are an important early source of IFN- in the liver during MCMV infection. the effects of endosomal TLR signaling on liver CD8+ T cell responses was examined at late time points during acute MCMV infection. the results shown in Fig. 3A demonstrate comparable absolute numbers of CD8+ T cells in 3d mice at days 5 and 7 post-MCMV infection. intracellular expression of IFN- and TNF- in CD8+ T cells was examined following ex vivo restimulation with H-2Db M45 viral peptide. results show the proportion and total numbers of CD8+ TCR+ IFN-+ and (D and E) CD8+ TCR+ TNF-+ (D and E) cells. data are representative of six independent experiments and show mean SD (n = 3 mice per group) inflammatory foci per area of liver in 3d mice at day 5 post-infection were significantly more numerous and contained a greater number of nucleated cells compared to WT. inflammation in 3d mice showed signs of resolution that were similar to WT. number of foci per 850 m2 areas in day 5 infected 3d livers was significantly higher than WT at the same infection time point, p0.04. the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured in serum samples from 3d mice that were uninfected or infected with MCMV for 3, 5 or 7 days. by day 3 of infection, similar elevations in ALT levels were detected in both groups. 3d mice were fected or infected for 3, 5, 7 or 9 days with MCMV (5104 PFU) asterisks denote a significant difference between WT and 3d mean PFU/g liver. 3d mice lack endosomal TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 signaling due to a mutation in the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein UNC93B1 [34], [35] to address the contribution of endosomal TLRs in liver antiviral defenses against acute MCMV infection. the results showed impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines by NK cells and pDCs in the liver. previous studies have demonstrated impaired serum cytokine production and increased susceptibility to infection in 3d mice infected with a high lethal dose of MCMV. however, our study is the first report to document the contribution of the 3d mutation to impaired MCMV defense in the liver. these results were not unexpected given the known role for the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs in MCMV recognition. NK cell inflammatory responses and production of IFN- are essential to defense against MCMV in the liver [23]\u2013[25] in 3d mice, NK cell production of IFN- in the liver was severely impaired during early MCMV infection. the defect in liver cytokine production in 3d mice is reminiscent of that reported for MyD88-deficient mice. 3d mice deficient in TLR7 and TLR9 exhibited decreased levels of systemic IFN-/ and increased susceptibility to MCMV infection [33] despite early effects of endosomal TLR deficiency, 3d mice were able to mount robust CD8+ T cell cytokine responses. however, we detected no overt defect in CD8+ T cell responses within the first seven days of MCMV infection in the liver. cell function in the absence of endosomal TLR signals contributes to inflated T cell responses. the presence of increased virus in the liver may also contribute to the robust T cell recruitment and cytokine production observed at late infection time points in 3d mice. however, inflammation and liver injury subsided late in infection. all animal work was approved by the Brown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. MCMV Smith strain was prepared as a salivary gland-passaged stock from CD1 mice. organs were weighed, homogenized in cold supplemented DMEM. IFN-, IL-12p70 and TNF- were assayed by duoSet (R&D Systems) limits of detection were 15 pg/mL for DuoSets and 12.5 pg/mL for VeriKine ELISA kits. inflammatory foci were identified, at a magnification of 200, as clusters of cells in totals of 850 m2 areas per representative tissue. in some cases, liver sections had larger areas of inflammation with >60 cells with less defined foci.
