{"summary": "Detection and quantification of airborne viruses is essential in order to provide information regarding public health risk assessment. using low Melting Agarose (LMA) plates and a conventional microbial air sampling device has been developed. Molecular detection and quantification of airborne viruses is performed using real-time quantitative (RT-)PCR (Q(RT-)PCR) technique. many highly pathogenic viruses have the potential of being converted from droplet to airborne transmission. many types of samplers have been used over the years, including liquid impingers, solid impactors, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and many others. the use of LMA has been shown to improve the PCR amplification from templates which were naturally contaminated by various PCR inhibitors. LMA plates were seeded with HAdV containing 1 104 GC (ii) HAdV containing 1 103 GC (iii) HAdV containing 1 102 GC (Table 1). a second set of spiking experiments, an RNA virus was tested. recovery values of HAdV 35 seeded in LMA plates Sample ID HAdV added GC/plate HAdV recovered GC/plate Recovery (%) Mean recovery (%) exp1 1 104 0,47 104 47 81 exp2 1 104 1,01 104 101 exp3 1 104 0,95 104 95 exp4 1 103 0,59 103 59 60,3 exp5 1 103 0,59 103 59 exp6 1 103 0,6 103 63 exp7 1 4 ml of NucliSENS lysis buffer were added to each LMA plate. the lysate was transferred to 15 ml falcon tube, briefly vortexed and incubated for 10 min at 55\u00b0C in a water bath. subsequently, 50 l of well-mixed magnetic silica were added to the lysate. standard curves used in the QRT-PCR were generated by using serial dilutions of purified viral genomic RNA from adenovirus 35 (HAdV-35) viral stocks. the quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) for human Norovirus GII (detection limit 10 copies per reaction) based on a method described previously [15], was performed in a final volume of 20 l, using the RNA UltraSenseTM One-Step the following probe was used, IAC probe: IACP (5'-VIC-CCA TAC ACA TAG GTC AGG -MGBNFQ-3') the primers and conditions were the same to those for HAdV and NoVGII QPCRs. standard precautions were applied in all Q(RT-)PCR assays. QPCR for HAdV detection and quantification of human Adenovirus was performed under the same experimental conditions described previously. the standard curve was generated using serial dilutions (range 1 to 107) of known amounts of a linearized plasmid containing the entire hexon region of HAdV 41. LMA plates were seeded with HAdV containing 1 104 GC (ii) HAdV containing 1 103 GC (iii) HAdV containing 1 102 GC (Table 1). the plates were left at room temperature in order to solidify and stored at 4\u00b0C until used. recovery values of HAdV 35 seeded in LMA plates Sample ID HAdV added GC/plate HAdV recovered GC/plate Recovery (%) Mean recovery (%) exp1 1 104 0,47 104 47 81 exp2 1 104 1,01 104 101 exp3 1 104 0,95 104 95 exp4 1 103 0,59 103 59 60,3 exp5 1 103 0,59 103 59 exp6 1 103 0,6 103 63 exp7 1 4 ml of NucliSENS lysis buffer were added to each LMA plate. the lysate was transferred to 15 ml falcon tube, briefly vortexed and incubated for 10 min at 55\u00b0C in a water bath. lysate was then transferred to 15 ml falcon tube, briefly vortexed and incubated for 10 min at 55\u00b0C in a water bath. standard curves used in the QRT-PCR were generated by using serial dilutions of purified viral genomic RNA from adenovirus 35 (HAdV-35) viral stocks. the quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) for human Norovirus GII (detection limit 10 copies per reaction) was performed in a final volume of 20 l, using the RNA UltraSenseTM One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invit the following probe was used to test the eluted nucleic acids for the presence of inhibitory substances. the primers and conditions were the same to those for HAdV and NoVGII QPCRs, respectively. QPCR for HAdV detection and quantification were performed under the same experimental conditions described previously. the standard curve was generated by using serial dilutions (range 1 to 107) of known amounts of a linearized plasmid containing the entire hexon region of HAdV 41. the mean viral recovery values of three independent experiments were 90.3% (for the samples spiked with 1 104 GC), 93.3% (for the samples spiked with 1 104 GC) and 63.3% (for the samples spiked with 1 102 GC) the NA extracts from the field experiments were tested for inhibition against control samples of pure NA elution buffer. noV GII recovery from LMA plates was estimated with QRT-PCR. the mean viral recovery values of three independent experiments were 90.3% (for the samples spiked with 1 104 GC), 93.3% (for the samples spiked with 1 104 GC), and 63.3% (for the samples spiked with 1 102 GC) the drawback of agar plates is that viruses have to be eluted from the agar plates before the subsequent nucleic acid extraction step. inhibitory substances presented in the agar media tend to remain during the subsequent NA isolation and finally inhibit the Q(RT-)PCR reactions. the whole procedure can be completed in less than three (3) hours."}
