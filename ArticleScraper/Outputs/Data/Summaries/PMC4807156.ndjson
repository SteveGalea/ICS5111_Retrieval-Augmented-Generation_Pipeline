{"summary": "cGMP binds to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels1, 2 and phosphorylates protein kinase G (PKG) directly3-5. amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels behave as ligand-gated channels, similar to several other members of the ENaC/degenerin family. and -subunits regulate the channel activity of the'self-conducting' -, -, and -ENaC subunits when heterologously expressed in oocytes and cell lines 10-12. ENaC is regulated by a spectrum of protein kinases, such as PKG and protein kinase A (PKA 13-15) c 63 2 mM Rat bronchioalveolar epithelial cells Increase in Isc/ 22Na influx 64, 65 100 M Rat ATII cells Increase in whole cell activity 66 4 mM Human A549 cells Increase in whole cell activity 67 10 M Frog urinary bladder epithelium Increase in whole cell activity 68, 69 0.1 - 1000 M Heterologous human ENaC in oocytes Increase in whole cell activity 16 our results using Ussing chamber and voltage clamp techniques showed that 8-pCPT-cGMP increased the amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current across H441 cell monolayers. also increased heterologously expressed -ENaC activity in a dose-dependent manner, most probably through the stimulation of PKGII enzymatic activity. extracellular ligand pathway In contrast to native ENaC, heterologously expressed -ENaC in oocytes has been considered to be cAMP/PKA-independent. a critical extracellular domain has recently been identified as the 8-CPT-cAMP binding site 21. extracellular sodium self-inhibition of ENaC activity differs from the down-regulation of ENaC activity by slowly accumulating intracellular Na+ content in a feedback manner. it maintains salt and fluid homeostasis at the luminal surface of the respiratory system to keep normal cilia beating in the airways. self-inhibition was initiated by fast switching the low sodium bath solution (1 mM sodium) to regular ND96 medium (96 mM sodium). A: Whole-cell current trace digitized at -60 mV. the responses of human -ENaC to these compounds were compared. the normalized currents before and after application of these compounds were compared with that of the standard cGMP molecule (Std cGMP) V348 is located in the center of the palm region of the subunit. H233 is located in the vicinity of the putative binding site for protons. these domains potentially allosterically interact with CPT-cGMP. p-chloromercuribenzoate benzimidazolylguanidine 30-33, protons 26, cupper 34, and proteases 28, 35, 36 are also proposed to modulate ENaC-gating by relieving sodium self-inhibition. cleavage at a minimum of two sites within the - or -ENaC subunits is required to activate the channel. exon 11 in the -subunit encodes a module that regulates channel gating 41. largely eliminated the sodium self-inhibition response reflecting a down-regulation of ENaC open probability by extracellular sodium 42. the clinical relevance of the abnormal regulation of ENaC by CPT-cAMP has been implicated in the upregulation of ENaC in autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 46. another distressed transapical sodium transport occurs in injured lungs, for example, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) cGMP activates ENaC via cGMP/cGKII pathway intracellularly 24. cGMP increased in murine and rat lungs both in vivo and in vitro. cGMP may increase cGMP-sensitive pathway for lung fluid removal from alveolar sacs 61. edema mainly caused by injured pulmonary vasculature or post regeneration of alveolar epithelium by stem cells/progenitors. external Zn2+ rapidly and reversibly activates ENaC in a dose-dependent manner by relieving the channel from sodium self-inhibition. ENaC mutants with mutations C33A, C41A, or C33A/C41A have significantly enhanced sodium self-inhibition and reduced open probability compared with wild type ENaCs. exon 11 in the -subunit encodes a module that regulates channel gating 41. an autosomal recessive form of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is caused by mutations in ENaC. the relief of self-inhibition by CPT-cAMP contributes to the acute effects. cGMP may serve as an autocrine and paracrine to regulate ENaC. a large dose of cGMP compound (1 mg/kg) was administered to patients as reported by two clinical trials. it is therefore feasible to apply aerosolized nucleotides to mitigate edematous lung injury. cGMP up-regulates ENaC via two mechanisms: release self-inhibition externally and activates ENaC through cGMP/cGKII pathway intracellularly 24. the integrity of the tight alveolar epithelium should be considered for the use of ENaC agonists. the anticipated restore of alveolar fluid clearance may be seen at the earlier stage of ALI and lung edema mainly caused by injured pulmonary vasculature."}
