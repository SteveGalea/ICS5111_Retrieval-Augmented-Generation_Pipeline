{"summary": "infections in humans are usually asymptomatic, but some individuals develop fever and/or flu-like symptoms. most of the more than 70 strains of WNV are classified in either lineage 1 or lineage 2 (5, 6, 28, 33) lineage 1 WNV strains are endemic in northern Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia and the Americas. eIF2 reduces the amount of available eIF2-GTP-tRNA complex and thus inhibits translation initiation. RNA-binding proteins such as TIA-1, TIAR, and G3BP can then bind to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA with a stalled initiation complex and aggregate with other mRNA-bound proteins. translation from internal ribosome entry site elements and alternative open reading frames (ORFs) still occurs (51). 2/1 infectious chimeric W956IC virus activated PKR, while WNV Eg101 infections did not (16) none of the natural lineage 1 or lineage 2 WNV strains tested induced SGs by 24 h after infection, while W956IC virus infections efficiently induced SGs starting at 12 h after infection. the PERK+/+, PERK/, GCN2/, and HRI/ cells are allelic knockouts. the PKR/ cells express a nonfunctional PKR due to a deletion of the RNA-binding domain located in exons 2 to 4 (57) the 956D117B3/Eg101 infectious clone SP6WNEg3\u2032/Xba was described previously (56) the capsid, NS1, NS2a, NS3-NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 lineage 2 gene regions or combinations of these gene regions were replaced in the W956IC backbone with the corresponding lineage 1 genes from Eg101. additional chimeras were created by amplifying the following fragments from Eg101 RNA and cloning them into W956IC. Eg-NS1 contains sequence encoding the C-terminal 23 amino acids [aa] of E; Eg-NS2a+2b+3N. 3C+4aN (referred to as Eg-NS1+3+4a) chimera, a MunI (nt 2393)-NsiI (nt 3513) fragment was amplified from Eg101 and cloned into the Eg-NS5 chimera. all of the chimeric clones were validated by sequencing. images were taken using an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with either a 63 water immersion or 100 oil immersion objective. SG-positive infected cells were stained with anti-dsRNA antibody to detect infected cells. primary antibodies used were anti-p-PKR (T451) (Millipore), anti-PKR (SCBT), anti-p-eIF2 (Ser51) and anti-eIF2 (Cell Signaling) secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anti-mouse HRP (Cell Signaling) the PERK/, GCN2/, and HRI/ cells are allelic knockouts. the PKR/ cells express a nonfunctional PKR due to a deletion of the RNA-binding domain located in exons 2 to 4 (57) g78, and SPU were provided by Robert Tesh (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) titers of these stocks were as follows (in PFU/ml): Eg101, 1 108; W956IC, 5 107; NY99, 1 108; Tx113, 5 107; B956, 1 107; Mg78, 3 106; and SPU, 7 107. an 89- to 484-nt fragment containing a unique BglII site was amplified from Eg101 RNA. a 465- to 918-nt fragment containing an MfeI site was amplified from W956IC. additional chimeras were created by amplifying the following fragments from Eg101 RNA and cloning them into W956IC. clone contains sequence encoding the C-terminal 214 aa of NS4b. a MunI (nt 2393)-NsiI (nt 3513) fragment was amplified from Eg101. a MunI (nt 2393)-NsiI (nt 3513) fragment was amplified from Eg101. anti-dcp1a antibody was diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.5 g/ml Hoechst 33258 dye. images were taken using an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with either a 63 water immersion or 100 oil immersion objective. the mean CT value was plotted on the standard curve to estimate the number of viral genome copies per 1 g of total RNA in each cell extract sample. primary antibodies were anti-p-PKR (T451) (Millipore), anti-PKR (SCBT), anti-p-eIF2 (Ser51) and anti-eIF2 (Cell Signaling) and anti-actin (Abcam) RESULTS Efficiency of SG formation induced by different strains of WNV. it was previously reported that lineage 2-based W956IC virus infections induced PKR phosphorylation while lineage 1 WNV Eg101 infections did not. cells were infected with either Eg101 (lineage 1) or W956IC (lineage 2/1-based infectious clone) virus at an MOI of 1 and analyzed for SGs and dsRNA at the indicated times after infection. the total number of infected cells and the number of SG-positive, infected cells were counted. -infected cells were detected at either 6 or 12 h after infection. by 24 h and 36 h, less than 1% and less than 3% of the cells contained SGs. in contrast, 25% of the cells were SG positive at 24 h after infection. 35% were SG positive by 36 h. 47.5 PBs/cell and W956IC-infected cells had 39.03 PBs/cell. the results showed that both Eg101 and W956IC infections reduced PB numbers. PB numbers were also reduced in BHK cells infected with the NY99, Tx113, B956, Mg78, and SPU strains of WNV. MEF cultures each contained 8 to 12% SG-positive, Eg101-infected cells or 15 to 20% SG-positive, W956IC-infected cells at 24 h. however, no SGs were observed in PKR/ cells infected with either virus. dsRNA antibody (red), and nuclei with Hoechst dye (blue) indicate SG-positive cells. the percentage of infected cells containing SGs was determined as described in Materials and Methods. the percentage of infected cells containing SGs was determined. approximately 20% of the W956IC-infected cells were SG positive in untreated, DMSO-treated, and 0.2 mM 2-AP-treated cultures. only 10% of the cells were SG positive in the 1 mM 2-AP-treated cultures. an MTT assay showed a 4% decrease in cell viability after 0.2 mM 2-AP treatment, a 6% decrease after 1 mM 2-AP treatment, and an 25% decrease after 5 mM 2-AP treatment phosphorylated PKR and eIF2 were detected in IC-infected cultures. eIF2 phosphorylation was not detected in any of the WNV Eg101-infected lysates. similar levels of total eIF2 were detected by 16 h after infection. ates were collected in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer at indicated times (hours) after infection and analyzed using antibodies to phosphorylated PKR (Thr541), PKR, phosphorylated eIF2 (Ser51), eIF2 and actin. more than 95% of the cells were infected. 956D117B3 cDNA was used to construct the majority of the NS5 clone. the C terminus of the NS5 gene through the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) was amplified from WNV Eg101 genomic RNA (56) additional chimeric W956IC genomes were made by replacing one or more W956IC genome regions with the Eg101 equivalent. the Eg-NS2a+2b chimera contained Eg101 sequence encoding all of NS2a and NS2b as well as the N-terminal 178 aa of NS3. twenty-two NS3 aa and 8 NS4a aa differed between Eg101 and W956IC. additional chimeric viruses were created by replacing one or more W956IC gene regions with the Eg101 equivalent on the W956IC backbone. the number of amino acid differences between Eg101 and W956IC is indicated above each replaced gene segment. SGs were detected with anti-G3BP antibody (green), WNV-infected cells with anti-dsRNA antibody (red), and nuclei with Hoechst dye (blue) the total number of infected cells and the number of SG-positive, infected cells were counted. the percentage of infected cells containing SGs was determined as described in Materials and Methods. yields from Eg-C, Eg-NS1, Eg-NS2a+2b, Eg-NS3+4a, and Eg-NS4b chimeric virus infections at 24 and 36 h were similar to those of both the Eg-C and the W956IC infections. however, the yield of Eg-NS1+4b+5 and Eg-NS1+3+4a chimeric virus infections produced slightly reduced virus yields at 24 and 36 h total cellular RNA was collected at 12 h after infection. W956IC infections synthesized the highest levels of viral RNA by 12 h. Eg101 infections synthesized the lowest levels of viral RNA. intracellular ER membranes intact, while 0.1% Triton X-100 solubilizes both plasma and ER membranes. cells were infected with WNV Eg101 or W956IC at an MOI of 5. after 4% paraformaldehyde fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% or 0.01% Triton X-100. BHK cells were infected with WNV Eg101 or W956IC at an MOI of 5, fixed at 12 h after infection, permeabilized with either 0.1% or 0.01% Triton X-100, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. the total number of cells and the number of dsRNA signal-positive cells from 0.01% Triton X-100-treated cells were counted. SGs in 30% of infected BHK cells by 36 h after infection. anti-g3BP antibody (green) was used to detect SGs, anti-dsRNA antibody (red) to detect WNV-infected cells, and Hoechst dye (blue) to detect nuclei. PBs were counted to determine the average number per infected cell. bars indicate standard deviations (SD) the time course of SG formation was next analyzed. BHK cells were infected with either WNV Eg101 or W956IC. the number of PBs in WNV Eg101- and dengue 2 virus-infected BHK cells was reduced by 24 h after infection (17). PB numbers were also reduced in BHK cells infected with the NY99, Tx113, B956, Mg78, and SPU strains of WNV compared to numbers in mock-infected cells. SGs were detected in control, PERK/, GCN2/, and HRI/ MEFs. no SGs were observed in PKR/ cells infected with either virus. the increased levels of SGs observed in WNV-infected MEFs are PKR dependent. control MEFs (C57BL/6 and PERK+/+) and eIF2 kinase knockout MEFs (PKR/, PERK/, GCN2/, and HRI/) were infected with WNV Eg101 or W956IC at an MOI of 1, fixed at 24 h after infection. SGs were detected with anti-G3BP antibody (green), WNV-infected cells with anti-dsRNA antibody (red), PKR/ MEFs were infected with W956IC (MOI of 1). Virus yields were measured by plaque assay in BHK cells. PKR is the kinase responsible for the formation of SGs in WNV-infected cells. the yields of W956IC virus from PKR/ MEFs were significantly higher than those from the control MEFs. previously reported involvement of PKR in IFN- production in WNV-infected cells could also contribute to the decrease in virus production observed (20). increased eIF2 phosphorylation in Eg101-infected BHK cells in absence of PKR phosphorylation suggested this was due to the activation of another eIF2 kinase. western blot analysis of BHK cells infected with WNV Eg101 or W956IC. the cDNA plasmid was constructed from a highly passaged WNV B956 virus stock, designated 956D117B3 (56) the 956D117B3 sequence differs from that of B956 by 32 single nucleotide substitutions within the coding region. additional chimeric W956IC genomes were made by replacing one or more W956IC genome regions with the Eg101 equivalent as described in Materials and Methods. all of the chimeric clones constructed contained the 3\u2032 UTR from Eg101. all but the Eg-NS4b+5 and Eg-NS1+4b+5 clones contained a 956D117B3/Eg101 hybrid NS5 gene. the capsid gene was replaced by Eg101 sequence in the chimera. 5 chimera contained Eg101 sequence encoding the C-terminal 214 aa of NS4b and N-terminal 410 aa of NS5. the C-terminal region of NS5 in W956IC was already Eg101 sequence and contained no amino acid changes. -NS4b+5 (3%), Eg-NS1+3+4a (3%), and Eg-NS1+4b+5 (3%) chimeric virus infections induced a low number of SG-positive, infected cells similar to the result seen with Eg101 infections. higher levels of early viral RNA synthesis correlate with increased early virus yields and more SG-positive, infected cells. the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RNA in each sample was measured by real-time RT-PCR as an internal control for sample variation. the growth kinetics of the various chimeric viruses was analyzed to determine whether the differential SG phenotype was due to differences in the growth efficiencies of these viruses. the yield of Eg-NS1+4b+5 virus was slightly decreased at 24 h. levels comparable to those seen with Eg101 and W956IC virus infections were observed by 36 h. more efficient SG induction in infected cells correlate with increased levels of viral RNA synthesis at early times after infection. viral dsRNA in infected cells is sensed by the pathogen recognition receptors PKR, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation factor 5 (MDA5). dsRNA was detected in 25% of the infected cells but in only 4% of the Eg101-infected cultures. a maximum of 35% of W956IC-infected cells have high levels of early viral RNA is not known. exposed viral dsRNA was detected in 0.01% Triton X-100-permeabilized W956IC-infected, but not Eg101-infected, cells. infections with natural lineage 1 and lineage 2 strains of WNV did not activate PKR. infections with a respiratory syncytial virus induced a higher number of SG-positive, infected cells than natural RSV strain infections. natural WNV infections were previously reported to induce the UPR at later times of infection (1). the chimeric junction in the W956IC genome produces a 956D117B3/Eg101 hybrid NS5. this hybrid NS5 did not cause a reduction in the replication efficiency of the virus. cyclization of the genome through base pairing between 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 RNA sequences was required for RNA replication (7, 23, 58) it was previously shown that cyclization of the genome through base pairing between 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 RNA sequences was required for RNA replication (7, 23, 58). it has also been reported that the WNV 5\u2032 UTR interacts with the NS5 protein, which contains an N-terminal methyltransferase domain. 1, 22 in NS3, 8 in NS4a, 9 in NS4b, and 24 in the N-terminal region of NS5. the majority of the 140 aa differences between the Eg101 and W956IC sequences are conservative changes. however, the amino acid differences at five sites were unique to the W956IC and 956D117B3 proteins. phenotype of Eg101 NS1, NS3 and NS4a proteins produced low levels of early viral RNA synthesis. changing particular amino acids in either the C-terminal region of NS4b and the combined NS1, NS3 and NS4a region can rescue the \u201cnatural\u201d WNV strain phenotype of Eg101 in the context of the W956IC genome with an N-terminal NS5 region. early viral RNA synthesis also results in the induction of higher early levels of type I IFN."}
