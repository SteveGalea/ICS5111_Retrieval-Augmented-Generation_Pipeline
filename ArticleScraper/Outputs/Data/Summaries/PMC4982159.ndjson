{"summary": "we interviewed clinicians, reviewed regional records, and searched a national laboratory database. aimed to interview and test all members of the 4 households of the 5 known MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients. on June 5, trained nurses collected 1 oropharyngeal and 1 nasopharyngeal swab for rRT-PCR. rRT-PCR of oropharyngeal swabs may 21\u201323; serologic testing was not performed. all staff and a convenience sample of patients who visited the clinic on June 4 were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. all animal workers at 2 local slaughterhouse facilities and a convenience sample of persons with daily animal contact were interviewed and tested. a household secondary transmission analysis comprised relatives >14 years of age residing only in the 4 affected households. results for MERS-CoV\u2013positive household members who had illness onset (or tested MERS-CoV\u2013positive) at least 2 days after the household\u2019s index patient\u2019s illness onset were compared with results for MERS-CoV\u2013negative household members. an index patient was defined as the person with rRT-PCR confirmation of MERS-CoV who had the earliest date of symptom onset in the household. all hospital staff members who treated the first identified MERS-CoV patient from his admission on may 9 until his MERS-CoV diagnosis on may 20 underwent hospital-based rRT-PCR of oropharyngeal swabs. a household secondary transmission analysis comprised relatives >14 years of age residing only in the 4 affected households. results nineteen extended family members had evidence of MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR or presence of MERS-CoV antibodies. all 26 visiting relatives were MERS-CoV\u2013negative by both rRT-PCR and (for adults) serology. patients are lettered in order of symptom onset or, if asymptomatic, by test date. all persons living in households 1\u20134 were tested, except for 2 adults living in household 4. 19 family members received a MERS-CoV diagnosis, al-Qouz, Saudi Arabia, 2014*. patient age, y/sex Underlying condition Symptoms Hospitalization Disposition Test result Presenting Onset date Admission date Intubated rRT-PCR Antibody A 32/M None Fever, cough, diarrhea Apr 18 Apr 21 No Discharged Apr 28 Neg: Apr 21, Apr 23, Apr 24, Jun 5 ELISA >6,400; IFA pas; MNT 80 B 70/M May 27 Pos: May 29 Not tested J 39/M DM, HTN Fever, cough, sore throat, chest pain May 22 May 27 Yes Discharged Jul 1 Pos: May 28 Not tested K 73/M DM, HTN, CAD Fever, cough, hypoglycemia Jun 4 Jun 6 Yes Died Jun 20 Pos: Jun 9 Not tested L 27/M None Tested as a contact; cough Unknown No medical care No Well Pos: May 23 Neg: Jun 5 EL rRT-PCR was conducted at the time of illness (or among asymptomatic persons as part of routine contact tracing) all serologic specimens were collected on June 5, 2014. patients M and N reported symptoms during the month preceding their positive serology tests but also without a specific onset date. ddah, the first patient in this family to become ill, had 3 negative rRT-PCR results of nasopharyngeal swabs. 11 (58%) were hospitalized; 3 (16%) were treated in an emergency department for symptoms but not hospitalized; 3 (16%) were asymptomatic. 5 (26%) were intubated, 2 of whom died while hospitalized.
