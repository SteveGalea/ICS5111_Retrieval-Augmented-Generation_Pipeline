{"summary": "1,2 Adrenal insufficiency is related to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. secondary refers to inadequate or deficient release of adrenocorticotropic hormone. tertiary refers to disordered hypothalamic production of corticotropin releasing hormone. APS type 1 is an autosomal recessive disorder related to mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene. adrenocortical insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, candidiasis, dental enamel hypoplasia, and nail dystrophy are examples of other autoimmune disorders that may be associated with APS type 1. APS type 2 has a male-to-female ratio of 1:3 and is relatively common with an incidence of 1-2:10 000/year. clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency include hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. a 15-year-old male presented to a local hospital with fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for a few days prior to presentation. he reported a severe viral illness roughly 6 weeks prior to his presentation. laboratory studies were significant for hyponatremia and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) coronavirus panel was positive for coronavirus, which may have precipitated the acute illness. adrenoleukodystrophy was a possible etiology for the adrenal insufficiency. the diabetes autoimmune test group was normal, but the TSH remained elevated with a normal T4. APS type 2 has been reported,12-15 there are few reports of pediatric patients. there is a need for continued surveillance over a lifetime. there is potential for development of other autoimmune disorders even decades after the initial diagnosis. insufficiency is a rare diagnosis in pediatric patients. the presence of adrenal antibodies confirms an autoimmune cause. it is important to screen for other autoimmune diseases."}
