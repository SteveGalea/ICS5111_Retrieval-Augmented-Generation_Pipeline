{"summary": "the standard treatment of acute KD is a combination of high-dose (2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and oral aspirin (50 mg/kg/day) the acute phase of KD involves platelet activation, and antiplatelet therapy is included in the treatment protocol for this phase (1). PDMPs are a heterogeneous population of vesicles generated from the plasma membrane upon platelet activation by various stimuli. an increase in the total number of PDMPs is associated with disease states such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, sepsis, and pulmonary hypertension (7). ELISA kit (Zymuphen MP-activity; Medicago, Uppsala, Sweden) expressed as phosphatidylserine equivalents (nmol) the assay performance and characteristics were as follows: detection threshold, not more than 0.05 nmol; 3) intraassay coefficient of variation (CV), 3% to 8%; and 3) interassay CV, 5% to 10%. differences in continuous variables among groups were assessed using the 2-sample t-test and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) the significance of difference was calculated by the Scheffe's test. assay performance and characteristics were as follows: detection threshold, not more than 0.05 nmol; 3) intraassay coefficient of variation (CV), 3% to 8%; and 3) interassay CV, 5% to 10%. blood samples were collected from the patients with KD at the following times. differences in continuous variables among groups were assessed using the 2-sample t-test and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) the significance of difference was calculated by the Scheffe's test. three patients were crossed over methylprednisolone pulse therapy with a second IVIG treatment. the mean period of low-dose ASA usage in patients with KD was 53.27 8.21 days (range, 41\u201375 days) 4.3% (2/46) experienced a recurrence of KD during the follow-up period. g/dL 4.09 0.26 4.10 0.19 4.29 0.16 0.066 AST, U/L 97.35 136.06 43.52 20.08 44.50 18.99 0.091 ALT, U/L 102.91 188.05 22.09 21.28 22.50 8.39 0.057 ESR, mm/hr 46.96 27.18 24.15 19.82 8.86 5.84 0.001 CRP, mg/dL 5.31 3.59 levels of PDMPs in the plasma of 23 febrile controls and 10 afebrile controls subjects were not significantly different (9.27 5.91 nmol [2.99\u201333.92] in febrile controls vs 8.18 2.88 nmol [5.45\u201312.86] in afebrile controls, P = 0.872) BMI, kg/m2 15.53 1.35 16.78 2.23 0.100 Total fever duration, day 7.50 2.01 7.22 1.83 0.681 Hemoglobin, g/dL 11.34 0.76 11.65 0.83 0.282 WBC, 103/L 13.44 3.53 13.44 4.47 0.998 Neutrophil, % 75.81 8.24 63.79 12.88 0.008 Platelet count, 104/L 32.76 12.33 34.09 11.87 0.757 plasma PDMP levels significantly increased after IVIG infusion.

PDMP levels in 17 patients with KD rebounded at 2\u20133 months after discontinuing ASA. a total of 33 control group was enrolled for the study. 26 patients (56.5%) were diagnosed with complete KD and 20 patients (43.5%) with incomplete KD. the levels of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, ESR, CRP, and NT-proBNP were significantly higher in KD patients. the level of hemoglobin was lower in KD patients compared with the afebrile control patients (P = 0.034). the mean plasma PDMP levels in the control groups were not significantly different (9.27 5.91 nmol) the mean plasma PDMP levels were not significantly different (9.27 5.91 nmol). plasma PDMP levels at 2\u20135 days after IVIG infusion were significantly higher than those in febrile control patients. no difference was found in PDMPs, albumin, NT-proBNP, and CRP levels between patients with and without CALs. Fig. 2 shows the change in PDMP levels in patients with KD. plasma PDMP levels significantly increased (12.04 5.58 nmol before IVIG infusion vs. 19.81 13.21 nmol at 2\u20135 days after IVIG infusion. the PDMP levels at 9\u201315 days after IVIG infusion (8.33 2.02 nmol) were significantly lower than the pre-IVIG level (P 0.001). however, 17 patients (36.9%) had a recurrent rising PDMP levels after 67.41 11.83 days (range, 47\u201395 days), when ASA was discontinued. none of the KD patients developed coronary artery aneurysm as confirmed by serial echocardiography before and after IVIG therapy. there was no difference between KD patients and febrile control patients in the degree of left ventricular fractional shortening. correlations between PDMP levels and other parameters In patients with KD, age was negatively correlated with initial PDMP levels (r = 0.312; P = 0.037) positive correlation was found between PDMPs and procalcitonin levels after IVIG treatment in the acute stage of KD. pg/mL 0.131 0.395 PDMP = platelet-derived microparticle, KD = Kawasaki disease, BMI = body mass index, WBC = white blood cell, CRP = C-reactive protein, HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. PDMP levels were significantly elevated in patients with KD immediately after IVIG treatment. PDMP levels decreased from the subacute stage to the convalescent phase during antiplatelet therapy. platelets are well-established components of the hemostatic system and are recognized as having a role in innate immunity (11) PDMPs are the most abundant microparticles in the blood stream constituting approximately 70% to 90% of circulating microparticles (14). the vesicles can easily be mistaken as purely detrimental. but these microparticles are present in healthy individuals. a recent study showed that IVIG treatment significantly decreased PDMP levels in 18 patients with acute KD (17) they showed that the PDMP levels both immediately and 10\u201314 days after IVIG treatment were significantly lower than the pre-IVIG level. in contrast, we could find significant increase in PDMP level 2\u20135 days after IVIG treatment compared with the pre-IVIG level. microparticle activity can be analyzed by prothrombinase assay (ELISA) the PDMP levels of 17 patients rebounded after aspirin was discontinued. these results suggest that vascular inflammation may persist after the convalescent phase even if the morphology of the coronary arteries appears normal onechocardiography. a recent study showed that abciximab treatments have an important role in the management of severe complications of KD. prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to fully evaluate their efficacy in preventing thrombotic complications and promoting vascular remodeling."}
