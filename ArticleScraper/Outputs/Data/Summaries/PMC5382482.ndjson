{"summary": "the median PPlasma was 0.2 % (90 % P.I.: 0.003 %; 2.6 %). the annual probability of introducing PEDV into the Danish pig population by imported SDPP appeared very low. however, if PEDV survived the spray-drying process, storage was insufficient to completely remove the remaining viable virus. able disease could be imported more safely if producers find a way to substantiate freedom from disease in herds delivering blood for SDPP. the batch of tests negative for PEDV and conditions for processing/storage required by the international laws are respected."}
