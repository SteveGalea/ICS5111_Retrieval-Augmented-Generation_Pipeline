{"summary": "CNS insults, including autoimmune disease, initiate rapid astrocyte activation characterized by cellular hypertrophy and increased intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. this barrier subsequently impedes axonal regeneration contributing to sustained disability. astrocyte activation constitutes a ubiquitous, yet heterogeneous response associated with both promoting and inhibiting CNS repair [3]\u2013[5]. IFN- mediated protection during EAE is also multifaceted [12]\u2013[15]. it acts as a negative regulator of neutrophil accumulation, Th17 cell activation, IL-1R signaling, protease secretion, and chemokine activity. it also inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion via induction of suppressor of cytokine secretion (SOCS) proteins, facilitates T cell apoptosis and protects oligodend EAE was induced in transgenic mice expressing a signaling deficient dominant negative IFN- receptor 1 specifically on astrocytes. this is consistent with both the CNS restricted transgene expression in the GFAPR1 mice as well as the similar T cell activation following peripheral immunization with a non-self antigen. however, clinical symptoms in both groups began to diverge from wt mice at day 12 post immunization (p.i.) prior to the peak of clinical wt C57BL/6 GFAPR1 Incidence 100% (n = 35) 100% (n = 40) Mean day of onset 92 92 Peak Disease Scorea 3.10.2 4.00.3* Mortalityb 3% (1/35) 38% (15/40)* a Peak disease score determined at day 18 post immunization. myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) reactive CD4+ T cells secreting IFN- were also similar. reduced Th17 and Tregs may be attributed to increased disease severity. increased disease severity may reflect reduced bioavailable IFN- due to sequestration of IFN- binding to the dominant negative receptor. reduced Th17 cell and Treg frequencies were consistent with suppression of these populations due to elevated IFN- [10], [16], [20].

IL-27 secretion by astrocytes was significantly reduced in cultures derived from wt and wt mice. this data supports the possibility that IFN-mediated IL-27 secretion by astrocytes regulates EAE effector T cell function. this does not exclude the possibility that the inability of astrocytes to respond to IFN- could directly or indirectly dysregulate a variety of other immunomodulatory functions. clinical symptoms in astrocytes (GFAPR1 mice) began to diverge from wt mice at day 12 post immunization (p.i.) this is consistent with both the CNS restricted transgene expression in the GFAPR1 mice as well as the similar T cell activation following peripheral immunization with a non-self antigen. wt C57BL/6 GFAPR1 Incidence 100% (n = 35) 100% (n = 40) Mean day of onset 92 92 Peak Disease Scorea 3.10.2 4.00.3* Mortalityb 3% (1/35) 38% (15/40)* a Peak disease score determined at day 18 post immunization. myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) reactive CD4+ T cells secreting IFN- were also similar. reduced Th17 and Tregs may be attributed to increased IFN-. increased disease severity may reflect reduced bioavailable IFN-.

IFN- was 2-fold higher in the CNS of GFAPR1 mice. IFN- signaling to astrocytes altered cytokine expression. this does not exclude the possibility that inability of astrocytes to respond to IFN- could directly or indirectly dysregulate other immunomodulatory functions. the activity of astrocytes during autoimmunity ranges from pro- to anti-inflammatory. astrocytes contribute to the loss of BBB integrity via secretion of reactive oxygen species, chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. astrocytes may limit inflammation by triggering apoptosis in T cells. increased IFN- production may reflect an attempt to compensate for the loss of IFN- dependent astrocyte mediated control of inflammation. regulation of microglia activation, including TNF secretion, remains unclear. astrocytes are a potential source of the IFN- induced chemokine CXCL10 during EAE. pathology further correlated with decreases in both Tregs and IL-10, but not with increased antigen specific Th17 cells. the absence of reactive astrocytes increases axonal regeneration after injury. the absence of reactive astrocytes increases axonal regeneration after injury. this is consistent with the concept that limiting astrogliosis is critical. the identification of astrocytes as critical responders and mediators of IFN- signaling in limiting CNS autoimmune disease may provide insights into new approaches to limit long term progression to disability. mice expressing a dominant negative IFN- receptor alpha chain under control of GFAP promoter were bred locally. Flow Cytometry Brains and spinal cords from perfused mice were homogenized separately. supernatants were stored at -80\u00b0C for cytokine determination. microglia and inflammatory cells were distinguished based on differential CD45 expression. NS cells with 20 g/ml peptide for 6 h at 37\u00b0C with GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) added for the last 4 h. intracellular cytokines were detected with FITC-anti-IFN- (clone XMG1.2; BD Biosciences) and PE-anti-IL-17 (clone TC11-18H10; BD Biosciences) astrocytes identified with anti-GFAP (AbCam, Cambridge, MA) and axonal integrity with SMI-31 and SMI-32 mAb (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, MD) and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) sections from at least 3 separate experiments were reviewed in a blinded manner. astrocyte Cultures Mixed glial cultures were established from neonatal GFAPR1 and wt mice as previously described. IL-27 secretion was determined 48 h after rIFN- (100 ng/ml) stimulation. expression levels were normalized to ubiquitin or GAPDH. eAE EAE was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35\u201355 peptide emulsified at 3 mg/ml in PBS with an equal amount of incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. mice were immunized subcutaneously with 200 l emulsion distributed over two sites on the flanks. FITC, PE, PerCP, and APC conjugates with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used to identify microglia and inflammatory cells were: CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a (53-6.7), CD45 (30-F11), MHC class II (2G9), Ly6G (1A8) (BD Biosciences), and F4/80 (Serotec, Raleigh, NC) data was analyzed using FlowJo (7.6.1) software. IL-27 was measured using QUANTIKINE Mouse IL-27p28 Immunoassays. brains and spinal cords were fixed with Clark\u2019s solution. spinal cords were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Andwin Scientific, Tryon, NC) spinal cords were embedded in flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80\u00b0C. blocks were warmed to 20\u00b0C prior to cutting 10 m sections by cryostat. expression levels were normalized to ubiquitin or GAPDH. samples from individual mice were analyzed in duplicate or triplicate with 3 or more mice per group. p0.05 was considered statistically significant."}
