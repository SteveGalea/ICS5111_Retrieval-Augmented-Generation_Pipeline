{"summary": "a \u2018mismatch between present professional competencies and the requirements of an increasingly interdependent world\u2019 has been identified. postgraduate training should take account of the increasingly global nature of health; this paper examines the extent to which they currently do. a range of reasons why UK-based health-care workers would benefit from an awareness in global health are listed in box 1. a greater awareness of current global infectious trends will help us prepare for and deal with UK spread. general medical council guidelines for undergraduate medical training \u2018Tomorrow's Doctors\u2019 include the learning outcome: \u2018Discuss from a global perspective the determinants of health and disease and variations in health-care delivery and medical practice\u20196 and global health learning outcomes for all UK medical students have recently been developed. this is welcome progress but without a similar shift in postgraduate training, is not sufficient. the competencies were coded as \u2018UK\u2019 (statement only relevant to UK work, often referring to UK institutions or structures), \u2018global\u2019 (statement with an explicit reference to aspects of health outside the UK such as the global burden of disease or organizations involved in international health-care issues). results of coding of postgraduate medical and surgical curricula Global Generic UK Total FPH are from this previous work.
