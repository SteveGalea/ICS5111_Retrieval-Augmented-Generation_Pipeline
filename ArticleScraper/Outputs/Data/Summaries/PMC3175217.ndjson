{"summary": "the origin of the exacerbated cytokine response is unclear. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between host cytokine responses and viral levels. a number of studies report increased and persistent levels of cytokines and chemokines paralleling severe disease. a exacerbated cytokine response can contribute to immune-mediated tissue damage during viral infections. the cause of the observed hypercytokinemia in 2009 pandemic influenza is unclear. a standard survey was employed to collect clinical data, including history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, haematological, biochemical, radiological and microbiological investigation in all participants centers. informed consent was obtained directly from each patient or their legal representative and also from healthy controls before enrolment. cRNA control was manufactured from PCR product cloned into plasmid (pGEM-T Easy Vector System, Promega) this plasmid contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream of the insert to drive transcription by this enzyme. the plasmid was linearized with a restriction enzyme downstream of the insert. RNA was purified using MEGAclear Kit (Ambion) inactivated pandemic influenza A/California/07/2009 antigens were measured in patients and controls by using the multiplex Bio-Rad 27-plex assay. the system allows for quantitative measurement of 27 different chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and immune mediators while consuming a small amount of biological material. ICUs with primary viral pneumonia during acute phase of influenza virus illness were recruited from November 1st to December 31st 2009. only those patients with confirmed H1N1 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in the study. cRNA control was manufactured from PCR product cloned into plasmid. this plasmid contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter downstream of the insert. RNA was purified using MEGAclear kit (Ambion) 98.3% efficiency was directly detected in the initial positive pharyngeal swab by RT-PCR and sequencing of a 1296-bp fragment of the neuraminidase gene for the presence of the mutation H274Y. standard respiratory and blood cultures were performed to assess the presence of bacterial and fungal infection. Statistical analysis The Mann-Whitney U test was employed for cytokine comparison purposes. the levene test demonstrated absence of homogeneity of variance in both MV and NMV groups. results Clinical data (table 1) Table 1. n.a Oseltamivir 15/0 8/0 Duration of symptoms before oseltamivir 4.8 (3.7) 4.6 (2.4) Bilateral infiltrates in chest X-Ray at admission to ICU (yes/no) 14/1 6/2 Bacterial overinfection during hospitalization (yes/no) chronic respiratory disease and smoking were the most frequent accompanying medical conditions in our cohort. patients in the MV group showed the most severe respiratory status at admission, based on their Pa O2/Fi O2 values and SOFA scores. p > 0.05 was found in the proportion of fatal cases between the patients who received early treatment with steroids (n = 2 fatal cases) and those who did not receive that treatment. virology co-infection by other respiratory viruses was excluded in all recruited patients. MV patients with the viral mutation D222G/N did not show differences in pharyngeal viral load compared to those MV patients for whom this mutation was absent. cytokine profiles showed significantly higher levels of three chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1), two cellular growth factors (VEGF, GM-CSF) and two immuno-modulatory cytokines (IL-1ra, IL-10) in the MV group compared to the NMV steroids in the first 24 hours following admission to the ICU revealed significant higher levels in the latter of IL-1RA, IP-10, VEGF, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1, IL-12p70 and IFN-. a significant positive correlation was found between all of them, except for the pair formed by (IL-8, IL12p70) pandemic influenza vaccine (yes/no) 0/15 0/8 Chronic respiratory disease (yes/no) 3/12 2/6 Renal disease (yes/no) 1/14 2/6 Cardiovascular disease (yes/no) 2/13 0/8 Neurological disease (yes/no) 3/12 1/7 Cancer (yes/no) 0/15 1/7 Obesity (BMI > 30) (yes/no) 1/14 1/7 Diabetes (yes/no) Creatinine (ref value: 0.5 - 1.2 mg/dl) 0.8 (0.4) 1.9 (3.0) AST (ref value: 2-38 U/l) 91.2 (65.3) 73.8 (39.9) ALT (ref value: 2-41 U/l) 43.1 (31.0) 75.6 (59.9) CPK (ref value: 24- 194 U/ml) 850.7 (827.0) 449.0 (697.8) Chronic respiratory disease and smoking patients showed elevated levels of AST and CPK at the first contact with the critical care services. six out of fifteen MV patients (40.0%) received steroidal treatment (oseltamivir) upon admission to the ICU. no patients in the NMV group suffered from bacterial infection during hospitalization. MV patients showed a viral load of 236.25 copies/ml. no significant correlation between viral RNA load in plasma and APACHE II severity score. cellular growth factors (VEGF, GM-CSF) and two immuno-modulatory cytokines (IL-1ra, IL-10) in the MV group compared to the NMV one. MV patients showed also higher levels of two Th1 cytokines (IL-12p70, IFN-) and a pro-Th17 cytokine (IL-6) (p 0.1) VEGF (0.52), IL-6 (0.46), MIP-1 (0.65), IL-12p70 (0.50), GM-CSF (0.45), IFN- (0.46) (p 0.05) correlation analysis also showed an association between IL-8 (0.37), MCP-1 (0.39) and viral load at the level (p 0.1) cytokine profiles were compared at a punctual moment in the disease course. this approach showed that, at admission, the most severe patients showed an exuberant cytokine and chemokine response, in consonance with previous reports [3,7,8]. this new work aimed to analyze the relationship between viral replication and host cytokine response. IL-1ra is an immuno-modulatory molecule. it could represent an attempt to prevent cytokine-driven inflammatory damage. cytokines such as IL-6 could interfere with the development of adaptive immunity response to virus. only one severe patient was infected by a virus containing the H275Y mutation in the NA gene. the potential influence of oseltamivir resistance in the outcome of our patients is limited. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
