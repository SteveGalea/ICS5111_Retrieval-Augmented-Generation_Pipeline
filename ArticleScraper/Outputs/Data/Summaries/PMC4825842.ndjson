{"summary": "main themes and sub-themes under investigation in the Sleator lab. bacterial stress responses The Gram-positive foodborne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes proved to be ideal model organism in the early years. gene predicted to encode an HtrA-like serine protease. mutations revealed role for htrA in acid tolerance and virulence potential in L. monocytogenes. htrA is also under control of the two-component regulatory system LisRK. the first genetic analysis of osmotolerance in Listeria described the identification and characterization of BetL, a membrane protein which protects Listeria at elevated osmolarities. this study also identified a putative B-dependent promoter binding site upstream of betL, suggesting that betaine uptake in Listeria might be regulated, at least in part, at the level of transcription. the first direct link between osmotolerance and virulence in Listeria. we ascribed to the accumulation of carnitine, a protective compound similar to betaine but present at much higher concentrations in animal tissues. we also identified the first osmolyte synthesis system in L. monocytogenes, proBA 14. proline synthesis in Listeria is regulated by feedback inhibition of -glutamyl kinase, the first enzyme of the proB gene. mutagenesis of the proBA operon generated 3 independent mutations in proB, leading to proline overproduction. however, as observed for proline auxotrophy, proline hyperproduction has no apparent impact on listerial osmotolerance. the most common route of infection is via powdered infant formula. the most common route of infection is via powdered infant formula. the most common route of infection is via powdered infant formula. spicing the extended C-terminal domain of ProP1 onto the truncated C-terminal end of ProP2. chimeric protein (ProPc) exhibits increased osmotolerance relative to the wild type. carnitine uptake via ProP1 allows growth at salt concentrations far in excess of that afforded by proline. the human distal colon is one of the most complex and densely populated microbial ecosystems on earth. a functional screen of over 20,000 clones from a human gut microbiota library revealed 53 osmotolerant clones. the stlA gene is rare when searched against the human metagenome datasets. it represents a novel and unique salt tolerance determinant. the protein most likely functions as a bile efflux pump. hydrolysis assays indicated that BSH is likely the only listerial bile salt hydrolase (leading to bile detoxification inside the cell) the fact that both bilE and bsh are controlled by both PrfA and B, along with betL, gbu and opuC. sigB is transcriptionally upregulated at elevated osmolarity. it is likely that the increased osmolarity of the gastrointestinal lumen may be interpreted by L. monocytogenes as an environmental cue, signaling gut entry. failure to disrupt EzrA revealed that the protein is essential for the growth of L. monocytoenes. over-expression of lmo1594 confirmed a role for the protein in listerial barotolerance. listerial survival increased from 0.008 to 0.02% with added carnitine. patho-biotechnology In 2006, Colin Hill and I coined the term \u2018patho-biotechnology\u2019 to describe the exploitation of pathogen derived stress survival strategies to engineer improved probiotic strains. this approach showed promise not only for the design of more technologically robust probiotic cultures, but also in the development of novel vaccine and drug delivery platforms. non-invasive luciferase-based reporter system (pLuxMC1) allows us to track colonisation potential and persistence of the probiotic in real time in live animal models. a significant outcome of the study was the identification of the cecum as a niche environment for B. breve; a finding which may explain why appendectomies may lead to an increased risk of functional gastrointestinal disorders. htrA in acid tolerance and virulence potential in L. monocytogenes is also under the control of the two-component regulatory system LisRK. mutational analysis revealed that in addition to regulating HtrA, LisRK likely controls transcription of one or more additional systems necessary for optimal listerial osmotolerance. this study identified a putative B-dependent promoter binding site upstream of betL, suggesting that betaine uptake in Listeria might be regulated, at least in part, at the level of transcription. we later proved the hypothesis, revealing that the BetL protein is itself activated (post-translationally) in response to changes in osmolarity. BetL, OpuC and Gbu created a bank of single, double and triple mutants. this bank allowed me to elucidate, for the first time, the exact role of each transporter against its native background. the findings have had a significant impact on the development of effective control strategies for L. monocytogenes. agenesis of the proBA operon generated 3 independent mutations in proB. however, proline hyperproduction has no apparent impact on listerial osmotolerance. the mutation appears to counter a previously unreported \u201ctwisted\u201d cell morphology observed for L. monocytogenes grown at elevated osmolarity. a key distinguishing feature is that C. sakazakii possesses multiple copies of certain osmotolerance genes. a key distinguishing feature is that C. sakazakii possesses multiple copies of certain osmotolerance genes. chimeric protein (ProPc) exhibits increased osmotolerance relative to the wild type. carnitine uptake via ProP1 allows growth at salt concentrations far in excess of that afforded by proline. carnitine uptake via ProP1 allows growth at salt concentrations far in excess of that afforded by proline. 20,000 clones from a human gut microbiota library revealed 53 osmotolerant clones. a combined transposon mutagenesis and bioinformatic strategy revealed three genes (encoding GalE, MurB and MazG) from a single clone. each of the three genes identified was found to be over-represented in the human gut metagenome. the stlA gene is rare when searched against the human metagenome datasets, MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project. it represents a novel and unique salt tolerance determinant which is apparently exclusive to the human gut environment. the protein most likely functions as a bile efflux pump. both bilE and bsh are controlled by B, along with betL, gbu and opuC. real-time gene expression profiling in the presence of bile revealed roles for both betL and opuC in resisting the acute toxicity of bile. osmotically induced stimulation of the B regulon in the upper small intestine may not only facilitate successful gastrointestinal transit, but also prime the pathogen for the next phase of infection. HPP can inactivate microorganisms and enzymes, with little or no impact on the nutritional and sensory quality of foods. gene deletion proved impossible; over-expression of lmo1594 confirmed a role for the protein in listerial barotolerance, resulting in significantly improved survival rates at 300 MPa. both osmolytes uptake and synthesis systems have been shown to play a role in listerial barotolerance. LisRK may act at the initial stages of the listerial osmotic stress-response. LisR may thus represent a new dimension in the osmosensing capabilities of L. monocytogenes, functioning independently of, but in tandem with, osmolyte uptake synthesis. silico analysis strongly suggests a role for translational control, not only of betL but of listerial osmoregulation in general. deleting betL did not significantly impair growth of the pathogen at elevated osmolarity; suggesting the existence of multiple osmolyte uptake systems. proline biosynthesis in Listeria is regulated by feedback inhibition of -glutamyl kinase, the first enzyme of the proB pathway, encoded by the proB gene. however, proline hyperproduction has no apparent impact on listerial osmotolerance or indeed virulence potential. in 2001, all of the principal osmolyte uptake and synthesis mechanisms had been identified and characterized. this culminated with the publication of the L. monocytogenes genome sequence which we used to perform a complete in silico analysis of osmotolerance in Listeria. silico analysis strongly suggests a role for translational control, not only of betL but of listerial osmoregulation in general. deleting betL did not significantly impair growth of the pathogen at elevated osmolarity; suggesting the existence of multiple osmolyte uptake systems. proline biosynthesis in Listeria is regulated by feedback inhibition of -glutamyl kinase, the first enzyme of the proB pathway, encoded by the proB gene. proline hyperproduction has no apparent impact on listerial osmotolerance or indeed virulence potential. e uptake and synthesis mechanisms were identified and characterized. this culminated with the publication of the L. monocyogenes genome sequence. we used a complete in silico analysis of osmotolerance in Listeria. deleting betL did not significantly impair growth of the pathogen at elevated osmolarity; suggesting the existence of multiple osmolyte uptake systems. we described the identification and characterization of OpuC, a carnitine uptake system which contributes to osmotolerance, chill stress and virulence potential. proline biosynthesis in Listeria is regulated by feedback inhibition of -glutamyl kinase, the first enzyme of the proline biosynthesis pathway, encoded by the proB gene. however, proline hyperproduction has no apparent impact on listerial osmotolerance or indeed virulence potential. by 2001, all of the principal osmolyte uptake and synthesis mechanisms had been identified and characterized. Cronobacter sakazakii is an extremely osmotolerant gastrointestinal pathogen. the most common route of infection is via powdered infant formula. the most common route of infection is via powdered infant formula. 6 of the 7 homologs conferred an osmotolerance phenotype, albeit to varying degrees. all but one (ProP1) are 60\u201370 amino acids shorter than the E. coli ProP. this immediately suggested a role for the chimeric protein (ProPc) metagenomics focuses on individual gastrointestinal pathogens. a functional screen of over 20,000 clones from a human gut microbiota library revealed 53 osmotolerant clones. each of the 53 clones identified was found to be over-represented in the human gut metagenome. the stlA gene is rare when searched against the human metagenome datasets. it represents a novel salt tolerance determinant which is apparently exclusive to the human gut environment. the most common route of infection is via powdered infant formula. sakazakii contains homologs of all the principal E. coli osmotolerance loci. key distinguishing feature is that C. sakazakii possesses multiple copies of certain osmotolerance genes. this level of degeneracy is apparently unique to C. sakazakii. functional screening of a C. sakazakii genomic bank revealed a novel role for ProP1 (ESA_02131) as a carnitine uptake system. carnitine uptake via ProP1 allows growth at salt concentrations far in excess of that afforded by proline. carnitine also promoted growth of L. monocytoenes in infant formula stored at refrigeration temperatures. silico analysis of two other clones revealed the presence of an additional galE and mazG gene, from Akkermansia muciniphila and Eggerthella sp. each of the genes identified was found to be over-represented in the human gut metagenome.

a finding which may explain why appendectomies may lead to an increased risk of functional gastrointestinal disorders. strains expressing BetL were recovered at significantly higher levels in the faeces, intestines and cecum of inoculated animals. similar results were obtained for both B. breve and Lactococcus lactis when betL was replaced with bilE as the transgene of interest. a retrospective analysis of faecal samples submitted to CUH in 2009 was performed to identify all Campylobacter species detected using Serosep's EntericBio\u00ae multiplex PCR system. from a total of 7,194 diarrheal specimens, 349 Campylobacter-positive samples (23.8%) were shown to be Campylobacter ureolyticus. this represents the first report of C. ureolyticus in the faeces of patients presenting a feline derived C. ureolyticus isolate was genetically similar to a strain (CIT 007) isolated from an elderly female patient presenting with gastroenteritis. whole genome sequence analysis of two further C. ureolyticus isolates, including the type strain, reveals 106 putative virulence associated factors. the EntericBio panel II\u00ae system detects Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), differentiating Shiga-like toxins 1 and 2 (SLT-1 and SLT-2)82. the EntericBio real-time Gastro Panel I allows real-time detection of C. jejuni, coli, and lari, STEC, Shigella spp, and Salmonella spp. directly from faeces. the development of faster and cheaper next generation sequencing strategies has resulted in a paradigm shift in molecular diagnostics. since 2008, genomic data has outpaced Moore's Law by a factor of 4. since 2008, genomic data has outpaced Moore's Law by a factor of 4, with a global annual sequencing capacity estimated to be 13 quadrillion bases. a retrospective analysis of faecal samples submitted to CUH in 2009 was performed to identify all Campylobacter species detected using Serosep's EntericBio\u00ae multiplex PCR system. from a total of 7,194 diarrheal specimens, 349 Campylobacter-positive samples (23.8%) were shown to be Campylobacter ureolyticus. this represents the first report of C. ureolyticus in the faeces of patients presenting random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis identified a feline derived C. ureolyticus isolate as genetically similar to a strain (CIT 007) isolated from an elderly female patient presenting with gastroenteritis. whole genome sequence analysis of two further C. ureolyticus isolates, including the type strain, reveals 106 putative virulence associated factors. the EntericBio panel II\u00ae system detects Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), differentiating Shiga-like toxins 1 and 2 (SLT-1 and SLT-2)82. the EntericBio real-time Gastro Panel I allows real-time detection of C. jejuni, coli, and lari, STEC, Shigella spp, and Salmonella spp. directly from faeces, without pre- the development of faster and cheaper next generation sequencing strategies has resulted in a paradigm shift in molecular diagnostics. since 2008, genomic data has outpaced Moore's Law by a factor of 4. since 2008, genomic data has outpaced Moore's Law by a factor of 4.
