{"summary": "RA is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic autoimmune disease that affects about 0.24% of the worldwide population. RA manifests as a progressive destruction of the joints, leukocyte infiltrates, and cartilage destruction and bone erosion. RA is mediated predominantly by CD4+ T cells overexpressing proinflammatory cytokines, particularly in the joints (7). LABs are amenable to recombinant expression of passenger antigens (Ags) to stimulate immunity against a number of pathogens (30\u201332), to curb the effects of inflammatory bowel disease (33, 34), to control the proliferation of cancer cells (35), and to use for enzyme replacement therapy. the delivery of oral therapeutics represents a significant advantage of adapting LABs. IL-35 belongs to the IL-12 cytokine family (rev. in (44). this heterodimeric cytokine is composed of IL-12p35 and IL-27EBI3. this property is mediated via IL-35 binding both IL-12R2 chain and gp130. IL-35 is highly effective in treating CIA via the stimulation of CCR6+ and CCR6 Tregs producing IL-10 and suppressing the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and IFN-. LL-IL35 was grown on M17 plus 0.5% glucose (M17G) animal experiments described in the present study were conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health. all animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by Montana State University's and the University of Florida's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. purified CD4+ T cells were restimulated with 5 g/ml of soluble anti-CD28 mAb (eBioscience) for 48\u201372 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 similar to that previously described (48, 60, 61). cells were harvested, washed, stained and analyzed as previously described. l collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum,Type IV; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cell suspensions passed through a 70 m strainer similar to that previously described (40, 62) group of B6 males were induced with CIA using 100 g of chicken collagen II (CII; Chondrex, Redmond, WA USA) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and administered s.c. as previously described. mice were first orally gavaged with sterile 50% saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. maximum score per mouse is 12. Cytokine elisa CD4+ T cells were cell-sorted by negative selection on magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY USA) purified CD4+ T cells (3 106/ml) were restimulated with 5 g/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA USA) plus 5 g/ml of soluble anti-CD28 mAb (eBioscience) for 48 the difference in arthritis incidence between experimental groups was checked with Fisher's exact probability test. results and discussion RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disorder affecting millions of patients in the us. two treatment paradigms were tested: starting intervention on day 14 resembling salmonella-CFA/I treatment (60) or beginning intervention at disease onset on day 18 followed by a second dose on day 25. clinical scores were performed in double blind, and followed until day 39 post-induction. 50% of the LL-IL35-treated mice showed no symptoms and 50% developed minor symptoms as opposed to PBS- or LL vector-treated mice. the severity of disease symptoms was significantly less (p 0.001) in the LL-IL35-treated mice exhibiting an average clinical score of 1. LL-IL35 confers protection against CIA via reduction of neutrophil influx into joints. reduced clinical scores and disease incidence described in Figure 1B are attributed to reduced neutrophil infiltration into the joints of LL-IL35-treated mice. treatment with LL-IL35 significantly reduced IL-17 by 2.3-fold compared to LL vector-treated mice (p 0.01). the difference between the LL vector- and LL-IL35-treated groups was significant (p 0.05) however, IL-10 induced by the LL vector-treated group was insufficient to suppress disease progression and IL-17 production. CD39+ CD4+ T cells are the primary Tregs responsible for resolving CIA. CD39 is an ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1. this hydrolyzes ATP into AMP, thus quenching inflammatory signaling by extracellular ATP. CD39+ CD4+ T cells were evaluated for expression of Foxp3 and CCR6. a modest increase (p 0.05) in the frequency, but not the total number of CCR6+ Foxp3+ CD39+ CD4+ T cells, was observed. a modest difference was also observed in the frequency and total number of splenic CCR6+ Foxp3+ CD39+ CD4+ T cells. imulated with 50 g/ml CII overnight, and then subjected to a short-term of PMA + ionomycin. the frequency of splenic CCR6 Foxp3+ and CCR6 Foxp3+ T cells was modestly reduced for the LL-IL35-treated mice. the total number of CD39+ CD4+ T cells showed no difference between PBS-dosed and LL-IL35-treated CIA mice. a slight reduction in the frequency of LN CCR6 Foxp3+ CD39+ CD4+ T cells was observed for LL-IL35-treated mice. the total number of CCR6 Tregs was significantly (p 0.001) elevated by 5-fold. two-thirds of total IL-10-producing cells induced by LL-IL35 treatment of CIA mice were derived from the CCR6+ subset. the CCR6+ CD39+ CD4+ T cells induced with LL-IL35 resulted in significant 3.2- and 1.8-fold increase in IL-10-producing cells than those present in p 0.01 and LL vector-treated CIA mice. LL-derived IL-35 eliminates labor-intensive efforts needed to produce and purify the recombinant protein, dramatically reducing the cost of manufacturing this therapeutic. recombinant L. lactis is a lab-adapted recombinant strain capable of fermenting milk into a product that has the same textural and olfactory properties of yogurt (40). conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
