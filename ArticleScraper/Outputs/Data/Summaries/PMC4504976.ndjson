HASM cells treated with increasing amounts of either IL-6, sIL6R, or IL-6+sIL6R for 24 h, and cell proliferation assessed by BrdU. IL-6 alone did not have any effect on HASM proliferation. both IL-6 and IL-6+sIL6R stimulation of HASM cells did not induce activation of PI-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase at both time points tested. phosphorylation of Stat3 under IL-6+sIL6R, but not IL-6-only, treatment was sustained for an extended period of time (24 h) l of IL-6; 20, 40, and 80 ng/ml each of IL-6+sIL6R; or 20, 40, and 80 ng/ml each of sIL6R for 24 h.

IL-6 trans-signaling results in a more robust upregulation of gene expression in HASM compared with classical IL-6 signaling. several genes upregulated in HASM by IL-6 trans-signaling standout. most notable is VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor), a potent proangiogenic factor known to be upregulated by Th2 proinflammatory cytokines. in asthma, Vegf is one of the key factors that induce ASM cell proliferation and airway remodeling, resulting in thickening of the airways wall. IL-6 trans-signaling appears to induce a pseudo-hypoxic gene expression pattern in HASM. sPLA2 (IIA) is secreted by lung mast cells and macrophages. sPLA2 (IIA) can hydrolyze the sn-2 fatty acid from glycerophospholipids. blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling by anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab resulted in a 61% decline in the concentration of sPLA2 (IIA) in serum of treated subjects (43). if sPLA2 (IIA) protein and activity levels are strongly correlated with PLA2G2A mRNA expression levels, we could then hypothesize that increased and sustained IL-6 trans-signaling in the lung could the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) has been hypothesized that ZIP8 expression is increased by cigarette smoke-induced inflammation. elevated ZIP8 mRNA and protein levels have been observed in the lungs of chronic smokers and physiological measures of Cd are linked to lung cancer and reduced lung function (8). subjects with severe asthma were nearly twice as homozygous for the 358Ala IL-6 receptor isoform (28%) as subjects with mild asthma (15%). elevated levels of IL-6 have been observed in sputum and BAL of subjects with severe asthma (47, 51) drafted manuscript; M.B.R., D.A.D., J.C., C.L., A.T.H., E.R.B., and G.A.H. edited and revised manuscript."}
