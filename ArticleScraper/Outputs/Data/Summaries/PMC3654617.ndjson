{"summary": "the strategy of \u201cquarantine\u201d was introduced seven hundred years ago. it was originating from the italian quaranta giorni, meaning \u201cforty days\u201d. the practice of quarantine was never easy, even before the emergence of antibiotic resistance. transmission-based precautions (SP) apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which health care is delivered. they include the performance of hand hygiene according to pre-specified guidelines, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices, safe handling of contaminated equipment, textiles and laundry. CP are aimed at preventing transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens from a colonized or infected patient through direct (the patient) or indirect (surfaces or objects in the patient\u2019s environment) contact is mostly indicated for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO) that have a high risk of exogenous cross-transmission, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant entero the epidemiology of MDRO and the effectiveness of control measures are different in these two situations. most studies implemented multiple interventions either simultaneously or sequentially, making it impossible to determine which were linked to the outcome. most of the information available comes from quasi-experimental studies that may have failed to take into account stochastic or secular changes. despite historical experiences and sound plausibility, the routine use of CP to prevent MDRO transmission remains controversial. current practices are variable: some institutions carry out selective surveillance and isolation of patients. but there remains skepticism on whether these measures are cost-effective or even detrimental to the quality of patient care in non-ICU wards. patients isolated for infection control precautions experience more preventable adverse events, express greater dissatisfaction with their treatment, and have less documented care. the higher level of depression and anxiety among patients placed under CP or isolation. outbreak of MRSA occurring between 1990 and 1993. measures included patient screening, on-site surveillance, contact isolation, decolonization, a computerized alert system and hospital-wide promotion of hand hygiene. active infection control intervention reduced transmission of VRE in health care facilities of the Siouxland region of Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota between 1996 and 1999. hand hygiene compliance of 65 nurses, attending physicians, medical residents and medical students was monitored, with an overall compliance of only 19%. the effect of contact precautions on the successful control of selected MDRO outbreaks. CP measures controlled the outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae before these bacteria became endemic. in one study, 41 reinforced control measures allowed to end an outbreak of 32 cases of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae colonization or infection. but environmental screening had not been performed. the aim of infection control measures should be the complete eradication of CRE, according to an adaptation of the classic \u201csearch and destroy strategy\u201d whereby patients considered to be at risk of CRE carriage are isolated upon hospital admission pending the outcome of admission screening. central public health authority invested with the statutory power to oversee and enforce their implementation. the role of CP to control endemic MDRO transmission is often the result of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, leading to excessive antimicrobial consumption and selection pressure. CPs have been shown to delay colonization by 5 d and reduce the rate of healthcare associated infections by 2.2 times. more recently, Morgan et al. and Snyder et al. have demonstrated the added value of personal protective equipment to decrease the likelihood of MDRO contamination of HCWs. 69 did not report a difference (Table 3). this lack of difference may have been explained by a number of factors including low screening compliance, delays in notification of results, poor compliance with general infection control measures such as hand hygiene and understaffing. studies with highest quality scores ( 90%) testing the effectiveness of barrier precautions and surveillance culture in preventing transmission of multidrug resistant organisms. Surveillance culture, patients in single rooms, patient cohort, HCW education VRE acquisition rate was lower (1.8 cases/100 d) with gowns and glove use compared with glove use alone (3.78 cases/100 d) two important studies performed in the united states have highlighted the difficulties in gaining sustained and reproducible results. the study included data from 196 ICUs in the us. a group of experts suggested a multifaceted approach with different components. control measures should include (1) physical separation of carriers from non-carriers, (2) dedicated staff, (3) active surveillance of high-risk patients, (4) training and measures to keep staff and hospital administration informed. the role of CP to control sporadic or epidemic MDRO transmission MRSA and VRE. an active infection control intervention reduced the transmission of VRE in health care facilities of the siouxland region of Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota between 1996 and 1999. CP is an essential component of the \u201csearch-and-destroy\u201d strategy to prevent further spread of MRSA in a healthcare setting. hand hygiene compliance of 65 nurses, attending physicians, medical residents and medical students was monitored, with an overall compliance of only 19%. the effect of contact precautions on the successful control of selected MDRO outbreaks. CP measures controlled the outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae before these bacteria became endemic. in one study, 41 reinforced control measures allowed to end an outbreak of 32 cases of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae colonization or infection. however, environmental screening had not been performed. the aim of infection control measures should be the complete eradication of CRE, according to an adaptation of the classic \u201csearch and destroy strategy\u201d. CP have successfully advocated and implemented in settings with low prevalence and localized outbreaks. CP have been successfully advocated and implemented in settings with low prevalence and localized outbreaks. the university of Geneva Hospitals in Switzerland evaluated several intensive infection control measures on a hospital outbreak of MRSA occurring between 1990 and 1993. these measures included patient screening, on-site surveillance, contact isolation, decolonization, a computerized alert system and hospital-wide promotion of hand hygiene. CP also reduced the transmission of VRE in health care facilities of the Siouxland region of Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota between 1996 and 1999. cohort had only 4/73 (5%) cases of secondary MRSA transmission. non-isolation cohort had 19/95 (20%) cases of secondary MRSA transmission. hand hygiene compliance of 65 nurses, attending physicians, medical residents and medical students was monitored. personnel screening/surveillance Isolation/cohorting Hand washing/hand disinfection Disinfection/Sterilization 88 Belgium Multidrug-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes 34 9 mo Isolation/cohorting Protective clothing Hand washing/hand disinfection Disinfection/Sterilization Patient screening/surveillance Personnel screening/surveillance 89 MDR GNB The prime value of CP to control outbreaks of MDR GNB has also been demonstrated the outbreak was ultimately contained by implementing strict cohorting of colonized patients to minimize sharing of hospital equipment. the aim of infection control measures should be the complete eradication of CRE, according to an adaptation of the classic \u201csearch and destroy strategy\u201d. the role of CP to control endemic MDRO transmission is often the result of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, leading to excessive antimicrobial consumption and selection pressure. the role of CP to control endemic MDRO transmission Endemic MDRO occurrence is often the result of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing.
