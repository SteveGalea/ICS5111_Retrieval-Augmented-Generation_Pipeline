{"summary": "several members of the Ebolavirus genus and Marburgvirus genus, Family Filoviridae, cause severe and often fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. outbreaks continue to affect the central African region including recent outbreaks in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012. rVSV mechanism of protection for EBOV is mediated by antibodies [12]. adenovirus/EBOV-GP immunization strategies have been characterized by EBOV-specific CD8+ T cells and not humoral immunity. a filovirus vaccine would be directed for use in humans at risk of infection in africa. a bivalent vaccine that confers protection from RABV and EBOV would be an economical and efficient public health tool. the RABV vaccine platform has proven to be an excellent vaccine vector for safe induction of immunity to HIV, SARS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus. beta-propiolactone-mediated inactivation of RABV-vectored vaccines has been used to generate killed vaccine candidates against hepatitis C virus. live attenuated RABV/EBOV vaccines could be considered for use in africa in an analogous campaign to protect at risk NHPs from lethal EBOV infections. RABV-based vaccine vectors expressing HIV-1 antigens indicated such vaccines are highly immunogenic against both the RABV-based vector and foreign antigens. four groups of rhesus macaques were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) in the caudal thigh muscle as follows: group 1, three NHPs, 5107 focus-forming units (FFU) BNSP333-GP, black; group 3, four NHPs, 1107 FFU BNSPG-GP, blue; group 4, four NHPs, 250 g purified INAC-BNSP333-GP, green. the goal of this novel rhesus macaques primed with the inactivated RABV virions containing EBOV GP received a boost at day 28 with the same vaccine. the boost increased the humoral responses against RABV G and EBOV GP significantly. we were unable to detect significant levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies against EBOV for groups 2\u20134 compared to the controls of group 1. we also analyzed the cellular responses utilizing an IFN-specific ELISPOT from larger blood samples collected at day 14 and 42. animals of the control group did not mount any cellular responses when stimulated with EBOV GP-specific peptide pools. BNSP333-GP 12 M 54.3 4.5 248.3 5903.3 13 M 50.0 0.0 136.7 856.7 14 F 2.9 0.5 140.0 55.0 15 F 51.4 2.5 191.7 60.0 Outcome of challenge with EBOV in vaccinated animals After day 42, all animals were transferred to the NIAID BSL-4 facility at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories for EBOV challenge. all animals in the control group (NHP 1\u20133) had to be humanely five out of the twelve animals (NHP4, NHP5, NHP6, NHP11 and NHP12) controlled challenge virus replication with undetectable viremia. for three animals (NHP7, NHP10 and NHP13) the challenge virus was detected transiently at one (group 2 and 3) or two time points (group 4). animal body temperature, on average, increased within the first few days after challenge but returned to the original temperatures near day 12 post challenge. the three animals of the control group failed to mount any EBOV GP-specific responses during the course of the EBOV infection. however, all three groups of vaccinated NHPs had similar levels of anti-EBOV GP antibodies at the day of challenge. a rapid increase to high levels of EBOV GP-specific antibodies was observed on day 6 after challenge in the serum of five animals that survived. the humoral immune responses were compared to the response of a control macaque which survived EBOV infection by post challenge day 9. compared to the response of a control macaque which survived EBOV infection by post challenge day 9. EBOV GP-MLD (B) analyzed qualitative differences of the antibodies. we performed an isotype-specific ELISA utilizing full-length EBOV GP to determine if any differences occurred between the vaccines. the positive control NHP ratio of IgG2/IgG1 on day 0 post-challenge was around 1.0. group 1 animals did not show an IgG1 or IgG2 response to EBOV GP. group 1 animals did not show an IgG1 or IgG2 response to EBOV GP. the ratios of protected animals were not statistically significant. the avidity of EBOV GP-specific antibodies increased until challenge day 0. RABV-vector induced immune responses mature over a long period of time. however, we did not find a direct correlation between avidity of the EBOV GP-specific antibody induced by the vaccines and protection from disease. RABV-based vaccine vectors expressing HIV-1 antigens are highly immunogenic in NHPs. however, only replication-competent vaccine vectors expressing HIV-1 GagPol or Env have been analyzed in NHPs. the empty, replication-competent vector (BNSP333-GP) served as a control. group 1, three NHPs, 5107 focus-forming units (FFU) BNSP333-GP, black; group 3, four NHPs, 1107 FFU BNSPG-GP, blue; group 4, four NHPs, 250 g purified INAC-BNSP333-GP, green. the goal of this novel vaccine approach was to develop a vaccine that protects from two different highly lethal diseases, rabies and filovirus induced hemorrhagic fever. only the group of rhesus macaques primed with the inactivated RABV virions received a boost at day 28 with the same vaccine. the boost increased the humoral responses against EBOV GP and RABV G for group 4 significantly from days 28 to 35. we were unable to detect significant levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against EBOV for groups 2\u20134 compared to the controls of group 1. we also analyzed the cellular responses utilizing an IFN-specific ELISPOT from larger blood samples collected at day 14 and 42. animals of the control group did not mount any cellular responses when stimulated with EBOV GP-specific peptide pools. all animals were transferred to the NIAID BSL-4 facility at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories for EBOV challenge. we infected two of the three control animals (NHP1 and NHP2) on day 56 with 1000 PFU of EBOV prior to the other animals to ensure the pathogenicity of the virus stock. the remaining 13 animals on day 70 had the same virus stock and dose. five out of the twelve animals (NHP4, NHP5, NHP6, NHP11 and NHP12) controlled challenge virus replication with undetectable viremia. the challenge virus was detected transiently at one (group 2 and 3) or two time points (group 4). animal body temperature, on average, increased within the first few days after challenge but returned to the original temperatures near day 12 post challenge. all three groups of vaccinated NHPs had similar levels of anti-EBOV GP antibodies at the day of challenge. the EBOV GP-specific antibodies remained at these levels 3 days after challenge. a rapid increase to high levels of EBOV GP-specific IgG was observed in the serum of the five animals that survived. Rhesus macaque total IgG immune response to EBOV GP for post challenge day 0 (A), day 3 (B), day 6 (C), day 16 (D) and day 28 (E) were compared to the response of a control macaque. we performed an isotype-specific ELISA utilizing full-length EBOV GP to determine if any differences occurred between the vaccines. the positive control NHP ratio of IgG2/IgG1 on day 0 post-challenge was around 1.0, while this ratio was an average of about 2.0 for all the vaccinated animals from groups 2\u20134. group 1 animals did not show an IgG1 or IgG2 response to EBOV GP so the ratios are not shown. the isotype ratios of the protected animals were not statistically significant when compared to the ratios of the unprotected animals. sera were analyzed from day 42 (A), day 0 (challenge) (B), day 3 post challenge (C) and day 28 post challenge (D) with a NaSCN-displacement ELISA. the avidity of the EBOV GP-specific antibodies is not complete until after day 42, since the levels continue to increase at least until after day 70. two live vaccine candidates, BNSP333-GP and BNSPG-GP with a deletion of the entire RABV G gene, were found to be avirulent upon peripheral administration in mice. each bivalent vaccine candidate induced strong humoral immunity to RABV G and EBOV GP, and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and mouse-adapted EBOV challenge. anti-EBOV GP antibodies and EBOV GP-specific CD4+ T-helper cells appear to depend on the presence of anti-EBOV GP antibodies. however, there was no significant difference in the ELISA signal for each serum sample to the two versions of EBOV GP. this suggests a qualitative difference in the humoral responses. antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity may play a major role in protection from EBOV infection. antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) might play a major role in protecting from EBOV infection. a vector could be used to protect NHPs from EBOV in the endemic setting. the replication-deficient and the inactivated RABV particles did not protect all animals. therefore, the responses induced by these vaccines need to be improved to resemble the responses detected for the replication-competent vaccine, BNSP333-GP. an additional immunization dose would bring the protection rate to 100% of the animals, a reachable goal for a safe and promising dual vaccine. all animal work was approved by the NIAID Division of Intramural Research Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) both facilities are accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. group 2 animals were immunized i.m. with a 5107 FFU dose of the full length parent RABV vaccine expressing EBOV GP. group 4 animals were immunized i.m. with 250 g of beta-propiolactone inactivated BNSP333-GP. platelet, reticulocyte and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit values, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were determined from EDTA blood. serum biochemistry was analyzed using the Piccolo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer and Piccolo General Chemistry 13 Panel discs. blood samples were thawed and serial dilutions were prepared. antigens were prepared in sterile culture media to achieve final concentrations. PBMCs were added to respective wells at 1105 cells/well. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. ptomycin (Mediatech) on 96 well plates was incubated for 24 h at 34C. plates were then fixed with 80% acetone and stained with anti-RV N (Fujirebio) IUs of antibody were calculated based on the WHO standard, where 50% infection accounts for 2 IUs. supernatant was added to an equilibrated anti-HA agarose (Pierce) column. column washed with 10 bed volumes of TBST and 2 bed volumes of TBS. added 5 mL of 200 g/mL HA peptide in TBS. 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 50 ng/well purified EBOV GP or 100 ng/well purified RABV G in Na2CO3 coating buffer. plates were washed three times with PBST (PBS with 0.025% Tween 20) and blocked for 1\u20132 hours with 5% dry non-fat milk in PBST. the sera samples were treated with increasing concentrations of NaSCN in PBS. the plates were immediately washed three times with PBST (0.025% Tween in PBS) before continuing with the ELISA protocol. group 1 animals were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with a 5107 FFU dose of live parent RABV vaccine, BNSP333. group 4 animals were immunized i.m. with 250 g of beta-propiolactone inactivated BNSP333-GP (designated INAC-BNSP333-GP) challenge virus stock had never been used in rhesus macaques. we infected two of the three control animals on day 56 with 1000 PFU of EBOV. physical exams and blood draws were performed on day 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 22, and 28 post-challenge. DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine was added. cells were monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was calculated for each sample. RABV VNA A modified rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was performed to determine RABV neutralizing antibody levels in the immunized NHP sera. three-fold serial dilutions of sera or WHO standard RABV IgG in Cellgro Complete serum free media (Mediatech) were incubated at 37C for 1 h with BNSP at a concentration to achieve an moi of 1 at 24 h post-infection in the negative control. cells, the serum-virus mixture was added and samples were incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. the mixture was removed from the cells and 100 l of 1.2% carboxymethyl cellulose in MEM (2% FBS) was added per well. the neutralizing antibody titer of a serum sample was considered positive. EBOV GP positive fractions were dialyzed with 10K MWCO dialysis cassettes. total IgG and isotype ELISAs specific for EBOV GP and RABV G Rhesus macaque sera obtained from NIH. IgG subclass specific ELISAs were performed for EBOV GP and RABV G with anti-human (Abcam) and anti-rhesus (NIH NHP Reagent Source) antibodies. plates were incubated with OPD substrate for 8\u201313 minutes before stopping the reaction with 3 M H2SO4. sera were analyzed on day 28 (A), day 35 (B), day 42 (C), post challenge day 0 (D), day 16 (E) and day 28 (F) with a NaSCN-displacement ELISA."}
