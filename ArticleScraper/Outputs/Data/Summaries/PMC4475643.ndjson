{"summary": "the world health organization ranks lower respiratory infections as the third leading annual cause of death globally. ARDs are also the leading cause of outpatient illness, with significant impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years. in the united states, lower respiratory tract infections account for 85,000 deaths each year. investigators documented trainee-related ARD outbreaks in winter at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in Illinois (17), a principal finding of naval recruit studies in the 1950s and 1960s. the incidence of hospitalizations for respiratory disease among recruits exceeds that among comparable civilian adults in the united states by at least 3- to 4-fold. nonbattle injuries and illnesses have exceeded the numbers of battle wounds (27, 28) During military deployments in the Persian Gulf War and Balkan peacetime engagements in the 1990s, such infections accounted for 14% of all medical encounters, being exceeded only by noncombat orthopedic injuries (29). conflicting data have been reported regarding roles of age and gender. a greater risk of respiratory illness was seen for older personnel (2% higher for each year of age) and females (44% higher) deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan (32). the incidence of hospitalizations for respiratory disease among recruits exceeds that among comparable civilian adults in the united states by at least 3- to 4-fold. the incidence of hospitalizations for respiratory disease among recruits exceeds that among comparable civilian adults in the u.s. nonbattle injuries and illnesses have exceeded the numbers of battle wounds (27, 28) During military deployments in the Persian Gulf War and Balkan peacetime engagements in the 1990s, such infections accounted for 14% of all medical encounters, being exceeded only by noncombat orthopedic injuries (29). conflicting data have been reported regarding roles of age and gender. a greater risk of respiratory illness was seen for older personnel (2% higher for each year of age) and females (44% higher) deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan (32). oviruses 4\u20138 days Acute onset with nonexudative pharyngitis and fever; conjunctivitis may be prominent; may be associated with secondary viral (but not bacterial) pneumonia with certain strains. not a significant problem in vaccinated individuals Influenza (parainfluenza) viruses 1\u20134 days (2\u20136 days) Streptococcus pneumoniae 1\u20133 days Pneumonia highlighted by acute onset of high fever, rigors, productive cough with rusty sputum, and shortness of breath. tendency to occur in clusters at any time of the year rather than sporadically Mycoplasma pneumoniae 6\u201332 days Gradual onset of dry, nonproductive cough, malaise, and chills with low-grade fever. uncommon in recruits due to effective immunization upon arrival Mycobacterium tuberculosis Weeks to months >90% of cases are pulmonary with persistent cough (>3 wk), with subsequent spiking fever, sputum production, shortness of breath, and weight loss. secondary cases may occur in up to 2%\u20133% of those exposed as long as 6\u201312 mo postexposure. Pneumonia is most often caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, adenovirus, or influenza virus (50) in temperate climates, influenza virus, adenovirus, and HCoV predominate in the winter, while rhinovirus may be seen year-round. pathogen transmission and shedding Respiratory pathogens are spread by large droplet nuclei (5 to 10 m in diameter), often referred to as \u201cperson-to-person\u201d transmission; small droplet nuclei (5 m in diameter), often referred to as \u201cairborne\u201d transmission; and (iii) self-inoculation onto the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva from contaminated surfaces (e.g., fomites) clinical symptoms resulting from infection by different pathogens may overlap, so a specific etiologic diagnosis based on clinical grounds only is often inaccurate. clinical features of and epidemiological clues for respiratory pathogens in military settingsa Pathogen(s) Incubation period Clinical presentation and/or epidemiological clue(s) Adenoviruses 4\u20138 days Acute onset with nonexudative pharyngitis and fever; conjunctivitis may be prominent; may be rhinoviruses 2\u20134 days Acute onset of \u201ccommon cold\u201d syndrome (accounts for 50% of common colds) and additional symptoms such as headache and sore throat. high rates of infection among recruits (20%\u201370%), with lower respiratory tract symptoms such as shortness of breath and higher risk of pneumonia HCoVs 2\u201310 days. illness is generally milder than those caused by other pathogens. adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (hMPV) in 10% to 15% of cases, as well as group A streptococcus (49) streptococcal infections may also be accompanied by tonsillar exudate. human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus, HCoV, and RSV infections usually are not. pneumoniae is most often caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, adenovirus, or influenza virus (50) in temperate climates, influenza virus, adenovirus, HCoV, and rhinovirus predominate in the winter. in tropical regions, respiratory infections with all these pathogens tend to be more frequent during wet and cold weather. shedding usually begins at the time of symptom onset, whereas for most other viruses, it begins 24 to 48 h prior to illness. there are >50 adenovirus types that cause a wide variety of clinical syndromes, including febrile ARD, pharyngoconjunctival fever, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pneumonia in healthy persons. in the 1960s, investigators at the WRAIR documented widespread adenoviral infection (80%) among recruits. 4% to 9% to as high as 54% to 79%; hospitalization rates documented to be 33 times higher among recruits than among nonrecruits. lack of preexisting, type-specific immunity has been documented to represent the most significant factor in predisposing recruits to infection and disease. outbreaks took place during periods of nonavailability of Ad4 and Ad7 oral vaccine after its sole manufacturer ceased production in 1994. adenovirus-associated febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) returned to recruit training centers. it was not until late October 2011 when production resumed and recruit vaccination was restarted. U.S. recruits Ad4 and Ad7 predominant strains in FRI-based surveillance at 5 recruit training centers (3,212 throat cultures); cases due to Ad4 (46%), Ad7 (32%), Ad3 (13%), and Ad21 (5%); unvaccinated recruits at much greater risk of culture-positive Ad4/Ad7 infection than vaccinated recruits. first outbreak due to a non-Ad4 serotype in postvaccine era involving 541 Ad infections (70% due to Ad7; 24% due to Ad3) at GLNTC. outbreak halted by resumption of vaccination in late October 1997 77 Oct\u2013Nov 1998 U.S. recruits Intensive 8-wk clinicoepidemiological prospective study of 678 recruits at Fort Jackson. unpublished data Apr\u2013May 2000 U.S. recruits Ad4 (n = 43) identified among 47 (43%) of 109 hospitalized recruits at Fort Benning with viral culture data. lack of ventilation (nonfunctioning air handlers), younger age, sleeping density of >50/bay, unit cohorting (1 company), and white race associated with increased risk. in 2006, Ad7 identified in 122 (76%) of 200 recruits with ARD during 4-wk basic military training; overall, 24,004 ARD cases identified among 60,000 recruits. in 2011\u20132012, Ad found to be responsible for most acute LRTIs (63%) among a group of 87 personnel admitted to the Armed Forces Capital Hospital in Seongnam. no vaccination 95 2000\u20132012 U.S. recruits Clear documentation of impact of Ad vaccination on drastic reduction of Ad-related outcomes. 100-fold decline in Ad-associated disease burden 96, 97, 107 Feb 2012 Chinese military Ad55 identified in several hundred soldiers hospitalized at Boading City PLA 252 military hospital. the most notable military Ad14 outbreak took place in the spring of 2007 at the U.S. air force recruit training center in Lackland, TX. sporadic cases in civilian communities and clusters of cases among military trainees were identified. surveillance data shows that Ad14 activity remains low >3 years after the introduction of the vaccine. adenovirus-associated respiratory disease in the military has most often been associated with types 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21. shedding begins shortly before the onset of symptoms (within 1 to 2 days) and continues for up to a week after symptom resolution (12, 49). adenoviruses were a common cause of viral pneumonia among military recruits. adenoviruses can also be rapidly detected by several relatively new NAATs that are multiplexed to detect several viruses at the same time (113\u2013115). these assays include (i) a multiplex PCR whose resulting products are labeled by a primer extension step and then hybridized to detection microbeads that can be specifically sorted based on their internal dye content (116); (ii) a multiplex PCR whose resulting products are converted to intravenous ganciclovir and cidofovir have been used in the treatment of seriously ill immunocompromised patients. however, both drugs have been associated with significant renal toxicity or neutropenia (49, 123). ribavirin or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin has been used in specific cases. influenza and its secondary pneumonia complications exceeded the number of combat-related deaths (n = 50,280) during this conflict. an estimated 8.7 million days of duty were lost due to influenza, with a substantial impact on operational readiness (131, 132) only 3 of 9 influenza-associated deaths in the 1998-2013 period were attributed to pH1N1 virus during pandemic period (April 2009 to August 2010) only 3 of 9 influenza-associated deaths in the 1998-2013 period were attributed to pH1N1 virus during pandemic period (April 2009 to August 2010) 83; R. N. Potter, unpublished data Apr 2009 U.S. military dependents 4 (ND) a total of 761 ILI patients tested by rRT-PCR, 141 May 2009 Engineer military students 79 (12) First evidence of community transmission of pH1N1 virus in Spain; AR for ILI moderately high (17%) among 636 recruits within a 2-wk period; wide range in ARs depending on class (3\u201319%) 143 May\u2013Jun 2009 U.S. military shipboard personnel 135 (12) aborted an outbreak aboard the USS Roosevelt by hospitalizing 1 case at local VA medical center. strict isolation, active case finding, early osel phylogenetic analyses revealed a composition of the HA gene similar to those of other worldwide-circulating pH1N1 viruses in April\u2013May 2009. serological infection rate found to be more than twice as high as the symptomatic AR (49.1%); early detection with an electronic reporting system, isolation of ill. ise A total of 52 (22%) crew members sustained an ARI, 1 of which was confirmed pH1N1 virus infection. 83 (39%) of 211 crew members found to have significant anti-pH1N1 HAI/CF titers (1:10) postcruise. high rate of asymptomatic infection (53%) and higher risk of illness for females. receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine associated with a 59% decreased risk of infection 154 Aug\u2013Oct 2009 U.S. military recruits Several hundred (ND) Few cases in first wave in June\u2013July 2009 (outbreaks at U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force recruit camps); larger peak in no. of cases in second wave in august\u2013October 2009 affecting all 8 recruit training centers 138 May 2009\u2013Apr 2010 French military ND (0.4/wk) in 2010-2011 season 159 a pH1N1, novel influenza A pdm09 virus; AR, estimated attack rate; ILI, influenza-like illness, defined as fever with cough or sore throat; ND, not determined; ND, not determined; AFB, Air Force Base; SWA, Southwest Asia; CDC, U.S. military health system; OR, odds ratio; rRT-PCR; real-time reverse transcriptase PCR; PPV, positive predictive value; tamivir chemoprophylaxis in a ship crew was shown to limit large-scale spread to military members and the civilian populace in new york city. iii) implementation of early isolation, active case finding, early oseltamivir treatment, and chemoprophylaxis of medical staff were shown to limit large-scale spread to military members. influenza was found to be responsible for as many as 7,000 to 25,000 cases per week in the MHS, of which 3,000 to 16,000 (40% to 65%) involved military personnel (162). drifted H3N2 viruses have begun to predominate, causing an increase in the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in 2014 to 2015. 840 laboratory-confirmed human cases and 447 deaths have been reported to the WHO from 16 countries. despite the high mortality rate (CFR of 53%), human cases of H5N1 infection remain rare to date. there have been no reported H5N1 infections in the u.s. military. on 31 March 2013, the first three human infections with H7N9 virus were reported to the WHO by Chinese authorities. these viruses, which have become enzootic in China (180, 181), have spread efficiently among live-poultry market workers, close household contacts, and health care providers (HCPs) in China and Hong Kong (182, 183). infection with these H7N9 viruses is associated with increased lethality (160) there have been no reported cases of H7N9 infection in the U.S. military. the risk to military personnel appears to be low (196, 197) seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and B subtypes) have a very short incubation period (median, 2 days; range, 1 to 4 days), which may be longer (up to 8 to 9 days) for infections caused by other AIVs (44, 202) shedding begins 24 to 48 h prior to symptom onset, peaks within 48 to 72 h after onset. most adults with symptomatic influenza virus infection have uncomplicated illness, with sudden the time required to detect influenza viruses in cell culture can be shortened to 1 to 2 days by employing SVCC systems followed by fluorescent-antibody staining. RIDT sensitivities have varied widely (10% to 80%) compared to viral culture or reverse transcriptase PCR. RIDT sensitivity is lower in adults and elderly patients than in young children. the gradual dissemination of NAATs, including real-time RT-PCR, in clinical laboratories has shifted the focus of laboratory diagnosis of influenza infection from dependency on virus culture. the gradual dissemination of NAATs, including real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), in clinical laboratories has shifted the focus of laboratory diagnosis of influenza infection from dependency on virus culture. this rapid detection test is intended for use by the u.s. military's network of laboratories or other U.S. government laboratories outside the united states. this rapid detection test is intended for use by the military's network of laboratories, or by other U.S. government laboratories. new PCR-based point-of-care tests that are more sensitive (>90%) than older RIDTs have been developed and cleared by the FDA. as with adenoviruses, serologic assays for influenza A and B viruses exist but are not routinely used for clinical diagnosis. the NIs represent the main drug class for the treatment of influenza infection. oseltamivir was found to be effective in reducing the duration of influenza symptoms by 21% (from 123 h down to 98 h) and the risk of hospitalization by 65% (compared to 1.7% in placebo recipients) among adults in a recently reported meta-analysis. the rate of resistance to the NIs has been limited to 1% of the prevailing seasonal influenza viruses in the united states and worldwide (167, 249) for severely ill patients with influenza who have strongly suspected or documented oseltamivir resistance or malabsorption, gastric stasis, or gastrointestinal bleeding, intravenous zanamivir can be considered. intravenous zanamivir, an investigational drug, is available through enrollment in a clinical trial or by request to the manufacturer for use first-in-class thiazolide anti-infective is licensed in the united states for treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia (252). NTX has been found to be synergistic with NIs and to inhibit influenza viruses that are NI resistant (253\u2013255) treatment with NTX orally (600 mg twice daily for 5 days) has been shown to reduce the duration of influenza-associated symptoms in subjects with acute uncom in a recent meta-analysis of 32 studies of hospitalized patients with influenza, the use of convalescent plasma or serum was seen to be associated with lower mortality rates than those for untreated patients (historical controls) infected with 1918 H1N1, pH1N1, or H5N1 virus. however, RCTs to adequately judge their efficacy are lacking. the u.s. military requires influenza vaccination of all military recruits and of all personnel on active duty status on a yearly basis (2). the goal is to exceed 90% immunization of all military personnel by mid-December of each year. compliance rates among civilian HCPs in the united states have not exceeded 75%. the CDC and other international health officials recommended influenza immunization only for the aged and infirm, while the military was immunizing the entire force. a large proportion of military personnel are immunized with current influenza vaccines, but influenza viruses continue to affect them (135, 162, 273) of infection of infants can be as high as 50%, and >90% of young children are infected by the age of 5 years. immunity against either group A or group B strains is not long lasting. reinfections in children and adults are common, even with the same strain. high ARs may occur under conditions of overcrowding or deficient personal sanitation (47, 48) military-based studies of RSV in military settings are needed to assess this pathogen's transmissibility and military impact. the mean incubation period for RSV is 5 days. aerosolized ribavirin is the only FDA-approved antiviral treatment for RSV (299, 300) it has been found to have high levels of in vitro activity against RSV, reduce viral shedding, and shorten the course of illness. it is recommended only for patients at high risk for serious disease. this drug appears to be safe, with only mild transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and reversible decreases in neutrophil counts. additional treatment approaches, such as inhaled nanobodies, aerosolized peptides, and RNA interference molecules, need to be explored in RCTs. human coronaviruses (HCoVs), first isolated in the 1930s, include a broad range of enveloped RNA viruses. group I includes strains 229E and NL63, and group II includes strains OC43 and HKU1 (310). over 8,000 cases and >750 deaths were reported in 26 countries. HCoVs are considered to be a threat to the military, although sparse information is available in the literature. investigators found 35 (6%) of 615 recruits with FRI were infected with strains OC43 (67%), 229E (21%), and NL63 (12%). HCoV infections are an uncommon cause of ILI among patients seen at U.S. military MTFs (1%). the majority of infected HCPs presented with no or minor symptoms. many of these HCPs were asymptomatic contacts identified through screening of close contacts of confirmed cases. additional cases have been reported among other patients receiving treatment for conditions unrelated to MERS-CoV. infections with non-SARS-CoV non-MERS-CoV strains are associated with mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract symptoms in 30% of cases. mild and moderate upper respiratory symptoms may be variable in duration, lasting anywhere between 3 and 18 days. lower respiratory tract illnesses occur more frequently in older adults, in those with cardiopulmonary disease, or in immunocompromised patients. patients tend to be older (65 years of age) as well as overweight, have diabetes mellitus or end-stage renal disease, and sustain coinfections requiring admission to an intensive care unit (350, 351) the estimated CFR is roughly 37% to 40%. earlier in the epidemic in late 2013, the CFR was estimated to be as high as 51% to 65%. based diagnosis of HCoV strains HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43 (116, 120), only the nested multiplex PCR system has been cleared by the FDA. the microbead-based method is likely to be used to detect other respiratory pathogens. however, immunofluorescence assays are available for the detection of all HCoVs (310) there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of any of the HCoVs. oral and intravenous ribavirin with and without corticosteroids were used. however, ribavirin showed little antiviral activity in vitro. the use of convalescent plasma or highly neutralizing antibody preparations appears to be safe, represents a promising intervention that warrants careful clinical study. the use of convalescent plasma or highly neutralizing antibody preparations appears to be safe, represents a promising intervention that warrants careful clinical study. the NIH and industry partners are supporting the development and testing of drugs to treat MERS-CoV infection (375) human metapneumovirus represents the third most common cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in children. it can also be a relatively frequent cause of pneumonia in adults (381) hMPV-associated outbreaks have taken place in the united states in 2012 among older adults in skilled-nursing facilities in west Virginia and Idaho. the incubation period for hMPV is between 3 and 5 days, although little is known about this pathogen (44, 379, 385) in healthy adults, these viruses cause upper respiratory tract infection commonly presenting as ILI or as a syndrome consistent with the common cold. identification of these three pathogens is performed by amplification in viral culture (40, 58, 378, 386), using IFA-based direct detection (388), PCR detection by NAATs (58, 378, 386), and, albeit rarely, antibody detection. identification of these three pathogens is performed by amplification in viral culture (40, 58, 378, 386) HRVs can be isolated in human diploid embryonic lung cells (e.g., WI-38 and MRC-5) within a period of 10 to 14 days. adenoviruses, and SVCC systems followed by fluorescent-antibody staining can also rapidly detect PIVs and HRVs within 1 to 2 days. there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of hMPV-, PIV-, or rhinovirus-associated respiratory illnesses (58, 378, 400) there have been no RCTs evaluating the efficacy of ribavirin or other antiviral therapies for these three pathogens. ribavirin with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has antiviral activity against hMPV in vitro (401) there are no licensed vaccines for hMPV, PIVs, or HRVs. approach to such vaccine development has included (i) live attenuated vaccines, (ii) subunit vaccine constructs, and (iii) virus-like particle vaccines. in the past 2 decades, major pneumococcal outbreaks have continued to occur among unvaccinated military personnel. a large outbreak in 2009 among U.S. Army recruits at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, with 2 meningitis deaths and an additional 72 pneumonia cases (421) this interaction was best made evident during the 2009 pandemic in the united states. pneumococcal NP carriage rates increase during the influenza season (425). higher pneumococcal NP carriage rates are seen during winter months due to increased crowding, reduced ventilation, and the facilitating effect of other upper respiratory tract viral infections. infections range in severity from mild lower respiratory illness to severe overwhelming sepsis with a high mortality rate (431) it can infrequently be associated with fulminant diarrhea, known as croupous colitis (433). sputum culture recommends sputum Gram's stain and culture sensitivities. pneumococcal urinary antigen test is a rapid bedside diagnostic antigen detection card test. it represents a convenient way to diagnose or rule out S. pneumoniae-associated CAP. sensitivity and specificity have been estimated to be 70% and 96%. pneumoniae is sensitive to parenteral penicillin when the MIC is 2 g/ml. the MIC cutoff for parenteral penicillin is lower for patients with meningitis (MIC, 0.06 g/ml) for oral penicillin, an MIC of 0.06 g/ml is used. bacteremic S. pneumoniae and CAP received macrolides in combination with beta-lactam agents. patients who received macrolides experienced lower mortality rates than patients treated only with beta-lactam agents (458\u2013462) combination therapy for severe bacteremic pneumonia is usually limited to 3 to 5 days or until antimicrobial susceptibility testing results are available. no efficacy was demonstrated in terms of reducing pneumonia during recruit training or for up to 7 years after enrollment. influenza vaccination has been shown to reduce secondary bacterial infections, including pneumococcal infections and pneumonia. smoking has been found to increase pneumococcal NP carriage and illness rates and should be strongly discouraged. since 2011, no streptococcal respiratory disease outbreaks have been documented in the military. since 2011, no streptococcal respiratory disease outbreaks have been documented in the military.

Jordan, unpublished data a Classification is done by date of observation or outbreak when available. influenza vaccination has been correlated with a significantly (50% to 77%) lower risk of streptococcus-related illness (482). asymptomatic NP streptococcus carriers is the key factor that begins and prolongs outbreaks. the acute onset of fever, sore throat, malaise, and headache (42) in adults, it can follow a primary viral infection. it can cause uncomplicated respiratory and skin infections, severe invasive infections, and postinfectious autoimmune illnesses. severe complications are usually associated with mucoid strains harboring a specific emm gene. the CFR in uncomplicated cases is 1%, whereas in cases with suppurative complications, it is estimated to be 15% to 25%. postinfectious autoimmune syndromes following streptococcal pharyngitis can present as acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis. molecular assays are increasingly being used to clinically detect streptococcal infections in affected patients. the increased sensitivity of molecular assays compared to that of culture is in part due to their ability to detect nonviable material that may still be present in the affected area. one method cleared by the FDA is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification test (502) treatment with oral penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is the first-line therapy for group A streptococcal pharyngitis (499) treatment with benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is not recommended at this time, as it is reserved for use as a chemoprophylaxis drug. the choice of treatment should be dependent upon whether other organisms, such as anaerobes, are present. surveillance of streptococcus-related illnesses has served as a valuable resource in understanding the epidemiology of streptococcus-related respiratory disease. the use of BPG is acceptable and recommended as a mass intervention in order to rapidly terminate disease transmission (2, 487) chemoprophylaxis with BPG is presently used routinely at seven of nine recruit training centers. the U.S. navy and air force presently administer BPG to basic trainees upon arrival. in the marine corps, three doses are spread across the training cycle (4 weeks apart), while in south Carolina, a single dose is provided.

TB is common in the united states, with the incidence of TB disease in 2014 being 3.0 per 100,000 population. only 128 active TB cases were diagnosed during the years 1998 through 2012. the incidence of active TB has been found to be significantly higher among nonwhite race/ethnic groups than among Caucasians. the principal risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection in the military include birth in a country with a high incidence of TB disease. active TB is most commonly seen in ships, prisons, or disciplinary barracks. it is estimated that 3% to 4% of infected individuals will develop active TB within the first year after tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion, and another 5% do so thereafter (574). acid-fast bacillus sputum smear staining should be performed, notwithstanding its poor sensitivity (45% to 80%), followed by culture, which often takes up to 8 weeks to provide a result. TB disease may also be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms alone. commercially available broth culture systems allow the detection of most mycobacterial growth in 4 to 14 days, compared to 3 to 6 weeks for solid media. TB is generally based on clinical suspicion with subsequent microbiological confirmation with fluid or tissue culture. a TST reading should be evaluated by using the CDC's and the military's risk-stratified interpretation. there are currently two TST formulations, Tubersol (Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ) and Aplisol (JHP Pharmaceuticals, Rochester, MI), that can be used. the CDC recommends that NAAT-based methods be used on at least one respiratory sample from any patient suspected of having M. tuberculosis (578, 579) one of these assays can also detect M. tuberculosis and rifampin resistance directly from clinical specimens in 2 h. treatment of multidrug-resistant TB consists of at least five drugs to which the organism is sensitive, for 18 months or longer. shorter 4-month regimens have been shown to be inferior to the standard 6-month regimen and should not be used (594\u2013597) toxicity may become an issue during therapy, and several measures can be taken to prevent it. pyridoxine should be coadministered with isoniazid to prevent peripheral neuropathy. regular eye exams are recommended for individuals receiving ethambutol given its potential for ocular toxicity. if exposure was heavy or the HCP is HIV positive, therapy should be initiated before the person is retested. if the retest result is negative, isoniazid can be discontinued at that time (575, 603) new technologies offer promising advances in TB screening and prevention in the military setting. the risk of developing LTBI is variable and dependent on host-specific factors, the types of exposure during service, and the diagnostic test used, whether a TST or an IGRA. risk groups involving personnel deployed to areas where TB is endemic should be a priority (560) individual risk factors should be checked include foreign birth, visit to friends and relatives in areas of the world where TB is endemic, evidence of engagement in health care activities with potentially infective patients. adenovirus derives its name from \u201cadenoids,\u201d a term derived from the tissue from which the virus was first isolated in 1953. there are >50 adenovirus types that cause a wide variety of clinical syndromes. in the 1960s, investigators at the WRAIR documented widespread adenoviral infection (80%) among recruits. 4% to 9% to as high as 54% to 79%; hospitalization rates documented to be 33 times higher among recruits than among nonrecruits. lack of preexisting, type-specific immunity plays a key role in predisposing recruits to infection and disease. lack of preexisting, type-specific immunity plays a key factor in predisposing recruits to infection and disease. outbreaks took place during periods of nonavailability of Ad4 and Ad7 oral vaccine after its sole manufacturer ceased production in 1994. adenovirus-associated febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) returned to recruit training centers. dramatic and sustained reductions in FRI and adenovirus isolation rates were achieved. unvaccinated recruits at much greater risk of culture-positive Ad4/Ad7 infection than vaccinated recruits. unvaccinated recruits at much greater risk of culture-positive Ad4/Ad7 infection than vaccinated recruits. first outbreak due to a non-Ad4 serotype in postvaccine era involving 541 Ad infections (70% due to Ad7; 24% due to Ad3) at GLNTC. outbreak halted by resumption of vaccination in late October 1997 77 Oct\u2013Nov 1998 U.S. recruits Intensive 8-wk clinicoepidemiological prospective study of 678 recruits at Fort Jackson. 2 deaths in military recruits at GLNTC since vaccination started in 1971\u20131972 81\u201383. first 2 deaths in military recruits at GLNTC since vaccination started in 1971\u20131972 81\u201383. in 2006, Ad7 identified in 122 (76%) of 200 recruits with ARD during 4-wk basic military training; overall, 24,004 ARD cases identified among 60,000 recruits, with ARD rates of 10% per wk. in 2011\u20132012, Ad found to be responsible for most acute LRTIs among a group of 87 personnel admitted to the Armed Forces Capital Hospital in Seongnam. vaccination 95 2000\u20132012 U.S. recruits Clear documentation of impact of Ad vaccination on drastic reduction of Ad-related outcomes 96, 97, 107 Feb 2012 Chinese military Ad55 identified in several hundred soldiers hospitalized at Boading City PLA 252 military hospital. no vaccination 98\u2013100 Feb\u2013Mar 2012 Chinese recruits Ad7 strain found in 15 (83%) of 18 trainee samples. the most notable military Ad14 outbreak took place in the spring of 2007 at the U.S. air force recruit training center in Lackland, TX. the most notable outbreak took place in the spring of 2007 at the U.S. air force recruit training center in. Lackland, TX. adenovirus-associated respiratory disease in the military has most often been associated with types 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21. adenoviruses were a common cause of viral pneumonia among military recruits. the characteristics of adenovirus-associated pneumonia are similar to those due to other pathogens, making it difficult to establish a diagnosis using clinical or radiographic findings alone. adenoviruses can also be rapidly detected by several relatively new NAATs that are multiplexed to detect several viruses at the same time. these assays include a multiplex PCR whose resulting products are labeled by a primer extension step and then hybridized to detection microbeads that can be specifically sorted based on their internal dye content. none of the commercially available single-target PCRs or broad-spectrum multiplex PCRs provide genotyping data avenous ganciclovir and cidofovir have been used in the treatment of seriously ill immunocompromised patients. however, both drugs have been associated with significant renal toxicity or neutropenia (49, 123). intravenous ribavirin or ribavirin combined with immunoglobulin has been used in specific cases. adenoviruses cause a wide variety of clinical syndromes, including febrile ARD, pharyngoconjunctival fever, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, and pneumonia in healthy persons. in the 1960s, investigators at the WRAIR documented widespread adenoviral infection (80%) among recruits, who also experienced very high hospitalization rates (20%) during their first 2 months of training. in the mid- to late 1970s, 76% to 88% of incoming recruits were nonimmune to Ad4 or Ad7 upon arrival in training. anti-Ad4 immunity was found to provide 60% protection from adenovirus-associated hospitalization and 98% protection from infection. the role of gender has not been well defined to date. military population Ad serotypes(s) involved and description Reference(s) Apr\u2013May 1995 U.S. recruits Ad4 identified among 7 of 73 hospitalized unvaccinated recruits at Fort Jackson with viral culture data. first outbreak reported during initial period of vaccine unavailability during may 1994\u2013March 1995 70\u201372 Jan 1996\u2013Nov 1997 U.S. recruits Ad4 identified in 71 (90%) of 79 patients hospitalized at Fort Jackson during a 9-day period in November 1997 training sites showing heterogeneity of 7 distinct Ad4 genome types despite homogeneity of recruit source population. ARD rates much higher in initial 3 mo of BCT than in subsequent 9 mo post-BCT. clear decrease in ARD rates in 2012 recruit cohort. 17% of recruits hospitalized for an ARD (hospitalization rates of 0.9\u20133.8% per wk), with significant rates of isolation of Ad4 (72%), Ad3 (77%), and Ad21 (2%);

similar severities in Ad14 and non-Ad14 cases; similar severities in Ad14 and non-Ad14 cases. no vaccination 104 a Classification is done by date of observation or outbreak when available. reports may represent studies of acute respiratory disease (ARD) in selected military populations. outbreaks have also affected other non-U.S. military and police forces. the most notable military Ad14 outbreak took place in the spring of 2007 at the U.S. air force recruit training center in Lackland, TX. a cluster of trainees with severe FRI was identified (55, 92), many were hospitalized, and several were in intensive care. adenoviruses were a common cause of viral pneumonia among military recruits. the characteristics of adenovirus-associated pneumonia are similar to those due to other pathogens. adenoviruses can be rapidly detected by several relatively new NAATs that are multiplexed to detect several viruses at the same time. no commercially available single-target PCRs or broad-spectrum multiplex PCRs provide genotyping data on adenoviruses detected due to the number and diversity of types causing respiratory disease. tests applied in accordance with an algorithm for molecular typing of isolates exist and may also be useful in detecting evidence of coinfections and novel intermediate adenovirus strains. adenovirus type 4 and type 7 Vaccine, live, oral (1 dose), is administered to enlisted recruits 17 to 50 years of age. this vaccine can be administered simultaneously or at any interval before or after other vaccines, including live vaccines. there are specific contraindications, including individuals known to have sustained severe allergic reactions to any components of the vaccine. the novel A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (2009 pandemic influenza virus; henceforth referred to as \u201cpH1N1\u201d) affected the U.S. military in a significant way (134). hospitalization rates were also 3 to 4 times higher than those for the two preceding years, with rates being as high as 60 to 100 per 100,000 person-years. a total of 761 ILI patients tested by rRT-PCR, 97 (13%) of which had confirmed pH1N1 virus infection. 68 (70%) of those infected patients epidemiologically linked in San Diego, CA, area 141 Apr\u2013Jun 2009. 135 cases among 1,100 personnel on the USS Iwo Jima during a 3-wk period. strict isolation, active case finding, early oseltamivir treatment of ill and chemoprophylaxis of medical staff likely reduced the magnitude of the outbreak 144 May\u2013Aug 2009. largest outbreak at USS Boxer with >200 cases over a 5-wk period. symptomatic AR (49.1%); early detection with an electronic reporting system, isolation of ill, use of hand sanitizers and masks for ill, and rapid testing led to outbreak control. estimated decrease in infectiousness of 86.7% 147, 148 Jun\u2013Oct 2009 Singaporean military personnel 292 (29) several hundred overall (ND), 148 (11) at USAFA outbreak Post-4th-of-July social-mixing event led to a rapid peak in pH1N1 transmission within 48 h. variable secondary ARs (7% to 18%) among 10 squadron units; 1st report of prolonged (>7 days postonset) pH1N1 virus shedding by virus culture. most recruits (n = 5,954 [94%]) sustained mild to moderate ILI and returned to duty when asymptomatic. most pH1N1-infected cases had mild illness with relative absence of sore throat (21%); receipt of 2008-2009 seasonal TIV was documented to be 30% effective in reducing pH1N1 infection. pH1N1 was noted to affect several risk groups, including shipboard personnel (8% to 39%), military (high school-equivalent) students (12% to 15%), military service academy students (11%), advanced (engineer) military trainees (3% to 19%), and military personnel deploying to Southwest Asia (5% to 10%) influenza was found to be responsible for as many as 7,000 to 25,000 cases per week in the MHS. drifted H3N2 viruses have begun to predominate, causing an increase in the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations among both civilians and military personnel in 2014 to 2015. influenza-related mortality rate among military personnel has been very low. only nine influenza-associated deaths were documented during the past 16 years (1998 to 2014), three of which occurred during the 2009-2010 pandemic period. there is no adequate dependent-based mortality registry to estimate mortality impact for this group. new, triple-reassortant, swine-origin H3 variant viruses have been responsible for >300 cases in the united states since the summer of 2011. heightened vigilance among swine-exposed populations, increased sanitation and simple personal hygiene measures are believed to play an important role in the containment of these viruses. three waves of H7N9 virus activity have been seen. this epidemic continues to be spread from LPMs in china. there have been no reported cases of H7N9 infection in the united states. at least three H10N8- and three H5N6-associated cases of severe pneumonia, each of which was fatal, were identified in china between November 2013 and February 2015. human infection with the latter four subtypes probably represents spillover from LPMs or backyard poultry farms. viremia rarely occurs in uncomplicated influenza, except in cases of H5N1-infected patients. most adults with symptomatic influenza virus infection have uncomplicated illness. sudden onset of fever, cough, headaches, and malaise resolve over 3 to 5 days. commercially available RIDTs (211) are antigen detection tests that detect influenza virus nucleoprotein antigen. they can provide results at bedside (within 15 min or less) thus, results are available in a clinically relevant time frame to inform clinical decisions. RIDT sensitivities vary widely (10% to 80%) compared to viral culture or reverse transcriptase PCR. the u.s. military has been an active participant in the development of PCR-based platforms for the detection of influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens in the past decade. a molecular-based testing platform, called the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS), was developed by the military to detect select agents, such as those responsible for anthrax and tularemia. influenza virus detection reagents and other testing materials were developed to identify generic subtypes A and B as well as specific subtypes H1 (seasonal and pandemic variants), H3, H5, H7, H9 (avian variants), and H3 (swine variants) new FDA-cleared multiplex PCR tests that also allow simultaneous detection of influenza virus as well as other respiratory agents. the only two classes of FDA-approved antivirals for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza virus infection are the M2 inhibitors (oral amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are active, in vitro and in vivo, against all strains of influenza A virus; however, they are not active against influenza B viruses. NIs have been found to be effective in reducing mortality rates for patients hospitalized with pH1N1 virus infection. treatment of adults with NIs reduced the risk of death by 25% compared with no antiviral treatment. early treatment within 48 h of onset was also associated with 60% reduction in the risk of death. intravenous zanamivir, an investigational drug, can be considered. it is available through enrollment in a clinical trial or by request to the manufacturer for use in hospitalized patients with severe influenza virus infection (250). nitazoxanide (NTX), a first-in-class thiazolide anti-infective, has been found to inhibit the replication of influenza viruses in cell culture. the second drug, favipiravir (T-705), has been shown to be effective orally (238) fludase (DAS181) has been formulated as an inhalant, which can last for 2 or more days (238) this drug has been tested in a phase 2 RCT and was found to reduce viral replication. reviews have found that NIs, but not M2 agents, provide some degree of protection as chemoprophylactic agents. zanamivir (at a dose of 75 mg daily) and zanamivir (at a dose of 10 mg daily) have been shown to be efficacious as both seasonal (70% to 90% efficacy) and postexposure (67% to 89% efficacy) chemoprophylaxis against influenza virus in households (236) the goal is to exceed 90% immunization of all military personnel by mid-December of each year. delays in receipt of vaccine and other logistic and access issues are taken into consideration. the u.s. military has a mandatory influenza vaccination policy for all its HCPs. influenza viruses continue to affect them (135, 162, 273). humoral immunity is transitory, requiring annual immunizations. this is most likely explained by distinct patterns of B-cell activation and priming. this is most likely explained by distinct patterns of B-cell activation. an estimated 8.7 million days of duty were lost due to influenza, with a substantial impact on operational readiness. the novel A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (2009 pandemic influenza virus; henceforth referred to as \u201cpH1N1\u201d) affected the u.s. military in a significant way. hospitalization rates were 3 to 4 times higher than those for the two preceding years. influenza-associated deaths in the 1998-2013 period were attributed to pH1N1 virus during pandemic period (April 2009 to August 2010) 83; R. N. Potter, unpublished data Apr 2009 U.S. military dependents 4 (ND) first detection of pH1N1 virus among dependent children in San Diego, CA (2 cases), and San Antonio, TX (2 cases); subsequent development of rRT-PCR assay for rapid testing by the CDC in late April 2009. initial peak of 10\u201320 143 May\u2013Jun 2009 U.S. military shipboard personnel 135 (12) Aborted an outbreak aboard the USS Roosevelt (crew of 280) by hospitalizing 1 case at local VA medical center. strict isolation, active case finding, early oseltamivir treatment of ill and chemoprophylaxis of medical staff likely reduced the magnitude of the outbreak. 146 Jun\u2013Jul 2009 Peruvian military shipboard personnel 78 (22) Large outbreak among 355 nonimmune crew members over a 4-wk period following deployment to San Francisco, CA, in late June 2009. serological infection rate found to be more than twice as high as the symptomatic AR (49.1%); early detection with an electronic reporting system, isolation of ill, use of hand sanitizers and masks for ill. high prevalence of anti-pH1N1 151 Jun\u2013Aug 2009 U.S. military shipboard personnel 142 (32) High rate of asymptomatic infection (53%) and higher risk of illness for females (OR = 2.2), Marine Corps (OR = 1.7), and younger personnel (19\u201324 yr old) (OR = 3.9); improved infection control measures. in first wave in June\u2013July 2009 (outbreaks at U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force recruit camps); larger peak in no. of cases in second wave in august\u2013October 2009 affecting all 8 recruit training centers 138 May 2009\u2013Apr 2010 french military ND (0.4/wk) peak in transmission rates (0.4% per wk) in early December 2009; much lower than national rates in the civilian population. pH1N1 was noted to affect several risk groups, including shipboard personnel (8% to 39%), military (high school-equivalent) students (12% to 15%), military service academy students (12% to 15%), advanced (engineer) military trainees (3% to 19%), and military personnel deploying to Southwest Asia (SWA) (5% to 10%) laxis of medical staff was shown to limit large-scale spread to military members and civilian populace in new york city. influenza was found to be responsible for 7,000 to 25,000 cases per week in the MHS, of which 3,000 to 16,000 involved military personnel (162). influenza-related mortality rate among military personnel has been very low. only nine influenza-associated deaths were documented during the past 16 years. human infections with other avian-derived influenza viruses (AIVs) have been reported since 1997 and are of concern to the military. new, triple-reassortant, swine-origin H3 variant viruses (here called \u201cH3N2v\u201d) have been responsible for >300 cases in the united states since the summer of 2011. there have been no reported cases in the u.s. military, and the risk to military personnel is deemed to be low. three human infections with H7N9 virus were reported to the WHO. these viruses have spread efficiently among live-poultry market workers. they are closely related to low-pathogenic H9N2 avian viruses. they became endemic among poultry in the far East. at least three H10N8- and three H5N6-associated cases of severe pneumonia, each of which was fatal, were identified in China between November 2013 and February 2015. human infection with the latter four subtypes probably represents spillover from LPMs or backyard poultry farms. viremia rarely occurs in uncomplicated influenza, except in cases of H5N1-infected patients. most adults with symptomatic influenza virus infection have uncomplicated illness, with sudden onset of fever, cough, headaches, and malaise. RIDT sensitivities have varied widely (10% to 80%) compared to viral culture or reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) RIDT sensitivity is lower in adults and elderly patients than in young children. RIDT specificity has been very good, ranging from 85% to 100%. sample processing automation facilitates high-throughput molecular diagnostics for the detection of viral nucleic acids from a variety of respiratory tract samples. Molecular assays can be used in conjunction with other diagnostic assays, and with clinical and epidemiological information, to assist in patient management and treatment. the military has been an active participant in the development of PCR-based platforms for the detection of influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens in the past decade. influenza virus detection reagents and other testing materials were developed to identify generic subtypes A and B as well as specific subtypes H1 (seasonal and pandemic variants), H3, H5, H7, H9 (avian variants), and H3 (swine variant) new FDA-cleared multiplex PCR tests that also allow simultaneous detection of influenza virus as well as other respiratory agents, either as single viruses or as copathogens. serologic assays for influenza A and B viruses exist but are not routinely used for clinical diagnosis. but these assays have important roles in outbreak response and epidemiological studies. the only two classes of FDA-approved antivirals for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza virus infection are the M2 inhibitors (oral amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) amivir was found to be effective in reducing the duration of influenza symptoms by 21% (from 123 h down to 98 h) and the risk of hospitalization by 65% (compared to 1.7% in placebo recipients) the CDC and the FDA recommend the use of NIs for the treatment of influenza infection (236, 241) the rate of resistance to the NIs has been limited to 1% of the prevailing seasonal influenza viruses in the united states and worldwide. peramivir is a third NI treatment option, which is administered intravenously as a single 600-mg dose, for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza infection in adults (237). for severely ill patients who have strongly suspected or documented oseltamivir resistance or malabsorption, gastric stasis, or gastrointestinal bleeding, intravenous NTX has been found to be synergistic with NIs and to inhibit influenza viruses that are NI resistant (253\u2013255) treatment with NTX orally (600 mg twice daily for 5 days) has been shown to reduce the duration of influenza-associated symptoms in subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza virus infection and may represent another alternative in the near future (256). systematic reviews have found that NIs, but not M2 agents, provide some degree of protection as chemoprophylactic agents. zanamivir (at a dose of 75 mg daily) and zanamivir (at a dose of 10 mg daily) have been shown to be efficacious as both seasonal (70% to 90% efficacy) and postexposure (67% to 89% efficacy) chemoprophylaxis against influenza virus in households (236) the u.s. military requires influenza vaccination of all military recruits and all personnel on active duty status on a yearly basis (2). the goal is to exceed 90% immunization of all military personnel by mid-December of each year. delays in receipt of vaccine and other logistic and access issues are taken into consideration. a large proportion of military personnel are immunized with current influenza vaccines, but influenza viruses continue to affect them (135, 162, 273) this is most likely multifactorial in nature. humoral immunity is transitory, requiring annual immunizations (274) first large-scale study by Dutch military investigators in 1967 to 1968 identified RSV as a relatively uncommon cause of pneumonia among Dutch military recruits. the first large-scale study by Dutch military investigators in 1967 to 1968 identified RSV as a relatively uncommon cause of pneumonia among Dutch military recruits. the mean incubation period for RSV is 5 days and varies from 3 to 7 days (44, 49) viral shedding may be longer lasting in children (1 to 3 weeks) than in adults (usually no longer than 1 week) microarray- and nanochip-based assays for RSV detection have been marketed in the united states as part of larger panels for respiratory pathogen detection (290, 291). RSV is one of the viruses easily detected in respiratory specimens by several FDA-approved multiplex PCR assays (112, 117, 120, 221, 292\u2013294) a safer, humanized anti-F glycoprotein monoclonal antibody formulation, palivizumab, was developed commercially and approved by the FDA in 2009. it is very expensive, costing as much as $6,000 per person per season, making it very unlikely that it would be of practical value for more widespread use. there are no licensed vaccines for RSV. RSV has a worldwide distribution and is associated with annual outbreaks of infection in late fall, winter, or spring (280). the rate of infection of infants can be as high as 50%, and >90% of young children are infected by the age of 5 years. asymptomatic infections were common, affecting 46% of those not previously immune (287). bronchiolitis has been associated with a family history of asthma as well as with secondhand exposure to cigarette smoke. the time required to detect RSV in cell culture can be shortened to 1 to 2 days by employing SVCC systems followed by fluorescent-antibody staining. the sensitivity of such tests is greatly dependent on the quality of the specimen, with NP aspirates superior to NP brushing or swab specimens. SV RNA was shown to modulate infection (e.g., reduce clinical symptom scores and viral load) in 87 healthy nonimmune adults in a 2013 placebo-controlled, challenge study (303) this drug appears to be safe, with only mild transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and reversible decreases in neutrophil counts (304). a safer, humanized anti-F glycoprotein monoclonal antibody formulation, palivizumab, was developed commercially and a number of subjects required hospitalization, and two deaths occurred. an ideal RSV vaccine would need to be shown to be safe and immunogenic. phase 1 and 2 trials are ongoing using live attenuated, chimeric/vectored, nanoparticle, and subunit vaccine candidates. shedding starts at symptom onset and can last for up to 10 days in the case of SARS-CoV (49) there are two well-documented reports that illustrate the relevance of HCoVs in the recruit training setting (286, 315) the majority of the infected HCPs presented with no or minor symptoms. many of these HCPs were asymptomatic contacts identified through screening of close contacts of confirmed cases. infections with non-SARS-CoV non-MERS-CoV strains are associated with mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and pharyngitis. lower respiratory tract illnesses occur more frequently in older adults, in those with cardiopulmonary disease, or immunocompromised patients. MERS-CoV-infected patients tend to be older (65 years of age) as well as overweight, have diabetes mellitus or end-stage renal disease, and sustain coinfections requiring admission to an intensive care unit. the estimated CFR is roughly 37% to 40%, although earlier in the epidemic in late 2013, the CFR was estimated to be as high as 51% to 65%. at least two multiplex PCR assays can be used for PCR-based diagnosis of HCoV strains. only the nested multiplex PCR system has been cleared by the FDA. immunofluorescence assays are available for detection of all HCoVs. standard, contact, and airborne precautions are recommended for the management of hospitalized patients with known or suspected MERS-CoV infection (365) the recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE), source control (e.g., placing a face mask on potentially infected patients when outside an airborne infection isolation room) and environmental infection control measures are applicable to any health care setting. inavir, mycophenolate, cyclosporine A, and chloroquine need to be conducted in order to further assess their efficacy (259) the use of convalescent plasma or highly neutralizing antibody preparations appears to be safe, represents a promising intervention that warrants careful clinical study. the NIH and industry partners are supporting the development and testing of drugs to treat MERS-CoV infection (375) 8,000 cases and >750 deaths were reported in 26 countries. HCoVs are transmitted by means of respiratory aerosols and by the fecal-oral route. shedding starts at symptom onset and can last for up to 10 days in case of SARS-CoV. a total of 25 countries have been affected worldwide (317, 321, 323, 324) this virus appears to have a limited capacity for human-to-human transmission. the majority of the infected HCPs presented with no or minor symptoms. the low reproduction number (R0) estimates have been as low as 0.5 to 1.3 (330, 331) and as high as 2.0 to 6.7 in the KSA (332) no MERS-CoV infections have been identified in the u.s. military. another quarter of cases, mostly older adults or those with comorbidities, develop ARDS. mortality rates reach upwards of 12%, with mortality rates reaching upwards of 12%. routine clinical diagnosis is performed by molecular methods, specifically rRT-PCR, which is favored for diagnosis (49). secretions from the upper (e.g., NP swab and oropharyngeal swab) or lower respiratory tract are preferred; serum, stool, and urine samples can also be used. all HCoVs can be detected by the PCR-ESI-MS test platform. military-specific guidance has been provided by the AFHSC. there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of any HCoVs. recent treatment of patients with severe MERS-CoV infections in the KSA with oral ribavirin and interferon alpha has been shown to improve short-term survival. survival rates of 70% and 30%, compared to 29% and 17%, respectively, for those who did not receive such therapy. the use of convalescent plasma or highly neutralizing antibody preparations appears to be safe. parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV-1) to PIV-4 and rhinoviruses, first isolated in the 1950s, represent the most common etiologic agents of the common cold. in temperate climates, circulation of hMPV is detected mostly during late winter and early spring months. human metapneumovirus represents the third most common cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in children. hMPV infection rates have been consistently below 1%. infection rates for PIVs and HRVs have been 3% to 4%. these three pathogens are being recognized as military-relevant pathogens. they are being increasingly recognized as significant causes of respiratory illnesses. in young adults, these three pathogens usually cause mild self-limited illnesses (40, 58, 378) lower respiratory tract symptoms, including dyspnea and wheezing, can appear with older age, resembling the symptomatology seen in younger RSV-infected patients. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations have also been noted to occur. several genes, including those for the F, N, M, and L proteins, have conserved regions that can be used for amplification using RT-PCR. infection is confirmed by amplification of two different gene products (394) multiplex PCR assays that detect several pathogens in nasal or respiratory secretions are commonly used in the clinical setting. no specific tests for any HRV genome type exist as yet. there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of hMPV-, PIV-, or rhinovirus-associated respiratory illnesses. human monoclonal antibody therapy with palivizumab and other formulations has been attempted in hMPV-infected animal models. however, there are no adequate data to support their use as an adjunct to supportive therapy among humans. there are currently no commercially available therapeutic interventions with proven efficacy for the treatment of HRV infections. hMPV was originally isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions of children with upper respiratory tract infections. parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV-1) to PIV-4 and rhinoviruses, first isolated in the 1950s, represent the most common etiologic agents of the common cold. hMPV and PIV infection rates among patients with FRI, in comparison, were found to be rather low (1% each) hMPV infection rates have been consistently below 1%, whereas infection rates for PIVs and HRVs have been 3% to 4%. in routine surveillance of FRI cases among Singaporean military personnel, infection rates of 1.8%, 1.6%, and 7.4% were documented. HRV infections have been associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms of shortness of breath and diagnoses of pneumonia (286, 384) in young, otherwise healthy adults, these three pathogens usually cause mild self-limited illnesses (40, 58, 378) hMPV-infected patients, however, lower respiratory tract symptoms, including dyspnea and wheezing, can appear with older age. an IFA using virus-specific monoclonal antibodies is available but is deemed to be less sensitive than RT-PCR (392) molecular methods are favored for the detection of hMPV. several genes, including those for the F, N, M, and L proteins, have conserved regions that can be used for amplification. no specific tests for any HRV genome type exist as yet. identification of exact HRV serogroup requires follow-up nucleotide sequencing. there are no FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hMPV-, PIV-, or rhinovirus-associated respiratory illnesses. fludase (DAS181) may be effective for the treatment of immunocompromised patients with severe PIV-related lung disease. reduction in viral load is associated with clinical improvement (404, 405) animal studies have also shown promise in terms of the use of hMPV-specific fusion inhibitors. inactivated vaccines for PIV-1 to -3 have not been associated with side effects similar to those of hMPV vaccines. the pneumococcus is estimated to be responsible for >10 million cases and up to 1.3 million deaths in young children (5 years of age) outbreaks are common in less developed countries such as south africa and papua new Guinea (409) a very large outbreak in 2009 among U.S. Army recruits at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, with 2 meningitis deaths and an additional 72 pneumonia cases. this interaction was best made evident during the 2009 pandemic in the united states, when pH1N1 virus infection was associated with increasing rates of pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalization. coccal pneumonia hospitalizations in the united states documented that concurrent influenza infection increases the risk of pneumonia in patients of all ages (423). sixth, pneumococcal infection of already influenza virus-infected animals has been shown to result in more severe disease than infection with either pathogen alone (428). sputum culture recommends sputum Gram's stain and culture sensitivities. sensitivity and specificity have been estimated to be 70% and 96%, respectively, among hospitalized patients. the pneumococcal urinary antigen test is a rapid bedside diagnostic antigen detection card test. quantitative PCR can provide better accuracy with the use of the lytA gene target, raising the sensitivity to 94% and the specificity to 96% (447). it is rare to find cavitation or necrotizing pneumonia, unless another organism is implicated. use of the rapid urinary antigen test allows narrowing of therapy to amoxicillin in test-positive young military personnel with nonsevere CAP. it appears that the increased susceptibility to bacterial invasive disease and pneumococcal pneumonia is especially pronounced within the first 7 days of influenza virus infection (422) it is imperative to recognize and rule out influenza virus coinfection promptly and to begin antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. military pneumococcal pneumonia outbreaks have been halted by using mass antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis (416, 419), mass pneumococcal vaccination (421, 468, 469), or combination of both (413\u2013415, 418). the response to the pneumococcal vaccine takes at least 7 to 10 days to be effective, while in such outbreaks, an immediate response is needed. the pneumococcus is estimated to be responsible for >10 million cases and up to 1.3 million deaths in young children (5 years of age) in the united states, it is estimated to cause 445,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths each year. in the military, after influenza virus, the pneumococcus constitutes the second leading cause of pneumonia hospitalization (411) a very large outbreak in 2009 among U.S. army recruits at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, with 2 meningitis deaths and an additional 72 pneumonia cases. this interaction was best made evident during the 2009 pandemic in the united states, when pH1N1 virus infection was associated with increasing rates of pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalization. this interaction was best made evident during the 2009 pandemic in the united states. pneumococcal vaccines in RCTs have been shown to reduce rates of influenza-associated pneumonia in children by 45%. sixth, in ferret animal models, pneumococcal infection of already influenza virus-infected animals has been shown to result in more severe disease than infection with either pathogen alone. sputum culture recommends sputum Gram's stain and culture sensitivities. sensitivity and specificity have been estimated to be 70% and 96%. the pneumococcal urinary antigen test constitutes a rapid bedside diagnostic antigen detection card test. PCR can provide better accuracy with the use of the lytA gene target, raising the sensitivity to 94% and the specificity to 96% (447). it is rare to find cavitation or necrotizing pneumonia, unless another organism is implicated (450, 451). use of the rapid urinary antigen test allows narrowing of therapy to amoxicillin in test-positive young military personnel with nonsevere CAP. combination therapy for severe bacteremic pneumonia is usually limited to 3 to 5 days or until antimicrobial susceptibility testing results are available. combination therapy for severe bacteremic pneumonia is usually limited to 3 to 5 days. military pneumococcal pneumonia outbreaks have been halted by using mass antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis (416, 419), mass pneumococcal vaccination (421, 468, 469), or combination of both (413\u2013415, 418). the response to the pneumococcal vaccine takes at least 7 to 10 days to be effective, while in such outbreaks, an immediate response is needed. streptococcus respiratory infections have had a long history of impact on the military dating back to WWII. in more recent times, streptococcus-related respiratory disease has continued have an impact on the military. 20\u201360 admissions per wk; hospitalization rates as high as 5\u201310% in 2 company-sized units. 19 cellulitis/pyoderma, 2 ARF, 1 scarlet fever, 1 TSS, 1 AGN, 1 pneumonia, and 5 peritonsillar abscess cases noted; rapid control achieved with mass plus tandem i.m. 730 (72%) suffered ARD, 133 (13.1%) of whom sought medical attention; 3 cases hospitalized with pneumonia (1 C. pneumoniae and 2 S. pneumoniae); posttraining S. pyogenes colonization rate lower in the azithromycin (0.3%) than in the i.m. BPG (4.8%) or placebo (8.3%) treatment group; no effect on S. pneumoniae colonization rates; efficacy of azithromycin vs bacterial infection higher. 1,098 cases of GAS-related illness, 713 (65%) of whom were vaccinated. risk of GAS-related illness estimated to be 50\u201377% lower in vaccinated recruits. rapid outbreak control attained after shortening of dosing interval for i.m. BPG or erythromycin prophylaxis (20\u201330%) noted to be major factor. 38 invasive cases in 2006 compared to 17 cases in 2005. 50% increase in rates due to discontinuation of routine BPG prophylaxis in July 2006. ARD and SASI rates did not increase. influenza vaccination has been correlated with a significantly lower risk of streptococcus-related illness (482) in cohort-based studies of the effect of influenza vaccination, influenza vaccination has been correlated with a significantly (50% to 77%) lower risk of streptococcus-related illness. chemoprophylaxis and treatment of all members of the high-risk population are important. group A streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis have an incubation period of 2 to 4 days. cases appear to predominate during the winter, probably due to increased crowding. suppurative complications include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, suppurative lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis, otitis media, meningitis, brain abscesses, venous sinus thrombosis, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis. suppurative complications include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, suppur the IDSA recommends diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis by using a throat swab. the gold standard for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis is bacterial culture (>90% sensitivity); rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are supplementary, with a sensitivity of 55% to 85% (498, 499) antistreptococcal antibody titers are available but are not clinically useful for acute diagnosis. treatment with oral penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is the first-line therapy for group A streptococcal pharyngitis (499) treatment should include surgical debridement of infected tissue when necessary. hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been found to be beneficial, especially in cases of severe disease (such as necrotizing fasciitis) the use of BPG is acceptable and recommended as a mass intervention in order to rapidly terminate disease transmission (2, 487) in the recruit setting, the use of BPG is acceptable and recommended as a mass intervention in order to rapidly terminate disease transmission (2, 487) chemoprophylaxis with BPG is presently in place at seven of nine recruit training centers. some training sites forego chemoprophylaxis without apparent outbreaks of group A streptococcal disease. but with cessation of BPG chemoprophylaxis, there is a real possibility of creating a bacterial reservoir by not providing alternative chemoprophylaxis to penicillin-allergic trainees. streptococcal infection is monitored in conjunction with ARD activity. at all recruit training centers, streptococcal infection is reported as the Streptococcal-Acute Respiratory Disease Surveillance Index. no streptococcal respiratory disease outbreaks have been documented in the military. since 2011, no streptococcal respiratory disease outbreaks have been documented in the military. phylaxis BPG 477 Mar 1991 Army Ranger trainees, Fort Benning, GA, and Dugway, UT 9% 16 culture-confirmed pharyngitis cases in a 180-man unit within a 1-wk period. 28 cellulitis cases noted; rapid control achieved with mass plus tandem i.m. 14 GAS cases among 3 training battalions (n = 450) at Fort Leonard Wood and 15 GAS cases among 210 trainees at Fort Knox. rapid outbreak control with i.m.

pneumonia. it caused 10% of pneumonia cases in one study (18) and 49% in a second study in the 1960s. it was also documented to account for 25% of respiratory tract infections in Dutch recruits (284). a recent outbreak in 2007 affected 179 (17%) members of a U.S. navy crew of 1,074 persons, including 69 ARD cases and 50 radiographically confirmed pneumonia cases (522). nonrecruit trainees have also been found to be at high risk. in 2013 to 2014, 11 of 15 cadets with pneumonia had evidence of a recent C. pneumoniae infection (711). s in the past 15 years, C. pneumoniae has been identified as an etiologic agent in as many as 10% to 15% of pneumonia cases affecting military recruits. one report found that infections with these pathogens were associated with deployment to Korea and were responsible for a majority of afebrile ARD cases seen in that region. the cold agglutinin assay was previously used for Mycoplasma but is neither very sensitive (50% to 70%) nor specific. serologic tests for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are available for use in seroepidemiological studies and outbreak investigations. tracycline (516) caused 10% of pneumonia cases in one study (18) and 49% in a second study in the 1960s among U.S. military recruits (517) it was also documented to account for 25% of respiratory tract infections in Dutch military recruits (284). 11 (73.3%) of 15 cadets with pneumonia had evidence of C. pneumoniae infection (711) among cadets at Colorado Springs, CO, 8 (3.8%) of 208 cases of pneumonia among marine corps personnel had evidence of a recent C. pneumoniae infection (519, 520) in 1998 at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, 41 (3.2%) individuals who presented for care with an ARD had evidence of infection. in military populations, M. pneumoniae is most often identified in patients whose symptoms are compatible with CAP. after a 6- to 32-day incubation period, it presents with onset of fever, malaise, headache, and nonproductive cough that gradually worsens and becomes debilitating. skin, cardiac, central nervous system, and renal involvement are not commonly seen in military populations but have been observed elsewhere (527) fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and levofloxacin) or doxycycline are acceptable alternatives. a longer duration or increased dosage may be required for extrapulmonary involvement of Mycoplasma (527). pertussis continues to be a major problem in developing countries. a total of 75 cases were identified, 39 (52%) of which involved children aged 5 to 14 years and another 25 (33%) of which occurred among adolescents and young adults. most of these cases have involved children 16 years of age, with large clusters involving 12 or more cases noted to occur at seven military installations. the incubation period for pertussis is usually 9 to 10 days, with a wide range of 6 to 20 days (42) in otherwise healthy adults, pertussis presents with a gradual onset of a paroxysmal, nonproductive, unrelenting, hacking cough. the cough can result in cyanosis or posttussive emesis. assays for the detection of B. pertussis are available, providing results within 1 h (112, 120) the CDC and several state public health laboratories offer PCR and serologic testing support. the CDC recommends a macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin) for the treatment of pertussis in patients >1 month of age. acellular vaccines approved for use in 1997 were associated with reduced rates of rare severe side effects seen with whole-cell vaccines (552) this vaccination program led to a major decrease in incidence compared with that in the prevaccine era. pertussis continues to be a major problem in developing countries, where it is estimated to cause 200,000 deaths each year. in the past 5 years, major outbreaks have taken place in Washington state. in the past 5 years, major outbreaks have taken place in the past 5 years. an increase in the incidence of pertussis among U.S. military personnel and dependents has also been noted. s in 1993 through 1994, 6% to 17% showed serologic evidence of infection. increased risks and outbreaks have been documented for boarding school students and military recruits. the method of choice for rapid diagnosis is PCR of a NP swab or aspirate sample. specimens should be collected in a patient care area that is separate from where vaccination occurs. testing is not recommended for asymptomatic persons, given the high false-positive rate. the CDC recommends a macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin) for pertussis. the choice of agent should be based on tolerability, drug-drug interactions, cost, and ease of adherence. an alternative drug to azithromycin should be used in patients with a predisposition to arrhythmias, such as a prolonged QT interval (551). mycobacterium tuberculosis Background historical information, epidemiology, and transmission. rates of TB disease declined rapidly during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. in the 1980s and 1990s, further declines in incidence were noted in the united states. only 128 active TB cases were diagnosed (119 pulmonary and 9 extrapulmonary) during the years 1998 through 2012, an average of only 9 cases per year (45) the incidence of active TB has been found to be significantly higher among nonwhite race/ethnic groups than among Caucasians. secondary cases of infection in close contacts can occur in up to 2% to 3% of those exposed, usually within 6 to 12 months postexposure. active TB is most commonly seen in settings with extreme crowding and poor hygiene, such as berthing areas in ships, prisons, or disciplinary barracks. acid-fast bacillus sputum smear staining should be performed, notwithstanding its poor sensitivity (45% to 80%), followed by culture, which often takes up to 8 weeks to provide a result. TB disease may also be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms alone. commercially available broth culture systems allow the detection of most mycobacterial growth in 4 to 14 days, compared to 3 to 6 weeks for solid media. a TST reading should be evaluated by using the CDC's and the military's risk-stratified interpretation. there are currently two TST formulations, Tubersol (Sanofi, Bridgewater, NJ) and Aplisol (JHP Pharmaceuticals, Rochester, MI), that can be used. the development of diagnostic tools has provided important new tools for global TB control. red assay has a rapid turnaround and is easy to use. however, the cost of this assay can limit usage in resource-poor areas. this assay has been found to have reduced sensitivity (as much as 30%) in detecting rifampin-resistant strains. rifampin daily (10 mg/kg, with a 600-mg maximum) for 4 months to accomplish 120 doses. treatment should take into consideration the patient's medical history, treatment setting, adherence considerations, and patient preference. treatment should be started as directly observed therapy with four active drugs. pyridoxine (vitamin B6) should be coadministered with isoniazid to prevent peripheral neuropathy. regular eye exams are recommended for individuals receiving ethambutol given its potential for ocular toxicity (593) bedaquiline may be used for a period of 6 months for treatment of adults with laboratory-confirmed MDR TB. if exposure was heavy or the HCP is HIV positive, therapy should be initiated before the person is retested. for HIV-negative persons, if the retest result is negative, isoniazid can be discontinued at that time (575, 603) new technologies offer promising advances in TB screening and prevention in the military setting. the risk of developing LTBI is variable and dependent on host-specific factors, the types of exposure during service, and the diagnostic test used. IGRAs are more costly, logistically difficult to implement in mass testing settings. treatment of individuals with LTBI who are deployed should be a priority (560) individual risk factors should be checked include foreign birth, visit to friends and relatives in areas where TB is endemic, evidence of engagement in health care activities with potentially infective patients, and HIV infection or other immunosuppressive conditions. rculosis (TB) is a public health concern to the military (560) TB is uncommon in the united states, with the incidence of TB disease in 2014 being 3.0 per 100,000 population, the lowest incidence ever recorded (568) only 128 active TB cases were diagnosed (119 pulmonary and 9 extrapulmonary) during the years 1998 through 2012. the principal risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection in the military include birth in a country with a high incidence of TB disease, prolonged residence in a country where TB is endemic, prolonged residence in a country where TB is endemic. the risk of infection may also be higher among military members who engage in activities that expose them to local populations. 3% to 4% of infected individuals will develop active TB within the first year after tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion. TB is, by far, the most common form of disease presentation in the military. at least three sputum samples need to be taken from persons suspected of having TB disease, each collected in 8- to 24-h intervals. TB disease may also be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms alone (e.g., spiking fever, sputum production, shortness of breath, and weight loss) commercially available broth culture systems allow the detection of most mycobacterial growth in 4 to 14 days compared to 3 to 6 weeks for solid media. two brands of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) have been developed and could be used in place of a TST. the development of FDA-cleared molecular tests has played an important role in improving patient outcomes. the CDC recommends that NAAT-based methods be used on at least one respiratory sample from any patient suspected of having M. tuberculosis (578, 579) one of these assays can also detect M. tuberculosis and rifampin resistance directly from clinical specimens in 2 h. treatment should be started as directly observed therapy with four active drugs. drug resistance is not suspected and drug sensitivity is later confirmed by cultures. alternative antimicrobials should be chosen based on drug susceptibilities and clearance of M. tuberculosis from sputum. bedaquiline may be used for a period of 6 months for treatment of adults with laboratory-confirmed MDR TB. this drug should be used only in combination with at least 3 to 4 other antimicrobials to which M. tuberculosis is susceptible. other anti-TB drug regimens are in the pipeline. TB elimination will require newer, more effective vaccines developed by using modern molecular genetics and biotechnology techniques. TB elimination will require newer, more effective vaccines developed using modern molecular genetics and biotechnology techniques. the risk of developing LTBI is variable and dependent on host-specific factors, the types of exposure during service, and the diagnostic test used, whether a TST or an IGRA. IGRAs are more costly, logistically difficult to implement in mass testing settings, and create a substantial burden on the supporting laboratory. personnel with suspected clinical findings of or epidemiological risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection should be treated for LTBI. if the test result is positive, the patient should be evaluated for the possibility of active TB. such treatment is critical in order to limit infectiousness and secondary transmission. the NHRC established a febrile respiratory illness (FRI) surveillance program for recruits in 1998 (3). this program has been immensely valuable in identifying clusters of respiratory disease among U.S. Army trainees for almost 50 years. weekly tracking of respiratory disease morbidity is done (383). this system identified the return of significant respiratory disease morbidity across all services during the period of adenovirus vaccination cessation (spring of 1999 through fall of 2011). data from this project, as well as from a large, 4,000-subject, phase 3 RCT of adenovirus 4 and 7 vaccines led by NHRC and WRAIR investigators have been critical in assessing adenoviral morbidity among recruits the NHRC has been conducting shipboard FRI surveillance since 2002. individuals on ships traveling to foreign ports may be susceptible to emerging illnesses. this program allows the military to monitor the incidence of and etiologies responsible for respiratory illnesses aboard U.S. Navy ships. this program provides a weekly assessment of influenza activity (619), allows early influenza virus strain detection and subtyping, provides comprehensive influenza virus genomic sequencing and characterization, and facilitates influenza vaccine effectiveness estimations (620). this program has allowed military medical officials to coordinate and expand MTF-based respiratory disease surveillance among the uniformed services and with doD partners overseas. adenovirus vaccines effectively controlled adenovirus-associated respiratory disease in recruit training camps for almost 3 decades. adenovirus-associated febrile respiratory disease promptly returned to pre-vaccine-era levels. adenovirus-associated febrile respiratory disease promptly returned to pre-vaccine-era levels. the impact of adenovirus vaccination was dramatic, with an extreme drop in the numbers of Ad4 and Ad7 cases as well as non-Ad4- or non-Ad7-associated cases. the impact was dramatic, with an extreme drop in the numbers of Ad4 and Ad7 cases as well as non-Ad4- or non-Ad7-associated cases. the adenovirus vaccine program was successfully implemented for almost 30 years, far longer than the term of any U.S. government official. it is currently costing $34 million per year (633) adenovirus, hMPV, parainfluenza types 1 through 3 via PCR. all test results were negative, leaving investigators without an explanation. adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza types 1 through 3 tested positive. an extension of this work has included the development of influenza transmission and severity prediction models (641) these modeling efforts have taken advantage of the AFHSC's defense medical surveillance system (DMSS), which contains demographic, deployment, inpatient, outpatient, and immunization data that allow military-unique analyses. if one was interested to know which variables are associated with \u201cdeath due to influenza\u201d as the outcome of interest, a model with \u201cdeath due to influenza\u201d would be developed. the military has supported data modeling and analysis efforts that have delineated risk factors for severe outcomes associated with influenza infection. such efforts have resulted in the estimation of influenza transmission rates and clinical ARs for novel influenza viruses in military populations. a 45% decrease in respiratory disease rates was reported in the navy studies. hand washing with soap and water has been shown to reduce the incidence of respiratory infections by 21% among young children 5 years of age. simple hand washing with soap and water has also been shown to achieve an almost immediate reduction in culture- and PCR-detectable influenza virus on the hands of human volunteers. HH practices have been found to provide a 55% reduction in the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses. two recent studies of school-age populations have shown that HH interventions can reduce ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. but their effectiveness is greatly dependent on the study setting. cloth masks have actually been found to increase the risk of ILI and influenza virus infection rates compared to face masks among health care workers in the first RCT conducted in Vietnam (716). the best data supporting the use of face masks in the prevention of respiratory disease are probably for reducing the risk of SARS-CoV infection (669). five well-conducted studies of recruits have shown a direct association between respiratory disease rates and increased levels of crowding. the first study looked at recruits in Fort Humphreys, VA, during the 1918-1919 pandemic and documented higher rates among units training in crowded environments than elsewhere (676). the degree of cohorting was not specifically assessed in a controlled, prospective fashion. these studies support the notion that interruption of outbreaks may be possible if contact between members of separate training companies can be avoided early (e.g., within the initial 2 to 3 weeks of training) adenovirus Vaccines and the military: Lessons Relearned. military

adenovirus. vaccines in the mid- to late 1960s. adenovirus vaccines effectively controlled adenovirus-associated respiratory disease in recruit training camps for almost 3 decades (until 1999) the manufacturer (Wyeth Labs) ceased production in 1994 (94) adenovirus-associated febrile respiratory disease promptly returned to pre-vaccine-era levels (79) decline in adenovirus-associated disease burden (from 5.8 cases per 1,000 person-weeks) in 2000 to 2011 to 0.02 cases per 1,000 person-weeks in 2012. estimated prevention of one death, 13,000 clinical adenovirus illnesses, and 1,100 to 2,700 hospitalizations each year among U.S. military recruits. the military has sophisticated laboratory and respiratory disease surveillance capabilities with reach across the globe. laboratory capabilities include genetic sequencing and assay development, which can be used in the face of an emerging threat to quickly develop diagnostic and surveillance testing capacities for novel pathogens. a hospital in amman, Jordan, experienced an outbreak of severe, acute respiratory infections among its staff. the samples were collected from the earliest-known cases of MERS-CoV. subsequent full genomic sequencing of one of the isolates was successfully accomplished by NAMRU-3 and Naval Medical Research Command scientists. samples from the four nondeceased patients were found to be negative. 640 models allow researchers the opportunity to examine the relative importance of specific variables regarding defined outcomes. a model with \u201cdeath due to influenza\u201d as the outcome of interest would be developed and then examined to see which explanatory or predictor variables are associated (as measured statistically) with the outcome. personal hygiene measures, such as hand washing, and hand hygiene, have shown variable efficacy in preventing the spread of viral infections. some airborne pathogens are particularly problematic to control, such as adenoviruses and M. tuberculosis, which can survive long periods of time. a 45% decrease in respiratory disease rates was reported in the navy studies. 33% to 40% reductions in clinic visits for ARD and sore throats were seen in the air force study. hand washing with soap and water has been shown to reduce the incidence of respiratory infections by 21% among young children 5 years of age. the key factors that seem to dictate success are the implementation and monitoring of strict compliance with these measures (657, 659) face masks and N95 respirators have a greater filtration capacity than face masks. the best data supporting the use of face masks in the prevention of respiratory disease are probably for reducing the risk of SARS-CoV infection (670). china found inconclusive evidence of the efficacy of face masks in preventing influenza infection (671) continuous use of N95 respirators, but not face masks, was associated with greater protection of HCPs against clinical respiratory illness. the CDC recommends that susceptible personnel wear an N95 respirator upon entering a room with a patient known or suspected to be infected with TB. the fourth investigation constituted an observational study of ARD rates among recruits at Fort Benning, GA. the fifth study involved marine corps recruits in San Diego, CA, in February 2004 through March 2005. the current U.S. military space guidelines recommending 72 ft2 of floor space per trainee are based on observational data. the use of glycol vapors has been evaluated in one military barracks-based study. positive results showed reduced ARD rates in intervention barracks compared to those in untreated control barracks (680) the effectiveness of UV light irradiation was deemed to be too small to support this recommendation as a viable one. health authorities have promoted nonvaccine, nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent ARD in military settings. other measures such as head-to-toe sleeping arrangements, physical barriers and limiting interactions between training cohorts should be considered. airborne transmission can occur with most viral agents and most certainly with TB but not with group A streptococcus, pneumococcus, Mycoplasma, or Chlamydophila. a 45% decrease in respiratory disease rates was reported in the Navy studies. simple hand washing with soap and water has been shown to reduce the incidence of respiratory infections by 21% among young children 5 years of age. use of soap and alcohol-based hand rub preparations has also been shown to achieve an almost immediate reduction in culture- and PCR-detectable influenza virus on the hands of human volunteers (651) implementation of HW and HH measures within 15 to 30 min of patient or surface contact is particularly important, in order for these measures to have any beneficial effect in curtailing transmission (652). a systematic review of HH measures found that face masks may be beneficial in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in community settings. cloth masks have actually been found to increase the risk of ILI and influenza virus infection rates compared to face masks among health care workers in the first RCT conducted in Vietnam (716). the CDC recommends that susceptible personnel wear an N95 respirator upon entering a room with a patient known or suspected to be infected with TB (647, 675). the CDC recommends that they be used early, consistently, and correctly. five well-conducted studies of recruits have shown a direct association between respiratory disease rates and increased levels of crowding. military space guidelines recommending 72 ft2 of floor space per trainee are based on observational data reported earlier in the 20th century (677) at least four observational studies in the military have looked at the practice of cohorting in trainee settings. these studies suggest this measure reduced rates of illness during recruit training and supported spread of adenovirus-associated respiratory infections. comprehensive approach to respiratory disease control should be implemented. additional control measures should be implemented in closed, crowded settings. of greatest importance is the immediate reduction of transmission from acutely ill individuals. u.s. military has been engaged in respiratory disease prevention efforts for >100 years now. adenovirus infection

conduct comprehensive laboratory-based surveillance and research are of paramount importance to military public health officials. significant enhancements in respiratory disease surveillance and research have taken place in the united states, and worldwide, in the past 2 decades. the advent of electronic surveillance systems and molecular-based testing for a majority of respiratory pathogens facilitated and refined the conduct of these activities. the adenovirus vaccine story may be a cautionary tale. effective prevention programs, especially immunization programs, may be lost."}
