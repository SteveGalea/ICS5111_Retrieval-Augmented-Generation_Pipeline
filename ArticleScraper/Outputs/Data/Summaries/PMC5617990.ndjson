{"summary": "in the past few decades, there has been a rise in the outbreaks of zoonotic diseases which have an enormous socioeconomic impact worldwide. all foodborne zoonoses occured in a single country costs about $1.3 billion annually. more than 75% of diseases that affected humans have been transmitted from animals or animal products. the highest incidence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases in Egypt may be attributed to deficiency of suitable control mechanisms, inadequate infrastructure and lack of information on their significance and distribution. in this review, we will focus on the most important and prevalent emerging and re-emerging ZD in Egypt including the current situation, reservoirs, sources of human infection and control regimes. chickens, raw milk, milk products, diarrheic and normal camel calves and stool of diarrheic patients were isolated from 47.5% of chicken and 2.7% of human samples. chickens and humans isolates were genetically similar signifying the high possibilities of zoonotic transmission from animals to humans. Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is the major cause of human salmonellosis outbreaks in the united states and Europe [31,32] salmonella enteritidis was isolated from chickens and different animals in Egypt [33], surveillance in pigeons indicated the spread of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Braenderup and Lomita. 68% of salmonella enterica isolates showed multidrug resistance phenotypes. the disease is caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus bacterium of the genus Brucella. in animals, brucellosis causes economic losses because of abortions. there are limited data on the prevalence of brucellosis in animals and humans in Egypt. in 2016, the prevalence of animal and human brucellosis was 7% and 1.25%, respectively, at a district located in the Nile Delta with high livestock density. in another serosurvey in east of Egypt, 4.42% and 8.91% in private farms were found positive. E. coli strains from broiler flocks in Egypt were genetically similar to E. coli associated with human infection. enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), diffuse-adhering E. coli (DAEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli are associated with infantile diarrhea in Egyptian children. listeria spp. was detected in 47.5% of 200 poultry farm samples in 2013. isolation rates of L. monocytogenes from different localities in Egypt were 8% in beef burger, 4% in minced meat and 4% in luncheon meat. in humans, L. monocytogenes is considered the most common lethal complication in patients with liver cirrhosis associated with ascites. campylobacteriosis Campylobacteriosis is a zoonotic disease which has a worldwide public health impact. the disease is endemic in Egypt and is a major cause for pediatric diarrhea. the epidemiology in animals and humans has not been fully characterized. campylobacter spp. including C. jejuni and C. coli were isolated from 47.5% of chicken and 2.7% of human samples. chickens and humans isolates were genetically similar signifying the high possibilities of zoonotic transmission from animals to humans. salmonellosis Salmonellosis is a very common zoonotic infection. salmonella infection in poultry including commercial broilers in northern Egypt during 2014\u20132015 [35], in eastern Egypt during the period of December 2009 to May 2010 [37] surveillance in pigeons indicated the spread of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Braenderup and Lomita which also endanger the public health [39]. salmonella spp. was recovered from diarrheic neonatal calves [40] the disease is caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus bacterium of the genus Brucella. in animals, brucellosis causes economic losses because of abortions. in humans, infection can be long lasting and is accompanied by flu-like illness with or without neurological and genitourinary complications. the prevalence of brucellosis among sheep, goats and cattle flocks in 18 Egyptian governorates was 26.7%, 18.9% and 17.2%, respectively. in humans, up to 70 persons per 100,000 population were found positive to Brucella in 2002 and 2003. Listeriosis Listeriosis is one of the foodborne pathogens with high fatality rate. it is caused by Listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive bacterium. it can persist for long periods in the environment or as an asymptomatic infection in adult animals and birds. the disease is caused by Coxiella burnetii, a gram-negative bacterium that mostly affects ruminants. the bacterium causes abortion in sheep, goat and cattle and is excreted in infected animal feces, urine, milk, and birth products. the epidemiology of C. burnetii in africa is poorly understood. is Schistosomiasis was reported in more than 200 million people in 74 countries. nearly 800 million people are at risk of infection worldwide. schistosomiasis is one of the most endemic parasitic diseases in Egypt. the overall prevalence of schistosomiasis in. Egypt declined year by year to reach 10% in 1999, 5% in 2000, 3.5% in 2002, 1.2% in 2006 and 3\u201310% in 2010. this continuous decrease was due to the control of schistosomiasis by using praziquantel in mass chemo and due to snail control by using anti-bilharzial chemo. fascioliasis infected different animal species in Egypt including sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, horses, donkeys, camels and rabbits. the overall prevalence in Egypt is unknown because reports show wide variations in infection rates. since 1980, fascioliasis has been reported in most of the Egyptian governorates especially in the Nile Delta. more attention was given to cryptosporidiosis since it was determined to cause death in one acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient. the importance of Cryptosporidium as a public health problem began in 1993, when more than 400,000 residents in Milwaukee, WI, USA were affected by C. hominis due to the consumption of contaminated drinking water. ates with prevalence rates ranged between 3% and 50% or up to 91% in immunocompromised patients and diarrheic children. Giardia duodenalis is one of the most common intestinal protozoal parasites affecting humans worldwide. it also infects other mammals, including pets and livestock. asymptomatic Giardia infection can persist for 4 months with 4.5 episodes per child/year in rural areas in Egypt. toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is one of the most important human zoonotic protozoan parasites. in 1980s, seroprevalence of the parasite ranged between 16% and 59% in stray and domestic cats. in 2008 antibodies were reported in 57% of cats. recently, seroprevalence of T. gondii was up to 98%. infection with Schistosoma spp. results in skin rash or itching, flu-like illness and severe intestinal and urinary tract disorders. schistosomiasis is one of the most endemic parasitic diseases in Egypt. fascioliasis is caused by a liver fluke belonging to genus Fasciola (Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica) it was estimated that fascioliasis affects at least 2.4 million people in more than 70 countries. it causes gastrointestinal problems and chronic fascioliasis results in jaundice and inflammation of the liver. the overall prevalence in Egypt is unknown because reports show wide variations in infection rates. between 1959 and 2016, the prevalence of Fasciola spp. among different animal species in different localities in different localities in Egypt ranged between 0% and 59%. since 1980, fascioliasis has been reported in approximately all the Egyptian governorates especially in the Nile Delta. sporidia essentially entered veterinary medicine only in the early 1980s with reports of cryptosporidium-associated neonatal calf diarrhea [160] and established as a primary enteric pathogen [161] the importance of Cryptosporidium as a public health problem began in 1993 when more than 400,000 residents in Milwaukee, WI, USA were affected by C. hominis due to the consumption of contaminated drinking water. Giardiasis is caused by Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. intestinalis, G. lamblia) it is considered one of the most common intestinal protozoal parasites affecting humans worldwide. it also infects other mammals, including pets and livestock. toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is one of the most important human zoonotic protozoan parasites, infecting one third of the world\u2019s population. asymptomatic infection can persist for 4 months with 4.5 episodes per child/year in rural areas in Egypt. in 57% of cats, seroprevalence of T. gondii was up to 98%, indicating high environmental contamination with oocysts. in 10% to 62% of ruminants, including cattle, sheep and goat and in equines, including horses and donkey. in humans, there are limited data on prevalence of toxoplasma antibodies in women during pregnancy. swine influenza is not a major ZD, although serosurveillance indicated infections of humans in 1979\u20131980. swine influenza is not a major ZD, although serosurveillance indicated infections of humans in 1979\u20131980. in 2006, the Asian highly pathogenic (HP) AIV of subtype H5N1 was firstly detected in wild migratory birds in a northern Egyptian wetland. there are 3 human infections by H9N2 viruses reported to the WHO. rabies virus belongs to the genus Lyssavirus of the RNA family Rhabdoviridae. in 1970s, the virus was isolated from several rodents and wild mammals including foxes and cats. in 1990, an outbreak was reported to the OIE. in 1998\u20131999, there was a record for isolation of RABV from dogs in Egypt. rift valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic viral disease firstly reported among livestock in the early 1900s. the disease is caused by a RVF virus, genus Phlebovirus, a member of the RNA family Bunyaviridae. the virus infects mosquitoes, which act as a reservoir, while animals and humans are considered amplifying hosts. anti-RVFV antibodies were detected in pigs in 2008 [296], domestic and imported cattle and buffaloes in 2009 [87] and non-immunized dairy cattle from different localities in Egypt in 2013\u20132015 [297] in humans, in 1977, RVFV in Egypt caused huge outbreaks including 200,000 human infections and 600 deaths. in 1993, in southern Egypt, 600\u20131500 human infections associated with ocular disease, fever and headache were reported [279,307]. the virus is usually transmitted from dromedary camels via direct contact or consumption of milk or medicinal use of camel urine. the infection can be mild or fatal in those patients with immune system disorders or chronic diseases. crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne virus from the Bunyaviridae family. it causes severe hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. farm animals like sheep, goats, cattle, camels and ostriches can be infected without showing any clinical signs. the only known human infection with CCHFV in Egypt happened in 1981. a virologist died after mouth-pipetting a culture of a CCHFV isolate. the virus is transmitted by arthropod vectors and mosquitoes of the genus Culex are main reservoirs. more than 110 mosquito species and subspecies including Culex species were identified. the virus was firstly isolated from mosquitoes in early 1990s. in the period from 1999 to 2002, 15 (0.29%) out of 112,155 examined samples from mosquitoes and sand flies were positive for the virus. influenza influenza, swine influenza (SIV), bat influenza, equine influenza and avian influenza viruses (AIV) have up to 144 subtypes according to the variation/combination of the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. the infection in humans ranges from mild self-limiting respiratory-like illness to death. in humans, Egypt is the country with the highest recorded cases worldwide. the fatality rate in Egypt is lower than the global rate. a recent study has shown that the virus has not yet acquired the aerogenic transmissibility. the virus has a relatively long incubation period (according to the site of bite) each year, about 60,000 fatal human infections are recorded worldwide. the notifiable disease is now endemic in many regions throughout the country. in 2015, RABV was isolated from brain tissue of an adult female dog. the dog developed hypersalivation, paralysis, and hyperesthesia consistent with rabies symptoms. the virus was genetically similar to canine RABV circulating in Egypt. in the last 40 years, Egypt reported five large outbreaks. the largest epizootic was in 1977\u20131978, 1993\u20131994, 1997, 2000 and 2003. the primary introduction of RVFV into livestock in these outbreaks was mostly linked to importation of animals mainly camels from Africa. in 1993, 600\u20131500 human infections associated with ocular disease, fever and headache were reported. in 2008, RVFV antibodies were detected in 14% of veterinarians and their assistants, butchers and abattoir workers in pigs\u2019 abattoir. infection can be mild or fatal in those patients with immune system disorders or chronic diseases. from June 2014 to February 2016, 2541 sera, 2825 nasal swabs, 114 rectal swabs, 187 milk samples, and 26 urine samples were collected from camels in different sectors in Egypt. seroprevalence was 90% in imported camels and 61% in locally raised camels. both juveniles and adult camels were positive by 82% and 37% seropositivity. antibodies to CCHFV detected in 8.8% camels sera and in 23.1% sheep sera. no antibodies were detected in sera from equines (donkeys, horses and mules), pigs, cows, and buffaloes. only known human infection with CCHFV in Egypt happened in 1981. mosquitoes-birds-mosquitos' infection is the classical transmission cycle in nature. human infections occur through biting or dealing with contaminated blood or tissues. infection in birds is mostly subclinical, while humans exhibit mild illness to fatal West Nile encephalitis. in 1968, 14.6% of hospitalized febrile children were linked to WNV infection. 5 out of 133 patients suffering from aseptic meningitis or encephalitis possessed WNV antibodies. between 1984 and 1985, one out of 55 patients with non-specific fever and myalgia was positive for WNV. transboundary transmission of zoonotic agents from Egypt to Europe, Asia and America occurred via different pathways. RABV was reported in the us via falsified vaccination certificate of dogs [274], in Europe via corneal transplantation from an Egyptian donor [276] and in Asia, probably by dog transfer [272]. Approximately 100,000 Egyptians travel to Saudi Arabia every year. sustainable awareness, education and training are of great importance to reduce the burden of zoonoses among Egyptians. there is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of zoonotic diseases."}
