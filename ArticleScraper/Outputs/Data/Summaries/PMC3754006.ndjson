{"summary": "alphaviruses (family Togaviridae) are plus-stranded RNA viruses that infect vertebrate hosts and insect vectors. the genome of alphaviruses is approximately 11.5 kb long and contains two open reading frames. nsP2 is the sole proteolytic enzyme responsible for the processing of SFV (20, 21) nsP2 is the sole proteolytic enzyme responsible for the processing of P1234 of SFV (20, 21) nsP2 is the sole proteolytic enzyme responsible for the processing of P1234 of SFV (20, 21) phenotypes can be compensated for by second-site adaptive mutations in nsP4 (12, 14, 16) changes in P123 processing may also result in reduced cytotoxic properties of viral vectors (23), a reduced ability to suppress Jak/STAT signaling (24), and changes in neurovirulence (25). the 3/4 site is efficiently recognized in trans with a short sequence of approximately 6 amino acid residues preceding the scissile bond. we aimed to further elaborate the unifying molecular principles of substrate recognition to explain the sequential order of the proteolytic processing of the alphaviral ns polyprotein. we postulated that the recognition of each cleavage site represents a combination of specific sequence recognition and cleavage site presentation imposed by macromolecular assembly-dependent positioning. to highlight the importance of particular amino acid residues involved in P1234 processing, we first analyzed the region encompassing P6, P5, and P mutations in all three cleavage sites were genetically stable. mutants were unable to infect mosquito cells but efficiently infected different mammalian cells. these viruses were defective in suppression of interferon response. all cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. plasmids containing infectious cDNAs (icDNAs) of SFV4 were propagated by using SOY medium (Gibco) containing 0.05 mg/ml ampicillin and glucose to a final concentration of 0.4%. the resulting clones were designated P1234-1+2AAA and P1234-3AAA. the resulting clones were designated P1234-1+2AAA and P1234-3AAA. in vitro translation reactions were carried out by using the TNT-coupled. Western blot analyses were performed by using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against nsP4 and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. the signal was visualized by using the ECL immunoblot detection kit (GE Healthcare) plasmids were verified through sequencing and designated pSP6-SFV4-123. transcripts prepared with SP6 polymerase were used for transfection of BHK-21 cells via electroporation. primary virus stocks were collected following incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, titrated by using a plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. HS633T and L929 cells grown in the same manner were infected with an identical amount of virus. the cells were covered with GMEM containing 2% FCS and 0.9% Bacto agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. the plaques were cut out, transferred onto a BHK-21 monolayer on a 24-well tissue culture plate, and incubated in GMEM containing 2% FCS. the presence of the introduced mutations was verified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. the presence of the introduced mutations was verified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. two 35-mm plates of HS633T cells at 70% confluence were infected at an MOI of 20 at 37\u00b0C. after 1 h of incubation, inoculums were removed and cells were washed once with PBS and overlaid with growth medium. samples were obtained from the first plate by collecting 20% of the growth medium and replacing it with the same amount of fresh medium. HS633T and L929 cells were grown on coverslips and infected with SFV4 or mutant forms of SFV4 at an MOI of 20 at 37\u00b0C. at 8 h p.i., the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. B16-Blue cells (InvivoGen) were grown in RPMI medium (PAA) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 100 g/ml Normocin. all cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. mutations in the 3/4 site of the polyprotein were blocked by the mutation of P2 Gly residues to Ile. a P4 ArgGlu mutation in the 3/4 site was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis, and the corresponding clone was designated P1234-34RE. resulting clones were designated P1234-1+2AAA and P1234-3AAA. translation was stopped by adding cycloheximide at a final concentration of 1 mM. incubation was subsequently continued for 1 h under the same conditions. the mixture was visualized by using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare) pSFV4-123 was generated by replacing a fragment of pSP6-SFV4 with the corresponding sequence of P1234. to obtain pSFV4-123-E452A, the codon corresponding to Glu residue 452 in nsP4 was replaced with the codon for Ala. secondary stocks of parental SFV4 and mutated viruses were obtained as follows. cells grown in 100-mm dishes were infected with primary viral stocks at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and then incubated for 1 h. after 24 to 48 h of incubation, the medium was collected and filtered. viral titers were determined by using a plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. plaques were cut out, transferred onto a BHK-21 monolayer on a 24-well tissue culture plate, and incubated in GMEM containing 2% FCS. the cells were starved in methionine-free medium for 30 min and then labeled with 4.5 Ci [35S]methionine for 15 min. two 35-mm plates of HS633T cells at 70% confluence were infected at an MOI of 20 at 37\u00b0C. after 1 h of incubation, inoculums were removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and overlaid with growth medium. FN-2 standard employed for normalization of the results was obtained from PBL Biomedical Laboratories. the same assay was performed by using mouse L929 cells, except that these cells were infected at an MOI of 5. a UV-inactivated SFV4 sample derived from BHK-21 cells (IFN-/-negative) was used as a negative control. no variation in P2 Gly residues is tolerated at any cleavage site (20) it has been demonstrated that the amino acid residues at positions P4, P3 and P1 tolerate little variation. the requirements for the P5 position are much less strict (11) polyproteins were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. the reactions were stopped by adding cycloheximide. the autoprocessing products of the polyproteins were separated via SDS-PAGE and visualized with a Typhoon imager. P12CA34 indicates the polyprotein containing the C478A mutation in the active center of the nsP2 protease, preventing the cleavage of the polyprotein. cleavage may take place either in cis or in trans. mutant polyprotein found to be indistinguishable from that of P1234-4A3. defect in 3/4 site processing caused by P4 Ala resulted in increased amounts of unprocessed polyproteins. nsP4 is an unstable protein (32) and is therefore difficult to detect via autoradiography. alanines at the P6-P4 positions of any single cleavage site had little or no effect on the infectivity of the corresponding RNA genome. all of the mutant viruses replicated to a high titer and were similar to the parental virus. the effect could be attributed either to minor changes that were undetectable in the cell-free system. -2AAA, SFV4-3AAA, SFV4-1+2AAA, and SFV4-3AAA were collected at 4, 6, 8, 10 12, 18, and 24 h p.i. the viral titer in the aliquots was analyzed via plaque titration on BHK-21 cells. changes in a single cleavage site can reduce the speed of its processing but unlikely alter the overall processing pattern. nsP3 and nsP4 regions for some of the isolates but not all. if any of the detected nonconserved changes affected the growth of this rescued virus, their effects were too small to be detected by using the approaches described above. however, the decrease in infectivity revealed for the transcripts of SFV4-3AAA strongly indicated the possibility of the appearance of the compensatory changes in the viral progeny. the ICA performed by using transcripts from this construct revealed that the Q706R mutation resulted in a >200-fold increase of RNA infectivity. the major difference between these viruses is the presence of P4 Ala in the 3/4 site in SFV4-3AAA. the genome of the SFV4-RE site exhibited an initial infectivity that was only 2-fold lower than that of the genome of wt SFV4. this is similar to SFV4-3AAA and to viruses containing ArgThr or ArgHis changes in the P4 position of the 3/4 site (11). in approximately 50% of the rescued viruses, a pseudoreversion of Glu to Lys occurred. in approximately 50% of the rescued viruses, a pseudore the levels of P123 and P12 were increased, while that of P34 was considerably reduced. however, the reduced level of P34 was rather unexpected. the effect may be that after processing has been slowed down, the switch to the late cleavage pattern did not occur. remarkably diminished levels of all fully processed ns proteins were observed for P1234-3AAA. this was especially evident for nsP3 and nsP4 and was correlated with the increase in the level of unprocessed P34. both the P5 Ala in the 1/2 site and the P4 Ala in the 3/4 site are responsible for the observed processing defects. the effect of the Q706L mutation in nsP2 was analyzed in the context of P1234-34RE. first, the P4 Glu residue markedly reduced the processing of the 3/4 site but did not have any apparent effect on the processing of the other sites. the processing efficiency of the 3/4 site was slightly increased by introducing the Q706L mutation. the major difference in these mutants compared to their wt counterpart was the increased stability of the P123 and P12 processing intermediates. both isolates showed a more wt-like phenotype than did SFV4-1+2AAA, most likely due to the presence of the Q706R mutation in nsP2. the viruses used in the assays are indicated at the top of each panel. the origins of the samples are shown below. the numbers directly above each lane denote the combination of antibodies against SFV ns proteins used for immunoprecipitation. to investigate this possibility, we used SFV4-3AAA viruses to infect different cell types. first, it was found that these mutants were not able to productively infect cells of mosquito origin, C6/36. this finding is in line with the observation that many mutations with a mild or no effect on vertebrate cells seriously inhibit the replication of alphaviruses in cells of their invertebrate vectors. the SFV4-3AAA and SFV4-23 isolates were able to infect 30 to 40% of the HS633T cells. the relative infectivity of the mutant viruses in HS633T cells was much lower than that of wt SFV4. however, the immunofluorescence analysis revealed that in those HS633T cells where the mutant viruses managed to establish an infection, large nsP3- and dsRNA-containing vesi in nsP4, SFV4-123-E452A increased the infectivity of the in vitro transcripts of the construct, now designated SFV4-123-E452A, to a level of 100 PFU/g RNA. a common mutation located within nsP1 (P336T) was indeed identified in plaque-purified isolates of both of these viruses. similar effects were detected in infected HS633T cells. infection of HS633T cells by viruses with mutations in cleavage sites induces a type I interferon response that restricts the spread and multiplication of mutant viruses. in contrast, for SFV4-123-E452A, a steady decline of virus titers was observed throughout the experiment. HS633T cells were infected at an MOI of 20, and after 1 h, cells were washed once with PBS and covered with growth medium. the growth medium was collected at the indicated time points and replaced with fresh medium (A and B), or an aliquot of 20% of the growth medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium (C). the release of IFN-/ from SFV4-infected cells was barely detectable at 8 h p.i. this is consistent with the ability of wt alphaviruses to efficiently suppress the type I IFN response (36, 37) over the next 16 h, the production of type I IFN by cells infected with SFV4-3AAA isolates continued to increase. wt SFV4-infected cells were primed by small amounts of IFN-/. a similar behavior should be expected for SFV4-23, which consistently produced at least 10 times more infectious virions than any other mutant. y was not removed, secondary infection took place under higher-MOI conditions and led to a more rapid shutdown of IFN production in cells infected by viral progeny. if only a single type of experimental setup is used, the resultant data should be interpreted carefully. we carried out the same experiment using mouse L929 cells. polyproteins were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. the reactions were stopped by adding cycloheximide, and the autoprocessing products of the polyproteins were separated via SDS-PAGE and visualized with a Typhoon imager. in P1234-4A3 and P1234-6A3, all of the amino acid residues in the P6-P4 region of the 3/4 site are replaced with Ala residues. the polyprotein containing the C478A mutation in the active center of the nsP2 protease prevents the cleavage of the polyprotein. the introduction of the P6 Ala residue had no detectable effect on 3/4 site processing. this result was confirmed directly by using the P1234-3AAA substrate. the processing of this mutant polyprotein was found to be indistinguishable from that of P1234-4A3. mutations on virus-infected cells, triple mutations of each cleavage site were introduced into an SFV4 icDNA clone. alanines at the P6-P4 positions of any single cleavage site had little or no effect on the infectivity of the corresponding RNA genome. alanines at the P6-P4 positions of any single cleavage site had little or no effect on the infectivity of the corresponding RNA genome BHK-21 cells were infected with SFV4, SFV4-1AAA, SFV4-2AAA, SFV4-3AAA, and SFV4-3AAA at an MOI of 5. changes in a single cleavage site can reduce the speed of its processing but would unlikely alter the overall processing pattern. sequence analysis of the genomes of several plaque-purified isolates of SFV4-1+2AAA revealed several second-site mutations in regions encoding nsP4 and nsP2. no universal second-site mutation was revealed. if any of the detected nonconserved changes affected the growth of this rescued virus remains unknown. the mutation in nsP2 was detected only in the case of SFV4-3AAA and not for SFV4-1+2AAA. the major difference between these viruses is the presence of an unfavorable P4 Ala residue into the 3/4 site. the genome of the SFV4-RE site exhibited an initial infectivity that was only 2-fold lower than that of the genome of wt SFV4. despite the expected severe defect due to amino acid charge reversal, we constructed another recombinant virus, SFV4-34RE. polyprotein processing in a cell-free system was analyzed as described above. compared to wt P1234, the levels of fully processed nsP1 and nsP2 were considerably reduced in the case of P1234-1+2AAA. the levels of fully processed nsP1 and nsP2 were significantly reduced. remarkably diminished levels of all fully processed ns proteins were observed for P1234-3AAA. both the P5 Ala in the 1/2 site and the P4 Ala in the 3/4 site are responsible for the observed processing defects. processing of polyproteins with multiple defects revealed a more complex phenotype. processing pattern of the in vitro-translated polyprotein became nearly identical to that of wt P1234. the effect of the Q706L mutation in nsP2 was analyzed in the context of P1234-34RE. the processing efficiency of the 3/4 site of P1234-34RE was slightly increased by introducing the Q706L mutation. all of the individual nsPs were detected in the pulsed samples. unprocessed precursors were almost completely absent after a 1-h chase. the dissimilar second-site mutations did not affect polyprotein processing. s were infected with wt SFV4 and two independently plaque-purified isolates of SFV4-1+2AAA and SFV4-3AAA. the proteins were extracted from the infected cells, denatured with SDS, and analyzed via immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. the origins of the samples are shown below. mutants of equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (34) were not able to infect cells of mosquito origin, C6/36. this finding is in line with the observation that many mutations with a mild or no effect on vertebrate cells seriously inhibit the replication of alphaviruses in cells of their invertebrate vectors. however, in many of the tested cell lines, the propagation of these mutant viruses was severely restricted. SFV4-3AAA and SFV4-23 isolates were able to infect only 95% of the HS633T cells. the relative infectivity of the mutant viruses in HS633T cells was much lower than that of wt SFV4. however, the relative infectivity of the mutant viruses in HS633T cells was much lower than that of wt SFV4. rescued SFV4-123 failed to reach titers higher than 1 103 PFU/ml. this mutation increased the infectivity of the in vitro transcripts of the construct. both SFV4-123 and SFV4-123-E452A also required additional second-site mutations to replicate to the indicated levels. HS633T cells grown on coverslips and infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 20 were fixed at 8 h p.i. cells were permeabilized and costained with an nsP3 polyclonal antibody and then incubated with an nsP3 polyclonal antibody. infection of HS633T cells by viruses with mutations in cleavage sites induces a type I interferon response. the growth curves for the remainder of the mutants were located between two described extremes but were more similar to that of SFV4. however, the mutants did not reach high titers, indicating that their spread in the HS633T cell culture was restricted. release of IFN-/ by SFV4-123-E452A-infected cells reached much higher levels at this and later times of infection. however, the release of IFN-/ from SFV4-infected cells reached much higher levels at this and later times of infection. in this experiment, there were at least 2.5-fold more wt SFV4-infected cells than cells infected with any mutant virus. SFV4-123-E452A is capable of effectively shutting down IFN-/ production in infected cells. at 8 h p.i., only very small amounts of IFN-/ were consistently detected. if this assumption is correct, a similar behavior should be expected for SFV4-23. the same trend was observed in the case of wt SFV4. if only a single type of experimental setup is used, the resultant data should be interpreted carefully. virus-induced organelles predispose to establishment of a \u201cclosed system\u201d with respect to viral enzymes acting on their substrates. in such a case, even if error-prone genome replication leads to amino acid substitutions in the protease domain, it can be envisioned that a viral protease may still find an intended scissile bond within a polyprotein. cleavage peptide is a macromolecular assembly-guided event. the structure of the replication complex should alleviate the deleterious effects of the insufficient affinity of the cleavage site sequences. the introduction of AAA mutations in individual cleavage sites did not compromise the infectivity of the corresponding viral RNA. cleavage sites in different alphaviruses display a different susceptibility to being cleaved when presented as short sequences encompassing regions around a scissile bond. alanine substitution was most profound for the 3/4 site, suggesting that the sequence-dependent component of substrate recognition is more important. mutational analysis also revealed cross talk between 1/2 and 3/4 site processing. intermolecular mode of cleavage dominates later in infection and is more dependent on the cleavage sequence and the progress of nsP2 to maturity (controlled mostly by 1/2 cleavage) viruses with modified cleavage sites and accompanying compensatory mutations exhibited reduced ability to suppress interferon production and/or signaling. nsP2s of the old world alphaviruses have been shown to induce the degradation of Rpb1. however, this degradation is evidently not mediated by the proteolytic activity of nsP2 (60) the described approach shows the potential for creating viruses with a restricted phenotype for the purpose of vaccine development. despite the successive propagation of SFV4-3AAA virus variants, their ability to produce infectious virions remained lower than that of the wt virus. we believe that such knowledge may become important for designing drugs and vaccines targeting alphaviruses."}
