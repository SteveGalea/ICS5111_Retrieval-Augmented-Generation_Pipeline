{"summary": "live and killed vaccines are commonly used to induce local immunity. live vaccines induce local and cell-mediated immunity and provide a broader protective response than killed vaccines. the duration of immunity achieved following live vaccine administration depends on the age and type of bird. ND infection may be absent or may involve depression, inappetence, respiratory signs (nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing), reduced egg production and egg quality, and neurological signs. lentogenic strains are of low pathogenicity causing mild respiratory or enteric infections, followed by mesogenic strains. velogenic isolates are highly pathogenic often causing neurological signs and mortality. a typical commercial vaccination schedule consisting of a combination of serially administered, live attenuated viral respiratory disease vaccines affects the development and longevity of immunity and protection against homologous challenge. a commercial IBV vaccine MILDVAC-GA-98\u00ae (Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ, USA) was used for both vaccination and challenge and was reconstituted following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. pathogenic ILTV Georgia broiler strain 63140 was propagated in chicken kidney cells. the vaccine was prepared following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. chicks were placed on fresh pine shavings in colony houses and pens. all ILTV-challenged birds received the 63140 pathogenic strain at a dose of 1 103.5 TCID50 per bird in 100 L intranasally. birds were observed at 5 dpc for respiratory signs, as previously described. ciliostasis test was performed on harvested tracheas collected in cell culture media at 37 \u00b0C. for each trachea, five tracheal rings measuring approximately 1 mm thick were cut. for each trachea, five tracheal rings measuring approximately 1 mm thick were cut. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using a 5 MagMAX-96 Viral Isolation Kit. each 25-L reaction mixture contained 12.5 L of 2 RT-PCR buffer, 10 M of each primer, 4 M of probe, 1 L of 25 RT-PCR enzyme mix. primers and probe for the NDV qRT-PCR were previously described [22]. primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, CA, USA) qRT-PCR components and thermocycler parameters were previously described. viral gene in ILTV and a fragment of the chicken alpha 2-collagen gene were detected using a commercial IgG ELISA IBV antibody test kit. tears were serially diluted two-fold in PBS and incubated in duplicate in wells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. final antibody detection steps were completed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. data were analyzed using Prism v.6.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) for viral load data, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunn\u2019s posttest was used to compare treatment groups within each collection period. chicks were vaccinated with the manufacturers recommended dose in 100 L via the oculonasal route. a control group was not vaccinated. birds were observed at 5 dpc for respiratory signs, as previously described. the choanal cleft (IBV- and NDV-challenged and control birds at 3 and 5 dpc) or trachea (ILTV-challenged and control birds at 3 and 5 dpc) was swabbed for virus detection, and swabs were stored in PBS. tracheal rings measuring approximately 1 mm thick were cut and represented the proximal, middle, and distal portions. the maximum possible score for each trachea is 20. each trachea was scored by three individuals, and a score 50 was considered protected. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using a 5 MagMAX-96 Viral Isolation Kit. each 25-L reaction mixture contained 12.5 L of 2 RT-PCR buffer, 10 M of each primer, 4 M of probe, 1 L of 25 RT-PCR enzyme mix, and 5 L of viral RNA. qPCR duplex real-time PCR assay amplifies a fragment of the UL44 viral gene in ILTV and a fragment of the chicken alpha 2-collagen gene was performed. qPCR duplex real-time PCR assay that amplifies a fragment of the UL44 viral gene in ILTV and a fragment of the chicken alpha 2-collagen gene was performed. serum samples were diluted 1:500, and the procedure was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. tears were serially diluted two-fold in PBS and incubated in duplicate in wells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. final antibody detection steps were completed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. vaccinated/challenged birds had significantly lower RNA loads compared to positive controls. no IBV RNA was detected at all collection times except in the cecal tonsils at 20 and 24 WOA and in the choanal cleft at 20 WOA. 1.3 c 22.7 0.6 c 21.6 1.1 b 24 40.0 0.0 ab 34.4 1.0 a 40.0 0.0 a 40.0 0.0 a + 41.1 0.5 a 39.0 0.7 b 40.0 0.0 a + 41.1 0.5 a 39.0 0.7 b 40.0 0.0 a 30.7 3.3 b + + 39.6 0.4 b

ILTV-specific IgG titers in serum collected 5 days post-challenge with ILTV strain 63140 for different groups of birds challenged at 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 WOA. letters indicate significant differences between vaccine and challenge groups for each week (p 0.05) tracheal and cloacal swabs collected at the point of lay and 19 weeks of age in hens that had been virus-negative for several weeks following recovery from inoculation at one day of age. a study by Hughes, et al. [29] demonstrated intermittent shedding in the trachea from ILTV-immunized chickens between 7 and 14 weeks post-vaccination. few experimental studies of sequential virus infections have been published. IBV has been isolated from the cecal tonsils at 14 weeks post-infection. RNA was also detected in non-challenged negative control HG at 24 WOA. it is not clear why we detected IBV RNA in samples from the HG. significant changes in IgG serum titer were not detected until 10 days post-inoculation. but IgA titer was significantly higher between 6 and 16 days after primary exposure to IBV. in this study, IBV-specific IgA titers measured in tears at 5 dpc did not reveal consistent trends. lentogenic NDV only causes mild respiratory or enteric infection. only a few birds showed mild clinical signs at 24 and 28 WOA. lack of ciliostasis observed in NDV B1-infected positive controls contrasts with previous reports. titers in non-vaccinated/challenged birds were not significantly increased. this observation is not surprising given that NDV-specific antibodies are not detected in the serum until 6\u201310 days after exposure. this may suggest a waning of the local immunity against ILTV. only some strains of ILTV caused ciliostasis and did not correlate with virulence. authors showed that ciliostasis rarely occurred before 6 days, and sometimes even 9 days, after inoculation. ciliostasis in ILTV-infected tracheal organ cultures at 7\u20138 days post-infection."}
