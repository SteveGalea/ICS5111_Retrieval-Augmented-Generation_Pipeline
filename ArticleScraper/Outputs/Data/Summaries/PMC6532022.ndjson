{"summary": "innate immune response is triggered through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) innate immune responses include induction of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and subsequent expression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) IFITM genes were first identified in interferon-treated TG98 neuroblastoma cells via cDNA screening with their transcripts named as 9-27, 1-8D, and 1-8U. to date, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10 have been found in humans and their gene loci are located on chromosome 11. three topological models for IFITM proteins have been proposed. the first model represents the IFITM proteins as transmembrane molecules. the most predominant models have an intracellular NTD and extracellular CTD. interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins topology is key to understanding how IFITM proteins can suppress virus infection by regulating membrane curvatures. there are three ideas for the topology of the IFITM proteins: first, both NTD and CTD localize extracellularly; second, both NTD and CTD of IFTIM3 are located in the cytoplasm. IFITM proteins are associated with the transduction efficiency of lentiviral vector. human and pig IFITM proteins partially limited the transduction of VSV-GFIV and GP64-FIV, thereby limiting the transfer of genes based on lentiviral vectors to airway epithelial cells. FITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10 are located on chromosome 7 and IFITM7 on chromosome 16. IFITM6 is located close to IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5 in mice. IFITMs contain five domains, which consist of N-terminal domain (NTD), intramembrane domain (IMD), a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), transmembrane domain (TMD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) the CD225 domain is conserved in more than 300 proteins of the CD225/pfam 04505 family. the IFITM family of vertebrates can be divided into three parts in phylogeny. the IFITMs in clade I (IFITM1/2/3/6/7) are associated with immunity-related IFITM (IR-IFITM), IFITM5 and IFITM10 sub-families. IFN-inducible IFITM proteins contain conserved cysteine residues which join the CIL and the putative membrane-interacting domains. non-ubiquitinated and S-palmitoylated IFITM3 is intracellular in nature and manifests potent antiviral activities. IFITMs restrict virus replication by regulating the viral protein expression and reducing the infectivity of nascent viruses. at present, no clear consensus has been reached on the integrated antiviral mechanism of IFITMs. IFITMs may restrict viral entry by inhibiting fusion with plasma membrane and endosomal or lysosomal membranes. IFITM proteins are involved in the enzymatic activity of cathepsin L (Huang et al., 2011), which is essential for fusion of some enveloped viruses with endosomes of host cells. it has been revealed that IFITMs overexpression changes the physical properties of cellular membranes and inhibits the fusion of pore formation. one theory is that IFITM3 interacts with vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and disrupts its interaction with the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) that controls the cholesterol content of endosomal membranes. the IFITM2 and IFITM3 may reduce the infectivity of viruses in two ways: regulating virus-endosome fusion rates and accelerating the trafficking of virus-endosome to lysosomes. IFITM3 blocks viral fusion by accumulating in the endosomes containing IAV. IFITM suppresses HIV-1 protein synthesis by excluding viral mRNA transcripts from polysomes. a vital endocytic signal that can guide the endocytosis of IFITM3 has been identified. IFITM3 restricts the entry of enveloped viruses by preventing the hemifusion of viral particles with either plasma or endosomal membranes. some non-enveloped viruses, such as reovirus, can be restricted by IFITM3 through regulation of late endosome functions during cell entry. overexpression of IFITM proteins enlarges the acidified compartments. these proteins interfere with endosomal trafficking or fusion of vesicles carrying viral components. down-regulation of IFITM proteins have no effect on acidified compartments size or restriction efficiency. IFITM proteins suppress HIV-1 protein synthesis by excluding viral mRNA transcripts from polysomes. the spectrum of IFITM-restricted Viruses suppress virus pathogenesis. RNA Virus Orthomyxoviridae Depleting these IFITM proteins by small RNA interference enhances the replication of IAV. the restriction by IFITM proteins occurs at the early replication of IAV, and IFITM3 has a more pronounced effect than IFITM1 and IFITM2. nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the coding region of the IFITM3 gene can alter the antiviral response to IAV infection. individuals with SNP rs12252-C/C homozygotes show more severe symptoms and higher mortality than heterozygotes following IAV infection. IFITM1 and IFTM3 exert a more effective inhibition than IFITM1. overexpression of IFITM3 is able to prevent cytopathicity mediated by ZIKV. filoviruses are more sensitive to IFITM1 and murine IFITM5 and IFITM6. SARS-CoV S protein-mediated entry is also restricted by IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3. mutations within residues and structural motifs of IFITMs modulate the entry of coronaviruses. IFITM2 and IFITM3 interact with Env, impair its processing and restrict virus infection. IFITMs restrict HIV-1 infection and replication through inhibiting viral entry and viral gene expression. IFITM3 can inhibit VSV glycoprotein-mediated pseudovirus entry and primary transcription of VSV genome. IFITM2 and IFITM3 impede viral membrane fusion with endosomes to restrict RVFV infection. none of the IFITMs restricts the infection of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) IFITM3 targets reoviruses at the level of endosomal penetration. the fish IFITM1 isolated from flounder Paralichthys olivaceus blocks Rana grylio virus replication at the viral entry stage. however, overexpression of IFITM1 and IFITM3 is unable to inhibit the infection of human papillomavirus (HPV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and adenovirus type 5 ( RNA Virus Orthomyxoviridae The antiviral activity of IFITMs (IFITM1, IFITM2) against IAV is observed in a RNA interference screen for host factors. the restriction by IFITM proteins occurs at the early replication of IAV, and IFITM3 has a more pronounced effect than IFITM1 and IFITM2. otide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the coding region of the IFITM3 gene can alter the antiviral response to IAV infection. individuals with SNP rs12252-C/C homozygotes show more severe symptoms and higher mortality than heterozygotes following IAV infection.

IFITM2 and IFITM3 interact with Env, impair its processing and restrict virus infection. HIV-1 requires engagement of its Env with primary receptor CD4 and a chemokine receptor CCR5 to enter the target cells. IFITM2 and IFITM3 impede viral membrane fusion with endosomes to restrict RVFV infection. none of the IFITMs restricts the infection of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. IFITM3 targets reoviruses at the level of endosomal penetration. depleting these IFITM proteins by small RNA interference enhances the replication of IAV, while overexpression of them reduces the virus replication. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the coding region of the IFITM3 gene can alter the antiviral response to IAV infection. individuals with SNP rs12252-C homozygotes show more severe symptoms and higher mortality than heterozygotes following IAV infection. Knockout of IFITM3 in mice increased mortality of the animals. replication of ZIKV can be inhibited by both IFITM1 and IFTM3. overexpression of IFITM3 is able to prevent cytopathicity mediated by ZIKV. IFITMs and IFNs can inhibit virus replication by entry restriction. filoviruses are more sensitive to IFITM1 and murine IFITM5 and IFITM6. SARS-CoV S protein-mediated entry is also restricted by IFITM1 and IFITM3. 1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 colocalize with HIV-1 Gag and Env proteins. they incorporate into nascent virions during assembly in virus-producing cells. this reduces the viral infectivity and inhibits virus fusion and spread.
