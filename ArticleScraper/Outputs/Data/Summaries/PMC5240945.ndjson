{"summary": "sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a normal metabolite produced following the phosphorylation of sphingosine by the sphingosine kinases (SKs) which can play an important role in cell signalling and inflammation. a role for SK1 during viral infections is emerging, as we have recently reviewed. SK1 has been shown to prolong survival of virus-infected cells [12], and viral protein synthesis [14]. a reduction in SK1 affects the ability of DENV to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro [17]. a reduction in SK1 affects the ability of DENV to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro. we compared virus replication and immune responses following ic injection of DENV into WT and SK1-/- mice. our data define novel ISG and T-cell responses. SK1 is not a key regulator of these processes in the brain. ic injection with 800 pfu of DENV-2 MON601 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a volume of 10 l. animals were visually monitored twice daily for signs of neurological disease. any sign of neurological disease or loss of more than 10% of body weight represented a termination point. animals were sacrificed immediately by isoflurane anaesthetic inhalation. real-time qRT-PCR was performed using Rotor-Gene 3000 real-time PCR system (Corbett research, Australia) one cycle of 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 59\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 60 seconds followed by melt curve analysis. RT-PCR quantitation was determined by the Ct method [30] for all other genes. SK1 and SK2 activities were selectively measured by 32P transfer from [32P] ATP to D-erythro-sphingosine under conditions of Triton X-100 for SK1 activity. SK2 activities were normalised against total protein content, as previously described. lipids were resuspended in 275 l methanol/70 mM K2HPO4 (9:1) with 1 mM EDTA. a derivatization mixture of 10 mg o-phthalaldehyde, 200 l ethanol, 10 l -mercaptoethanol and 10 ml of a 3% boric acid solution was prepared. m thickness, stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined under brightfield microscopy (BX50, Olympus) Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism software version 6.07 was carried out using GraphPad Prism software version 6.07. DENV-infected SK1-/- mice show a significantly higher mortality at 7 dpi. 7 out of 17 WT mice (41%) and 7 out of 13 SK1-/- mice (54%) were sacrificed due to either excessive body weight loss and/or appearance of signs of DENV-induced neurovirulence. statistical analysis of survival curves was determined by long-rank test. * = p 0.05, ** = p 0.005. summary of body weight loss and signs of DENV-induced neurovirulence. DENV RNA levels were significantly higher at day 7\u20138 than at 9\u201314 dpi in both WT and SK1-/- mice. the sacrifice of mice at 7\u20138 dpi was due to symptomatic presentation and ethical termination. those sacrificed at 9\u201314 dpi showed body weight loss but lacked neurological symptoms. RNA was isolated from infected mice brain tissues at 3 dpi. representing 7 (n = 7), 8 (n = 5), 9 (n = 4) or 14 (n = 1) dpi for WT and 7 (n = 7), 8 (n = 3), 9 (n = 2) or 14 (n = 1) dpi for SK1-/- mice. n = 5 WT and n = 3 SK1-/- at 9/14 dpi. data represent average PCR values from individual mice and normalized against GAPDH by Ct method. DENV-2 infection induces IFN- and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) but this is not different in WT and SK1-/- mice. results show increased IFN- mRNA, late in the course of infection at 6 dpi. all the ISGs analysed were rapidly and significantly induced. IFN- and ISGs (viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7 and CXCL10) mRNA levels were induced following DENV-infection. at end stage disease, IFN- mRNA levels tended to be increased (p = 0.224 WT; 0.086 SK1-/-), while viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7 and CXCL10 were all significantly and highly induced by DENV-infection. n = 11 WT and n = 10 SK1-/- DENV-infected, n = 7 WT mock and n = 4 SK1-/- mock-infected mice. n = 7 WT mock and n = 4 SK1-/- mock-infected mice. n = 5 WT and n = 3 SK1-/- at 9/14 dpi. deNV-2 infection induces CD8+ but not CD4+ T-cell infiltration. qRT-PCR showed a cellular infiltrate at 6 dpi in DENV. the levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNA were compared by qRT-PCR in WT and SK1-/- mice at 3 dpi and end stage disease. results again demonstrate a lack of increase in CD4 mRNA levels following DENV-infection of WT or SK1-/- mice at either time point pi. symptomatic DENV-infection with body weight loss and neurological signs is positively associated with the level of DENV RNA in the brain with a lower level of DENV RNA in the brains of asymptomatic mice. this suggests an association of viperin with symptomatic DENV-infection in the brain, and this remains to be investigated further. we chose to analyse the mRNA level of selected important type I IFN driven ISGs. viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7 and CXCL10 persisted until end stage disease. at 6 dpi and end stage disease the level of IFN- mRNA tended to be increased. the induction of ISGs is evident prior to the presence of symptomatic infection but was not significantly different between SK1-/- mice. this contrasts to previous studies where embryonic fibroblasts from SK1-/- mice or cells treated with an SK1 inhibitor (SK1-I) showed reduced DENV-induction of ISGs such as viperin, IFIT1 and CXCL10 [17]. studies also showed expression of ISGs vary between the different cell types within the brain itself. basal and inducible levels of OAS were lower in neurons than microglia in response to MHV infection [53, 54] fected EC [16] and inhibition late in infection in a number of cell types in vitro [15]. SK2 mRNA or activity or S1P levels in the brain were not different following DENV-infection of WT and SK1-/- mice. one would expect to see an immune cell infiltrate to the site of infection. CXCL10 has been implicated in T-cell migration into the brain in WNV and SFV infections [63, 66] and S1P is an important regulator of T-cell migration from lymph nodes in the periphery. the induction of CXCL10 mRNA at 3 dpi and prior to the onset of T-cell infiltration at 6 dpi further supports this association. mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment on a 12 hours cycle of light and darkness with ad libitum access to food and water. all mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment on a 12 hours cycle of light and darkness. brain tissues were harvested at sacrifice and divided into two parts. the ipsilateral section was resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Ambion Life Technologies) the contralateral section was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for SK activity assay and S1P quantification or fixed for histological analysis. DNA copy numbers from 15 pg/l to 0.015 pg/l were analysed in real-time PCR. RT-PCR quantitation was determined by the Ct method [30] for all other genes. SK1 and SK2 activities were selectively measured by 32P transfer from [32P] ATP to D-erythro-sphingosine under conditions of Triton X-100 for SK1 activity and 1 M KCl for SK2 activity. sphingosine kinase activity was normalised against total protein content. the upper aqueous/methanol phase was collected and acid extraction was performed with 40 l conc. HCl and 300 l chloroform. the lipids were resuspended in 275 l methanol/70 mM K2HPO4 (9:1) with 1 mM EDTA by sonication in a bath sonicator for 30 sec. results DENV-2 -infection induces neurological symptoms and weight loss in WT and SK1-/- mice. mice were challenged by ic injection with 800 pfu/mouse DENV-2. mice did not demonstrate any loss in body weight or neurological symptoms. out of 17 WT mice (41%) and 7 out of 13 SK1-/- mice (54%) were sacrificed due to either excessive body weight loss and/or signs of DENV-induced neurovirulence. this is reflected by an apparent higher survival rate of WT compared to SK1-/- mice at 7 and 8 dpi. qRT-PCR analysis showed increasing DENV RNA level with time. 8 WT or SK1-/- mice were injected ic with DENV-2 and brain tissues harvested at 3 dpi. we have indicated the 9\u201314 dpi animals in Figs 4\u20137 as half-filled symbols. but excluded these animals from our statistical analysis. DENV-2 RNA levels increase WT and SK1-/- mice following ic deNV infection. each symbol represents an individual mouse sample. data represent average PCR values from individual mice. n = 12 WT and n = 10 SK1-/- DENV-infected. WT and SK1-/- mice were ic infected with DENV. brain tissue harvested at 3 dpi and end stage disease. RNA was isolated from infected mice brain tissues. results show increased IFN- mRNA, late in the course of infection at 6 dpi. all the ISGs analysed were rapidly and significantly induced, as early as 1 dpi, for viperin and IRF7 or 3 dpi. SGs viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7 and CXCL10 were all significantly and highly induced by DENV-infection. data suggest that ISGs are induced early during DENV infection in the mouse brain, prior to the detectable induction of IFN-, with the induction of ISGs persisting until end stage disease. lack of SK1 however, has no effect on this response. n = 11 WT and n = 10 SK1-/- DENV-infected, n = 7 WT mock and n = 4 SK1-/- mock-infected mice. n = 5 WT and n = 3 SK1-/- at 9/14 dpi. CD4+ T-cell infiltration in brain induced by histological H&E staining. mRNA for the T-lymphocyte markers, CD4 and CD8 by qRT-PCR. results show no change in CD4 but a marked and significant increase in CD8 by day 6 pi. levels of CD8 mRNA were significantly higher in DENV-infected WT and SK1-/- mice compared to their mock-infected controls at end stage disease. but once again there was no significant difference in CD8 mRNA between DENV-infected mice and SK1-/- mice. both DENV-infected WT mice and SK1-/- mice started to lose body weight at 6 days post infection (dpi) analysis of survival demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in DENV-infected compared to mock-infected mice. at this time point, 7 out of 17 WT mice (41%) and 7 out of 13 SK1-/- mice (54%) were sacrificed. do not show neurological symptoms or >10% of body weight loss. comparison of body weight and survival curves of mock with DENV-infected SK1-/- mice. DENV RNA levels at 3 dpi tended to be higher in SK1-/- compared with WT mice. RNA levels were also quantitated in WT and SK1-/- mice. sacrifice of mice at 7\u20138 dpi was due to symptomatic presentation. but those sacrificed at 9\u201314 dpi showed body weight loss. RNA was isolated from infected mice brain tissues and analysed by real time qRT-PCR for DENV. total DENV-2 RNA increases with time in WT mice, n = 3 at each time point; B. RNA was isolated from infected mice brain tissues at 3 dpi, n = 8 for each strain. data represent average PCR values from individual mice. data points representing non-symptomatic animals (9\u201314 dpi) are indicated by the half-filled symbols. Statistical analysis has been performed on symptomatic DENV-infected mice only. n = 5 WT and n = 3 SK1-/- mock-infected mice. data represent average PCR values from individual mice and normalized against GAPDH by Ct method. Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired student t-test. IFN- and ISG mRNA levels were not significantly different between WT and SK1-/- mice at end stage disease. at end stage disease, IFN- mRNA levels tended to be increased (p = 0.224 WT; 0.086 SK1-/-) the lack of SK1 could be compensated for by an increase in SK2 levels. results showed no change in SK2 mRNA or SK2 activity in SK1-/- mice brains. further, S1P levels were quantitated in brain lysates. PCR data represent average PCR values from individual mice. SK activity data and S1P quantitation are expressed relative to total protein quantitation. statistical significance was assessed by unpaired student t-test. the levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNA were compared by qRT-PCR in WT and SK1-/- mice at 3 dpi and end stage disease. results again demonstrate a lack of increase in CD4 mRNA levels following DENV-infection of WT or SK1-/- mice at either time point pi and no significant difference between DENV-infected mice. in vitro we have investigated the role of SK1 during DENV-2 infection in vivo using immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice and direct ic DENV infection. symptomatic DENV-infection with body weight loss and neurological signs is positively associated with the level of DENV RNA in the brain with a lower level of DENV RNA in the brains of asymptomatic mice at 9\u201314 dpi. we chose to analyse the mRNA level of selected important type I IFN driven ISGs. we have previously shown to be induced in a SK1-dependent manner. at 6 dpi and end stage disease the level of IFN- mRNA tended to be increased. studies have shown the activation of microglial cells, an increase in neurological disease severity when these cells are depleted and a role for microglia in production of cytokines and chemokines. the induction of ISGs is evident prior to the presence of symptomatic infection but was not significantly different between SK1-/- mice. lack of SK1 in the brain may be due to pathogen or stimulus specific roles for SK1 in brain inflammation or tissue specific roles for SK1. mRNA levels for genes such as OAS, MDA5, and STAT1 as well as ISGs IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15 are greater in the liver than the brain of mice. SK1-/- mice do not have altered levels of S1P in the brain. this contrasts to the early increase in SK1 activity that we have documented in deNV-infected EC [16] and inhibition late in infection in a number of cell types in vitro [15], which again may reflect tissue-specific responses of SK1 to infection. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been reported in mice challenged with a WNV [60, 64] and Yellow fever (YF)-17D virus [65]. a number of flavivirus and other virus infections in the brain suggest that CD8+ T-cells are a major infiltrating cell type. a lack of SK1 did not affect DENV-induced responses of CXCL10 or S1P. studies show a role for SK1 in promoting ISG induction following DENV-infection in vitro. SK1 does not play a role in these processes."}
