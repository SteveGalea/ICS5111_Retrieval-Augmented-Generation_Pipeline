{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus entry into target cell is initiated by binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) surface subunit gp120 to the receptor CD4 and a coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the target cell. the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) and N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) of gp41 interact with each other to form a stable six-helix bundle (6 peptides derived from the gp41 CHR sequence exhibit potent anti-HIV type 1 (HIV-1) activity. one of the peptides, T20 (enfuvirtide [Fuzeon]; Genentech), was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first HIV fusion/entry inhibitor for treatment of HIV-infected patients. a pocket-binding domain (PBD) was added to the N terminus of a CHR peptide (e.g., T20) to strengthen the interaction between the CHR peptide and the deep hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal groove region on the NHR trimer (15). Adding Met and Thr, which form a hooklike structure, could further increase the binding affinity of an inhibitor to the C terminus of the NHR trimer (16). this strategy has never been reported yet shallow pocket in the N-terminal region (L544 to V549) can accommodate 2 to 4 amino acid residues. some hydrophobic residues with long side chains, such as Met, Trp, Tyr, Ile, and Leu, are needed to bind to this hydrophobic pocket. WQ-IDI, WQ-LDI, and MT-WQ-IDL scrambled peptide against HIV-1 Bal (R5 virus) infection. inhibitory activities of peptides against cell-cell fusion between H9/HIV-1IIIB cells and MT-2 cells. error bars show standard deviations. 0.2 6.4 1.8 85.2 81.9 WQ-LDI 3.6 0.2 3.1 0.1 7.2 1.0 84.2 80.5 WQ-IDL 1.6 0.1 2.5 0.1 5.6 1.2 85.1 81.8 MT-WQ-IDL 0.6 0.1 0.6 0.1 1.2 0.2 90.8 90.7 MT-WQ 8.8 0.4 6.7 0.5 14.8 2.8 84.4 74.8 T20 71.8 2.2 70.5 0.9 91.0 1.2 NAb NA the IC50 of MT-WQ-IDL reached as low as 0.6 nM for inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB infection. the scrambled version of peptide MT-WQ-IDL had no anti-HIV-1 activity. MT-WQ-IDL was about 4.2-, 210-, 11.2-, 12.7-, and 118-fold more potent than WQ-IDL. MT-2 cells express CD4 and coreceptor CXCR4 and H9/HIV-1IIIB cells. the result showed that H9/HIV-1IIIB cells fused with MT-2 cells in the absence of peptide fusion inhibitors. the addition of the IDL tail to the C terminus of a CHR peptide can indeed increase its fusion inhibitory activity. IDL exhibited significantly decreased inhibitory activity against infection by either the X4 or R5 HIV-1 strain when it was added 1 or 2 h postinfection. this result indicates that MT-WQ-IDL inhibits early-stage events of HIV-1 replication, such as viral entry. heparin, a nonspecific HIV-1 attachment inhibitor, could inhibit HIV-1 infection with or without washing. MT-WQ-IDL does not block the attachment of HIV-1 to cells expressing CD4 receptor but may interact with the CD4-triggered prehairpin intermediate of the HIV-1 gp41. MT-WQ-IDL could effectively block HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion when the H9/HIV-1IIIB cells preincubated with peptide were not washed. however, the cells pretreated with both sCD4 and MT-WQ-IDL lost their ability to fuse with MT-2 cells after the unbonded sCD4 and MT-WQ-IDL were removed by washing. the results suggest that MT-WQ-ID Q-IDI, WQ-LDI, and MT-WQ-IDL conjugates could interact with N46 to form a 6-HB with a helicity similar to that of the 6-HB formed between N46 and C34. the addition of the artificial tails does not change the overall conformation of the CHR peptides. the binding affinities between N46 and the WQ peptides with artificial tail anchors were much higher than that between N46 and C34. these conjugated peptides can bind the viral gp41 NHR to form more stable heterogeneous 6-HBs and block homologous 6-HB formation between viral gp41 NHR and CHR domains. a new model of viral fusion was proposed in gp41. the MT-WQ-IDL peptide may bind to the viral NHR trimer at the prehairpin intermediate state to form homologous 6-HB. this prevents the viral NHR trimer from dissociating and embedding into the viral membranes. MT-WQ-IDL and MT-WQ-IDL exhibited much more potent activities than WQ or T20 against all clinical isolates and Chinese epidemic strains tested. IC50s at low nM levels showed that these CHR peptides with the IDL tail possess improved antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 clinical strains. 93BR020 (F, X4/R5) \u2014 326.5 11.0 4.1 0.8 0.5 0.1 37.2 4.1 BCF02 (O, R5) \u2014 283.5 28.0 2.6 1.6 1.6 0.6 0.1 38.3 2.1 NP1525 (A/E, X4/R5) \u2014 138.5 19.0 2.0 0.2 0.6 0.1 46.2 7.4 Pseudoviruses bearing Env of Chinese epidemic strains MW96 sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization is unknown. a IC50 data were derived from the results of three independent experiments. sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization is unknown. MT-WQ-IDL showed even higher potency than WQ-IDL against T20- and T2635-resistant strains. IC50s ranging from 0.1 to 12 nM, about 198-fold more potent than WQ on average. MT hook at the N terminus of CHR peptides can strengthen most of these CHR peptides only if it binds to the correct site at the correct site. addition of IDL at the correct site of the C terminus, Q653, is expected to enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity of most CHR peptide fusion inhibitors. however, this approach is not applicable to T20. NHR is colored in gray, MT-WQ-IDL in forest green, and both the MT and IDL tails in magenta. important residues are enlarged as sticks and identified. 656 were buried in this pocket, and D655 was forced outward. the helical conformation is expected to stabilize the binding between the inhibitor and the NHR better than in a traditional helical conformation. the resultant peptide M1 exhibited significantly enhanced inhibition activity against MERS-CoV-mediated membrane fusion and infection of pseudovirus. this results suggest that our strategy can also be used to design or optimize peptidic fusion inhibitors against other enveloped viruses with class I membrane fusion proteins. artificial tail anchor, IDL, binds to the C-terminal shallow pocket in the gp41 NHR trimer. fusion inhibitor with both an MT hook and an IDL tail exhibits more potent anti-HIV-1 activity than those with the MT hook or IDL tail only, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a new anti-HIV drug. we designed 5 artificial peptide tails, each containing 2 to 4 amino acid residues. they were linked individually to the C terminus of WQ, a 26-mer CHR-derived peptide. these conjugated peptides were tested for their levels of inhibitory activity against infection by HIV-1 IIIB. peptides WQ-IDI, WQ-LDI, and WQ-IDL showed antiviral activities similar to that of WQ-LDL, while WQ-IDL was about 2.3-, 77.1-, and 44.9-fold more effective than WQ-LDL, and T20 respectively. this result suggests that IDL is the most effective peptide tail for binding the CHR peptide WQ to the newly identified N-terminal pocket on the NHR trimer a IC50 data were derived from the results of three independent experiments. we then compared the antiviral activities of the conjugated peptides WQ-LDL, WQ-IDI, WQ-LDI, and WQ-IDL with those of WQ and T20 against infection by HIV-1 Bal. all four conjugated peptides were much more effective in inhibiting HIV-1 Bal infection than WQ or T20. scrambled version of peptide MT-WQ-IDL showed no anti-HIV-1 activity. MT-WQ-IDL was about 4.2-, 210-, 11.2-, 12.7-, and 118-fold more potent than WQ-IDL, WQ, MT-WQ, C34, and T20 respectively, for inhibiting HIV-1 Bal infection. the IC50 of the WQ-IDL peptide was 5.6 nM, which is about 28.5-, 2.6-, 3.4-, and 16.2-fold more potent than WQ, MT-WQ, C34, and T20. MT-WQ-IDL was about 132.9-, 4.7-, 12.3-, 15.7-, and 75.8-fold more potent than WQ, WQ-IDL, respectively, for inhibiting HIV-1 time-of-addition assay was performed to evaluate the inhibitory activities of MT-WQ-IDL and AZT against infection by either X4 or R5 HIV-1 when it was added after 2 h postinfection. MT-WQ-IDL blocks the attachment of HIV-1 to CD4-expressing cells (U87 CD4+ CCR5+ cells) MT-WQ-IDL alone without wash, 93.8%; MT-WQ-IDL alone with wash, 5.6%; sCD4 alone with wash, 30.6%; MT-WQ-IDL and sCD4 with wash, 87.1%. an HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion washout assay was performed. MT-WQ-IDL inhibits HIV-1 entry by interacting with the prehairpin intermediate of gp41 triggered by sCD4 or cell-associated CD4 receptor. this is consistent with the mechanism of action of most other HIV-1 CHR peptides (29\u201332) a thermal denaturation experiment was conducted to compare the thermostability of the 6-HBs formed between the CHR peptide C34 or the WQ peptide with different artificial tails and the NHR peptide N46. the binding affinities between N46 and the WQ peptides with artificial tail anchors were much higher than that between N46 and C34. these conjugated peptides can bind the viral gp41 NHR to form more stable heterogene MT-WQ-IDL, MT-WQ, and MT-WQ-IDL exhibited much stronger inhibition of 6-HB formation than WQ-IDL. a new model of viral fusion was proposed in gp41. e may bind to the viral NHR trimer at the prehairpin intermediate state to form homologous 6-HB. it is questionable whether MT-WQ-IDL is able to bind to the viral NHR trimer formed at the fusogenic prebundle state. the IDL-conjugated peptide was more effective than the CHR peptides without an IDL tail in inhibiting infection by HIV-1 clinical strains, Chinese epidemic strains, and T26 Tier Mean IC50 SD (nM)a WQ WQ-IDL MT-WQ-IDL T20 HIV-1 clinical isolates 92UG029 (A, X4) 1 383.3 13.0 20.6 2.9 4.1 0.9 43.4 4.1 US4GS007 (B, R5) \u2014 >500 86.9 12.0 12.0 12.5 4.0 157.3 18.0 BK132/GS009 (B, X4) 1 >500 90.7 18.0 15.1 4.2 12.4 1.0 2.1 1.2 16.2 1.6 255-34 (02_AG, R5) 2 46.6 6.6 1.0 0.4 0.1 0.1 17.7 2.1 235-47 (02_AG, R5) 2 22.6 1.3 0.9 1.5 0.1 0.1 18.1 3.1 211-9 (02_AG, R5) 2 56.8 9.3 1.7 0.7 0.1 0.2 27.8 4.8 AE03 (A/E, R5) 2 235.2 12.0 sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization is unknown. we compared the inhibitory activities of WQ-IDL and MT-WQ-IDL with those of WQ and T20 against HIV-1 variants with single or double mutations. MT hook at the N terminus of CHR peptides can strengthen most of these CHR peptides only if it binds to the correct site. the addition of IDL at the correct site of the C terminus, Q653, is expected to enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity of most CHR peptides. however, this approach is not applicable to T20. T20 does not contain the pocket-binding domain (PBD) at its N terminus. the omit map (C) was generated with the phases of a molecular replacement solution with preliminary refinement but without the IDL tail modeled from the beginning. MT-WQ-IDL can bind to the NHR more stably and block the formation of a homologous 6-helix bundle. our strategy that targets the shallow pocket outside the hydrophobic groove could also be used to develop fusion inhibitors against other class I enveloped viruses. we took Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which is an enveloped virus with class I membrane fusion protein. the original sequence of MERS-CoV HR1 aa 1254 to 1256 is colored in cyan. the EAN hook is superposed on M0 in panel c and shown for residue interactions in panel d. peptides were synthesized using a standard solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl (FMOC) method. the peptides were solubilized using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) the concentrations were tested by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar-extinction coefficient. p24 antigen was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the maximum infectivity was determined in the absence of peptide, and the background was measured in the absence of virus.
