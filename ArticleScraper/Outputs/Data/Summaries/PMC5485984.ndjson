{"summary": "plant lectins have been characterized as hemagglutinin- or mitogen-acting toward animal cells (e.g., Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I (GSL-I) A4 hemagglutinin specific for blood type group A [1,2,3] and the plant toxin ricin known as Ricinus communis agglutinin II (RCA60) [4,5,6]) the sequences are of UDA6 isolectin (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number AAD05433) for UDA, PLC isolectin (AB052963) for PWM, WGA1 isolectin (UniProtKB accession number, P10968) for WGA (categorized as tandem-repeat type), LEL (AB360604), DSA-B isolectins (AB618634) for DSA, and ST lectin-1, 2 and 7, \"tandem-repeat type\" consisting of multiple CRDs such as galectin-4, 8 and 9, and \"chimera type\" consisting of a CRD and a non-CRD structural domain such as galectin-3. details of binding specificity of these chitin-binding lectins are not known. tandem-repeat type lectin consisting of four hevein domain repeats. PWM isolated from the root of pokeweed also belongs to a tandem-repeat type. STL isolated from the plant tuber potato and DSA isolated from the seed of thornapple are more complex and categorized as a chimera-type lectin. 43 commercial lectins, including the six chitin-binding lectins, are immobilized. further analysis by a lectin microarray was performed by probing with a serum glycoprotein, fetuin (FET), both before and after sialidase treatment. results are extremely informative and will help interpret lectin-glycoprotein interactions in a variety of histochemical research fields and glyco-biomarker investigations. FAC was carried out with a previously established procedure [9,48,52] to determine the Kd values of each of the six chitin-binding lectins for 124 PA-oligosaccharides. each of the lectins was immobilized on activated Sepharose at several concentrations. 31 M for STL and chitopentaose--pNP, 48 M for UDA and LacNAc--pNP and 57 M for WGA and LacNAc--pNP (Figure 2). Table 1. Specifications of lectin columns used for FAC analysis. woolf-Hofstee-type plots for the determination of Bt values. the results of columns for DSA (closed squares), LEL (closed circles), PWM (open squares) and STL (open circles) are shown in panels A and B, respectively. bar graph representation of affinity constant (Ka) was made for DSA, LEL, PWM, STL, UDA, and WGA against a panel of PA-oligosaccharides. the small Arabic numbers at the bottom correspond to sugar numbers indicated in Figure 3. DSA, PWM, and STL did not show detectable affinity for chitotriose (906), while the Kd value of WGA was almost the same as that for chitotetraose. affinities of DSA for these oligosaccharides were relatively low compared with other oligosaccharides. LEL appears to work as a good probe for detecting oligo- or poly-LacNAc chains in N-, O-glycans, or glycolipids. affinities to these oligo-LacNAc structures are relatively low. affinities for glycolipid-type oligosaccharides were low for WGA and UDA. affinities for these oligosaccharides were not detectable for PWM and STL. previous papers report that PWM bound to poly-LacNAc chains. binding affinity of PWM is lowest among the tested chitin-binding lectins. the Kd for PA-chitotetraose (907) is 53 M, which is 83 times weaker than LEL. however, PWM showed substantial affinity for glycolipid-type glycans 733 and 734. structural inspection leads to speculation that UDA requires the presence of a Man1-3(Man1-6)Man1-6Man structure. this is significantly different from PWM, which does not permit 1-2Man extension from the Man1-3Man branch in the common recognition unit Man1-3(Man1-6)Man1-6Man. these findings provide clues to interpret the results of binding experiments using these lectins as probes for high-mannose-type N-glycans. significant binding was found for 052 (29 M), a sole hybrid-type N-glycan with a bisecting GlcNAc residue. we undertook further analysis using an additional set of hybrid-type N-glycans. however, WGA showed much lowered binding to complex-type N-glycans. WGA has no binding affinity for fully galactosylated glycans 308 and 406, which contain a bisecting GlcNAc residue, nor for an agalactosylated biantennary glycan 103. substantial binding to 310 and its analogue 311 could be attributed to a non-reducing terminal GlcNAc at two branch positions caused by GnT I and II. all six chitin-binding lectins showed significant binding to LacNAc (LN; B11; 901 in Figure 3) and its derivatives Gal1-3LacNAc (D8; 725 in Figure 3) and Gal1-4LacNAc (D9; 715 in Figure 3). chitobiose-PAA (B11) was apparently strong for LEL and STL, while it was low for PWM, UDA, and DSA. the binding to Gal1-3LacNAc and Gal1-4LacNAc is not ascribed to terminal epitope structures (e.g., Gal epitope) as unique features to individual lectins, only LEL bound to keratin sulfate (KS; D19) but not to other glycosaminoglycans. the binding was particularly evident in LEL, STL, and WGA. the binding was more selective than the other lectins. WFA also binds strongly to glycoproteins, which have highly branched glycoproteins. lectins (LEL and STL) also bound to TG (B4) but to a much lesser extent compared with GlcNAc-PAA (B23) and its 6-sulfo form ([6S]GlcNAc-PAA; B24) chitin-binding lectins were significantly reduced after sialidase treatment. a common feature of all of the chitin-binding lectins investigated here is that binding to TG was substantially reduced after sialidase treatment. the presence of bisecting GlcNAc in OVM may explain the strong binding of WGA. the interpretation of glycoconjugate microarray, mimicking cell surface probing with these lectins, is not simple. possible reasons for discrepancies include the cluster effect evident in the latter method. signal intensities of a series of sia-binding lectins (MAL, SNA, SSA, TJA-I, and MAH) decreased after desialylation. signal intensities of gal-binding lectins (ECA, BPL, TJA-II, PNA WFA, and SBA) became much stronger after sialidase treatment. chitin-binding lectins, signal intensities of DSA, LEL, STL, and UDA were reduced for asialo-FET by approximately 11%, 42%, 34%, and 34%, respectively. the effect of sialic acid clustering is significant, but rather modest for most of the chitin-binding lectins under conditions where lectins are immobilized. other chitin-binding lectins do not belong to the hevein family. they include LysM (lysin motif), which was initially found in several bacterial autolysin proteins and is often associated with chitinase as a carbohydrate-binding module. it seems that binding features to chito-oligosaccharides are fairly different. a DSA shows affinity to highly branched N-glycans containing intact type II LacNAc, e.g., 323, 418 and 420; b LEL shows substantial affinity to repeated LacNAc structures, e.g., 902, 903 and 905; c PWM shows relatively weak but significant affinity to several members of high-mannose-type N-glycans, i.e., 004, 005 and 007. tandem-repeat type lectins may improve their performance in terms of binding affinity and specificity by selecting one of their repeating CRDs resulting in a \u201chomogenous\u201d tandem-repeat. it is widely believed that individual CRDs, after duplication in the course of evolution, diverge from each other and thus their specificities have also diverged. so far, such an approach has never been made with chitin-binding lectins. 43 commercial lectins, including the six chitin-binding lectins, were immobilized. each of the lectins was immobilized on activated Sepharose at several concentrations. each of the lectins was immobilized on activated Sepharose at several concentrations. M for LEL and chitopentaose--pNP, 42 M for PWM and chitopentaose--pNP, 31 M for STL and chitopentaose--pNP, 48 M for UDA and LacNAc--pNP and 57 M for WGA and LacNAc--pNP. the results of columns for DSA (closed squares), LEL (closed circles), PWM (open squares) and STL (open circles) are shown in panels A and B, respectively. chitopentaose-pNP-sugars were used for concentration-dependent analysis. carbohydrate structures are expressed using symbols according to the rules defined by the Consortium for Glycomics (CFG; http://www.functionalglycomics.org/static/consortium/Nomenclature.shtml) a bar graph representation of affinity constant (Ka) was made against a panel of PA-oligosaccharides. affinities of DSA for these chito-oligosaccharides were relatively low compared with other oligosaccharides to which DSA binds, such as branched N-glycans. however, their affinities were almost the same regardless of the chain length, unlike other oligomers. glycan-type glycans 724 (LNnT, 91 M) vs. 726 (Lex, N.D.) affinity appeared to be attributed to the number of intact type II LacNAc units. however, core fucosylation did not substantially affect the affinity. affinities for oligo- or poly-LacNAc chains were low for WGA and UDA. affinities for these oligosaccharides were low for PWM and STL. affinities for these oligosaccharides were relatively low for WGA and UDA. the binding affinity of PWM is lowest among the tested chitin-binding lectins. the Kd for PA-chitotetraose (907) for which PWM showed the highest affinity is 53 M, which is 83 times weaker than LEL. however, PWM showed substantial affinity for glycolipid-type glycans 733 and 734. the affinity to these glycans increased with the increasing number of Man residues. Detailed structural inspection leads to speculation that UDA requires the presence of a Man1-3(Man1-6)Man1-6Man structure. this is significantly different from PWM, which does not permit 1-2Man extension from the Man1-3Man branch in the common recognition unit Man1-3(Man1-6)Man1-6Man. alylated glycans 705 (1000 M), 710 (1000 M), 712 (1100 M), which contain Neu5Ac2-3Gal. significant binding was found for 052 (29 M), a sole hybrid-type N-glycan with a bisecting GlcNAc residue. a sole exception is 310 (1. WGA has no binding affinity for fully galactosylated glycans 308 and 406, which contain a bisecting GlcNAc residue, nor for an agalactosylated biantennary glycan 103. substantial binding to 310 as well as its analogue 311 could be attributed to a non-reducing terminal GlcNAc. glycans 724 (LNnT, 91 M) vs. 726 (Lex, N.D.) affinity appeared to be attributed to the number of intact type II LacNAc units. core fucosylation did not substantially affect the affinity. this result clearly indicates that DSA does not bind to the non-reducing terminal chitobiose structure. affinities for oligo- or poly-LacNAc chains were low for WGA and UDA. affinities for these oligosaccharides were low for PWM and STL. affinities for these oligosaccharides were relatively low for WGA and UDA. the binding affinity of PWM is lowest among the tested chitin-binding lectins. the Kd for PA-chitotetraose (907) for which PWM showed the highest affinity is 53 M, which is 83 times weaker than LEL. however, PWM showed substantial affinity for glycolipid-type glycans 733 and 734. Detailed structural inspection leads to speculation that UDA requires the presence of a Man1-3(Man1-6)Man1-6Man structure. this is significantly different from PWM, which does not permit 1-2Man extension from the Man1-3Man branch in the common recognition unit Man1-3(Man1-6)Man1-6Man. findings provide clues to interpret the results of binding experiments using these lectins as probes for high-mannose-type N-glycans. cans 705 (1000 M), 710 (1000 M), 712 (1100 M), which contain Neu5Ac2-3Gal. significant binding was found for 052 (29 M), a sole hybrid-type N-glycan with a bisecting GlcNAc residue. WGA has no binding affinity for fully galactosylated glycans 308 and 406, which contain a bisecting GlcNAc residue. substantial binding to 310 and its analogue 311 could be attributed to a non-reducing terminal GlcNAc at two branch positions caused by GnT I and II. glycans used in FAC are indicated in parentheses. binding features to chitobiose-PAA (D24; 906 in Figure 3) also showed significant binding to chitobiose-PAA (D24; 906 in Figure 3) on the microarray platform, though their binding was much weaker than LEL and WGA. LEL and STL bound almost equally well to sulfated LacNAc-PAA, [3\u2019S]LacNAc (B12; 918 in Figure 3) and [6\u2019S]LacNAc (B13; not available in Figure 3), whereas WGA and DSA showed preference for [6S]LacNAc (B13) over [3\u2019S]LacNAc (B12) no binding was observed to core 1 (Gal1-3GalNAc1-PAA; C11) and core 8 (Gal1-3Gal1-PAA; C17) disaccharides. the binding was particularly evident in LEL, STL, and WGA. WGA bound strongly to a glycolipid-type, Forssman disaccharide (GalNAc1-3GalNAc-PAA; C13) but to a much lesser extent compared with GlcNAc-PAA (B23) and its 6-sulfo form ([6S]GlcNAc-PAA; B24) lectins did not show significant affinity for sialylated glycans in FAC. the observed binding to the glycoconjugate microarray is attributed to a clustering effect involving GlcNAc and/or acetyl group of Neu5Ac, a major component of sialic acid. binding to TG was substantially reduced after sialidase treatment. strong binding was observed for DSA, which could be attributed to the presence of partially galactosylated multi-antennary, complex-type N-glycans. the presence of bisecting GlcNAc in OVM may explain strong binding of WGA. chitin-binding lectins showed significant binding to LacNAc (LN; B11; 901 in Figure 3) and its derivatives Gal1-3LacNAc (D8; 725 in Figure 3) and Gal1-4LacNAc (D9; 715 in Figure 3). chitin-binding lectins showed significant binding to LacNAc (LN; B11; 901 in Figure 3) and its derivatives Gal1-3LacNAc (D8; the binding to [3\u2019S]LacNAc is not ascribed to terminal epitope structures (e.g., Gal epitope) because such terminal disaccharides were not recognized at all. STL did not show the binding to KS (D19) in this study. WFA also binds strongly to glycoproteins, which have highly branched N-glycans such as asialo-1-acid glycoprotein (asialo-AGP) to which STL bound weakly (B20) only WGA showed extensive, but rather selective binding toward O-glycans. WGA bound strongly to a glycolipid-type, Forssman disaccharide. signals were much stronger for FET (B1) and AGP (B21) than transferin (TF; B3) and thyroglobulin (TG; B4). DSA, PWM, and UDA binding to TG (B4) may be attributed to binding to high-mannose-type N-glycans. asialo-FET (B19), asialo-AGP (B20), and slightly for asialo-TF (B21) binding to TG was substantially reduced after sialidase treatment. however, LEL, PWM, and STL showed weak binding to asialo-TG (B22) the presence of bisecting GlcNAc in OVM may explain the strong binding of WGA. possible reasons for discrepancies between the results of FAC and lectin microarray include the cluster effect evident in the latter method. signal intensities of a series of sia-binding lectins (MAL, SNA, SSA, TJA-I, and MAH) were drastically decreased after sialidase treatment. signal intensities of gal-binding lectins (ECA, BPL, TJA-II, PNA WFA, and SBA) became much stronger after sialidase treatment. sialic acid clustering is sufficient for WGA recognition at a glycoprotein level (triantennary N-glycans in FET), but not at a liberated glycan level. chitin-binding lectins have been used to detect and inhibit parasites or viruses, which recognize chito-oligosaccharides as target molecules. chito-oligo chitotriose-PA (906) N.D. 4.6 M N.D.

PA-N-glycans numbered 001\u2013014, 103, 105, 107, 108, 307, 313, 314, 323, 405, 410, 418\u2013420, 501\u2013504 and 506 were purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), 304, 403, and 404 were obtained from J-OIL MILLS. Inc. lectin columns were prepared by coupling to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. they were dissolved in 100 mM NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 M NaCl. excess NHS groups were deactivated by 0.5 M monoethanolamine (pH 8.3) the volume of the elution front (V) of each oligosaccharide was calculated as described previously. the equation can be simplified to be Kd = Bt/(V V0), where Kd value is no longer dependent on [A]0. a ratio between the two columns was determined using V V0 values of a reference glycan. an appropriate pNP-saccharide was diluted to various concentrations (2\u2013100 M) an appropriate pNP-saccharide was diluted to various concentrations and was used for concentration-dependent analysis. exposure time, 199 ms; detection sensitivities, gain 115 for DSA, LEL, STL, and UDA, gain 125 for PWM, and gain 110 for STL. analysis performed between immobilized lectins and a sialoglycoprotein, FET, in a lectin microarray platform. 1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1 (chitotetraose--pNP) and GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1 (chitopentaose--pNP) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. oligo-n-acetyllactosamines 901\u2013903 and 905 and milk oligosaccharides 722, 723, 732, and 735\u2013739 were generous gifts from K. Yoshida (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) and T. Urashima (Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro, Japan) they were prepared by coupling to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast lectin-immobilized columns were connected to the FAC-1 or FAC-T. flow rate and column temperature were kept at 0.125 mL/min and 25 \u00b0C. either excess volume of PA or pNP-oligosaccharides dissolved in TBS were successively injected into each of the columns. lectin-oligosaccharide interactions are often useful to discuss lectin-oligosaccharide interactions in terms of an affinity constant, Ka (1/Kd), instead of Kd. a ratio between the two columns was determined using V V0 values of a reference glycan, which showed significant retardation in both columns. microarray images were acquired using evanescent-field activated fluorescence scanner. exposure time, 199 ms; detection sensitivities, gain 90 and 80 for lectin microarray. binding lectins became evident (Table 2). it became clear that results of FAC and glycoconjugate microarray are not necessarily consistent. the interpretation of glycoconjugate microarray is not simple."}
