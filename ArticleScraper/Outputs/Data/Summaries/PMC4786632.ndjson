{"summary": "the ENCODE project explores all functional elements in human DNA. 80% of DNA is functional, while 62% is transcribed into ncRNA. ncRNAs first came to prominence in the 1990s. lncRNAs are defined as ncRNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, are at least 200 nucleotides in length, and do not have the ability to code proteins. lncRNAs are classified according to their position relative to protein-coding genes, which are operationally divided into five classes. lncRNAs produce various processes to regulate transcription, splicing, nucleic acid degradation, decoy, and translation. nucleic lncRNAs play important roles in modulating epigenetic13,14 and transcriptional processes15 to regulate gene expression by acting as signal, guide, decoy, or scaffold. many studies have revealed highly dynamic and cell-specific expression patterns for lncRNAs during immune cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation. non-coding repressor of NFAT inhibits the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in human-activated T cells. lncRNAs are expressed in myeloid cells27 and upregulated by retinoic acid-induced granulocyte differentiation of promyelocytic NB4 leukemia cells. lncRNAs also play important roles in innate immunity. this review will focus on the roles and mechanistic modes of lncRNAs in innate immune responses. the role of lncRNAs in innate immune responses has attracted much attention. many lncRNAs that have been linked to innate immunity have been discovered by microarray and RNA-Seq studies. lncRNA-COX2 First identified in LPS-stimulated mouse CD11C+ BMDCs. expression was induced by TLR ligands in a MyD88- and NF-B-dependent manner 32,36,37 PACER Activates COX-2 expression by occluding p50-p50 complexes in primary human epithelial cells and PMA-stimulated human monocyte\u2013macrophage cells 38 Lethe Binds to the RelA homodimer to block RelA-DNA binding and attenuates the NF inflammatory mediators, IL-1 and CXCL8 46,47 NKILA Binds to the NF-B/IkB complex and represses NF-B signaling and cancer-associated inflammation with induction by LPS, TNF-, and IL-1 43 Multiple 7419 lincRNAs were identified in BMDMs according to chromatin signatures defined by relative levels of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 surrounding the transcription start site p50-associated COX-2 extragenic RNA (PACER) is another antisense lncRNA38 that controls PMA/LPS-induced COX2 expression in cis within the upstream promoter region of COX2 in primary human epithelial cells. PACER directly sequesters the inhibitory p50-p50 from the COX2 promoter, where it replaces active p50-p65 to facilitate p300 binding. lethe expression is increased and then directly binds to the RelA homodimer. it blocks RelA-DNA binding and attenuates the NF-B-dependent inflammatory response. the age-associated loss of Lethe expression might provide one of the causes for increased NF-B activity during aging. NEAT1 (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1) is essential for nuclear paraspeckles body formation. it is induced by poly I:C, influenza virus, or herpes simplex virus. SFPQ is a paraspeckle member and binds IL-8 promoter sites to repress IL-8 transcription. lncRNA (NKILA) is induced by LPS, TNF-, and IL-1. it binds to the NF-B/IkB complex and represses NF-B signaling and cancer-associated inflammation. lncRNA-CMPK2 suppresses the expression of several antiviral ISGs. lncRNAs can control the potency of the antiviral IFN response. lncRNAs are an enhancer RNA and a region of bidirectional transcription that surrounds the IL-1 locus. both are nuclear-localized, NF-B-regulated, and favor LPS-induced messenger RNA transcription. lncRNA-COX2 acts as scaffold with interacting proteins. lincRNA-COX2 acts as scaffold with proteins. lincRNA-COX2 acts as scaffold with interacting proteins. lincRNA-COX2 acts as scaffold with proteins. lncRNA Characteristics/functions References VINC Inducible expression of VINC upon JEV infection and rabies virus infection in the mouse central nervous system 53 NeST (Tmevpg1) Binds to WDR5 to mediate H3K4me3 at the Ifng promoter. VIN loss-of-function analysis revealed that VIN favors IAV propagation. lncRNA-TARE is a telomere-associated lncRNAs in P. falciparum malaria. it is coordinately expressed after parasite DNA replication. it is poised to play an important role in P. falciparum telomere maintenance. lncRNAs and 1000 non-annotated genomic regions upon Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus infection were described in mice. the similar differential regulation of ncRNAs in response to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infection revealed that an lncRNA-based signature of respiratory virus infection might exist. differential expression of 42 lncRNAs were identified during IAV infections in human lung epithelial cells. virus inducible lincRNA (VIN) was induced by several IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H7N7) but not with influenza B virus, treatment with RNA mimics, or IFN-. virus loss-of-function analysis reveals its importance during productive IAV replication and viral protein synthesis. the expression of NTT is induced with an HIV synthetic peptide (p9) in activated human HLA-A2 blood mononuclear cells. this was the first demonstration of an endogenous noncoding human RNA molecule in the cellular immune response. the expression of NEAT1 is upregulated with HIV-1 infection and inhibited virus production. a latent tuberculosis infection group, 1113 lncRNAs were deregulated in an active TB group. 163 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in both a latent TB infection and active TB group. major gaps in our knowledge regarding pathogen genes represent a major obstacle in the progress of vaccine and drug development for infection diseases. lncRNA-TARE is an intriguing family of 22 telomere-associated lncRNAs in P. falciparum malaria. it is poised to play an important role in P. falciparum telomere maintenance, virulence gene regulation, and potentially other processes of parasite chromosome end biology.
