{"summary": "granulomatous dermatitis revealed with intracytoplasmic organisms. blood extraction and PCR detected leishmania species, Hepatozoon species and \u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\u2019 (CMhm) DNA. zoonotic vector-borne pathogen has been increasingly reported in cats in the Mediterranean basin. experimental and case-control studies on feline leishmaniosis are lacking. epidemiological studies, case series and case descriptions are required to establish a better understanding of clinicopathological presentations, treatment, monitoring and prevention of FeL. macrophages contained numerous intracytoplasmic vacuoles (5\u20137 m in diameter) the macrophages contained numerous intracytoplasmic vacuoles (5\u20137 m in diameter), within which were densely amphophilic round-to-oval organisms (approximately 1 m diameter) there were lighter admixtures of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells. granulomatous dermatitis with intracytoplasmic organisms consistent with leishmania species amastigotes in the macrophages. only mild hyperproteinaemia (84.0 g/l; reference interval 54\u201382 g/l) was present. the cat was enrolled into an epidemiology study. infantum was PCR negative for mycoplasma haemofelis, \u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\u2019, \u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\u2019 and \u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\u2019. the cat was seronegative for feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies. emominutum\u2019 during and after treatment with allopurinol at 10 mg/kg PO q12h for 6 months was started at month 0 Leishmania infantum Month 0 (pretreatment) Month 4 Month 6 (treatment cessation) DNA level per PCR assay (relative copy numbers) 663,600 17,300 500 130 64,600 ELISA units (EU), cut off point for negative result is 9.2 EU 163 124 57 99 107 The the leishVet Group1 and the Advisory Board on Cat Diseases Guidelines9 both recommend allopurinol treatment (10\u201320 mg/kg q24h or q12h) for FeL. a combination of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate has only been described in a few cases of FeL. ELISA serology was better for diagnosing clinical FeL compared with IFAT. the latter was more sensitive than ELISA to detect subclinical infection. the same study also recommended Western blot as the preferable serological test for FeL."}
