{"summary": "anti-EBOV antibody was measured by 2 neutralization and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in convalescent plasma (ECP) from 100 EVD survivor donors in liberia. antibodies were not detected in plasma specimens obtained from 15 of 100 donors. ECP was collected by apheresis from EVD survivor donors with Ebola treatment unit discharge certificates. bags of ECP were frozen within 6 hours of collection and stored below \u201318\u00b0C. plasma was divided into 0.5-mL aliquots, which were frozen and maintained at \u201320\u00b0C until analysis for anti-EBOV antibody levels. EBOV-specific monoclonal antibody KZ52 was used as the positive control. unbound virus was washed away after a further 1-hour incubation. the primary trial objective was correlation of anti-EBOV IgG and neutralization titers in ECP with kinetics of plasma viral load in ECP-treated participants. secondary objectives were to describe kinetics of plasma viral load in participants treated with and without ECP. participants were allocated to receive either enhanced standard of care alone (control group) or enhanced standard of care plus ECP (ECP group) EBOV GP ELISA results below the limit of detection were assigned a value of 0.001 U. blood was collected into EDTA tubes for viral load at enrollment, immediately prior to and 4 hours after completion of each 200-mL ECP treatment. control group specimens were collected every 48 hours. bags of ECP were frozen within 6 hours of collection and stored below \u201318\u00b0C until thawed to ambient temperature immediately prior to infusion. plasma was divided into 0.5-mL aliquots, which were frozen and maintained at \u201320\u00b0C until analysis for anti-EBOV antibody levels. EBOV-specific monoclonal antibody KZ52 was used as the positive control. cells were fixed 48 hours postinfection and infected cells were detected using EBOV-specific monoclonal antibody. plasma was divided into 0.5-mL aliquots, which were frozen and maintained at \u201320\u00b0C until analysis for anti-EBOV antibody levels. ELISAs Survivor plasma samples, naive human serum (negative control) and EBOV convalescent nonhuman primate serum (positive control) were serially diluted. neutralization assays Survivor plasma samples and naive human serum were diluted 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 in cell culture media, in duplicate. unbound virus was washed away after a further 1-hour incubation. treatment Participants received 200 mL of ECP intravenously (100 mL from 1 donor followed immediately by 100 mL from another donor) per dose. this dose could be repeated every 48 hours using the same lots of ECP used for the first dose for up to 3 doses unless participants were considered to have improved. log10 GE/mL = log10 800 + (Ct \u2013 41.16) / \u20133.36, where 800 = sample dilution factor, 41.16 = y-intercept, and \u20133.36 = slope of Ct (y) vs log10 GE (x) Objectives The primary trial objective was correlation of anti-EBOV IgG and neutralization titers in ECP with kinetics of plasma viral load in ECP-treated participants. mL of ECP intravenously (100 mL from 1 donor followed immediately by 100 mL from another donor) per dose. this dose could be repeated every 48 hours using the same lots of ECP used for the first dose for up to 3 doses unless participants were considered to have improved. EVD Survivors One hundred donor candidate survivors provided 190 specimens. 9 specimens were unsatisfactory for testing. 1 specimen was analyzed by all tests except the PRNT50. to 50% Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test Initial Specimen (N = 100) PRNT50 Positive (n = 85) PRNT50 Negative (n = 15) Test Positive, No. Test Negative, No. Test Negative, No. Test Negative, No. Test Positive, No. Sensitivity, % (95% CI) Specificity, % (95% CI) MNA50 83 2 15 0 100.00 (95.75\u2013100.00) 100.00 (78. ELISA-negative specimens clustered with specimens having PRNT50 1:10. there was no clear dose-response relationship between the ELISA values and the semiquantitative PRNT50 results in antibody-positive specimens. similar relationships were noted in the complete set of 180 specimens. IgM ELISAs on the initial IgG antibody\u2013negative specimens were negative and total IgG levels were normal (data not shown) comparison of age, sex, vital signs, blood group, prevalence of positive tests for transfusion-transmitted infections showed no differences between PCR-confirmed antibody-negative, all antibody-negative, and antibody-positive donors. the PCR-confirmed antibody-negative donor group had a significantly shorter mean interval between ETU discharge date and first specimen two participants (T1 and T2) each received ECP units from 2 donors with EBOV-specific ELISA values near the median of all donor specimen values. participants T1 and T2 each received 2 doses of ECP 48 hours apart. plasma viral load declined between the pre- and first postinfusion sampling point in both participants. EBOV GP, Ebola virus glycoprotein; ECP, Ebola convalescent plasma; IgG, immunoglobulin G; MNA50, 50% microneutralization assay; PRNT50, 50% plaque reduction neutralization test. participants received 100 mL of ECP from each indicated donor one after the other to make up a unit of ECP. participant T4 died before the scheduled 96-hour third infusion. no ABO-compatible ECP was available for control participants C1 and C2. viral load in participant C2 declined 2-fold over the first 48 hours. the ELISAs and the MNA50 remained positive, suggesting that the PRNT50 result of the second test was erroneous. both ELISAs were highly sensitive and specific and were highly concordant with each other for positive or negative serological status.

ELISA units per milliliter in each specimen were derived using a standard curve prepared with a reference antibody. clinical trial Enrollment, Baseline Characteristics, and Treatment Allocation The clinical trial, which began in December 2014, was designed to enroll 70 acute EVD participants. by March 2015, only 6 were enrolled as the incidence of EVD in liberia dropped rapidly. Participant T2 deteriorated clinically on day 6 with pallor and epigastric tenderness. deteriorated clinically on day 6 with pallor and epigastric tenderness. progressively increasing creatinine level. Specimens obtained at the time points indicated (squares) were assayed for EBOV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and converted to log10 genomic equivalents/mL. zero hours indicates time of first preinfusion specimen collection. ELISAs for EBOV do not require virus culture, are much less labor-intensive. compared to neutralization assays, ELISAs for EBOV do not require virus culture. negative IgM ELISAs and normal concentrations of plasma IgG in the first specimen suggested that defective class switching or immunoglobulin deficiency do not explain this failure. additional prospective studies should be conducted to examine the course of humoral and cellular immune responses during acute EVD. participants in this trial comprise a group with predicted high mortality based on virologic, clinical laboratory, and clinical criteria [16\u201320]. the study\u2019s strengths include careful assessment of Ebola viral load dynamics over multiple time points and the characterization of the potential potency of the ECP collected and administered. the trial also identified opportunities for enhancement to protocol design that could inform future trials of ECP efficacy. 7%\u201315% of EVD survivors who planned to donate convalescent plasma were negative by 4 tests for anti-EBOV antibody. further studies are needed to assess the frequency of antibody negativity in the overall survivor population and to evaluate innate and cellular immune responses that may mediate recovery in absence of detectable antibodies. additional data file.
