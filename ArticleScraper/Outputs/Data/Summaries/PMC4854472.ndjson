{"summary": "recent studies suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has had an impact on the circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains in the post-pandemic years. in this work we aim to investigate this issue and also to compare the relative transmissibility of these waves using Taiwan influenza surveillance data before, during and after the pandemic. seasonal influenza occurs globally with an estimated annual attack rate of 5%-10% in adults and 20%\u201330% in children [1]. influenza cases are reported almost year-on-year in temperate regions in autumn and winter, mostly in the northern Hemisphere from October to March. influenza cases are reported throughout the year with some summer influenza epidemics, but with peak number of reported cases occurring annually in autumn and winter from late October to March. studies have shown that excess influenza deaths during these months similar to those in the temperate zones can also be observed in Taiwan [3\u20134] influenza A viruses (IAV), influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes are currently circulating yearly among humans. type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than that of A and B. only influenza A and B viruses are included in seasonal influenza vaccines recommended every year by the WHO. data spans from week 1 of 2008 to week 18 of 2014, covering autumn/winter influenza seasons in Taiwan. the data spans from week 1 of 2008 to week 18 of 2014, covering autumn/winter influenza seasons in all parts of Taiwan. m09, AH3 and H3N2, with A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated only after week 26 of 2009 and H3N2 only after week 33 of 2011. a variation of the Richards model can be used to model many infectious disease outbreaks [17\u201326] a second type occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave. the basic reproduction number R0 for the Richards model is R0 = exp(rT), where T is the generation time or the average time period from onset of one individual to the onset of his/her contacts. the samples were tested for virus subtype with RT-PCR or virus isolation, and with HA or NA genes of the isolated virus sequenced. the samples were determined to be one of the five influenza virus strains: B, AH1, A(H1N1)pdm09, AH3 and H3N2. the Richards model has been applied extensively to model many infectious disease outbreaks [17\u201326]. one type occurs at peak incidence, and a second type occurs in a multi-wave epidemic. the basic reproduction number R0 for the Richards model is R0 = exp(rT), where T is the generation time or the average time period from onset of one individual. a generation time of T = 1.9/7 (95% CI: 1.30/72.71/7) was obtained for the 2009 pH1N1 influenza pandemic [30] since the 2009 pH1N1 virus was found to be not significantly different from seasonal influenza in its transmissibility. the 95% CI for r and ti, taken from SAS output, are measures of uncertainty for the nonlinear least-squared estimation. pdm09 0.59 (0.41,0.77) 9.4 (9.1,9.7) 1.17 (1.08,1.26) 2009/28-41 AH3 0.49 (0.38,0.60) 6.7 (6.4,7.1) 1.14 (1.08,1.21) 2009/40-2010/02 A(H1N1) pdm09 0.06 (0.05,0.06) 7.8 (6.1,9.4) 1.02 (1.01,1.02) 2010/08-38 B 0.89 (0.49,1.28) for clarity, we group the waves into three groups: B, H3/AH3N2, and AH1/A(H1N1)pdm09. to further elucidate the temporal changes in transmissibility of the strains, we provide the reproduction numbers of circulating influenza strains in timelines. the pattern is similar to what occurred in the aftermath of 1918\u20131919 pandemic. since 2009 a wave of some influenza strain occurred every fall/winter influenza season during our study period except 2011\u20132012 season, when influenza B circulated. in 2008\u20132014, at least one wave of cases was detected in the first two months of every year, including two circulating waves of B and A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2014. the wave of influenza B from week 8 to week 38 of 2010 immediately following the fall/winter wave of 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 was substantially higher (at 0.89; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.28), in fact highest among all the waves detected. most of the waves yielded reproduction number R between 1.0\u20131.2. only two waves resulted in R great than 1.2; AH1 during weeks 1\u20136 2008 and B during weeks 8\u201338 2010. both waves exhibit wider 95% CI range. the estimates for R are consistently within range of other estimates for seasonal influenza in tropical-subtropical (e.g., Taiwan [29] and Australia [33]) however, the estimate of R during 2009 pandemic period is lower than that of many studies from other countries. study reveals different values of R for different epidemic waves of the same influenza subtype. the study contains several obvious limitations, the foremost being the scarcity and incompleteness of full virology data. the study contains several obvious limitations, the foremost being the scarcity and incompleteness of full virology data. temporal patterns and transmissibility of influenza strains illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be used to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate. another limitation pertains to model fitting using cumulative data, which tends to have the advantage of smoothing out some of the stochastic variations which are often contained in longitudinal disease surveillance data. a wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in six separate waves in taiwan between summer of 2009 and spring of 2014. the pattern is similar to what occurred in the aftermath of 1918\u20131919 pandemic. a much larger study period than our data allows would likely offer more insights. it has been proposed that due to school/business closure due to traditional lunar New Year holidays in Taiwan that falls typically between week 4 to week 8 of each year, more frequent contacts in the households tends to result in increased transmission. the former wave (AH1 in 2008) was in fact part of a wave that started in late 2007. the latter wave (B in 2010) was occurring in the summer after the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic and co-circulating with a smaller wave of A(H1N1)pdm09. the three waves with R between 1.1\u20131.2 occurred during and shortly after the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic. the estimates for R are consistently within range of other estimates for seasonal influenza in tropical-subtropical (e.g., Taiwan [29] and Australia [33]) the estimate of R during 2009 pandemic period is lower than that of many studies from other countries. but it is more similar to estimates obtained for southern Hemisphere countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) studies have shown that antigenic drift might explain seasonal influenza circulation patterns in particular subtypes. the study contains several obvious limitations, the foremost being the scarcity and incompleteness of full virology data. the proportion of ILI cases tested is not known, and the proportion of positive tests is not available from Taiwan CDC database. quantitative analysis on comparative variations in R for different strains and genotype variants using the same modeling framework. the 2009 pandemic offers us a great opportunity to learn, even with these hard to ignore biases."}
