{"summary": "the only clinical HIV vaccine trial to date to show significant efficacy (RV144) found reduced infection rates correlated with the level of nonneutralizing antibodies (Abs) specific for the V2 region of the gp120 envelope (Env) glycoprotein [1]. this is consistent with previous studies implicating Fc-mediated Ab activities in responses to various pathogens [4, 5, 6]. neutrophil counts of infected infants were significantly lower than those of uninfected infants. neutrophil counts of infected infants were significantly lower than those of uninfected infants. every 1,000-cell/L increase was associated with an 11% reduction in infection risk. a panel of mAbs specific for HIV Env was employed to elicit ADCP of fluorescent beads coated with Env gp120. differences in activity were evident, indicating a need to move away from the cell-line model for studying Fc-mediated activity by HIV-specific Abs. mAbs used here were originally isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected individuals. cells were purified using an IRB-approved protocol for venipuncture. 25 mL of neutrophil isolation media was aliquoted to the bottom of a 50-mL centrifuge tube. erythrocytes were lysed with 10 mL red cell lysis buffer. 10 L of bead solution was aliquoted per well in round-bottomed 96-well plates. five-fold dilutions of each mAb in HBSS was added and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. twenty-five thousand THP-1 cells (ATCC) or 2 105 freshly isolated neutrophils or monocytes were added. ADCP scores at each mAb dilution were normalized by subtracting the score from the negative-control mAb tested simultaneously. mAbs were produced by conventional molecular techniques as previously described [33] in 293T cells. each participant was recruited and interviewed in accordance with ethics and institutional review board approval. each participant was recruited and interviewed using an IRB-approved protocol for venipuncture. each participant was recruited and interviewed using an IRB-approved protocol. protein from the Clade C strain ZM53 (Immunetech) was biotinylated using the EZ-LinkTM NHS-LC-LC-LC-LC-Biotin kit. protein was conjugated to 1 m FluoSpheres\u00ae NeutrAvidin\u00ae-labeled microspheres for 2 h at 37\u00b0C according to the manufacturer's instructions. ADCP was measured on the FITC channel as percentage of bead-positive cells of appropriate SSC/FSC after initial gating to eliminate doublets, debris, and dead cells. calculated ADCP scores were normalized by subtracting the score from the negative-control mAb tested simultaneously. freshly isolated neutrophils were incubated with actin inhibitor cytochalasin D (CytoD) and/or a cocktail of FcR-blocking Abs (FcBlock) for 30 min prior to their exposure to the immune complexes. follow-up experiments included CytoD/FcBlock controls to ensure cell fluorescence was indicative of bead internalization. gp120-coated beads were tested with the IgG1 V2i-specific mAbs 1357, 1361, 2158, and 830A, and the IgG1 V3-specific mAbs 2219, 2557, and 3792. all donors exhibited the highest neutrophil ADCP elicited by V3 mAbs 3792 and 2557 (Fig. 2). neutrophil ADCP elicited by V3 mAbs was significantly higher than V2i ADCP (Student's t test; p 0.0001; Fig. 2g). neutrophil ADCP profile of neutrophils obtained from 5 different donors was strongly elicited. anti-V3 mAb 2219 elicited the highest level of ADCP activity in the THP-1 assay. this activity was significantly higher than that of most other mAbs. mAbs 3792 and 2557 elicited significantly higher ADCP activity. a standard ELISA was performed using the same antigen as was used for ADCP assays. this protein was coated to the plate wells, and the same 7 mAbs tested for ADCP were titrated to assess their relative binding affinity for gp120. the mAbs were titrated to assess their relative binding affinity for gp120. the assay was developed, tested, and performed as described above for neutrophil ADCP. it was apparent donor-to-donor variability strongly affected the ADCP activity observed (Fig. 6a\u2013c) cells that had been preincubated with CytoD or FcBlock prior to addition of the 830A-bead complexes exhibited a significant 5- to 10-fold reduction in ADCP score. follow-up experiments included CytoD/FcBlock controls to ensure cell fluorescence was indicative of bead internalization. gp120 beads were tested with the IgG1 V2i-specific mAbs 1357, 1361, 2158, and 830A, and the IgG1 V3-specific mAbs 2219, 2557, and 3792. neutrophils from each of the 5 donors exhibited a unique ADCP profile, although trends were displayed in the results from all the donors. neutrophil ADCP elicited by V3 mAbs was significantly higher than V2i ADCP. neutrophils were titrated and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. a\u2013e ADCP profile of neutrophils obtained from 5 different donors. anti-V3 mAb 2219 elicited the highest level of THP-1 cell ADCP. this activity was significantly higher than that of most other mAbs. this activity was significantly less potent than that of mAb 830A. a standard ELISA was performed using the same antigen used for ADCP assays. this protein was coated to the plate wells, and the same 7 mAbs tested for ADCP were titrated to assess their relative binding affinity for gp120. mAbs were titrated to assess their relative binding affinity for gp120. a\u2013c ADCP profiles of primary blood monocytes exhibit significant donor-to-donor variation. a\u2013c ADCP profiles of primary blood monocytes exhibit significant donor-to-donor variation. a\u2013c ADCP profiles of monocytes obtained from 3 different donors. the study of the capacity of HIV-specific mAbs and serum to mediate ADCP has become a standard assay. the study of the capacity of HIV-specific mAbs and serum to mediate ADCP has become a standard assay. no difference was observed between the V3 and V2i mAb groups. mAbs which were potent in the neutrophil assay were significantly less so in the THP-1 assay. donor-to-donor variation among the 3 samples tested prohibited a meaningful comparison with the other datasets. studies of Fc-mediated function against the influenza virus have shown that ab specificity is crucial for the induction of these functions. a recent analysis of HIV mAb 2F5 binding to its gp41 target epitope showed clear evidence of allosteric interactions between epitope binding and the Fc domain. ADCP assays using HIV-positive sera with both DMSO-treated HL-60 and primary neutrophils were compared. a more nuanced study using Abs of particular specificity would indicate the same. authors declare that they have no conflicts of interests."}
