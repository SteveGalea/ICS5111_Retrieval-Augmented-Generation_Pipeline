{"summary": "alphaviruses are icosahedral, enveloped, message-sense RNA viruses. determinants of alphavirus virulence are present in both structural and nonstructural proteins. changes in surface glycoprotein E2 and nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) most often associated with altered neurovirulence in mice (5\u201310) chikungunya virus (CHIKV) with nsP3 MD mutations resulting in little or no hydrolase or binding activity is not viable in either mammalian or insect cells. nsP3 MD function for neurovirulence and induction of adaptive antiviral immune responses in the CNS. multiple SINV MD mutants were characterized biochemically and assessed for replication in neural cells, neurovirulence, and immune responses in the central nervous system. RESULTS Development of mutations in the nsP3 MD and characterization of the effects on ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities of the nsP3 MD. PARP10CD was incubated with 32P-NAD+ to generate 32P-MARylated PARP10CD. assays were performed in triplicate, buffer control was subtracted, and values were normalized to the activity levels of nsP3 MD WT. the data are shown as the mean normalized fluorescence the SD. PARP10 (PARP10CD) was incubated with 32P-NAD+ to generate 32P-mono-ADP-ribosylated (MARylated) PARP10CD as a substrate for incubation with buffer alone, WT, or mutant nsP3 MDs for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the ability of the mutant nsP3 MDs to remove 32P-MAR from MARylated PARP10CD was quantified and isopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) coupling was used to introduce an alkyne at the 1\u2032\u2032 terminus of (ADPr)18. nsP3 MD WT binds to Cy5-(ADPr)18 with a KD of 44.49 2.46 M. affinities of nsP3 MD mutants for Cy5-(ADPr)18 were higher for Y114A (34.81 4.66 M) and infected cells were infected with nsP3 MD single mutations (N24A, G32A, G32E, and Y114A) or set of mutations (G32E/I113R/Y114N; TM) peak virus production was at 24 h for all viruses. at 12 h, the amount of infectious virus released was similar to WT for G32S, G32A, and N24A. cells were infected with SINV WT (TE strain) and nsP3 MD mutants N24A, G32A, G32E, G32S, Y114A, and TM (G32E/I113R/Y114N) at an MOI of 10. (A) Virus production was measured by plaque formation in Vero cells. the data are presented as means the SD obtained from three independent experiments. signs of disease appeared later (day 4) in mice infected with G32A, G32S, and TM than in mice infected with WT SINV or mutants N24A, G32E, and Y114A. disease was least severe in mice infected with G32A with 32% mortality (MDOD = 9.6, P 0.0001), G32S with 29% mortality (MDOD = 8.2, P 0.0001) and TM with 30% mortality (MDOD = 8.7, survival was 0% for mice infected with WT TE with a mean day of death. survival was 0% for N24A with MDOD of 6.4, 68.2% for G32A with MDOD of 9.6, 15% for G32E with MDOD 6, 70% for TM with MDOD of 8.7. nsP3 MD mutations reverted or developed compensatory mutations during in vivo CNS replication. reversion to G conferred WT virulence in mice. virulence similar to single mutant G32S. in the brain, all three viruses had similarly high levels of infectious virus 2 days after infection but differed in clearance (Fig. 4A). in the spinal cord, the amount of virus at day 2 was lower for G32S than for the WT and Y114A (P 0.0001) in the spinal cord, the amount of virus at day 2 was lower for G32S than for the WT and Y114A. RNA extracted from brain and spinal cord tissues was assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. data pooled from two independent experiments are presented as means the SD for eight mice for each time point per group. the brain levels of Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 mRNAs were higher in Y114A-infected mice than in either WT or G32S-infected mice. a subset of Parp mRNAs was increased after infection with generally higher levels induced by Y114A than WT or G32S infection. immunoblots of brain and spinal cord homogenates probed for PARP14. antibody against -actin was used for loading controls. effects of nsP3 MD mutations on IFN pathway activation. Rig-I and Mda5 were induced in all groups with higher levels of both mRNAs at day 2 in the brains of Y114A compared to WT- or G32S-infected mice (P 0.0001). the levels of alpha interferon (IFN-) and IFN- protein in homogenates of the brain and spinal cord were assessed. data pooled from two independent experiments are presented as means the SD for eight mice for each time point per group. significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison test. two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV TE or nsP3 MD mutants. antibody against -actin was used for loading controls. levels of pSTAT1 (Y701) and STAT1 (91- + 84-kDa band) were quantitated. data pooled from two independent experiments are presented as means the SD for eight mice for each time point per group. significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison test. fected mice throughout the infection and in the spinal cord at 4 days (P 0.0001). Y114A generally induced a more vigorous and sustained ISG response than G32S or WT virus infection (Fig. 5, 6A, and 7), perhaps associated with the generally higher levels and slower clearance of viral RNA. mRNA expression of Tlr3, Tlr7, Tlr8, and Tlr9 (A) and Il6, Il1 was measured by qRT-PCR. the CT values were normalized to Gapdh, and the fold change was calculated relative to day 0 (CT). data pooled from two independent experiments are presented as means the SD for eight mice per time point per group. levels of mRNAs for several cytokines and chemokines dependent on NF-B pathway signaling were examined. levels of all innate response gene mRNAs were generally highest at 2 days in Y114A-infected mice and lowest in G32S-infected mice. 114A-infected mice tended to have higher early levels of these cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in brain than WT mice and persistent expression in spinal cord. responses of nsP3 MD mutations were generally lower than WT-infected mice. gM (left panels) and IgG (right panels) show OD of serum (1:100 dilution) and 10% (wt/vol) brain and spinal cord homogenates (1:2 dilution) from four animals per group. significance was determined by multiple Student t tests using the Holm-Sidak method. -1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV TE or nsP3 MD mutants G32S and Y114A. mRNAs for Cd4, Cd8a, and Cd8b (A) and Ifn, Il10, Gbp1 and Gbp2 (B) were measured by qRT-PCR (upper panels, brain; lower panels, spinal cord) the levels of IFN-induced ISGs guanylate binding protein 1 and Gbp2 mRNAs at day 6 were lowest for WT-infected mice. the mRNA for regulatory cytokine Il10 increased after infection, with the highest levels in the brains of the mice. 3 mutants were assessed for MAR hydrolase activity (Fig. 1A and B) and ADPr-binding. PARP10CD was incubated with 32P-NAD+ to generate 32P-MARylated PARP10CD, which was incubated with buffer alone, nsP3 MDs from WT and mutants. us with Cy5 (10 nM) was incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of SINV WT and mutant MDs. the data are shown as the mean normalized fluorescence the SD. a free PAR chain labeled at the 1\u2032\u2032 terminus with a fluorescent probe could serve as a substrate for determining the binding affinity of the SINV nsP3 MDs for ADP-ribosylated substrates. 1-ethyl-3-(N,N-dimethylamino)isopropyl carbodiimide coupling was used to introduce an alkyne at the 1\u2032\u2032 terminus of (ADPr)18. Cy5-azide was then conjugated to alkyne-(ADPr)18 via Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition. nsP3 MD mutations were introduced into clones of the TE strain of SINV (5, 6), full-length viral RNA was transcribed and viruses recovered after transfection of RNA into BHK cells. all viruses could be rescued. lase activity and ADPr-binding resulted in selection for reversion to WT G or to the less impaired mutant S. the other mutations (N24A, G32S, G32A, and Y114A) were retained during replication in neural cells. NSC34 cells were infected with SINV WT and nsP3 MD mutants. the TE WT strain of SINV causes fatal encephalomyelitis in 2-week-old mice (52). to determine the role of the nsP3 MD in the pathogenesis of encephalomyelitis, we infected 2-week-old CD1 mice intracranially with 1,000 PFU of WT SINV. signs of disease appeared later (day 4) in mice infected with G32A, G32S, and TM than in mice infected with WT two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV WT or nsP3 MD mutants. survival was 0% for mice infected with WT TE with a mean day of death. survival was 0% for mice infected with WT TE with a mean day of death. P values were determined by multiple t tests using the Holm-Sidak method. the data are presented as means the SD for 10 mice per group. the effects of nsP3 MD mutations on virus replication and clearance from the CNS were assayed for SINV by plaque assay and for viral RNA by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in the brain, all three viruses had similarly high levels of infectious virus 2 days after infection but differed in clearance. two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV WT or nsP3 MD mutants. brain (A) and spinal cord (B) homogenates from four mice at each time point were assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. data pooled from two independent experiments are presented as means the SD for eight mice for each time point per group. expression of Parp1 mRNA changed little, but mRNAs for Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 were increased by infection. at 2 days after infection, the brain levels of Parp9, -10, -12, -13, and -14 mRNAs and the spinal cord levels of Parp14 mRNA were higher in Y114A-infected mice than in either WT or G32S-infected mice. parp10, and Parp12 (A) and of Parp13 and Parp14 (B) (upper panels, brain; lower panels, spinal cord) mRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR. CT values were normalized to Gapdh, and the fold change was calculated relative to samples from day 0 (CT) the expression of mRNAs for Rig-I and Mda5 was analyzed in the brains and spinal cords of infected mice. the levels of alpha interferon (IFN) and IFN- protein in homogenates of the brain and spinal cord were assessed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU SINV TE or nsP3 MD mutants. RNA was extracted from brain and spinal cord tissues. levels of Rig-I and Mda5 mRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR. cytoplasmic transcription factor activated by jak kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFN (71, 72), was examined by immunoblotting brain and spinal cord homogenates. CNS expression of STAT1 protein increased in response to infection by all three viruses. RNA extracted from brain and spinal cord tissues assayed for mRNA expression of Ifit1, Ifit2 and Isg15. CT values were normalized to Gapdh, and the fold change was calculated relative to infected controls at day 0 (CT). Isg15 mRNA was higher in brains of WT- and Y114A-infected mice than G32S-infected mice throughout the infection and in the spinal cord at 4 days. Y114A generally induced a more vigorous and sustained ISG response than G32S or WT virus infection (Fig. 5, 6A, and 7) two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV TE or nsP3 MD mutants. mRNA expression of Tlr3, Tlr7, Tlr8, and Tlr9 (A) and Il6, Il1, and Tnf (B) was measured by qRT-PCR. the CT values were normalized to Gapdh, and the fold change was calculated relative to day 0 (CT). mRNAs for several cytokines and chemokines dependent on NF-B pathway signaling were examined. levels of innate response gene mRNAs were generally highest at 2 days in Y114A-infected mice and lowest in Y114A-infected mice. levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) protein in the CNS also increased after infection. Y114A-infected mice tended to have higher early levels of these cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in brain than WT mice. responses of G32S-infected mice were generally lower than WT-infected mice. two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV TE and nsP3 MD mutants. serum (1:100 dilution) and 10% (wt/vol) brain and spinal cord homogenates (1:2 dilution) were tested for SINV-specific IgM and IgG. two-week-old CD-1 mice were inoculated intracranially with 1,000 PFU of SINV TE or nsP3 MD mutants. mRNAs for Cd4, Cd8a, and Cd8b (A) and Ifn, Il10, Gbp1 and Gbp2 (B) were measured by qRT-PCR (upper panels, brain; lower panels, spinal cord) cytokine mRNAs were measured as additional indicators of T cell responses in the CNS. ifn mRNA was highly induced in all animals, the level was lower in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with WT virus. expression of IFN-induced ISGs guanylate binding protein 1 (Gbp1) and Gbp2 mRNAs also increased in the brains and spinal cords of all mice. mutants showed that these activities are critical for different aspects of alphavirus replication in neuronal cells. initiation of infection is inefficient, but the amplification of replication complexes is impaired. mutations that eliminate ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities were similar to those observed for CHIKV. mutation of this critical binding residue leads to failure to synthesize viral RNA in neural cells. enzymatic activity per se is less critical for initiating alphavirus replication. mortality in 2-week-old mice was reduced from 100 to 84% in the present study. the amino acid at position 32 is a critical determinant of binding, as well as enzymatic, activity, and G is highly conserved for all viral MDs. VEEV, WEEV, and EEEV (51) mutants reverted during replication in NSC34 cells and in the nervous systems of mice. Y114A replicated as well or better than WT SINV in the CNS. initial control of SINV replication in the CNS is dependent on the innate immune response, particularly local production of type I IFN (77\u201379). nsP3 MD mutants were generated in the full-length double subgenomic clone of SINV TE (84) using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. the single mutations introduced were glutamine to alanine at position 24 (N24A), glycine to serine, alanine, or glutamate at 32 in the hydrolase loop (G32S, -A, or -E) and tyrosine viral RNAs were transcribed using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE high-yield capped RNA transcription kit (Invitrogen) the rescued virus was passaged once in BHK-21 cells. viral RNAs were purified using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) the lysate was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Talon Crude FF column (GE) the eluent was desalted on a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE) into binding buffer. the 6His-SENP SUMO tag was cleaved by incubation with 6His-SENP SUMO protease for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. excess 32P NAD+ was removed by desalting by gravity flow in a micro bio-spin column (Bio-Rad) into demodification buffer. MARylated PARP10CD was then incubated with equimolar amounts of MD proteins for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. 2-propinyloxy)ethylamine (TCI America) incubated at 50\u00b0C for 1 h. reaction precipitated with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol. pellet was washed twice with ice-cold 70% ethanol. MST analyses were conducted as previously described (86) with minor adjustments. defined-length PAR prepared as described previously (86) was labeled on the 1\u2032\u2032 terminus with Cy5 (10 nM) and incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intracranially with 103 PFU of virus diluted in 10 l of PBS. all pups within a litter were infected with the same virus. mice were monitored for signs of disease twice daily for 14 days. qRT-PCR was performed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit. cDNA was synthesized with random primers using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit. the CT method was used to determine relative gene expression. tetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]-3\u2032(Applied Biosystems) and primers to the SINV nsp2 gene were quantified using a standard curve made from 10-fold dilutions of a pCRII-TOPO plasmid. the data are plotted as SINV RNA copies/106 copies of Gapdh. antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:1,000 in PBST plus 10% FBS for 2 h at room temperature. the secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Cell).
