{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common cause of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection (LTRI) in children under five years of age, worldwide. 80% of vaccinees who were infected required hospitalization compared to 5% of the control group. the most common adjuvant, alum, comprised of aluminum salts, has been used in humans since 1932. the most common adjuvant, alum, comprised of aluminum salts, has been used in humans since 1932. it is approved for human use by the FDA and is a component of numerous licensed vaccines. Montanide emulsions have been used in experimental human vaccines against HIV, malaria and breast cancer. each adjuvant has unique characteristics and mechanisms, and their impact on the immune response induced by a particular immunogen generally needs to be determined experimentally. polyanionic high mol. weight acrylic acid TLR4 agonist and controlled release of antigen. polyanionic high mol. weight acrylic acid TLR4 agonist and controlled release of antigen. Alhydrogel (Alum) was purchased from Brenntag, Denmark, AddaVax, Monophosphoryl Lipid A-SM (MPLA) and Poly (I:C) were purchased from Invivogen, Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS) and Adjuplex were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Carbopol was a gift from A.M. Salazar, Oncovir,. Montanide ISA 71 VG was a gift from Seppic, France. bovine RSV F DS-Cav1 was expressed by transfection of Expi293F cells using 293Fectin and purified using IMAC, Strep-Tactin affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. all animals were housed and cared for in accordance with local, state, federal, and institute policies. all immunizations were given intramuscularly. each animal received in total 100l of PBS containing 10 g of DS-Cav1 immunogen. a control group with no adjuvant was also included in the study. two groups of seven mice pre-immunized multiple times with DS-Cav1: Poly (I:C) formulation were immunized twice with DS-Cav1 formulated with Alum and SAS + Carbopol after a waiting period of 83 weeks. mKate-RSV expressing prototypic subtype A (strain A2) F genes and the Katushka fluorescent protein were constructed. HEp-2 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (10% EMEM) EC50 of neutralization of sample was calculated by curve fitting using GraphPad Prism 6 software. BRSV microneutralization assay was performed using 500\u20131,000 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) of bRSV, strain 375 (ATCC VR1339) and BT cells (ATCC CRL1390) a series of scouting experiments at different sera dilutions, buffer conditions and sensor tips were performed to minimize non-specific binding. initial assays using sera from 10 groups of mice that had been immunized with DS-Cav1: adjuvant formulations as well as the pre-bleed sera with the three pre-fusion specific and two post fusion specific probes were performed at 30\u00b0C. ELISA Maxisorp plates were coated with DS-Cav1 at 1g/ml in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. pre-bleed sera from each group was included as a negative control. anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a-conjugated with horse radish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies. cell lines, resins and proteases Expi293F cells and 293fectin were purchased from Thermo Fisher scientific, Ni Sepharose Excel and Strep-Tactin Superflow resins. Restriction grade thrombin was obtained from Novagen. 93F cells were purified using 293Fectin and purified using IMAC, Strep-Tactin affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. all animals were housed and cared for in accordance with local, state, federal, and institute policies. the calf experiment was performed under the regulations of the United Kingdom Home Office Scientific Procedures Act (1986) in 100l inoculant with 50 g (5 fold w/w) of Poly (IC:LC) for the poly (IC:LC) group. in 100l inoculant with 20 g (2 fold w/w) of Monophosphoryl Lipid A for the MPLA group. in 100l inoculant with 100 g (10 fold w/w) of Alum for the Alum group. two injection sites in the semimembranosus muscle of both pelvic limbs were used for each immunization. no adverse effect from immunization was observed. calves were vaccinated intramuscularly with 50 g of bRSV F DS-Cav1 adjuvant mixtures. fetal bovine serum (10% EMEM), supplemented with glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. a fluorescence plate reader neutralization assay was performed using 500\u20131,000 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) of bRSV. immune sera were serially diluted in quadruplicates prior to mixing with 500\u20131000 TCID50 of bRSV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. cells were then incubated for 7 days, fixed with 70% methanol, stained with 1% crystal violet and examined at the microscope for syncytia formation and cytopathic effect. three pre-fusion specific and two post fusion specific probes were performed at 30\u00b0C in tilted black 384-well plates. agitation set to 1,000 rpm in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and a well volume of 55 l. all experiments were performed in duplicate and included 6\u201310 mice samples per group based on sera availability. ELISA was performed in duplicate and included 6\u201310 mice samples per group. endpoint titers were averaged and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with a combination of SAS, a TLR4 agonist and Carbopol. titers for control unadjuvanted DS-Cav1 were below the protective threshold [10] and at the level of detection. p values for SAS + Carbopol/DS-Cav1 versus the other eight adjuvant formulations are shown. p = > 0.05 (ns); p 0.05 (*); p 0.01 (**); p 0.001 (***) are shown. sera from all groups exhibited reduced binding to DS-Cav1 site KO. no significant difference was observed in sera from the Alum, MPLA, MPLA + Alum and AddaVax groups. p values for DS-Cav1 versus DS-Cav1 site, site II KO probes and Post-F probes were used as control. p values for DS-Cav1 versus DS-Cav1 site, site II KO probes and post-F probes were assessed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. MPLA and MPLA + Alum adjuvant formulations were not sufficient to influence the IgG response towards a Th1 phenotype. the Alum adjuvant formulations stimulated primarily the expected IgG1 with some IgG2a response for Alum alone. the ratio indicated a significantly greater Th2-biased response for DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum. DS-Cav1-adjuvant mixtures were used to immunize two groups of elderly mice. each group had been pre-immunized prior to 12 weeks of age with DS-Cav1-Poly (I:C) formulation. a single boost with DS-Cav1 with Alum formulation increased the neutralization titers to the week five level. p values were determined by two-tailed matched-pairs signed rank test. p values were determined by two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. p values were determined by two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. pre-immunized elderly mice (85 weeks wait) were administered (A) DS-Cav1 formulated with SAS + Carbopol or (B) DS-Cav1 formulated with Alum and recognition of DS-Cav1, DS-Cav1 site KO, DS-Cav1 site II KO, Post F and post F site II KO probes by sera for all immunized mice assessed. DS-Cav1-Poly (I:C) adjuvant formulation induced a balanced IgG1/IgG2a response in nave mice. pre-immunized elderly mice (85 weeks wait) were administered DS-Cav1 formulated with SAS + Carbopol or Alum. bovine DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with ISA 71 VG and ISA 71 VG-Carbopol formulations. no significant difference was observed in neutralization titers from the ISA 71 VG and ISA 71 VG plus Carbopol groups. DS-Cav1-adjuvant formulations were used to immunize 10 groups of 10 CB6F1/J mice. for each group, 10 g of DS-Cav1 was formulated with nine different adjuvants. after two immunizations, in the week five sera, significantly higher EC50 neutralization titers were observed in mice immunized with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, TLR3 ted with Alum (p = 0.0136) or the TLR3 agonists Poly (I:C) (p = 0.0028), or Poly (IC:LC) (p = 0.0025), respectively. the TLR4 agonist present as a component in SAS and SAS + Carbopol adjuvants helped elicit the highest immune response among the nine adjuvant groups. sera reactivity was directed towards pre-fusion specific antigenic site on DS-Cav1 or antigenic site II that is present in both pre- and post-fusion forms of RSV F protein. sera reactivity for five groups corresponding to poly (I:C), poly (IC:LC), SAS, SAS + Carbopol and Adjuplex showed the greatest response to DS-Cav1 site KO. sera from mice immunized with DS-Cav1-adjuvant mixtures exhibit differential antibody responses to sites and II KO probes. antigenic site, a major target of neutralizing antibodies (e.g. D25) and antigenic site II present in both conformations of RSV F are shown on the pre- and post-F structures. unadjuvanted DS-Cav1 induced a marginal IgG1 response. DS-Cav1 formulations with Alum induced a primarily IgG1 response. DS-Cav1 formulations with SAS, SAS + Carbopol, poly (I:C) and poly (IC: LC) induced both an IgG1 and IgG2a response. DS-Cav1-adjuvant formulations elicit antibodies of different IgG subclass in immunized mice. sera from nave mice primed and boosted with DS-Cav1 adjuvant mixtures. p-values were determined using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. lum formulation increased the neutralization titers to the week five level (p = 0.0313) and titers did not increase after a second immunization at week 93. titers increased from the waned response (p = >0.05) but remained lower than the initial response observed in young mice. a) DS-Cav1 and Post F probes with KO mutations in antigenic site. b) DS-Cav1 and Post F probes with KO mutations in antigenic site II. sera responses to the pre- and post-f probes exhibited a profile nearly identical to the neutralization titers. elderly mice immunized with DS-Cav1 adjuvant formulations elicited a balanced IgG1 and IgG2a subclass response pattern. elderly mice immunized with alum-adjuvanted DS-Cav1 retained the IgG subclass response pattern observed in young mice. the ratios of IgG1 to IgG2a for each animal in the groups were calculated from the upper panel. p values were determined by two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. pre-F bovine RSV F DS-Cav1 formulated with two adjuvants was used to immunize mice and calves. cattle were administered with an analogous water in oil emulsion, ISA 71 VG-DS-Cav1 formulation and ISA 71 VG + Carbopol\u2013DS-Cav1 formulation. alum, SAS, SAS + Carbopol, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC) were significantly higher EC50 neutralization titers in six groups of mice immunized with DS-Cav1. unadjuvanted DS-Cav1 titers were below the protective threshold. responses reflect respective T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 cell (Th2)-biased immune response patterns in mice [42]. Interestingly, SAS, SAS + Carbopol, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC) groups induced a balanced Th1/Th2 IgG response. adjuvants play less of a role in determining responses following a boost in pre-immune animals than they do in the inductive event following a primary immunization. addition of Carbopol to the adjuvant ISA 71 VG did not appear to enhance the antibody response in calves. if the dose of a stabilized pre-F antigen is reduced to very low levels to induce a subprotective antibody response, it is possible to simulate the pattern of lung inflammation seen with less effective vaccines [52]. just using the correct conformation of a vaccine antigen and redirecting antibody to neutralization-sensitive sites may not be sufficient, even with Th1-biased adjuvants.
