{"summary": "a closer examination of individual factors constituting these pathways shows a different conservation status between different animal species. a closer examination of individual factors constituting these pathways shows a different conservation status between different animal species. secreted IFN molecules bind to cell-surface receptors and initiate signal transduction involving the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\u2013STAT) pathway. this pathway induces the transcription of a major antiviral program composed of hundreds of so-called IFN-stimulated genes that comprise effectors of the cell-autonomous antiviral defense. depicted is the presence of selected innate immune factors in representative species from Metazoa and Bilateria starting from Porifera up until Mammalia. we will focus on the conserved pathways responsible for sensing viral PAMPs, signaling and inducing antiviral genes upon infection in animals. we will then zoom in on two important viral nucleic acid receptor families. emergence of IFN-I and a recombinational adaptive immune system seems to coincide with the loss of RNAi as the main antiviral mechanism in somatic cells. emergence of IFN-I and a recombinational adaptive immune system seems to coincide with the loss of RNAi as the main antiviral mechanism in somatic cells. somatic DNA recombination in specialized cells provided jawed vertebrates with large repertoire of major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), T-cell receptors (TCRs) and immunoglobulins (Igs) agnathans (jawless vertebrates), including lampreys and hagfish, have also evolved an equivalent adaptive immune system with specialized lymphocytes termed, VLRA, VLRB and VLRC cells. the innate immunity field has experienced in the last three decades. vertebrates share with other invertebrate animals specialized phagocytic cells. these cells establish an immediate and general inflammatory response translated into an antimicrobial and/or antiviral state. the machineries responsible for these responses transcend this group. double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activated protein kinase R (PKR); adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) also contribute to innate immunity. these also recognize viral signatures; however, their main function is not necessarily to induce a transcriptional immune response. RNA Viruses Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is a potent TLR7 and TLR8 ligand. TLR3 is specific for dsRNA, while TLR3 is specific for dsRNA. all RNA viruses are thought to produce dsRNA intermediates as part of their replication cycle. the last member of the RLR family, LGP2 has RNA binding but no signaling domains and is thought to regulate RIG-I and MDA5 signaling. DNA substrates have also been shown to be able to activate the RLR pathway through polymerase III-transcribed RNA [60,61,62] all RNA viruses are thought to produce dsRNA intermediates as part of replication cycle. both ssRNA and dsRNA viruses have the potential to be sensed by TLR3. most RNA viruses have been shown to be detected by RIG-I or MDA5. cytosolic recognition of viral RNA is almost exclusively mediated by RLRs. several proteins have been proposed to play a role in DNA sensing. but only cGAS knock-outs can shut down IFN production in response to cytosolic DNA. TRIF recruits the ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated factor 3) through an ubiquitination mechanism. the TRIF/TBK1 complex is then able to phosphorylate the transcription factor IRF3, triggering its dimerization and nuclear translocation. TRIF can also recruit RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1) that leads to the activ RLR signaling RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2) are characterized by a central DEAD-box helicase/ATPase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD) essential for RNA recognition and autorepression in the absence of RNA ligands. Upon RNA binding RIG-I is remodeled into an active conformation in which the CTD and helicase domains organize into a ring around the RNA MAVS aggregates then recruit several E3 ubiquitin ligases including TRAF, TRAF5 and TRAF6. the ubiquitin sensor NEMO (NF-B essential modulator), also known as IKK, is then recruited to the MAVS/TRAFs complex. cGAS-STING is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein with cytoplasmic C- and N-termini. cGAS preferentially binds longer DNA (>45 bp) as a dimer to form stable protein-DNA ladder networks responsible for strong cGAMP production. 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP is a potent STING ligand and has a higher affinity to this protein than other cGAMP molecules containing different phosphodiester linkages. this intercellular transfer of free or packaged cGAMP permits uninfected cells to mount a preventive IFN TLR signals RNA ligands cause endosomal transmembrane TLR3, 7 and 8 to dimerize and then to oligomerize through their cytoplasmic TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domains. TRIF recruits adaptor protein TRIF (tIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-) IRF7, IRF5 and NF-kB translocate to the nucleus to induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the activation of TLR8 recruits the adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) through a series of phosphorylations and the help of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. poly-ubiquitination reaction by ubiquitin ligases like Riplet and TRIM25 is thought to enhance oligomerization and activation. MAVS has been shown to be critical for mounting an efficient immune response to infection by several RNA viruses. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident membrane protein with cytoplasmic C- and N-termini. cGAS is an enzyme that contains a nucleotidyltransferase domain. it can synthesize the second messenger 2\u20323\u2032-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP. cGAMP second messengers can also travel to neighboring cells through gap-junctions [114] or after being packaged in newly formed virions. this intercellular transfer of free or packaged cGAMP permits uninfected cells to mount a preventive IFN response, protecting them from infection or providing a faster response to DNA viruses that encode cGAS antagonists. ten TLRs in humans can respond to many bacterial and viral PAMPs. prototypical TLRs contain three structural elements, a hydrophobic ectodomain, a transmembrane domain and a TIR domain. both developmental and immunological roles of TLRs have been described in Cnidarian species. 211 TLRs belong to a greatly expanded set of genes with vertebrate like features, many of which seem to have duplicated recently. the high prevalence of pseudogenes (25% to 30%) among those might reflect a history of strong positive selective pressures. the pacific oyster Crassotrea gigas encodes for 83 TLRs in total. the families responsible for sensing of viral PAMPs are the TLR3 family, which recognizes dsRNA, the TLR7 family (including TLRs 7, 8 and 9) and the large TLR11 family (TLR11, 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 26) the reduced number of TLRs in vertebrates does not mean that the TLR-response in those species cannot be tailored to a particular environment. a more recent study challenges this view and finds that the RLR-based immunity originated in the earliest multicellular animals [14]. the authors were able to identify full-length RLRs in early-branching animal genomes, including Porifera (e.g., sponges) and Cnidaria (e.g., jellyfish), but were unable to identify RLRs in non-metazoan eukaryotes. RAF6, TBK1 and IRF family proteins have been shown to have functional antiviral roles. this is illustrated by the lineage-specific loss of RLR genes in many species. eloquent example illustrating the dynamic evolution of these receptors is the loss of all RLR genes (RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2) in insects. the cGAS-STING Pathway, a new\u2013Old Axis STING presence in animal genomes, is probably more ancient than that of RLRs. the cGAS-STING Pathway, a new\u2013old Axis STING presence in animal genomes is probably more ancient than that of RLRs. the lack of a CTT domain in invertebrates does not mean that STING could not have an immune function in these animals. the second indication that STING lacking a CTT could function in immunity comes from arthropods. an extension of this domain in ray-finned fish species elicits a dramatic enhancement of NF-kB activation and weaker IRF3-IFN signaling. a highly conserved and functionally important serine residue (S358) in STING\u2019s CTT domain is lost in bats [168]. cGAS evolved zinc ribbon motif to detect DNA and STING evolved the CTT domain that expanded its signaling potential. several evasion strategies and immune antagonisms by animal viruses have been described [174,175,176,177,178] viral strategies curb sensing and signaling by TLRs, RLRs and cGAS-STING in animals. vaccinia virus protein A46R targets specific TIR-domain-containing adaptor proteins. HTLV-1 encoded viral protein p30 is also able to interfere with TLR4-dependent signaling. LASV from the Arenaviridae family evolved a unique strategy in which its nucleoprotein (NP) acquired a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity, that enables it to digest free dsRNA, preventing the activation of RIG-I. many viruses encode proteases that directly cleave RLRs. 71, NS3\u2013NS4A from HCV, 2Apro and 3Cpro from rhinovirus and 3Cpro from coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) can trigger a selective form of autophagy, called mitophagy, responsible for the degradation of mitochondria. another example of indirect MAVS degradation comes from studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues keeps RIG-I and MDA5 in an inactive state. PP1 phosphatases are recruited to dephosphorylate specific marks on those receptors. they are sequestered away from MDA5 and RIG-I. viruses use numerous strategies to escape cGAS-STING-dependent detection. several KSHV proteins (e.g., ORF52 and LANA) can sequestrate stimulatory DNA or directly bind to cGAS inhibiting its enzymatic activity. the NS3 protease of DENV, together with its NS2B co-factor, has been shown to target the residues 93\u201396 of human STING, leading to its cleavage and degradation. the NS3/4A protease of HCV and the 3C proteases of several picornaviruses can all recognize and proteolytically cleave TRIF, producing TRIF fragments that are unable to signal. deNV replicates in convoluted membranes of the ER concealing its dsRNA intermediates from the cytosol and thus prevents the activation of RLRs. many viruses encode proteases that directly cleave RLRs. the 3Cpro proteases of both poliovirus and EV71 cleave RIG-I. the 2Apro of EV71 cleaves MDA5. viruses encode deubiquitinating enzymes to remove the Lys63-linked ubiquitination off RIG-I. other viruses encode deubiquitinating enzymes to remove the Lys63-linked ubiquitination off RIG-I. phosphorylation of PP1 phosphatases is recruited to dephosphorylate specific marks on those receptors and activate them. HBV polymerase can bind to STING to block its Lys63-linked ubiquitination, inhibiting the production of IFN-. cGAS is expressed in human hepatocytes and is able to sense and signal upon transfection of naked-circular HBV DNA. KSHV, another DNA virus, has been shown to act on both cGAS and STING. new genomics data and gene editing tools can now let us interrogate PRR-like pathways in poorly studied animal species. studying the evolution of immune components and their interplay with viral pathogens is extremely important since our immune responses to contemporary viruses have been shaped by our evolutionary responses to previous infections. studying the biological arms race between host and virus, in which each entity maintains a relatively constant fitness cost, will be instrumental in the fight against future infections."}
