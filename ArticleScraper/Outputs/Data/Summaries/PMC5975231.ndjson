{"summary": "leukocytes constitute the second largest class of cells found within the intestine, second only to epithelial cells. the LP harbors adaptive immune cells such as T cells and B cells, as well as innate immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and eosinophils. restoration of epithelial integrity and eradication of invading microbes are orchestrated through the activity of cytokines and chemokines. intestinal cytokine responses comprise complex signaling networks, wherein cytokines regulate one another. cytokines are secreted proteins that play an important role in intercellular communication. IL-17 and IL-22 are leukocyte-derived cytokines that primarily impact epithelial cells in tissues such as the gut, the lung and the skin. IL-17 belongs to the IL-17 cytokine family, whereas IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family. the IL-17 receptor family now consists of five members (IL-17RA, RB, RC, RD and RE) IL-17RA is expressed on a wide range of tissues and cell types. IL-17RA is expressed on a wide range of tissues and cell types. IL-22R1 is expressed on intestinal and respiratory epithelial cells, on keratinocytes and on hepatocytes. IL-22 binds first to IL-22R1, then the IL-22\u2013IL-22R1 complex binds IL-10R2 to propagate downstream signals. IL-22 signals through the JAK-STAT pathway, inducing phosphorylation of the kinases JAK1 and TYK2. IL-17 secreted by a subset of CD4+ T cells called Th17 cells. cytokines IL-22 and IL-21 also secreted by CD4+ T cells. cell type Cytokine secreted Transcription factor Surface phenotype. CCR4+, CCR6+, CXCR3, CD161+, IL23R+ Human and mouse studies Cosmi et al. (2008); Park et al. (2008) Tc22 IL-22 Unknown (AHR\") CD4+, CCR4+, CCR6+, CCR10+ Human Eyerich et al. (2009) cells IL-17, IL-22 AP1 CD27, CD28, NKP80+, CD45RA+ IL-17 and IL-22 are regulated by PRR-dependent pathways. innate immune system is crucial for controlling infectious agents. host recognizes general pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), initiating a response that limits the pathogen. polysaccharide, a major component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall, recognizes bacterial surface lipoproteins. TLR9, which is located in the membrane of cellular organelles known as endosomes, recognizes non-methylated CpG sequences present in bacterial DNA. bacterial stimulation of TLR4 on DCs results in IL-23 production. IL-23, in turn, triggers rapid production of IL-17 and IL-22 by T cells. the resulting secreted IL-17 originates from T cells. IL-23 stimulates T cells in the murine intestinal mucosa to produce IL-17 and IL-22. the TLR/IL-23/IL-17 axis is also an important player in vaccine-induced protection. all TLRs except TLR3 require MyD88 as an adaptor to mediate signal transduction. Myd88/ mice exhibit reduced innate mucosal IL-17 response during infection with Chlamydia muridarum. in a T-cell transfer model of colitis, Myd88/ CD4+ T cells express lower levels of IL-17 than wild-type CD4+ T cells. if myD88-dependent regulation of T-cell-induced colitis is due to TLR signaling or IL-1 family cytokine signaling remains unclear. NOD receptors recognize fragments of peptidoglycan; specifically, NOD1 recognizes -D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP), a molecule produced by Gram-negative bacteria (Chamaillard et al.2003; Girardin et al.2003a,b) several NLRs have a role in inflammatory diarrhea. the NLRC4 inflammasome is activated by flagellin (Franchi et al.2006; Miao et al.2006) and the inner rod proteins of type III secretion systems (Miao et al.2010). IL-1 produced by NLRP3 inflammasome activity has mediate a protective Th17 response against the E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin in mice. IL-17 and IL-22-producing cells in response to acute infection T helper cells. the most characterized IL-17/IL-22-secreting cells are T helper 17 (Th17) cells. this T-cell population is abundant at homeostasis in gut-associated tissues. monoassociation of germ-free mice with commensal microbes is sufficient to induce Th17-cell development. IL-22 derived from group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) seems to potentiate expression of SAAs by intestinal epithelial cells. the Th17 response is a crucial arm of mucosal immunity against bacterial pathogens in the lung and the intestine. in the GI tract, Th17 cells increase host resistance against Helicobacter pylori, C. rodentium and S. Typhimurium. LP CD4+ T cells express IL-17 and IL-22 during the innate phase of infection with S. Typhimurium and C. rodentium. two new subsets of Th17 cells have recently been identified. a proinflammatory subset that produces GM-CSF and a regulatory subset that produces IL-10. a population of CD8+ T cells produces IL-17, but not IL-17 (Tc22 cells) there is evidence for a subgroup of CD8+ T cells that produces IL-22. T cells are an innate immune cell population that plays important roles at the mucosal barrier. peritoneal IL-17A was found as early as 1 h after infection (maximal production at 6 h) large amounts of neutrophils were recruited by 24 h post-infection. in the skin, IL-17A-producing skin cells play a critical role in the immune response against this pathogen. IL-17RA and IL-23 are required to control L. monocytogenes systemic infections. T cells are the principal source of IL-17A early in infection. CD48 T cells also produce IL-17A in the peritoneum. IL-17A-producing T cells can secrete IL-17 and IL-22 in response to IL-1 and/or IL-23. despite their small numbers, T cells can have large effects on the type of immune response and the disease outcome. antigenic priming is not required for activation of LTi, LTi-like, NKp46+ ILCs and probably T cells. IL-23 stimulation is often sufficient for inducing IL-17 and IL-22 secretion by these cell types. NKp46+ cells were first identified as a major source of IL-22 in the intestine. LT is a member of the TNF core family and plays a critical role in regulation of mucosal immune responses. LT regulates DCs and CD4+ T-cell homeostasis in the steady state. mice deficient in the LT pathway are also more susceptible to C. rodentium infection. the most characterized IL-17/IL-22-secreting cells are T helper 17 (Th17) cells. the most characterized IL-17/IL-22-secreting cells are T helper 17 (Th17) cells (Korn et al.2009) monoassociation of germ-free mice with commensal microbes of the class Clostridiales is sufficient to induce Th17-cell development. a recent study suggests that intimate adhesion of SFB to the epithelium is important for Th17-cell development. the Th17 response is a crucial arm of mucosal immunity against bacterial pathogens in the lung and the intestine. these cells mediate protection in a number of models of lung infection, including K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri and several Mycobacterium species. rodentium has subsequently been identified and termed innate Th17 (iTh17) cells. a proinflammatory subset that produces GM-CSF (Codarri et al.2011; El-Behi et al.2011) and a regulatory subset that produces IL-10. T cells are an innate immune cell population that plays important roles at the mucosal barrier. they secrete IL-17 and/or IL-22 when stimulated with IL-23, IL-1, or with a cocktail of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. early production of IL-17A was observed during E. coli infection. IL-17A production by peritoneal T cells is rapidly induced after injection of heat-killed mycobacteria or after sepsis due to cecal puncture. cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus infections, IL-17A-producing skin cells play a critical role in the immune response against this pathogen. bacterial numbers in the liver are more than 100-fold higher than in wild-type mice. IL-17RA and IL-23 are required to control L. monocytogenes systemic infections. T cells are the principal source of IL-17A early in infection. CD48 T cells also produce IL-17A in the peritoneum. a non-T-cell source for IL-22 was first demonstrated in a C. rodentium infection model. wild-type mice and mice that lack B and T cells showed comparable IL-22 production and normal host defense during the early phase of infection. ILC3s can secrete IL-17 and IL-22 in response to IL-1 and/or IL-23. antigenic priming is not required for activation of LTi, LTi-like, NKp46+ ILCs and probably T cells. IL-23 stimulation is often sufficient for inducing IL-17 and IL-22 secretion by these cell types. some of these NKp46+ cells also express CD11c, an intergrin highly expressed by DCs. LT regulates DCs and CD4+ T-cell homeostasis in the steady state. LT also regulates DCs and CD4+ T-cell homeostasis in the steady state. mice deficient in the LT pathway are also more susceptible. IL-17 and IL-22 production by neutrophils appears to be dependent on the infection model. future studies are needed to further elucidate whether IL-17 and IL-22 production contributes to the host response to infection. IL-17 and IL-22 act in concert to orchestrate the mucosal barrier. the biological effects of these cytokines differ in many aspects. IL-17 is a novel type of immune mediator that increases immune defenses of tissue cells. mice infected with C. rodentium mount protective IL-17 responses. disruption of IL-17 or its receptor leads to exacerbated bacterial burden. disease susceptibility resulting from defective induction of CXC chemokines. IL-17 mediates stronger inflammatory responses by inducing other proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of neutrophils. cytokine family targets epithelial cells to induce antimicrobial responses against extracellular pathogens. IL-22 is a gut commensal bacterium that causes bacteremia and endocarditis. IL-22 helps to maintain and restore epithelial barrier function after infection. IL-22 also promotes the production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, SAA and LPS-binding protein. IL-22 stimulates the production of protective mucins from goblet cells. REG3 is a soluble C-type lectin produced by paneth cells and epithelial cells. it exerts its antimicrobial activity by interacting directly with the bacterial cell wall. a synthetic ligand for TLR-7 induces IL-22 expression, restoring REG3 and reestablishing colonization resistance against VRE in antibiotic-treated mice. IL-22 induces an increase of C3 expression and secretion in the liver, which is mediated by the STAT3 pathway. IL-22 favors S. Typhimurium colonization by inducing antimicrobial proteins that sequester metal ions. both H. pylori-infected humans and mice exhibit an overabundance of IL-22 (Zhuang et al.2015), which stimulates gastric epithelial cells to secrete CXCL2. IL-17 stimulates target cells to produce neutrophil chemoattractants such as the CXC chemokines IL-8 (CXCL8), CXCL1 and CXCL2, as well as growth factors. administration of recombinant IL-17 into IL-17-deficient mice restored neutrophilia at sites of inoculation. Neutrophils are also an important first line of mucosal defense against S. Typhimurium. IL-17 and IL-22 are upregulated in response to infection with a variety of pathogens. IL-17 mediates stronger inflammatory responses by inducing other proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of neutrophils. cytokine family targets epithelial cells to induce antimicrobial responses against extracellular pathogens. IL-22 helps to maintain and restore epithelial barrier function after infection. IL-22 also promotes the production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, SAA and LPS-binding protein (Wolk et al.2007; Dalmas et al.2014; Sano et al.2015). IL-22 stimulates the production of protective mucins from goblet cells. REG3 is a soluble C-type lectin produced by paneth cells. it exerts its antimicrobial activity by interacting directly with the bacterial cell wall. a synthetic ligand for TLR-7 induces IL-22 expression, restoring REG3 and reestablishing colonization resistance against VRE in antibiotic-treated mice. IL-22 induces an increase of C3 expression and secretion in the liver, which is mediated by the STAT3 pathway. IL-22 favors S. Typhimurium colonization by inducing antimicrobial proteins that sequester metal ions. both H. pylori-infected humans and mice exhibit an overabundance of IL-22 (Zhuang et al.2015), which stimulates gastric epithelial cells to secrete CXCL2. CXCL2 then recruits myeloid-derived suppressor cells that produce the proinflammatory proteins S100A8 and S100A9 and inhibit Th1 cell responses. IL-17 and IL-22 have been shown to play a critical role in maintaining cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 provide barrier integrity against extracellular pathogens. the cytokine upstream of both pathways are clinical targets for multiple inflammatory diseases. the antibody ustekinumab neutralizes the p40 subunit of IL-23 and IL-12. inhibition of IL-17A or IL-17RA in patients with Crohn's disease does not phenocopy effects observed with a p40 or p19 inhibitor. conflict of interest.none declared."}
