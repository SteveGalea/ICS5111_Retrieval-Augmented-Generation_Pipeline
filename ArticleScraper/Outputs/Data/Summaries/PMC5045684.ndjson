{"summary": "study aimed to determine knowledge, attitude and practice of airborne and droplet isolation precautions. a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 406 dental health professionals (DHPs) working in selected dental facilities in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. is a viral respiratory disease caused by the corona virus MERS-CoV. this is a novel virus belonging to genus Beta coronavirus. it was first reported in kingdom of Saudi Arabia in september 2012. dental health professionals (DHPs) and patients are at high risk of infections from different types of bacteria (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, Staphylococci) virus. occurrence of asymptomatic and subclinical MERS-CoV cases in population could pose a huge threat to dental practice by transmitting infections between dentist and patients. list of private hospitals and polyclinics providing dental care in Riyadh city was obtained by using health insurance provider network. list of universities providing dental care was also prepared. list of government armed forces dental care facilities also prepared. authors and subsequently a pilot study was conducted on a sample of 50 DHPs by using modified version of the questionnaire to ensure comprehensibility and reliability. a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.80 was obtained which was deemed satisfactory for conducting this study. inferential statistics of Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests were applied to study variables. p value of 0.05 was considered significant for all statistical purposes. ds should be notified prior to receiving a patient requiring airborne precautions. ds should be notified prior to receiving a patient requiring droplet precautions. frequency of correct response for practice section was lowest for the 2nd, 6th and 11th questions. practice score significantly differed between dental students and dental assistants. however attitude did not differ significantly among DHPs. but practice score significantly differed between dental students and dental assistants. education materials posted on the website of the ministry of health during the outbreak of MERS CoV could be one of the major sources of knowledge among health professionals including DHPs. seminar, symposium and research articles could be the source of knowledge about isolation precautions among dental health professionals during the outbreak. lowest response was observed for the question Wards should be notified prior to receiving a patient requiring airborne precautions indicating room for improvement. this indicates good practice towards isolation precaution measure prescribed by CDC. previous studies had shown a mean practice score of 2.68 3.16 and 6.883.51 respectively (9,10) most of DHPs show compliance towards infection control practices as per their needs. this is the first study to report the level of knowledge, attitude and practices of DHPs toward airborne and droplet isolation precautions during the MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia."}
