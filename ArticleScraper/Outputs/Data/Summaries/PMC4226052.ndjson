{"summary": "Scientific Knowledge on the Subject People with asthma are more likely to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms because of a cold (i.e., an upper respiratory tract infection) there is no specific antiviral treatment that can prevent upper respiratory tract infection\u2013induced asthma exacerbations. patients responded to text messages inquiring about symptoms of cold. if they met the preset criteria for an URTI, they attended the research units within 24 hours to begin treatment with inhaled IFN- or placebo. patients received their daily treatment of IFN- or placebo for a total of 14 days. uterol (12% and 200 ml), bronchial hyperresponsiveness (at screening or historical), emergency admission, or attendance at primary care or out-of-hours clinics for worsening asthma. patients entered the treatment phase if they fulfilled criteria: (1) URTI symptoms within the last 24 hours presenting as cold symptoms (blocked or runny nose and a sore or scratchy throat) or influenza-like illness. text messages switched to questions from the JCSQ and four questions from the Asthma Index Questionnaire. the ACQ-6 was completed by telephone interview on Day 1 (as treatment baseline) and on treatment Day 8. qPCR was used to quantify RV virus load and antiviral biomarkers. study design was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial of IFN- (SNG001) involving patients with a history of URTI-induced exacerbations. the primary endpoint was the comparison of the mean change from baseline to Day 8 in ACQ-6 in the modified intention-to-treat population. patients responded daily to text messages inquiring about symptoms of cold. patients received 6 mIU of IFN-1a from a portable mesh nebulizer delivered over 3\u20134 minutes. included: age 18\u201365 years, asthma symptoms for greater than or equal to 2 years confirmed by history and one of either FEV1 reversibility to albuterol (12% and 200 ml) and emergency admission. ICS since screening, and (4) post-bronchodilator FEV1 greater than or equal to 35% of predicted. patients completed the ACQ-6, and over 7 days, recorded twice daily PEF. patients responded to daily text messages asking them if they had symptoms of an URTI. 56 patients per treatment-arm provided 80% power to detect a mean treatment difference of 0.5 in the change from baseline in ACQ-6 8 days after a cold. a planned masked sample size recalculation (22) was performed mid-study, resulting in no required modification. 37.0 (19\u201364) 42.3 (25\u201358) 33.6 (21\u201361) 40.3 (19\u201361) 42.2 (23\u201364) Sex, male/female, % 30/70 37/63 33/67 24/76 30/70 43/57 29/71 41/59 Atopy status (skin prick test), atopic/nonatopic/not tested, %* 74/25/1 80/17/3 67/33/0 65/24/12 89.3 (18.5) 86.2 (18.5) Post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening, % of predicted, mean (SD) 98.3 (18.2) 95.6 (17.5) 99.4 (20.3) 101.5 (16.0) 97.0 (17.2) 97.8 (17.3) 98.7 (18.3) 90.1 (17.6) Post-bronchodilator FEV1 at treatment baseline, % of predicted, mean (SD) 96.2 (16.7) 94.9 (16. two patients taking 200 g/day inhaled corticosteroids were taking four classes of asthma drug as part of their normal asthma medication. one subject taking 200 g/day inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone equivalent) was taking oral corticosteroids as part of their normal asthma medication and was assigned to the BTS Step 5 subgroup. symptoms peaked at presentation, before treatment was initiated, and declined to baseline in a similar manner over a period of about 17 days. at presentation there was a highly significant monotonic relationship (Spearman rank correlation = 0.48; P 0.0001) between upper respiratory tract infection (cold) and asthma symptoms (n = 61). analysis of data from the mITT Population Because of missing data, 11 subjects were excluded from analysis of the primary outcome. treatment with IFN- (closed symbols) resulted in faster recovery of morning peak expiratory flow (C) compared with placebo (open symbols) measured daily at home (P = 0.033 for area under the curve analysis; n = 56 for placebo; n = 58 for IFN-; dashed line represents clinically relevant difference) analysis of sputum cell pellets by qPCR showed significantly increased gene expression for antiviral biomarkers OAS1 (Figure 5D), Mx1 (Figure 5E), and CXCL10 (Figure 5F) on Day 7 (P = 0.0003, 0.0001, and 0.0008, respectively) but not CXCL10 (Figure 5F) data are from patients in the modified intention-to-treat population. none of the placebo-treated patients who required additional treatment were from the difficult-to-treat patient population categorized as Step 4 according to the BTS severity criteria. the percentage of patients in whom individual changes in ACQ-6 were greater than or equal to 0.5 was significantly lower for IFN- (17%) as compared with placebo (50%). analysis of PEF changes during the treatment period showed significant IFN-related effects in Step 4-5 patients.
