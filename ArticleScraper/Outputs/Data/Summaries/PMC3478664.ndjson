{"summary": "the SINV P23 precursor protein extending from the nsP2 protease domain to the nsP3 central domain was shown to be fully intact by SDS/PAGE and mass spectrometry. sequence alignment of the central domain of nsP3 shows numerous absolutely conserved cysteine residues (Fig. S2). a previously described SINV mutant (ts7) contains a F312 to serine mutation in nsP3 (33) this residue is located in the hydrophobic core and surrounded by residues from the macro, ZBD, and MT-like domains. mutant would likely destabilize the core and disrupt domain interaction, giving rise to the RNA phenotype at the nonpermissive temperature. conserved nsP3 central domain contains antiparallel -helical bundle and two parallel -strands. zinc ion is coordinated by C263, C265, C288, and C306 of nsP3. each of the zinc coordinating cysteines is invariant among all alphavirus sequences. zinc-coordination mutants failed to express nonstructural polyprotein and replicate virus, thereby supporting the structural role of the zinc ion. a double serine to alanine mutant (S289A+S290A) resulted in decreased viral RNA infectivity. nsP2 (C) colored for electrostatic potential at 5 kT/e; blue (basic), red (acidic), and white (neutral) with ribbon diagram of nsP2 (B) or nsP3 (C) the numbering corresponds to SINV nsP2 sequence. loop connecting 9 with 11 makes direct contact with nsP3 linker just after the macro domain. mutating P726 to Phe, Tyr, Leu, Arg, or Gln resulted in numerous steric clashes with nsP3, whereas Ser, Thr, Ala, and Val had fewer conflicts. the three nsP3 mutants averaged an RNA infectivity at 8% of wild type. nsP3 mutants produced lower viral titers at 24 h after electroporation. all others, including all three P726 mutants, reached wild-type levels of virus titers. total protein was harvested from wild-type and indicated mutant SINV-infected BHK cells at indicated hours postinfection. nsP2 P726L and the four selected nsP3 L165 mutants were able to shut off host translation. nsP2 P726L and the four nsP3 L165 mutants exhibit a slow initial rate of transcription, especially of genomic RNA. however, these mutants reach wild-type levels by 4 h postinfection. RNA labeling in the absence of actinomycin D showed complete inhibition of host cellular transcription by 8 h postinfection. western blots probed with anti-nsP3 antibodies were used to confirm the presence of uncleaved P23. nsP3 appears as a smear, indicative of alternate phosphorylation states and possibly other posttranslational modifications (40). the nsP2 P726 mutants may also accumulate precleavage forms but at very low concentrations that do not build up over time. the polypeptide chain progresses around the perimeter of the rectangle. the nsP2 protease and nsP3 ZBD are adjacent to each other. the carboxyl terminus of the P23pro-zbd construct is pointing toward the protease active site. nsP3 central domain contains antiparallel -helical bundle, two parallel -strands, and a previously unknown zinc-coordination site. each of the zinc coordinating cysteines is invariant among all alphavirus sequences. mutagenesis was performed to examine the functionality of the four conserved cysteine residues involved in zinc coordination in nsP3. all four mutants failed to produce productive infection in BHK cells. a conserved cysteine residue in nsP3 (C247) unrelated to the zinc-binding site served as a control and C247A mutant produced infectious particles to near wild-type levels. nsP2 and nsP3 interface and location of nsP2 noncytopathic mutants. surface of nsP3 (B) or nsP2 (C) colored for electrostatic potential at 5 kT/e. mutations follow the encircling path made by the macro to ZBD linker. mutations caused a dramatic decrease in RNA replication and were noncytopathic. substitutions with small side chains behaved like wild-type virus. nsP2 mutation in nsp2 reduced RNA infectivity to only 2% of wild-type levels. three nsP3 L165 mutants averaged an RNA infectivity at 8% of wild type. nsP3 mutants produced lower viral titers at 24 h after electroporation. cells were infected with wild-type or mutant SINV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. total RNAs were harvested and analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. radiolabeling experiments were performed to evaluate viral and host protein and RNA production over the course of infection. nsP2 P726L and the four nsP3 L165 mutants exhibit a slow initial rate of transcription. RNA labeling in the absence of actinomycin D showed complete inhibition of host cellular transcription by 8 h postinfection. nsP2 P726L and the four nsP3 L165 mutants showed a delay in host transcription inhibition but eventually achieved complete shutoff 12 h postinfection. the presence of uncleaved P23 in the nsP3 linker region mutants started 6 h postinfection and persisted up to 12 h. west blots probed with anti-nsP3 antibodies were used to confirm the presence of uncleaved P23. nsP3 appears as a smear, indicative of alternate phosphorylation states and possibly other posttranslational modifications. a portion of nsP2 is localized to the nucleus, whereas nsP3 remains cytoplasmic. at the moment, it is unclear how nsP2 would dissociate postcleavage from the extensive, encircling grasp of nsP3. helix moves 3.8 to form a single continuous helix with 8. distortion of the MT-like domain in the P23pro-zbd becomes more pronounced. movement of the MT-like domain in the nsP2 -sheet becomes more concave. mutations at the surface of nsP2 contacting the nsP3 linker region appear by molecular modeling to destabilize P23 interaction. nsP3 residue (L165), which contacts nsP2 P726, did not produce virus with the same noncytopathic phenotype. despite large, bulky nature of a tryptophan substitution at L165, the virus remained similar to wild type. a previously described mutation in SFV nsP3 that altered P2/3 cleavage is completely solvent-exposed (27) these results may indicate that the nsP3 linker residues surrounding nsP2 P726 are recognized by the nsP2 protease or another factor necessary for P2/3 cleavage. a molecule of MES occupies the ADP ribose\u2013binding site in each of the three macro domains in mutations in a 51-nt-long CSE in the nsP1-coding region of SINV disrupted the RNA structure without affecting the coding sequence. Adaptive mutations (E118K of nsP2 and T286I of nsP3) were shown to restore replication of the mutated CSE. crystals of P23pro-zbd were grown by vapor diffusion against 2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 35% (vol/vol) xylitol, and 5% (vol/vol) trimethylamine N-oxide. phases were determined by molecular replacement using the nsP2pro (12) and nsP3 macro structures (32). crystals of P23pro-zbd were grown by vapor diffusion against 2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 35% (vol/vol) xylitol, and 5% (vol/vol) trimethylamine N-oxide. phases were determined by molecular replacement using the nsP2pro (12) and nsP3 macro structures (32)."}
