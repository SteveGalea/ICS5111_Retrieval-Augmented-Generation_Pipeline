{"summary": "virus was detected in a straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) in 2009. GhV is phylogenetically related to Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) virus, two highly pathogenic members of the genus Henipavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family. the F protein is transported to the cell surface as an inactive precursor. it has to undergo a recycling step via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon binding to the cellular receptor, the G protein undergoes three conformational changes that induce the refolding of F into its fusion-active conformation. the truncation of the cytoplasmic domain (CD) results in a GhV G that enhances fusion activity of GhV F and abolished the species restriction. the cellular localization did not differ from that of wildtype GhV G. coding for epitope-labelled full-length NiV and GhV F and G proteins has been described previously. chimeric G proteins consisting of the transmembrane domain (TM) and ectodomain (ED) of GhV G and the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of NiV G (GhV G CD-NiV), HeV G (GhV G CD-HeV), Moijang henipavirus (MojV) G all plasmids were verified by automated sequencing. cotransfection experiments with fluorescence-labeled cellular compartment markers for the endoplasmic reticulum were performed. the cells were incubated with anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 568- (dilution 1:1000, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (dilution 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) secondary antibodies were performed. syncytia were defined as multinucleated cells that are positive for the expression the cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 g and 4 \u00b0C. the supernatant was transferred to a new reaction tube and mixed with 4 LDS sample buffer. the samples were heated for 10 min at 96 \u00b0C before the lysates were loaded on an SDS gel (10% SDS) and further subjected to Western blotting. the samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 16,000 g and 4 \u00b0C. the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed by the addition of 500 L NP40 lysis buffer. subsequently, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended. cells were pelleted again, resuspended in fACS-buffer containing biotin-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. cells were then washed again to remove residual PFA and resuspended in 300 L FACS-buffer. the cells were then fixed by incubation with 3% PFA for 20 min. cells were cultivated in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. expression plasmids coding for epitope-labelled full-length NiV and GhV F and G proteins have been described previously. TM and the ED of NiV G (GhV G ED-NiV) and vice versa (NiV G ED-GhV) have been described previously [35]. to allow detection by immunostaining, all G proteins were fused to a FLAG-epitope at the C-terminal end. 2% Triton X-100 or untreated to detect intracellular or surface-expressed G proteins. incubation with antibodies directed against the HA- or the FLAG-epitope. incubation with anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 568- (dilution 1:1000, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 42 h p.t., cells were washed and resuspended in PBS. they were then resuspended in NP40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 g and 4 \u00b0C. subsequently, dithiothreitol (DTT, 0.1 M final concentration) was added. cell lysates were loaded onto 50 L of protein-A sepharose beads. they were mixed with recombinant mouse ephrin-B2-Fc. the samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 16,000 g and 4 \u00b0C. the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed. cells were resuspended in FACS-buffer containing anti-FLAG antibodies. cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in FACS-buffer. cells were then washed and fixed by incubation with 3% PFA for 20 min. al cytoplasmic domain (CD), the transmembrane domain (TM) and the C-terminal ectodomain (ED) the latter can be subdivided into a stalk and a head domain. the sequence of this domain is not well conserved among the henipavirus species ranging from approximately 40 to 63% aa identity. the truncated G proteins were coexpressed with GhV F in bat cells. the truncated G proteins GhV G10, 21, 27, 40, 46, and 52 showed the same phenotype as the full-length GhV G protein. this effect was most pronounced in the case of GhV G58 (Figure 2b). a syncytium was defined as a multinucleated cell with positive staining for GhV F and G, containing at least three nuclei. a syncytium was defined as a multinucleated cell with positive staining for GhV F and G. by truncation of the CD of GhV G we obtained modified versions that lacked either the first lysine-rich motif (GhV G27), the first lysine-rich motif and the tyrosine-based motif (GhV G 40, 46), or all three motifs combined (GhV G52, 54, 58) truncated G proteins were able to form high-order multimers and to bind to ephrin-B2. both truncated G proteins were able to form high-order multimers and to bind to ephrin-B2. switching the CD of GhV G with that of related or unrelated paramyxovirus G proteins does not affect Fusogenicity of GhV F. chimeric GhV G proteins harboring the CD of the G proteins of the related henipaviruses HeV, CedV, and MojV G were generated. fruit bat (HypNi/1.1) cells were cotransfected for the expression of GhV G proteins harboring the CD of NiV, HeV, MojV, CedV, or MeV. the mean fluorescence intensity obtained for the chimeric G proteins was further normalized to wildtype GhV G, which was set as 100%. the graph shows mean and SEM of three independent trials. chimeric G proteins were analyzed for their localization and fusogenicity following coexpression with homo- or heterologous F proteins. chimeric G proteins were analyzed for their localization and their fusogenicity following coexpression with chimeric G proteins. none of the chimeric G proteins was able to mediate cell-to-cell fusion regardless of the origin of the F protein or the cell line used. all chimeric GhV G proteins showed the same expression pattern as parental GhV G and were predominantly localized in the ER (Figure 5a, upper lane) truncated versions of GhV G were generated in which up to 58 aa residues of the CD were deleted in a stepwise fashion. the aa identity was analyzed using the PRofile ALIgNEment software (http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/pralinewww/) the deletion of the terminal 54 and 58 residues of the CD of GhV G resulted in an increased fusogenicity in bat and non-bat cells. this effect was most pronounced in the case of GhV G58. the total number of nuclei in syncytia per coverslip was counted in GhV F and G (wildtype, 54 or 58) cotransfected EidNi/41 cells. a syncytium was defined as a multinucleated cell with positive staining for GhV F and G. all truncated G proteins showed a total expression level comparable to that of full-length GhV G. no increased surface expression was observed for any of the G proteins. truncation of the CD did not affect intracellular localization. fruit bat cells were cotransfected for the expression of GhV G proteins. the mean fluorescence intensity obtained for GhV G54 and 58 was normalized to that of wildtype GhV G. the graph shows mean and SEM of three independent trials. chimeric GhV G proteins harboring the CD of the G proteins of the related henipaviruses HeV, CedV, and MojV G were generated. the replacement of the CD did not increase the surface expression level of GhV G. chimeric GhV G proteins were quantified by flow cytometry. mean fluorescence intensity obtained for the chimeric G proteins was normalized to wildtype GhV G, which was set as 100%. graph shows mean and SEM of three independent trials. GhV - - NiV G CD + TM-GhV - - Size of syncytia is indicated as the maximum number of nuclei per syncytium from three coverslips. chimeric G proteins were analyzed for their localization and their fusogenicity following coexpression with homo- or heterologous F proteins. no differences were detected when comparing the parental NiV G and NiV G CD + TM-GhV. this difference was believed to be due to an inefficient surface transport of the G protein of GhV. this difference was believed to be due to an inefficient surface transport of the G protein of GhV. lysine- and/or tyrosine-based motifs have been identified to cause accumulation of the S protein within intracellular compartments of the secretory pathway. the cytoplasmic tail of the GhV G protein contains two lysine-based motifs (25-KKTL-28 and 50-KKQKNQ-55) but none of them appears to serve as a retention signal. aa motifs/residues within the ED could be the cause for GhV G accumulation within the ER. a major difference between GhV and NiV is the inefficient surface expression of GhV G. restriction appears to be a peculiar feature of GhV G because a chimeric protein containing ED and TM of NiV G and CD of GhV G was highly efficient in inducing the fusion activity of NiV F. replacement of TM by the corresponding domain of GhV completely abolished the fusion activity of NiV F + G."}
