{"summary": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it is characterized by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and significant mortality in suckling piglets. the genome encodes at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase. it is expressed ubiquitously in most mammalian cells. phosphorylation of GSK-3 is mediated by Akt [33], P70S6K [34], p90RSK [35], PKC isoforms [37], and PKA [37]. the intestine of a suckling piglet with acute diarrhea was stored at -80\u00b0C until use. vero cells were grown to 90% confluence in six-well culture dishes and inoculated with PEDV JS-2013. vero cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM. DMEM containing 5 g/ml trypsin and DMSO (0.1%, v/v) was used for mock treatment. the cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. they were then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against PEDV N protein (1:2000) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then treated with donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488. fluorescence images were captured by using a fluorescence microscope. RNA extraction and real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) PCR products were purified and cloned into the pcDNATM3.1(+) plasmids. the virulent PEDV strain JS-2013 was stored in Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. it was isolated from the intestine of a suckling piglet with acute diarrhea in the region of Jiangsu province, china, in 2013. the virus stock was prepared in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. vero cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM. they were then cultured in fresh DMEM containing 5 g/ml trypsin. DMEM containing 5 g/ml trypsin was used for mock treatment. cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice in a lysis buffer. after 3 washes with PBS, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. then permeated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. RNA extraction and real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScriptTM 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TAKARA BIO INC., Dalian, Japan) PEDV JS-2013 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. PEDV N protein expression was detected initially at 6 h p.i. and increased until 12 h p.i. inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes PEDV replication. phosphorylation was PI3K-dependent, indicating blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes virus replication. LY294002 treatment decreased GSK-3/phosphorylation, as compared with mock treatment. lysates were prepared after 8 h of infection and then analyzed using Western blotting. RNA copies using real-time PCR after 10 h PEDV infection. quantitative data shown as mean SD (*p 0.05, **p 0.001) of three independent experiments. DV abolished the increase in Akt phosphorylation at early infection times. blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes PEDV replication. ly294002 treatment decreased GSK-3/phosphorylation, as compared with mock treatment. lysates were prepared and analyzed using Western blotting. quantitative data shown as mean SD (*p 0.05, **p 0.001) of three independent experiments. PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation at both early and late stages of PEDV infection. NS1 protein activates the PI3K/Akt pathway by direct interaction. PEDV stimulated the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in vero cells. PI3K/Akt pathway could be activated in virus replication and virus invasion. the precise molecular mechanism by which GSK-3 regulates PEDV replication requires further investigation."}
