{"summary": "introduction Gill-associated virus (GAV) infects Penaeus monodon shrimp and is the type species of the genus Okavirus in the Roniviridae. the nucleocapsid (N) protein is encoded by a gene located near to the genome 3\u2032-terminus and downstream of genes encoding other virion structural proteins. the deduced molecular masses of the 144\u2013146 amino acid (aa) N proteins of GAV and YH the N proteins of okaviruses and toroviruses lack cysteine residues. it also possesses proline-rich and basic residue-rich domains likely to facilitate RNA binding. this is hypothesized for similar sequences in the N protein of toroviruses. ORF2 gene and five constructs designed to produce N proteins with N- and/or C-terminal truncations were cloned into pQE10 and used to express recombinant His6-N fusion proteins in E. coli. the purity of the expressed proteins following Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography is shown in Fig. 1B. the fidelity of the recombinant His6-tagged proteins was confirmed in Western blots using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled-Ni2+ to detect the His6-tag on each protein. the fidelity of the recombinant His6-tagged proteins was confirmed. N-terminal truncation failed to bind the Ni2+-HRP probe following SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. the identity of each recombinant N protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses of peptides generated following tryptic digestion. gel EMSA of each ssRNA incubated with full-length GAV N protein. RNA was stained with ethidium bromide and detected using a UV transilluminator. EMSA binding reactions (20 l) were conducted at pH 8.0. migration of a 849 nt ssRNA synthesized to the Mourilyan virus (MoV) M RNA segment was retarded similarly to equivalent-sized GAV ssRNAs. dsRNA binding to dsDNA and ssDNA was also assessed. ssRNA migration was clearly retarded in the presence of full-length N protein. migration was clearly retarded at a ratio of 120 and at ratios of 130 or greater. ssRNA migration was retarded to similar extents at comparable ssRNA:protein molar ratios. EMSAs were undertaken using his6-N protein constructs with N- or C-terminal deletions or both. migration of all three ssRNAs was retarded in the presence of the full-length N protein. ssRNAs incubated with full-length N protein (QE10-N2) are indicated (C) ssRNAs incubated in the absence of N protein are indicated (C) ssRNAs incubated in the absence of N protein are indicated (C) ophage M13 ssDNA was assessed, ssDNA-peptide complexes or aggregates formed that precluded any ssDNA from migrating into the gel. the same effect was observed when dsDNA PCR products used to prepare ssRNA-1 and ssRNA-2 were incubated with the peptide. cloned into pQE10 and used to express recombinant His6-N fusion proteins in coli. migration of full-length His6-N protein (QE10-N2; 144 aa, 16.0 kDa deduced mass) trailed the 20.1 kDa marker protein slightly, consistent with an elevated mass estimated previously. inant GAV N protein (QE10-N2) and truncated N protein constructs used in EMSAs. fidelity of recombinant His6-tagged proteins was confirmed in Western blots using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled-Ni2+. the identity of each recombinant N protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses of peptides generated following tryptic digestion. a total of 15 (+) and () sense ssRNAs were synthesized to different regions of the GAV genome. gel EMSA contained 300 ng ssRNA incubated with full-length GAV N protein. RNA was stained with ethidium bromide and detected using a UV transilluminator. EMSA binding reactions were conducted at pH 8.0. EMSAs using various RNA, and DNA sequences incubated with full-length GAV His6-N protein. dsRNA-1/3 (lanes 1, 2) and dsRNA-6/8 (lanes 3, 4) incubated with (lane 1) and without (lane 2) N protein. EMSAs were undertaken using varied molar ratios of full-length N protein and ssRNA-1. migration was clearly retarded at a ratio of 120 and at ratios of 130 or greater. ssRNA migration was clearly retarded at a ratio of 120 and at ratios of 130 or greater. EMSAs were undertaken using his6-N protein constructs with N- or C-terminal deletions or both. migration of all three ssRNAs was retarded in the presence of full-length N protein and the constructs QE10-N1 and QE10-N22. ssRNAs incubated in the absence of N protein are indicated (C) ssRNAs incubated in the absence of N protein are indicated (C) ssRNAs incubated in the absence of N protein are indicated (QE10-N22), an N- and C-terminal truncation. dsDNA PCR products used to prepare ssRNA-1 and ssRNA-2 were incubated with the peptide. small quantities of non-aggregated dsDNA with unaffected migration were also evident in the gel. EMSA using 1 g 18 aa synthetic ssRNA and 300 ng each synthetic ssRNA to various regions of the GAV genome. the ability to bind RNA was expected due to the structural role of the N protein in okavirus nucleocapsids [2], [3], [5], [20]. the ability to bind RNA was expected due to the structural role of the N protein in okavirus nucleocapsids. the presence of the His6-tag allowed the proteins to be purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. all six purified recombinant N proteins possessed masses equivalent to those predicted from the length of truncations. the masses of the GAV and YHV N proteins estimated by SDS-PAGE are higher than those deduced from their amino acid sequences. mRNA export TRQARRNRRRWRERQ HIV 1 HIV Tat Transcription trans-activator ALGISYGRKKRRQRRRRWRERQ phage f 21 N Transcription anti-termination GTAKSRYKARRAELIAER P22 phage P22 N Transcription anti-termination GNAKTRRHERRRKLAIER GAV N nucleocapsid protein MPVRRPLPPQPPRNARLI YHV YHV the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been found to possess an ability to bind both genomic and sub-genomic viral RNAs as well as cellular RNAs to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. however, the association of the viral membrane (M) protein confers selective binding of genomic-length (+) ssRNA directed by a 190 nt packaging signal positioned toward the 3\u2032-end of the ORF ssRNA migration was visibly retarded more when the estimated molar N protein:ssRNA ratio was increased from 201 to 301. a similar phenomenon occurs in prunus necrotic ringspot virus, a plant ilarvirus containing a tripartite ssRNA genome. ssRNA binding activity was confirmed in EMSA analyses of various RNAs and recombinant N protein constructs. this activity was not dictated by specific sequence constraints and was localized to a short, highly-charged N-terminal motif rich in arginines and prolines. additional studies are now needed to determine the mechanism by which genomic ssRNA is nucleated either specifically or preferentially. rapid colony PCRs were performed using the pQE-specific primer 5\u2032-CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG-3\u2032 (QIAGEN) to screen clones for ORF2 inserts in the correct orientation. plasmid DNA prepared to each clone selected for analysis was sequenced using the pQE-specific primer and clone specific reverse primers. the proteins were stored at 80\u00b0C until used in EMSAs. refolded by dialysis overnight at 4\u00b0C in 200 ml refolding buffer. the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 0.9% NaCl in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) for 15 min. the blocked membrane was washed with three changes of TBS for 10 min each before being incubated in developing solution (30 mg 4-chloronaphtol, 2.5 ml ice-cold methanol and 20 l hydrogen peroxide in TBS, 50 pGAV16, containing a 4282 nt sequence beginning 509 nt upstream of the ORF1b gene 3\u2032-terminus. pGAV12.1, containing a 2.7 kb insert extending from a region within the ORF3 gene to the GAV genome 3\u2032-polyA tail. each PCR contained 100 ng plasmid DNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 5 l 10 PCR buffer (670 mM RNA was synthesized using a MEGAclearTM RNA purification column (Ambion) eluted in 100 l elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and stored at 80\u00b0C. dsRNA was synthesized using 1 g Pst I-linearized pMoV4.1 DNA. electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to identify N-protein binding to nucleic acid [32], [35]. in each assay, 300 ng synthetic ssRNA/ssDNA/dsDNA in MEGAclearTM elution buffer (Ambion) was heated at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and cooled at room temperature for 15 min. a plasmid containing the entire ORF2 gene [2] was used as template for all PCRs. clones were grown on Luria broth (LB) agar plates containing 100 g/ml ampicillin or 100 g/ml ampicillin. protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 to 1.0 mM final concentration of isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) cells were collected by centrifugation (8,000g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) for non-denatured protein purification. the ORF2 His6-fusion proteins were stored at 80\u00b0C until used in EMSAs. aliquot of each purified recombinant His6-ORF2 protein was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel run at 120 V for 90 min. proteins in one gel were electro-transferred onto a HybondTM-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) using towbin transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol and 0.1% SDS) the synthetic peptide (MPVRRPLPPQPPRNARLI) was purchased from Shanghai Science Peptide Biological Technology Co.

GAV genome 5\u2032-terminus and a sequence including the intergenic region downstream of ORF1b to the end of ORF2 were prepared by adding together equimolar amounts of plus- and minus-sense ssRNAs. the formation of dsRNA was confirmed by comparing its migration to each ssRNA in a 1% agarose-TAE (40 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) gel. the RNA-protein sample was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-TAE gel containing 0.5 g/ml ethidium bromide. the relative migration of free nucleic acid and nucleic acid-N protein complexes was visualized using a UV transilluminator."}
