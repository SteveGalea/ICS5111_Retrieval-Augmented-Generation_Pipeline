{"summary": "emergence of new viruses can be attributed to recombining viruses as well as to host species jump (1\u20133) understanding how viruses interact with their hosts and more specifically how the complex interactions between viruses and their host organisms are acquired and maintained throughout evolution remains a major challenge (4\u20137) PhEVER integrates extensive data from up-to-date completely sequenced genomes spanning a wide taxonomic range. it spans all known viral groups but also has the unique feature of presenting homologies with eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. the database offers a clustering of proteins into homologous families containing at least one viral sequence. complete genomes and their annotations were retrieved from three external public databases (Ensembl, Genome Reviews and RefSeq Viral) to provide high-quality non-redundant data for Archaea, Bacteria and Viruses. genome of A. gambiae contains data from different haplotypes and presents therefore a high level of redundancy. c2718 mature peptides are added to the 80 210 proteins translated from all CDS. the classification of all organisms present in the database was retrieved from the taxonomy database at national centre for biotechnology information (11). the classification of all organisms present in the database was retrieved from the taxonomy database at national centre for biotechnology information (11) and is available on the web interface. a large number of orphan families indicate that a significant proportion of viral proteins do not contain any homologs with proteins from known genomes. these proteins are unfit for comparative functional analysis and should be the focus of future experimental studies. phylogenetic trees were inferred by maximum likelihood using phyML. 80% of all branch supports have a value higher than 75. 80% of all branch supports have a value higher than 75. the low branch support values are attributable to very similar sequences with small branch lengths. all branches longer than 0.15 subst/site display a high branch support. the inner figure shows the distribution of branch lengths justifying the focus on branch lengths inferior to 1. interface Raa_query (16) implement more features than the web interface. the C language API, Python language API (16) and the seqinR package for R (30) implement tools for integrating queries in user designed code. the PhEVER database can also be installed on a local machine or server. the first open access database to provide information at the cross-taxa scale for the analysis of virus\u2013virus and virus\u2013host protein transfers. it is the largest database of viral homologous families and offers highly accurate pre-computed alignments and phylogenies. the next step we have under development is the detection of evolutionary conserved modules in the proteins present in PhEVER. ASE ACCESS AND UPDATES Public access and documentation is freely available through the database webpage and through all dedicated ACNUC retrieval systems. more information on dedicated ACNUC retrieval systems can be obtained in the Supplementary Data or on the PhEVER webpage."}
