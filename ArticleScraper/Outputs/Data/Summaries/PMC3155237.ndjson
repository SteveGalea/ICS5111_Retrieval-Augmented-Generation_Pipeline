{"summary": "the only effective strategy for controlling HIV-1 infections is the use of antiretroviral drugs either for the treatment or prevention of infections. current antiretroviral drugs belong to four classes, the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PR) and fusion inhibitors. the advent of combination therapy, or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since 1996 has been responsible for a dramatic decrease in AIDS mortality. current HAART regimens generally comprise three antiretroviral drugs, usually two NRTIs and either a PI or an NNRTI. new drugs and drug targets need to be identified due to drug toxicity and the eventual emergence of drug resistant strains to current antiretroviral inhibitors. this review will deal with agents that inhibit HIV-1 PR by novel mechanisms that are distinct to these transition state mimetics. early events in virus replication include attachment, fusion and uncoating of the virus followed by reverse transcription in the. late events begin with transcription of unspliced and spliced RNA from the provirus and integration of the proviral DNA precursor into the host cell chromosome. regulation of Gag-Pol synthesis is mediated by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism from unspliced mRNA that also expresses Gag. glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 to form immature viral particles. the viral genomic RNA is also packaged into virions through interactions with the NC of Gag and a psi packaging signal in the genome. agents that interfere with HIV-1 PR mediated cleavage of Gag and Gag-Pol result in the production of immature viral particles non-infectious. a heptanucleotide AU-rich sequence (UUUUUUUA) is found at the 3\u2032 end of the NC coding sequence. this sequence and downstream RNA stem loop structure stall the ribosome during the synthesis of Gag, allowing the ribosome to slip back one nucleotide and enable synthesis of the Gag-Pol fusion protein. a decrease in Gag-Pol translation results in major defects in virus maturation and HIV-1 infectivity. the small molecule, 1,4-bis-[N-(3-N,N-dimethylpropyl)amidino]benzene tetrahydrochloride (RG501, Table 1), is thought to enhance ribosomal frameshifting of HIV-1 by binding to the RNA stem loop structure of the ribosomal frameshifting signal resulting in increased anoate 11-ethylthioundecanoic acid 12-thioethyldodecanoic acid. 5-cis-tetradecenoic acid (physeteric acid) 5-cis,8-cis-tetradecenoic acid (goshuyic acid) Unsaturated 14-Carbon fatty acids.

During the late phase of the viral life cycle, Gag polyproteins are targeted to the plasma membrane. myristoylation of Gag but not Gag-Pol is critical for targeting these polyproteins to the plasma membrane. mutants that interfere with Gag myristoylation inhibit viral budding and misdirect virion assembly to the cytosolic fraction. heteroatom-substituted analogs of myristic acid such as 12-methoxydodecanoate (13-oxamyristate or 13-OxaMyr), 5-octyloxypentanoate (oxamyristate or 6-OxaMyr), 11-ethyl-thioundecanoic acid and 12-thioethyldodecanoic acid act as alternate substrates for therapeutic efficacy of 13-OxaMyr can be enhanced by conjugation with glycerophospholipid L--phosphatidylethanolamine. heteroatom-substituted myristic acid analogs are still expected to adversely affect a substantial range of cellular processes that depend on protein N-myristoylation. binding of PI(4,5)P2 to the MA domain in Gag activates the \u201cmyristyol switch\u201d and acts as the point of membrane attachment. targeting HIV-1 CA CA plays an important role in the HIV-1 life-cycle by promoting Gag-Gag interactions during virion maturation. CAP-1 and CAP-2 bind to a common site within the NTD. CAP-1 reduces viral infectivity by 95% at 100 M. despite aberrant viral morphology CAP-1 does not affect viral particle release or proteolytic processing. the synthetic peptide, PAATLEEMMTA, inhibits HIV-1 replication in cell culture assays at 20\u2013200 g/ml. amides derived from the carboxyl terminus of CA inhibit HIV-1 replication. the three most potent peptides interacting with CA. resulting protein-peptide complex is a five-helix bundle with reduced CA-CA dimerization contacts that destabilize the dimer interface. binding of CAI to the C-CA affects the assembly of immature capsid particles but also reduces the amount of correctly assembled mature capsids in vitro. this sequence includes a highly conserved \u201cmajor homology region\u201d in the CA domain of Gag and the adjacent CA-SP1. the zinc fingers of NCp7 are critical in the early and late stages of HIV-1 replication with mutations in the zinc chelating amino acids resulting in formation of non-infectious virus. the zinc fingers of NCp7 are required for initiation, elongation and efficient template switching during reverse transcription. the defect in viral particle release and maturation was attributed to the formation of intermolecular cross-linkages between the zinc fingers of adjacent Gag molecules. the non-dissociable tethered dithiane compound 1,2-dithiane-4,5-diol,1,1-dioxide mediates similar defects in Gag processing. this may be explained by the inaccessibility of these inhibitors to the appropriate cellular compartments where zinc finger containing cellular proteins are located over-expression of HIV-1 PR leads to major defects in viral assembly and production of non-infectious viral particles. novel inhibitors designed to prevent PR dimerization could potentially inhibit the mature PR homodimer and the immature Gag-Pol embedded PR. an example of a dissociative inhibitor is the C-terminal tetrapeptide, Ac-T-L-N-F, which exhibits activity in the micro-molar range (Ki 45 M) other studies have also shown the capacity of N- and C-terminal peptides to bind to PR monomers and thus prevent PR dimerization and activity. interface tetrapeptides tethered with a glycine linker display greater potency (PF1, IC50= 40 M) compared to free tetrapeptides (IC50 150 M) this approach has evolved to linking peptides with flexible alkyl tethers (Zutshi and Chmielewski, 2000) and semirigid alkyl based tethers. cross-linked interfacial peptides have been designed to irreversibly inhibit HIV-1 PR by formation of a disulfide bond between the peptide and the conserved PR residues C-95 and C-67. p52 was a pure dissociative inhibitor with low Ki of 780 nM (Park and Raines, 2000). inhibition of HIV-1 replication has been reported by the fusion of Vpr to viral PR recognition sequences. expression of the PR tetrapeptide as a Vpr fusion attenuates HIV-1 replication in chronically infected cells and in single-round replication assays. s PR activity with a Ki of 2.58 M results in disorganisation of the PR secondary structure by reducing the -sheet content from 30% to 14%. current efforts are directed towards developing a shorter less hydrophobic peptide or mimetic based on the S8 lead peptide. organism magenta ascidian didemnum identified two didemnaketals, A (a bicyclic ketal) and B (a linear heptaprenoid), that inhibit HIV-1 PR activity with IC50 values of 2 M and 10 M respectively. these compounds are unsuitable drug candidates, but have given rise to a novel class of pentaesters, the most potent of which is a dissociative inhibitor of PR with a Ki of 2.1 M inhibition of cleavage at the CA/p2 site has severe consequences for core formation, stability and virion infectivity. a compound that interferes with viral maturation by blocking CA/p2 cleavage has been identified. PA-457 specifically blocks the cleavage of CA/p2 in cell based. mutations in regions that flank the P-P\u2032 scissile bond are recognized by the viral PR during proteolysis. other single amino acid substitutions have been identified that confer resistance to PA-457. PA-457 has successfully undergone Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. kcal/mol1, corresponding to a dissociation constant of approximately 3 107 M (Venezia et al. 2006). regions upstream and downstream of the PR region in Gag-Pol have been investigated for effects on PR activation. large deletions within or C-terminal truncations of RT result in an increase in virion associated Gag processing intermediates. TSAO-T derivatives destabilise both RT heterodimers and p66 homodimers by inducing changes at the RT dimer interface. resistance mutations to the TSAO drugs are readily generated in cell culture. BBNH destabilizes the RT heterodimer by inducing changes in the primer-grip motif, which is an important region for RT dimer stability. TSAO drugs that destabilize the p66 homodimer may also disrupt the process of RT maturation to the heterodimer and interfere with PR activation. several classical NNRTIs have been shown to confer a concentration dependant increase in RT heterodimer formation, corresponding with a loss of RT polymerase function. EFV is a strong enhancer of RT dimerization, and also enhances the formation of p66 and p51 homodimers (Tachedjian et al. 2005a). te this effect are two to three orders of magnitude higher than concentrations that block RT function. this is likely due to reduced binding affinity of the NNRTIs to the proposed target which is the RT domain of Gag-Pol. this is likely due to reduced binding affinity of the NNRTIs to the proposed target. studies have led to the synthesis of a peptide, TLMA2993. TLMA2993 inhibits RT activity at micromolar concentrations. IN is also implicated in reverse transcription, nuclear import of pre-integration complex, viral assembly and budding. in this regard peptide inhibitors of IN dimerization have been reported. integrase interactor 1 (INI1) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen. INI1 mutants that abrogate interaction with IN exhibit a substantial reduction in viral production. inhibitory effect of S6 on HIV-1 production is mediated by binding of the ectopically expressed S6 to the Gag-Pol embedded IN. stable expression of a transdominant S6 mutant inhibits infection in T-cells. inhibition of HIV-1 maturation and budding is observed with reversible (zLLL also known as MG-132) proteosome inhibitors also interfere with the activity of the HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) on the antiviral function of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G. the use of proteosome inhibitors in HIV-1 infected individuals needs to be considered in the context of the potential risk benefit. proteosome inhibitors also enhance the early step of the virus life-cycle by preventing degradation of the reverse transcription complex mediated by TRIM5. an interesting feature of Vpu is its role in viral particle release from nondividing cells such as macrophages. the rate of host cell proliferation is a determining factor for Vpu mediated viral particle release. amiloride analogues inhibit Vpu ion channel activity. studies indicate that mutating histidine at residue 19 to alanine results in a rimantadine sensitive Vpu ion channel demonstrating the potential of this class of inhibitor as HIV-1 ion channel blockers. the host cell protein, Vpu-binding protein (UBP), is suggested to be a negative factor for virus assembly. a PTAP sequence, encompassing amino acids 7 to 10 of p6, is critical for virus particle production. the PTAP motif binds specifically to the host cell protein, tumor suppressor gene 101 (TSG101), resulting in the recruitment of components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I) interruption of this viral host protein-protein interaction with compounds that bind to this pocket would potentially inhibit viral particle release and the rate of cell-cell HIV-1 transmission. so far there has been one report that describes the synthesis and selection of small molecules with up to five fold better binding capacity than a peptide that contains the sequence of the wild type PTAP motif. disruption of viral-host cell interactions is a very attractive approach to abolish virion release and infectivity. interfering with the host cell machinery could have major consequences for the host. mediated by Vif. HIV-1 relies on posttranslational modifications mediated by the host cell machinery in order for viral polyproteins to be trafficked to the appropriate compartment of the cell. one of the most effective drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected individuals is the HIV-1 PR inhibitors that block viral maturation."}
