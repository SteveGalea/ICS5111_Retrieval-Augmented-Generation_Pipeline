{"summary": "introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has dramatically improved. these antivirals have significantly increased response rates (up to 98%) and greatly reduced treatment duration [1]. Currently available DAAs are classified into four categories given their molecular targets in the HCV replication cycle. the lack of information in relation to preexisting baseline RASs are the major limiting factors for the broad implementation of these new therapies in Uruguay as well as in other Latin American countries. this study explored the presence of resistance variants to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment nave cohort of Uruguayan patients chronically infected with hepatitis C. the reverse transcription was performed at 42\u00b0C for 50 min. then the reverse transcriptase enzyme was inactivated at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. NS5A and NS5B genome regions were sequenced using primers. NS5A and NS5B sequences were generated using the MEGA 5.0 software. for NS5A, 953 nucleotides (positions 6367 to 7319, relative to HCV 1a reference strain, H77 NC_004102) were included in the phylogenetic analysis. for NS5B, only 361 nucleotides corresponding to the Okamoto region were included. a world consensus nucleotide sequence was generated for each gene and subtype. each Uruguayan sequence was subsequently aligned to the corresponding reference sequences. the amino acid sequences obtained were compared in order to explore the presence of RASs and the presence of polymorphisms. l of 5X first-strand buffer, 2 l of 0.1 M DTT, 1 l of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 U/l) and 1 l (40 U/l) RNaseOUT (invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) reverse transcription was performed at 42\u00b0C for 50 min. then the reverse transcriptase enzyme was inactivated at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. logenetic trees were constructed for both NS5A and NS5B using the MEGA 5.0 software. for NS5A, 953 nucleotides were included in the phylogenetic analysis. for NS5B, only 361 nucleotides corresponding to the Okamoto region were included. the amino acid sequences obtained were compared in order to explore the presence of RASs as well as the presence of polymorphisms at a RAS position (RAPs) in Uruguayan HCV strains. sequences of these regions were aligned with corresponding sequences from 59 HCV strains isolated elsewhere, representing all genotypes and main subtypes. the results of NS5A and NS5B phylogenetic analyses were concordant for both genomic regions in all 31 sequences. a second maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of HCV-1a sequences of NS5A partial region was built. RASs to NS5A inhibitors (L31M and L31V) were identified in 2 strains out of 25 (8%) fully sequenced samples. substitution E62D was found in one subtype 1a strain. Uruguayan AA sequences were aligned to the NS5B world consensus sequences. 23 sequences span residues 36 to 539. the remaining 3 span residues 36 to 557 of NS5B protein. in 2 subtype 1b strains) and A553G (in 1 subtype 1a strain) this resistant phenotype has not been proven in strains subtype 1b [29]. different polymorphisms not previously associated with a resistant phenotype were also detected in NS5B. Strains isolated from Uruguayan patients were assigned to genotype 1, 20 of which corresponded to subtype 1a and 11 to subtype 1b. results of NS5A and NS5B phylogenetic analyses were concordant for both genomic regions in all 31 sequences. a second maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of HCV-1a sequences of NS5A partial region was built. RASs to NS5A inhibitors (L31M and L31V) were identified in 2 strains out of 25 (8%) fully sequenced samples. substitution E62D was found in one subtype 1a strain. Uruguayan AA sequences were aligned to the NS5B world consensus sequences. 23 sequences span residues 36 to 539. the remaining 3 span residues 36 to 557 of NS5B protein. the advent of DAAs therapies constitutes one of the major breakthroughs in HCV infected patients management. despite the high rates of viral response achieved with DAA-based treatments, still 1 to10% of the patients fails to eliminate infection. despite the high rates of viral response achieved with DAA-based treatments, still 1 to10% of the patients fails to eliminate infection. we have previously reported that substitutions conferring resistance to NS3 inhibitors exist in a significant proportion of Uruguayan patients infected with HCV genotype 1. the presence of substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A inhibitors has been widely reported both in therapy-nave and in relapser patients from Europe [10, 33, 35\u201338], USA [37, 39, 40], and Asia [41\u201343]. substitution L31V does it to DCV in subtypes 1a and 1b, to LDV in subtype 1b, and to EBV in subtype 1a [5, 6, 28], whereas substitution L31M does it to DCV in subtypes 1a and 1b, to LDV in subtype 1b, and to EBV in subtype 1a [5, 6, 28]. the substitution H58P and K24Q found in two patients are considered as resistance-associated polymorphisms (RAP the presence of NS5B inhibitors RASs in 5 out of 26 analyzed HCV infected Uruguayan patients nave to treatment (19.2%) substitutions found in this work were A421V and S556G associated in subtype 1a with resistance to BCV and dasabuvir (DSV) despite our results, it is worth mentioning that the presence of baseline NS5B RASs conferring resistance to nucleotide or nonnucleoside NS5B inhibitors has not been shown to have any impact on virologic responses thus far. this fact could be linked not only to the isolates' geographic region and viral intrinsic characteristics but also to the genetic background of the host. the present study revealed for the first time the presence of RASs in the NS5A and NS5B regions of HCV genotype 1 strains from patients who have not been previously treated with DAAs. it is currently unclear if preexisting viral variants with reduced susceptibility to DAAs are clinically relevant for the prediction of virologic treatment failure. however, individualized DAA therapy based on baseline resistance analysis may be beneficial for optimizing treatment efficacy in patients with HCV genotyp hepatitis C Virus NS5A subtype 1a sequences used to reveal evolutionary relationships between Uruguayan strains and others isolated elsewhere. their corresponding genotype, country of isolation, and GenBank accession number are indicated."}
