{"summary": "live attenuated vaccine viruses are highly immunogenic and effective in inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. different live attenuated vaccine viruses have been explored as vectors to express heterologous antigens. measles vaccine (MV) strain has a long history of demonstrated safety in humans. the EZ vaccine strain may be immunogenic in populations with histories of measles vaccination or preexisting MV immunity. the surface fusion protein of RSV is a major antigenic protein that induces neutralizing antibodies, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protection against subsequent RSV challenge. antigenomic cDNA was synthesized by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) based on the sequence of live attenuated measles virus Edmonston-Zagreb strain. a T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences were added to the 3\u2019 end of the antigenomic cDNA. supporting plasmids encoding measles N, P and L genes were cloned into pCITE plasmids under the control of T7 promoter. pN, pP and pL were designed pN, pP and pL respectively. intensity of the MV N protein bands was expressed as the intensity of the band relative to the rEZ control. each inserted gene contained measles virus transcriptional unit consisting of sequences of N gene stop (GE-N) and P gene start (GS-P) each inserted gene contained measles virus transcriptional unit consisting of sequences of N gene stop (GE-N) and P gene start (GS-P) the sac II to Nar I fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA. the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively. HEp-2 cells were infected with MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infectivity (moi) of 5 for an hour prior to transfection. rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 viruses were infected with each virus at a MOI of 0.01 in triplicates. the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 2 mL of complete DMEM at 35oC with 5% CO2. Viral proteins detected with anti-measles nucleoprotein (clone 2D7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit EBV gp350 [33] or monoclonal antibody against RSV F proteins (palivizumab, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) intensities were quantified by ImageQuant software. measles vaccine immunization history of the rhesus macaques was confirmed by neutralization assay prior to the study. half of the animals (4 measles virus sero-positive, 8 nave) received two doses of gp350 intramuscularly using 105 PFU/inoculation and the other half received two doses of sF3 at the same dose intramuscularly. titer for each sample was calculated by determining the dilution at which the absorbance reached 2 times over the reading of no serum control. lower limits of detection were 3.3 log2 and 6.6 log2 for EBV gp350 ELISA and RSV F ELISA, respectively. the numbers of IFN- or IL-4 secreting cells were expressed as the number cells per 106 cells. GraphPad Prism software was used to analyze the data (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) sequence at nucleotides 5502 (Sca I) and 9343 (Mlu I) was modified to facilitate cDNA cloning. supporting plasmids encoding measles N, P and L genes were cloned into pCITE plasmids under the control of T7 promoter. western blots were used to detect presence of measles virus nucleoprotein in infected vero cell lysates or soluble EBV gp350 protein in the supernatant. arrowheads indicate predicted molecular masses of the proteins. pEZ antigenomic cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively. the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively. the transfected cells were incubated for an additional 3 to 4 days. the culture supernatant was used to infect fresh Vero cells. the rescued viruses were then plaque purified twice in vero cells. the resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. the resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. the animals were observed for clinical signs daily and bled at 14-day intervals to measure antibody responses. twenty-eight days after the second immunization, the cotton rats from measles virus vectored RSV vaccine groups were challenged with 106 PFU of i.n. inant soluble EBV gp350 or RSV F protein expressed from mammalian cells was adsorbed onto Immulon 2B plates overnight in PBS at 4\u00b0C. serial dilutions of animal sera in PBS/1%BSA were added to the plate and incubated for an hour at room temperature. the plate was developed with tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate and stopped with HCl. ted and control cotton rats 14 days after the second dose and peripheral blood mononucleocyte cells of rhesus monkeys 28 days after the second dose. PBMC of rhesus monkeys were counted using Vi-Cell (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) the ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA. the F was cloned at the two positions of the viral genome. the ectodomain and its N-terminal half of the gp350 encoded the receptor binding site to CD21 [39] were also cloned into the EZ genome. recombinant EZ (rEZ) and EZ vaccine viruses grew to a peak titer of 7.9 log10 PFU/mL on day 5. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. insertion of RSV F or EBV gp350 into the genome of EZ did not significantly reduce viral growth in vitro. x 105 cells were stimulated with either RSV F protein (A and C) or EBV gp350 protein (B and D) in vitro for 20 h. numbers of spot-forming cells (A and B) and IL-4 spot-forming cells (C and D) were quantified by an ELISPOT assay. no significant differences in MV Ab titers were observed among the animals receiving sF1, sF3, gp350 or gp350tr compared to rEZ. the 2nd dose increased MV Ab titers by 2-4 folds. b Titer is defined as log2 reciprocal dilution of serum that inhibited cytopathic effects in 50% of the wells containing measles infected Vero cells. d RSV titer is defined as log2 reciprocal dilution of serum that reduced plaques on HEp-2 cells by 50%. e Titer on day 0 for all assays were under the limit of detection. gp350 induced a significantly higher EBV gp350-specific IgG titer than gp350tr. EBV specific neutralizing antibody could not be detected by the EBV neutralization assay. 350-specific IFN- and IL-4 secreting cells for gp350 and gp350tr vaccinated groups were statistically higher than the PBS control group for the gp350tr group. cotton rats vaccinated with 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3 had viral titers in the lungs that was at least 4.5 log10 lower than the control animals. Lungs were harvested on day 60 and RSV titers were determined in the lung homogenates by standard plaque assay. each experimental group represents 5 individual animals except in UVinactivated sF3 group (n=3) the ability of rEZ vectored gp350 to induce measles virus specific or F or gp350 specific immune responses was examined. c Day 0 Dose 1 b Dose 2 b Dose 2 b Dose 1 Dose 2 gp350 + 4.3 1.2 5.7 0.5 7.3 0.6 3.3 3.3 3.3 3.3 gp350 - 3.3 5.4 1.1 7.3 0.1 3.3 3.3 3.3 3.3 sF3 + 4.2 0.7 5.2 1.5 7.5 1.2 9.3 1.9 11.8 1.0 3.3 0.5 5.0 0.8 seven out of 8 animals had a detectable level of RSV neutralizing Ab titers. the RSV Nt Ab titers were not statistically different between the two groups. the reverse genetics system for measles Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine virus was established by transfecting MV antigenomic plasmid pEZ together with pP, pN and pL into infected HEp-2 cells. to generate rEZ, the F ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA. sF3 (F at the 3rd position), gp350 and gp350tr (both at the 3rd position), respectively. expression of inserts in infected vero cells was examined by Western blotting analysis. recombinant measles viruses expressed desired antigens. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. growth kinetics of measles vectors encoding soluble RSV F or soluble EBV gp350 was similar to that of recombinant measles constructs. cotton rats were immunized with two doses of rEZ viruses intramuscularly at 4 weeks interval. sera were collected 4 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post dose 2. no significant differences in MV Ab titers were observed among the animals receiving sF1, sF3, gp350 or gp350tr compared to rEZ. c Titer is defined as log2 reciprocal dilution of serum that reduced plaques on HEp-2 cells by 50%. sF1 or sF3 induced RSV F-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated cotton rats (about 15.5-15.9 log2 post dose 1 and 22.1-23.7 log2 post dose 2). sF1 and sF3 induced RSV neutralizing Ab and titers were boosted to 7.5-log2 and 8.9-log2 after the second dose. there was no statistical difference in antibody response between sF1 and sF3 vaccinated animals and those intranasally infected with 2 doses of sF3 strain. the RSV F-specific IL-4 secreting cells were low, averaged about 20 spots/106 splenocytes for both sF1 and sF3 groups. sF3 and RSV induced a Th1-biased response based on the higher IFN- to IL-4 secreting cell ratio. cotton rats were immunized with 105 PFU of sF1 or sF3 on day 0 and 28. cotton rats were then challenged with 106 PFU of RSV A2 on day 56. each experimental group represents 5 individual animals except in UVinactivated sF3 group (n=3) gp350 vaccinated monkeys induced a similar level of MV neutralizing antibody in both MV- and MV+ monkeys. a second dose of vaccination with sF3 or gp350 increased MV neutralizing Ab titers by about 4-fold in all groups. sF3 inoculated animals had RSV F-specific IgG titer higher than the pre-vaccination level (titers were under the detection limit) sF3 inoculated animals had RSV F-specific IgG titer higher than the pre-vaccination level. measles seronegative and sero-positive rhesus macaques were immunized with 105 PFU of sF3 or gp350 on day 0 and 28. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood on day 56. both cotton rats and rhesus macaques have previously been shown to be permissive to measles virus infection to various degrees. rEZ vectored vaccines induced insert specific responses in cotton rats but poor responses in rhesus macaques. the gene insertion position affected immunogenicity of EZ vectored vaccines in cotton rats. rEZ vectored EBV gp350 and gp350tr induced lower gp350 specific IgG Ab response in cotton rats. the cotton rats immunized with MV expressing RSV F were also challenged with wt RSV. after challenge, the number of IFN- secreting cells was higher than IL-4 secreting cells, which was consistent with a Th1-biased response. rEZ and rEZ expressing gp350 and sF3 induced a good level of antibody response to measles virus irrespective of their sero-status to MV. the antibody response was slightly lower in rhesus macaques as the dose per kg used in the rhesus was 90 times lower than in cotton rats. the difference in receptors between the two animal species may be able to explain why insertion of the insert into EZ strain have further attenuated viruses and reduced immunogenicity of the virus in rhesus macaques but not in cotton rats. however, we were not able to detect measles genomes in PBMC isolated from whole blood 24 hours post vaccination. this may be attributed to the low copies of measles virus circulating in the blood or the time point used to measure the vectored vaccines were normally delivered to non-human primates by either intranasal or intratracheal inoculation route. it is possible that intranasal immunization might be more immunogenic than intramuscular vaccination in monkeys."}
