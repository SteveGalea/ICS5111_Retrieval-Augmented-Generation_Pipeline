{"summary": "three genomic BAC clones containing the human CEACAM1 gene were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized FVB mouse oocytes. the embryos were implanted in the oviducts of pseudopregnant females and allowed to term. one out of five PCR positive lines was positive for human CEACAM1 expression. pathogens that bind to CEACAM1 may interfere with normal function. the so-called \u201clong form\u201d lacks the ITIMs, but has the ability, like the long form, to bind actin, calmodulin, and annexin II [21]. eae and Neisseria meningitidis have been shown to bind via the expression of their Opa (colony opacity-associated) proteins leading to adherence and invasion into epithelial cells [11], [23], [24], as well as suppression of the T-lymphocyte response [25] and killing human B cells [26] effects that presumably inhibit antibody production. a major limitation to studying these interactions in vivo has been the lack of an animal model pBACe3.6 vector contains a chloramphenicol resistance gene as the selectable marker. the vector contains a chloramphenicol resistance gene as the selectable marker.

RNA pellets were air dried and dissolved in 50 L RNase-free water. the four RT-PCR amplified products for murine Ceacam1 correspond to the 4L, 4S, 2L and 2S mRNA splice isoforms. BAC2Clone (214 kb) covered a large region proximal to human CEACAM1 on chromosome 19. only those from BAC2 and BAC5 exhibited expression of the huCEACAM1 protein in their feces. BAC2 founders 1, 6 and 12 expressed human CEACAM1 in their gastrointestinal tract. BAC2 founders 1, 6 and 12 expressed human CEACAM1 in their gastrointestinal tract. chromosomal insertion point for the BAC clone is random in transgenic animals produced by pronuclear microinjection. the human gene is on chromosome 19 of human cells, as expected, and the BAC2 clone containing the human CEACAM1 gene was on chromosome 11 of the transgenic mice. mRNA from the human CEACAM1 can be alternatively spliced. chromosomal location of human CEACAM1 gene probe in transgenic mice. chromosomal spread showing hybridization of human CEACAM1 gene probe to chromosome 19. the expression of human CEACAM1 is similar to murine CEACAM1 in the small intestine in terms of distribution and intensity. both the murine and human CEACAM1 are expressed on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. the expression of human CEACAM1 is noticeably higher than the expression of murine CEACAM1. the expression pattern for human and murine CEACAM1 is identical to murine CEACAM1 but more intense. the pattern is consistent with the highest levels of expression in proximal tubules (less open lumen) in all cases the staining is on the luminal surface of epithelial cells of the Bowman's capsules surrounding the glomeruli in the kidney. human and murine CEACAM1 expression is higher than murine CEACAM1 in transgenic mouse kidney. however, in the liver, murine and human CEACAM1 expression in transgenic mice was similar. in the liver, murine and human CEACAM1 expression in transgenic mice was similar. genic mice may be an appropriate model for studying the role of human CEACAM1 in tumorigenesis within these organs. a. Murine CEACAM1 expression in the mammary gland (Mag 50X), B and C. Human CEACAM1 expression in the prostate gland (Mag 50X and 200X, respectively) human neutrophils stain more intensely than those from transgenic animals. no expression on T-cells and significant expression on B-cells. expression of human CEACAM1 on murine and human T-cells previously reported. transgenic mice blood neutrophils stained with anti-mouse CEACAM1. Mag. 200X (inset photo enlarged 4X) expression levels of murine and human CEACAM1 on spleen B and T cells of BAC2-12 transgenic and wild type mice. freshly isolated spleen cells (A and Spleen cells) were stained with either the anti-murine CEACAM1-PE or anti-human CEACAM1-PE. BAC2Clone (214 kb) covered a large region proximal to human CEACAM1 on chromosome 19. BAC2Clone (214 kb) covered a large region proximal to human CEACAM1 on chromosome 19. litters were obtained from mice fertilized with all three microinjections. only those from BAC2 and BAC5 transmitted the germline gene to their offspring. both murine and human CEACAM1 were detected in the feces of the founders. BAC2 founders 1, 6 and 12 expressed human CEACAM1 in their gastrointestinal tract. about 50% of pups were positive for human CEACAM1 and 100% positive for murine CEACAM1. most fecal samples were collected in the morning (7P, 8P) to determine time of collection affected the analysis. transgenic mouse liver expressed human CEACAM1-4S and -3S isoforms. transgenic kidney and small intestine expressed -4L and -3L isoforms. RT-PCR analysis for CEACAM1 isoforms in transgenic mice. RT-PCR analysis for ceacam1 isoforms in transgenic (7\u20139) or wild type mice (10\u201312) in liver (7,10), kidney (8,11), and small intestine (9,12) Neither murine nor human CEACAM1 was expressed in the hearts of BAC2-12 transgenic mice. -murine CEACAM1 antibody used here does not detect murine CEACAM2. pattern shows highest expression around the portal triads with decreased expression around the portal artery. this may reflect the known function of CEACAM1 in effecting insulin clearance. the highest levels of expression in proximal tubules (less open lumen) and lowest in distal tubules (more open lumen) in all cases the staining is on the luminal surface of epithelial cells of the Bowman's capsules surrounding the glomeruli in the kidney. expression pattern of both murine and human CEACAM1 in the transgenic animals is confined to the bile canaluculi. a first step in using these transgenic animals as a model for mammary and prostate cancer we examined its expression in these tissues. in the mammary gland, it was necessary to study pregnant females, since the mammary gland is minimally developed in non-pregnant females. the mammary gland is minimally developed in non-pregnant females. murine and human CEACAM1 stain more intensely than those from transgenic animals. staining for human CEACAM1 was negative for a CEACAM1/ littermate. for purposes of comparison, neutrophils from a human blood smear were stained. single cell suspensions of bone marrow from TG or WT mice were stained with either anti-murine CEACAM1-PE or anti-human CEACAM1-PE. results shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results. primed neutrophils from transgenic animals were able to bind E.coli-Opa52 much greater than E. coli-vector control. controls included binding of the parental (Opa-) strain on wild type neutrophils and Opa52-expressing bacteria binding to human neutrophils. generation of human CEACAM1 transgenic mice is an important model to demonstrate equivalence in function of the murine and human gene orthologs. the model must mimic the human tissue specific pattern of CEACAM1 expression. both murine Ceacam1 and human CEACAM1 genes produce multiple mRNA splice isoforms. the expected major splice isoforms of murine Ceacam1 were found in both control and transgenic mice with a predominance of the -2S isoform. the human CEACAM1 gene generates mRNAs with different splice isoforms, namely -4L/S and -3L/S. the expected human splice isoforms were observed in the BAC2-12 transgenic line. human CEACAM1 expression closely mimics the mouse, with perhaps a caveat about the differential expression of the two murine Ceacam genes in the mouse. in the kidney, the tissue staining patterns were identical but the intensity of staining for human CEACAM1 was greater than for murine CEACAM1 in the kidney. Neisseria specific protein was previously shown to confer binding to human neutrophils or to Hela cells transfected with human CEACAM1 [8]. the protein had previously been shown to confer binding to human neutrophils or to human neutrophils."}
