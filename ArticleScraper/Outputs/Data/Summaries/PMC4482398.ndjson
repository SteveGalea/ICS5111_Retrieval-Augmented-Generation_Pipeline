{"summary": "rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an auto-immune disease characterized by a systemic chronic inflammation, which primarily affects the joints. the presence of autoreactive B cells to type II Collagen (CII), rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide in the sera of RA patients is associated with a higher risk of mortality and morbidity. CIA is inducible in DBA/1 prone mice through immunization with heterologous CII emulsified in adjuvant. major clinical symptoms are paw swelling, cartilage damage and bone erosion. the major role of B cells is the production of arthritogenic anti-CII specific antibodies (Abs) of different isotypes. mice were immunized with 100g of type II collagen (CII) emulsified in Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (CFA) intradermally into the tail. three weeks post-induction, immunized mice were boosted with 100g of CII. tsetse flies infected with non-clonal T. brucei AnTAR1 parasites were stored at 80\u00b0C. parasites were a kind gift from N. Van Meirvenne (Institute for Tropical Medicine, Belgium) serial serum dilutions were added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. the next day, plates were incubated with anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 and IgM isotypes coupled to horse Radish peroxydase (Lo-Imex, Louvain, BE) immunized mice were boosted with 100g of CII in Incomplete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (IFA) mice were monitored and evaluated two to three times per week for arthritic incidences. tsetse fly and uninfected mice were treated i.p. with diminazene aceturate. parasites were counted via blood dilution (1/200 in PBS) every 2 to 4 days using a counting chamber and a light microscope. trypanosomosis was able to modulate the course of CIA in mice. mice were infected with T. brucei two weeks post-immunization with CII. results showed a significant delay in CIA development in the infected group. Graphs show the mean SD from at least n = 6 mice per group. data are representative of two independent experiments. T. brucei infection reduces the titers of circulating anti-Type II collagen IgGs. the reduced onset of CIA in T. brucei-infected mice correlates with decreased levels of circulating anti-CII specific antibodies. one group was infected with T. brucei (filled and open triangle) on day 14 i.p. and the other was left untreated (filled and open square and triangle) a gradual but drastic enhancement of the mean arthritic score per mouse was observed in the group of mice that were infected. a significant increase in the titers of anti-CII Abs belonging to the IgG2a isotype was observed between day 38 and 56 post-CIA induction in the CIA-primed and infected group. the usual route of infection in the T. brucei mouse model is the intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. a physiological infection also mediates a drastic decrease in anti-CII specific IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies by day 28 post-immunization. we observed a decline in the mean arthritic score per mouse in mice treated with Berenil. the most obvious explanation was that the drug could not sterilize the host from the parasite. similar results were observed in one independent experiment following intraperitoneal infection with T. brucei. trypanosomosis substantially delays the onset of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice. mice were immunized primarily with CII in CFA on day 0 and secondarily with CII in IFA on day 21. one group of mice was infected with T. brucei on day 14 i.p. and the other was left untreated (filled square) titers of specific anti-CII IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b Ab level are similar in both CIA-induced groups. however, 35 days post-CIA in CFA priming, we observed a significant decrease (between 80- and 240-fold) in all anti-CII IgG isotypes titers between the infected group compared to the uninfected group (Fig 2A, 2B and 2C treatment of infected mice with the anti-trypanosomal drug, Berenil, restores the development of CIA. all T. brucei-infected mice die within approximately 45 days post-CIA induction (30 days post-infection) treatment restores the appearance of the CIA-associated clinical symptoms. both groups were treated with trypanocidal drug, Berenil, at (A,B) day 38 (i.p.) or (C,D) day 28 (tsetse) serial serum dilution levels of anti-CII IgG2a and IgG2b Abs were measured by ELISA on day 38 (before Berenil, filled square and triangle) and day 56 (open square and triangle) arthritic score per mouse tended to catch up with the one of the uninfected group. a physiological infection also mediates a drastic decrease in anti-CII specific IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies by day 28 post-immunization. following tsetse fly infection, the drug treatment restored anti-CII specific IgG2a and to some extent, IgG2b antibody titers. the helminthic therapy concept is based on the deliberate infestation of a helminth or the helminth eggs in order to treat auto-immune disorders. the immune response developed against the parasitic worm infection, mainly a Th2-skewed response, could counteract the immuno-pathological reactions, usually referred as Th1-polarised response, driving autoimmune diseases. arthritogenic anti-CII specific Abs correlated with a drastic decrease of CII specific Ab titers of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes. in 2000, rats infected with CII antigen significantly exhibited a delayed onset associated with decreased titers of anti-CII IgG but without affecting T cell-mediated DTH response to CII. onset of CIA is associated to substantial impairment of anti-CII Ab levels. but Berenil treatment noticeably restores these titers. the decrease incidence of RA signs starting after day 45 suggests trypanosomes could alleviate the clinical outcome most likely via its impact on B cells."}
