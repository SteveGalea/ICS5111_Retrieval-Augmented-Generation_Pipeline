WONV mRNA levels peaked at 24 hpi and declined by 5-fold at 72 hpi. WONV infection in C6/36 cells resulted in almost no visible CPE. titers in C6/36 cells peaked at 1 106 TCID50/ml at 24 hpi. WONV titers were significantly lower in C6/36 cells. double-stranded siRNAs targeting WONV N gene (siRNA[N]) and U3 gene (siRNA[WU3]) transcripts were used to determine if WONV expression is required for efficient viral replication in cell culture. the specificity of the siRNAs for the knockdown of each target protein was established by using GFP fusion constructs expressed from transfected plasmids. expression of U3 at a high MOI overwhelms the level of overexpression from the plasmid. WONV U3 siRNA does not target plasmid-expressed WONV N mRNA. positive cells were identified and quantified by using an Evos FL microscope. WONV U3 mRNA quantification by qRT-PCR following transfection with siRNA[Luc] or siRNA directed against WONV U3 (siRNA[U3]). qRT-PCR followed transfection with siRNA[Luc], siRNA[N], or siRNA[U3]. WONV TCID50 titration following transfection with siRNA[Luc], siRNA[N], or siRNA[U3]. a cDNA target library was constructed from beFV-infected C6/36 cells. a bait plasmid was constructed by using an amplified full-length clone of the WONV U3 ORF. the screen identified a strong interaction with a 249-bp insert encoding the 83-aa C-terminal region of a 371-aa polypeptide. the predicted nuclear export signal is boxed. WONV U3 interacts with the full-length SNF5 from insect and mammalian cells. lysates of WONV-infected Vero cells were transfected with either pAcGFP1-C2 or pAcGFP1-C2(WU3). lysates were prepared and incubated with GFP binding proteins coupled to agarose beads. lysates were prepared and incubated with GFP binding proteins coupled to agarose beads. the double band detected was observed in previous studies (15, 16) but not in lysates from cells transfected with the empty vector pAcGFP1-C2. the antibody detecting both SNF5 isoforms (Smarc1a and Smarc1b) the 83-aa C-terminal domain of AaSNF5 was also cloned downstream of E. coli maltose binding protein. the strong intranuclear fluorescence observed in COS-7 cells transfected with plasmid pAcGFP1-C2(WU3) increased following treatment with LMB. similar results were observed following transfection of COS-7 cells with pEGFP-C1-RVP-P1 expressing the rabies virus P protein. pAcGFP1-C2, pAcGFP1-C2(WU3), and pEGFP-C1-RVP-P1 were treated with leptomycin B at 24 h posttransfection. images such as those shown in panel A were used to calculate the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fn/c) SNF5 mRNA quantification by qRT-PCR (B) and WONV TCID50 titers (C) in C6/36 and BHK-BSR cells transfected with siRNA directed against the luciferase control (siRNA[Luc] or SNF5 (siRNA[Snf5]) and infected with WONV at 6 h posttransfection. control luciferase siRNA, treatment with SNF5 siRNA resulted in a small but significant (0.5 log TCID50/ml) increase in WONV titers in both C6/36 and BHK-BSR cells. WONV U3 inhibits SNF5-regulated gene expression. WONV infection levels were 10-fold higher in BHK-BSR cells. these data indicate that WONV infection and overexpression of WONV U3 inhibit SNF5-regulated expression of CSF1. this was determined by N gene transcript levels, which were 10-fold higher in BHK-BSR cells than in vero cells. WONV U3 mRNA levels were detected in vero and BHK-BSR cells from 14 hpi, peaked at 24 to 48 hpi and then declined as the CPE progressed. WONV U3 was also detected in BHK-BSR cells by immunofluorescence and was localized predominantly in the nucleus. WONV titers were significantly lower than those observed in vero and BHK-BSR cells. titers in C6/36 cells peaked at 1 106 TCID50/ml at 24 hpi. titers declined by 48 hpi to stabilize at 8 103 TCID50/ml at 72 hpi. treatment of cells with control siRNA[Luc] resulted in a significant reduction in WONV U3 mRNA levels compared to those in cells treated with control siRNA[Luc]. overexpression of WONV U3 led to an 6.5-fold increase in WONV titers at 48 h postinfection. positive cells were identified and quantified by using the Evos FL cell imaging system (Life Technologies) positive cells were identified and quantified by using an unpaired two-tailed Student t test with GraphPad Prism 6C. significant differences are indicated (***, P 0.001; **, P 0.01; NS, not significant) WONV infection was conducted at an MOI of 0.1 TCID50/cell (F) or MOIs of 0.1 TCID50/cell and 1.0 TCID50/cell (G). a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify cellular proteins that may interact with WONV U3. two-hybrid assay to demonstrate the binding of WONV U3 to full-length AaSNF5. all possible plasmid combinations were transformed into the two respective Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. no nonspecific interactions occurred between either WONV U3 or AaSNF5 and components of the yeast two-hybrid system. pGADT7 alone or pGADT7(AaSNF5) was mated with either pGBKT7 or pGBKT7(WU3) the resulting yeast strains were streaked out on (1) yeast peptone dextrose adenine medium (YPDA), (2) synthetic complete (SC) medium without leucine (SCleu/trp), (3) SC medium without leucine or tryptophan (SCleu/trp/his/ lane 5, 38-hpi extract from WONV-infected Vero cells. lane 6, 14-hpi extract from WONV-infected Vero cells. immunoblot was probed with polyclonal anti-WU3 chicken antiserum. kDa WONV U3 colocalizes with SNF5 in the nucleus. WONV U3 and SNF5 were found to colocalize in the nucleus. no clear direct association was detected. WONV U3 colocalizes with SNF5 in the nucleus and is actively exported from the nucleus via CRM1. WONV U3 (labeled green) and WONV U3 (green) colocalize in vero cells transfected with plasmids pAcRFP-C2(SNF5) and pAcGFP-C2(WU3). SNF5 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR following infection of C6/36 cells with WONV, BEFV, or WONV. expression levels returned to normal by 24 hpi. level of SNF5 induction varied from 4-fold for WNV to 2.5-fold for WONV. the immunoblots were probed with SNF5 antibody and actin antibody (Abcam) assays were conducted at 24 h posttransfection. TCID50 titrations were performed in vero cells. regulated gene expression, vero and BHK-BSR cells were mock infected with 1 TCID50/cell WONV and transfected with pAcGFP1-C2(WU3) or control vector pAcGFP1-C2 at 6 hpi. in each cell line, WONV U3 overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in CSF1 transcript levels compared to those in control untreated cells. overexpression of WONV DISCUSSION The evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryote cells. it comprises 10 to 12 proteins, including an invariant core complex and variable subunits that regulate the transcription of target genes by the ATP-dependent mobilization of nucleosomes and chromatin remodeling. WONV U3 colocates with SNF5 in the nucleus and blocks SNF5-regulated gene expression. in insect cells, SNF5 is upregulated in response to infection with WONV. inhibition of SNF5 expression by siRNA knockdown favors WONV replication. SF1 expression shown to be inhibited by WONV U3, further work is required to determine if WONV U3/SNF5 interaction is specifically targeting host antiviral defenses. WONV U3 was found to accumulate in the nucleus by laser scanning confocal microscopy, and the nuclear localization was significantly enhanced. the function of the coiled-coil region is currently unknown, but it is highly conserved across eukaryote SNF5 orthologs. evidence shows that WONV U3 can bind to SNF5 in both vertebrate and mosquito cells. the SWI/SNF complex is known to regulate the expression of vertebrate immune response genes (18, 25) WONV U1 and WONV U2 lack the characteristic asparagine-rich C-terminal domain of WONV U3. there is no evidence of an NLS in either protein, suggesting that it may indeed have a nuclear function. rabies virus is predicted to contain an NES in the N-terminal domain. particular interest is the role of viral accessory proteins in insect cells. little is known of the processes of infection and immunity."}
