{"summary": "the burden of severe respiratory illness and the contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses are not well documented in the region. lack of diagnostic capacity, similarity of influenza presentation with common febrile illnesses, and prioritization of other high-burden public health problems are likely contributory factors. the queen Elizabeth central hospital (QECH) is the only government inpatient facility providing free health care to the 1.3 million residents of Blantyre district. up to 74% of patients admitted to the QECH medical wards are HIV infected. nasopharyngeal aspirates were stored at 80\u00b0C in universal transport medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy) these were batch-tested for influenza A and B by real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI per 100,000 people was estimated using the adjusted number of medically attended influenza-positive SARIs. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs to compare clinical variables between influenza-positive and influenza-negative patients. a score of greater than 4 has been shown to be predictive of inpatient mortality in both well-resourced19,20 and African settings. covariates with a P value of 0.2 on univariable analysis were assessed for significance using backward stepwise selection. factor with 2-sided P values of 0.05 were considered significant. 1N1)pdm09 vaccine campaign targeting health-care workers and pregnant women occurred in 2010.15 Study procedures. Consecutive patients from the start of the day fulfilling the SARI case definition were recruited (maximum four per day) samples with a Ct value 40 were recorded as positive. human immunodeficiency virus testing was performed according to WHO guidelines. ficiency virus\u2013associated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by dividing incidence in HIV-infected strata by the incidence in HIV-uninfected strata. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs to compare clinical variables between influenza-positive and influenza-negative patients. 58 (50.3%) were HIV infected. thirtyteen individuals reported receipt of influenza vaccination in the previous year. 58 (50.3%) were HIV infected. influenza viruses were detected in 163 (14.5%) SARI cases. rhinovirus was detected in 149 (13.3%), coronavirus OC43 in 49 (4.4%), RSV in 48 (4.2%), and adenovirus in 47 (4.2%). the prevalence of other respiratory viruses did not differ by HIV status. 59 (30.5%) were influenza B. there were annual cycles of influenza activity, but timing of peak detection varied year to year. peaks in influenza activity coincided with months with high relative humidity. hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI in HIV-infected adults was 46.2 (95% CI: 37.5\u201356.3) per 100,000 and 9.4 (95% CI: 8.1\u201310.9) per 100,000 in HIV-infected adults. a higher proportion of influenza-positive SARI patients reported headache (90.1 versus 83.6%, OR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.02\u20133.13, P = 0.04) Gendera Male 489 431 (88.1) 58 (11.9) Ref \u2013 \u2013 Female 636 532 (83.5) 105 (16.5) 1.47 (1.04\u20132.07) 0.03 1.57 (1.10\u20132.26) 0.01 Age group (years) 15\u201324 231 191 (82.7) 40 (17.3) 1.37 (0.89\u20132.11) 0.36 1.23 (0.78\u20131.95) 0.68 25\u201334 419 359 (85.7) 60 (14.3) 1.10 (0. 238 of 1,126 patients with SARI (21.1%) had clinically severe disease (MEWS > 4).

HIV-infected adults aged 15\u201349 years had 5-fold greater incidence of hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI compared with HIV-uninfected adults. a small proportion of patients may have presented to a traditional healer or to one of the two private hospitals in Blantyre. human immunodeficiency virus infection, identified in more than 50% of adults with SARI, was the sole individual risk factor associated with increased clinical severity. many African adult pneumonia cohorts have reported a high prevalence of HIV infection (52\u201394%). HIV-infected adults aged 15\u201349 years had a 5-fold greater incidence of influenza-positive SARI than HIV-uninfected adults. study corroborates with studies in Malawi, Kenya, and south africa that have identified HIV as a major risk factor for influenza burden25. the presence of other respiratory viruses is of uncertain significance. limiting recruitment to the first four cases of the day could have resulted in selection bias. patients with SARI could have sought health care in facilities other than QECH. a threshold of greater than four is predictive of inpatient mortality. this study provides a baseline for understanding the complexities of SARI epidemiology in adults in Malawi and other similar settings."}
