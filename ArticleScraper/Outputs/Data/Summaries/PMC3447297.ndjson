{"summary": "520 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 have been reported. of which 307 died due to disease complications. other avian influenza viruses including low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) can also be a risk to public health. the external domain of M2 (M2e) is recognized by the host's immune system. a multiple antigenic peptide construct containing M2e (M2e-MAP) induced strong M2e-specific antibody titers in the serum of mice and resulted in significant protection against the virus. peptide nanoparticles represent a novel type of repetitive antigen display system which allows presenting the M2e peptide in high density in both, either in its monomeric or its tetrameric form. this idea was first presented in Raman et al., 2006 [21]. biophysical characterization of nanoparticles and immunological profiling using chickens as test animals. results suggest self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle shows promise as a potential vaccine against AI. the plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. expression was induced with isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside. cells were removed from 37\u00b0C and harvested by centrifugation. the peptide Mono-M2e is composed of a pentameric coiled coil (green) and a trimeric coiled coil (blue) in both sequences, the M2e epitope is shown in red. other amino acid residues, such as linkers and his-tags, are shown in black. the protein solution was filtered with a 0.1 m polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter. nanoparticle self-assembly was performed by dialysis into buffer containing 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. electron microscopy Samples were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. the peptide concentration of the constructs was about 0.05 mg/mL. the peptide concentration of the constructs was about 0.05 mg/mL. chicken embryo kidney cell monolayers were washed twice with prewarmed PBS and 400 L of the above mixture was added to the CEKC monolayer. after 72 h, the plates were checked for plaque formation and stained with crystal violet for plaque counting. plates were rinsed with 2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS/Tween 20 ThermoFisher) plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3-4 h or 4\u00b0C overnight. dilutions of each serum sample were prepared in a PBS solution containing 0.5% BSA. RT-PCR was performed using a Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the standard manufacturer's protocol. the amplified fragment was excised from the gel and cDNA was recovered from agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. copy numbers of purified RNA were determined using a previously described method. real-time RT-PCR was performed using the previously published primers M+25: AGA TGA TTC TAA CCG AGG TCG and M-124: TGC AAA AAC ATC TCT CTG. chickens were inoculated both intranasally and intraocularly with 0.2\u20131 mL diluted allantoic fluid depending on the treatment group. the low-dose challenge group received a 0.2 mL diluted allantoic fluid containing 106 EID50. the high-dose challenge group received 1 mL of allantoic fluid containing 107.7 EID50. received 1 mL allantoic fluid containing 107.2 EID50 LPAI subtype H5N2 divided among the eyes, nasal cavity, and oropharynx. fresh air was resumed after 5-10 min the following challenge of the last bird in the isolator. plasmids containing the peptide monomers were constructed by cloning complementary oligonucleotides (CCCGGGGGGGGGGGCAGCCTGCTGACCGAAGTG) into the avian M2e epitope with flanking residues (ARGGSGSLLTEVETPTRNGWE**E) into the XmaI/EcoRI restriction sites of the basic SAPN expression construct to yield Mono-M2e. the pellet was thawed on ice and suspended in a lysis buffer. cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 30.500 g for 45 min. the column was washed with lysis buffer and then a buffer containing 9 M urea, 500 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM citrate, 20 mM imidazole, and 0.2 mM TCEP in both sequences, the M2e epitope is shown in red. other amino acid residues, such as linkers and his-tags, are shown in black. monomeric M2e, used for ELISA, coating is shown in red. nanoparticle self-assembly was performed by dialysis into buffer containing 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol, at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. this was followed by dialysis into the same buffer containing decreasing concentrations of urea. influenza virus used in direct challenge AI study was A/Turkey/CA/D0208651-C/02 H5N2 low pathogenic. Viruses were grown and titered in 9-to 11-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs as previously described. chickens were divided into groups, bled for baseline serology, transferred to isolators equipped with high-efficiency particulate air filters. chicken embryo kidney cell monolayers in 6-well plates were washed twice with prewarmed PBS and 400 L of the above mixture was added to the CEKC monolayer. the plates were incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. after 2 washes with prewarmed PBS, they were overlaid with 0.8% agar. after 72 h, the plates were checked for plaque formation. dilutions of each serum sample were prepared in a PBS solution containing 0.2 to 0.5% BSA. serum from previously infected birds with the LPAI subtype H9N2 or commercial anti-M2e antibody were used as positive controls. sera from healthy, unvaccinated birds were used as a negative control. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis through ethidium-bromide-stained (0.5 g/mL) 1.5% (40 mM Tris-Acetate pH 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA) agarose gels were excised from the gel and cDNA was recovered from agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA extraction was done on each swab sample followed by PCR in duplicate or triplicate. the power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit was used with a 20 L reaction mixture. viral loads were calculated using fluorescence data acquired at the end of each annealing step. 42 SPF chickens were divided into six groups of seven and received their first inoculation at 2 weeks of age followed by two boosters, two weeks apart, at 10 weeks and 12 weeks after hatch. the nanoparticle vaccine constructs were emulsified with either Freund's complete adjuvant (prime) or Freund's incomplete adjuvant (boosters) and injected into the pectoral muscle of each chicken. tra-M2e + + + G4 75 Tetra-M2e + + + + G5 \u2014 PBS + G6 \u2014 Nonvaccinated Complete Freund's adjuvant was used for the priming vaccine. challenge with LPAI subtype H5N2 was performed at 8 weeks of age using oculonasal route. the mono-M2e species of nanoparticle follows this plan. it displays a monomeric form of M2e on the surface of the nanoparticles. the mono-M2e peptide on the icosahedral nanoparticles lacks its C-terminal five residues to avoid disulfide crosslinking. the full-length M2e contains two cysteine residues. the formation of disulfide bridges between the cysteines under oxidizing conditions is thought to stabilize their tetrameric conformation. the speed and ease of protein expression and purification contribute to the overall viability of this technology as a vaccine platform. the experiments were performed in the buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. it can be seen that neither Mono-M2e nor Tetra-M2e form nanoparticles with perfectly spherical morphology. b) Tetra-M2e at a concentration of 0.132 mg/mL. experiments were performed in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. 3.4. testing Neutralization Capability of anti-M2e antibody. chickens were infected with 106 EID50 and 107.7 EID50 of the virus. tracheal and cloacal virus shedding was evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 days postinfection. the 107.7 EID50 was found to be a good indicator of virus shedding. after vaccination and challenge study, we determined viral loads in tracheal and cloacal swabs samples on day 8 following challenge with 107.2 EID50 LPAI subtype H5N2. it is seen that virus shedding reduction starts at day 4 post infection with a significant decrease at day 8 post infection. it is seen that virus shedding reduction starts at day 4 post infection with a significant decrease at day 8 post infection. cloacal virus shedding and tracheal virus load were measured for Mono-M2e (monomeric M2e), TetraM2e (tetrameric M2e), PBS, and control negative. tracheal virus load was measured for Tetra-M2e (tetrameric M2e) with adjuvant (black) in comparison with PBS challenge control (gray) at 4, 6, and 8 days post challenge. the mono-M2e peptide on the icosahedral nanoparticles lacks its C-terminal five residues to avoid problems with disulfide crosslinking. the epitope is now constrained to its native tetrameric conformation. the full-length M2e contains two cysteine residues. to facilitate purification, we have included polyhistidine tags at the N-terminal ends of the peptides. to enable detection of antibodies against tetrameric M2e, the peptide M2eN-GCN4 was designed. the effect is similar to that experienced by the ends of the tetrameric coiled coil from tetrabrachion of the Tetra-M2e nanoparticle. the experiments were performed in the buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. it can be seen from the micrographs that neither Mono-M2e nor Tetra-M2e form nanoparticles with perfectly spherical morphology. anti-M2e antibody was monitored by determining the titer of the M2e-specific IgY at three different time points (2 weeks after each inoculation) chickens after each inoculation developed high levels of antibody against the injected construct and anamnestic response clearly was seen when the plates were coated with mono-M2e nanoparticles. chickens were infected with 106 EID50 and 107.7 EID50 of the virus. tracheal and cloacal virus shedding was evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 days postinfection. ELISA response from chicken vaccinated with tetra-M2e was higher than expected. Virus shedding was evaluated at day 4 and day 6 after challenge. it is seen that virus shedding reduction starts at day 4 post infection with a significant decrease at day 8 post infection. cloacal shedding was significantly different (P 0.05) at 4, 6, and 8 days post challenge. tracheal virus load was measured for Tetra-M2e (tetrameric M2e) with adjuvant. was significantly different (P 0.05). the pathogenicity after challenge with the LPAI subtype H5N2 virus was evaluated. the peaks for tracheal and cloacal shedding were at days 4 and 8 postinfection. the tetra-M2e vaccine construct provided a significant viral load reduction. in this study, we showed that anti-M2e antibodies are not neutralizing antibodies; however they are capable of binding to the M2 proteins that are abundantly presented on the surface of the infected cells. this can describe an efficient delayed clearance of the virus in vaccinated chickens with tetrameric M2e. this may be considered in a new vaccination strategy by vaccinating chickens with both a killed vaccine and a nanoparticle vaccine in order to provide robust protection, cross- new approach to immunizing chickens against AI should demonstrate that they are effective tools for stimulation of an immune response against M2e and other B- or T-cell epitopes. application of nanoparticle platform facilitates the development of a new generation of vaccines that harbor conserved epitopes of avian influenza viruses."}
