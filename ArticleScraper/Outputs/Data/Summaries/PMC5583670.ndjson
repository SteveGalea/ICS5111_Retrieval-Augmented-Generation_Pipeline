{"summary": "coVs include four genera (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-CoVs) and are the main cause of global outbreaks of porcine diarrhea. TGEV is the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) which can cause severe diarrhea with high morbidity in suckling piglets. the results provide valuable information about coV recombination and evolution. tissue from one small intestine and 14 anal tissue strips were harvested from a pig farm in anhui hefei. clinical symptoms were vomiting, yellow and watery diarrhea, rapid weight loss and dehydration. each PCR amplicon was obtained via one-step RT-PCR. PCR reactions were performed as follows: pre-denaturation for 5 min at 94 \u00b0C. 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, annealing for 30 s at 55 \u00b0C, and extension for 2.5 min at 72 \u00b0C. the cells were incubated with mAb 5E816 (1:100) for 1 h to detect the N protein of TGEV AHHF for 60 min; then, they were washed three times with PBST. the stained cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, KPL, USA) total RNA was extracted using a Spin Column RNA Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. the probe used was 5\u2032-FAM-CGT GAC TTC TAT CTG GCC ATC TTC-TAMRA-3\u2032. tissue from one small intestine and 14 anal tissue strips were harvested from a pig farm in anhui hefei. clinical symptoms were vomiting, yellow and watery diarrhea, rapid weight loss and dehydration. TGEV AHHF strain was passaged in PK15 cells containing 0.2 g/mL trypsin. all PCR reactions were performed as follows: pre-denaturation for 5 min at 94 \u00b0C. 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, annealing for 30 s at 55 \u00b0C, and extension for 2.5 min at 72 \u00b0C. a final 10-min total extension step at 72 \u00b0C. cells were incubated with mAb 5E816 (1:100) for 1 h to detect the N protein of TGEV AHHF for 60 min. then, they were washed three times with PBST. the cells were visualized using the 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine liquid substrate system. specific primers for amplifying the N gene of TGEV were used. the probe used was 5\u2032-FAM-CGT GAC TTC TAT CTG GCC ATC TTC-TAMRA-3\u2032. quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using a lightCycler 480 II. TGEV AHHF strain Tissue from one small intestine and 14 anal strips were harvested from a pig farm in AHHF in china. vomiting and diarrhea were present in the piglets at this farm. characterization of the TGEV AHHF strain. a total of 28 614 nt (containing poly(A) were determined for the TGEV AHHF strain. the 3\u2032 end of the genome contained a 273-nt untranslated sequence and a poly (A) tail. upstream of the poly (A) tail was a 5\u2032-GGAAGAGC-3\u2032 octameric sequence. the complete genome sequence of the AHHF strain was compared with those of other TGEV reference strains.

TGEV AHHF was detected in all samples of infected stomachs and intestines. the viral RNA levels at 96 h P.I. and the copies/g of TGEV RNA reached the highest levels in the jejunum. the amount of virus in the parenchymal organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) was relatively low (1\u20133 log10 RNA copies/g) the PCR results and viral RNA distribution of piglet tissues inoculated with TGEV AHHF. TGEV detection showed positive results in the small intestine tissue but negative results in the anal strips. the TGEV AHHF strain was named the TGEV AHHF strain. the TCID50 of TGEV AHHF (105.12/mL) was measured using the Reed\u2013Muench method. 3b (nt 25 139\u201325 873), E (nt 25 860\u201326 108), M (nt 26 119\u201326 907), N (nt 26 920\u201328 068), 7 (nt 28 074\u201328 310) and the 3\u2032 UTR (nt 28 311\u201328 614) the AHHF strain was more closely related to the Purdue strain group than to the Miller strain group. phylogenetic analysis of the complete TGEV AHHF S gene showed that it was closely related to the Miller strain group. however, phylogenetic analysis of E (Figure 2C), M (Figure 2D) and N (Figure 2E) showed that they were closely related to the Purdue strain group. 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 382 384 ORF7 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 78 Previous research has shown that there are two deletions in the TGEV S protein (a 3-nt deletion and a phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1a genes suggested that the TGEV AHHF strain was more closely related to the Miller strain group. however, phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF7 genes suggested that they shared a close relationship with the Purdue strain group. previous research had demonstrated the existence of two deletions in the TGEV ORF3 gene. breakpoints for potential recombination zones were found at two locations, the ORF1a gene (nt 4144\u20139918 [aa 1286\u20133210 in pp1a]) the major parent strain of the recombination located in the ORF1a gene was SC-Y, and the minor parent strain was H16 (Figure 4B). both SC-Y and H16 viruses show a strong pathogenicity in piglets. at nt positions 4084\u20134143, the RNA structure of TGEV AHHF was similar to that of SC-Y. at nucleotide positions 9993\u201310 052 (downstream of the 4144\u20139918 breakpoint) we found that the reorganization located at the S gene of TGEV AHHF was from strains SC-Y and H16. all piglets inoculated with TGEV AHHF died within the 96 h P.I. period. pathological changes were observed in the jejunum and ileum. at 96 h P.I., the viral levels in the stomach reached 4\u20135 log10 RNA copies/g of TGEV RNA. the amount of virus in the parenchymal organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) was relatively low (1\u20133 log10 RNA copies/g) the AHHF strain is an enteric virus. the coV S protein is the major immunogenic protein of the virus. aa 585 is A, which is located in the major antigenic sites A/B. there is a 6-nt deletion in some Purdue cluster strains, including PUR-46 MAD and Purdue P115, but not in virulent Purdue. this deletion was not found in TGEV AHHF, suggesting that TGEV AHHF may be a virulent strain. previous studies have shown the potential involvement of the TGEV ORF3 gene in viral virulence or tropism. recombination occurs among CoVs,35, 36 such as in PEDV37, 38 and canine CoV. homologous RNA recombination is one of the major \u2018powers\u2019 of genetic evolution and diversity. some TGEV viruses belonging to the Miller group have been found in china. TGEV AHHF is a recombinant virus between the Miller cluster and the Purdue cluster. the immunogenicity of TGEV AHHF and the protection of piglets against viral attack from the Miller cluster or the Purdue cluster should be investigated."}
