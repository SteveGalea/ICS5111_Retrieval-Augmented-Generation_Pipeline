{"summary": "biological samples from dogs suspected to have canine distemper (CDV) were collected and screened for viral RNA. results were detected in 34% (48/141) of dogs suspected to have CD. 53 studies were selected for a total of 11,527 dogs. canine morbillivirus (previously known as canine distemper virus) is one of the major pathogens in canine populations. it causes one of the most contagious and fatal diseases for domestic dogs. despite the existence of a vaccine, several reports highlight CDV. there are several gaps related to CDV epidemiology. the frequency of infections in domestic dogs is still poorly characterized. the sample size of most studies is relatively small. there is no robust analysis of the risk factors associated with CD/CDV. reverse transcription, PCR and nested PCR were performed for the purpose of partial detection of the CDV nucleoprotein (N) gene. the molecular identity of the PCR product of expected size (287 bp) was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ACTGene An\u00e1lises Moleculares Ltda., RS, Brazil) the following inclusion criteria were used: 1) original articles published in scientific journals. included information on serological and molecular surveys for the detection of CDV in domestic dogs. 3) seroepidemiological surveys for the detection of anti-CDV antibodies. the quality assessment of the studies referred to a modified method composed of the participant selection methodology, laboratory tests and outcome variables (S2 File). Statistical analyses Data collection required for analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes were initially extracted using Microsoft Excel (S3 File). cross-sectional study With the main purpose of laboratory diagnosis of CDV, the present study was approved by the ethics committee on the use of animals of the Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e1s. samples from domestic dogs showing clinical signs suggestive of CD were collected between 2017 and 2019. the molecular identity of the PCR product of expected size (287 bp) was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ACTGene An\u00e1lises Moleculares Ltda., RS, Brazil). systematic review and meta-analysis. anti-CDV antibodies included data concerning groups of animals not vaccinated against CDV. data secondary to CDV positivity to analyze risk factors such as gender, age, vaccine status, breed, coinfection and lifestyle. small scale studies with a sample size 50 were extracted. in STATA, the metaprop, metafunnel and metaninf commands were used for data analysis and the generation of forest and funnel plots. the relative frequency was determined by the number of cases (CDV positivity) divided by the total number of animals screened and the results were expressed as percentages. search strategy After defining the research protocol, we performed a systematic search in the PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases. we sought additional studies through screening the references of selected articles and highly cited reviews of the topic of interest. the main outcomes of interest in the data analysis were: 1) the proportion of CDV cases (laboratory confirmed to clinically suspected CD-positive dogs); 2) the proportion of cases with recent and/or previous CDV infection that were laboratory confirmed among apparently healthy dogs. the secondary outcomes represented the determination of previously cited risk factors compared to the CDV positivity. 95% Confidence intervals (CI) for the average ES were calculated with the formula: 95% CI = ES 1.96 * SE, where SE is the standard error (SE = (pq/n)) the dichotomous data of the selected studies were extracted and plotted in a 2x2 table to obtain individual and combined odds ratios (ORs) the molecular identity was obtained by sequencing the amplicons generated by nested PCR. the sequenced amplicons were identified with 99% homology to the partial segment of the CDV N gene. 53 eligible studies constituted the present meta-analysis [14,16,29\u201379] color intensity categories represent the number of studies included in the meta-analysis (A) the individual estimated frequency of laboratory confirmed CDV positivity in domestic dogs is shown (B) the CDV positivity is represented by the different colors and the total number of animals screened by the size of the circles. greater positivity was observed for samples from ocular fluids (54%, 95% CI: 37\u201372), urine (51%, 95% CI: 40\u201362) and blood (46%, 95% CI: 36\u201357 (serological assays) reduced positive frequency rates were found in blood lymphocytes (38%, 95% CI: 29\u201348), blood (37%, 95% CI: 24\u201350 (molecular assays) a lower proportion of positive CDVs occurred when using quantitative PCR assays (8%, 95% CI: 0\u201323) and IFA (26%, 95% CI: 17\u201336). the proportion of CDV positivity was higher for free-ranging dogs (55%, 95% CI: 40\u201370) compared to the overall estimates of 37% (antigen surveys) and 46% (antibody surveys) positivity was observed in relation to the following variables: free-ranging dogs (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.05\u20131.97), age of dogs >24 months (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.10\u20133.05); and unvaccinated dogs (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.26\u20136.77). the other variables, such as gender, breed and incomplete vaccination status, had no association. bias, asymmetry of the funnel plot was noted for the CDV positivity frequency subgroups molecular surveys, serological surveys and free-ranging dogs. 141 clinical samples were collected from dogs exhibiting signs suggestive of CD. the mean age was 39 months (range 2\u2013204), and most dogs were females (53%). in some studies, the mean age was 34.5 months (41.2) [30,42\u201344]. the majority of the animals included in the risk analysis were pups (12 months, n = 2581) and adults (>24 months, n = 2497). in contrast to the cross-sectional study, there was a higher proportion of males than females (1.4:1). based on antigenic results was 37% (95% CI: 25\u201350) a higher viral positivity was observed when systemic clinical signs were present (75%, 95% CI: 34\u2013100), followed by systemic and neurological (56%, 95% CI: 36\u201376), ocular (55%, 95% CI: 22\u201385), neurological (41%, 95% CI: 30\u201352), gastrointestinal (29%, 95% CI: 19\u201340) and respiratory signs (25%, 95% Fig 4A shows the forest plot of CDV positivity according to the type of biological sample surveyed. the proportion of CDV positivity is shown, and the data are related to the diagnostic method used in conjunction with the type of biological sample. a higher proportion of positive CDVs occurred when using quantitative PCR assays (8%, 95% CI: 0\u201323) the common viral pathogens involved in CDV coinfection were canine parvovirus (35%, 95% CI: 21\u201349), canine adenovirus (4%, 95% CI: 1\u201310) and canine coronavirus (24%, 95% CI: 1\u201334) in the analysis of the positivity rate of CDV over time, the included studies ranged from 1998 to 2018. low heterogeneity was found only in the subgroup of clinical signs (vomit, diarrhea and dermatological signs; I2 = 0.0) low heterogeneity was found only in the subgroup of clinical signs. CD is the most relevant disease after rabies due to its considerable dissemination and severity potential. half of the CDV infections are subclinical or so mild that they do not require veterinary care. but mild disease may develop into severe disease in dogs. neurological signs may be progressive, and sequelae tends to generate an expectation of poor prognosis. some studies have verified that urine is a good biological sample for the detection of CDV RNA [36\u201338], and results continued to show its excellent application for laboratory diagnostic purposes. the authors used RT-PCR, which is less sensitive than nested PCR, but the results continued to show its excellent application for laboratory diagnostic purposes. s varying from 93 to 100% and from 83 to 100% for sensitivity and specificity respectively. the positive rate of 38% (95% CI: 26\u201350) was lower to the global average. the laboratory accuracy is susceptible to variation, including the sample collection during the clinical manifestations of acute CDV infection. the positive association observed was probably related to the fact that with the passage of time, the probability of exposure to the viral agent in the environment increases. the free-ranging lifestyle of dogs likely means that they are not vaccinated and are constantly exposed to canine populations, which may justify the higher positivity of CDV. the diversity of animals susceptible to CDV is broad as shown in a systematic review by Martinez-Gutierrez [94] who did not include domestic dogs in their analysis. the median seropositivity of CDV was 35.6%, 34.1% and 41.1% for Canidae, Felidae and Mustelidae, respectively. the frequency rate of CDV positivity among molecular surveys was 33% (95% CI: 23\u201343) among serological surveys, the rate was 46% (95% CI: 36\u201357), with considerable regional epidemiological variations in clinical signal parameters, biological samples, detection methods and animal lifestyle.
