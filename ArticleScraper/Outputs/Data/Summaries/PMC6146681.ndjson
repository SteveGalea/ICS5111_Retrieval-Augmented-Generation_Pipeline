{"summary": "feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline foamy virus (FFV), feline gammaherpesvirus 1 (FcaGHV-1) and feline coronavirus (FeCoV) have been the topics of many studies of feline viral pathogenesis and disease. however, few studies have systematically examined the impacts of these infections on disease outcomes or interactions between these infections and the endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) genotype. studies have indicated that FeLV-B primarily arises through de novo recombination in domestic cats infected with FeLV-A. it is thought to require FeLV-A as a helper virus for transmission (17\u201320) FFV and FcaGHV-1 are common chronic infections of domestic cats that to date are considered to represent apathogenic infections. enFeLV copy number, enFeLV subtype and viral load, and coinfections with FFV, FcaGHV-1, and FCoV to establish impacts of enFeLV and chronic viral coinfections. RESULTS Sixty-five cats were enrolled in this analysis. twenty-two (68%) of FeLV ELISA SNAP-positive cats were positive for enFeLV by qPCR. the median enFeLV copy number was estimated to be 34.5 copies per cell (range, 19.5 to 57.7 copies per cell) RNA was extracted from plasma to test for FeLV viremia and FCoV. all other tests utilized DNA extracted from PBMCs or whole blood. a high proportion of cats were FeLV progressors. Diagnosis of 49% of cats in the colony as FeLV progressors with high mean proviral loads and plasma viremia Group classification No. of cats/total % of cats SNAP ELISA result Provirus status Median proviral load (copies/ml of plasma) Range proviral load (copies/ml of plasma) Progressive 32/65 49 Positive Positive 5 106 5 105\u20135 107 Positive 4 108 1 103\u20133 109 Latent FeLV proviral load strongly correlated with plasma viremia as determined by Spearman correlation. FeLV status, proviral load and viremia, FeLV-B status, and FFV were positively associated (Table 3). enFeLV viremia and FeLV-B status were higher in male cats. enFeLV copy numbers were lower in cats with progressive FeLV infections (P = 0.02). male cats had significantly higher enFeLV copy numbers than female cats. cats had higher mean FeLV proviral loads (ANOVA, P = 0.116) and higher FeLV viremia (ANOVA, P = 0.09). enFeLV copy number, FeLV viral loads, and sex were supported by SEM. there were 32 cats in the progressive group, the latent group had 2 cats, the regressive group had 9 cats, and the regressive/uninfected group had 22 cats. ns, not significant (a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant) FeLV-B-positive cats had higher FeLV proviral loads (Spearman correlation, P 0.001) and higher FeLV plasma viremia loads (Spearman correlation, P 0.001) female cats were more likely to be FeLV-B positive (ANOVA, P = 0.05) female cats were more likely to be FeLV-B positive (ANOVA, P = 0.05) blood samples from one time point were obtained from 65 cats that originated from leopard cat/domestic cat hybrid matings. animals ranged in age from 8 weeks to 9 years, with 30 males (8 neutered and 22 intact), 32 females (3 spayed, 27 intact, and 2 pregnant), and 3 animals of unidentified sex. FFV provirus qPCR positive, and the median copy number of FFV was 3.3 103 copies per million cells. only 1 cat (1%) had detectable FCoV by qPCR. eight cats (12%) were qPCR positive for FcaGHV-1. the minimum FeLV viral load to result in a positive ELISA SNAP test result was determined to be 1 103 copies per ml of plasma (Table 2). Nearly half of all cats were classified as progressively infected (49%), with high FeLV proviral and plasma viremia loads (Table 2). viremia load (copies/ml of plasma) Progressive 32/65 49 Positive 5 106 5 105\u20135 107 Positive 4 108 1 103\u20133 109 Latent 2/65 3 Negative Positive 4 103 3 103\u20134 103 Positive 6 102 1 102\u20131 103 Regressive 9/65 14 Negative Positive 3 102 2 102\u20136 102 Negative NA NA TABLE 3.

FeLV-A has been determined to use the thiamine transport protein (feTHTR1) as a cell entry receptor. FeLV-B uses inorganic phosphate transporters Pit1 and Pit2 as receptors. this difference in receptor specificity results in different cell tropisms for the two strains (67). further studies will determine what proportion of FeLV infection can be attributed to FeLV-A. two-thirds of cats in this colony were qPCR positive for FFV. FFV and FeLV coinfection was common (32%) this could indicate some facilitation of FFV load with infection. FCoV seroprevalence in this colony was approximately 30%. Previously reported prevalence ranges are from 14.6% in Japan to 70% in Austria (34). this colony had only one cat that had an active infection of FCoV as diagnosed by qPCR of blood cells. the association between enFeLV copy number, being male, and progressive FeLV infection in this breeding colony of cats represents an interesting observation about the interaction between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. the average enFeLV copy number per cell as measured by qPCR in this colony was higher than reported in previous studies. male cats had higher enFeLV proviral loads than female cats. FeLV viremia loads tended to be lower in male cats. this colony originated as a hybrid between leopard cats (Felis bengalensis) and domestic cats. study recapitulated four infection outcomes for FeLV infections. progressive cats are classified by high plasma viremia loads and high proviral loads. latently infected cats have limited viral replication. analysis of anti-FeLV antibodies would be useful adjunct to future studies. inverse relationship between enFeLV copy number and FeLV proviral load in cats with progressive infection. findings suggest a protective role of enFeLV. no significant differences were observed between cats with high and low enFeLV copy numbers or FeLV infection outcomes (regressive and progressive) (11) persistently antigenemic cats with high enFeLV copy numbers were found to have higher levels of FeLV provirus, FeLV p27 antigen, and FeLV plasma viral RNA during early time points. endogenous production of a defective Gag antigen was shown to interfere with late stages of the viral replication cycle. thus, endogenous retroviruses could have multiple points of interference against a related exogenous retrovirus, resulting in truncation of exogenous viral replication. evidence has been found to suggest that endogenous retroviruses may enhance exogenous retroviral infection. FeLV-B uses inorganic phosphate transporters Pit1 and Pit2 as receptors. this difference in receptor specificity results in different cell tropisms. further studies will determine what proportion of FeLV infection can be attributed to FeLV-A in light of FeLV-B coinfection. fcaGHV-1 has been recently discovered as a worldwide infection of domestic cats that has not been associated with a specific disease association. despite close proximity of members of this colony, all but one of the FcaGHV-1-positive cats are qPCR negative (27), suggesting the actual incidence in this colony may be higher than 12%. previously reported prevalence ranges are from 14.6% in Japan to 70% in Austria (34). however, this colony had only one cat that had an active infection of FCoV as diagnosed by qPCR of blood cells. however, testing for FCoV in feces was not conducted in this study. enFeLV copy number, being male, and progressive FeLV infection in this colony of cats represents an interesting observation about the interaction between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. additional studies of disease dynamics and relationship to genotype and demographic characteristics will provide useful insights into mechanisms underlying progressive FeLV disease. cleic acid samples were stored at 80\u00b0C. commercially available ELISA SNAP tests were used to determine FeLV and FIV status using plasma and serum samples. real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify enFeLV copy numbers. this assay detected both solo LTRs and full-length enFeLV.
