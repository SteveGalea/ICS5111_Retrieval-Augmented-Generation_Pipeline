{"summary": "antagonism of the chemokine receptor CXCR7 blocks endothelial cell sequestration of CXCL12, thereby enhancing the abluminal localization of CXCL12. mice receiving high doses of CXCR7 antagonist recovered to baseline function, as assessed by standard clinical scoring. rolateral white matter (VLWM) axial diffusivities of nave and CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice were indistinguishable, while vehicle-treated animals showed decreased axial diffusivities. quantitative assessment of persistent inflammatory infiltrates revealed significant decreases within the parenchyma of CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice versus controls. questers the chemokine intracellularly [9-11] is critical for the entry of infiltrating leukocytes in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for MS [13,14] Loss of abluminal CXCL12 occurs via cytokine-mediated, up-regulation of CXCR7 by CNS endothelial cells [15], preventing pathological entry of immune cells into the CNS parenchyma DTI is suitable for quantitative assessment of myelin versus axonal injury in preclinical studies evaluating novel targets for the treatment of MS. axial diffusivity within the ventrolateral white matter (VLWM) of mice treated with high doses of CXCR7 antagonist was comparable to nave mice. mice were immunized with 50 g msMOGp35-55 (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and 50 g Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra peptide emulsified in Freund's adjuvant. polarized Th1 cells were harvested from spleen using a nylon wool column. cells were restimulated with 5 107 stimulators-cells for other 7 days. Th1 cells underwent a third stimulation of only 4 days in the presence of MOG and IL-2. mice were placed in a custom holder designed to immobilize the spine and isolate respiratory motion. an active detuned radiofrequency transmit coil was used with a receiver coil (16 mm internal diameter 10 cm length) designed to fit around the spine of the mouse. three DTI parameter maps were used, relative anisotropy (RA), axial diffusivity (||) and radial diffusivity () [27]. injured VLWM region was identified using the baseline axial diffusivity threshold derived from the spinal cord of nave mice. sections were permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum. primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 minutes at room temperature. segments L2/L3 were permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum for 60 minutes at room temperature. slides were washed in PBS followed by incubation of secondary antibodies for 60 minutes at room temperature. mice were immunized with 50 g msMOGp35-55 (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and 50 g Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra peptide emulsified in Freund's adjuvant. 5 106 Th1 cells were incubated with 25 106 stimulators-cells from nave splenocytes. 1 107 Th1 cells were restimulated with 5 107 stimulators-cells for other 7 days.

One-way ANOVA for effector phase. RA maps were generated within the manually defined regions of interest (ROIs) of VLWM. axon and myelin injury in VLWM, most severe in the control groups, was apparent in EAE mice as evidenced by the intensity changes in radial and axial diffusivity maps. radial () and axial (||) diffusivities showed heterogeneous abnormalities within the VLWM, being more severe in saline- and vehicle-treated groups. analysis of axial diffusivity shows a similarity between 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice with nave. no differences in the extent of injured VLWM were detected between 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated and nave mice. 5 mg/kg CCX771-, vehicle-, and saline-treated mice exhibited gradations of injury within the VLWM. linear correlation between temporal-cumulative clinical score and injured VLWM at the time of DTI evaluation was significant. this data strongly support a role for CXCR7 as a disease-modifying molecule during recovery phase of EAE via axonal preservation. mice treated with 10 mg/kg CCX771 showed myelin-density staining that was comparable to nave animals. persistent inflammation was still detectable within the VLWM spinal cords of saline- and vehicle-treated mice. however, these features were absent in the nave and 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice. axonal bundles in different stages of degeneration were observable to a lesser extent in 5 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice. immunofluorescent detection of MBP (green) and GST- (red) showed similar levels of myelin content and presence of oligodendrocytes in all treatment groups. all treatment groups showed meningeal CD3+ cells compared with mice treated with 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg CCX771. parenchymal infiltration of CD3+ cells increased in vehicle- and saline-treated mice compared with mice treated with CCX771. immunofluorescence analysis of infiltrated CD3+ T-cells using GFAP (red) antibody to delineate CNS parenchyma within spinal cords of mice evaluated by DTI (A) these CD3+ T-cells were mostly restricted to meningeal spaces and within GFAP+ parenchyma. ns = non-significant, * = p 0.05, ** p 0.01, *** p 0.001, F = 10.56, R2 = 0.4599. spinal cords sections encompassing L2/3, which were used for LFB staining, were examined for the extent of neurofilament H (NF-H) dephosphorylation via anti-SMI-32 immunofluorescence. injured VLWM shows abnormal dephosphorylation of neurofilament H. higher SMI-32 staining within VLWM was observed in saline- and vehicle-treated mice. CCX771-treated mice were more comparable to nave controls. half of CCX771-treated mice began administration of CCX771 when they attained a clinical score of 1. CCX771-treated mice exhibited a dose-dependent increase in recovery. CCX771-treated mice exhibited a dose-dependent increase in recovery. two-way ANOVA interaction: interaction: F = 1.71, P = 0.1659; disease phase: F = 164.57, P 0.0001; treatment: F = 22.21, P 0.0001; treatment: F = 18.45, P 0.0004; Table 2: One-way ANOVA recovery phase: F = 18.45, P 0.0001. results are expressed as mean highest severity score SEM. saline vehicle 5 mg vehicle to 10 mg 10 mg saline -- ns *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** axial diffusivity of 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice resembled the values of the nave group, while 5 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice resembled those obtained from control groups. RA of VLWM showed no difference between vehicle- or saline-treated mice and CCX771-treated mice. radial () and axial (||) diffusivities showed heterogeneous abnormalities within the VLWM, being more severe in saline- and vehicle-treated groups. analysis of axial diffusivity shows a similarity between 10 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice with nave. axial diffusivity threshold segmentation on nave spinal cord reveals similarities of CCX771-treated mice with nave. red line represents threshold of injured white matter from nave spinal cords used as control. CXCR7 antagonism does not alter myelin levels during recovery from EAE. mice treated with 10 mg/kg CCX771 exhibited myelin-density staining that was comparable to nave animals. persistent inflammation was still detectable within the VLWM spinal cords of saline- and vehicle-treated mice and, to some extent, of mice treated with 5 mg/kg CCX771. pathological features consistent with hypertrophic and degenerating axonal bundles, as reported in human and rodent models of CNS degeneration and trauma. immunofluorescent detection of MBP (green) and GST- (red) showed similar levels of myelin content. DAPI nuclear staining is more evident in the 5 mg/kg CCX771-, vehicle- and saline-treated mice. DAPI nuclear staining is more evident in the 5 mg/kg CCX771-, vehicle- and saline-treated mice. meningeal and parenchymal CD3+ staining in both the parenchyma and meninges of mice in each treatment group revealed significant differences between the two CNS regions in mice treated with low dose CCX771 (5 mg/kg) and in vehicle- or saline-treated controls. CCX771-treated mice showed a higher infiltration of CD3+ lymphocytes within GFAP+ parenchyma. to-Pro-3 nuclear staining (blue) is more evident in the 5 mg/kg mice. spinal cords sections encompassing L2/3, which were the same segments used for LFB staining, were examined for the extent of neurofilament H (NF-H) dephosphorylation via anti-SMI-32 immunofluorescence. a similar pattern was observed in the 5 mg/kg CCX771-treated mice and in nave animals. injured VLWM shows abnormal dephosphorylation of neurofilament H. higher SMI-32 staining within VLWM was observed in saline- and vehicle-treated mice. CCX771-treated mice were more comparable to control mice. a linear correlation between injured VLWM and mean maximum disease severity scores was observed only during recovery phase. we observed significant increases in persistent inflammatory infiltrates within the parenchyma of saline- and vehicle-treated mice that was abrogated with CCX771 administration. axonal damage and not lack of myelin is the key pathology in mice with chronic deficits. vehicle-treated mice with ongoing disease could attain complete recovery upon initiation of CXCR7 antagonist. this suggests peak disease contains a reversible component. this reversibility may be attributed to axonal damage. studies examining CXCR7 antagonism in this context may be more conducive for the evaluation of OPCs recruitment and maturation. as CXCR7 antagonism was previously shown to limit demyelination during peak EAE [12], it is possible that the preserved axonal integrity is due to preservation of myelin. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors will like to acknowledge Dr. John H.
