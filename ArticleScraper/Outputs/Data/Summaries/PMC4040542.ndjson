{"summary": "a rabbit antiserum raised against the epitope on the C terminus of the polypeptide it encoded. the frameshift product was immunopurified from infected cells and an ORF1a expression system. a stop codon is present in the 1 frame immediately downstream of the RG_GUU_UUU slippery sequence (Fig. 1A) recombinant virus replicated to much higher titers (106.2 FFU/mL) and the nsp2N product (nsp2N*) could be immunopurified from infected MARC-145 cells. a gel slice containing the nsp2N* band was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) PRRSV nsp1 is required for Efficient 1 and 2 Frameshifting in the nsp2-Coding region. previously we demonstrated that translation of the complete PRRSV ORF1a sequence is sufficient to allow efficient 2 PRF (13). to define the minimal sequence requirements for 2/1 PRF in PRRSV isolate SD01-08, we focused our attention on the N-terminal half of ORF1a. PRRSV nsp1 transactivates 2/1 PRF at the RG_GUU_UUU slippery sequence in the nsp2-coding region. arrow indicates the PRF site and untranslated parts of the 2 and 1 reading frames are hatched. nsp2-3-IFC (13) is an engineered IFC construct that expresses nsp2TF only. mAb -EU-nsp2 recognizes the common N-terminal domain of nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N. -EU-TF recognizes the C-terminal domain of nsp2TF. expression products were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies indicated below each panel. a drastically altered version of the nsp1-2 expression vector was produced in which almost every codon of the nsp1-coding sequence was mutated synonymously. pLnsp1cc-2 construct expresses an unaltered nsp1 protein, but the nucleotide sequence encoding it is changed to such an extent that we would expect to disrupt any primary sequence or RNA secondary structure elements. the native stop codon in the 1 frame was retained and 1 PRF would yield a polypeptide slightly shorter than the product resulting from translation termination in the zero reading frame. a previously described PRF knockout construct containing point mutations within the slippery sequence and downstream C-rich region was also included in the analysis. a series of 3\u2032 truncations was engineered in pDluc. the number below each lane represents the remaining PRRSV-specific RNA sequence downstream of the slippery sequence. the number below each lane represents the remaining PRRSV-specific RNA sequence downstream of the slippery sequence. of 2 PRF (5%) were observed in cells transfected with pDluc-KO2. 79-nt PRRSV sequence included in pDluc-WT contains all cis-acting sequences required for efficient 2/1 PRF. in-frame deletions were introduced into pDluc-WT to further investigate key RNA sequences required for PRF. the nsp1-nsp1 region has previously been implicated in a variety of processes in the arterivirus replicative cycle. an analysis of nsp1 sequence conservation pointed toward a previously identified conserved sequence motif as a potential RNA interaction domain. this sequence, GKYLQRRLQ in both type 1 and type 2 PRRSV, forms one of three -helices. based on the published crystal structure from type 2 PRRSV isolate XH-GD (39) are shown above the alignment and are color matched to the nsp1 structure in B. residues mutated in mutant 1KO are boxed in orange. helix 4 of PLP1 is colored orange with basic residues represented as sticks. both patches reside on the same side of the structure, potentially allowing for RNA to bind across the entire dimer surface. the GKYLQRRLQ motif was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. the 1KO mutant carried a double Ala substitution of basic residues in the highly conserved GKYLQRRLQ motif of nsp1. expression products were immunoprecipitated with mAbs recognizing the common nsp2 domain of the nsp2-related products. nsp2N was detected in SD95-21-WT-infected cells. only nsp2 was recovered from cells infected with either SD95-21-KO2 or SD95-21-1KO. nsp1 was expressed at a level similar to that observed with the virus. polypeptide encoded by TF ORF (Upper Right), or nsp1 (Lower) was visualized using SDS/PAGE and autoradiography. the 1KO mutant of the PRRSV type 1 isolate yielded very low titers in MARC-145 cells. the total amount of nsp1 and viral RNA was somewhat reduced in 1KO-transfected cells. cleavage of the site between nsp1 and nsp2 and subgenomic mRNA production was not affected by the mutations in the GKYLQRRLQ motif. nsp1 transactivated 2/1 PRF on the WT PRF signal in the 1KO genome. AUCUCC motif was fused to the EGFP ORF. plasmids pR79KO2-EGFP and pR79CC2-EGFP were previously shown to inactivate PRF. qRT-PCR was used to determine the levels of nsp1 bait and RNA target in transfected cells. western blot analysis was used to monitor the input of 1KO or WT nsp1 bait (Middle) and to verify the use of equal amounts of cell lysate. a strong and specific RNA coimmunoprecipitation signal was detected only in samples from cells cotransfected with pFLAG-nsp1-WT and pR79WT-EGFP. only very low levels of target RNA were pulled down, suggesting that the K130A/R134A mutations impaired the interaction of nsp1 with PRRSV RNA. 5-bromo-U\u2013labeled RNA transcripts were produced in vitro and incubated with lysates of 293T cells transfected with the plasmid expressing 1KO or WT nsp1. only trace amounts of WT nsp1 were pulled down when the RNA was used as bait. RNA\u2013protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-BrU antibody. the amount of -tubulin in the initial samples was monitored to verify equal loading. alternative 2 and 1 PRF at the same PRRSV Slippery Sequence. in a full-length cDNA clone of the previously used PRRSV isolate SD01-08 (a type 1 virus) (30), the 1 frame stop codon (UGA) was replaced by a tryptophan codon (UGG), extending the 1 frame by an additional 87 codons. however, this point mutation unavoidably also introduced amino acid substitutions in the overlapping 0 and 2 frames encoding nsp2 and nsp2TF a synthetic version of this peptide was subjected to the same LC-MS/MS analysis. the tandem mass spectrum of this synthetic peptide was found to be identical to that of the peptide derived from the nsp2N*-containing gel slice. this confirms that nsp2N is indeed translated via 1 PRF at the RG_GUU_UUU slippery sequence. constructs lacking the nsp1-coding region expressed nsp2 but only trace amounts of nsp2TF or nsp2N were detected. nsp1 is required for efficient 2/1 PRF at the RG_GUU_UUU slippery sequence in the nsp2-coding region. expression products were immunoprecipitated using antibodies indicated below each panel. mAb -EU-nsp2 recognizes the common N-terminal domain of nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N. mAb -EU-nsp2 recognizes the common N-terminal domain of nsp2TF. nsp2TF and nsp2N were expressed with equal efficiency in cells transfected with pLnsp1cc-2 and wild-type (WT) pLnsp1-2. nsp2TF and nsp2N were expressed with equal efficiency in cells transfected with pLnsp1cc-2. the ORF1a frame of the PRRSV insert was placed in-frame with the upstream (Renilla) luciferase gene. the downstream (firefly) luciferase was in the 2 frame and therefore its expression depended on the occurrence of 2 frameshifting. 1 PRF could be monitored because the native stop codon in the 1 frame was retained. mutant KO2 (Fig. S1) (13) contains point mutations within both slippery sequence and downstream C-rich motif. the 2 PRF efficiencies were calculated by comparing the ratio of enzymatic activities of firefly and Renilla luciferase. the 79-nt PRRSV sequence included in pDluc-WT contains all cis-acting sequences required for efficient 2/1 PRF. in the absence of the transactivator, only low levels of 2 PRF (5%) were observed. in the absence of the transactivator, only low levels of 2 PRF were observed. the nsp1-nsp1 region has previously been implicated in a variety of processes in the arterivirus replicative cycle. the nsp1-nsp1 region has previously been implicated in a variety of processes in the arterivirus replicative cycle. PRRSV sequences are numbered (black) from the nsp1/nsp1 cleavage site. all other sequences are numbered (gray) starting from the N terminus of the pp1a polyprotein. helix 4 of PLP1 is colored orange with basic residues represented as sticks. both patches reside on the same side of the structure, potentially allowing for RNA to bind across the entire dimer surface. mutant 1KO mutant was found to be seriously crippled. the recombinant vaccinia virus\u2013T7 RNA polymerase expression system and HEK-293T cells were used to express WT and 1KO mutant nsp1-nsp2 polyproteins from (A) type 1 and (B) type 2 PRRSV. the 1KO mutant carried a double Ala substitution of basic residues in the highly conserved GKYLQRRLQ motif of nsp1. expression of nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N was detected in SD95-21-WT-infected cells. only nsp2 was recovered from cells infected with either SD95-21-KO2 or SD95-21-1KO. expression of nsp1 was monitored by Western blot analysis. viral proteins were immunoprecipitated using specific mAbs that recognize a common nsp2 domain (Upper Left), the polypeptide encoded by the TF ORF (Upper Right), or nsp1 (Lower). the 1KO mutant of the PRRSV type 1 isolate (SD01-08) yielded very low titers in MARC-145 cells (102 FFU/mL) equal expression of nsp1 in WT-, KO2-, and 1KO-transfected cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with an nsp1-specific mAb. we also investigated whether the mutations in 1KO affected the activity of the PLP1 protease or the (potential) involvement of nsp1 in control of viral subgenomic mRNA synthesis. to produce an RNA target, we engineered plasmid pR79WT-EGFP yielding an RNA in which a 79-nt PRRSV SD01-08 RNA sequence was fused to the EGFP ORF. the latter served as a target for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) amplification of target RNA bound to nsp1. hek-293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing WT or 1KO FLAG-tagged nsp1 and a plasmid expressing a WT or mutant target RNA. qRT-PCR was used to determine the levels of nsp1 bait and RNA target in transfected cells. we immunoprecipitated FLAG-nsp1 using an anti-FLAG mAb. a strong and specific RNA coimmunoprecipitation signal was detected only in samples from cells cotransfected with pFLAG-nsp1-WT and pR79WT-EGFP. only background signal was detected when using a negative control mouse IgG for immunoprecipitation. 5-bromo-U\u2013labeled RNA transcripts were produced in vitro and incubated with lysates of 293T cells transfected with the plasmid expressing 1KO or WT nsp1. a strong and specific nsp1 signal was detected only when the R79WT bait was incubated with cell lysates containing nsp1-WT. only trace amounts of WT nsp1 were pulled down p1-expressing HEK-293T cells were incubated with in vitro produced BrU-labeled RNA transcripts containing WT or mutant (KO2 or CC2) versions of a 79-nt sequence from the 2/1 PRF region of type 1 PRRSV. RNA\u2013protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-BrU antibody and subjected to Western blot analysis using an nsp1-specific mAb the region 3\u2032 of the PRRSV PRF slippery sequence acts to recruit nsp1 or an nsp1-containing protein complex. this modulates ribosome function to promote frameshifting. nsp1 binds directly to the C-rich region because point mutations within this region strongly reduce RNA binding. protein immediately adjacent to rpS3 of the ribosomal helicase (52) and PCBP1 is known to interact with RACK1. nsp1 in modulating the ribosomal helicase, the suspected target for the stimulatory RNA sequences of canonical 1 PRF signals. the length of the spacer between slippery sequence and secondary structure affected the relative utilization of 1 or 2 PRF modes. the length of the PRRSV region 3\u2032 of the slippery sequence was shortened from 67 to 45 nt. this may hint at the involvement of additional factors. nucleoproteins of many RNA viruses encapsidate the viral genome using domains of -helical structure. it is plausible that the GKYLQRRLQ motif of helix 4 directly binds viral RNA. this helix may be a binding site for a cellular protein that in turn could bind to the PRF signal in the viral RNA. the nsp2-encoding region of the PLP1 domain lacks an equivalent of the (overlapping) TF ORF and produces a substantially smaller nsp2. loss of the requirement to transactivate PRF may also explain a second remarkable difference between the nsp1 region of EAV. nsp1 may also modulate translation of host cell mRNAs containing appropriate signals. a cursory search of porcine mRNAs revealed hundreds of 1 and/or 2 frameshift-compatible shift sites. no site that is exactly identical to the PRRSV minimal PRF cassette (8-nt shift site plus downstream 21 nt) mutagenesis of key residues in nsp1 and the PRF site could attenuate virus growth and improve host innate immune responses. mutagenesis of key residues in nsp1 and the PRF site is fundamental for the development of modified live virus vaccines. a rabbit antiserum (-NA-TF) recognizing the C-terminal epitope (CFLKVGVKSAGDLV) of nsp2TF of type 2 PRRSV was generated by GenScript. an anti-FLAG mAb was obtained from Sigma Life Science. different regions of PRRSV ORF1a were transiently expressed in RK-13 or HEK-293T cells using truncated derivatives of expression plasmid pL1a and the recombinant vaccinia virus\u2013T7 polymerase expression system. expression products were 35S labeled, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (13, 31) analysis of protein sequences and structure was performed using the MUSCLE algorithm in Geneious 6. potential RNA-binding residues in nsp1 were identified using the program BindN (68) mAb 58-46 (-EU-nsp2), mAb 58-46 (-EU-nsp2), mAb 140-68 (-NA-PLP2), mAb 148-43 (-NA-nsp2), and a rabbit antiserum recognizing the C-terminal part of nsp2TF (-EU-TF) were produced as described previously (13) nsp2N* was excised by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis. different regions of PRRSV ORF1a were transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells using truncated derivatives of expression plasmid pL1a and the recombinant vaccinia virus\u2013T7 polymerase expression system. measured using the Dual Luciferase Stop & Glo Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a luminometer (Berthold) frameshifting efficiencies were calculated from the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities."}
