{"summary": "we orally inoculated immunodeficient mice with 5 107 PFU of neutral-red-labeled WT CVB3. it is difficult to quantify viral replication in the intestine in the first few days after oral inoculation. we examined viral replication by using light-sensitive, neutral-red-labeled virus. the large-plaque variant existed at a low level in the inoculum. four- to 6-week-old male IFNAR/ mice were orally inoculated with 5 107 PFU of light-sensitive, neutral-red-labeled WT CVB3 in the dark. fecal samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hpi in the dark. FNAR+/+ mice were orally, intraperitoneally (i.p.), or intramuscularly (i.m.) inoculated with 5 107, 5 107, or 2 106 PFU of CVB3 respectively. livers, hearts, and spleens were harvested from i.p. inoculated mice at 48 hpi. we measured the virus plaque sizes and quantified the percentage of large plaques in different tissues. i.p. or i.m. with 5 107 PFU of WT CVB3. samples were collected from orally inoculated mice at 72 hpi. liver, heart, and spleen samples were harvested from i.p. inoculated mice at 48 hpi. VP3 N63Y is sufficient for the large-plaque phenotype. RT-PCR products from several large plaques were sequenced and found to contain the VP3 N63Y mutation. the N63Y mutant was cloned into a new infectious clone. viral titers were determined over time. both WT and N63Y mutant CVB3 replicated better in human cell lines. these cell lines have different levels of CVB3 receptor expression. 35S-labeled WT or N63Y mutant CVB3 was incubated with heparin-agarose resin or streptavidin-agarose resin (control). Resin was washed, and bound 35S-labeled CVB3 was quantified. n = 3. *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. heparinase treatment reduced the attachment of WT CVB3 to cells. 35S-labeled CVB3 was incubated with heparin-agarose resin or control streptavidin-agarose resin at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. sulfated glycans in agar can inhibit plaque formation. N63Y mutant CVB3 has increased replication and pathogenesis in mice. we hypothesized that plaque formation would not be inhibited by sulfated glycans in agar overlays. agarose contains low levels of sulfated glycans. we orally inoculated IFNAR+/+ or IFNAR/ mice at 72 hpi. N63Y mutant CVB3 titers were significantly higher than WT CVB3 titers in leg muscle. these results indicate that N63Y mutant CVB3 has enhanced replication and systemic dissemination in orally inoculated mice. mice were inoculated orally with 5 107 PFU, i.p. inoculated with 1 104 PFU of WT (solid line) or N63Y mutant (dashed line) CVB3. we monitored the survival of mice following infection via different inoculation routes. we found that IFNAR+/+ mice did not succumb to CVB3 infection. we orally inoculated IFNAR/ mice with 5 107 PFU of WT or N63Y mutant CVB3. hepatic cell necrosis with extensive polymorphonuclear cell infiltration at 72 hpi in N63Y mutant CVB3-infected mice. hepatic cell necrosis with extensive polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. IFNAR/ mice were orally infected with 5 107 PFU of WT or N63Y mutant CVB3. blood was harvested at 24 and 72 hpi, and ALT levels were quantified by ELISA. we hypothesized that N63Y mutant CVB3 may have increased homing to the liver. on average, half of the injected N63Y mutant CVB3 was found in the liver. the elevated amount of N63Y mutant CVB3 found in the liver could be due to increased binding to liver tissue and/or increased dissemination to the liver. fecal viruses were input/inoculum virus or virus that had undergone replication. the percentage of replicated virus was calculated by dividing the light-exposed number of PFU/ml by the non-light-exposed number of PFU/ml. the specific activity of 35S-labeled CVB3 stocks was approximately 1,000 PFU/cpm. PCR products were sequenced by the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Sequencing Core. all six isolates contained two amino acid changes, VP3 N63Y and VP2 T151S. the fragment was cloned into a new plasmid from nucleotide 1695 to nucleotide 2072. 35S-labeled CVB3 was incubated with 8.8 106 HeLa, Huh7, RD, CHO, or L929 cells at 4\u00b0C for 40 min to facilitate viral binding. cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized, and 35S was quantified in scintillation counter. mice were inoculated with 5 107 PFU of neutral-red-labeled, light-sensitive CVB3 and fe. mice were orally inoculated with 5 107 PFU of neutral-red-labeled, light-sensitive CVB3 and fe. mice were orally inoculated with 5 107 PFU of CVB3 or inoculated i.p. or i.m. with 2 106 PFU of WT CVB3. tissues (muscle, liver, heart, and/or spleen) were harvested at 48 hpi. fecal samples were collected from orally inoculated mice at 72 hpi. feces and tissue samples were processed prior to viral titer assay or scintillation counting. new tissues were homogenized with a Bullet Blender homogenizer (55) prior to incubation with 3 106 PFU/3,000 cpm of 35S-labeled WT or N63Y mutant CVB3. the differences between groups were examined by unpaired two-tailed Student t tests. 35S-labeled WT or N63Y mutant CVB3 was incubated with nitrocellulose membranes containing immobilized hCAR or mCAR protein. the bound viral counts per minute were determined to quantify binding."}
