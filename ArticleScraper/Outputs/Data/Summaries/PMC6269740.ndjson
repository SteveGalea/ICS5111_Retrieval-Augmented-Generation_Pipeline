{"summary": "coxsackievirus B4 belongs to the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. it is one of six serotypes of the coxsackievirus B group. CVB4 can cause a broad range of diseases, such as myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, gastroenteritis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumonia and even death in neon hydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone is an active component in the root and rhizome of polygonum cuspidatum. it is an active component in the root and rhizome of polygonum cuspidatum. emodin could inhibit the entry and replication of CVB4 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. it could also inhibit apoptosis induced by CVB4 infection. the separation of emodin was carried out on an Acclaim 120-C18 column (4.6 mm 250 mm, 5 m) with a mobile phase of methanol-water-0.1 phosphoric acid under 30 \u00b0C. the flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength was 289 nm. selectivity index MTT MTT PRA MTT PRA Emodin 61.35 4.40 14.10 0.74 12.06 1.85 4.35 0.6 5.09 0.3 Ribavirin 2645.14 54.05 629.99 1.64 460.91 1.23 4.20 0.7 5.74 0.1 Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT and PRA. there was no significant difference between emodin-treated group and ribavirin-treated group. the maximum inhibitory rate could be observed when emodin was added at 0\u20134 h postinfection. copies in the 37, 18.5, 9.0 M emodin group expressed 0.77, 0.55 and 0.40-fold lower than the virus control group (p 0.01) a result that corroborates the dose dependent inhibitory effect of emodin against CVB4 infection.
