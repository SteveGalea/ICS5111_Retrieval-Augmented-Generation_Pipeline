{"summary": "the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has killed more than 18,000 people around the world since 2009 [2] there has been a worldwide effort to virus isolation, whole genome sequencing, and hemagglutination inhibition assay to confirm influenza A viruses. genome analysis indicates that it is closely related to common reassortant swine influenza A viruses isolated in North America, Europe, and Asia [3] TS possesses antiangiogenic activity through suppressing VEGF-induced expression of metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 9 and MMP-2 on endothelial cells [15]. traditional Chinese medicine may be a great treasure for finding new antiviral agents against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. TSL-1 may inhibit influenza virus infection and potentially be a promising treatment to protect the host against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. aqueous extract of TS was prepared according to previous study. supernatants from infected cultures were collected 3 days after infection. aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. cytopathic effect (CPE) was expressed as TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) infected cells were harvested at 72 hours after-infection. plaque assays were performed in 6-well plates in triplicate. all PCR assays were performed using standard precaution to avoid contamination. each 20 L RT-PCR mixture contained 1x Universal PCR Master Mix, 1x MultiScribe, and RNAse Inhibitor. the cells were seeded and incubated for 24 hours and prechilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. the cells were then infected with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus of 3 105 PFU/mL and different indicated concentrations of TSL-1. the cells were then infected with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus of 3 105 PFU/mL and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 1 hour. a pig erythrocytes suspension was added into the 96-well microtitre plates. the plate was incubated for 3 hours at 4\u00b0C. the experiments were repeated three times independently. qRT-PCR primers and an appropriate probe were chosen by the UPL assay design center. qRT-PCR primers and an appropriate probe were chosen by the UPL assay design center. 49 cells and TSL-1 treatment infected A549 cells were used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. the quantization of target genes was determined by the relative quantitative comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method using the GAPDH as the endogenous control. agacagcagaaccaggcatca NM_002996.3: 219\u2013238 151 bp Reverse: gccgccatttcgagttag NM_002996.3: 4\u201343 62 bp Reverse: atggttcccggtggt NM_000584.2: 68\u201385 TLR3 Forward: aatcttccaattgcgtgaaattaaaa the membrane was incubated in PBS containing goat anti-mouse IgG. positive signals were developed with chemiluminescence reagent. the membrane was exposed to Fuji medical X-ray film (Fuji Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) -D-glucoside, quercetin, quercitrin, quercetin 3-O--D-glucoside, and rutin were identified from TS as previously described [13]. in the antiviral assay against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, they were dissolved in water and then diluted in cell culture medium. XTT reagent was added and incubated for 4 hours. each experiment was carried out in triplicate and performed at least thrice separately. the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of TSL-1 was calculated. confluent monolayer MDCK cells cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate were infected with the supernatants. after 60 minutes for virus adsorption, the solution was removed and the cells were washed twice with prewarmed MEM medium. monolayer was fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 60 minutes. each 20 L RT-PCR mixture contained 1x Universal PCR Master Mix, 1x MultiScribe, and RNAse Inhibitor. reactions were performed and analyzed in a 7500 sequence Detection System (PRISM, Applied Biosystems, USA) 1N1) virus of 3 105 PFU/mL was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours. the cells were treated with PBS (pH 11) for 1 minute to inactivate unpenetrating viruses. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for another 3 hours. ELISA for RANTES Monolayer of A549 cells at a concentration of 3 105 cells/mL was infected with the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. after 1 hour, the solution was removed; cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and supplemented with growth media contained TSL-1 at different concentrations. 1/10 volume of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0), one volume of phenol, and 1/5 volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol were added to the homogenate. the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. gene name Sequence (5\u2032-3\u2032) Accession no./nucleotide position Amplicon size VCAM-1 Forward: catgacctgttccagcgagg NM_080682.2: 950\u2013969 247 bp Reverse: agctccaccaccactc NM_080682.2: 1178\u20131197 ICAM-1 Forward: agcgtagggtaaggtcttgc J0313 accagcataggtgtgattgt NM_001114735: 613\u2013634 5\u2032-End labeled with fluorescein (FAM) and the 3\u2032-end labeled with a dark quencher dye. the membrane was incubated in PBS containing goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hour. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat statistical software (version 2.0, Jandel Scientific, CA, USA) results were represented as means standard deviation (SD) values were considered to be significant at P less than 0.05. the inhibitory effect of viral yields on plaque formation was demonstrated without dose-dependent manner. at the concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 g/mL, they displayed similar inhibitory effect in viral yields on plaque formation. the ratio of CC50 : EC50 was at least more than 15. it indicated that TSL-1 had strong inhibitory effect of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus without cytotoxic effect in MDCK cells. TSL-1 inhibited pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus activity by inhibiting attachment of A549 cells but not viral penetration. TSL-1 could inhibit viral penetration into A549 cells even up to 100 g/mL treatment of TSL-1. inhibitory effects of sialic acid activity and RANTES by TSL-1 and amantadine on pandemic influenza A (H1N1) viruses. RANTES expression was suppressed in both TSL-1 and Amantadine treatments of viral infected A549 cells. mRNAs of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, fractalkine (CX3CL1), IL-8, TLR3 and Bcl2-A1 were activated by H1N1 viral infection. mRNA levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, fractalkine (CX3CL1), IL-8, TLR3 and Bcl2-A1 were suppressed by TSL-1 treatment. TSL-1 was more efficient to reduce mRNA level of Bcl2-A1 with H1N1 vial activation compared to Amantadine. this indicated that TSL-1 could have different mechanisms or pathways to prevent H1N1 viral infection. results show an inhibitory effect in expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E selectin, IL-8, and fractalkine of the H1N1-stimulated A549 cells. TSL-1 was more effective than Amantadine to inhibit adhesion molecules and chemokines in A549 cells with H1N1 viral activation. the water extract of TSL-1 did not show cytotoxicity against A549 and MDCK cells at concentrations up to 100 g/mL. the estimated CC50 of TSL-1 extracts was higher than 300 g/mL. there was no sign of apoptosis or necrosis. TSL-1 decreased approximately 50% of the plaque formation of the viral yield. the mean 50% inhibitory concentration (EC50) of TSL-1 is 20.4 0.5 g/mL. qRT-PCR results showed significant inhibition of viral RNA synthesis in infected A549 cells at concentrations greater than 10 g/mL of TSL-1 treatment. qRT-PCR results showed significant inhibition of viral RNA synthesis in infected A549 cells. -1 could not exert the effect of inhibiting viral penetration into A549 cells even up to 100 g/mL treatment of TSL-1. our results showed that TSL-1 possessed inhibitory activities towards NA through attachment or penetration process. we investigated if TSL-1 could interfere with the viral adsorption to RBC resulting in HA inhibition. SEM calculated from three independent experiments in triplicate. inhibitory effect of sialic acid activity and RANTES by TSL-1 and Amantadine on pandemic influenza A virus. mRNAs of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, fractalkine (CX3CL1), IL-8, TLR3 and Bcl2-A1 were activated by H1N1 viral infection. mRNA levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, fractalkine (CX3CL1), IL-8, TLR3 and Bcl2-A1 were suppressed by TSL-1 treatment. effect of TSL-1 on mRNA expressions of a) VCAM-1, ICAM-1, fractalkine, E-selectin, IL-8, and TLR-3 in pandemic influenza A/H1N1-infected A549 cells. mRNA expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR with GAPDH normalization. TSL-1 was more effective than Amantadine to inhibit adhesion molecules and chemokines in A549 cells with H1N1 viral activation compared to the TSL-1. however, there is no specific inhibitory effect to the TLR3 and Bcl2-A1 expressions in the absence of H1N1 viral infection. crude extract of toona sinensis Roem leaf has been reported to exert antiproliferative action and growth inhibition on several cancer cell lines through apoptosis induction. recently, toona sinensis Roem extract was proven to abate hyperglycemia by altering adipose glucose transporter 4 [26] and improve lipolysis of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte [27] a flavonoid flavonoid exhibited the highest activity against two influenza viruses, H1N1 and H9N2 [32] rutin and quercetin exhibit a prooxidant effect in healthy animals and antioxidant activity in influenza-infected animals. we confirmed that TSL-1 blocked viral entry through attachment assay. TSL-1 may interact with viral proteins and alter the adsorption and penetration of the virion. the mechanisms of TSL-1 and Amantadine H1N1 inhibition are different. inflammatory leukocyte recruitment begins with the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, and a variety of chemokines like CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL3/4 (MIP-1), CXCL10 (IFN-inducible protein 10), and CXCL8 (IL-8) from infected alveolar macrophage and epithelial cells. IL-8 and lung injury score SL-1's antiviral mechanism is different to that of Amantadine, which modulates inflammation through TLR3 and Bcl2-A1. TSL-1 inhibited pandemic influenza A (H1N1) viral attachment."}
