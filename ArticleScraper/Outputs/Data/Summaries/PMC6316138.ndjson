TMPRSS2 is expressed in epithelial cells of the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. a compound known to inhibit cruzain can inhibit MERS-CoV replication. the addition of small amounts of ouabain (50 nM) or bufalin (10 to 15 nM) inhibited infection with MERS-CoV and VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) but only when the drug was added prior to inoculation in Huh-7 cells. a lipophilic compound showed a decimal reduction at 0.5 g/mL. MERS-PLpro is a part of the nonstructural protein nsp3, which includes three domains. it includes ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), a catalytic triad consisting of C1594\u2013H1761\u2013D1776, and the ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) at the zinc finger. disulfiram has been approved by the fda since 1951. subsite S1 consists of vital catalytic residue Cys145 with His41 to process polyproteins at 11 conserved Gln sites, followed by small amino acids like Ala, Ser, or Gly. glu166 at the entrance of the pocket interacts via H-bond with the N2 of the conserved Gln [50], which stabilizes the transition state during proteolysis. pharmacophores phenyl at R3 and carboxylate, either at R1 or R4, are essential for the antiviral activity. treatment with CE-5 inhibited the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to 30% of that of DMSO-treated cells at a maximum dose of 50 M [53] eIF4A inhibitor can inhibit the proteolytic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro by binding with the interface of domain I and II of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with an EC50 of about 0.3 M. other small-molecule Inhibitors with Defined or Undefined Mechanisms of Action Silvestrol can inhibit MERS-CoV infection with an EC50 of 1.3 nM.
