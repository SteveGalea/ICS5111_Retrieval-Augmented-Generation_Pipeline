{"summary": "secondary bacterial infections resulting from an influenza infection caused over half of the deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is the most common pathogen responsible for secondary bacterial infections during influenza pandemics. resistance to new antibiotics is emerging at an ever-increasing pace, and at the same time, the rate of development of new antibiotics has slowed substantially. the increasing incidence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae has complicated the treatment and management of various pneumococcal disease manifestations. secondary bacterial infections following primary influenza compromise pulmonary integrity. associated secondary bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of death (1). the most prevalent serotype encountered in the Asian population is 19F. BALB/c mice were infected with a sublethal dose of the PR8 virus. either serotype 3 of S. pneumoniae (Flu+S3), serotype 19F of S. pneumoniae (Flu+19F), or sterile PBS (Flu) at 7 dpi. n = 3 independent experiments with 5 mice per time point for each experimental group. secondary bacterial infection resulted in significantly greater edema than primary influenza infection. lungs of mice infected with flu+S3 showed a significant 2.0-fold increase in lung lobe volume compared with sham-infected lungs. flu+19F, influenza infection followed by infection with S. pneumoniae serotype 19F. n = 5 mice per time point for each experimental group. secondary pneumococcal infection following primary influenza infection significantly increased the severity of lung edema and pulmonary tissue damage in a serotype-specific manner. quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that ANGPTL4 mRNA levels peaked at 9 dpi in lungs infected with flu (9-fold), 19F (4-fold), S3 (2-fold), Flu+19F (7-fold) and Flu+S3 (10-fold) compared to healthy lungs data are represented as the mean standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. data are represented as the mean SD from at least three independent experiments. Deficiency in host cANGPTL4 reduces pulmonary edema. ANGPTL4+/+ mouse lung tissue featured severe edema that destroyed the alveolar structures, leaving diminished alveolar walls. we observed an improvement in lung tissue integrity in ANGPTL4/ mice compared with their wild-type counterparts. Deficiency in the cANGPTL4 protein reduces pulmonary edema. infected wild-type mice treated with the anti-cANGPTL4 antibody. anti-cANGPTL4 treatment better preserved the structure of the alveolus (white arrow) compared to diminished alveolar structures due to severe edema in the lungs of the Flu+S3 group of mice (black arrow) n = 5 mice per time point for each experimental group. values are shown in log2. n = 5 mice were used for each experimental group. anti-cANGPTL4 MAb treatment improved immune function against secondary bacterial infection (Flu+S3), as well as coagulation to reduce bleeding and edema in the lungs. cANGPTL4 deficiency reduces pulmonary edema and protects lung tissue integrity. antibiotics constitute the first-line therapy for bacterial pneumonia. antibody treatments alone improved lung tissue integrity and reduced edema. the efficacy of a combined approach was confirmed by marked improvements in the mouse survival rate and lung tissue integrity. similar trends were observed in ANGPTL4/ mice receiving antibiotic and antipneumolysin treatment. cells were tracked for 48 h using the JuLi Stage system for live imaging. cells were tracked for 48 h using the JuLi Stage system for live imaging. n = 4 independent experiments; Scale bar = 50 m. the host response protein cANGPTL4 and bacterial virulence factor pneumolysin were targeted using cognate neutralizing antibodies. the antipneumolysin antibody mitigated the pore-forming action of pneumolysin in human alveolar epithelial cells and reduced tissue damage. this effect persisted for 48 h. the improved phagocytosis and bacterial digestion suggest that anti-cANGPTL4 treatment enhances host immune function. cANGPTL4 immunoneutralization activates immune defenses against bacterial infection. anti-cANGPTL4 antibody treatment, either alone or in combination with antibiotic treatment, increased the expression of host immune defense-related genes. the combined treatment using anti-cANGPTL4 and an antibiotic generated a greater enhancement of gene expression than the anti-cANGPTL4 treatment alone. cANGPTL4 protein was elevated in the pulmonary fluid of patients with severe pneumonia. it also supports the potential utility of cANGPTL4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for diagnosis and treatment of infection-associated lung injury. mice were intratracheally infected with the influenza virus on day 0. subsequently infected intratracheally with either S. pneumoniae serotype 3 (S3) or 19F at 7 days post-influenza infection (dpi) secondary pneumococcal infection significantly increases pulmonary edema. the bronchiolar epithelium and alveolar tissues were infiltrated with immune cells and damaged by the influenza virus infection at 7 dpi prior to bacterial challenge. from 8 to 11 dpi, lungs were harvested daily from mice infected by the influenza virus (Flu), bacteria (S3 or 19F), or influenza with bacterial superinfection (Flu+S3 or Flu+19F) to assess the extent of edema in the infected the fluid-filled alveolar spaces may encourage bacterial growth. fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of infected mouse lung tissue to identify the distribution of bacteria. n = 5 mice per time point for each experimental group. intra-alveolar erythrocytes and immune cells infiltrated the lung parenchyma in influenza-infected mice. the lungs of primary bacterial pneumonia-infected mice showed pulmonary tissue morphology similar to that of healthy control lungs. secondary pneumococcal pneumonia-infected mice showed distinct serotype specificity. immunofluorescence staining of the lung tissue revealed widespread distribution of cANGPTL4 in mice with primary influenza and secondary bacterial pneumonia. primary bacterial pneumonia-infected lungs showed cANGPTL4 immunostaining patterns that were similar to those in healthy control lung sections. elevated cANGPTL4 expression levels correlate well with pulmonary damage in secondary bacterial pneumonia. pneumonia-infected mouse lung tissue suggests an important role for cANGPTL4 in infection-induced pulmonary damage. we examined its impact on lung edema and tissue integrity during secondary bacterial pneumonia using ANGPTL4 knockout mice (ANGPTL4/) and immunoneutralization of cANGPTL4. ANGPTL4/ mice with secondary Flu+S3 and Flu+19F infections showed less pulmonary edema than their ANGPTL4+/+ representative image of lung harvested at 11 dpi from ANGPTL4 knockout (/), heterozygous (+/), and wild-type (+/+) mice infected with influenza virus and different pneumococcal serotypes (S3 and 19F) scale bar = 5 mm. n = 3 independent experiments with 5 mice per time point for each experimental group. mice were administered the anti-cANGPTL4 antibody (i and ii) or control IgG (iii and iv) white arrowheads indicate cell-cell junctions and collagen fibrils. bacteria are visible in control vehicle-treated mice with a secondary infection of serotype 3 (vi) anti-cANGPTL4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) into secondary pneumococcal pneumonia-infected mice. infected ANGPTL4+/+ mice treated with anti-cANGPTL4 MAb were protected against infection-associated lung damage. improved lung tissue integrity and reduced edema compared to infected but untreated ANGPTL4+/+ mice. the combined treatment significantly prolonged the median survival time of infected mice (80%) compared to zero survival of mice receiving the control IgG treatment or moxifloxacin alone. this combined treatment better protected alveolar integrity and reduced residual fluid in the alveolar spaces, thus indicating its efficacy in ameliorating lung edema. five mice were used for each experimental group. Combined treatment with antibiotics and anti-cANGPTL4 antibody or with anti-cANGPTL4 antibody and antipneumolysin antibody further improved the lung tissue integrity from single treatment with either antibody or antibiotics. host response protein cANGPTL4 and bacterial virulence factor pneumolysin were targeted using cognate neutralizing antibodies. antipneumolysin antibody mitigated the pore-forming action of pneumolysin in human alveolar epithelial cells. this effect persisted for 48 h compared to treatment with either the antibiotic or a single antibody. immunotherapy against cANGPTL4 enhances host immune responses against secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. qPCR on fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-sorted major immune cell groups revealed macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells expressed ANGPTL4 at various levels. inset shows a higher-magnification view of a semidigested bacterium inside a lymphocyte. anti-cANGPTL4 antibody treatment, either alone or in combination with antibiotic treatment, increased expression of host immune defense-related genes. anti-cANGPTL4 treatment increased expression of host immune defense-related genes. cANGPTL4 protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with pneumonia. all clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae secrete toxic pore-forming pneumolysin. this supports a broad application of an antipneumolysin antibody in new treatments against DRSP infection. ANGPTL4 protein (cANGPTL4) in (A) BALF samples (control, n = 16; ARDS, n = 7) and (B) serum samples (control, n = 8; pneumonia, n = 17) from control healthy volunteers and patients with lung disease. DISCUSSION S. pneumoniae is a major cause of acute pneumonia. pathogen-induced lung injury can manifest as mild to severe ARDS, as seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, influenza virus, and secondary bacterial pneumococcal infections (1, 31, 32) anti-inflammatory treatments can inhibit the immune functions that mediate pathogen clearance. cANGPTL4 is a key player in tissue leakiness (24, 47\u201349) primary influenza pneumonia and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury are associated with an increased expression of cANGPTL4. cANGPTL4 suppression by small interfering RNA also protects mice against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury (48). mice were anesthetized using 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg body weight xylazine. at day 7 post-influenza infection, 100 CFU of serotype 3 or 5,000 CFU of serotype 19F of S. pneumoniae in PBS was delivered intratracheally to the mice. pneumolysin antibody was prepared by culturing an MG12 hybridoma culture in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and purified from the culture medium using the IgG purification kit (Merck Millipore, no. LSK2ABG20) the anti-CD68 antibody was purchased from Abcam (no. 31630) mice were harvested from influenza virus- and S. pneumoniae serotype 3-coinfected mice at day 9 post-influenza virus infection by bronchoalveolar lavage. one milliliter of sterile PBS was injected into the mouse lung through the trachea and retrieved into the syringe. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min, stained for flow cytometry, and sorted using a BD FACSA protein samples were heated in 2 Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to low-fluorescence polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) the integrity of the total RNA and the level of DNA contamination were assessed. differentially expressed genes were identified by performing a negative binomial test. transcripts were determined as differentially expressed when they showed a >2-fold change with an adjusted P value of 0.05. controls for BALF samples were obtained from healthy volunteers. mice were anesthetized using 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg body weight xylazine. at day 7 post-influenza infection, 100 CFU of serotype 3 or 5,000 CFU of serotype 19F of S. pneumoniae was delivered intratracheally to the mice. anti-mouse cANGPTL4 antibody and anti-human cANGPTL4 antibody produced in-house. antipneumolysin antibody was prepared by culturing an MG12 hybridoma culture in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. probe tagged with Cy5 in a hybridization buffer containing 30% formamide (55) the sections were mounted with an antifade reagent and imaged using the LSM780 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) RT-PCR was performed with the Bio-Rad CFX-96 real-time system.
