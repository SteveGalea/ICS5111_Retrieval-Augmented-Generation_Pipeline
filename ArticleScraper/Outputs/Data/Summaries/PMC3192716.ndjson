{"summary": "Background Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) stimulation has been used successfully to treat nonunion fractures and femoral head osteonecrosis. but relatively little is known about its effects on preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats. the study was to investigate the effects of PEMF stimulation on the prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis. osteonecrosis of the femoral head is the end point of a disease process that results in progressive collapse of the femoral head followed by destruction of the hip joint. it has been recognized as a side effect of the corticosteroid used to treat diseases such as Acute Respiratory syndrome (SARS), Acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) PEMF stimulation for the prevention of osteonecrosis remains unclear. underlying mechanisms involve decreased serum lipid levels and increased expression of TGF-1. all experiment protocols adhered to guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. grouping and treatment All rats were divided into three groups by randomized block design according to weight. the coils contained 500 turns of enameled copper wire with diameter of 0.8 mm. each of them contained 500 turns of enameled copper wire with diameter of 0.8 mm. each of the coils contained 500 turns of enameled copper wire with diameter of 0.8 mm. the coils were separately placed at a distance of 25 cm. the diagnosis of osteonecrosis was established based on the presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis [18]. if the diagnoses differed between the two examiners, a consensus was reached by discussing the findings without knowledge of the group from which the sample was obtained. cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5'- GGCGGTGCTCGCTTTGTA-3' (forward) and 5'-GCGGGTGACTTCTTTGGC-3' (reverse) -actin cDNA was amplified as an internal control using the primers 5'-TGGTGGGTATGTA-3' (forward) and 5'-ATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAAGGTC-3' (reverse) unoprecipitation buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime institute of Biotechnology, China) was centrifuged twice at 14000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 min to remove cell debris, nuclei and large particulates. a quarter volume of 5 loading buffer was added and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min then stored at -20\u00b0C until electrophoresis. one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey's post hoc test was used to examine differences between groups. all rats were housed individually in custom-designed Plexiglas cages. all experiment protocols adhered to guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. six rats in each group were sacrificed, and the samples were collected 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the last MPSL (or saline) injection. the rats were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (240 mg/kg ip) the rats were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (240 mg/kg ip) proximal one-third of right femurs was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde- 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by decalcification with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)- 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) the tissues were dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-m thick sections in the coronal plane. total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. the concentration of RNA was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (A260) the integrity and size distribution of RNA were confirmed by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide and photographed by the Geliance 200 Imaging System (PerkinElmer, USA) the optical density of the bands was analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) the proteins on the membrane were visualized using an ECL plus detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buchinghamshire, UK) the optical density of the bands was analyzed with Quantity One software. expression of TGF-1 was then normalized against -actin. group 1 week 2 weeks 4 weeks 8

0.05) mRNA expression levels of TGF-1 were evaluated by PCR analysis. data are expressed as expression ratios normalized to -actin gene expression. in the present study, the steroid-induced osteonecrosis model was established in rats by a single injection of low-dose LPS combined with three subsequent injections of high-dose MPSL [17]. in the present study, the incidence of osteonecrosis (in the MPSL group) was 75%, and no rats died during the experimental period, indicating that this rat model is safe and effective. the incidence of osteonecrosis in the PEMF group was markedly lower than in the corresponding samples in the MPSL group at all time points. the total incidence of osteonecrosis was 29% versus 75% in the two groups, respectively. several studies have shown that PEMF can decrease serum lipid levels. we also hypothesized that its preventative effect on steroid-induced osteonecrosis occurs via a mechanism independent of lipid metabolism. high-dose corticosteroid administration is the most common risk factor for osteonecrosis. daily treatment of PEMF is both time consuming and demanding. patients may find it preferable to perform the treatment at night. SD, HP and HSF were involved in the design of the study. JLZ and ZW carried out the molecular analysis. SD and HP drafted the manuscript."}
