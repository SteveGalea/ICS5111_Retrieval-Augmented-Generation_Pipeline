{"summary": "microbial agents causing outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate directly from animals [1]\u2013[3]. human outbreaks due to zoonotic bacteria associated with the emergence of a novel animal virus in the animal host were not previously documented. have C. psittaci infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or a four-fold rise in serum microimmunofluorescent antibody titer against C. psittaci. four carcasses from the batch were sent to Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory for postmortem examination and disease diagnosis. the lower detection limit was 100 copies per reaction (12,000 copies/ml of viral transport medium). the lower detection limit was 100 copies per reaction (12,000 copies/ml of viral transport medium). wab samples of the Mealy Parrots were screened by consensus primers for common respiratory viral agents including influenza virus, coronavirus, infectious bursal disease virus, beak and feather disease virus, hepatitis E virus and the virus families Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Astroviridae, Arteriviridae, and Herpesviridae. the PCR products were gel purified using the Q complete genome sequences of the three strains of Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 were amplified and sequenced directly from the mealy Parrot samples. additional primers for subsequent rounds of PCR were designed by multiple alignment of genomes of related adenoviruses. sequence was submitted to NCBI GenBank and is available under the accession number KJ675568. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using PHYML version 3 [25]. phylogenetic informative regions were extracted using GBLOCKS [24]. the best-fit protein evolution model was selected by ProtTest 3 [26]. specific guinea pig antiserum was produced by injecting 200 g of recombinant fiber protein into the thighs of guinea pigs intramuscularly. incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used in subsequent immunizations. three injections were completed in six weeks, with one injection every two weeks. ittaci and 600 copies/ml for adenovirus were assigned to specimens that tested negative. log-transformed viral loads were used for statistical analysis. outbreak investigation A case was defined as a staff member who was hospitalized for respiratory tract infection between November 1 and November 30, 2012. PCR detection of C. psittaci The bacterial load of C. psittaci was detected using real-time PCR with lightCycler 96 system. lower detection limit was 100 copies per reaction (12,000 copies/ml of viral transport medium). consensus primers for adenovirus were designed by performing multiple alignments of pol genes of adenovirus and related sequences available in NCBI GenBank. the PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3130xl DNA analyzer. screening of novel adenovirus (Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) in other animals and humans Conventional PCR using specific primers were used to screen for the novel adenovirus (Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) in other animals and humans. Virus genome sequencing Full-length genome sequences spanning the entire protein-coding regions were determined for three strains of Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 identified in present study functional annotation of predicted proteins was performed by BLAST similarity search against annotations in RefSeq database. multiple alignments of sequences were constructed using MUSCLE [23], and phylogenetic informative regions were extracted using GBLOCKS [22]. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using PHYML version 3 [25], under best-fit protein evolution model. the fiber fragment was cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of expression vector pET-28b(+) in frame and downstream of a series of six histidine residues. guinea pig antiserum was produced by injecting 200 g of purified His6-tagged recombinant fiber protein. correlation of C. psittaci bacterial load and adenovirus viral load was determined using linear regression analysis. log-transformed viral loads were used for statistical analysis. NTNAMC is a center where animal case-exhibits are detained. two Mealy Parrots died naturally, while 14 developed disease and were euthanized. of the 16 Mealy Parrots, 4 were sent for postmortem examination. sections were incubated with immune serum (panels D, F, G, I) or with non-immune serum (panels E and H) of guinea pigs. apple green fluorescent foci were seen in cytoplasm of pneumocytes (D) and in the nucleus of hepatocytes (G) with immune serum. intestine, large intestine, muscle, gizzard and air sac Esophagus tissue and tracheal swab Liver: swollen Necrotising splenitis Liver tissue, esophagus tissue, pharyngeal swab and cloacal swab Both lungs: greyish pink in color and rubbery to feel Necrotising splenitis Liver tissue, rots unrelated to the outbreak were negative for C. psittaci or adenovirus. fecal samples taken from 25 other detained mammals, reptiles and avians were negative for both adenovirus and adenovirus. ulphur-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua galerita galerita galerita), one Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), one Eclectus Parrot (Cacatua moluccensis), one Eastern Rosella (Platycercus eximius), one Sun Conure (Aratinga solstitialis) and one blue-and-yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna) Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 antigen was detected in the lung and liver tissue cells of bird 2 but not bird 3. viral culture was negative for seven cloacal swabs, three lung samples, two liver samples and two kidney samples. the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from the bovine adenovirus E, bovine adenovirus D and ovine adenovirus D. the novel virus possesses a DNA polymerase, terminal protein and DNA-binding protein for DNA replication.
