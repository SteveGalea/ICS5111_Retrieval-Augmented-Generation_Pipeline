{"summary": "a new coronavirus causing severe viral pneumonia in the Arabian peninsula has emerged, i.e., middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) a decade following the SARS epidemic, a new coronavirus causing severe viral pneumonia in the Arabian peninsula has emerged. the zoonotic vector and possible reservoir of MERS has been found to be dromedary camels. dromedary camels are the likely reservoir for MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula. the CDC has developed a real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR assay. MERS-CoV is present in ciliated bronchial epithelium, in terminal bronchial epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. avian influenza (H7N9) has a comparable high fatality rate and a high pandemic potential since the zoonotic vectors are migratory birds. outside of the Arabian Peninsula, MERS cases have been travel-related. the mortality of MERS is highest in those with comorbidities. as with non-pandemic influenza, the mortality of MERS is highest in those with comorbidities. a unilateral basilar infiltrate is common initially resembling a lobar/segmental bacterial pneumonia. a unilateral basilar infiltrate is common initially resembling a lobar/segmental bacterial pneumonia. small pleural effusions are not uncommon. the clinical feature which distinguishes MERS from influenza is the relatively high frequency of renal involvement, i.e., renal failure with MERS5,14-16 (Table 1). Clinical features of selected zoonotic viral pneumonias. aparticularly with myocarditis; busually leukocytosis; cunless sequential coinfection a week after improvement with S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae; epredominately peripheral infiltrates; epredominately peripheral infiltrates; WBC, white blood count; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase test; CPK, creatine phosphokinase test. household and family members exposed to potential or actual MERS cases should avoid public transportation, school, and work while ill. the individuals who are at increased risk for MERS include recent travelers from the Arabian Peninsula, particularly if such travelers develop fever and an ILI within 14 d after traveling. healthcare workers in contact with or taking care of MERS patients are at particularly high risk for developing MERS. contact and airborne precautions should be used to minimize the exposure of healthcare workers to suspected or known hospitalized MERS cases."}
