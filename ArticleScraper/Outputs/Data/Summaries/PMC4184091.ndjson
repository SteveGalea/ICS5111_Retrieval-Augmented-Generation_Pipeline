{"summary": "global burden of disease 2010 (GBD 2010) was used to estimate the country-level burden of disease in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. we used data from systematic reviews of literature, household survey data, antenatal clinic surveillance data, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions data, outpatient visit data, and population-based cancer registries. illegal migration to KSA for work or Hajj adds to this burden because most illegal immigrants do not have the required vaccinations. in recent years, an emerging burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is unfolding. YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs measure premature mortality and time spent in less than ideal health (12). YLDs are the number of deaths attributed to a disease multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death in years (12). YLD is the prevalence of each disease or injury sequela multiplied by the associated disability weight for that sequela. IHME developed a database of published and unpublished data sources to estimate the burden of disease for KSA. key sources included systematic reviews of literature, household surveys, antenatal clinic surveillance, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, population-based cancer registries, screening results, and other administrative sources. IHME developed a database of published and unpublished data sources to estimate the burden of disease for KSA. key sources included systematic reviews of literature, household surveys, antenatal clinic surveillance, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, population-based cancer registries, screening results. results From 1990 through 2010, there was a decline in age-specific mortality in KSA (Figure 1).
