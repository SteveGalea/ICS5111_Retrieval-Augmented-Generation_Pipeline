{"summary": "viruses with dsRNA genomes assemble particles around positive-sense RNA [(+) RNA] and generate dsRNA only within enclosed capsids (1\u20133). dsRNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with highly modified host membranes. these membrane modifications are sufficient to protect viral RNA from nuclease degradation. spherules are structurally similar to those formed by the plant virus brome mosaic virus (BMV) the similarities were assumed to indicate that FHV invaginations are formed in a manner comparable to those seen in BMV (13). spherules can be induced in the absence of any other viral factors. the significance of these observations has yet to be explored. we have optimized a cell-free replication system consisting of crude mitochondria from FHV-infected Drosophila cells. this system contains all necessary components for vRNA replication. cells were then resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer per 2.5 108 cells. unlysed cells and debris were pelleted at 1,500 g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C. mitochondrial pellet was gently resuspension in mitochondrial resuspension buffer. RNA was resuspended in a 10-l solution (7 l RNase-free water plus 3 l gel loading buffer II [Ambion]), heated to 55\u00b0C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and resolved on 1.5% native agarose gels. total RNA products were resolved alongside ssRNA1 and ssRNA2 generated by in vitro transcription. RNA polymerase assay mixtures were incubated for 90 min before the addition of micrococcal nucleases with or without detergents. images were acquired using an FEI Tecnai F20 Twin transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. cells were infected with gradient-purified FHV (MOI = 10) twenty hours after infection, cells were chemically fixed on 35-by-10-mm glass-bottom petri dishes for 1 h on ice. cells were stained in the dish with 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min on ice and washed with water followed by 2% uranyl acetate. reitol [DTT], 0.28 M sucrose, protease inhibitor cocktail set V [Millipore]) cells were then resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer per 2.5 108 cells. unlysed cells and debris were pelleted at 1,500 g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C. supernatants pooled to generate a cleared lysate. all reaction mixtures contained 0.16 mM Mn2+ and 3.2 mM Mg2+. total RNA was resuspended in a 10-l solution (7 l RNase-free water plus 3 l gel loading buffer II [Ambion]), heated to 55\u00b0C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and resolved on 1.5% native agarose gels. mixtures were incubated for 90 min before the addition of micrococcal nuclease with or without detergents. undiluted isolated mitochondria (3 l) in mitochondrial resuspension buffer without glycerol were placed on 2.0/0.5 C-flat grids. images were acquired using an FEI Tecnai F20 Twin transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV and equipped with a CMOS digital camera. cells were chemically fixed on 35-by-10-mm glass-bottom petri dishes (Ted Pella) with 2% glutaraldehyde (in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer; pH 7.4) for 1 h on ice. cells were stained in the dish with 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min on ice. cells were then dehydrated in an ethanol/water gradient and embedded in Durcupan resin in dish. total RNA was extracted and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. radiolabeled progeny bands were identified as double-stranded and single-stranded species of RNA 1 and RNA 2 based on previously published observations. dsRNA1 consistently appeared as a doublet throughout this study. RNA, RNase H digests DNA:RNA hybrids, and micrococcal nuclease digests single-stranded and double-stranded RNA and DNA. the doublet for dsRNA1 was assigned based on resistance to RNase A digestion and increased size in comparison to ssRNA1 and was consistently observed throughout all experiments. a wide range of parameters was tested in order to identify optimal reaction conditions. these included the evaluation of compositional differences in the two previously reported systems. the analysis revealed that only the type and concentration of divalent cations had a significant impact on RNA replication efficiency. b Template RNA was either viral RNA copurified with mitochondrial fractions or viral RNA purified from virus particles or a combination of the two. to determine which concentration produced the largest amount of progeny RNA, total RNAs from reaction mixtures containing various amounts of added divalent cations were resolved and visualized using a phosphorimager. RNA replication reaction mixtures were prepared in the presence or absence of 1% NP-40 or 1% Triton X-100. reaction mixtures containing either detergent produced only small amounts of dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 (4-fold and 9-fold less than the control, respectively) no ssRNA was detected. dsRNA2 was the last species to be completely digested when purified vRNA products were incubated with MN. dsRNA2 was the last species to be completely digested when purified vRNA products were incubated with MN. spherules generated in isolated mitochondrial membranes were visualized using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) this technique allows preservation and analysis of specimens in a frozen-hydrated state. isolated mitochondria are small enough to be imaged whole, without the need for sectioning. all of the spherules consisted of spherical double membranes that encapsulated swirls of density inside the lumen. spherules were not as uniform in size as those described previously (13), but had a similar overall structure (body and neck) and similar dimensions (35 to 65 nm in diameter) the second described the biochemical characterization of a protein A-maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion construct expressed in Escherichia coli. our assay relied on isolation of crude mitochondria from FHV-infected Drosophila S2 cells by differential centrifugation. dsRNA1 consistently appeared as a doublet throughout this study. radiolabeled RNA products were resolved alongside radiolabeled in vitro-transcribed single-stranded FHV RNA1 and RNA 2 (A) or nuclease-digested FHV replication (Rep.) products (B). the doublet for dsRNA1 was assigned based on resistance to RNase A digestion and increased size in comparison to ssRNA1. the peak at 18 mM Mg2+ was less pronounced in some replicates. this concentration of added magnesium consistently generated the most RNA product. asterisks in lane 1 indicate faintly visible progeny RNA in the absence of added template. b Template RNA was either viral RNA copurified with mitochondrial fractions or viral RNA purified from virus particles or a combination of the two. total RNAs from reaction mixtures containing various amounts of added divalent cations were resolved. 4.5-fold more radiolabeled RNA was generated in the presence of Mg2+ than in the presence of Mn2+. intact membranes are required for efficient RNA synthesis. effect of membrane destabilization on RNA replication was also assessed. reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 min to generate significant amounts of radiolabeled RNA. in the absence of detergent, only ssRNA was degraded, with significant amounts of both dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 remaining intact. the addition of detergent alone, in the absence of MN, consistently resulted in a decrease in intensity of both ssRNA1 and dsRNA1. vRNA products were incubated with MN after reinitiation of RNA replication. spherules form in mitochondrial membranes following reinitiation of RNA replication. the precise organization of these structures and how they enable viral replication proteins to support genome synthesis are still unclear. the lack of membrane invaginations was consistent with previous observations showing that spherule formation requires active RNA replication (12). the mitochondria were fragile following replication reinitiation, but numerous spherules were detectable in mitochondrial fragments after the incubation (Fig. 5C and D) cells develop spherules after preincubation in RNA replication mix. white arrows indicate areas where density is seen coming out of the neck region of spherules. TEM of fixed and stained sections from FHV-infected Drosophila cells. in reactions using cell extracts (26, 34) in contrast to the 1 mM Mn2+ suggested by a more recent biochemical study performed using a purified protein A-MBP fusion protein (27). the sources and contexts of protein A are different, consisting of wild-type protein embedded in OMM in this study in contrast to a purified, heterologously expressed protein A-MBP fusion protein. this suggests that Mg2+ is the preferred catalytic metal ion required for maximum protein A activity. this suggests that Mn2+ may be able to substitute during replication initiation and/or dsRNA synthesis. previous studies had established that complete RNA replication of FHV RNA is stimulated by the addition of glycerophospholipids. however, the requirement of intact membrane surfaces for protein A activity had yet to be demonstrated. dsRNA is readily accessible to nucleases regardless of detergent. ssRNA is less likely to elicit intracellular defense responses. dsRNA is directly targeted by host RNA interference (RNAi) defense systems. the additional B2 could represent an extra level of defense against a system that, if activated, has the potential to rapidly and completely shut down FHV replication. this could be an additional important area of activity for B2: protection of regions of secondary structure in both ssRNA1 and ssRNA2. our ability to preserve mitochondrial spherules in the frozen-hydrated state sets the stage for analysis by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) cryoET can achieve resolutions below 5 nm (41\u201343) and has previously been used to determine the structure of the mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase dimer in situ. protein 1a is thought to line the internal surface of ER invaginations (8, 16) lack of additional factors suggests that in BMV there is no external signal required for spherule formation. dsRNA could play an important role in structural maintenance and spherule formation."}
