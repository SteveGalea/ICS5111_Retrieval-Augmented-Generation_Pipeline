{"summary": "resurgence in popularity of spinal anesthesia has occurred for a number of reasons that are not limited to postoperative apnea. new medications, improved monitoring modalities, and advancement in pediatric anesthesiology training have all contributed to the safety of contemporary pediatric anesthesia practice. the patient was an 8-month-old, 9.4 kg boy scheduled for diagnostic laparoscopy and bilateral orchidopexy. the patient underwent an uneventful inhalation induction with the incremental administration of sevoflurane up to 8% in 100% oxygen. laparoscopic findings included bilateral intra-abdominal testes. at this time, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was 1.1%. at this time, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.7%. the inguinal incision rapidly closed with the testis left in the inguinal canal. the patient quickly regained consciousness and his trachea was extubated. he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management and evaluation. the patient was placed in the sitting position using a 1.5-inch, 22-gauge spinal needle. after sterile preparation, the intrathecal space was accessed on the first attempt. a single dose of dexmedetomidine was administered intravenously during the first 15 minutes of the procedure. cardiovascular causes of cardiac arrest are now the most common (41% of all arrests), with hypovolemia from blood loss and hyperkalemia from the rapid transfusion of blood the most common etiologies. hypoxemia from blood loss and hyperkalemia from the rapid transfusion of blood are the most commonly identified etiologies. the first episode of bradycardia occurred during the initial insufflation for laparoscopy. however, such profound hemodynamic changes are uncommon with laparoscopy. a second intraoperative episode occurred after laparoscopy and insufflation were discontinued. spinal anesthesia in high-risk pediatric patients has been described in prior studies. the authors would not suggest or condone such a practice in the absence of significant experience with spinal anesthesia in neonates and infants."}
