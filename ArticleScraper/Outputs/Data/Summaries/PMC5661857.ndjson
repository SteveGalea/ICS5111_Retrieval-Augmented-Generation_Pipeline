{"summary": "influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of the characteristics of the 2 main surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and numbered accordingly. the natural reservoir for nearly all influenza A viruses is wild waterfowl. sporadic human infections with either low-pathogenic or highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses can result in a wide spectrum of illness. sporadic human infections with either low-pathogenic or highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses can result in a wide spectrum of illness, ranging from mild to severe to fatal disease. among the 858 infections, 793 (92.4%) have been reported from 5 countries: Egypt (358 infections), Indonesia (199), Vietnam (127), Cambodia (56), and China (53) of all reported infections, 52.8% (453/858) have been fatal. most reported infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) have been hospitalized with pneumonia. most reported infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) have been hospitalized with pneumonia, and decedents had multi-organ failure. 42 countries reported to WHO a total of 172,454 cases with 1,304 deaths attributable to cholera in 2015. 71,176 cases (41.3%) and 937 deaths (74.6%) were reported from sub-Saharan Africa;38 none of these cases was imported. cholera has maintained a presence in the country since the 2010 outbreak. a total of 21 oral cholera vaccine deployments of about 4 million doses have been used in various contexts. to prevent international spread of cholera, particularly among travelers, is the recent licensure and availability of VaxchoraTM. a Virus Disease Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 when an outbreak of an acute viral hemorrhagic fever occurred in what was formerly northern Zaire. signs and symptoms were nonspecific at clinical onset but progressed to include others such as sore throat, fever, maculopapular rash, abdominal pain, and bleeding. there were 318 cases reported in association with this outbreak, with 280 deaths. a total of 28,646 suspected, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases with 11,323 deaths had been reported from Guinea (3,811 cases; 2,543 deaths), Liberia (10,675; 4,809), Sierra Leone (14,124; 3,956), Nigeria (20,124; 3,956) and Senegal (1 case), resulting from importation of cases and minimal sustained transmission. the outbreak was declared over in June 2016. however, we closely monitor any reports of cases that could appear to be a viral hemorrhagic fever. we may provide early warning for a rapid response to prevent another massive global outbreak. the first travel-related cases of yellow fever disease since 2002 were identified in association with this outbreak. yellow fever can present as an acute viral hemorrhagic disease and is fatal in 20% to 50% of severe cases. it is caused by yellow fever virus, the prototypic virus in the genus Flavivirus. a total of 4,347 suspected cases with 377 deaths have been reported to WHO. of these, 884 cases and 121 deaths were laboratory confirmed. the last confirmed case had symptom onset on June 23, 2016. chikungunya virus is an alphavirus spread by Aedes stegomyia mosquitoes. the virus can cause fast-moving, expansive outbreaks. it can cause fast-moving, expansive outbreaks. Zika virus was identified in 1947 when it was discovered in a sentinel rhesus monkey during routine surveillance for yellow fever in the Zika Forest near Entebbe, Uganda. the first human cases were identified in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania,69 with few reports of human infection in Asia and Africa over the next several decades. the outbreak resulted in 49 laboratory confirmed and 59 probable cases of Zika virus. Zika virus is in the genus Flavivirus and is transmitted by aedes stegomyia species mosquitoes. unlike dengue and chikungunya, the virus has been documented to be spread through sexual transmission. however, it has been documented to be spread through sexual transmission, complicating transmission dynamics of this virus. a total of 1,864 cases of MERS-CoV with at least 659 deaths had been reported to WHO from the Middle Eastern and northern African countries. an exported case of MERS-CoV in an emergency department patient with a history of travel to Bahrain, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar resulted in an outbreak of 186 cases of MERS-CoV with 36 deaths. influenza A viruses comprise 4 types: A, B, C, and D. influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes on the basis of the characteristics of the 2 main surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and numbered accordingly. sporadic human infections with avian influenza A viruses can result in a wide spectrum of illness, ranging from mild to severe to fatal disease. sporadic human infections with either low-pathogenic or highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses can result in a wide spectrum of illness. 3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, H10N7, H10N7, H10N7, H10N8), 2 subtypes of avian influenza A viruses have caused the highest number of human infections and are of special concern. highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection of humans was first identified in 1997 in Hong Kong. as of April 2017, nearly 1,400 infections in humans with avian influenza A (H7N9) have been reported from throughout China. most reported infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) have been hospitalized with pneumonia, and decedents had multi-organ failure. highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection of humans was first identified in 1997 in Hong Kong. the first case was identified in May of that year, and an additional 17 infections were detected in November and December 2017. since then, H5N1 virus infections among humans have been reported in 16 countries, including 1 in a person who traveled to Beijing, China, and was diagnosed with pneumonia and meningoencephalitis. of April 2017, there were nearly 1,400 infections in humans with avian influenza A (H7N9), with at least 530 deaths reported to WHO. of particular concern are those acquired in China and then exported to other countries and later diagnosed. most reported infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) have been hospitalized with pneumonia, and decedents had multi-organ failure. in 2015, 42 countries reported to WHO 172,454 cases with 1,304 deaths attributable to cholera. 71,176 cases (41.3%) and 937 deaths (74.6%) were reported from sub-Saharan Africa. none of these cases was imported. a total of 36,045 cases were reported in 2015 alone. cholera has maintained a presence in the country since the 2010 outbreak. a total of 21 oral cholera vaccine deployments of about 4 million doses to 11 countries have been used. outbreak of acute viral hemorrhagic fever was first discovered in 1976. symptoms were nonspecific at clinical onset but progressed to include others. 318 cases reported in association with this outbreak, with 280 deaths. outbreak was confirmed as an Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) associated outbreak. cases increased to 86 cases with 59 deaths; all cases were epidemiologically linked. cases began to be reported from other Guinean prefectures, including the capital Conakry and from liberia. the GDDOC monitored this global outbreak very closely because of the unforeseen explosion of cases and transmission across international borders. this occurred as a result of weakened or fractured healthcare infrastructure, continued infection of healthcare workers, and anthropologic or cultural concerns. the outbreak was declared over in June 2016; however, we continue to closely monitor any reports, including media reports, in hopes of quickly identifying any additional EVD that could be a result of, for example, sexual transmission from EVD survivors. the first travel-related cases of yellow fever disease since 2002 were identified in association with this outbreak. yellow fever can present as an acute viral hemorrhagic disease and is fatal in 20% to 50% of severe cases. a total of 4,347 suspected cases with 377 deaths have been reported to WHO. of these, 884 cases and 121 deaths were laboratory confirmed. the last confirmed case had symptom onset on June 23, 2016. chikungunya virus is an alphavirus spread by Aedes stegomyia mosquitoes. it can cause fast-moving, expansive outbreaks. the disease spread to 43 countries or territories. the GDDOC continues to conduct event-based surveillance for reports of illness potentially attributable to chikungunya virus. the first human cases were identified in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania. in 2007 on Yap Island, Micronesia, an outbreak of an unknown illness was identified to be attributable to Zika virus. 73 countries and territories worldwide have reported evidence of mosquito-borne transmission of the virus since 2007, with 71 reported since 2015.72. the virus is in the genus Flavivirus and, like dengue and chikungunya, is transmitted primarily by Aedes stegomyia species mosquitoes, notably Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. the first travel-related cases of yellow fever disease since 2002 were identified in association with this outbreak. yellow fever can present as an acute viral hemorrhagic disease and is fatal in 20% to 50% of severe cases. the virus is transmitted through the bite of a mosquito. a total of 4,347 suspected cases with 377 deaths have been reported to WHO. of these, 884 cases and 121 deaths were laboratory confirmed. the last confirmed case had symptom onset on June 23, 2016. chikungunya virus is an alphavirus spread by aedes stegomyia mosquitoes. it can cause fast-moving, expansive outbreaks. the disease spread to 43 countries or territories. GDDOC continues to conduct event-based surveillance for reports of illness potentially attributable to chikungunya virus. streamlined communications with CDC allow for prioritization of resources, including staff and funding. Zika virus was identified in 1947 when it was discovered in a sentinel rhesus monkey during routine surveillance for yellow fever in the Zika Forest near Entebbe, Uganda. nearly 50 countries and territories in the u.s. have reported autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of the virus since 2007. 73 countries and territories worldwide have reported evidence of mosquito-borne transmission of the virus since 2007, with 71 reported since 2015.72. a total of 1,864 cases of MERS-CoV with at least 659 deaths had been reported to WHO from the Middle Eastern and northern African countries. an exported case of MERS-CoV in an emergency department patient with a history of travel to Bahrain, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar resulted in an outbreak of 186 cases of MERS-CoV with 36 deaths. no cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus had been reported to WHO compared with 3 cases at the same time in 2016. monitoring polio will continue to be important because of the debilitating neurologic disease poliovirus causes. even 1 case will represent an international public health emergency. since then, cases of wild poliomyelitis have declined, after a peak in 2013 (416 cases), trending downward through 2014 (359 cases), 2015 (74 cases), and, as of April 19, 2017, 5 cases of wild poliomyelitis had been reported to WHO. no cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) had been reported to WHO compared with 3 cases at the same time in 2016."}
