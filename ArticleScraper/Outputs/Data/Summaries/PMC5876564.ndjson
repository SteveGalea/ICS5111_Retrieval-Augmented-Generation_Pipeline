{"summary": "the virus is an alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. it causes highly contagious viral enteritis in swine. the virus was first identified in England in 1971 and then in other european countries. PEDV Propagation and Quantification A strain of PEDV was propagated on vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587, Manassas, VA, USA) the virus was harvested three days post infection using one freeze-thaw cycle. after centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 80 \u00b0C. the applied virus was air dried for 2 h in a biosafety cabinet (BSC) sets of virus-contaminated fomites were stored at either room temperature (25 \u00b0C) or at 4 \u00b0C. the surviving virus was eluted from each material in 1 mL of 3% beef extract 0.05 M glycine buffer placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. RNA isolation kit was designed to amplify a portion of the PEDV S gene. primer and probe were added to AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT-PCR reagents. amplification was quantified using a FAM labeled probe 1939: FAM-TGAGTTTTCAATTCACA. plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with one of the following primary antibodies. wells were then washed three times with wash buffer and incubated for 1 h. immunostained cells were observed under a light microscope. the virus was harvested three days post infection (d.p.i.) using one freeze-thaw cycle. after centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min, the supernatant was aliquoted. surviving virus was eluted from each material in 1 mL of 3% beef extract 0.05 M glycine. eluates were filtered through 0.22 M membrane filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by virus titration on vero cell monolayers. eluates were processed independently for quantification of infectious virus and viral RNA. -IDTM One-Step RT-PCR reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) followed by 5 L of extracted total RNA followed by amplification with 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. wells were infected with 200 L of 10-fold serially diluted sample eluate or stock PEDV. incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. plates were incubated for approximately 20 min with 1-StepTM NBT/BCIP substrate solution. limit of the assay (2 102 TCID50/mL) after 15 days at 4 \u00b0C. surviving virus was eluted after various time periods. surviving virus was delayed when stored at 4 \u00b0C. in immunoplaque assay, we re-tested virus stability on certain fomite materials after 20 days of storage at 4 \u00b0C. surviving virus on Tyvek\u00ae coverall and rubber surfaces was moderately above detection limit (24 FFU/mL) in contrast, no plaques were detected from fomite materials stored at RT for 48 h post application. quantifiable viral RNA was detected in fecal material spiked with cell culture grown virus. eluates from cardboard showed a Ct value of 21. no infectious virus was detected by either TCID50 or immunoplaque assay. infectious PEDV was recovered from fomite materials for up to 15 days post application at 4 \u00b0C. only 1 to 2 logs of virus were inactivated during the first 5 days post application. PEDV was applied on nine fomites at room temperature (RT) and at 4 \u00b0C. the surviving virus was eluted after various time periods and titrated. data presented are average number of FFU SEM from two independent experiments. using the immunoplaque assay, we re-tested virus stability on certain fomite materials after 20 days of storage at 4 \u00b0C. surviving virus on Tyvek\u00ae coverall and rubber surfaces was moderately above detection limit. quantifiable viral RNA was detected in fecal material spiked with cell culture grown virus. no infectious virus was detected by either TCID50 or immunoplaque assay. eluates from fecal samples induced remarkable cell toxicity. culture-grown PEDV remains viable for extended periods when dried and maintained in a cold environment. the virus remained viable at 4 \u00b0C for up to 20-days on Styrofoam, metal, and plastic. the temperature-sensitive feature of PEDV may be applied to routine procedures in the farms to help eradicate PEDV in the environment. the type of fomite material also has implications on viral stability. we found that infectious PEDV survived at 4 \u00b0C on Styrofoam, metal, and plastic. PEDV transmission appears to be relatively effective via transportation vehicles [29,30] and feed [18,20,31,32] PEDV can survive on metal for up to 20 days at 4 \u00b0C. the longer survival of the virus at cold temperatures may also explain the increase in outbreaks during the winter season [15]. material and temperature impact viral stability over time, indicating the significance of understanding the nuances of indirect transmission in the epidemiology of PEDV."}
