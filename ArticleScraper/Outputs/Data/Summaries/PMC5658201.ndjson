{"summary": "acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is an important complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. high dose glucocorticosteroids are currently recommended as first-line treatment for grade II-IV aGVHD resulting in overall complete responses (CR) in 40%-50% of patients. allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been established as an important treatment modality for patients with hematological malignancies, aplastic anemia, and inborn errors of hematopoietic progenitor cells. major lethal and non-lethal complications still prohibit a broader application of alloSCT. first-line combination with methylprednisolone yielded a CR rate of 69% [7] second-line treatment resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% [8]. treatment with multi-agent combination therapy including etanercept has been reported to induce responses in 81% of patients. laxis for allograft recipients included cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) or its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) levels of CsA were measured by high performance liquid chromatography on whole blood samples and aimed at trough levels of 250\u2013350 g/L. since august 2012, patients with aGVHD of the lower gastrointestinal tract received levofloxacin. patients at risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivations were monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of plasma and treated preemptively according to local protocols. grade I aGVHD was graded according to the modified Glucksberg criteria [12]. first-line treatment consisted of prednisolone 2mg/kg/day and CsA or MPA/MMF. SR was defined as either progressive disease (PD) or mixed response (MR) after 7\u201314 days of first-line treatment. CR was defined as resolution of all signs and symptoms of aGVHD. PR was defined as improvement of 1 stage in 1 or more organs without progression in other organs. SD was defined as absence of improvement. PD was defined as progression in one organ without progression in other organs. acute GVHD developed at a median of 61 days after transplantation. all other patients had grade III GVHD of the gut, the majority had involvement of a second organ. one patient was treated with high dose steroids combined with MMF. mphocytic leukemia; HL = Hodgkin lymphoma CR = complete remission, PR = partial remission, SD = stable disease MA = myeloablative, NMA = non-myeloablative, RIC = reduced intensity conditioning CB = cord blood donor, MUD = matched unrelated donor, SIB = sibling donor SR-aGVHD Initiation of second-line treatment with etanercept Second-line 0 4 III P/CsA 10 CsA/MMF 39 0 0 3 III P/CsA 11 MMF 393 0 1 4 III P/CsA 12 CsA 79 0 0 2 III P/MMF 13 CsA/MMF 41 3 0 2 III P/CsA 14 MMF/P 86 0 1 3 III P/CsA 15 CsA 44 0 3 4 III P/CsA Response to second- GVHD 4 9 PR Dead 47 GVHD 5 24 PR Dead 267 Infection 6 11 PD Dead 12 Infection 7 9 PD Dead 6 Infection 8 20 PD Dead 17 Infection 9 36 PR Dead 89 GVHD 10 5 PD Dead 48 GVHD 11 13 PR Dead 87 GVHD 12 28 CR Dead 109 Cardiac 13 19 PD Dead 5 GVHD a Interval (days) between start of 1st line treatment and introduction of eta median OS was 99 days (range 47\u2013267 days) for responders and 17 days (range 5\u201366 days) for non-responders. causes of death were progressive aGVHD in 7 patients (47%), infection in 6 patients (40%), relapsed acute myeloid leukemia in one patient (6.7%), and cardiac arrest in 1 patient (6.7%). the characteristics of all 15 patients treated with etanercept for SR-aGVHD are shown in Table 1. Median age was 54 years (range 22\u201365 years), eleven patients were male. one patient received a myeloablative conditioning (MA) regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (2 x 60 mg/kg) and 2 x 6 Gray (Gy) total body irradiation (TBI) 57 F AML CR NMA SIB 4 60 M CLL PR NMA MUD 5 53 F ALL CR RIC CB 6 59 M MPD SD RIC MUD 7 60 M MDS Untreated NMA MUD 8 39 F AML CR MA MUD 9 55 M MPD SD RIC MUD 10 65 M NHL CR NMA SIB 12 52 M NHL PR RIC CB 13 53 M T-PLL CR NMA MUD 14 22 M HL SD SD N median number of etanercept doses was 16 (range 1\u201323) eight out of fifteen patients received at least all planned doses of etanercept. seven patients died while on therapy. etanercept had to be discontinued because of eBV-reactivation and development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. in the third CR patient etanercept had to be discontinued, because of EBV-reactivation and development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. etanercept had to be discontinued, because of EBV-reactivation and development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) initiation of second-line treatment with etanercept was initiated at a median of 13 days (range 5\u201336 days) after start of first-line treatment with high-dose steroids. high-dose prednisolone was maintained until achievement of objective GvHD response. eight out of fifteen patients received at least all planned doses of etanercept, seven died while on therapy. response rate was 53%, with 3 CR (20%) and 5 PR (33%) observed. this patient succumbed to a second relapse of his original malignancy approximately 14 weeks after etanercept had been started.

Xhaard et al. compared survival and infection rates in patients receiving MMF (56%), inolimomab (22%), or etanercept (23%) in addition to steroids and calcineurin inhibitors. study included a relatively high proportion of patients with severe stage III and IV aGVHD with bowel involvement. the combination of different agents with etanercept in some studies limit direct comparison of results. the rate of significant infectious complications is high in all reported studies. despite prophylaxis, three patients developed invasive mould infections. the first patient developed an invasive aspergillosis despite amphotericin inhalations. the third patient developed a double infection of voriconazole-resistant aspergillus. prospective studies should be prioritized to improve the grim prognosis of SR-aGVHD."}
