{"summary": "ninety-three institutions involved in laboratory diagnostics of SARS were invited to participate in the study. invitees were members of the international WHO SARS Reference and Verification Laboratory Network (9) or national and regional SARS reference laboratories. the study was announced as an external quality assurance study on diagnostic proficiency. the participants were asked to analyze the material with the molecular methods they routinely use in suspected cases in humans. details about the methods were requested, such as the sources of RT-PCR primers and protocols, the type of extraction method used, and suppliers and types of commercial kits, if used. the following criteria were chosen as minimum requirements for overall proficiency. 51 (88%) of 58 laboratories passed minimum requirements for successful participation. failure in three laboratories was due to lack of sensitivity, in three due to false-positive results, and in one due to both. fourteen of 58 participants used commercial test kits for noncommercial tests. fourteen of the 58 participants used at least one procedure listed on this site. fourteen of the participants used at least one procedure listed on this site. this study only examined paramount issues like sensitivity and control of contamination. commercial tests clearly were the preferred way of achieving good diagnostic performance, possibly because SARS-CoV is a pathogen with which relatively few laboratories have had experience."}
