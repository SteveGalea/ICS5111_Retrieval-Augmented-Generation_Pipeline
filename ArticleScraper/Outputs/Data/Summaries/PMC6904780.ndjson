{"summary": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) are retroviruses affecting cats worldwide. the aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of these retroviruses in domestic cats in Hungary. the infection is common worldwide and transmitted by secretions via the oronasal route. transmission is usually by direct inoculation (eg, bite and scratch wounds) the strains are grouped into seven phylogenetic subtypes A\u2013F and U-NZenv. 335 randomly selected, client-owned domestic cats were tested from all over Hungary over a period of 3 years. no free-roaming or sheltered cats were included in the survey. PCR was carried out in a QIAcube instrument (Qiagen) with the use of QIAmp cador Pathogen Mini kit. nucleic acid was eluted in 60 l RNase-free distilled water (Qiagen) topTaq master mix kit was used in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the amplification was 50\u00b0C for 30 mins and 94\u00b0C for 3 mins. 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min (45 cycles); and 72\u00b0C for 10 mins. a logistical regression model was used to detect the relationship between the examined variants and retroviral infection status. s were assembled using the E-INS-i method of the online software MAFFT version 7,48 and aligned against available FIV genomes downloaded from GenBank. maximum likelihood analyses were carried out using the Tamura-Nei model with 1000 bootstrap replicates and gamma distribution. free water and 1 l template DNA were mixed together for each sample. 95\u00b0C for 15 mins, 60\u00b0C for 45 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. 72\u00b0C for 10 mins. phylogenetic analysis In FIV-positive cases, partial proviral pol genes were amplified with the previously described protocol of Adams et al. 47 PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis. amplicons of 576 bp length were cut out manually and purified by a Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) 136 cats were found to be clinically healthy during the physical examination. only 98 (29.3%) were immunised at some point of their life-span. among these cats, only 39 (11.6%) were vaccinated against FeLV. cross-compliance was analysed by calculating Cohen\u2019s coefficient. this coefficient was 0.786 (95% CI 0.68\u20130.87) for FeLV (P 0.05) and 0.816 (95% CI 0.72\u20130.9) for FIV (P 0.05) both results indicate a significant coherence between the Witness ELISA and PCR results. all of the strains were clustered into subtype B (acc. number: KY629414.1) within this \u2018Hungarian\u2019 cluster, the strains formed several subgroups of closely related sequences that mostly reflected the geographic location of their origin. 77.0% of cats had outdoor access and most of them were not neutered. previous publications and our statistics show a higher occurence of retro-viral infection in intact (usually male) outdoor cats. a negative ELISA and positive PCR result can also suggest an early phase of infection or illness in a regressive stage. the monophyletic pattern suggests a common ancestor for all the sequenced samples belonged to subtype B. inactivated whole virus subtypes A and D will not confer protective effect against subtype B.21,56."}
