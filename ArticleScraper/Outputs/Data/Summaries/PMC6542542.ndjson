{"summary": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been developed as a live recombinant expression vector. it is widely used for making candidate vaccines against unrelated pathogens. concerns regarding safety led to interest in more attenuated poxvirus vectors including fowlpox virus [6] and canarypox virus [7, 8]. 71 orthologous ORFs predicted to encode identical gene products. the remaining 124 ORFs encode gene products with amino acid changes. loss or truncation of 31 open reading frames totaling 25 kbp of DNA from the parental virus was insufficient to produce the host-range phenotype of MVA. v44/47.1 and v51.1 replicate well in human MRC-5, HeLa and pig kidney 15 cells. there has been only a limited investigation of how the HRE MVAs overcome the host range restriction. however, introduction of the K1L gene into MVA did not reverse the human host-range defect. i screen implicated three genes (IRF2, FAM111A and RFC3) in the restriction of SPI-1 deletion mutants in human A549 cells. the primary intent of the present study was to identify specific genes lost during the passage history of MVA that contribute to its host-range defect. earliest recognized defect in MVA replication occurs during morphogenesis. second exception to the general rule for the predominance of impaired gene expression is the morphogenesis defect of SPI-1 deletion mutants of rabbitpox virus and the WR strain of VACV in non-permissive cells. bViruses are named according to the cosmid or cosmid used for marker rescue. bViruses are named according to the cosmid or cosmid used for marker rescue. the recombinant virus, named MVA-SPI-1, was clonally isolated by several rounds of picking foci that fluoresce due to co-expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed to confirm insertion of the complete C12L ORF. after 48 h, the overlay was removed and cells were stained with antibody to VACV. deletion of the SPI-1 gene from HRE MVAs reduces replication in human cells. loss of SPI-1 by v51.2 had a greater impact than gain of SPI-1 by MVA particularly in A549 cells. we also compared effects of SPI-1 deletions on other independently isolated HRE MVAs (v51.1, v44.1 and v44/47.1) MRC-5 cells were infected with indicated viruses at a MOI of 0.001 (MRC-5) or 0.01 (A549) cells for 48 h. absence of SPI-1 strongly contributes to the host-range defect of MVA. expression of SPI-1 by MVA and HRE MVAs enhanced replication in human cells. however, viral genome alterations could have unanticipated effects. ectopic expression of SPI-1 would have little or no effect on replication. A549 and MRC-5 cells were infected at a MOI of 0.01 in control. titers were determined in duplicate on CEF. error bars represent SEM and fold difference in titers are indicated. v51.2, v51.1, v44.1 and v44/47.1 HRE MVAs each replicated more than 3 logs higher than the parental MVA in MRC-5 cells. however, even after deletion of C12L they still replicated at least one log higher than MVA suggesting the presence of one or more additional host range genes. our strategy was to delete these genes from v51.2SPI-1 to see if that further reduced virus spread in MRC-5 and A549 cells but not CEF. Fig 6. Multiple alignment of genome sequences of the left ends of MVA and HRE MVAs. replication of v51.2 was diminished to the same extent by deletion of SPI-1 alone and deletion of both SPI-1 and C15L, C16L or C17L. deletion of C10L or C11R from v51.2 or v51.2SPI had no effect on virus spread in CEF or MRC-5 cells. earliest recognized defect in MVA replication occurs during morphogenesis. second exception to the general rule for the predominance of impaired gene expression is the morphogenesis defect of SPI-1 deletion mutants of rabbitpox virus and the WR strain of VACV. bViruses are named according to the cosmid or cosmids used for marker rescue. bViruses are named according to the cosmid or cosmids used for marker rescue. recombination occurred into the site of deletion III located near the right end of MVA. permissive CEF were used for infection and transfection. the recombinant virus, named MVA-SPI-1, was clonally isolated by several rounds of picking foci that fluoresce due to co-expression of the green fluorescent protein. effect of addition of the SPI-1 gene to MVA was less than in BS-C-1 and MRC-5 cells. after 48 h, the overlay was removed and cells were stained with antibody to VACV. deletion of the gene from HRE MVAs reduces replication in human cells. in BS-C-1 cells, the foci formed by v51.2SPI-1 stained less intensely than those formed by the parent virus v51.2. a comparison of Fig 2A and 2B suggested that loss of SPI-1 by v51.2 had a greater impact than gain of SPI-1 by MVA particularly in A549 cells. MRC-5 cells were infected with indicated viruses at a MOI of 0.001 (MRC-5) or 0.01 (A549) cells for 48 h. both effects were much smaller than in MRC-5 cells. absence of SPI-1 strongly contributes to the host-range defect of MVA. expression of SPI-1 by MVA and HRE MVAs enhanced replication in human cells. however, viral genome alterations could have unanticipated effects. expression of SPI-1 was demonstrated by Western blotting. retroviruses express 2xMyc-SPI-1 or control retroviruses. the minor Myc band in panel C is assumed to be due to degradation. A549 and MRC-5 cells were infected in triplicate for 48 h. v51.2, v51.1, v44.1 and v44/47.1 HRE MVAs each replicated more than 3 logs higher than the parental MVA in MRC-5 cells. however, even after deletion of C12L they replicated at least one log higher than MVA suggesting the presence of one or more additional host range genes. the genetic changes in v51.2, concentrated around deletion I, were present in each of the HRE MVAs capable of replicating in human cells. our strategy was to delete these genes from v51.2SPI-1 to see if that further reduced virus spread. replication of v51.2 was diminished to the same extent by deletion of SPI-1 alone and deletion of both SPI-1 and either C15L, C16L or C17L. deletion of C10L or C11R from v51.2 or v51.2SPI had no effect on virus spread in MRC-5 cells. deletion of SPI-1 located within the repaired deletion I segment of v51.2 restricted the host range of MVAs. deletion of the SPI-1 gene from an HRE MVA had a strong negative effect in human cell lines. expression of SPI-1 is necessary for enhanced replication of MVA in MRC-5 and MRC-5 cells. the host-range function of RPXV SPI-1 in pig kidney and human A549 cells is abolished by mutation of the tryptophan to alanine in the predicted reactive loop. this difference could be due to the presence of additional host factors that inhibit MVA.
