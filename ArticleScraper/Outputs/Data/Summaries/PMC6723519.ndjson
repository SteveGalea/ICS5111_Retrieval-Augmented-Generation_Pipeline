{"summary": "autoimmune diseases (AID) develop as a result of aberrant immune response in recognizing self and non-self-antigens. etiologies of several autoimmune disorders remain completely understood. multiple factors have been linked to autoimmune responses, including genetics, age, environment. both molecular mimicry and bystander activation have been observed in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis [11], west Nile virus (WNV)-mediated myasthenia gravis [12], TMEV-IDD [13], and other disorders [9]. Moreover, viruses may immortalize autoreactive effector cells as observed in Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells [14]. enteroviruses are considered the main viral candidates for causing type 1 diabetes in humans [15]. Seasonal incidence of type 1 diabetes has been reported subsequent to enterovirus infections since 1969 [16,17] a higher frequency of enterovirus infections has been reported among siblings who develop type 1 diabetes as compared to nondiabetic controls. a post-mortem examination of a deceased diabetic child revealed the death of beta cells and the presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate in the pancreas of Langerhans. the virus was able to infect beta cells originating from non-diabetic donors, leading to beta cell functional impairment and strong natural Killer (NK) cells-mediated inflammation [31]. the molecular basis of autoimmunity in CVB4 infection is proposed to be a molecular mimicry [35]. the 2C non-structural CVB protein has a shared sequence with the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 enzyme (GAD65), which is predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta cells. this result aligns with previous studies that have investigated the immunological cross-reactivity caused by sequence similarity between self- and non-self-antigens. virus infection was found to be protective through enhancing Treg cells in individuals who are genetically susceptible to type 1 diabetes but not insulitis. however, it is yet to be determined how often CVB can induce autoimmunity, and what are the factors that contribute to diabetes. interleukin 1 and 6, the candidate proinflammatory cytokines, suppress Treg functionality allowing unchecked adaptive autoimmune response. rotavirus acceleration of diabetes is strain-specific, as infection of mice with RRV but not the CRW-8 has enhanced disease development. pane et al. proposed that diabetes acceleration by rotavirus in NOD mice occur via bystander activation. influenza viruses are able to grow in human pancreatic cell lines in vitro. they can also replicate in pancreatic cells from both, exocrine and endocrine origins. the virus can also find its way to the pancreas through reflux from the gut to the pancreatic duct. studies have linked IAVs to diabetes, but their exact role in disease prognosis and pathogenies is yet to be explored. a number of studies have associated influenza infection or vaccination to type 1 narcolepsy. a chronic sleep disorder associated with autoimmune destruction of hypocretin (HCRT) neurons in the hypothalamus is linked to the HLA-DQB1*0602/DQA1*01:02 haplotype, T cell receptors (TCR) and other immune loci. this suggests the involvement of autoimmune response in the disease pathophysiology. specific influenza sequences may explain how influenza infection or vaccine trigger T1N autoimmunity. these findings also suggested the possible involvement of antigen spreading and CD8+ T-cells killing of HCRT neurons leading to this disorder. in diabetes, the contribution of T cells bystander activation and direct beta cell damage are strongly supported. ers of anti-early antigen (EA) IgG and IgA were found in SLE patients compared to healthy EBV carriers. increased EBV viral load, high titers of EBV antibodies, and abnormal cell-mediated immunity to EBV have also been observed in RA, SS, and SS patients. herpesviruses-triggered MS can be mediated through direct lyses of CNS cells or by the immunopathogenic host immune responses, increasing the pool of CNS specific self-antigens. human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was found to be more prevalent in MS plaques than normal MS white matter. anti-CMV, EBV, and or HSV-1 IgG levels were found to be lower in CD patients compared to healthy controls. the protective role of infections in autoimmunity supports the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d which proposes cleaner living environment leads to higher incidence of autoimmune disorders. viral infections, including infections produced by CMV and EBV, can cause apoptosis of the immune cells. molecular mimicry and bystander activation were reported in EBV- and HSV-induced autoimmunity. other Viruses Infections with multiple other viruses have been linked to autoimmune disorders. peptide sharing analysis of five common viruses revealed massive viral human peptide cross-reactivity. the author explained this finding in light of the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis. the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis describes the first eukaryotic cell had evolved from an archaeal ancestor of the eukaryotic cytoplasm. there is no single factor responsible for triggering autoimmunity. it seems that the development of autoimmune diseases following viral infections is a multifactorial process that can be affected by different variables. human herpes virus 6A (HHV-6A) Homo sapiens - Caselli et al., 2017 [107] Encephalitis (Human herpes encephalitis) Herpes simplex virus Homo sapiens Molecular mimicry Armangue et al., 2014 [109] Encephalitis, myasthenia gravis Japenese encephalitis virus Mus musculus Molecular mimicry He et al.

NK cells-mediated inflammation could be attributed to the high expression of type-I interferon (IFN-1) in beta cells following CVB infection, which leads to rapid beta cell death [32]. age seems to play a significant role in the development of virus-induced diabetes. mice have indicated that by evoking beta cells damage, CVB4 infection promotes the release of self-antigens. bystander activation was also a suggested mechanism by which CVB4 induce or accelerate diabetes. studies of rhesus monkey rotavirus (RRV) infection in NOD mice indicated that RRV can induce diabetes without pancreatic infection. rotavirus acceleration of diabetes is strain-specific, as infection of mice with RRV but not the CRW-8 has enhanced disease development. viral-induced diabetes can occur through nonspecific mechanisms without pancreatic viral infection, e.g., proinflammatory cytokine response and lymphocyte activation. rotavirus-associated protein 5 (MDA5) may also have a role in diabetes progression. diabetic ketoacidosis was documented in a young woman after H1N1 infection. in another case, a patient converted from type 2 to type 1 diabetes after influenza A virus infection in 2009 in japan. this patient developed deterioration of glycemic control after the infection. studies have linked IAVs to diabetes, but their exact role in disease prognosis and pathogenies is yet to be explored. in situ hybridization experiments of pancreatic tissue after infection with influenza virus have indicated that viral nucleoprotein was detected in beta cells, with reduction in the number of cells staining for insulin. this clearly suggests the potential effect of influenza replication on beta cells damage and insulin levels, leading to diabetes. Molecular mimicry of IAV antigens has been strongly suggested in T1N. a similarity between H1N1 specific peptides and HCRT peptides was reported. cross-reactivity between HCRT autoantigen and specific influenza sequences might explain how influenza infection or vaccine trigger T1N autoimmunity. herpesviruses persist in the host as a latent infection. when reactivated contribute to disease pathogenesis as observed in systemic autoimmune diseases. high viral loads of EBV DNA were detected in the blood of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients compared to healthy EBV carriers. some EBV proteins that are important in immune evasion and anti-apoptosis are homologues to cellular proteins such as Bcl2. this prevents both infected B cells and epithelial cells from apoptosis. this leads to a loss of tolerance and development of autoimmunity. cytomegalovirus (CMV) genome in type 1 diabetes patients. gastrointestinal and herpes viral infections have been linked to the induction of celiac disease (CD), which is a life-long autoimmune disorder. some infections are able to shift the immune response from Th1 to Th2, establishing an immunosuppressive state in Th1-derived immune diseases, such as CD [80]. helminths modulate the immune system and generate a Th2 environment, which protects from autoimmune diseases or relieve symptoms of established autoimmune inflammation. both viruses result in CNS demyelination disease [64]. autoimmune disorders include the recently reported ZIKV-induced Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and DENV-induced SLE and lupus nephritis. antiviral immune response cross-react with human NMDA receptors. the author explained this finding in the light of the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis. the first eukaryotic cell had evolved from an archaeal ancestor of the eukaryotic cytoplasm, a bacterial ancestor of the mitochondria, and a viral ancestor of the nucleus. it is clear that there is no single factor responsible for triggering autoimmunity. autoimmune demyelinating disease Semliki forest virus Mus musculus - Mokhtarian et al., 2012 [102] Autoimmune encephalitis Herpes simplex virus Homo sapiens Molecular mimicry Bradshaw et al., 2015 [103] Autoimmune hepatitis Esptein\u2013Barr virus Homo sapiens Molecular mimicry Cabibi et al., 2008 [104] Autoi autoimmunity Enteroviruses Homo sapiens Molecular mimicry Honkanen et al., 2017 [119] Multiple sclerosis Theiler\u2019s virus Homo sapiens - Miller et al., 2001 [122] Multiple sclerosis Varicella-zoster virus Homo sapiens - Sotelo and Corona, 2011 [123] Multiple sclerosis Cytomegalovirus Homo sapiens Molecular mimicry Vanheusden human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Homo sapiens - Bangham et al., 2015 [127] Polyarthritis Hepatitis C virus Homo sapiens - Zuckerman et al., 2000 [128] Pulmonary Fibrosis Gammaherpesvirus Mus musculus - Bennion et al., 2019 [129] Rheumatoid arthritis Esptein\u2013Barr virus Homo systemic lupus erythematous, lupus nephritis Dengue virus Homo sapiens Epitope spreading Steed and Stappenbeck, 2014 [139] Systemic Vasculitis Lassa Virus Cynomolgus Macaques - Cashman et al., 2018 [141] TMEV-induced demyelinating disease Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus Mus musculus Molecular a growing evidence is supporting the protective role of viruses against autoimmunity. viral infections lead to the activation of regulatory immune responses. this dual effect of viral infections on autoimmunity is orchestrated by different host, viral and environmental factors."}
