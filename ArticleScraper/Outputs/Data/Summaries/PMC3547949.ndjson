{"summary": "eukaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of critical modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins. the cap structure found at the 5\u2032 end of eukaryotic mRNAs is critical for the splicing of the cap-proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation efficiency of mRNAs. a bifunctional RNA capping enzyme catalyzes both the RTase and GTase reactions through distinct domains. a separate polypeptide mediates the subsequent N-7 methylation. mRNA capping is a rapid, dynamic, and regulated co-transcriptional process that is subjected to quality control. the rate-limiting activity of the capping apparatus is the two-step ping-pong GTase activity. the first step of the reaction is initiated by the binding of GTP to the open form of the enzyme followed by the closure of the OB fold domain and the N-terminal nucleotidyl transferase domain. foscarnet, an antiviral drug that targets the DNA polymerase of human cytomegalovirus, is a potent inhibitor of the GTase reaction. the intracellular triphosphorylated form of ribavirin can also inhibit the activity of viral GTases. the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) with the concomitant reduction of NAD via a covalent intermediate (E-XMP) this conversion has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. an aliquot of the purified HCE protein (P) was analyzed by electrophoresis. a 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA and [-32P]GTP were incubated in presence of HCE in a buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2. the pET28a plasmid is fused in frame with an N-terminal 6-His tag. expression of the protein is driven by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm. the fraction was dialyzed against buffer C [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. amino acids 1\u2013219 corresponding to HCE RTase domain (HCE-T1\u2013219) and 229\u2013597 corresponding to HCE GTase domain (HCE-G229\u2013597) were also mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 1 M of Cet1, and 5 nmoles of the 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA were incubated for 30 min at 30\u00b0C. the RNA substrate was quantified by spectrophotometry and stored at 20\u00b0C. RNA Guanylyltransferase Assay GTase assays were conducted as described in the \u201ccapping of a 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA\u201d section. a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA was used as a substrate. a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA was used as a substrate. GMP Transfer on a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA Formation of the enzyme-GMP complex was initially performed for 15 min at 37\u00b0C in a buffer containing 1.5 M [-32P]GTP, 1 M HCE, 70 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 70 M DTT, 0.7 ng/l pyrophosphatase (Roche) the reaction pH was adjusted to 5.2 with 50 mM NaOAc followed by the addition of 5 g of Nuclease P1 and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. the digestion were further adjusted with 50 mM Tris-HCl to pH 8.0. the reaction products were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) the protein were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. the membrane was blocked and incubated overnight with either 11000 anti-HA (HA-probe), 11000 anti-GFP (G1546, Sigma-Aldrich) or 110000 anti-Actin (-Actin Antibody #4967, Cell Signaling) primary monoclonal antibody followed by 1 h incubation with 15000 HRP-anti the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer. the soluble extract was applied to a nickelnitrilotriacetic acidagarose column. the 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA substrate was purified on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ultraviolet shadowing. the corresponding band was excised and then eluted from the gel by an overnight incubation in 0.1% SDS and 0.5 M ammonium acetate. radiolabeled RNA substrates were also synthesized by adding radiolabeled nucleotides to the transcription reaction. DTT, 0.5 ng/l pyrophosphatase (Roche) and 1 U of RNAse Out (Invitrogen) were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 l of phenol-chloroform. 10 l of loading dye (97% formamide) was added to the aqueous phase. enzyme-GMP complex formation assays were carried out for 3 min at 37\u00b0C in a buffer containing 1 M [-32P]GTP, 4 M HCE, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 500 M DTT, 0.5 ng/l pyrophosphatase (Roche) the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 l of loading dye (50 mM EDTA, 2% -mer the transfer reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 l of phenol-chloroform. 10 l of loading dye (97% formamide) was added to the aqueous phase. the formation of the 32P-radiolabeled GpppRNA was quantified with a PhosphorImager. cell were transfected with either pCDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) or pCDNA3.1+ construct. at 24 h mizoribine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0, 40, or 120 M. a bifunctional enzyme harbors the RTase and GTase activity on the same peptide. a hexa-histidine tagged full-length bifunctional HCE protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography. the 69-kDa HCE protein was the predominant polypeptide in the purified fraction. ZP inhibited the reaction with an IC50 of 150 M. the reaction was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of GMP. concentrations as high as 10 mM did not reduce the RNA capping by more than 25%. formation of radiolabeled RNA products was analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified by autoradiography. formation of HCE-GMP complex, the first step of GTase activity, is inhibited to a lesser extent then the complete GTase reaction by MZP. two-step reaction involves formation of a covalent EpG intermediate upon GTP hydrolysis, followed by the transfer of this GMP moiety onto a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA. a concentration of 80 M MZP resulted in a 50% decrease in the formation of the radiolabeled capped RNA. 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA was capped with HCE, HCE-G229\u2013597, D1R, A103R or Ceg1 GTases. GTases from human, vaccinia virus, Chlorella virus or S. cerevisiae were allowed to form enzyme-GMP covalent complex. the formation of the EpG complex in single turnover condition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by phosphorimaging. increasing concentrations of MZP only prevented formation of the EpG complex at elevated concentrations of MZP; a concentration of 3 mM MZP resulted in a 50% inhibition of the HCE-GMP complex formation. this inhibition is not due to magnesium cofactor sequestration since the addition of an equimolar concentrations of MgCl the formation of GpppRNA structure or the EpG covalent complex was monitored as a function of GTP concentration in the presence of increasing concentrations of MZP. the MZP concentration had no impact on the maximum velocity of the EpG formation (GTase first step), which suggested a competitive mechanism of inhibition. the global inhibition seems to be non-competitive. mammalian vaccinia virus (IC50 = 500 M), the Chlorella virus (IC50 = 750 M), and the yeast S. cerevisiae (IC50>2 mM) both the human and vaccinia virus GTase (HCE and D1R) had IC50 values of 3 mM, the Chlorella virus GTase (A103R) presented an IC50 of 2 mM. the reporter gene has a half-life of 9 hours, and is translated 40 times per hour to yield an average of 500\u20131000 proteins over its life span. this gives nearly 3 orders of magnitude of amplification over every capping event and provides a very sensitive assay. the translation of the reporter gene was partially rescued only in cells over-expressing HCE-WT-HA. zoribine, the cells over-expressing HCE-WT-HA maintained a significantly higher reporter gene translation rate compared to all the other cell lines that did not harbor a functional capping apparatus. luciferase intensity, as a mesure of efficient capping of the reporter protein mRNA, was normalized for untreated cells and plotted against mizoribine concentration. a hexa-histidine tagged full-length bifunctional HCE protein was expressed in coli. the 69-kDa HCE protein was the predominant polypeptide in the purified fraction. the full-length HCE was also shown to sequentially hydrolyze the -phosphate from the RNA substrate and transfer the GMP moiety onto the newly 5\u2032-diphosphorylated RNA to form the GpppRNA cap structure. MZP does not inhibit the RTase activity. concentrations as high as 10 mM did not reduce the RNA capping by more than 25%. RTase activity was monitored through the analysis of the 32Pi product. e reaction by MZP was incubated with [-32P]GTP to allow EpG formation. a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA and increasing concentration of MZP were next added to the reaction. phosphate RNA was capped with a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA, [-32P]GTP, magnesium, pyrophosphatase and various concentrations of MZP. a concentration of 80 M MZP resulted in a 50% decrease in the formation of the radiolabeled capped RNA. the GTases from human, vaccinia virus, Chlorella virus or S. cerevisiae were allowed to form enzyme-GMP covalent complex in presence of increasing concentration of MZP. amino acids alignment of the human (HCE), S. cerevisiae (Ceg1), C. albicans and Chlorella virus (A103R) GTases harbor similar three-dimensional architecture. the formation of the EpG covalent complex in single turnover condition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by phosphorimaging. increasing concentrations of MZP only prevented formation of the EpG complex at elevated concentrations of MZP; a concentration of 3 mM MZP resulted in a 50% inhibition of the HCE-GMP complex formation. this inhibition is not due to magnesium cofactor sequestration since the addition of an equimolar concentrations of Mg compared to the HCE (IC50 = 80 M), the other GTases showed reduced susceptibility to MZP inhibition for the complete GTase reaction. this difference ranges from 5- to 25-fold for the GTase from the mammalian vaccinia virus (IC50 = 500 M), the Chlorella virus (IC50 = 750 M), and the yeast S. cerevisiae (IC50>2 mM). both the human and vaccinia virus GTase (HCE and D1R) had IC50 values of 3 mM. the Chlorella virus GTase (A103R) presented an IC50 of 2 mM. the yeast GTase (Ceg1) seemed slightly less affected by MZP. this raises the possibility that a conformational change hindrance could be the mechanism of action by which MZP inhibits HCE. induced by MZP, we chose four identical human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cell lines, diverging only by the over-expression (or not) of HCE-WT-HA, HCE-K294A-HA or GFP protein. both the activity and the stability of the reporter gene (firefly luciferase) are not influenced by high concentration of HCE. in cellulo mizoribine capping inhibition is rescued by HCE over-expression. luciferase intensity, as a mesure of efficient capping of reporter protein mRNA, was normalized for untreated cells and plotted against mizoribine concentration. RTase activity appears to be relatively unaffected while the GTase activity is inhibited, indicating that the GTase activity is the main target of MZP inhibition. the inhibition of the complete GTase reaction by MZP could not be explained completely. complete GTase catalytic round does not only imply the formation of the EpG intermediate complex and the transfer of the GMP moiety to an acceptor RNA. MZP could bind HCE and block this conformational change, possibly through stabilization of the closed conformation, thereby preventing the reopening of the protein upon GTP hydrolysis. a molecular docking experiment of MZP on the GTase domain from HCE. the lack of RTase domain, which is predicted to participate in MZP binding, does not allow for definitive conclusions to be reached. the lack of RTase domain, which is predicted to participate in MZP binding, does not allow for definitive conclusions to be reached. the RTase harbors a higher turnover rate than the GTase, which catalyzes the limiting step in RNA capping [15]. Historically, very few GTase inhibitors have been developed, neither as scientific tools nor as therapeutic agents. the current study identifies MZP as a novel allosteric GTase inhibitor. cellular protein levels are not only dictated by capping efficiency, we selected a cellular model where all variables unrelated to capping were constant. all cell lines treated with mizoribine showed a global reduction in reporter protein expression when compared with untreated cells. this expected effect is likely due to partial guanosine pool depletion induced by IMPDH inhibition. mizoribine monophosphate inhibits the human RNA guanylyltransferase in vitro and impairs mRNA capping in cellulo. the therapeutic agent mizoribine monophosphate inhibits the human RNA guanylyltransferase in vitro and impairs mRNA capping in cellulo. 32Pi product was separated from RNA substrate by polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate and quantified by autoradiography. a 5\u2032-diphosphate acceptor RNA was incubated with [-32P]GTP, 0.1 M of either HCE-WT or HCE-C126S and increasing concentrations of MZP. luciferase luminescence was quantified according to manufacturer instruction (Promega) luciferase intensity was normalized to the cellular extract expressing the firefly luciferase alone. docking simulations were performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) and the Solis & Wets local search method (26) each docking experiment was derived from 100 different runs that were set to terminate after a maximum of 2,500,000 energy evaluations."}
