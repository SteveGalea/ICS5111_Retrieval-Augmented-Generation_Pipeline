{"summary": "the high seroprevalence of herpes virus type-5 or cytomegalovirus constitutes a major public health concern due to possible sequelae in the fetus and newborn. infection is usually asymptomatic or can have a flu-type presentation except when transmitted from mother to fetus. no study has hitherto examined the impact of the virus on olfaction. it is plausible that CMV induces behavioral changes resulting from olfactory defects. olfaction is the first sensory modality to develop during fetal life in mammals. virus-infected mice display olfactory deficits long before auditory deficits. mice were housed in isolators and manipulated in safety cabinets. mice (total n = 81) were divided in two groups, control (CTL) and CMV-infected mice (CMV) following in utero intraplacental inoculation. experimental set 1 studied the impact of congenital CMV infection on growth, olfaction, olfactory epithelium (OE), OB, and subventricular zone (SVZ) of preweaning mice. 8-postnatal day-old mice were injected with saline only. outliers were identified by ROUT. variables between the CTL and CMV groups without outliers are different. ultrasonic emission responses were recorded during the first period without odorant (1 min) followed by a period of odorant exposure (1 min) and finally the last period of exhaust odorant (1 min and 30 s). p-values were calculated by Mann\u2013Whitney test (E), or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed\u2013rank test (H, I) apoptotic Casp3+, OSN, macrophages, microglia, Ki67+ neural progenitor cells, TH+, CB+ and CR+ cells were extracted from the OB of CTL and congenital CMV-infected mice at W3. the levels of Casp3, Iba, CD68, Beclin1, phospho-AMPK, Atg5, p62, LC3 I/II, LAMP, phospho experimental set 2 studied the impact of congenital CMV infection on hearing, olfaction, OB, and SVZ of weaning mice. the presence of CMV nucleic acids was assessed by PCR in all the mice at W3 in saliva samples. olfactometer isolator comprises an odorant sampling port and a water delivery tube to reward mice. results are percentage of mice that did not find the food over a 15 min period. n = 8 CMV, n = 11 CTL. the mixture ratio of isoamylacetate and anethol is indicated on the graph. mice were trained during 5 consecutive days to recall distinguishing d-limonene and anethol. results in A, B, and F are expressed as the mean SEM of correct response. glomerulus size (D) at W16 after birth following congenital CMV inoculation. for cell density analysis, n = 5 male CTL, n = 2 female CTL, n = 4 male CMV, n = 4 female CMV, n = 4 female CMV. results in D are shown as mean SEM. template DNA was prepared by a series of phenol\u2013chloroform extractions. 1 l of sample DNA was added to the reaction mixture before amplification. the DNA reaction mixture was then amplified as follows. needle electrodes were placed subcutaneously under anesthesia with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (4 mg/kg) headphones with appropriate earplugs were used as acoustic transducers. click intensity was reduced by 20 or 10 dB steps sound pressure level (SPL) and then by 5 dB steps near threshold. ultrasonic calls were recorded during the 5 min isolation time of the pup into the olfactometer during three successive test periods. the first period without any odorant (1 min), the second period with exposure to social or nonsocial odorant (1 min and 30 s) the social odorant was a male scent delivered from 10 ml of liquid 10% mineral oil dilution of citral. each series of 20 trials (block) comprised 10 presentations of the rewarded odorant. a single stimulus (S+ or S) was randomly presented at each trial. a licking response following an S+ trial and no licking following an S+ trial were scored as correct and called hit and correct rejection. d-limonene (dilution 102 in mineral oil, S+) and citronellal (dilution 102 in mineral oil, S+) were trained to discriminate between: (1) d-limonene (dilution 102 in mineral oil, S+) and anethol (dilution 102 in mineral oil, S+) and (3) 0.1% isoamylacetate (dilution 103 in water, S+) and anethol ( mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p., Sanofi) and perfused transcardially with a solution containing 0.9% NaCl and heparin.

CTL pups decreased their emission of calls in response to exposure to nonsocial or social odorant molecules such as citral or male scent. in contrast, congenital CMV infection impaired the ultrasonic call responses triggered by the two scents. Figure 2, E and G, reveals olfactory dysfunction as seen by the lack of inhibition of ultravocalizations. matched-pairs signed\u2013rank test, p > 0.99, n = 11 CMV. we assessed olfactory-driven behavior of infected mice at W16. mice exhibited impaired food search but not when food was made visible. -butanol and its water solvent (CMV vs CTL: block number to criterion: Gehan\u2013Breslow\u2013Wilcoxon test, 2 = 8.945, p = 0.028, n = 11 male CTL, n = 8 male CMV) congenital CMV infection dramatically impairs odorant detection in neonate as well in adult mice. in the difficult discrimination task of isoamylacetate\u2013anethol mixtures, the 6/4 versus 4/6 mixtures could not be correctly discriminated by CTL and CMV-infected mice. even when infected mice successfully completed two-odorant discrimination tasks in easy problems, they needed more trials than CTL to learn to discriminate between isoamylacetate and anethol. olfactory memory suggests no differences between CMV-infected and CTL mice. these data indicate that CMV-inoculated mice exhibit poorer odorant detection and olfactory discrimination. the OB circuit constitutes the first central relay station of the olfactory system. the OB hosts a large population of resident microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the brain. OB microglial cells can be activated in response to pathological tissue changes, thus migrating to the site of injury, where they proliferate and acquire new functions. congenital CMV infection causes fetal infection and leads to viral expression in the OB at W3 that is accompanied by increased apoptosis and inflammation. the level of neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the OB of CMV-infected mice prompted us to investigate whether infection and inflammation disrupted normal OB development. the increase in cell apoptosis induced by CMV infection could lead to substantial changes in neuronal subpopulations. we subsequently assessed whether the increase in cell apoptosis induced by CMV infection could lead to substantial changes in neuronal subpopulations by visualizing CB-, calretinin (CR)-, and TH-positive cells. the SVZ provides the postnatal OB with interneurons throughout its lifespan in rodents. this area gives rise to thousands of neuroblasts per day that migrate via the RMS toward the OB. this area gives rise to thousands of neuroblasts per day that migrate via the RMS toward the OB. glomerulus area: CMV vs CTL; Mann\u2013Whitney test, U(6) = 0, p = 0.0286, n = 4 CTL (409 glomeruli), n = 4 CMV (304 glomeruli). however, no correlation was found between body and brain weight for each group. preweaning male mice exhibit OB proportionate and disproportionate developmental abnormalities, neuroinflammation, and fewer bulbar interneuron cells that together might contribute to an olfactory deficit. the impact of this virus on the levels of several protein markers of autophagy in the OB at W3. the levels of autophagosome formation are particularly elevated. the dramatic increase in Beclin1 expression prompted us to investigate whether the pAMPK-activated protein kinase (pAMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway is involved. we assessed the long-term consequences for the olfactory system in adult male and female mice at W16. we found a decrease in cell proliferation in the SVZ at W16 after birth. no difference was found between males and females in either the CTL or CMV group. no difference was found between males and females in either the CTL or CMV group. the cell densities of the two other glomerular populations, CB- and CR-positive cells, are similar to CTL mice, indicating a recovery for the CB-positive cell population. this recovery might probably result from ongoing adult neurogenesis. utero intraplacental inoculation of murine CMV was performed in timed pregnant mice (E13) under deep anesthesia. this model recapitulates many features of congenital human CMV infection. we found a strong male bias at birth for both CTL and CMV groups. progressive hearing loss phenotype reminiscent of what has been reported in infants with congenital CMV infection. recordings of ABRs show age-dependent sensorineural hearing loss in CTL and CMV-infected mice. olfactometer chamber, preweaning pups aged 6\u20138 d produced ultrasonic calls that promoted mother\u2013offspring interaction. no difference in the number of emitted ultravocalizations was found between CTL and CMV-infected pups. in contrast, congenital CMV infection impaired the ultrasonic call responses triggered by the two scents. olfactory dysfunction seen by lack of inhibition of ultravocalizations when pups were exposed to citral as early as the sixth day after birth. olfactory-driven behavior of infected mice exhibited impaired hidden food search. congenitally infected mice were tested 1 month after birth using automated olfactometers. we investigated olfactory sensitivity by determining the detection threshold for n-butanol odorant. mice needed more trials to learn to distinguish between n-butanol and its water solvent. the same paradigm was used in weaning male mice for simple olfactory discrimination between two odorants and for difficult olfactory discrimination between binary mixtures of odorants. the same paradigm was used in weaning male mice for simple olfactory discrimination between two odorants and for difficult olfactory discrimination between binary mixtures of odorants. 0.033, n = 11 male CTL, n = 8 male CMV), d-Limonene and Citronellal. analysis of long-term olfactory memory suggests no differences. olfactory memory suggests no differences between CMV-infected and CTL mice. transplacental CMV inoculation causes embryo infection, neuroinvasion, and long-term viremia in the OB lasting at least 3 weeks after birth. immunohistochemistry and immunoblot experiments revealed that viral expression in the OB is accompanied by increased apoptosis. congenital CMV infection activates OB microglia, as indicated by a change in morphology. increased number of Iba1-positive cells in all OB layers. increased expression of Iba1 and CD68, markers of activated microglia. the OE was similar in shape and size to those of CTL. the number of OSNs also remained unchanged, suggesting no damage of sensory neurons. the increase in cell apoptosis induced by CMV infection could lead to substantial changes in neuronal subpopulations. a decreased population of CR-positive cells in the glomeruli of these infected mice at W3. the cell density of CR-positive cells was similar to CTL mice. the depletion of TH- and CB-positive cells observed in infected animals might reflect a direct viral tropism for this neuronal category. our anatomical investigations demonstrated that CMV OB neuroinvasion was accompanied by differential changes in the relative size of the different layers of the OB at W3. we measured the glomerulus area using OMP staining. congenital CMV infection decreased the mean size of glomeruli in infected male animals at W3. no correlation was found between body and brain weight for each group. however, no correlation was found between body and brain weight for each group. OB proportionate and disproportionate developmental abnormalities, neuroinflammation, and fewer bulbar interneuron cells that together might contribute to an olfactory deficit. LC3I to phosphatidyletholamine is a glycoprotein responsible for maintaining lysosomal integrity. however, measuring the expression of Beclin1, LC3I, LC3 II, Atg5, and LAMP1 provides a good indication of the extent of autophagy. we investigated modulation of p62 and LC3 autophagic markers involved in the autophagic flux. we found a twofold increase in p62 expression that indicates an increase in the autophagosome clearance and thus in the autophagic flux. no difference was found between males and females in either the CTL or CMV group. anatomical investigations of the OB of CMV-infected mice reveal viral expression in all layers of this structure at W16 after birth (Fig. 6A), but no proliferation or activation of local microglia. this findings indicate that, at least in our animal model, CMV placental infection leads to long-term viral infection of the embryos and transient neuroinflammation in the OB. no difference was found between males and females in either the CTL or CMV group. Conversely, the difference in the GCL size that we observed at W3 did not persist later at W16. thus, congenital CMV infection leads to long-term alteration of the OB structure, compromised cell proliferation in the SVZ, and fewer bulbar dopaminergic cells that together might contribute to the olfactory deficit. model recapitulates many features of congenital human CMV infection. this includes altered hindbrain morphogenesis, robust CNS neuroinflammation. susceptibility to CMV infection is age dependent and host maturation is associated with decreased virus replication and less severe neurological outcomes in both humans and mice. we provide experimental evidence that CMV can infect the OB following in utero transplacental inoculation. this is consistent with previous reports on rodent models and our observations in human fetuses. we also report for the first time that the OB viral infection is accompanied by increased autophagy. the upregulated autophagy might support OB apoptosis because overactive autophagy leads to a high turnover rate of organelles and proteins, thus promoting cell death. the autophagy stimulus for this effect was not investigated (Maiuri et al., 2007; Koontz et al., 2008; Cloarec et al., 2016; Brizi et al., 2017). we cannot exclude the possibility that in utero infected OSNs spread the virus to the brain. this ability, observed in all vertebrates, might allow a complete recovery of OSN inputs following viral insult in the neonate. congenital CMV infection can impair both hearing and olfaction. a recent epidemiological study reported a remarkable correlation between hearing loss and olfactory dysfunction in the Korean population after adjustment for age and sex."}
