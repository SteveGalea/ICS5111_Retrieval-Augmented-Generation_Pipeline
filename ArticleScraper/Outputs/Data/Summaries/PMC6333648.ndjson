{"summary": "the highest mortality rates from fatal pneumonia were found with RSV of 60% and AdV of 75%. these infections contribute to morbidity and mortality for a number of reasons. URI has been commonly defined as laboratory-confirmed viral nasal wash or swab with pharyngitis, cough, otitis, nasal discharge and/or congestion in the absence of infiltrates on chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan and hypoxemia. URI has been defined as laboratory-confirmed viral nasal wash or swab in the presence of infiltrates on chest x-ray or computed adenovirus Adenovirus is a member of the adenoviridae that circulates throughout the year. along with conjunctivitis and diarrhea, AdV can cause pharyngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia but also lethal hepatitis. human bocavirus is a human pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections in infants. it has been assigned to the parvoviridae and received its name because of sequence homology to two other members in the genus Bocaparvovirus. HBoV1 exhibits a stronger association with LRI than enteritis. in immunocompromised patients a median shedding time of 50 days has been reported. this long shedding period might lead to more severe disease in immunocompromised children. HBoV does not exhibit seasonality and thus remains a threat throughout the year. shedding in the upper respiratory tract was determined in a cohort of 44 patients. 31 samples were analyzed shown to contain evidence of HCoV-OC43 (35%), HCoV-NL63 (32%), HCoV-HKU1 (19%), and HCoV-229E (13%) infection. myxoviridae member exhibits high genomic variability due to an absence of proofreading activity in its RNA. the strain of IFV impacts on severity, depending on circulating strains. individuals with compromised immune system are at increased risk of complications and death. potential risk factors that might result in LRI are lymphopenia and neutropenia as well as increased age (>65 years) while steroid use is unclear. in immunocompetent individuals, HMPV causes symptomatic URI and LRI predominantly in children or adults above 65 years of age. it has been reported that disease is more severe in case of a RSV co-infection but these data are considered controversial. risk factors for mortality include length between HCT and infection; neutropenia, lymphopenia, low monocyte count at diagnosis; and a steroid dose before diagnosis of 1 mg/kg. the presence of co-pathogens contributed to higher risk. 20\u201340% of patients who experience URI, infection progresses to LRI with a median time of 78 days. mortality is around 10% after PIV infection but increases to 27% if infection progresses to LRI. risk factors for progression to LRI include advanced age, lymphopenia, myeloablative regimen, steroid use, GvHD and pre-engraftment infection. smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation with 1200\u20131575 cGy and specifically an absolute lymphocyte count 100/mm3 at URI onset were significantly associated with progression. URI to LRI should help identify patients who might profit from antiviral therapy such as aerosolized ribavirin. this index is based on age, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, acute or chronic GvHD, myeloablative conditioning, corticosteroid use and time of infection. symptomatic RhV infections occur in 10\u201330% of HCT recipients. adenovirus Adenovirus is a member of the adenoviridae that circulates throughout the year. along with conjunctivitis and diarrhea, AdV can cause pharyngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia but also lethal hepatitis. in adult patients, AdV infections are less commonly reported. HBoV1 exhibits a stronger association with LRI than enteritis. symptoms include cough, dyspnea, pharyngitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea. a median shedding time of 50 days has been reported for immunocompetent children. annually HCoV are responsible for 15\u201330% of URI with pharyngitis and rhinitis in immunocompetent hosts. however, the emergence of SARS-CoV along with two further HCoV has expanded the family. genomic approaches investigated whether viral genome evolution could identify genetic changes associated with prolonged shedding. single nucleotide polymorphisms could not be identified until day thirty after the onset of viral shedding. however, overt viral genome changes might occur at a later time point, and changes in genome composition might result in a modification of the treatment strategy. IFV shedding in HCT patients has been reported to be prolonged with a median of 12 days. lymphopenia correlated with the duration of shedding, and steroid use increased IFV secretion. infants may present with sepsis-like symptoms and pneumonia. a high risk score was applied if the score was between 7 and 12. patients with a high risk score had a significantly higher probability of developing LRI compared to the low risk group. in a study of 21 HCT recipients, HPMV infection was documented in the majority of patients but did not cause any symptoms or disease. in a study that included 251 episodes of URI and LRI, 16 of 22 episodes in which HPMV was detected occurred in HCT recipients. paramyxoviridae circulates throughout the year. mortality rate increased from 6 to 27% when LRI was present. no HMPV-associated risk factors for increased mortality could be identified. steroid use and co-infections with other respiratory agents, however, myeloablation and infections in the early post-transplant period were variables with unclear association. syncytial virus is a frequent pathogen in infants and children that causes URI with rhinitis and laryngitis but also bronchitis. an ISI was originally proposed to stratify RSV-infected patients into groups based on their risk of progression from URI to LRI. the index is based on age, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, acute or chronic GvHD, myeloablative conditioning, corticosteroid use and time of infection. symptomatic infections occur in 10\u201330% of HCT recipients. initial high viral loads are associated with prolonged shedding. the majority of patients (69%) shed RhV species A. asymptomatic patients with a virus detected did not exhibit higher mortality. there was no higher incidence of bronchoscopy in the symptomatic versus the asymptomatic group. any decision to delay transplant has to consider HCT factors. butyrate is an immunodulatory compound associated with microbiota. it is important in maintaining gut microbiome equilibrium as well as in controlling immune responses in organs such as the lung. the presence of butyrate-producing bacteria appears to be protective. ISI does not include co-infections as a variable, and future studies are needed to validate and compare different risk scores. the profound lymphopenia after HCT has been described as a risk factor in the study above. a problem with virus detection is a lack of standardization among assays. a large prospective study associated respiratory virus detection before transplantation with prolonged hospitalization. if any respiratory virus is identified by multiplex PCR pre-transplant, HCT should be postponed. it is important to perform useful radiologic diagnostics in symptomatic patients with suspected LRI. chest x-rays are generally not recommended because lack of sensitivity. but CT should be performed to evaluate LRI. patch consolidations of at least one centimeter or more than one segmental level were only observed in PIV infections. ground-glass opacities were identified in all CT scans when IFV was detected and were less frequently seen with PIV (detected in 71% of cases) hand hygiene is of utmost importance since nosocomial infections have occurred that must be avoided. patients with documented respiratory virus infection should be isolated with restricted contact. precautions should be taken if a patient is discharged. specific Drugs Adenovirus Adenovirus pneumonia is usually observed in AdV disseminated disease. preemptive treatment is recommended as soon as viremia is higher or equal to 1000 copies/ml coupled with lymphocyte counts below 300/mm3 and CD4 T lymphocyte counts below 25/mm3. high AdV levels in stool have also been associated with gastrointestinal AdV disease. cidofovir does not clear the virus in the absence of T cell immune reconstitution. another novel compound is CMX001 (hexadecyloxypropyl cidofovir, brincidofovir, Chimerix), an orally bioavailable lipid conjugate of cidofovir with good oral bioavailability. HBX effectively blocked in vitro replication of all AdV tested. there is no proven role for ganciclovir, foscarnet or immunoglobulin therapy in immunocompromised patients. donor lymphocyte infusions and more recently specific anti AdV cytototoxic T cells should be considered in case of AdV disease after HCT. available antivirals for IFV infections include the M2 ion channel inhibitors such as amantadine that exclusively act on IFV-A. neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) are preferred for prophylaxis and treatment of IFV infections. post exposure prophylaxis with oral oseltamivir is the current treatment of choice. high resistance rates up to 68% of IFV-A (H1N1) to oseltamivir have been reported. new agents with potential efficacy against oseltamivir-resistant viruses are being tested like inhaled laninamivir. DAS181 cleaves the Neu5Ac (2,3)-Gal and Neu5Ac (2,6)-Gal sialic acid linkages on the surface of respiratory cells that are used by IFV and PIV. the largest cohort included 16 patients after HCT, 14 of whom received DAS181 for PIV-associated pneumonia but unfortunately lacked a control group. antiviral therapy is not recommended to cure or prevent infection progression even in patients at higher risk of HMPV progression. no licensed therapeutics or vaccines exist; treatment for HMPV remains so far non-specific and mostly supportive. ribavirin is a specific risk factor that has been associated with progression to LRTI in several studies. other risk factors such as total body irradiation, smoking history, stem cell source other than peripheral blood stem cells and oxygen requirement might be considered. favipiravir is currently being tested in phase III clinical trials in the united states, Europe, and Latin America. substances targeting the viral nucleocapsid protein have been investigated. a small interfering RNA called ALN RSV01 inhibiting the synthesis of the viral nucleocapsid protein has demonstrated a benefit in phase I to IIb clinical trials. the high incidence of GvHD after DLIs limits its use in patients with previous history of GvHD. donor lymphocyte infusions were used and recommended in case of disseminated AdV infections after HCT. al T cells are either by multimers specific for a virus-derived peptide in the setting of class I HLA molecule. the second is ex vivo expansion of T cells co-cultured with antigen presenting cells pulsed, infected or transfected with viral peptide/protein/viral lysate or plasmid. adoption immune therapy has been developed and investigated in clinical trials only for AdV infections. VST infusions were not associated with acute toxicities or significant onset of GvHD. the main disadvantage of this technique is that high doses of immunosuppressive drugs and especially steroids should be avoided before infusions. multiviral (including AdV) T cell manufacturing and banking from a third-party donor is a promising strategy. in a cohort of 58 patients, 3 (5%) died of respiratory failure. LRI in the absence of URI and adenoviral infection has been described to be associated with a poorer outcome in another cohort of 166 patients with specific overall mortality of 7%. patients with documented respiratory virus infection should be isolated with restricted contact. precautions should be taken if a patient is discharged. a patient should be escorted through the outpatient clinic to avoid direct contact. patients with documented respiratory virus infection should be isolated with restricted contact. strict protection measures should be applied to visitors and healthcare workers. a patient should be escorted through the outpatient clinic to avoid direct contact with and spread to other patients. specific Drugs Adenovirus Adenovirus pneumonia is usually observed in IFV disseminated disease. preemptive treatment is recommended as soon as viremia is higher or equal to 1000 copies/ml coupled with lymphocyte counts below 300/mm3 and CD4 T lymphocyte counts below 25/mm3. high AdV levels in stool have also been associated with gastrointestinal AdV disease. cidofovir does not clear the virus in the absence of T cell immune reconstitution. another novel compound is CMX001 (hexadecyloxypropyl cidofovir, brincidofovir, Chimerix) cidofovir lacks nephrotoxicity making it an attractive alternative. there is no proven role for ganciclovir, foscarnet or immunoglobulin therapy in immunocompromised patients. donor lymphocyte infusions and more recently specific anti AdV cytototoxic T cells should be considered in case of AdV disease after HCT. antivirals for IFV infections include the M2 ion channel inhibitors. neuraminidase inhibitors are preferred for prophylaxis and treatment of IFV infections. post exposure prophylaxis with oral oseltamivir is the current treatment of choice. high resistance rates up to 68% of IFV-A (H1N1) to oseltamivir have been reported in Europe during the 2007\u20132008 winter season. new agents with potential efficacy against oseltamivir-resistant viruses are being tested. DAS181 cleaves the Neu5Ac (2,3)-Gal and Neu5Ac (2,6)-Gal sialic acid linkages on the surface of respiratory cells that are used by IFV and PIV. the largest cohort included 16 patients after HCT, 14 of whom received DAS181 for PIV-associated pneumonia but unfortunately lacked a control group. antiviral therapy is not recommended to cure or prevent infection progression even in patients at higher risk of HMPV progression. no licensed therapeutics or vaccines exist. treatment for HMPV remains so far non-specific and mostly supportive. a lower virulence of RSV-B compared to RSV-A has been reported. the ISI might be helpful to identify patients who would benefit from antiviral therapy. however, several agents are under development against RSV infections. a small interfering RNA called ALN RSV01 inhibiting the synthesis of the viral nucleocapsid protein has demonstrated a benefit in phase I to IIb clinical trials. another drug, RSV-604, targets the N terminal portion of the nucleocapsid protein. it was tested on HCT recipients but no data have been published. preemptive treatment is recommended as soon as viremia is higher or equal to 1000 copies/ml coupled with lymphocyte counts below 300/mm3 and CD4 T lymphocyte counts below 25/mm3. this is particularly important in high risk patients and those who received cord blood graft or are under steroid treatment. Cidofovir inhibits incorporation of deoxycytidine triphosphate into viral DNA by the viral DNA polymerase. cidofovir does not clear the virus in absence of T cell immune reconstitution. a small compound inhibitor named HBX has been reported to be effective against AdV infections. a cellular component important for AdV replication is ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP-7), a deubiquitinating enzyme of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. blocking its activity could aid in the treatment of AdV infections. HBoV, HCoV, and RhV There is currently no recommendation of specific antiviral therapy due to the lack of effective agents against these viruses and the lack of clinical trials. oral or intranasal pleconaril, a capsid binder, was effective in 2 randomized trials to mildly reduce the duration and severity of colds in immunocompetent adults. treatment within 48 h after the occurrence of symptoms will result in better outcome. protracted treatment should extend the treatment period recommended for immunocompetent hosts to circumvent reoccurrence and might last for 10 days. one-third of patients with PIV infection had lower respiratory tract disease. independent risk factors of progression were neutropenia, APACHE II score 15 and respiratory co-infections within a month of PIV infection. treatment with aerosolized ribavirin and/or IVIG did not prevent progression to pneumonia. high-dose IVIG had no effect on mortality after PIV LRI. current ECIL-4 guidelines suggest treatment with aerosolized ribavirin or off-label use with systemic ribavirin. ribavirin with IVIG in patients with RSV URI undergoing allogeneic HCT, allogeneic HCT recipients with risk factors for progression to LRI, and allogeneic HCT patients with LRI. however, the additional benefit of IVIG remains controversial. fusion inhibitors like GS-5806 reduce viral load and severity of clinical disease. agents targeting the viral nucleocapsid protein have been investigated. agents targeting the viral nucleocapsid protein have been investigated. iter anti RSV antibodies might be an option (RI-001)6. current strategies recommended for the treatment of respiratory viral disease after HCT are summarized in Table 1. the high incidence of GvHD after DLIs limits its use in patients with previous history of GvHD. donor lymphocyte infusions were used and recommended in case of disseminated AdV infections after HCT. adoptive immune therapy has been developed and investigated in clinical trials only for AdV infections. adenoviral clearance has been obtained after infusions of AdV-VST in 10 of 11 hematopoietic stem cells transplanted patients in a french phase I/II trial. 14 of 23 evaluable patients had in vivo expansion of Th1-VST (median time 24 days); 21 patients responded to VST infusions. in a french cohort of 131 adult patients infected with viral respiratory infections, 16 (12%) died within 3 months. eight patients (6%) died of viral pneumonia along with bacterial and/or fungal pneumonia. the fact that LRI associated death risk does not depend on the virus type is supported by Seo et al. in a french cohort of 131 adult patients infected with viral respiratory infections, 16 (12%) died within 3 months. outcome in patients who experience progression to LRI is worse compared to patients with URI regardless of the virus involved. bliterans syndrome and obstructive airflow decline have been associated with PIV and RSV infections within the first 3 months after allogeneic HCT which persisted at 1 year after transplant. the occurrence of a LRI within 100 days post-transplant was an independent predictive factor for late onset non-infectious pulmonary complications diagnosed in the first 36 months after transplantation. lymphopenia appears to be a specific risk factor in this case. other risk factors shared with increased mortality are steroid use at the time of LRI diagnosis, oxygen requirement at the time of BAL, and severity of disease based on APACHE II score. the ISI and the RSI might be helpful to identify patients at risk but await validation in clinical trials. only few antivirals are available and licensed to treat respiratory virus infections. novel antiviral compounds are urgently required that might be used in combination with antiviral lymphocytes. Lung zones (3 left lobe, 3 right lobe; 6 total) are evaluated by chest x-ray and CT scan. for each lobe there are three zones: (a) upper (above carina); (b) middle (below carina); (c) lower (below inferior pulmonary vein) Pattern score Predominant radiologic pattern in lung zone Volumetric score Extent of volumetric radiologic involvement 1 Normal lung 0 0% (normal) 2 Ground-glass"}
