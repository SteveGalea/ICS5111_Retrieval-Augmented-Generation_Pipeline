{"summary": "the protocol was approved by the IACUC and carried out in AAALAC-accredited facilities. a total of 30 adult sand rats (15 male and 15 female; weight, 130 to 300 g; age, 2.1 to 3.1 y) were used for this study. sand rats had ad libitum access to a custom-formulated nondiabetogenic diet. the diet contains ground corn, dehulled soybean meal, ground oat hulls, ground aspen, dried beet pulp, fish meal, dried brewer's yeast, cane molasses, dehydrated alfalfa meal. 15 animals per sex would give 80% power to detect a difference of 1 SD. a total of 30 clinically normal sand rats older than 6 mo were selected randomly from the colony. blood collected in serum separator tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for approximately 1 h and centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min (blood mode) biochemical parameters were analyzed at the Diagnostic Pathology Branch, Clinical Pathology Laboratory. four statistical tests (Shapiro\u2013Wilk, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, Cramer\u2013von Mises, and Anderson\u2013Darling) were used to identify any parameters for which assumption of normality might be problematic. points with Z-scores of more than 3 standard deviation from the mean are considered possible outliers. removing outliers did not change results of tests of normality. parameters included MPV, percentage of eosinophils, percentage of basophils, absolute number of basophils, triglycerides, AST, ALT, LDH, creatine kinase, and ALP. all sentinels to date have been negative for all tested agents. but the colony is positive for Helicobacter rodentium. sand rats were either singly or pair-housed in standard polycarbonate rodent cages. animal numbers were determined by using a 2-sample test to calculate power for comparing hematologic values between male and female sand rats. animal numbers were determined by using a 2-sample test to calculate power for comparing hematologic values between male and female sand rats. sand rats were euthanized by CO2 narcosis. whole blood was obtained by cardiocentesis via a 22-gauge needle. a 0.5-mL volume of blood was placed in a microtainer tube containing EDTA. biochemical parameters studied included glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, phosphorus, cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, AST, ALT, LDH, creatine kinase, ALP, and total bilirubin. Statistical analysis was performed using both SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) software. values more than 1.5 times away from the limits of the interquartile range are considered possible outliers. results for parameters based on normality and outlier tests. the following hematologic parameters (mean 1 SD) were greater in male than in female sand rats. none of the serum biochemistry analytes showed sex-associated differences. /dL 27.64 0.84 (n = 12) 28.05 0.70 (n = 14) RBC hemoglobin contenta pg 16.74 0.65 (n = 12) 17.33 0.72 (n = 14) RBC distribution widtha % 13.43 0.96 (n = 12) 12.57 0.84 (n = 14) Platelet count 103/L 536.18 179.46 (n = 12) 502.29 127.57 (n = 14) Mean platelet volumea absolute no. of monocytes 103/L 0.69 0.36 (n = 12) 0.83 0.29 (n = 14) Absolute no. of basophils 103/L 0.08 0.05 (n = 12) 0.10 0.04 (n = 14) Data are expressed as mean 1 SD. a Significant (P 0.05) difference between male and female sand rats. n = 15 Cholesterol mg/dL 83.93 12.01 (n = 14) 77.4 17.01 (n = 15) Creatine kinase U/L 262.44 122.88 (n = 10) 431.55 215.06 (n = 11) CO2 mmol/L 20.50 4.81 (n = 14) 23.00 3.22 (n = 15) Creatinine mg/dL 0.41 0.08 (n = 14) 0.46 alytes differed significantly between male and female sand rats. all category 2 parameters were tested both with and without potential outliers. the parameters of hemoglobin and hemoglobin distribution width showed significant differences between sexes. ent species including rats, mice, and Mongolian gerbils exhibit increased erythrocyte indices in males. the male has a greater muscle mass and therefore requires greater hemoglobin-carrying capacity. however, other factors affecting erythrocyte indices cannot be excluded. both male rats and mice have slightly higher values for mean platelet volume. 6,15 Probably the most conspicuous sex-associated difference in hematologic parameters for which the measure is greater in female than male sand rats is in percentage of lymphocytes. the mean glucose level of 78 mg/dL in sand rats is much lower than that in rats, mice, and Mongolian gerbil. the reason for this relatively low glucose level is unknown, but it is consistent with previously published glucose values in nondiabetic sand rats.14,23,30 Compared with that in rats and mice, BUN in sand rats (33 mg/dL) is markedly elevated. female sand rats, and 502 103/mm3 in male sand rats, and 600 103/mm3 in Mongolian gerbils. hematologic and serum chemistry analytes in sand rats are often similar to those of other rodents, such as rats and mice. instrumentation and instrumentation used."}
