{"summary": "1, 2, 3 Moreover, existing studies are limited in that most are not prospective communitybased studies 1, 4 and did not use highly sensitive diagnostic testing such as RTPCR. most studies are based on culture, antigen testing or serology that are less sensitive and specific relative to molecular assays. the trial was designed to determine the indirect effectiveness of influenza vaccine on unimmunized residents. participants were assessed for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness over the followup period, defined by the start date and stop date. influenza was detected using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s human Influenza Virus Realtime RTPCR Detection and Characterization Panel. xTAG RVP assay detects coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, entero/rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus. 10 study participants Participants were 3273 community members of 46 Hutterite colonies enrolled in a cluster randomized trial (September 22 to December 23, 2008) the trial was designed to determine the indirect effectiveness of influenza vaccine on unimmunized residents. participants were assessed for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness over the followup period. a nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained if two or more of the following symptoms were present: fever (38\u00b0C), cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, ear ache or infection, or chills. we purchased identical thermometers for all study participants and provided instruction on thermometer use. 149 (112% of 1328) with laboratoryconfirmed influenza and 595 (595) with at least 1 episode of laboratoryconfirmed respiratory viral infection other than influenza. 32 of the 149 with laboratoryconfirmed influenza were infected with another respiratory virus. entero/rhinovirus had the highest incidence (136/1000 persondays; CI: 120\u2013153), but this was not significantly higher than RSV (129/1000 persondays, CI: 112\u2013145), P = 0809) a decline in incidence was observed for entero/rhinovirus, coronaviruses, RSV, and influenza A. the epidemic midpoint for seasonal influenza was March 23, 2009. individual date values for influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B were March 9, April 7, and April 18, respectively. for coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, entero/rhinovirus, RSV, and hMPV these values were March 2, March 2, April 30, March 9, and March 27, respectively. entero/rhinovirus may be more common in the elderly than previously recognized, because entero/rhinovirus had the highest agespecific incidence among participants with age 50. parainfluenza is generally reported as the second most common virus after RSV to cause lower respiratory tract diseases. 13 Influenza B infection, unlike influenza A, was not observed among adults >30. the most likely explanation is due to the relative conservation of influenza B immunity in older individuals, as previously reported. 16 Our study has several limitations.
