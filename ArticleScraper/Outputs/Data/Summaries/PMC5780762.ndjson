{"summary": "the HBoV genome has three open reading frames encoding the 2 nonstructural proteins NS1 and NP1 and the structural viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2. 2, 3 There are four closely related HBoV genotypes, HBoV1, HBoV2 (consisting of HBoV2A and HBoV2B strains), HBoV3 and HBoV4. HBoV1 and HBoV2 DNA have been detected in respiratory samples. up to 25% of patients with HBoV infection report gastrointestinal symptoms. seasonality of HBoV infection is also unclear. PCR/PCR at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia for 18 respiratory viruses including HBoV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), HBoV, influenza A and B viruses, coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63, severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARSCoV), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, adenoviruses, rhinovirus and enterovirus. a 819bp region of the variable HBoV1 V1/V2 gene was amplified using published primers. thermocycling was performed using GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) 25 neighbourJoining trees were constructed using the pdistance nucleotide substitution model. pairwise nucleotide distances (p distance), the proportion of sites at which nucleotide sequences differ divided by the total number of residues compared, were calculated using the pairwise distance function of mega software version 40.

PCR activation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, annealing at 54\u00b0C for 1 minute, extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 minutes and a final extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. pairwise nucleotide distances (p distance), the proportion of sites at which nucleotide sequences differ divided by the total number of nucleotides compared, were calculated using the pairwise distance function of mega software version 40.

HBoV infections were detected yearround, and the annual incidence amongst the study patients did not vary significantly (15\u201317%) during 2007 coinfection with HRhV was most frequently detected (21%), followed by parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3, 46%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 46%) nineteen (44%) patients coinfected with an additional respiratory virus. Phylogeny was constructed using the neighbourjoining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. only bootstrap values >70% are shown. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Cambodian strains are indicated by \u2018Cam\u2019 followed by the year of collection. analysis of HBoV1 NP1 gene sequences revealed very high conservation of NP1 gene sequences amongst the Cambodian HBoV1 strains. identity at the amino acid level was slightly lower, between 967 and 100%. the observed nt mutations resulted in the following 5 different substitutions. s Homology at the nt level was slightly lower, between 966 and 100%. present on the surface of the virion, the VP1/VP2 protein is potentially subjected to strong selective pressure from the host immune response. 8 nonsynonymous nt mutations resulting in the following aa substitutions were observed amongst the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences investigated. potential N and Oglycosylation sites amongst HBoV1 VP1/VP2 gene sequences were conserved amongst the reference isolates. one potential Oglycosylation site was identified, located at amino acid position 519 and 638. both NP1 and VP1/VP2 sequences were successfully amplified from 12 (63%) samples. phylogeny was constructed using the neighbourjoining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. only bootstrap values >70% are shown. Cambodian strains are indicated by \u2018Cam\u2019 followed by the year of collection. we observed 1 potential Nglycosylation site, starting at amino acid position 86, which was conserved amongst all reference and Cambodian HBoV1 strains analysed. numbers indicate the position of residues relative to amino acid residues 1\u201393 of the NP1 gene. a stop codon was present at position 672 in all reference and Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences included in this study. numbers indicate the position of residues relative to amino acid residues 461\u2013672 of the NP1 gene. potential N and Oglycosylation sites amongst HBoV1 VP1/VP2 gene sequences. phylogeny was constructed using the neighbourjoining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. only bootstrap values >70% are shown. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Cambodian strains are indicated by \u2018Cam\u2019 followed by the year of collection. homomology at the nucleotide (nt) level varied between 989 and 100%. identity at the amino acid level was slightly lower, between 967 and 100%. the NP1 gene is highly conserved between strains. 8 nonsynonymous nt mutations resulting in the following aa substitutions were observed amongst all of the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences investigated. a stop codon was present at position 672 in all reference and Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences. sites, located at amino acid positions 519 and 638, were conserved amongst the reference isolates and all of the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences investigated. one potential Oglycosylation site was identified, located at amino acid position 552, which was also conserved amongst the reference isolates and all of the Cambodian VP1/VP2 sequences analysed. the higher incidence of HBoV infection amongst asymptomatic patients was not thought to be a result of a high carriage rate within the population. however, persistent and prolonged shedding is a characteristic of parvoviruses, and it is thought that lowlevel asymptomatic shedding can persist following HBoV infection. pneumonia was the most common clinical diagnosis amongst the ALRI patients investigated, regardless of age. this finding was consistent with the results of similar studies in which HBoV1 infection has been associated with severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, 20, 32, 40, 41, 42 bronchiolitis or bronchitis. 43 Recently, a severe case of HBoV infection resulting in acute respiratory failure was reported. 5 mechanisms proposed to explain the high rate of coinfection with other respiratory viruses include that HBoV is either a helper virus, facilitating replication of other respiratory pathogens or that HBoV may require a helper virus to facilitate productive infection. 44% of patients were coinfected with HBoV and an additional respiratory virus. oV2, 3 and 4 strains, all identified in stool species, are far greater. the low level of diversity reported worldwide amongst HBoV1 strains has resulted in speculation that HBoV1 evolved recently from the enteric bocavirus species. the first study to investigate the circulation and diversity of HBoV infection amongst hospitalised patients in Cambodia. HBoV infection can result in serious illness, however is frequently detected in the context of viral coinfection. ongoing studies are required to further understand the true pathogenesis of HBoV1.
