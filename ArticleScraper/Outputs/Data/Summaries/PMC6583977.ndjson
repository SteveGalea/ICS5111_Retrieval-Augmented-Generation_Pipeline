{"summary": "autophagy is a highly conserved and tightly regulated process in which cellular components are engulfed into double-membrane vesicles. this process begins with a negative membrane curvature which expands and encloses the cytosolic cargo, forming the autophagosome. the initiation of autophagosome formation is negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase. autophagy is essential for cell viability under stress conditions, including viral infections. a central aspect of the autophagic antiviral activity is to promote viral clearance by degradation of viral components. autophagy also contributes to the innate and adaptive immunity by boosting the delivery of toll-like receptor ligands to endosomes. the bipartite genome encodes four proteins: the matrix protein Z, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L, the major nucleocapsid protein N, and the glycoprotein precursor GPC [18]. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main route used by JUNV and involves the cytoskeleton and other cellular proteins [21,22]. rabbit polyclonal antibody against JUNV N protein [30] or mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Monoclonal anti-Junin Virus, Clone SA02-BG12 (produced in vitro), NR-49274 and Clone NA05-AG12 (produced in vitro) were used. Rabbit anti-LC3B (3868), anti-RAB5 (3547), anti-LAMP1 rabbit IgG (711-545-152) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. pBABE-puro mCherry-EGFP-LC3B was a gift from Jayanta Debnath. monolayers of BHK21 cells infected with each strain. a MOI of 3 and the virus inoculum was removed after 1 h. the cells were incubated in complete fresh medium at 37\u00b0C for the indicated times. the cells were infected with JUNV and incubated in fresh media. lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. equal amount of protein samples were diluted in 6 Laemmli sample buffer. the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. the membrane was then incubated for 2 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies. to stain endogenous LC3, fixed cells were permeabilised in 100% cold methanol for 10 min at 20\u00b0C. fixed cells were permeabilised with 0.1% Saponin-5% normal goat serum in PBS for 15 min. immunoostaining of LC3 was performed overnight at 4\u00b0C by incubating cells in primary antibody solution. siRNA against BECN1 (SR305711), ATG5 (SR306286), ATG7 (SR307159) or RAB7A (SR305302) was used. the efficient knockdown of the target protein was evaluated by WB. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (715-545-150), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (711-165-152) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (711-545-152) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. pBABE-puro mCherry-EGFP-LC3B was a gift from Jayant all cell cultures were tested using a PCR detection kit (8208) from ScienCell Research Laboratories. cells cultured in 24 or 6-well plates were infected with JUNV or TCRV at a MOI of 3 and the virus inoculum was removed after adsorption for 1 h. the cells were infected with the indicated drugs prior to mock infection. the cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. the proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. the membrane was then incubated for 2 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies. to stain endogenous LC3, fixed cells were permeabilised in 100% cold methanol for 10 min at 20\u00b0C, washed three times in PBS and incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. confocal images were collected on a leica TCS SP5 II microscope. RNA interference A549 cells were grown to 60% confluence in 6-well cells. a final concentration of 5 nM siRNA against BECN1 (SR305711), ATG5 (SR306286), ATG7 (SR307159) or RAB7A (SR305302) was used. p.i. in JUNV infected cells compared to mock-infected cells. no significant change in the LC3-II level was observed in mock-treated cells at 48 h. the WB bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software to calculate the JUNV N, LC3-II, LC3-I and p62 expression levels. mAb rabbit anti-JUNV N was detected using a mAb mouse anti-JUNV N from BEI Resources followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. pharmacological inhibition of autophagy decreases JUNV multiplication. the expression of -actin (control) expression was determined at 24 h p.i. by WB. a decrease of N expression in infected cells was observed in response to BAF treatment. cells were either treated with the different drugs three hours before the infection (viral adsorption) or three hours after the infection. after 24 h p.i., the viral titre from cell supernatant and the expression levels for p62, N and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratios were assessed. 3 h pre-infection or 3 h post infection with JUNV, cells were treated for with 3-MA (5 mM), bafilomycin A1 (BAF, 100 nM), NL (ammonium chloride 20 mM, 100 M Leupeptin) or rapamycin (Rap, 100 nM) after infection, Cells were further incubated in MEM containing the corresponding drug (for the indicated time) experiments performed adding Rap post-infection resulted in a similar increase in viral yields of JUNV. the effect of Rap in JUNV infection suggests that autophagy promotes JUNV yield and increases viral progeny. the number of puncta in mock-infected cells treated with Rap was higher than in the NT control. no significant difference was detected in the number of RFP-LC3 puncta per cell in mock versus infected cells treated with BAF. cells were fixed and mounted for confocal microscopy (24 h p.i.) mCherry-GFP-LC3-transfected cells were treated or infected. the data correspond to the mean s.d. (n = 3); Student's t-test; *, P 0.05. the blockage of organelle acidification triggered by BAF resulted in the accumulation of LC3 puncta containing both, GFP and mCherry signal. this result indicates that there is an accumulation of acidified autophagosomal structures in JUNV-infected cells. this suggests that the virus induced both the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes. replication is not required for the induction of autophagosomes. we also evaluated the capacity of another NW arenavirus to activate autophagy by performing similar experiments with TCRV. JUNV-induced vesicles are positive for both LC3 and LAMP1. no colocalisation of viral N and LAMP1 was observed in infected cells. LC3 colocalised with ATG16L1 and p62 in infected cells. depletion of endogenous ATG5, ATG7, Beclin 1 and RAB7A reduces viral yield. we used siRNA targeting key autophagy genes, Beclin 1, ATG5, ATG7 and RAB7A. TG7, Beclin 1 or RAB7A by siRNA reduces JUNV yield. western blot analysis of JUNV N, ATG5, ATG7, Beclin 1, RAB7A and -actin expression in infected cells. protein samples from harvested cells at increasing times p.i. were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-LC3 antibody that recognises both forms of LC3. the expression level of LC3-II was significantly increased from 12 to 24 h p.i. in infected cells compared to the mock. JUNV infection correlates with the accumulation of the LC3 autophagy marker protein. LC3 can be redistributed from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization to a distinctive punctate cytoplasmic pattern. confocal microscopy images show mock or JUNV infected cells. cells were fixed and processed for IF 24 h p.i. LC3 was detected using a mAb rabbit anti-LC3B and a pAb Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. a549 cells were pretreated or not with (A) 3-MA (5 mM), (B) bafilomycin A1 (BAF, 100 nM) or (C) rapamycin (Rap, 100 nM) for 3 h. the expression of JUNV N was determined at 24 h p.i. a decrease of N expression in infected cells was observed in response to BAF treatment. increased LC3II levels were detected, confirming inhibition of autophagic degradation by BAF. blockage of endosomal acidification negatively affects infectivity of viruses. 1% (pre-infection) and 34% (post-infection); NL, 64% (pre-infection) and 54% (post-infection) inhibition by these compounds is at least partially targeted to events that take place after virus uncoating. rapamycin (Rap) induces autophagy by blocking the mTOR pathway. in parallel, experiments performed adding Rap post-infection resulted in similar increase in viral yields of JUNV. cationic lipids or polymer-transfected cells were infected with JUNV. no differences were detected in RFP-LC3 puncta/cell and virus yield regardless of the transfection reagent employed. the cells infected with JUNV presented similar numbers of puncta compared to mock-infected cells treated with Rap. cells were fixed (24 h p.i.), mounted and analysed by confocal imaging. the number of RFP puncta per cell was quantified using ImageJ software. data were collected from >50 cells for each condition. an autophagosome fused with an endosome or lysosome, called amphisome or autolysosome, respectively [44] cells were transfected with mCherry-GFP-LC3 plasmid, and 24 h post-transfection were treated with rapamycin, BAF or infected with JUNV. the blockage of organelle acidification triggered by BAF resulted in the accumulation of LC3 puncta containing both, at 24 h post exposure to JUNV, there was no difference between the number of RFP-LC3 puncta per cell induced by UV-inactivated JUNV and replication competent JUNV. the results suggest that JUNV particles play a role, but replication is not required for the induction of autophagosomes. autophagosomes may fuse with late endosomes and lysosomes, forming autolysosomes. the colocalisation of LC3 and early and late endosomal markers was detected in infected cells. uninfected cells showed almost no overlap. colocalisation of LAMP1 and JUNV N in infected cells was assessed by immunoconfocal microscopy analysis using Abs anti-LAMP1 and anti-JUNV N as primary Abs. Abs conjugated to Alexa488 (LAMP1) and Cy3 (N) as secondary Abs. cells treated with autophagy-specific siRNA compared to the control siRNA. also, depletion of autophagic proteins led to reduced viral titres. the data demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy affects yield. LC3 puncta were detected by immunostaining for endogenous LC3 or following the redistribution of mCherry-GFP-LC3 or RFP-LC3 signal after infection. this suggests that the LC3 puncta induced by JUNV were autophagosomes. UV-inactivated cells redeemed pattern of Akt phosphorylation observed for the replication-competent virus. we observed that UV-inactivated virus induces a RFP-LC3 punctate pattern comparable to infectious virus. other viruses activate autophagy independently of viral replication. osome biogenesis, ATG5, ATG12, and ATG16 form the autophagic elongation complex determining the site of LC3 lipidation. phagy elongation complex is recruited at the membranous web, an intracellular membrane rearrangement composed of double-membrane vesicles. JUNV induces the colocalisation of LC3 with p62 and ATG16. autophagosome fusion with early and late endosomes is not being blocked by JUNV infection. silencing of RAB7A had a strong inhibitory effect on viral multiplication. further experiments are needed to dissect the effect of RAB7A on JUNV multiplication. rotavirus initiates autophagy and hijacks this membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins to viroplasms. LCMV RNA aggregates colocalise with the early endosomal marker RAB5c and the viral glycoprotein in infected cells. this is consistent with entry by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. extracellular virus titre and infectious cell-associated virus quantified 24 h p.i. were significantly reduced. vesicle acidification promotes maturation of encapsidated virus particles into infectious virions. red dashed lines show the cropping area. the brightness of the whole image was adjusted during processing of the blots. autophagosome formation by LC3 aggregation (RFP-LC3 positive puncta) was observed by fluorescence microscopy. the number of RFP puncta per cell was quantified using ImageJ software."}
