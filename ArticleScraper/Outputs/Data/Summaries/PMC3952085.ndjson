{"summary": "the pathology of MS lesions is heterogeneous (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) several patterns suggesting predominant immune-mediated inflammation (pattern I and II) and primary oligodendrogliopathy (pattern III and IV) have been described. animal models are a helpful tool to reveal mechanisms underlying de- and remyelination failure. the cuprizone model is a suitable tool to study basic glial reactions during de- and re-myelination in absence of primarily immune-mediated mechanisms. remyelination rapidly progresses after termination of the cuprizone diet. cuprizone was first used in clinical chemistry for quantitative analysis of copper content in biological materials such as serum and plasma. cuprizone possesses various biotoxic effects in rodents like growth retardation, pregnancy disturbance, and severe CNS pathology. in 1972 Blakemore described a massive depletion of oligodendrocytes as a primary reason for cuprizone-induced demyelination. he also reported about remyelination, which can occur spontaneously after removal of the cuprizone diet. in 1980 Ludwin established a chronic model of demyelination by feeding mice up to 6\u20137 months with cuprizone-containing chow. the CC is the most frequently investigated white matter tract. the use of C57BL/6 mice opened the investigators a lot of new possibilities to study genetically modified mice. 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone was established to induce highly reproducible demyelination without detrimental systemic effects in 8\u201310 weeks old mice. however, the susceptibility to cuprizone seems to differ between young and old animals and between different mouse strains. the reason for the age-dependent susceptibility to cuprizone is currently not clear. despite a similar extent of astro- and microgliosis, female SJL mice were partially resistant to the demyelination in the CC. however, the course of de- and remyelination was similar between genders in C57BL/6 mice. extracted liver mitochondria were not affected by cuprizone ex vivo. mitochondrial disturbances seem to be the key factor of oligodendroglial apoptosis. enlarged mitochondria were detected in the liver and brain of cuprizone-treated mice. oligodendrocytes need to display a high cellular metabolism. during myelination oligodendrocytes generate three times of their weight into the membrane per day. oligodendrocytes possess only a little amount of the anti-oxidative enzyme, glutathione, which declines upon cuprizone treatment. the vast majority of the brain CA II is localized in the oligodendrocytes and the myelin. the activity of CA II started to decline already during the first week of cuprizone diet well before demyelination develops. mitochondria seem to be mainly affected by this toxin, leading to increased production of oxidative agents. apoptotic oligodendrocytes could be characterized by activation of caspase-3 und positive Tunel-staining. caspase-3-positive oligodendrocytes were detected in the CC only during the first 10 days of cuprizone diet. the oligodendroglial depletion in MS seems to progress in an apoptosis-like manner with expression of some apoptotic markers. the transcription factor p53 is a well characterized pro-apoptotic molecule activated in response to a wide variety of toxic stimuli. p75NTR / mice did not show any alteration regarding the course of de- and remyelination or glial reactions. FAS is an activator of the extrinsic apoptotic cell cascade. oligodendrocyte death was not prevented in mice lacking FAS in oligodendrocytes. degradation/re-expression of different myelin proteins follows individual temporal pattern. complete demyelination in the medial CC can be observed by PLP staining at week 5. successful remyelination comprises several highly orchestrated events. oligodendrocyte specific zinc finger transcription repressor, Zfp488, was shown to interact with Olig2 physically in vitro. retrovirus-mediated Zfp488 over-expression could significantly promote an oligodendrogenic fate of differentiating SVZ neuronal stem cells and enhance functional recovery of cuprizone-treated mice. remyelinated axons retain the ability to be remyelinated as shown by transplantation of OPC into the lesions. remyelinated axons retain the ability to be remyelinated as shown by transplantation of OPC into the lesions. remyelination was accelerated in ST8 alpha-N-Acetyl-Neuraminide alpha-2,8-Sialyltransferase 4 knockout mice. these molecular mechanisms are indeed involved in remyelination. cells with many faces Microglia are brain-resident mononuclear phagocytes. Activation of microglia during the course of cuprizone-induced demyelination (acute and chronic) no activated, RCA-1-positive microglia in control mice (A) macrophages are involved in T helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses and the elimination of microorganisms. alternatively activated M2 macrophages express anti-inflammatory factors. there is continuous debate whether microglia play a deleterious or beneficial role in CNS diseases. ter and colleagues demonstrated a delayed OPC recruitment after the depletion of macrophages via exposure of mice to clodronate-liposomes prior/after lysolecithin-induced demyelination. authors linked this phenomenon to an altered growth factor expression in macrophage-depleted animals. TNF- production was strongly increased during primary demyelination in both white and gray matter microglia. expression of the T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD80 was only slightly increased on CD11b+/CD45low microglia during de-and remyelination. a subset of peripheral macrophages infiltrated into the demyelinated CC. 5\u20137% of the CD11b+/CD45high cells were present in the CC at week 5 and 6. the receptors CD200R and SIRP- suggested to inhibit activation of microglia or keep them in a resting state. Tyro3 gene expression was down-regulated and seems to coincide with oligodendroglial loss, while Axl and Mer were found on activated microglia. microglia appear not to be assigned to a certain phenotype characteristic either for de- or remyelination. astrocytes become activated whereupon GFAP-expression is increased. hypertrophy and hyperplasia of astrocytes occurs as a response to cuprizone treatment in different white and gray matter structures. the number of astrocytes is not significantly increased until 3 weeks of cuprizone treatment simultaneously with first signs of apparent demyelination. correlating with the degree of demyelination, astrogliosis is increasing during acute demyelination peaking around the time point of maximal demyelination and incipient remyelination around 5\u20136 weeks. astrocytes produce different growth factors during cuprizone-induced demyelination, thereby promoting OPC proliferation by FGF-2 and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGF) the expression of the radial glia cell marker fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) was found to be induced in activated astrocytes after cuprizone-induced acute demyelination. the expression of FABP7 in astrocytes also correlated with remy the exact role of astrocytes in de- and remyelination is still not fully understood. astrocytes are key players in complex interactions with OPC. oligodendrocytes start to undergo apoptosis after 3\u20137 days of cuprizone exposure. caspase-3-positive oligodendrocytes were detected in the CC only during the first 10 days of cuprizone diet. the same amount of dying oligodendrocytes was detected in the CC only via Tunel-stainig. this suggests that at this time a caspase-3-independent apoptosis predominates. the oligodendroglial depletion in MS seems to progress in an apoptosis-like manner with expression of some apoptotic markers. the transcription factor p53 is a well characterized pro-apoptotic molecule activated in response to a wide variety of toxic stimuli. elevated levels of p53 can be detected in the CC of mice during the first 2\u20133 weeks of cuprizone diet. oligodendrocyte death was not prevented in mice lacking FAS in oligodendrocytes. after 3 weeks of cuprizone treatment mature oligodendrocytes are almost completely depleted. demyelination peaks between 4.5 and 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure in the CC. complete demyelination in the medial CC can be observed by PLP staining at week 5. successful remyelination comprises several highly orchestrated events. successful remyelination comprises several highly orchestrated events. retrovirus-mediated Zfp488 over-expression could promote oligodendrogenic fate of differentiating SVZ neuronal stem cells and enhance functional recovery of cuprizone-treated mice. et al. demonstrated that retrovirus-mediated Zfp488 over-expression could significantly promote an oligodendrogenic fate of differentiating SVZ neuronal stem cells. prizone feeding until week 6 newly generated oligodendrocytes are damaged again. remyelinated axons retain the ability to be remyelinated as shown by transplantation of OPC into the lesions. a number of putative inhibitors of myelination are frequently accused. microglia are brain-resident mononuclear phagocytes that originate from primitive macrophages in the embryonic yolk sac. they colonize the neuroepithelium at the onset of vascularization of the CNS. after 3 weeks activated microglia are numerously present in the CC, cortex, and hippocampus. there are no activated, RCA-1-positive microglia in control mice (A) the amount of activated microglia increases upon the course of demyelination. if cuprizone is stopped after 5 weeks microglia numbers begin to decline. a close relationship between presence of macrophages, inflammation, and OPC recruitment has been confirmed by Kotter and colleagues. the authors linked this phenomenon to altered growth factor expression in macrophage-depleted animals. microglia phenotype associated either with de- or remyelination (pro-inflammatory phenotype vs. regenerative) our group analyzed the composition of the microglial population and expression of a subset of phagocytic markers and some known pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cuprizone model. expression of the T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD80 was only slightly increased on CD11b+/CD45low microglia during de-and remyelination. a subset of peripheral macrophages (CD11b+/CD45high) infiltrated into the demyelinated CC of cuprizone-treated mice (McMahon et al., 2002; Remington et al., 2007). 5\u20137% of the CD11b+/CD45high cells were present in the CC at week 5 and 6. the receptors CD200R and SIRP- were suggested to inhibit activation of microglia or keep them in a resting state. microglia appear to be not assigned to a certain phenotype characteristic either for de- or remyelination. in cuprizone-induced de- and remyelination activated microglia play a crucial role creating a repair promoting environment due to myelin debris clearance proceeding in a highly controlled manner. astrocytes become activated whereupon GFAP-expression is increased. astrogliosis occurs as a response to cuprizone treatment. astrocytosis precedes loss of myelin. correlating with the degree of demyelination, astrogliosis is increasing during acute demyelination peaking around the time point of maximal demyelination and incipient remyelination around 5\u20136 weeks of cuprizone exposure. under continuing cuprizone treatment astrogliosis persists and after chronic demyelination the number of astrocytes is similar to acute demyelination. the expression of the radial glia cell marker fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) was found to be induced in activated astrocytes after cuprizone-induced acute demyelination. expression of this marker and extent of astrogliosis was diminished after chronic demyelination. the role of astrocytes in experimental demyelination was investigated by loss-of-function experiments. astrocytes are key players in complex interactions with OPC, mature oligodendrocytes, and microglia supporting remyelination at least in the cuprizone model. a growing body of evidence corroborates the assumption that an adequate and controlled inflammatory response is required for a successful myelin regeneration. matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, are highly involved in the perpetuation of inflammation, myelin degradation, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. also proposed to modulate different physiological processes such as cellular development/growth, survival, apoptosis, and migration. the balance between MMP and TIMP is a very critical factor for the development/perpetuation of different pathologies. the expression of MMP can be regulated by some inflammatory cytokines. only TNFR1(p55) possesses a cytoplasmic protein interaction region called \u201cdeath domain\u201d. immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties of TNF- are thought to be mediated by action through TNFR2(p75) clinical therapies aimed to block TNF--mediated pro-inflammatory effects did not yield in an amelioration of disease and even worsened the clinical course in some patients. several genes of the MHC-family were reduced in mice lacking TNF-. remyelination was delayed in mice lacking LtR lymphotoxin- receptor / mice. IL-1 induced proliferation of astrocytes (Giulian and Lachman, 1985; Giulian et al., 1988). IL-1 activated the production/release of different cytokines such as TNF-, interleukin-6 (IL-6), NO and thus contributes to the inflammatory response. IL-1 increased the secretion of growth factors promoting proliferation/differentiation of OPC. OPN is known to possess multiple biological and immunoregulatory functions being involved in cell adhesion and providing a chemotactic stimulus for macrophages and astrocytes. previously, OPN was shown to be up-regulated in MS lesions and in several experimental animal models for demyelination. the lack of iNOS leads to an earlier onset and more severe disease course of EAE. similar in the cuprizone model, a depletion of iNOS exacerbated demyelination. the absence of constitutively expressed neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) protected mice from cuprizone-induced demyelination. mana et al. reported a deleterious role of IFN- demonstrating reduced demyelination and enhanced remyelination in mice lacking the binding chain of the IFN- receptor. in both cases, microglia were suggested to be regulated by IFN-. however, microglia were suggested to be regulated by IFN-. growth factors are known to possess pleiotropic effects in a variety of cell types including neuronal and glial cells in the CNS. together with chemokines, cytokines, and hormones growth factors are strongly involved in the orchestration of development, specification, and maintenance of CNS structures. the absence of FGF-2 leads to a faster regeneration/differentiation of oligodendrocytes after cuprizone-induced demyelination. however, an up-regulation of FGF-2 mRNA expression during remyelination has been reported in lysolecithin-induced demyelination. oligodendrocytes were treated for 12 weeks with cuprizone. previously, FGFR1 was involved in OPC proliferation as well as in the inhibition of OPC differentiation in vitro. a potent mitogen for OPC PDGF is one of the prominent compounds of the culture medium of primary cortical OPC derived from new-borns or embryos. the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) is widely accepted as a phenotypic marker for this developmental stage of the oligodendrocytes lineage. the same group reported an enhanced remyelination, increased regeneration, and reduced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes in the hPDGF-GFAP mice. however, it remains unclear how PDGF-signaling impacts microgliosis and astrogliosis in these transgenic mice. in the CC of cuprizone-treated mice the expression of the IGF-1 mRNA started to be up-regulated after 2 weeks of cuprizone feeding (Gudi et al., 2011) the expression of the IGF-1 mRNA started to be up-regulated after 2 weeks of cuprizone feeding (Gudi et al., 2011) peaked at weeks 4\u20135 corresponding to the maximal demyelination, proliferation of OPC and onset of differentiation. surviving oligodendrocytes seem to retain the ability to remyelinate timely on week 5 regardless of remaining myelin debris. CNTF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are acting via heterodimeric gp130/LIFR. both molecules possess multiple functions in a variety of cell types. exogenously administered LIF limited cuprizone-induced demyelination in wt mice and rescued the LIF-knockout phenotype during cuprizone-induced demyelination. but remyelination was not further enhanced if wt mice were complemented with LIF. OPC and mature oligodendrocytes express BMP4 and its receptors. in vitro treatment of OPC with BMP4 inhibited differentiation. in vivo expression of BMP4 was elevated in OPC within demyelinated lesions induced by ethidium bromide. chemokines were postulated to regulate directional migration of leukocytes. but different chemokines are also implicated in a variety of biological functions. mRNA expression of chemokine CCL3 was initiated after 2 days. CCL2 is a well characterized chemokine known to be strongly implicated in the pathology of MS and EAE. in cuprizone-induced demyelination we could also detect an up-regulated expression of CCL2 and CCL3 upon cuprizone treatment. the clearance of damaged myelin as well as the recruitment of microglia was strongly impaired in this experimental setting. the chemokine CXCL12 is a potent chemoattractant for lymphocytes and monocytes but not neutrophils. in the adult CNS, CXCL12 orchestrates neurotransmission, neurotoxicity and neuroglial interactions. either pharmacological blockade or in vivo RNA-silencing led to reduced OPC maturation and remyelination failure in the cuprizone model. the lentiviral-gene delivery of CXCL12 into TNFR2 / mice could rescue this effect. a number of in vitro studies revealed that these molecules can irreversibly harm oligodendrocytes. a growing body of evidence corroborates the assumption that an adequate and controlled inflammatory response is required for a successful myelin regeneration. a growing body of evidence corroborates the assumption that an adequate and controlled inflammatory response is required. MMP7, -9, -11, -13, -15 were either not regulated or even down-regulated during the demyelination peak between weeks 4.5 and 5. expression of endogenous antagonists of metalloproteinases (TIMP) was increased during the demyelination peak between weeks 4.5 and 5. TNFR1(p55) is supposed to be responsible for the detrimental effects of TNF- by initiating and exacerbating the course of disease. TNFR2(p75) responds preferentially to membrane-bound TNF- and does not contain a death domain. TNFR2 but not TNFR1 has been shown to be gradually up-regulated during de- and remyelination. similar to TNF--deficient mice TNFR2 / mice showed diminished/delayed regeneration of myelin. depletion of TNF- did not alter extent of microglial or astroglial responses. remyelination was enhanced when LtR-signaling was inhibited by an LtR-Ig fusion decoy protein. these controversial results were associated with developmental abnormalities in the immune system of LtR lymphotoxin- receptor / mice. IL-1 is another prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine that is produced by activated microglia and macrophages. reduction of IGF-1 production is known to promote differentiation of OPC and myelination. accumulation of microglia and proliferation of OPC were not altered in the IL-1 / mice. IL-1 did not display any impact on depletion of oligodendrocytes. promote both MBP synthesis and myelin formation in mixed cortical cultures, suggesting to be involved in remyelination. an overproduction of NO is known to induce an irreversible cell damage and death in different cell populations. the role of NO in the CNS seems to be controversial. first Gao et al. proposed protective effects of IFN- on myelin. in these mice reduced loss of oligodendrocytes was associated with an increase of IGF-1 expression. in both cases, microglia were suggested to be regulated by IFN-. the group of Popko reported in transgenic mice that ectopically expressed IFN- under the GFAP promoter in a tetracycline-controlled manner an altered but not inhibited recruitment/expansion of OPC via IFN--signaling. remyelination capacity was significantly improved in mice lacking IFN-, probably linked to reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress via IFN-. several growth factors are strongly regulated during cuprizone treatment and/or in the recovery phase. it is widely accepted that the main impact of FGF-2 on OPC is the induction/support of proliferation, inhibition of progenitor differentiation, and subsequent myelination. a recent study of Zhou and colleagues showed that all four FGF receptors are highly regulated upon cuprizone treatment and during remyelination. the authors pursue a genetic approach with mice lacking FGFR1 in oligodendrocytes in a tamoxifen-dependent manner that were treated for 12 weeks with cuprizone. oligodendroglial cells expressed mainly FGFRs. PDGF is one of the prominent compounds of the culture medium of primary cortical OPC. hPDGF-GFAP mice showed an enhanced remyelination, increased regeneration, and reduced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes in the hPDGF-GFAP mice. but it remains unclear how PDGF-signaling impacts microgliosis and astrogliosis in these transgenic mice. IGF-1 over-expressing mice showed hypermyelinated axons. IGF-1 knockout mice showed decreased number of oligodendrocytes. the involvement of IGF-1 in de- and remyelination has been reported. mice exhibited enhanced demyelination at week 3 but an almost complete myelin recovery at week 5. mature oligodendrocytes were numerously present in the CC of IGF-1 over-expressing mice during demyelination. the positive effect of IGF-1 on mature oligodendrocyte survival was also observed in vitro. in cuprizone-induced demyelination LIF-deficient mice showed more severe demyelination, increased loss of oligodendrocytes, and an impaired remyelination. the oligodendrocyte replenishment, which includes both OPC proliferation and differentiation, seemed not to be significantly compromised in these transgenic mice. several BMPs including BMP belong to the transforming growth factor-superfamily (TGF) of cytokines. in vitro treatment of OPC with BMP4 inhibited differentiation. in vivo expression of BMP4 was elevated in OPC within demyelinated lesions. remyelination in oligodendrocytes is likely due to induction of apoptosis. chemokine CCL3 was initiated after 2 days and gradually increased until week 4. mRNA expression of chemokine CCL3 was initiated already after 2 days. production of CCL3 in murine cortical astrocytes was also regulated after an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS. chemokine known to be strongly implicated in pathology of MS and EAE. chemokine CXCL12 is a potent chemoattractant for lymphocytes and monocytes but not neutrophils. the chemokine CXCL12 plays an important role in the patterning and plasticity of both immune and nervous system during development and adulthood. cellular source of CXCL12 within the CC of cuprizone-treated mice includes both GFAP-positive astrocytes and CD11b-positive microglia. Loss of CXCR4-signaling via either pharmacological blockade or in vivo RNA-silencing led to reduced OPC maturation and remyelination failure. the aetiology of MS remains unresolved and the pathology of MS lesions as well as the individual course of disease are highly heterogeneous. the focus in MS research is directed towards the development of individual MS therapies and the establishment of new regenerative agents. genetic models are useful to study dysfunctions of myelination. the assessment of remyelination is complicated in EAE and virus mediated models due to concurrently occurring de- and remyelination. a systemic oral administration of the toxin cuprizone is represented by a relatively simple, but as well highly reproducible and reliable protocol. the cuprizone model becomes increasingly attractive to study the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of de- and remyelination to uncover regional differences. induction animal models Strength Limitation Autoimmune EAE [induced by CNS tissue; myelin peptides (MBP, PLP, MOG); adoptive transfer of myelin reactive T cells] is the most frequently used model to study autoimmune encephalitis in the CNS -mimics MS with respect to clinical symptoms and pathology. both de- and remyelination can proceed simultaneously -unpredictable localisation of lesions that classically occur in the spinal cord Viral-autoimmune Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV); mouse hepatitis virus (MHV); Semliki Forest virus (SFV) -supports the environmental compound (early infections) of MS aetiology -allows to study the phenomenon of epitope spreading -use -T, B cells independent only of limited relevance for MS and the development of immunomodulating drugs -BBB remains intact. no good clinical read-out -time consuming (acute model: 5\u20138 weeks; chronic: 12\u201316 weeks) -not useful to study spinal cord demyelination since demyelination occurs only in the brain Lysolecithin and Ethidium bromide (focal injection of a toxin) despite continued cuprizone exposure mature oligodendrocytes occur between week 5 and 6 and start subtle remyelination. remyelination does not strictly start with the end of cuprizone administration but all the necessary prerequisites are already made available before that. the cuprizone dose of 0.2% (w/w) is known to be well tolerated and reliable to induce a profound demyelination. most studies have investigated the medial CC where complete demyelination occurs after 5 weeks of 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone administration. the cuprizone model is a well established and investigated paradigm to study de- and remyelination in rodents. it seems that the regeneration program initiated after the toxic insult via cuprizone proceeds in a highly controlled manner running sequences of tightly orchestrated events on molecular and cellular levels. there is growing evidence that a limited inflammation may play a beneficial role in oligodendroglial regeneration. cytokines, chemokines, and MMP were summarized from different studies. 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone was fed for 5 to 8\u201310-week old C57BL/6 mice. expression of various factors is linked to the cellular response during de- and remyelination. axons in the medial corpus callosum are demyelinated at week 5. axons in the medial corpus callosum are demyelinated. the cuprizone model lacks the autoimmune component of MS."}
