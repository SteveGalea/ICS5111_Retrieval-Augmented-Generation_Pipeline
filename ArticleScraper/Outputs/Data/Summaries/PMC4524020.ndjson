{"summary": "rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgG and IgM enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems were established to detect specific human IgG and IgM antibodies. sensitivity and specificity of rSFTSV-N-IgM capture ELISA were 90.59 and 100 %. our rSFTSV-N protein-based IgG and IgM ELISA systems have the advantage of distinguishing two types of antibodies. they are safe to use for diagnosis of SFTS virus infection."}
