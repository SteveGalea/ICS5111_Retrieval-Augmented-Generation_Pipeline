{"summary": "primary aim was to determine Treg cell frequency in the peripheral blood of children with and without asthma. the secondary aim was to explore the association between Treg cell frequency with allergen sensitization, disease severity and medication use. studies utilizing murine models of allergic asthma provide strong evidence for an essential Treg cell role in the development and perpetuation of allergic inflammation [10,11] the role of Treg cells in allergic asthma remains poorly defined, particularly in children when the initiation of allergic asthma most often occurs. additional children with a physician diagnosis of asthma were recruited to enrich the sample for children with asthma. an effort was made to enroll equal numbers of children with intermittent, mild persistent and moderate/severe persistent asthma. symptom scores from 134 of the 159 study subjects were obtained. the majority denied recent respiratory infection symptoms at the time of blood draw. all 10 had respiratory viral panel analysis. sensitivity for detection of total IgE was 2 kU/L. allergen-specific IgE values of 0.35 kU/L were considered positive. dust mite, cat, dog, alternaria and cockroach were considered perennial allergens. Flow cytometry was performed in children enrolled in COAST over a one-year period. additional children with a physician diagnosis of asthma were recruited to enrich the sample. an effort was made to enroll equal numbers of children with intermittent, mild persistent and moderate/severe persistent asthma. symptom scores from 134 of the 159 study subjects were obtained. the majority denied recent respiratory infection symptoms at the time of blood draw for flow cytometry. Dermatophagoides farinae, Alternaria alternata, cat, dog, cockroach, egg, and peanut were analysed. allergen-specific IgE values of 0.35 kU/L were considered positive. dust mite, cat, dog, alternaria, and cockroach were considered perennial allergens. index was recorded for 66% of the subjects at the time of blood draw for Treg cell analysis. there is no difference in BMI by asthma status or ICS use.

CD25 + CD127lo/- cells display the highest amount of Foxp3 per cell. the mean MFI for Foxp3 in CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + CD127lo/- cells is shown. study subjects with documented respiratory viral infections tended to have higher Treg cells. ICS use remains significantly associated with increased Treg cell frequency after adjustment for gender. intermittent 31 6.77 -0.17 (-1.15, 0.82) Mild persistent 15 6.77 -0.17 (-1.15, 0.82) Mod/Sev persistent 20 6.91 -0.02 (-1.17, 1.12) Interaction: P = 0.78 ICS Inhaled corticosteroid, 95% CI, 95% confidence interval. studies investigating the association between Treg cells and allergic sensitization have been conflicting [33-35] FEIA, fluroenzyme immunoassay; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval. four children missing FEIA data were excluded from the analysis. increased frequency in Treg cells was associated with ICS use. study population Table 1 outlines the characteristics of the study subjects. the percentage of children with asthma was 42% with no significant difference in gender. the children with asthma were more likely to be african american.

PBMCs were isolated and stained for flow cytometry as described in the methods section. one representative subject is shown out of 159 assayed with the percentage of each population in upper right corner. the percentage of Foxp3 staining within each defined quadrant is plotted for the entire cohort. the CD127 + CD25+ T cells display the highest amount of Foxp3 per cell. data are expressed as the mean percentage of Treg cells in the peripheral blood of asthmatics (6.91% [6.52, 7.3]) versus control (6.4% [6.07, 6.73]) children. increased peripheral blood Treg cell frequency is associated with inhaled corticosteroid use. increased Treg cell frequency is associated with ICS use and not asthma disease Severity Patient Classification n % Treg cells/CD4+ cells (mean, adjusted) effect* 95%CI p- value Children not on ICS 119 6.32 -- -- 0.02 Children treated with ICS 40 7.37 1.06 (0.15, 1.96) No asthma 93 6.93 -- -- -- 0.96 Intermittent 31 6.77 -0.17 (-0.91, 0.57) Mild persistent 15 6.77 increased Treg cell frequency is associated with ICS use and not allergic sensitization Patient Classification n % Treg cells/CD4+ cells (mean, adjusted) effect* 95%CI p-value Children not on ICS 116 6.38 -- -- 0.003. 5 children treated with ICS 39 7.55 1.26 (0.40, 2.12) No asthma 93 7.03 -- -- 0.68 Non-atopic asthma 20 7.05 0.02 (-0.80, 0.84) Atopic asthma 44 6.69 -0.34 (-1.18, 0.50) ICS inhaled corticosteroid, 95% CI, 95% confidence interval. this finding suggests Foxp3 protein levels may not be constantly detectable using flow cytometry in bona fide Treg cells. multi-parameter flow cytometry using CD25 and CD127 to define Treg cells is reliable for quantification of CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of Foxp3 protein and demethylation at TSDR. corticosteroid exposure leads to increased Foxp3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from adult asthmatics treated with oral and inhaled studies have implicated Treg cell dysfunction in allergic asthmatics. this remained consistent when subjects were segregated by asthma, disease severity, or ICS use. studies further phenotyping the Treg cell compartment are ongoing. corticosteroid use should be considered when analyzing the frequency of Treg cells in asthma. the modest increase (17%) in Treg cell frequency was observed even with intermittent ICS use. this suggests that ICS-mediated increases in Treg cell frequency could contribute to the beneficial ICS effects on asthma disease control."}
