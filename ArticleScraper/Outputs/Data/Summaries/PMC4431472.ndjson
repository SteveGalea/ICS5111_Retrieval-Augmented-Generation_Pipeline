{"summary": "all hospital discharges for acute exacerbation of COPD during 2009 in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were analyzed. the relationship between the number of hospitalizations for COPD and the mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures. the highest number of admissions (3,644 [37.2%] occurred during winter, followed by autumn with 2,367 (24.1%), spring with 2,347 (23.9%), and summer with 1,446 (14.7%; P0.001). in 2005, COPD affected 210 million people, of whom 3 million died from the disease. the global Burden of Disease Study estimated that, in 2010, COPD was the third leading cause of death globally and ninth in disability-adjusted life years. all hospitalizations between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 registered in the database of the department of health of Catalonia were analyzed. discharge codes for admissions involving acute exacerbation of COPD according to the International Classification of Diseases were selected. the collected data included age, sex, geographic location, length of stay, hospital mortality, comorbidities, and destination at discharge. the data collected included mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, along with humidity and precipitation. in order to decrease the noise, these values were considered by weekly means. the numbers of hospitalizations for COPD were also stratified by month and seasonality. Stratified air quality values oscillate between less than 50 (very poor air quality), 49 to 0 (poor), 1\u201325 (low), 26\u201350 (acceptable), 51\u201375 (satisfactory) and 76\u2013100 (excellent) a lower score corresponds with increased air pollution17. the real shape of the model was previously investigated by a general additive model. the determination coefficient was used to measure the quality of the models. the average age of patients hospitalized for COPD was 74.511.4 years, with 77.3% being male. Autumn n=2,367 P-value Sex (male) 75.4% 2,766 (75.9%) 1,789 (76.2%) 1,087 (75.2%) 1,751 (74%) NS Weekly hospitalization, n 188.580.2 283.894.4 181.029.3 110.315.4 179.126.6 0.001 Age, years (SD) 74.910.5 75.410.0 75.110.3 74.811.0 74.211.0 0.001 Length 9.8 0.001 ICQA mean 6.56.0 57.38.0 49.26.2 54.16.5 53.68.3 0.001 ICQA minimum 2.91.7 43.69.1 40.57.9 41.212.5 43.411.6 0.001 Hospital mortality 1.41.4 110 (3%) 78 (3.3%) 61 (4.2%) 61 (2.6%) 0.05 Note: data are expressed as the mean standard deviation or percentage. we did not find differences between the pattern of temperature and hospitalizations between Barcelona city and its metropolitan area (P=0.08, Figure 5). despite being located in the same geographic area, temperatures in Barcelona were slightly higher than in the metropolitan area (urban heat island effect) over the year, the mean score obtained on the Catalonian Air Quality Index scale was 42.510.2. 858 admissions occurred in weeks in which air quality was considered low (more pollution), 6,481 (66.1%) during weeks when it was estimated as acceptable, and 2,645 (26.1%) during periods when it was rated as satisfactory (less pollution). direct evidence of the relationship between temperature and hospitalizations is scarce. most epidemiological studies exploring the influence of temperature on cardiorespiratory diseases have focused mainly on the effect of heat. studies that have specifically analyzed COPD exacerbations show that numbers increase in the winter months, including the number of hospitalizations for exacerbation of COPD. a study performed in Bavaria, Germany, showed an increase of 1% in outpatient visits for COPD for each Fahrenheit degree decrease. most respiratory viral infections in the northern and southern regions of the world have a seasonal pattern not observed in the tropics. most respiratory viral infections in the northern and southern regions of the world have a seasonal pattern not observed in the tropics. these respiratory infections are more common in winter, both in COPD patients and in the general population. the definition of discharge codes based on ICD-9 is used in all previous studies using this methodology. this limitation is common to all studies performed with the same methodology, and is partially compensated for by the large sample size. ICQA Based on the concentration of pollutants listed in Table S1, the lowest level (worst air quality) of O3, PM10, CO, SO2, and NO2 was selected. the mean average of all pollutants is considered the daily ICQA. available from: http://mediambient.gencat.cat/ca/05_ambits_dactuacio/atmosfera/qualitat_de_laire/avaluacio/icqa/que_es_lindex_catala_de_qualitat_de_laire."}
