{"summary": "a rich body of research [1],[2],[3] has provided major insights into the processes that drive epidemics. the structure of contact networks is crucial in explaining epidemiological patterns seen in the spread of directly transmissible diseases such as HIV/AIDS [1],[4],[5], SARS [6],[7], influenza [8],[9],[10],[11] etc. simulated and empirical social networks show how community structure affects epidemic dynamics in networks with community structure. results show how community structure affects the spread of diseases in networks with community structure. the average epidemic size, epidemic duration and the peak prevalence of the epidemic are strongly affected by a change in community structure connectivity. value range of Q found in empirical networks used further below. lower values of Q do not affect the results qualitatively. effects of community structure on epidemic dynamics. each stacked bar represents the cumulative number of new cases during a given day. the color of a single infection case denotes the infection generation (initial case = 0), i.e. the number of hosts through which the infection has been passed on before infecting the current case. identification of community bridges can be achieved using the betweenness centrality measure [38], defined as the fraction of shortest paths a node falls on. degree and betweenness centrality are often strongly positively correlated, but the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality becomes weaker as community structure becomes stronger. color code denotes the difference in the average final size Sm of disease outbreaks in networks that were immunized before the outbreak using method m. a positive difference indicates that the betweenness centrality method resulted in smaller final sizes than the degree method. if the difference is not bigger than 0.1% of the total population size, then no color is shown (white) based on random walk centrality significantly outperforms immunization based on degree especially when vaccination coverage is low. the bars show the difference in the average final size Sm of disease outbreaks ( cases) in networks that were immunized before the outbreak using method m. the acquaintance method has been shown to be able to identify some of the highly connected individuals. we propose an alternative algorithm that aims to identify community bridges connecting two groups of clustered nodes. the algorithm follows a random path on the contact network, until it arrives at a node that does not connect back to more than one of the previously visited nodes on the random walk. the acquaintance method outperformed the acquaintance method in large areas of the parameter space. if outbreaks are mostly restricted to single communities, then the acquaintance method may at least find some well connected nodes in each community and will thus perform slightly better. the acquaintance1 method is not shown - the acquaintance1 method is always faster, but significantly less effective. discussion A great number of infectious diseases of humans spread directly from one person to another person, and early work on the spread of such diseases has been based on the assumption that every infected individual is equally likely to transmit the disease to any susceptible individual. the structure of networks is often not known, and many networks are too large to compute centrality measures efficiently. this is true not only for the strategy based on the CBF algorithm, but for most strategies that are based on network properties. a wide range of fields and is not limited to infectious disease dynamics only. the edges between the nodes represent the contacts along which an infection can spread. each node can be in one of three possible states: (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, or (R)esistant/immune (as in standard SIR models) d3 is the mean network degree, i.e. the average number of contacts per node. the difference in the degree is too small to be of relevance here. we generated networks with 2000 nodes from scratch with varying degrees of community structure. we initialize a network by creating 50 small-world communities. each node has exactly 8 edges connecting to nodes of the same community. the average degree of the network is 10, which is in line with recent reports. the quantity (CV)2 is the square of the coefficient of variation in degree. it is important for the spread of infectious diseases since it is known that where 0 is the value of R0 under the assumption of a homogenous network (i.e. no variance in the degree distribution) the networks thus reduce to the following contact networks: Caltech (620 nodes and 7,255 edges, Q = 0.788) Princeton (5,112 nodes and 28,684 edges, Q = 0.753) Georgetown (7,651 nodes and 79,799 edges, Q = 0.662), and Oklahoma (10,386 nodes and 163,225 edges, Q = 0.914) deterministic algorithms We identifiy target nodes by ranking nodes to one of the three following criteria: degree, betweenness centrality, and random-walk centrality. the degree of a node simply denotes the number of edges incident to a node. the first algorithm, acquaintance immunization, has been described by Cohen et al. [42] and it works as follows: pick a random node v0, and then pick a random acquaintance v1, i.e. a randomly picked neighboring node of v0. each acquaintance will be immunized immediately. a random walk follows the path starting from v0 to v1 and v2. it starts checking for connections of v2 to v0 and v1. v2 is dismissed as a potential target, and the random walk continues to v4. each node can be in one of three possible states: (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, or (R)esistant/immune (as in standard SIR models) each node can be in one of three possible states: (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, or (R)esistant/immune. if recovery occurs, the state of the recovered node is toggled from infected to resistant. this approximation is in line with the result from static network theory [47], R0T(k2>/k>1), where k> and k2> are the mean degree and mean square degree respectively. eij is the fraction of all edges in the network that connect to nodes in community j. ai represents the fraction of edges in the network that connect to nodes in community j. ai represents the fraction of edges in the network that connect to nodes in community j. we've tested if all networks thus created consist of only a single connected component. the quantity (CV)2 is the square of the coefficient of variation in degree. the data contains the friendship network at five US universities. the networks thus reduce to the following contact networks: Caltech (620 nodes and 7,255 edges, Q = 0.788) Princeton (5,112 nodes and 28,684 edges, Q = 0.753) Georgetown (7,651 nodes and 79,799 edges, Q = 0.662) Oklahoma (10,386 nodes and 163,225 edges, Q = 0.914) deterministic algorithms identifiy target nodes by ranking nodes to one of the three following criteria: degree, betweenness centrality, and random-walk centrality. the degree of a node simply denotes the number of edges incident to a node. the first algorithm, acquaintance immunization, has been described by Cohen et al. [42] and it works as follows: pick a random node v0, and then pick a random acquaintance v1, i.e. a randomly picked neighboring node of v0. random walk follows path starting from v0 to v1 and v2. algorithm picks two random neighbors of v3 to check for connections to previously visited nodes. v3 is identified as a potential target and immunizes the potential target. deterministic algorithms We identifiy target nodes by ranking nodes to one of the three following criteria: degree, betweenness centrality, and random-walk centrality. the degree of a node simply denotes the number of edges incident to a node. the first algorithm, acquaintance immunization, has been described by Cohen et al. [42] and it works as follows: pick a random node vi = 0 and then pick a random acquaintance v1, i.e. a randomly picked neighboring node of v0. a random walk follows the path starting from v0 to v1 and v2, at which point it checks for connections of v2 to v0 and v1. v2 is dismissed as a potential target, and the random walk continues to v4. v4 does not back-connect to any previously visited node. the initial creation of these networks was identical to those created for Figure 1a in the main text. instead of rewiring between-community edges, we randomly rewired within-community edges. edges must always fall between two distinct nodes, and there can only be one edge between any two pair of nodes."}
