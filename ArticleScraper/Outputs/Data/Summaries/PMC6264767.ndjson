{"summary": "natural and synthetic coumarins play an important role in plant biochemistry and physiology. they act as antioxydants, enzyme inhibitors and precursors of toxic substances. they are also involved in the actions of plant growth hormones and growth regulators, the control over the respiration and photosynthesis. the present study is focused on the antiviral activity evaluation of the benzylidene-bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) derivatives 1\u201315 and 3-[6-oxo-(1H)-benzopyrano[4,3-b]benzopyrano[4,3-b]benzopyran-7-yl]-4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives 16\u201320. coumarin-dimer derivatives with variously substituted aryl central linkers (1\u201315) and fused benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16\u201320 were also synthesized for their antiviral activity evaluations. hydroxyl protons, which were observed between 11.8 and 12.3 ppm for benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16, 18 and 20, are most likely involved in hydrogen bonds. no NOEs indicative of relative orientations of individual heterocyclic moieties were observed for 20. benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16, 18 and 20 showed two sets of signals in the 1H spectrum for coumarin protons. the coumarin rings are slightly distorted from planarity, with two planes inclined at 57.83(11)\u00b0 and 59.55(5)\u00b0 to each other in 7 and 9, respectively. the 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties are intramolecularly hydrogen bonded between hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms in both structures. the distance between the ring centroids of coplanar C5\u2032\u2013C10\u2032 rings in 9 is 3.6832(12), the planes are separated by 3.5132(8) and centroids offset is ca. 1.11.
