{"summary": "MS accounts over 2.5 million affected individuals with an estimated cost of US$2\u20133 billion per annum. the further north or south from the equator the higher the prevalence of MS. countries that lie on the equator have extremely low prevalence compared to Scotland, Norway, and Canada. 85% of all MS patients which involves relapses followed by remission. primary progressive MS (PPMS) affecting 8\u201310% of patients, noted as gradual continuous neurologic deterioration. progressive relapsing MS (PRMS) the least common form. sclerotic plaques (lesions) may form in any location of the CNS white matter or grey matter, often leading to physical disability and sometimes, decline in cognitive ability [16,18]. sclerotic plaques (lesions) may form in any location of the CNS white matter or in grey matter, often leading to physical disability and sometimes, decline in cognitive ability. myelin-reactive auto-T cells cross the BBB [19] and their migration into the CNS consequently initiates an inflammatory cascade followed by demyelination of the CNS and axonal damage. white matter lesions appear in the white matter inside the visual neuron, basal ganglia, brain stem and spinal cord [26], where information is collected, and transferred to the rest of the body [25,27]. iNKT cells express cell surface markers characteristic of activated or memory T cells (CD25, CD44, CD69) cytokines are secreted that are associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses and play a role in both innate and acquired immunity. cytokines are secreted that are associated with both innate and acquired immunity. iNKT cell numbers are decreased in patients with MS [32] and are restored in patients in remission [33] protection of EAE development is associated with high levels of iNKT cells and suppression of Th1 and Th17 cells. vNKT cells recognize the self-glycolipid, sulphatide, which is abundantly expressed within the myelin sheath. innate immune system to defend against microbial infections. they are present in the liver, lungs, mucosa and blood and make up to 25% of CD8 T cells in healthy individuals. they also support adaptive immune responses in that they have a memory like phenotype. anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody in Lewis rats reduced clinical signs of MOG-EAE [46,47] injection of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody in Lewis rats results in Treg cell expansion and reduction in EAE disease severity [48] e phenotype of mice (F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+iNOS+) and human (CD40+CD86+CD64+CD32+) is induced in the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma and/or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and primarily secrete IL-1, IL-6 anti-inflammatory and express mannose receptor (CD206) and CCL22. in MS brain lesions, an intermediate microglia phenotype is present expressing CD40, CD74, CD86 and CCL22 but not CD206 markers. suppression of CCL22 decreased M1 macrophage accumulation in the CNS, thus therapies designed to suppress CCL22 have the potential to decrease demyelination. Th1, Th9, Th17 cells are key contributors to MS by increasing inflammation within the milieu of the myelin site. otype and secrete IL-13, IL-22 and TNF-alpha and (v) the new addition to the Th subset, Th9, was identified for its potent secretion of IL-9. IL-9 and IL-9 knockout mice are protected from developing EAE. IL-17A is present at high levels in CNS lesions, cerebrospinal fluid and in the serum of patients with MS. IL-17A interferes with the remyelination process. in 40 patients with RRMS, circulating plasma IL-27 levels were significantly higher compared to healthy control subjects. IL-27 and IL-27R are elevated in post-mortem MS brain lesions. nitric oxide, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were secreted, promoting Th1 polarization, suggestive that IL-27 enhances microglia neuroinflammation. CD8 T cells secrete high levels of IL-17 and TNF-alpha and low IFN-gamma. in peripheral blood of patients with SPMS and RRMS elevated levels of Tc1 and Tc17 cells are noted. it is clear that CD8 T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. in patients with MS the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid and brain parenchyma is a consistent finding in over 95% of patients. over 50 antibodies isolated from patients with MS did not react to MBP, PLP or MOG. in patients with MS, DCs are abundantly present within inflamed lesions, cerebrospinal fluid and in the circulation. the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, CD40 and CD80 on DCs are increased in RRMS and SPMS patients. however, MDSC have strong immunosuppressive properties rather than immune-stimulatory properties. two subsets of NKT cells have been identified. iNKT cells express cell surface markers characteristic of activated or memory T cells. cytokines are secreted that are associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses and play a role in both innate and acquired immunity. iNKT cells play a role in protecting the host against pathogens, tumors, autoimmunity and are involved in tissue rejection, ischemia reperfusion injury and obesity related diabetes. deficiency or dysfunction of iNKT cells has been shown to be linked to the development of autoimmune diseases. MAIT cells are a subset of T cells of the innate immune system to defend against microbial infections. they are present in the liver, lungs, mucosa and blood and make up to 25% of CD8 T cells in healthy individuals. they also support adaptive immune responses in that they have a memory like phenotype. Tregs are primarily characterized as Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ and are anti-inflammatory (secrete IL-10) one of the first evidence of the role of Treg cells in MS was in mouse EAE models. adoption of Treg cells from control mice into MOG or PLP induced EAE mice prevented the onset and progression of EAE [43,44] macrophage phenotype of mice (F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+iNOS+) and human (CD40+CD86+CD64+CD32+) is induced in the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma and/or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) M1 microglia cells are pro-inflammatory and express CD40, CD74, CD86 and CCR7. in MS brain lesions, an intermediate microglia phenotype is present expressing CD40, CD74, CD86 and CCL22 but not CD206 markers. fasudil (a selective Rho kinase inhibitor), injected into mice shifted M1 to M2 macrophages. Th1, Th9, Th17 cells are key contributors to MS by increasing inflammation within the milieu of the myelin site. mannan conjugation of self-MBP, PLP or MOG native peptides or altered peptide ligands, are able to divert Th1 responses to Th2 responses. IL-9 and Th9 cells induce EAE and inflammation in mice. IL-17A is present at high levels in CNS lesions, cerebrospinal fluid and in the serum of patients with MS. IL-17A interferes with the remyelination process. in 40 patients with RRMS, circulating plasma IL-27 levels were significantly higher compared to healthy control subjects. nitric oxide, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were secreted, suggesting that IL-27 enhances microglia neuroinflammation. suppressing IL-27 may be a strategy to modulate inflammatory responses in patients with MS. classical Tc1 cells secrete IFN-gamma, Tc2 secrete IL-4, Tc10 secrete IL-10, Tc17 secrete IL-17, Tc21 secrete IL-21, Tc22 secrete IL-22 and another subset is secreting TNF-alpha. CD8 T cells are found in great abundance within CNS tissues and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS. in patients with MS the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid and brain parenchyma is a consistent finding in over 95% of patients. over 50 antibodies isolated from cerebrospinal fluid from patients with MS did not react to MBP, PLP or MOG. DCs are abundantly present in inflamed lesions, cerebrospinal fluid and in the circulation. in patients with MS, DCs produce high levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-6. expression of co-stimulatory molecules, CD40 and CD80 on DCs increased in RRMS and SPMS patients. the use of ex vivo cultured MDSCs could be a viable strategy to develop new improved treatments against MS. the majority of the treatments for MS are long term mainly suppressing the immune system. such immune-suppressants pose increased risk for infections and cancer. KAY Copaxone\u00ae 20 mg or 40 mg 1/day, s.c Blocks pMHC 3/week, s.c Dimethyl fumarate Tecfidera\u00ae 240 mg 2\u20133/day, oral Anti-inflammatory Anti-oxidative stress Teriflunomide Aubagio\u00ae 7 or 14 mg 1/day, oral Inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, T, B cells and IFN-secreting T cells Fingoli treatment of MS has been a challenge with treatment options being limited mainly to corticosteroids, the potent alkylating agent cyclophosphamide and potent immunosuppressant methotrexate. in mid-1990s, a big shift was carried to treatment. the first disease-modifying drug for RRMS, interferon beta-1(IFN-1) was the primary key breakthrough for the treatment of MS [98,99]. disease-modifying agents intend to modify the course of the disease rather than improving symptoms. lymer glatiramer acetate, amgen/Serono\u2019s (Novantrone; mitoxantrone), azathioprine, cyclophosphamide (Endoxan\u00ae) and Natalizumab\u00ae an a4-integrin antagonist. disease-modifying drugs have been shown to reduce the rate of relapses, reduce MRI lesions and stabilize or delay MS disability. IFN- balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and decreases the number of inflammatory cells crossing the blood brain barrier. IFN- reduces Th17 population and IL-17 cytokine which are known to be involved in the immunopathophysiology of MS. FN-1a and IFN-1b decreased lesions up to 30% and reduced formation of new lesions up to 50%. but the study failed to show any reduction in disability progression in patients. side effects range from local body aches, skin reactions (swelling, redness), fever, myalgia, flu-like symptoms to more serious side effects. BG-12 reduces the migration of inflammatory cells through the blood brain barrier and activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (nrf2). side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, abnormal liver enzymes and decreased lymphocyte counts. teriflunomide was approved by the FDA in 2012 and by EMA in 2013 for use in patients with RRMS. fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which acts as a super agonist of S1P receptor causing receptor internalization. it targets SIP receptors on glia cells in the CNS, activating signaling pathways within the CNS. mitoxantrone is a type-II topoisomerase inhibitor, which disrupts DNA synthesis and DNA repair of cancer cells. it is a potent immune suppressant, suppressing T cells, B cells and macrophages and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2) interfering or blocking 4-integrin affects immune cell migration across the blood brain barrier. natalizumab reduced brain lesions and the rate of disability progression up to 24 months. natalizumab was approved by the FDA in 2004. ofatumumab is the first fully human type 1 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody. it is currently licensed for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. it has also been shown to be beneficial to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, follicular non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, diffuse B cell lymphoma and MS. ofatumumab demonstrated high efficacy in reducing new MRI lesion activity more than 90% and was well tolerated in patients with MS. the adaptive study design of both trials was recently presented by Hauser SL and colleagues at the American Academy of Neurology in Boston, USA. alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD25. it blocks the IL-2 receptor on the surface of T cells, preventing activation of T cells. in recent years it has re-emerged to treat patients with RRMS. treatment options are limited to corticosteroids, the potent alkylating agent cyclophosphamide and potent immunosuppressant methotrexate. the first disease-modifying drug for RRMS, interferon beta-1(IFN-1) was the primary key breakthrough for the treatment of MS [98,99]. treatment options include alemtuzumab (depletes lymphocytes), daclizumab (blocks the cytokine receptor IL-2), dimethylfumarate (combines features of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive actions), fingolimod (modulates the sphingosine-receptor system), natalizumab (inhibits the migration of lymphocytes) and teriflunomide (inhibits activated T and B cells IFN- is primarily produced by fibroblasts but other cells such as NK cells, B cells, T cells, macrophages also secrete IFN-. the mechanism by which IFN- acts is that it balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and decreases the number of inflammatory cells crossing the blood brain barrier. IFN- reduces Th17 population and IL-17 cytokine which are known to be involved in the immunopathophysiology 1a low dosage (Avonex\u00ae), IFN-1a (Rebif\u00ae) high dosage, and IFN-1b (Betaseron\u00ae, Extavia\u00ae) high dosage. pegIFN--1a has polyethylene glycol linked to IFN--1a. fewer injections are required compared to Avonex\u00ae, Rebif\u00ae, Betaseron\u00ae and extavia\u00ae. acetate is a synthetic 4-mer peptide (l-glutamic acid, lysine, alanine, and tyrosine) mimic of MBP. it competes with short antigenic MBP peptides in complex with MHC class II. but instead it suppressed EAE, which was quickly translated into human trials with MS in order to prevent disease progression. teriflunomide is an active metabolite of leflunomide. it inhibits the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase [124] and inhibits the proliferation of B and T cells. teriflunomide exerts anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting IFN-gamma producing T cells. fingolimod targets receptors on glia cells in the CNS, activating signaling pathways within the CNS. fingolimod was more effective compared to first line treatment IFN-1a and placebo. side effects include bradycardia (within 6 h after treatment initiation), blurred vision, diarrhea, back pain, headache, cough and vomiting. several side effects are associated with mitoxantrone which range from nausea, vomiting, hair loss, to cardiotoxicity, leukemia, infertility, infection, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. there is a limit on the cumulative lifetime dose to be administered to patients. IFN- injection subcutaneously or intramuscularly to patients with RRMS aims to decrease the relapse rate, duration and severity. however, there is lack of efficacy to long-term disability. a, flu-like symptoms to more serious side effects such as suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, seizures and heart and liver problems. many patients have stopped treatment and overall the benefit of using IFNs is relatively small. BG-12 reduces the migration of inflammatory cells through the blood brain barrier and activates nuclear factor erythroid. BG-12 protects neuronal cells from oxidative stress by increasing glutathione levels and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines from splenocytes in vitro. side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, abnormal liver enzymes and decreased lymphocyte counts. teriflunomide exerts anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting IFN-gamma producing T cells. fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which acts as a super agonist of S1P receptor causing receptor internalization. it targets SIP receptors on glia cells in the CNS, activating signaling pathways within the CNS. fingolimod was more effective compared to first line treatment IFN-1a and placebo, in reducing the frequency of flare-ups. in patients with SPMS, intravenous injection of 12 mg/m2 mitoxantrone every 3 months up to 2 years resulted in reduced disability progression by 84%. but several side effects are associated with mitoxantrone which range from nausea, vomiting, hair loss, to cardiotoxicity, leukemia, infertility, infection, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. natalizumab reduced brain lesions and the rate of disability progression up to 24 months [12,145]. natalizumab decreased by 92% of contrast-enhancing lesions, by 83% of new or expanding T2-weighted lesions and by 76% in new T1-weighted hypointense lesions. other side effects include hepatotoxicity, allergic reactions and increased risks of infection. the use of anti-CD20 antibodies would conceivably improve MS relapses and progression. ofatumumab binds to 2 unique novel epitopes on the CD20 molecule. ofatumumab demonstrated high efficacy in hematologic malignancies. clinical trials in patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis were halted due to high rates of infections. in patients with MS, there was an increased risk of breast cancer (6/781 females with MS on ocrelizumab compared to 0/668 females with MS in other trials) daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-2 receptor expressed on the surface of T cells. the mechanism by which daclizumab works is that it blocks the IL-2 receptor on T cells, preventing the activation of T cells. in recent years its use has re-emerged to treat patients with RRMS. natalizumab is administered intravenously once a month. it reduces activated T cells within the CNS, resulting in anti-inflammatory responses. natalizumab reduced brain lesions and the rate of disability progression up to 24 months. al antibody is currently licensed for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. it has also been shown to be beneficial to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, follicular non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and diffuse B cell lymphoma. ofatumumab is being investigated in 2 Phase III trials (ASCLEPIOS I AND ASCLEPIOS II) and are recruiting patients with relapsing forms of MS. the adaptive study design of both trials was recently presented by Hauser SL and colleagues at the American Academy of Neurology in Boston, USA. MRI measures were free of clinical disease longer, compared to IFN-1a. alemtuzumab can cause serious side effects including immune thrombocytopenia, kidney problems, serious infusion problems. it was approved by the FDA in 2014 to be used in RRMS patients, but due to the frequent adverse events of alemtuzumab. use of non-specific immunosuppressive drugs as described in section 3 is a promising approach to fight autoimmune diseases including MS. HSCT in patients with active RRMS, reduce progression in about 70% of patients, decrease relapses dramatically and suppresses inflammatory MRI activity. HSCT \u201creboots\u201d the immune system and thus, prevents inflammation associated with the disease. the mechanism of action of MSC includes immunomodulation, neuroprotection and neuroregeneration [162]. the use of MSCs that reduce MRI parameters is a new and emerging research focus to develop new improved treatments for MS. poly(-caprolactone) nanoparticles loaded with recombinant human MBP reduced IFN-gamma cytokines, reduced the clinical score and showed only mild histological changes of the myelin sheath [171]. Hence, nanoparticles as a delivery method of self-antigens are a promising tool to treat MS. three patients showed exacerbations to disease of which two were linked to CGP77116 injection with high IFN-gamma and low IL-4 (Th1-skewing) were secreted by activated CD4+ T cells. these CD4+ T cells also cross reacted with the native agonist MBP83\u201399 peptide. further pre-clinical testing is required and new modified peptides need to be designed. cyclic[A91A96]MBP83\u201399 peptide and cyclic[A91A96]MBP83\u201399 peptides emulsified in CFA induced IL-4 cytokines in guinea pigs and Lewis rats. double mutation of K91, P96 to R91,A96 or single mutation of P96 to A96 (APL of either in their linear or cyclic forms, results in suppression of EAE and decreased inflammation in cyclic forms were more stable to lysosomal enzymes and induced high levels of IL-10 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with MS. recently, cyclic native agonist MOG35\u201355 peptide was shown to ameliorate clinical and neuropathological features of EAE in mice compared to its linear counterpart. thus, cyclic peptides, which offer greater stability, are novel leads for the immunotherapy of many diseases, such as MS. native agonist peptide, however, only the double APL [R91, A96]MBP83\u201399 induced IL-4 secretion by T cells against the native MBP83\u201399 peptide. mannan conjugated to the immunodominant agonist MOG35\u201355 peptide primes non-pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells and ameliorates EAE in mice. stem cells are isolated from an adult\u2019s bone marrow, are differentiated in vitro for 2\u20133 weeks and re-injected back into the patient. the mechanism by which HSCT works is that HSCT \u201creboots\u201d the immune system and thus, prevents inflammation associated with the disease. the mechanism of action of MSC includes immunomodulation, neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. the use of MSCs that reduce MRI parameters is a new research focus to develop new improved treatments for MS. poly(-caprolactone) nanoparticles loaded with recombinant human MBP reduced IFN-gamma cytokines, reduced the clinical score and showed only mild histological changes of the myelin sheath [171]. Hence, nanoparticles as a delivery method of self-antigens are a promising tool to treat MS. three patients showed exacerbations to disease of which two were linked to CGP77116 injection with high IFN-gamma and low IL-4 (Th1-skewing) the problems noted with both NBI-5788 and CGP77116 were likely due to inadequate pre-screening of APL effects on the many clonotypes against the targeted epitopes. double mutation of K91, P96 to R91,A96 or single mutation of P96 to A96 (APL) results in suppression of EAE and decreased inflammation in the spinal cord of Lewis rats. single and double cyclic[A91]MBP83\u201399 peptide and cyclic[A91A96]MBP83\u201399 peptide and cyclic[A91A96]MBP83\u201399 peptides emulsified in CFA induced IL-4 cyclic native agonist MOG35\u201355 peptide was shown to ameliorate clinical and neuropathological features of EAE in mice compared to its linear counterpart. thus, cyclic peptides, which offer greater stability, are novel leads for the immunotherapy of many diseases, such as MS [66]. mannan conjugated to the immunodominant agonist MOG35\u201355 peptide primes non-pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells and ameliorates EAE in mice. mannan is able to divert immune responses from Th1 to Th2. cyclic peptides are a useful template towards the rational design and development of non-peptide mimetics. cyclic peptides are not only a step towards non-peptide mimetics but also as putative therapeutics in MS. double mutation of K91, P96 to A91, A96 in either linear or cyclic forms were also shown to be active. cyclic native agonist MOG35\u201355 peptide was shown to ameliorate clinical and neuropathological features of EAE in mice compared to its linear counterpart. re-injection into patients induces strong cellular and clinical responses in ovarian cancer patients [186,187] due to the immunomodulatory properties of mannan, its effects as a carrier to MS peptides were determined. only the double APL [R91, A96]MBP83\u201399 induced IL-4 secretion by T cells. mannan conjugated to the immunodominant agonist MOG35\u201355 peptide primes non-pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. mannan is able to divert immune responses from Th1 to Th2. mannan is a promising carrier for further studies for the development of immunotherapeutics against MS. ed leading to demyelination and disease progression are also etiological factors that contribute to disease. a number of treatment options are available to patients with MS, in particular those with active disease. but due to side effects, limited long term effectiveness and inability to reverse disease, new treatment options are required."}
