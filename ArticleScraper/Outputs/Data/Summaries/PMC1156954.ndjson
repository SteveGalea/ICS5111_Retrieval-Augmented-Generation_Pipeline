{"summary": "SARS patients had increased cellularity of BALF with increased alveolar macrophages (AM) and CD8 cells. HRCT scores increased significantly in 10 of 12 patients, with normalization of BALF cell counts in 6 of 12 patients. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected more than 8 thousand patients. in the acute phase, typical pathological findings in the lungs include mononuclear cells infiltration, alveolar cell desquamation and hyaline membrane formation. inflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in SARS [5]. inflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in SARS. all the patients met the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition of SARS. all the patients met the modified centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) case definition of SARS. maintenance steroid therapy (prednisolone 10 mg twice a day for more than 3 weeks) was given after pulse or short course corticosteroid therapy. two patients were intubated with ventilator support because of hypoxemic respiratory failure. each lung zone (total of 6 lung zones) was assigned a score, modified from previously described [9], based on 0 when no involvement, 1 when 25% involvement, 2 when 25 50% involvement and 4 when 75% involvement. the grading of the patient's chest radiograph and HRCT was the consensus of two observers who were blind to clinical information. the relative ratio of CD4 or CD8 in CD3-positive cells was assayed by a dual-color analysis. data were acquired and analyzed using becton Dickinson BD LYSYS II and Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) software. levels of cytokines and chemokines in BAL fluid were assayed using an antibody against one of five cytokines. the ultra-thin sections were cut from Epon-embedded blocks, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. the ultra-thin sections were cut from Epon-embedded blocks and examined using a transmission electron microscope. nine non-smoking volunteers were selected as controls for the study. none of them had any upper respiratory tract infection within the last 6 weeks or was on antibiotics or other medications at the time of evaluation. two patients were intubated with ventilator support because of hypoxemic respiratory failure. patients underwent HRCT and BAL on the 60th and 90th day after the onset of disease. fibreoptic bronchoscopy and BAL BAL were performed on all the study subjects using six aliquots (50 ml each) of 0.9% saline solution. sterile solution was introduced into the subsegmental bronchus of the most severely involved lobe. the supernatant was stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis and the cell pellet was washed and resuspended at 106 cells per ml. levels of cytokine and chemokine in BAL fluid were assayed using becton Dickinson (BD) Cytometric Bead ArrayTM [17] (CBA; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions with an antibody (PharMoingen, San Diego, CA) against one of five cytokines (Human Chemokine Kit: CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES, C analysis was performed using SPSS software version 10.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) 28 patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS were admitted during the study period. sixteen patients received intubation and ventilatory support for respiratory failure. the other 7 SARS patients had HRCT abnormality > 10% of each lung field. the most prominent HRCT findings were ground-glass attenuation (80.8 12.2% of total abnormality on HRCT) and consolidation (13.6 10.9% of total abnormality on HRCT) Factor Low HRCT score and Absence of virus particle (n = 5) no.

IP-10 and MIG recruit monocytes and macrophages, NK cells and activated, but not resting T lymphocytes. absence of neutrophil infiltration in influenza A virus or respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) infection is attributed to suppression of neutrophil attracting CXC corticosteroids have been shown to increase mortality of pneumovirus-infected mice by accelerating replication of virus. a proportion of recovered SARS patients have delayed resolution of pneumonitis and delayed clearance of coronavirus in the alveolar space. hospital."}
