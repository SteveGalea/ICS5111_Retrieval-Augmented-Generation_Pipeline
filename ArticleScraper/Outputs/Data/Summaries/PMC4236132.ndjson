{"summary": "the astroviruses belong to the Astroviridae family, consisting of non-enveloped viruses whose plus-sense, single-stranded polyadenylated genome of approximately 7 kb is organized in three open reading frames (ORFs) ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 [1], [2], preceded and followed, respectively, by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of 80 to 100 nucleo several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), La autoantigen (La), poly (A) binding protein (PABP), poly-r (C)-binding proteins (PCBP1/2) also known as hnRNPE2, cellular protein eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and Nucleolin, might be involved in viral replication [10]\u2013[17]. immunoprecipitation assays identified PTB in the 57/60-kDa bands. recombinant PTB was cross-linked to 3\u2032UTR probes containing intact helix I. recombinant PTB was localized mainly in the cytoplasm of HAstV-8 infected cells. extracts were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. proteins were quantitated with the Bradford assay kit (Sigma) PCR reactions were done in presence of 10 M of DNA duplex for full-length 3\u2032UTR, HI/mPTB, and mPTB. the PCR mix contained 10 M of each oligonucleotide, 10 mM dNTPs, 25 mM MgCl2 and 2 U of Dream Taq polymerase. the same conditions were used for the unrelated RNA (REST) control template. amplification of the expected products was monitored on agarose gel. each 32P-labeled RNA probe (1105 cpm) was incubated at 4\u00b0C in crosslink binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 80 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 124 mM KCl, 20% Glycerol) RNA-protein complexes were irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 20 min on ice. a nontarget siScrambled (160 nM) was used as a negative control. the concentrations used for siPTB were 2.5 M and 5 M. samples were harvested for RNA isolation, western-blotting and virus titer determination. cDNA was quantified using the GloMax Multi Detection System. 500 ng of cDNA was used by the PCR step in a final reaction volume of 20 l. reaction was performed three times for each sample using a Rotor Gene 6000. cells were washed in PBS- 50 mM NH4Cl, incubated with secondary antibodies anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa-Fluor 594 at 1700 dilution (Invitrogen), Fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG at 175 dilution. cells were visualized under lasser confocal microscopes LSM710 (Carl Zeiss) and Olym CaCo2 cells were infected with HAstV-8 strain Yuc 8. proteins were quantitated with the Bradford assay kit (Sigma) extracts were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. DNA duplexes were generated using the respective primer sets HAstV-8-F/HAstV-8-R (spanning nt 6674 to 6759 from strains Yuc8; accession AF260508), mPTB-fwd/mPTB-rev (UCUU PTB binding site within nt 6700 to 6704 changed to CGAA), and HI/mPTB-fwd (TAATACGACTCACTATA PCR mix contained 10 M of each oligonucleotide, 10 mM dNTPs (Roche), 25 mM MgCl2 and 2 U of Dream Taq polymerase in the appropriate buffer. incubation times and temperatures were: 2 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C denaturation, annealing for 1 min at 52\u00b0C and extension 1 min at 72\u00b0C. polyclonal antibodies to hnRNP1 and goat-IgG anti-rabbit-HRP (Zymed) non-related antibodies were preincubated for 15 min in the binding reaction. UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation assays were carried out using protocols previously described [15] with modification. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTB, qRT-PCR and viral titration. RNA and Proteins were quantitated with 660 nm Protein Assay Reagent. the conserved ORF1a region was analyzed (nt 1182\u20131470) and simultaneously expression of the glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene as a control. cDNA was quantified using the GloMax Multi Detection System. 500 ng of cDNA was used by the PCR step in a final reaction volume of 20 l. anti-CQFG antibody was used (1100 dilution) to monitor HAstV8 infection. cells were seeded in an 8-well chamber slide plate (Chamber-Slide System, Nunc) and grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 72 h. cellular proteins bind to the 3\u2032UTR of HAstV-8 RNA. integrity of the secondary structure of the 3\u2032UTR facilitates recruitment of cellular and viral factors to the VRC. only the structure of HAstV-1 3\u2032UTR has been described only [9], [8] therefore we analyzed the predicted structures of as many HAstV sequences available. the 3\u2032UTRs of all astrovirus contain one consensus UCUU PTB binding site (light gray) and a second UCUC element PTB (dark gray) hybrids indicate gaps in the sequence. RNA structures of the viral 3\u2032UTR of all HAstVs were predicted with the MFold software. RNA binding of cellular proteins to the 3\u2032UTR RNA sequences seems to be non-specific, since it was competed both by homologous and heterologous RNAs without PTB/hnRNP1 binding sites. complex CI and specific complex CII are indicated. g of S10 from uninfected (lane 2) or HAstV-8-infected CaCo2 cells were separated by SDS-10%PAGE and detected by autoradiography. western blotting with monoclonal anti-Actin and polyclonal anti-Lamin A antibodies detected seven proteins of 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa from both cell extracts. complex CIII is slightly enriched in infected cells suggesting that PTB/hnRNP1 is present in the complexes recruited in the 3\u2032UTR RNA. in steady state cells, PTB/hnRNP1 functions in mRNA transport and stability as well as IRES-mediated translation. confocal microscopy of PTB/hnRNP1 shows same nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling of PTB/hnRNP1. phosphorylation at Ser-16 modulates nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. VP34 capsid protein was not detected in mock infected cells. uninfected (U) and infected CaCo2 cells cytoplasmic and nuclear cell extracts (8 h p.i.) prepared as described in Figure 2D were probed with monoclonal anti-PTB and polyclonal anti-hnRNP1 antibodies by western blotting. cells were fixed at 12 h p.i. and were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence. NP1 antibody suggests the presence of PTB/hnRNP1 in the RNA-protein complex formed by astrovirus 3\u2032UTR. no proteins were detected in the precipitation controls (anti-hnRNP1 antibody only, lane 3; non-related antibody, lane 4; protein G-Sepharose only, lane 6); or non-related antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose. PTB/hnRNP1, cellular proteins and probably viral proteins, from membrane fractions were sufficient for 3\u2032UTR HAstV-8 RNA-protein complex formation. Western blot were probed with anti-hnRNP1, anti-Actin, anti-PDI and anti-Lamin A antibodies. radiolabeled wt and mutant 3\u2032UTR probes were used in UV cross-linking experiments with recombinant His-PTB. the wt 3\u2032UTR probe rendered strong 60 and 62 kDa bands that disappeared when the UCUU PTB binding site was mutated to CGAA. rPTB signals were barely apparent when probe H1/mPTB was used. HAstV-8 3\u2032UTR (A), mPTB (B), HI (C) and HI/mPTB (D) were incubated with 0.50 and 1 g of recombinant His-PTB or 1 g of BSA (C) free probes are shown in lanes 1 and F, respectively. nRNP1 knockdown expression was observed in the nuclei of transfected CaCo2 cells with the scrambled siRNA. in contrast, PTB was absent from the nuclei of siPTB treated cells. a 77% reduction of PTB protein expression was achieved with 2.5 M of siPTB. cells resulted in a 42% reduction of viral production (7106 ffu/ml) with siPTB compared with siScrambled-transfected cells (1.8107 ffu/ml) this result is consistent with the knockdown of host cell proteases. astroviral RNA negative strand synthesis appears 12 hours post-infection. nsP1b signal intensity was quantified by densitometry. signal intensity is expressed as percent of expression reduction with respect to actin signals. RNA level of HAstV-8 was determined by qRT-PCR. HAstV-8 3\u2032UTR structure is arranged in two helixes (I and II) connected through a linker. split the 3\u2032UTR facilitated comparisons between strains. helix II nucleotide variations were found. cellular proteins bound to the 3\u2032UTR in positive-strand RNA viruses play important roles in assembling the viral RNA replication complex. among them are PTB, EF-1, La, Nucleolin, Sam68, PABP, PCBP1/2 and TIA-1/TIAR [38]\u2013[40], [15], [41]\u2013[43], [17]. the complete 3\u2032UTR and mPTB version consisting of nt 6,674 to 6,759, H1 and HI/mPTB shorts versions consisting of nt 6,674 to 6,706. the versions HI/mPTB and mPTB have a UCUU PTB binding site within nt 6700 to 6704 changed to CGAA. ed HAstV-8 3\u2032UTR (nt 6674 to 6759) was UV cross-linked to uninfected and infected cells. seven proteins of 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa from both cell extracts were bound to the probe. stronger signals of individual proteins of infected cell extracts were observed. PTB/hnRNP1 is maintained in the cytoplasm upon cellular stress, such as viral infections. in steady state cells, PTB/hnRNP1 also functions in mRNA transport and stability. western blot and co-localization assays were carried out with anti-hnRNP1 and anti-PTB antibodies. the redistribution of PTB/hnRNP1 is due to phosphorylation at Ser-16. phosphorylation modulates the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. nsp1a/4 phosphorylation capacitates nsp1a/4-RNA polymerase interaction for the establishment a productive infection by HAstV-8. the HAstV-8 infected positive cells were labeled with anti-HAstV CQFG sera (red) nuclei are shown by DAPI (blue) staining. the images of cell were acquired with a confocal lasser scanning microscope. RNA-protein complex formation appears to require the presence of an intact PTB/hnRNP1 binding site. these results suggest that RNA-protein complex formation appears to require the presence of an intact PTB/hnRNP1 binding site. s of uninfected or HAstV-8 infected CaCo2 NP-40 cell extracts were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. supermobility shift assay from uninfected or HAstV-8 infected cells were incubated without (lane 2) or with anti-hnRNP1 (lane 3) or with a non-related antibody (lane 4) after of the 3\u2032UTR labeled RNA ( rPTB signals were barely apparent when probe H1/mPTB was used. a PTB dimer binds face-to-face to the wt UCUU site. a band about 35 kDa was observed with the unrelated RNA probe. uninfected CaCo2 cells were first transfected with siRNAs against PTB. the levels of PTB/hnRNP1 expression were monitored by western-blot and immunofluorescence analysis. the expression of both PTB/hnRNP1 isoforms was reduced at least 10-fold. the viral RNA polymerase (nsP1b) protein expression was lower in 2.5 M siPTB-treated than siScrambled-treated cells. the level of viral negative strand RNA in cells transfected with siPTB was reduced dramatically (90%), in comparison with siScrambled. strand synthesis appears 12 hours post-infection, coincident with the detection of the positive strand RNA and the ORF2 subgenomic RNA. the amount of plus-sense sgRNA is tenfold greater than the minus-sense replicative intermediary RNA [52], which is translated into capsid proteins used for packaging of new viral particles [37]. caco-2 cells were mock-transfected (M) or transfected with the indicated siRNA (A) the Y axis represents the virus release percentage of 15 hours post infection after 72 hours post-transfection time. the Y axis represents the virus release percentage of 15 hours after 72 hours post-transfection time. microscopy Olympus Fv300 (C) (TIF) Click here for additional data file."}
