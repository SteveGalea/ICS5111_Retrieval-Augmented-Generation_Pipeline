{"summary": "translation initiation can be described as a scanning model triggered by a cap- and 5\u2019 end-dependent mechanism. the scanning machine recognizes and binds to the methylated 5\u2019-end cap structure of a mRNA and scans linearly downstream until it reaches an AUG codon for the initiation of protein translation. the IRES element can be applied in development of bi-cistronic expression vector, an important tool for the biotechnology. we have developed an IRES search system that combined two RNA structure prediction models. comparative sequence analysis has a 97% accuracy of base pairs in ribosomal RNA secondary structures, and minimum free energy structure prediction can predict the structure of a single RNA sequence. however, comparative sequence analysis is not useful to predict the mRNA regulatory motifs such as IRES. there are twelve IRES models built upon consensus sequences in Rfam database. the RNA structure prediction will therefore be useful to enhance the accuracy of de novo secondary structure prediction of IRES elements. previous IRES search system (IRSS) can provide up to 72.3% accuracy of secondary structure prediction for IRES group 2. pknotsRG calculates pseudoknot score from potential IRES structures. RNA secondary structure comparison matches the known IRES structures executed by RNA Align program [18]. pknotsRG calculates pseudoknot score from potential IRES structures. two output files, Aligned structure and Alignment score files, were generated by RNA Align software. the perl script, run_pknotsRG.pl, re-formats all predicted RNA structures into input format of pknotsRG software. the predicted figure of RNAL fold program and text results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were shown as web page. poliovirus (accession number: AF177037), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV; accession number: X87335) and cricket paralysis virus (accession number: AF218039) were input in the VIPS as training data. randomly selected 500 virus genome data from NCBI were applied to test VIPS to predict IRES elements of whole viral genomes. the standard structures were fetched from four known groups of IRES elements based on cricket paralysis virus (group 1, accession number: AF218039), Hepatitis C virus (group 2, accession number: AF177037), Encephalomyocarditis virus (group 3, accession number: X74312.1) and Poliovirus (group 4, accession number: V01148.1).

VIPS will be a useful internet resource for IRES elements location before experimental studies. table format can be read by Microsoft\u00ae Word\u00ae program. table format includes all positive records of four IRES groups searched by VIPS."}
