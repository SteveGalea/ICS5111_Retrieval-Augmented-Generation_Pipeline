{"summary": "white matter network alterations have increasingly been implicated in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. the aim of this study was to identify shared and distinct white matter network alterations among the 3 disorders. 123 patients with schizophrenia, 123 with bipolar disorder, 124 with major depressive disorder and 209 healthy controls. postmortem, genetic and MRI studies have shown white matter pathology across the 3 disorders. oligodendrocyte density, oligodendrocyte function and myelin abnormalities have been associated with white matter integrity. MRI studies have found commonalities in alterations in white matter integrity among schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and MDD. schizophrenia > bipolar disorder > MDD in terms of extent of change. participants were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient department of psychiatry. participants were assessed using the non-patient version of the SCID. this study was approved by the Medical Science Research Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University. MRI acquisition We performed MRI scans using a 3.0 T GE Sigma system (General Electric) with a standard 8-channel head coil. network node definition We used an automated anatomic labelling (AAL) atlas to parcellate the brain\u2019s cortical and subcortical structures into 90 regions. each region represented a node of the white matter network. global network efficiency is defined as the mean of the inverse of the shortest path length for all nodes in the network. global network efficiency is defined as the mean of the inverse of the shortest path length for all nodes in the network. nodal efficiency is defined as the average inverse of the shortest path length between node i and all other nodes in the network39 E nodal G (i ) = 1 N - 1 i j G 1 L ij where N represents the number of nodes for the whole network. healthy controls were recruited from the local region via advertisement. each participant was assessed using the non-patient version of the SCID to confirm that they had no current or lifetime Axis I disorder or history of Axis I disorders in first-degree relatives. two neuroradiologists with more than 3 years of experience interpreting neuroradiology images checked image quality. MRI preprocessing The data set was preprocessed using PANDA. the procedure consisted of 2 basic steps: definition of nodes and definition of edges. we determined that an edge existed if at least 3 tracts had terminal points between the 2 nodes. we obtained a 90 90 fractional anisotropy weighted metric for each participant. each region represented a node of the white matter network. we determined that an edge existed if at least 3 tracts had terminal points between the 2 nodes. we obtained a 90 90 fractional anisotropy weighted metric for each participant. the local efficiency of node i ( E loc i ) is defined as the global efficiency of Gi. a given node i is defined as the number of edges attached to the node. it indicates a node\u2019s direct connection with other nodes in the network. global network efficiency is defined as the mean of the inverse of the shortest path length for all nodes in the network. for a given network G with N nodes, global network efficiency is defined as: E glob G = 1 N ( N - 1 ) i G 1 L ij where Lij is the shortest path length between node i and node j. of the shortest path length between node i and all other nodes in the network39 E nodal G (i ) = 1 N - 1 i j G 1 L ij. N represents the capacity of node i to communicate with other nodes in the network.
