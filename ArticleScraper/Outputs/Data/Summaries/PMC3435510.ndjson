{"summary": "genus Brucella is a group of Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria that cause brucellosis, a reproductive disease in ruminants, and undulating fever in humans. innate and adaptive immunity have been described as contributing to the control of Brucella infection. toll-like receptors (TLRs) induce the production of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines through NF-B, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as a result, TLR signaling is critical to development of the host innate immune response. the role of TLR4 in Brucella infection remains controversial. some studies suggest that TLR4 is required to control replication in the mouse. some studies suggest that TLR4 is required to control Brucella replication in the mouse. experiments were undertaken to determine the role of TLR signaling in the control of Brucella infection following aerosol exposure. the current study, investigates the roles of TLR2, TLR4 and MyD88 in clearance of Brucella following respiratory exposure. failure to clear Brucella from organs by TLR signaling deficient mice could be due to defects in the development of adaptive immunity. mouse model of infection Breeding pairs of TLR2/, TLR4/, and MyD88/ mice were obtained from Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) all mice were housed in BSL-3 suite in the CMP at Texas A&M University. mice were euthanized and lung, spleen and liver were collected and homogenized in 1 ml each of sterile water containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20. the experimental limit of detection was determined to be 10 CFU per lung, spleen or gram of live. anti-brucella antibodies including IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, and IgA were evaluated using ELISA. ELISA plates were coated with B. melitensis 16 M cell lysate. non-specific binding was blocked via incubation with 5% non-fat milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. B. melitensis 16 M was cultured in TSB for 24 h, pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 g, washed with and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) at a density of approximately 5 109 CFU/ml. all mice were housed in BSL-3 suite in the CMP at Texas A&M University. aerosol exposure of mice was generated via nebulization of a Brucella suspension (5 109 CFU/ml in PBS) into a Madison chamber. one group of mice (n = 5) were immediately euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. RPMI-1640 contains 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 1 mM non-essential amino acid, 100 g/ml of penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin. cell suspension was dispensed to 24-well plates with 1 ml/well and stimulated with heat killed Brucella (HKB) or ConA (2 g/ml) for three days. non-specific binding was blocked via incubation with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in PBS. the wells were incubated 2 h at room temperature (25\u00b0C) with mouse sera diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T) 200 times for IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, IgA detection or 1000 times for IgG detection. TLR2, TLR4/, MyD88/ and C57BL/6 mice were aerosol exposed to B. melitensis 16 M. by week 4 p.i., there was a significant difference in the clearance of the organism from each of the knockouts. this pattern persisted through week 10. bacterial burden in 9 of 13 spleens from TLR4/ and 10 of 13 from MyD88/ mice below detection limit (10 cfu/spleen) bacterial burden in 9 of 13 spleens from TLR4/ and 10 of 13 from myD88/ mice is evident in the spleen and less dramatically in the liver. groups of TLR2/, TLR4/, MyD88/ and C57BL/6 mice were aerosol exposed to B. melitensis 16 M. the spleens were collected at weeks 1 (panel W1), 2 (panel W2), 4 (panel W4), 6 (panel W6), 8 (panel W8). the livers were collected at weeks 1 (panel W1), 2 (panel W2), 4 (panel W4), 6 (panel W6), 8 (panel W8) and 10 (panel W10) post infection. the data were pooled from four separate experiments. 8 weeks p.i. were stimulated with heat killed Brucella or Con A. IFN- levels in the culture supernatants were determined via ELISA (B) total Brucella-specific IgG in wild-type mice is detectable starting 4 weeks post-infection. elevation of the Brucella specific IgG levels is delayed in all of the knockout mice. by week 10, TLR2 and C57BL/6 mice produce significantly elevated levels of IgG1. indicating TLR2 is not required for IgG1 production. a significant difference in bacterial burden is detectable by week 4. by week 4 p.i., there was a significant difference in the clearance of the organism from each of the knockouts. this pattern persisted through week 10, although significance is lost due to the reduction in the number of animals available at this time point. the delay in systemic spread of infection is evident in the spleen and less dramatically in the liver. bacterial burden in 9 of 13 spleens from TLR4/ and 10 of 13 from MyD88/ mice below the detection limit (10 cfu/spleen) this compares with a delay in only 1 of 17 TLR2/ mice and 5 of 20 C57BL/6 mice. bacterial loads were determined at weeks 1 (panel W1), 2 (panel W2), 4 (panel W4), 6 (panel W6), 8 (panel W8) and 10 (panel W10) post infection. the results were pooled from four separate experiments. the livers were collected at weeks 1 (panel W1), 2 (panel W2), 4 (panel W4), 6 (panel W6), 8 (panel W8) and 10 (panel W10) post infection, and bacterial loads were detected. the data were pooled from four separate experiments. IgM levels begin to decline in the MyD88/ and C57BL/6 mice at 4 weeks p.i. and IgM levels in the TLR2/ and TLR4/ mice plateau at 4 weeks with a gradual decline by 10 weeks p.i. IgG levels increase in TLR4/ and TLR4/ mice by 10 weeks p.i. to levels that are not significantly different from the control C57BL/6 mice. serum IgA is not detected in the TLR2/ and TLR4/ mice, nor in C57BL/6 mice out to week 10. IgG2a levels in TLR2 and MyD88 knockout mice are significantly reduced relative to control mice. the Th2 response in TLR2 knockout mice is significantly elevated compared to wild type mice at 10 weeks p.i. involvement of different TLRs is expected to affect cytokine production. previous studies have shown that Brucella infection induces a TH1 response during acute disease. Brucella express a protein TcpB (or Btp1) that restricts the proinflammatory response by interfering with MyD88 function. the result is enhanced degradation of MAL (MyD88-adapter-like protein) IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4), one of the kinases recruited by MyD88 upon stimulation, is not required for generation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN- in the late stage of Brucella infection. the contribution of humoral immunity to the outcome of Brucella infection is controversial. this phenomenon has been previously reported in mice orally vaccinated with attenuated Salmonella expressing a Streptococcus pneumoniae surface antigen. it could prove useful to understand the biological mechanism involved and its potential application to vaccine design. the contribution of either elevated IgA or suppressed IgG to the inability of MyD88 knockouts to control infection is under investigation. a recent study by weiss et al. shows that production of Brucella specific IgG is delayed in TLR2 and TLR4 knockout mice and impaired in MyD88 knockout mice. possible reasons for the discrepancies include the use of different Brucella species, B. melitensis 16 M vs B. abortus S19. the results confirm MyD88 as a critical factor in the control of Brucella infection in the spleen. recent results indicate that Brucella may be recovered from the lung following i.p. inoculation. however, caution is warranted in interpretation of the significance of host factors. previous study has shown that Brucella can use TLR4 to gain entry into the host cells. it is possible that Brucella inhibit IgA class switch recombination or secretion via MyD88 by an unknown mechanism."}
