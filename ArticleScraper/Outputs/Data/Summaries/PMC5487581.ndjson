{"summary": "ZIKV is a member of the Flaviviridae family with a positive-sense RNA genome of about 10 kb. it expresses a single polypeptide which is proteolytically processed into 3 structural (C, prM, and E) and 7 nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins. since its discovery in 1947 (3), ZIKV innate immunity is thought to govern both viral replication and pathogenesis. innate antiviral effectors, such as type I and type III interferons, are capable of suppressing ZIKV replication. aberrant activation of innate immunity also results in inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. KV NS5 protein was recently shown to suppress type I IFN signaling by targeting STAT2 for degradation (33, 34). STAT2 is known to form a heterotrimeric complex with STAT1 and IRF9 to activate IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) regulated by type I and type III IFNs (35) both cell lines are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection (12) they might be physiologically more relevant to the placental and neurological effects of ZIKV infection. both cell lines have also been used extensively in the study of virus-host interactions. the level of viral RNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. bars represent the means for three biological replicates, and error bars indicate SD. RF1 and CXCL10 transcripts were normalized to that of ZIKV RNA. differences between bars 5 and 6 in panels F and G were statistically significant. ZIKV infection induced the expression of IRF1 and CXCL10 mRNAs in JEG3 and SF268 cells. the potentiating effect was most prominent in the case of CXCL10 mRNA in SF268 cells. both IRF1 and CXCL10 were induced by Sendai virus in SF268 cells. two independent and prevalidated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were employed to knock down IFN- signaling more specifically. effective knockdown of IFNGR2 mRNA by these siRNAs resulted in attenuation of ZIKV RNA replication. IFNGR2 mRNA and viral RNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. difference between the values for bars 1 and 3 in panel B was statistically significant (**) NS5 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN-induced activation of ISRE-Luc activity among all NS proteins. NS1 and NS2B might also have weak to moderate suppressive effects on ISRE-Luc. expression of NS5 alone was sufficient for inhibition of IFN- and IFN- signaling. 16 were statistically significant (**) by Student's t test. the suppressive effect of ZIKV NS5 on IFN-induced activation of ISRE activity was dose dependent (Fig. 4A) and was comparable to that of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) NSs. ZIKV NS5 is capable of suppressing type I and type III IFN signaling. but activating type II IFN signaling is unlikely to be mediated through NF-B. NS5 selectively destabilized STAT2 but had no influence on STAT1 protein stability. NS5 selectively destabilized STAT2 but did not affect steady-state amount of STAT2 mRNA. NS5 induces K48-linked polyubiquitination of STAT2. indicated proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells for 48 h. results are representative of four biological replicates. NS5 was expressed in JEG3 (A) and HeLa (B) cells for 24 h and then treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 30 min. cells were fixed and stained with anti-V5 for NS5, anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT2. NS5 promotes STAT1 homodimerization and recruitment to ISG promoters. a decrease in STAT2 protein level would certainly affect the formation and activity of the STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 complex that activates ISRE. expression of NS5 correlated with destabilization of endogenous STAT2 but did not affect steady-state levels of exogenously expressed STAT1-myc or STAT1-Flag. NS5 and STAT2-myc were expressed in HEK293T cells for 24 h. cell lysates were collected, and immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with anti-Flag. a weak STAT1 band was seen in the absence of NS5, whereas STAT1 was not detected when NS5 was found. the activation of GAS-Luc activity by IFN- in U6A cells was robust and was ablated by reexpression of STAT2. NS5 destabilizes STAT2 to potentiate STAT1-mediated activation of IFN- signaling. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed with anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT2 antibodies. recruitment of STAT1 and STAT2 to ISRE in HEK293 cells was dampened. both cell lines have been used extensively in the study of virus-host interactions and interferon responses. antiviral activity of IFN- in ZIKV-infected JEG3 cells was not seen when the 12-h treatment with IFN- started 12 h after infection. bars represent the means SD for three biological replicates. differences between bars 2 and 3 and between bars 2 and 4 were statistically significant (**) by Student's t test. ZIKV and its NS5 protein were shown to suppress the induction of ISGs by IFN- (32, 33), but the levels of some ISGs were still elevated in ZIKV-infected cells (17, 22, 24, 30, 31) the suppression of type I IFN signaling by ZIKV might be incomplete. the potentiating effect was most prominent in the case of CXCL10 mRNA in SF268 cells. both IRF1 and CXCL10 were induced by Sendai virus in SF268 cells. however, selective augmentation of IFN- signaling was unique to ZIKV and was not seen in SF268 cells. two independent and prevalidated small interfering RNAs were employed to knock down IFN- signaling more specifically. effective knockdown of IFNGR2 mRNA by these two siRNAs resulted in attenuation of ZIKV RNA replication. the levels of IRF1 and CXCL10 transcripts in infected cells were further normalized to the amount of ZIKV RNA. the levels of IRF1 and CXCL10 transcripts in infected cells were further normalized to the amount of ZIKV RNA. NS1 and NS2B may also have weak to moderate suppressive effects on ISRE-Luc. expression of NS5 alone was sufficient for inhibition of IFN- signaling. HEK293 cells were transfected with an ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid. ZIKV NS5 effectively blunted IFN-1-induced activation of ISRE. this suppressive activity was comparable to that of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) NSs. the difference between bars 3 and 4 was statistically not significant (n.s.) the difference between bars 3 and 4 was statistically not significant (n.s.) NS5 selectively destabilized STAT2 but had no influence on STAT1 protein stability. hek293 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132. NS5 selectively induces STAT2 ubiquitination and degradation. immunoprecipitation of NS5-containing protein complexes was performed with an anti-V5 antibody. NS5 was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5. both NS5 and STAT2 were present in the precipitate. NS5 was expressed in JEG3 (A) and HeLa (B) cells for 24 h and then treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 30 min. cells were fixed and stained with anti-V5 for NS5, anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT2 for 30 min. expression of NS5 correlated with destabilization of endogenous STAT2. expression of NS5 correlated with destabilization of endogenous STAT2. expression of NS5 correlated with destabilization of endogenous STAT2. immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with anti-Flag. input lysates and precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. a weak STAT1 band was seen in the absence of NS5, whereas STAT1 was not detected when NS5 was found. NS5 blocked IFN-induced formation of the STAT1-STAT2 complex but facilitated IFN-induced assembly of the STAT1-STAT1 complex. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed with anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT2 antibodies. recruitment of STAT1 and STAT2 to ISRE in HEK293 cells was dampened. recruitment of STAT1 to ISRE in the MxA, OAS1 and ISG15 gene promoters was boosted. STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation is induced by type I and type II IFNs. degradation of STAT2 by ZIKV NS5 relieves the inhibition of STAT1. this leads to augmentation of STAT1 homodimerization. the balance between type I and type II IFN signaling in virus-infected cells was previously recognized and was shown to be tightly regulated by cellular protein kinases, such as IKK (56). the interplay between ZIKV NS5 and IKK merits further analysis. treatment of a549 cells with IFN- for 6 h before infection had no inhibitory effect on viral replication. this should be evaluated further, as in our recent work on bromocriptine (64). a better understanding of the implications of NS5-induced activation of IFN- signaling might provide new strategies for therapeutic intervention. a better understanding of the role of ZIKV NS5 in selective activation of IFN- signaling may provide new strategies for therapeutic intervention. a reduction or complete loss of STAT2 in NS5-expressing cells had a potentiating effect on STAT1 homodimerization and recruitment to GAS. a new model in which unphosphorylated STAT2 binds to unphosphorylated and phosphorylated STAT1 to prevent its nuclear translocation and activation. the new model in which unphosphorylated STAT2 binds to unphosphorylated and phosphorylated STAT1 to prevent its nuclear translocation and activation (52). a549 cells were treated with 10 U/ml of IFN- for 12 h. infection with ZIKV at an MOI of 5 for 6 h neither activated nor suppressed the activity of IFN- on GAS-Luc. however, there was no control to show the activation of GAS by IFN- in that experiment. further investigations are warranted to clarify the discrepancies. modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
