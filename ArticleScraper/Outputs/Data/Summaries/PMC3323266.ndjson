{"summary": "233 of the 238 patients with reported probable cases of SARS in Singapore were cared for at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from April 30 to May 30, 2003. the government designated this hospital for all SARS-infected patients. urine and stool specimens were delivered within 12 hours of collection. nine milliliters of blood was collected in tubes with gel serum separators. weekly collections of all specimens were repeated until 42 days after discharge. serum samples were retested for immunoglobulin (Ig) G by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero cells spotted onto microscope slides. onset of illness was defined as the day of onset of fever. specimens collected from day 15 to 21 of illness were thus grouped into week 3 of onset of illness. sterile swab was used to collect throat secretions from the fornices and back of the throat. a spatula was used to depress the tongue during the procedure. the swab was immediately placed in a bottle containing Hank's viral transport medium. real-time PCR instrument targeted the polymerase gene of SARS-CoV. positive results were verified, with two other primer pairs also targeted at the polymerase gene of SARS-CoV. the mean age of all SARS patients in Singapore was 35 years (range 1.3\u201390 years), and 32.4% were male. most patients (89%) were recruited after week 4 of illness. the five patients with positive viral RNA in stool specimens had a mean age of 31.6 years; two (40%) required supplemental oxygen. no patients were admitted to intensive care. Mean peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 811 U/L. bRT-PCR was performed by using the RealArt HPA-coronavirus RT-PCR kit (Artus Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany) patients 3 and 62 provided one sample each and withdrew from the study immediately thereafter. 3 of 32 patients who did not receive ribavirin had SARS-CoV detected by RT-PCR. the remaining RNA-positive samples were from patients who did not report diarrhea symptoms during their hospital stay. ten of our participants had a history of chronic illnesses. the mean age of all SARS patients in Singapore was 35 years (range 1.3\u201390 years), and 32.4% were male. most patients (89%) were recruited after week 4 of illness. any result was deemed positive if it was detected by both the RealArt HPA-coronavirus RT-PCR kit (Artus Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany) the five patients with positive viral RNA in stool specimens had a mean age of 31.6 years; two (40%) of the five patients required supplemental oxygen. bRT-PCR was performed by using the RealArt HPA-coronavirus RT-PCR kit (Artus Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany) patients 3 and 62 provided one sample each and withdrew from the study immediately thereafter. 3 of 32 patients who did not receive ribavirin had SARS-CoV detected by RT-PCR. the remaining RNA-positive samples were from patients who did not report diarrhea symptoms during their hospital stay. ten of our participants had a history of chronic illnesses. a positive RT-PCR result in these patients would be more important compared to those recovering in the hospital. weekly tests were conducted to assess this risk by using molecular diagnostic methods. this information will assist clinicians in planning a reasonable time for serologic testing in patients with suspected cases of SARS. in a later study, Chan et al. (11) reported that viral RNA was detected in 5% of stool samples submitted after week 7 of illness. tracheal aspirates, nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat washings, nasal swabs, pooled throat and nasal swabs were detected at week 8 of illness. we identified severity of illness by a history of supplemental oxygen use, admission to intensive care, or a high peak LDH. but in our study patients, age, supplemental oxygen use, and peak LDH were not statistically different between those who had positive stool samples and those who had negative stool samples. the number of intensive care patients in the study was small. ninety-three percent of patients seroconverted by day 30 (week 5) of illness. all patients received steroids (intravenous hydrocortisone, oral prednisolone, or pulse methylprednisolone) on diagnosis of SARS. RT-PCR determined that 5 (7.8%) of 64 patients continued to shed viral RNA in stool samples only, up to week 8 of illness. most seroconversions occurred by week 6 of illness."}
