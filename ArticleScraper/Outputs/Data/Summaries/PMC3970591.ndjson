{"summary": "patients were excluded if they were pregnant, younger than 18 years old or had either cardiac or neurologic disease. patients were randomlyised to receive either 500 mg chloroquine (300 mg base) BID or an identical-appearing placebo (starch) for three days. the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of Ribeiro Preto, University of So Paulo, process 12603/2006. the data are presented as the means standard deviations and number of patients (%) no significant difference in the duration of the disease or the intensity and days of fever among the dengue patients treated with either chloroquine or placebo. however, 12 (63%) of the dengue patients reported a substantial reduction in the intensity of pain and a great improvement in their ability to perform daily chores after taking chloroquine. antigen detection was positive; b: p > 0.05; c: axillary temperature was considered abnormal (fever) when 37.8\u00b0C; d: clinical variables were obtained active and objectively during a medical consultation. only two patients reported side effects and consisted of transient blurred vision in one and a loss of consciousness in the other. both patients were not confirmed to be dengue patients. chloroquine has been described in some viral infections, such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus) one possible explanation for the antiviral effect of chloroquine could be related to the impairment of viral replication by raising the intracellular pH. researchers observed a trend toward a lower incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in dengue patients treated with chloroquine. however, there was also no difference in the duration of disease or days of fever in dengue patients taking either chloroquine or placebo. a small number of dengue patients were included in the study. approximately 63% reported an improvement in their symptoms while on the medication. the side effects of chloroquine observed in this study were unremarkable. options for dengue treatment are very limited, we suggest that chloroquine should be further tested with a larger number of patients and different chloroquine dosages and times of administration."}
