RESULTS Expression and Purification of active ROP18 kinase proteins. the yeast has been successfully used to purify >400 active human and viral kinases. the GST-tagged ROP1883 and the kinase-dead mutant were expressed in yeast cells and purified. OP18 constructs GST-ROP1883 and GST-ROP1883-KD. kinase-dead mutant ROP1883-KD is a D394A-mutated version of ROP1883. 172 and 68 potential substrates of ROP18 kinase were identified using HuProt arrays. protein microarrays were washed to remove added proteins and unincorporated [-32P]ATP. films were then scanned, and bioinformatics analysis and partial validation were performed. 68 proteins identified on the HuProt arrays were putative ROP18 substrates under the condition of 2.5 S.D. a common means for a pathogen to hijack the cellular pathways is by targeting multiple components of the same host signaling pathways. 32 of the 68 identified substrates of ROP18 formed a tightly connected PPI network. p53 (i.e. TP53) is identified as the central hub located in the middle of the PPI network with 20 edges. 8 of the 31 ROP18 substrates were protein kinase themselves. 68 ROP18 targets (left panel), especially 32 of them with annotated PPI relationships, are significantly enriched in some biological functions. metabolic process, kinase activity/phosphorylation, response to growth factor, apoptotic process/cell death, and immune system process. analysis suggests that ROP18 is likely to play a pleiotropic role as a master kinase. ROP18 phosphorylates multiple kinases, including MAPK9, MAPK10, PDPK1, GSK3 and PRKAR1A. phosphorylation motif logo of ROP18 most similar to catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (i.e. CSNK2A1). 14 human kinases showed a significant similarity (p 0.01) with ROP18. four of these 14 kinases have a strong tendency to phosphorylate other kinases. STK3 showed the lowest p value, at least 10-fold lower than the second best one. two other kinases, RPS6KA6 and PRKX, were found to recognize a very similar acidic phospho-motif as ROP18. RSK4 acts as a downstream kinase of ERK1/2 that activates cell differentiation and cell survival processes. p53 is a master transcription factor and is known to respond to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes. p53 was colocalized with ROP18 at the PVMs in host cells. results showed that GST-ROP1883, but not the GST tag, was able to pull down p53. overexpression of ROP1883 but not ROP1883-KD significantly decreased the protein level of p53. infection of 293T cells with ROP18-Ty1 RH strain further extended degradation. results demonstrated that ROP18 relies on its kinase activity to inhibit apoptosis in T. gondii-infected cells. lysates of 293T cells infected with wild-type (WT) RH and ROP18-Ty1 RH strains were detected by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. p38 MAPK pathway has been linked to T. gondii invasion. 293T cells were infected with WT RH or ROP18-Ty1 RH strain. the results showed that infection with WT RH strain significantly reduced the p38 protein level. together, these results suggested that ROP18 targets p38 for degradation via phosphorylation. ation via Phosphorylation du et al. (13) reported that ROP18 inactivates the NF-B pathway via phosphorylation and degradation of p65. UBE2N is also a hub in the PPI network that is directly connected to p53, PDPK1, PELI3, ZFAND4 and NME2. ROP18 promotes degradation of UBE2N. 293T cells were transfected without or with wild-type (WT) RH or ROP18-Ty1 RH strain for 36 h. a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, suggested that ROP18 phosphorylation-induced Smad1 degradation was mediated by the proteasome. the results clearly showed that GST-ROP1883, but not GST-ROP1883-KD, strongly phosphorylated the His6-tagged Smad1 protein. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad1 mutants for 48 h. the protein levels of Smad1 mutants were detected by Western blotting. phosphorylation in the linker region of Smad1 has been shown to trigger its degradation. ser-187 mutation blocked the reduction of Smad1 protein levels induced by ROP18. results showed that transfection of ROP1883 significantly increased the phosphorylation level of Smad1 Ser-187. infection with the WT RH and ROP18-KO RH strain resulted in increased phosphorylation levels of Smad1 at Ser-187. the GST-tagged ROP1883 and the kinase-dead ROP18 mutant (D394A) were expressed in yeast cells and purified (Fig. 1A) both proteins showed a single band at the expected molecular weights, indicating that both proteins were successfully purified with high purity. ROP1883-KD proteins were expressed in yeast and purified using glutathione beads. purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with coomassie Brilliant Blue. proteins were then dotted on nitrocellulose membrane, followed by autoradiography. 172 and 68 potential substrates of ROP18 kinase were identified using HuProt arrays. purified GST-ROP1883 and GST-ROP1883-KD proteins were assayed on HuProt arrays in kinase buffer containing [-32P]ATP. films were then scanned, and bioinformatics analysis and partial validation were performed. 68 substrates identified using the above in vitro kinase reactions may not reflect in vivo kinase-substrate relationships. we first performed the STRING analysis (STRING.org) to determine whether there is any significant PPI network among these substrates. 32 of the 68 substrates of ROP18 formed a tightly connected PPI network with 54 edges. p53 (i.e. TP53) is located as the most connected hub in the center of the PPI network. 32 of the 68 identified substrates of ROP18 form a highly connected PPI network. TP53 is located as the most connected hub in the center of the PPI network. identified ROP18 substrates are indicated by circles with GO terms annotated in different colors using the same code as A. using the M3 algorithm, ROP18 was found to specifically recognize an acidic phospho-motif, which is most similar to CSNK2A1. p values of each human kinase are shown in the bottom panel. ROP18 seems to regulate two parallel MAPK signaling pathways (p = 1.2E-3) by targeting MAPKKK (i.e. MAP3K5) and p38 (i.e. MAPK11) and by targeting JNK2/3 (i.e. MAPK9 and MAPK10), which converge at p53 that leads to transcription activation of the p53 target genes (lower panel, Fig. 3C). four of these 14 kinases have a strong tendency to phosphorylate other kinases. only 57 of the 289 tested kinases showed a similar behavior. STK3 showed the lowest p value, at least 10-fold lower than the second best one. p53 was identified as a novel substrate of ROP18 in our in vitro kinase assays. p53 is a well known tumor suppressor involved in immunity. p53 was colocalized with p53 at the PVMs in host cells. GST-ROP1883, but not GST tag, was able to pull down p53. we performed coimmunoprecipitation assay and detected an interaction between ROP18 and p53. overexpression of ROP1883 but not ROP1883-KD significantly decreased the protein level of p53. lysates of 293T cells transfected with the indicated amounts of FLAG-p53 plasmids were detected by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. lysates of 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of V5-ROP1883 and 1 g of FLAG-p53 plasmids. ROP18-mediated p38 Degradation via Phosphorylation MAPK signaling has been reported to be involved in the infection of T. gondii (47, 48) the p38 MAPK pathway is known to be activated by cytokines, LPS, and environmental stress. 1 RH strain resulted in a more significant reduction of p38 protein level. together, these results suggested that ROP18 targets p38 for degradation via phosphorylation and degradation of p65. a secreted Shigella effector, OspI, was reported to specifically target Ubc13 and deamidates Gln-100 to a glutamic acid residue. this results in suppressing the diacylglycerol CBM TRAF6 NF-B signaling pathway and dampens the host inflammatory responses. we then investigated whether ROP18 affects UBE2N expression in vivo. ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD plasmids were infected for 36 h. lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. SAG1 and GAPDH were used as loading controls. GST-ROP1883, but not GST-ROP1883-KD, strongly phosphorylated the His6-tagged Smad1 protein. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD and FLAG-Smad1 plasmids. lysates were detected by Western blotting. G, 293T cells were transfected with V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD and/or FLAG-Smad1 for 48 h. Smad1 phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with phospho-Smad1 (Ser-187) antibody. transfection of ROP1883 significantly increased the phosphorylation level of Smad1 Ser-187. compared with the control vector, transfection of ROP1883 significantly increased the phosphorylation level of Smad1 Ser-187. no significant difference was observed upon transfection of ROP1883-KD. both proteins showed a single band at the expected molecular weights. both proteins showed a single band at the expected molecular weights. both were successfully purified with high purity. ROP18 substrates in Vitro contain 16,368 unique, full-length human proteins. phosphorylation signals on each array were detected by exposure to X-ray film (Fig. 2C) purified proteins tagged with GST were assayed on HuProt arrays in kinase buffer containing [-32P]ATP. after the kinase reaction, protein microarrays were washed to remove added proteins and unincorporated [-32P]ATP followed by exposure to X-ray films. bioinformatics analysis and partial validation were performed. the 68 substrates identified using the above in vitro kinase reactions may not reflect in vivo kinase-substrate relationships. a common means for a pathogen to hijack the cellular pathways is by targeting multiple components of the same host signaling pathways. we first performed the STRING analysis (STRING.org) to determine whether there is any significant PPI network among these substrates. 8 of the 31 ROP18 substrates were protein kinase themselves. only 105 of the total 1,967 substrates also phosphorylated others in the KSR networks. the majority of the KSR was determined by performing phosphorylation reactions on an early version of the human protein microarrays. 14 human kinases share a significant portion of targets as ROP18. we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to determine possible roles of ROP18 in pathogen-host interactions. 68 ROP18 substrates were significantly enriched in following biological functions. the acidic phospho-motif recognized by ROP18 is most similar to that of the catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (i.e. CSNK2A1), which tends to phosphorylate many other kinases. we compared the substrate similarity of ROP18 with the 289 human kinases in the PhosphoNetworks database. STK3 (also known as MST2) is a proapoptotic serine/threonine kinase. the cleaved N-terminal portion of STK3 goes to the nucleus. STK3 is activated by caspase cleavage of the auto-inhibitory domain. the cleaved N-terminal portion of STK3 goes to the nucleus. p53 was identified as a novel substrate of ROP18 in in vitro kinase assays. p53 is a master transcription factor and is known to regulate expression of target genes. p53 is also a well known tumor suppressor involved in immunity. overexpression of ROP1883 but not ROP1883-KD significantly decreased the protein level of p53. kinase activity is essential for ROP18-mediated p53 degradation. we cotransfected the FLAG-tagged p53 construct to 293T cells. GST pulldown assay was performed using GST-ROP1883 protein purified from yeast and lysates of 293T cells overexpressing FLAG-p53. lysates of 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD plasmids for 36 h. the p38 MAPK pathway has been linked to T. gondii invasion (50, 51) to confirm the association between ROP18 and p38, immunofluorescence staining was performed. results showed that GST-ROP1883 was able to pull down p38. 293T cells were infected without or with wild-type (WT) RH or ROP18-Ty1 RH strain for 36 h. d, 293T cells were infected without or with wild-type (WT) RH or ROP18-Ty1 RH strain. OspI was reported to specifically target Ubc13 and deamidates Gln-100 to a glutamic acid residue, leading to the disruption of TRAF6-catalyzed poly-ubiquitylation. this results in suppressing the diacylglycerol CBM TRAF6 NF-B signaling pathway and dampens the host inflammatory responses (55). lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. ROP18-mediated Smad1 Proteasomal Degradation via Phosphorylation Interference of the TGF- signaling pathway has been shown to be highly associated with Toxoplasma infection. 293T cells were transfected with V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD and/or FLAG-Smad1 plasmids for 36 h. total cell lysates were detected by Western blotting. Smad1 phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with phospho-Smad1 (Ser-187) antibody. phosphorylation in the linker region of Smad1 has been shown to trigger its degradation. phosphorylation in the linker region of Smad1 has been shown to trigger its degradation. no significant difference was observed upon transfection of ROP1883-KD. infection with the WT RH and ROP18-KO RH strain resulted in increased phosphorylation levels of Smad1 Ser-187. infection with ROP18-KO RH strain did not alter the phosphorylation status of Smad1 at Ser-187. commercially available EGFR kinases were used as a positive control. both ROP1883 and EGFR kinases showed auto-phosphorylation activity. kinase mutant ROP1883-KD is a D394A-mutated version of ROP1883. phosphorylation signals were detected by exposure to X-ray film. protein microarrays were washed to remove added proteins and unincorporated [-32P]ATP. protein microarrays were washed to remove added proteins. films were then scanned, and bioinformatics analysis and partial validation were performed. individually purified human proteins tagged with GST were spotted in duplicate on a single slide. 68 substrates identified using the above in vitro kinase reactions may not reflect in vivo kinase-substrate relationships. a common means for a pathogen to hijack the cellular pathways is by targeting multiple components of the same host signaling pathways (20), we first performed the STRING analysis (STRING.org) to determine whether there is any significant PPI network among these substrates. the majority of the KSR was determined by performing phosphorylation reactions on an early version of the human protein microarrays. these analyses indicate a tendency of ROP18 to act as a master kinase that regulates many host kinases and signaling components. TP53 is located as the most connected hub in the center of the PPI network. 68 ROP18 substrates were significantly enriched in following biological functions. metabolic process (p = 1.2E-5); kinase activity or phosphorylation (p = 5.6E-6); response to growth factor (p = 5.0E-5); apoptotic process or cell death (p = 6.1E-4); and immune system process (p = 2.9E-4). the acidic phospho-motif recognized by ROP18 is most similar to that of the catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (i.e. CSNK2A1), which is well known to be involved in many cellular processes, including apoptosis. we compared the substrate similarity of ROP18 with the 289 human kinases in the PhosphoNetworks database. a recent study by Wu et al. (41) suggested that ROP18 might manipulate the host mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. they observed that overexpression of T. gondii ROP18 significantly suppressed 293T cell apoptosis induced by actinomycin D. p53 is a master transcription factor and is known to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. p53 is also a well known tumor suppressor involved in immunity. overexpression of ROP1883 caused dose-dependent degradation of the exogenous p53 protein. we infected 293T cells with wild-type (WT) RH strain. infection of 293T cells with ROP18-Ty1 RH strain extended degradation. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD plasmids for 36 h. total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. lysates of 293T cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of V5-ROP1883 and 1 g of FLAG-p53 plasmids. the results revealed a colocalization of p38 and ROP18 at the PVMs. the results showed that GST-ROP1883 was able to pull down p38. this suggests that ROP18 interacts with p38. 293T cells were transfected with GST-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD plasmids for 36 h. total cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. we expressed V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD in 293T cells. overexpression of ROP1883 but not ROP1883-KD led to a significant reduction in the protein level of UBE2N. we then investigated whether ROP18 affects UBE2N expression in vivo. to determine whether ROP18 interacted with Smad1, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. we then investigated the influence of ROP18 on Smad1 expression. expression of ROP1883 but not ROP1883-KD markedly reduced the protein level of Smad1 in a dose-dependent manner. 293T cells transiently cotransfected with the indicated amounts of V5-ROP1883 or V5-ROP1883-KD and FLAG-Smad1 plasmids. lysates were detected by Western blotting. in previous studies, phosphorylation in the linker region of Smad1 has been shown to trigger its degradation. phosphorylation in the linker region of Smad1 has been shown to trigger its degradation (58, 59) infection with the WT RH and ROP18-Ty1 RH strain resulted in increased phosphorylation levels of Smad1 Ser-187. infection with ROP18-KO RH strain did not alter the phosphorylation status of Smad1 at Ser-187. these results suggested that ROP18 phosphorylates Smad1 Ser-187 to facilitate its degradation. the recombinant protein had to be refolded to obtain bioactivity. the refolded protein was unstable and could not be obtained in sufficient amounts. this finding paves a way for oncoming in-depth studies. infection of T. gondii results in alteration of protein expression in key metabolic pathways. the majority of ROP18 substrates are enriched in the metabolic process. this suggests an important role of ROP18 in manipulating the host cellular metabolism. proteins FLT1 (70) and PRKRA (71) involved in apoptosis and cell growth were also identified as the ROP18 targets. kinases are key regulators involved in multiple biological processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation. bioinformatics analyses based on our dataset suggest that ROP18 may serve as a master kinase modulating multiple host signaling pathways. ATF6 (12) and p65 (13) that have been reported to be the substrates of ROP18 were not identified in our assays. down-regulation of p53 results in impaired expression of genes involved in interferon or toll-like receptor signaling during viral infection. the deficiency of Gadd45 in mice results in impaired Th1 development due to the lack of p38 activation, IL-12, and CD40 production in dendritic cells and diminished Th1 immune response to T. gondii antigen (81). ubiquitin-dependent degradation of host protein indicates that ROP18 is involved in ubiquitylation-related signaling. previous studies have shown that UBE2N is essential for the immune signaling. in this study, we identified for the first time that Smad1 is a target of ROP18, but its function and mechanisms underlying the parasite virulence remain to be defined. it has been reported that manipulation of host cell targets by T. gondii contributes to its proliferation (90) we report for the first time that with the use of a human proteome array, the substrates of T. gondii ROP18 kinase were systemically identified. the approaches used in this study may offer new strategy for discovering novel host targets during host-pathogen interactions."}
