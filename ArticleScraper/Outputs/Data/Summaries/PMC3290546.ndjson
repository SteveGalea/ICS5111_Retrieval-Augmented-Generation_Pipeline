{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged zoonotic pathogen of the family Paramyxoviridae. it is distinguished by its ability to cause fatal disease in both animals and humans. the pathogenesis of NiV infection is still poorly understood. ten most strongly upregulated genes 8 h after NiV infection. we identified CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10, IP-10) chemokine promotes leukocyte trafficking by acting on T lymphocytes, NK and dendritic cells via its receptor CXCR3 [8] the expression of mRNA specific for NiV receptors ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 was readily detected in these cells. production of NiV structural genes coding for nucleoprotein, matrix, fusion protein, glycoprotein and polymerase increased rapidly during the infection. formation of large syncytia was rapidly detected in HUVECs and induces a significant cytopathic effect. qPCR analysis of NiV infection in HUVECs reveals 807 deregulated genes. the 538 up-regulated genes were classified according to their Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes and molecular functions. at 8 and 24 h post-infection for several genes linked to interferon pathway, including MXA, OAS1, IFN beta and CXCL10. the induction of the closely related chemokine CXCL11 (Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant, I-TAC or IP-9) was also confirmed by RT-qPCR. vig1; 2510004L01Rik NM_080657 radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 viral function 10.9 CXCL10; IFI10; IP-10 NM_001565 chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 immune response 10.9 OASL; TRIP14 NM_003733 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like immune response 10.8 R in 3 gene, exon 5. immune response 7.6 TAF4B AA457205 TAF4b RNA polymerase II, TATA box binding protein ass factor, 105 kDa cell signaling 8 ATP13A4 AW073336 ATPase type 13A4 unknown 10.3 BX108708 Transcribed locus unknown 12.3 IDS AK126415 CDNA FLJ44451 fis, UTERU2023039 unknown 13 BF47 expression of mXA, OAS1, IFN beta, CXCL11 and CXCL10 follows NiV replication in vivo. expression of mRNA follows NiV replication in vivo. the level of CXCL10 expression significantly correlated to the level of NiV N expression in analysed organs (p0.001). expression of CXCL10 and NiV nucleoprotein (N) genes in organs obtained from NiV-infected hamsters during the course of infection. non-infected patients and patients autopsied after lethal acute NiV-infection (B\u2013H) were analysed for expression of CXCL10 in endothelial cells in cerebral cortex (B, D, 1000, arrows) and cells with neuronal morphology (E, F) primary human endothelial cells are highly permissive to Nipah virus infection. formation of large syncytia was rapidly detected in HUVECs. highest level of production of infectious particles was obtained 24H after infection. cytopathic effect of NiV infects rapidly HUVECs. fected with either NiV or treated with mock preparation and RNA was taken 8 h p.i.. pair-wise comparisons between infected and uninfected genes revealed 807 deregulated genes (fold change cut-off = 1.3) the 538 up-regulated genes were classified according to their gene ontology (GO) biological processes and molecular functions. production of the third closely related chemokine CXCL9 (MIG), which shares the same receptor CXCR3 with CXCL10 and CXCL11, was not detected. ELISA showed up to 72 h of infection confirming the NiV infection induces the expression of CXCL10 at the protein level. ligand 10 immune response 10.9 OASL; TRIP14 NM_003733 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like immune response 10.8 RIG-G; IRG2; IFI60; ISG60; GARG-49 NM_001549 interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 immune response 10.4 IFIT2; G10P2; IFI54; GARG-39; ISG chromosome 2 open reading frame 17 unknown 44 BBS4 BF370543 Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 cancer 46.7 FLJ12986 AK126695 hypothetical protein FLJ12986 unknown FC: Fold Change. only changes higher then 5.7 and lower then 5.4 are presented. XCL10 mRNA follows NiV replication in vivo. hamster animal model closely reproduces human infection and induces lethal outcome. highest induction of mRNA expression was observed in the spleen. significant correlation was found between expression of CXCL10 and expression of NiV N. we have next performed immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues from patients that succumbed to NiV-infection during the outbreak in Malaysia in 1999. NS of patients with acute NiV encephalitis include neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and reactive microglia [7], which may all play an important role in NiV pathogenesis. recruitment of these cells indicates a possible action of chemokines, known as main regulators of leukocyte trafficking. a few other members of interferon type I pathway, including MxA, RIGI, 2\u20325\u2032-OAS 1 and 2, are highly expressed early after chemokines play opposing roles in neuroinflammation in different experimental models of infectious disease. infection with RNA viruses that may cause encephalitis in humans can directly induce the expression of chemokines by astrocytes and microglia and establish chemokine gradients that promote leukocyte trafficking within the CNS. in a mouse model of measles virus encephalitis, neuronal expression of CXCL10 was associated with T-cell recruitment, suggesting that neurons may play a role in the induction of immune responses to viral invasion. in contrast to our study, they cultured endothelial cells in the presence of hydrocortisone, known to have important anti-inflammatory activity and to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. lack of appropriate regaents for hamster animal model prevented us from further in vivo analysis of the role of CXCL10 during Nipah infection. this antagonist form of CXCL10 was very recently shown to play an important role in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus [44]. animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the French national charte on the ethics of animal experimentation. all animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice. astroglioma and vero cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES and 2 mM L-Glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. infection of HUVECs and titration Nipah virus (isolate UMMC1, Genebank AY029767) was prepared RNAs were obtained from 2 g of total RNA by a round of in vitro transcription (dIVT) using the Message Amp a RNA kit version II (Ambion), following the manufacturer's protocol. different quantities of positive synthetic mRNA controls were added to all samples. total RNA was extracted from mock and NiV-infected HUVECs 8 and 24 hours post-infection using RNeasy mini kit. qPCR was run on the ABI 7000 PCR system (Applied biosystems) 7000 SDS software available in the genetic analysis platform (IFR128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland) Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as housekeeping gene for mRNA quantification and normalization. GAPDH and standard references for the corresponding genes were included in each run to standardize results. the relative expression represents the ratio of the number of copy of mRNA of interest versus mRNA of GAPDH. ELISA analysis Supernatants of mock and NiV-infected HUVECs were collected 8, 24, 48, 72 h p.i. primary rabbit anti-human CXCL10 (Peprotech) was applied diluted at 4 g/ml. slides were incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit conjugated with HRP (Promega) 1500 for 1\u20132 hours at RT. sections were then developed with AEC kit (VECTOR) for 25 min. l'Experimentation Animal de la R\u00e9gion Rhone-Alpes, CREEA, protocol N\u00b0 220. autopsies of human brain tissue were performed after receiving written patient's relatives consent for autopsy studies. cell culture Primary HUVECs were isolated from human umbilical cords of 22 donors by treating the umbilical vein with 0.1% collagenase for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. HUVECs were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and harvested for RNA isolation 8 and 24 hours post infection (p.i.) at indicated times p.i. 150 l of cell culture supernatant were collected and frozen. viral titration was performed as detailed elsewhere. 10 g of biotin-labeled RNA were fragmented using 5 l fragmentation buffer in a final volume of 20 l, then mixed with 240 l Amersham hybridization solution. each array was incubated for 30 min in 3,4 ml streptavidin-cy5 solution, washed four times in 240 ml TNT buffer, rinsed twice in 240 ml water containing 0.2 M Triton X-100. quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from mock and NiV-infected HUVECs 8 and 24 hours post-infection using RNeasy Mini Kit.
