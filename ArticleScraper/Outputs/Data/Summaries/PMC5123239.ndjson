{"summary": "angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang (1-7) and counter-regulates the classical axis of RAS. ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced in AD compared with age-matched controls. ratio of Ang II to Ang (1\u20137) was significantly elevated in AD. ACE-2 activity is an important regulator of the central classical ACE-1/Ang II/AT1R axis of RAS. dysregulation of this pathway likely plays a significant role in AD."}
