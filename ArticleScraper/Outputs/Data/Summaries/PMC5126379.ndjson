{"summary": "aMPV is a member of the genus Metapneumovirus in the subfamily Pneumovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae. it causes acute rhinotracheitis (TRT) in turkeys and swollen head syndrome (SHS) in chickens (1\u20133). no effective vaccine or drug is currently available for large commercial poultry producers to prevent or treat aMPV. the TTSP family contains more than 20 members that share a number of structural features. the TTSP family contains more than 20 members that share a number of structural features. a prerequisite for aMPV infection is proteolysis of the aMPV F protein. monkey TMPRSS12, monkey TMPRSS12 and hMPV-F were subcloned into a pCAGGS vector with a hemagglutinin tag. syncytium formation assay was performed to measure fusogenicity of the F protein. reporter gene assay to measure fusogenicity of the F protein. TMPRSS12 was selectively overexpressed or knocked down in vero cells. at 6 h posttransfection, transfected Vero cells were detached, resuspended, and overlaid onto BHK-21 cells infected with MVA-T7. at 6 h of treatment with siRNAs, the cells were infected with 50 l of 106 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml aMPV/f or transfected with aMPV/B-F. TMPRSS12 siRNA-treated cells were infected with aMPV/B and then maintained in medium with 10 g/ml trypsin. d at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to collect the supernatants. proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (GenScript, Nanjing, China) the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Super; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) RT-PCR analysis of TMPRSS12 mRNA expression. chicken tissue samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 8,000 g for 2 min. RNA was extracted from the samples using TRIzol (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) qRT-PCR analysis of TMPRSS12 mRNA expression was performed with primer pairs and probes using a PrimeScript one-step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa) the following temperature program was used for the qRT-PCR assay: 42\u00b0C for 5 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 s. three chickens from the infected group and three from the control group were randomly selected and euthanized to collect tissues. all tissue samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 8,000 g for 2 min. the samples were passaged approximately six times in Vero cells until syncytium formation. sin, monkey TMPRSS12 (Mo_TMPRSS12; GenBank accession number XM_005588816.1), human TMPRSS2 (Hu_TMPRSS2; GenBank accession number XM_005570851.1), and chicken TMPRSS12 (Ch_TMPRSS12; GenBank accession number XM_424480.3) were subcloned into a pCAGGS vector with a hemagglu reporter gene assay to measure fusogenicity of the F protein.

RNA was extracted from the samples using TRIzol (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using a PrimeScript one-step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa) on a lightCycler 480 (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) three chickens from the infected group were inoculated with 0.2 ml of DMEM per chicken. group were randomly selected and euthanized to collect tissues. all tissue samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 8,000 g for 2 min. aMPV/B grew independently of exogenous trypsin in vitro. aMPV/B protein is cleaved by endogenous proteases. some glycoproteins of viruses are cleaved by the transmembrane serine protease hepsin or TMPRSS2. overexpression of TMPRSS12 enhances cleavage level and fusogenic activity of aMPV/B F protein. the effect of TMPRSS12 expression on aMPV/B F protein fusogenic activity was analyzed by biotinylation and Western blot assay. transient expression of Mo_TMPRSS12 and Ch_TMPRSS12 enhanced the fusogenicity of aMPV/B F protein approximately 4- to 6-fold. overexpression of Mo_hepsin enhanced the fusogenicity of aMPV/B F protein, whereas overexpression of Hu_TMPRSS2 did not. overexpression of TMPRSS12 and hepsin increased aMPV/B F protein cleavage and fusogenicity and aMPV/B replication. aMPV/B replication kinetics in different cells overexpressing TMPRSS12 were tested up to 96 h p.i. at 72 h p.i., the supernatant in infected cells overexpressing TMPRSS2 was collected to determine titer. transfection with a plasmid expressing aMPV/B F protein reduced aMPV/B F protein cleavage compared to nonspecific siRNA transfection. at 48 h posttransfection, TMPRSS12 mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. the average copy numbers of Mo_TMPRSS12 mRNA were reduced from 1.10 103 to 2.66 101. syncytium formation was reduced in vero cells transfected with siRNA targeting Mo_TMPRSS12 compared to that in cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA. further quantitative analysis revealed that downregulation of Mo_TMPRSS12 diminished aMPV/B F protein fusogenic activity approximately 4- to 6-fold.

TMPRSS12 did not affect the fusogenic activity of mutant aMPV/B F protein, whereas exogenously added trypsin did not. the effect of expression of TMPRSS12 on the extent of cleavage of mutant aMPV/B F protein with 100Q101S and hMPV F protein was analyzed by biotinylation and Western blot assays. trypsin was exogenously added as a positive control. we predicted the HDS triad in TMPRSS12 by an alignment with a hepsin sequence from previous reports (28, 33) the triad was similar to that of chymotrypsin (PDB entry 2GMT) and hepsin (preactive conformation), suggesting that the HDS triad is the active protease site of TMPRSS12. the model represents the conformation of the hepsin and TMPRSS12 proteins using the SWISS-MODEL server facilities (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/). the classical structure of chymotrypsin (PDB entry 2GMT) is presented here to show the essential HDS triad. aMPV/B F protein cleavage was analyzed by biotinylation and western blot assay. the effect of expression of mutant TMPRSS12 on aMPV/B protein fusogenic activity was analyzed by biotinylation and western blot assay. overexpression of TMPRSS12 with a mutant HDS did not increase aMPV/B replication in vero cells and DF-1 cells compared to transfection with the empty vector pCAGGS. these results suggest that the HDS triad of TMPRSS12 was essential for promoting aMPV/B F protein cleavage and fusogenicity. analysis of TMPRSS12 mRNA expression by RT-PCR. total RNA isolated from chicken tissues was used for the amplification of TMPRSS12 mRNA by RT-PCR. the results analyzed by 2% agarose gel are shown. in vero cells without trypsin treatment can be used for propagation of aMPV/B. aMPV/B growth without trypsin treatment is not dependent on trypsin. aMPV/B F protein with 99RKKR102 was cleaved by endogenous proteases. mutant aMPV/B F protein with 99RQSR102 was not. TMPRSS12 cleaved aMPV/B F protein by recognizing amino acid sites 100 and 101. TMPRSS12 plays an important role in the cleavage of aMPV/B F protein. aMPV/B F protein was partly cleaved when TMPRSS12 was knocked down. this suggests that there are relevant activating proteases other than TMPRSS12 in susceptible cells. aMPV causes TRT in turkeys and is associated with SHS in chickens. at present, no effective vaccine or drug is available to prevent or treat aMPV. blocking cleavage of the aMPV F protein may be an effective way to control aMPV."}
