{"summary": "arthropod-borne viruses, most importantly alphaviruses and flaviviruses, cause widespread epidemics of fever, encephalitis and arthritis. neuronal damage can lead to congenital malformations, progressive disease with long-term disability and acute fatal disease. there are no treatments for these infections, and vaccines are not available for most of them. IRF3 is constitutively present at varying levels in the cytoplasm of most cells, including neurons. phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory region by innate sensing pathway-induced kinases leads to dimerization and nuclear translocation. dual IRF3/7 deficiency leads to 100 % mortality after infection with WNV, CHIKV and Ross River virus. single IRF3 deficiency increases susceptibility to HSV and to WNV in both the CNS and the periphery in a manner that is correlated with the induction of IFN. Irf3 mRNA was not induced by infection in either WT or IRF7/ mice. Irf7 mRNA was quickly and similarly upregulated in both the brains and spinal cords of WTB6 and IRF3/ mice. IRF3/ mice developed mild clinical signs, including abnormal hind limb movement (Fig. 2a) but recovered by 14 days after infection with 100 % survival. mice deficient in type I IFN signalling (IFNAR/) or mice deficient in type I IFN (IRF3/5/7/) had a rapid onset of disease (Fig. 2a) and died within 4 days (median survival=3 days) 4\u20136-week-old male and female mice were infected intracranially with 103p.f.u. SINV TE. mice were monitored daily for signs of clinical disease (a, c) and weight loss (b) IRF7/ mice were infected intracranially with 103p.f.u. TE. the levels of infectious virus in the spinal cords were similar to that in WT mice at 3 days. subsequent decreases for WTB6, IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice. subsequent evidence of clearance in WTB and IRF3/ mice. however, individual deficiencies of IRF3 and IRF7 have a limited effect. sera and brain homogenates were analysed by enzyme immunoassay. effects of IRF3 and IRF7 deficiencies on expression of IFN-, IFN- and IFN- after SINV infection. levels of Ifnb mRNA and IFN protein in the brains of WT and IRF3/ mice were similar, but higher in IRF7/ mice 3\u20135 days p.i. in the periphery, serum levels of IFN were below the level of detection. lymph node Ifnb mRNA levels did not change during infection. IRF3 deficiency had little effect on the synthesis of IFN in the CNS. IRF7 deficiency led to slower production of IFN and higher production of IFN. IRF3/ mice also had the highest levels of Ifng mRNA in the spinal cord. ISGs induced by both type I and type II IFNs, Zc3hav1 and Rsad2, were induced in the brains of all infected mice. the highest levels were observed in the brains of all infected mice. Ccl2, Ccl5, Cxcl10 and Cxcl13 mRNAs were higher in IRF7/ mice compared to WT or IRF3/ mice. levels of expression of chemokine and cytokine mRNAs and TNF protein in the nervous system after SINV infection. we analysed the expression of the mRNAs for the innate cytokines IL-1, TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 in the brain and spinal cord. in the brain, the expression of Il1b mRNA was similar, with the highest expression in IRF3/ mice, while the expression of Tnf, Il6 and Il10 mRNAs tended to be higher in IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice. RF3- and IRF7-deficient mice developed a robust expression of cytokines and chemokines in the CNS in response to SINV infection. but IRF7/ mice failed to limit expression of TNF, Ccl2 and Cxcl13. brain and spinal cord sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. slides were coded and scored for inflammation using a 3 (4) point scale for brain (c) and a 2 (3) point scale for spinal cord (d) the data represent the results of two independent experiments, totalling four mice per strain per time point. prolonged neurological deficits in IRF3/ mice and mortality in IRF7/ mice were associated with cell death in the CNS, the brains and spinal cords. TUNEL-positive cells were rarely present in the brains and spinal cords of mock-infected mice, but were readily identified in tissues from SINV-infected mice. numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were quantified on coded slides from brains (c) and spinal cords (d) data represent results of two independent experiments, totalling four mice per strain per time point. we inoculated 4\u20136 week-old IRF3/, IRF7/, IRF3/7/ and IRF3/5/7/ mice with 103p.f.u. of the TE strain of SINV for comparison with similarly infected WTB6 mice. mice deficient in type I IFN signalling (IFNAR/) or mice deficient in type I IFN signalling (IRF3/5/7/) had a rapid onset of disease (Fig. 2a) and triple deficiency of IRF3, 5 and 7 and double deficiency of IRF3 and 7 had effects that were equivalent to those from lack of IFNAR. IRF7, but not IRF3, is required for survival following SINV infection. SINV p.f.u. peaked at 3 days in the brains and spinal cords. IRF 3/5/7/ and IRF3/7/ mice failed to control virus replication in either the brain or spinal cord, with 10\u2013100-fold higher titres by 48 h. SINV-specific IgM (c) and IgG (d) in serum, brain and spinal cord were measured by EIA. they are expressed as the mean optical density (OD) +/SEM for three mice/time point. IRF3/ mice developed higher levels of SINV-specific IgG in the brain than WT mice by 10\u201314 days after infection. levels of antibody early after infection were not different for IRF7/ mice. ifnb mRNA levels in the brains of WT and IRF3/ mice were similar, but were higher in IRF7/ mice 3\u20135 days p.i. in the spinal cord, the level of Ifnb mRNA was higher in IRF7/ mice. type I IFN was induced in the CNS, but not the periphery of all mice after intracerebral infection with SINV. IFN generally peaked at 3 days p.i., with the highest levels of IFN in WT mice and the highest levels of IFN in IRF7/ mice. in the brain, IFN protein and Ifng mRNA levels peaked at 5 days p.i. IRF deficiency with altered proportions of IFN and IFN in the CNS affected the induction of representative antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) after SINV infection. by 3 days p.i., Isg15, Isg56 and Isg54 were induced in the brains of all infected mice. effects of IRF3 or IRF7 deficiency on induction of innate chemokines and cytokines. viral infection induces early expression of chemokines and cytokines. chemokines attract inflammatory cells expressing appropriate receptors into the CNS in response to infection. and Il1b, Tnf, Il6 and Il10 cytokine mRNAs (c, d) were measured by qRT-PCR in the brain (a, c) and spinal cord (b, d), normalized to Gapdh and compared to uninfected WT controls. the data were pooled from two independent experiments. the levels of TNF protein were significantly higher in the brains of IRF7/ mice at 5 days p.i. and 4 to 5-fold higher in the spinal cord at all times examined. inflammatory responses to infection were influenced by IRF3 or IRF7 deficiency in light of differences in chemokine expression. IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice were infected intracranially with 103p.f.u. SINV TE. at 7 days the scores were highest in IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice. in IRF3/ mice a higher proportion of CD45+ cells were CD4+ T cells compared to WT and IRF7/ mice and CD19+ B cells compared to IRF7/ mice. IRF7/ mice tended to have more infiltrating CD45+ cells with a higher proportion of CD8+T cells. WT, IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice were infected intracranially with 103p.f.u. SINV TE. representative TUNEL-stained sections of brain (a) and spinal cord (b) from uninfected (d0) and SINV-infected (d0) IRF3-deficient mice showed higher levels of IFN, TNF and Cxcl13. IRF3 is constitutively present in the cytoplasm of most cells, while IRF7 must be induced [51\u201353] similar outcomes have been observed for IRF3/5/7/ mice after infection with WNV, Zika virus and murine norovirus [24, 59], but mice infected with dengue virus survive [60] similar outcomes have been observed for IRF3/5/7/ mice after infection with WNV, Zika virus and murine norovirus. production of IFN by antigen-presenting cells and induction of Th1 and Th17 cells. inhibition of production of IL-17, granzyme B and IFN- has been implicated in persistent signs of neurological impairment after TMEV infection associated with failure to clear viral RNA. in the cytoplasm IRF7 is associated with myD88, TRAF6 and IKK. it can be activated through both TLR engagement and myD88-independent viral signalling pathways. IRF7 negatively regulates NF-B signalling by binding IB. the inhibition of SINV clearance alone does not lead to neuronal death or fatal outcome [45, 85\u201387], indicating a role for IRF7 in regulating neuronal cell death by autonomous or non-cell autonomous processes. the expression of functionally mature IRF7 increases with neuronal maturation. TNF also decreases astrocyte production of the glutamate transporter GLT-1. failure to control TNF production in the spinal cord may lead to rapid progressive paralysis. CXCL13 is a lymphoid chemokine that is induced in follicular dendritic cells by TNF. it attracts B and T cells expressing CXCR5 during the development of secondary lymphoid tissue. expression during viral infection promotes the accumulation of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells. all mice were bred in-house in specific pathogen-free facilities. the TE strain of SINV [122] was grown and assayed by plaque formation. mice were monitored daily for weight change, evidence of neurological disease and death. real-time PCR was performed using 2.5 l cDNA, PrimeTime gene expression assays and 2 EagleTaq PCR Mix. the target gene Ct value was normalized to the Ct value of Gapdh. the target gene expression level was normalized to the Ct value of Gapdh. sensitivity was 125\u20134000 pg g1 for IFN, 156\u201310 000 pg g1 for IFN and 39\u20135000 pg g1 for TNF. an in-house EIA for SINV-specific IgM and IgG was performed. the optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm on a multiskan MCC. mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4 % (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde. sections (10 m) were rehydrated and treated with 1 mg ml1 proteinase K for 30 min. sections were stained with TdT Labeling Reaction mix for 5 min. slides were dehydrated and dehydrated for 10 min. all antibodies were from BD Pharmingen or eBioscience. were specific for: CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3 (clone 17A2), CD4 (clone RM4-5), CD8 (clone 53\u20136.7), and CD19 (clone 1D3) all mice were bred in-house in specific pathogen-free facilities. the TE strain of SINV [122] was grown and assayed by plaque formation in BHK-21 cells. mice were monitored daily for weight change, evidence of neurological disease and death. real-time PCR was performed using 2.5 l cDNA, PrimeTime gene expression assays and 2 EagleTaq PCR Mix. the target gene Ct value was normalized to the Ct value of Gapdh. the target gene expression level was normalized to the Ct value of Gapdh. sensitivity was 125\u20134000 pg g1 for IFN, 156\u201310 000 pg g1 for IFN and 39\u20135000 pg g1 for TNF. an in-house EIA for SINV-specific IgM and IgG was performed as previously described. oxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgM (day 0) and TE-infected mice at 5 and 7 d after infection were perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) spinal columns were washed in ice-cold PBS and cut to isolate the L4\u2013L6 regions. inflammatory foci per spinal cord or moderate to marked inflammatory foci. an additional point was given for excessive parenchymal cellularity. sections (10 m) were rehydrated and treated with 1 mg ml1 proteinase K for 30 min. all antibodies from BD Pharmingen or eBioscience were specific for: CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3 (clone 17A2), CD4 (clone RM4-5), CD8 (clone 53\u20136.7), and CD19 (clone 1D3) time-course studies were analysed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)"}
