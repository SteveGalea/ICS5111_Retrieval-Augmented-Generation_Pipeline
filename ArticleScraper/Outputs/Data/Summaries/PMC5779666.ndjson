{"summary": "newly generated and current developing vaccines are highly purified recombinant antigens with a higher safety. but purified antigens cannot stimulate a satisfactory immune response compared with attenuated or inactivated pathogen preparations. new powerful adjuvants are widely concerned in vaccine development and human health. astragalus polysaccharide has strong immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo. boiled CD has been used as a tonic food for hundreds of years. boiled CD has been used as a tonic food for hundreds of years. we examined the specific immune response to ovalbumin (OVA) in mice treated with WPCD, including titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subclass. we investigated whether WPCD treatment would increase the activity of DCs and Treg cells in the spleen of these mice. crude polysaccharides were re-dissolved in distilled water and treated with Sevage reagent to remove proteins. extracts were dissolved in PBS and sterilized through 0.22-m filter. total sugar content of WPCD was 59.58%, as indicated by the phenol\u2013sulfuric acid analysis. BM-DCs were washed and re-suspended in RPMI-1640 medium. cells were washed and re-suspended in RPMI-1640 medium. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. LPS treatment was used as a positive control. cultures were added with 20 L of MTT for the final 4-h cultivation. all samples were measured against a background control. CR mice were randomly separated into 7 groups (negative control group) and the positive control group (Alum 200 g with OVA) the mice were administered subcutaneously twice with 10 g OVA alone or WPCD with OVA according to the dose of 20, 100 or 400 g with a 2-week interval. cells were cultured for 48 h and 20 L (5 mg/mL) of MTT (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was added into each well. plates were read at 570 nm by a microtiter plate reader. splenocyte proliferation was expressed as stimulation index. single splenocyte suspension (1106 cells/mL) was prepared on day 7 after first vaccination. cell surface staining was followed by nuclear cytokine staining with appropriate CD25-FITC and Foxp3-PE antibodies. crude polysaccharides were re-dissolved in distilled water and treated with Sevage reagent. the total sugar content of WPCD was 59.58%, as indicated by the phenol\u2013sulfuric acid analysis. BM-DCs from C57BL/6 were induced in the presence of GM-CSF. cells were stained in PBS by using appropriate FITC-, PE-, or APC-conjugated CD40, CD11c, CD86, CD80, and MHC-II antibodies. BM-DCs from C57BL/6 mice were recovered on day 7 in RPMI-1640 medium plus GM-CSF. cells were washed and re-suspended in RPMI-1640 medium before plating into the 24-well plate. singleplenocyte suspensionas responder cells were isolated from BALB/c mice. the animals were observed daily within 14 consecutive days. spleen or thymus index was calculated as: (spleen or thymus weight/bodyweight) 10. ovalbumin (OVA) was used as the model antigen and female ICR mice were randomly separated into 7 groups (negative control group (0.9% NaCl and WPCD 400 g) the mice were administered subcutaneously twice with 10 g OVA alone or WPCD with OVA according to the dose of 20, 100 or 400 g with a 2-week interval. cultures were stimulated with OVA (final concentration 10 g/mL), ConA (final concentration 5 g/mL) and LPS (final concentration 100 ng/mL) cells were cultured for 48 h and 20 L (5 mg/mL) of MTT (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was added into each well and incubated for another 4 h. data analysis was carried out in the FlowJo. analysis of DCs maturation and Treg cells in the spleen. the expression levels of CD11c, CD86, CD80, and MHC-II in cells were analyzed. the treatment with different doses of WPCD did not change the morphology of BM-DCs. the expression levels of CD86, CD80, and CD40 were significantly up-regulated. IL-12 and TNF- is the major cytokines for activating Th1 immune response. BM\u2013DCs were treated with different contents of WPCD for 12 h. the supernatant was collected to detect the contents of IL-12 and TNF-. BM-DCs were pretreated with TAK-242 (TLR4 inhibitor) for 12 h. expression of CD40, CD86, TNF-a or IL-12 were detected by ELISA. the results indicated that WPCD could activate DC maturation through the TLR4 pathway. the MFI values of CD40 (A) and CD86 (B), the yields of TNF-a (C) and IL-12 (D) were shown. data represent mean SD (n = 3) from 3 independent experiments. data represent mean SD (n = 5) from 3 independent experiments. single splenocyte suspension was obtained and respectively stimulated with OVA (10 g/mL), OVA323-339 (10 g/mL) peptide, ConA (5 g/mL) and LPS (5 g/mL) data are expressed as mean SD (n = 5) from 3 independent experiments. WCPD adjuvants formulated with OVA vaccines generated equally strong humoral and cellular immunity. cytokine expressions in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the group administered with 100 g OVA/WPCD was significantly higher than that in OVA/Alum group. IL-4 production in CD4+ T cells (A), IFN- production in CD8+ T cells (B) and INF- production in CD8+ T cells (C) data represent mean SD (n = 5) from 3 independent experiments. Treg cells in the spleen in mice were stained with mouse regulatory T cell staining kit. on day 21 after the first vaccination, a decreased frequency of CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells was observed. the body weight of the mice administered with WPCD and the mice administered with saline solution or OVA/Alum showed no significant difference. besides, the body weight of the mice administered with WPCD showed no significant difference. o Adaptive immunity is determined by the activation of DCs. BM-DCs from C57BL/6 were administered. expression levels of CD11c, CD86, CD80, CD40, and MHC-II in cells were analyzed. the treatment with different doses of WPCD did not change the morphology of BM-DCs. CD80 (B), CD86 (C), and MHC-II (D) were shown. data represent mean SD (n = 3) from 3 independent experiments. some adjuvants could increase co-stimulatory molecules on DCs. 0.01, *** P 0.001 compared with the untreated DCs group. the functional response of DCs to WPCD was investigated by MLR. the results indicated that WPCD improved antigen presentation. CD40, CD86, TNF-a and IL-12 expressions were detected by ELISA. compared with the untreated DCs group, we evaluated the effects of WPCD on the elicitation of humoral immune response in OVA-immunized mice. effects of WPCD on splenocyte proliferation were assessed by ELISA. single splenocyte was isolated from mice immunized on day 21 after first vaccination. OVA323-339-antigen stimulated splenocyte proliferation (A). conA-mitogen stimulated splenocyte proliferation (C). data are expressed as mean SD (n = 5) from 3 independent experiments. IL-4 production in CD4+ T cells (A), IFN- production in CD8+ T cells (B) and INF- production in CD8+ T cells (C) data represent mean SD (n = 5) from 3 independent experiments. a decreased frequency of CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells was observed in the total CD4+ T cells in the spleen on day 7 after the second vaccination (C) on day 21 after the first vaccination, a decreased frequency of CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells was observed. 2.721.24 Alum 250 19.61.74 24.62.27 25.41.94 3.461.63 2.991.33 Values are means SD (n = 8) no significant difference in body weight gain, Thymus index or Spleen index (P>0.05) WPCD and the mice administered with saline solution or OVA/Alum showed no significant difference (P>0.05) Discussion Adjuvants are key components in vaccines. a safe adjuvant is required for a certain vaccine. the expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40, cytokine production, and allogenic T cell proliferation were detected in the optimum WPCD concentration range. the yields of TNF-a and IL-12 were increased in a dose-dependent manner. we selected different doses based on previously reported data from BM-DCs in vitro to subcutaneously administer ICR mice twice. we found that WPCD significantly increased the yield of OVA-specific antibody and induced a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. the IgG2a level was higher than that treated with Alum in the optimum dose. the experimental results showed that WPCD induced maturation of DCs and decreased Treg frequency in the spleen in mice. these results proved that WPCD enhanced the efficacy of OVA vaccines by increasing targeting antigen-presenting cells and promoting T-cell specific activation. it is necessary to systematically explore WPCD extracts. it is necessary to test their efficacy and safety."}
