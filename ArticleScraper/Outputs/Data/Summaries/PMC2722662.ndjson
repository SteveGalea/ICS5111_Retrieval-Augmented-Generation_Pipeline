{"summary": "limited data exist on the epidemiology of ICU-acquired infections in china. retrospective review of nococomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in east china between 2003 and 2007. the CDC defines nosocomial infections as a localized or systemic condition resulting from an adverse reaction to the presence of an infectious agent or its toxin. nosocomial infections may result in an excess length of stay in hospital for up to 10 days and an increase in the costs of hospitalization. the study was performed in the Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, which situates in Zhejiang province, East China. the hospital started an infection control program, including collection of data on infections acquired in the hospital. the retrospective study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical College. the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections was calculated by dividing the total number of patients with nosocomial infections by the total number of patients in the ICU. the total patients days were calculated by summating the days of each patient in the ICU. the excess length of stay was then calculated by subtracting the average length of stay for patients without nosocomial infection from that of patients with nosocomial infections. BSIs 6 (4.1) 4 (2.4) 18 (7.6) 19 (8.3) 12 (5.3) GIs 8 (5.5) 7 (4.1) 6 (2.6) 3 (1.3) 1 (0.4) Surgical sites 1 (0.7) 1 (0.6) 2 (0.8) 4 (1.7) 2 (0.9) Skin & soft tissue 2 (1.4) 2 (1.2) 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) 3 (1.3) Other sites 2 (1.4) 6 (3.5) 9 (3.9) 18 (7.7) no significant change in LRTI, UTI and BSI rates during the 5 years. the GI infection rate was significantly decreased from 5.5% in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007 (2 = 12.603, P = 0.012), whereas nosocomial infections in other sites increased significantly (2 = 12.858, P = 0.012) 9.5 K. pneurnoniae 11.3 3.6 4.8 P. aeruginosa 11.3 1.2 9.5 S. aureus 11.0 0 14.3 C. albicans 9.1 33.3 2.3 S. epidermidis 9.9 3.6 19.0 E. coli 4.0 16.7 16.7 B. cepacia 4.0 0 2.3 Other candida 1.1 21.4 4.8 BSIs, bloodstream infections; LRTIs, lower respiratory infections; mortality rates in patients with nosocomial infections were 20.2% (17/84), 12.2% (12/98), 15.1% (18/119), 15.1% (18/119) and 17.1% (19/111) none of the mortalities were directly related to nosocomial infections. overall patient nosocomial infection rate in the ICU was 26.8% during 2003 and 2007, which was higher than in many industrialized countries. LRTIs were the most common infections in the ICU, accounting for 68.4% of overall infections. LRTIs were the most frequently reported infections in the ICUs in the united states, with the rate of 31% followed by pneumonia of 27%. three quarters of LRTI patients received mechanical ventilation or tracheotomy. more than half of nosocomial UTI and BSI cases were catheter associated. invasive device should be minimized and specific disinfection precautions taken. only 22.2% of E. coli isolates were sensitive to the formula amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid. 78.8% of E. coli isolates exhibited susceptibility to the combination in an UK study. treatment with these antimicrobial agents is likely to result in clinical failure in a substantial proportion of patients. our hospital is an tertiary infectious hospital with experience, methodologies and facilities to combat various infections including nosocomial infections. this is due to the imbalanced development and health care resources within the countries. refractory nosocomial infections are relatively less encountered based on our susceptibility testing. a high and relatively stable rate of nosocomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in china through year 2003\u20132007. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the manuscript was edited by a professional company, Medjaden Biomedical Services."}
