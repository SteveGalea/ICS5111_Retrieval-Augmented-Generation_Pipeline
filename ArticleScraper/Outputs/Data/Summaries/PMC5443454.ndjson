{"summary": "the study sent a 70-question survey to the original 56 designated US HLIUs. the study queried challenges and concerns about the maintenance of capabilities. the university of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board declared the study exempt (#172\u201316X) IU HLIU can be activated 24/7 throughout the year 32/33 (97) PUIs Plan to provide care for PUIs and persons with confirmed cases 32/33 (97) Staff used to care for PUI Use only HLIU staff to care for a PUI 28/32 (88) Placement of PUI Place PUI exclusively in the HLIU while being assessed 14/32 (44) Place PUI in either HLIU or hospital ED 12/32 (38) Place PUI in either HL 1 HLIU reported lacking specific protocols or an ability to care for patients with an HID other than EVD. all other HLIUs (97%) reported being prepared to care for patients with an HID other than EVD. sustainability concerns was the most cited challenge in establishing and maintaining a HLIU. HLIUs also detailed facility modifications and/or capabilities they would add if additional hypothetical funding were available. no formal network of HLIUs has been established in the united states. 14 HLIUs not designated as RESPTCs reported spending $9.1 million more than they have been reimbursed to initially develop HLIU capabilities. the study population was based solely on a list published by the centers for disease control and prevention (9). a network of hospitals capable of treating patients with HIDs was rapidly constructed in response to the recent EVD outbreak. public attention on HID preparedness tends to waver, and governments tend to prioritize and shift funding elsewhere."}
