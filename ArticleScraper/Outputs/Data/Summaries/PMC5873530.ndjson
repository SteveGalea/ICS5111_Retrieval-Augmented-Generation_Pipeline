{"summary": "yam (Dioscorea spp.) is one of the most important staple food crops worldwide. this region contributes over 95% of the world's total yam production. several virus species belonging to different genera have been reported and characterized in yams. serological and PCR-based methods have been developed and applied for the detection of YMV and YMMV [18,22,23] there is an urgent need to develop improved detection methods for yam viruses to help make timely decisions on the health status of yam planting material. RT-RPA method for the detection of YMV and YMMV directly from the crude extract of infected plant material. yams represent particularly recalcitrant leaf tissue that contain high levels of PCR-inhibitory compounds such as polyphenols and polysaccharides. method developed in this study, termed \u2018Direct RT-RPA\u2019, thus has the potential to be adapted to any recalcitrant plant species. sample accession number YMV YMMV RT-RPA (min) RT-PCR RNA Crude extract RNA Crude extract RNA Crude extract RNA Crude extract TDa 95/310 TDa 98/159 10.32 11.38 + TDa 98/01166 6.57 10.69 + + + TDa 99/00240 TDa 00/00005 11.90 13.37 + TDa 00/00194 12.18 12.79 + TDr RNA extraction and crude sample preparation Extraction of total RNA from leaf tissue (100 mg) was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit. final pellet was resuspended in 50 L nucleas. RNA was quantified using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer. the same leaf samples used for RNA extraction were used to prepare crude extracts. leaf disks (13 mg) were immersed in 300 L of freshly prepared alkaline-PEG buffer. RT-PCR amplifications were set up in 20 L reactions containing either 40 ng RNA or 2 L of crude extract, 0.2 M of each primer, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 U AMV Reverse Transcriptase, 1 U DreamTaq DNA polymerase and 1x DreamTaq Green buffer. the following cycle conditions were used: 50 \u00b0C for 10 min for reverse transcription, 95 \u00b0C for 4.5 min, followed by 30 cycles RT-RPA reactions were performed using the materials and protocols provided with the TwistAmp exo-RT kit. the kit contains a reverse transcriptase in the dried enzyme pellet. a master mixture containing all reagents except for the magnesium acetate and template was prepared and used to rehydrate the dried enzyme pellets. this solution was then aliquoted into 0.2 mL PCR tubes (8.5 L/tube) and 1 L (corresponding to 20 ng) of purified RNA (for \u2018RT-RPA\u2019) was added to the reaction mixture. individual leaf samples were grown in a quarantine aphid-proof glasshouse at the Natural Resources Institute (NRI, UK) individual leaf samples were collected in small polythene bags (10 15 cm) and used immediately. 00/00515 5.17 4.60 + + TDr 00/00168 4.79 5.05 + TDr 00/00362 5.42 7.00 + TDr 89/02665 5.09 25.34 + TDr 96/00604 6.12 10.97 + TDr 07/00873 3.50 8.43 + + TDr 03/00196 3.36 5.63 + Ogoja (TDr) Hembakwase (TDr) 4.74 7. RNA extraction and crude sample preparation was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit. final pellet was resuspended in 50 L nuclease-free water and stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to testing. RT-PCR amplifications were set up in 20 L reactions containing either 40 ng RNA or 2 L of crude extract, 0.2 M of each primer, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 U AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK), 1 U DreamTaq DNA polymerase and 1x DreamTaq Green buffer (Thermo Scientific, Loughborough, UK). primers and probes used in this study were synthesised by Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK) and TwistAmp exo probes were synthesised by Eurogentec S.A (Seraing, Belgium). Table 1. RPA primers and probes sequences used in this study. ase in the dried enzyme pellet (TwistDx, Cambridge, UK) RT-RPA reactions were performed in 10 L reaction volume using the enzyme pellets of the TwistAmp exo-RT kit. a master mixture containing all reagents except for the magnesium acetate and template was prepared and used to rehydrate the dried enzyme pellets. each dilution was tested in 5 replicates. RT-RPA assays for YMV and YMMV detection. no double infections were found in any of the samples analysed. cross reaction assays confirmed specificity of YMV and YMMV primers. positive amplification signals above threshold were achieved within 15 min. results for direct RT-RPA agreed with those for RT-RPA for all samples analysed. all Direct RT-RPA reactions were achieved in under 15 min. compared to > 150 min required for RT-PCR. no results were obtained at dilutions lower than 2103. RT-RPA, with purified RNAs as template and Direct RT-RPA, with crude plant extracts as template for detection of YMV and YMMV. YMV was found only in D. rotundata accessions (TDr) and YMMV only in D. alata (TDa) samples. positive amplification signals above threshold were achieved within 15 min. results for direct RT-RPA agreed with those for RT-RPA for all samples analysed. similar amplification times were obtained for both assays for each target. dilutions of crude plant extracts obtained from either YMV- or YMMV-infected yam plants were tested by Direct RT-RPA for its detection limit. no results were obtained at dilutions lower than 2103. Table 3. Limit of detection of YMV and YMMV by direct RT-RPA assay. the development of robust and low-cost diagnostic methods is critical to assist the production and certification of disease-free seed yams. RT-PCR is susceptible to inhibitory compounds present in crude yam plant extracts leading to false-negative results detrimental for certification of disease-free seed yams. previous studies have reported that the presence of background DNA or specific concentration of ions in the sample could have a negative influence on the RPA sensitivity. we tried to improve the YMMV Direct RT-RPA sensitivity by including a mixing step after approximately 4 min of incubation. but our results suggested that the mixing step had an opposite effect and sensitivity was further compromised. the detection limit of the Direct RT-RPA obtained for both viruses is better or equivalent to that of ELISA obtained by the Direct RT-RPA include the use of crude plant extracts as templates. samples can be prepared in a few minutes without the need of hazardous chemicals. a major advantage of the Direct RT-RPA is that samples can be prepared in a few minutes without the need of hazardous chemicals."}
