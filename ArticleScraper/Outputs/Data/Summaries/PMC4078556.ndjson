{"summary": "rabies is a type of acute viral encephalitis, and because of its fast dissemination through the nervous system, few antibodies can affect immunoreaction. most reported cases of rabies occur in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. rabies causes approximately 55,000 deaths annually, with Asia reporting 31,000 and Africa, 24,000. ies deaths in 2012, a death rate among the highest of all infectious diseases. if a rabies epidemic occurs in Taiwan, public health, social order, agriculture, and the tourism industry might suffer severely. preventing canine rabies infection is important to the health of Taiwanese nationals as well as tourists. the theory of planned behavior (TPB) would be a suitable structural model for behavioral intention of vaccination against rabies. we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify that TPB can explain people\u2019s intention to vaccinate dogs against rabies. vaccinating one\u2019s dog is not purely a health behavior. it includes a variety of factors: health, emotions, risk aversion, social perception. vaccinating dogs is not only a personal act but also a social behavior involving moral perception. a central element in TRA and TPB is the individual\u2019s intention to perform a given behavior [17], especially reasoned actions and planned behaviors. previous research shows the instant antecedent of any behavior to be the intention to perform that behavior [18,19,20], especially reasoned actions and planned behaviors. perceived behavioral control represents one\u2019s belief about how easy or difficult it is to perform a behavior and is easily measured with a questionnaire [29,30]. Using the TRA as a base, Ajzen constructed TPB to incorporate perceptions of control over performance of behavior as an additional predictor [17,29]. he then proposed that perceived behavioral control affects behavior not only indirectly through intention but also directly [17,29]. researchers used TPB to examine alcohol abuse [44], volunteer behavior, substance use [45], blood donations [18], and others. in the health domain, TPB explained various behaviors, for example, smoking [46,47,48], giving up smoking [49], and drinking [48,50]. despite the fact that TPB has never been applied to explain the behavior of vaccination against rabies, it has been applied to predict of a wide range of other behaviors. behavioral intention is determined by an individual\u2019s attitudes toward rabies vaccination, subjective norms about this behavior, and perceived behavioral control. this study hypothesizes that favorable attitudes, high subjective norms, and good perceived behavioral control enhance the behavioral intention of rabies vaccination. in the KAP model, people improve their preventive attitudes as they raise their knowledge of disease. in this study, we presumed that owners will have better attitudes about taking their dogs to be vaccinated. vaccinating one\u2019s dog is not purely a health behavior. it includes a variety of factors: health, emotions, risk aversion, social perception, and so on. vaccinating dogs is not purely a health behavior. theories for understanding behavior of vaccinating dogs have manifested as well suited to the design of health behavioral change interventions. theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the TPB have effectively explained inventions and induced health behavior changes [14,15,16]. some studies using the health belief model, source of all health behavior change models, have added self-efficacy to their models [31,32,33] perceived behavioral control represents one\u2019s belief about how easy or difficult it is to perform a behavior and is easily measured with a questionnaire. researchers found that TPB explained an average of 39% of the variance in intention and 27% of the variance in behavior. the current study is one of only a few attempts to use TPB as a conceptual framework for vaccination against rabies. intention is jointly determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in the TPB model. attitudes refer to the degree to which an individual favorably or unfavorably evaluates the behavior in question; second, subjective norms refer to social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior; and third, perceived behavioral control refers to whether the individual anticipates the action as relatively easy or difficult. knowledge can be defined as a kind of stored information, which people obtain and acquire from processing data [58], but knowledge has been discussed according to two concepts, objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK) [8,9] people cannot actually recognize whether their perceptions of how much they know are correct, but a cognitive gap usually exists between OK and SK. jzen argued that perceived behavioral control represents one\u2019s belief about how easy or difficult it is to perform a behavior. an individual with knowledge about specific behavior reduces feelings about impediments and increases perceived behavioral control [17,29]. Specifically, both OK and SK can affect the ability to perform a specific behavior but with different mechanisms. four sections evaluated attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention as to whether owners would take their dogs to receive the rabies vaccine injection. the last two scales (OK and SK) rested on the literature of objective knowledge and subjective knowledge. study used three items with 5-point scales to measure perceived behavioral control. the item \"To bring my dog to have the rabies vaccine injection every year\" was rated on a 5-point semantic differential scale. the questionnaire was pretested on 133 dog owners in Taiwan. the geographic scope of this study is Taiwan and the Kimen district. 310 participants completed the questionnaire to increase the response rate. have the rabies vaccine injection was rated on a 5-point semantic differential scale ranging from absolutely incorrect (1) to absolutely correct (5). the item \u201cTo bring my dog to have the rabies vaccine injection every year\u201d was rated on a 5-point semantic differential scale ranging from absolutely incorrect (1) to absolutely correct (5). subjective knowledge can be measured as a kind of self-confidence [8,59] according to the literature, subjective knowledge can be measured as a kind of self-confidence [8,59] according to the literature, subjective knowledge can be measured as a kind of self-confidence. 310 participants completed the questionnaire. they were almost equally male (163; 52.6%) and female (147; 47.4%). their age ranged from 16 to 73. Cronbach\u2019s AVE CR A 0.903 0.764 0.906 SN 0.839 0.639 0.841 PBC 0.940 0.843 0.942 BI 0.884 0.678 0.862 SK 0.945 0.802 0.942 Convergent validity can be determined by reviewing the average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) this value should exceed 0.5 for average variance extracted and 0.7 for composite reliability (CR) according to the Modification Indices, we opened the correlation between these variables in TPB. all indicators used to test the fitness of SEM models were acceptable. it is shown that the fitness of our model was confirmed. three indices explained 69% of the variance on behavioral intention. social norm positively affected attitude and attitude positively affected perceived behavioral control individually. in knowledge effect on attitude and perceived behavioral control, we also obtained evidence to support our hypotheses. Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the latent variables.
