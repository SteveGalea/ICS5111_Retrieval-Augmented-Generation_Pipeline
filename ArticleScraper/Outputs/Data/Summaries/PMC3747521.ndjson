{"summary": "by the end of the epidemic in July 2003, 8,096 cases were reported in 29 countries and regions with a mortality of 774 (9.6%) (4). the viral kinetics of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV appeared like an inverted v-shaped curve over time. about 50% of patients required supplemental oxygen whereas 25% would need intensive care support during the second week of the illness (3,7,8) index patient presented with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) to a general medical ward at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) on 4th March 2003, 138 patients were hospitalized with SARS within 2 weeks following exposure to the index case. this super-spreading event was thought to be related to a combination of the use of salbutamol via a jet nebulizer for its muco-ciliary clearance effect to the index case who had non-productive cough and dyspnoea there are more than 1,400 isolation beds with double-door and negative pressure in the public hospitals in HK. bigger isolation rooms with 16 air changes per hour are more effective than smaller isolation rooms with 12 ACH at PWH. there is adequate supply of personal protective equipment such as N95 masks, eye shields, gowns, etc. on the isolation wards. exhaled air dispersion distances/directions of common respiratory therapies. we have examined the exhaled air dispersion during application of various respiratory therapies on a human patient simulator using the laser visualization technique. a jet nebulizer, driven by air or oxygen at 6 L/min, can disperse exhaled air >0.8 m laterally from the patient. antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, and immuno-modulating agents Ribavirin were widely used for treating SARS patients (2,3,5,6,8,17,18) but it was later known that ribavirin had no significant in vitro activity against SARS-CoV (28,29), and caused significant haemolysis in many patients (3,17,18,30) use of IFN- 1 plus corticosteroids was associated with improved oxygen saturation, more rapid resolution of radiographic lung opacities and lower levels of CPK in SARS patients in Canada. o and limited animal and observational data that IFN, particularly early use, has efficacy against SARS (33-37) pulsed MP was associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality. complications such as disseminated fungal disease (45) and avascular necrosis of bone occurred following prolonged corticosteroid therapy. general medical wards with crowding and inadequate ventilation are not suitable for managing highly infectious diseases such as SARS. this super-spreading event was thought to be related to the use of salbutamol via a jet nebulizer for its muco-ciliary clearance effect to the index case who had non-productive cough and dyspnoea. a nosocomial outbreak of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) occurred in the same old medical ward setting in 2008 at PWH. a patient hospitalized with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was given non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for treatment of hypercapnic respiratory failure. globally 1,706 healthcare workers were infected while providing care to the SARS patients at close distance in 2003 (4). 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in HK have identified 6 independent risk factors of super-spreading events of SARS. nebulizer, driven by air or oxygen at 6 L/min, can disperse exhaled air between 0.4 and 1 m laterally from the patient. higher inspiratory pressures and use of a whisper swivel device can increase exhaled air leakage and isolation room contamination during NPPV. patients hospitalized with influenza or pneumonia are often required to wear protective masks to prevent nosocomial infection. inavir and ribavirin at 4 and 50 g/mL, respectively. inhibition of in vitro cytopathic effects was achieved down to a concentration of 1 g/mL of lopinavir combined with 6.25 g/mL of ribavirin. other reported beneficial effects include a reduction in corticosteroid use and fewer nosocomial infections. systemic corticosteroids During the second week of SARS illness, patients progressed to more severe pneumonia and hypoxemia. bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia radiologically (3,8,40) and histopathologically (41) in some cases and the progression of the pulmonary disease was mediated by the host inflammatory response (5). controlled study conducted at PWH showed plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations were higher in patients given initial hydrocortisone (n=10) than those given normal saline (n=7) during early clinical course of illness (48). pulsed MP given in the earlier phase might prolong viraemia and therefore it should only be given during later phase for rescue purpose. ribavirin was widely used for treating SARS patients (2,3,5,6,8,17,18) but it was later known that ribavirin had no significant in vitro activity against SARS-CoV. it caused significant haemolysis in many patients (3,17,18,30) in vitro and limited animal and observational data that IFN, particularly early use, has efficacy against SARS. use of IFN- 1 plus corticosteroids was associated with improved oxygen saturation, more rapid resolution of radiographic lung opacities. the use of pulsed MP was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality. complications such as disseminated fungal disease (45) and avascular necrosis of bone occurred following prolonged corticosteroid therapy (46). more rapid virus clearance than other critically ill patients given oseltamivir alone (51). the major outbreak of SARS in 2003 has taught us many invaluable lessons. clinicians should be aware of air leakage from various respiratory therapies."}
