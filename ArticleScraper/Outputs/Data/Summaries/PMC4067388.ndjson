{"summary": "poliomyelitis is caused by the polio virus, an RNA virus that can colonize the gastroenteral tract. it may lead to an acute, viral, infectious disease that spreads via the fecal-oral route. tOPV has been the vaccine of choice for polio vaccination in most countries. IPV does not reduce fecal excretion following re-infection as much as OPV because it provides weaker intestinal immunity. one way to reduce the cost of a vaccine is to use adjuvants [9]. it has been speculated that an adjuvanted vaccine formulation of IPV would reduce cost and increase the number of available IPV doses worldwide. intradermal administration is a well-known delivery route for non-adjuvanted IPV vaccines in humans. the aim was to achieve intestinal immunity with an IPV-CAF01 vaccine. the experiments were approved by the Statens Serum Institut IACUC. the trivalent IPV was formulated in the ratio 40832 for polio virus type 1 (Brunhilde strain, IPV1), type 2 (MEF-1, IPV2) and type 3 (Saukett, IPV3). the trivalent IPV was always formulated to a trivalent stock, IPV TP (40080320 DU/mL), from individual concentrated bulk materials of IPV1, IPV2 and IPV3. the lipid film was dried under vacuum over night to remove trace amounts of organic solvent. the lipid film was hydrated 80 mL 10 mM Tris-buffer, pH 7.6. the same procedure is applied for the formulation of CAF01 2500/500. mice were immunized with 50 L IPV or IPV formulated with CAF01. Alternatively the mice were immunized with 50 L via the intradermal route. two weeks after the second or third vaccination the immune response against IPV was analyzed. standard and samples diluted in PBS containing NaCl, KCl, Triton X-100, BSA and phenol-red were added to the wells and incubated for 2 hours in a humidified atmosphere at room temperature. wells were washed and subsequently HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibodies against polio type 1, 2, or 3 diluted in FBS with phenol-red were added to the wells. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 7 (6\u20138) days. the result from a single dilution series is given as 1/2 times the lowest dilution factor with dead vero-cells. Maxisorp micro titer plates coated with IPV TP or IPV Type 1, 2 or 3 (1 ug/mL) in PBS over night at 4\u00b0C. free binding sites blocked with 2% skimmed milk in PBS. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were added. glycerol (50% v/v) and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF; 1 mM) fecal pellet solutions were clarified by centrifugation at 15,500 G for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. supernatants were then frozen and analysed at a later date by ELISA. the experiments were approved by the Statens Serum Institut IACUC. the method of sacrifice was cervical dislocation. the trivalent IPV was always formulated to a trivalent stock. a lipid film for 80 mL CAF01 10000/2000 was formed by dissolving DDA (0.80 g) in 10 mL chloroform/methanol (91, v/v) and mixing it with TDB (0.16 g) dissolved in 10 mL chloroform/methanol (91, v/v) in a 100 mL Bluecap flask. the organic solvent was removed using a gentle stream of N2 forming the CAF01 10000/2000 g was applied to formulate vaccines for physic-chemical analyses. all vaccine formulations were performed in LAF units. all vaccines were stored at 2\u20138C until use. multiplex cytokine assay performed according to manufacturer's instructions. plates were read on the Sector Imager 2400 system. cytokine concentrations in unknown samples were determined. plates were read at OD 490 nm with non-specific absorption at 630 nm subtracted. dilutions of the sera in 50 L were made in duplicate starting at 18. 50 l of approximately 100 CCID50 (Cell culture infectious dose 50%) of poliovirus type 1 or 3 was added to each well. each specimen was run in triplicate, with parallel specimens from one study subject tested in the same assay run. each run contained multiple replicates of a reference antiserum pool starting at a 132 dilution. a serum sample was considered positive if antibodies were present at 18 dilution. to stop the reaction, 100 uL of 4 N H2SO4 was added. optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm. fecal pellets were collected from mice two weeks following each immunization. nanosphereTM size standards 60 nm (Duke scientific corp., Duke, NC) was used to verify the performance of the instrument. surface charge on the vesicles was measured indirectly via analysis of zeta-potential at 25\u00b0C using a Malvern nanoZS. m compared to 203 nm for the CAF01 adjuvant. this indicated a slight increase in particle size on IPV binding to the CAF01, which however was within an acceptable range. three mono-IPV-CAF01 vaccines were formulated to evaluate the binding of each IPV type 1\u20133. no IPV was found in the supernatant fraction of the three mono-IPV-CAF01 formulations. this indicated that all IPV serotypes are indeed bound to CAF01. the mice received two immunizations spaced by two weeks and neutralizing antibody titers were determined in the sera two weeks after the last immunization. the results showed that CAF01 induced a significant increase in neutralization titers to all serotypes. the individual titers for each mouse are plotted and the bar represents the mean neutralizing antibody titer. indicated dosage units in the experiments correspond to Type 1 D-antigen units. a third vaccination led to a significant increase in neutralization titers. addition of adjuvant CAF01 allowed for a 10 times dose sparing. only two vaccinations with the formulated vaccine were required to achieve the same neutralization titers as observed after three vaccinations with non-adjuvanted IPV. the serum IgG against TP or the individual virus serotypes was measured by indirect ELISA using trivalent IPV as the antigen. the ab titer was measured by the reaction of a series of 10-fold dilution of sera with the antigen. multiplex cytokine analysis showed very low responses for both doses. highest response was observed with IL-2 (525165 and 66765 pg/mL in the IPV 2 DU and 20 DU groups, respectively) in the IPV alone groups we observed a significant increase for the cytokines IFN-, IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, IL-2 and TNF- but not IL13. in the IPV 2 DU + CAF01 we observed an increase in IFN- (to 7492+/1896 pg/mL) and IL-2 (to 2432+/383 pg/mL), but a significant decrease in secretion of IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, and TNF- (to 2432+/383 pg/mL) at week 5 the major secretion of cytokines was observed. either IPV 2 DU + CAF01 given either ID or IM. neither of the administration forms induced intestinal IgA. both vaccine strategies induced IgG in the serum with the IM administration being the highest inducer. the animals received 50 L of the same vaccine in the IM and ID dose. as booster vaccination the mice were given an IM administration. the results showed that supplementing an ID administration with an IM administration in the first vaccination induced a strong increase in the IgA titer in the feces. IgG titers in both adjuvanted groups increased compared to non-adjuvanted group. cellular immunity measured by IFN- ELISA on supernatants from PBMCs stimulated with IPV in vitro. in the IPV 2 DU ID+IM group we observed a significant increase in fecal IgA whereas fecal IgG was not observed in either of the vaccine groups. however, this did not lead to fecal IgA (data not shown) IPV3 (2237 DU/ml), IPV TP (40080320 DU), CAF01 (2500DDA/500TDB) and IPV (8DU)-CAF01 (2500DDA/500TDB) all data show the average of 3 measurements. no IPV was found in the supernatant fraction of the three mono-IPV-CAF01 formulations. this indicated that all IPV serotypes are indeed bound to CAF01. the reason for a recovery of less than 100% is most likely due to Steric hindrance (caused by CAF01) of the binding of the detecting antibodies in the IPV DU ELISA to IPV. SSI and CDC were used to determine the neutralization titers. the results showed that CAF01 induced a significant increase in neutralization titers to all serotypes (Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3, p0.05) indicated dosage units correspond to Type 1 D-antigen units. a third vaccination led to a significant increase in neutralization titers. two vaccinations with IPV 2 DU + CAF01 gave neutralization titers that were not statistically different from 3 vaccinations with IPV 2DU. va from individual mice vaccinated with IPV 2 DU + CAF01 induced increase in IgG binding titers. two weeks after the second vaccination, sera from individual mice were analyzed for IPV specific antibody titers. titers were higher than in sera from the IPV 2 DU against trivalent IPV. the ab titration from the sera of 4 mice is shown for the vaccine groups indicated. the serum IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG2c against TP were measured by indirect ELISA using trivalent IPV as the antigen. all mice were vaccinated via the IM route with inactivated polio vaccine (TP) in the IPV 2 DU and 20 DU groups we observed a significant increase for the cytokines IFN-, IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, IL-2 and TNF- but not IL13. at week 2 post vaccination we observed a significant increase for the cytokines IFN-, IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, IL-2 and TNF- but not IL13. in the IPV 2 DU + CAF01 we observed an increase in IFN- (to 7492+/1896 pg/mL) and IL-2 (to 2432+/383 pg/mL), but a significant decrease in secretion of IL-17, IL-5, IL-10, and TNF- (to 2432+/383 pg/mL) at week 5 the major secretion of cytokines was observed with IFN- and both vaccine strategies induced IgG in the serum with the IM administration being the highest inducer. this correlated well with the serum neutralization titers. IPV-CAF01 induced a significant increase in titers compared to both the IPV ID group and the IPV IM group. the results showed that supplementing an ID administration with an IM administration in the first vaccination induced a strong increase in the IgA titer in the feces. in contrast, we did not observe increased fecal IgG levels. titers from the IPV 2 DU + CAF01 ID+IM group were even significantly higher than titers from the IPV 20 DU group. titers from the IPV 2 DU + CAF01 ID+IM group were significantly higher than titers from the IPV 20 DU group. the ID+IM group received twice the antigen amount in the first vaccination. however, this did not lead to fecal IgA. we also tested a group that received two IM vaccinations at the same time. however, this did not lead to fecal IgA. a recent report concluded that children in resource-poor settings probably are protected against paralytic poliomyelitis with as few as two doses of IPV in primary vaccines. the study was based on IPV vaccines given at month 6 and 9. children receiving a previous OPV vaccination were protected with just a single IPV dose most likely due to boosting of a prominent OPV induced memory B cell response. a 5\u201310-fold reduction of the IPV vaccine dose is feasible even in the presence of maternal antibodies. we also characterized the influence of CAF01 on the immune response against IPV. this was observed against all three polio virus types. CAF01-adjuvanted group showed increased cytokine responses at week 5 post vaccination. cytokine profile changed significantly from week 2 to week 5 to resemble profile induced by IPV alone. this indicates that IPV as an antigen can also influence the type of cellular immunity induced against it. we speculate that immunity mediated by the IFN-/IL-2 expressing Th1 T cells may be important for the protection against the polio virus due to their ability to 1) induce isotype switching to IgG2a and 2) induce innate immunity to contributes to antiviral immunity [40], [41], [58]. inducing intestinal IgA is a priority of any polio vaccine. a side-by-side ID+IM administration with a CAF01 adjuvanted vaccine followed by an IM administration induced significant levels of fecal IgA and, of importance, without compromising serum binding and neutralization titers. however, a side-by-side ID+IM administration with a CAF01 adjuvanted vaccine followed by an IM administration induced significant levels of fecal IgA and, of importance, without compromising serum binding and neutral CAF01 has successfully completed several phase I studies with other vaccine candidates. achieving dose sparing with CAF01 is a prerequisite for worldwide replacement of OPV with IPV. lowering the manufacturing cost for IPV in developing countries is a priority. study indicated that one or two vaccinations should protect children in resource-poor settings against paralytic poliomyelitis. the response to IPV and several other vaccines are highly sensitive to the maternal antibody level [47]\u2013[52]. a 5\u201310-fold reduction of the IPV vaccine dose is feasible even in the presence of maternal antibodies. the antibody binding titers at week 2 post vaccination 2 were increased to levels that were higher than the levels induced by a 10 times higher IPV dose (20 DU) this was observed against all three polio virus types. the CAF01 adjuvanted group also showed elevated cytokine responses at week 5 post vaccination 2. the cytokine profile changed significantly from week 2 to week 5 to resemble the profile induced by IPV alone. this indicates that IPV as an antigen can also influence the type of cellular immunity induced against it. isotype switching to IgG2a and 2) induce innate immunity to contributes to antiviral immunity. fecal IgA is important in preventing entry of the pathogen [42], [59] therefore, inducing intestinal IgA is a priority of any polio vaccine. a strong intestinal priming may not be entirely required for intestinal protection as long as an intestinal challenge can effectively boost a pre-existing minor intestinal immunity. a supplemental dose of IPV administered to children previously exposed to OPV boosts humoral and intestinal immunity more effectively than a supplemental dose of OPV [5]\u2013[7], [45], [62].
