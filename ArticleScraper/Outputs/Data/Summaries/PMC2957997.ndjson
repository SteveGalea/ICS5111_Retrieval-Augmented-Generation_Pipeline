{"summary": "study NPA samples were collected from 235 children hospitalized with ARTI. all patients were 15 years of age and informed consent was obtained from their parents. cDNA sample was synthesized by using random hexamer primers. 260 viruses were identified in 196 (83.4%) of the 235 children. all 11 HBoV strains detected by using HBoV2 nested-PCR were included in the 18 HBoV-positive patients. vovirus B19 reference sequences are indicated by inverted triangles. scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. HBoV2 infections were detected throughout the year. the median hospital stay was 11.3 days (range 4\u201323 days) for patients with HBoV monoinfection, the median hospital stay was 7.8 days (range 6\u201310 days), and none had underlying illnesses. the chest radiograph of 1 patient showed shadows in the left lung zone. 7 (58.3) 0.708 0.310 0.405 Cough 2 (66.7) 5 (71.4) 5 (83.3) 10 (83.3) 0.708 0.730 0.583 Wheeze 1 (33.3) 4 (57.1) 4 (66.7) 7 (58.3) 1.000 0.572 0.405 Rhinorrhea 2 (66.7) 2 (28.6) 2 (33.3) 5 (41.7) 0.500 0.572 0.405 Crackles 2 (66.7) 6 (85.7) 6 (100) the 4 HBoV2 NP-1 sequences shared 98%\u201399% and 97.6%\u201398.3% nucleotide sequence identity with HBoV2 strain PK-2255 and HBoV2 strain W153. the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of NS-1 and NP-1 shared high identities (>97%) with the HBoV2 and HBoV sequences. HBoV sequence 97\u201398 99 97\u2013100 98\u2013100 99\u2013100. most of the patients were 3 years old. co-infection was high (70%), with RSV the most common co-pathogen. Statistical analysis indicated that HBoV2 and HBoV co-infection obviously did not correlate with disease severity (data not shown) two of 3 patients with HBoV2 monoinfection had diarrhea with no vomiting (Table 1), and only 1 of 10 patients who were HBoV2 positive vomited. further investigation is needed to exclude oral or inhaled gastric viruses as possible sources of NPA-associated HBoV2."}
