{"summary": "plus-strand RNA viruses are ubiquitous pathogens of plants, animals, and humans. the translation of their messenger-sense RNA genome yields the core viral enzymes that always include an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) many +RNA viruses employ polycistronic genomes and different mechanisms to express genes located downstream of the 5\u2032-proximal open reading frame (ORF) subunits segregated in two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. autoproteolytic processing of these precursors generates between 13 and 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that direct viral RNA synthesis. arteri- and coronavirus RdRp-containing complexes also mediate the synthesis of a distinctive nested set of sg mRNAs. nsp4 serine proteinase (SP), nsp9 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), nsp10 helicase (Hel) and nsp11 endoribonuclease (Ne) are indicated. the orange boxes indicate the positions of transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) erivirus replicase pp1a and pp1ab are co- and post-translationally cleaved into 13 nsps by viral proteases residing in nsp1, nsp2 and nsp4. the seven viral structural proteins, which are all dispensable for replication and transcription, are encoded in a set of overlapping ORFs located in the 3\u2032-proximal quarter of the genome. the genomic leader TRS serves as a base-pairing target for the 3\u2032 end of the nascent minus strand. when minus strand synthesis resumes, nascent strands are extended with the complement of the genomic leader sequence. minus-strand RNA synthesis proceeds to yield a full-length complement of the genome, the intermediate required for its replication. nsp1 was found to be essential for sg mRNA production, while being dispensable for genome replication. nsp1 is also the first protein expressed during infection: it is co-translationally released from the nascent replicase polyproteins by a papain-like cysteine proteinase activity (PCP) in its C-terminal domain. active-site Cys and His of PCP and PCP are indicated with triangles. the positions of amino acid clusters mutated in this study are indicated with arrows. nsp1 modulates viral RNA accumulation in an mRNA-specific manner. replacements of putative zinc-coordinating residues either abolished transcription of all viral sg mRNAs or interfered with virus production without affecting viral mRNA accumulation. the first approach is less likely to perturb the protein's overall stability, since clusters of charged residues are usually found on the protein surface. if these substitutions compromise virus replication, isolation of revertant viruses encoding compensatory second-site mutations might reveal potential regulatory protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. analysis of nsp1 mutant phenotypes was performed during peak of viral RNA synthesis and before the bulk of infectious progeny was produced by the wild-type (wt) control. previous studies of intracellular viral RNA levels had been hampered by the considerable variability in transfection efficiencies of synthetic EAV full-length RNAs. this allowed for the comparison of the absolute levels of mRNA accumulation and the detailed first-cycle analysis of EAV nsp1 mutants at GCG-380 +++++++ A1 R80A K83A 462- GCA GCA -474 +++++++ A3 E112A E113A 558-GCC GCG-563 +++ +++ A4 K126A R127A 600- GCA GCU-605 ++++ +++++. a 2- to 4-fold increase in genomic RNA levels as compared to wild-type is denoted by ++++, while an increase of >4-fold is shown cells transfected with nsp1 mutants were harvested 11 h after transfection. intracellular RNA was isolated and resolved in denaturing gels. mRNAs were detected by hybridization to a probe complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the genome and thus recognizing all viral mRNAs. total intracellular RNA was isolated at 11 h post-transfection and resolved by denaturing formaldehyde electrophoresis. equal loading of samples was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA. the positions of the EAV genome (RNA1) and the six sg mRNAs (RNA2 to RNA7) are indicated. sequence analysis of the A3 progeny revealed reversion of the E113A mutation to the wt sequence at later time points. these observations imply that both the ZF and the PCP domains of EAV nsp1 are involved in a step of the viral replicative cycle that is downstream of transcription. mutations in nsp1 can differentially affect accumulation of viral mRNA species. nsp1 mutants exert species-specific effects on viral mRNA accumulation. nsp1 mutants exerted differential effects on viral mRNA abundance. nsp1 mutants exerted differential effects on mRNA abundance. nsp1 mutants implicated nsp1 in the mRNA-specific modulation of viral RNA levels. minus-strand RNA synthesis in arteri- and coronaviruses can operate in either continuous or discontinuous mode. the relative abundance of the corresponding minus-strand template determines the level to which each of the viral mRNAs accumulates. minus-strand templates of the most abundant viral mRNAs \u2013 RNA1, 6, and 7 were selected for quantitative analysis. nsp1 mutations in a sg RNA-specific manner significantly increased minus-strand accumulation in the A1 and A4 mutants. pRNA6 and pRNA7 target the leader-body junction sequences of ()RNA6 and ()RNA7 respectively. hybridization with pRNA1 results in the protection of a single fragment. the probes for ()RNAs 6 and 7 each protect three fragments. the relative levels of minus-strand accumulation were quantified by phosphorimaging. only the bands resulting from protection of full-length sg minus strands were quantified. the values correspond to the means from three independent transfections. the close correlation between mRNA and corresponding protein levels argues against the possibility that the engineered nsp1 mutations might have caused a defect in viral mRNA translation. even modest changes in viral mRNA accumulation are directly translated into altered viral protein levels during EAV infection. major viral envelope proteins, GP5 and M [27],[28], and both the GP5 and M protein levels, as well as the levels of their mRNA templates, RNA5 and RNA6, were strongly affected in the ZCH and A1 mutants. the decreased ratio of N protein and genomic RNA in the A1 and A4 mutants could also adversely affect the assembly of infectious virions. ZCH, A1 and A4 mutations appear to affect the total number of secreted virions, as well as their specific infectivity. even at this relatively early time point post transfection, the three mutants showed heterogeneous plaque morphology, indicative of rapid reversion. b EAV genomic RNA levels were quantified in virion preparations. values for mutant virions were obtained by comparing threshold cycle (Ct) against the qPCR standard curve. c Relative specific infectivity values were calculated by dividing the relative infectivity (mutantwt pfu ratio) by the relative genomic RNA content for each construct. a pseudorevertant of ZCH acquired a substitution in the vicinity of the original mutations (Ala-29 to Asp) in addition, four clones of the A4 offspring contained a Thr-196 to Lys substitution, and Gly-47 to Ala and Glu-112 to Lys replacements were found in one clone each. ine codon from GCG to GCC was introduced as a marker mutation upon construction of the ZCH mutant. to ascertain these second-site substitutions conferred a replicative advantage, they were introduced into their respective parental (mutant) full-length cDNA clones. both virus titer and plaque size of the three viruses carrying a second-site mutation in the A4 mutant background were similar to those of the wt control. mRNA-specific accumulation defects were significantly reduced relative to wt. both the pronounced mRNA-specific accumulation defects were significantly alleviated by second-site mutations in nsp1. the relative accumulation levels of viral mRNAs at 11 h post-transfection for the ZCH and A1 mutants are derived from Fig. 4B. the relative accumulation levels of viral mRNAs at 11 h post-transfection for the ZCH and A1 mutants are represented to facilitate comparison. alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-conserved clusters of polar residues found throughout the nsp1 sequence. ii) a CysHis interchange at the positions of residues Cys-25 and His-27, which have both been implicated in zinc coordination [13],[16]. the second approach might preserve zinc coordination but could have a subtle effect on zinc binding that might be translated in a measurable effect. previous studies of intracellular viral RNA levels had been hampered by the considerable variability in transfection efficiencies of synthetic EAV RNAs. this allowed for the comparison of the absolute levels of mRNA accumulation and the detailed first-cycle analysis of EAV nsp1 mutants at a time point at which differences in virus production or (pseudo)reversion would not influence the assessment of their phenotype. transfected cells were analyzed by IFA and gel hybridization analysis at 11 h post-transfection. a 2- to 4-fold increase in genomic RNA levels as compared to wild-type is denoted by ++++. a decrease in accumulation levels of at least two sg mRNA species is shown as ++++ and ++. p1 mutants were harvested 11 h after transfection. intracellular RNA was isolated and resolved in denaturing gels. all viral mRNAs were detected by hybridization to a probe complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the genome. all four mutants displayed a noticeable increase in genomic RNA levels. the positions of the EAV genome (RNA1) and the six sg mRNAs (RNA2 to RNA7) are indicated. the positions of the EAV genome (RNA1) and the six sg mRNAs (RNA2 to RNA7) are indicated. titers of the Z2 and A3 mutants represent an average of three independent experiments. mutations in nsp1 can differentially affect accumulation of viral mRNA species. mutations in nsp1 are involved in a step of the viral replicative cycle. mutations in nsp1 can differentially affect accumulation of viral mRNA species. nsp1 mutants exert species-specific effects on viral mRNA accumulation. nsp1 mutants exerted differential effects on viral mRNA abundance. nsp1 mutants exerted differential effects on viral mRNA abundance. minus-strand RNA synthesis in arteri- and coronaviruses can operate in either continuous or discontinuous mode, generating genome- or subgenome-length templates respectively. the relative abundance of the corresponding minus-strand template presumably determines the level to which each of the viral mRNAs accumulates. ulation levels were quantified in total intracellular RNA extracted at 11 h post-transfection with the ZCH, A1 and A4 mutants. subgenomic minus- and plus-strand levels were similarly affected by the nsp1 mutations in a sg RNA-specific manner. these results clearly implicate nsp1 in a regulatory step (or steps) that controls minus-strand RNA accumulation. fragments derived from full-length sg minus strand and two fragments derived in part from partial hybridization of these probes to larger viral ()RNAs. non-EAV sequences present near the termini of the probes were omitted from the scheme. sg minus strands were quantified using the mean relative values obtained in Fig. 4B and 5C. the ratio of plus-strand to minus-strand accumulation for RNAs 1, 6 and 7 was calculated using the mean relative values obtained in Fig. 4B and 5C. corresponding protein levels argues against the possibility that the engineered nsp1 mutations might have caused a defect in viral mRNA translation. corresponding protein levels argues against the possibility that the engineered nsp1 mutations might have caused a defect in viral mRNA translation. decreased ratio of N protein and genomic RNA in the A1 and A4 mutants could also adversely affect the assembly of infectious virions. virions from medium harvested at 24 h after transfection with the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants were reduced by approximately 4 logs and that of the A1 mutant by 5 logs. a previously unnoticed link seems to exist between fine-tuning of relative abundance of EAV mRNAs and proteins. a previously unnoticed link seems to exist between the fine-tuning of the relative abundance of EAV mRNAs and the efficiency of virion biogenesis. c Relative specific infectivity values were calculated by dividing the relative infectivity (mutantwt pfu ratio) by the relative genomic RNA content for each construct. the data shown are derived from two independent experiments. second-site mutations in nsp1 can restore both the quantitative balance among viral mRNA species and efficient virus production. four clones of the A4 offspring contained a Thr-196 to Lys substitution. Gly-47 to Ala and Glu-112 to Lys replacements were found in one clone each. the number of clones contained each mutation is indicated in brackets. cell culture supernatants harvested 24 h after transfection with RNA from nsp1 pseudorevertants indeed contained between 2 and 4 logs more infectious progeny than those of the original mutants. both virus titer and plaque size of the three viruses carrying a second-site mutation in the A4 mutant background were similar to those of the wt control. the relative specific infectivities of virion preparations derived from all nsp1 pseudorevertants were considerably second-site mutations in nsp1 moderate species-specific defects in mRNA accumulation. nsp1 mutants were transfected with reconstructed pseudorevertants. mRNAs were quantified 11 h post-transfection by gel hybridization. nsp1 mutants are derived from Fig. 4B and are represented here to facilitate comparison between mutant and pseudorevertant phenotypes. nsp1 seems to perform this function by controlling the accumulation of the minus-strand templates for viral mRNA synthesis. nsp1 mutants with differential deviations in viral mRNA abundance are seemingly reflected in altered levels of their translation products. the importance of this balance is greatly emphasized by the rapid emergence of pseudorevertant viruses, in which both the mRNA-specific accumulation defects and the impaired virus production were significantly moderated. co-translational, cis-cleavage of the nsp1/2 site in the nascent replicase polyproteins [30] is probably the sole processing step mediated by PCP. such secondary non-proteolytic functions have previously been reported for several +RNA viral autoproteinase domains. previously uncharacterized PCP domain appears to cooperate with the ZF in transcription and virion biogenesis. the protein exists in equilibrium between monomers and dimers in solution. a recent paper describing the crystal structure of PRRSV nsp1 reported that the protein exists in equilibrium between monomers and dimers in solution. the quantitative balance among EAV mRNA species is critical for efficient virus production. mRNA accumulation was close to that of the wt control or modestly decreased. mRNA yields were observed when viral mRNA accumulation was increased. nsp1 mutants and pseudorevertants have mean deviations larger than zero. an extension of this study with new mutants and pseudorevertants may further refine the relationship. it would also be interesting to evaluate how virus yields are affected by a general imbalance between replication and transcription (A4 mutant) versus sg mRNA-specific changes (ZCH mutant), although the latter seem to have an added negative effect (A1 mutant). calculated for each mutant and plotted against virus titers as in (A) the data fit a negative exponential regression calculated using Microsoft Excel and depicted as a gray line (y = 6106+7e8.4306x, R2 = 0.95) the molecular basis of perturbed infectious particle production in the mutants is probably complex. nidovirus replicative cycle is marked by translation of the viral genome. non-structural protein expression is extensively regulated at translational and post-translational level, by ribosomal frame-shifting and concerted autoproteolytic processing. regulation of structural protein expression is presumed to occur mainly at the transcriptional level. nsp1 does not only allow the viral RdRp complex to engage in discontinuous minus-strand synthesis, but also enables it to differentiate between the various body TRS motifs it encounters. this occurs by a currently unknown mechanism that is different from the previously described \u201cpolar attenuation\u201d caused by the relative position of body TRSs in the array of successive attenuation signals. nsp1 mutations clearly influenced minus-strand RNA accumulation. but biochemical studies are needed to ascertain the recruitment of nsp1 to RdRp complexes is completely unchanged. nsp1 remains the only known arterivirus protein specifically implicated in the regulation of transcription [13],[39]. genome replication and sg mRNA synthesis can be effectively uncoupled by mutations in the C-terminus of the viral RdRp. this could only be achieved after separation of the protein-coding sequence from overlapping regulatory RNA sequences. the complex mechanisms coordinating +RNA virus replication and transcription can be functionally separated, with the ZF domain being essential for transcription and efficient virus production. the previously uncharacterized PCP domain appears to cooperate with the ZF in transcription and virion biogenesis. it works in concert with both flanking nsp1 subdomains in controlling the relative abundance of viral mRNAs. a similar readjustment of the protein's tertiary structure might account for the compensatory effect exerted by the Ala-29 to Asp reversion on the ZCH mutant. a recent paper describing the crystal structure of PRRSV nsp1 reported that the protein exists in equilibrium between monomers and dimers in solution. Residues from both subdomains also contribute both to nsp1 dimerization and the formation of a hydrophilic groove at the dimer surface. observation was rationalized by assessing the importance of the quantitative balance among mRNA species for infectious virus production. for each mRNA species the absolute deviation of its relative accumulation from the mean of the complete nested set of mRNAs was calculated. by definition, the mean deviation is equal to zero for the wt virus, whose mRNA levels we refer to as \u201cbalanced\u201d. imbalance between replication and transcription (A4 mutant) versus sg mRNA-specific changes (ZCH mutant), although the latter seem to have an added negative effect (A1 mutant). the data fit a negative exponential regression calculated using Microsoft Excel. the inset shows an expanded view of the upper left quadrant of the graph. the molecular basis of perturbed infectious particle production in the mutants is probably complex. it is likely related to the altered relative abundances of viral structural proteins resulting from the respective changes in the levels of their mRNA templates. non-structural protein expression is extensively regulated by ribosomal frame-shifting and concerted autoproteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins. regulation of structural protein expression is presumed to occur mainly at the transcriptional level, although the exact significance and control of the relative abundance of the various viral mRNAs in infected cells had not been examined for nidovirus. changes in viral RNA accumulation observed for the A1 and A4 mutants could result from partial loss of recruitment of nsp1 to the minus-strand RNA-synthesizing complex. this could result from its compromised ability to recognize RNA signals that direct discontinuous RNA synthesis. however, the availability of nsp1 is important for its function in transcription. nsp1 remains the only known arterivirus protein specifically implicated in regulation of transcription [13],[39] and, to date, a functional counterpart has not been identified in coronaviruses or other nidoviruses. however, the major effect of this mutation was a reduction of the accumulation of all viral mRNAs by more than 100-fold. mutations in the nsp1-coding sequence were transferred to pEAV211 or pEAN551 containing some engineered restriction sites. mutations in the nsp1-coding sequence were then transferred to pEAV211 or pEAN551. pEAV211 or pEAN551 were previously shown to display a wt phenotype. pEAV211 construct was used as a wt control in all experiments. seven g of in vitro-synthesized cDNA clones were electroporated into 3.5106 BHK-21 cells using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Kit (Ambion) cells were seeded on coverslips for immunofluorescence analysis or in 6-well clusters for analysis of intracellular protein and RNA levels. DMEM containing 50 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4, 2% FCS and 1% agarose was used. cells were analyzed at 11 hour post-transfection by dual labeling with a rabbit antiserum recognizing EAV nsp3 [49] and an anti-N mouse monoclonal antibody (3E2; [50] image analysis and quantification of band intensities were performed with the ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). total intracellular RNA isolated at 11 h post-transfection was dissolved in 10 l of Hybridization Buffer III (RPA III Kit; Ambion), denatured for 3 min at 95\u00b0C and incubated for 16 h at 55\u00b0C. radiolabelled RNA transcripts were generated by in vitro transcription in the presence of [-32P]CTP (Perkin Elmer) using MAXIscript T7 Kit (Ambion) and purified from 5% polyacrylamide/8M urea gels by elution for 3h at 37\u00b0C. the transcript generated for detection of genomic minus strands \u2013pRNA1 was 356 nt long and contained 327 nt of ()RNA1-specific sequence virions from 1 ml of clarified supernatant were purified by pelleting through a 0.4 ml cushion of 20% sucrose in 20 mM Tris pH = 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA at 55,000 rpm for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. a cDNA aliquot was amplified with EAV-specific oligonucleotides EAV418as and EAV418a cell lines Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21; ATCC CCL10) were used for all experiments. the cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in BHK-21 medium (Glasgow MEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES, pH = 7.4 the substitutions in the nsp1-coding sequence listed in Table 1 and Table 3 were engineered using appropriate shuttle vectors and site-directed mutagenesis PCR. the mutations in the nsp1-coding sequence were then transferred to pEAV211 or pEAN551 containing some engineered restriction sites. the virus derived from either pEAV211 or pEAN551 was used as a wt control in all experiments. at 39.5\u00b0C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed, DMEM/2% FCS was added, and the cells were incubated at 39.5\u00b0C for 16\u201318 h. the overlays were aspirated, cells were fixed with 8% formaldehyde in PBS, and stained with crystal violet. agarose-formaldehyde gels were lysed at 11 h post-transfection. total intracellular RNA was isolated by acid phenol extraction. equal sample loading was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining. gels were subsequently dried and hybridized to a 32P-labeled probe. cDNA fragments derived from the EAV genome were inserted downstream of the T7 promoter in pcDNA3.1 using standard cloning procedures. radiolabelled RNA transcripts were generated by in vitro transcription in the presence of [-32P]CTP (Perkin Elmer) using MAXIscript T7 Kit (Ambion) levels of ()RNA6 and ()RNA7 were determined in samples corresponding to approximately 1.25104 cells and 20 fmol of radiolabelled probe. these conditions ensured that the values obtained were in the linear range of the assays. protein analysis Cells transfected with wt or mutant EAV derivatives were lysed at 11 h post-transfection as described previously. mM EDTA at 55,000 rpm for 45 min at 4\u00b0C using a rotor in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge. complementary DNAs were synthesized using a primer complementary to a region in ORF1a of the EAV genome. a cDNA aliquot was amplified with EAV-specific oligonucleotides EAV418as and EAV417s (5\u2032 CATCTCTTGC mutantwt relative genomic RNA content. wt pfu ratio by mutantwt relative genomic RNA content."}
