{"summary": "early detection of fibrosis progression and the development of portal hypertension is of major relevance in the prognosis and treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. despite attempts to uncover such molecules, this objective has resulted elusive. this is likely related to the natural history of liver disease. 16 healthy volunteers were also included in the study. serum proteomic profile and routine liver and renal function tests were initially analyzed in a training set of 10 recurrent LT patients 6 months post LT. periportal fibrosis (F2), fibrosis beyond the portal tract making septums (F3) and cirrhosis (F4) were loaded onto three different types of protein Chip arrays. the CM10 array showed the highest number of peaks detected and the highest total signal intensity. arrays were air-dried and 1 L of energy-absorbing matrix was added twice to each spot. each spot was read at low (2500 nJ), medium (3000 nJ) and high (3500 nJ) energy laser intensities. peak resolution was optimized within 5.000 m/z, 12.000 m/z or 19.000 m/z according to low, medium or high energy laser intensity. five protein peaks randomly selected over the course of the study were assessed. the intra-assay CV was 11.95% for peak intensity and 0.02% for mass accuracy. inter-assay CV was 21.96% for peak intensity and 0.03% for mass accuracy. all experiments carried out in cell lines were reproduced three times in at least 2 independent assays. conditioned media were harvested, concentrated (801) using 3000 MW Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters. presence of fibrinogen C-chain was assessed by SELDI-TOF-MS. quantitative data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA) Ethics Statement We obtained written informed consent from all patients included in the study. the study was approved by the Investigation and Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona following the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. in 8 and 3 of these patients, the etiology of liver disease was other than viral in the remaining (9 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH; 10 alcoholic liver disease, ALD; 4 autoimmune hepatitis, AH; and 7 cryptogenic) the results were validated in a test set of 83 recurrent LT patients. the resulting spectra from each pool were compared. a peak resolution was optimized within 5.000 m/z, 12.000 m/z or 19.000 m/z according to low, medium or high energy laser intensity. data was processed with the proteinChip Data Manager Client 4.1 software (Bio-Rad) all raw data was normalized by the average total ion current across the group. all spectra differing by twice the standard deviation or more from the mean were deleted. cells were switched to 1% FCS and incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (5% O2, 5% CO2) in a controlled water-jacketed CO2 incubator. conditioned media were harvested, concentrated (801) using 3000 MW Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters. presence of fibrinogen C-chain was assessed by SELDI-TOF-MS. alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirrubin and blood urea nitrogen were measured with the ADVIA 2400 Instrument (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirrubin and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured in all patients by a CE-marked random-access automated clinical immunochemistry analyzer that performs magnetic separation enzyme immunoassay tests. spectrograms obtained from non recurrent and recurrent hepatitis C patients differed from those of recurrent patients. six statistically different peaks, identified as peptides A, B, C, D, and E, were detected. the most remarkable difference was detected on analyzing peptide A (5905 m/z) the upper figure shows all overlapped spectra from HCV-negative patients (n = 9) Arrows indicate peaks showing significantly different intensities between HCV and HCV+ patients. bp0.01, cp0.001, dp0.0001; in comparison to non recurrent HCV subjects. results are given as meanSEM. neither LT nor LT account for mass spectrogram differences in patients with active fibrogenesis.

TGF- reduces the fibrinogen -chain expression in HepG2 cells. fold regulation in fibrinogen Alpha Chain (FGA), Beta Chain (FGB) and Gamma Chain (FGG) genes regulation in HepG2 cells after 6 hours of treatment with TGF- (10 ng/ml) results are given as mean SE; *p0.001 vs. basal. fibrosis progression is accelerated in recurrent hepatitis C, with 15% to 47% of LT recipients developing fibrosis/cirrhosis within the first 3 years post transplantation. fibrosis progression is accelerated in recurrent hepatitis C, with 15% to 47% developing fibrosis/cirrhosis within the first 3 years post transplantation. a protein of 5.9 kDa (protein A) was fully suppressed in the serum of all the patients included in the training set. hepatic enzymes were higher in LT recurrent HCV patients than in fibrotic non-transplant patients. the proteomic profile of the HCV positive samples showed no or very low intensity peaks at the 5.9 kDa spectra. all serum samples included in the test set showed an intensity m/z 5905 peak well below the values found in both healthy subjects and non recurrent HCV patients. however, in most of these samples the A peak was not detected. the fibrinogen C-domain of the human fibrinogen is the C-terminal two-thirds of the A chain that extends from the coiled oil portion of each half of the dimeric fibrinogen molecule [22], [23] the protein shows extensive post translational modification including phosphorylation, sulphation, glycosylation and hydroxylation. only TGF- showed significant regulatory activity on -fibrinogen mRNA expression. however, the fold change in the fibrinogen C-fragment induced by TGF- in HepG2 cells was makedly lower than that observed in fibrotic patients. six protein peaks displaying statistically significant different intensities were observed within a range of 1000 to 25000 m/z. the peak located at 5905 m/z showed the most remarkable difference, since it was fully detected in non-recurrent LT patients. similar results were found when comparing samples of healthy subjects with those of non LT fibrotic patients both positive and negative. to the analysis of the messenger RNA expression of human fibrinogen, and chains.
