{"summary": "the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the therapeutic and safety performance of an intramuscular treatment protocol of multidose of allogeneic adipose stem cells (ASCs) isolated, characterized, and expanded ex vivo from a healthy canine donor weekly for 6 weeks. CAD is complex and multifactorial and involves genetic factors [4,5], immune dysregulation, allergic sensitization, skin barrier defects, cutaneous microbiome, and environmental factors. in humans, some authors consider it to be a systemic Th2-dependent disease [10], while for others, it is primarily a chronic skin inflammation [11]. CAD is considered as an inflammatory disease associated with an aberrant Th2 pattern immune reaction [12]. the use of allogeneic MSCs has shown to be effective and safe in canine diseases [26]. adult MSCs exhibit attractive immunomodulatory properties in degenerative diseases in animals [27]. this is the case of BM-MSC, which exhibits robust immunosuppressive activity. omentum adipose tissue samples were washed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) to eliminate blood clots and were then cut and incubated in a PBS containing 1 mg/ml. a chromatographic test was performed to rule out the presence of E. canis in blood. the cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2. after 3 days, the wells were washed 3-4 times with PBS and the medium was recharged. after reaching 80% of cell confluence in the developing adherent layer, the cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA. the expression of pluripotency factor Oct4 was detected by immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) three hundred microliters of ASCs suspension containing 200,000 cells were placed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. cytometry data were analyzed using a Flujo Guava\u00ae easyCyte flow cytometer (Merck) staining indicates the deposition of bone mineral (calcium phosphate) by osteoblasts. red staining indicates the deposition of bone mineral (calcium phosphate) by osteoblasts. 0.5106 cells/kg were intramuscularly injected weekly for 6 weeks. each dog had received a total of 3.0106 allogeneic ASCs cells/kg at room temperature (20-22\u00b0C) the dogs were evaluated for clinical lesions using the CAD Lesion Index (CADLI) and the pruritus index to record the extent and severity of lesions immediately before the pre-treatment. scores from 0 (normal) to 5 (most severe) were obtained, yielding a final score of 0-50 based on the criteria established by plant. tests were used for testing the normality of data. results were considered statistically significant when p0.05. the protocols were approved by the u.s. ethics committee. a chromatographic test was performed to rule out the presence of E. canis in blood. the fat deposits were obtained using a standard surgical procedure. donor\u2019s owner provided informed consent allowing the use of extracted tissue for research purposes. the cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2. after 3 days, the wells were washed 3-4 times with PBS and the medium was recharged. after reaching 80% of cell confluence in the developing adherent layer, the cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA. canine distemper, canine parvovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus type 2, canine coronavirus, Leptospira, and being Anaplasma, Dirofilaria, Lyme, and Ehrlichia canis free using a SNAP 4Dx Plus test. the fat deposits were obtained using a standard surgical procedure under anesthesia with intravenous xylazine/ketamine (1/10 mg/Kg body weight) donor\u2019s the cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2. after 3 days, the wells were washed 3-4 times with PBS and the medium was recharged. after reaching 80% of cell confluence in the developing adherent layer, the cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA. anti-canine CD 105FITC (VMRD, USA), and anti-canine CD45PECy7 (VMRD, USA) three hundred microliters of ASCs suspension containing 200,000 cells were placed in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 15 L of monoclonal antibodies. a minimum of 10,000 events was acquired and analyzed with a Flujo Guava\u00ae easyCyte flow cytometer (Merck) Chondrogenesis differentiation medium (StemPro, Gibco) was used as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions for chondrogenic induction. the medium was changed every 3rd day, and differentiation was assessed by alcian blue staining. blue staining indicates chondrocyte synthesis of proteoglycans. 0.5106 cells/kg were intramuscularly injected weekly for 6 weeks into the dog\u2019s middle buttock. each dog had received a total of 3.0106 allogeneic ASCs cells/kg at room temperature (20-22\u00b0C) dogs were evaluated for clinical lesions using the CAD Lesion Index (CADLI) and the pruritus index to record the extent and severity of lesions immediately before the pre-treatment and at 6 weeks of post-treatment. scores from 0 (normal) to 5 (most severe) were obtained, yielding a final score of 0-50 based on the criteria established by plant. adipose tissue-derived canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the 4th passage showed a spindle-shaped fibroblastic cell morphology. after 3 weeks, adipose MSCs differentiated according to the conditioning medium added. cells were stained with oil red O staining for osteogenic. the injection of the allogeneic cell product eliminated and/or diminished most of the symptoms of the disease as well as associated comorbidities prevailing at inclusion. CADLI scores and pruritus index obtained analyses showing statistically significant improvement post-therapy. adipose tissue-derived canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) showed a spindle-shaped fibroblastic cell morphology. cells were stained with oil red O staining for osteogenic. CADLI scores and pruritus index obtained analyses showing statistically significant improvement post-therapy. the mean pre-treatment CADLI score was 41.503.729, while the mean post-treatment score was 5.8333.512. this post-treatment improvement was statistically significant (p0.001) clinical symptoms of atopic dermatitis were observed shortly after injection. this effect of ASCs can be attributed to their previously described qualities. these beneficial effects can be related to other mechanisms of stem cell action such as inhibition of effector T-cell proliferation and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. some studies in animals and humans have shown that high doses of stem cells do not necessarily lead to better efficacy. some studies have suggested that high doses of stem cells may have an inverse dose-response effect. authors\u2019 contributions JE designed and performed the study.
