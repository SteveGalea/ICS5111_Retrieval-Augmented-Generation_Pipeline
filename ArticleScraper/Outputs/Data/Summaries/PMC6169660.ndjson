{"summary": "the report outlines the extent to which human activities have degraded the earth\u2019s ecosystems. greenhouse gases and resulting climate change, severe weather patterns, deforestation, desertification, ocean acidification, zoonotic disease outbreaks, biodiversity loss and particulate air pollution. despite such widespread acceptance, the One Health approach has been criticised for an excessive focus on emerging zoonotic diseases. despite such widespread acceptance, the approach has been criticised for an excessive focus on emerging zoonotic diseases, inadequate incorporation of environmental concepts and expertise. Lerner and Berg27 define One Health as a concept that values interdisciplinarity, public health, animal health and ecosystem health. the related concept of EcoHealth is seen as focusing, primarily, on biodiversity as well as participatory knowledge-to-action approaches. Planetary health, by contrast, has a more \u2018anthropocentric\u2019 perspective. the One Health approach deals with interactions that occur between these systems at different levels of complexity. such interactions can take place at a molecular or cellular level. interactions can also occur at an individual level, such as the direct contact between a human and a companion animal. at this level, transmission events occur due to different types of contacts between humans and animals (eg, hunting, occupational, cultural practices, species-specific susceptibility and contaminated environmental sources) the scope and severity of recent Ebola outbreaks may be related to deforestation, which is connected to local food insecurity. widespread pollution by microplastics has considerable economic ramifications. concerns about unsustainable manufacturing processes could affect aquatic ecosystems, including fisheries important to the human food supply. there are reasons to apply a One Health framework that places intrinsic value on considering the health and well-being of animals separate from environmental considerations. the relationship between animals and humans offers important economic and societal impacts, including many positive aspects in relation to non-communicable disease and health. the relationship between animals and humans offers important economic and societal impacts. planetary vision for One Health encourages multidisciplinarity in global health research, education, programme and policy assessments, planning, and implementation. it also requires further development of useful metrics for tracking One Health outcomes, as well as better ways to assess impact. the planetary vision for One Health will help to better connect ongoing global health efforts in disease control and preparedness to larger issues of environmental change, equity and sustainability."}
