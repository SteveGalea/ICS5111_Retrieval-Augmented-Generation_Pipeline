{"summary": "cathepsins are a group of proteolytic enzymes, classically lysosomal in origin. they vary in class, pH optimum, target specificity, inhibition and function. a subset of these proteases was characterized originally as being lysosomal in location and function. there are no published data to indicate whether CTSL promotes infection, as suggested for some viral pathogens, or mitigates it, as in mycoplasma infection. influenza epidemics are associated with major spikes in mortality every year worldwide, and the fortunately rare but more severe pandemics caused by new forms of virus can be catastrophic. CTSL activity is limited at the neutral to alkaline pH typical of extracellular environments. we hypothesize that CTSL is less likely to be a major in vivo activator of influenza A than to support host defense against infection. this hypothesis predicts that influenza will be more severe in mice lacking CTSL. Pneumonia severity was graded histopathologically as described by Beck and colleagues in mice infected with influenza A H3N2 [20]. scores were assigned according to degree of tissue infiltration with inflammatory cells: 0, no inflammation; 1, mild influx of inflammatory cells with cuffing around vessels. serial dilutions of samples were processed in triplicate. a catheter was inserted into exposed tracheal lumen of anesthetized mice. BAL fluid collected from one 0.8-ml aliquot of PBS per mouse was placed on ice and centrifuged. cells were stained for 30 min on ice, washed and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. analysis of Splenocytes Spleens excised from euthanized mice were placed into PBS. cells were then filtered through 70-micron nylon mesh. infected Ctsl-/- and Ctsl++ lung sections using the IHC Toolbox plugin. the plugin supports automated, selective statistical detection of the brown color generated by diaminobenzidine staining. wells were coated with influenza A H1N1 antigen (2 x 105 FFU/well in 50-mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6). mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 50 l of PBS containing 400 focus-forming units of influenza A/H1N1/Puerto Rico/8/34 [19] or with 50 l of sterile PBS alone (sham infection) mice were sacrificed at intervals up to 42. inflammatory cells infected with influenza A H3N2 were graded histopathologically. scores were assigned according to degree of tissue infiltration with inflammatory cells. increased inflammation involving 25\u201350% of lung; 3, severe inflammation involving 50\u201375% of lung; and 4, > 75% of lung infiltrated. stain-SP (streptavidin-peroxidase) with diaminobenzidine as chromogen. serial dilutions of samples were processed in triplicate. sterile, 22-gauge catheter was inserted into exposed tracheal lumen. cells were stained for 30 min on ice, washed and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) cells were then filtered through 70-micron nylon mesh (Elko, Miami Gardens, FL, USA) toolbox plugin supports automated, selective statistical detection of the brown color generated by diaminobenzidine staining. wells were coated with influenza A H1N1 antigen (2 x 105 FFU/well in 50-mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. t-test, log-rank test, or one-way ANOVA were considered to be significant. results weight loss and death after infection compared in age-matched Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mice. both types of mice lost weight after infection. both types of mice developed mononuclear pneumonia within 3 days of infection. by 7 and 14 days, both types of surviving mice manifested severe inflammation. pneumonia severity peaked at 14 days in surviving mice and then decreased. bronchial and alveolar epithelial necrosis and loss of lining cells were detected. by 14 days after initial infection, tissues manifested focal epithelial metaplasia of airways. areas of bronchiolization tended to produce tumor-like \u201cblooms\u201d sharply demarcated from adjacent normal lung. viral antigen persisted in lung and airway epithelium for up to 14 days in Ctsl-/- mice. virus was detected immunohistochemically in lung tissue sections incubated with anti-influenza A antibody. no immunoreactivity was detected in either group of mice 42 days after infection. influenza A was sought by immunohistochemical staining of lung sections from sham-infected animals (A, B) and from mice 3 (C, D), 7 (E, F), 14 (G, H) and 42 (I, J) days after initial infection. inflammatory cells in BAL fluid increased after infection in both types of mice. there was no significant difference in CD8+ cells in infected Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mice. characterization and quantitation of subsets of inflammatory cells in BAL fluid. Spleens were harvested from nave (not infected) mice and from mice 3 days after nasal inoculation with influenza A virus. NK cells are the NK1.1+ subset of CD45+ cells. N = 2 mice in each naive group and 7 mice in each infected group. mice were infected 3, 7 or 14 days, as indicated. data are means SEM of log-transformed titers; N = 4\u20135 mice per group; * P 0.05 (infected Ctsl-/- versus infected Ctsl+/+) body weight and mortality were compared in age-matched Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mice. both types of mice lost weight after infection. mortality was much higher in infected Ctsl-/- mice. both types of mice developed mononuclear pneumonia within 3 days of infection. by 7 and 14 days, pneumonia and mononuclear cell infiltrates remained severe. pneumonia severity peaked at 14 days in surviving mice and then decreased. bronchial and alveolar epithelial necrosis and loss of lining cells were revealed. by 14 days after initial infection, tissues manifested focal epithelial metaplasia of airways. areas of bronchiolization tended to produce tumor-like \u201cblooms\u201d sharply demarcated from adjacent normal lung. however, some regions of lung parenchyma were intact and unaffected. viral antigen persisted in lung and airway epithelium for up to 14 days. no immunoreactivity was detected in either group of mice 42 days after infection. influenza A FFUs increased 5360-fold in Ctsl-/- mice relative to the 400 FFU in the infecting inoculum. intact viral burden was assessed by measuring influenza A FFU in lung homogenates from Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mice 3 days after intranasal inoculation with live influenza A or with PBS alone. no FFU were detected in lungs of sham-infected mice. there was no significant difference in CD8+ cells in infected Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mice at 14 days. the most conspicuous difference was in CD4+ cells, which were profoundly deficient in Ctsl-/- mice at baseline and after 3 days of infection. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are a percentage of the CD3+ subset of CD45+ cells. NK cells are the NK1.1+ subset of CD45+ cells. data are means SEM of log-transformed titers; N = 4\u20135 mice per group; *P 0.05 (infected Ctsl-/- versus infected Ctsl+/+ mice) by one-way ANOVA. pulmonary responses to influenza A in Ctsl-/- mice differ from those of Ctsl+/+ mice. aving pathogen-associated proteins helps Ebola, Hendra and SARS viruses to enter cells. CTSL also allows a non-enveloped reovirus to enter cells by digesting outer capsid proteins to form infectious subvirions. findings suggest that CTSL\u2019s dominant contribution is defense against infection, and that its presence in mice limits respiratory viral burden. CTSL enhances non-influenza viral infectivity is largely based on observations in cultured cells. it is possible that in vivo infections by these or related viruses in Ctsl-/- mice would be poorly tolerated due to immune deficits. depressed proportions of CD4+ splenocytes from Ctsl-/- mice at baseline and after infection may reflect generalized deficiency. innate, heterotypic, or \u201cpre-existing\u201d virus-specific CD4+ cells could protect humans from severe influenza in the absence of detectable pathogen-specific antibodies. deficits of CD4+ cells would also tend to limit their ability to augment killing efficacy of macrophages. mycoplasma and influenza pathogens may differ in the manner in which they provoke a humoral response. many fatal cases of influenza in 1918 were associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia associated dense infiltration of lung parenchyma with neutrophils. neutrophils remained a small fraction of total leukocytes at all examined intervals after infection. findings suggest a critical role for CTSL in containing airway influenza infection in mice. photomicrographs were taken of sections of Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mouse lungs harvested 14 or 42 days after infection with influenza virus. the photomicrographs are high-power views of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mouse lungs harvested 14 or 42 days after infection with influenza virus. CD8 cells were the number of CD45- and CD3-positive lymphocytes that were CD4-positive. NK cells were CD45-positive CD3-negative lymphocytes that were NK1.1-positive. Neutrophils were F/80-negative non-lymphocytes that were Gr-1-positive."}
