{"summary": "renin-angiotensin system component genes are associated with lung adenocarcinoma. ten genes were found to be significantly associated with adenocarcinoma. renin-angiotensin system plays a role in pathology of adenocarcinoma. to assess factors associated with lung adenocarcinomas, a gene expression study was undertaken using the HG-U133A Affymetrix gene chip. to assess factors associated with lung adenocarcinomas, we evaluated the expression of 15 genes of the classical RAS (Figure 1) and extended components of the RAS as reported in a previous study. neprilysin and prolylendopeptidase form Ang 1\u20137 directly from Ang I. the names of genes that encode the various proteins of the RAS are shown in italics after the names of the proteins. the RAS functions primarily to maintain fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and regulate the cardiovascular system. Ang II acting via the AT1 receptor can promote cancer by a variety of mechanisms. Ang II is angiogenic [11, 12] and can promote blood flow to tumors by stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. meta-analyses have been conducted to identify any correlation for cancer incidence in patients taking these drugs and/or the effects of these drugs on cancer risk. there is not universal agreement on the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on cancer incidence. however, a subsequent meta-analysis published in 2010 found no association between the use of ARBs and cancer risk. the study is an in silico analysis of the expression of renin-angiotensin system genes in a population of lung adenocarcinoma patients. a total of 15 renin-angiotensin system related genes were studied. a total of 15 renin-angiotensin system related genes were studied. percent changes in gene expression are reported as numerical values. supplementary data is available online at https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6914976. gene expression in normal lung tissue (open bars n = 49) and lung tumor tissue (solid bars, n = 58) is expressed as Log2 values. gene for the AT1 subtype of the Ang II receptor was most highly expressed in normal lung tissue. the gene expression for both Ang II receptor subtypes was dramatically reduced. ACE, the gene that encodes angiotensinogen was also highly expressed in the normal lung tissue. REN, the gene for renin, the enzyme which cleaves angiotensinogen to make Ang I, was the least highly expressed gene of the classical RAS proteins and its expression level was unchanged in the lung tumor tissue. gene for chymase can facilitate the RAS by converting Ang I to Ang II. expression did not differ between normal lung tissue and lung tumor tissue. gene encodes the AT4 receptor but may have a more important cellular function as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase [30] genes for the primary component proteins of the ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/MAS axis of the RAS, ACE2 and MAS were expressed at low levels in normal lung tissue. expression levels did not differ between normal lung tissue and lung tumor tissue. but expression levels did not differ between normal lung tissue and lung tumor tissue. the gene for the AT1 subtype of the Ang II receptor was the most highly expressed in normal lung tissue. the mRNA for the other major Ang II receptor subtype AT2 was expressed at less than half the intensity as the AT1 receptor subtype. the gene expression for both Ang II receptor subtypes was dramatically reduced, 69 and 74%, respectively. REN expression in lung tumor tissue was also 17% higher than in normal lung tissue. expression of gene for chymase, which can facilitate the RAS by converting Ang I to Ang II, was expressed at a low level and its expression did not differ between normal lung tissue and lung tumor tissue. expression of genes of proteins that directly interact with renin-angiotensin system. gene encodes aminopeptidase N, a major Ang III metabolizing aminopeptidase, also expressed at a moderate level in normal lung tissue. expression levels did not differ between normal lung tissue and lung tumor tissue. ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/MAS axis encodes neprilysin and prolyl carboxypeptidase. neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase), PRCP encodes prolylcarboxypeptidase, and MAS1 encodes MAS (Ang 1\u20137 receptor) p 0.01 by unpaired t test with welch's correction for heterogeneity of variance and Sidak's correction for multiple comparisons. increased expression of the precursor protein of the RAS, angiotensinogen, in lung tumor tissue suggests that there may be an increased activation of the RAS in lung tumor cells. however, there is a non-RAS functionality of angiotensinogen to interact with DNA, in particular to reverse formation of carcinogenic DNA adducts generated by tobacco smoke. the mRNA transcribe from the gene ENPEP encodes aminopeptidase A, also known as angiotensinase A, a major metabolic enzyme of Ang II, is reduced. this could indicate a prolongation of the stimulation of AT1 and AT2 receptors by Ang II. early studies suggest that Ang III lacked the ability to stimulate cell proliferation [37]. a large-scale study of breast cancer tumors revealed an increase in AGTR1 mRNA expression. this is the opposite of what we observed in the lung cancer study. alterations in mRNA expression do not always reflect alterations in protein expression. the current study emphasizes the involvement of components of the RAS (both direct and extended) in the development and progression of lung cancer. the current study also provides a platform to mimic our approach of data mining previously conducted genome-wide expression studies to identify novel therapeutic targets for a variety of cancers and other diseases."}
