{"summary": "the introduction of Zika virus (ZIKV) into the western hemisphere in 2015 triggered an epidemic spanning the Americas (1). there were several remarkable characteristics of this outbreak that had not previously been linked to ZIKV. the virus can cause severe neurological sequelae in the developing fetus (2\u20134) oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L (OAS-RNase L) pathway is initiated by detection of the viral replication intermediate dsRNA by OAS sensors. oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L (OAS-RNase L) pathway is highly effective in inhibiting replication of RNA and DNA viruses. molecule 2-5A binds and activates RNase L, which homodimerizes and targets host and viral ssRNA for cleavage. the molecule 2-5A binds and activates RNase L, which homodimerizes and targets host and viral ssRNA for cleavage. rRNA cleavage was a direct result of RNase L activation. at the earlier time point of 16 h postinfection (hpi) rRNA cleavage was not yet detected. rRNA remained intact in ZIKV-infected A549 cells with either OAS3 or RNase L CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockouts. RNA was harvested and analyzed by using an Agilent bioanalyzer. at 24 hpi RNA was harvested and analyzed by using an Agilent bioanalyzer for rRNA degradation. two different RNase L KO clones were assessed. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed significant increases in RNA levels of ZIKV, SINV, and DENV in RNase L KO cells compared to WT at 24 and 30 hpi. at 16 hpi before RNase L activation, similar levels of genome were detected during ZIKV infection in WT and RNase L KO cells. RNA was harvested at 24 or 30 hpi and analyzed by Northern blotting. A549 cells were infected with ZIKV, SINV, or DENV. RNA was harvested at the indicated times postinfection for qRT-PCR. viral titers were not increased in RNase L KO cells. instead, titers were significantly decreased, albeit modestly, in RNase L KO cells compared to WT. these results were consistently observed at different MOIs. these results were consistently observed at different MOIs as well as in two clones of RNase L KO cells. HT1080 cells infected with ZIKV PR at an MOI of 0.01 and 0.1. D) A549 cells infected with SINV at an MOI of 0.01 and 0.1. the data shown are representative of two to three experiments. A549 WT, MAVS KO, RNase L KO, or STAT2 KO cells infected with ZIKV PR at an MOI of 0.1. no significance found from 24 to 72 hpi between titers from WT and any KO cells is displayed. western blotting for puromycin expression revealed a decline in de novo cellular protein over time in ZIKV-infected WT and RNase L KO cells. expression of the viral protease NS3 increased over time in both cell types, indicating that protein translation arrest during ZIKV infection is independent of RNase L activity. dsRNA ER localization characteristic of ZIKV RFs was detectable in both WT and RNase L KO cells without pIC treatment. by 24 hpi, after which RNase L is activated by ZIKV alone, again detected dsRNA in both WT and RNase L KO cells without pIC. however, once more only in the RNase L KO cells could RF assembly overcome pIC pretreatment. dsRNA expression was only absent in WT cells where RNase L was activated prior to ZIKV infection. dsRNA expression was only absent in WT cells with RNase L activation induced naturally by virus infection. dsRNA expression was only absent in WT cells with RNase L activation induced by virus infection. rRNA was harvested at 2, 16, and 22 hpi for rRNA cleavage analysis. cells were fixed at either 16 or 24 hpi for staining with anti-dsRNA (green) and anti-PDI ER marker (red) primary antibodies and then anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies. the data shown are representative of two to three experiments. ZIKV infection activates the OAS-RNase L pathway. we first assessed the relevance of the host OAS-RNase L pathway to ZIKV infection using a549 cells. rRNA cleavage was maintained during ZIKV or SINV infection of A549 cells with STAT1 or STAT2 gene knockouts (STAT1 KO or STAT2 KO) Cleavage of rRNA was also observed in ZIKV-infected MAVS KO cells, but not in RNase L KO or MAVS/RNase L double KO (DKO) cells, further establishing RNase L catalytic activity as independent of type I NS2B, NS4a, or NS5 regions should each detect the 10.8-kb full-length genome. with each probe and at each time postinfection, genomic RNA levels were reduced in WT cells compared to RNase L KO cells. compared effects on ZIKV genome levels to those of DENV, another related flavivirus, and SINV. RNA accumulated throughout infected RNase L KO cells but not in WT cells. infection was conducted at a higher MOI compared to qRT-PCR and FISH assays. RNA was harvested at 24 or 30 hpi and analyzed by Northern blotting. two different RNase L KO clones were assessed; representative images are shown. the data shown are representative of two experiments. despite a reduction in ZIKV genome levels in WT cells compared to RNase L KO. HT1080 cells infected with ZIKV PR at an MOI of 0.01 and 0.1. SINV and DENV titers were significantly increased in RNase L KO cells compared to WT by 8 or 48 hpi. type I IFN is effectively antagonized by ZIKV and not responsible for lagging viral titers in RNase L KO cells. the statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA. no significance found from 24 to 72 hpi between titers from WT is displayed. many viruses that induce cellular protein translation arrest have found ways to concurrently maintain viral protein synthesis. we therefore investigated whether translation arrest was mediated by RNase L and, if so, whether ZIKV nascent protein synthesis was affected by activation of RNase L. 30 g of protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels for Western blotting. followed by probing with anti-puromycin at 1:6,000 (Millipore, MABE342) for cellular and viral nascent protein and anti-ZIKV NS3 1:1,000 (GeneTex, GTX133309) for changes in viral protein expression. at 16 hpi dsRNA ER localization characteristic of ZIKV RFs was detectable in both WT and RNase L KO cells without pIC treatment. in pIC-treated cells RFs were detectable in the RNase L KO cells but not in WT cells. by 24 hpi, after which RNase L is activated by ZIKV alone, we again detected dsRNA in both WT and RNase L KO cells pIC treatment of MAVS KO cells before ZIKV infection significantly decreased ZIKV production. pIC treatment of MAVS/RNase L DKO cells had no effect on ZIKV titer. pIC treatment of MAVS/RNase L DKO cells had no effect on ZIKV titer. two-way ANOVA comparing WT with or without pIC (**, P 0.01; ****, P 0.0001) or RNase L KO with or without pIC (ns) the means of three replicates the SD are shown. the data shown are representative of two to three experiments. our data suggest that ZIKV genome synthesized within perinuclear RFs was protected from cleavage by activated RNase L. extraneous ZIKV RNA outside RFs is accessible to activated RNase L and thus degraded. RFs may not provide equal protection as those in ZIKV infection. the study also described differences between the composition of cytoskeletal proteins remodeled to generate RFs during infection with ZIKV and DENV. it is likely that RF formation and associated localization of dsRNA and viral genome throughout different stages of the virus replication cycle are determinants for how effective the OAS/RNase L pathway is at limiting virus infection. some HCV strains have evolved resistance to activated RNase L. some reovirus strains replicate more efficiently in the presence of RNase L. some reovirus strains replicate more efficiently in the presence of RNase L due to RNase L-mediated inhibition of host protein translation. a transient delay in ZIKV replication in RNase L KO cells indicates strong antagonism of type I IFN pathway by ZIKV (13\u201316) basal OAS3 levels in ZIKV-infected A549 cells are sufficient for detection of ZIKV dsRNA and subsequent activation of RNase L. a mechanism for a possible proviral role of RNase L during ZIKV infection is therefore focus of ongoing investigation. latent RNase L interaction with the actin cytoskeleton inhibits viral entry. this interaction is disrupted by activation of RNase L (48) A549 cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Gibco, 11875) supplemented with l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco), and 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone). hek 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruv cells were harvested in RLT buffer (RNeasy minikit; Qiagen) and lysed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen) total RNA was extracted and analyzed on RNA microchips using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. cDNA was amplified using virus-specific qRT-PCR primers. a549 cells were seeded into six-well plates and the next day infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 10 for the indicated number of hours. total RNA was extracted, and 5 to 12 g of RNA was resolved on a formaldehyde gel. the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) to ensure equal loading of all RNA samples.
