{"summary": "bats evolved early and changed very little over the past 52 million years. among the large number of viruses detected in bats, 13 of the 15 lyssaviruses were reported to be zoonotic. annually, there are approximately 55,000 human deaths caused by rabies. only a small proportion of bats develop clinical symptoms after experimental infection. this indicates a critical difference in the development of viral disease between bats and other mammals. development of stable cell lines for in vitro studies derived from European bat species is desirable. established cell lines from the European bat M. myotis present a valuable in vitro model to study interactions between lyssaviruses and their natural host. the established cell lines present a valuable in vitro model to study the interactions between lyssaviruses and their natural host. primary cell culture and immortalization A single M. myotis male was captured in Sloupsko-Sosuvske caves of the Moravian Karst. it was kept to minimize stress and handling between capture and euthanasia in a clean plastic box with soft mesh to enable roosting. the bat was kept to minimize stress and handling between capture and euthanasia in a clean plastic box with soft mesh to enable roosting. cells were first fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% triton X. cells were stained with mouse anti-SV40T monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor (Invitrogen) as second antibody and visualized by fluorescence microscope. aSV40T-F aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R aSV40T-R poly I:C stimulation was used to evaluate the IFN response of cell lines. different cell lines were seeded in 24-well plates at a density ranging from 1.2 to 2105 cells/well. 20 hours after stimulation, cells were harvested into RLT buffer (Qiagen) lyssaviruses RABV, EBLV-1 (E. serotinus isolate) and EBLV-2 (M. daubentonii isolate) were infected with EBLV-2 at a MOI of 0.01. qRT-PCR was introduced to measure mRNA expression levels of immune related molecules in response to poly I:C stimulation and virus infection. primers were designed based the sequence resources from our own un-published sequence database and public databases of bat species. the softwares for primers design include primer premier 5, online tools: http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/. established M. myotis cell lines from the single sacrificed specimen have been used to examine bat responses to the infection by Pseudogymnoascus destructans. a paper based on these permits and excemption from law allowing euthanasia of up to 10 M. myotis bats has already been published. Tissues were freshly isolated from the euthanized bat. then minced and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin 100 units/mL and streptomycin 100 mg/mL (Sigma) primary cells were cultured in 6-well plates till confluence reaches 50\u201370%. tis cells derived from brain (cerebrum) (designated MmBr), tonsil (MmTo), peritoneal cavity (MmPca), nasal epithelium (MmNep) and nervus olfactorius (MmNol) were cloned into PCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli competent cells. poly I:C stimulation was used to evaluate the IFN response of M. myotis cell lines and the induction of IFN mediated signaling. poly I:C was used to stimulate the cells. cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density ranging from 1.2 to 2105 cells/well. 20 hours after seeding, cells were harvested into RLT buffer (Qiagen) for RNA extraction by an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) immortalized cell lines were used to check the infectivity of RABV. qRT-PCR was introduced to measure the mRNA expression levels of immune related molecules in response to poly I:C stimulation and virus infection. the selected molecules include IFN induced genes: ISG56, ISG43, myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) and IFN induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3). expressions of cluster of differentiation (CD) 68, a marker for cells of macrophage lineage [38], and CD14, a marker expressed in activated microglia [39] were investigated by RT-PCR in different cell lines. specific primers for CD14, CD68 and internal control -actin were listed in Table 1. the identity of the cell lines was validated by a RT-PCR using ND1 gene as a molecular marker. a predicted 515-bp fragment was obtained from genomic DNA of each cell line. a predicted 515-bp fragment was further confirmed by sequencing. expression levels of TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA5 in MmBr, MmTo, MmPca, MmNep and MmNol were measured by qRT-PCR. expression level of different genes in MmBr showed the lowest expression and was presented as one fold. the established immortalized M. myotis cell lines were transfected with poly I:C (10 g/mL) by lipofectamine 2000. the unstimulated cells were used as blank control. twenty four hours post transfection, the expression level was shown as a related fold and normalized against -actin. ep fully susceptible with a very high replication rate, MmPca and MmTo susceptible with a much less viral replication of EBLV-1 and 2, MmBr susceptible for EBLV-1 and RABV. different susceptibility of the cell lines to lyssavirus infection was further confirmed by the growth kinetics of EBLV-1 in two representative models. mmBr and MmNol cell lines were infected with EBLV-1 at a serial MOI of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0. viral replication levels were measured by qRT-PCR over 72 hpi. mRNA expressions of PRRs and IFN induced genes were investigated. expression patterns of IFN induced genes: ISG56, ISG43, Mx1 and IFIT3 were measured by qRT-PCR at 24 hpi (n = 2). expression level of different molecules in blank group (MOI: 0) in both cell lines MmBr and MmTo was presented as one fold. mRNA expression of SV40T antigen was detected in all cell lines. protein level expression was confirmed in four of the five cell lines. identity of the cell lines was validated by a PCR using ND1 gene. MmBr has the lowest levels of TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA5. about 10-fold higher mRNA levels (p0.05) were observed in MmTo, MmPca, MmNep and MmNol compared to MmBr. the expression of ISG43 ranged from 10 to 145 times more and Mx1 from 2 to 100 times more in MmTo and MmBr respectively. the expression of IFIT3 was up-regulated from 12 to 420 times more in MmTo and MmBr respectively. sensitivity to all three lyssaviruses (MOI of 0.1) could be ordered as MmNol and MmNep fully susceptible with a very high replication rate. MmPca and MmTo susceptible with a much less viral replication of EBLV-1 and RABV with a very low viral replication. the viral replication levels of EBLV-1, EBLV-2 and RABV were lowest in MmBr and presented as one fold respectively. viral replication levels were measured by qRT-PCR over 72 hpi. MmBr and MmTo were infected with RABV at a serial MOI of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0, respectively. expression patterns of PRRs: TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA5 in the infected cells were investigated by qRT-PCR at 24 hpi (n = 2). the expression level of different molecules in blank group was shown as a related fold and normalized against -actin. lyssaviruses developed evasive strategies to escape these host defenses by counteracting the IFN mediated immune responses. the evading and protective mechanisms resulted in an optimal balance, which protect bats as the \u2018natural host\u2019 from severe clinical symptoms or death. studies in bats have to be performed due to the strict protection of the endangered bat species. preliminary results indicate a correlation between the observed varying susceptibility and the ability to up-regulate the PRRs and the IFN induced genes. in the brain derived cell line, the high up-regulations of RIG-1 and MDA5 revealed activation of RIG-I-like receptor pathway during RABV infection. a recent study showed limited expressions of type I IFNs and IFN induced genes during lyssaviruses infection in an E. serotinus brain cell line [33]. a correlation between low viral load and high expression levels of IFN induced genes in MmBr contrasts to the high viral load and a silent expression pattern of antiviral effectors in MmTo. microglial cells are one of the major cell populations in the brain tissue. the established immortalized cell lines from the European bat M. myotis will serve as a useful model to study virus-host interactions and antiviral resistance mechanisms. this study provides a preliminary insight into the antiviral innate immunity correlated to CNS against neurotropic viruses infection in bats."}
