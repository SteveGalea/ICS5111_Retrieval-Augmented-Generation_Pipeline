{"summary": "multiplex PCR followed by analysis of amplified products fills a niche for viral identification when singleplex PCR has failed or there are a few dozen likely candidates. multiplex PCR followed by analysis of amplified products fills a niche for viral identification when singleplex PCR has failed. but the expense of metagenomic sequencing or high-density microarrays is unwarranted. only Greene SCPrimer and HYDEN could handle the two smallest, species-level target sets. we designed the MPP software to avoid the requirement of an MSA. we set out to determine a set of highly conserved \u2018universal\u2019 primers for viruses. family-level primer sets for some families are too large to be practical. amplification with family-level multiplexed sets of short primers could be feasible for viral detection and discovery. we enumerate all candidate oligos fitting user-specific requirements for length, Tm, and lack of hairpin formation. the universal set of primers is the set of selected primers to amplify all genomes in the target set. the primers within a bin should be multiplexed into a single PCR reaction, but each bin should be run separately. alternative strategies could be employed such as starting a new bin with any primer pair that dimerize with other previously selected primers. runs predicting universal viral primers For runs predicting universal viral primers, we designed viral family primers that were unique relative to non-target viral families by replacing any substring of 17 nt or longer that occurs in any non-target family with a substring of \u2018N\u2019\u2019s. draft sequences with multiple contigs were merged into a single sequence entry. only the MP segment sequences from Orthomyxoviridae and the L segment from Bunyaviridae were included. the total number of target sequences for these all virus runs was 11 477. the number of primers in the universal set for all viruses is shown, as a function of primer size. based on sequence data available as of 25 April 2007 and imposing Tm constraints in primer selection, or without Tm or GC% constraints. average SD of the top 10 bins for each primer length. we divided the universal primer bins of 20 primers/bin into two bins each. a random selection of 35 sequences for each target was aligned with MUSCLE (30) for the HIV-1 and influenza A segments HA and NA, MUSCLE ran out of memory before completing. the alignment was used to build a profile Hidden Markov Model (hmmbuild) using HMMer. on to calculate 10-mer primers (hours) NA segment of Influenza A* 6375 52 120

including lab strains, were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database. all PCR experiments were prepared using the superscript III RT-PCR kit. each 25 l reaction contained 1 SSIII buffer, 1 U of SSIII RT/Taq enzyme, 4.8 mM MgSO4, 0.1 M each primer, and a viral template mass of 2.7 pg (104 copies) we first optimized master mix conditions, where it was determined that a 4.8 mM MgSO4 concentration resulted in most optimal amplification. as such, we determined the optimal annealing temperature based on results from annealing temperature gradient experiments. a constant concentration of 2.7 pg (1.3 104 copies) and serial dilutions of human genomic DNA were added to the vaccinia PCR reaction mix. these experiments were performed using mass ratios of vaccinia:human DNA at 1 : 1, 10 : 1, 100 : 1, 1000 : 1 and 10000 : 1. single reactions contained 4 l of Ready Reaction Mix, 0.2-M primer, 2 l 5 Sequencing Buffer, 11.5 l of nuclease free water and 2 l of post-Exosap-it PCR product. results were analyzed using Sequencing Analysis v5.2 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) the universal set of primers is the set of selected primers to amplify all genomes in the target set. the primers within a bin should be multiplexed into a single PCR reaction, but each bin should be run separately. this is a simple binning strategy, and alternative strategies could be employed. for all Tm and free energy predictions, we used the following unafold settings: [Na+] = 0.2 M, [Mg+] = 0.0015, annealing temperature = 30\u00b0C, and strand concentration of each strand = 10\u20137 M, making the total strand concentration of both strands = 2 10\u20137 M. the algorithm described here focuses on finding conserved primers. draft sequences with multiple contigs were merged into a single sequence entry. only the MP segment sequences from Orthomyxoviridae and the L segment from Bunyaviridae were included. the total number of target sequences for these all virus runs was 11 477. the number of primers in the universal set for all viruses is shown, as a function of primer size. we predicted a universal viral primer set for all viral genomes and segments available as of 1 January 2004. amplification was calculated by dividing priming sets in half, with 10 primers per reaction. average SD of the top 10 bins for each primer length. for bin size of 10, we divided the universal primer bins into two bins each. a random selection of 35 sequences for each target was aligned with MUSCLE (30) for the HIV-1 and influenza A segments HA and NA, MUSCLE ran out of memory before

were analyzed using Sequencing Analysis v5.2 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) a universal primer set predicted using the 2004 sequence data would amplify only 35% of the 2007 sequences using primers of at least 10 nt in length. shorter primers increase this fraction to over 60%, due to the higher likelihood of occurrence and conservation of shorter oligos. a multiplex of 7-mers is not guaranteed to amplify a fragment from every virus. multiplexes of 10-mer primers are expected to produce hundreds of amplicons from the human genome. an amplicon requires that two occur in proximity. imperfect sample purification to eliminate eukaryotic nucleic acids could be problematic for universal viral priming using primers shorter than 15 bases. 65% and 78% for 100-bp and 600-bp fragments had hits in the correct family with an average of 59 hits per amplicon. 2.8% had hits in other families with an average of 2.4 hits per amplicon. amplify more conserved regions than randomly selected fragments. some families with many genomes can be amplified with relatively few primers. some families with many genomes can be amplified with relatively few primers. the sizes of the family-level primer sets show a trend for an increase. a large fraction of targets are amplified with only 2 primers. addition of subsequent primers shows diminishing returns in amplifying fewer, more divergent targets not detected by the initial primer pair. the true diminishing returns depend on the extent to which available sequence data is anunbiased representation of diversity. 487 of the 1175 genomes (41%) do not contain a sequence match for this primer pair. the size of the longest conserved region from the 95% consensus is only 5 bases. for FMDV and norwalk virus, the longest 100% conserved regions are 9 and 6 bases, respectively. a cap on the maximum number of candidate primers to be tested must be imposed. the most common oligos may not occur in the correct orientation or distance. the most common oligos may not occur in the correct orientation or distance to serve as primer pairs. the Primaclade (24) webserver timed out for the smallest alignments we tested, norwalk and FMDV. HYDEN (22) also generated degenerate candidates from a MSA. the length is limited to a single value rather than a range. sensitivity may be reduced compared to nondegenerate priming. the best of those primer combinations would require 6 primers, one of which had 2-fold and another had 3-fold degeneracy. however, the small number of signatures predicted by HYDEN is desirable for some applications. xed primer set without a MSA for any of the target sets we examined. only HYDEN and GreeneSCPrimer completed for the two smallest target sets. if target sets are sufficiently conserved so that a reasonable MSA can be built, these tools may be preferable over MPP. the arrow on the left points to the expected band (617 bp) the arrows on the left correspond to the 50-bp DNA ladder. the amplicon observed in gel analysis was a specifically amplified product from vaccinia virus, Lister strain (AY678276.1) with a query coverage of 99% and an e-score of 0. these values indicate that the sequenced product was vaccinia DNA and not amplification from an exogenous nu primers of 10 nt each amplifies only the specific predicted band from vaccinia. in some applications, the exogenous nucleic acids from other eukaryotic sources may be present in varying and unknown concentrations. we performed PCR reactions across a series of mass ratios of vaccinia. we tested the 16-plex primers against the same mass of human DNA in the absence of vaccinia DNA at 2.7 pg (the 1 : 1 ratio mass), 0.027 pg (100 : 1 mass) and 2.7 104 pg (10000 : 1 mass) the data show a similar smear at 2.7 pg as was observed when vaccinia DNA was present (lane 6) four conserved Orthopoxvirus primers from an earlier publication (37) do not match 53 genomes. the primers included inosine bases, which we replaced with each possible A, T, G and C base in all possible combinations. a universal primer set predicted using the 2004 sequence data would amplify only 35% of the 2007 sequences using primers of at least 10 nt in length. shorter primers increase this fraction to over 60%, due to the higher likelihood of occurrence and conservation of shorter oligos. universal viral primers amplify more conserved regions than randomly selected fragments. universal primers do amplify more conserved regions than randomly selected fragments. imperfect sample purification to eliminate eukaryotic nucleic acids could be problematic. at least one amplicon of 200\u2013800 bp was required from every genome. at least one amplicon of 200\u2013800 bp was required from every genome. amplicon of 200\u2013800 bp was required from every genome. the sizes of the family-level primer sets show a trend for an increase with the number of available sequences in the family. the sizes of the family-level primer sets show a trend for an increase with the number of available sequences in the family. the percentage of genomes amplified versus the number of primers used for primers of either 10-mers or 17-18-mers. the two most highly conserved primers amplify a large fraction of genomes, and additional primers show diminishing returns in detecting the remaining, more divergent sequences. the longest 100% conserved regions are 9 and 6 bases. the MPP software makes it straightforward for a nonexpert to predict a multiplex-compatible set of primers to amplify all targets. fastPCR and GeneUp were the only programs that did not require an MSA. the most common oligos may not occur in the correct orientation or distance to serve as primer pairs. the most common oligos may not occur in the correct orientation or distance to serve as primer pairs. a copy of the GeneUp software for testing could not be obtained from the authors. the greeneSCPrimer option requiring the fewest total primers for the Norwalk set required 18 primers. the actual number of priming sequences would be 26, compared to a total of 20 non-degenerate primers predicted by MPP. the best of those primer combinations would require 6 primers, one of which had 2-fold and another had 3-fold degeneracy. this compares with two primers each with 4-fold degeneracy using HYDEN (eight priming sequences in a reaction), to amplify 98% (183 of 187) targets. Poxviridae experimental results Using the experimental conditions described in the \u2018Methods\u2019 section, we tested the Poxviridae 16-plex (Table 4) against vaccinia virus, Lister strain DNA. the band does not appear in the no template control shown in lane 4. an analysis of the high-quality sequence read data from the electropherogram yielded a 95% identity (maximum) to vaccinia virus, Lister strain (AY678276.1) with a query coverage of 99% and an e-score of 0. these values indicate that the sequenced product was vaccinia DNA and not amplification from an exogenous nucleic acid source, e.g. host cell. notably, our multiplex reaction did ridae 16-plex primer set, we conducted PCR reactions across a series of mass ratios of vaccinia lister DNA:human genomic DNA. these correspond to approximate copy number ratios of vaccinia : human genomes of 1.3 104 : 0.82, 1.3 104 : 0.082, 1.3 104 : 0.0082, 1.3 104 : 0.00082 and 1.3 104 : 0.000082. the data show a similar smear at 2.7 pg as was observed when vaccinia DNA was present (lane 6). however, the low-intensity 617-bp amplicon from vaccinia is visible in lane 6 (with vaccinia) while a similar amplicon is not present in lane 12 (without vaccina). primers included inosine bases, which we replaced with each possible A, T, G and C base in all possible combinations for our primer-target comparison. some methods are limited in scalability, particularly those requiring a MSA as input. predicting a universal primer set requires only minutes up to a few hours. if short primers are used, thousands of priming sequences would be required to amplify all sequenced viruses. MPP could be used to design multiplex primer sets for homologs in a gene family. at a mass ratio of 1 : 1 vaccinia:human DNA, there are 2.7 pg or 0.82 copies of the human genome present in the reaction. this represents the impact that 41% of the total DNA content from one human cell could have on the results. in a clinical sample, there could be a much greater number of human cells and DNA. gel electrophoresis for genetic fingerprinting of eukaryotes and bacteria. primer size would need to be as short as 5-mers to rely on a gel banding pattern. imperfect sample purification to eliminate eukaryotic nucleic acids could be problematic for universal viral priming. code and Primer Availability Primer sets are available as supplemental material or by request from the authors. the MPP software is freely available for academic and nonprofit use."}
