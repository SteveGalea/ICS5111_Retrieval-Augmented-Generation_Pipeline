{"summary": "the recent pandemic of swineorigin H1N1 2009 influenza A (H1N1/2009) virus 1, 2 and outbreaks of human cases of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) 3 have prompted the development of diagnosis methods. rapid diagnostic kits (RDKs) based on immunochromatography utilizing antibodies against nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus are used to diagnose influenza. mAbs recognized residues identified as signature amino acids in each NP. these results indicated that hostspecific amino acids of NP could discriminate influenza A viruses from different origin. mAb 3G2 was prepared by immunization of GANP MiceTM. ELISA analysis of mAbs Reactivity of the mAbs with NPs derived from seasonal influenza, H1N1/2009, and H5N1 was analyzed. 10 ng of NP proteins dissolved in PBST was added to each well. in conventional ELISA, 50 ng/wells of antigens were fixed onto the plates directly. epitope mapping of mAb using recombinant NP fragments or synthetic peptides. the resultant NP constructs were expressed in HEK293 cell as described above and used for epitope mapping using 50 ng/well of M322211. the fulllength amino acid sequence data of NP registered at NCBI dated 2005 to 2011 were retrieved. number of sequences retrieved was 1917. mAbs were prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlusRIPL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and used to immunize 7\u20139weekold female WKY rats. mAb 3G2 was prepared by immunization of GANP MiceTM (TransGenic Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) rabbit antiNP polyclonal Ab dissolved in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 90) was fixed to each well of a 96well microtiter plate at room temperature for 1 h. after washing with phosphatebuffered saline containing 002% Tween20 (PBST) and blocking with superBlock, 10 ng of the NP proteins dissolved in PBST was added to each well. epitope mapping of mAb using mutant NP proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. NP proteins containing signature amino acids were produced by conventional PCR using megaprimers to introduce codons corresponding to each amino acid. signature amino acids found in NPs from H1N1/2009 and HPAI viruses Largescale sequence analyses revealed signature amino acids at specific positions in viral proteins including NPs that distinguish human influenza viruses from avian viruses. these residues may be the keys to distinguish human seasonal viruses from HPAI. mAb 3A4 is one of the mAbs that was generated by immunization of recombinant NP from H1N1/2009 viruses. to further narrow down the epitope of 3A4, we prepared 7 overlapping fragments of H1N1/2009 virus NP. a peptide corresponding to residues 31\u201345 reacted with 3A4. it also reacted to the positive control mAb and negative control IgG. comparison of the corresponding sequences in human, HPAI, and H1N1/2009 viruses indicated that only N21D varied specifically in NP from H1N1/2009 viruses. mAb 3G2 was raised against recombinant NP from H1N1/2009 viruses by a method similar to that used for 3A4. 3G2 reacted with NP from H1N1/2009 virus and to a lesser extent with NP from HPAI virus, but did not react with those from human seasonal viruses. mAb 3A4 reacts only with NPs of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses by 3G2. mAb 3A4 was used as a positive control. mAb 3A4 was used as a positive control. recombinant avian NP carrying R100V mutation reverted signature mutation in NP of HPAI virus to that of H1N1/2009 virus. mAb reactive with NP of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. lm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/ found 5 and 9 signature residues specific for HPAI viruses and H1N1/2009 viruses. these residues may be the keys to distinguish human seasonal viruses from HPAI and H1N1/2009 viruses using mAbs recognizing the viral NP proteins. mAb 3A4 is one of the mAbs that was generated by immunization of recombinant NP from H1N1/2009 viruses. the results indicated that 3A4 reacted with NP from H1N1/2009 virus only (Figure 1A) mAb reactive with NP of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. mAb reactive with NP of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. 3G2 reacted specifically with a peptide corresponding to residues 455\u2013469 of NPs from human and HPAI viruses. results showed that 3G2 reacted with H1N1/2009type peptide and to a lesser extent with HPAItype peptide but not with the humantype peptide. m322211 is a commercial mAb that was previously found to react with NPs from human and H1N1/2009 viruses but not with that from HPAI virus. 6 M322211 did not react with recombinant NP fragments (data not shown) mAb reactive with NP of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. mAb reactive with NP of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. specific and 3A4 reacted specifically with a peptide corresponding to residues 11\u201325 of HPAI against 3A4. reactivity of 3A4 with NPs from human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. 3G2 reacted with NP from H1N1/2009 virus and to a lesser extent with NP from HPAI virus, but did not react with those from human seasonal viruses. reactivity against NP fragments showed that the epitope of 3G2 was located in residues 383 \u2013 498 (Full and F3). mAb 3A4 reacts only with NPs of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses. peptide corresponding to residues 445\u2013459 of the NP protein of H1N1/2009 virus was used as a negative control. m322211 is a commercial mAb that was previously found to react with NPs from human and avian viruses but not with that from HPAI virus. mAb reactive with NP of human, H1N1/2009, and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. mAb reactive with NP of H1N1/2009 and HPAI viruses 6 was used as a positive control. NP sequences of human, avian, and swineorigin influenza viruses reported from 2005 to 2011 were included into the analysis. the signature residues are responsible for the discrimination of NP among viruses of different origin by particular antibodies. positions 100, 305, and 357, and those of H1N1/2009 NP at positions 21, 53, 313, 316, 371, and 433 are likely candidates for recognition by antibodies. we identified key amino acid residues in the NP protein, which could discriminate influenza A viruses based on the viral origin. the viral polymerase mediates adaptation of an avian influenza virus to a mammalian host. the viral polymerase mediates adaptation of an avian influenza virus to a mammalian host.
