{"summary": "acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes fatal human respiratory disease (1\u20133) most patients who die of SARS develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of ALI (6, 7). recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory infections of emerging viruses highlight the need to characterize the mechanisms responsible for virus-mediated ALI or ARDS. macrophages show a phenotype of classically activated macrophages. these cells mediate host defenses against viruses and promote lung injury. macrophages may become alternatively activated, exerting antiinflammatory function and regulating wound healing by producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), growth factors, and antiinflammatory cytokines. most patients (70%\u201380%) presented with abnormal chest radiographs. approximately one-quarter of these individuals progressed to ALI. anti-S neutralizing antibody response developed significantly faster in deceased patients compared with recovered patients. rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) compared pathological changes in the lungs of rhesus macaques vaccinated with a modified vaccinia Ankara virus encoding full-length SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (ADS-MVA). three healthy macaques were included as controls. SARS-CoV RNA was readily detected on oral swabs from all control macaques examined at multiple time points using real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) but only in 3 of the 8 ADS-MVA\u2013vaccinated macaques with lower NAb titers at 2 dpi (SL11, SE13, and SL14) suggesting reduced productive viral infection in the immunized macaques through S-specific immunity. dation (yellow arrow), hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls (black arrows) and massive cell infiltration in alveolar cavities (white arrow) dation (yellow arrow), hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls (black arrows), and mass cell infiltration in alveolar cavities (white arrow) in the control vaccinated group, 5 macaques showed minor inflammation with slight septa broadening and inflammatory cells infiltration. only 1 macaque showed typical symptoms of acute DAD with extensive exudation and cell infiltration at 35 dpi (CL26, CE24; Supplemental Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 2). anti\u2013S-IgG induced severe lung injury during acute SARS-CoV infection. i.n. inoculation of Chinese macaques with SARS-CoVPUMC led to lower respiratory tract infection in all animals within 2 days (25) but most of them rapidly cleared infection in the lungs, and all of the animals exhibited mild lung lesions before 3 dpi. sera from macaques that received low- or high-dose S-IgG showed neutralizing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 10\u2013260 and 1,000\u201310,000. macaques in the low-dose and control groups displayed increased NAb titers over time. only 2 of 6 animals (33%) in the high-dose group were viral RNA+. RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in the swabs from one of the high-dose S-IgG\u2013treated macaques (n = 6), 3 low-dose S-IgG\u2013treated macaques (n = 6), and 2 C-IgG\u2013treated macaques (n = 2) at the indicated time points. topathological examination of the lungs indicated minor and moderate inflammation at day 2 and 21 in C-IgG recipients. only 1 of 5 C-IgG and control ADC-MVA vaccine recipients showed acute DAD. despite viral suppression, the presence of S-IgG caused severe ALI that persists until late stages. viral RNA was detected in pneumocytes of 1 macaque in the high-dose (HS02, 33%), 2 macaques in the low-dose (LS01, LS02; 66%), and the C-IgG\u2013treated macaque. an NP antibody identified positive signals in the lungs and hilar LNs of all S-IgG and C-IgG recipients but not healthy controls. Tissue samples are double-immunostained for the SARS-CoV NP (TRITC) and markers for macrophages, including MAC387 (FITC), CD163 (FITC), and CD68 (FITC) compared with previous findings in SARS-CoV\u2013inoculated naive Chinese macaques (n = 4) (25), double-immunostaining with the NP antibody and antibodies specific to the stages of macrophage differentiation elevated serum levels of IL-8 were observed in macaques treated with high-dose S-IgG at 2 dpi. the IL-8 levels are strongly correlated with anti\u2013SARS-CoV NAb titers. IL-8 is a macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokine important in initiating ALI. es were shown in the lungs of Chinese rhesus macaques at steady state. they are interstitial macrophages (IMs; MAC387+HAM56\u2013CD206\u2013) and resident alveolar macrophages (AMs; CD68+ HAM56\u2013) expressing low levels of CD163 and CD206, a marker specific to the macrophage wound-healing response, corresponding to their intrinsic antiinflammatory function. monocytes/macrophages subpopulations were triple-immunostained with antibodies for CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and MAC387 (TRITC) these sections were triple-immunostained with antibodies for CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and MAC387 (TRITC) (A, C, and E); CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and CD68 (TRITC) (lower panel in B IMMs include newly infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (MAC387+) (E, green arrow) and inflammatory macrophages that are CD68+HAM56\u2013 (green arrow, F, upper panel) and CD163+ CD206\u2013HAM56\u2013 (green arrow, F, lower panel). the majority of CD163+HAM56\u2013 IMMs coexpressed CD68. resident macrophages in the lungs of S-IgG recipients no longer express CD206. IL-6 favors macrophage accumulation at the site of injury. viral RNA+ alveolar pneumocytes were primarily found at 2 dpi (2 of 4 macaques) at 7 dpi, viral RNA was detectable in the lungs of 2 macaques, AD0516 and AD0518. only few scattered NP+ cells were found in AD0517. nested RT-PCR detected in swabs from 3 macaques and lung homogenates. sections stained for SARS-CoV NP (red) and nucleus (blue) by IHC. substantial inflammatory infiltrates were only observed in AD0516 (green arrows) temporal analysis of macrophage heterogeneity revealed significantly increased number of IMMs (CD163+CD206\u2013) in viral RNA+ lungs at 2 dpi. the IMMs diminished at 3 dpi (4 of 4 macaques) and became nearly completely absent at 7 dpi in macaques without productive pulmonary viral infection (2 of 4 macaques, AD0515 and AD0517) polarized alternatively activated human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) treated for 20 hours with SARS-CoV pseudovirus and heat-inactivated sera of high-dose S-IgG\u2013treated macaques (S-IgG sera) collected at 2 dpi. compared with alternatively activated MDM in parallel. administration of S-IgG sera had no effect on cytokine production by alternatively activated MDM. IL-8 and IL-8 are key cytokines that regulate monocytes/macrophages migration and promote neutrophils infiltration. IL-6 promotes persistent inflammation and injury. S-IgG significantly amplified proinflammatory cytokine production by SARS-CoV\u2013treated alternatively activated macrophages. in vitro\u2013polarized alternatively activated macrophages were left unstimulated or incubated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus alone or cocultured with SARS-CoV pseudovirus. sera from high-dose S-IgG group (n = 6) or C-IgG group (n = 2) collected at 2 d addition of sera (1:4,000 diluted) from high-dose S-IgG\u2013treated (HST), C-IgG treated macaques (CT) had no effect on IL-8 (I), MCP1 (J) and IL-6 (K) production by SARS-CoV\u2013treated classically activated MDM. blockade of FcR significantly reduced antiserum-enhanced IL-8 secretion and partially reduced MCP1 secretion. significantly higher levels of anti-S NAbs were detected in the sera of deceased patients (n = 6) during acute infection compared with recovered patients (n = 8). phenotype analysis of accumulating monocytes/macrophages in the lungs. anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibody modifies wound-healing response during SARS-CoV infection partially through the FcR. macrophages treated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus or sera alone were included as controls. we then examined protein levels of cytokines/chemokines in the cell culture supernatant. administration of sera from recovered patients had no effect on cytokine production except 1 sample. sera from deceased SARS patients skewed wound-healing macrophage response partially through FcR. in vitro\u2013polarized alternatively activated MDM were either left unstimulated or were incubated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus alone or cocultured with SARS-CoV pseudovirus. cells treated with sera from patients served as controls. ed cytokine and chemokine levels were measured in the culture supernatant. data represent mean values or mean values SEM of at least 3 independent experiments. two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t test and Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test were used for statistical analysis. from 38.6\u00b0C\u201339.2\u00b0C, and sera from control vaccinated macaques showed increased neutralizing activity after 14 dpi, indicating establishment of infection. RNA was readily detected on oral swabs from all control macaques examined at multiple time points using real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) but only in 3 of the 8 ADS-MVA\u2013vaccinated macaques with lower NAb titers at 2 d symptom of acute DAD exhibited in 6 of 8 macaques receiving ADC-MVA (n = 8) with extensive exudation (yellow arrow), hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls (black arrows) and massive cell infiltration in alveolar cavities (white arrow) 5 macaques showed minor inflammation with slight septa broadening. two macaques showed moderate inflammation with more interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration. only 1 macaque showed typical symptoms of acute DAD with extensive exudation and cell infiltration at 35 dpi. anti\u2013S-IgG induced severe lung injury during acute SARS-CoV infection. i.n. inoculation of Chinese macaques with SARS-CoVPUMC led to lower respiratory tract infection in all animals within 2 days (25) but most of them rapidly cleared infection in the lungs, and all of the animals exhibited mild lung lesions before 3 dpi. macaques that received low- or high-dose S-IgG showed neutralizing activity. at day 2, sera from macaques that received low- or high-dose S-IgG showed neutralizing activity, with IC50 values ranging from 10\u2013260 and 1,000\u201310,000. macaques in the low-dose and control groups displayed increased NAb titers over time. ques were challenged with SARS-CoVPUMC (1 105 TCID50) half of the animals from each group were sacrificed at 2 and 21 dpi. RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in oral swabs. despite viral suppression, the presence of S-IgG at the acute stage of SARS-CoV infection caused severe ALI that persists until late stages. despite viral suppression, the presence of S-IgG caused severe ALI that persists until late stages. viral RNA was detected in pneumocytes of 1 macaque in the high-dose (HS02, 33%), 2 macaques in the low-dose (LS01, LS02; 66%), and the C-IgG\u2013treated macaque. an NP antibody identified positive signals in the lungs and hilar LNs of all S-IgG and C-IgG recipients but not healthy controls. Tissue samples are double-immunostained for the SARS-CoV NP (TRITC) and markers for macrophages, including MAC387 (FITC), CD163 (FITC), and CD68 (FITC) compared with previous findings in SARS-CoV\u2013inoculated naive Chinese macaques (n = 4) (25), double-immunostaining with the NP antibody and antibodies specific to the stages of macrophage differentiation increased serum levels of IL-8 were observed in macaques treated with high-dose S-IgG at 2 dpi. IL-8 is a macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokine important in initiating ALI. macaques assumed a wound-healing function as early as 2 dpi in macaques not treated with S-IgG. two subpopulations of resident macrophages were shown in the lungs of Chinese rhesus macaques at steady state as previously described (29) they are interstitial macrophages (IMs; MAC387+HAM56\u2013CD206\u2013) and resident alveolar macrophages (AMs; CD68+ HAM56\u2013) expressing low levels of CD163 and CD206, a marker specific to the macrophage wound-healing response. monocytes/macrophages subpopulations were triple-immunostained with antibodies for CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and MAC387 (TRITC) these sections were triple-immunostained with antibodies for CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and MAC387 (TRITC) (A, C, and E); CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and CD68 (TRITC) (lower panel in B IMMs include newly infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (MAC387+) (E, green arrow) and inflammatory macrophages that are CD68+HAM56\u2013 (green arrow, F, upper panel) and CD163+ CD206\u2013HAM56\u2013 (green arrow, F, lower panel). the majority of CD163+HAM56\u2013 IMMs coexpressed CD68. this suggests a change of function of this subpopulation by S-IgG. resident macrophages in the lungs of S-IgG recipients no longer express CD206. viral RNA+ alveolar pneumocytes were primarily found at 2 dpi (2 of 4 macaques) at 7 dpi, viral RNA was detectable in the lungs of 2 macaques, AD0516 and AD0518. only few scattered NP+ cells were found in AD0517. RNA was detected using nested RT-PCR in swabs from 3 macaques. sections stained for SARS-CoV NP (red) and nucleus (blue) by IHC. significant inflammatory infiltrates were only observed in AD0516 (green arrows) temporal analysis of macrophage heterogeneity revealed significantly increased number of IMMs (CD163+CD206\u2013) in viral RNA+ lungs at 2 dpi. the IMMs diminished at 3 dpi (4 of 4 macaques) and became nearly completely absent at 7 dpi in macaques without productive pulmonary viral infection (2 of 4 macaques, AD0515 and AD0517) in vitro\u2013polarized classically activated MDM produced high levels of IL-8 and IL-6. alternatively activated MDM only produced minimal levels of those cytokines. administration of S-IgG sera caused dose-dependent increase in production. cytokines in SARS-CoV\u2013stimulated alternatively activated MDM resulted in a greater than 10-fold increase in IL-6, an 8-fold increase in MCP1 and a 5-fold increase in IL-8. administration of S-IgG sera had no effect on cytokine production by SARS-CoV\u2013treated classically activated MDM. cytokines are key cytokines that regulate monocytes/macrophages migration and promote S-IgG significantly amplified proinflammatory cytokine production. in vitro\u2013polarized alternatively activated macrophages were left unstimulated or incubated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus alone or cocultured with SARS-CoV pseudovirus. sera from S-IgG recipients caused dose-dependent increase in cytokine production by alternatively activated MDM. addition of sera (1:4,000 diluted) from high-dose S-IgG\u2013treated (HST), but not C-IgG treated macaques (CT) or healthy controls (HCT) had no effect on IL-8 (I), MCP1 (J), and IL-6 (K) production by SARS-CoV\u2013treated classically activated MDM. marker CD206+ indicating predominantly proinflammatory macrophage activation and reduced inflammatory-resolving response. significantly higher levels of anti-S NAbs were detected in the sera of deceased patients (n = 6) during acute infection compared with recovered patients (n = 8). antisera from deceased SARS patients skewed wound-healing response during SARS-CoV infection partially through the FcR. unpaired Student\u2019s t test was used for statistical analysis. IL-8 production strongly correlates with NAb titer of sera from deceased patients. sera from deceased SARS patients skewed wound-healing macrophage response partially through FcR. in vitro\u2013polarized alternatively activated MDM were either left unstimulated or incubated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus alone or cocultured with SARS-CoV pseudovirus. cells treated with sera from deceased (n = 5) or recovered SARS patients (n = 7) for 20 hours. secreted cytokine and chemokine levels were measured in culture supernatant. data represent mean values or mean values SEM of at least 3 independent experiments. two-tailed unpaired student\u2019s t test and Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test were used for statistical analysis. a protective effect against pulmonary immunopathology mediated by full length S protein\u2013based vaccine in SARS-CoV\u2013infected nonhuman primate models has not been described. atypical measles and dengue hemorrhagic fever, as well as several respiratory diseases. augmentation of disease by vaccination has been described in studies of atypical measles and dengue hemorrhagic fever. SARS-CoV infection of macaques is often characterized by the rapid control of viral replication with mild lung lesions in most macaques. the mechanisms underlying why Chinese macaques do not often develop ALI are largely unknown. a recent study reported that pathogenic immune complexes promoted lung injury during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. it remains unknown whether immune complexes may also play a role in driving ALI during SARS-CoV infection. a detailed flow cytometric analysis would be helpful to further characterize macrophage subpopulations in infected lungs. patients who received convalescent plasma from recovered SARS patients had shorter hospital stays and lower mortality rates without evident adverse effects (45\u201347). these results might reflect a different quality of antibodies in recovered patients from deceased patients during early infection. yrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) counteracts signals that are mediated by activating FcRs. human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages express higher levels of CD16 (FcRIII) and CD32A (FcRIIA) (50) therefore, it is likely that S-IgG promoted proinflammatory cytokine production through FcRI and/or FcRIIA. an additional 3 uninfected macaques were inoculated with PBS as negative controls. all animals were humanely euthanized with an i.v. overdose of pentobarbital. a neutralization assay was established to determine humoral immune responses. infected cells were lysed to measure luciferase activity. RT-PCR was performed in a 50 l reaction volume. RNA was isolated using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) fluor 448 conjugated goat anti\u2013rabbit IgG antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. additional immunofluorescence staining was performed overnight incubation with primary antibodies. ISH was developed for the detection of SARS-CoV. excess probe was removed by washing twice in 2 SSC for 20 minutes at 45\u00b0C. the sections were incubated with sheep anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (11093274910, Roche Diagnostics) diluted at 1: 500 for 2 hours at room temperature. monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from blood buffy coats. monkey peripheral blood was obtained in heparinized vacutainer collection tubes. monocytes were differentiated in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33 in monkey sera and in culture medium were quantified using multiplexing laser bead technology (BioLegend) to assess the cytokine production of macrophages, in vitro\u2013polarized cells were washed 3 times with PBS and were activated with SARS-CoV pseudotype virus. eight of these animals received ADS-MVA, whereas the other 8 received ADC-MVA. vaccine strain SARS-CoV HKU39849 shares 100% sequence homology of the S gene with the challenge strain SARS-CoVPUMC (AY350750) a neutralization assay was established to determine the humoral immune responses generated by the vaccine. the pseudotype virus was generated through cotransfection of 293T cells with 2 plasmids, pcDNA-Sopt9 and pNL4-3Luc_Env_Vpr_. pharyngeal swab samples from infected macaques were inoculated onto vero-E6 cells. both cytopathic effect (CPE) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were used to determine the infection status of the animals. ISH was developed for the detection of SARS-CoV. DNA fragments of N and S proteins from the SARS-CoV strain were used as templates to generate RNA probes. confocal microscopy was performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope equipped with 4 lasers (Zeiss) the 4 channels were collected: Alexa Fluor 568 and HNPP/Fast Red, which fluoresces when exposed to a 568-nm wavelength laser and appears red. monocytes were differentiated in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) monocytes were supplemented with M-CSF (50 ng/ml), 2 mM glutamine, 10% decomplemented FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin for an additional 72 hours. cytokine levels were measured using multiplexing laser bead technology. the supernatant of these cultures was recovered after 20 hours of stimulation. statistical analyses were performed using the 2-tailed Student\u2019s t test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Y coordinated the collection of sera and tissue sample from SARS patients. all authors involved in correlative interpretation of the pathological and molecular data."}
