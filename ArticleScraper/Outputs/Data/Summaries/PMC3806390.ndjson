{"summary": "people can now objectively monitor their physical activity and sleep through mobile applications and devices. the basic sensors in mobile phones can support tracking and analysis of symptoms [1,2], and they can share the collected information with peers, their support network, and their health care providers. the last decade has also seen the arrival of \u201cinfodemiology\u201d tools, such as Google Flu [3,4], that pool online behavior traces to monitor illness trends. health care providers can provide expert advice and information. peers can offer \"strategies for coping with day-to-day personal health issues gained through trial and error of the lived experience\" a number of mobile applications and ubiquitous health monitoring tools are being studied to help connect patient data to clinicians. sharing physical activity levels, such as step counts, has helped motivate people to be more active through social support and social pressure. participants in the study\u2019s sharing condition were more likely to achieve their daily goals than participants without this feature. peer support can also be enhanced by focusing on connecting people from the same geographic area [21,22] or who share the same health provider [23,24]. peers can offer advice and narratives relevant to the specific health concern and that are more likely to fit into each other\u2019s lives. health care providers can provide expert advice and information, while peers can offer \"strategies for coping with day-to-day personal health issues gained through trial and error of the lived experience\" the online community Sermo restricts access to verified MDs and DOs in the united states and has over 125,000 members. companies such as numera have sprung up to facilitate the connection between consumer sensors and health providers\u2019 records systems. peers can offer important support to people who are working through health issues. peers can draw on their own experiences to offer narratives, coping strategies, and support. patients can share their personal trajectory with an illness, medication adherence, and experiences with different strategies, medications, and procedures. these accounts provide useful information that other patients can use to make decisions, but also provide people with a sense that they are not alone. patients and caregivers (Friends and Family) Technology can also support connections between people and the people in their existing support network. peers can offer a sense of \u201cgoing through it together\u201d or advice from their own experiences dealing with a health goal or medical condition. friends and family can offer different support. for health goals related to one\u2019s identity and impression management, the opportunity to communicate that identity to friends, family, and even former acquaintances can be an important motivator. the CSCW conference is in the process of being rebranded as a conference on computer supported cooperative work and social computing. in this paper, we examine one of these challenges in some depth\u2014the tension between sharing and privacy in meeting health needs. we review current work to improve how people can manage their privacy when sharing to support health. we then briefly highlight additional key challenges of the sociotechnical gap in in social media for health. we identify consistent themes across these challenges. more concern reduces their attitude toward sharing and thus their intent to share. privacy concerns can be caused by the lack of knowledge about whether the data collected are essential or needed [38], whether the collection process is perceived as fair [39], how the data will be used and disclosed [40], whether the information will be accessed by unauthorized individuals or organizations [38] or used according to its original intent [38], and whether measures exist to limit such possibilities [41] study participants report concerns about boring friends with mundane posts or appearing boastful about modest achievements. a typical Facebook network contains a diverse range of ties, and it may not be appropriate to share health-related data with one\u2019s entire network. authors argue that many people lack common sense about the extent of information appropriate to put online. privacy defaults and suggestions built into a system\u2019s interface can be powerful. despite preferences expressed in interviews or surveys, users often share health information according to the default setting. despite preferences expressed in interviews or surveys, users often share health information according to the default setting. goalpost is a self-monitoring and physical activity goal-setting application. only 25% of participants with access to this feature used it. privacy controls often go underutilized, experts say. repurposing aggregate data is fraught with potential privacy violations. de-identified data is keeping pace with efforts to make such datasets available anonymously. unresolved issues around sharing and privacy cause problems for users. many patients or caregivers need to share sensitive information only by revealing information about their health challenges and about their personal situation. many obstacles and challenges include risks associated with others misappropriating shared information, risks with violating social norms of sharing, and risks of not sharing with the right people to receive the desired type of support. privacy concerns can be caused by lack of knowledge about whether data is essential or needed [38], whether the collection process is perceived as fair [39], how the data will be used and disclosed [40], whether the information will be accessed by unauthorized individuals or organizations [38] or used according to its original intent [38], and whether measures exist to limit such possibilities [35], and the identity of the owner of the data [41]. norms and system design can influence the choices that individuals make when using social media for health and how these choices can TMI (too much information) is often not part of the frame in which system designers and builders approach systems for health information. authors argue that many people lack common sense about the extent of information that is appropriate to put online. one of the authors describes designing applications with features to share with one\u2019s social network. the privacy paradox is attributed to immediate gratification, bounded rationality, psychological distortion and the value of sharing [56]. despite preferences expressed in interviews or surveys, users often share health information according to the default setting [49,57,58]. industry experts report that privacy controls often go underutilized. sharing defaults that are not well matched to a space and type of information can lead people to inadvertent privacy violations. simple presence of affordances such as \u201cshare\u201d buttons in fitness can encourage people to do so even when such posts may be off-putting to their friends. repurposing aggregate data is fraught with potential privacy violations. de-identified data may be shared broadly with researchers and practitioners. if people share too much or too broadly, they risk being perceived as boring or an \"oversharer\" despite the unobtainability of perfection, researchers and practitioners should continue to seek better solutions. despite the unobtainability of perfection, researchers and practitioners should continue to seek better solutions. a barrier is the gap between individuals\u2019 mental models of how the feed works. misunderstanding can cause them to perceive a lack of comments or likes as being ignored by friends in a time of need rather than a result of their posts just not being seen. people are already using separate, less nuanced channels and spaces for different purposes. each space can have its own norms for information sharing, remembering, and dissemination. the development of these spaces also allows individuals to have \u201cfront stage\u201d and \u201cbackstage\u201d spaces. people facing major health events may need to share news and updates with their extended networks. some spillover will occur, even if such updates are not entirely consistent with normative content for such spaces. can we design systems that give feedback that helps people craft messages that are more appropriate for the selected channel? we must acknowledge that perfect privacy and sharing is not going to happen. we must acknowledge that perfect privacy and sharing is not going to happen. despite the unobtainability of perfection, researchers should continue seeking better solutions. systems built and released with one set of goals will have further consequences on their users and the organizations in which they are deployed. there is likely a need to better inform users\u2019 mental models of how social media systems for health function, and what they do and do not do. a barrier is the gap between individuals\u2019 mental models of how the Facebook feed works and how it actually works. first-order approximations are important tools for exploring the design space of what is possible and supporting a more detailed understanding of the sociotechnical gap. for example, people may want to be able to seamlessly manage all of their different connections for meeting their health goals, with nuanced permissions and disclosure for each piece of data and each relationship. social matching systems have received some attention in the HCI and CSCW communities. determining the most salient issues for applying such systems to health is likely to be a beneficial first-order approximation. fundamental lines of inquiry The final and \u201cmost daunting\u201d challenge posed by Ackerman is a set of fundamental inquiries that would further CSCW as a science of the artificial. work on many of these inquiries will advance designers\u2019, deployers\u2019, and users\u2019 abilities to manage privacy and sharing when using social media systems to support health needs. in the long term, one can hope for policy reform that better enables health innovation, rather than stifles it or leaves it to those willing to take risks. there is the risk that policy makers who do not understand the sociotechnical gap will craft policies intended to enable but that impose requirements that cannot technologically be met. a community designer might be tempted to try to verify that a participant is, indeed, someone who has had to face the medical situation at hand. such verification requirements would stifle contributions to social media spaces. others have argued for online activity to be connected to real-world identity, allowing better evaluation of its credibility. in the united states, patients with chronic illnesses are less likely to see health information online (51% vs 66%). this gap occurs not because they would benefit less from online resources or because they are unmotivated to see out this information. social media is to be a major tool for helping people manage health. health is a process that has to be cultivated if it is to thrive. if people are given information about themselves and their families, they will attempt to make decisions that are in the best interests of their families. health is a process that has to be cultivated if it is to thrive. designers and users of social media may define what it is to be healthy or well differently. large differences in definitions of health may make it hard to reach target populations. designers of health systems should be sensitive to this issue. critics argue that this may already be happening. researchers at Cornell have developed vera, a system for new mothers, and vera+, for a general audience, to support healthy decision-making through open-ended social awareness [87]. tailoring in social spaces has shown promise for increasing individuals\u2019 likelihood of attending to and complying with them [88]. privacy and sharing are the canonical challenge with using social media to support health. it is not up to today\u2019s challenges let alone tomorrow\u2019s, and regulatory uncertainties often push health providers to take the most conservative stance with respect to social media. the fit between social media and health care\u2019s regulator environment remains unknown and unclear. as of 2010, only 10% of US medical schools had policies or guidelines on social media use, leaving students to navigate its advantages, costs, and limits largely on their own. new spaces and channels do create new opportunities for incorrect or unverified information to spread, either intentionally or unintentionally. some communities have found it beneficial to close their doors to individuals without credentials. designers can build either formal or informal reputation systems. these systems can help surface participation from people whose past posts have proven particularly valuable to the community. researchers are also building first-order approximations that help us understand how spaces can support free participation. health is a process that has to be cultivated if it is to thrive. if people are given information about themselves and their families, they will attempt to make decisions that are in the best interests of their families. health is a process that has to be cultivated if it is to thrive. the current pervasive wellness movement was born in the 1970s. in the 1970s, wellness took on many aspects of a quasi-religious movement. in the 1970s, wellness took on many aspects of a quasi-religious movement. a hypothetical system, Fit4Life, monitors an individual\u2019s diet and physical activity. it gives feedback as well as shares progress (or lack thereof) with one\u2019s social network. the overall system and capabilities are not large leaps beyond products currently on the market. social media is a nuanced and challenging set of problems that we cannot engineer or build our way out of. a failure to acknowledge this gap will lead to failures of adoption, violations of norms, privacy, and users\u2019 expectations. a failure to account for it will lead to mismatches between goals, activities, and tools that systems suggest (or even coerce) and what would be best for individuals or groups. ackerman\u2019s description of the sociotechnical gap and of CSCW as a science of the artificial characterizes many of the challenges and predicts many of the failures that we face in designing and building social media systems to support health. ackerman\u2019s description of the gap
