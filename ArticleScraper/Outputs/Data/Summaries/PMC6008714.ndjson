{"summary": "a 1-y-old spayed female ferret was referred for a 2-wk history of inappetence, weight loss, and lethargy. radiographs showed a small, circular opacity in the middle to upper right abdominal quadrant. none of the other ferrets had any similar clinical signs. abdominal ultrasonography revealed a poorly demarcated, soft-tissue mass (diameter, 1 to 2 cm) with a moderate blood supply adjacent to the mesenteric lymph nodes. an ultrasound-guided needle aspirate was obtained, and smears were submitted for cytologic examination. an exploratory laparotomy was recommended to remove the mass and obtain a diagnosis. the ferret was hypotensive, constant-rate intravenous infusion of dopamine was initiated at 10 g/kg/min for the first hour and then reduced to 5 g/kg/min for the remainder of the procedure. the patient was in dorsal recumbency and a ventral midline laparotomy was performed by using a routine approach. the ferret continued to receive sucralfate (20 mg/kg PO every 12 h), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV daily, Merck, Kirkland, Quebec, Canada), tramadol (2 mg/kg PO every 12 h, Sandoz, Boucherville, Quebec, Canada) owners were instructed to continue treatment with tramadol, meloxicam, and sucralfate at the described dosages for 5 additional days. photomicrograph of peripancreatic adipose tissue stained with FIPV3-70 monoclonal antibody. ferret was started on prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO daily, Rafter 8 Products, Calgary, Alberta, Canada) after diagnosis, the ferret was eating and drinking well, was much more active and had gained weight. ferret systemic coronaviral disease (FSCD) has been diagnosed in ferrets since 2004. the disease has been likened to the dry form of feline infectious peritonitis. the exact mechanism underlying this mutation is unknown. these clinical signs are not specific for FSCD, with differential diagnoses including neoplasia, particularly lymphoma. abdominal ultrasonography, possibly combined with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, may be useful to identify the cause of an abdominal mass. the CBC analysis was unremarkable in the presented ferret. inflammatory leukograms or anemia were present in some cases but overall were inconsistently present. the diagnostic accuracy of measured plasma pancreatic enzymes is unknown in ferrets. FSCD typically is low and only a few months in most ferrets. prolonged survival times of 1 to 2 y have been reported for FSCD in nonpeer-reviewed sources."}
