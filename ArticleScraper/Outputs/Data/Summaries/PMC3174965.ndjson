{"summary": "a retrospective study was performed of all hospitalized patients at the peak of the pH1N1 season. a single respiratory virus was detected by a molecular assay targeting 18 viruses/subtypes (RVP, Luminex xTAG) no seasonal influenza A or B was detected. a high proportion of patients were treated with antibiotics and pH1N1 infection had higher mortality compared to other respiratory viruses. the etiologic agents include a diverse group of viruses, such as influenza A which is responsible for intermittent pandemics. the inability to reliably diagnose a viral respiratory infection such as influenza A often leads to coverage of possible bacterial etiologies. an accurate diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory viral infections is important to avoid overuse of antibacterial agents and direct appropriate antiviral therapy. the aim of this study was to assist clinicians in more effectively diagnosing and treating pH1N1.

Using fever alone did not raise the likelihood of having influenza versus another respiratory virus. age was a significant variable for those patients who had cancer (5 years OR 5.7, 95% CI 0.51\u201363.6; 5\u201318 years OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.023\u20133.0; 19 and older OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.041\u20130.31), neurological symptoms (5 years OR 2.67, 95% CI 0.98\u20137.3; 5\u201318 years OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.51\u20133.17; 19 and older OR 0.52 95% CI 0.23\u2013 diagnosis of influenza is important to provide timely and efficient treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors. rapid antigen tests were insensitive in the diagnosis of influenza during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic season [29], [6], [30], and these tests could not distinguish between different influenza A subtypes. compared to those with other respiratory viruses in our population, the difference was not enough to make a firm clinical diagnosis of influenza. however, fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms increased the likelihood of pH1N1 almost 10-fold in the pediatric population. a typical peak for RSV, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses followed the presence of pH1N1. a third limitation was that pH1N1 confirmatory testing was not performed for all non-subtypeable influenza A viruses. however, recent literature suggests that 100% of non-subtypeable influenza A H1 identified by the xTAG RVP was pH1N1 [39] the study was approved by the Rhode Island Hospital institutional review board. a waiver of informed consent was obtained before onset of the study. the study was approved by the institution review board. logistic regressions were used to examine relationships between variables and patients testing positive for pH1N1 compared with patients testing positive for a different respiratory virus. a series of multiple logistic regressions were constructed based on integrating the results from previous literature and our logistic regression results. the panel determined influenza A as seasonal human influenza A (H1N1), seasonal human influenza A (H3N2) or a non-subtypeable influenza A virus consistent with pH1N1. the panel determined influenza A as seasonal human influenza A (H1N1), seasonal human influenza A (H3N2) or a non-subtypeable influenza A virus consistent with pH1N1. the simple effects of the predictors were described in terms of their effects within age categories. a statistically significant interaction was detected."}
