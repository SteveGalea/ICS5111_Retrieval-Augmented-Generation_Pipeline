{"summary": "head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide, representing 90% of all head and neck cancers (1\u20133) in 2010 the 5-year survival rate was 50% (4,5) from 1975\u20132010, the morbidity and mortality of patients with HNSCC remained at a high level, with >650,000 novel cases diagnosed annually worldwide (6). direct link between aberrant expression of CPEBs and tumorigenesis has been previously observed in glioblastomas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (11). CPEB4 belongs to the CPEB family, and functions to directly mediate translation and polyadenylation (11) CPEB4 was abundantly expressed in glioblastomas and PDA, and influenced the acceleration of tumor proliferation, vascularization and invasion (21). the TMA was composed of 7 nasal carcinoma, 31 laryngeal carcinoma, 32 tongue carcinoma and 10 normal tongue tissues, from subjects ranging between 18 and 90 years of age. the samples were obtained from 18 women and 62 men. TMA slides were rinsed twice in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each time. slides were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine at room temperature for 5 min. a 4-point intensity scoring system was graded as follows. CES for tumors was defined as negative (score=0), weak positive (score=1\u20134), positive (score=5\u20138) and strong positive (score=9\u201312). Statistical evaluation was performed using SPSS (version 16.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) all gene expression data downloaded from GEO were inputted into Microsoft Excel. the samples were obtained from 18 women and 62 men. the study was approved by the appropriate Ethical Committees of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. TMA slides were rinsed twice in PBS at room temperature for 5 min each time. slides were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine at room temperature for 5 min. the cell nucleus was counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 3 min. Statistical evaluation was performed using SPSS (version 16.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) all gene expression data downloaded from GEO were inputted into Microsoft Excel. an unpaired Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two groups. P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. TMA slides were dried for 2 h at 60\u00b0C, dewaxed in pure xylene at room temperature three times for 15 min. slides were immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. TMA sections were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine at room temperature for 5 min to detect the antigen. the cell nucleus was counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin at room temperature for 3 min. slides were dehydrated with an ascending series of alcohols, prior to mounting. an unpaired Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two groups. results CPEB4 gene expression in HNSCC and normal tissues. expression level of CPEB4 in HNSCC compared with normal samples from uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (GSE 33205) expression level of CPEB4 in HNSCC compared with normal samples from tumor margin (GSE 59102) associations between CPEB4 gene expression and N-stage Statistical analyses of CPEB4 gene expression were made between different N-stages of HNSCC. no statistically significant associations were identified between CPEB4 gene expression and N-stages of HNSCC. CPEB4 protein expression was significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. CPEB4 protein expression in each T-stage was detected using immunohistochemical staining. CPEB4 protein expression in each T-stage was detected using immunohistochemical staining. different tumor grades in the TMA represent increasing deterioration of histological differentiation. CES scores were calculated for each tumor grade for statistical analysis. moderately differentiated tumors had a decreased CES score compared with that of the well differentiated tumors. the CPEB4 gene expression level was lower in early- and advanced-stage LSCC tumor tissues compared with the tumor margin (P0.0001) no significant difference between early- and advanced-stage LSCC tumor tissues was identified. expression level of CPEB4 in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. CPEB4 expression level was lower in poorly differentiated HNSCC tissues compared with well-differentiated HNSCC tissues. CPEB4 expression level in each N-stage of HNSCC (GSE 39366) CPEB4 expression level in each T-stage of HNSCC (GSE 39366) no statistically significant associations were identified between CPEB4 gene expression and N-stages of HNSCC. CPEB4 protein expression in the HNSCC TMA was significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. CPEB4 protein expression in each T-stage was detected using immunohistochemical staining. differences in CPEB4 protein expression between different tumor grades in the TMA represent increasing deterioration of histological differentiation. CES scores were calculated for each tumor grade for statistical analysis. CPEB4 protein expression was decreased with increasing tumor grade. differences in CPEB4 protein between different N-stages in TMA. CPEB4 was not significantly associated with the N-stage of HNSCC. this result was consistent with the conclusion from the GEO dataset. CPEB4 expression was significantly downregulated in HNSCC samples compared with normal corresponding tissue samples. CPEB4 expression level was lower in poorly differentiated HNSCC tissues compared with well-differentiated HNSCC tissues. CPEB4 expression level in each grade of HNSCC (GSE 39366) CPEB4 expression level in each grade of HNSCC (GSE 39366) CPEB4 expression level in each T-stage of HNSCC (GSE 39366) no statistically significant associations were identified between CPEB4 gene expression and N-stages of HNSCC. methylation levels of CPEB4 gene in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. CPEB4 protein expression in the HNSCC TMA was significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. CPEB4, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein-4; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. CES scores were calculated for each tumor grade for statistical analysis. no significant associations between CPEB4 and T-stage of HNSCC were identified. the outcome was comparable with that for the analysis from the GEO dataset. CPEB4 was not significantly associated with the N-stage of HNSCC. the results of the present study confirmed that CPEB4 expression was downregulated in the majority of cases of HNSCC compared with normal tissues. the results of the present study confirmed that CPEB4 protein expression was significantly decreased in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. CPEB4 may function as a tumor suppressor gene in HNSCC. CPEB4 expression was not significantly associated with T-stages or N-stages in HNSCC. however, the statistical analysis from the GSE39366 dataset revealed an outcome comparable with that from the GEO dataset. it was concluded that there was no association between CPEB4 and T/N-stages in HNSCC. proteins, metabolic enzymes, and genes involved in migration and metastasis. there are three suggested mechanisms responsible for CPEB4-mediated malignant formation in cancer. CPEB4 may be critically involved in regulating downstream signaling pathways relevant to proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. the downregulation of CPEB4 gene expression was induced by microRNA-1246 to facilitate migration and invasion of tumor cells in non-small cell lung carcinoma (36). it may be speculated that microRNA-mediated CPEB4 regulation frequently exists in tumor progression. further investigation is urgently required."}
