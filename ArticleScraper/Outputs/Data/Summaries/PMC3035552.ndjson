{"summary": "PBMC were cultured in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium, 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin at a concentration of 106 cells/mL. the response against uninfected antigenic preparations was always above background, reducing the sensitivity of the assay. ion inhibitor Brefeldin-A washed cells twice in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide. samples were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. cells incubated with only anti-CD28 and -CD49d were included in each experiment. interferon (IFN)- synthesis by T cells after in vitro stimulation with vaccinia antigens was analyzed in eight healthy donors selected as recently vaccinated, long-term vaccinated, and not vaccinated persons. a representative experiment is reported in panels B and E. the percentage of T cells specific for smallpox vaccinia antigens was 0.23% among CD3(+) T cells. the number of vaccinia-specific T cells detected by this assay was 1,725 per blood mL corresponding to a frequency of 1/667. virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes are detectable only after extensive in vitro culture and restimulation to generate antigen-specific lines or clones. this limitation is due to the long, but limited, lifespan of memory T cells and to their low frequency, usually below 1/50,000 (12). quantitatively increased a few weeks after viral rebound consequent to the interruption of antiviral therapy. this method may be useful in detecting immune response by monitoring the frequency of virus-specific T cells. rapid flow cytometric T-cell assay could be used to identify recently exposed persons."}
