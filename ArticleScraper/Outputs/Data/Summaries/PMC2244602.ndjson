{"summary": "the application of peptide based diagnostics and therapeutics mimicking part of protein antigen is experiencing renewed interest. we have investigated the integration of B-cell epitope prediction with the variability of antigen and the conservation of patterns for post-translational modification prediction to improve over state of the art in the field. we find that for about 50% of antigen the approach works substantially better than for the overall dataset of 57 proteins. essentially as a side effect our method optimizes for presumably best applicable peptides as they tend to be likely unmodified and as invariable as possible. continuous epitopes make up an undefined but presumably small part of the complete \"epitope space\" of an antigen. this even so when assuming distinct epitopes rather than a continuous surface, continuous epitopes make up an undefined but presumably small part of the complete \"epitope space\" of an antigen. a practically applicable continuous epitope could be any exposed, possibly evolutionarily highly variable loop with an amenable antigenicity and solvent-accessibility profile. a practically applicable continuous epitope could then be any exposed, possibly evolutionarily highly variable loop with an amenable antigenicity and solvent-accessibility profile. we see reason to focus on the prediction of conserved, functionally constrained epitopes. this work assesses how far correlation between antigenicity, variability, post-translational modifications and protectivity/functional relevance can be put to use in a predictive model without the availability of 3D data. the figure shows the first part of the overall workflow applied in this project. the figure shows the second part of the overall workflow applied in this project. antigenicity classification logistic regression models based on 505 amino acid propensity scales. the results are relativated later in this work when using only potentially relevant domains of a protein antigen. a new validation dataset was generated to evaluate the prediction of protective linear epitopes using a sum-score. IEDB resource was queried for pathogen proteins with linear antibody determinants. to limit predictions to candidate regions, domain accessibility filtering was applied. to do so, domain data regarding polyproteins, trans-membrane structures or signal-peptides were taken from UniProt [26] or predicted using the TMHMM v.2.0 [27] and SignalP 3.0 Servers [28] ROC values of individual proteins using any of the three sub-scores alone as well as the linear combination (sum score) the last row indicates the overall AROC when analyzing all unmasked amino-acids together. unknown function 42374894 0,62 0,58 0,64 0,66 toxin/translocation/binary-toxin P13423 0,59 0,62 0,22 0,56 unknown function 14162008 0,23 0,23 0,11 0,08 attachment/fusion P59594 0,57 0,45 0,59 0,52 transport P16567 0,47 0,51 0,20 0,31 unknown function 13622014 0,27 0,46 0,16 0,39 unknown function 15675130 0,64 0,96 0,73 0,92 unknown function 13622584 0,63 toxin/peptidase/binary-toxin P15917 0,51 0,22 0,65 0,21 attachment/fusion P33478 0,71 0,61 0,69 0,69 unknown function P19597 0,85 0,87 0,61 0,86 attachment/fusion P07946 0,71 0,46 0,31 0,53 attachment/fusion Q05320 0,43 0,54 0,18 0,38 attachment/RNA encapsidation. eight of the 57 proteins used for protectivity prediction are similar or identical to sequences used for training the PCA19 classifier (as identified using blastp) eight of the 57 proteins used for protectivity prediction are similar or identical to sequences used for training the PCA19 classifier. 65% of proteins show AROC values = 0.35 or > = 0.65. a \"Synthesis Score\" representing the number of peptides required for likely experimental success is a relevant readout. how many peptides can be synthesized depends on budget and resources. analysis of feature correlation in protective epitopes to assess relationship of antigenicity, variability and modifications Pearson correlation-coefficients were calculated. a subset of epitopes showed high correlation, however. preliminary experiments evaluating the potential power of the correlation coefficient as a new parameter for protectivity prediction indicated close to random performance. the previously described observation that for about 65% of proteins either substantially good or bad predictive power can be seen. however, weaker correlations than -0.5 and +0.5 can still positively influence AROC. balanced and stratified training and validation sets (MTS) were randomly sampled from CML to make independent validation possible. results can be seen in table 4 and figure 4. the best model comprises all three attributes as well as the sum-score as a fourth attribute.

'Qualitative Measurement' = 'Positive' (235 proteins remained) 'epitope source Species' = 'Homo Sapiens' (227 proteins remained) remove identical rows and obvious redundancies or identical sequences in different strains of the same organism. prediction of continuous epitopes should be measured by the number of synthesized peptides required to cover known epitopes. the synthesis score is defined as the number of peptides required to cover at least five epitopic amino-acids in the protectivity validation dataset. of 505 unique amino acid propensity scales taken from the AAINDEX database [33] forms a 20 505 descriptor matrix of rank 19. the resulting property matrix is of rank 19 as well, corresponding to 19 linearly independent vectors. the data itself can be requested from Blythe et.al. Capturing protein variability To numerically represent variability of a protein at a certain amino acid position an information-entropy measure has been applied. x = 0 f i l o g ( f i x ) if W i x > 0 where f(j) is the score at alignment column j, fx is the frequency of the most abundant letter x in column j, fi is the frequency of letter i in column j and Wix is the substitution weight between letters i and x. the ratio m of modified amino-acids was calculated. the value used for protectivity scoring is 1-m. the advantage of using motif predictions on aligned sequences is the possibility to derive the degree of conservation of the motif. regions not part of an epitope were randomized while maintaining the average amino-acid frequency of BciPep. each amino-acid functioned as the central amino acid of a 9-mer (peptide), inheriting its class (antigenic or non-antigenic) to the peptide which was then used for parameterization and validation. 'Qualitative Measurement' = 'Positive' (235 proteins remained) 6. Remove 'Epitope Source Species' = 'Homo Sapiens' (227 proteins remained) the WEKA package [45] was used where machine-learning functions were needed, in particular a C4.5 and a Random Forest implementation. the synthesis score is defined as the number of peptides required to cover at least five epitopic amino-acids. five has been selected as a minimum requirement for an epitope.
