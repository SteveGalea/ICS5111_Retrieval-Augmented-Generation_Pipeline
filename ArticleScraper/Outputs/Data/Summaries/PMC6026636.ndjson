{"summary": "dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been associated with a wide range of diseases in humans. infants born prematurely and in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are particularly vulnerable. microbes of the NICU resemble those found in the gut of premature infants. there is a growing demand to care for premature infants in a single-family, private room NICU rather than a traditional shared-space, open bay NICU. Detailed maternal, pregnancy and delivery data were collected. infants had stool collected twice a week and frozen at -80\u00b0C within 12 h. environmental swabs were collected from both NICUs in areas where the study subjects most often spent their hospitalization and in high use areas. each swab was wet with sterile saline and rolled over the sample site ten times. samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 2 min. supernatant was removed and placed in a new 2 mL Eppendorf tube. the PCR products were purified using 1.0 speed beads and eluted in 15 ul of nuclease. libraries were pooled based on concentrations as determined by picogreen. libraries were loaded onto a high sensitivity chip run on the Caliper LabChipGX. libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq v3 chemistry. the principal software pipeline has two separable comparators. the first consists of a pre-computation phase and a per-sample computation. the output is a reference microbial database, and its output is a whole genome phylogeny tree. lyses of the sequencing data included generation of heatmaps based on the relative abundance of each microorganism (%) in each sample using the NMF R software package. similarity index calculations were performed as described. swabs were frozen at -80\u00b0C within 12 h of collection. a health and disease survey and stool sample was collected every 3\u20136 months. the aim of the study was to identify microbial disruption indices prior to disease development. two control samples of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli included in the analysis. each sample underwent the following preparation prior to extraction. samples stored at -80\u00b0C were removed from storage 1 to 2 h before DNA extraction and thawed on ice. samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 2 min. supernatant was removed and put into a clean 1.5 mL tube. each sample was cleaned and concentrated using the NucleoSpin gDNA Clean-up XS kit. libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq v3 chemistry for 100 bp single end reads with the aim to generate 40 M reads per sample. curated databases provide extremely fine resolution in identification, discrimination of pathogens from \u2018near neighbors\u2019 and accurate measurement of relative abundances. the second per-sample, computational phase searches the hundreds of millions of short sequence reads against the fingerprint sets in minutes. the second comparator uses edit distance-scoring techniques to compare a target sample with a reference set. overall classification precision is maintained through aggregation statistics. similarity index calculations were performed as described (Tarkkanen et al., 2009) using the Pearson correlation and boxplots were computed using the ggplot2 R library. the old NICU received exclusive maternal or donor breast milk (after TPN use if needed) compared with the new NICU (11/14 infants in old NICU vs. 7/18 infants in new NICU, p = 0.04) old

rial microbiota Using the likelihood ratio test, comparison of the entire bacterial community at the genus level showed no difference between infants from the old and new NICU in 2 week and discharge stool samples (p = 1.00) there was no significant difference between 2 week and discharge stool samples from the old NICU but there was a significant difference between 2 week and discharge stool samples from the new NICU (p = 0.0003) icutes, Actinobacteria, Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus were examined in the environmental samples. no significant difference was observed between the two cohorts. more differentially abundant genes were seen in the new NICU compared with the old NICU. in those who received antibiotics, different differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes were identified compared with the cohort as a whole. virulence associated genes with more than a log two difference in prevalence in the new NICU compared with the old NICU samples. differentially abundant virulence related genes between the two cohorts were found in each sample type. no significant differences in 2 week stool, discharge stool and skin samples were noted between the two NICU cohorts. the environmental samples however revealed polyomaviruses were more frequently detected in samples from the old NICU compared with the new NICU. analysis of the specific classes of antibiotics used showed more 3rd generation cephalosporin use in the old NICU compared with the new NICU (4/14 infants in old NICU vs. 8/18 infants in new NICU, p = 0.03) no difference was detected between maternal antibiotic use in pregnancy between the two cohorts. 0 3 0.24 Nitrofurantoin 0 1 1.00 Nutrition Ever received TPN 12 12 0.41 Primarily receiving maternal or donor breast milk only

microbiome at the taxonomic level of genus in each sample type in the old and new NICU and the new NICU samples. specific taxa of interest were analyzed for skin samples. no significant difference was observed between the two cohorts. antimicrobial resistance genes were compared between sample types. in stool samples, both 2 week and discharge, and skin swabs, beta lactam resistance genes were notably more differentially abundant in the new NICU samples than the old NICU. in those who received antibiotics, different differentially abundant genes were identified compared with the old NICU in the 2 week stool sample only. no individual from either cohort developed clinically detectable infection caused by an antibiotic resistant organism during their NICU stay. antimicrobial resistance genes were more abundant in the new NICU, compared to the old NICU, in all sample types. virulence associated genes with over a log two fold change in prevalence in the new NICU compared with the old NICU samples. differentially abundant virulence associated genes were detected in all sample types between the two NICU cohorts. no significant differences in 2 week stool, discharge stool and skin samples were noted between the two NICU cohorts. a pilot study is the first to compare microbiome differences between infants in an open bay shared-space NICU (old NICU) and the transition to a new hospital building with a single-family room NICU environment. differentially abundant antibiotic resistance genes were observed in all sample types (stool, skin, and environment) between both cohorts, with more abundant antibiotic resistance genes detected in samples collected from the new NICU. antimicrobial resistance genes were found between the two cohorts. the resistome in this study may reflect the new NICU being located in a newly constructed building, previously unoccupied. differences in feeding and nutrition between the two cohorts may have contributed to the difference in antimicrobial resistance genes seen. more infants primarily received breast milk in the old NICU. but more differentially abundant antimicrobial genes were still seen in the new NICU. environmental samples in the new NICU were as diverse as those in the old NICU. differences in resistome and virulome between the two cohorts were detected in all sample types. NICU practice has moved away from empiric antibiotics for premature infants. the new NICU is the first study of its kind to give an overview of the potential environmental influences on the microbial community and its associated resistome and virulome. study was approved by the Inova Human Research Protection program. all subjects underwent informed consent to participate.
