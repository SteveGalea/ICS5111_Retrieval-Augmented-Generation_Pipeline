{"summary": "eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) predicts favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast. criteria included being symptomatic during the run-in period. criteria included having serum EDN (sEDN) level 53 ng/mL. guidelines clearly state ICSs are the preferred option for long-term control of asthma. however, other trials have demonstrated that there is considerable inter-individual variability in treatment response to ICSs versus LTRAs. there are no published studies comparing differential responses to the 2 types of anti-inflammatory therapies, namely ICSs and LTRAs, for preschool children with asthma. there are no published studies comparing differential responses to the 2 types of anti-inflammatory therapies, namely ICSs and LTRAs, for preschool children. study design This was a randomized, parallel, 3-group, open-label trial. participants entered a 2-week run-in period, with short-acting beta2-agonists as needed. participants were randomly selected to join 1 of the 2 groups. patients who met randomization criteria were randomized to receive budesonide or Montelukast for 12 weeks. sEDN, serum eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, house dust mite-immunoglobulin E; R, randomization. adenovirus (AdV) A-E, coronavirus (CoV) 229E/NL63/OC43, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, rhinovirus (RV) A-C, influenza virus (IFV) A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, bocavirus (BV) 1-4, metapneumovirus (MPV) and enterovirus. matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare changes in sEDN in all patients with sEDN 53 ng/mL and HDM sensitivity (BIS and MONT groups) sEDN was measured at 2 weeks, sEDN was measured at 0 weeks (termed \u201cPost\u201d) and sEDN was measured at 12 weeks (termed \u201cPost\u201d). measurements of changes in sEDN for all 3 groups were done using the matched-pairs signed rank test. each group was subgrouped according to presence or absence of any virus and change in sEDN with treatment from \u201cPre\u201d to \u201cPost\u201d was analyzed using the same statistical test. study design This was a randomized, parallel, 3-group, open-label trial. patients who met the enrollment criteria entered a 2-week run-in period. participants were randomly selected to join 1 of the 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension 0.5 mg once daily for 12 weeks. sEDN and HDM-IgE were reported to the study physician. patients who met randomization criteria were randomized to receive budesonide or Montelukast for 12 weeks. sEDN, serum eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, house dust mite-immunoglobulin E, randomization. detection At initial enrollment and when exhibiting asthma or upper respiratory infection symptoms at regular visits, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. total RNA from common respiratory viruses was extracted and identified using a multiplex PCR system. an ACD was defined as a day with no beta-agonist rescue use; use of oral corticosteroids for asthma; daytime symptoms; nighttime awakenings. second comparison used the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. changes in sEDN in patients with sEDN 53 ng/mL and HDM sensitivity (BIS and MONT groups) and in those patients whose sEDN was 53 ng/mL, were not sensitive to HDM or both (OBS group). each group was subgrouped according to presence or absence of any virus and change in sEDN with treatment from \u201cPre\u201d to \u201cPost\u201d was analyzed using the same statistical test. RESULTS Flow chart for screening and randomization into study groups (BIS and MONT) is in Fig. 2. /33 (35.29) 33/61 (35.1) Age (mon) 39.33 (20\u201363) 40.77 (16\u201369) 35.34 (9\u201369) Food allergy 8 (38.1) 7 (31.8) 13 (25.5) 28 (29.8) Atopic dermatitis 9 (42.9) 7 (31.8) 8 (15.7) 24 (25.5) Body weight (grams) 3,128 (2,505\u20133,827) 3,041 (2,386\u20134,172) 3,028 (1,658 a detected virus was significantly greater (P = 0.005) than that found in the other 2 groups (BIS [38.1%], OBS [37.3%]). a CD ACD increased significantly in each group (P 0.000) from the beginning of the study (0 week) to the beginning of the study (0 week) to the beginning of the study. both treatment options had a statistically similar effect on ACD over the 12-week treatment period. both treatment options had a statistically similar effect on ACD over the 12-week treatment period. sEDN over 12-week treatment period with montelukast (D) paired t-test. sEDN, serum eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, Pre, sEDN level taken at 2 weeks. sEDN used at 0 weeks to determine eligibility of study subject. there was a significant decrease (P 0.000) in rescue medication usage within each group (BIS and MONT) and in each subject in each group when analyzed over the study period (2 to 12 weeks) there were no significant differences found when comparing usage in the BIS group to that in the MONT group at each time point (2, 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) the proportion of the MONT group (77.3%) with a detected virus was significantly greater (P = 0.005) than that found in the other 2 groups. the proportion of the MONT group (77.3%) with a detected virus was significantly greater (P = 0.005) than that found in the other 2 groups. ACD ACD increased significantly in each group at each time point (P 0.000) from the beginning of the study (0 week) to the end of the study (12 weeks) changes in sEDN with treatment There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group. MONT group showed significant decrease (P = 0.023) in sEDN over 12-week treatment period with montelukast. four (46.8%) study subjects were positive for any virus tested. changes in sEDN (EDN) were compared between virus-positive and -negative subjects in the BIS and MONT groups. changes in sEDN (EDN) were compared between virus-positive and -negative subjects in the MONT and MONT groups. montelukast treatment significantly reduced sEDN levels. unexpectedly, BIS treatment did not. both treatments also resulted in significant decreases in medication usage. montelukast treatment significantly reduced elevated EDN levels in the MONT group, which has also been shown in other asthma studies12 and even in patients with post-RSV bronchiolitis recurrent wheeze. from our clinical experience montelukast is preferred over ICS by both physicians and patients in Korea and Japan. eosinophils develop principally in the bone marrow and migrate to inflammatory sites, such as the airways. budesonide, an ICS, acts locally, whereas montelukast acts systemically. study limitations included: the open-label design, which could have affected results through the placebo effect;. measurements for both secondary outcomes (i.e., sEDN level and rescue medication usage) were done only 2 times, once at the beginning of the study for baseline and a second time at the end of the study, so it may have been more beneficial to measure serially. a clearer phenotype of the asthma patient appears to contribute to improved asthma care. it has been suggested by many studies that EDN is a more accurate biomarker than eosinophil numbers or percentages."}
