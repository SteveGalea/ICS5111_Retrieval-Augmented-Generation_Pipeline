{"summary": "WHO certified Taiwan, along with the entire WPR, as polio-free in 2000 and Taiwan changed its immunization strategy from oral (OPV) to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in 2010. cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) causing acute flaccid paralysis have risen since 2000. ovirus in populations, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, and noroviruses are often found in environmental raw sewage [16\u201319]. these groups of viruses can cause a broad range of asymptomatic to severe gasterointestinal or respiratory infections [20], or even more acute conditions such as meningitis and paralysis [21], thus constituting a considerable public health problem. no poliovirus was detected in sewage collected islandwide. results showed a high incidence of MRV, which may cause human disease. specimens were kept at 4\u00b0C in transit and before inoculation into cell culture. concentrated specimens were inoculated into each cell culture tube, incubated at 35\u00b0C, and examined for cytopathic effects (CPE) daily. positive CPE specimens were stained by Pan-Enterovirus (PanEV) Blend antibody and respiratory virus screen antibody (LIGHT DIAGNOSTICSTM, Millipore) for enterovirus or respiratory virus identification. panEV-positive untypable specimens were examined by PCR sequencing. immunostaining of infected cells with monoclonal antibodies specific for echovirus 4, 6, 9, 11, and 30. negative results were determined by blind staining with panEV and respiratory virus screen antibody. 1 l of the first PCR product was added to a second PCR with primers AN89 and AN88. after 40 cycles of seminested amplification, the PCR product was separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. the positive product (350 to 400 bp) was purified using a gel/PCR DNA fragment extraction kit. the mixture was incubated at 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 52\u00b0C for 30s, and 68\u00b0C for 30s. the 416 bp PCR products separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis were purified using a gel/PCR DNA fragment extraction kit (Geneaid) phylogenetic analysis was done using the neighbor-joining method. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. nucleotide sequences of the MRV obtained from environmental sewage were deposited in the GenBank database under the following accession numbers: KR296769 to KR296785. permission from the wastewater treatment plants before conducting the study. 39.5 ml of 22% dextran, 287 ml of 29% PEG6000, and 35 ml of 5N NaCl were added to the supernatant and shaken for 1 hour. the entire lower layer and interphase were harvested and mixed with pellets. the upper water phase was collected and penicillin/streptomycin was added. 200 l of concentrated specimen was inoculated into cell lines immediately or frozen at -80\u00b0C for later use cDNA was synthesized in 10-l reaction mixture containing 5 l of RNA, 10 mM deoxynucleoside triposphate (dNTP), 5x reaction buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 M each of cDNA primer (primer AN32, AN33, AN34, and AN35), 40 U of RNasin, and 200 U of SuperScript III reverse transcript. cDNA synthesis reaction mixture contained 5 1 of total extracted RNA, 10 pmol of each of the cDNA primers rv5F and rv6R. cDNA synthesis reaction mixture contained 5 1 of total extracted RNA, 10 pmol of each of the cDNA primers rv5F and rv6R. Script III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) incubated at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 20\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 60 min, and 95\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR was performed using 5 1 of RT reaction mixture, 5 1 of 10 buffer for KOD+ (TOYOBO), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM of MgSO4, 10 pmol each of primers rv5F and rv6R a gCATCCATTgTAAATgAGTCTg L1 All types 1930\u20131953 2249\u20132273 R1S1-F b R1S1-R b gCTATTCgCCTATggA ATACATgATCgTCCACggAg S1 Type 1 1\u201318 1389\u20131408 R2S1-F c R2S1-R c gCTATTCgCCCCAgC phylogenetic analysis was done using the neighbor-joining method. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. the evolutionary distances were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method. CVB4 was the most prevalent (27 isolates, 29.3%), followed by CVB3 (20 isolates, 28.3%), CVB2 (20 isolates, 21.7%), and CVB5 (11 isolates, 12.0%) the proportions of echoviruses ranged between 1.1% to 3.3% of cases. a possible reason for the unexpected identification of MRV by PanEV RT-PCR may be due to the similarity between the primer and L1 gene of MRV. 94 isolates (35.1%) were identified as MRV by MRV L1 region PCR. positive isolates of different subtypes of coxsackievirus B (CVB) isolated from environmental surveillance in Taiwan from July 2012 to December 2013. phylogenetic analysis of mammalian orthoreoviruses from sewage specimens MRV are non-enveloped RNA viruses that contain 10 segmented double-stranded RNA genomes. previous studies have demonstrated a phylogenetic relationship between classical non-fusogenic MRV and the fusogenic a total of 300 sewage samples were collected from 10 representative wastewater treatment plants in Taiwan between July 2012 and December 2013. the specimens were processed according to the WHO guidelines for environmental surveillance of poliovirus circulation. CVB4 was the most prevalent (27 isolates, 29.3%), followed by CVB3 (20 isolates, 28.3%), CVB2 (20 isolates, 21.7%), and CVB5 (11 isolates, 12.0%) the proportions of echoviruses ranged between 1.1% to 3.3% of cases. a possible reason for the unexpected identification of MRV by PanEV RT-PCR may be due to the similarity between the primer and L1 gene of MRV. 94 isolates (35.1%) were identified as MRV by MRV L1 region PCR (Table 2). coxsackievirus B (CVB) isolated from environmental surveillance in Taiwan from July 2012 to December 2013. phylogenetic analysis of mammalian orthoreoviruses from sewage specimens MRV are non-enveloped RNA viruses that contain 10 segmented double-stranded RNA genomes. previous studies have demonstrated a phylogenetic relationship between classical non-fusogenic MRV and the fusogenic reoviruses such as the S1 gene of MRV (nucleotides 147 to 1253) was analyzed. the unrooted tree was generated by the MEGA6 program. coxsackievirus type B strains were isolated more often than echoviruses. these findings are similar to the results of some studies on sewage surveillance in other countries. MRV are non-enveloped viruses that contain 10 segmented RNA genomes. species D (Ad 8, 19, 37, 54) is thought to cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. species B (Ad 11, 21) has been linked to hemorrhagic cystitis. recent studies have reported a seropositive rate of more than 70% in 4-year-old children. a few novel MRV viruses were found in humans, such as, type 2 MRV (MRV2TOU05), which seems to be closely related to porcine and human strains first isolated from 2 children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy in France. another novel type 3 MRV was isolated from a child in the united states with meningitis. the etiologic agent remains unknown in many cases of encephalitis. MRV may be a potential risk factor with public health implications. this is the first study to report the prevalence of MRV in sewage in Taiwan."}
