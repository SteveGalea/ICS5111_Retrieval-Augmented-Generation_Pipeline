{"summary": "the order chiroptera (bats) is one of the most diverse and geographically wide-spread orders within the mammals constituting 20% of all mammalian species. the latter includes frugivorous/nectarivorous bats with species like Rousettus aegyptiacus (R. aegyptiacus), Pteropus alecto (P. alecto) and Eidolon helv bats develop immunoglobulins after infection and have lymphoid development similar to that in other mammals [8]\u2013[10]. information on the innate immune response of bats is particularly scarce. simian virus (SV) 40 large T antigen immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) generated in-house from 129/SvJ mice [19], African green monkey kidney cells (MA104) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (ATCC CRL-1586) organs from E. helvum (embryo kidney and lung), R. aegyptiacus (kidney), M. daubentonii (lung), Pipistrellus spec. (kidney), H. cf. caffer/ruber (embryo) and R. cf. landeri (kidney) were minced, trypsinized, and cultured in DMEM medium by the remaining 30 PCR cycles included 94\u00b0C/20 s, 66-56\u00b0C, delta 1\u00b0C/10 s, 72\u00b0C/60 s. the remaining 30 cycles included 94\u00b0C/20 s, 56\u00b0C/20 s, 72\u00b0C/60 s. after 1 h incubation the inoculum was removed and cells were washed with PBS (PAA) 2 MEM (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) was supplemented with 0.44% (w/v) NaHCO3 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 20% FCS (PAA) and 2% Penicillin/Streptomycin. after 2 days the overlay was discarded and cells were stained with a 0.2% crystal violet and 20% ethanol (Roth) a classical VSV bioassay was performed as described previously. supernatants of negative controls and cells stimulated with poly IC were also treated with -PL. EC50 values were defined as IFN concentrations which reduced the number of plaques to 50%. subsequently the values were multiplied by the dilution factors. the calculated amount of IFN was divided by the EC50 of each internal standard curve. cell culture All cells were cultivated in DMEM (PAA, C\u00f6lbe, Germany) with 4.5 g/L Glucose (PAA), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (PAA), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin 100 concentrate (Penicillin 10000 units/ml, Streptomycin 10 mg/mL) as prototype mammalian cells we applied simian virus (SV) 40 large T antigen immortalized mouse embryonic fibro llus spec. (kidney), H. cf. caffer/ruber (embryo) and R. cf. landeri (kidney) were minced, trypsinized, and cultured in DMEM medium by titration and seeding at 1100 dilution. immortalization was done by lentiviral transduction of the large T antigen of SV40. real-time RT-PCR was processed using the LightCycler\u00ae 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) the dilution end-point was defined as one PCR unit. dilution end-point was defined as one PCR unit for each experimental sample. IFN induction by infection and transfection of rift valley fever virus clone 13 (RVFV 13) infection was done as described above by infecting cells at an MOI of 1. after 24 h, all supernatants were harvested and virus was inactivated by -propiolactone (-PL, Ferak Berlin, Germany) cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 4105 cells per ml. after 24 h the inactivated supernatants or a pan-species IFN- (pan-IFN, a universal recombinant type I human IFN- A/D hybrid, PBL Biomedical Laboratories/Axxora, L\u00f6rrach, Germany) were added to the respective cells. Western blotting was performed by using mouse-anti-Mx1/2/3 (C-1, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany), goat-anti-IFIT/ISG56 (L-16, Santa Cruz), mouse-anti-actin (Sigma) immunoglobulins at dilutions 11000. only for R. aegyptiacus and E. helvum. one pregnant female was euthanized by injection of Ketamine/Xylazine. primary cells could be passaged only twice, while transduced cells could be passaged continuously. clonal cell lines were prepared by end point dilution plating. cell cultures were immortalized by lentiviral transduction of a simian virus 40 large T antigen. three clonal cell lines (EidNi/41.1, 41.2 and 41.3) were prepared from a mixed culture (EidNi/41) by end point dilution plating. bars indicate 20 m. IFN- mRNA transcription was induced by either RVFV 13 infection (MOI 1) or poly IC transfection (5 g per 6-well) mRNA was quantified by species-specific real-time RT-PCR assays. the fold induction was calculated with the 2Ct method. real-time RT-PCR primers were placed in sites conserved among bats. EidNi/41.3 cells were readily infected by RVFV 13. luciferase expression representing virus replication levels was comparable with that in several reference cell cultures including MEF, MA104 and Vero E6 cells. Countable plaques were visible after 2 days post infection (dpi) all cell lines were incubated with gradients of equivalent concentrations of recombinant pan-species IFN and subjected to VSV plaque reduction assays. EC50 values (amount of pan-species IFN to achieve a 50% VSV plaque reduction) were calculated for all cell lines. the highest equivalent amount of bioactive secreted IFN upon RVFV 13 virus and poly IC transfection was measured in EidNi/41.3 cells, followed by MEF and MA104. the observed difference in IFN mRNA induction between RVFV 13 virus and poly IC transfection was not seen favoring the idea of differential mRNA regulation in E. helvum cells upon poly IC treatment. Virus growth was measured by an ONNV-specific real-time RT-PCR. titration of virus in supernatants 24 hpi. increase of genome equivalents per ml was 1000-fold after 24 hpi. increased viral titers corresponded to lower amounts of secreted IFN protein. mRNA induction was measured by species-specific real-time RT-PCR at time points 0, 8 and 24 hpi. expression of ISGs was not affected by IFN protein downregulation. expression of ISGs was not affected by IFN protein downregulation. mxA mRNA is upregulated in bat cell cultures upon ONNV infection. mRNA abundance of two different ISGs (MxA and ISG56) and two reference genes (actin- and TBP) was analyzed and compared to the amounts of secreted IFN at 0 and 24 hpi. mxA and ISG56 mRNA to secreted IFN showed an approximately 10-fold increase 24 hpi. this was also in different clonal and mixed E. helvum kidney cells. RVFV 13 infection caused higher or similar (MA104 cells) expression of MxA, p56 and actin. this effect was generally more pronounced for MxA than for p56. however, ONNV infection resulted in a reduced expression of MxA and p56 proteins. to exclude cell clone specific effects additional EidNi and RoNi bat cell cultures were included (EidNi/41.2; EidNi/41 and RoNi/7) as well as a human A549 cell line. it had to be excluded that the observed reduction of IFN and ISG protein levels might be due to attenuation of virus replication. cells were inoculated with ONNV and supernatants were analyzed at 0, 8 and 24 hpi by real-time RT-PCR. supernatants were titrated after 24 hpi confirming the PCR results. the infection at low MOI resulted in higher PFU to genome equivalent ratio. only for R. aegyptiacus and Tadarida brasiliensis cell cultures are commercially available. one pregnant female was euthanized by injection of Ketamine/Xylazine. yptiacus bat was prepared to investigate putative differences. all bat cell cultures were genotyped by amplifying mitochondrial cytochrome b fragments [22] followed by a BLAST analysis. EidNi and RoNi cells showed 100% identity with cytochrome b. cells were infected at different ten-fold diluted MOIs (7.5 until 0.000075) and lysed 24 hpi with Renilla lysis buffer (Promega) high replication was found in vero cells followed by EidNi/41.3, MEF, MA104 (between10 to 100-fold less than vero cells) PCR from cultures of a phylogenetically representative range of bats differing in main diet and hunting strategies including the insectivorous M. daubentonii, Pipistrellus spec. (Vespertilionidae), H. cf. caffer/ruber (Hipposideridae), and the frugivorous/nectarivorous R. aegyptiacus and E. helvum were EidNi/41.3 cells were able to produce and secrete effective doses of type I IFN. to achieve this, a VSV-based IFN bioassay was established. all cell lines were incubated with gradients of equivalent concentrations of pan-species IFN. the highest equivalent amount of bioactive secreted IFN upon RVFV 13 virus was measured in EidNi/41.3 cells, followed by MEF and MA104. each cell line was incubated for 24 h with the help of the VSV bioassay secreted IFN was measured. Alphaviruses have been detected previously in bats [44], [45] and exhibit strong induction of IFN [46]. to establish a synchronized infection of ONNV, a high MOI = 2.5 was used. Virus growth was measured by an ONNV-specific real-time RT-PCR. the amount of IFN mRNA (y-axis; for absolute values refer to Figure S1) was directly compared to viral RNA (x-axis) from supernatant at equivalent time points in each cell line. increased viral titers corresponded to lower amounts of secreted IFN protein. EidNi/41.2 (subclone), EidNi/41 (mixed cell culture), RoNi/7 (mixed cell culture from R. aegyptiacus kidneys) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549) showed the same phenotype. a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549) showed an even higher decrease of IFN secretion than MA104 and MEF. control of ONNV replication seemed to be relatively more efficient in both applied bat cells. one reason might be differences in the capability of bat cells to react on IFN signaling. aegyptiacus kidney (RoNi/7) cells showed an apparently superior control of ONNV replication in both applied bat cells. the effect was generally more pronounced for MxA than for p56, suggesting that IFN-dependent signaling rather than JAK/STAT-independent induction were affected. goat-anti-IFIT1/ISG56 (p56) and mouse-anti-actin immunoglobulins were applied at dilutions 11000 followed by a peroxidase labeled goat-anti-mouse or rabbit-anti-goat secondary antibody (120000). in all cell lines infection with ONNV did not induce the expression of MxA and p56 and was less or comparable to untreated cells. MA104 primate cells yielded a 10 to 100-fold higher specific infectivity compared to the high MOI experiment. a growth kinetic at low MOI was performed (MOI 0.0025) in order to analyze if insufficient viral replication led to a delayed or ablated IFN production in cells. characterized, highly interferon-competent cell lines will enable comparative research on zoonotic, bat-borne viruses. cells were infected with ONNV (MOI 2.5) and IFN- mRNA induction was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. each cell line was incubated for 24 h with IFN containing supernatants."}
