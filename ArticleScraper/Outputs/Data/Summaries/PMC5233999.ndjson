{"summary": "bare GO has a thin and flat appearance with a height of approximately 1 nm on mica, which may correspond to the monolayer state of GO. bare GO has a thin and flat appearance with a height of approximately 1 nm on mica, which may correspond to the monolayer state of GO. the height of antibody-conjugated GO increased dramatically, with a typical thickness of 10 nm. the bright peaks are likely due to the accumulation of antibodies on the GO surface. all of the surface morphology results implied that the antibody was successfully retained on the GO surface. analyte IgG concentration and fluorescence intensity of free IgG-FITCs. fluorescence intensity decreased when the IgG-FITCs bound to graphene surfaces. bare GO showed a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 10 g mL1 of GO. fluorescence intensity change of IgG-FITC will be between 0 to 30% with respect to initial fluorescence with no analyte. all of the GO concentrations varied; 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 200, and 400 g mL1. antibody-conjugated GO always had a concentration of 100 g mL1. in the following experiment, the \u201cblank\u201d sample consisted of antibodies-conjugated GO and IgG-FITC, without analyte IgG. the linear relationship between FL intensity change (I) and low IgG concentrations of 0, 0.4, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, and 3.6 g mL1 (experiments were performed 4 times) the experiment was repeated 4 times, and the average of the results was plotted in Fig. 4(a) the analyte IgG proteins could control the fluorescence quenching and determine the fluorescence intensity. we performed the experiment under the same conditions 4 times and the data points in Fig. 4(b) fit well with the linear function. the results in Fig. 5 clearly show that the 3 possible interfering biomolecules gave no detectable signal change. only the analyte IgG protein showed a significant positive signal as the fluorescence intensity of the other proteins was close to the blank sample. the LOD was 4.67 pmol mL1, which still leaves room for further improvement. the sensing mechanism in this study could become a viable immunosensor platform for the detection of proteins. it will broaden the spectrum of graphene oxide applications in analytical biochemistry and clinical diagnosis. human IgG antibody-conjugated GO was synthesized by a classic two-step method. a MES buffer solution containing 4 mg mL1 of EDC and 6 mg mL1 of NHS was added into the GO-dispersed MES solution. the GO was redispersed in PBS to react with 50 g of rabbit anti-human IgG. human IgG-FITC standard was added to each sample to reach a concentration of 1 g mL1. when the reaction ended, the fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured. methods for determining the LOD and selectivity of the assay were the same as the above processes. Rabbit anti-human IgG antibody-conjugated Graphene Oxide Antibody-conjugated GO was synthesized by a classic two-step EDC-NHS (1-Ethyl-3 -(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide) method21,22,23. a MES buffer solution was added into the GO-dispersed MES solution. human IgG-FITC standard was added to each sample to reach a concentration of 1 g mL1. when the reaction ended, the fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured."}
