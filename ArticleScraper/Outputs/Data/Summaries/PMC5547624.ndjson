{"summary": "the most common clinical presentation was bronchiolitis (n = 105, 88%) and the median age was 78 d. RSV was the most common pathogen, identified in 67 (56%) of the cases, followed by HRV in 31 (26%) of the cases. the final set of variants included 2,793 stop-gained single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 297 splice-site SNVs, and 951 frame-shift indels. eight study participants carried putative LoF variants in IFIH1. rs35337543 is a stop-gained SNV in exon 10 that leads to the loss of 399 amino acids from the C-terminal end of IFIH1 (IFIH1-CTD) rs35744605 is a stop-gained SNV in exon 10 that leads to the loss of 399 amino acids from the C-terminal end of IFIH1 (IFIH1-CTD) PRI_061 het M 41 White RSV NI Bronchiolitis het in mother PRI-063 het M 22 White RSV NI Bronchiolitis NA rs35337543 2:163136505 C/G p.Leu509_Glu547del 1847 (8), 0.006 PRI-065 het M 38 White RSV NI Bronchiolitis NA PRI-116 het M 479 rs35337543 leads to skipping of exon 8. rs35732034, rs35744605 and rs35337543 variants are indicated in yellow. mutant IFIH1 isoforms showed a typical dsRNA-dependent increase in enzymatic activity. all mutant isoforms decreased IFIH1-wt ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner, an interference that was specific to mutant IFIH1 isoforms. the three mutant isoforms were less stable than IFIH1-wt. they had a negative impact on the stability of the wild-type isoform. enzymatic activity and protein stability suggest a dominant negative role for heterozygous LoF variants in IFIH1. IFIH1-wt can hydrolyze ATP in the presence of polyI:C. IFIH1-14, IFIH1-8, and IFIH1-CTD lack ATPase activity. ATPase activity of IFIH1-wt is reduced upon coincubation with the alternate isoforms in a dose-dependent manner. six of the patients harboring IFIH1 LoF alleles were infected with RSV and two with HRV. we used Huh7.5 cells, which lack endogenous expression of IFIH1 and express a mutated, inactive form of RIG-I. they were transduced with an IFIH1-wt-expressing lentiviral vector. mCherry expressing recombinant RSV (rRSV-Cherry) in Huh7.5 and Huh7.5-LV-IFIH1 transduced cells at 24, 48, and 72 hpi show that RSV replicates more efficiently in the absence of IFIH1. the most common pathogen was bronchiolitis (n = 105, 88%) and the median age was 78 d. RSV was the most common pathogen, identified in 67 (56%) of the cases, followed by HRV in 31 (26%) of the cases.

IFIH1-wt can hydrolyze ATP in the presence of polyI:C. ATPase activity of IFIH1-wt is reduced upon coincubation with alternate isoforms in a dose-dependent manner. IFIH1-wt, IFIH1-14, IFIH1-8, or IFIH1-CTD are indicated using a red arrow (2-g plasmid expressing wt protein, 2 g of each mutant plasmid, n = 1). data are represented as mean SD; polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. we also measured RSV replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, ifih1(+/+) and in IFIH1-knockout MEFs, ifih1(/) and obtained similar results. together, these results affirm the central role of IFIH1 in innate immune recognition of RSV and HRV. cellular proteins labeled with 35S at 24 hpi with both HRV-B14 and HRV-A16 showing a much stronger shutoff of cellular protein synthesis in Huh7.5 cells. ifih1 knockout MEFs and ifih1 knockout MEFs transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing IFIH1 replicate more efficiently in the absence of IFIH1. IFIH1 recognizes viral RNA via interaction of its CTD and helicase domains with long dsRNA molecules. this leads to polymerization of IFIH1 molecules into a filament and assembly of IFIH1 caspase activation recruitment domains (CARDs) this in turn initiates a signaling cascade that results in type 1 IFN production and activation of antiviral genes. the cumulative frequency of all putative LoF alleles is 1.89% in the same database, which is significantly less than the 3.75% cumulative frequency observed in our study population. however, the presence of alleles of potentially devastating consequences at such frequency is intriguing, as they are expected to be removed by purifying selection. study demonstrates the power of using an unbiased, exome sequencing approach to variant discovery in prospective cohorts of extreme infectious disease phenotypes. the results underscore the pivotal role of innate immune recognition and activation in the intricate balance between host defense, inflammation, and autoimmunity. study participants obtained a nasopharyngeal aspirate or endotracheal tube aspirate, 1 mL EDTA blood in vacutainer tubes, and 2.5 mL blood in PAXgene blood RNA tubes. samples were immediately frozen at 70 \u00b0C until shipment, and then analyzed in batch. candidate variants tested in vivo expression of the affected protein (SI Appendix)"}
