{"summary": "the prevalence and effects of many diseases in resource-constrained countries are probably less well-known but may be of even more importance. malaria, typhus, cholera, schistosomiasis and sleeping sickness are endemic in many parts of the world. the fall of empires has been attributed directly or indirectly to epidemic diseases. the fall of empires has been attributed directly or indirectly to epidemic diseases. in the second century AD, the so-called Antonine plagues invaded the Roman Empire, causing drastic population reductions. between 1519 and 1530 the native population of Mexico was reduced to one tenth of their previous levels by these diseases. the black Death (bubonic plague) spread from Asia throughout Europe in several waves during the fourteenth century. the disease recurred regularly in various parts of Europe for more than 300 years, notably as the Great Plague of London (1665-1666) the appearance of AIDS about 1981, apparently in the population of men having sex with men in San Francisco, was such an event. it took two years for scientists to identify a virus, which became known as HIV, linked to AIDS. in 2007 there were more than two million deaths from AIDS worldwide and more than 33, 000 people living with AIDS. the relation between problems and models in science may be described by the \"flow chart\" in Figure 1. the normal process of scientific progress is to observe a phenomenon, hypothesize an explanation and then devise an experiment to test the hypothesis. a mathematical problem is a model of the epidemic. a mathematical model assumed mass-action incidence to describe the acquisition of infection followed by a period of infectivity and then recovery with immunity against reinfection. this mathematical solution leads to the prediction that if the basic reproduction number is less than one, the number of infectives will tend to zero. this prediction matches observations but also gives a criterion for whether a disease outbreak will develop into an epidemic or die out. there is always a trade-off between simple models, which omit most details and are designed only to highlight general qualitative behavior. more detailed models contain more parameters and therefore it may be more difficult to fit parameters to the model. a disease model should have a level of complexity appropriate to the amount of known information and the results desired. the first mathematical model in epidemiology was the work of Daniel Bernoulli [4] on the effect of variolation against smallpox in increasing life expectancy. the foundations of mathematical epidemiology were laid in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by public-health physicians and biological scientists. the threshold principle is described quantitatively by the idea that the average number of secondary infections caused by an average infective is known as the basic reproduction number or basic reproductive ratio. if the basic reproduction number is less than one, then the infection dies out; if it exceeds one, then the infection persists. many extensions of the basic models were made up to the time of its publication in 1957. some were made to give more realistic descriptions of microparasitic diseases by adding compartments. some refinements were made to give more realistic descriptions of microparasitic diseases. the basic reproduction number marks a threshold between disappearance of the infection and outbreak of an epidemic. if the basic reproduction number is less than one, there is an endemic equilibrium and the disease may remain in the population. some of the Kermack-McKendrick models [3,9,10] included proportional birth and death rates. heterogeneity is heterogeneity of behaviour and the possibility that different subsets of a population may mix with different frequencies. this idea has been especially important in the study of sexually transmitted diseases [43-48] models describing spatial spread and including age of infection are analyzed in [68,80,81]. a second form of spatial heterogeneity is related to travel. a second form of spatial heterogeneity is related to travel. studies of realistic distributions may be found in [103-106]. the qualitative analysis of such models leads to questions of the location of roots of a transcendental equation. the possibility of unstable equilibria and sustained oscillations for some parameter sets in epidemic models. the origins of the study of mathematical epidemiology come from outside mathematics. mathematicians have not always been responsive to the questions that concern epidemiologists. a full, up-to-date history has yet to be written. measles is a childhood disease which is easily controlled by vaccination. but in many resource-constrained countries, few children are vaccianted against measles and there are a million deaths from smallpox worldwide. isolation was more effective and much less costly, partly because fewer than 5% of people identified by contact tracing developed disease. the lessons learned from SARS are being applied to planning for a possible influenza pandemic. the study of HIV on a cell level is well under way, but there is much more to be done. a strong link between mathematics and epidemiology would lead to great progress in epidemiological modelling. authors declare that they have no competing interests. the full contents of the supplement are available online at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9\"issue=S1."}
