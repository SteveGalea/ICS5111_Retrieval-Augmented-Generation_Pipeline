{"summary": "lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in industrialized countries. radiotherapy and chemotherapy play significant and crucial roles in clinical anti-lung cancer treatment to achieve prolonged patient survival. a high failure rate and low median survival rate are observed in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy with recurrent, intractable lung cancer [5]. a well-designed study by Eramo and colleagues showed that lung cancer contains a population of CD133+ CSCs able to self-renew and generate an unlimited progeny of non-tumorigenic cells. the gene regulation mechanisms in maintaining the self-renewal and drug-resistant properties in putative cancer stem-like cells of lung tumors are still unclear. LC-CD133+ cells possessed both the characteristics of stem-like cells and malignant tumors. the expression of Oct-4 plays a crucial role in maintaining cancer stem-like and chemoradioresistant properties in lung cancer-derived cells.

PCR reactions were prepared in duplicate and heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds. cells were plated onto poly-L-ornithine-coated glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature. cells were then washed twice (10 minutes each) with 1 PBS. fluorescence images were visualized with a mixture of biotinylated rabbit antimouse IgG and Fluorsave (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) cells were further probed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-tagged secondary antibodies. the absorbance was measured at 560 nm (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) Chemotherapeutic agents Cisplatin, etoposide (VP16), and paclitaxel were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were dissolved in DMSO at 100 mM of stock solution. pLVRNAi vector and pCDH-MCS1-EF1-copGFP vector were purchased from biosettia. the method of cloning the double-stranded shRNA sequence is described in the manufacturer's protocol. the cDNA was synthesized and cloned into pLVRNAi. the tumor size was measured with calipers and the tumor volume was calculated according to the formula (LengthWidth2)/2. the integrated optical density of green fluorescence intensity was captured and then analysed by Image Pro-plus software. the independent Student's t-test or ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. 104 LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133+ did not induce tumor formation. 3,000 LC-CD133+ from lung cancer tissues of ten patients and five LC cell lines in xenotransplanted mice can all generate visible tumors 4 weeks after injection. isolated LC-CD133+ were almost ABCG2-positive cells. this result demonstrated that isolated LC-CD133+ were almost ABCG2-positive cells. LC-CD133+ derived from NSCLC Patients No.1 (PLC) and No. 2 (LLC) showed higher invasion activity. a significant increase in the multiple nodules of tumor formation on lung surface was noted in the LC-CD133+-injected group. the prominent neovascularization and thrombus formation were detected in the pulmonary parenchyma of LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice. in vivo tumorigenicity of LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133 in tail vein-injected mice was analyzed by macroscopic and histological examination. xenotransplanted tumorigenicity analysis examined tumor-restoration and proliferative ability of 104 LC-CD133+, 105 LC-CD133 and 5105 total tumor cells. IR dose from 0 to 10 Gy to treat both LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133. survival rate and number of LC-CD133+ were significantly higher than those of LC-CD133 (p0.01; Fig. 4B) ionizing radiation dose from 0 to 10 Gy was used to treat LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133. the combined treatment effect of radiochemotherapy in LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133 were further evaluated. the treatment of scramble control siRNA did not influence the SB formation capability in LC-CD133+. both the CD133 and Oct-4 expressions in LC-CD133+ were significantly blocked after 7 days of Oct-4 siRNA treatment. apoptotic activities of annexin V and caspase 3 were quickly and effectively induced in LC-CD133+ treated by Oct-4 siRNA after 72 hours. chemoradiotherapy for the LC-CD133+ group can be significantly improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA compared with non-treated LC-CD133+. chemoradiosensitivity and apoptotic activity in knockdown Oct-4 expression of LC-CD133+. migratory invasion ability and colony formation of LC-CD133+ treated by Oct-4 siRNA significantly decreased compared with non-Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+. in vivo, we injected 104 LC-CD133+-GFP cells into the subcutaneous sites of nude mice with different treatment protocols. the tumor volumes were significantly decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ when exposed to IR alone, cisplatin alone, or IR combined with cisplatin. Oct-4-IHC levels were significantly decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ when exposed to IR alone, cisplatin alone, or IR combined with cisplatin. this in vivo study also confirmed that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy can be improved by the treatment of the LC-CD133+ group. the expression levels of Oct-4 in the lung lesions of LC-CD133+- and LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice with the different treatment protocol were studied by immunohistochemistry. the black arrows indicate the positive signals for Oct-4 expression in the tumors detected by IHC. each group tested six mice (n = 6). 104 LC-CD133+ did not induce tumor formation but 3,000 LC-CD133+ from the lung cancer tissues of ten patients and five LC cell lines in xenotransplanted mice can all generate visible tumors 4 weeks after injection. the results showed that 104 LC-CD133+ did not induce tumor formation. the majority of isolated LC-CD133+ were stained with higher expression levels of CD133, CD117 (c-Kit) and ABCG2 compared with LC-CD133. this result demonstrated that isolated LC-CD133+ were almost ABCG2-positive cells. 104 cells were injected into the tail veins of SCID mice. a significant increase in the multiple nodules of tumor formation on lung surface was noted in the LC-CD133+-injected group. neovascularization and thrombus formation were detected in pulmonary parenchyma of LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice. LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133+ present self-renewing and repopulation capabilities in vivo and in vivo. in vivo tumorigenicity of LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133 in tail vein-injected mice was analyzed. cisplatin (10 M) alone, VP-16 (10 M) alone, or combined cisplatin and VP-16 on IR-treated LC-CD133+. survival rate in IR-treated LC-CD133+ was not significantly decreased by the IR treatment combined with cisplatin, with or without VP-16. an ionizing radiation dose from 0 to 10 Gy was used to treat LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133. the combined treatment effect of radiochemotherapy in LC-CD133+ was further evaluated. LC-CD133+ could not maintain floating spheres but differentiated into attached epithelial-like cells. treatment of scramble control siRNA did not influence SB formation capability in LC-CD133+. both the CD133 and Oct-4 expressions in LC-CD133+ were significantly blocked after 7 days of Oct-4 siRNA treatment. apoptotic activities of annexin V and caspase 3 were quickly and effectively induced in LC-CD133+ treated by Oct-4 siRNA after 72 hours. western blot data further demonstrated that the amounts of activated (cleaved) form of PARP were consistently elevated in LC-CD133+ treated by Oct-4 siRNA with IR alone or combined with chemotherapy. knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133+ can effectively enhance chemoradiosensitivities and apoptotic activities in response to IR and chemotherapy. LC-CD133+ could be a key factor enables LC-CD133+ to resist radiochemotherapeutic stress. in vivo, we injected 104 LC-CD133+-GFP cells into the subcutaneous sites of nude mice with different treatment protocols. the tumor volumes were significantly decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ when exposed to IR alone, cisplatin alone or IR combined with cisplatin. Oct-4-IHC levels were significantly decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ when exposed to IR alone, cisplatin alone, or IR combined with cisplatin. this in vivo study also confirmed that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy can be improved by the treatment of the LC-CD133+ group. the expression levels of Oct-4 in the lung lesions of LC-CD133+- and LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice with the different treatment protocol were evaluated by histological review. the black arrows indicate the positive signals for Oct-4 expression in the tumors detected by IHC. each group tested six mice (n = 6) LC-CD133+ showed strong proliferative and invasive capabilities in vitro and in vivo. LC-CD133+ also showed significant resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. LC-CD133+ also showed significant resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. LC-CD133+ were significantly resistant to cisplatin, VP16 (eptoposide), doxorubicin, and paclitaxel than LC-CD133. IR treatment combined with cisplatin and VP-16 failed to cause cell death in treated LC-CD133+. knockdown of Oct-4 expression can significantly improve the anti-cancer effect in single- or combination-treated LC-CD133+ in vitro and in vivo. new studies have revealed that the human ABCG2 transporter is a P-glycoprotein that causes multidrug resistance (MDR) with mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and topoisomerase I inhibitors of irinotecan, topotecan, and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin. a significant down-regulating of ABCG2 expression and an increase in the chemosensitivity of LC-CD133+ were the resistance of LC-CD133+ to in vitro and in vivo chemoradiotherapy is partly due to preferential activation of Oct-4 gene expression. these data support that the up-regulated expressions of the Oct-4, self-renewing gene of embryonic stem cells play an important role in the tumorigenicity of lung cancer patients."}
