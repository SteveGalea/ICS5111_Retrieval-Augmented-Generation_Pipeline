{"summary": "several species of bats harbor highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses. lyssaviruses and henipaviruses are thought to be a reservoir for severe respiratory syndrome coronaviruses and filoviruses (1, 2). Nipah virus is a member of the genus Henipavirus. the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses has classified more than 100 species within the order Herpesvirales. a typical herpesvirus is composed of an envelope (diameter, 120 to 260 nm), which surrounds an icosahedral cage called a capsid. the subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae, and Gammaherpesvirinae are classified on the herpesviruses and gammaherpesviruses in the fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (27); Pteropus giganteus (28); and the insectivorous bats Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis myotis, Myotis nattereri, Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and Ple the protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Bogor Agricultural University (permit number 05-2010 RSHP-IPB) all of the animal experiments in Japan were performed in accordance with the National University Corporation, Hokkaido University Regulations on animal experimentation.

FBAHV1- or mock-infected Vero cells were lysed in lysis buffer. euthanized mice were euthanized by isoflurane inhalation. the PCR products were directly sequenced in both directions. heat-inactivated bat sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for a further 5 days. the complete FBAHV1 genome sequence was deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession no. AB825953. we inoculated fruit bat kidney T1 cells and vero cells with spleen homogenates derived from fruit bats. the cells adopted a rounded morphology at days 3 and 6 (Vero cells) postinoculation. negative-stain electron microscopy identified virus particles (100 to 120 nm) that appeared to have enveloped capsids. the morphology of these particles was typical of herpesviruses (37). so, tentatively named this novel herpesvirus fruit bat alphaherpesvirus 1 (FBAHV1) FBAHV1 clustered with the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. a previous study also reported the identification of a partial nucleotide sequence (465 bp) of UL30 from alphaherpesviruses isolated from fruit bats. the total length of the genome is 149,459 bp. the scale is shown in the center. the introns in the RL2 and UL15 genes are inferred. 27193 515 Tegument serine/threonine protein kinase 67.2 UL14 26953\u201327465 170 Tegument protein 61.2 UL15 DNA packaging terminase subunit 1 Exon 1 27680\u201328705 + 342 81.9 Exon 2 32097\u201333272 + 391 83.6 UL16 28752\u201329846 364 Tegument protein 57.2 UL17 29860\u201332037 725 Put egress lamina protein 76.1 UL32 64179\u201365930 583 DNA packaging protein 73.4 UL33 65929\u201366318 + 129 DNA packaging protein 64.3 UL34 66381\u201367211 + 276 Nuclear egress membrane protein 57.2 UL35 67296\u201367625 + 109 Small capsid protein; VP1-VP2 59.2 UL37 76894\u201380151 1085 Tegument phosphoprotein 63.7 UL UL49A 102114\u2013102359 81 Glycoprotein N 24.7 UL50 102372\u2013103436 + 354 Deoxyuridine triphosphatase 40.5 UL51 103553\u2013104242 229 Tegument protein 68.0 UL52 104317\u2013107457 + 1046 Helicase-primase primase subunit 64.7 UL53 107427\u2013108434 + 335 Glycoprotein K 66.3 UL54 10 phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of the full-length amino acid sequences of viral DNA polymerase (Dpol), which is encoded by UL30 (a) and glycoprotein G (gG), which is encoded by US4 (b), from the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. the branch labels represent the 95% highest posterior density interval of the substitution rate. equid herpesvirus 9 (EHV-9), felid herpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1), gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2), human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3), leporid herpesvirus 4 (LHV-4), macacine herpesvirus 2 (McHV-1), papiine herpesvirus 2 (PsHV-1), saimiriine herpesvirus 1 analysis using an anti-HSV-1 antibody (B0114) showed that FBAHV1 infected all of the cell lines tested. however, there was no evidence of syncytium formation. real-time PCR confirmed viral replication at 8 h p.i. BALB/c mice infected intranasally with 105 PFU of FBAHV1 reached an ethical endpoint within 6 days. a relatively large amount of FBAHV1 was detected in the liver at 5 days p.i. and in the lungs at 3 days p.i. the amount of the FBAHV1 genome in tissues was determined by real-time PCR. four mock-infected mice were included as negative controls. FBAHV1 antigens (brown) were detected by staining with an anti-HSV-1 polyclonal antibody. PCR-positive cases belonged to species Pteropus vampyrus and Acerodon celebensis. last species is related to Pteropus hypomelanus. serum samples were obtained from 104 of 133 fruit bats. we inoculated fruit bat kidney T1 cells and vero cells with spleen homogenates derived from fruit bats. the cells adopted a rounded morphology at days 3 (FBKT1 cells) and 6 (Vero cells) postinoculation. this pteropodid bat was similar to Pteropus hypomelanus. vero cells exposed to a spleen homogenate show a rounded morphology. the genome of FBAHV1 is 149,459 bp in length. it has a GC content of 61%. phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of the deduced full-length amino acid sequences of viral DNA polymerase (encoded by the UL30 gene) and glycoprotein G (encoded by the US4 gene) FBAHV1 clustered with the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. previous study also reported the identification of a partial nucleotide sequence (465 bp) of UL30 from alpha RL1 2328\u20133206 + 292 ICP34.5 39.0 RL2 ICP0 Exon 1 4288\u20135061 + 257 34.8 Exon 2 5995\u20136330 + 249 Glycoprotein L 37.2 UL2 9177\u20139839 + 220 Uracil-DNA glycosylase 70.0 UL3 9923\u201310591 + 681 Capsid portal protein 65.0 UL7 15914\u201316801 + 295 Tegument protein putative tegument protein 59.0 UL18 33372\u201334328 318 Capsid triplex subunit 2; VP23 76.7 UL19 34471\u201338616 1381 Major capsid protein; VP5 83.3 UL20 38784\u201339446 220 Membrane protein 64.5 UL21 39896\u201341461 + 521 Tegument protein 62.7 UL22 41550\u201344126 858 Glycoprotein H VP1-VP2 59.2 UL37 76894\u201380151 1085 Tegument phosphoprotein 63.7 UL38 80515\u201381903 + 462 Capsid triplex subunit 1; VP19C 58.7 UL39 82257\u201385988 + 1243 Ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 76.6 UL41 87161\u201388654 497 Tegument host shutoff protein 67.8 4.7 UL53 107427\u2013108434 + 335 Glycoprotein K 66.3 UL54 109273\u2013110898 + 541 Multifunctional regulatory protein; ICP27 50.0 UL55 111194\u2013111745 + 541 Membrane protein 62.8 UL56 113410\u2013114273 287 Membrane protein 34.2 RL2 ICP0 Exon 1 116505\u2013116840 111 51.0 Exon 2 117774\u2013118547 257 genomes of human herpesvirus 3, cercopithecine herpesvirus 9, gallid herpesvirus 2, and meleagrid herpesvirus 1 were not determined. the sequence of the DNA polymerase ORF was absent from the genomes of human herpesvirus 3, cercopithecine herpesvirus 9, gallid herpesvirus 2, gallid herpesvirus 3, and meleagrid herpesvirus 1. pesvirus 2 (HHV-2), human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3), leporid herpesvirus 4 (LHV-4), macacine herpesvirus 2 (MaHV-1), papiine herpesvirus 2 (PaHV-1), psittacid herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1), saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1), and suid herpesvirus 1 real-time PCR confirmed viral replication at 8 h p.i. CHO-K1 cells supported virus replication as efficiently as the other cell lines. each cell line was infected with FBAHV1 or mock infected for 16 h at an MOI of 0.1. after fixation, FBAHV1 antigens (green) were visualized by staining with an anti-HSV-1 polyclonal antibody. a relatively large amount of FBAHV1 was detected in the liver at 5 days p.i. (Fig. 5b) and in the lungs at 3 days p.i. (Fig. 5c) no copies of the FBAHV1 genome were detected in the brain. FBAHV1 antigens (brown) were detected by staining with an anti-HSV-1 polyclonal antibody. PCR was used to screen for the UL19 gene using FBAHV1-specific primers. no variant of FBAHV1 was identified in this assay. serum samples were obtained from 104 of the 133 fruit bats. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect anti-FBAHV1 antibodies in the serum samples. we then performed virus neutralization tests using vero cells. fruit bats that were seropositive for antibodies to FBAHV1 were identified from four species of the family Pteropodidae in different areas of Indonesia. we also detected viral genomic DNA and antiviral antibodies in three and four bat species, respectively. these bats were captured at six different locations in Indonesia, and all belonged to the family Pteropodidae. FBAHV1 is the first alphaherpesvirus to be isolated from bats. this lineage is distant from that of parixa virus, which was isolated from an insectivorous bat."}
