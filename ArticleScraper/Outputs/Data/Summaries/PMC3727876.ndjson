{"summary": "alveolar epithelial cells are known to be susceptible in vivo. but the extent of infection for submerged primary cultures of human type II cells was too limited to define the cytokine and interferon responses to infection. the critical feature for infecting human type II cells with SARS-CoV involves maintaining and infecting the cells under air\u2013liquid interface conditions. cultures were incubated for an additional 4 days with medium containing KIA, IL-4, IL-13, and 10 nM dexamethasone (D) after 8 days of culture on the inserts and 6 days under A/L conditions, cells were used for virus inoculation or harvested. the yield of infectious virus was titered in washes of cell surfaces and basal medium by plaque assays on vero E6 cells. the methods for immunocytochemistry, the quantitation of infected cells, virus production, plaque assays, the isolation of RNA, quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, surface biotinylation, and statistical analysis are described in the online supplement. /L conditions, cells were used for virus inoculation or harvested. type II cells were inoculated on the apical surface with 250 l per six-well plate insert. cultures were incubated for 24 or 48 hours after virus inoculation. we evaluated a variety of changes in the culture system to improve the rate of infection. we found that susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and the maintenance of differentiation were achieved by culturing cells at an A/L on millicell inserts coated with a matrix of rat-tail collagen and Matrigel. cells contained readily identifiable lamellar bodies according to phase microscopy (Figure 1A) human alveolar type II cells were cultured at an air\u2013liquid interface (A/L) as described for infection with SARS-CoV. phase micrograph of the epithelial monolayer with inclusions (lamellar bodies) clearly visible within the cytoplasm of type II cells. the effect of A/L culture conditions and treatment with IL-4 and IL-13 on selected proteins by immunoblotting. oculated with 250 l of medium containing SARS-CoV at an estimated multiplicity of 2 pfu/cell. the apical fluid and inoculum were aspirated, and cells were maintained under A/L conditions. we found little evidence of infection at 4 hours after virus inoculation. by 24 hours after virus inoculation, infected cells were readily detected. cell cultures were inoculated with SARS-CoV at an estimated multiplicity of infection of 2. virions bud intracellularly from membranes of the ER\u2013Golgi-intermediate compartment, and are released from cells by an exocytic process. Coronavirus virions, approximately 100 nm in diameter, were observed within numerous secretory vesicles in cells that also contained lamellar bodies. the characteristic double-membrane vesicles that comprise the sites of viral RNA replication are depicted in Figure 3B (34, 35), and virions were observed budding into vesicles. we used both real-time quantitative PCR and plaque assays. each donor was deidentified and received a number. most donors were used for only one type of experiment because of limited number cells isolated from each donor. alveolar type II cells at the A/L showed a Vigorous innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection. alveolar type II cells at the A/L were readily infected by SARS-CoV. chemoattractants released by epithelial cells would be expected to recruit inflammatory cells in vivo. mRNA concentrations of chemokines and cytokines were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. the white bars represent data from mock-inoculated inserts. at 6 hours after virus inoculation, only significant increase in detected mRNA concentrations involved the interferon-responsive gene ISG56. alveolar type I\u2013like cells at the A/L were also susceptible to SARS-CoV. these type I\u2013like cells derived from type II cells in vitro may differ from type I cells in vivo (36). culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an A/L maintains their cellular differentiation. the level of ACE2 expression was slightly increased in type II cells cultured under A/L conditions, but ACE2 concentrations varied considerably between cells from individual donors. however, according to flow cytometry and surface biotinylation, we were unable to detect any increase in the surface expression of ACE2 in cells maintained under A/L conditions. IL-4 and IL-13 significantly increased the expression of ACE2. we tested whether type II cells cultured at the A/L were more susceptible to SARS-CoV than type II cells in submerged cultures (18), human type II cells cultured at an A/L on six-well inserts were inoculated. the infected cells were epithelial and expressed TTF-1 and SP-A. the markers were chosen because they could be readily detected in the methanol-fixed cells required for identifying the viral antigens. in all experiments, only a portion of the cells were infected. coronaviruses are released from polarized epithelial cells by exocytosis at the apical plasma membrane. others are released at basolateral membranes (33). virions do not bud from the plasma membrane, although released virions often remain adherent to the plasma membrane of infected cells. the inset depicts a higher magnification of one of these double-membrane vesicles. the inset depicts a higher magnification of one of these double-membrane vesicles. the inset depicts a higher magnification of one of these vesicles. the points represent the means and standard errors from four independent experiments. no medium was recoverable from the cells at the A/L, we washed the apical surface at designated times after virus inoculation. titered the released virus in the apical wash as well as in the basolateral medium. chemoattractants released by epithelial cells would be expected to recruit inflammatory cells in vivo. type II cells at an A/L were cultured and inoculated with SARS-CoV. after the 4-hour inoculation period, the inoculum was aspirated. we detected no SARS-CoV infection of human alveolar type I\u2013like cells under submerged conditions. but when we undertook screening to select a donor, we observed that transdifferentiated type I\u2013like cells could be infected with SARS-CoV. these type I\u2013like cells derived from type II cells in vitro may differ from type I cells in vivo. infected cells alert other cells and organs to infection by secreting cytokines and chemokines. infected epithelial cells are likely the first responders, and initiate the innate immune response. the next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of interferon and interferon-responsive genes. thelial cells, and not the subsequently recruited inflammatory cells, constitute the primary source of elevated cytokines in patients with SARS-CoV. our data show that type II alveolar cells likely contribute to the high concentrations of cytokines and chemokines detected in the gas-exchange portion of the lungs. in the sera of patients with SARS, the cytokine that increases most rapidly is CXCL10 (IP-10). the increased rate of SARS-CoV infection in type II cells under A/L conditions was attributable to an increased concentration of ACE2. however, we did not measure ACE2 concentrations in cells from enough different donors who were also inoculated with SARS-CoV. we did not detect a consistent increase in the surface expression of ACE2 by either flow cytometry or surface biotinylation. IL-4/IL-13 decreases SP-C and SP-D but exerts little effect on SP-A or SP-B (44). the slight decrease in SP-D could enhance the SARS infection, although this is unlikely, based on our experiments with 229E-6V (another coronavirus), in which SP-D did not make a major difference in the 229E-6V infectability of human alveolar macrophages (45). culturing at an A/L renders primary human alveolar type II cells susceptible to productive SARS-CoV infection. the cells mount a robust innate immune response, similar to that observed in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS."}
