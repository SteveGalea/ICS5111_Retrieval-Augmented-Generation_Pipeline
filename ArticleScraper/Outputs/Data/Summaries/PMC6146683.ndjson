{"summary": "induction of programed host cell death via apoptosis and necrosis is a common response of multicellular organisms to the stress of pathogenic infection. pathogens have evolved many strategies to evade cell death-based host defenses, which have been studied intensively in herpesviruses. 120/160-induced apoptosis (12), and autologous cell-mediated killing (13, 14) have been proposed as possible triggers of HIV-associated apoptosis in uninfected cells. it is possible that the promotive effect of apoptosis on some HSV-associated diseases is also due to the killing of uninfected cells by viral infection. the antiviral function of p53 has been confirmed in many viruses. the effect of p53 on ILTV infection has not yet been reported. ILTV infection induces apoptosis in uninfected host cells. no significant difference in any characteristic investigated was observed either in vitro or in ovo. no significant difference in any characteristic investigated was observed in vitro or in ovo. the survival rate of inoculated embryos was calculated at 7 days postinfection. the data are presented as the means SD (n = 10; P 0.05). ILTV infection induces apoptosis in uninfected cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. ILTV-induced apoptosis of PI-negative LMH cells was assayed by flow cytometry using annexin V-APC staining. the percentage of apoptotic cells is presented as the means SD (n = 3; P 0.05). agents were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of CAMs via TUNEL-APC staining at 1 day postinfection (dpi) Upon the addition of these compounds, embryo livers and embryo survival were examined after ILTV infection. both Z-VAD-FMK and TPCK blocked ILTV-induced apoptosis, but not 5-FU, which promoted ILTV-induced apoptosis, reduced the severity of liver damage in ILTV the effects of apoptosis on ILTV replication and spreading next were investigated using ILTV-specific reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) instead of a plaque assay or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. at 1 dpi, no difference in viral load in either allantoic fluid or CAMs was observed among the groups. ILTV-induced apoptosis helps ILTV to spread from the primary infection site to distant tissues. ovo viral replication in allantoic fluid, CAMs, brains, and livers at 1, 2, and 5 days postinfection was detected by RT-qPCR. cells detected by annexin V-APC staining using annexin V-APC. apoptosis was clearly observed in cells incubated with CM. the exclusion of viable virions was confirmed by the absence of viable virions. RNA samples isolated from living cells without any treatment, uninfected apoptotic cells after ILTV inoculation, ILTV-infected cells, and apoptotic cells cultured in CM were submitted for RNA sequencing. no significant difference in total amount of RNA was observed among the groups at the time of detection. viral RNA accounted for approximately 20% of the total RNA of infected cells. RNA level per 100 isolated cells (B) and proportions of viral and host RNA (C) are presented as the means SD (n = 3; P 0.05). FPKM, fragments per kilobase million. apoptotic cells isolated from the ILTV infection group and the CM group were under different cellular conditions at the time of collection. the transcriptional profile of uninfected apoptotic cells from the ILTV inoculation group represents the cellular environment for the initiation of paracrine apoptosis. the additional 758 genes that were altered only by CM may be important for the maintenance of paracrine apoptosis. p53 is a key determinant of paracrine-regulated apoptosis in uninfected cells. it is widely recognized as a transcriptional factor regulating multiple signaling pathways, such as metabolism, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. p53 is a key determinant of paracrine-regulated apoptosis in uninfected cells. no alteration of p53 protein levels was observed in either EGFP-positive or EGFP-negative cells upon ILTV infection or CM incubation. however, the repression of p53 basal transcriptional activity in uninfected apoptotic cells is achieved via other regulation mechanisms of p53 activity. neither mechanism could be detected in chickens in this study. nutlin-3a significantly reduced paracrine-regulated apoptosis during ILTV infection. protein levels of p53 were examined by flow cytometry in LMH cells after ILTV infection (blue) or inoculation with conditioned medium (CM; red) in the presence or absence of Nutlin-3a treatment was assayed by flow cytometry. nutlin-3a-mediated rescue of uninfected cells from paracrine-regulated apoptosis was transcription dependent, because it was only halted by PFT- but was generally unaffected by PFT-. p53 is key determinant of paracrine-regulated apoptosis in uninfected cells during ILTV infection. p53 activity was blocked by siRNA-mediated p53 depletion (C and E), PFT-, or PFT-, an inhibitor of p53 posttranslational activity (D and F respectively) the data in panels B to F are presented as the means SD. prosurvival effect of p53 on paracrine-regulated apoptosis of uninfected cells was investigated. p53 knockdown using siRNA or the administration of PFT- had no effect on ILTV replication at 24 hpi. p53-mediated repression of ILTV replication was not a transient effect. repression of viral replication by nutlin-3a was also observed at 72 hpi. MH chicken hepatoma cell line is the only cell line susceptible to ILTV infection in vitro. ovo studies were carried out to determine whether the above-mentioned effects of p53 were cell line-specific effects. p53 is a key determinant of ILTV infection in ovo. the effect of p53 on the survival of inoculated embryos was also investigated. the death of inoculated embryos occurred at 4 dpi, and 40% of inoculated embryos were dead by 7 dpi. the death of inoculated embryos occurred 2 days earlier. the scale bar indicates 50 m. (D) the percentage of apoptotic cells per field was quantified statistically by observing 100 cells per field in 3 fields per slide. ILTV infection induces apoptosis in uninfected host cells. the deletion of the US9 gene was proved by PCR. no significant difference in any characteristic investigated was observed either in vitro or in ovo. PCR validation of the US9 deletion indicates all lanes are spliced from the same gel. annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC) at 36 h postinfection (hpi) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. more than 15% of the uninfected cells were positive for annexin V-APC staining. apoptotic cells were rarely observed among the 35% of cells positive for EGFP. ILTV-infected LMH cells and apoptotic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy via tracing EGFP and annexin V-APC. immunofluorescence staining of CAMs (C) and embryo livers (D) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against glycoprotein I of ILTV followed by an FITC-conjoined anti-rabbit secondary antibody and TUNEL-APC staining. 5-FU, which blocked ILTV-induced apoptosis, reduced liver damage in ILTV-inoculated embryos at 5 dpi. ILTV induced embryo death 1 day earlier, and all ILTV-inoculated embryos were dead at 6 dpi. ILTV-induced apoptosis is important for the severity of the pathological effect. the effects of apoptosis on ILTV replication and spreading next were investigated using ILTV-specific reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) instead of a plaque assay or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. at 1 dpi, no difference in viral load in either allantoic fluid or CAMs was observed among the groups. ILTV-induced apoptosis helps ILTV spread from the primary infection site to distant tissues. viral replication in allantoic fluid, CAMs, brains, and livers at 1, 2, and 5 days postinfection was detected by RT-qPCR. data are presented in log10 form. apoptosis was clearly observed in cells incubated with CM. the exclusion of viable virions was confirmed by the absence of EGFP-positive cells from the lower chamber. the induction of apoptosis by CM was also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining with annexin V-APC. no significant difference in total amount of RNA was observed among the groups at the time of detection. viral RNA accounted for approximately 20% of the total RNA of infected cells. bioinformatics analysis identified 1,911 genes that were differentially expressed among the groups based on following criteria. 1,911 genes were differentially expressed in LMH cells at P 0.001, q 0.001, and a fold change of >1.5. columns indicate arrays, and rows indicate genes. values are normalized by row. blue indicates downregulation, and pink indicates upregulation. apoptotic cells from the ILTV inoculation group represent the cellular environment for the initiation of paracrine apoptosis. apoptotic cells from the ILTV inoculation group represent the cellular environment for the initiation of paracrine apoptosis. the additional 758 genes that were altered only by CM may be important for the maintenance of paracrine apoptosis. p53 is a key determinant of paracrine-regulated apoptosis in uninfected cells after ILTV infection. p53 is widely recognized as a transcriptional factor regulating multiple signaling pathways, such as metabolism, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. p53 is a key determinant of paracrine-regulated apoptosis in uninfected cells. p53 basal transcriptional activity in uninfected apoptotic cells was evidenced by both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analyses. neither mechanism could be detected in chickens in this study. protein levels of p53 were examined by flow cytometry in LMH cells. p53 was repressed using a short interfering RNA targeting TP53. the administration of pifithrin- (PFT-), a well-known p53 inhibitor, was shown to inhibit p53 activity in both mammalian and chicken cells. p53-mediated rescue of uninfected cells from paracrine-regulated apoptosis was greatly compromised by siRNA-mediated p53 depletion. p53 activity was blocked by siRNA-mediated p53 depletion (C and E), PFT-, an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity, or PFT-, an inhibitor of p53 posttranslational activity. the prosurvival effect of p53 on the paracrine-regulated apoptosis of uninfected cells was investigated. p53 activation in uninfected cells was halted by siRNA-mediated p53 depletion. p53 activation in uninfected cells is sufficient to rescue uninfected cells. p53-mediated repression of ILTV replication was not a transient effect. unexpectedly, PFT- treatment itself, which had no effect on viral replication at 24 hpi, repressed viral replication significantly at 72 hpi. this finding was correlated with faster cell death after PFT- treatment during ILTV infection. p53 is a key determinant of ILTV infection in ovo. p53 is a key determinant of ILTV infection in ovo. p53 is a key determinant of ILTV infection in ovo. p53 is a key determinant of the pathological effect of ILTV infection in ovo. at least two mechanisms, delayed viral dissemination and repressed viral replication, were involved in the reduced viral load caused by nutlin-3a treatment in the brain and liver. apoptosis induced in uninfected cells during viral infection may have the opposite effect. ILTV infection triggers the apoptosis of uninfected cells in a host immune response-independent manner. this effect of ILTV infection contributed to the pathological effect and early tissue transmission of ILTV. the underlying mechanisms remain unknown but are important for developing novel strategies targeting the interactions between ILTV and host cells for better control of diseases. the disruption of Src-FAK cooperation significantly represses ILTV replication but also promotes ILTV-associated cell death and pathological damage. p53 activation protects cells from ILTV-induced paracrine-regulated apoptosis. in uninfected cells, p53 activation protects cells from p53-induced paracrine-regulated apoptosis. in infected cells, p53 activation suppresses ILTV replication. TPCK showed greater effects than Z-VAD-FMK, which is most likely due to the greater reduction of the apoptosis of host cells by TPCK. other mechanisms in terms of the repression of ILTV infection by TPCK should also be taken into account. an in vitro experimental model with an MOI of 0.001 was found to promote host DNA replication in both infected and uninfected cells via an unknown paracrine-regulated mechanism (49). this finding is consistent with our analysis of genome-wide gene expression data, which demonstrated that ILTV infection elevates the metabolic signaling pathways of both infected and uninfected cells. the animal experimental protocol was approved and performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the animal ethics committee. chicken embryos were inoculated into allantoic cavities of 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos were examined daily for 7 days. the strain can be propagated in a chemically immortalized leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cell line with clear cytopathic effects (52, 53) the cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. the indicated MOI was obtained according to the number of cells to be infected and the estimated number of infectious particles. apoptosis was assayed using the annexin V-APC staining kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, Nanjing, China), the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI double staining kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, Shanghai, China) Embryonic CAMs and livers were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. the fixed samples were sent to the Plaques Diagnosis and Technical Service Center of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. list of RT-qPCR primers Gene Direction Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) CCNB2 F GATGGGAAGACGATCAATGGAC R ACAACAGATCGAGTCCATCCT CNBP F GCTTCCAGTTCATCATCTC R DDX47 F TACGAGCTCCTAGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTG RNA sequencing data were analyzed with the Galaxy web-based tool (57) pathway analysis was performed with DAVID (58) functional protein network analysis was performed with STRING (59).
