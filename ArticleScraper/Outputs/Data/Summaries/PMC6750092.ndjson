{"summary": "the ribosome reads nucleotide triplets in a successive, nonoverlapping fashion. for a given coding sequence, it is the start codon (most likely AUG) that establishes the reading frame. only one reading frame serves as the coding template for functional proteins. elongation factor 4 mediates one codon forward movement of mRNA:tRNA complexes, elongation factor 4 (EF4) catalyzes back-translocation. lack of EF4 has been shown to reduce translation fidelity under stress conditions [13], suggesting that translocation is error-prone. mRNA coding sequences are subject to multilevel optimization during evolution to minimize frameshift errors. results 2.1. Measuring Spontaneous Frameshift Rates during Translation. compared to the in-frame control, we observed a reproducible +1 FS rate of 0.52% in HEK293 cells and 0.37% in MEF cells. after adjustment by the size of the FS window, the average +1 FS rate per codon in HEK293 and HEK293 cells is 0.04% and 0.03%. the line plot represents average ribosome density within a window of 200 nt. the ratio of average ribosome density between first and second half of each ORF is plotted against the ORF size. the seemingly low FS rates measured from the reporter assay could have striking effects on ribosome engagement. the overall ribosome drop-off is expected to increase as function of CDS length. however, the ratio of ribosome density between the first and second half of CDS largely maintains irrespective of the CDS size. the same pattern also holds true in MEF cells ( and ) the ribosome is positioned when a particular codon is encountered. a typical ribosome footprint covers 10 or so codons. we expect to see uniform IFR values among the 61 sense codons. all 61 sense codons are plotted by the average codon coverage score of RPFs (x-axis) against the average in-frame rate (y-axis) transcripts are aligned at the annotated start codon (1st AUG, green triangle) or internal AUG codons (blank triangle) ribosome dwell time, the 5\u2032 end codon identity of RPFs influences both footprint abundance and reading frame fidelity in a coordinated manner. we previously attributed the elevated ribosome density at the +12 nt position after the AUG start codon to the peptide tunnel within the ribosome. some ribosome footprints could be inflated as a result of sequencing bias. the high IFR values associated with certain RPFs could also be seen in the absence of cycloheximide (CHX) the 5\u2032 end bears reliable information in inferring ribosome positions. the 5\u2032 end codon preference observed in ribosome footprints is not a result of experimental aberrations. we observed a positive correlation between Ribo-seq and 5P-seq results in both 5\u2032 end codon coverage and in-frame rate. \u201csticky\u201d codon-associated ribosomal pausing facilitates downstream reading frame fidelity. when the \u201csticky\u201d codon reaches the exit site of the mRNA tunnel, the mRNA likely loops back towards the ribosome (top panel). we classified all the transcripts into two groups depending on whether the +12 nt peak is above or below the average ribosome density. the downstream region showed a surprisingly lower average IFR value than the first 3 codons. however, it is possible that these transcripts contain overlapping out-of-frame ORFs in the 5\u2032-proximal region. a prominent ribosome pause at this \u201csticky\u201d codon resulted in a much improved IFR with an increase of 17%. both \u201csticky\u201d and \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequences were carefully chosen to avoid AUG and stop codons in all three reading frames. +1 FS reporter containing the \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequence was about 4-fold higher than the \u201csticky\u201d counterpart in both HEK293 and MEF cells. mRNA:rRNA pairing serves as a \u201cbrake\u201d at the outside of the mRNA tunnel to prevent overmovement of the message during translocation. mRNA:rRNA pairing is less favorable than the one bearing \u201csticky\u201d codons in frame 1. it is unclear whether these \u201csticky\u201d sequences would promote frameshifting once they are placed in different reading frames preceding the Rluc coding region. the presence of hundreds of rDNA copies in cells prevents us from using genome editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9. instead, we mutated the 3\u2032 terminal CAU triplet of 18S rRNA into GCC. the resultant 18S(GCC) mutant is expected to establish new base pairing with mRNA codons like GGC. -site codons (white circle) or 5\u2032 end codons (grey circle) in HEK293 cells expressing wild type (x-axis) or mutant (y-axis) 18S rRNA. data are shown as means SEM, n = 3. P 0.01, t-test. mRNA:rRNA interaction alters global \u201cstickiness\u201d of sequences. the ribosome reads the message via the decoding center, but also scans the mRNA using the tail of 18S rRNA. postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction plays an unexpected role in reading frame fidelity. mRNA:rRNA pairing only prevents +1 FS but not \u20131 FS. the \u201csticky\u201d sequence is rather safe in frame 1 because it does not induce +1 frameshifting errors. the stop codon of OAZ1 appears to be a dividing point for \u201csticky\u201d codon composition in frame 2. the stop codon of OAZ1 serves as the +1 PRF site. this result supports the view that codon optimization is highly coordinated between general coding regions and specific PRF signals. no AUG start codons are present in frame 1 before the Rluc coding region. only after the +1 FS events taking place within a window delimited by the nearest stop codons flanking the insertion site can the shifted ribosome reach frame 1 coding region of Rluc. the middle panel shows the predicted ribosome occupancy along the Rluc coding region based on the +1 FS rate of 0.03% and \u20131 FS of 0.02%. the bottom panel shows the density of RPFs mapped to the Rluc coding region in transfected cells. the average trend of ribosome occupancy along the Rluc coding region does not parallel with predicted exponential decay. we then assessed global ribosome drop-off across endogenous transcripts by comparing the average ribosome density for the first and second half of each coding region (CDS) in HEK293 cells. we computed the in-frame rate (IFR) for footprints mapped to individual codon positions by calculating the percentage of RPFs aligned to frame 0. The IFR value represents, on a relative scale, how accurately the ribosome is positioned when a particular codon is encountered. the 5\u2032 end codon identity of footprints influences read abundance and reading frame fidelity. all 61 sense codons are plotted by the average codon coverage score of RPFs (x-axis) against the average in-frame rate (y-axis). both the A-site and P-site codon identities influence the RPF abundance. the 5\u2032 end codon identity of RPFs influences footprint abundance and reading frame fidelity in a coordinated manner. this result suggests that the 5\u2032 end codon-associated ribosomal pausing is coupled with reading frame fidelity. RNA-seq reads exhibit an obvious A/T enrichment for the first nucleotide. despite the common A preference for the 5\u2032 end nucleotide, RNA-seq reads exhibit poor correlation between read abundance and IFR for their 5\u2032 end codons. despite the varying data quality and using different species, RPFs with certain 5\u2032 end codons are well separated in terms of IFR values. 5P-seq revealed a shifted 5\u2032 end position compared to Ribo-seq. this result affirms that the 5\u2032 end codon preference observed in ribosome footprints is not a result of experimental aberrations. mRNA:rRNA Pairing Influences Ribosome pausing and reading frame rate. the ribosome pauses whenever the AUG codon reaches the mRNA exit site of the ribosome after decoding. the same feature is evident for other AUG-like codons, such as AUC, but not non-AUG codons like GUC. the feature of \u201csticky\u201d codons in eukaryotic mRNAs is analogous to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence found in bacterial messages. it is expected that the first event of such interaction occurs when the ribosome decodes the 5th codon. mRNA:rRNA pairing helps maintain the reading frame fidelity in downstream regions. mRNA:rRNA pairing helps retain the ribosome in the reading frame originally set by the internal codon. mRNA:rRNA pairing exhibits reading frame-specific effects. both \u201csticky\u201d and \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequences were carefully chosen to avoid AUG and stop codons in all three reading frames. the presence of \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequence slightly lowered the Rluc level in the in-frame control. however, the marked difference seen in the +1 FS reporter was not observable in the \u20131 FS reporter. schematic of FS reporters with \u201csticky\u201d inserts in different frames between flag and Rluc. data shown as means SEM, n = 3. p 0.01, t-test. mRNA:rRNA pairing in the small ribosome subunit when the \u201csticky\u201d codon is present in frame 1 or frame 2. Mutant 18S rRNA alters global codon \u201cstickiness\u201d. mutant is expected to establish new base pairing with mRNA codons like GGC. mRNA:rRNA pairing in the small ribosome subunit bearing wild type. all 61 sense codons are plotted by the average IFR of RPFs with specified P-site codons (white circle) or 5\u2032 end codons (grey circle) in HEK293 cells expressing wild type (x-axis) or mutant (y-axis) 18S rRNA. data are shown as means SEM, n = 3. P 0.01, t-test. footprint 5\u2032 end codon identity was analyzed. some of their 5\u2032 end codons belong to GGC-like triplets. the true effect of 18S rRNA would be even greater. the \u201csticky\u201d sequence showed an increased Rluc levels in the presence of 18S(GCC) the ribosome reads the message via the decoding center, but also scans the mRNA using the tail of 18S rRNA. the postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction plays an unexpected role in reading frame fidelity. asymmetric distribution of \u201csticky\u201d codons among reading frames is highly conserved across different eukaryotic genomes. -actin gene ACTB showed very few \u201csticky\u201d codons in frame 2. the stop codon of OAZ1 appears to be a dividing point for \u201csticky\u201d codon composition in frame 2. mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a similar role in eukaryotic translation. the feature of mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a similar role in eukaryotic translation. mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a similar role in eukaryotic translation. the \u201csticky\u201d codons are clearly redistributed among different reading frames. mRNA:tRNA pairing at the decoding center and mRNA:rRNA pairing at the exit tunnel of the mRNA path. the latter ensures proper mRNA decoding via tRNA sampling. the latter secures the correct reading frame via a gripping mechanism. mRNA:rRNA pairing is centered on a codon essentially selected for initiation. the start codon AUG is shared with the internal methionine codon. it is tempting to speculate that its \u201cstickiness\u201d helps retain the translation machinery in the reading frame originally set by AUG. cells and Reagents HEK293 and MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium.
