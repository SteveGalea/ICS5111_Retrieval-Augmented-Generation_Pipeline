{"summary": "porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are the main pathogens that cause highly fatal acute diarrhea in newborn piglets. this is followed by vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality, resulting in enormous losses in the pig industry worldwide. the spike (S) glycoproteins of TGEV and PEDV possess antigen epitopes. previous reports have shown that the D antigen site in the S protein of TGEV and the core neutralizing epitope can elicit neutralizing antibodies against TGEV and PEDV infection. this suggests that these are promising candidate antigens for the development of a genetically engineered vaccine. a genetically engineered strain, rLpPGF-T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE, was constructed using the TGEV S protein D antigen site and PEDV S protein-neutralizing antigen epitope region COE as immunogens. the immunogenicity of this strain when administered in mice was evaluated, suggesting a potential approach for the prevention of TGEV and PEDV infection. details of all plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. pMD18-T-6D as a template for PCR to amplify DNA fragment 6D Liu et al. 2011 [31] peGFP-N1. gene encoding eGFP was inserted into pPG-T7g10-6D-COE at SacI and KpnI sites, generating recombinant plasmid pPG-T7g10-6D-COE. then, the fusion DNA fragment 6D-COE was inserted into the corresponding sites of pPG-T7g10, generating recombinant plasmid pPG-T7g10-6D- recombinant plasmid pPGF-T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE was deleted using restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. all recombinant plasmids were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. pPG-T7g10-6D-COE and pPGF-T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE were generated according to the steps indicated by the arrows. gene encoding 6D was inserted into plasmid pMD18-T-6D-COE. 2 fusion DNA fragment 6D-COE obtained from pMD18-T-6D-COE by SacI and ApaI digestion. recombinant strains rLpPGF-T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE and rLpPGF-T7g10-eGFP-6D-COE were grown in basal MRS broth at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h.
