{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a respiratory pathogen that causes severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide (1\u20134). the Arkansas type is one of the most common IBV serotypes isolated from chickens in the field (6, 7) the Ark-IBV was previously detected in the infected embryo using monoclonal antibodies (14) total nucleic acids were isolated from a 25-year-old pancreas sample of a chicken experimentally inoculated with homogenized infected embryo using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany), followed by DNase treatment with the TURBO DNA-free kit. the median read depth of the IBV assembly was 444. the final genome consensus of the isolate was 27,617 nucleotides long, excluding the poly(A) tail (100% genome coverage based on reference genome ArkDPI11), and had a 38% GC content. the complete genome sequence information would be useful for in-depth understanding of the role that live vaccines play in the recombination of IBVs. phylogenetic analysis of IBV isolates of the Arkansas-type variant based on the complete S1 gene sequences. the complete genome sequence of the GA/1359/1994 isolate of the ArkDPI-like strain has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number MN566147. the raw data were deposited under the accession number SRR10742607, BioSample number SAMN13020879, and BioProject number PRJNA556282."}
