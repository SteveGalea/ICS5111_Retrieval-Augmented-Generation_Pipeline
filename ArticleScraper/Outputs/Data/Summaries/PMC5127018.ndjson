{"summary": "in vitro studies of complex virus-host interactions require robust cell culture models that effectively recapitulate in vivo properties and characteristics. cells grown in conventional monolayer cell cultures often lack polarization and the architectural features of in vivo tissues. many newly-emerging and difficult-to-propagate viruses lack sufficient animal models. early attempts at 3D cell culture used explant tissue cultures [8,9]. the collection of explant tissue is limited by donor availability. more recent attempts at 3D modeling have included scaffold-based systems, scaffold-free systems, transwells and microfluidics [11,12,13]. 3D tissue aggregates are kept in a continuous free-fall state of neutral buoyancy. this low fluid-shear environment mimics the flow in vivo during development. cells grow around the microcarrier and develop complex structures observed in vivo. fully-differentiated aggregates can remain in the bioreactor for infection or aggregates can be harvested and plated for downstream experiments, including infections. cells are grown to confluence in two-dimensional (2D) conventional monolayer cell cultures, then are combined with microcarrier beads and appropriate media in the RWV bioreactor. the vaginal tissue SEM is modified from Hjelm et al. [25] with permission. to date, a wide variety of cell lines and tissues has been successfully cultured and reproduced in the RWV bioreactor. the purpose of this review is to highlight those studies that focus on modeling virus-host interactions in various tissue settings. infection [38] PLC/PRF/5 HEV Productive infection No CPE [39] Small Intestine INT-407 HuNoV Increase in viral RNA copies detected Vacuolization, shortening of apical microvilli, cell detachment from bead [40] No HuNoV replication detected No CPE [42,43] Colon Caco-2 HuNoV Increase in HuNoV RNA copies detected Shortening of apical microvilli the presence of tight junctions, mucus secretion and microvilli is not often present in cells grown in a conventional monolayer cell culture. the presence of tight junction proteins, mucus and other barrier features can also increase resistance to viral infections and more accurately represent in vivo virus-host interactions. virions were produced in 3D aggregates, while monolayer cell culture produced more noninfectious virions. these findings allow the speculation that the increased resistance to infection is due to the barrier features that polarized 3D aggregates exhibit when grown in the RWV bioreactor. 3D NHNP aggregates express mature neuronal markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific nuclear protein, -tubulin III and microtubule-associated protein A and B after 180 days in culture. NHNP cellular aggregates infected with fluorescently-labeled VZV showed a significant increase of VZV genome copies over an 18-day period. the development of 3D NHNP aggregates grown in the RWV bioreactor represents a step forward in the study of VZV virus-host interactions. further development of 3D aggregates to model virus latency and reactivation can provide new insights into the mechanisms of VZV pathogenesis. indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that EBV-positive cells cultured in the RWV bioreactor showed significantly lower expression levels of lytic cycle proteins compared to cells grown in conventional monolayer cell culture. the bioreactor can be used for culturing tissue blocks in the simulated microgravity environment, thereby maintaining their in vivo cellular organization and structure. three-Dimensional Models for Respiratory Viral Infections The respiratory epithelium forms a robust barrier to prevent infection. Tight junctions, cilia and mucus secretion are some of the important features of this barrier. conventional cell culture techniques are often used for the study of respiratory viruses, but lack many of the important features of the intact human respiratory epithelium. cytokine profiles from conventional monolayers infected with RSV and PIV3 showed pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other immune factors. cytokine profiles from conventional monolayers infected with RSV and PIV3 were not similar to the levels observed clinically. immunocytochemistry and visualization of cytoplasmic vacuoles appear to confirm a permissive SARS-CoV infection of the 3D aggregates. these initial studies with 3D respiratory aggregates are encouraging and could be applied to other newly-emerging respiratory viruses. INT-407 epithelial cells were initially grown in the RWV bioreactor with collagen-coated beads to form 3D aggregates to study HuNoV. the 3D aggregates possess apical microvilli, though these microvilli are shorter than those on in vivo human intestinal epithelial cells. both 3D Caco-2 and INT-407 aggregates were challenged with HuNoV and harvested for viral RNA titers. 3D Caco-2 aggregates do not support productive HuNoV infection. but they possess in vivo-like properties that can aid researchers in understanding interactions between intestinal epithelial cells and other gastrointestinal viruses. hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) have proven difficult to propagate in vitro. human cell culture models for HEV include PLC/PRF/5 hepatocarcinoma cells grown in conventional monolayer cell culture. the 3D aggregates become fully differentiated after a 28-day culture period and are viable in culture for over five months. despite this massive prevalence, the lack of model systems for HCV has limited researchers\u2019 ability to study virus-host interactions in vitro. RT-PCR of cellular RNA showed increased expression of hepatocyte nuclear factors that regulate hepatocyte differentiation. aggregates stained positive for tight junction proteins (occludin-1 and E-cadherin), cell adhesion proteins and HCV receptors (CD81 and SR-B1) by immunofluorescence. our laboratory was the first to develop and characterize 3D models of human cervical and vaginal tissue using the RWV bioreactor [25,27]. human models of the upper and lower genital tract, including the endometrium, have also recently been developed and characterized in our laboratory. 3D aggregates consisting of multiple microcarrier beads connected by cell-cell junctions at an early stage of development. immunofluorescence of 3D aggregates by laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrating localized mucus secretion. nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue); actin filaments are stained with phalloidin (red); mucin 1 (MUC1) is stained with FITC (green). kines, chemokines, mucus and anti-microbial products may provide a more accurate host immune response relative to conventional monolayers. exposure of 3D human vaginal and cervical aggregates to microbial products, including poly(I:C), induces the expression of a novel pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-36 [85] this was the first report of this cytokine in the FRT and was validated with human tissue. syncytia and brush borders present in 3D aggregates provide resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. cells in conventional monolayers remain susceptible to VSV infection. this 3D placenta model may also be useful for studying interactions between emerging viruses, including the Zika virus and its severe effects in pregnancy. Advancing RWV bioreactor Tissue Models with Enhanced Cellular Complexity Human tissues are complex multi-cellular microenvironments. co-culturing with lymphocytes and other immune cells increases the complexity of the tissues that can be modeled in the RWV bioreactor. research has implicated virus-host-microbiome interactions in the processes of viral entry, pathogenesis and the host immune response. commensal microbiota play a key role in maintaining a healthy, homeostatic microenvironment. disruption of this microbiota increases risk for STI acquisition. the increasing utilization of RWV bioreactors for cell lines from a wide variety of tissues holds the promise of enhancing our ability to study emerging viruses. new therapeutic agents and antiviral drugs can also be screened for toxicity and efficacy using 3D human aggregates to give more faithful representation of in vivo microenvironments."}
