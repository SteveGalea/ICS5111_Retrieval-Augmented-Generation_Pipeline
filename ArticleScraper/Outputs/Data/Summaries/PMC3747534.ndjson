{"summary": "a close relative of MERS-CoV has been identified as the pathogen causing outbreaks of SARS-like illness with a case fatality rate of 55% in the Middle East, Europe and Africa (7-9) a close relative of MERS-CoV has been identified as the pathogen causing outbreaks of SARS-like illness with a case fatality rate of 55% in the Middle East, Europe and Africa (7-9) coV is initiated by binding of the S protein to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (12) the virion-ACE2 complex is then translocated to endosomes. cathepsin inhibitors could significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV. the genome serves as a template for synthesizing full-length and subgenomic-length negative-strand RNAs. from genomic RNA and N protein in the cytoplasm, viral nucleocapsids are assembled. through exocytosis, virions are then released from the cell. multiple cysteine residues in the RBD region are important for maintaining the functional conformation of the RBDs of SARS-CoV (21) and MERS-CoV (24). the multiple cysteine residues in the RBD region are important for maintaining the functional conformation of the SARS-CoV S protein. a panel of 27 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was isolated from mice immunized with RBD conjugated with IgG Fc (RBD-Fc) mAbs 4D5 and 17H9 could recognize linear epitopes of RBD, but showed no neutralizing activity. mAbs that recognized Conf I and II did not significantly affect RBD binding with ACE2. mAbs 24H8 and 10E7 share the same epitope (Conf I), while 31H12 could also bind an epitope (Conf II) which could be recognized by both 10E7 and 45B5. a double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine was proven to elicit eosinophilic and immunoenhancing pathology. combinant S protein are able to cause Th2-mediated immunopathology (32) or some immune enhancement in vaccinated animals. a recombinant RBD without Fc tag expressed in mammalian (293T) cells, insect (Sf9) cells, and E. coli could induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice. sixth, RBD-based SARS vaccine could induce high titer of S-specific antibodies with long-term neutralizing activity. results indicate that RBD-based vaccines have good potential to be further developed as an effective and safe vaccine for preventing SARS-CoV infection and combating the recurrence of SARS pandemic. the design and development of a vaccine against MERS-CoV will need to follow an experimental path similar to that of our RBD-based SARS vaccine."}
