{"summary": "ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. the aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files. cilia beat in a coordinated fashion at a frequency of approximately 10 to 14 Hz, propelling mucus towards the pharynx where it is swallowed. ependymal cilia beat at a frequency of around 40 Hz, moving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) close to the ventricular wall. studies that describe this software lack two important elements: comparison of their results to the direct measurement of ciliary beat frequency from slow-motion video replay of cilia. phenotypes of PCD display respiratory cilia that beat at frequencies above 16 Hz and brain ependymal cilia beat at frequencies higher than 36 Hz. s of infant Wistar rats were prepared to allow ependymal cilia to be viewed on an inverted microscope using a 40 objective lens. each section was submerged under 4 ml of media 199 (M199, Gibco, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) as described previously [16]. Ethical approval for the collection of nasal epithelial cells was given by the Leicestershire Ethical Review Committee. we slowed ependymal ciliary beat frequency by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. cells were exposed to 1 ml M199 containing 300 ng of pneumolysin. at each time point, images were captured from four different areas. noise reduction We found that excluding data based on the following criteria significantly reduced the effect of background interference that can result from Fourier analysis. the amplitude of the peak must be greater than three times the amplitude of the background (defined as the maximum peak of the first three FFT Mag) data that does not support these criteria was defined as 0 Hz. all regions of interest were chosen based on areas where optimal images of moving cilia were visible to the observer. t tests were performed to compare the CBF obtained using the two methods and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were calculated from the mean difference. at least 512 or 1,024 frames were captured, respectively. the camera allows video sequences to be recorded at reduced frame rates or frame by frame. a visual basic macro is initiated to perform the FFT. the complex number is translated using the Excel function \u2018=IMABS(range)\u2019. the dominant frequency within the range is then established using the function \u2018=MAX(range)\u2019. color coding shows the intensity of the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) for each ROI. linear regression was used to correlate CBF measurements made by conventional frame by frame counting of individual ciliary beat cycles to measurements obtained using the ciliaFA system (for the same region of interest) for respiratory cilia the mean CBF was 11.72 2.8 Hz for the direct counting and 11.97 3.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. the addition of pneumolysin reduced the mean CBF of ependymal cilia within 5 minutes. data are from eight regions of interest (ROI) at each time point. previous studies reported limits of agreement ranging from 1.0 to 1.39 Hz [9], -2.75 to 5.15 Hz [7] and from 3.89 to 3.39 Hz [8] compared to digital high-speed methods. ciliaFA is reliable system to analyze CBF. it has high throughput capabilities allowing significant time savings. it reduces operator error due to selection bias, and it accurately reports static cilia. ciliaFA can report changes and reductions in ciliary beat frequency. we have included the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript. ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency over a wide range of frequencies. authors declare they have no competing interests. the recipient of the Internal Grant Agency of Ministry of Health Czech Republic (grant no.
