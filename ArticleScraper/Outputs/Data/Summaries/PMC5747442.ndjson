{"summary": "the use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance, with enhanced clinical microbiology, advanced diagnostics and more robust epidemiologic investigation, could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome. the most common agents detected among our surveyed population were: Haemophilus influenzae (67%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), human Rhinovirus (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterovirus (15%) and group A Streptococcus (12%). the use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome. information on common causes and associations of febrile illness is critically required. previous studies have adopted a syndromic approach to estimate global burden of disease due to diarrhea and pneumonia. a written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the interview. all patients provided written assent for participation. pediatric patients (1 to 15 years-of-age) also needed documented parent consent. this cross-sectional study was conducted at the Illovo Sugar Limited Estate Hospital (K1) and Clinic (K2) K1 Hospital is a private 80-bed hospital serving Illovo employees and dependents. employees and dependents are offered medical care free-of-charge; other community members who are not affiliated with the Illovo Company are offered care. clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory data were entered electronically onto Samsung tablets using an Open Data Kit (ODK) platform. data recorded on the eCRF included: patient vital signs, self-reported symptoms, self-reported previous and concurrent infections (i.e. malaria, HIV), provisional diagnoses, treatment recommendations, as well as final admission status. a total of 15 mL of venous blood was extracted, including 10 mL of whole blood (in two 5mL EDTA tubes) for aliquotting and 5 mL of whole blood (in one 5mL non-EDTA plain tube) for further centrifugation of serum. for children, smaller volumes of 5\u20138 mL total whole blood were obtained. total nucleic acid was extracted from one aliquot (2.5 ml) of blood using a syndromic taqMan Array Card (TAC) diagnostic platform. for whole blood processing, total nucleic acid was extracted from one aliquot (2.5 ml) of blood using high Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche Diagnostics) duplicate ports were used to detect conserved regions of the target organism. IRTP was performed on 10% of all positives and 10% of all negatives. for NP/OP processing, total nucleic acid was extracted from specimen. Influenza A positives were further sub-typed by PCR to explore lineages based upon the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein. IRTP was performed to determine final detection status. a written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the interview. pediatric patients (1 to 15 years-of-age) also needed documented parent consent in order to be enrolled. dependents and dependents are offered medical care free-of-charge. other community members who are not affiliated with the Illovo Company must pay a fee for service. a clinical officer or assistant medical officer entered all clinical data in a standardized electronic clinical case report form on the tablets using ODK Collect. data recorded on the eCRF included: patient vital signs, self-reported symptoms, self-reported previous and concurrent infections (i.e. malaria, HIV), provisional diagnoses, treatment recommendations, as well as final admission status. NP/OP swabs were placed in viral transport media (VTM) and stored in a \u201380\u00b0C freezer. results were scored as 0 (no parasites), 1+ (10\u201319 parasites/L), 2+ (20\u201329 parasites/L), 3+ (30\u201339 parasites/L), or 4+ (40 or more parasites/L). for whole blood processing, total nucleic acid was extracted from one aliquot (2.5 ml) of blood using high Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit. MS2 and PhHV were added to each sample to serve as built-in controls to confirm success of extraction process. individual real-time PCR (IRTP) was performed to determine final detection status. for all 30 agents detected by Respiratory TAC, duplicate ports were used to detect conserved regions of the target organism. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) descriptive statistics were presented as medians, ranges, and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and proportions and charts for categorical variables. all enrolled patients were Tanzanian, 851 (85%) lived on the grounds of the Estate. 823 (82%) were full-time residents of the Kilombero area. education levels varied among our adult population, with 479 (71%) patients having primary school-level education. the most common presenting complaints, other than fever, were headache (80%), cough (32%) and abdominal pain (19%). the mean axillary temperature was 38.4\u00b0C (range 37.5\u00b0C\u201440.5\u00b0C) which was consistent across all age groups. indicator Children (15yrs) (N = 139) Older Children (514yrs) (N = 190) Adult (15yrs) (N = 678) Total (N = 1007) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) n(%) 211 (21) Unknown 131 (94) 180 (95) 464 (68) 775 (77) Provisional Diagnosis Malaria 24 (17) 73 (38) 295 (44) 392 (39) Undefined Fever 30 (22) 40 (21) 120 (18) 190 (19) UTI 26 (19) 31 (16) 118 (17) 175 (17) Upper Respiratory Infection 33 (24) 43 (23) 88 (13) 164 (16) Pneumonia 44 (32) 27 (14) 79 (12 smear was performed, 4 (1%) revealed no parasite found, 17 (5%) were denoted as 1+, 133 (41%) were denoted as 2+, 111 (34%) were denoted as 3+, and 62 (19%) were denoted as 4+. diagnostic evaluations using both AFI and respiratory TAC identified 31 different viral, bacterial and parasitic agents. 127 (91) 64 (38) 258 (67) Streptococcus pneumoniae 59 (69) 93 (66) 61 (38) 213 (55) Moraxella cararrhalis 57 (67) 68 (49) 27 (17) 152 (39) Staphylococcus aureus 18 (21) 66 (7) 57 (36) 141 (37) Pseudomonas aeruginosa 35 (41) 53 (38) 49 (31) 137 (36) Detection Frequency N % No organism detected 421 50.0% One organism detected 414 49.2% Codetection of 2 organisms 7 0.8% Table 5.
