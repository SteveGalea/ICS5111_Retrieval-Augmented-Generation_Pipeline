{"summary": "a substrate library of 198 variants was created by performing saturation mutagenesis on the autocleavage sequence at P5 to P3' positions. the substrate sequences were inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins so that the cleavage rates were monitored by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer. the relative cleavage rate for different substrate sequences was correlated with various structural properties. native 3CLpro is a homodimer. each protomer of 34 kDa is divided into three domains. cleavage requires proteolytic cleavage by papain-like protease. 3CLpro detected cleavage only when Leu and Phe were present at P2 position. peptide substrates with acidic residues at P1 position and with Ile/Leu at P2' position were not cleavable. this is inconsistent with the observation that Phe is naturally occurring at this position of the autocleavage sequence. the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was discussed by FRET assay. the recombinant protein substrate comprised the autocleavage sequence (TSAVLQSGFRKM) inserted between CFP and YFP. cleavage of the peptide bond at SAVLQSGF by 3CLpro led to a time-dependent decrease in fluorescence at 530nm. the protein substrate cleaved by 1 to 4 M of 3CLpro led to a time-dependent decrease in fluorescence at 530 nm. the difference was the largest at P3 position, where positively charged substitutions resulted in 12-fold higher in proteolytic activity. the preference on charged residues indicated that electrostatic interaction, which is long-range in nature, may play a role in 3CLpro catalysis. 0.331 (0.154) 0.573 (0.008)* 0.064 (0.789) 0.711 (0.001)* P4 0.424 (0.063) 0.587 (0.006)* 0.147 (0.536) 0.315 (0.176) P3 0.338 (0.144) 0.221 (0.349) 0.170 (0.473) 0.510 (0.022) P2 0.255 (0.277) 0.590 (0.006)* 0.379 (0.100) 0.304 (0.192 the relative activity correlated well with the hydrophobicity of substituting residues. the relative activity also correlated well with the hydrophobicity of substituting residues. the correlation was more evident (r = 0.942, p = 0.001) when we excluded residues with side chain volume >80 3 from the analysis. the relative activity is directly proportional to the hydrophobicity of the substituting residues. no cleavage was detected for charged residues (Arg, Asp, Glu and Lys) the most favorite residue at P2 position was Leu (1.000.08), followed by Met (0.680.06) and Phe (0.420.05). on the other hand, -branched residues like Ile (0.130.01) and Val (0.090.01) were less preferred. substitution of P1-His at P1 position should weaken the enzyme-substrate interaction. the amide group of P1-Gln of the WT substrate sequence (thin stick) forms hydrogen-bonds with the N2 atom of His163 and the backbone carbonyl group of Phe140. substitutions to Phe, Thr and Val at P5 and to Val at P4 position resulted in significant increases in 3CLpro activity. the relative activity of 3CLpro against these substrate sequences was determined. TVRLQSGF and VVRLQSGF were 2.110.26, 1.870.19, 1.800.17, 2.100.34, 2.840.25 and 2.710.29 respectively. both studies showed that substitutions at P5 position resulted in substrate variants with activity higher than that for WT. a close inspection of their models revealed that binding mode of P1-His requires structural changes of the backbone atoms of the P1 residue. the structural changes may be accommodated in their tetrapeptide substrates, which lack residues beyond P1' position that may restrict the backbone conformation of the substrate. however, our model suggests that P1-His should form weaker interaction with the 3CLpro. the substrate specificity profiled in this study can be used as a benchmark for better computational simulation for 3CLpro-substrate/inhibitor interaction. the substrate specificity profiled in this study can be used as a benchmark for better computational simulation for 3CLpro-substrate/inhibitor interaction. the recombinant protein substrate comprised the autocleavage sequence (TSAVLQSGFRKM) inserted between CFP and YFP. after digestion by 3CLpro, the substrate of 58 kDa was cleaved into two fragments of 28 and 30 kDa. the protein substrate of 58 kDa (lane 1) was separated into two products of 28 kDa and 30 kDa (lane 2). Observed rate constant, kobs, was obtained by fitting the data to a single exponential decay. profiling of substrate specificity at P5 to P3' positions. the difference was the largest at P3 position, where positively charged substitutions resulted in 12-fold higher in proteolytic activity. the preference on charged residues indicated that electrostatic interaction, which is long-range in nature, may play a role in 3CLpro catalysis. relative activity was correlated with scales for side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and -helix and -sheet propensities of substituting residues. significant correlations with p-value0.01 were bolded and marked with asterisks. the relative activity also correlated well with the hydrophobicity of substituting residues. the relative activity correlated well with the hydrophobicity of substituting residues (r = 0.573, p = 0.008) correlation was more evident when we excluded residues with side chain volume >80 3 from the analysis. the relative activity is directly proportional to the hydrophobicity of the substituting residues. no observable cleavage was detected for charged residues (Arg, Asp, Glu and Lys) the most favorite residue at P2 position was Leu (1.000.08), followed by Met (0.680.06) and Phe (0.420.05). -branched residues like Ile (0.130.01) and Val (0.090.01) were less preferred, although their hydrophobicity is similar to that of Leu. amide group of P1-Gln of the WT substrate sequence (thin stick) forms hydrogen-bonds with the N2 atom of His163 and the backbone carbonyl group of Phe140. the rotamer of P1-His was selected to avoid steric hindrance. combining preferred residues generate \u2018Super-active\u2019 substrate sequences. substitutions to Phe, Thr and Val resulted in significant increases in 3CLpro activity. three variants with double-substitution resulted in best substrate sequence, TVRLQSGF. 2.110.26, 1.870.19, 1.800.17, 2.100.34, 2.840.25 and 2.710.29 respectively. both studies showed that substitutions at P5 position resulted in substrate variants with activity higher than that for WT. a close inspection of their models revealed that such binding mode of P1-His requires structural changes of the backbone atoms of the P1 residue. the structural changes may be accommodated in their tetrapeptide substrates, which lack residues beyond P1' position that may restrict the backbone conformation of the substrate. however, we argue that for the protein substrate used in our study, it is likely that the backbone conformation of the substrate will be held. our results suggest the existence of a strong structure-activity relationship between 3CLpro and its substrates. the substrate specificity profiled in this study can be used as a benchmark for better computational simulation for 3CLpro-substrate/inhibitor interaction. coding sequence of 3CLpro was amplified by polymerase chain reaction based on strain CUHK-Su10 sequence. a factor Xa cleavage sequence was present between 3CLpro and the tag for subsequent removal of the tag by factor Xa digestion. 198 mutations were introduced at P5 to P3' positions by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) the protein substrate expression was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by shaking of culture at 22\u00b0C overnight. 3CLpro coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. a factor Xa cleavage sequence was present between 3CLpro and the tag for subsequent removal of the tag by factor Xa digestion. the protease was finally purified by G75 size exclusion. 198 mutations were introduced at P5 to P3' positions by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) the protein substrate expression was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by shaking of culture at 22\u00b0C overnight. the relative activity was correlated with various structural properties of substituting residues, including side chain volume [20], hydrophobicity [21], and -helix and -sheet propensities [22] (Table S2)."}
