{"summary": "medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most common fatty acid disorder arising from mutations in the ACADM gene (MIM #607008). in the absence of catabolic stress individuals with MCADD are mostly asymptomatic, but intercurrent illness or prolonged fasting may lead to episodes of coma with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic dysfunction. the current number of 81 different ACADM mutations is so far unknown. 80% of these mutations are missense or small insertions/deletions. novel genotypes identified in NBS are associated with risk of sudden death. subunit consisting of three structural domains, the N-terminal -domain (DN), the middle -domain (D), and the C-terminal -domain (DC). the MCAD enzyme contains the highest affinity for octanoyl-CoA, and contains a FAD moiety as catalytic redox factor. p.Ala52Val, p.Tyr67His, p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, p.Lys329Glu, p.Arg334Lys, and p.Arg413Ser were grouped according to the localization of the respective amino acid side-chain replacement within the three structural domains of the MCAD protein. nucleotide +1 is the A of the ATG-translation initiation codon. amino acid numbering starts at codon 26 with the first 25 amino acids forming a mitochondrial targeting peptide. cDNA of the human ACADM gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pMALc2X (NEB) encoding an N-terminal MBP (maltose-binding protein) and a Factor Xa cleavage site. ACADM mutations were constructed by using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. phenylpropionyl-CoA, 1 mM ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate, pH 8.0. final protein concentration in the assay was 0.02 mg protein/ml. prokaryotic expression and purification were performed as previously described. the isolated tetrameric fusion proteins were pooled and incubated with Factor Xa (Novagen) for 12 hours at 4 \u00b0C to cleave off the MBP tag using a protease to protein ratio of 120 (U g) the concentration of the isolated tetrameric fraction was determined using the fluorescent dye binding Quant-iT assay (Invitrogen) intrainsic FAD fluorescence and binding of the hydrophobic dye 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid (ANS, Sigma-Aldrich) to surface exposed hydrophobic groups was co-monitored (multiwavelength program) during heat-induced denaturation experiments in the temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C/min. thermal inactivation experiments were performed using a ferrocenium-based spectrophotometric assay [24]. MCAD protein diluted in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.6 supplemented with 0.1 mM EDTA was incubated at five different temperatures in the range from 32 \u00b0C to 44 \u00b0C. spectroscopy, ANS-fluorescence or intrinsic FAD-fluorescence reflecting secondary structure, tertiary structure, and structural integrity with no stress applied. a numerical score was assigned to each of the experimental data with values ranging from 9 (native state) to 1 (non-native state) cDNA a Precursor protein (Trivial name) c.155C>T p.Ala52Val A52V p.Ala27Val A27V c.199T>C p.Tyr67His Y67H p.Tyr133His Y133H c.616C>T p.Arg206Cys R206C p.Arg181Cys R181C c.797A amino acid numbering starts at codon 26 with the first 25 amino acids forming a mitochondrial targeting peptide. cDNA of the human ACADM gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pMALc2X (NEB) encoding an N-terminal MBP (maltose-binding protein) and a Factor Xa cleavage site. g/ml digitonin and proteinase inhibitors were kept at -80\u00b0C. supernatants were kept at -80\u00b0C until being used for the activity assay. equilibrated with column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT), unbound proteins were washed out and MBP fusion proteins were eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 10 mM maltose. the isolated tetrameric fusion proteins were pooled and incubated with Factor Xa (Novagen) for 12 hours at ANS and FAD differential scanning fluorimetry were performed on a cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled Peltier multicell holder. changes in ANS fluorescence emission were detected at 450 nm (excitation at 395 nm, 5.0/10.0 nm slit widths) samples contained 0.08 g/l protein diluted in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.0 and 200 mM NaCl. the increase in turbidity was monitored in the temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C/min. the parameter kinetic stability (x-axis) represents the activation energy (EA) as a measure of the threshold from the active to the non-active protein upon application of thermal stress. a numerical score was assigned to each of the experimental data with values ranging from 9 (native state) to 1 (non-native state) the mature MCAD protein is shown and numbering of side chains refers to the primary sequence after cleavage of an N-terminal 25 amino acids mitochondrial targeting peptide. side chains, FAD cofactor (yellow) and the substrate analogue 3-thiaoctanoyl-CoA (orange) are shown as stick models. p.Arg413Ser is a kinetic variant with a substrate affinity reduced by two orders of magnitude resulting in a catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of 1.7 compared to that of the wild-type of 100. the relative composition of secondary structure elements was monitored by CD scans recorded in far-UV light between 190 and 260 nm. the spectra showed typical secondary structure characteristics of proteins with predominating -helical content. the spectra showed typical secondary structure characteristics of proteins with predominating -helical content. p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, and p.Asp266Gly showed similar ground-state fluorescence at ambient temperature as the wild-type. p.Tyr158His showed the most pronounced changes with an increase by 15-fold. p.Tyr67His and p.Lys329Glu had a particular impact on the secondary protein structure. partial unfolding probing global hydrophobicity was most pronounced for mutations mapping to D. mutations mapping to D are associated with accelerated heat-induced unfolding. p.Arg413Ser and p.Ala52Val showed the most pronounced shift (Tm1/2 52.0 \u00b0C), the variants p.Tyr67His, p.Arg334Lys, and p.Asp266Gly were in the medium range. p.Lys329Glu was the most stable variant (Tm1/2 54.0 \u00b0C) data are grouped according to the domain affected by mutations (DN, N-terminal -helical domain; D, -sheet domain; DC, C-terminal -helical domain) 0 represents the native state and 1 the unfolded state. the variant p.Lys329Glu was associated with a shift of the FAD fluorescence curve to higher release temperatures (Tm1/2 59.0 \u00b0C) the variant p.Ala52Val, p.Arg206Cys, p.Tyr158His showed the most pronounced alteration with a Tm1/2 of 12 \u00b0C. aturation curves revealed a subtle biphasic transition with a different slope in the low temperature range between 45 \u00b0C and 53 \u00b0C for the wild-type (Tm1/2 56.2 \u00b0C) p.Tyr158His variant revealed a marked shift in transition and a steeper slope than all other mutations, reflecting the most pronounced destabilization of the protein (Tm1/2 44.9 \u00b0C) mutations mapping to D showed the most distinct alterations affecting all parameters tested. p.Ala52Val of DN was associated with early loss of FAD binding. the DC variant p.Arg413Ser displayed a marked left-shift of the low-temperature range unfolding transition. intensity of scattered light as a function of increasing temperature was determined at 335 nm (excitation 330 nm) for variants arising from mutations mapping to the N-terminal -domain (DN), variants arising from mutations mapping to the middle -domain (D) and variants with amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal -domain (DC) kinetics of thermal inactivation experiments probing dynamics of heat-induced loss of function. wild-type and variant MCAD proteins were incubated at indicated temperatures. residual activity was plotted as a function of incubation time. mutants p.Ala52Val and p.Arg334Lys were assigned an intermediate position between p.Tyr67His and wild-type with respect to native-state conformation. p.Ala52Val showed a slightly reduced thermal stability and both variants presented with equal or higher thermal stability as compared to wild-type. Arg309 are positioned at the subunit interface inside the tetramer. all other side chains (Tyr42, Arg181, Asp241, Arg388) are surface-exposed. only the acyl-moiety of the substrate is buried in the substrate-binding cleft. p.Ala52Val, p.Tyr67His, and p.Arg334Lys showed high residual activity. p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, and p.Arg413Ser showed activity between 21 and 34%. a decrease in the relative amount of -helical structures resulted in a higher share of -strands. a decrease in the relative amount of -helical structures resulted in a higher share of -strands. the two other mutations mapping to DC showed the same phenomenon. p.Ala52Val p.Tyr67His p.Arg206Cys p.Asp266Gly p.Lys329Glu p.Arg334Lys p.Arg413Ser Helix 41 39 34 42 40 38 35 36 36 Antiparallel 2 2 5 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 Parallel 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 Beta-Turn 15 15 16 15 15 15 16 16 16 Random Coil p.Tyr158His showed the most pronounced alterations with an increase in FAD fluorescence by 3-fold. the impact of the remaining mutations including p.Lys329Glu was less pronounced for mutations mapping to D. p.Tyr158His was by far the most instable variant with a marked shift to lower temperatures and a Tm1/2 deviation of 12 \u00b0C. p.Arg206Cys also showed a reduced stability with a decrease in Tm1/2 by 6.5 \u00b0C. thermal stress-induced denaturation monitored by ANS-DSF probing global unfolding. unfolding profiles of wild-type and variant MCAD were determined as changes in ANS fluorescence emission at 450 nm (excitation 395 nm) p.Asp266Gly 53.5 51.4 0.70 56.4 0.70 p.Lys329Glu 54.0 55.1 0.29 59.0 0.29 p.Arg413Ser 52.0 52.1 0.52 56.1 0.52 a Three denaturation profiles were combined to calculate one value for Tm1/2. none of the variants showed marked changes in the shape of the denaturation curves. Tm1/2 of 12 \u00b0C (Table 3) correlating well with the shift in Tm1/2 observed in CD-spectroscopy experiments. the amino acid residue affected by this mutation is an essential part of the active site directly interacting with the FAD cofactor [27] ANS-DSF is an excellent means to monitor global thermal unfolding events [16], [28]\u2013[30]. mutations mapping to DN induced a slight shift of the onset of aggregation to lower temperatures resulting in curves indicative for a. mutations mapping to DN induced a slight shift of the onset of aggregation to lower temperatures. p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly showed the most distinct alterations. the pattern of aggregation for mutations mapping to DC was moderately left-shifted and comparable to that observed in DN. Arrhenius plots reflect distinct activation energies (EA) for conversion of MCAD variants from an active conformational state into an inactivated and potentially non-native state. p.Ala52Val and p.Tyr67His showed EA at wild-type level. p.Ala52Val and p.Arg334Lys were assigned an intermediate position between p.Tyr67His and wild-type with respect to native-state conformation. p.Ala52Val and p.Arg334Lys were assigned an intermediate position between p.Tyr67His and wild-type. p.Lys329Glu, the classical severe mutation, and p.Tyr67His, discussed to be a particularly mild mutation, did not constitute the edges of the plot. some variants showed more unfavorable structural properties than p.Lys329Glu and others being even less affected than p.Tyr67His. a recent study established risk stratification based on residual MCAD enzyme activity obtained from patient blood cells. an enzyme activity of less than 1% is associated with an increased risk of fatal neonatal presentation and enzyme activities below 10% enhance the risk of hypoglycemia [41]. however, reported enzyme activities linked to single mutations vary over a wide range. the polyPhen-2 polymorphism phenotyping tool predicts the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on structure and function of a human protein. Mutations p.Arg206Cys and p.Arg413Ser were scored 0.999 and classified as probably damaging. but a score of 0.000 for p.Asp266Gly suggested a benign structural phenotype. mutations p.Tyr67His and p.Lys329Glu did not constitute the phenotypic extremes of the panel of mutations analyzed. the group associated with mild structural deteriorations comprised the wild-type protein and p.Tyr67His as well as p.Ala52Val and p.Arg334Lys. mutation p.Tyr158His mapping to the core of the MCAD monomer induced the most profound alterations. mutations p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, and p.Arg413Ser showed molecular phenotypes comparable to those induced by p.Lys329Glu. p.Ala52Val (Ala27 in the mature protein) is in apparent conflict with the loss in enzymatic function observed. the side chain 27 is not in close proximity to the active site but ala27 maps to the conjunction of two -helices and its replacement by valine is likely to displace the far N-termini that exhibit mutual side chain interactions. protein structure analysis is considered in conjunction with functional parameters. the central -domain is particularly prone to conformational derangement and destabilization. the clinical observation of metabolic decompensation being considerably aggravated with fever has led to the assumption that the patient\u2019s temperature has impact on the molecular phenotype.
