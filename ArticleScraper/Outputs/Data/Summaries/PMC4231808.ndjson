{"summary": "maternal antibodies (MatAb) can have life-saving disease-sparing effects in a variety of neonatal infections. this has been demonstrated in epidemiological and laboratory studies of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), the leading cause of viral pneumonia in calves (2\u20134) there is increasing interest in vaccinating early in calfhood. calves were fed 2.1 L of a reconstituted commercial colostrum replacement product. all calves were given 1.5 mL of tulathromycin (Draxxin); 2 mL of a modified-live combination bovine coronavirus and bovine rotavirus vaccine. BRSV challenge inoculum consisted of lung wash obtained from a newborn calf infected with BRSV (Asquith strain; 17) the lung wash was confirmed negative for bacterial contamination, mycoplasma sp., and BHV-1, BPIV-3, and bovine viral diarrhea viruses by use of standard diagnostic methods (16,17) clinical assessment Calves were observed for clinical signs as previously described. 2 = 65 to 80 (BPM); 3 = 81 (BPM) Dyspnea 0 = normal, 1 = mild \u2014 short and rapid. 2 = moderate \u2014 labored, abdominal, 3 = severe \u2014 very labored, grunting Cough. experimental design Three- to 9-day-old seropositive calves were randomized into 2 groups. 17 calves (vaccinates) were given the 5-way commercial vaccine subcutaneously in the right cervical area. 17 (controls) were given the 3 way commercial vaccine. the groups were housed in alternate individual pens in the same air space in a calf barn. a maximum clinical score and the proportion of days alive that a calf had a maximum clinical score of 1 were also determined for each calf. differences in mortality rates between the groups were assessed using a Pearson Chi-square test. vaccines containing modified-live BRSV, bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPIV-3), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus BVDV were reared as previously described. BRSV challenge inoculum consisted of lung wash obtained from a newborn calf infected with BRSV (Asquith strain; 17) calves were euthanized immediately if they were observed with severe respiratory distress, for example, pronounced open-mouthed, labored breathing. if they were severely depressed and recumbent with total reluctance to rise, or if they had a PaO2 45 mmHg. these criteria were consistent with Canadian Council of Animal Care guidelines. the respiratory tract of each calf was harvested and analyzed for percentage of pneumonic tissue as previously described. BRSV neutralization tests, BRSV-specific IgG ELISAs for serum and colostral antibodies and a BRSV-specific IgA ELISA for nasal secretions were performed. bulizers were placed equidistant approximately 1.8 m off the floor of the trailer. after approximately 30 min in the sealed trailer, the calves were removed from the trailer and maintained as a single group in 1 large covered pen. data analysis Clinical and laboratory outcome variables were stratified by experimental group (i.e., controls and vaccinates) results Clinical signs and mortality One control calf required euthanasia on day 51 after vaccination due to severe hemorrhagic enterocolitis (coccidiosis), but was free of respiratory disease. there were no significant differences between the groups in any of the clinical parameters measured, including the total clinical scores. vaccinated calves had a median PaO2 concentration of 61 mmHg (range: 41 to 75 mmHg), whereas control calves had a median of 57 mmHg (range: 42 to 71 mmHg). vaccinated calves had extensive pneumonic lesions typical of acute BRSV infection. there were no significant associations between the groups in BRSV-specific IgG or IgA, or virus neutralizing antibodies at any time point, and no anamnestic responses after challenge. there were no significant associations between post-challenge serum IgG (P = 0.90) or nasal swab IgA (P = 0.19) antibody responses and percent pneumonic lung lesions. a control calf required euthanasia on day 51 after vaccination due to severe hemorrhagic enterocolitis (coccidiosis), but was free of respiratory disease. there were no significant differences between the groups in any of the clinical parameters measured, including the total clinical scores. calves in both groups had extensive pneumonic lesions typical of acute BRSV infection. the median percent of lung affected in the vaccinate group was 33%. the vaccinate group had a significantly lower percentage of lung affected by pneumonic lesions than the control group. significant associations between post-challenge serum IgG (P = 0.90) or nasal swab IgA (P = 0.19) antibody responses and percent pneumonic lung lesions. no significant associations between blood oxygen concentrations and post-challenge serum IgG (P = 0.82) or IgA (P = 0.51) antibody responses. no anamnestic antibody (B lymphocyte) or cytokine (T-helper lymphocyte) responses after exposure to BRSV in neonatal calves parenterally vaccinated. previous studies support the argument that the observed \u201cblocking\u201d was a maternal antibody, and not a vaccine effect. matAb ratio at the time of vaccination (25) could occur in a group of similarly aged calves with variable passive transfer. it has been suggested that maternally derived VN antibody must decline to between 1:8 and 1:16 to allow at least 90% of calves to respond to a dose of modified-live BRSV by 28 days after vaccination. but that study did not examine T-cell responses or responses to challenge in vaccinated calves. inactivated BRSV antigens in micelle-like immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs) stimulate antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses that confer a significant reduction in clinical disease and pulmonary pathology in young (2 to 7-week-old) calves with MatAb (27) this technology is an attractive alternative to conventional inactivated vaccines."}
