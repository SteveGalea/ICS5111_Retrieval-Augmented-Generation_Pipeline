{"summary": "canine rabies is a viral zoonosis caused by negative-stranded RNA viruses from the genus Lyssavirus. domestic dog vaccination provides a cost-effective approach to the prevention and elimination of human rabies deaths. the majority of human cases (>90%) result from the bites of rabid domestic dogs [2] and occur in regions where domestic dogs are the principal maintenance host. recent successes have been demonstrated in many parts of central and south America, where canine rabies has been brought under control through large-scale, synchronized mass dog vaccination campaigns. reports of disease burden; only recent recognition of rabies as a neglected tropical disease; statements by doctors and health workers; WHO (up until 2007) I-VI* EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS Abundance of wild animals and uncertainties about the required levels of vaccination coverage. hospital records of animal-bite injuries compiled from northwest Tanzania were used as primary data sources. these data informed a probability decision tree model for a national disease burden evaluation [7], which has since been adapted for global estimates of human rabies deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to rabies. there is not enough evidence to define rabies control as a priority. there is not enough evidence to define rabies control as a priority. there is not enough evidence to define rabies control as a priority. misdiagnosis was highlighted by a study of childhood encephalitis in Malawi. 3/26 (11.5%) cases initially diagnosed as cerebral malaria were confirmed as rabies through post-mortem tests. incidence in africa is about 100 times higher than officially reported, with 24,000 deaths in Africa each year. annual human deaths for a range of zoonoses and global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) scores for neglected zoonoses. top figure - Numbers of human deaths per year for rabies compared with peak annual deaths from selected epidemic zoonoses. most deaths occur in children and therefore a greater number of years of life are lost. rabies causes substantial'morbidity' as a direct result of injuries inflicted by rabid animals. for every human rabies death there are typically more than ten other rabid animal-bite victims who do not develop signs of rabies. the severity of wounds has not yet been quantified. additional economic losses relate to livestock losses derived from an incidence of 5 deaths/100,000 cattle estimated to cost $12.3 million annually in Africa and Asia. rabies introduced from sympatric domestic dog populations is also recognized as a major threat to endangered african wild dogs and Ethiopian wolves. domestic dogs are the only maintenance population in such a species-rich community. evidence suggests elimination of canine rabies through domestic dog vaccination is a realistic possibility. jackal species (Canis mesomelas and C. adustus) may maintain the canid variant in specific geographic loci in south africa and Zimbabwe. rabies elimination through dog vaccination alone and wildlife rabies control strategies may need to be considered in specific locations. a critical proportion of the population must be protected (Pcrit) to eliminate infection. this threshold can be calculated from the basic reproductive number (R0), defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population.

Poor households face difficulties raising funds. shortages of PEP, which are frequent in much of Africa, further increase costs as bite victims are forced to travel to multiple centres to obtain treatment. human rabies deaths estimate incidence in africa is 100 times higher than officially reported, with 24,000 deaths in Africa each year [3],[7]. a multi-centric study from India reported 18,500 human rabies deaths per year [24], consistent with model outputs of 19,700 deaths for India [3]. global DALY scores for neglected tropical diseases reported in LXIV and LVII. most deaths occur in children and therefore a greater number of years of life are lost. rabies DALY burden is attributed to deaths rather than morbidity. the severity of wounds has not yet been quantified, but case-history interviews suggest that injuries often involve multiple, penetrating wounds that require medical treatment. cost of PEP arise directly from anti-rabies vaccines and from high indirect (patient-borne) costs associated with travel. more than 87% of households with dog bite victims feared a bite from a suspected rabid animal more than malaria. in rural Tanzania, >87% of households with dog bite victims feared a bite from a suspected rabid animal more than malaria. clinical rabies is invariably fatal and malaria treatment is generally affordable. domestic dogs are the only maintenance population in such a species-rich community. phylogenetic data showed only a single southern africa canid-associated variant (Africa 1b) circulating among different hosts. cross-species transmission events from domestic dogs resulted in only relatively short-lived chains of transmission in wildlife. theory suggests that R0 increases with population density and thus higher coverage will be needed in higher density populations. in populations with rapid turnover (such as those in many African countries) at least 60% of the population must be vaccinated during annual campaigns to prevent coverage falling below Pcrit between campaigns. population from 1992 census data reported in XXXVI Khartoum state Sudan 2000 2,946 91,000 3.24 L National Swaziland 1994\u20131998 57,204

fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. other simple field-diagnostics that allow rapid screening, including enzyme immunoassays [76], dot blot enzyme immunoassays [77] and lateral-flow immunodiagnostic test kits [78],[79] are being evaluated. in rural Tanzania, dog vaccination campaigns led to a rapid and dramatic decline in demand for costly human PEP [14] in pastoral communities, vaccination reduced rabies incidence, but has now resulted in a complete absence of exposures reported in local hospitals for over two years. rabies is an important disease that exerts a substantial burden on human and animal health, local and national economies and wildlife conservation. domestic dogs are the sole population responsible for rabies maintenance and main source of infection for humans throughout most of Africa and Asia. elimination of rabies through domestic dog vaccination is epidemiologically feasible, (4) the vast majority of domestic dog populations across sub-Saharan Africa are accessible for vaccination. animal-bite injury data from hospitals are an easily accessible source of epidemiological information. increasing availability of communication infrastructure through mobile phone network access in remote areas could enhance surveillance by allowing real-time reporting. cost of effective dog vaccination campaigns beyond budget of veterinary services. arrows mark the end of successive dog vaccination campaigns. large-scale campaigns can therefore translate into human lives and economic savings through reduced demand for PEP. cost per dog vaccinated is generally estimated to be low. be addressed by engaging communities through education and awareness programs. new diagnostic and surveillance approaches will help evaluate the impact of interventions and focus efforts towards elimination. dog rabies control is affordable, but is likely to require intersectoral approaches for sustainable programmes."}
