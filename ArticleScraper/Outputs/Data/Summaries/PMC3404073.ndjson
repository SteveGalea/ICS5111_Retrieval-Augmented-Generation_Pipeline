{"summary": "epidemic behavior has been observed in plague [4], cholera [5], pertussis [6] and more recently Hepatitis E. the recent outbreak of Hepatitis E in northern Uganda has left many dead and a number of infectives that continue to spread the infection. the incidence of HAV infections during P. falciparum malaria was found to be 6.3 times higher than the cumulative incidence of HAV. there is also evidence both for [13], [14] and against [15], [16] an association between Hepatitis B viruses and malaria. in kitgum district Uganda, most people live in internally displaced camps. the number of latrines in the area is not enough for the entire population. in the kitgum region, few people have access to clean bore hole water. (5) Equations (1) to (5) provide a system of equations defining the transmission of HEV between a contaminated environment and humans. this means that the environment reaches a steady-state before the humans. the quasi-stationary-state (QSS) for c can be obtained from equation (1) to give (6) This steady state is substituted in the human equations to give a reduced system of equations. using a non-linear differential equation fitting tool, we run the model again. this implies that the initial number of infectives,. Substituting in known parameter values for the Kitgum region, gives an estimated value. this implies that the initial number of infectives,. in kitgum, 2,316 cases of malaria were reported out of a total population of 28,045 [7] 8.3% of the population are infected with malaria at any time. recovery rate for malaria is per week. the stability of this equilibrium state would depend on the sign of the real part, a. if both are positive, the steady state is an unstable node; if both are negative, it is a stable node. if one of them is positive, the steady state is a saddle point. all of these values fall on line corresponding to between 2.19\u20132.48. this relationship follows the same curve as the analytical results in Figure 3a. we now assume that in the absence of malaria, Hepatitis E has and does not spread. DALY is defined as an indicator to quantify the burden of premature mortality and disability for major diseases or disease groups. it can be used across cultures to measure health gaps as opposed to health expectancies, and the difference between a current and an ideal situation where everyone lives up to the age of the standard life expectancy. the DALY is an incidence-based measure, rather than a prevalence-based measure. to estimate the net present value of years of life lost, a time discount rate to years of life lost in the future is applied to adjust both costs and health outcomes. the total number of deaths due to Hepatitis E in Kitgum as of June 28 2009 were 160. DALY = YLL+YLD \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DALY DALY/1000 The calculation of the DALY using parameters from Kitgum. first, it is assumed that if the people had the necessary and sufficient number of latrines in addition to safe drinking, then the outbreak would not have occurred. then, the costs of constructing the required latrines and boreholes are computed. latrines should be increased to 17.5%: 4,908, (3,870 extra), 1 for 6 people. boreholes should be increased to 18.1%, a total of 234, or 1 bore hole per 26 households. the average cost of digging and constructing a basic pit latrine is approximately USD 250.00. therefore, the cost per disability adjusted life year averted in Kitgum, in the case of Hepatitis E is 869,250/7,066 = USD 123.00. let us now consider the case of education to the camp dwellers. in kitgum district Uganda, most people live in internally displaced camps. the number of latrines in the area is not enough for the entire population. the rate of change of contamination c of the environment is given by (1) where is the transmission rate of HEV from the infected human to the environment. (5) Equations (1) to (5) provide a system of equations defining the transmission of HEV between a contaminated environment and humans. this means that the environment reaches a steady-state before the humans. the quasi-stationary-state (QSS) for c can be obtained from equation (1) to give (6) This steady state is then substituted in the human equations. a non-linear differential equation fitting tool, called the PottersWheel Toolbox, gives an estimated value. the fitted parameters estimate the basic reproduction number between 2.08- 2.39 with average 2.25. this value is similar to that found from the linear regression fitting to the kitgum outbreak. 8.3% of the population are infected with malaria at any time. recovery rate for malaria is per week, and thus we set. the stability of this equilibrium state would depend on the sign of the real part, a. if both are positive, the steady state is an unstable node; if both are negative, it is a stable node. if one of them is positive, the steady state is a saddle point. all of these values fall on line corresponding to between 2.19\u20132.48. this relationship follows the same curve as the analytical results in Figure 3a. malaria infected individuals were infected with Hepatitis E up to 16.9 times more than those not infected with malaria. DALY is defined as an indicator to quantify the burden of premature mortality and disability for major diseases or disease groups. it can be used across cultures to measure health gaps as opposed to health expectancies, and the difference between a current and an ideal situation where everyone lives up to the age of the standard life expectancy. xia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and vomiting, and fever and the disease may range in severity from sub-clinical to fulminant [35]. to calculate the YLD, we will set the disability weight to that for a diarrhea disease episode, (equal to 0.11, [33] in untreated or treated form. population P P/1,000 Averageage atdeath L YLL YLL/1,000 28,045 160 5.71 22 28 3,030.88 108.07 YLD \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Population I I /1000 D (years) DW YLD YLD /1000 28,045 9,449 336.92 2 0.11 4,035.29 143.89 DALY = YLL+YLD \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DALY DA boreholes should be increased from 23 to 230, that is, 17.7%, or 1 bore hole per 26 households. from the co-infection model, latrines should be increased to 17.5%: 4,908, (3,870 extra), 1 for 6 people. the average cost of digging and constructing a basic pit latrine is approximately USD 250.00. therefore, the cost per disability adjusted life year averted in Kitgum, in the case of hepatitis E is 869,250/7,066 = USD 123.00. we should consider education to the camp dwellers. this paper provides a case study of how a simple epidemic model can be fit to such an outbreak disease. two fitting methods have been used; the first an analytical method and the other based on a freely available fitting tool. the necessary levels of latrine and bore hole coverages needed to eradicate the epidemic are both around 16 to 18%."}
