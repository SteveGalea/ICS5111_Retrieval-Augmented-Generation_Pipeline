{"summary": "LF is an acute haemorrhagic viral infection, caused by an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the Arenaviridae family with a clear zoonotic origin. the number of reported cases reaches about a thousand per year including a few hundreds of deaths. observed LF incidence exhibits a strong seasonal component. the number of reported cases is likely to rise in the first two to three months of the year. this phenomenon can be captured by implementing a time-varied probability of exposure in our model. unified epidemiological model consists of two parts. the first part describes the process of generating the incidence data in humans. the second part employs the so-called susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model. 5% credible interval (CrI): 10.7\u201315.0) and a standard deviation of 4.6 days (CrI: 2.8\u20136.6) for the incubation period, and a mean of 13.8 days (CrI: 10.8\u201317.0) and a standard deviation of 7.6 days (CrI: 5.0\u201310.6) for the time from illness onset to death (electronic supplementary material, appendix A and figure S1). an analogous model with a single (constant) exposure rate yielded a less plausible fit to the data. we analysed whether a seasonal increase in the number of infected rodents can solely explain the increase in the incidence of LF infections in humans. only the rainfall seasonal pattern was significantly correlated with the seasonal incidence of LF in humans. this was confirmed by the start and end times of the high/low exposure periods. this could be the change in seasons and seasonal migration or a change in behaviour of the rodents. study analysed surveillance-based incidence data of LF in nigeria from 2016 to 2018. the high-risk period spanned the last month of the year to the second to third month of the year. the relative risk of acquiring LF infection was five times greater than during the rest of the year. similar findings have been reported for many other diseases, not only for those of an epizootic nature, but also for insect-vectored plant diseases [26]. this points to rather general applicability of our approach that may frame the spillovers of other pathogens with two epizootic transmission routes. we used only the counts of suspected cases that included both laboratory-confirmed cases and cases that tested negative. but the available dataset indicates that the majority of suspected cases involved specimens that tested negative. this becomes especially evident in low-risk exposure periods. we did not account for temporal changes in the surveillance system and improvements in laboratory facilities for the detection of LF. the chosen reference point was set to coordinates 6.75\u00b0 N 6.25\u00b0 E, located in Edo state, Nigeria. it was also marked as highly hazardous for LF transmission owing to an average annual rainfall of 1786 mm [22]. we specified a total exposure rate in weeks w by a variable ew. this could be written as the sum of the two rates: ew = aw + hw, where aw and hw are weekly exposure rates via animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission routes. each newly reported non-fatal case was dealt with as a result of previous exposure delayed by the length of the incubation period. this implied a Poisson process with the expected number of new cases iw at week w to be a result of the convolution of the exposure rate a and distribution of the incubation period f. the second likelihood function for describing the number of deaths was derived from the binomial sampling process. we first defined the model parameters by using a Bayesian approach and performing MCMC iterations. the likelihood L was maximized, respectively, to each parameter in by equating its first partial derivatives to zero. we used an SIR model (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 and more details in appendix C) the birth rate of rodents was defined by a periodic birth pulse function. the threshold of acceptance was chosen to be 0.01. (a) data collection Data were routinely collected from the weekly epidemiological report of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the period from 2016/week 4 to 2018/week 30. the extracted counts included newly suspected weekly cases for both positively and negatively testing specimens. we fitted the distributions of the incubation period f and the time from illness onset to death h to gamma distributions. the analysed dataset included the cases and transmission events during a nosocomial outbreak in the Evangel Hospital in Jos, Nigeria, in 1970. the number of described cases was 23 with probable time intervals of exposure, the date of illness onset and the date of death. the incidence of infections is likely to rise in the first two to three months of each calendar year. we accounted for this by incorporating seasonal variations in the weekly exposure rate a w c as a function of the calendar week wc (1 wc 52) LF deaths result from exposure to the virus in previous weeks postponed by a probabilistically distributed time period between the exposure event and death. the expected number of fatal cases dw in week w was determined by a convolution of the exposure rate a and distribution g, multiplied by the risk of death. the likelihood function for describing the total number of reports (i.e. cases plus deaths) was derived from the binomial sampling process: L d ( | i we first defined the model parameters by using a Bayesian approach and performing MCMC iterations. we used the maximum-likelihood method to obtain point estimates. the likelihood L was maximized to each parameter in by equating its first partial derivatives to zero. we shifted the dynamics fitted to the Tanzania data by a time lag equal to the difference between the starting times of the dry season in the two countries. we then implemented known measurements of the LF prevalence in rodents captured in the dry and rainy seasons separately. we accounted for a non-zero probability of vertical transmission of the virus and its antibodies, as previously observed in rodents. funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, preparation of the manuscript or the decision to publish."}
