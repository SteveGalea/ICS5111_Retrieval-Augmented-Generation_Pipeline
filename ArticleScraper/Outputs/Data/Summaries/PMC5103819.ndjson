{"summary": "the inclusion of behavior in epidemiological modeling introduces numerous complications and involves fields of research outside the biological sciences. we use the term \u2018behavioral epidemiology\u2019 to broadly refer to all epidemiological approaches that incorporate human behavior. the SPIR model is an epidemiological model that couples individual behavioral decisions with an extension of the SIR model. in this model agents that are vulnerable to infection may be in one of two states, susceptible or prophylactic, which is determined by their behavior. we use a rational choice model to represent individual behavioral decisions. the disease dynamics model reproduces the dynamics of the infectious disease in a constant population of N agents. each agent can be in one of four states: Susceptible (S), Prophylactic (P), Infectious (I) or Recovered (R). the difference between agents in states S and P is that the latter engage in non-prophylactic behavior and do not implement any measure to prevent infection. the adoption of prophylactic behavior, however, imposes costs on individuals that may prevent them from engaging in such g is the recovery probability; is the reduction in transmission probability when an agent adopts prophylactic behavior that linearly relates bS and bP, i.e., bP = bS; d is the behavioral decision making probability; and W(i) is an indicator function returning value 1 when the utility of being prophylactic is greater than the utility of being susceptible. state Y assuming they decide to adopt state X (i.e., DX), where Y S, P, I, R and X S, P. UX Utility for adopting state X, where X S, P. H Time into the future at which agents calculate their current utilities (i.e., planning horizon). agents\u2019 behavioral decision is reflected in the indicator function W(i) and they engage in the prophylactic behavior when W(i) = 1 (i.e., adopt state P) and the non-prophylactic behavior when W(i) = 0 (i.e., adopt state S) agents have probability g per time step of recovering. the parameter refers to the reduction in transmission rate when adopting prophylactic behavior. we convert between rates and probabilities using equations x = ln 1 y and y = 1 ex, where x and y are rate and probability values respectively. agents compute expected waiting times based on a censored geometric distribution. when their time in state I is over, they know they will move to state R where they will remain until time H. agents use the length of time they expect to spend in each state. the planning horizon serves to censor all waiting times greater than H, giving them value H. the expected time spent in state X can be expressed as E T X | D X = t = 0 H t f X 1 f X t + H 1 f X H, t = H 0, otherwise. the second parenthetical term compresses the expected time into the interval between E T X | D X and H. the agent calculates the expected time in state R by subtracting the expectations for X and I from H, E T R | D X = H E T X | D X E T I | D X. i is defined as the indicator function W i defined by W i = 1 for U S U P 0 otherwise (11) Distorting knowledge of i affects the epidemic dynamics. to achieve this, we replace i with i 1 in the calculation of utilities where serves as a distortion factor. agents in the infectious state I are infected and infective, while those in the recovered state R are immune to and do not transmit disease. the transition between states is captured with the state-transition diagram shown in Fig. 1. bP Probability that an agent in the susceptible or prophylactic state becomes infected upon interacting with an infectious agent. d Probability an agent in the susceptible or prophylactic state decides which behavior to engage in. agents have probability g per time step of making a behavioral decision to engage in prophylactic or non-prophylactic behavior. agents\u2019 behavioral decision is reflected in the indicator function W(i) and they engage in the prophylactic behavior when W(i) = 1 (i.e., adopt state P) d s d t = s i s W i + p 1 W i (1a) d p d t = s i + p 1 W i (1b) d i d t = s i + p 1 W i (1c) d r d t = i (1d) where s, p, i, and r are the proportion of susceptible, prophylactic, infectious, n 1 d Behavioral decision model assumes agents are self-interested and rational. the planning horizon is the time in the future over which agents calculate their utilities. agents assume that i will remain at its current value during the next H time steps. state uY, where Y S, P, I, R, and all agents are assumed to have the same set of payoff values. agents calculate the sum of the utility from now until time H. the expected time in state X is conditioned on TX because agents are rational. f X 1 is the expected time to remain in state X before moving to state I for an uncensored geometric with minimum value of zero. the second parenthetical term compresses the expected time into the interval between E T X | D X and H. agents assume a constant i which implies the best strategy now will remain the best strategy at all times during the epidemic. they assume a constant i which implies the best strategy now will remain the best strategy at all times during the epidemic. each agent can be in one of four states: Susceptible (S), Prophylactic (P), Infectious (I) or Recovered (R). the difference between agents in states S and P is that the latter engage in non-prophylactic behavior and do not implement any measure to prevent infection. the latter adopt prophylactic behavior which decreases their probability of being infected. Symbol Definition N Total number of agents in the population. bP Probability that an agent in the susceptible state becomes infected upon interacting with an infectious agent. agents calculate their current utilities (i.e., planning horizon) in each time step, three types of events occur: (1) interactions among agents and any infections that may result, (2) behavioral decisions to engage in prophylactic or non-prophylactic behavior, and (3) recoveries. only two types of interactions can change the state of an agent: S, I and P, I. agent-based model (ABM) is a useful tool for exploring the aggregated effects of individual decision making. a drawback of this model is that it requires simulations that can be computationally intensive. we convert between rates and probabilities using equations x = ln 1 y and y = 1 ex. one unit of continuous time in the ODE model corresponds to N time steps in the ABM. agents know the per time step payoff for each state uY, where Y S, P, I, R, and all agents are assumed to have the same set of payoff values. agents calculate the sum of the utility from now until time H under the two possible behavioral decisions. the expected time spent in state X can be expressed as E T X | D X = t = 0 H t f X 1 f X t + H 1 f X H. the second parenthetical term compresses the expectation to the interval [1, H] the agent calculates the expected time in state R by subtracting the expectations for X and I from H, E T R | D X = H E T X | D X E T I | D X. the agent then calculates the utility for the two possible behaviors using, U S = u S E T S | D S + u I E T I | D S + u R E T R | D S. i replaces i with i 1 in the calculation of utilities where serves as a distortion factor. when = 1, i is not distorted; when > 1, the agent perceives i to be above its real value and when 1 the opposite is true. results and analysis The SPIR model can be applied to a diverse range of infectious disease epidemics. a switching point is defined as the proportion of infectious agents beyond which it would be advantageous for an agent to switch from non-prophylactic to prophylactic behavior or vice-versa. we can visualize switching points by plotting the expected utility for the susceptible and prophylactic states as a function of the proportion of infectious agents. in region A, agents adopt prophylactic behavior above the reported proportion of infectious agents. in region C, agents adopt prophylactic behavior only if the proportion of infected agents is between the proportion of infectious agents represented by the color gradient and the proportion represented by the contour lines. for short planning horizons, the largest proportion of time is expected to be spent in the susceptible or prophylactic states. regions B correspond to the situation in which agents will adopt non-prophylactic or prophylactic behavior depending on the prevalence of the disease. case 3: uS > uR = uP > uI, and case 4: uP > uR > uI. changing the payoff for being recovered has a large effect on the agents\u2019 behavioral change in the cases of Disease 2. changing the payoff for being recovered has a large effect on the agents\u2019 behavioral change in the cases of Disease 1. the heat maps of behavioral change assume the following payoffs for uS, uP, uI, uR. % Protection corresponds to the percentage of protection obtained for adopting prophylactic behavior, (1 ) 100. analyzing the effects of the planning horizon H and the decision frequency on the dynamics of Disease 1 and Disease 2. both dynamics consider decision frequency = 0.01 for planning horizons 1, 30, 45, and 90. the effect is characterized by the decrease on the epidemic peak size and a prolonged duration of the epidemic. in other cases, increasing the planning horizon further may cause agents to never contemplate a change in their behavior. this occurs, for example, when H = 90 for Disease 2 (H = 30) risk perception Empirical evidence shows that humans change behavior and adopt costly preventative measures. this is especially true for harmful diseases with severe consequences to those being infected. despite the low level of recorded cases during the 2003 SARS outbreak in china, people in the city of Guangzhou avoided going outside. the distortion on disease prevalence makes agents engage in prophylactic behavior even when the chance of being infected is low. this affects the epidemic dynamics by reducing the epidemic peak size but prolonging the epidemic and generating multiple waves of infection. Figure 2C shows the situation in which the utilities cross twice. between the switching points the prophylactic state has the higher utility. the susceptible state has the higher utility on the margins. the utility of being in the susceptible or prophylactic state is never less than the prophylactic state regardless of disease prevalence. in the case of short planning horizons, agents do not have an incentive to adopt prophylactic behavior because they expect to get infected regardless of their behavior. the best strategy is to become infected and then recover in order to collect the recovered payoff as quickly as possible. region C corresponds to the situation in which two switching points exist instead of a single. agents adopt prophylactic behavior, while values outside this range drives agents to adopt non-prophylactic behavior. this is of particular interest because it shows that the adoption of prophylactic behavior is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease. disease recovery time for Disease 1 is large (Recovery Time = 65), but small for Disease 2 (Recovery Time = 8). agent expects to spend more time in the recovered state when considering Disease 2. heat maps of switching points under qualitatively different payoff relationships for Disease 1 and Disease 2. % Protection corresponds to the percentage of protection obtained for adopting prophylactic behavior, (1 ) 100. reducing the recovered payoff means that lower levels of prevalence will be sufficient for agents to change their behavior. reducing the recovered payoff means that lower levels of prevalence will be sufficient for agents to change their behavior. both dynamics consider decision frequency = 0.01 for planning horizons 1, 30, 45, and 90. both dynamics consider decision frequency = 0.01 for planning horizons 1, 30, 45, and 90. however, agents change behavior and thereby affect epidemic dynamics. Figure 6 shows the effects of different decision frequencies on the epidemic dynamics. this figure illustrates how increasing the decision frequency reduces the epidemic peak size while prolonging the epidemic. it additionally may generate multiple waves of infection for Disease 1. the distortion on disease prevalence makes agents engage in prophylactic behavior even when the chance of being infected is low. this affects the epidemic dynamics by reducing the epidemic peak size but prolonging the epidemic and generating multiple waves of infection. epidemic dynamics for different distortion factors show how increasing reduces the epidemic peak size, prolongs the epidemic and generates secondary waves of infection. Discussion Individuals acting in their own self-interest make behavioral decisions to reduce their likelihood of getting infected in response to an epidemic. the SPIR and Fenichel et al. models generate similar results. in the latter, agents optimize their contact rate by balancing the expected incremental benefits and costs of additional contacts. agents maintain a constant contact rate, yet adopt prophylactic behavior that reduces the chance of getting infected. Perra et al. (2011) and Del Valle, Mniszewski & Hyman (2013) also proposed an extension to the SIR model and included a new compartment that reduces the transmission rate between the susceptible and infectious states. a clear distinction between these models and the SPIR model is that their agents do not take into account the costs associated with moving between compartments. author Contributions Luis G.
