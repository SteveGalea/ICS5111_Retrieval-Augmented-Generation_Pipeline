{"summary": "osteoblasts and osteoclasts continuously remodel bone to maintain its mass. most therapies for osteoporosis that have been developed over the past 20 years target osteoclasts, decreasing their resorptive activity. administration of a parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces anabolic response in bone. osteoporosis is primarily a disease of the aging population. however, these studies were conducted in young adult animals. previous studies on older rats suggest that marrow ablation would be less osteo-inductive than in younger animals. 4\u20136 from each group were submitted to histomorphometric analysis or biomechanical testing using the three-point bending test. data are presented as mean SD. n = 8 for Control; n = 12 for all other groups. high-resolution radiographs of left operated and right unoperated femurs from baseline, control, and bone marrow-ablated (bmx) rats treated five days per week with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or parathyroid hormone (PTH) for 28 days. X-ray images are representative of each group. right femur baseline 13.0 1.3 936.1 80.9 14.0 2.1 Control 16.2 1.9 964.3 45.2 16.8 1.8 bmx + PBS 14.6 1.9 973.5 57.5 15.0 1.6 bmx + PTH 16.3 2.4 1013.5 75.1 16.0 1.6 2.2. biomechanical testing results from analysis of femoral shafts of left operated and right unoperated femurs from baseline, control and bone marrow-ablated rats. femurs were subjected to three-point bending to record the ultimate force, (b) the energy to failure of femurs, and (c) the stiffness. new bone formed in response to marrow ablation was relatively sparse four weeks after surgery in older rats. the intramedullary bone formed in response to marrow ablation followed by treatment with PTH is undergoing calcification. as in younger rats, such a signal was weak and diffuse in the marrow cavity of ablated shafts from rat that had received PBS. this signal was absent in shafts from baseline and control rats. ablated femurs from rats treated with PBS revealed mildly enhanced radiopacity compared with control rats. ablated femurs from rats treated with PBS revealed a highly intense radiopacity. ablated femurs showed a highly intense radiopacity compared with control rats. pQCT analysis revealed the additive effect of PTH and marrow ablation on the formation of new bone in these older rats. in rats treated with PTH, total bone density was higher in ablated shafts than in: contralateral non operated shafts; (ii) ablated shafts of rats that received PBS; (iii) shafts of control rats. 0.001 vs. bmx + PTH. n = 8 for Control; n = 12 for all other groups. left femur Baseline 12.8 1.3 934.5 78.5 13.8 Area (mm2) Left femur Baseline 12.8 1.3 934.5 78.5 13.8 2.0 Control 16.4 1.9 a 973.1 42.1 a 16.8 1.9 a bmx + PBS 15.2 2.2 996.0 62.0 15.2 1.7 marrow ablated group attributed to newly formed intramedullary bone. energy to failure of left operated femurs also increased by PTH. new bone induced by combined marrow ablation and PTH treatment can increase bone resistance to bending than PTH alone. the new bone formed in ablated femurs from rats treated with PTH was extremely abundant. higher magnification analysis of that new bone revealed its lining by active osteoblasts, and the presence of small osteocytic lacunae, indicating that the new bone was being actively formed. the intramedullary bone formed in response to marrow ablation followed by treatment with PTH is undergoing calcification. rats that underwent marrow ablation and were treated with PTH had significantly higher osteocalcin levels compared to control rats and rats that underwent marrow ablation. experimental rats were free of corona virus, sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Mycoplasma, and ecto- and endoparasites. all rats were free of corona virus, sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, mycoplasma, and ecto- and endoparasites. the distal femur was exposed by lateral luxation of the patella. a 1.0-mm-hole was drilled through the femoral intracondylar notch. an antimicrobial bristle brush was used to remove cells and debris from the bone marrow cavity. the marrow was then back-flushed by injection of 5 ml of normal saline solution into the femur using a syringe attached to both excised femurs from each rat were subjected to x-ray on a cranial-caudal view using a Kubtec unit (Fairfield, CT, USA) at 30 kV for four seconds. x-ray films were scanned using an Epson Perfection 4870. femurs from 4\u20136 rats per group were subjected to three-point bending. the anterior to posterior diameter at the midpoint of the femoral shaft was recorded using an electronic caliper. the span between the two lower supports was set at 14 mm. microscopy was performed using an IMT-2 Olympus microscope equipped with ultraviolet light (UV) and an OM-4 camera. blood was collected by cardiac puncture at the time of sacrifice. Statistical analysis Data represent the mean one standard deviation (SD) treatment groups were compared using the analysis of variance. x + PTH groups underwent bone marrow ablation for 28 days. the contralateral femur served as an unoperated control. rats were deeply anesthetized and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. the bone marrow cells were removed while keeping the structures intact. the bone structures were sutured with a 4-0 Vicryl. rats were injected subcutaneously with a 5-ml bolus of saline. femurs from two randomly selected rats from each group were scanned with a microCT scanner (MicroCT 40; Scanco, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) the anterior to posterior diameter at the midpoint of the femoral shaft was recorded using an electronic caliper. histology Femurs from 4-6 randomly chosen rats per group were dehydrated in ethanol series and embedded without decalcification in methyl methacrylate. sections were kept unstained or stained with Mason-Goldner trichrome. rapid and abundant bone formation in response to marrow ablation and PTH treatment also occurs in nine-month old rats. it is possible that aspiration of bone marrow at sites at risk for fracture, such as the hip, might lead to the transient formation of new bone in lieu of marrow in humans."}
