{"summary": "clinically, respiratory viral infections are often implicated as triggers of CRS flare-ups (2, 3) respiratory viral infections are often implicated as triggers of CRS flare-ups. some experimental studies have suggested an important role for viral pathogens during the exacerbation and ongoing inflammation in CRS (4\u20138) the prevalence of viral pathogens in CRS patients with no signs of acute viral infection was investigated in this prospective study using multiplex PCR assay. the respiratory virus infection rate in CRS patients was compared with that in control subjects. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) all adult participants and legally authorized representatives of children provided informed consent. nasal lavage and scrapes of the nasal epithelium were collected immediately after general anesthesia. RNA was extracted from 140 l of each respiratory sample using a QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) to synthesize cDNA, reverse transcription was performed using a RevertAid first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada), according to the manufacturer's instructions. coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocaviruses 1, 2, 3, and 4 were visualized by electrophoresis on agarose gel. the multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. patients with fungal sinusitis, current immunotherapy, aspirin desensitization, or cystic fibrosis were excluded from this study. the presence of sinusitis in the control group was ruled out based on their history, physical examination, plain sinus X-ray, and computed tomography (CT imaging) samples were collected from all participants from summer 2011 to spring 2012 for 8 months. sample size was approximately equally distributed over the months. mucosal scraping was found to be more sensitive than nasal lavage for viral detection. each cDNA was subjected to multiplex PCR using a Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit. 3 l of synthesized first-strand cDNA, 5 RV15 primer mix, 2 multiplex master mix and 3 l 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) solution were mixed. multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. target size in agarose gel (bp) RV15 ACE detection (set A) this study included 62 (55.9%) CRS patients with nasal polyps. there was no association of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and nasal polyps with respiratory virus detection rate or multiple virus detection. there was no statistically significant difference related to the age of the patients in which viruses were detected. in 56 (50.5%) of the nasal lavage samples from the 111 CRS patients and 14 (28.0%) of the control subjects, there were significant differences in the overall virus detection rates between the two groups. coinfections with >1 virus was detected in 27 (24.3%) of the CRS patients. the detection rates for influenza, RSV, coronavirus 229E and OC43, adenovirus, enterovirus, HMPV, and human bocavirus did not differ between the CRS and control groups. the detection rate in CRS patients is significantly greater than that in controls (P 0.01).

PCR analysis was positive for one or more respiratory viruses in 56 (50.5%) of the nasal lavage samples from the 111 CRS patients. there were significant differences in the overall virus detection rates between the two groups. the PCR analysis was positive for one or more respiratory viruses in 29 (26.1%) CRS samples. the detection rates for influenza, RSV, coronavirus 229E and OC43, adenovirus, enterovirus, and human bocavirus did not differ between the CRS and control groups. the detection rates for influenza, RSV, coronavirus 229E and OC43, adenovirus, enterovirus, HMPV, and human bocavirus did not differ between the CRS and control groups. the detection rate in CRS patients is significantly higher than that in controls (P 0.05). d The detection rate in CRS patients is significantly higher than that in controls (P 0.05). d The detection rate in CRS patients is significantly higher than that in controls (P 0.05). bocavirus 1 (1.0) 0 (0) 1 (1.0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (2.0) 1 (2.0) 0 a Considered positive if both lavage and scraping were positive. detection rate in CRS patients is significantly higher than that in controls. rhinovirus positive for 35 (31.4%) of the CRS group and 6 (12.0%) of the control group. rhinovirus was the only respiratory virus that has a significantly different detection rate in CRS patients and control subjects. a higher proportion of CRS patients had respiratory viruses in their nasal secretions and mucosae compared with non-CRS controls. rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus in lavage and mucosal scrape samples. rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus in lavage and mucosal scrape samples. rhinovirus RNA was found in 32.4% of children with asthma. similar outcomes have been reported in studies of asthmatic patients. rhinovirus may be important in pathogenesis of asthma (20) turbinate epithelial cells may better reflect sinus mucosa. turbinate epithelial cells may better reflect sinus mucosa. turbinate epithelia may better reflect sinus mucosa. the previous study reported that no respiratory viruses were found in any sinus mucosa samples of CRS patients and normal subjects. therefore, it may be necessary to determine whether respiratory viruses invade the sinus mucosa to understand the relationship of CRS pathogenesis to respiratory viruses. enterovirus contributes relatively little to URI in the immunocompetent subjects."}
