{"summary": "laboratory capacity is needed in central Viet Nam to provide early warning to public health authorities of respiratory outbreaks of importance to human health. the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009 provided a practical test of the laboratory\u2019s pandemic plan. infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus have occurred since 20031 and cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2004. as of November 2011, Viet Nam has recorded the third highest number of avian influenza cases and second highest number of related deaths globally. the region has a tropical climate with average temperatures ranging between 27 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C across two seasons. the district population was 241 173 in 2009. the 200-bed hospital treated a total of 19 516 patients, 927 with suspected pneumonia and 1654 with upper respiratory tract illnesses. a non-human RNA virus (bovine viral diarrhoea virus) was spiked at low copy number into each sample before nucleic acid extraction. reverse transcription was performed on 10l of extract using random hexamer priming as previously described. the viruses were detected using multiplex PCR assays based on methods reported previously. two microlitres of first-round PCR product were then transferred to a second round mastermix containing second-round primers ENTB and ENTC. final PCR product was analysed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. all samples were tested in two separate assays, a real-time PCR assay incorporating influenza A virus matrix and BVDV primers and the respiratory multiplex assay. a(H1N1)pdm09 was confirmed in influenza-positive samples using a real-time PCR assay. the region has a tropical climate with average temperatures ranging between 27 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C across two seasons. the district population was 241 173 in 2009. the 200-bed hospital treated a total of 19 516 patients, 927 with suspected pneumonia and 1654 with upper respiratory tract illnesses. nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription was performed on 10l of extract using random hexamer priming. a non-human RNA virus (bovine viral diarrhoea virus) was spiked at low copy number into each sample. two microlitres of first-round PCR product were then transferred to a second-round mastermix containing second-round primers ENTB and ENTC. final PCR product was analysed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. all samples were tested in two separate assays, a real-time PCR assay incorporating influenza A virus matrix and BVDV primers. the final reaction volume was 20l with a thermal. Specimens and patients A total of 2144 surveillance specimens collected from individual patients were tested. one quarter of these cases were admitted to a hospital ward. surveillance patients ranged in age from 0.1 months to 85 years. the most common were influenza strains, more than half of which were A(H1N1)pdm09, first detected at the end of the dry season in 2009. this virus replaced an epidemic of A(H3N2) that occurred throughout the dry season in 2010, peaking at the end of the dry season in 2010. two large influenza B epidemics occurred during the study, peaking in the wet seasons of 2008 and 2010 but also circulating at low levels during the dry season in both years. there was a single detection of non-pathogenic H5N1 in a three-year-old child. 34.5 27 12.8 17 6.9 3 2.6 0 0.0 A(H1N1) 11 1.1 4 1.1 0 0.0 2 0.9 0 0.0 1 0.9 0 0.0 A(H3N2) 113 11.7 25 7.0 10 4.3 6 2.8 6 2.4 3 2.6 2 5.7 A(H5N1) 1 0.1 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 OC43 was the most common coronavirus, with a distribution that spanned the wet and dry seasons in 2008 through 2009 and 2009 through 2010. there were 148 cases (6.9%) involving co-infection with at least two viruses. adenoviruses (50.7% of all co-infections) and adenoviruses (39.9%) were most commonly involved. Specimens and patients A total of 2144 surveillance specimens collected from individual patients were tested. one quarter of these cases admitted to a hospital ward. the majority were children aged five years and under (45.1%). Influenza virus detections Of the 2144 surveillance samples tested, 1235 (57.6%) were positive for at least one virus. most common were influenza strains, more than half of which were A(H1N1)pdm09, first detected at the end of the dry season in 2009. A(H1N1)pdm09 infected mainly children and young adults. two large influenza B epidemics occurred during the study. there was a single detection of non-pathogenic H5N1 in a three-year-old child. 57.8 163 66.0 79 68.7 25 71.4 Influenza A 145 15.0 79 22.3 93 39.6 35 16.6 23 9.3 7 6.1 2 5.7 A(H1N1)pdm09 23 2.4 49 13.8 81 34.5 27 12.8 17 6.9 3 2.6 0 0.0 A(H1N1) 11 1.1 4 1.1 0 0.0 2 0.9 0 0.0 1 0.9 0 0.0 A(H3N non-influenza virus detections Picornaviruses were detected throughout the two years of surveillance. two large enterovirus outbreaks were mainly confined to the dry seasons in 2009 and 2010.
