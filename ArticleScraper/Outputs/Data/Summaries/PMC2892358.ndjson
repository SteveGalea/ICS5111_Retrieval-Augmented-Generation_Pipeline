{"summary": "the pathogen induces host cells to generate excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the prototypic example being tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that alter organ function and host metabolism, thus generating the disease we observe (1,2) this general concept has taken root in the mainstream, and is now often referred to as the \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 (6). gemfibrozil is a synthetic ligand for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) alpha. it controls lipid homeostasis, with fatty acids and eicosanoids as endogenous ligands. fenofibrate also reduces mortality of influenza virus-infected mice. administration of neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies during the course of influenza in mice did not increase viral titers. course of infection of H5N1 influenza virus was not worsened in mice genetically unable to produce TNF (27) it is therefore unlikely that agents that interfere with expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF will enhance susceptibility to influenza. lycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots, protects all treated mice from fatality while all control mice died. glycyrrhizin binds to, and inactivates, the novel pro-inflammatory mediator high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) (34), which is elevated in the serum of sepsis patients who succumbed to infection (35). HMGB1 is the only high mobility group protein with an extracellular function, a cytokine-like activity (38,39) it is most unusual about HMGB1 that its secretion continues for an uncommonly long time. this is in contrast to TNF secretion, for example, which peaks 90 min after stimulation. artemisinin, a Chinese herb traditionally used as an anti-malarial drug, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of NF-B (49) it also protects against lethal endotoxemia (50) thus warranting its consideration as a potential influenza treatment. reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (62), downstream by-products of inflammation should make it a priority for influenza researchers interested in examining the effect of immunomodulatory treatments on the course of influenza disease. biochanin A activates both PPAR alpha and gamma receptors in vitro (64) sepsis is characterized by a prolonged inflammatory state that, if untreated, results in death (36), it is comparable to the cytokine storm that ensues in H5N1 influenza infections in people. the low molecular weight fraction of an aqueous extract of the Chinese herb Angelica sinensis is dose-dependently protective during lethal experimental sepsis. aqueous extract of another Chinese herb was protective against lethal endotoxemia and sepsis by decreasing HMGB1 levels in vivo. artemisinin, a Chinese herb traditionally used as an anti-malarial drug, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of NF-B. cytokines under control of NF-B induce HMGB1 (56) green tea (Camellia sinensis) reduces endotoxin-induced release of HMGB1. it is also proposed to possess the ability to decrease mortality from sepsis if taken regularly (57) biochanin A activates both PPAR alpha and gamma in one treatment. it is possible that combining PPAR alpha and gamma activation in one treatment may prove more effective in curbing influenza-related mortality than activation of either PPAR receptor alone. large amounts of HMGB1 have been detected in the serum of sepsis patients who succumbed to infection (35) HMGB1 levels are higher during falciparum malaria levels in patients who do not recover (71) HMGB1-infected airway epithelial cells may passively release HMGB1. alveolar macrophages, which become infected with influenza virus (93), secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-10 from effector T-cells was recently shown to limit inflammation during acute influenza (97) glycyrrhizin protects influenza virus-infected mice from fatality (33) potentially via its ability to bind to, and inactivate, HMGB1 (34) endogenously produced molecules that dampen the effects of HMGB1 in the circulation are also elevated during severe disease states. thombomodulin, which binds to HMGB1 and prevents it binding to RAGE (76) is elevated during severe malaria (77), sepsis (78 ines IL-4 and IL-10, and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-, TNF and HMGB1. the next step would be to conduct studies in mice infected with influenza virus and administered the formula orally, daily, adjusted according to body weight. studies have compared the incidence of influenza-like illness in healthcare workers using an herbal formula against those using no agent (88) but results were questioned because workers given the herbal formula knew that they were taking the \u2018active\u2019 treatment. release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is reduced via inhibition of NF-B activation, by glycyrrhizin (101\u2013103), A. sinensis (104,105) and S. miltiorrhiza (106,107); by the natural agent biochanin A (65,108,109); and the pharmaceutical drugs statins (110,111) and fibrates (21,112,113). pro-inflammatory cytokine release is reduced by activation treatment of influenza virus-infected mice with PPAR alpha agonist gemfibrozil resulted in significantly decreased influenza-induced mortality. the natural immunomodulatory agent biochanin A from Red Clover could have similar effects to gemfibrozil on the course of influenza disease in vivo."}
