{"summary": "serotype 2 of S. suis (SS2) is considered to be the most virulent, and is frequently isolated from clinically-diseased piglets. SS2 seems to be a previously neglected but recently emerging human pathogen,5 whose infection has become increasingly potent. 14 SS16,15,16 and SS2411 can also be found to function as the causative agents responsible for sporadic cases of human S. suis infection. no specific/effective human therapeutics or vaccine against SS2 infections is available thus far. 89K PAI with a transposon-like essence can undergo GI-type T4SS-mediated horizontal transfer in epidemic SS2 species. further studies suggested that 89K PAI with a transposon-like essence can undergo GI-type T4SS-mediated horizontal transfer. SS2 is recognized as the most virulent species associated with diseased pigs and often causes an opportunistic infection of adults having occupational contact with pig carcass or pork-related products. multiple lines of new bacterial virulence determinants have been identified. fast assays using PCR-based molecular detection18 as well as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)-guided diagnostics were established36. most important risk factors of human S. suis infections are consecutively eating \u201chigh risk\u201d pork-derived dishes. epf 2002 203 mrp, epf, sly 2000/2003 204 and 205 cps, epf, mrp, sly, arcA, gdh 2006/2013 206 and 207 16s, cps2J 2004 208 RFLP Used for ribotyping 1995 209 PFGE Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 2002\u20132011 37 and 210\u2013217 ISR no less than 14 genomes of S. suis strains have been available in PubMed. genome size varies markedly from 1 640 446 nt (05HAS68, NZ_AARD00000000) to 2 146 229 nt. s. suis is a group of heterogeneous gram-positive bacteria. these microorganisms show either -hemolysis when growing on selective plates of horse blood agar1. SS2 is recognized as the most virulent species associated with diseased pigs. pig population in slaughterhouses is a major reservoir of SS2 with a capacity to cause human infections37. pig population in slaughterhouses is a major reservoir of SS2 with a capacity to cause human infections37. pig population in slaughterhouses is a major reservoir of SS2 with a capacity to cause human infections37. the availability of the epidemiological knowledge on human SS2 infections is critical to improve public awareness of SS2 infections and to effectively prevent the potential occupational infections caused by SS2.

SS2 has been recognized as a pathogen with the mostly-relevance to human bacterial meningitis in southern Vietnam. the first human case of S. suis infection was recorded in 1983,78,80. in the 1998 epidemic, 14 out of 25 SS2-infected persons died along with an estimated 80 000 pigs. the second method has been experimentally developed into two subgroups (PCR-based detection plus typing-oriented analyses like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP]. the major four types of typing methods include PFGE, RFLP, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) almost 60 bacterial components have been identified to be involved in the infection and/or pathogenicity of S. suis. so far, almost 60 bacterial components

assays have demonstrated that SspA protein plays critical roles in SS2 pathogenicity. a subsequent study further revealed that S. suis SspA protease might modulate cytokine secretion by macrophages. this antigen can elicit obvious humoral antibody response and confer efficient protection against SS2 challenge. this observation is consistent with the fact that CcpA contributes to bacterial infectivity/pathogenicity. preliminary evidence pointed out that HP0197 might determine the Ser-46 phosphorylation level of phospho carrier protein (HPr-46), a partner protein of CcpA. sao-S, sao-M, and sao-L are present in S. suis population. recent further genetic study suggested that SAO protein is only a minor virulence factor123 Sat (HP272) is another newly-identified surface protein from

(cAMP)-dependent signaling is linked to streptococcal infectivity. cAMP deaminase from Leptospira,148 can quench cAMP-dependent signaling. it might suggest possibility that cAMP-dependent signaling is linked to streptococcal infectivity. willenborg et al.118 evaluated the effect of the sugar metabolism regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) on S. suis pathogenesis. a recent study implied that Sao protective antigen plays a limited role in bacterial virulence. virulent strain of S. suis 2,23 five have been proposed to be correlated with strong virulence. the deletion of this salK-salR system resulted in significant downregulation of 26 genes\u2019 expression level. covR-defective mutant displayed thicker capsules and increased hemolytic activity. removal of covR gene was found to
