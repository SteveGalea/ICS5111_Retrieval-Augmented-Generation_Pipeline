{"summary": "human airway epithelium cells were grown at the air\u2013liquid interface. the H7N9 replication kinetics and anti-H7N9 effect of recombinant human 2b and rhIFN-1 were quantified by real-time PCR assays. the 3D cell culture model is suitable for evaluating interferon antiviral activity. it can demonstrate realistic in vivo-like effects."}
