{"summary": "TEXT The transfer of T cell receptor (TCR) genes into primary T cells by viral vectors represents a powerful method to generate antigen-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. this approach is widely used in immunotherapy against tumors (reviewed in references 11, 13, and 20) a strong expansion of the P14-td cells was observed, peaking 1 week postinfection (p.i.) followed by decline (Fig. 1B, filled circles). LCMV-infected recipients of P14 TCR-td cells described here were healthy, and overt pathologies were not observed. the horizontal dashed line shows the mean percentages of V2+ V8+ cells in the absence of transduction. data are derived from 2 independent experiments with 4 or 5 mice per group. the effector cell marker KLRG1 (22) was only detected on a subset of P14-td cells from LCMV-immune mice. the protective activity of P14-td cells was first examined in the LCMV infection model. LCMV titers were determined on day 4 p.i. data are from 3 mice per group. splenocytes were also transduced with OT-1 TCR specific for ovalbumin. retroviral transduction efficacies of OT-1 and P14 TCRs were comparable. in contrast to wild-type LCMV, OT-1-td cells failed to lower LCMV 8.7 titers. in contrast to wild-type LCMV, P14-td cells failed to decrease LCMV 8.7 titers. the indicated numbers of P14 TCR-transduced (P14-td) or P14 TCR-transgenic (P14-tg) cells were adoptively transferred into B6 mice. mice were infected with 2 106 PFU rVVLCMV-GP and VV titers in ovaries. P14-td cells isolated from noninfected recipient mice failed to produce significant levels of IFN- without further in vivo priming. this results fits well with previous observation that even nave P14 T cells from TCR-tg mice can considerably lower LCMV titers in the spleen after adoptive transfer (24)."}
