{"summary": "human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a double stranded DNA virus in the Hepadnaviridae family. infection could cause acute and chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. in vitro studies have shown that HBc binds directly to the covalently closed circular DNA upon entering the nucleus. HBc appears to regulate the activities of host cells by interacting directly with the host genome [11]. pCMV-HA vectors or pCMV-HA-HBc, and co-IP assays were carried out with anti-HA antibody or HBc antibody. immuno-complexes were detected by western blot assays using the anti-Flag antibody or anti-HA antibody (control) interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, 2, and 3, exhibit antiviral capabilities mainly through the inhibition of virus entry. HBc downregulates the BAF200-dependent expression of IFITM1 via disruption of PBAF complex stability. Plasmids BAF200C (4255\u20135319 nt of ARID2) was amplified from the fragment screened by the yeast two-hybrid system using primers. pGC-FU-Flag and pHBV1.31 vector were synthesized by Prof. R Xiang (Xiangya School of Medicine of Central South University, China) matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 was used for the screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) with pGBKT7-HBc as bait. co-transformants were selected on synthetic dropout (SD), media lacking leucine, tryptophan, adenine, and histidine (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His) and containing 5-bromo-4-ch fetal calf serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin sulfate at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. pCMV-HA-HBc or pCMV-HA vectors were co-transfected into indicated cells. the medium was refreshed with serum-free DMEM/1640 6 h. PMM is Williams\u2019 E medium supplemented with an insulin-transferrin-selenium solution (thermo), 10 ng/mL of human epidermal growth factor (EGF, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), 2 mM l-glutamine (Thermo), 18 g/mL of hydrocortisone, 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 40 ng/mL of dexamethasone western blots were probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. anti-BAF200 (catalog no. A302-230A, Bethyl), anti-HBc (catalog no. B0586, Dako) protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay [25] the quantity of the RNA samples was detected by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo scientific) one microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA) the levels of IFITMs mRNA and intracellular HBV genomic DNA were determined by RT-qPCR analysis using SYBR Green Premix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) all the siRNAs were transfected using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 0.04% (w/v) ten microliters of the suspension was transferred to a hemocytometer and viable cells were counted. the test was repeated at least three times. free DNA and enzymes of 10 L cell culture supernatant were removed. the mixture was added to 100 L of a lysis buffer (20 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% SDS, and 50 mM NaCl) after this, HBV DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. pGC-FU-Flag and pHBV1.31 vector were synthesized by GenScript Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China) full-length of HBc was cloned into the pGBKT7 (Clontech, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) vector with primers. cell culture and transfection HepG2 cells and 293T cells, purchased from CCTCC, were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) they were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 1% penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. the medium was refreshed with serum-free DMEM/1640 6 h after transfection. the supernatant was harvested 36 h post incubation for co-immunoprecipitation or western blot analyses. cells were washed with ice-cold PBS after 36 h, harvested by scraping, then lysed using an RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS) after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min, supernatants were incubated with primary antibody or IgG (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, secondary antibodies (1:8000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 h at room temperature. blots were visualized with the ECL system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) the target genes were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by the Ct method. -actin was used as control. cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2 103 cells per well. cells were transfected with pGC-FU-Flag vector, siRNA, or pGC-FU-Flag-BAF200 and incubated for 24 h. after incubating for 2 h, cells were lysed in 100 L DMSO. the supernatant was collected to detect levels of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B E antigen (HBeAg) using a commercial ELISA kit. the HBV DNA copy number was quantified by real-time PCR with a commercial PCR-Fluorescence Quantification Kit. HBc Interacts with BAF200 To dissect the function of HBc, we screened a human fetal brain cDNA library for novel HBc-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. co-IP assays were performed to verify the two-hybrid results. the results indicate that the expressed C-terminal of BAF200 co-precipitated with HBc. overexpressed BAF200 co-precipitated with HBc. HBc interaction with full-length BAF200 was further assessed. the impact of overexpressed BAF200 on IFITM1, 2, and 3 was examined via protein (Figure 2a) and mRNA (Figure 2b) levels. results showed that BAF200 up-regulated IFITM1 protein expression. but no apparent effect of BAF200 was observed on expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3. IFITM1 transcription levels under induction of IFN at different concentrations were examined via RT-qPCR assays, and normalized to the GAPDH mRNA level. the vector transfection control treated with 1000 U/mL IFN was designated as 100%. we used western blot assays to detect phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) in HepG2 cells with or without BAF200. the results showed that pSTAT1 appeared only upon IFN stimulation. HBc downregulates IFITM1 expression by modulating PBAF stability. co-IP assays were performed with BAF200 antibodies. immuno-complexes were detected by western blot assays. the depletion of BAF200 leads to the complete inactivation of PBAF. flag-BAF200 was transfected with or without HA-HBc into HepG2 cells. cells were later treated with IFN (500 U/mL) and total mRNA was extracted to detect transcription levels of IFITM1, 2, and 3 by RT-qPCR. HBc regulates the suppression of IFITM1 expression by HBc in vitro. inhibitory effect of IFN, and overexpression of HBc partially recovered the cell viability. the siRNA mediated knock down of IFTIM1 increased the cell viability robustly, about two\u2013four-fold compared to the control. HBc antagonizes the suppression of IFTIM1 and the proliferation of HBV-infected cells in vitro. empty vector and pHBV1.31 were co-transfected with empty vector flag-BAF200 or HA-HBc. the control without IFN treatment was designed as 100% (a,c\u2013f) the control without IFN treatment was designed as 100% (a,c\u2013f) HBc interacts with BAF200 to dissect the function of HBc. we screened a human fetal brain cDNA library for novel HBc-interacting proteins. co-transformants were selected on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His/X--gal. HBc and the co-precipitation was detected with the anti-Flag antibody. the results showed that overexpressed BAF200 co-precipitated with HBc. the results confirm the binding between HBc and HBc. expression level was suppressed 2.1-fold when endogenous BAF200 was silenced in HepG2 cells. data suggest that HBc regulates IFITM1 expression by binding to BAF200. we co-transfected HBc and BAF200 into HepG2 cells, treated the cells with 500 U/mL IFN. the results indicate that BAF200 enhanced IFITM1 expression. the enhancement was partially reduced when HBc was co-transfected. HBc downregulates IFITM1 expression by modulating PBAF stability. pCMV-Flag vector and pCMV-Flag-BAF200 were transfected into HepG2 cells, with or without IFN (500 U/mL) treatment for 24 h. -IP assays were performed with BAF200 antibodies. immuno-complexes were detected by western blot assays. we predicted that the interaction of HBc with BAF200 would interrupt the stability of PBAF complexes, leading to potential BAF200-dependent IFITM1 expression. HBc interacts with BAF200, and the HBc\u2013BAF200 interaction prevents the BAF180\u2013BAF200 interactions that might abolish PBAF complex stability. the effect of HBc on the anti-proliferation action of IFTIM1 in HBV-infected cells was investigated via siRNA-mediated knockdown. pGC-FU-Flag vectors, siRNA, or pGC-FU-Flag-BAF200 pasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells (c) or HepG2.2.15 cells (d,e) then treated with 500 U/mL IFN for 72 h. HBc antagonizes suppression of IFTIM1 and proliferation of HBV-infected cells in vitro. pHBV1.31, which contains 1.3-fold HBV genome, was co-transfected with empty vector flag-BAF200 or HA-HBc into HepG2 cells. supernatants were collected to determine the HBV replication level by detecting the quantitation of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA copy numbers. the early phase of a viral infection is mainly characterized by the production of cytokines, type I IFN, and natural killer (NK) cells. type I IFNs can be triggered directly by virus replication through the detection of viral RNA or DNA. they play a critical role in the immune recognition of HBV. HBc inhibits the IFITM1 transcription by disturbing the stability of PBAF complex in vitro. HBc acts as a tumor suppressor as well, by blocking the transcription of the human tumorigenesis-associated genes, IFN and p53 [11,35]. PBAF complexes facilitate the initiation of IFITM1 transcription. the interaction of HBc with BAF200 interferes with binding between BAF180 and BAF200. thus, the efficient process of the PBAF complex is interrupted. this leads to the suppression of IFITM1 transcription. of HBV infection."}
