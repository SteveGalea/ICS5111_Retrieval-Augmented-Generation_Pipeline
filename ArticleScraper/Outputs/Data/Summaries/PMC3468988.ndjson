{"summary": "new zoonoses such as bovine spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (2) or west Nile Virus (WNV) (3) and new infectious diseases such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (4) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (5) come easily to mind and provide good examples. the precautionary principle is examined as another possible avenue to justify State access to and use of genomic databases for research purposes or, for the management of a pandemic. this paper could help countries to examine their own definitions and legislations of public health to see if they contain provision that could form the foundation. the concept of public health has expanded with the passage of time. health promotion has become an increasingly important theme. in recent decades, health promotion has become an increasingly important theme. the study of essential functions of public health is helpful in understanding public health legislation, its functioning and the scope of its application. essential functions are the set of actions that should be carried out specifically to achieve the central objective of public health: improving the health of populations. rew up a table of the categories used by the Qu\u00e9bec public health program. compared them to those of the WHO, the pan American health organization and the national public health. a similar analytical approach has been proposed in Quebec (12). surveillance function includes snapshots of health and well-being (socio-medical statistics), analysis of determinants and finally, identification of vulnerable groups. it also implies communicating information on the state of public health and well-being to the population itself (27). surveillance aims to support decision-making regarding the health and well-being status of a given population. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled. health authorities will act at the scale of either the entire population, groups, or individuals. health protection measures apply to harmful situations and particularly to biological, physical, and chemical aggressors. medical observation by public health teams allows the discovery of threats to population health in real time (26). health promotion refers to actions supporting individuals and communities in their effort to exert better control over essential factors of health and well-being. this function illustrates the support needed for the elaboration and application of laws and regulations, which have an effect on the health, and well-being of citizens (27). the research and innovation function includes all activities focused on the production, dissemination, and application of scientific knowledge as well as on innovation. public health authorities may collect information by means of registries or information and data collection systems. registries contain personal information on certain health services or health care. the best example is the vaccination registry described at article 61. the act stipulates that \"periodic surveys on health and social issues shall be conducted to gather the recurrent information necessary for ongoing surveillance of the health status of the population\" the nature of such surveys leads us to believe that they cannot be used in the context of genomic databases. the public health act provides measures for monitoring public health. the list may include only intoxications, infections or diseases that are medically recognized as capable of constituting a threat to the health of a population. they either present a risk for the occurrence of new cases in the population, because the disease or infection is contagious, or because the origin of the intoxication, infection, or disease may lie in a source of contamination or exposure. the list enumerates diseases, rather than methods for the detection of disease akin to the detection of susceptible genes public health director may conduct an epidemiological investigation (art. 96) if he believes on reasonable grounds that the health of the population is or could be threatened, he may conduct an epidemiological investigation. if the public health director believes on reasonable grounds that the health of the population is not controlled, he may conduct an epidemiological investigation. the state of emergency is considered so paramount that \"[t]he Government, the Minister or another person may not be prosecuted by reason of an act performed in good faith\" unless such \u201cemergency\u201d information is available and workable, genomic research will not be possible due to time constraints. the research would take too long before results could determine which measures to adopt. the inSPQ states that basic research, the results and applications of which are not expected in the short or medium term have been excluded from the field of research in public health. if all legislative texts examined here do not create an explicit power to access and use genomic databases for research purposes, we can ask ourselves if it is possible to invoke the precautionary principle to legitimate a state power allowing this type of intervention. the precautionary principle is a concept of \u201cvariable geometry\u201d (37) it has a malleable character; the definition and its impact on the decision making process vary according to the context of application. the precautionary principle is a concept of \u201cvariable geometry\u201d (37) the tactic approach favours eradication of risks. precaution is a temporary and flexible instrument; uncertainty is thought to dissipate with knowledge. the tactic approach operates in the short and medium term. measures are provisional and revisable, subject to change. a pandemic caused by the avian influenza mobilized the forces of many international and national public health bodies. a number of factors are likely to influence the nature of surveillance measures. the guidelines recommend considering changes in circumstances and new information ensued. a large portion of the Canadian plan deals with functions related to prevention and protection. the plan favors transparency and stakeholder responsibility in risk communication. a large portion of the Canadian plan deals with functions related to prevention and protection. annex L of the Canadian plan outlines the federal government\u2019s responsibilities in the area of public health, particularly the powers conferred to the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada. the examples listed include SARS, the ice storm of 1998, nuclear emergencies, pandemic influenza and \u201cevents or catastrophes of natural origin or deliberately caused\u201d 'scientific activity' plays a significant role in controlling pandemic influenza (45). but other documents fail to mention scientific activity.'scientific activity' is an area that can have significant demands. the current trend for western countries is to adopt a broad definition (13). this definition illustrates the importance of the collective dimension of public health measures. the concept of public health is constantly evolving. the WHO stresses that a growing understanding of various health determinants is transforming the assessment of public health. the study of essential functions of public health is helpful in understanding public health legislation, its functioning and the scope of its application. the study of essential functions of public health is helpful in understanding public health legislation, its functioning and the scope of its application. these categories and definitions are constantly evolving (13) and are specific to each organization. a similar analytical approach has been proposed in Quebec. the ongoing surveillance function includes measures that delimit access to information, as well as those needed for the description and analysis of the population\u2019s health status. it also includes vigilance, producing snapshots of health and well-being (socio-medical statistics), analysis of determinants, and finally, identification of vulnerable groups. it also implies communicating information on the state of public health and well-being to the population itself (27). health promotion. Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues. Public health legislation and regulations. Strengthening of public health regulation and enforcement capacity. Enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled. health protection measures apply to harmful situations and particularly to sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, workplace health, and environmental health. this function involves identifying the problems and situations which call for a regulatory, legislative or policy-based solution. it consists also in assessing the consequences of public policies for the population\u2019s health and recommending measures to reduce their negative effects on health. it includes carrying out mandates related to the application of regulations, laws, or policies, which come under spheres other than public health. surveillance function also includes vigilance, producing snapshots of health and well-being (socio-medical statistics), analysis of determinants, and finally, identification of vulnerable groups. it also implies communicating information on the state of public health and well-being to the population itself (27). ongoing surveillance thus differs from public health research. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent. health promotion refers to actions supporting individuals and communities in their effort to exert better control over essential factors of health and well-being. actions emphasize social and political dimensions: supporting community action, developing public policies, and creating a (physical, cultural, social, social, economical, and political) environment that is favorable to health. ongoing surveillance of the population\u2019s health status and its determinants. health and well-being (socio-medical statistics), analysis of determinants, and finally, identification of vulnerable groups and of efficient interventions. it also implies communicating information on the state of public health and well-being to the population itself (27). surveillance thus differs from public health research. personal and population-based health services. Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services. link people to needed personal health services and assure provision of health care when otherwise unavailable. health promotion refers to actions supporting individuals and communities in their effort to exert better control over essential factors of health and well-being. actions emphasize social and political dimensions: supporting community action, developing public policies and creating a (physical, cultural, social, social, economical, and political) environment that is favorable to health. the research and innovation function includes all activities focused on the production, dissemination, and application of scientific knowledge as well as on innovation. if genomics research is a new tool in public health action, should not the research and innovation function be integrated into the core functions of public health. public health authorities may collect information by means of registries or information and data collection systems. the first category refers to the system established by the minister of health and social services for the compilation of sociological and health-related personal or non-personal information on births, stillbirths, and deaths. the second category refers to systems for the compilation of sociological and health-related personal or non-personal information on births, stillbirths, and deaths. collection systems have been implemented within the framework of the ongoing surveillance entrusted exclusively to the Minister and to public health directors5 (art. 34, par. 1). ongoing surveillance is carried out in order to: \"Obtain an overall picture of the health status of the population; Monitor trends and temporal and spatial variations; Detect emerging problems; Develop prospective scenarios of the health status of the population\" the public health Act provides measures for monitoring public health. four areas are outlined: reporting of unusual clinical manifestations associated with a vaccination. mandatory reporting of intoxications, infections, and diseases. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled. a public health emergency in all or part of the territory of Quebec will occur \"where a serious threat to the health of the population, whether real or imminent, requires the immediate application of certain measures to protect the health of the population\" the government or the minister may, if he or she has been so empowered, order any person, government department or body to communicate or provide immediate access to any document or information held. unless such \u201cemergency\u201d information is available and workable, genomic research will not be possible due to time constraints. the research would take too long before results could determine which measures to adopt. if the Government has extraordinary powers at its disposal, we consider that they are inappropriate in this research context. the public health Act does not contain any specific provision regarding access to genomic databases for research purposes. it establishes certain powers related to the collection or transmission of information necessary for exercising public health powers. public health authorities may collect information by means of registries or information and data collection systems. ongoing surveillance does not apply to research and knowledge development activities carried out in the sector of health or social services in particular, by the Institut national de la statistique du Qu\u00e9bec. the nature of such surveys leads us to believe that they cannot be used in the context of genomic databases. the public health Act provides measures for monitoring public health. toxications, infections and diseases (art. 81\u201382); notification of the public health director in the case where a person who is likely suffering from a disease or infection is refusing to submit to an examination (art. 86); alerting public authorities to health threats (other than those arising from a sexually transmitted biological agent) two areas outlined by the Act are particularly relevant to our study. government departments and bodies, local municipalities, health care professionals, directors of institutions must report threats, other than those that arise from a sexually transmitted infection. a threat to public health occurs when there is the presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled. the public health director may conduct an epidemiological investigation. a public health emergency in all or part of the territory of Quebec will occur \"where a serious threat to the health of the population requires the immediate application of certain measures to protect the health of the population\" the state of emergency is considered so paramount that \"[t]he Government, the Minister or another person may not be prosecuted by reason of an act performed in good faith\" public health authorities may collect information by means of registries or information and data collection systems. registries contain personal information on certain health services or health care received by the population. the best example is the vaccination registry described at article 61. ongoing surveillance does not apply to research and knowledge development activities carried out in the sector of health or social services in particular, by the Institut national de la statistique du Qu\u00e9bec. the nature of such surveys leads us to believe that they cannot be used in the context of genomic databases. two areas outlined by the Act are particularly relevant to our study. we ask ourselves if genetic susceptibilities should be included in the category of reportable intoxications, infections, and diseases pursuant to section 79 of the Act. the list may include only intoxications, infections, and diseases that are medically recognized as capable of constituting a threat to the health of a population. a threat to public health occurs when there is the \"presence within the population of a biological, chemical, or physical agent that may cause an epidemic if it is not controlled\" the public health director may conduct an epidemiological investigation (art. 96) a public health emergency in all or part of the territory of Quebec will occur \"where a serious threat to the health of the population, whether real or imminent, requires the immediate application of certain measures to protect the health of the population\" the state of emergency is considered so paramount that \"[t]he Government, the Minister or another person may not be prosecuted by reason of an act performed in good faith\" research into the health and well-being of the population belongs to the field of public health research6 (23). a review published by the INSPQ also notes that research into the health and well-being of the population and its determinants seeking to produce, integrate, disseminate and apply scientific knowledge to the exercise of public health functions belong to the field of public health research6 (23). the precautionary principle was prominent in the reports of commissioners appointed to inquire into the tainted blood scandal and the SARS crisis8 (32\u201334) the first two elements are criteria for the application of the principle, whereas the third determines its normative scope. however, these application parameters establish standards that cannot be determined objectively, and are subject to different interpretations. the cautious approach favours eradicating risks. the tactic approach is associated with the implementation of quarantine measures. the tactic approach is associated with moratoriums, embargos, and other reversible measures. a pandemic caused by the avian influenza mobilized the forces of many international and national public health bodies. it would be particularly interesting to verify whether these governing bodies intend to take advantage of the field of genomics, and if so, in which manner they plan to do it. a pandemic pandemic affects several countries. a number of factors are likely to influence the nature of surveillance measures. the guidelines recommend considering changes in circumstances and new information ensued. all aspects of a disease or of the epidemiology of the infection will require special attention. the annex of the Canadian plan outlines the federal government\u2019s responsibilities in the area of public health. the examples listed include SARS, the ice storm of 1998, nuclear emergencies, pandemic influenza and \u201cevents or catastrophes of natural origin or deliberately caused\u201d. the Qu\u00e9bec plan reflects this complex objective in distinguishing five broad facets of state intervention. it reflects this complex objective in distinguishing five broad facets of state intervention. the purpose of the plan is to protect the lives and health of the population. a pandemic affects several countries. public health measures at the borders will therefore be crucial in preventing and controlling outbreaks. on communication in the Canadian plan describes national objectives of communication in detail and according to pandemic periods (43) the plan favors transparency and stakeholder responsibility in risk communication. the document also outlines the responsibility of officials towards the world health organization. guidelines recommend considering changes in circumstances and new information ensued. all aspects of a disease or of the epidemiology of the infection will require special attention. virulence, mode of transmission, incubation period, period of transmission and its effect on the population. an annex of the Canadian plan outlines the federal government\u2019s responsibilities in the area of public health. the annex does not include a definition of \u201cemergency\u201d per se. from these examples, we can infer that emergencies share the following characteristics: severity, need for immediate action, and a large number of people affected. the Qu\u00e9bec plan reflects this complex objective in distinguishing five broad facets of state intervention. it focuses on protecting the health of the population, providing medical care, ensuring people\u2019s psychosocial well-being, and keeping the network working. the public health ethics committee was created by the Public Health Act. in a not too distant future, genomics may well become a health determinant (46) in Quebec, biological and genetic predispositions, lifestyles and other health-related behaviours, living conditions and social settings are considered health determinants. in the future, the scope of the concept of research in public health should be clear and include a commitment to the health and well-being of the population. the concept of public health is far from static; it demonstrates a flexibility that guarantees a perpetual adaptation to new forms of risks attributable to the determinants of health. the flexibility of public health may allow it to embrace new research tools, such as genomics. however, how can this innovative tool be utilized to reach the public health objectives of protection, prevention, promotion, and surveillance\""}
