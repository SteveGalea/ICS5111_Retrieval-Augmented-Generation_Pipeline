{"summary": "PHEV is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae. it causes encephalomyelitis and/or vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) in piglets. the infection has been reported in major pig-raising countries of Europe, Asia, and North America. neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus have been widely used as models for the study of the human demyelination and neurodegeneration resembling multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology. PHEV is a neurotropic virus and belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, along with MHV, and is associated with a wide spectrum of neuropathological changes in susceptible animals. a population of Rab5-positive signaling endosomes containing endocytosed nerve growth factor controls the speed of axon elongation in developing neurons. a noncanonical or evolutionarily conserved role for Ulk1 may indicate a link between endocytosis and neuronal survival. the dysfunction of Ulk1 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. ystagmus were observed in the infected mice at 2 to 3 days postinoculation (dpi) survival times were shorter in PHEV-infected mice than in control group mice. all the infected mice had a significantly lesser body weight starting at 4 dpi. qRT-PCR analysis of Ulk1 mRNA levels in mouse brain after PHEV infection. data are presented as the means standard errors of the means (SEM) serial mouse brain sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate showed myelin degeneration (e to h) serial brain sections stained with DAPI stained with antibodies against neuronal markers NeuN (green) and PHEV (red) two small-guide RNAs were designed and cloned into a pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro vector. Ulk1-pSpCas9 was then transfected into primary cortical neurons at 4 DIV. about 37.5% of transfected neurons carried the puromycin resistance gene. antibody staining in the Ulk1-pSpCas9-transfected neurons also revealed that all of these surviving Ulk1 mutant neurons exerted multiple neurite deficits. these are early hallmarks of neuronal degeneration and consistent with the expected defects that occur during PHEV infection. this aberrant morphological phenotype in Ulk1 mutants helped validate our finding that Ulk1 deficiency was probably the primary cause of neuronal degeneration induced cortical neurons at 4 DIV were transfected with Ulk1-pSpCas9 or Ulk1-pSpCas9. western blot analysis confirmed that Ulk1 protein was significantly decreased. arrows indicate fragments digested by T7E1. the numbers in the histograms indicate the neuron numbers from the three experiments. we overexpressed replication-deficient adenovirus-based green fluorescent protein expression vectors encoding Ulk1 in cortical neurons that were preincubated with PHEV. phenotypes in PHEV-infected cortical neurons were caused by the dysfunction of Ulk1-mediated NGF/TrkA retrograde signaling. to test this possibility, primary cortical neurons were incubated with PHEV and detected by Western blot analysis. we found that Ulk1 expression was inhibited in the PHEV-infected cortical neurons. PHEV infection suppresses the Ulk1-mediated endocytosis of NGF/TrkA complexes. cortical neurons were incubated with PHEV as indicated. a faint Cy3-fluorescent signal was detected in PHEV-infected or Ulk1 mutant neurons. neurons were stimulated with 10 nM NGF for different amounts of time (0, 10, 30, and 60 min) and lysed. neurons were preincubated with PHEV for 24 h or pretransfected with Ulk1-pSpCas9 at 4 DIV for 48 h. axons stained to visualize ectopic punctate signals of the Rab5 endosomes. EGFP-Rab5-expressing axons were stained to visualize Ulk1 and pTrkA expression. we hypothesize that PHEV controls retrograde trafficking of Ulk1/pTrkA complexes via the Rab5 endosomal system. pTrkA and Ulk1 coimmunoprecipitated with Rab5 at low but detectable levels. the degree of association was significantly weakened by a mean of 62% (P 0.034) after PHEV stimulation. bar, 20 m. (C) or GFP-Rab5-expressing neurons were transfected with PHEV for 24 h. the cells lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-GFP antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot (IB) analysis with the indicated antibodies. the PHEV-infected cortical neurons were found to have increased intrinsic Rab5 GTPase activity in response to Ulk1 restriction. the phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly increased (P 0.017) but Rab5 GTPase activation was reduced (P 0.010) by a mean of 54.2%, in comparison with the PHEV-infected group. cortical neurons were transfected with plasmids encoding Rab5:wt, Rab5:Q79L, or Rab5:S34N at 4 DIV. pTrkA trafficking was markedly suppressed in the Rab5:Q79L-expressing neurons. the expression level of pTrkA was dramatically decreased in Rab5:Q79L-expressing neurons but enhanced in Rab5:S34N-expressing neurons. the total TrkA level of all the transfected neurons was not significantly changed. the high-GTPase-activity isoform GFP-Rab5:Q79L facilitated PHEV proliferation. 3-week-old mice were inoculated intranasally with PHEV and monitored daily for clinical symptoms. neurologic signs, such as abnormal gait, tremors, dullness, listlessness, standing, raised forelimbs, arched waists, and nystagmus were observed in the infected mice at 2 to 3 days postinoculation (dpi) survival times were shorter in PHEV-infected mice than in control group mice. mice in the control group survived normally. survival curves of PHEV-infected mice from 0 to 6 dpi. qRT-PCR analysis of Ulk1 mRNA levels in mouse brain. the number of nondamaged neurons within CA1 in PHEV-infected mice was significantly smaller than that in healthy controls. PHEV attacks mainly neurons in the CNS and induces neurodegeneration. mice lacking Ulk1 expression in the CNS are likely to be associated with neurologic deficits. the level of endogenous Ulk1 was decreased during PHEV infection. we then applied the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat(s)-associated protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system to modify the Ulk1 gene at the DNA level. antibody staining in the Ulk1-pSpCas9-transfected neurons also revealed that all of these surviving Ulk1 mutant neurons exerted multiple neurite deficits. this includes irregular dendritic and axonal swelling, disconnected axons, reduced dendritic branches and an abnormal accumulation of Ulk1 protein in the neuritic beading. sgRNA targeting the Ulk1 gene loci and Sanger sequencing of the modified Ulk1 alleles. target fragments were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA extracted from independent transgenic neurons. arrows indicate the fragments digested by T7E1. cortical neurons at 5 DIV were incubated with PHEV for 24 h. they were then transfected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Ulk1 for 48 h. data are shown as the means SEM from the three experiments. p62 and Ulk1 are recruited to the NGF high-affinity receptor TrkA. this trophic signal is necessary for axonal arbor expansion and collateral sprouting. previous research has revealed that p62 and Ulk1 are recruited to the NGF high-affinity receptor TrkA. a faint Cy3-fluorescent signal was detected in PHEV-infected or Ulk1 mutant neurons. PHEV infection suppresses the Ulk1-mediated endocytosis of NGF/TrkA complexes. quantitative analyses revealed that the Cy3-NGF internalization was markedly suppressed in the PHEV-infected or Ulk1 mutant neurons. a high concentration of NGF increased TrkA phosphorylation and that Ulk1 continuously increased despite PHEV infection. cortical neurons were preincubated with PHEV for 24 h or pretransfected with Ulk1-pSpCas9 at 4 DIV for 48 h, followed by being treated with 10 nM NGF. after 24 h, these neurons were stained for MAP2. EGFP-Rab5-expressing axons stained to visualize Ulk1 and pTrkA expression. both Ulk1 and pTrkA colocalized with Rab5 endosomes in growing axons. pTrkA and Ulk1 coimmunoprecipitated with Rab5 at low but detectable levels. kA retrograde signaling pathway appears to be tightly associated with Rab5-containing endosomes during PHEV infection. cortical neurons were transfected with GFP-Rab5 at 4 DIV for 24 h and incubated with PHEV at 5 DIV for 24 h. bar, 20 m. (C) GFP-Rab5- or GFP-expressing neurons were infected with PHEV for 24 h and the cell lysates previous work showed that the state of Rab5 could explain the failure of Ulk1 to support retrograde NGF/TrkA transport and survival. the Ulk1-overexpressed, Ulk1 mutant, and normal neurons were infected with PHEV, lysed, and then tested by a Rab5 GTPase activation assay. cortical neurons were transfected with plasmids encoding Rab5:wt, Rab5:Q79L, or Rab5:S34N at 4 DIV. after 24 h of expression, neurons were infected with PHEV for 24 h. immunoblotting was performed with an anti-Rab5 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) the expression level of pTrkA was dramatically decreased in Rab5:Q79L-expressing neurons. the high-GTPase-activity isoform GFP-Rab5:Q79L facilitated PHEV proliferation in cortical neurons. DISCUSSION PHEV is one of five known porcine coronaviruses that cause disease in swine. the virus is considered endemic worldwide, maintaining itself by successively infecting groups of animals after replacement or weaning (10) PHEV infections can manifest as two forms of disease: digestive or encephalitic. Ulk1 is a mammalian homolog of Atg1 and plays key roles in selective and nonselective autophagy induced in response to mitochondrial damage, viral infection, proteotoxic stress, or various forms of metabolic stress. the lack of Ulk1 in the neurons infected with PHEV was surprising. Ulk1 directly interacts with unc-14, which regulates netrin receptor vesicle transport and localization by binding to unc-16/JIP3/JSAP1. kinesin-related Vab-8 protein regulates cell surface expression of Sax-3/Robo in the growth cones of touch neurons. the endocytic mechanism controlling the uptake and intracellular trafficking of the TrkA/NGF complex is still controversial. despite their physiological importance, the endocytic mechanism controlling the uptake and intracellular trafficking of the TrkA/NGF complex is still controversial. loss of Ulk1 stimulates the GTPase activity of Rab5 during PHEV infection. this leads to truncated neurites and disorganized vesicular compartments in cortical neurons. these results highlight that the Ulk1-containing protein complex governs neuronal morphogenesis by regulating the Rab5 GTPase signaling pathway. the HE protein is a membrane envelope and forms a second set of small spikes that assist in the attachment of virus to host cells and prevent aggregation of progeny virions. the HE protein is a membrane envelope and forms a second set of small spikes that assist in the attachment of virus to host cells. our study highlights the importance of endocytic processes in regulating trophic signaling events during neuronal morphogenesis. the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, China. monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for Rab5, Ulk1, TrkA, phospho-TrkA (pTrkA) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) the natural mouse nerve growth factor 2.5S (NGF 2.5S) was obtained from Invitrogen Corporation.
