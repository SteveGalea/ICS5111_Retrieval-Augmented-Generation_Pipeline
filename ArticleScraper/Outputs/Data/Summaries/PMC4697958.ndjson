{"summary": "de-identified data from 18 clinics from January 2009 to December 2012 were analyzed. of 23,534 travelers, 61% were non-occupational and 39% occupational. most business travelers indicated employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, while non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. the proportion of travelers vaccinated for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid was assessed for specific groups going to endemic countries. the proportion of travelers vaccinated for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid was assessed based on the most current CDC recommendations available at the time of the consultation. if the traveler received at least the first dose of a vaccine series at the pre-travel consultation, the traveler was considered, for this analysis, vaccinated for that disease. to accurately evaluate the trip duration and activities, only travelers with one purpose of travel and one itinerary were included. non-occupational travelers were classified as those traveling for leisure or those visiting friends and relatives. 9248 (39%) were occupational (including business travelers) of 39,589 total GTEN travelers, 23,534 (59%) met our inclusion criteria. of these travelers, 23,534 (59%) met our inclusion criteria. 1167 (93) 1132 (93) 849 (95) >2 828 (20) 282 (16) 81 (7) 83 (7) 47 (5) Top three destinations India 1,513 (24) India 208 (9) Haiti 216 (15) Honduras 180 (14) Haiti 193 (20) China 419 (7) China 150 (7) Kenya 127 (9) Haiti 139 (11) Honduras 86 (9) South Africa 238 (4) Ghana 79 (6) Ghana 83 (9) Type of accommodation (colum Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding. \"Other\" includes camp, cruise, lodge, boat, tree houses, cabin, and bed and breakfasts. 102 (8) Type of accommodation (column %)||, Hotel 3,765 (82) 11,140 (60) 152 (11) Home stay with relatives 33 (1) 992 (5) 1,110 (83) Dormitory or hostel 183 (4) 1,187 (6) 7 (1) Home stay with non- relatives 145 (3) 1,341 (7) 52 (4) Personal home/apartments 248 (5) 313 (2) 6 (1) Other 200 (5) 4,034 (21) 15 (2) Reason for visiting clinic. business vs leisure P 0.0001; business vs VFR P = 0.05 (Kruskal-Wallis). Among all occupational travelers, except for business (39%), were women. most business travelers (52%) indicated their employer suggested they make the pre-travel health appointment. travelers (15 days vs 14 days; P = 0.05) was most common reason for pre-travel health consultation. business travelers traveled for shorter periods of time than leisure travelers. more than 80% of leisure travelers chose a hotel as the most common type of accommodation. at the pre-travel consultation, 40% of business travelers, 37% of business travelers, and 27% of leisure travelers received meningococcal vaccine. at the time of the visit, 22% of business, 18% of leisure and 17% of VFR travelers had immunity to JE. hepatitis B, rabies, meningitis, polio, or JE vaccines not indicated for more than half of business or leisure travelers. 91% of business, 90% of leisure, and 88% of VFR travelers were prescribed an anti-malarial medication. atovaquone/proguanil most common among business and leisure travelers. business travelers had the shortest time to departure (median 15 days) most business travelers indicated their employer suggested they make the pre-travel health appointment. but most other occupational travelers reported that being concerned about health issues related to travel had prompted them to make a pre-travel health appointment. more than 80% of VFR travelers reported staying in a home with relatives. more business travelers reported travel to only urban areas than did leisure (67% vs 24%; P 0.0001) and VFR (67% vs 45%; P 0.0001) travelers. the proportion of business travelers with immunity was at least 90% for tetanus, hepatitis A, YF, and typhoid. HA, hepatitis A; HB, hepatitis B; I, influenza; JE, Japanese encephalitis; M, meningococcal; MMR; measles, mumps, rubella; P, polio; R, rabies; Tt, typhoid; V, varicella; YF, yellow fever. a higher percentage of VFR travelers declined vaccines. 91% of business, 90% of leisure, and 88% of VFR travelers were prescribed an anti-malarial medication. atovaquone/proguanil was most common among business and leisure travelers. business travelers had less time to departure than leisure travelers (15 days vs 29 days; P 0.0001) 60% of leisure travelers chose a hotel as the most common type of accommodation. more than 80% of VFR travelers reported staying in a home with relatives. more business travelers reported travel to only urban areas than did leisure (67% vs 24%; P 0.0001) and VFR (67% vs 45%; P 0.0001) travelers. a higher percentage of VFR travelers declined vaccines. a higher percentage declined influenza vaccine, 41% MMR vaccine, 32% meningococcal vaccine, 19% hepatitis B vaccine, 15% rabies vaccine and 12% JE vaccine. 91% of business, 90% of leisure, and 88% of VFR travelers were prescribed an anti-malarial medication. atovaquone/proguanil was most common among business and leisure travelers. business travelers are predominantly men, generally older, and seek pre-travel health care. non-medical service (median 22 years) and research/education travelers (median 24 years) were the youngest of all occupational travelers. only half of business travelers sought pre-travel advice within 2 weeks of their travel date. travelers and clinicians need to consider both urban and peri-urban exposures to mosquitoes. the median duration of travel for business travelers was 10 days. both leisure travelers and VFRs had significantly longer stays of 14 and 30 days. a study of Swiss business travelers found that only 27% had their annual influenza vaccination. increasing vaccination coverage in travelers can prevent the translocation of disease back to coworkers in the united states. employers have a responsibility to ensure the well-being of their employees during and after business travel. despite these limitations, our study is the largest analysis of detailed pre-travel health consultations prior to business and occupational-related travel. despite these limitations, our findings are of interest to businesses, and particularly to health care workers charged with caring for individuals whose work assignment involves international travel. purpose of travel was self-selected by travelers. there was no additional information, such as whether the traveler received compensation, to support that these travelers were unquestionably occupational or non-occupational. however, sub-national destination data were not available."}
