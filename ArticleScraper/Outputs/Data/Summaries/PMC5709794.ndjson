{"summary": "KS is a slowly growing, multicentric, angioproliferative tumour associated with human herpesvirus (HHV)8 infection. it is the most common tumour associated with HIV-1 infection. the incidence among patients infected with HIV is one in 20 [2, 3] clinical, radiological and bronchoscopic characteristics of pulmonary KS Common symptoms are dry cough and dyspnoea. reticular opacities and parenchymal nodules with a bronchovascular distribution, especially in lower lung zones; consolidation; peribronchial cuffing; pleural effusion; and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. the most important test to distinguish KS from others KS-mimicking diseases is the identification of HHV8 within KS lesion cells. the differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary nodules includes: infective disease (tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, fungal infection, or septic emboli), neoplastic disease (metastasis, lymphoma or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma), sarco KS is a slowly growing, multicentric, angioproliferative tumour associated with human herpesvirus (HHV)8 infection. it is the most common tumour associated with HIV-1 infection. incidence among patients infected with HIV is one in 20. a CT scan is more sensible and specific, and can show irregular, poorly defined nodules with speculated borders and peribronchovascular distribution, interstitial thickening and perinodular ground-glass halo signs. the effusion can be transudative or exudative and is often haemorrhagic because of the vascular nature of the disease. the most important test to distinguish KS from others KS-mimicking diseases is the identification of HHV8 within KS lesion cells by immunostaining for LANA-1 (or LNA-1). the differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary nodules includes: infective disease (tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, fungal infection, or septic emboli), neoplastic disease (metastasis, lymphoma or minimally clinical suspicion, accurate radiological description and multidisciplinary management were decisive in reaching a correct diagnosis."}
