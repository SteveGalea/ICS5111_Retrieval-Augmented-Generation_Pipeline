{"summary": "clinical practice examination (CPX) preparation program improves students' CPX score in terms of case specificity. CPX is being used as a means of assessing and training clinical competency. the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was implemented in the Korean Medical Licensing Examination (KMLE) it is ideal for students in clinical clerkship to enhance their clinical competence by having a good number of opportunities to experience direct interviews with actual patients. this lack of opportunity is then further exacerbated since protecting patients' rights is an essential part of health services. CPX preparation programs are used to prepare students for clinical skills test. these are taken prior to graduation with case studies in the form of CPX or role play. there is a lack of studies regarding the effect of CPX preparation programs on the clinical competency of students. students referred to the '2015 basic clinical practice guidelines' students were given the same CPX clinical problems, but were asked to develop modules based on different diseases. each subgroup was instructed to film a video clip of a typical medical encounter with a standardized patient. each subgroup was gathered to watch the video clips and complete the modules through cross-checking and feedback. items of investigation All students took a CPX on 13 stations in february 2015. both examinations involved a 10-minute one-on-one interview with standardized patient and evaluation of standardized patient on clinical competency of students. two of the taught CPX clinical problems were comprised some of the problems in the CPX taken in July. clerkship rotation groups could not participate in the community medicine clerkships, which occurs over the course of a week between June and July in 2015. the other 11 rotation groups had completed their respective community medicine training were not subject to any organized CPX-related training program. CPX preparation program was developed under the supervision of the department of medical education. members of each subgroup participated in role play by changing roles between physician, evaluator, and patient who exhibited cough, vaginal discharge, or hand tremor. students who experienced different cases were reorganized into different subgroups to experience different role play. items of investigation All students took a CPX on 13 stations in february 2015. data analysis The scores were determined by standardized patients who acted as raters. chi square test and Student t-test were used to compare CPX results between February and July. the score on vaginal discharge on the educated case was 73.056.31 points (P0.05) for each station score, the score on vaginal discharge on the educated case was significantly higher than 68.879.25 points for the control group (P=0.03) there was no difference in scores on cough, which had similar clinical problems as the educated case. standardized patients ensure high receptiveness, not only for educators, but also medical students, while culminating in higher effectiveness compared to that using role play. role play practice of students before CPX effectively improved score, specifically for some sections of history taking. physical exam was practiced by students after watching a video clip about standard physical exam based on demonstration by a medical resident of family medicine. scores on history taking section were not increased in this study, possibly for several reasons. first, there is a lack of dependability from the result of the colleague-evaluations that had been taken domestically. the increase in PPI scores through role play was only marginal in this study despite a significant increase in history taking scores. students have difficulty empathizing with their patients because they only concentrate on achieving a correct diagnosis. role play alone does not provide adequate training, while clinical practice involving standardized patients may prove to be rather more effective. the CPX results of the group, which underwent a preparation course, were higher than those of the group that did not undergo a preparation course. the limitations of this study are as follows: the scope of this study is limited to activities conducted within a single medical school."}
