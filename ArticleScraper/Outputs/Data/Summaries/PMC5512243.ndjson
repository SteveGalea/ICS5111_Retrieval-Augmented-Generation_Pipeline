{"summary": "arenaviruses have a single-stranded, bisegmented, negative-sense RNA genome. each genomic RNA segment contains 2 open reading frames arranged in an ambisense fashion. the virus encodes only 4 proteins: the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein (GPC) on the S genomic segment. NP acts to prevent induction of type I interferon (IFN) via its ability to degrade double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates that may activate cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors. only a few host factors engaged by NP are known, and the functional importance of these interactions necessitate further investigation. dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), an important antiviral effector, interacts with both the JUNV and LCMV NPs. the replication of both viruses was unaffected by PKR silencing, suggesting that arenaviruses have developed strategies to neutralize this critical arm of the host innate immune response. each NP and its associated cellular protein partners were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by using an NP-specific monoclonal antibody. the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue to allow visualization of the captured NP (bait) as well as its interacting host proteins (prey) a549 or HEK 293T cells were infected with either JUNV Candid #1 or LCMV Armstrong 53b or left uninfected (mock) cells were lysed, and NP was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies. the immunoprecipitated fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and lanes were cut into multiple slices. conserved hits for both viruses, on average, were identified by more spectral counts than those for JUNV NP or LCMV NP alone. to better characterize this subset of proteins, we used the NIH DAVID functional annotation tool (15, 16) to identify functional groups of proteins that may be overrepresented in our data set. the vertical dashed line indicates the threshold above which the 25% most abundant conserved interacting proteins were detected. bioinformatic NIH DAVID functional annotation clustering analysis shows the most highly enriched biological function categories represented in the entire list of interacting proteins.

LCMV NP (bait) was immunoprecipitated from lysates of A549 cells infected (JUNV) or not (mock) with JUNV. associated cellular proteins (prey) were detected by Western blotting. at 72 hpi (JUNV) or 48 hpi (LCMV), immunoprecipitations from infected lysates were performed using either a monoclonal antibody to the C terminus of HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the respective arenavirus NP with a C-terminal HA epitope tag, the TEV cleavage site, and a biotin acceptor peptide. as a control, cells were cotransfected with the BirA plasmid and an empty vector (p0) PKR (bait) and associated viral NP (prey) were detected by Western blotting. data are representative of 2 (A), 3 (B) or 2 (C) independent experiments. PKR and G3BP1 colocalize with JUNV NP. PKR colocalizes with JUNV NP but not with LCMV NP. cells were stained for NP (green) and PKR (red) and visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. the insets show higher-magnification views of the boxed areas. cells were stained for NP (green) and G3BP1 (red) and visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. cells were stained for NP (green) and G3BP1 (red) and visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. expression and phosphorylation of PKR were strongly induced late in infection with JUNV. however, there was an induction of phosphorylation of PKR at 36 and 48 hpi. this suggests an ability of JUNV to prevent activated PKR from phosphorylating its target (eIF2) PKR was highly activated (phosphorylated) in JUNV-infected cells. the activated PKR failed to phosphorylate eIF2. the virus was evading this innate surveillance pathway. cells infected with either JUNV (A to D) or LCMV (E to H) or left uninfected (mock) were transfected with indicated quantities of poly(IC) to induce PKR activation. PKR can also activate alternate signaling pathways. we also probed cellular protein lysates for IB to see if it was degraded following poly(IC) transfection. the observed IB degradation was the result of signaling downstream of other innate immune sensors capable of responding to dsRNA. the majority of cells maintained translation rates that were in the \u201cnormal range\u201d observed for mock-infected cells. however, at intermediate time points following infection with LCMV (24 to 36 hpi) there was a significant increase in cells exhibiting translation rates that were highly reduced compared to those of mock-infected cells. a red dashed line representing the threshold for translational repression was set as the mean level of puromycylation in mock-infected cells labeled with puromycin minus (1.96 SD) n values were as follows: no Puro, n = 44 cells; arsenite, n = 194 cells; mock, n = 191 cells; LCMV 12 h, n = 113 cells; LCMV 24 h, n = 2 strain pan-delNS1 lacking expression of nonstructural protein NS1. protein levels of PKR were greatly reduced in cells transfected with a PKR-specific siRNA compared to those in cells transfected with a scrambled, nontargeting control siRNA. however, when cells were infected with the mutant virus Pan-delNS1, the viral nucleoprotein was expressed at higher levels (8-fold) and significantly more (6-fold) infectious virus was released from supernatants and cellular protein lysates were collected at 16 hpi. protein levels of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) were detected by Western blotting. PKR expression in mock-infected cells was visualized by Western blotting. PKR was knocked down with either of two distinct PKR-specific siRNAs. LCMV NP levels were similarly unaffected by the knockdown of PKR. eIF2 is activated and translation is repressed during LCMV infection. NP protein levels were quantified, normalized to -actin levels, and normalized to the mean NP level in siSCR-transfected cells at 48 hpi. data are presented as mean PFU per milliliter SEM for 2 independent experiments featuring 3 technical replicates each for panels A to C. ns, not significant (P > 0.05); **, P 0.01. Identification of human proteins that associate with arenavirus nucleoproteins. ed with trypsin and extracted for subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Identified proteins were considered valid interactors in a given run when (i) 2 or more unique tryptic peptides were detected from a particular protein in the infected sample but not the mock control. a minimum of 5-fold more total tryptic peptides were detected from a particular protein in the infected sample than from the coomassie blue-stained gels of immunoprecipitated NP from A549 cells (B), LCMV- or mock-infected A549 cells (C), JUNV- or mock-infected HEK 293T cells (D), or LCMV- or mock-infected HEK 293T cells (E) are representative of 2 independent experiments. two important host protein partners involved in translation were the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF2). the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) can lead to arrest of cellular translation in response to viral infection via phosphorylation of eIF2 (17) most abundantly detected (top 25%) conserved protein partners of JUNV candid #1 and LCMV Armstrong 53b NPsa were used for bioinformatic analysis. most abundantly detected (top 25%) conserved protein partners of JUNV candid #1 and LCMV Armstrong 53b NPsa were used for bioinformatic analysis. box polypeptide 5 IPI00017617 12 24 DHX9 DEAH box helicase 9 IPI00844578 32 27 EEF1A2 Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 IPI00014424 16 8 FLNA Filamin A, alpha (actin binding protein 280) IPI00302592 16 77 FLNB Filamin B, beta (actin binding protein 278) IPI00289334 13 21 HADHA Hydroxyacyl IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 1 IPI00009342 14 20 KIAA1618 Chromosome 17 open reading frame 27 IPI00642126 76 3 LMNA Lamin A/C IPI00021405 31 105 MAP1B Microtubule-associated protein 1B IPI00008868 14 10 MATR3 Matrin 3 IPI00017297 12 20 MOV10 Mov10, Moloney leukemia virus 10, homolog (m Ribosomal protein L13 pseudogene 12 IPI00397611 13 13 RPL23 Ribosomal protein L23 IPI00010153 14 19 RPL23A Ribosomal protein L23a IPI00021266 12 15 RPL3 Ribosomal protein L3 IPI00550021 19 14 RPL4 Ribosomal protein L4 IPI00003918 20 9 RPL5 Ribosomal protein L5 IPI00000494 22 17 ietin IPI00216230 4 34 TUBB2C Tubulin, beta 2C IPI00007752 14 8 XRCC5 X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 5 (Ku autoantigen, 80 kDa) IPI00220834 14 13 XRCC6 X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 5 (double-strand-break rejoining, Ku autoantigen, 80 kDa FM1 interacted specifically with JUNV NP but not with LCMV NP. eIF2 interacted weakly with LCMV NP compared to its interaction with LCMV NP. PKR, eIF2, AIFM1 and PKR interacted with both viral NPs. at 72 hpi (JUNV) or 48 hpi (LCMV), immunoprecipitations from infected lysates were performed using either a monoclonal antibody to the C terminus of PKR (bait) or a species-matched control IgG. the associated JUNV NP (C) or LCMV NP (D) prey was detected by Western blotting. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the respective arenavirus NP with a C-terminal HA epitope tag, the TEV cleavage site, and a biotin acceptor peptide. as a control, cells were cotransfected with the BirA plasmid and an empty vector (p0) escence microscopy to determine if PKR and G3BP1 were recruited to the replication and transcription factories of JUNV or LCMV. in LCMV-infected cells at 48 hpi, most cells were infected and displayed a variable pattern of cytoplasmic NP staining. PKR staining was cytoplasmic in both infected and uninfected cells. cells were stained for NP (green) and PKR (red) and visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. fluorescence plot profiles are included to show NP and PKR signal intensities along the white line indicated in the inset of the merge panel. PKR is activated following JUNV infection but does not phosphorylate eIF2. cellular protein lysates were probed for phospho-PKR (T446). both expression and phosphorylation of PKR were strongly induced late in infection. PKR is activated following JUNV infection but cannot phosphorylate eIF2. infected cells were collected during a time course of acute infection. phosphorylated PKR (B and E) and eIF2 (C and F) were quantified. in mock-infected cells, the increased PKR phosphorylation following poly(IC) transfection led to increased phosphorylation of eIF2. however, there was no increase in phosphorylation of eIF2 in LCMV-infected cells following poly(IC) transfection. phosphorylated PKR (T446), total PKR, phosphorylated eIF2 (C and G) and total eIF2, IB (D and H) were quantified and compared using two-way ANOVA. data are presented as mean fold changes SEM for 2 independent experiments featuring 3 technical replicates each. the observed IB degradation was the result of signaling downstream of other innate immune sensors capable of responding to dsRNA. eIF2 phosphorylation observed in LCMV- but not JUNV-infected cells was functionally correlated with repression of global translation in these cells. LCMV is more sensitive than JUNV to PKR-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2. these experiments demonstrate that in most instances, LCMV and LCMV are capable of infecting host cells without inducing a potent global shutdown of translation. cells were either infected with LCMV (n = 2) (A) or JUNV (n = 2) (B), mock infected, or treated with 500 M sodium arsenite. n values were as follows: no Puro, n = 40 cells; LCMV 12 h, n = 113 cells; LCMV 36 h, n = 260 cells; and LCMV 48 h, n = 269 cells. n values were as follows: no Puro, n = 40 cells; arsenite, n = 205 cells; mock, n = 215 cells; JUNV 24 h, n = 161 cells; levels of PKR were greatly reduced in cells transfected with a PKR-specific siRNA compared to those in cells transfected with a scrambled, nontargeting control siRNA. however, when cells were infected with the mutant virus Pan-delNS1, the viral nucleoprotein was expressed at higher levels (8-fold) and significantly more (6-fold) infectious virus was released from cells in which PKR had been knocked down following siRNA transfection. plaque assay (for IAV Pan/99) or focus assay (for IAV Pan-delNS1), the effect of PKR knockdown on viral NP levels and infectious virus released was determined using a two-tailed, unpaired t test. data are presented as mean PFU per milliliter SEM or mean focus-forming units (FFU) per milliliter SEM. LCMV NP levels were slightly increased when PKR was knocked down with one of the two PKR-specific siRNAs. this result suggests that JUNV is capable of completely neutralizing the antiviral actions of PKR. knockdown of PKR had no effect on the release of infectious LCMV. ns, not significant (P > 0.05); **, P 0.01. DISCUSSION The small size of the arenavirus proteome suggests that each viral protein is highly multifunctional. bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant enrichment in proteins involved in protein translation. ylation of these residues leads to full activation of PKR. PKR is then able to phosphorylate eIF2 at serine 51, leading to a global cap-dependent translational shutdown. PKR is activated in cells infected with JUNV or LCMV. PKR is able to phosphorylate eIF2 only in LCMV-infected cells. eIF2 phosphorylation by active PKR is strongly blunted in LCMV-infected cells. a significant proportion of LCMV-infected cells enter a state of translation repression. dsDNA poxvirus vaccinia virus expresses the E3L protein, which prevents PKR from binding to dsRNA. paramyxovirus measles virus antagonizes PKR activation via its nonstructural protein C. this negatively regulates the production of viral dsRNA intermediates during infection. PKR becomes activated but is unable to phosphorylate eIF2. the exact mechanism used by JUNV to antagonize PKR's ability to phosphorylate eIF2 remains unclear. eIF2 is a key event in driving the nucleation of SGs. a related study demonstrated that G3BP1 colocalizes with the arenavirus Tacaribe virus NP during infection (43). arenavirus NPs interfere with other immune pathways responsible for antiviral defense, including the RIG-I/MAVS pathway that drives type I IFN production. arenavirus NPs have been shown to interfere with other innate immune pathways responsible for antiviral defense. arenaviruses appear to be highly selective in their antagonism of these innate immune pathways. this suggests that arenaviruses have coevolved with their reservoir rodents so arenavirus-infected cells can still mount an effective antimicrobial response against other environmental pathogens. eIF4E, the cap-binding component of the eIF4F complex, was not detected in our work, supporting the hypothesis that JUNV and other New World arenavirus NPs can replace the cap-binding function of eIF4E to facilitate translation of viral mRNAs. 8 additional host proteins identified in our screen were previously shown to be required for LCMV and vesicular stomatitis virus replication. HEK 293T/17 cells (CRL-11268) and A549 cells (CCL-185) were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% MEM nonessential amino acid solution, and 1% GlutaMAX. infected cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM containing 1 g/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)\u2013trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.14% bovine serum albumin (BSA) Titers of IAV Pan/99 were determined by an immunological focus assay on MDCK cells. magnetic protein G beads were added to lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. beads were washed 4 times with ice-cold lysis buffer to remove nonspecific proteins. antibody was stripped from the beads into 1 Laemmli buffer, 5% -mercaptoethanol by heating at 100\u00b0C for 5 min. beads were washed 4 times with cold lysis buffer, and interacting proteins were stripped from beads into 1 Laemmli buffer containing 5% -mercaptoethanol. after denaturation, the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE on Novex 4 to 20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels.
