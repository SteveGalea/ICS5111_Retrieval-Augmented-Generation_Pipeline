{"summary": "in developing countries, approximately 2 million deaths (20% of all deaths) of children are due to pneumonia. majority of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in industrialized countries are treated as outpatients with a low mortality rate usually less than 1%. in patients requiring inpatient management, the overall mortality rate increases up to approximately 12%. most CAP-cases are due to infections with S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. most CAP-cases are due to infections with S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. ++1 P. jirovecii +2 + indicates the relative importance of the pathogen and the frequency of isolation in adults or children. a high rate of co-infections with viruses such as influenza A or B as well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is observed in pneumococcal pneumonia. the new millennium added previously unrecognized respiratory viral pathogens to the list of pneumonia-causing agents. human metapneumovirus might be the causative agent in up to 12% of young children suffering from severe respiratory tract illness. human coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and two other isolates (HcoV-NL and HcoV-HKU1) were identified in the last years. veolar type II cells fulfil many known functions, including the regulation of the lung surfactant system [34,36], alveolar fluid content [35], and are important for the replacement of injured type I cells [34,36]. veolar type II cells from different origin in the lung will have a cell-type specific response to a given pathogen. this might be due to varying expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRR), and/or cell-specific protein expression (e.g. surfactant protein inel system detecting particularly but not exclusively invasive pathogens. the ligand for TLR10 has not been identified yet. the ligand for TLR10 has not been identified. odimers composed of TLR2/TLR1 or TLR2/TLR6 recognize lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acid. flagellin, an integral structure of bacterial flagella, is recognized by TLR5. TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) and platelet activating factor receptor displayed an important role in S. aureus induced pneumonia. studies analyzing global responses in pneumonia by using TLR-deficient mice (or C3H/Hej mice), therefore give only limited information on the role of lung epithelial TLR expression in pneumonia. however, most studies published focused on e.g. lethality, global bacterial burden or immune cell recruitment. ic acid and peptidoplycan activated cultured human pulmonary epithelial cells in a TLR2-dependent manner. results obtained with S. pneumoniae-infected epithelial cells indicated a cooperative recognition of these bacteria by TLR1 and TLR2 but not by TLR2 and TLR6. lung epithelial cells were stimulated by flagella of e.g. Bordetella bronchiseptica [88], e.g. Bordetella bronchiseptica [88], e.g. Bordetella bronchiseptica [88], e.g. Bordetella bronchiseptica [88], e.g. bronchiseptica [88]. a common dominant TLR5 stop codon polymorphism leading to impaired flagellin signalling is associated with increased susceptibility to Legionaires' disease [90]. a common dominant TLR5 stop codon polymorphism leading to impaired flagellin signalling is associated with increased susceptibility to Legionaires' disease. a common dominant TLR5 stop codon polymorphism leading to impaired flagellin signalling is associated with increased susceptibility to Legionaires' disease. cytotoxin exoS was shown to activate both, TLR2 and TLR4 signalling. pathogens may modulate expression pattern of TLRs and induce a re-localization of the PRRs. pneumococci increased expression of TLR1 and TLR2 in bronchial epithelial cells. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in the lung has recently been identified as a potential SARS coronavirus receptor. blocking of the renin-angiotensin pathway reduced the worsening of disease induced by injection of Spike protein in mice [100], thus non-classical pathogen-recognizing transmembranous receptors may also be important. a protein-protein interaction mediating caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) is localized. recruitment of the kinase-activity containing adaptor molecule RICK transmits the signal to the NF-B pathway. cytosolic PRRs MDA5 and RIG-I recognize dsRNA leading to a complex signalling pathway. the central NOD (NACHT) domain exhibits ATPase activity and facilitates self-oligomerization. an amino-terminal localized caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) mediates protein-protein interaction. NOD1 is activated by peptidoglycan-derived peptides containing -D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid found in Gram-negative bacteria. membrane recruitment of NOD2 was essential for NF-B activation by muramyl dipeptide [122]. in intestinal epithelium, NOD1 is ubiquitously expressed whereas NOD2 is primarily found in antigen presenting cells and epithelial cells. besides NOD1 and NOD2, additional members of the NLR family may have a role in pneumonia. the higher susceptibility of A/J mice towards Legionella infection has been attributed to sequence differences and reduced expression of the NLR protein Naip5 (Birc1e) dsRNA is produced as an intermediate product during virus replication. in vivo studies in mice carrying a common Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 mutation yielded controversial results regarding functional NOD2/TLR2 interaction. the recognition of PAMPs by PRRs activates a network of signal transduction pathways. most of these pathways function in pulmonary epithelial cells and in classical immune cells similarly in principle. most data have not been verified in human lung epithelial cells or in the lung in vivo. IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4), IRAK1, as well as TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6) are additionally recruited downstream of MyD88 to the receptor complex. a similar signalling module leads to the activation of IRF5 and IRF7. free NF-B molecules translocate into the nucleus and initiate NF-B dependent gene transcription. activation of NOD1 and NOD2 also results in NF-B activation. inflammatory signalling through NF-B in lung epithelium is critical for proper innate immune response to P. aeruginosa. NF-B by airway epithelium selective overexpression of an IB suppressor reduced the inflammatory response upon intranasal application of LPS. cytosolic PRRs RIG-I and MDA5 are also capable to induce IRF3 and IRF7 activation [47,48]. pro-inflammatory signalling induced by several TLRs, as well as NOD1 and NOD2 involves the activation of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38 MAPK [126,145,186]. e.g. in pneumococci- [74,167] or virus-infected [187] lung epithelium. histone acetylases (HATs) may be recruited whereas histone deacetylases (HDACs) may disappear resulting in increased histone acetylation. further modification of bound transcription factor by PRR-mediated MAPK-dependent phosphorylation may be necessary. il8 promotor and subsequent il8 gene expression depended on p38 MAPK-related acetylation (Lys-8) of histone H4 and phosphorylation/acetylation (Ser-10/Lys-14) of histone H3. for this infection, global histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression as well as its activity decreased at the il8 promoter. a complex network of signalling events is started through the recognition of pathogens by lung epithelial cells. a broad variety of purified virulence factors (e.g. flagella [75], LPS [72], LTA [72] and complete bacteria (e.g. S. pneumoniae [74,106,167], P. aerugenosa [62,76], M. catharrhalis [168]) induced the liberation of the chemotactic antimicrobial substances like defensins and cathelicidins secreted by pulmonary epithelium are capable of killing Gram-positive and -negative. antimicrobial substances like defensins and cathelicidins secreted by pulmonary epithelium [203] are capable of killing Gram-positive and -negative. inflamed epithelium may show increased arachidonic acid metabolism. in pneumococci-infected mice lung increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression. in pneumococci-infected mice lung increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression. in pneumococci-infected mice lung increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression. expression of TLR4 on hematopoietic cells and macrophages seemed crucial to initiate the recruitment of neutrophils within the alveolar space [224]. inhibition of the nuclear factor-B pathway in distal lung epithelium lead to reduced neutrophilic lung inflammation and cytokine expression [171,225] transmembraneous and intracellular receptors activated signalling cascades leading to a complex activation status of pulmonary epithelium. pneumonia is a common worldwide disease, causing millions of deaths annually. but central mechanisms of pathogen-lung epithelial interaction are still obscure. limits of pro-inflammatory lung epithelial activation may be due to restriction of PRR expression on epithelial surfaces [69,70], reduced expression of co-signalling molecules (as shown for e.g. MD-2 [249]) the authors apologize for not citing more original manuscripts due to space limitations."}
