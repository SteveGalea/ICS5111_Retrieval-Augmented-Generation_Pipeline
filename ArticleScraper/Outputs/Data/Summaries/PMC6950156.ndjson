{"summary": "porcine circovirus 1 (PCV1) and PCV2 were considered to be the only porcine circoviruses. PCV1 is a cell-culture-derived virus and is nonpathogenic for swine. PCV3 was first reported in the USA in 2016. PCVs, the N-terminus of ORF2 is rich in basic amino acids. the NLS mediates the transport of nuclear proteins into the nucleus. NLSs of PCV1 ORF2 show high homologies to monopartite or bipartite motifs. ORF2-NLS 2,3, ORF2-NLS 1,2, ORF2-NLS 1,3, and ORF2-NLS 1,2,3 fragments were amplified using PCR. all primers and oligonucleotides used are shown in Table 1.

PK-15 cells were grown on tissue culture plates for 24 h. 70\u201380% confluent cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmids. Western Blot After transfection, cells were lysed with 5 SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min before loading onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. proteins were transferred to membranes, followed by incubation with mouse anti-GFP antibody (1:2000) and anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5000). pEGFP-ORF2-1-1 (1\u201310 aa), pEGFP-ORF2-1-2 (8\u201322 aa), pEGFP-ORF2-1-3 (23\u201338 aa) were constructed. pEGFP-ORF2-1-3 was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the nucleus and cytoplasm were extracted from the transfected PK-15 cells. the abundance of expressed proteins in the extracts was detected by western blot. truncated versions of the ORF2-1-2 fragment were cloned using pEGFP-C3. FP-ORF2-1-15 and EGFP-ORF2-1-16 were exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. these results showed that 21RR22, 25RRK27, and 31RR32 in ORF2 (23\u201338 aa) were the key residues of nuclear localization in ORF2-1-3. EGFP-ORF2-NLS2,3 and EGFP-ORF2-NLS1,3 could be localized in the nucleoli. EGFP-ORF2-NLS1,2,2 displayed almost equal nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. mutated fragments of the ORF2 are shown. the NLS region sequence alignment logo showed that only lysine 27 was substituted by the basic amino acid arginine in some strains. the result showed that the NLSs motifs identified in PCVs were similar, especially, the amino acids of nucleolar localization signals. EGFP-ORF2-2, EGFP-ORF2-3, and EGFP-ORF2-4 were located in cytoplasm. this implied that the N-terminal residues (1\u201338 aa) of ORF2 play a role in nuclear localization. three truncation mutants were constructed from ORF2-1. PK-15 cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids and observed by confocal microscopy after 24 h. the abundance of expressed proteins in the extracts was detected by western blot after nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction. the abundance of expressed proteins in the extracts was detected by western blot. EGFP-ORF2-1-13, and EGFP-ORF2-1-14 displayed similar nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. however, EGFP-ORF2-1-15 and EGFP-ORF2-1-16 were exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. these results demonstrated that 21RR22, 25RRK27, and 31RR32 in ORF2 (23\u201338 aa) were the key residues of nuclear localization in ORF2-1-3. map of NLSs in ORF2: NLS1 (8\u201316 aa), NLS2 (16\u201322 aa) and NLS3 (21\u201332 aa) to define the contribution of each NLS motif in its nuclear localization function. EGFP-ORF2-NLS1,2 displayed almost equal nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. the logo of the N-terminal region in all PCV3 ORF2 sequences was created through http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi. the NLS region sequence alignment logo showed that only lysine 27 was substituted by the basic amino acid arginine in some strains. the capsid protein is a karyophilic protein located in the nucleus [14,16] we found that PCV3 ORF2 could also target the nucleus. truncation of truncated PCV3 ORF2 fused with EGFP showed that the 38 amino acids at the N-terminus were necessary. NLS1 and NLS2 are key NLSs in the nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of PCV3 ORF2. the N-terminal of PCV2 ORF2 can interact with the nuclear membrane receptor (gC1qR) to regulate DNA. this suggests that the N-terminal of PCV2 ORF2 may be involved in DNA binding. the PCV1 and PCV2 ORF2 might help regulate viral replication by interacting with Rep in the nucleoplasm [37]. these suggest that nucleolar localization signals in PCV3 ORF2 might be involved in the regulation of viral replication. further studies will be needed to detail the function of nucleolar localization signals."}
