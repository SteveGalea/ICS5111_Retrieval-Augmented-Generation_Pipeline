{"summary": "renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance under physiological conditions. however, it plays a role in pathological processes leading to cardiovascular and other disorders, e.g. hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and kidney diseases. some data suggest the pleiotropic effects of RAAS blockers. recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2), ACE2 activators, angiotensin-(1-7) peptide and non-peptide analogs, aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASIs) and the third and fourth generation of MRAs have been described recently. some of these new compounds are in clinical trials already, which leads us to believe that these new molecules can support the treatment of CVD. therapy with ACE-Is and ARBs prevented decrease in ACE2 expression in myocardial infarcted rats and increased plasma Ang-(1-7) levels. this could be evidence that these drugs are effective not only due to the inhibition of Ang II effects, but also due to the activation of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis of the RAAS. the presence of Ang-(1-7) has been confirmed in the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and liver. Ang-(1-7) exerts its action through stimulation of the specific G-protein coupled Mas receptor. ang-(1-7) is considered a vasodilating and antiarrhythmogenic factor. the protective role of Ang-(1-7) in the cardiovascular disorders of diabetes was also observed. it was demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) attenuates diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats because of vasodilatory, antiproliferative, and antifibrotic properties. however, the therapeutic use of Ang-(1-7) is limited due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. the development of AVE 0991 has been stopped for unknown strategic reasons. despite promising results of experimental studies, the development of AVE 0991 has been stopped for unknown strategic reasons. two peptides, CGEN-856 and CGEN-857, were found during the human proteome analysis. the compounds have no significant homology to Ang-(1-7) or known G-protein coupled receptor ligands. the favorable effects of Ang-(1-7) analogs in clinical trials were confirmed in animal models of CVD. some attempts to make Mas stimulation suitable for clinical use of orally active derivatives of Ang-(1-7) are being made. some of the Ang-(1-7) analogs entered the clinical studies. 63 MRAs (Finerenone) Phase IIa clinical study (ARTS) patients with heart failure associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease. greater selectivity than spironolactone and stronger mineralocorticoid receptor binding affinity than eplerenone 105 Phase IIb clinical study (ARTS-DN) AVE 0991 is a non-peptide, orally active and physiologically well tolerated imidazole derivative. in 2002, the first in vitro study of AVE 0991 took place. it caused approximately five times higher release of bioactive NO compared with Ang-(1-7) anti-hypertensive effect in 2K1C and DOCA hypertensive rats. increased hemodynamics and renal protection in rats with hypertrophy and myocardial infarction. reduced inflammation, renal dysfunction, and glomerulus injury in rats with hypertrophy and myocardial infarction. two peptides, CGEN-856 and CGEN-857, were found during human proteome analysis. amino acid sequence FLGYCIYLNRKRRGDPAFKRRLRD and SMCHRWSRAVLFPAAHRP showed the highest affinity for the Mas receptor. new agents in RAAS Clinical study Results Mechanism of action Ref.

ACE2 produces vasodilator peptides Ang-(1-7) from Ang II (Figure 1). ACE-Is increase angiotensin-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7) levels, which is probably related with the enhanced activation of ACE2.12. ACE2 is activated in the heart ventricles of primary pulmonary hypertension patients. the presented data proves a potential ACE2 role in the prevention of CVD and organ damage provoked by sustained hyperglycemia. it was demonstrated that treatment of Ang II-infused wild-type mice with rhACE2 blunted the hypertrophic response and expression of hypertrophy markers. this reduced Ang II-induced superoxide production and Ang II-mediated myocardial fibrosis. in 2008, two ACE2 activators were discovered: xanthenon (XNT) and resorcinolnaphthalein. XNT is significantly more soluble than resorcinolnaphthalein, thus it was commonly used in in vivo studies. rhACE2 inhibits Ang II-induced superoxide production and Ang II-mediated myocardial fibrosis. rhACE2 partially prevented the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in pressure-overloaded wild-type mice. XNT is significantly more soluble than resorcinolnaphthalein, thus it was commonly used in in vivo studies. the protective effects of XNT were confirmed in various animal models of CVD and diabetes. clinical trials with spironolactone and eplerenone, steroidal MRAs, investigated the potential role of aldosterone and MRAs in a variety of CVD. these trials are a result of clinical interest in the significant function of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system, which became evident after publication the outcomes of two clinical trials. the effects of aldosterone are mediated via classic nuclear receptors (genomic actions of aldosterone) and cell-membrane receptors (non-genomic actions of aldosterone) with alternative pathways (activation of protein kinases or secondary messenger signaling cascades) the effects of aldosterone are mediated via classic nuclear receptors (genomic actions of aldosterone) the IC50 of eplerenone for MR (990 nmol/L) is over 10-fold less than for androgen, progesterone, and estrogen receptors. despite the irrefutable beneficial effects of spironolactone and eplerenone, the use of MRAs is limited by the risk of hyperkalemia. finerenone showed cardiac and renal protection, which was confirmed in preclinical studies in rats. the safety and tolerability of finerenone was studied during the Mineralocorticoid-Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study (ARTS) in patients with heart failure and mild/moderate chronic kidney disease. finerenone is a dihydropyridine derivative without L-type Ca2+ channel activity. it exerts a 3\u201310-fold higher potency and efficacy with IC50 of 18 nmol/L with exceptional selectivity versus the GR. finerenone shows cardiac and renal protection, which was confirmed in preclinical studies in rats. a phase III study for the treatment of chronic heart failure is underway. it is expected that the interaction of novel MRAs with certain coregulators may allow the modulation of MR activity and selectivity. MR modulators, rather selective MR modulators, may be a key factor in proper MR antagonism. antiomer of fadrozole was initially developed as an aromatase (CYP19A1) inhibitor and used as a drug to treat breast cancer. there were also demonstrated potential benefits of FAD286 in the therapy of cardiovascular disorders in different experimental models of CVD and diabetes. the effects of LCI699 on the glucocorticoid axis limit the use of higher doses because of the loss of selectivity for CYP11B2.122. preliminary results from a multicenter, proof-of-concept study are that patients with Cushing disease achieve normal urinary cortisol with LCI699.125 Another LCI699 trial goal was to find the maximumly tolerated dose in this patient population. 129 FAD286 FAD286, the R-enantiomer of fadrozole, was initially developed as an aromatase (CYP19A1) inhibitor and used as a drug to treat breast cancer. there were also demonstrated potential benefits of FAD286 in the therapy of cardiovascular disorders in different experimental models of CVD and diabetes. the effects of LCI699 on the glucocorticoid axis limit the use of higher doses because of the loss of selectivity for CYP11B2.122. preliminary results from a multicenter, proof-of-concept study are that patients with Cushing disease achieve normal urinary cortisol with LCI699.125. sterone synthase and MR for more potent aldosterone antagonism and (b) inhibit the L-type Ca2+ channel for more pronounced antihypertensive effects. there are many clinical studies (RESOLVD, CHARM, ALOFT) showing the efficacy of dual RAAS blockade based on combination of various doses of well-known ACE-Is, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitor. more detailed information about the results of experimental studies with the use of new agents affecting RAAS are enclosed in supplementary files (Supplementary Tables 1\u20133)"}
