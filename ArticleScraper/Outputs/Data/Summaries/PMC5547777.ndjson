{"summary": "we conducted an active, home-based surveillance with a door-to-door census to identify married women of reproductive age during April 2011\u2013September 2013. follow-up occurred every 5 weeks at households where women of reproductive age resided to determine whether a woman had become pregnant. we placed women in the categories of Brahmin (highest caste), Chhetri (higher caste), Vaiysha (working caste), Shudra (lower caste), and Muslim. we calculated the incidence of infection by using days of follow-up from enrollment through 180 days postpartum. we performed analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LLP, College Station, TX, USA) the randomized controlled trial was approved by the University of Washington institutional review board. virus (n = 30), parainfluenza (n = 23), bocavirus (n = 9), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 7), and adenovirus (n = 6). women followed until 180 days after birth. no virus was detected in 137 women; no swab was taken from 452 women. total febrile respiratory illnesses: 767; because of co-infection, the number of total infections is 789. median years of maternal education was 0 (IQR 0\u20138.0) among women with HMPV and 5 (IQR 0\u201310.0) among women without HMPV. three (5.5%) women with HMPV and 108 (3.1%) women without HMPV had smoked in the 30 days before enrollment. most common symptom among pregnant and postpartum participants with HMPV infection was cough (67.3%), followed by rhinorrhea/nasal congestion (58.2%) and myalgia (56.4%). no difference was noted in the presence or duration of symptoms between pregnant and postpartum women. cough was the most common symptom in all illnesses except parainfluenza and RSV. longest duration of symptoms was observed among women with bocavirus and parainfluenza 2\u20134 (7 days) highest severity score was observed among women with bocavirus. only 1 woman\u2019s hospital visit was potentially related to HMPV. she reported 11 days of symptoms and visited the hospital twice and a health post once during her illness. birthweight, kg 2.8 (2.5\u20133.1) 2.8 (2.4\u20132.9) 0.0 (0.1 to 0.1) 0.77 0.1 (0.3 to 0.1) 0.23 Low birthweight 542 (25) 132 (26) 5 (26) 1.0 (0.9\u20131.2) 0.59 1.0 (0.5\u20132.3) 0.91 Gestational age 40 (38\u201341) 39 (38\u201341) 40 (38\u201341) 0.2 (0.3 to 0.1) 0.077 0.2 (0.7 to \u20131.1) 0. in 2 pairs the infant had a positive swab before the mother\u2019s swab.
