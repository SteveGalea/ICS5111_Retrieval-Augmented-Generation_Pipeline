{"summary": "PRV is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae, which can cause severe respiratory, neurological, and reproductive disorders in pigs. the most striking feature in the bartha genome is a 3-kb deletion in the unique short (US) region, resulting in the partial loss of US2, most of US7 (gI), and complete deletion of US9. c cells (cDC), NK cells, T cells, and B cells (8) are interested in the potential role of targeting pDC for vaccination against various (viral) infectious diseases (9\u201311). the absence of the glycoprotein gE/gI complex in the genome of Bartha partly explains this increased TI-IFN response by pDC. the use of pDC-enriched populations to analyze the TI-IFN-producing capacity of pDC is widely established. however, to make sure that the observed results were specifically due to differences in activity of pDC, we have validated some of our results with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) purity-sorted pDC. pDC are characterized by their high CD4 and low CD172adim expression. bartha-infected cells elicited a much stronger IFN- response by pDC. the infected ST cells produce very little IFN- and the observed IFN- responses were derived from the pDC. the observed differences were not due to differences in viral replication between the virus strains. the experimental setup for these assays was similar to the experimental setup to determine pDC-mediated IFN- responses. in brief, ST cells were infected with PRV 151 or 152, the inoculum was removed at 2 h postinfection (hpi), and pDC were added. monocytes incubated with noninfected ST cells did not trigger a GFP signal. the absence of gE/gI contributes to the hyperactivating effect of PRV Bartha on pDC. to this end, ST cells were infected with Becker or Becker mutant strains with mutations that correspond to parts of the deletion that affects 4 genes in the US region. Performing experiments in 8 biologically independent pigs invariably leads to natural pig-to-pig variability in terms of TI-IFN production by pDC. this has been shown before by other groups working with porcine pDC (18, 19) the data are shown in Fig. 4B and confirm the data from Fig. 4A. pDC compared to the WT Becker strain are indicated (*) (B) pDC compared to the WT Becker strain were harvested at 12 hpi (C) or 24 hpi (D) and subjected to Western blot analysis for viral protein gB (infection control [100 kDa]) and -tubulin (loading control [57 kDa]) the deletion contributes partially to the hyperactivating effect of PRV Bar supernatant was collected at 24 hpi, and levels of IFN- were determined by ELISA. bars represent the mean standard deviation (SD) of duplicates from 1 pig. expression of gE in PRV-infected cells suppresses TI-IFN response by pDC. pDC showed a statistically significant increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in pDC using gE Becker compared to wild-type PRV. results show that gE expression in infected cells modulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in pDC. this modulation correlates with the ability of gE to suppress TI-IFN production. ST cells were either mock infected, infected with the Becker WT (Be WT) or Becker gE (Be gE) strain. at 14 hpi, pDC were harvested, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-Erk) depletion of monocytes (CD14+ fraction) followed by enrichment of the myeloid cell population (CD172a+ fraction) led to a 20- to 30-fold increase in pDC, leading to a population with 2 to 6% pDC. the use of pDC-enriched populations to analyze the TI-IFN-producing capacity of pDC is widely established. bartha-infected ST cells induced substantial IFN- production by pDC. responses by pDC elicited a much stronger IFN- response by pDC. the observed IFN- responses were derived from the pDC. pDC and monocytes were coincubated with noninfected ST cells. as expected, monocytes incubated with PRV 151- or PRV 152-infected ST cells did not trigger a GFP signal. at 2 hpi, the inoculum was removed, and freshly isolated monocytes (A to C) or pDC (D to F) were added. we found that PRV strains lacking viral proteins that are essential for host cell infection also induce adequate IFN- responses. the absence of gE/gI contributes to the hyperactivating effect of PRV Bartha on pDC. deletions in US2 and US9 did not significantly affect IFN- levels. experiments in 8 biologically independent pigs invariably leads to natural pig-to-pig variability in terms of TI-IFN production by pDC. data were generated from 8 different pigs. the data represent the mean SEM fold change in IFN- production by pDC for each strain relatively to the IFN- production observed using wild-type Be (set to 1.0) the interferon production profiles of enriched and purified pDC populations are highly similar. ST cells were infected with Becker WT, Becker gE, or the vaccine strain Bartha. they were coincubated with freshly isolated enriched (MACS) or purity-sorted pDC populations. bars represent the mean standard deviation (SD) of duplicates from 1 pig. supernatant was collected at different time points. pDC showed a statistically significant increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in pDC. gE expression in infected cells modulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in pDC. pDC populations were coincubated with ST cells that were mock infected. pDC were harvested, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-Erk) at 14 hpi, pDC were harvested, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-Erk) pDC may get into contact with infected epithelial cells and fibroblasts. the potential of the attenuated PRV Bartha vaccine to induce a strong TI-IFN production may contribute to the efficacy of this highly successful vaccine. the attenuated Bartha PRV strain triggers a much stronger TI-IFN response by pDC compared to WT PRV strains Kaplan and Becker. wild-type PRV strains encode pDC evasion strategies that are mutated or absent in bartha. pDC contain several surface receptors to inhibit the production of TI-IFN. gp120 protein of HIV (BDCA-2), hemagglutinin of human influenza virus (NKp44) and glycoprotein E2 of HCV (BDCA-2) have been shown to interact directly with a pDC inhibitory receptor. PRV gE has been reported to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation (20, 21) in primary porcine T cells and in epithelial cells, gE is associated with reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in pDC. this suggests that gE may lead to activation or suppression of the ERK1/2 signaling axis, depending on the cell type and perhaps other circumstances. PRV vaccine strain Bartha elicits a much more robust TI-IFN response in pDC than WT PRV strains in vitro. our findings point to a role for the gE/gI glycoprotein complex in suppression of TI-IFN production by pDC. goat anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgG2b, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, the mouse IgG1 and IgG2b isotype controls PE-conjugated streptavidin, and the LIVE/DEAD stain SytoxBlue were purchased from Life Technologies. PRV BaBe is a 1967 field isolate with subsequent laboratory passage in cell culture (59).
