{"summary": "inactivated vaccines can be given to people with weakened immune systems without the serious complication of opportunistic infection. however, the immune responses induced by inactivated vaccines are mainly humoral. live attenuated vaccines are more effective in inducing protective immune responses in vaccinated individuals. a mixture of plasmids encoding a plethora of immunogenic genes can potentially be used to generate broad-spectrum vaccines. however, DNA vaccine may induce antibodies against DNA. such vectors have a more favorable safety profile than live attenuated virus vaccines, while having better immunogenicity than inactivated vaccines. BV is released from the host cells for cell-to-cell infection. the BV is produced during early stages of infection, whereas the ODV is produced during late stages of viral infection, becoming concentrated in the nucleus and occluded within polyhedra. in this review, we describe the immune responses elicited by recombinant baculovirus displayed vaccines against various infectious diseases. we explore the unique strategies used to enhance the protective immunity against baculovirus displayed antigens.

BacSC influenza virus has been considered an ever-present threat to humans, causing annual epidemics and infrequent pandemics. a traditional influenza virus vaccine, while effective at managing infections, faces severe challenges. limited vaccine production capacity, long production time, poor growth properties of selected vaccine strains are some major issues limiting vaccination production. recombinant subunit vaccines targeting HA were developed using an insect cell expression system. previously, a trivalent recombinant HA influenza vaccine was approved by the US FDA. however, the need for a high dose with adjuvants and vaccine purification issues pose major setbacks in the development of recombinant subunit vaccines. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) protein and measles virus receptor can be independently displayed on the viral envelope. a modified Bac-HA64 vaccine was developed by employing baculovirus p10 and cytomegalovirus p10. an immunization study on the vaccine vector system revealed superior or equivalent immune responses against HA compared to other vaccine forms. the immune response is mediated by interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via the major histocompatibility II (MHC-II)-mediated antigen presentation pathway. conventional vaccines induced humoral responses against only homologous strains and provided inadequate protection against heterologous strains. mucosal adjuvant heat-liable enterotoxin B (BV-Dual-3M2e-LTB) mice inoculated with BV-Dual-3M2e-LTB vaccine induced higher levels of mucosal antibodies and more efficient cellular immunity against different H5N1 clades. mice with depleted CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells displayed reduced lung viral titers. mice immunized with baculovirus possessing the additional elements induced higher levels of HA-specific IgG and IgG2a, higher hemagglutination inhibition titers, and better Th1 and IFN-+/CD8+ T-cell responses. role of WPRE and ITRs (inverted terminal repeats) in enhancement of HA expression and their effect on induction of humoral and cellular immune responses was studied. vAc-HA-Dual vaccine was more effective in inducing HA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response in vitro. vAc-HA-Dual vaccine was more effective in inducing HA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response in vitro. the second generation of tetravalent baculoviral vaccine was developed using GP64-SP, HA-TM, and GP64-CTD. it displays HAs from four subclades of H5N1 influenza viruses and induces strong humoral and cellular immunity against homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains. recombinant baculovirus showed HA displayed on the baculovirus surface has high HA activity. baculovirus pseudotyped with VSVG (BV-G-HA) was shown to successfully transduce into mammalian cell, mediate gene delivery, and enable efficient expression of H5HA. immunized chickens demonstrated complete protection from a lethal dose of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus [26]. current monovalent inactivated whole virus vaccine can induce neutralizing antibodies against the homologous strain but shows lower magnitude of response against heterologous strains the level of systemic immunity induced by oral bivalent vaccine in immunized mice was lower compared to subcutaneous immunization. however, mice orally immunized with live or inactivated bivalent vaccine showed strong HA-specific mucosal IgA response. oral vaccination induced potent cross-clade neutralizing antibodies against distinct clades (1, 2.1.3, 2.2.1.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.4, 4, 7, and 9) of H5N1 viruses. recombinant baculoviral vector expressing both VSV-G and influenza HA was shown to evoke both humoral and cellular immune responses. the high cytotoxicity of VSV-G protein and its immediate inactivation by serum complement systems impede the use of the element in a vaccine delivery vehicle [99] chimeric HA constructs expressing the globular head and stalk regions showed broad protection against homologous and heterologous H5N1 subtype viruses. since 1918, none of these poultry-adapted viruses has evolved to widely infect humans or cause a pandemic. avian H7 influenza virus was responsible for numerous influenza outbreaks among poultry industries in Europe and North America. intranasally immunized mice with live baculovirus showed HA vaccine induced higher or comparable humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses. recombinant baculovirus-based vaccine (BacHA) against avian H7N9 virus with high pandemic potential was generated. differences in immunogenicity of HA of H7N7 (NL03) and HA of H7N9 may be due to amino acid changes at A143T, which introduced a potential glycosylation site at position 141N. by site-directed mutagenesis, they generated six mutant constructs by single or double amino acid substitution at these positions. recombinant baculovirus with CMV-polyhedrin dual promoter for expressing chimeric HA of H9N2 was shown to efficiently express HA in both mammalian and insect cells. recombinant baculovirus with GP64-CTD (cytoplasmic domain of GP64) incorporates HA to the viral envelope more efficiently than Bac-HA, which expresses HA with HA-CTD (cytoplasmic domain of an immunization study on the vaccine vector system revealed superior or equivalent immune responses against HA compared to other vaccine forms. the immune response is mediated by interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via the major histocompatibility II (MHC-II)-mediated antigen presentation pathway. conventional vaccines induced humoral responses against only homologous strains and provided inadequate protection against heterologous strains. mice with depleted CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells displayed reduced lung viral titers. a second vaccine had an additional mucosal adjuvant heat-liable enterotoxin B (BV-Dual-3M2e-LTB) a second vaccine had an additional mucosal adjuvant heat-liable enterotoxin B (BV-Dual-3M2e-LTB) mice immunized with baculovirus possessing the additional elements induced higher levels of HA-specific IgG and IgG2a, higher hemagglutination inhibition titers, and better Th1 and IFN-+/CD8+ T-cell responses. the role of WPRE and ITRs (inverted terminal repeats) in enhancement of HA expression and their effect on induction of humoral and cellular immune responses was studied. vAc-HA induced higher levels of IgG and IgA compared to mice vaccinated with vAc-HA-DUAL. stimulation of splenocytes in immunized mice with HA-specific peptide triggered Th2 immune response for vAc-HA-immunized mice. the second generation of tetravalent baculoviral vaccine was developed using GP64-SP, HA-TM, and GP64-CTD. the vaccine displays HAs from four subclades of H5N1 influenza viruses and induces strong humoral and cellular immunity against homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains. recombinant baculovirus showed HA displayed on the baculovirus surface has high HA activity. recombinant baculovirus pseudotyped with VSVG (BV-G-HA) was shown to successfully transduce into mammalian cell, mediate gene delivery, and enable efficient expression of H5HA. immunized chickens demonstrated complete protection from a lethal dose of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus [26]. current monovalent inactivated whole virus vaccine can induce neutralizing antibodies against the homologous strain but shows lower magnitude of response against the level of systemic immunity induced by oral bivalent vaccine in immunized mice was lower compared to subcutaneous immunization. however, mice orally immunized with bivalent-Bac-HA vaccine showed strong HA-specific mucosal IgA response. oral vaccination induced potent cross-clade neutralizing antibodies against distinct clades. recombinant baculoviral vector expressing both VSV-G and influenza HA was shown to evoke both humoral and cellular immune responses. the high cytotoxicity of VSV-G protein and its immediate inactivation by serum complement systems impede the use of the element in a vaccine delivery vehicle [99] chimeric HA constructs expressing globular head and stalk regions showed broad protection against homologous and heterologous H5N1 subtype viruses. avian H7 influenza virus was responsible for numerous influenza outbreaks among poultry industries in Europe and North America. since 1918, none of these poultry-adapted viruses has evolved to widely infect humans or cause a pandemic. baculovirus displayed HA vaccine against H7N7 (NL03) was developed. it was tested via intranasal (i.n.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) administration in mice. recombinant baculovirus-based vaccine (BacHA) against avian virus with high pandemic potential was generated. the differences between the immunogenicity of HA of H7N7 (NL03) and HA of H7N9 may be due to amino acid changes at A143T, which introduced a potential glycosylation site at position 141N. by site-directed mutagenesis, they generated six mutant constructs by single or double amino acid substitution at these three positions. recombinant baculovirus with CMV-polyhedrin dual promoter for expressing chimeric HA of H9N2 was shown to efficiently express HA in both mammalian and insect cells. recombinant baculovirus with CMV-polyhedrin dual promoter for expressing chimeric HA of H9N2 was shown to provide 100% protection against lethal homologous mouse-adapted virus. shrimp vaccinated with Bac-VP28 immersion vaccine showed 75% and 68.4% survival rates compared to 100% mortality obtained with the control group in a challenge study. the results confirm that oral vaccination of Bac-VP28 triggers the innate immune responses and, possibly, was responsible for higher survival rates. recombinant baculoviruses possess good safety profiles and have been used to develop vaccines against PRRSV, CSFV, and PCV2 viruses. a swine vaccination study showed that this vaccine candidate stimulated potent GP5 and cap-specific neutralizing antibodies and induced higher lymphocyte proliferation responses compared to control groups. baculoviruses that displayed ORF2a, ORF3 and ORF4a pose a biohazard threat. a recombinant baculovirus-based vaccine contains the PCV2 cap and VSVG protein (BV-GD-ORF2) was developed. the expression of PCV2 was placed under the control of CMV and polh promoters. BV-GD-ORF2 behaved as a subunit/DNA vaccine and induced robust cap protein-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. recombinant baculovirus vaccines showed reduced immune pathological conditions in mice. four constructs were developed: Bac-tF64 (displays the F ectodomain (tF) on the envelope), Bac-CF (expresses full-length F protein in transduced mammalian cells) and Bac-CF/tF64-VISA (contains additional virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA gene) BV-RVG/RVG-immunized mice showed higher humoral and cellular immune responses compared to mice immunized with other vaccine candidates. enhanced immunogenicity could be due to immediate recognition of RVG incorporated into BV-RVG/RVG by immunocompetent cells, resulting in presentation to dendritic cells. recombinant baculovirus 71 (EV71) immunogenic capsid protein (VP1) is a non-membrane protein. membrane proteins like HA or NA (neuraminidase) can be translocated to the plasma membrane and incorporated onto the envelope. Bac-VP1 contains 3-fold higher VP1 (39 ng/g) on its envelope compared to VP1 on Bac-Pie1-gp64-VP1 envelope (13 ng/g) mice elicited stronger VP1-specific antibody responses and cross-neutralization activity against homologous or heterologous strains. VP1 provided 100% protection against a mouse-adapted lethal strain of EV71. baculovirus surface-displayed his6-tagged VP2 protein using GP64 TM and CT domains (BacSc-VP2) and avian reovirus (ARV). baculovirus surface-displayed VP2 of CPV-2 induced higher neutralizing antibodies in mice compared to other vaccines tested. the recombinant baculovirus-based vaccine displayed rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (PbCSP) the vaccine induced both humoral and cellular immune responsea and provided 60% protection against sporozoite challenge. recombinant baculovirus dual expression-based malaria vaccine was developed. mice showed high levels of Pfs25-specific antibodies and effective transmission-blocking response. a rabbit immunization study showed the vaccine induced significant transmission-blocking response. intranasal and intramuscular immunization of mice with AcNPV-PyMSP119surf induced mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses and provided 100% protective efficacy. intranasal immunization elicited higher PyMSP119-specific antibodies and stronger natural boosting after a challenge study. human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) was incorporated into a baculovirus vector, which effectively displayed hDAF and PFCSP on the surface of the baculoviral envelope. after intramuscular immunization, the modified vaccine conferred higher protective efficacy (60%) compared to control group (30%) in a challenge study. the abundance of CpG motifs in the baculovirus improves its ability to induce innate immune responses through the TLR9/MyD88-dependent endosomal recognition pathway. intranasal inoculation of mice with wild-type baculovirus provided protection against H1N1, H3N2, and other influenza B strains. mice intranasally immunized with live Bac-HA showed complete protection against both H7N7 and H7N9 infection. intranasal immunization of recombinant baculovirus-displaying HA of H5N1 virus induced high levels of mucosal IgA and serum IgG immune responses. oral polio vaccine against highly contagious poliovirus helped eradicate poliovirus infection in most parts of the world. studies have shown that oral vaccination can prevent infection of lungs and is capable of inducing mucosal immune responses (IgA) premanand et al. used naturally occurring lipid-based vesicles (bilosomes) as a mucosal adjuvant to coat the recombinant baculovirus (Bac-VP1). Bac-VP1, associated with bilosomes, induced higher VP1-specific immune responses. no adverse effects of baculovirus on human health have been observed in safety tests. environmental and ecological impacts of the baculovirus in invertebrates will be reduced by modification of baculovirus essential genes required for replication and budding."}
