{"summary": "fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a common procedure performed in immunocompromised patients with undiagnosed pulmonary pathology. a retrospective review of all patients who underwent FOB with BAL from 01/01/2010 to 12/31/2011 at an academic medical center was performed. the patients' medical records were screened for the presence of conditions associated with a compromised immune system. such conditions included the presence of a hematogenous or solid organ malignancy for which the patient was currently receiving chemotherapy within 14 days of bronchoscopy. a febrile patient was defined by the presence of a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C or greater within 48 h of FOB. all BAL fluid was collected via FOB performed by members of the division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center. the patients had a new finding of pulmonary infiltrate(s) and were selected for FOB with BAL at the discretion of the attending physician. the RVP (Luminex xTAG, Viracor-IBT Laboratories, Lee\u2032s Summit, MO, USA) is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test designed to detect common respiratory viruses. this RVP has been shown to have exceptional sensitivity when used in BAL samples. 133 patients underwent 150 separate FOB with BAL during the 2-year study period. 47 patients were receiving chemotherapy, seven patients had HIV, and five patients had autoimmune disease. some of the patients who underwent stem cell transplantation subsequently had a relapse of their underlying malignancy and were undergoing chemotherapy. 107 patients had diffuse infiltrates involving two or more lobes (71.3%) there was no difference in diagnostic yield between focal and diffuse infiltrates. infiltrates where abnormality was extra-alveolar had a lower diagnostic yield than those where the abnormality was bronchiolar or alveolar in location. immunocompromised patients with fever and chest symptoms have a higher diagnostic yield from fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage than asymptomatic patients. complications occurred as a result of 11 of our cohort of 150 bronchoscopies, with a complication rate of 7.3%. the number needed to harm with bronchoscopy was 13.6. patients with fever and symptoms of chest infection are more likely to have an infectious cause of their pulmonary imaging abnormality than those without symptoms, which explains the higher diagnostic yield. reticular and nodular infiltrates occur within the interlobular or intralobular septa and the bronchovascular interstitium. not all patients in our study underwent high-resolution CT imaging. we found a significant difference in diagnostic yield based on the lobe of the lung. this finding may reflect the evolving population of immunocompromised patients, and their infectious etiologies. the focus of our study was to evaluate the ability of BAL to diagnose pulmonary complications of immunosuppression. however, this study was performed without the aid of now widely available assays that improve diagnostic yield from BAL."}
