{"summary": "the exact mutations and mechanisms of host shifting have been studied in emerging zoonotic viruses such as influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus (7, 8). these viruses are capable of generating and maintaining substantial genetic variation (11, 12) this variation fuels adaptation, and selective sweeps leave genetic marks of past ecological history in viral genomes. this kind of serial emergence allows for the possibility of host range mutations themselves to play a significant role in shaping the landscape of further emergence. the model RNA virus Pseudomonas double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bacteriophage 6 investigated the role of extant host range mutations on further host range expansion. RESULTS Mapping P3 P. syringae pv. atrofaciens mutational neighborhood is highly genotype dependent. 50 host range mutant plaques were isolated for each of the three genotypes (6-WT, 6-E8G, and 6-G515S) 8G isolates, 100% in 6-G515S isolates, make this the most prevalent mutation conferring infection of P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. there was a noticeable drop in diversity of single host range mutations from the 6-E8G and 6-G515S populations. several published works have investigated the mutational neighborhoods of 6 p3 during expansion of host range. two sites were favored by host range expansion events onto P. pseudoalcaligenes and P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. each 6 population was raised to high titer on its most recent host (6-WT on P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and both 6-E8G and 6-G515S on P. syringae pv. tomato) and plated on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens to obtain a lysate made of 400 host range mutant plaques. change in Shannon entropy was calculated to determine the sites that became more or less variable after overnight growth on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. all single mutations identified in the three genotypes underwent noticeable entropy changes after gaining the P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range. the x axis corresponds to the nucleotide positions on the medium segment. positions labeled correspond to amino acid positions in aligned genes. the x axis corresponds to the nucleotide positions on the small segment. p12 K115T 1 F176L 3 V186L 1 K192R 1 Q8R 1 p9 P4P 1 Q8R 1 p5 K54R 1 Estimation of P. syringae pv. atrofaciens mutational neighborhood of 6-WT. the most likely estimate of the true mutational number is 67 (95% confidence interval, 35 to 99) an increase in detectable polymorphism was observed for 6-E8G. the numbers of SNPs detected in the 6-E8G population grown on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens were significantly higher. pairwise unique SNPs above 0.1% frequency in 6 populations SNP type and/or location No. of SNPs by organism and typea 6-WT 6-E8G 6-G515S P. pseudoalcaligenes P. syringae pv. atrofaciens S NS S NS S NS Noncoding 14 20 4 29 7 8 Coding 23 44 19 54 8 20 39 67 7 24 12 16 Small segment P8 2 4 0 1 0 1 the total number of unique SNPs for 6-WT grown on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens is 54, which is less than the estimated 67. the nonsynonymous SNPs in the four genes now implicated in P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range expansion total to 39. 6-WT obtained an A133V mutation on p3 (two-tailed one sample t test, P = 0.66) but each significantly increased its fitness on P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. same-color genotypes share same genetic background (6-WT, gray; 6-E8G, yellow; 6-G515S, green). 34 out of 50 sequenced 6-WT p3 sequences had single nonsynonymous mutations. 2 had double mutations, 13 had no detectable mutations on the p3 gene. the remaining two clones had double mutations consisting of A133V. several published works have investigated the mutational neighborhoods of 6 p3 during expansion of host range. it is assumed that they are distributed on the mutational neighborhood (circles) in a nonrandom way. the absence of host range mutations in p3 for 13 of the 6-WT P. syringae pv. atrofaciens isolates was unexpected since 97% of previously independently isolated host range mutants had nonsynonymous mutations in p3. this motivated a more in-depth approach: deep sequencing to map the entire mutational neighborhood. each 6 population was raised to high titer on its most recent host (6-WT on P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and both 6-E8G and 6-G515S on P. syringae pv. tomato) and plated on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens to obtain a lysate made of 400 host range mutant plaques. nonstructural protein genes p12 (encoding the morphogenic protein) and p9 (encoding the major membrane protein) were the most probable sites of additional host range mutations; both genes are involved with viral nucleocapsid vesiculation of the host inner membrane. results from deep sequencing of the p3 gene and of the entire genome further confirmed the constrained neighborhood of host range mutants 6-E8G and 6-G515S. non-p3 6-WT mutant sequencing matched many of the sites with the highest change in Shannon entropy we observed on the small segment of deep-sequenced 6-WT populations. ten of the 13 isolates contained a single nonsynonymous mutation in p12. the most likely estimate of the true mutational number is 67 (95% confidence interval, 35 to 99) a similar analysis could not be conducted for the two isogenic mutants because the frequencies of their one or two possible mutations is inappropriate for this analysis. surprisingly large number of low-frequency SNPs for 6-WT raised on P. syringae pv. phaseolicola demonstrated the potential of a dsRNA virus with a 13-kb-long genome that grows 5 generations in overnight plaque growth. this may also be the reason the 6-WT is more able to readily infect P. syringae pv. atrofaciens with a high P. syringae p the total number of unique SNPs for 6-WT grown on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens is 54, which is less than the estimated 67. the total number of unique SNPs for 6-WT grown on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens is 54, which is less than the estimated 67. nonsynonymous SNPs in the four genes now implicated in P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range expansion total to 39. this is within the 95% confidence interval predicted for the estimate of the complete mutational neighborhood. some of these detected SNPs may be part of the P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range mutational neighborhood. same-color genotypes share same genetic background (6-WT, gray; 6-E8G, yellow; 6-G515S, green); error bars are standard deviations. DISCUSSION Epistasis plays a large role in viral evolution. 6-WT was grown on the highly productive host P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. the two mutants could not be grown on P. syringae pv. phaseolicola without risking reversion of their P. syringae pv. tomato host range mutations. descendants would face identical constraints when infecting the P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host. this is one of few (or the only) P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range mutations in P3 that improves the mutant\u2019s P3 structure and function. nes in the 6-G515S population reverting (S515G) while fixing a P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range mutation. this suggests that the G515S mutation is a relatively deleterious mutation to maintain in the genome when it is not grown on P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. for 6-WT, 10 of the 13 clones that did not have a mutation in P3 had one of five nonsynonymous mutations in P12. this would require 6-WT to be able to attach and infect P. syringae pv. atrofaciens but fail to show its infection through a plaque assay. then mutations in a number of genes could boost the infectivity of 6 to cause successful plaque formation. pv. atrofaciens host range-associated mutations in p12, p9, or p5 may prove useful as a small segment marker for genetic crosses in 6. existing mutational markers on the small segment are an easily reverted temperature sensitivity and an unstable genetic insertion (61, 62). the top three most frequently observed P3 mutations in 6-WT showed the largest change in entropy. this pattern does not apply to other observed host range mutations. membrane protein P9, enveloped lytic protein P5 and membrane morphogenic protein P12 are known to affect 6 thermal niche expansion (44) it is not uncommon for nonstructural genes that are not on the exterior of the virion to be a host range determinant. it is rarer for nonstructural genes that are not on the exterior of the virion to be a host range determinant. 6-WT on hosts closely related to its original host P. syringae pv. phaseolicola (56) it is known that DNA phage can attach to more hosts than they can productively infect, often due to successful host defense mechanisms such as CRISPR-Cas, restriction endonucleases, and suicide of the infected cell prior to phage maturation (57) studies have exclusively used deep sequencing for population SNP detection (70, 71) both clonal sequencing and population deep sequencing had merits and shortcomings. wild-type 6 (ATCC no. 21781-B1) and its standard laboratory host, P. syringae pathovar phaseolicola strain HB10Y (ATCC no. 21781) were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD) these were streaked from glycerol stocks originally obtained from G. Martin (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), and L. Mindich (Public Health Research Institute, Newark, NJ) at least 106 PFU of phage was plated on novel host P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. five of the 6-G515S P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range mutant plaques isolated. -titer lysates were determined on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens to assess the P. syringae pv. atrofaciens mutation frequency within the population\u2019s standing genetic diversity. the four clones of 6-WT were also incubated for a shorter length of time (4 h) to assess the mutation frequency within the population\u2019s standing genetic diversity. two hosts were mixed (20:1, P. syringae pv. phaseolicola to P. syringae pv. phaseolicola) to generate the bacterial lawn as 6-WT can only infect P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. mutants can infect both hosts creating clear plaques. 6-WT, 6-E8G, and 6-G515S were raised on their most recent hosts to obtain high-titer lysates. each plaque was estimated to contain at least 106 PFU. each plaque was estimated to contain at least 106 PFU. approximately 33.75% to 66.88% of the NGS reads mapped to the Pseudomonas bacteriophage 6 genomes. all virus genome positions had above 1,000 read coverage, except the large segment of 6-G515S. change in Shannon entropy shows the polymorphism at each site in the genome through absolute base coverage from deep sequencing. the SNPs in each protein-coding gene were considered independent observations for a paired t test. raw sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI under BioProject accession number PRJNA485986. lysates were tested for the existing P. syringae pv. atrofaciens host range. at least 106 PFU of phage was plated on novel host P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. four independent clones of 6-WT, 6-E8G, and 6-G515S plaques were raised to high-titer lysates (22 to 24 h overnight incubation) on host P. syringae pathovar phaseolicola (6-WT) or P. syringae pathovar tomato (6-E8G and 6-G515S) the four clones of 6-WT were also incubated for a shorter length of time host range mutant to the common competitor (CC) in the mixtures were obtained by counting the PFU of the initial mix (day 0) and after 24 h of growth (day 1). r e l a t i v e f i t n e s s = 10. PCR products were cleaned up using EXO-SapIT (US Biological, Swampscott, MA), and Sanger sequencing was performed by Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ) mutations were identified with Sequencher, version 4.10.1. individual RNA samples at a final concentration of 15 ng/l were prepared for Illumina RNA libraries using a TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, CA) single-ended 150-cycle deep sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq housed in foran Hall, Rutgers University (SEBS Genome Cooperative). change in Shannon entropy was calculated by subtracting values before growth on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens (Xb) from values after growth on P. syringae pv. atrofaciens (Xa) changes in polymorphic base composition at each site in the genome through absolute base coverage from deep sequencing."}
