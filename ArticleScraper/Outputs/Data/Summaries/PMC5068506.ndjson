{"summary": "SAFV belongs to the species Cardiovirus B, the genus Cardiovirus, and the family Picornaviridae (1\u20133). after its initial identification, SAFV was extensively detected or isolated from fecal or throat swab samples from infants with acute gastroenteritis. a/176/2008 strain was isolated from a throat swab from a patient with upper respiratory tract inflammation (12) both strains showed mild neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation into neonatal ddY mice. the two isolates infected glial cells and neural progenitor cells, but not large neurons, in the brains and cerebella of neonatal ddY mice. thelial (LLC-MK2) cells were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles. the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min. the titers of the stock viruses were expressed in 50% cell culture infective doses per milliliter. ten percent (wt/vol) tissue homogenates of the collected cerebella were prepared in 2MEM. the cerebellum homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min. 10 l of supernatant was used as the inoculum in the next passage. cells were infected with 150 l of the supernatant. on day 3 p.i., five cerebella were collected from neonatal mice. 10 l of the supernatant (termed 1Cb) was inoculated intracerebrally into the next group of neonatal mice within 24 h of their birth. ified DNA products were purified with a monoFas DNA purification kit I. the nucleotide sequences were analyzed with Sequencher software. Molecular models of the VP1, -2, and -3 proteins on the virion surface of the AM and AM-5Cb strains were constructed. ddY outbred albino strain of mice showed good reproductive performance, growth, and susceptibility to SAFV-3. ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally within 24 h of birth with 104 CCID50s of the AM or AM-5Cb strain in 10 l of 2MEM. neonatal ddY mice were sacrificed by excess isoflurane anesthesia. they were perfused with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin injected directly into their hearts. the whole head, including the brain, was immersed in a formalin solution overnight. polyclonal antibody against anti-AM strain of SAFV-3 (21) was purified with the Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification kit. peroxidase activity was detected with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. goat anti-rat antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (for Musashi-1), and goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (for GFAP and GLAST) were used as secondary antibodies. the sections were incubated with the antibodies for 30 min at room temperature before being mounted with slowFade gold antifade reagent. sections were incubated with anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes) for 2 days at 4\u00b0C. the sections were then incubated in Omnipaque 350 with 1% Triton X-100 for 12 h. the resultant images were captured from four areas in each mouse. the widths of the Purkinje and molecular layers were measured at four sites within one area (four areas per mouse;16 sites/mouse) the main dendrites of Purkinje cells were extracted digitally with the tracing application of neurolucida software. the main dendrites extracted from 4 to 10 Purkinje cells were measured under high-power field magnification. the inoculated cells were examined twice within 2 weeks. the detection limit was 101.5 CCID50s/g of tissue. the total RNA of tissue homogenates from the virus-inoculated mice was extracted with an RNeasy Plus minikit (Qiagen) RT-PCR Test, primers, and probe Genome sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) Real-time RT-PCR for Saffold virus Forward AAACCATGCCACAAACACCAT Reverse GCCYTGACCAACTACCCACAT Probe (FAM-TAMRA) CTTGCCGAYACACGTGACCCACA Real-time RT-PCR for murine Hes5 Forward CCTGAAACAACACCAT Reverse GCCYTGACCAACTACCCACAT Probe (FAM the AM strain was obtained from the CSF of a patient with aseptic meningitis in 2008. the virus-infected LLC-MK2 cells were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles. the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min. five neonatal mice within 24 h of birth were inoculated intracerebrally with 104 CCID50 of the AM strain in a volume of 10 l. the cerebellum homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min and 10 l of supernatant was used as the inoculum in the next passage. neonatal mice (n = 5) were inoculated intracerebrally at 104 CCID50s/10 l with SAFV-3 (AM strain) collected from a patient with aseptic meningitis. after centrifugation, 10 l of the supernatant (termed 1Cb) was inoculated intracerebrally into the next group of neonatal mice within 24 h of their birth. RT-PCR was performed with the oneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and specific primers (18, 31) the PCR-amplified DNA products were purified with a MonoFas DNA purification kit (GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and then sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) astrocytoma (U-251 MG), neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) and rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank. each cell line was cultured in six-well culture plates and then inoculated with the AM or AM-5Cb strain in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection. 12 neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 2MEM. they were inoculated within 24 h of birth with 106 CCID50s of the AM-5Cb strain in 10 l of 2MEM. these mice were observed for clinical manifestations, and their body weights were measured daily for 19 days. antigen retrieval was performed with a retrieval solution (pH 6) (Nichirei Biosciences) at 121\u00b0C for 10 min in an autoclave. a polyclonal antibody against the anti-AM strain of SAFV-3 (21) was purified with the Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification kit. the sections were incubated with the first monoclonal antibody against Musashi-1, GFAP, or GLAST, followed by incubation with the calbindin polyclonal antibody or antiserum against the SAFV-3 antigen. all secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Life Technologies Corporation. fixed-tissue slices were immersed in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C, incubated in blocking solution for 1 h, and then incubated with anti-rabbit antibody for 3 days at 4\u00b0C. the sections were then incubated in Omnipaque 350 with 1% Triton X-100 for 12 h. the reconstructed Purkinje cell layer in the three-dimensional images was used for assessments of Purkinje cell morphology with the neuron tracing program of Neurolucida. the widths of the Purkinje and molecular layers were measured at four sites within one area. the main dendrites extracted from 4 to 10 Purkinje cells were measured under high-power field magnification. the brain samples (except neonatal mouse cerebella) were homogenized with a Bio Masher II (Nippi, Incorporated, Tokyo, Japan) and diluted in 2MEM to yield 10% homogenates. after centrifugation at 8,000 g for 5 min, the supernatants from the homogenates were used for titration in LLC-MK2 cells. the second round of PCR was conducted for 3 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min (40) real-time RT-PCR for Saffold virus Forward AAACCATGCCACAAACACCAT Reverse GCCYTGACCAACTACCCACAT Probe (FAM-TAMRA) CTTGCCGAYACACGTGACC Real-time RT-PCR for murine GL intergroup comparisons were performed with unpaired t tests, one-way analysis of variance, or two-way ANOVA. RESULTS Mouse-passaged SAFV-3 acquired three amino acid mutations. the genome of the AM-5Cb strain had five nucleotide differences from that of the AM strain. first-passage 1Cb strain showed one amino acid substitution, at position 239 (AM, Q; 1Cb, R) of the VP2 protein. one amino acid mutation at position 62 (AM, K; 5Cb, M) of the VP3 protein was obtained in the fifth-passage 5Cb strain. 3-62M and VP2-160R mutations can alter the structural dynamics of the receptor binding surface via the formation of a novel hydrophobic interaction. structural alterations may affect the binding affinity of the receptor for the virus or antibodies. medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma RD were infected with the AM or AM-5Cb strain. after inoculation with the AM or AM-5Cb strain, all human cells showed a CPE, including cytolysis and degeneration, indicating they were susceptible to these viruses. neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally with the AM or AM-5Cb strain of SAFV-3. the rate of weight gain by the AM-5Cb-inoculated neonatal mice was lower than that of the 2MEM-inoculated control mice during the observation period. neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally at 104 CCID50s/10 l with SAFV-3 derived from a case of aseptic meningitis (AM strain) one AM-inoculated mouse showed mild neurological signs, including rolling and ataxia from days 7 to 9 p.i., while others showed obvious rolling and ataxia from days 2 to 4 p.i. perivascular inflammation (C, dotted frame in inset) is observed in the cerebellar medulla of AM-5Cb-inoculated mice (C, right side) but not in that of AM-inoculated mice (C, left side). a value represents the number of animals positive for viral antigen/number of animals positive for degeneration. proliferation and immune response to mouse-passaged SAFV-3 in neonatal ddY mice. we determined viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers in the brains of AM- and AM-5Cb-inoculated mice. both the cerebrum/brainstem and cerebellum of the AM-5Cb-inoculated neonatal mice had significantly higher viral titers than those of the AM-inoculated mice on day 3 p.i. the numbers of viral RNA copies per mouse (B) were measured in the cerebrum/brainstem and cerebellum on days 3, 7 and 21 p.i. with the SAFV-3 strains (104 CCID50s/10 l; n = 4 per day). the brains of mock-infected mice were used as a negative control. neonatal ddY mice were intracerebrally inoculated with the AM or AM-5Cb strain at 104 CCID50s/10 l. degenerated neural cells are present in the cerebral ventricles and cerebella of AM- and AM-5Cb-inoculated mice. in vivo passage did not alter the neurotropism of the AM strain in neonatal mice. we speculated that the hydrocephalus observed after AM-5Cb infection might be an obstructive hydrocephalus. however, the outcome of SAFV-3 infection of the cerebellum remains unclear. infection of Bergmann glial cells affects cerebellar development. the viral antigen-positive GLAST+ glial cells in the cerebellum are associated with the elongation of Purkinje cell dendrites. the interaction between Bergmann glial cells and Purkinje cells activates the Notch signaling pathway. expression levels of genes associated with Bergmann glial cells (A) and Purkinje cells (B) were then determined on days 3, 7 and 21 p.i. (n = 4 per day) the expression levels of genes associated with Bergmann glial cells (A) were then determined on days 3, 7 and 21 p.i. (n = 4 per day) neonatal ddY mice were used for high-resolution fluorescence imaging. three-dimensional images of sections of the cerebellar layer at a depth of 50 m were acquired with a 0.46-m step size in the z direction. the stack images were acquired with a 0.46-m step size in the z direction. all four infected mice showed morphological changes in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum compared with control mice. all four AM-5Cb-inoculated mice showed hydrocephalus and small cerebella. inflammatory cell infiltration and mild necrosis also observed in the cerebellum medulla. the arbor vitae of the cerebellum appear normal in the mock neonatal mouse at day 19 postinjection with 2MEM. hydrocephalus of the cerebral cortex and small cerebella are evident in all four AM-5Cb-inoculated neonatal mice. b values represent the number of animals positive for viral antigen/number of animals positive for viral antigen/number of animals positive for viral antigen/number of animals positive for inflammatory reactions. the genome of the AM-5Cb strain had five nucleotide differences from that of the AM strain. one amino acid mutation at position 62 (AM, K; 5Cb, M) of the VP3 protein was obtained in the fifth-passage 5Cb strain. the number of viral RNA copies in each supernatant of the cerebellum homogenates during the serial passages was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. the models were constructed by homology modeling based on the X-ray-derived crystal structure of the virus particle of the TMEV DA strain. substituted residues in the AM-5Cb strain indicated are H160R at the loop of the VP2 alias puff B structure, Q239R at the loop of VP2 and K62M at the loop in the VP3 knob structure. all human cells showed a CPE, including cytolysis and degeneration. compared with the AM-5Cb strain, the strain showed stronger growth in ONS-76 cells. however, human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were less susceptible. neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally with the AM or AM-5Cb strain of SAFV-3. the rate of weight gain was lower than that of the 2MEM-inoculated control mice during the observation period. the AM-5Cb-inoculated mice showed neurological symptoms, including ataxia, running, rolling, or staggering, from days 2 to 9 p.i. ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally at 104 CCID50s/10 l with SAFV-3 derived from a case of aseptic meningitis (AM strain) or with mouse-passaged SAFV-3 (AM-5Cb strain) one AM-inoculated mouse showed mild neurological signs, including rolling and ataxia from days 7 to 9 p.i. original magnifications, 20 (B1), 400 (C), and 1,000 (B2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 and all insets) bars, 20 m (B) and 50 m (C) TABLE 2. Tissue distribution of viral antigen and inflammatory reactions following the intracerebral inoculation into neonatal ddY mice. both the cerebrum/brainstem and cerebellum of the AM-5Cb-inoculated neonatal mice had significantly higher viral titers than those of the AM-inoculated mice. the levels of viral RNA in both the cerebrum/brainstem and cerebellum of AM-5Cb-inoculated mice on day 3 p.i. were higher than those of AM-inoculated mice on day 3 p.i. the expression levels of mouse type 1 IFN-4 and - (C) were determined on days 3, 7 and 21 p.i. (n = 4 per day) the brains of mock-infected mice were used as a negative control. ddY mice were intracerebrally inoculated with the AM or AM-5Cb strain. degenerated neural cells are present in the cerebral ventricles and cerebella of AM- and AM-5Cb-inoculated mice. in vivo passage did not alter the neurotropism of the AM strain in neonatal mice. we speculated that the hydrocephalus observed after AM-5Cb infection might be an obstructive hydrocephalus. however, the outcome of SAFV-3 infection of the cerebellum remains unclear. both the AM and AM-5Cb strains infected Bergmann glial cells but not Purkinje cells. the interaction between Bergmann glial cells and Purkinje cells activates the Notch signaling pathway. the expression level of the gene for Hes5 was significantly higher than that in 2MEM-inoculated mice on day 3 p.i. we evaluated the morphology of cerebellar Purkinje cells in AM- and AM-5Cb-inoculated mice in three-dimensional images of sections of cleared tissue stained with anti-calbindin antibody. the lengths of the main dendrites of Purkinje cells of AM-5Cb-inoculated mice were significantly shorter than those of control mice. the stack images were acquired with a 0.46-m step size in the z direction. the width of the Purkinje cell layer and the molecular layer of the stack images at a 50-m depth were determined with Neurolucida software. all four AM-5Cb-inoculated neonatal mice showed hydrocephalus and small cerebella. the arbor vitae of the cerebellum were not apparent in the mice. inflammatory cell infiltration and mild necrosis were also observed in the cerebellum medulla. hydrocephalus of the cerebral cortex and small cerebella are evident in all four AM-5Cb-inoculated neonatal mice (upper right side of panel A). the cerebellar cortex of the mock-inoculated mouse can be divided into three layers: the molecular layer, the Purkinje cell layer, and the granular layer (left side of panel B). TMEV isolates show various degrees of neurovirulence in mice. the highly neurovirulent strain causes lethal encephalomyelitis upon acute infection of neurons. the low-virulence strain persistently infects oligodendrocytes. the cardiovirus and Enterovirus genera have five distinctive structures on the capsid protein. the puff A and puff B regions of VP2 and the knob region of VP3 are putative phenotypic determinants. neutralization escape is related to structural alterations in the puff B region of VP2 and the knob of VP3 (62) a large number of Bergmann glial cells were infected with the AM-5Cb strain and died because of disruption of the balance in the interactions between Bergmann glial cells and Purkinje cells. the loss of Bergmann glial cells after AM-5Cb infection induced repair reactions in the undifferentiated neural progenitor cells, causing overexpression of the gene for Hes5. parvovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and border disease virus infections induce hypoplasia of the cerebellar cortex. these viruses infect Purkinje cells, neural progenitor cells, or astroglia in the cerebellum to repress translocation of immature nerve cells. the neurovirulence of SAFV-3 in mice is unique compared with that of other picornaviruses and other neurovirulent viruses."}
