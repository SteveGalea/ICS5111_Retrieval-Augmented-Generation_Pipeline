{"summary": "a group of 36 medical, veterinary, and wildlife experts in zoonoses prioritized 36 diseases using a semi-quantitative One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool. the tool comprises five steps: listing of zoonotic diseases to be prioritized, development of ranking criteria, weighting criteria by pairwise comparison through analytical hierarchical process. the top five priority diseases in descending order of ranking were anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, bru zoonotic diseases are better characterized and tend to attract more attention and investments in prevention and control among policy makers nationally and internationally compared to endemic zoonotic diseases that heavily impact rural communities in developing countries. prioritization of diseases using either qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative techniques is a key management tool in informing resource allocation. prioritization of zoonotic diseases was carried out through a facilitated consultative process involving 36 experts in zoonoses from the public health (n = 19), animal health (n = 15) and wildlife health (n = 2). about 20% of the zoonoses experts selected by their institutions had not previously participated in ZDU activities. list of 30 zoonotic diseases populated by experts as diseases relevant to Kenya during the formation of the ZDU in 2012. participants reviewed the list to include all zoonotic diseases that are suspected or known to be present in the country in the last 20 years (1995\u20132015) the list includes all zoonotic diseases that may not be present in the country. the \u2018epidemic potential of zoonotic disease\u2019 was found to be a more robust measure of public health impact than \u2018ease of animal to human transmission\u2019. participants argued that \u2018bioterrorism\u2019 is of much lesser relative importance in our setting as opposed to developed countries where there is low burden of zoonotic diseases. 1% (0); 1\u20135% (1); 5\u201310% (2); 11\u201330% (3); >30% (4) How many counties are affected by the Zoonotic Disease. a semi-quantitative analytic hierarchy process was used to assign the most important criteria the highest weight, and the least important criteria the lowest weight. a consistency ratio of 0.01 or less was considered satisfactory. participants were provided with available epidemiologic data on each of the diseases from both published and unpublished literature. to assign each of the diseases a measure of severity of illness in humans, case fatality rate (CFR) in untreated patients and the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were used as proxy measurements. each group then score each zoonotic disease independently based on the answers to the categorical questions for each weighted criterion. in the absence of any published data from the region, expert opinion was used to assign a disease to a level. for each disease, the weighted scores for each criteria were summed to obtain a total weighted score by group. prioritization tool Quantitative data on zoonotic diseases in Kenya is only available for a select few diseases. a semi-quantitative tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was used. tularemia, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis were added to the list. participants included anti-microbial resistance (AMR) pathogens due to the potential transmission of AMR microbes or resistance genes from livestock to humans. tularemia, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis were removed from the list. 0\u20130.025 (0); 6\u201320% (1); 21\u201350% (2); >50% (3) What is the disability weight of the Zoonotic Disease, based on WHO Global Burden of Disease classification. a semi-quantitative analytic hierarchy process was used to assign the most important criteria the highest weight, and the least important criteria the lowest weight. a consistency ratio of 0.01 or less was considered satisfactory. a set of categorical questions against each of the criteria were developed. each of the categorical questions had either binomial (e.g. yes/no) or multinomial answers. information on zoonotic diseases associated with trade restrictions was derived from a list of transboundary diseases by the world organization for animal health. diseases on this list such as RVF, anthrax and Q-fever were scored \u2018yes\u2019 while those not on the list such as Ebola, WNV and CCHF were scored a \u2018no\u2019 on the question on restrictions in trade. five criteria were given equal weights of 1 to obtain normalized scores for each disease. each of the five groups was removed to assess the impact each group had on the final normalized scores. the final list of diseases to be prioritized included 36 diseases/pathogens. the top five priority diseases in descending order were anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, brucellosis and RVF. viral and bacterial zoonoses made up 60% of zoonotic pathogens at 36.1% and 25% respectively. zoonoses caused by helminths were 13.9%, protozoan and fungi 8.3% each. infections with a CFR of >50% such as Ebola, Marburg, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and rabies were scored highly and diseases/events with a CFR 5% including RVF, brucellosis, salmonellosis and AMR scored lower. endemic zoonotic diseases are reported in humans and animals annually. high scores were assigned to diseases such as anthrax, RVF, rabies, Q-fever, dengue fever and brucellosis. high scores were assigned to diseases that had not been reported in Kenya or reported less than 1% prevalence in less than two counties. there were minimal changes in disease ranking for the first five diseases on the final ranked disease list except when severity of illness was excluded. trypanosomiasis dropped three levels (ranked 6th) and non-typhi salmonellosis moved up two levels (ranked 4th). anthrax was ranked first regardless of weight of criteria and group contribution. neglected zoonotic diseases in Kenya were anthrax, trypanosomiasis/HAT, rabies, brucellosis, and hydatidosis. five diseases (anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, brucellosis, and hydatidosis) listed as neglected zoonotic diseases by WHO. the disease priority list in the Netherlands was mostly endemic diseases including toxoplasma gondii, campylobacter species and Coxiella burnetti. the prioritization work provided an opportunity to update the zoonotic disease list with inclusion of newly reported zoonotic diseases/events in Kenya such as MERS CoV and antimicrobial resistance. sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the weight of the criteria, the criteria used, and individual groups did not have significant bias in our final ranking of the prioritized disease list. this could likely be due to the systematic use of data provided for the groups, similar nature of the criteria and questions developed by the groups. osomiasis in livestock caused by Trypanosome species that are largely non-zoonotic is associated with high economic impact that resulted in high ranking of this disease. outbreaks of anthrax are associated with dramatic clinical disease events that render them easier to report and document."}
