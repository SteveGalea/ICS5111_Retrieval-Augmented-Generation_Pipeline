to describe advances in pathogen discovery and epidemic modeling that aim to predict and prevent future public health threats. the article is being used a national or international level for the prediction, detection and control of emerging infectious disease threats. event-based surveillance is a complimentary method to traditional indicator-based surveillance. event-based surveillance relies on routine reporting by healthcare facilities of structured pre-defined information regarding events and diseases. the majority of data regarding first reports of infectious diseases currently derives from informal sources like media reports and the Internet. systems are Argus, HealthMap (www.healthmap.org/en/), EpiSPIDER (www.epispider.net) and bioCaster. despite some overlap, these systems are complimentary since they differ in the ways information is acquired, the sources and languages used, the degree of automation and human analysis. the world health organization (WHO) and the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) all use both traditional surveillance methods and informal event-based data for biosurveillance. national surveillance programs have been reluctant in incorporating event-based systems and their application during real-time health events has been limited. early warning alert and response networks (EWARN) combine indicators and event-based methods to detect changes in event trends or alerts that could represent potential threats to public health. information collected through EWARN systems is disseminated to national and international public health officials allowing them to monitor disease spread. a large volume of search queries is needed for web search-based surveillance tools. these may be more effective when applied to diseases with moderate to high prevalence and when used in developed countries with high numbers of web users. the world is divided in approximately 3300 subpopulations (according to geographical census areas) forming a network. disease dynamics are then integrated into the subpopulation and mobility network, building a framework where large numbers of in-silico epidemic scenarios can be generated. in a resource-poor environment, mobility patterns can be different than those observed in resource-rich countries. compared to temporally structured daily contacts, temporally unstructured daily routines resulted in a substantial increase of the epidemic size. investigators found that screening of departing travelers would likely be the most efficient measure to promptly identify individuals with symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease. the freely available open-source epidemic modeling software FRED uses census-based synthetic populations and can be used by public health officials to evaluate potential intervention policies during epidemic scenarios affecting a specific population. a gravity model was constructed during the cholera epidemic in Haiti. it examines the interactions between spatial entities in a certain ecosystem. changes in climate or landscape ecology may alter the spatial spread of a disease present at an ecosystem. study results were compared to the actual WNV incidence rate in humans in 2012 validating the model's predictive accuracy. this approach could improve surveillance efficiency, signal early warnings for areas at increased risk for disease transmission and thus trigger prompt initiation of preventive efforts. advances in pathogen discovery and diagnostics have provided the means for enhanced pathogen discovery. rapid development and declining cost of new molecular techniques has provided the means for enhanced pathogen discovery. advances in microbiological surveillance have provided the means for enhanced pathogen discovery. non-invasive approaches could prove useful in detecting an increase in disease incidence rate in animal populations at regions of human-animal interface. using satellite imaging to collect information on sea temperature and surface height and chlorophyll A levels, researchers were able to construct an environmental model that could accurately predict the actual incidence rate of a cholera outbreak in Bangladesh. mobile phone technology is being used for infectious diseases surveillance purposes. mobile phones allow for a 2-way sharing of information and can be used for data-collection to serve surveillance purposes and for disseminating important public health information. integrating the one-health paradigm offers a platform for building common core capacities for animal and human disease surveillance. international collaboration is essential for the detection, prevention and control of an emerging infectious disease outbreak with potential for global spread. early detection needs to be coupled with a rapid public health response. the significance of GPHIN was highlighted during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak when it issued the first alert of unusual respiratory illness in Guangdong Province, China. other widely used event-based systems are Argus, HealthMap, EpiSPIDER and bioCaster. syndromic surveillance features the acquisition and statistical analysis of pre-diagnostic data (i.e. chief complaints, groups of symptoms), can also be very useful in resource-limited settings where laboratory confirmation may be lacking. limitations of syndromic surveillance methods include discrepancies between chief complaint and actual diagnosis. the healthcare electronic surveillance network allows for rapid outbreak detection, communication between the command center and the hospitals and response to a potential public health threat. a main objective of public health surveillance systems is to provide early warnings regarding emerging threats to human health. the alert and response system was able to detect a rise in cholera cases in hard-to-reach communities with poor access to health centers. web-based tools for real-time surveillance Web queries are increasingly being used as a source for syndromic surveillance. the majority of data regarding first reports of infectious diseases events currently derives from informal sources like media reports and the Internet. the global public health intelligence network (GPHIN) is one of the most important event-based surveillance systems that systematically scans a multitude of such informal sources. in countries with weak or nonexistent national public health surveillance systems event-based methods can provide real-time information on local disease activity. syndromic surveillance features the acquisition and statistical analysis of pre-diagnostic data (i.e. chief complaints, groups of symptoms), can also be very useful in resource-limited settings. a public web tool (http://www.smittskyddsinstitutet.se under Surveillance statistics) is available where timely county and national surveillance data for more than 50 communicable diseases can be openly accessed. a centralized and dedicated electronic surveillance system was developed recently by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia in order to monitor disease activity during the Hajj. an alert and response system was developed by the pan-american heath organization. it was able to detect a rise in cholera cases in hard-to-reach communities. the alert and response system was able to detect a rise in cholera cases. agent-based models require detailed data entry for each individual in the population of interest. compared to coarse-grained input data, the size of the epidemic is more accurately reproduced and at risk groups are more appropriately identified. the complexity of air-transportation network is a major determinant of the global spread of infectious diseases. it is possible to predict epidemic patterns and to test containment scenarios. the progression of an infectious disease epidemic depends on intra-city mobility patterns. study used global positioning system (GPS) data to track the detailed mobility patterns of 582 individuals in Iquitos, Peru. compared to temporally structured daily contacts, temporally unstructured daily routines resulted in a substantial increase of the epidemic size and effective reproductive number in an ILI simulation model. limits or controlling human mobility is one of the first measures applied by national and international public health institutions. ramework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics is a flexible modeling platform that uses census-based synthetic populations. it can be used by public health officials to evaluate potential intervention policies during epidemic scenarios affecting a specific population. parameters such as transmission characteristics and natural history of the disease, vaccine and treatment access and availability can be applied and modified by the user. a gravity model examines the interactions between spatial entities in a certain ecosystem. change in climate or landscape ecology may alter the spatial spread of a disease present at an ecosystem. a modeling framework may help determine relevant risk factors or evaluate preventive and control measures. study results were compared to the actual WNV incidence rate in humans in 2012 validating the model's predictive accuracy. limitations in the predictive value of large-scale infectious diseases modeling include a) incomplete understanding of human mobility patterns and their multi-scale interactions. genome wide sequencing, multiplex PCR and microarray technology are all being used for syndromic surveillance, microbial discovery and the study of population host factors that determine disease susceptibility. 4,5,61 Molecular methods are also used to create evolutionary models for the study of viral host-switching and microbial host adaptation. hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreaks are more challenging to predict due to the dynamics of vector ecology and human behavior. close monitoring climatologic parameters (i.e. rise in sea surface temperature and protracted rainfall) and vegetation and soil indices is critical to evaluate changes that could contribute to infectious disease outbreaks. social media analysis of data collected through social media applications presents new opportunities as well as challenges in emerging infectious diseases surveillance. foodborne Chicago (www.foodbornechicago.org) is a social media-censoring program launched by the Chicago Department of Public Health to monitor foodborne illnesses. the lack of equipment and diagnostic capability hampers emerging infectious diseases surveillance efforts. the availability of real-time surveillance data on the internet for health care policy makers to access is essential for an early and efficient response to an epidemic. collaboration between institutions, organizations, scientists and public health networks involved in infectious diseases surveillance is vital to timely detect and respond to novel threats."}
