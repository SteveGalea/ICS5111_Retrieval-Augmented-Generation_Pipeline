{"summary": "IFNs are pleiotropic functional cytokines with antiviral, antitumor, and natural immune-boosting effects. IFNs play a significant role in eliciting an antiviral state in vertebrates. despite morphological diversity, IFNs share integrated, interconnected, and a precisely coordinated cascade in immunity pathways. despite morphological diversity, IFNs share integrated, interconnected, and a precisely coordinated cascade in immunity pathways. chIFN- treatment ameliorates infection progression in chickens with highly pathogenic influenza A virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1. chIFN- has also been shown to elicit moderate antiviral response in both the chicken macrophage cell line HD11 and primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) Bm5 cells were cultured and maintained at 27 \u00b0C with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) in TC100 media containing FBS. TC100 media without FBS was used to wash the cells twice and a mixture of transfection and co-transfection was introduced to cells. chIFN- genes were optimized for expression in the silkworm (Bombyx mori) and synthesized by GenScript Company (China) chIFN- genes were optimized for expression in the silkworm (Bombyx mori) luciferase assay kit (Promega, USA) was used to analyze expression quantity of luciferase in 50 g of protein lysate. antiviral activity of chIFN- was assayed in the GFP-reduction assay. phate buffer saline (PBS) was injected intramuscularly to the control group. a total of five immune organs (bursa of Fabricious and thymus) were pooled (in duplicates) from randomly selected chicken from each virus-infected or mock-treated group. gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the clusterProfiler R package. GO terms with adjusted p-values 0.05 were considered significantly enriched (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). a stretch of sequences demonstrating high sequence identity was identified and characterized. all sequences (avian and mammalian IFN-) including Sus scrofa (pig) [NP_001159962.1], Bos taurus (cattle) [NP_001268830.1], Mus musculus (mouse) [NP_796370.1], Gallus gallus (chicken) [XP_015144667.1], and Xenopus tropicalis (f expression system was employed to construct chIFN-. chIFN- genes were optimized for expression in the silkworm. recombinant virus containing the chIFN- gene was harvested 4\u20135 days post co-transfection. a total of 60 newly hatched SPF chicks were obtained from Beijing Arbor Acre Company Ltd., P.R. China. a treatment group of 14-day old chicks were injected daily with chIFN- (10,000 IU/kg body weight) RNA-seq Quality RNA-seq generated from CEF, bursa of Fabricious and thymus samples of chicken are presented in Supplementary Table S1. reads were mapped to the reference genome database (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-89/fasta/gallus_gallus/dna/). chIFN- encodes a putative protein of 186 amino acids. chIFN- shares 36%, 34%, 39%, 34% and 33% sequence similarity with recently characterized pig, mouse, human, cattle, and frog IFN- respectively. after four to five days, protein was harvested from silkworms. 50 g protein from lysed larval haemolymph was subjected to luciferase assays. luciferase assays confirmed chIFN- gene expression in beVS. chIFN profiled the gene expression in immune organs (thymus and bursa) and compared it with that in primary chicken fibroblasts using RNA-Seq. out of 26,616 genes, 161 were DEGs (84 upregulated and 77 downregulated) a conventional approach (qPCR) and show a scenario corresponding to the RNA-seq data. a significant upregulation of crucial cytokine and chemokine genes (IL1-, CCL4, CCL5 and CX3CL1) was observed. a lower level of antiviral activity is observed as compared to type-I IFNs. KEGG pathway enrichment was seen in pathways including the MAPK signaling pathway (FOS/IL1B/FOSB), the toll-like receptor signaling pathway (FOSB, IL8L1, IL1B, FOS, CCL5), influenza A (IL8L1/IL1B/CCL5), salmonella infection (FOSB/IL8L1/IL1B/CCL5), the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (RYR2), and the calcium signal chIFN-treated bursa of Fabricius, chIFN-treated thymus. chIFN- encodes a protein of 186 amino acids. chIFN- shares 36%, 34%, 39%, 34% and 33% sequence similarity with recently characterized pig, mouse. chIFN- shares characteristic features of type III IFNs. luciferase gene was acquired from pGL3-Basic vector. luciferase gene was acquired from pGL3-Basic vector. gene expression in chicken embryo fibroblasts and organs of live chickens. transcriptomes from the bursa of Fabricious and thymus were compared with the control group to identify differentially expressed genes. differences in DEGs observed in the present study control cellular architecture, immune function, metabolic pathway, and muscular function. a total of 23,801 genes were expressed between the chIFN-treated and non-treated thymus. in the bursa of Fabricious, 289 out of 23,951 genes were differentially expressed. a relatively low number of genes overlapped among these three groups. chIFN- have particular significance in viral infections of epithelial origin. they are optimally active by eliciting a broad antiviral state. the chIFN- have particular significance in viral infections of epithelial origin. KEGG pathway enrichment was seen in pathways including the MAPK signaling pathway (FOS/IL1B/FOSB), the toll-like receptor signaling pathway (FOSB, IL8L1, IL1B, FOS, CCL5), influenza A (IL8L1/IL1B/CCL5), cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interactions (CCL20/IL8L1/IL1B/CCL5), salmonella infection (FOSB/IL8L pathway enrichment associated with chIFN- treatment. chIFN is biologically active in both CEF (in vitro) and live chickens (in vivo) IFN- is structurally peculiar as it possesses five exonic regions located on chromosome 1 of the human genome. this is in agreement with human IFN- subfamily which are anatomically identical by possessing five exonic regions on chromosome 1 of the human genome. an important gene involved in the host response of infected samples is RSAD2. viperin is one of the potent interferon stimulated genes responsible for eliciting a broad antiviral state against a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. chemokines are secreted chemotactic cytokines that play a fundamental role in the recruitment and migration of lymphoid and myeloid cells in target tissues. chemokines are secreted chemotactic cytokines that play a fundamental role in the recruitment and migration of lymphoid and myeloid cells in target tissues. oylated lipopeptide from mycoplasma synoviae activated TLR15. it regulated innate immune responses against bacterial and viral pathogens. chIFN- has been seen to cause delay in viral excretion and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) NF-KB is the most significant, evolutionarily conserved, pleiotropic, inducible transcription factor responsible for regulating genetic expression in a variety of fundamental processes. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is a transcription factor complex highly responsive for cytokine signaling and growth promotion. this complex activates AP-1-dependent genes, hence controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. our data suggest that significant antiviral, cell cycle regulators, and biologically active genes are expressed in response to administered chicken IFN. functional characterization of these vital genes warrants further investigation to determine the future possible role for recombinant chicken IFN."}
