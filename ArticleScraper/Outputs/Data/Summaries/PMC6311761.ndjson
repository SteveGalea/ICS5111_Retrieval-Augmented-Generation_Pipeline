{"summary": "extensive research in the last three decades has clarified myriads of misconceptions and explored leading roles of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many viral diseases. a wide range of the reactive species (RS) is produced as a result of the metabolic process in the body. these RS can be reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) most of the oxidative processes take place in the mitochondria in an effort to generate energy. more than 90% of total ROS in eukaryotes is produced by the mitochondria [17] most of the consumed oxygen is converted to water in the electron-transport chain (ETC) by the cytochrome c oxidase without any contribution to ROS production. hypoxic condition activates the XO by the posttranslational modification of xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) these changes lead to the excessive production of O2 and H2O2. viral particles like proteins or nucleic acids are recognised by the pattern recognition receptors. pathogens are recognised by the immune system leading to the production of O2 in the phagosome and outside the cells by the process of oxidative or respiratory burst. the process of ROS production is critical to promote cellular responses. the OH radicals are produced from O2 by Fenton reaction. birds have a multilayered and well-defined antioxidant system. it is comprised of catalases (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutaredoxins. nonenzymatic antioxidants are always produced in the body. there are four different selenium-dependent forms of GSH-Px in birds. the hydroperoxides and H2O2 are converted to the H2O and O2 by using the GSH. CAT perform the same function (Figure 1). guanine moiety most frequently undergoes oxidation by the RNS and ROS due to its lower reduction rate. Oxidation of adenine may be the initial site; however, it is repaired by the neighbouring guanine leading to the production of highly mutagenic 8-hydroxyguanine. 8-nitroguanine induces transversion of G:C to T:A in the DNA. reactive species also increase the mutation rate in viruses, particularly RNA viruses. ROS and RNS react with mDNA leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. oxidative stresses can affect proteins in a variety of ways both directly or indirectly. methionine oxidation and nitration are mediated by O2, ONOO, and NO to form bityrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine. these oxidised proteins undergo proteolytic digestion and proteasomal degradation. the 3-nitrotyrosine severely affects the microtubule structure leading to functional impairments in the cell. oxidation of lipids is catalysed by different enzymes like lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, and cytochrome P450. polyunsaturated fatty acids and low-density lipoprotein are the major targets of oxidation leading to cellular and tissue damages. antioxidants, like vitamin E, can dismiss the propagation step of lipid peroxidation. vitamin E radical can be converted to nonradical vitamin E in the subsequent reaction by the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or glutathione. malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), hexanal, and propanal are the most studied. excellent reviews have been published on the oxidative damage to DNA [16, 40, 41]. the production of OH radicals from the O2 by Fenton-type reaction reacts with the double bond of the 5,6-pyrimidine and 7,8-purine nucleobases leading to the formation of radical intermediates. the abstraction of hydrogen from the thymine and 5-methylcytosine results in more complex reactions. oxidative stresses can affect proteins in a variety of ways both directly or indirectly. oxidative stresses can affect the proteins in a variety of ways both directly or indirectly. oxidative stresses can affect the proteins in a variety of ways. ROS removes hydrogen atom from cysteine residue leading to formation of thiyl radical. thiyl radical reacts with second thiyl radical to form disulphide bond and sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids. oxidative damage is the addition of oxygen to methionine residue. the oxidation process of lipids is catalysed by different enzymes like lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, and cytochrome P450. oxidation of lipids with ROS produces aldehydes, which react with proteins, nucleic acids, and other hydrocarbons. in the last stage of lipid peroxidation, two LOO react with each other to form. vitamin E radical can be converted to nonradical vitamin E in the subsequent reaction by the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or glutathione. malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), hexanal, and propanal are the most studied. production of ROS is increased from the granulocytes and macrophages. the direct antimicrobial action includes oxidation of DNA, protein, and lipid peroxidation. Upon viral infection, ROS triggers a different pathway to kill or spread viral infections. increased levels of NO in chicken embryo fibroblasts are associated with tissue damage in the brain and intestine of chickens. studies are needed to determine the role of other viral proteins and patterns of the oxidative stress in different tissues. GPx, GR, GST, and levels of GSH in the brain and liver vitamin E lessens these effects NDV induces histological changes in the brain, liver, and heart. vitamin E mitigates NDV-induced oxidative damage NDV increases the apoptosis in the brain. hepatitis and protective role of icariin or p-icariin Duck hepatitis virus 1 Ducklings DHV-1 induced significant oxidative damage in ducklings Icariin or p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury. oxidative stress BLIN showed a significant curative effect on DVH [123] to validate the antiviral effect of Taraxacum mongolicum extract (TME) apocynin on host cytokine homeostasis H1N1, H5N3, H5N1, and H7N9 A549 inhibited the ROS production from infected cells Apocynin increased the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and inhibited the influenza-induced cytokines. apocynin has also increased the virus-induced mRNA and protein expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. NS1 protein of the H9N2 AIV is responsible for ROS production and oxidative stress in primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells (COECs) gene DDIT-3 and H2AX phosphorylation also induce DNA damage. overexpression of DDIT-3 may be the reason for ARV-induced apoptosis. DHAV leads to persistent infection and causes oxidative stress in ducks. study confirms that DHAV causes damage to hepatocytes by oxidative stress. prevention of oxidative stress lessens tissue damage, necrosis, and mortality of duckling. but hijack the production of ROS/RNS by disturbing different cellular pathways. -transferase 2, a protein of the sulfotransferase family, and -lactate dehydrogenase. in intensive poultry production, IBD causes heavy economic loses. in intensive poultry production, IBD causes heavy economic loses by causing 80\u2013100% mortality. hao et al. have found that MDV infection of chickens leads to increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activity of Se-GSH-PX in the spleen, thymus, bursa, heart, liver, kidneys, and gonads. Keles et al. have demonstrated that MD induces DNA damage and increases concentration of MDA and PCO and plasma concentration of NO. birds infected with avian erythroblastosis virus show suppressed spleen-derived macrophages at 12, 24, and 36 hours postinfection. the results of landman et al. [151] demonstrate the nonsignificant effect of ALV-J on NO of spleen-derived macrophages. studies are needed to determine the role of other viral proteins and patterns of the oxidative stress in different tissues, which are mainly affected in Newcastle disease. saponins have shown the immune stimulatory for NDV [102, 103] and antioxidant properties for cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative stress in chickens. protective effects of vitamin E mitigates NDV-induced oxidative damage NDV increases the apoptosis in the brain [94] effects of NDV-induced pathological changes in the brain and protective effects of vitamin E ZJ1 (velogenic NDV) chicken Virulent NDV infection leads to increased concentrations of MDA and NO and decreased level of TAOC and GSH. baicalin-linarin-icariin-notoginsenoside R1 protective effects in DHV-induced injury Duck hepatitis A virus 1 Ducklings BLIN alleviates the oxidative stress BLIN showed a significant curative effect on DVH [123] To validate the antiviral effect of Taraxacum mongolicum extract (TME) TME may contribute to blocking protein synthesis steps and DNA replication. apocynin increased the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and inhibited the influenza-induced cytokines. apocynin has also increased the virus-induced mRNA and protein expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. NS1 protein of the H9N2 AIV is responsible for ROS production and oxidative stress in primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells (COECs) this disturbance of cellular redox homeostatic causes the apoptosis of COECs via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. duck hepatitis Virus (DHAV) is an acute, contagious, and lethal disease of young ducklings. there are three different serotypes (1, 2, and 3) of DHAV. DHAV leads to persistent infection and causes oxidative stress in ducks. DHAV causes damage to hepatocytes by oxidative stress. prevention of oxidative stress lessens tissue damage, necrosis, and mortality of duckling. scheme summarizes the effect of common avian viruses on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species. in intensive poultry production, IBD causes heavy economic loses by causing 80\u2013100% mortality and prolonged immunosuppression. the primary replication site of IBDV is the bursa of Fabricius, where sever destruction of the B lymphocytes causes significant impairment of the antibody response. the decreased activity of SOD, CAT, GST, and GPX in the liver of MDV-infected chickens. the chicken shows a significant positive correlation between DNA damage, MDA, PCO, and NOx. this DNA damage may be the result of ROS and RNS and induces DNA damage. many antioxidants have been proven to prevent the oxidative stresses, enhance the immune responses, and inhibit the virus replication. many antioxidants have been proven to prevent the oxidative stresses, enhance the immune responses, and inhibit the virus replication. no competing interests."}
