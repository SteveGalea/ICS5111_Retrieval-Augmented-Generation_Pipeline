{"summary": "SARS-PLpro lead inhibitors (I-1\u2013I-4) were tested against MERS-PLpro to determine whether these two enzymes behave similarly or not. amide group of inhibitor I-3 forms two hydrogen bonds with D165 and Q270 in the BL2 loop. amide group of inhibitor I-3 forms a hydrogen bond with Q270 in the BL2 loop. two corresponding loops of human ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) have been proven to be crucial in blocking accessibility to the active site. the amide group of inhibitor I-2 forms two hydrogen bonds with D165 and Q270 in the BL2 loop. MERS-PLpro exists in place of Q270 of SARS-PLpro, eliminating potential hydrogen bonding with inhibitors. the second key interaction is also impossible because T274 of the MERS-PLpro does not have the aromatic ring of Y269. the flexible BL2 loop blocks the entrance of the tunnel to the active site when it is unbound. the BL2 loop blocks the entrance of the tunnel to the active site when it is unbound. both BL1 and BL2 loops of USP14 appear to play a regulatory role in its deubiquitinating activity. SARS-CoV-PLpro (PDB: 2FE8), SARS-CoV-PLpro inhibitor complex with inhibitor I-2 (PDB: 3E9S), SARS-CoV-PLpro complex with inhibitor 3k (PDB: 4OVZ), and SARS-CoV-PLpro complex with ubiquitin aldehyde substrate (PDB: 4MM3) KM was determined with the ubiquitin-derived peptide substrate, RLRGG-AMC, for both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro enzymes side by side for comparison. a higher substrate concentration was used for MERS-PLpro than for the SARS-PLpro HTS screen. a 20-fold higher MERS-PLpro enzyme concentration was necessary to yield an enzyme activity signal similar to that of SARS-PLpro. the enzyme omission assay was performed to remove fluorescence signal interfering compounds. confirmed hits were repurchased, and their inhibitory activities were determined from full inhibition curves. bar graphs of IC50 values and the dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) of six hit compounds. the IC50 and KD values of 3 are 31.4 M and 39.9 M. of the three MERS-PLpro hits, only 4 showed specific binding to the enzyme, with 18.4 M binding affinity. compound 4 showed similar strength of inhibitory activities against both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro enzymes. the best fit equation was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion-corrected (AICc) values. a minimum of a two AICc unit difference from the next lowest is required to be considered statistically significant. compound 4 exhibited mixed-type inhibition for SARS-PLpro but competitive inhibition for MERS-PLpro. determined Ki values of compound 4 were 11.5 M and 7.5 M for SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro respectively. compound 4 appears to interact with MERS-PLpro by binding to the catalytic site since it is a competitive inhibitor. however, we were uncertain where 4 might bind to SARS-PLpro since it is an allosteric inhibitor. compound 4 binds to the dimer interface of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. compound 4 acts as an allosteric inhibitor against both SARS-CoV proteases. compound 4 acts as a competitive inhibitor against MERS-PLpro. hUCH-L1 is one of the human homologues most closely related to PLpro. hUCH-L1 is one of the human homologues most closely related to PLpro. the catalytic triads of two human ubiquitinating enzymes are similar. lytic cysteine plays this vital role in forming a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with an intermediate as an H-bond donor in the active site. lei et al. recently demonstrated that the L106W mutation resulted in catalytic activity enhancement of MERS-PLpro. however, the equivalent position is occupied by L106, which is not capable of being an H-bond donor. the positions of N109 in these two scenarios could differ. we generated two MERS-PLpro mutants, N109A and N109D. the mutant showed only 13.8% of the wild-type MERS-PLpro activity. active site and substrate residues are shown in green and pink respectively. the small loop (residues 101\u2013108) next to the active site in SARS-PLpro is important for its catalytic activity. the hydrogen bond between D109 from this loop and W94 restrains the loop conformation, preventing it from moving to block active site access. amide group of inhibitor I-3 forms a hydrogen bond with Q270 in the BL2 loop. the aromatic ring of Y269 forms a hydrophobic interaction with the naphthyl rings of both I-2 and I-3. the amide group of inhibitor I-2 forms two hydrogen bonds with D165 and Q270 in the BL2 loop. residues Q270 and Y269 form common key interactions in both scaffold 1 and 2 lead inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. however, neither Q270 nor Y269 residues exist in MERS-PLpro. onaviruses BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 align well with each other. residues compared include the active site, catalytic triad, and BL2 loop residues. the equivalent zinc atom in MERS-PLpro was located in a different position and was shifted in a different direction. BL2 loop of MERS-PLpro plays a regulatory role in its deubiquitinating activity. apo SARS-PLpro, apo MERS-PLpro, and MERS-CoV-PLpro complexes with ubiquitin. the active site, catalytic triad (CT) and two blocking loop residues of MERS-PLpro and their aligned residues in the active sites of SARS-PLpro and three bat coronaviral PLpro enzymes. a 20-fold higher MERS-PLpro enzyme concentration was necessary to yield an enzyme activity signal similar to that of SARS-PLpro. HTS was performed with a 25 000-compound Life Chemicals antimicrobial/antiviral focused library against both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro. the primary screen against SARS-PLpro was performed in duplicate, generating average Z\u2032-factors of 0.64 0.08. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used as a secondary orthogonal binding assay to eliminate false positives from the primary hits. the binding affinities of these validated hits varied from 26.3 M to 39.9 M. the remaining three were confirmed to be binders with KD values below 50 M. compound 4 inhibits both SARS-PLpro and MERS-PLpro. compound 4 exhibited mixed-type inhibition for SARS-PLpro. compound 4 exhibited competitive inhibition for the same substrate. IC50 values of 10.9 M (SARS-PLpro) and 6.2 M (MERS-PLpro) were determined to be a mixed inhibition for SARS-PLpro and a competitive inhibition for MERS-PLpro. compound 4 appears to interact with MERS-PLpro by binding to the catalytic site since it is a competitive inhibitor. compound 4 binds to the same location as I-2 and I-3. inhibitory activities of the four lead inhibitors alone varied from 0.23 M to 2.26 M. their IC50 values were enhanced up to almost 7-fold (0.034\u20130.67 M) in the presence of 4 at a concentration of 10 M, slightly lower than its IC50 value. compound 4 acts as an allosteric inhibitor against both SARS-CoV proteases (3CLpro and PLpro), whereas it acts as a competitive inhibitor against MERS-PLpro. hUCH-L1 is one of the human homologues most closely related to PLpro. two unrelated enzymes, NS3 serine protease (NS3) and Bacillus anthracis dihydroorotase (PyrC), were also tested along with both PLpro enzymes. oxyanion close to the catalytic site interacts with a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate to stabilize it. asparagine (N110) in SARS-PLpro is highly conserved among various coronavirus PLpro enzymes. Ratia et al. suggested that this residue could be another residue contributing to the oxyanion hole stabilization in addition to W107.21. active site analysis of the MERS-PLpro suggests that N109 is a critical residue for intermediate stabilization. the three catalytic triad residues (C111, H278, and D293) of MERS-PLpro are aligned with the SARS-PLpro catalytic triad (c112, H273 and D287). MERS-CoV has spread into 12 different countries so far. there is currently no specific treatment or vaccine available. we performed HTS of 25 000 compounds against both PLpro enzymes. this inhibitor was determined to be a competitive inhibitor against MERS-PLpro, whereas it was an allosteric inhibitor against SARS-PLpro. the most probable contributing factor for inhibitor selectivity could be attributed to the structural differences of the BL2 loop. enzyme reactions were initiated with 10 L of substrate Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (Bachem Bioscience; 50 M and 75 M for SARS- and MERS-PLpro, respectively) dissolved in the assay buffer and incubated for 6 min, followed by adding 10 L of 10% SDS (w/v) as a stop solution. the concentration of compounds was varied from 0 to at least 10 the IC50 value of each compound. the data were fit to four equations using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.3. the data were fit to four equations using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.3. the enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 8 L of the substrate (50 M final concentration) and fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 350 nm/460 nm for 10 min. the crystal space group belonged to C2, containing one monomer in the asymmetric unit. the MERS-PLpro enzyme (400 nM final concentration) was prepared in the same assay buffer with 5 mM DTT in place of 2 mM GSH. a total of 30 L of enzyme solution was dispensed into wells and then 200 nL of 10 mM compounds (50 M final concentrations) was added and incubated for 5 min. pro was immobilized to flow channel 4 at the immobilization level of 14 600 RU to be compared with MERS-PLpro. the data were referenced with blank (enthanolamine) RU values. the hyperbolic, y = ymaxx/(KD + x), was used to plot response units and corresponding concentration, where y is the response, ymax is the maximum response, and x is the compound concentration. a series of compound concentrations (0 to 200 M final concentration at 2-fold serial dilution) in 100% DMSO was prepared in a 384-well plate. a total of 8 L of each enzyme solution was distributed into wells. 8 L of varying concentrations of compounds was incubated for 10 min.
