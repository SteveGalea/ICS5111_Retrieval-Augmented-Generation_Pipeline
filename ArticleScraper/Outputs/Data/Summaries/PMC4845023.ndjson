{"summary": "genomes have sizes between 18\u201319 kb with 40\u201342% GC content. seven genes present in EBOV with two variants of glycoproteins (GP) gene in RESTV and SUDV. three splice variants have been annotated in other species. human thousand proteomes were created by using 1000 Genomes data and translating it to proteins sequences25,26. this led us to the 9mer peptide/pattern that is found in this virus but absent in human proteomes. this led us to the 9mer peptide/pattern that is found in this virus but absent in human proteomes. CBTOPE is a unique method that predicts conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen from its amino acid sequence as opposed to previous methods, which required the structure of the antigen to predict the same. the results were obtained on the default threshold of 0.3 cut-off and implemented on our website. CTLPred is a direct method that predicts T-cell epitopes (CTL) from a primary sequence of the antigen instead of using the intermediate step where MHC class I binders are predicted. in the past, numerous methods have been developed for predicting MHC class II binders but none of them has been able to predict the type of interleukins released by these binders. most of the prediction methods are developed based on 19mer length of siRNA sequence34,35,36. first, we generated 19mer overlapping oligonucleotides in each gene of the above-mentioned five ebolaviruses. third, we identified oligonucleotides conserved in different species of the virus. the templates for structure prediction were derived using Hhbuilt suite with default parameters. all the predicted protein structures for 38 proteins (except for L protein) are available from our web resource. of 9 amino acids (9mer) were generated from proteins of five ebolaviruses. all the possible 9mer peptides from each protein were predicted for their immunological potential. one of the challenges in vaccine development is to avoid self-tolerance as the body\u2019s immune system rarely acts against self-antigens. LBtope27 is a highly accurate method trained on a large dataset. we applied the LBtope model with default threshold of 60% probability cut-off. conformational B-cell epitopes have been predicted in the above conserved peptides. prediction of MHC Class II binders was performed using ProPred30. it is a quantitative/virtual matrix-based method that allows the users to predict promiscuous MHC Class II binders for 51 alleles. we also predicted CTL epitopes using a direct method, CTLPred31. LBtope is a highly accurate method trained on a large dataset. we applied the LBtope model with default threshold of 60% probability cut-off. conformational B-cell epitopes have been predicted in the above conserved peptides using CBTOPE28. the prediction was performed using ProPred30 with top 3% threshold. it is a quantitative/virtual matrix-based method that allows users to predict promiscuous MHC Class II binders for 51 alleles. we also predicted CTL epitopes using a direct method, CTLPred31. RNA therapeutics In order to design siRNA-based therapeutics against the Ebola virus, we generated 19mer oligonucleotide from the corresponding mRNA sequences. this length is sufficient to silence a target transcript. most of the prediction methods are developed based on 19mer length of siRNA sequence34,35,36. phylogenetic trees MEGA software version 5.037 has been used for creating the phylogenetic tree from protein sequences of Ebola virus. to generate multiple sequence alignment of proteins we used the software ClustalW24. these alignments were used to construct the tree using Maximum-Likelihood algorithm where branch lengths were visualized from the given options. results Subunit vaccine against ebolavirus 9mer peptides In our study, we have generated all the possible overlapping 9mer peptides for each of the ebolavirus. peptides present in 1000 Genomes-based human proteome were also filtered to avoid cross presentation with any individual. s were conserved among four human pathogenic ebolaviruses (excluding RESTV) 21 peptides were common among all the four human pathogenic ebolaviruses (excluding RESTV, not pathogenic to human) these peptides are highly promiscuous vaccine candidates. both immunity 0 2 3 14 9 IFN-gamma 233 511 986 4744 10 = (5 + 9) Th1 immunity 42 98 168 805 11 Interleukin-4 599 1141 2137 10553 12 = (5 + 11) Th2 immunity 103 207 378 1762 Table 3.
