{"summary": "the term \u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d has been introduced to denote this mild form of pneumonia. it was in a patient with \u201catypical\u201d pneumonia in 1944. it was believed to be a virus because it was resistant to penicillin and sulfonamides. M. pneumoniae infections were first reported in 1960 when 16% of 110 children with lower respiratory tract disease were tested positive by a fourfold rise in antibody titers against the Eaton agent. to date, the incidence of M. pneumoniae infections is generally higher in children than in adults. the most recent epidemic in Europe occurred in 2010\u20132012 with a peak incidence in Finland of 145/100,000 cases in 2011. differences between these subtypes in the amino acid sequence of the major adhesion protein P1 are believed to play a role in the epidemiology of infections with M. pneumoniae. milder clinical presentations of M. pneumoniae respiratory infections may be much more common than CAP. these include acute bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections. it is estimated that 3\u201310% of children with CAP develop CAP. recent observations have indicated that M. pneumoniae CAP has also a relatively high prevalence in the respiratory tract of children 5 years. CAP was reported to be most frequent among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age. a potential candidate protein of M. pneumoniae that may be involved in causing direct damage to the respiratory tract is a pertussis toxin-like protein called Community-Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) toxin. the immunological response following infection generates inflammatory reactions that may cause pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. more severe symptoms of CAP have been observed in older children and adolescents. this study described 20 patients with CAP, of which 19 were children 4\u201315 years old, diagnosed by a significant rise in antibody titers against M. pneumoniae with CFT. the strongest skin reactions were seen in patients with severe CAP. patients with M. pneumoniae infection were at higher risk of having early-onset asthma (age at asthma diagnosis 12 years) and late-onset asthma (age at asthma diagnosis 12 years) exposure to recombinant CARDS toxin resulted in allergic-type inflammatory response and airway hyperreactivity in mice and baboons. all patients presented with prodromal respiratory symptoms with a median duration of 7 days. pneumonia was found in chest radiography in 79%. ocular lesions in 97%, and urogenital lesions in 78%. a recent study presented 365 children with M. pneumoniae detected in the respiratory tract or CSF by PCR. patients in which M. pneumoniae was detected in the respiratory tract but not in CSF showed pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph more frequently than patients with positive PCR in CSF. this suggests that pneumonia may be an indicator for a remote inflammatory process in M. pneumoniae encephalitis patients. intrathecal antibodies against galactocerebroside (GalC) were found in children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis. all these patients had a negative PCR in CSF. anti-GalC antibodies caused demyelinating neuropathy in rabbits. between 1963 and 1975, M. pneumoniae was detected by culture of respiratory specimens and/or a fourfold titer rise in complement fixation test (CFT) in 15\u201320% of radiologically confirmed CAP cases in Seattle, U.S. infection was diagnosed by culture of respiratory specimens and/or a fourfold titer rise in complement fixation test (CFT) children with CAP due to M. pneumoniae have been found to present with a significantly longer duration of fever compared with other children with CAP. a recombinant version of the CARDS toxin has been shown to bind with high affinity to surfactant protein A. it exhibits mono-ADP ribosyltransferase and vacuolating activities. more severe symptoms of CAP have been observed in older children and adolescents. the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection in this study was performed by PCR and/or serology. another recent study diagnosed M. pneumoniae in children with acute asthma (64%, 34/53) and refractory asthma. the most frequent manifestations are diseases of the dermatologic and nervous system. skin manifestations occur in up to 25% of all M. pneumoniae infections, including mostly non-specific exanthems. erosive oral lesions limited to the mucosa in this form of MPAM in a 24-year-old woman. a study presented 365 children with M. pneumoniae detected in the respiratory tract or CSF. patients in which M. pneumoniae was detectable in the respiratory tract but not in CSF showed pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph more frequently than patients with positive PCR in CSF (77% vs. 33%) this suggests that pneumonia may be an indicator for a remote inflammatory process in M. pneumoniae encephalitis patients. anti-GalC antibodies caused demyelinating neuropathy in rabbits. the detection of intrathecal antibodies against M. pneumoniae and GalC may also be regarded as a promising new diagnostic tool. asymptomatic carriage rates of 3% and 58% were reported in the spring of 2009 and the summer of 2010 respectively. children were found to simultaneously carry many pathogens in their nose and throat. the simultaneous presence of two or more of these pathogens was detected in 56% of asymptomatic children. Method Test Target/antigen Antibodies Specimen(s) Performance Value Comments Direct identification of M. pneumoniae Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Different target genes (e.g., P1 gene, 16S rDNA, 16S rRNA, RepMP elements etc.) Respiratory specimen Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Other bodily fluids or tissues High sensitivity, high specificity RD.

Cross-reactivity with other pathogens and non-infectious diseases. specific serum IgM emerges within 1 week after initial infection and about 2 weeks before IgG. cross-reactions with other pathogens and non-infectious disease has been described for CFT and particle agglutination assay. positive serological results in asymptomatic M. pneumoniae PCR-positive children may simply reflect one or more previous encounters with M. pneumoniae. it is questionable whether or not a positive result in these tests actually indicates the etiological role of M. pneumoniae in all cases. CAP was diagnosed in 13% of children (1 months\u201316 years; 1997\u20131999, Zurich, Switzerland) compared with other children with CAP, patients with M. pneumoniae were older and had a longer duration of fever. the score model placed 75% of all patients with M. pneumoniae infection into the high-risk group. tetracyclines may cause teeth discoloration and fluoroquinolones may affect the developing cartilage in young children. age limit for tetracyclines is 8 years, while fluoroquinolones is adolescence with skeletal maturity. arthropathy due to fluoroquinolones, however, is uncertain. antibiotic resistance since 2000 led to an alarming worldwide increase in prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains. resistance is based on specific point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA (at positions 2063, 2064, and 2617), which reduce the affinity of macrolides to the large subunit (50S) of the bacterial ribosome. the clinical relevance of macrolide resistance in hospitalized children with CAP may lie in prolonging the symptoms of the disease. an increase in MRMP may also have serious clinical consequences in children, leading to more severe radiological findings of CAP. IP-10) were higher in patients infected with MRMP than in patients infected with macrolide-sensitive strains. this suggests that the higher and more persistent inflammatory stimulation by MRMP may increase the possibility of severe lung lesions and extrapulmonary complications. tetracyclines may cause teeth discoloration and fluoroquinolones may affect the developing cartilage in young children. the age limit for tetracyclines is 8 years, while fluoroquinolones is adolescence with skeletal maturity. the occurrence of arthropathy due to fluoroquinolones is uncertain. antibiotic resistance Since 2000, the extensive macrolide use led to an alarming worldwide increase in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) strains. resistance is based on specific point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA (at positions 2063, 2064, and 2617) resistance is based on specific point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA (at positions 2063, 2064, and 2617) the clinical relevance of macrolide resistance in hospitalized children with CAP may lie in prolonging the symptoms of the disease. the clinical relevance of macrolide resistance in hospitalized children with CAP may lie in prolonging the symptoms of the disease. matsuda et al., 2013. this suggests that the higher and more persistent inflammatory stimulation by MRMP may increase the possibility of severe lung lesions and extrapulmonary complications. recombinant proteins as potential vaccines were found to be promising. author contributions All authors listed, have made substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
