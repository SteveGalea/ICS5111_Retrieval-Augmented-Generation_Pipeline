{"summary": "in the first year of PEDV outbreaks in the united states, about 7 million piglets died, resulting in a $9 million to $1.8 billion annual loss for the U.S. economy (4, 5). the emerging, highly virulent PEDV strains have decimated swine farms in china and spread to other Asian countries. aminopeptidase N (APN) and sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid [Neu5Ac] mediates virus-cell membrane fusion during virus entry (8). a known neutralizing epitope, the CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE; residues 499 to 638) of S1 contains the APN-binding domain (12) experimental infection of 6-day-old colostrum-deprived piglets infected with the TTR-2 strain revealed that the virulence of this mutant was reduced compared with that of the highly virulent strain OKN-1 (22). however, in addition to the 194-aa deletion in the S1 NTD, TTR-2 also contains an additional 28-amino-acid substitution compared with the sequence of the virulent control OKN-1 strain. suckling piglets challenged the surviving pigs at 3 weeks of age with the highly virulent PEDV PC177 (TC-PC177) strain. we introduced the same 197-aa deletion into the S1 subunit of icPC22A (icPC22A-S1197). virulence of TC-PC177 was reduced in conventional suckling piglets. the duration of diarrhea in the TC-PC177-inoculated group was 2.22 2.17 days. the titer was significantly shorter than that (7.33 1.18 days) of the PC21A-inoculated group. piglets in the mock group were inoculated with 10 log10 genome equivalents (GE)/pig of wild-type PC21A. values in parentheses are the number of positive animals/number of animals tested. data were determined at 1 to 11 dpi. ND, not detected. the villous height-to-crypt depth (VH/CD) ratios of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum differed significantly among groups. the highest ratio was in the mock infection group, midrange ratios were in the TC-PC177 infection group. in, stained with 1% alcian blue and appear as cyan signals. the two sows were exposed to their virus-shedding piglets. the overall fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers of the TC-PC177-infected sow were lower than those of the PC21A-infected sow. two PC177-infected piglets, two mock-infected piglets and one surviving PC21A-infected piglet were euthanized at the acute phase for histopathological examination. an FC score of 2 was considered diarrhea. the detection limit of PEDV real-time RT-PCR corresponds to 4.8 log10 GE/ml. culated group exhibited a significantly longer duration of diarrhea (3.80 0.84 days) than the TC-PC177-inoculated group (1.88 1.13 days) no mortality was observed in the three litters. pigs in both the TC-PC177- and PC21A-inoculated groups shed PEDV RNA. we amplified PC21A but not PC177 PEDV from the fecal samples of pigs in the TC-PC177 group after challenge with the highly virulent PEDV PC21A strain. the titers rose significantly (P 0.05) by 7 dpc in the TC-PC177 and mock inoculation groups but not in the PC21A group. TC-PC177 P10C8 revealed additional mutations compared with TC-PC177. this deletion resulted in an 85-aa C-terminal truncation in the ORF3 protein. we also found that this clone has 9 amino acids different from the genome of PC21A. the second-generation infectious clone, designated icPC22A, was now captured within five plasmids that replicated more stably in E. coli. icPC22A contains a GGC insertion (nucleotide positions 22029 to 22031) in the S1 C-terminal domain. this insertion was genetically stable through the 160th passage (27) icPC22A-S1197 and the virulent control icPC22A developed more slowly with icPC22A-S1197 virus than with the icPC22A virus. we harvested both supernatants at 4 to 5 days posttransfection and passaged them in vero cells one more time to generate the P1 virus. 96-well plates, and virus titers were calculated using the Reed-Muench method. the replication of recombinant viruses in vero cells was assessed by multistep growth kinetics at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. icPC22A-S1197 was inoculated with recombinant virus icPC22A or icPC22A-S1197. after inoculation, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2.5% FBS. at 16 h postinoculation, cells were fixed and the PEDV antigens were stained using mouse anti-PEDV N antibody. icPC22A-S1197 (n = 4; 100 PFU/pig) virus or mock inoculated (n = 2; PBS) all icPC22A-infected piglets developed diarrhea within 1 dpi. piglets developed severe clinical signs, became moribund, and were euthanized at 2 dpi. icPC22A-S1197 4 100 (4/4) A 0 (0/4) B 3.25 0.50 A 2.50 0.58 7.67 0.58 3.25 0.50 icPC22A 3 100 (3/3) A 1.00 0.00 B 3.00 0.00 NA (>3)e 1 Mock 2 0 (0/2) B 0 (0/2) B ND 1.00 ND ND. three icPC22A piglets became moribund and were euthanized at 2 dpi. one icPC22A-S1197-infected diarrheic piglet and one mock-inoculated piglet were euthanized at 3 dpi for histopathological examination. the intestinal VH/CD ratio of the icPC22A-S1197 group was significantly higher than that of icPC22A-S1197-infected piglets. icPC22A-S1197 was less virulent than icPC22A-S1197. icPC22A-S1197 was less virulent than icPC22A. 0 is located at the greatest distance from the trimeric axis that does not contribute to the trimer formation. deletion of domain 0 in the S protein trimer of icPC22A-S1197 would not interfere with the neutralizing epitope COE. piglets were orally inoculated with TC-PC177 P10C8, highly virulent PC21A, or phosphate-buffered saline ([PBS] mock) no pigs had diarrhea, and no virus shedding was detected in the mock inoculation group. pigs Diarrhea rate (%)c Mortality rate (%) Onset of diarrhea (dpi) Mean cumulative FC score of each pigd Duration of diarrhea (days) Onset of fecal RNA shedding (dpi) Mean cumulative FC score of each pigd d Mean value = (sum of FC scores for each piglet)/N, where N is the number of surviving piglets. the detection limit of PEDV real-time RT-PCR corresponds to 4.8 log10 GE/ml. highest ratio was in the mock infection group, midrange ratios were in the TC-PC177 infection group, and the lowest ratio was in the PC21A infection group. no PEDV antigen-positive cells were detected in any other organs other than the intestines and lymphocytes. the overall fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers of the TC-PC177-infected sow were lower than those of the PC21A-infected sow. however, after the PC21A challenge, the sow did not develop diarrhea. sows in both the TC-PC177 and mock infection groups had diarrhea. two mock-infected piglets and one surviving PC21A-infected piglet were euthanized at the acute phase for histopathological examination. an FC score of 2 was considered diarrhea. values in parentheses are the number of positive results/number of animals tested. the shedding titers in the TC-PC177 group increased from 7.36 1.41 to 8.81 1.64 log10 GE/ml. the mock-inoculated piglets had increased shedding titers from no shedding at 0 dpc to the peak titer of 10.23 0.66 log10 GE/ml within 2 dpc. however, the PEDV RNA shedding titers were undetectable in the TC- titers expressed as reciprocal of highest dilution at which number of PEDV FFU is blocked 80%. the mean PEDV VN antibody titers in TC-PC177- and PC21A-inoculated groups were similar at 1 dpc. icPC22A-S1197 was deleted from the 197-aa region from the S gene of the highly virulent icPC22A virus. the cDNA clone of PC22A was more stable and more efficient in rescue of recombinant viruses. the original six-fragment infectious clone described by Beall et al. (23) was compromised by the low stability of subclones B and E and low virus yields. icPC22A contains a GGC insertion (nucleotide positions 22029 to 22031) in the S1 C-terminal domain, resulting in the replacement of an aspartic acid by a glycine and a histidine. this insertion was genetically stable through the 160th passage (27) the appropriate genetic marker, the C-to-G substitution at nucleotide site 16507, existed in the genomes of both icPC22A and icPC22A-S1197. the deletion was confirmed for icPC22A-S1197 virus by RT-PCR, followed by sequence analysis. recombinant viruses occurred at 2 days posttransfection of the mixture of full-length genomic RNA and N gene transcripts into vero cells. titers of icPC22A-S1197 virus were about 3 to 4 log10 lower than those of the other two viruses at 36 h postinoculation. to confirm the loss of the sialic acid binding domain in icPC22A-S1197 virus, we performed neuraminidase (NA) treatment of Vero cells, followed by virus inoculation. the recombinant viruses from our optimized infectious clones were effectively rescued in vero cell cultures. the icPC22A virus propagated similarly to its parental virus, PC22A P4, yet the icPC22A-S1197 virus replicated less efficiently than the other two. icPC22A-inoculated piglets were euthanized at 2 dpi. icPC22A virus is highly pathogenic in newborn piglets. piglets were euthanized at the acute phase. a Different uppercase letters indicate a mean significant difference between groups (P 0.05). ND, not detected. b Piglets in the icPC22A-S1197 group were inoculated with 100 PFU/pig of virus. piglets in the mock inoculation group were inoculated with 100 PFU/pig of virus. icPC22A-S1197-infected piglets showed less severe diarrhea than icPC22A-S1197-infected piglets. the highest viral RNA shedding titer within 10 dpi was 8.88 0.17 log10 GE/ml in the icPC22A group. no alteration of tissue tropism was observed in the icPC22A-S1197-infected piglets. these findings suggest that icPC22A-S1197 was less virulent than icPC22A. icPC22A-S1197 (D) were modeled based on the cryo-EM structure of human coronavirus NL63 S protein from the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession number 5SZS) the 197-amino-acid region, designated domain 0, is highlighted in orange, whereas other domains in the S1 subunit are highlighted in blue; the S2 subunit is in gray. a and S may also contribute to the attenuated phenotype. the application of reverse genetics was essential for the final confirmation of the role of the 197-aa deletion in PEDV attenuation. the milder clinical signs, virus shedding profiles, and histopathological lesions of TC-PC177-inoculated piglets were similar to those of colostrum-deprived piglets. the S1 NTD correlated with different sialic acid binding activities and pathogenicities of PEDV strains in pigs. the virulence of S indel strains is reduced compared with that of the highly virulent strains. onaviruses, including the highly virulent PEDV strain, may facilitate initial virus attachment to cellular receptors in vivo. however, it is difficult to monitor and quantify the initial infection step between the highly virulent and S1 NTD-del strain in vivo. enteric tropism of TC-PC177 and icPC22A-S1197 in piglets differs from what occurred with another porcine enteric alphacoronavirus, TGEV. TGEV replicates exclusively in the intestine while TGEV replicates in both the intestine and respiratory tract. icPC22A-S1197 piglets replicate less effectively than highly virulent strains. such defective replication of TC-PC177 might induce less robust immune responses than PC21A in conventional piglets. domain 0, containing deleted 197-aa region, potentially does not interfere with trimer formation and the neutralizing epitopes COE (residue 499 to 638) and 2C10 (residues 1368 to 1374) (29). deletion of domain 0 may influence two nonneutralizing B cell epitopes, SS2 and SS6 (48), which may contribute to the conformational change of the S2 subunit. ne contained a 52-nt deletion at the 3\u2032 end of the S gene. this resulted in a 7-aa early termination of the S protein and the loss of the start codon of the ORF3 gene. mutations may impair the pathogenicity of recombinant AVCT12 (rAVCT12) in vivo. an infectious cDNA clone of the highly virulent Chinese strain AH2012/12 was reported (53) using a similar strategy as that used with icPC22A. however, the CPE of rAH2012/12 occurred only after the supernatants of transfected Vero cells were passaged three times, implying less efficiency in rescuing recombinant viruses. two highly virulent PEDV strains of U.S. origin, PC21A and PC22A, were detected and isolated from the same PED outbreak. two highly virulent PEDV strains of U.S. origin, PC21A and PC22A, were detected and isolated from the same PED outbreak. two naturally occurring BsaI sites were removed by introducing synonymous mutations. fragment D contained a T7 promoter located upstream of the first nucleotide. fragment E harbored a 23-nt poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end. the full-length cDNA was assembled as previously described (56, 57) cDNA fragments were digested individually with respective restriction enzymes and gel purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit. the ligated cDNA was used as the template for in vitro transcription. the supernatant of electroporated Vero cells was harvested at 4 to 6 days postinoculation (dpi) and passed one more time in vero cells to generate the first-passage (P1) virus stock. a fragment was amplified by PCR using primers PEDV-15792-F (5\u2032-CAAGGAGGAGAGCGTTAAGTCATCCTATG-3\u2032) piglets were inoculated orally with TC-PC177 P10C8 (n = 10) at a dose of 5 log10 PFU/piglet. wild-type PC21A infection (n = 11; 10 log10 GE/piglet) and mock infection (n = 9, PBS) were used as the positive and negative controls. piglets were orally inoculated with plaque-purified passage of icPC22A or icPC22A-S1197 or mock inoculated. at 5 days of age, piglets were orally inoculated with plaque-purified, first passage of icPC22A or icPC22A-S1197 or icPC22A-S1197. at the acute phase of infection, one diarrheic piglet of each PEDV- the genome sequence of PC22A P4 was determined by Sanger sequencing (OSU) at necropsy, duodenum, three sections of the jejunum (proximal, middle, and distal), ileum, colon, and other major organs were collected and fixed in 10% formalin. the immunohistochemical staining procedure was performed as described previously. monolayers of vero cells in six-well plates were pretreated with 200 mM neuraminidase (NA) or of PBS at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after a washing step, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% FBS to inhibit trypsin activity. sequence identities between the S proteins of the two recombinant PEDVs, icPC22A and icPC22A-S1197, and the human coronavirus NL63 S protein were 43.5% and 47.5%, respectively. new sequences were deposited in the GenBank under the following accession numbers: PC22A P4 for icPEDV (23), KX683006; TC-PC177 P10C8 KY499261; and PC22A P4 for icPC22A (this study), KY499262. the viral RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Germany) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using superScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the five truncated genomic cDNAs, fragments A to E, were amplified by PCR with PrimeSTAR GXL polymerase. the full-length cDNA was assembled as previously described (56, 57) cDNA was digested individually with restriction enzymes and gel purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit. the cDNA was used as the template for in vitro transcription using a mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit. cDNA was transcribed, followed by poly(A) tailing using a HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA kit. the mixture of N gene transcripts and the full-length genomic RNA was electroporated into 8 106 vero cells with four pulses at 450 V and 50 F. the supernatant of electroporated Vero cells was harvested at 4 to 6 days postinoculation (dpi) piglets were inoculated orally with TC-PC177 P10C8 (n = 10) at a dose of 5 log10 PFU/piglet. piglets were inoculated orally with TC-PC177 P10C8 (n = 10) at a dose of 5 log10 PFU/piglet. piglets were euthanized at 3 dpi for histopathological examinations. at 19 dpi (TC-PC177 group) and 20 dpi (mock and PC21A groups), the piglets were challenged orally with the PC21A strain with 12 log10 GE/pig. this challenge dose for 3-week-old PEDV-exposed pigs was optimized in our previously study (31) piglets were derived and raised as described previously (59) fecal consistency was examined by collection of rectal swabs. total fecal RNA was extracted using a MagMax RNA isolation kit. the PEDV N gene was detected by RT-qPCR as described previously. the intestine tissues were treated with 1% alcian blue at room temperature for 5 min. the tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin. the intestine tissues were treated with 1% alcian blue. pretreated cells were washed twice, followed by inoculation with 350 FFU of recombinant virus icPC22A or icPC22A-S1197 with trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. DMEM containing 2.5% FBS was added, and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. models and selected the intermediate 3-D models with the best scores according to the generalized Born/volume integral methodology. the 3-D structures were thermodynamically optimized by energy minimization using the MOE and an Amber 10:EHT force field (65, 66) combined with the generalized Born model of aqueous solvation implemented in MOE."}
