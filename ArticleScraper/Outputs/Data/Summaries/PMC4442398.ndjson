{"summary": "in the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in stress granules (SGs) and their interplay with the replication of a variety of viruses. in the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in stress granules (SGs) and their interplay with the replication of a variety of viruses. e (9), or heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) (10), leads to dephosphorylation of G3BP1 and enables G3BP1 multimerization and subsequent SG formation (5). RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR play a similar role in SG formation (11). several labs have demonstrated colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation of alphavirus nsP2, nsP3 or nsP4 with G3BPs. SFV induces SGs early in infection; these are disassembled around 8 h postinfection (p.i.) this suggests they are recruited to replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) we also analyzed the role of the often-overlooked G3BPs in the CHIKV replication cycle. the bulk of G3BP1 and G3BP2 is not associated with the viral RTCs but sequestered in nsP3-G3BP aggregates, likely to prevent the formation of bona fide SGs. CHIKV variants expressing Renilla luciferase either as an nsP3 fusion (ICRES1-P3Rluc) or from a duplicated subgenomic RNA promoter (ICRES1-2SG-Rluc) were generated by standard cloning techniques, based on previously described constructs. a replication-deficient variant (ICRES1-P3Rluc-nsP4-GAA) was created by mutating the GDD the ICRES1-P3Rluc and ICRES1-2SG-Rluc plasmids were linearized with NotI and transcribed using the mMessage mMachine SP6 kit (Ambion) for visualization of SGs, vero E6 cells were grown on coverslips and treated for 60 min with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite (Sigma) nsPs were visualized using mouse anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-o'nyong-nyong nsP1, anti-CHIKV helicase (nsP2) and anti-CHIKV nsP3 sera. the coverslips were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. unlysed cells, debris, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 g. the resulting postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was fractionated in a 15,000 g pellet (P15) and supernatant (S15) plasmid pCMV-FLAG-G3BP2 was created by cloning the G3BP2 expression plasmid into p3xFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma) these cells were infected with CHIKV at 24 h p.t. RNA isolation, gel electrophoresis, and detection by in-gel hybridization with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. in the nsP1-encoding region were used in combination with primers and a probe specific for the E1-coding region. samples were analyzed using the SensiFast Probe (Bioline) or TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step (ABI) qRT-PCR kit and a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) antibody binding was carried out overnight at 4\u00b0C in AVIP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholine) beads were washed three times in AVIP buffer before elution by boiling in a sample buffer for 5 min. CHIKV variants expressing Renilla luciferase either as an nsP3 fusion (ICRES1-P3Rluc) or from a duplicated subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) promoter (ICRES1-2SG-Rluc) were generated by standard cloning techniques, based on previously described constructs. the ICRES1-P3Rluc and ICRES1-2SG-Rluc plasmids were linearized with NotI and transcribed using the mMessage mMachine SP6 kit (Ambion) indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. double-stranded RNA was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody J2. nsPs were visualized using mouse anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-o'nyong-nyong nsP1, anti-CHIKV helicase (nsP2) and anti-CHIKV nsP3 sera. the coverslips were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. unlysed cells, debris, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 g. the resulting postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was fractionated in a 15,000 g pellet (P15) and supernatant (S15) cells were infected with CHIKV at 24 h p.t. RNA isolation, gel electrophoresis, and in-gel hybridization. qRT-PCR was used to determine copy number of CHIKV genomic RNA (probe in nsP1-coding region) and total RNA (probe in E1-coding region) nsP1-encoding region used in combination with primers and probe specific for nsP1-encoding region. samples were analyzed using a qRT-PCR kit and a CFX384 Touch real-time PCR detection system. serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA were used as standards for copy number determination. antibody binding was carried out overnight at 4\u00b0C in AVIP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholine) beads were washed three times in AVIP buffer before elution by boiling in a sample buffer for 5 min. in uninfected cells, G3BP2 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. in CHIKV-infected cells, G3BP2-containing foci appeared by 6 to 8 h p.i., continued to grow in size until 10 h p.i., and remained present thereafter. similar observations were made for G3BP1 (data not shown) and costaining for G3BP1 and G3BP2 revealed that the two proteins localize to the vero E6 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI, 5; analyzed at 8 h p.i.) CHIKV-induced granules (MOI, 5; 8 h p.i.) were costained for G3BP1 and CHIKV. a longer exposure of mock-infected cells is shown to visualize diffuse G3BP2 staining. vero E6 cells were treated with arsenite or infected with CHIKV-GFP. after fixation, the localization of the SG markers indicated to the left of each row was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. some viruses block SG formation by cleaving key SG components, like G3BP1. G3BPs colocalize with CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 but not with nsP1, nsP4 or dsRNA. vero cells were infected with CHIKV at an MOI of 5, fixed at 6 h p.i., and immunostained for G3BP2 and CHIKV nsPs. this staining confirmed the previously reported nsP3-G3BP2 colocal nsP4-FLAG (LR2006-OPY1- nsP4/FLAG) stained for G3BP2, nsP1, nsP2, and nsP4/FLAG. arrowheads indicate colocalization of dsRNA with G3BP2. closed arrowheads indicate some examples of nonoverlapping signals. a fraction of nsP1 and nsP4 is located within the CHIKV RTCs. nsP2 and nsP3 also have other functions and different intracellular localizations outside the membrane-associated RTC. this suggests that the previously reported nsP3-G3BP interaction occurs with the pool of nsP3 that is not associated with the RTC. BPs inhibit CHIKV replication. it was previously shown that G3BP expression is controlled by an apparent feedback mechanism that results in the upregulation of one G3BP when the expression of the other is reduced (35). these observations suggest that the proteins are functionally linked. the cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI, 5) 48 h after siRNA transfection. total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points. cells were transfected with control or G3BP-specific siRNAs. the siRNA-transfected cells were infected with a CHIK reporter virus at MOIs of 0.05, 1, and 5, and cells were fixed at 24, 20, and 16 h p.i. despite efficient knockdown, G3BP1 depletion had little effect on CHIKV replication. silencing of both G3BP1 and G3BP2 exerted a stronger effect on CHIKV replication than depletion of G3BP2 alone. all subsequent knockdown experiments were done with siRNA pools that targeted G3BP1 and G3BP2 simultaneously. the combined depletion of G3BP1 and G3BP2 resulted in severely reduced negative-strand RNA levels. we infected CHIKV-depleted cells with an unrelated reporter virus. depletion of G3BP1 alone barely affected SINV replication, whereas depletion of G3BP2 alone strongly affected SINV replication. this showed that CVB3 replication was not negatively affected by CVB3. transfection of 3 out of 4 individual G3BP2 siRNAs (2, 3 and 4) resulted in a strong reduction in G3BP2 expression. transfection of siRNA 1 was somewhat less effective in reducing GFP expression. depletion of G3BP2 alone with the SMARTpool resulted in a similar reduction in GFP expression. no reduction in CHIKV-driven eGFP expression was observed in cells transfected with the corresponding C911 mutant siRNAs. the inhibition of CHIKV replication was due to G3BP2 depletion rather than off-target effects of the siRNAs. in vitro-transcribed CHIKV genomic RNA was labeled at 5 h p.i. cells were chased for 0, 45, or 90 min before lysis and immunoprecipitation. CHIKV RNA was analyzed using in-gel hybridization using probes specific for negative- or positive-strand RNA. BP-depleted cells replication of transfected CHIKV RNA was detected. negative-strand RNA levels were much lower than in control cells. accumulation of positive-strand RNA was impaired. this may have been due to large amount of RNA transfected into cells. Western blot analysis revealed only minor differences in nsP levels between G3BP-depleted and control cells. only the nsP3 level was clearly lower in G3BP-depleted cells. the accumulation of CHIKV negative-strand RNA was strongly reduced in G3BP-depleted cells infected at an MOI of 50. the degradation signal present in nsP3 (38) was lost in the nsP3-Rluc fusion. a larger amount of nsP3-Rluc could have been solubilized from G3BP-depleted cells compared to control cells. these data suggest that G3BP depletion does not directly affect translation and might even slightly stimulate nonstructural polyprotein translation. replication-competent CHIKV-P3Rluc RNA was transfected into control cells. luciferase expression was quantified at various time points. luciferase signals in control and control cells were very similar. CHIKV replication induces G3BP-containing foci that resemble SGs. a variety of viruses induce the formation of SGs or SG-like cytoplasmic granules. similar observations were made for G3BP1 and G3BP2. natural isolate CHIKV ITA07-RA1 and CHIKV LR2006-OPY1-nsP4/FLAG induced similar G3BP2-containing granules. this suggests that this is a general CHIKV property. a longer exposure of mock-infected cells is shown to visualize diffuse G3BP2 staining. the composition of the CHIKV-induced granules was examined by immunostaining for several SG markers. in arsenite-induced SGs, G3BP1, G3BP2, TIA-1, TIAR, PABP, and eIF3 could readily be detected. however, the CHIKV-induced granules were labeled only for G3BP1 and G3BP2. eIF2 phosphorylation increased strongly in CHIKV-infected cells between 6 and 12 h p.i. the expression level of TIA-1 and TIAR proteins increased 2-fold within 6 h p.i. most of the dsRNA and dsRNA signals were clearly not colocalizing. at 6 h p.i. there was a very limited overlap between puncta and puncta. at 8 h p.i. most of the dsRNA and dsRNA signals were clearly not colocalizing. RNA synthesizing activity was assessed with an in vitro assay. the levels of CHIKV nsP3, nsP4, G3BP1 and G3BP2 in the P15 and S15 fractions were determined by Western blotting (WB) we did not observe complete colocalization between the nsP1 and nsP4 foci and the dsRNA puncta. the bulk of nsP3 was found in the cytosolic S15 fraction. G3BP1 and G3BP2 were detected exclusively in the S15 fraction. this suggests that they are not associated with the RTCs. G3BP-depleted, CHIKV-infected cells were analyzed for E2 expression. eGFP expression was quantified at 16, 20, or 24 h p.i., depending on the MOI used. cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI, 5) 48 h after siRNA transfection. the virus was normalized to cells transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA (100%) the siRNA-transfected cells were infected with a CHIK reporter virus at 20 h p.i. the eGFP expression was quantified, and cell viability assays performed in parallel showed no negative effect of G3BP depletion. the combined depletion of G3BP1 and G3BP2 reduced eGFP levels even further (80%) sensitivity of CHIKV replication to G3BP depletion is striking. simultaneous depletion of the two G3BPs also inhibited SINV replication. depletion of G3BP1 alone barely affected SINV replication. single siRNA duplexes 2 to 4 reduced CHIKV replication to various extents, but all single siRNAs reduced GFP expression by 50% or more (Fig. 5B and C). CHIKV replication was more efficient in cells in which G3BP2 was depleted with siRNA 4 than in those transfected with siRNA 2. 3BP2 depletion, siRNA 2 also caused off-target effects. mutant siRNAs should no longer induce knockdown of target while still causing the same off-target effects as the corresponding targeting siRNA. the total level of viral protein was lower in G3BP-depleted cells at this early time point. but P123 was processed at the same rate and no additional uncleaved intermediates were found. CHIKV nonstructural polyprotein processing, rate of RNA synthesis, and entry were not specifically affected by the absence of G3BP. transfection of control cells with CHIKV RNA led to readily detectable amounts of negative-strand RNA by 4 h p.t., after which genome and sgRNA levels increased rapidly in the next 2 h. also in G3BP-depleted cells replication of transfected CHIKV RNA was detected. infection at a very high MOI is thought to provide enough input RNA to render translation largely independent of newly synthesized RNA. western blot analysis revealed only minor differences in nsP levels between G3BP-depleted and control cells. decrease in luciferase expressed from the duplicated subgenomic promoter in G3BP-depleted cells. this is in line with the effect of G3BP depletion on eGFP reporter gene expression. the increase of nsP3-Rluc signal in the luciferase assay contrasts with the apparent decrease shown by Western blotting. luciferase activity was determined at 8 h p.i. and normalized to the activity in cells transfected with control siRNAs. CHIKV-P3Rluc RNA was transfected into control and G3BP-depleted cells. luciferase expression was quantified at various time points. CHIKV-nsP3-Rluc RNA was a replication-competent protein. luciferase activity was detected at 4 h posttransfection. a further increase in luciferase signal was observed, likely driven by translation of newly synthesized positive-strand RNA. CHIKV-induced granules did not contain other SG markers, like TIA-1, TIAR, eIF3 or PABP. lack of these proteins in the CHIKV-induced granules was not due to their absence in the infected cell. the observed inhibition of CHIKV replication in siRNA-transfected cells could be rescued by expressing siRNA-resistant G3BP2. this was further corroborated by the use of C911 mutant siRNAs and by showing that coxsackievirus replication was not affected in G3BP2-depleted cells. this is illustrated by the fact that knockdown of G3BP1 did not affect CHIKV replication. G3BPs were found to be present in a fraction containing active SFV RTCs in a proteomics analysis of isolated cytopathic vacuoles (44). which proportion of total cellular G3BPs was present in this fraction, however, was not determined. technical limitations did not allow us to study the composition and in vitro activity of the early (negative-strand RNA-synthesizing) RTCs. nsP synthesis is in line with the observed close-to-normal nsP levels and the slightly enhanced luciferase signal of a recombinant virus expressing an nsP3-Rluc fusion protein in G3BP-depleted cells. a less efficient switch from translation to genome amplification after G3BP depletion would explain the observed reduction of RNA levels and structural protein expression. the interaction between nsP3 and G3BPs appears to occur in SG-like structures that differ in composition and behavior from traditional SGs. early in infection, nsP3 is present at low levels (and as part of the polyprotein), and it could then recruit G3BPs to the genomic RNA that is being translated, to mediate or support the switch from translation to the synthesis of negative-strand RNA. at 4 h p.i. we observed some colocalization of dsRNA and G3BPs. at 8 h p.i. there clearly was no colocalization of dsRNA with the nsP3- and G3BP2-containing granules. nsP3 levels appeared to be more strongly affected by G3BP depletion than the other nonstructural proteins, suggesting a role for G3BPs in stabilizing nsP3 KV replication."}
