{"summary": "H5N1 outbreaks recurred in 2003, persistently affecting poultry farms in many Southeast Asia countries, such as china, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. virus rapidly became endemic in Indonesia and continued to cause sporadic zoonotic transmissions to humans. a variety of antigenically distinct sublineages of genotype Z genotype virus have been established [16]. Unlike Vietnam and Thailand, Indonesia was invaded by only a single sublineage of genotype Z virus. previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that Hunan province of China may be the source of the initial H5N1 outbreak in Indonesia [17] the group 3 lineage in the MP, M1, M2, and PB1 phylogenies was only represented by the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain. the pre-emergence lineage is highlighted in gray in M1 phylogeny (B) Arrows indicate the roots. we chose to be conservative, and did not include poorly supported branches (e.g., earlier viruses) in our viral group definition. we did not define a group corresponding to the group B of Smith et al. GARD detected two well-supported breakpoints near the boundaries of MP and PB1 segments in the concatenated genomes. all three analyses agreed that the newly reassortant strains had arisen from acquiring PB1 and MP genome segments from the group 3 lineage and the remaining segments from the group 2 lineage. some group 2 viruses also cluster inside the reassortant subgroups. the divergence between the reassortant subgroups and other intercalating group 2 viruses is low. the times and number of reassortment events that generated the putative mosaic reassortant viruses remains elusive. the tMRCA of all reassortant viruses (All-tMRCA) was dated to July 2005 (highest probability density, HPD confidence interval: April\u2013October), which is consistent with the linear regression estimate in Figure 3A and 3B. the regression estimate of All-tMRCA for the NA gene (April 2005) is slightly older than the BMCMC estimate (July 2005). the majority (17/25) of reassortant viruses were isolated from Greater Jakarta and surrounding areas such as Bekasi and Banten. the remaining eight samples were isolated from more distant locations in west Java province, such as Indramayu and Karawang. the two earliest reassortant viruses were isolated from central and east Jakarta (Table 1). indramayu, West Java (9) 6-1-06 14-1-06 14-1-06 R3 IDN/CDC940/06 74 Y M 30 m Karawang, West Java (9) 5-11-06 13-11-06 12-11-06 R3 IDN/CDC759/06 59 Y F 35 Cikelet, West Java (10) 8-8-06 17-8-06 17-8-06 R3 IDN/CDC669/06 51 Y M 13 South Jakarta (3) 9-6 2-10-06 14-10-06 14-10-06 R2 IDN/CDC1031/07 75 Y M 14 West Jakarta (6) 31-12-06 10-1-07 5-1-07 R2 IDN/CDC523/06 30 Y F 10 m Kapuk, West Jakarta (6) 17-3-06 23-3-06 23-3-06 R2 IDN/CDC699/06 53 Y F 3 suburb of Jakarta (5)b 23-6-06 6-7-06 6-7-06 R2 IDN/ only parental strains genetically close to the reassortant viruses are shown in the map. a zoom-in of Greater Jakarta (G. Jakarta) and surroundings is illustrated separately in a dashed-line bounded box. si Selatan including Papua was more frequent than expected under the null hypothesis. there is relatively little viral migration from the rest of Java to Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua. PB2 gene (codons 76, 534, 627, 677 and 740) and PA gene (codon 409) of the reassortant viruses were positively selected. HA codon 129 (starting from HA1) and M1 gene codon 205 were the only selected sites identified by the FEL and REL methods. three (residue 37, 95, and 137) of them are located close to the electrostatic positive surface of the N-terminal domain of the M1 protein molecule. one (residue 249) is located in the remaining C-terminal fragment. phylogenetic trees of Indonesian H5N1 viruses reconstructed from 12 separate gene datasets. phylogenetic trees of Indonesian H5N1 influenza viruses reconstructed from (A) HA gene; (B) M1 gene; (C) M2 gene. topological supports (>90) summarized from 1,000 ML bootstrap replications. a selected dataset of manually concatenated full genomes was analyzed. the putative reassortants showed a high degree of sequence similarity. reassortants showed a high degree of sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering. reassortant viruses are classified into three subgroups (R1, R2, and R3) with bootstrap support of 80% or better. some group 2 viruses also cluster inside the reassortant subgroups (Figures 1A and S2C) the times and number of reassortment events that generated the putative mosaic reassortant viruses remains elusive. we examine both the single and multiple origin hypotheses in subsequent analyses, excluding the intercalating group 2 viruses from the reassortant group. the tMRCA estimates range from May 2005 to April 2006. this suggests that the regression method was sensitive to rate variation caused by the two potential recent reassortants. the majority (17/25) of reassortant viruses were isolated from Greater Jakarta and surrounding areas. the MRCA of all reassortants (and the MRCAs of each reassortant subgroup) likely originated from Greater Jakarta and surroundings (Table S2;

however, virus sequences are not available. numbers in parentheses are unique references to localities shown in Figure 4. strain, the observed GSC value was not significantly lower than the null value expected under panmixis. however, the observed geographic structure is not significantly different to that expected by chance alone. migrations between mainland Java, Sumatera and Sulawesi Selatan including Papua are insignificantly (p>0.2) and significantly (p0.0002) lower than the null values respectively. the group 2 viruses consistently show a slow growth in relative genetic diversity over time. the reassortant viruses initially showed an abrupt rise in relative genetic diversity followed by stabilization, which visually resembles a logistic growth curve with two phases [24],[25]. a similar observation can also be made. the dN/dS values for the M1 gene in this lineage were estimated to be 1.514 (95% CI: 0.447\u20133.814; see Table S5) this lineage-specific elevation of dN/dS was not significant (LRT p>0.1) for other genes (i.e. HA, NA, M2, PB1; see Table S5). reassortant viruses' genome segments descended from the group 3 ancestral viruses. the remaining six (PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, NS) segments descended from the group 2 ancestral viruses. the majority of reassortant viruses are human isolates, but few of the associated human infections are epidemiologically linked. three of the inferred residue changes are located close to the electropositive surface of N-terminal domain of M1 protein that acts to bind viral RNA [30],[31]. the M1 matrix protein mediates encapsulation of viral RNA-nucleoproteins into membrane envelope during packaging [31], and has close contact with other viral proteins inside the viral particle. the common ancestor of the reassortant viruses is dated to July 2005. more complex hypotheses of viral origin and migration trajectory cannot be investigated. we opted for a lower geographical resolution (i.e., four widely ranged geographical states instead of distinct geographical coordinate for each viral isolate) reassortant viruses follow a logistic-like growth curve, which is typical for virus invasion and maintenance. the reassortant viruses did not kill human faster than other Indonesian H5N1 viruses did. we would recommend more experimental studies addressing the virulence, pathogenicity and immunogenicity of the reassortant viruses. reassortant viruses were isolated from a dead cat in Jakarta. reassortant viruses have been reported in sporadic human infections. reassortant viruses could be transmitted to other susceptible individuals. reassortant viruses have evolved into different genetic lines that have spread across Indonesia. reassortant viruses have distinctive evolutionary and transmission dynamics. reassortant viruses should be added to the watch list for future epidemiological surveillance. phylogenetic analyses Phylogenetic trees of 12 alignment datasets were reconstructed using the ML approach implemented in PhyML 3.412 [56]. the robustness of the ML tree topology was assessed by comparing the ML topology with the topologies sampled in the BMCMC analysis performed in MrBayes version 3.1.2 [57], and with bootstrapping analyses of 1,000 pseudo-replicate datasets. the eight gene segment alignments were manually concatenated in the order of their length to generate a single alignment of complete genome sequences. the hypothesis of reassortment was supported if the recombinant breakpoints were detected near the junctions where the genome segments were manually concatenated. the null distribution and critical values were generated by randomly shuffling the states of isolates 5,000 times. migratory history of group 2 viruses was also studied using the HA gene in a similar manner. each group 2 virus was assigned to either of four widely ranged geographical states. identifying mutations fixed along the lineage The ancestral nucleotide sequence of all internal nodes were reconstructed using joint ML method [68] implemented in HYPHY. phylogenetic analyses Phylogenetic trees of 12 alignment datasets were reconstructed using the ML approach implemented in PhyML 3.412 [56]. the robustness of the ML tree topology was assessed by comparing the ML topology with the topologies sampled in the BMCMC analysis performed in MrBayes version 3.1.2 [57]. reassortant viruses were preliminarily identified by their topological incongruity across the phylogenies of different gene segments. this was further investigated using a smaller set of Indonesian H5N1 virus isolates with full genome sequences. the eight gene segment alignments were manually concatenated in order of their length to generate a single alignment of complete genome sequences. the geographical states of all ancestral nodes in the tree were estimated to achieve minimum state changes in overall. the number of state changes and state of the MRCA of the reassortant was obtained. the null distribution and critical values were generated by randomly shuffling the states of isolates 5,000 times. UCEN and UCLN relaxed clocks [21] were attempted independently. the best-fit model was selected by comparing the BF calculated from their posterior distributions. the resulting likelihood score of the two-ratio model was then compared with that of the one-ratio model.
