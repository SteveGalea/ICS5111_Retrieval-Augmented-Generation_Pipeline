{"summary": "the most effective way of approaching an epidemic is to rapidly supply vaccines related to the infectious diseases within a limited time [15]. the most effective way of approaching an epidemic that occurs at unexpected times and in unexpected places is to rapidly supply vaccines related to the infectious diseases within a limited time. however, during rapid vaccine developments performed to date, there has been little consideration given to establishing a precise safety protocol. the C57BL/6 (B6) and ICR mice were assigned to 6 groups (n = 4): group 1, B6/PBS; group 2, B6/LPS(S); group 3, B6/LPS(E); group 4, ICR/PBS; group 5, ICR/LPS(S); and group 6, ICR/LPS(E). all mice were sacrificed after 3 h of EB exposure (4 h PI) natant of each sample was diluted 1:3 with ethanol. the fluorescence intensity was measured at 620 ex and 680 em. the EB concentration of each sample was calculated according to a standard curve. the ratio of EB in brain to EB in blood was calculated. homogenized hemisphere was incubated in trizol and chloroform reagent. the aqueous phase was removed and incubated with 100% isopropanol. the refined protein extract solution was stored at 20\u00b0C. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed with SYBR Green dye. results were normalized to that of the housekeeping/control gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) membranes were incubated with rabbit anti\u2013ZO-1 (1:2,000; Thermo Scientific, USA), mouse anti-occludin (1:2,000; Thermo Scientific), and rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; Cell Signaling Technology, USA) membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. the LPSs from S. enterica serotype enteritidis (L6011; Sigma, USA) and E. coli O55:B5 (L2880; Sigma) were separately dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) to a concentration of 1 mg/4 mL. for treatment, PBS or LPS in PBS were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into each mouse. mice were divided into 8 groups (n = 4) based on mouse strain and exposure time. RNA was extracted from one hemisphere by using Trizol reagent. protein was extracted from the other hemisphere by using PRO-PREP. sphere of each mouse was incubated in PRO-PREP solution. two different types of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from Salmonella enterica [LPS(S)] and Escherichia coli [LPS(E)] were tested in two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 [B6] and ICR) the mice were assigned to 6 groups (n = 4): group 1, B6/PBS; group 2, B6/LPS(S); group 3, B6/LPS(E); and group 6, ICR/LPS(E). we performed the EB assay according to the method described by Jangula and Murphy [14] with some modifications. the fluorescence intensity was measured at 620 ex and 680 em. the EB concentration of each sample was calculated according to a standard curve. the ratio of EB in brain to EB in blood was calculated. the mice were divided into 8 groups (n = 4) based on mouse strain and LPS exposure time. the aqueous phase was removed and incubated with 100% isopropanol. for protein extraction, the homogenized hemisphere of each mouse was incubated in PRO-PREP solution and centrifuged several times under ice-cold conditions. quantification of mRNA expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the brain. results normalized to that of the housekeeping/control gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) diluted rabbit anti\u2013ZO-1 (1:2,000; Thermo Scientific, USA), mouse anti-occludin (1:2,000; Thermo Scientific, USA) primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Vector, USA) occludin mRNA levels showed a decreasing tendency over 24 h in B6 mice. occludin mRNA levels showed a decreasing tendency over 24 h. occludin mRNA levels showed a significant increase at 24 h PI. ZO-1 and occludin protein expression tendencies were similar to mRNA results in both mouse strains. occludin protein expression levels increased between 0 and 24 h PI. occludin protein expression levels increased during 24 h after LPS(S) injection. expression after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in ICR mice. there were no significant changes in expressions of ZO-1 (A) and occludin (B) in B6 mice. the vaccine safety verification protocol for BBB and brain could be established by selecting optimum conditions and its results. qPCR method might be also suitable than WB method in terms of time requirement. the permeability of EB dye into brain parenchymal tissue after LPS injection is presented as a ratio of the EB dye amount in brain to that in blood. but between the two different mouse strains, the EB ratio was significantly higher in ICR mice than in B6 mice. the ZO-1 mRNA expressions (A) did not show a significant temporal pattern in B6 mice, whereas those expressions in ICR mice changed in a time-dependent manner. in the case of occludin mRNA expression (B), there was no significant increase at 2 and 4 h after LPS injection. the results of mRNA and protein levels have correlation each other. western blotting showed upward trends in ZO-1 (A) and occludin (B) expressions after lipopolysaccharide administration in ICR mice. arrow streams indicating translation activity show different time-dependent patterns in ZO-1 and occludin protein synthesis from mRNA in brain endothelial cells of ICR mice. qPCR method might be also suitable than WB method in terms of time requirement. salmonella enterica-derived LPS and vaccine are intraperitoneally injected into 7-week-old ICR mice. the mRNA is extracted, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using zonula occludens-1, occludin, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers. the BBB consists of capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. nutrients and oxygen in the bloodstream can permeate endothelial cells into the basal lamina through a variety of transport routes. disruption of TJs leads to barrier disruption. a high permeated EB ratio indicates a significantly damaged BBB structure. we used LPS from two sources (S. enterica and E. coli) and two strains of mice (B6 and ICR mice) the results from each strain showed different trends. qPCR results showed that occludin and ZO-1 mRNA levels dynamically changed in accordance with exposure time after LPS injection. the mRNA level increased until 4 h PI and was decreased at 24 h PI, recovering to the same level as that at 0 h PI in ICR mice brain. expressions of TJ-related mRNAs and proteins increase until TJ structure and function are restored through physiological processes in animal models. in both mouse strains, the mRNA and protein expression results correspond with EB assay results. however, we speculate on some important clues in which some diverse cytokine actions might be achieved by mouse strain-specific differences in signal transduction following LPS treatment. mRNA levels in ICR mice increased until 4 h PI and decreased until 24 h PI. this time lag is thought to be caused by the process requirements for protein synthesis from mRNA and protein expression regulatory activity of the biological mechanism within brain epithelial cells. if TJ mRNA levels of vaccine-injected group are significantly higher than those of the LPS-injected group 4 h after injection, one should consider the vaccine unsafe to BBB structure or function at the injected concentration. further studies should be undertaken to identify the exact time PI at which TJ mRNA and protein levels are altered."}
