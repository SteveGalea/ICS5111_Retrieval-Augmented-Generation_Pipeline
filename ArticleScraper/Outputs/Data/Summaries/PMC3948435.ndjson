{"summary": "about 10% of people present to primary healthcare services with sore throat each year. the causative organisms may be bacteria (most commonly Streptococcus) or viruses (typically rhinovirus), although it is difficult to distinguish bacterial from viral infections clinically. non-suppurative complications include acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. this review does not include people with previous rheumatic fever or previous glomerulonephritis. it also does not include people who are clinically seriously unwell. untreated symptoms disappear by 3 days in about 40% of people. untreated fevers in about 85%. by 1 week, 85% of people are symptom-free. we have performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions included in this review. the categorisation of the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) reflects the quality of evidence available for our chosen outcomes in our defined populations of interest. 0 Moderate Directness point deducted for population differences between studies 1 (92) Time off work or school Corticosteroids versus placebo in people receiving antibiotics 4 \u20132 0 0 0 Low Quality points deducted for sparse data and incomplete results. to achieve the final GRADE score for a given comparison, points are deducted or added from this initial score. two RCTs (158 people) identified by the review assessed the effects of paracetamol over 24 hours or less.
