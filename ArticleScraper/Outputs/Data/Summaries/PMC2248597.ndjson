{"summary": "cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction. dCAT-1 transfectants, but not mCAT-1 transfectants, were susceptible to virus-induced cytopathicity. dCAT-1 transfectants did not reproduce relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Spl574. ecotropic mouse leukemia virus (MLV) variants have altered host range. both viruses have amino acid substitutions at the same site in their RBDs. both viruses have altered host range, both are cytopathic. dunni cells differ from the prototypical CAT-1 gene of the laboratory mouse. the third extracellular loop contains the virus binding region has a substitution (I214V) and an inserted glycine after Y235, a residue critical for receptor function. dCAT-1-g was generated by mutagenesis. a different panel of virus isolates was capable of infecting and/or inducing syncytia in these transfectants suggesting that virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion are distinct receptor mediated phenomena. the possible contribution of differential glycosylation to these phenotypic differences was evaluated using Western analysis, treatment by glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove glycosylation sites. the infected cells were examined for cytopathicity over a period of 2\u20135 days. transfectants of all 3 cell lines expressing mCAT-1 showed no signs of cytopathicity. dCAT-1 expressing MA139 and MDCK cells formed syncytia within two days of infection with Friend virus isolate F-S MLV. syncytium formation was observed after infection with the Friend MLV isolates FBLV and FrMLV57. these syncytia were smaller and fewer in number, and appeared 1\u20132 days after the appearance of syncytia. the 5.5 kb bands representing the pol-probe reactive cleavage product of linear viral DNA were quantified by densitometric scanning. the indicated cultures of F-S MLV infected cells were photographed just before Hirt DNA extraction using objective lens magnification of 10. transfected cell lines carrying either mCAT-1 or dCAT-1 were tested using the XC plaque overlay test. the indicated cells were infected with virus dilutions, irradiated and overlaid with XC cells to identify virus infected cells. titers were reduced by more than 95% (1.3 log10) relative to NIH 3T3 (for MoMLV) or M. dunni cells (for Spl574) bCAT-1 gene expressed in transfected cells was significantly more susceptible to moMLV infection than untransfected M. dunni cells. cytopathicity of different virus isolates did not always correlate with the efficiency of virus replication in FerrD2 as determined by XC virus titer. the most cytopathic virus in FerrD2 cells, F-S MLV, produced an XC titer comparable to that of the rarely cytopathic MoMLV. no positive cells in cultures infected with 0.1 ml of undiluted pseudotype stock. Bold figures represent titer reduced by more than 95% (1.3 log10) relative to susceptible NIH 3T3 or M. dunni cells. dCAT-1 protein has two glycosylation sites, and both carry N-glycans. both sites are in the third extracellular loop which also contains residues implicated in virus binding and entry. western analysis confirmed the presence of a single band of about 55 kDa. dCAT-1-g expression in MA139 cells did not alter susceptibility to virus-induced syncytium by Spl574 or F-S MLV. transfectants showed no increase in their susceptibility to other ecotropic viruses. this is consistent with conclusion that dCAT-1 is associated with MoMLV resistance. cSyncytia were observed 2 days after virus infection. MA139 cells expressing dCAT-1-g resembled FerrD2 in their susceptibility to virus infection. no cytopathic response was observed with viruses that are also noncytopathic in FerrD2. Western analysis of M. dunni cells transfected with HA-tagged mCAT-1 showed none of the inhibitors had a significant effect on expression levels. all inhibitors reduced the size range of the mCAT-1 glycoprotein. s None DMM Sw 2DG CST Tu Spl574 NIH3T3 3.1 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.2 4.1 M. dunni 5.7 5.8 NT 5.8 NT 5.9 NT 5.5 M. dunni 2.7 4.4 4.7 4.9 4.1 4.5 aVirus was quantitated using the XC overlay assay. mCAT-1 and dCAT-1 expression in transfected cells was confirmed by Western analysis. dCAT-1 was detected as a heterogeneously glycosylated protein in each cell line. the molecular weight range of CAT-1 was lower in MDCK cells and Tb-1-Lu cells than in MA139 cells. these stable transfectants of MA139, Tb-1-Lu and MDCK cells were infected with a panel of ecotropic gammaretroviruses. the infected cells were examined for cytopathicity over a period of 2\u20135 days. dCAT-1 expressing MA139 and MDCK cells formed syncytia within two days of infection with Friend virus isolate F-S MLV. f-S MLV was most efficient in inducing syncytia in all dCAT-1 transfected cells. but syncytium formation was also observed following infection with the Friend MLV isolates FBLV and FrMLV57. these syncytia were smaller and fewer in number, and appeared 1\u20132 days after the appearance of syncytia. transfectant FerrM expresses mCAT-1 and the various FerrD transfectants express dCAT-1. DNAs were cleaved with EcoRI and hybridized with a probe representing the segment of pol indicated by the black bar. the indicated cultures of F-S MLV infected cells were photographed just before Hirt DNA extraction using objective lens magnification of 10. dCAT-1 but not mCAT-1 transfectants, increased viral DNA is associated with virus-induced cytopathicity in the transfected cells. transfected cell lines carrying either mCAT-1 or dCAT-1 were tested for susceptibility to a panel of ecotropic MLVs using the XC plaque overlay test. titers were reduced by more than 95% (1.3 log10) relative to NIH 3T3 (for MoMLV) or M. dunni cells (for Spl574) cSyncytia were observed 2 days after virus infection. dCAT-1 sequence variation is responsible for M. dunni resistance to MoMLV. the cytopathicity of different virus isolates did not always correlate with the efficiency of virus replication in FerrD2. the most cytopathic virus in FerrD2 cells, F-S MLV, produced an XC titer comparable to that of the rarely cytopathic MoMLV. no positive cells in cultures infected with 0.1 ml of undiluted pseudotype stock. Bold figures represent titer reduced by more than 95% (1.3 log10) relative to susceptible NIH 3T3 or M. dunni cells. M. dunni and FerrD2 cells express the same dCAT-1 receptor. but these cells differ in their relative infectivity by MoMLV and Spl574, and produce syncytia in response to different virus isolates. dCAT-1 may undergo different post-translational modification in the two cell lines. lycosylated dCAT-1-g protein is approximately 55 kDa. this lane contains a low molecular weight smear likely to be HA-containing breakdown artifacts. expression of dCAT-1-g did not alter susceptibility to virus-induced syncytium by Spl574 or F-S MLV. cSyncytia were observed 2 days after virus infection. MA139 cells expressing dCAT-1-g resembled FerrD2 in their susceptibility to virus infection. no cytopathic response was observed with viruses that are also noncytopathic in FerrD2. glycosylation inhibitors inhibit different enzymes involved in oligosaccharide trimming: castanospermine (CST), deoxymannojirimycin (DMM), deoxynojirimycin (DNM) and swainsonine (Sw) Western analysis of M. dunni cells transfected with HA-tagged mCAT-1 showed none of the inhibitors had a significant effect on expression levels. a virus was quantitated using the XC overlay assay [9] and numbers represent XC PFU in 0.2 ml. all inhibitors reduced the resistance of M. dunni cells to infection with MoMLV. we measured biotinylated CAT-1 in M. dunni cells transfected with mCAT-1. the level in DMM-treated cells is not significantly different from the untreated control. these results indicate that N-glycans can impede ecotropic MLV entry in cells expressing mCAT-1 as well as cells expressing dCAT-1. the dCAT-1 receptor variant is glycosylated at two sites. the dCAT-1 receptor variant is glycosylated at two sites. the dCAT-1 receptor variant is glycosylated at two sites. glycosylation modulates virus entry mediated by the laboratory mouse CAT-1 receptor, mCAT-1, in NIH 3T3 cells. this resistance is specific to Spl574 and is not seen in heterologous cells expressing mCAT-1. this resistance is not seen in heterologous cells expressing mCAT-1. these results indicate that N-glycans broadly regulate gammaretrovirus interactions with the CAT-1 receptor in cells of their natural host. it is possible that glycosylated proteins other than CAT-1 may contribute to this resistance. a similar lack of correlation between infectivity and syncytium formation has been reported in a mouse cell line. f-s MLV is an N-tropic FrMLV isolate. FBLV is a biologically cloned virus originally provided by R. Risser (U. Wisc., Madison, Wisc.) 2 104 cells in six-well tissue culture plates or 105 cells in 60 mm plates were infected with virus-containing medium in the presence of 4 ug/ml polybrene. cells were examined by light microscopy using objective lenses of 4\u201320 and photographed using a Nikon TS100 microscope. the deduced amino acid sequence of the third extracellular loop was identical to that described by Eiden and her coworkers. the fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment of plasmid pcdna3:MCAT-1Flutag which contains the HA-tagged NIH 3T3 CAT-1 receptor (mCAT-1) the amplified product was digested with AgeI and FseI to generate a 1.1 kb fragment containing the mutant sequence. this fragment was ligated into the dCAT-1 clone to generate dCAT-1-g. the presence of the two mutations was confirmed by restriction digestion. supernatants containing pseudotype virus were collected from transfected human 293 cells, filtered and used to infect cells that had been plated in 12-well culture dishes. the cells were infected with appropriate dilutions of pseudotype virus in the presence of 4\u20138 g/ml polybrene. the membrane was stripped using streptavidin beads (Pierce, catalog no. 29200) and reprobed using HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce; catalog no. 21126). Viruses Three ecotropic MLV isolates were obtained from J. W. Hartley (NIAID, Bethesda, MD) XC cells produce plaques containing syncytia in response to focal areas of virus infected cells. plates were fixed and stained 3 days later and examined for plaques of syncytia. cells were treated prior to virus infection by various inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation. the 965 bp product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. the deduced amino acid sequence of the third extracellular loop was identical to that described by Eiden and her coworkers. gene was digested with AgeI and FseI to generate a 1.1 kb fragment. this fragment was ligated into the dCAT-1 clone to generate dCAT-1-g. the presence of the two mutations was confirmed by restriction digestion. pCL-eco retrovirus packaging vector (Imgenex Co., San Diego, Calif.) was used to generate pseudotypes with Moloney ecotropic Env. supernatants containing pseudotype virus were collected from transfected human 293 cells, filtered and used to infect cells that had been plated in 12-well culture dishes. proteins were purified using streptavidin beads (Pierce, catalog no. 29200) the membrane was reprobed using HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce; catalog no. 21126) Competing interests The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."}
