{"summary": "there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from PEDV. the N-terminal subunit of spike protein (S1) is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes. therefore, we expressed and produced recombinant S1 protein to protect newborn piglets. there were no significant differences in diarrhea, body weight and virus shedding. however, vaccination with S1 subunit vaccine failed to provide complete protection to suckling piglets after challenge exposure. further improvements are needed for development of a subunit vaccine that fully protects against PEDV infection."}
