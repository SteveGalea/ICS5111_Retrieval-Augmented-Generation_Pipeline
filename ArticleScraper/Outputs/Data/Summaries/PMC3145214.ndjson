{"summary": "asthma control in children is a well documented public health problem in the us. it is associated with frequent exacerbations that cause respiratory symptoms, activity limitation, school absenteeism, and parental work absenteeism. exacerbations are seasonal with the greatest risk among elementary-age students occurring shortly after returning to school following summer break. review by Meadows and Le Saux [28] did not find sufficient evidence to specifically recommend hand sanitizer use in general or among children with asthma. however, a review by Jefferson et al. [15] concluded that hand washing did reduce viral respiratory infections. the original design was a randomized, longitudinal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, community-based crossover trial. d of 30 elementary schools with approximately 15,000 students recruited for participation. the system was racially (70% white and 30% black) and economically (33% eligible for free or reduced lunches) diverse. students with asthma were to be recruited by school nurses who sent information packets home to parents. benzalkonium chloride was designated \u2018GRAS\u2019 for topical antiseptic applications by the fda. it was effective against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria associated with nosocomial infections and many viruses associated with upper respiratory infections including human coronavirus and adenovirus. a doserTM was to be attached to each student\u2019s inhaler to record each actuation of quick relief medication. the count was to be recorded every 2 weeks by the study staff. compliance with hand hygiene recommendations was to be estimated. a data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) was established to monitor adverse events. two asthma safety events were mandated as reportable. a red PFM reading (50% of personal best) with symptoms 3 days in a row. the only viable option was to switch to an alcohol-based product. benzalkonium chloride prevented the use of a subject-blinded design because there was no placebo for an alcohol-based product. principal investigator and key study personnel made this decision in close collaboration with the NHLBI project officer and DSMB over the course of multiple teleconferences. redesigned study addressed an important research question using a methodologically rigorous design without compromising student safety. schools would be randomly assigned to use study-provided hand sanitizer and hand soap (intervention arm) or to hand washing only (usual care arm) hand sanitizer use in intervention schools was a potential bias to the null effect. the revised protocol was a randomized, longitudinal, community-based crossover trial. a compromise was reached by installing hand soap dispensers in each school prior to the start of their intervention year. the potential use of hand soap dispensers during the usual care year posed less of a carry-over/contamination risk than the use of hand sanitizer dispensers would. sanitizer/active ingredient Ethyl alcohol (62% solution) in foam (Purell\u00ae instant hand sanitizer foam) revised data collection The data collection procedures for the primary outcome remained unchanged; however, two new instruments were designed to evaluate the school environment as it related to hand hygiene practices. the first instrument was used to conduct a one-time baseline assessment of each school\u2019s \u2018fixed\u2019 environmental facilities. the persistence of the effect may bias the measured effect of the second intervention. a summer break provides a 10-week \u2018wash out\u2019 period that should minimize any carryover effect since no reinforcement is provided to original intervention schools. crossover between intervention and placebo schools occurred during the summer break between the first and second year. primary outcome The primary outcome was the proportion of students who experienced an asthma exacerbation each month defined as one or more of the following. all hand sanitizers were to be provided by the study. no soap, paper towels, or air dryers were to be provided. students, faculty, and staff in all schools would be instructed on hand washing and hand sanitizer techniques. preliminary data suggest alcohol-based products might be inferior to nonalcohol-based products [33,34] benzalkonium chloride had been shown to increase over multiple, consecutive washes. 50% of those using ethyl alcohol reported hand pain or discomfort. no one using benzalkonium chloride reported similar symptoms. study was powered to detect a time averaged difference of 7.5\u201310% between the exacerbation rates of the intervention and control schools. the study was approved and to be monitored by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Arizona. crossover between intervention and placebo schools occurred during the summer break between the first and second year. primary outcome The primary outcome was the proportion of students who experienced an asthma exacerbation each month defined as one or more of the following. all hand sanitizer was to be provided by the study and was to be placed in the lunchrooms and classrooms. students, faculty, and staff in all schools would be instructed on hand washing and hand sanitizer techniques based on the \u2018always be clean\u2019 hand hygiene program developed by Woodward Laboratories Incorporated. preliminary data suggest alcohol-based products might be inferior to nonalcohol-based products [33,34] benzalkonium chloride had been shown to increase over multiple, consecutive washes. 50% of those using ethyl alcohol reported hand pain or discomfort. study was powered to detect a time averaged difference of 7.5\u201310% between the exacerbation rates of the intervention and control schools given a sample size between 468 and 650 students with asthma. safety monitoring The study was approved and to be monitored by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Arizona. concerns arose regarding the safety of benzalkonium chloride. no nonalcohol-based hand sanitizer substitute was available. community standards changed regarding typical hand hygiene practices in the schools. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreak in several schools prior to study. despite reassurance by local health department that hand washing remained the best option for hand hygiene, community perceptions were so strong that a hand washing only arm was no longer viable option. schools would be randomly assigned to use study-provided hand sanitizer and hand soap. crossover would still occur after the first year. parents and school faculty countered personal hand sanitizer use. the revised intervention consisted of a two-step hand hygiene practice that included regular hand washing with soap and water supplemented by hand sanitizer use. to overcome resource barriers to adequate hand hygiene practices in intervention schools, the study provided intervention schools with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, hand soap, and needed refills. benzalkonium chloride hand sanitizer was promoted as a supplement to hand washing. only schools in the intervention arm received the annual training and monthly refreshers. some of this variation was attributable to the inconsistent supply of hand hygiene resources among some schools. data were used to describe hand hygiene resource availability in the usual care schools. it was deemed important to estimate the incremental value of hand sanitizer use. economic analysis was added as a study aim to estimate additional costs of hand sanitizer use. the persistence of the effect may bias the measured effect of the second intervention. a summer break provides a 10-week \u2018wash out\u2019 period that should minimize any carryover effect. changes in behavioral practices typically decline by 40\u201380% after 6 weeks without reinforcement. a compromise was reached by installing hand soap dispensers, instead of hand sanitizer dispensers, in each school prior to the start of their intervention year. schools were concerned that removing dispensers after the intervention year might damage walls so we agreed to leave them in place. two new data collection instruments were designed to evaluate the school environment as it related to hand hygiene practices. the first instrument was used to conduct a baseline assessment of each school\u2019s \u2018fixed\u2019 environmental facilities with regard to the availability, type and working condition of sinks, soap dispensers and hand drying devices. the second instrument was used for monthly monitoring of the availability of hand hygiene resources at each school. Revised data analysis Power calculations were revised based on the updated study design using the monthly frequency of episodes of poor asthma control (EPAC) as the primary outcome. two general scenarios were assumed: one where there was no carryover effects (data from both years) and one where such effects (each year evaluated separately) trial status Enrollment was completed in may 2009 with a total of 527 students enrolled in 30 schools (mean = 17.6 per school) the enrollment per school exceeded the estimate used to calculate the study\u2019s power. the intervention began in august 2009 and will end in may 2011. the impact of eliminating the subject-blinded design was magnified by the abrupt change in community hand hygiene practices within the schools. if personal hand sanitizer use had not been prevalent in usual care schools, the crossover design would have been a robust test of hand sanitizer as compared with hand washing alone. data system support was provided by blueCross and BlueShield of Alabama."}
