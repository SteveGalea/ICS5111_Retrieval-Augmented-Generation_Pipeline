{"summary": "bats are the putative natural reservoir hosts for a number of emerging zoonotic viruses including Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus. attempts to isolate a SL-CoV from bats have failed and attempts to isolate other bat-borne viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been similarly unsuccessful. new stable bat cell lines are needed to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. the discovery of SL-CoVs in horseshoe bats has triggered attempts internationally to isolate a SL-CoV from a variety of bat species. however, attempts to isolate other bat viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been equally difficult. research into bat biology, immunology in particular, and bat-virus interaction will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis. the development of new stable cell lines for in vitro studies is essential and would greatly reduce the dependence on the use of live bats. telomeres are shortened with repeated cell divisions resulting in cells entering a state of senescence then cell death. the ectopic expression of hTERT has been successfully used to immortalise primary cell lines in a range of mammalian species. this approach results in minimal phenotypic and genotypic changes. method 2, trypsin treatment at 4\u00b0C overnight, was found to be the most effective and reliable in generating viable cell cultures across the majority of different tissue types. the comparatively long incubation time in trypsin allowed greater penetration and better digestion of the tissue as compared to Method 1. oidal cells were observed in cultures generated from brain. cells derived from a brain and kidney after 5 days in primary cell culture. cells from all tissue types grew well and were able to be passaged a number of times. cell line nomenclature: first two letters indicated species (Pa = Pteropus alecto); second two letters represent the abbreviation of the original organ type from which the cell line was derived. the fifth letter indicates methods of immortalisation (T = SV40T and H = hTERT); the clone number is provided at the end in two-digit format. the predicted 454-bp fragment was obtained for P. alecto DNA. no PCR product was produced from the DNA samples of any of the other five mammalian species. however, sequencing of the P. alecto PCR product confirmed that it is highly conserved with the same region in the closely related P. vampyrus genome. Western blot of untransformed P. alecto spleen and kidney primary cells and transformed cells (lanes 2 and 4) to detect expression of the SV40 large T antigen. cloning of the newly immortalised cells was considered an essential step in the establishment of the cell lines. cloning will necessarily reduce the heterogeneity of the cell types present in the cell line. only the primary heart cell line showed limited infection even after 72 hours. the significance of this apparent difference is unclear. in cloned immortalised cell lines, a difference was observed in infection kinetics in different lines. the stimulation of type I interferon gene expression by poly IC was examined in selected SV40T cloned immortalised cell lines. results suggest that there is significant variation in the increase of type I interferon gene expression after poly IC treatment. the increase in IFN- is greater than that for all the cell lines tested so far. cubation time in trypsin allowed greater penetration and better digestion of the tissue compared to Method 1, where trypsin treatment was at 37\u00b0C. Attempts to establish cell culture from tissues grown in Xten GO serum free medium was the least successful. cells derived from liver (left) and kidney (right) after 12 days in primary cell culture. cells from all tissue types grew well and were able to be passaged a number of times. growth of non-immortalised primary cell cultures diminished significantly for most tissue types after approximately 10 passages. cell line nomenclature: first two letters indicated species (Pa = Pteropus alecto); second two letters represent the abbreviation of the original organ type from which the cell line was derived. the fifth letter indicates methods of immortalisation (T = SV40T and H = hTERT); the clone number is provided at the end in two-digit format. no PCR product was produced from the DNA samples of any of the other five mammalian species. however, sequencing of the P. alecto PCR product confirmed that it is highly conserved with the same region in the closely related P. vampyrus genome. cloning of the newly immortalised cells was considered an essential step in the establishment of the cell lines. cloning will ensure that the cell line is derived from a single cell type. this is critical to the production of cell lines that have consistent, reproducible characteristics. NiV infected PaKiT02 cells produced detectable viral antigen levels. same infection in the PaKiH01 cells resulted in less than 25% of the cells producing detectable viral antigens at the same time point. differences could no longer be seen at 48 hours. the results show that there is significant variation in the increase of type I interferon gene expression after poly IC treatment. it is also interesting to note that the increase in IFN- is greater than that for IFN- in all the cell lines tested so far. the enzymatic treatment approach was superior to the physical disruption method. the overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C provided the best results, probably due to the better penetration of the enzyme solution. this is the first successful application of these approaches to cells of bat origin. difference in infectivity and kinetics of virus replication was observed among primary cells and cloned immortalised cells. a wide response range was observed between the bat cell lines tested. a wide response range was observed between the bat cell lines. we are producing more P. alecto specific reagents (real time PCR and antibodies) in parallel, we are producing more P. alecto specific reagents (real time PCR and antibodies) for a more comprehensive examination of innate immunity in different cell lines generated in this study. these cell lines are pivotal tools for future studies of virus-bat interaction and the role of the bat immune system in controlling virus infection. phosphate buffered saline (PBS) contains 200 mg/l disodium EDTA (Gibco), 100 units/ml Penicillin
