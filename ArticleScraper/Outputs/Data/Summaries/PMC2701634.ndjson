{"summary": "RT is a multifunctional enzyme that possesses RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerase activities. it converts single-stranded viral RNA into double-stranded DNA upon viral entry into host cells. the biologically active form of HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits. mutations in -H and -I do not affect P/T binding or fidelity significantly. several -H mutants exhibit lower binding affinity, processivity and frameshift fidelity [9]\u2013[12]. ds, pLAI.2, pNL4-3-E-EGFP and pHEF-VSV-G were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. the pNL4-3-E-EGFP based mutants (Y271A, G273A, I274A, K275A, V276A, R277A) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange II XL Site-Direct mutant residues and the enzyme cleavage sequence are underlined. mutant residues and the enzyme cleavage sequence are underlined. 293FT cells were co-transfected with 7.5 g wild-type or mutant pNL4-3-E-EGFP, 2.5 g pHEF-VSV-G, or 10 g wild-type or mutant pLAI.2 using Lipofectamine 2000. the cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped from each plate and lyzed in cell lysis buffer. U373-MAGI-CXCR4CEM and MT-2 cells were infected with live viruses. cells were stained with 400 g/ml of X-Gal (5-bromo- 4-chloro-3-indolyl--D- galactopyranoside), 4 mM MgCl2, 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, and 4 mM potassium ferricyanide in PBS for 2 h at 37\u00b0C viral supernatants containing 2 g p24 were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 2 h at 40,000g. the pellets were resuspended in 50 l lysis buffer. RT activities of mutants were calculated and compared to that of wild type pseudovirus. Western blotting a polyprotein and its products were tested by Western blotting. the proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electro-blotted onto Hybond-P PVDF membrane. membrane was incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. the wild type and mutant p66 in supernatants were purified using Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen, Germany) the purified p66 proteins were subjected to NativePage Novex Bis-Tris gel analysis and Western blotting. the open reading frame of RT p66 subunit was amplified from wild type or mutant pNL4-3-E-EGFP using a pair of primers and cloned into pET-28b vector (Novagen, Shanghai) the paired primers used for site-directed mutagenesis and construction of plasmids are listed in Table 1. 293FT cells were co-transfected with 7.5 g wild-type or mutant pNL4-3-E-EGFP, and 2.5 g pHEF-VSV-G. supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and stored at 80\u00b0C after spinning down and filtering to remove cell debris. cell lysates were stored at 20\u00b0C after centrifugation at 13,000g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min to remove cell debris. one cycle infection assay was carried out using normalized pseudoviruses. cells were diluted in DMEM containing 20 g/ml of DEAE-dextran. cells were stained with 400 g/ml of X-Gal (5-bromo- 4-chloro-3-indolyl--D- galactopyranoside), 4 mM MgCl2, 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, and 4 mM potassium ferricyanide in PBS for 5 min. cells cultured on coverslip in 24-well culture plate were transfected with 600 ng pNL4-3-E-EGFP and 200 ng pHEF-VSV-G. two days post-transfection, cells were fixed with 500 l 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) after washing 3 times with PBS, 500 l of 50 mM ammonium chloride was incubated with the cells for 10 min. membrane washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG, 14000) for 1 h. blots were rewashed three times in 0.1% PBST. RT sequences of 1083 HIV-1 strains obtained from the HIV complete sequence database were aligned and compared. based on X-ray crystal structures of HIV-1 RT (1RTH) from the research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) structural models of wild type and mutant RTs were analyzed using Stata statistical software. RT activity and RT proteins were undetectable in pseudoviral particles of mutants Y271A and I274A. this result was further confirmed using wild type, Y271A and I274A live viruses. this result was further confirmed using wild type, Y271A and I274A live viruses. RT activity in wild type and mutant pseudoviruses was tested by reverse transcriptase assay using a colorimetric kit. the viral particles in supernatant were concentrated and normalized (6 ng p24) the results are expressed as mean % of 3 independent experiments as compared to RT activity in wild type virus. expression of Gag-Pol polyprotein (Pr160Gag-pol), Gag protein (Pr55Gag) and capsid protein p24 (CA p24) in lysed cells transfected with pseudoviral vectors expressing wild type (WT) RT or Y271A and I274A mutants were further detected by immunofluorescence staining. Y271A and I274A mutants were detected at a level similar to that of the wild type pseudoviral particles. so, Pr160gag-pol was indeed incorporated into the virions and processed properly. pseudoviruses of wild type and mutants were generated in the presence or absence of indinavir, a highly specific inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. protease (PR p11) and capsid protein p24 (CA p24) were detected in wild type (WT) as well as Y271A and I274A mutant pseudoviruses produced in the absence of 0.2 and 2 M protease inhibitor (indinavir) by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-CA. mutant p66 subunits were likely tetramer and octamer based on their molecular weights. however, the exact nature of the oligomers formed by mutant p66 subunits remained to be clarified. this result implicated that dimer formation might be necessary for the stability of RT and its resistance to proteolysis after incorporation of Gag-Pol polyprotein into viral particles. phenylalanine (F), histidine (H) and cysteine (C) occur rarely (1%). isoleucine (I) is the predominant naturally existent amino acid at 274, which accounts for 98.43%. in less than 2% of all cases, valine (V) and leucine (L) are found at this site. 271Y, 271F, 271H and 271C residues as well as the lethal 271A mutation of p51 subunit. the same area was highlighted above in the left panel of Fig. 6A. a big side chain (pink) is found in naturally occurring residues but not in 271A. infection of jurkat cells with wild type and six mutants of pseudovirus was detected by flow cytometry. the uninfected cells were included as negative control. the infection was determined by the positive rate of infected cells expressing GFP, which was carried by the virus, at 48 h post-infection. RT activity in wild type and mutant pseudoviruses was tested by reverse transcriptase assay using a colorimetric kit. the viral particles in supernatant were concentrated and normalized (6 ng p24) the results are expressed as mean % of 3 independent experiments as compared to RT activity in wild type virus. expression of Gag-Pol polyprotein (Pr160Gag-pol), Gag protein (Pr55Gag) and capsid protein p24 (CA p24) in lysed cells transfected with pseudoviral vectors expressing wild type (WT) RT or Y271A and I274A mutants were further detected by immunofluorescence staining. in the absence of indinavir, both RT p66 and p51 were readily detected in the wild type pseudovirus, but not in the mutant viruses. both RT p66 and p51 were readily detected in the wild type virus, but not in the mutant viruses. however, both RT p66 and p51 were significantly reduced in the wild type virus, but became detectable in mutant Y271A viral particles. p24 (CA p24) in wild type (WT) and mutant pseudoviruses were detected by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-IN, anti-PR and anti-CA antibodies. Pr160Gag-pol and its subunits RT p66 and p51 were detected in wild type (WT) as well as Y271A and I274A mutant pseudoviruses produced in the absence (0) or presence of 0.2 and 2 M protea mutant p66 subunits were likely tetramer and octamer based on their molecular weights. however, the treatment with -mercaptoethanol could partially disrupt the higher order oligomers. this result implicated that dimer formation might be necessary for the stability of RT and its resistance to proteolysis after incorporation of Gag-Pol polyprotein into viral particles. isoleucine (I) is the predominant naturally existent amino acid at 274, which accounts for 98.43%. in less than 2% of all cases, valine (V) and leucine (L) are found at this site. structural analysis suggested that these amino acids might probably play important role in maintaining the active conformation of RT. the same area was highlighted above in the left panel of Fig. 6A. a big side chain (pink) is found in naturally occurring residues but not in 271A. discussion of HIV RT plays a key role in viral replication. loss of RT activity may be attributed to absence of RT in viral particles. mutant RT is incorporated into the virion in the form of Pr160gag-pol. mutant RT did not exist in the virion, so replication was abrogated. RT mutants were degraded after incorporation of the precursor polyprotein into the virions. mutations in residues 271 and 274 would reduce the stability of RT inside the viral particles, rendering it susceptible to viral protease. RT exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomers and dimers. the p66/p66 heterodimer is the most stable and the p51/p51 homodimer is the most unstable [40]\u2013[43]. RT degradation may be ascribed to the inhibition of RT p66 dimerization by the mutations. alanine substitutions at residue 271 or 274 of HIV-1 RT could cause conformational changes, rendering RT unstable and susceptible to viral protease. this could be explained by different proteolytic stability of RT in vitro and in virions. these findings may prove useful in anti-HIV drug design and vaccine development."}
