{"summary": "phenotype of HAND has been shifting towards subtler forms. prevalence was 27% for any degree of impairment. neuropathological correlate of HAD, HIV encephalitis, exhibits astrocytosis, perivascular inflammatory macrophages and microglial nodules. the ISR orchestrates a multitude of cellular responses against extra and intracellular stresses by regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels. a variety of insults can trigger the ISR, such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, toxins, nutrient deprivation and viral infection. chronic ISR activation in response to sustained injury/insult can also lead to orchestrated cell death [15, 36, 38, 41, 42] activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), PKRlike ER kinase (PERK) and inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) are both kinases that, when released from BiP, homodimerize and activate via autophosphorylation. PERK activates its branch of the ISR by phosphorylating the subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), causing a global inhibition of translation initiation. stress response proteins include activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). eIF2 can be activated by other kinases in a stressspecific manner. eIF2 can be activated by other kinases in a stressspecific manner. this is especially likely during viral infection, as many viruses exploit specific ISR pathways, while inhibiting others, to enable persistence/latency [28, 30, 31, 33, 56, 57, 58]. Specifically, we used immunofluorescence and immunoblotting to examine the levels of key players in the three prongs of the ISR in the grey matter of midfrontal cortical autopsy tissue. astrocytic nucleus of ATF6 and ATF4 increases in astrocytes in both HAND and HIV(+) tissue. total ATF4 colocalized with DAPI decreases in HAND cases. close arrows indicate changes observed in HAND tissue compared with neurocognitively normal tissue. the symbols followed by * show results determined only by immunoblotting. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated PERK (pPERK) (Thr980, 1:1000; Cell Signalling Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), peIF2 (pS52, 1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were incubated for 30 min with goat secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) slides were mounted in Citifluor AF1 (Citifluor, Ltd, London, UK) and laser confocal microscopy on a biorad Radiance 2100 equipped with Argon, Green He/Ne, Red Diode, and Blue Diode lasers. five to ten highmagnification images with uniform threshold settings for each ISR marker were captured randomly from the areas of positive staining.

GFAP and MAP2 primary antibodies were visualized by a goat antirabbit antibody (1:200) and a Cy3conjugated goat antimouse antibody (1:200), respectively. peIF2 immunofluorescent analysis the cases listed in Table 3 were used Neurocog HIV status Sex Age PMI (h) the cases listed in Table 3 were used Neurocog HIV status Sex Age PMI (h) tyramide amplification IRE1 Rabbit 14C10 Cell Signaling 1:1000 N/A peIF2 Rabbit PS52 Invitrogen 1:1000 1:1000 with tyramide amplification CHOP Mouse 9C8 Thermo Fisher 1:500 N/A HSP70 Rabbit D69 Cell Signaling 1:1000 N/A WB. postacquisition analysis for immunostaining was performed via a blinded fashion using MetaMorph 6.0 image analysis software tissue was homogenized in a tissue grinder (Kimble/Kontes, NJ, USA) in lysis buffer. tissue was sonicated three times in 6s cycles, then centrifuged at 16 100 g for 30 min. membranes were washed three times with TBST and exposed using amersham Hyperfilm. a broadrange molecular weight ladder (BioRad) was run for each gel. for loading control, the PVDF membranes were stained with the Coomassie BrilliantBlue R250 (BioRad) solution. cN HIV 3 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A NcN HIV 5 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A NcN HIV 6 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A NcN HIV 8 F 54 7 HAND HIV 9 M 48 7.5 HAND HIV 11 N/A 47 N/A HAND HIV 12 N/A 44 N/A HAND HIV 13 N/ total levels of ATF6 increase in the midfrontal cortex of HAND autopsy cases compared with levels in neurocognitively normal cases. total levels of ATF6 increase in the midfrontal cortex of HIV(+) autopsy cases compared with levels in neurocognitively normal and HIV() cases. we found that ATF6 was predominantly cytoplasmic in our staining, regardless of disease state. however, particularly in astrocytes, we did observe some nuclear staining, observed as colocalization with the nucleic acid marker, DAPI. we had previously seen an increase in BiP protein levels that reached significance in astrocytes. formalinfixed, paraffinembedded midfrontal cortical autopsy tissue was quadruple labelled with antibodies for ATF6 and for the celltype markers for astrocytes (GFAP) and for neurones (MAP2), as well as the DNAbinding compound, DAPI to label nuclei. grey matter was imaged using laser confocal microscopy. astrocytic ATF6 increases in HAND and in HIV(+) compared with neurocognitively normal and HIV() tissue. nuclear ATF6 increases only in HAND tissue. total ATF6 protein levels increase in HAND tissue compared with neurocognitively normal control tissue (Figure 3A,C ). Interestingly, unlike our observations with ATF6, we did not see a significant change in total ATF6 levels in HIV(+) tissue compared with HIV() controls (Figure 3A,C ). all samples on both blots were normalized to sample HIV 8 from their respective blots. normalized values were averaged and are represented using closed circles. cases run on only one gel are represented using open circles. ire1 levels do not change across experimental groups when examined via immunoblot analysis. ire1 expression does not change in the midfrontal cortices of HAND cases. cases run on both gels, normalized values were averaged. cases were divided into three groups: (i) HIV()/neurocognitively normal; (ii) HIV(+)/neurocognitively normal; and (iii) HAND. groups were compared using oneway anova. we observed similar trends via IFA. however, in addition to the significant increase in peIF2 in HIV(+) tissue compared with HIV() tissue, we also observed a significant increase in peIF2 in HAND cases. this change was so small that it is questionable as to whether it is a meaningful change. AP staining was not of a quality and consistency to allow for quantification of colocalization using this marker. cortical autopsy tissue was quadruple labelled for peIF2, GFAP, MAP2 and DAPI. using oneway anova and HIV(+) cases, both neurocognitively normal (n = 6) and HAND (n = 7), were found to increase significantly over HIV() cases (n = 4). ttest used for twoway comparison and oneway anova for threeway comparisons. s were divided into three groups: HIV()/neurocognitively normal; HIV(+)/neurocognitively normal; and (iii) HAND. no significant differences were found. astrocytic cytoplasmic ATF4 actually increased in HAND cases over neurocognitively normal cases and in HIV(+) cases over HIV() cases. however, astrocytic cytoplasmic ATF4 staining was predominantly neuronal with a tendency towards strong nuclear staining in these cells. total integrated pixel intensity of ATF4 was quantified using Metamorph 6.0 software. ATF4 decreases in HAND cases (n = 12) over neurocognitively normal cases (n = 5), but shows no change in HIV(+) cases (n = 14) compared with HIV() (n = 3) controls (C). values are shown as mean SEM. ttest and Mann\u2013Whitney U posthoc analysis was used for statistical analysis. cases were divided into three groups: HIV()/neurocognitively normal; HIV(+)/neurocognitively normal; and HAND. groups were compared using oneway anova and no significant differences were found. CHOP and HSP70 expression levels do not change in the midfrontal cortices of HAND cases (n = 8) compared with neurocognitively normal (NcN) cases (n = 17). cases run on only one gel are represented using open circles. in the current study, we found that total levels of ATF6 increase in the midfrontal cortex of HAND autopsy cases compared with those seen in HIV() cases. these findings indicated that the ISR is activated in the CNS of these patients, but demanded further study to determine more precisely the nature of ISR activation in this disease. we normalized colocalization values to total area of the phenotypic marker. we found that ATF6 is increased in the cytoplasm of both neurones and astrocytes in HAND cases and in HIV(+) cases as compared with that in neurocognitively normal and HIV() cases. astrocytes comprise only a small percentage of cells captured in each image. however, it is likely that quantification of total nuclear ATF6 is indicative of neuronal nuclear ATF6. values are shown as mean SEM. neuronal and astrocytic ATF6 increases in HAND and in HIV(+) compared with neurocognitively normal and HIV() tissue. ATF6 has two forms, ATF6 and ATF6, both of which are activated under stress conditions [65, 66, 67]. Interestingly, unlike our observations with ATF6, we did not see a significant change in total ATF6 levels in HIV(+) tissue compared with HIV() controls. aTF6 expression is increased in the midfrontal cortices of HAND cases (n = 8) compared with neurocognitively normal (NcN) cases (n = 17) samples were run on two separate blots due to large number of sample sizes. IRE1 protein levels are not assessed to examine activation of this ISR pathway. levels of spliced XBP1 mRNA are assessed to analyse activation of the IRE1 pathway. however, analysis of mRNA from tissue banks is not feasible. cases run on only one gel are represented using open circles. IRE1 levels did not significantly change in HIV(+) tissue compared with HIV() (control) tissue (n = 4). groups were divided into three groups. for quantification of peIF2 via immunoblotting, we determined values for peIF2/total eIF2 per sample (Figure 6B\u2013D ). we found that peIF2 increased in HIV(+) over HIV() tissue, but not in HAND tissue over neurocognitively normal tissue. via IFA we also observed a significant increase in peIF2 in HAND cases compared with neurocognitively normal cases. GFAP staining was not of a quality and consistency to allow for quantification of colocalization using this marker. GFAP staining was not of a quality and consistency to allow for quantification of colocalization using this marker. in HIV(+) cases (n = 13) over HIV() cases (n = 4) (C and F) and in HAND cases (n = 7) over neurocognitively normal cases (n = 10); however, the increase is quite small, despite reaching significance (B and E) peIF2 levels increased significantly in HIV(+) (n = 21) tissue compared with HIV() (control) tissue (n = 4). groups were compared using oneway anova and no significant differences were found. astrocytic cytoplasmic ATF4 actually increased in HAND cases over neurocognitively normal cases and in HIV(+) cases over HIV() cases. however, astrocytic cytoplasmic ATF4 staining was predominantly neuronal with a tendency towards strong nuclear staining in these cells. overlap of ATF4 with a celltype marker appears yellow. an example is shown for an HIV() uninfected control, an HIV(+) neurocognitively normal case, and a HAND case for each celltype marker. ATF4 levels do not change in either HAND or HIV(+) cases. compared to neurocognitively normal and HIV() cases. total nuclear ATF4 protein levels decrease in HAND cases. aTF4 expression does not change in the midfrontal cortices of HAND cases (n = 8) compared with neurocognitively normal (NcN) cases (n = 17). cases run on both gels, normalized values were averaged and are represented using closed circles. CHOP and HSP70 levels do not change in the midfrontal cortices of HAND cases (n = 8) compared with neurocognitively normal (n = 17) cases run on only one gel are represented using open circles. the direct cause and mechanism of neuronal degeneration and death in HAND is not understood. the ISR is largely a protective response, but can culminate in a proapoptotic response under certain conditions. 4 showed no change in HIV(+) tissue compared with neurocognitively normal tissue via IFA. changes observed in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments are indicated in each celltype examined (neurones and astrocytes) only proteins that showed a change in protein levels are indicated. ATF6 is a transcription factor that has two forms, ATF6 and ATF6, that are both activated under stress conditions by translocation to the Golgi. proteolytic cleavage allows its active, cleaved form to translocate to the nucleus and induce expression of target genes [65, 66, 67]. cleavage of ATF6 prevented its nuclear localization to the Golgi [70] another study identified nucleobindin 1 as an endogenous inhibitor of S1P. it is possible that some of the ATF6 in these cells is constitutively localized to the Golgi. active form of ATF6 is stronger, yet much shorterlived transcriptional activator than is ATF6[81, 82]. some studies have suggested that ATF6 is an inhibitor of ATF6 transcriptional function [82], suggesting that ATF6 may function to regulate the strength and duration of ATF6 activity. a significant increase in ATF6 in the nuclei of astrocytes does not appear to be the case with neurones. it is unclear whether its nuclear localization is prevented in neurones as a protective measure to avoid the apoptosis associated with ISR activation. total IRE1 protein levels do not change significantly in HIV(+) cortex or in HAND cortex compared with respective control groups. however, unexpectedly, it seems to trend towards a decrease in HIV(+) tissue. kinases known to target peIF2 do phosphorylate it on its serine 51 (S51) these kinases themselves are differentially regulated and may affect whether peIF2 will play a prosurvival or proapoptotic role. eIF2 is the target of several other kinases in addition to PERK. total and nuclear ATF4 decreases in HAND tissue. eIF2 is a downstream target of the PERK/eIF2 pathway of the ISR. however, it shows no change in the cytoplasm of neurones. phosphorylation of eIF2 failed to increase expression of ATF4 in their model. a recent study suggests a stimulus-dependent transcriptional regulation of ATF4 that alters the amount of ATF4 mRNA available for translational upregulation by peIF2[95] another study has shown an HPV16 transforming protein capable of downregulating components of the ISR [24] this property of active inhibition of apoptosis seems to be more common of DNA viruses than of RNA viruses. this property of active inhibition of apoptosis seems to be more common of DNA viruses than of RNA viruses. however, it is not inconceivable that HIV could employ a similar mechanism. xC plays a critical role in the production of glutathione, an important component of the cellular antioxidant response. to do so, it exports astrocytic glutamate into the extracellular milieu, potentially contributing to an excitotoxic environment and ultimately to neuronal death. data presented in this paper compose an important novel foray into the characterization of the ISR response in HAND. cognitive dysfunction in HIV patients despite longstanding suppression of viremia.
