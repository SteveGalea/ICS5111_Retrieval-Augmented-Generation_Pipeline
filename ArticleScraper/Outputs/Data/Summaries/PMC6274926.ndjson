{"summary": "the highly pathogenic PEDV variants first appeared in October 2010 in china. PEDV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of 28 kb in length. it is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of 28 kb in length. miR-146 acts as a negative regulatory loop of the nuclear factor-b-signaling pathway by targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6 and interleukin (IL)-1-receptor-associated kinase 1 [10]. Moreover, miR-21 is regulated by the signal transducer and an activator of transcription (STAT)3 pathway. mitogen-activated protein kinases promote phosphorylation and activation of IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)3, NF-B, and activating protein (AP)-1. PRRs initiate a signaling cascade resulting in the IKK phosphorylation, which subsequently phosphorylates and ubiquitinates IB- bound to NF-B in resting cells. suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a negative d the NF-B pathway by targeting two negative regulators in MARC-145 cells. this suggests a regulatory mechanism wherein host miRNA activates the NF-B pathway during viral infection. ssc-miR-221-5p CH-HNZZ47-2016(KX981440.1) 151 21.53 4505 26 28,124 27,937 ssc-miR-221-5p CH_hubei_2016(KY928065.1) 151 21.53 4499 26 28,063 27,948 ssc-miR-221-5p CH-JLDH-2016(MF346935.1) 151 21.53 28,033 27,947 ssc-miR-221-5p DR13(JQ023162.1) 151 21.53 4510 26 27,931 27,846 ssc-miR-221-5p GD-1(JX647847.1) 151 21.53 4511 26 28,047 27,949 ssc-miR-221-5p HBTS2017(MH581489) 151 21.53 4489 26 28,037 27,95 miR-221-5p is upregulated During PEDV infection. we predicted miRNAs targeting conserved regions of the viral genome using ViTa [19]. miR-221-5p inhibits PEDV replication in MARC-145 cells. cells were fixed and stained with DAPI (blue), with green representing PEDV N protein staining. scale bar = 40 m. intensity represents PEDV N protein level (top) normalized to that of -actin across three independent experiments. data represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. miR-221-5p inhibits PEDV replication in IECs and Vero cells. real-time qRT-PCR analysis of intracellular viral genomic RNA. miR-221-5p directly targets the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA. seed sequences of miR-221-5p are underlined, and mutated sequences are shown. miR-221-5p mimics significantly inhibited luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. highest inhibition percentage measured at 90% in the presence of both 50 and 100 nM miR-221-5p mimics. results showed significant decrease in luciferase activity of 3\u2032 UTR-WT in cells transfected with the miR-221-5p mimics. miR-221-5p upregulated IFN and ISG expression during PEDV infection. results showed that upregulated IFN and ISG expression was not attributable to TLR3 activation. data represent mean SD of three independent experiments. miR-221-5p Activates NF-B signaling by Increasing p65 translocation Previous studies reported miR-221 involvement in regulating NF-B-pathway activation [28,29]. to investigate whether miR-221-5p regulates IFN and ISG expression through the NF-B pathway, we pretreated PEDV-infected MARC-145 cells with inhibitors of NF-B (BAY11-7082), IRF3/IRF7 (BX-7 miR-221-5p activates the NF-B pathway by increasing p65 nuclear translocation. real-time qRT-PCR analysis of IFN- (A), IFN- (B) and ISG15 (C) mRNA levels (normalized to -actin expression) in PEDV-infected MARC-145 cells. cells treated with 15 ng/mL TNF- for 20 min served as the positive controls. intensities representing p-IB and IB levels were normalized against that for -actin. protein levels of IB and p-IB were downregulated. no significant change in p-IB levels were observed. results showed miR-221-5p activated the expression of IFNs and ISGs via NF-B-pathway activation. luciferase-reporter plasmids harboring mutated NFKBIA and SOCS1 3\u2032 UTRs were co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with miR-221-5p mimics or MC. luciferase activity in 293T cells co-transfected with miR-221-5p and plasmids containing the 3\u2032 UTRs of NFKBIA, PDLIM2, NFKBIA and SOCS1 suppress IFN- expression to promote PEDV replication. NFKBIA inhibits the NF-B pathway, and likely sequesters the p65 and p50 complex in the cytoplasm. MARC-145 cells were transfected with siRNA control (NC), si-NFKBIA, or si-SOCS1 for 48 h, and infected with PEDV CH/HBTS/2017 at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. blot confirmed the knockdown of SOCS1 and IB. real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results confirmed that miR-221-5p expression was significantly upregulated in PEDV-infected MARC-145 cells. results suggest that miR-221-5p expression was activated by PEDV infection. miR-221-5p significantly suppressed PEDV viral load. miR-221-5p inhibits PEDV replication in MARC-145 (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) qRT-PCR analysis of intracellular viral genomic RNA (normalized to -actin expression) data represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. intensity represents PEDV N protein level (top) normalized to that of -actin. miR-221-5p mimics (C) or inhibitor (D) at 50 nM for 12 h, followed by infection with PEDV CH/HBTS/2017 for an additional 36 h. data represent mean SD of three independent experiments and measured in technical duplicate. ARC-145 cells were co-transfected with wild type (pmirGLO-Target-WT) or mutant (pmirGLO-Target-Mut) luciferase-reporter vector. different concentrations of miR-221-5p mimics (10, 20, 50, and 100 nM) for 24 h. miR-221-5p mimics targeted the viral genome rather than the luciferase-reporter sequence. miR-221-5p TS enables miR-221-5p-mediated repression of PEDV infection. real-time qRT-PCR analysis following miR-221-5p transfection during PEDV infection revealed that miR-221-5p enhanced cytokine and ISG expression. miR-221-5p increases type I IFN and ISG expression during PEDV infection. real-time qRT-PCR analysis of IFN-, IFN-, MX1 and ISG15 mRNA levels (normalized to -actin expression) in MARC-145 cells transfected with 50 nM miR-221-5p mimics or MC for 24 h followed by infection with CH/HBTS/2017 strain at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. NF-B inhibition significantly attenuated these levels, whereas inhibition of AP-1 and IRF3/IRF7 did not, suggesting that miR-221-5p activated the expression of IFNs and ISGs through the NF-B pathway. we then constructed a luciferase-reporter system to indicate NF-B-promoter activation. data represent fold changes in the indicated genes relative to MC following miR-221-5p transfection. intensity represents p65 and IRF3 protein levels normalized against that for -actin across three independent experiments. cells treated with 15 ng/mL TNF- for 20 min served as the positive controls. intensities representing p-IB and IB levels were normalized against that for -actin across three independent experiments. comparisons between groups were determined by Student\u2019s t test. luciferase-reporter plasmids harboring mutated NFKBIA and SOCS1 3\u2032 UTRs were co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with miR-221-5p mimics or MC. luciferase activity decreased by 60% and 70% in cells transfected with the NFKBIA and SOCS1 3\u2032 UTRs. miR-221-5p and the 3\u2032 UTRs of NFKBIA, PDLIM2, NKIRAS1, NSFL1C, and SOCS1 normalized against firefly luciferase activity. data were normalized against firefly luciferase activity in 293T cells. NFKBIA and SOCS1 suppress IFN- expression to favor PEDV replication. NFKBIA and SOCS1 overexpression inhibited IFN- expression. NFKBIA and SOCS1 overexpression inhibited IFN- expression. miRNAs are reportedly associated with PDEV infection, studies have not addressed their roles in PDEV infection. in this study, we demonstrated that miR-221-5p was upregulated by PEDV infection. miRNAs modulate RNA-mediated host responses against viral infection in multiple ways. miR-181 and miR-23 directly target viral genomic RNA to inhibit porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus replication. miR-32 targets the primate foamy virus genome to suppress viral replication. miR-221-5p upregulated the expression of the IFNs and ISGs through the NF-B pathway by downregulating IB levels to promote p65 nuclear translocation. a recent study reported that SOCS1 binds the NF-B component p65 in the nucleus as a ubiquitin ligase.
