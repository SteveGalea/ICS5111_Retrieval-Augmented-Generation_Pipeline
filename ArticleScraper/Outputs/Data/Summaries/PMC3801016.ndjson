{"summary": "dKO mice were fed a standard chow diet spontaneously develop occlusive, atherosclerotic CAD and heart failure. at 21 d there were no apparent coronary arterial lesions or MIs. at 31 d there were atherosclerotic coronary arterial occlusions and small MIs. low and high magnification images of movat pentachrome-stained transverse sections of ventricles indicate the locations of the high-magnification images. black and white stars indicate the left and right ventricles. arrows and arrowheads indicate microscopic scarring. SI Appendix, Fig. S3 shows probes with a >twofold decrease at 43 d. 89 genes whose relative expression at 43 d increased >sixfold in dKO hearts to those induced in mouse hearts between 1 h and 8 wk after surgical coronary artery. cardiogenomics data included samples from control, sham operated hearts and from ligated hearts taken from both infarcted and noninfarcted regions. genes encoding matricellular proteins, matrix proteases, TIMPs, and inflammation and fibrosis associated proteins (SI Appendix, Supplemental Results) apoD previously has been reported to protect against hyperoxic and hypoxic stress in flies and mice. apoD previously has been reported to protect against hyperoxic and hypoxic stress in flies and mice and to be induced by neuronal damage (20\u201324) ischemia (60 min)/reperfusion (24 h) procedure 4 d after injection of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with either an adenovirus encoding mouse apoD (Ad-apoD) or an empty vector control (Ad-control, n = 5, Left) samples were taken 4 d after virus injection. ts and ratios of infarct-area to area-at-risk are shown in Fig. 2 B and C. apoD-induced increase in plasma apoD significantly decreased relative infarct size (59% vs. 81%, P 0.005) treatment with 100 g/mL apoD, but not BSA, significantly reduced the percent of H/R-induced cell death. osteopontin, whose gene expression was the most highly induced in dKO hearts, has also been reported to protect cultured NRVMs from H/R stress. cultured ARVMs were incubated for 1 h in medium B without (n = 9) or with 100 g/mL of either human apoD or BSA (n = 9) followed by 16 h of anoxia [95% (vol/vol) N2 and 5% (vol/vol) CO2 atmosphere; hypoxia] and then 8 h under normal atmosphere (reoxygenation) in vitro antioxidant capacities of 30 g/mL of either untreated, extensively dialyzed, or boiled (5 min) human apoD or BSA were measured using the ABTS assay. little is known about the mechanisms by which apoD protects cells and organisms from stress (20\u201324, 26) apoD exhibited a very potent antioxidant activity: 1.2 mol/L apoD was equivalent to 314 mol/L Trolox. extensive dialysis did not, but boiling did (71%), inhibit apoD\u2019s antioxidant activity in this assay. at 31 d there were coronary arterial occlusions and small MIs. at 43 d there were coronary arterial occlusions and extensive MIs. control SR-BI+//apoE/ (\u201cHet\u201d) mice do not exhibit this pathology (6). microarray data quality is described in the SI Appendix, Supplemental Results. unsupervised clustering using self-organizing maps suggests that effects of disease progression on cardiac gene expression in the dKO mice are robustly reproducible. the data sets cluster into five groups that almost perfectly distinguished between hearts from control Het and dKO mice. 89 genes whose relative expression at 43 d increased >sixfold in dKO hearts to those induced in mouse hearts between 1 h and 8 wk after surgical coronary artery ligation. of these 89 genes, 81 were induced after ligation. the top two induced genes were osteopontin and apoD. the largest gene expression changes in the dKO hearts primarily are due to the occlusive CAD in these mice. there was no dyslipidemia expected in the coronary artery ligation study (16, 17) the other 8 genes and one poorly annotated probe that increased >sixfold in the dKO data did not increase after coronary artery ligation. effects of hepatic overexpression or null mutations of apoD on plasma apoD (A and D) and infarct size after in vivo myocardial I/R injury. male mice on a C57BL/6 background were subjected to myocardial ischemia (60 min in B and C or 45 min in E and F)/reperfusion (24 h) we performed the ischemia (60 min)/reperfusion (24 h) procedure 4 d after injection of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with either an adenovirus encoding mouse apoD (Ad-apoD) or an empty vector control (Ad-control) sections were cut, stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), and fixed. apoD KO mice were subjected to longer ischemia. the areas at risk were similar for adenovirus-mediated apoD. images of representative sections with arrowheads indicating infarcts are shown in Fig. 2 B and C. the Ad-apoD\u2013induced increase in plasma apoD significantly decreased the relative infarct size (59% vs. 81%, P 0.005) suggesting increased plasma apoD protected the hearts of WT mice. apoD can protect cultured adult cardiomyocytes against H/R stress. treatment with 100 g/mL apoD, but not BSA, significantly reduced the percent of H/R-induced cell death. osteopontin, whose gene expression was the most highly induced in dKO hearts, has also been reported to protect cultured NRVMs from H/R stress. effects of apoD on H/R stress in cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes. apoD or BSA was present as indicated throughout. control ARVMs were incubated in a normal atmosphere throughout. in vitro antioxidant capacities of 30 g/mL of either untreated, extensively dialyzed, or boiled (5 min) human apoD or BSA were measured using the ABTS assay. little is currently known about the mechanisms by which apoD protects cells and organisms from stress (20\u201324, 26) apoD exhibited a very potent antioxidant activity: 1.2 mol/L apoD was equivalent to 314 mol/L Trolox. dKO mouse appears to be a useful animal model for identifying mechanisms for apoD\u2019s cardioprotective activity. apoD is a secreted 25- to 29-kDa glycoprotein (associated with HDL in the plasma) it is expressed highly in nervous tissue and apparently at lower levels in other tissues under normal conditions. apoD expression is increased with aging, in neurological and psychiatric disorders, and in some cancers. apoD expression is induced in mouse hearts at relatively early times after coronary artery ligation, primarily in noninfarcted regions. we determined whether apoD were cardioprotective in an I/R surgical model of MI in mice (18) apoD exhibited potent cardioprotective activity in vivo. apoD could function in vitro as an antioxidant in a free-radical-generating lipid hydroperoxide assay. previous studies have suggested that apoD may function directly or indirectly as an antioxidant in vivo in mice and Drosophila melanogaster. experiments using animals were performed in accordance with guidelines of the committee on animal care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. all P values (Student\u2019s t test) and SEM values were calculated using Prism 5 software."}
