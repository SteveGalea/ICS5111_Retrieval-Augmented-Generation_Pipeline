{"summary": "Isolates from the 2 patients were indistinguishable when subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 6,000 people, including 1,500 transplant recipient athletes, attended the 2002 U.S. Transplant Games. cases were questioned about food items eaten in the 3 days before illness onset. controls were defined as well survey respondents. all were questioned about the middle 3 days of the Transplant Games. 75 (91%) reported eating food items at specific food courts in theme park A. no deaths were reported to the organizers of the 2002 U.S. Transplant Games. diced Roma tomatoes were processed at plant X from June 20 through July 3. no diced tomatoes from the implicated lots were available for testing. the nature of this outbreak highlights several changing features of foodborne disease epidemiology. use of a Web-based investigative tool limited responses to only those Transplant Games attendees with known email addresses and Internet access. most (>75%) respondents to both surveys were from households in which no one had experienced illness. the development of web-based public health investigative tools can facilitate future investigations of outbreaks affecting geographically dispersed persons."}
