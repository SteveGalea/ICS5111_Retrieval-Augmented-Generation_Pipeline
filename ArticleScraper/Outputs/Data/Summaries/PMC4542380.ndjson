{"summary": "rapid antiviral responses are initiated by a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. these include membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) at the cell surface and endocytic compartments, as well as the cytoplasmic RNA helicases RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (1, 2). both HSV-1 and HSV-2 activate TLR-2 and TLR-9 in vitro. TLR-2/ mice survive at rates similar to the survival of wild-type (wt) mice (10), suggesting that TLR-2 is redundant in vivo. peripheral MHV infection is sensed via myd88-dependent TLR-7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) MDA5 is the primary sensor inducing IFN-/ in microglia/macrophages (20) IFN-/ prevents neuronal infection and restrains viral spread within the CNS prior to the emergence of adaptive immunity. myeloid and CD4 T cell but not CD8 T cell recruitment to the CNS was significantly blunted. the results demonstrate a crucial biphasic role for Myd88 in supporting a rapidly induced innate immune response early during coronavirus encephalomyelitis. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was resuspended in RNase-free water (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and treated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with a DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) a viral nucleocapsid (nucleocapsid) is a viral nucleocapsid (nucleocapsid) known as viral nucleocapsid. a viral nucleocapsid (nucleocapsid) is a viral nucleocapsid. encoding RNA, F, 5\u2032-GCCAAATAATCGCGCTAGAA-3\u2032, and R, 5\u2032-CCGAGCTTAGCCAAAACAAG-3\u2032. all samples were run in duplicate on a 96-well plate using a 7500 fast real-time PCR system. the fluorescent signal becomes higher than the signals of all PCR primer pairs. Fc receptors were blocked with 1% mouse serum and 1% rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 MAb. specific cell types were identified by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-conjugated MAb. cells were stimulated with 1 M S510 or 10 M133, respectively. cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit. intracellular cytokines were detected using FITC-conjugated anti-IFN- MAb. IL-1 and IL-6 levels were assessed using mouse ELISA ready-SET-Go and IL-6 ELISA Ready-SET-Go (catalog number 88-7013; eBioscience) kits. CCL5 and CXCL10 levels were measured using mouse ELISA. mice were infected intracranially in the left hemisphere with a sublethal, gliatropic, monoclonal antibody (MAb)-derived variant of JHMV designated 2.2v-1 (25) at a dose of 1,000 PFU in 30 l of endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions and subjected to real-time PCR analysis. cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold in RNase-free water (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTA-3\u2032, and R, 5\u2032-ATGCCTGCTTCACCACCACCTTCT-3\u2032; Il6, F, 5\u2032-ACACATGTTCTCTCTGGGAAATCGT-3\u2032; Il10, F, 5\u2032-TTTGAATTCCCTGGGTGAGAA-3\u2032; Il21, F, 5\u2032-GGACAGTATAGACGCTCACGAATG-3\u2032; Tnf, F, 5\u2032-CCTGGTA the expression levels of Gapdh, Cxcl1, Ccl2, Ifn4, Ifn5, Ifn1, Ifit1, Ifit2, Isg15, and Il1 were determined using a 7500 fast real-time PCR system. cells were recovered from the 30%\u201370% interface, washed with RPMI, and suspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) Fc receptors were blocked with 1% mouse serum and 1% rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 MAb for 20 min. specific cell types were identified by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-, or allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated MAb. intracellular cytokines were detected using FITC-conjugated anti-IFN- MAb. spinal cords were divided into 6 equivalent-length segments from the cervical to the lumbar end and embedded in paraffin together. sections were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Luxol fast blue (LFB) IL-1 and IL-6 levels were measured using the mouse ELISA Ready-SET-Go (catalog number 88-7013; eBioscience) and IL-6 ELISA Ready-SET-Go (catalog number 88-7064; eBioscience) kits. CCL5 and CXCL10 levels were measured using mouse CCL5 ELISA (catalog number MMR00; R&D systems; Minneapolis, MN) wt and Myd88/ mice were infected with the sublethal gliatropic coronavirus JHMV. both groups began to exhibit clinical signs of encephalitis at day 7 postinfection (p.i.), which progressed to partial or complete hind-limb paralysis by day 10 p.i. wt mice showed progressively reduced viral loads between days 5 and 10 p.i. wt mice harbored higher viral loads at day 5 p.i. and showed no evidence of viral control until day 10 p.i. wt mice showed no evidence of viral control until day 10 p.i. the levels of viral mRNA were determined relative to the level of Gapdh. the gliatropic variant used herein is highly neurotropic. but it can disseminate to the liver in immunocompromised mice. the dominant cell type infected in wt mice exhibited a morphology consistent with glia/macrophages. despite the increase in the numbers of infected cells in the brains of myd88/ mice, the relative proportions of infected glia to infected neurons remained similar. Ifn/ mRNA expression in the brains was analyzed as early as day 3 p.i., when virus replication was similar in both groups. in wt mice, Ifn, Ifn4, and Ifn5 transcripts all peaked at day 3 p.i., declined by day 5 p.i., and subsided to background levels. expression levels of Ifn, Ifna4, and Ifna5 mRNA (A) and of IFN-/-inducible genes Ifit1, Ifit2 and Isg15 (B) were determined by real-time PCR. values for naive wt mice are shown (n = 3) mRNA levels of Il1 and Il6 increased by day 5 p.i., suggesting early deficit was overcome by myd88-independent signaling. Tnf mRNA levels were also significantly reduced at day 3 p.i. in the absence of Myd88 but were upregulated by day 5 p.i. levels of IL-1 and IL-6 proteins in brain supernatants of infected wt and Myd88/ mice were determined by ELISA. chemokine transcripts associated with neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte recruitment into the CNS were also examined. transcripts encoding CXCL1, a neutrophil chemoattractant, as well as CCL2 and CCL3, both associated with monocyte recruitment, were all significantly impaired at day 3 p.i the levels of CCL5 and CXCL10 in CNS homogenates reflected the patterns of the mRNAs. both were significantly reduced at days 5 and 7 p.i. in the absence of Myd88. by day 10 p.i., the level of CCL5 was equal to and the level of CXCL10 even higher than the levels in wt mice. CD8 T cells contribute to antiviral IFN-- and perforin-mediated mechanisms. CD4 T cells promote local CD8 T cell effector function (39, 40), and are the major producers of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (41). wt mice showed numerous perivascular cuffs in the brain at day 7 p.i. areas of perivascular inflammation were sparse and less pronounced in Myd88/ mice. wt mice showed numerous perivascular cuffs in the brain at day 7 p.i. Ifn mRNA starts to accumulate at day 5 and peaks at day 7 p.i. despite similar kinetics of Ifn mRNA expression in infected Myd88/ and wt mice, levels were significantly reduced throughout acute infection in myd88/ mice. IFN- production remained low by day 10 p.i., despite the vastly increased viral load and similar levels of virus-specific CD8 T cells in wt mice. kinetics, MHC class II expression was low on microglia at day 5 p.i. but was increased on 75% of microglia by day 7 p.i. in wt mice. expression was sustained at day 10 p.i., despite the decline in IFN-. in myd88/ mice, only 22% and 38% expressed MHC class II by day 7 p.i. and 10 p.i., respectively. pooled from infected wt and Myd88/ mice (n = 4 or 5) were stained with anti-CD45 and anti-MHC class II I-A/E antibodies. quadrants were set to separate MHC class II-positive microglia from infiltrating (CD45hi) cells as indicated. number in parentheses represent percentage of MHC class II-expressing cells within microglia. cells from the brains (A) or CLN (B) of infected wt and Myd88/ mice harvested at the indicated times were analyzed for frequencies of IFN--producing CD8 or CD4 T cells in response to S510 or M133 peptide stimulation. the overall frequencies of M133-specific CD4 T cells were below 2% in CLN of both groups. expansion in CLN was confirmed by similar percentages of S510 tetramer+ CD8 T cells (1% in both wt and Myd88/ CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i.) these results imply that reduced IFN- in the CNS of JHMV-infected Myd88/ mice is associated with reduced recruitment/survival of CD4 T cells. a hallmark of JHMV infection in wt mice is T cell-driven, immune-mediated dem brain stems were removed at day 10 p.i. (top) and spinal cords at day 14 p.i. (bottom) from infected wt and Myd88/ mice. images are representative of 2 separate experiments with 3 to 4 individuals per experiment and 6 cross sections per cord. both groups began to exhibit clinical signs of encephalitis at day 7 postinfection. survival rates are representative of two independent experiments (n 20) standard errors of the means (SEM) analysis of the viral loads within the CNS demonstrated that the sustained disease severity in Myd88/ mice correlated with ineffective virus control (Fig. 2). livers of infected wt and Myd88/ mice were determined by plaque assay. levels of viral mRNA were determined relative to the level of Gapdh. data represent the average results of two or three independent experiments. infected sections from wt mice harbored only a few if any infected cells in white matter by day 10 p.i. the dominant cell type infected in wt mice exhibited a morphology consistent with glia/macrophages, although rare infected neurons were also identified. early as day 5 p.i. implied impaired induction of IFN-/ and/or IFN-/-mediated antiviral factors. wt mice, Ifn, Ifn4, and Ifn5 transcripts all peaked at day 3 p.i., declined by day 5 p.i., and subsided to background levels. expression levels of Ifn, Ifna4 and Ifna5 mRNA (A) and of IFN-/-inducible genes Ifit1, Ifit2 and Isg15 (B) were determined by real-time PCR. values for naive wt mice are shown (n = 3) the induction of Ifn/ mRNA, the induction of Il1 and Il6 mRNA was impaired early in infection in the absence of Myd88. but the mRNA levels of both increased by day 5 p.i., suggesting that the early deficit was overcome by myd88-independent signaling. Tnf mRNA levels were also significantly reduced at day 3 p.i. and remained stable through day 10 p.i. levels of IL-1 and IL-6 proteins in brain supernatants of infected wt and Myd88/ mice were determined by ELISA. chemokine transcripts associated with neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte recruitment into the CNS were also examined. cl10 mRNA dropped in both groups after day 7 p.i., they remained higher at days 10 and 14 p.i. in the absence of Myd88. both were significantly reduced at days 5 and 7 p.i. in the absence of Myd88. the levels of CCL5 and CXCL10 in CNS homogenates reflected the patterns of the mRNAs. monocytes are early innate responders that aid in subsequent parenchymal entry of T cells. CD4 T cells contribute to antiviral IFN-- and perforin-mediated mechanisms. CD4 T cells promote local CD8 T cell effector function (39, 40), and are the major producers of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (41). wt mice showed numerous perivascular cuffs in the brain at day 7 p.i. areas of perivascular inflammation were sparse and less pronounced in Myd88/ mice. wt mice showed numerous perivascular cuffs in the brain at day 7 p.i. ifn mRNA starts to accumulate at day 5 and peaks at day 7 p.i. despite similar kinetics of Ifn mRNA expression in infected Myd88/ and wt mice, the levels were significantly reduced throughout acute infection in myd88/ mice. MHC class II expression was low on microglia at day 5 p.i. but was increased on 75% of microglia by day 7 p.i. in wt mice. expression was sustained at day 10 p.i. in wt mice despite the decline in IFN-. cells pooled from infected wt and Myd88/ mice at days 5, 7 and 10 p.i. were stained with anti-CD45 and anti-MHC class II I-A/E antibodies. quadrants were set to separate MHC class II-positive microglia from infiltrating (CD45hi) cells. cells from the brains (A) or CLN (B) of infected wt and Myd88/ mice harvested at the indicated times were analyzed for frequencies of IFN--producing CD8 or CD4 T cells in response to S510 or M133 peptide stimulation. the overall frequencies of M133-specific CD4 T cells were below 2% in CLN of both groups. uncontrolled virus replication in the absence of Myd88 coincides with increased demyelination despite limited inflammation. uncontrolled virus replication in the absence of Myd88 coincides with increased demyelination despite limited inflammation. brain stems were removed at day 10 p.i. and spinal cords at day 14 p.i.. images are representative of 2 separate experiments with 3 to 4 individuals per experiment. DISCUSSION Myd88 signaling is involved in the induction of type I IFN, proinflammatory factors, and leukocyte recruitment to the CNS in various neuroinflammation models. myd88-independent IFN-/ production is consistent with the notion that MHV infection of glia is mainly sensed by cytosolic PRRs. oligodendrocytes are major targets of JHMV, but they do not induce IFN-/ in response to JHMV in vivo (7). nonviral factors, such as cellular stress responses, may contribute to triggering Myd88-dependent innate immune responses (52). ependymal cells (53) may contribute to the early innate immune response. ines CXCL1, CCL2, and CCL5, the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes into the CNS during the innate immune response was significantly dampened in myd88/ mice. impaired CXCL10 is consistent with a prominent role of CXCL10 in promoting CD4 but not CD8 T cell recruitment into the CNS. myeloid and total T cell but not virus-specific CD8 T cell accumulation were also blunted in the CNS of WNV-infected Myd88/ mice. peripheral T cell responses were not impaired (5). oligodendrocytes, the most prominent cell type infected in wt mice, do not express class II MHC, CD4 T cells are most likely activated by cross-presentation. increased demyelination in both the brain and spinal cord of JHMV-infected Myd88/ mice does not lead to increased demyelination despite effective T cell function. d88 protects from lethal JHMV encephalomyelitis by at least two pathways. during the innate immune phase, Myd88 promotes the initial induction of IFN-/ thereby stemming virus dissemination within the CNS and its spread to the liver."}
