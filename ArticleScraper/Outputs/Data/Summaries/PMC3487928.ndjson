{"summary": "background human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections ranging from wheezing to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children worldwide. the objective of this study is to develop a visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of hMPV and applied to the clinical samples. hMPV is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Metapneumovirus in the subfamily Pneumovirinae. it often co-infects patients and causes acute respiratory diseases in different age groups together with other respiratory virus. severe cases are suffered mostly by infants, the elderly, and patients with heart and lung diseases. the whole reaction can be completed in 1.5 h and the amplified product shows a ladder-like pattern by agarose gel electrophoresis. this method produces a large amount of amplified product, resulting in easier detection by visual judgment according to the turbidity of the reaction mixture. this method has been used as a powerful gene amplification tool due to its high specificity and sensitivity under isothermal condition. products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (upper panel) and visually amplification for color change (lower panel) RT-LAMP products were digested with Msp I, and two fragments (103 bp, 116 bp) were photographed under a UV transilluminator. hMPV RT-LAMP products were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis (upper panel) and direct color change (lower panel) RNA serially diluted was amplified and the RT-LAMP products were tested by two methods as above. RNA was diluted serially and amplified by RT-PCR. products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. 176 nasopharyngeal specimens from children with respiratory tract infections were chosen for investigation using both assays. hMPV RT-LAMP products were digested with Msp I. two fragments (103 bp, 116 bp) were observed. the results of sequence and digestion confirmed that the products were amplified specificly from the hMPV target region. no cross-reactivity was detected with the other three respiratory viruses. a high level of specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for hMPV was observed in the preparation of the hMPV. positive color (sky blue) was only observed in the preparation of the hMPV. none of the other viruses showed a color change. RT-PCR assay could detect as little as 100 copies of RNA molecules. RNA was diluted serially and amplified by RT-PCR. products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. the most conserved segment within the N gene (GenBank EF081360) was selected as the target. the entire testing process under isothermal conditions takes only 1.5 h. results from the LAMP can be readily observed by the white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate generated during the reaction. children with hMPV varied from 20 days to 146 months of age. the majority of patients were aged at under 5 years. RT-LAMP is considered a useful and promising technique for the less equipped primary sector. the most conserved segment within the N gene of hMPV/CS038 N gene was selected as the target. six primers were used for the RT-LAMP assay. the predicted length of RT-LAMP is 217 bp. hMPV N gene RT-LAMP primer design and target sequence location. primers sequences are highlighted with italic and bold. arrows show primers direction from 5\u2019 to 3\u2019. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 30 L containing 10 M F3 and B3 (1 L each primer), 10 mM dNTPs (1 L); 10 PCR buffer (3 L), 5 U of rTaq (1 L), extracted products (5 L), and ddH2O (18 L) the recombinant plasmid pGEM-T-N217 was extracted from positive clones was sequenced by Invitrogen (China) RT-LAMP specificity test To evaluate cross-reactivity of the hMPV N gene primer set with other common respiratory viruses, viral nucleic acid extracted from HRV, hRSV, and influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strains were tested and a DEPC-treated water as negative control under the same conditions. the recombinant plasmid pGEM-T-N217 linearized by the vector-specific restriction enzyme Nde I was 457-nucleotide PCR product was extracted, cloned to pMD18-T vector (Takara) and transcribed to RNA. all the process and condition was similar to the sensitivity assessment for RT-LAMP described above. 176 nasopharyngeal samples of 176 children with acute respiratory tract infections were extracted for RNA using the Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (Geneaid) the most conserved segment within the N gene of hMPV/CS038 N gene was selected as the target. six primers were used for the RT-LAMP assay. the predicted length of RT-LAMP is 217 bp. RT-LAMP reaction performed in 25 L mixture containing 5 M F3 and B3 (1 L each primer), 40 M FIP and BIP (1 L each primer), 20 M LF and LB (1 L each primer), 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 L), 25 mM betain (1 L), 150 mM MgSO4 (1 L), 10 Bst buffer (2.5 L), 8 U/L Bst DNA polymerase (1 L) RT-LAMP positive gel was extracted using a gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (Geneaid) the PCR was carried out in a total volume of 30 L containing 10 M F3 and B3 (1 L each primer), 10 mM dNTPs (1 L); 10 PCR buffer (3 L), 5 U of rTaq (1 L), extracted products (5 L), and ddH2O (18 L) RT-LAMP detection and sensitivity test hMPV cDNA was obtained from viral nucleic acid samples using QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) the recombinant plasmid pGEM-T-N217 linearized by the vector-specific restriction enzyme Nde I was transcribed in vitro. the RNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol 457-nucleotide PCR product was extracted, cloned to pMD18-T vector (Takara), transcribed to RNA, and finally analyzed the sensitivity of RT-PCR. all the process and condition was similar to the sensitivity assessment for RT-LAMP described as above."}
