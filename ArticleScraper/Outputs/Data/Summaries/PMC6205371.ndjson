{"summary": "enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped virus. EV-A71 is a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease. it can be complicated by severe neurological diseases including aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and fatal neurogenic pulmonary edema (2). most EV-A71 studies have focused on 2 well-characterized receptors. human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2) and human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (hPSGL1). hPSGL1 is more restrictive than that of hSCARB2 in which only a subset of EV-A71 strains can utilize hPSGL1 for cell entry. hWARS is an important host factor for productive EV-A71 infection. a lentiviral shRNA library targeting 54,509 human transcripts was transduced into 3 108 rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. knockdown of a cellular gene that is critical for EV-A71 replication would halt the viral replication and hence protect the cells from the EV-A71\u2013induced cytopathic effects. hWARS shRNA was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. despite a significant reduction in hWARS expression, no obvious deleterious effect on cell growth in these cells. mRNA and protein levels of the hWARS in hWARS-KD cells were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. control shRNA\u2013transfected RD cells were included for comparison. hWARS-KD RD cells produced fewer viruses in many of the tested serotypes of enterovirus species. hWARS plays an important role in viral infection by a broad spectrum of serotypes of enterovirus species. hWARS plays a role in EV-A71 replication. both viral RNAs and proteins were significantly reduced in hWARS-KD cells. hWARS affects early EV-A71 replication. EV-A71\u2013inoculated mock-transfected L929 cells were included as a negative control. immunoostaining for EV-A71 (green), hWARS (red), hSCARB2 (red) and hPSGL1 (red) was also included as a negative control. EV-A71 pathogenesis is generally attributed to the tissue expression patterns of 2 known cellular receptors: hSCARB2 and hPSGL1 (6, 7) our virus attachment assays by flow cytometry in nonpermeabilized transfected L929 cells also showed an increased capacity of EV-A71 to bind to the surface of hSCARB2- and hPSGL1-transfected L929 cells. endogenous hWARS from RD cells and overexpressed hWARS from hWARS-transfected L929 cells were first immunoprecipitated using resin-coupled anti-hWARS\u2013specific antibodies. pulldown assays were then performed by inoculating the immunocomplex with EV-A71. results showed both endogenous hWARS (lane 2) and overexpressed hWARS (lane 4) were sufficient to pull down EV-A hWARS interacts directly with EV-A71. cDNA-transfected L929 cells were inoculated with high-titer EV-A71. on RD cells was blocked with anti-hWARS antibodies for 1 hour. EV-A71 was preincubated with recombinant hWARS protein. virus production and viral protein expression were measured as described in D. hSCARB2 clones expressed undetectable hSCARB2 expression. hWARS expression levels were positively correlated with those of the EV-A71 protein detected in these hSCARB2 clones. clone 1 showed the greatest susceptibility to EV-A71 in the absence of hSCARB2. NT2 is poorly susceptible to EV-A71 infection under unstimulated conditions. we stimulated NT2 cells, as well as RD cells with different doses of IFN-. a small percentage of NT2 and RD cells were infected. IFN- (0, 10, 50, and 100 U/ml) were infected with low-titer EV-A71. mRNAs and proteins of the treated cells were harvested for qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. hWARS protein expression in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane fractions was detected using anti-hWARS antibodies. expression of hWARS in NT2 cells was first targeted using the CRISPR/Cas9 system followed by EV-A71 infection under IFN-stimulated infection conditions. reduced expression of hWARS in NT2 cells did not result in obvious growth defects. hWARS sensitizes mouse cells to EV-A71 in vivo. lenti-hWARS was allowed to be overexpressed for 5 days before the mice were challenged with EV-A71. as early as 5 days after EV-A71 inoculation, we detected the presence of EV-A71 proteins and RNAs in the skeletal muscles and brains of mice transduced with lenti-hWARS. the findings recapitulate the neurological symptoms associated with EV-A71 infection in humans. lentiviral vector (lane 1) was included as a control. Tissues from hWARS-transduced mice were immunostained with anti\u2013EV-A71 (green) and anti-hWARS antibodies (red) the tissues from empty lentiviral vector\u2013transduced mice served as negative controls. DAPI-stained nuclei (blue) are also shown. expression patterns were highly correlated with tissue tropism and pathogenesis of EV-A71. under a quiescent state, high expression levels of mWARS in the brain were detected. hWARS can be induced by IFN- in murine L929 cells. successful KD of hWARS was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. hWARS-KD cells showed no CPEs compared with control RD cells after the challenge by high-titer EV-A71. ishment of hWARS by transfecting a hWARS hyperexpression plasmid into the hWARS-KD cells partially restored the susceptibility of the clones to EV-A71. our loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments consistently supported the notion that hWARS is important for productive EV-A71 replication. anti\u2013EV-A71 and anti-hWARS antibodies were used to detect EV-A71 and hWARS proteins. data in A, C, D, and E are representative of 3 independent experiments. EV-A71 has a positive-stranded RNA genome that can serve as a template for the synthesis of both viral proteins and RNAs. both viral RNAs and proteins were significantly reduced in hWARS-KD cells. hWARS affects early EV-A71 replication. RD cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-hWARS antibodies (green) also shown are the bright-field image and the overlapping image of hWARS protein. anti-hWARS antibodies observed a sharp and polarized spindle-like pattern of hWARS concentrated at the cell periphery. the membrane association of hWARS was further demonstrated in the orthogonal view of the anti-hWARS\u2013stained RD cells treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Supplemental Video 1). despite high binding capacity of hPSGL1 and EV-A71, we detected minimal to no EV-A71 viral proteins in cell lysates harvested from hPSGL1-expressing L929 cells. direct interaction between hWARS and EV-A71 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of hWARS followed by pulldown of EV-A71. hWARS interacts directly with EV-A71. cDNA-transfected L929 cells were inoculated with high-titer EV-A71. complexes were then inoculated with EV-A71 overnight at 4oC. three different clinical EV-A71 isolates were inoculated with recombinant hWARS protein immunocomplexes. surface hWARS on RD cells was blocked with anti-hWARS antibodies for 1 hour before EV-A71 infection. EV-A71 was preincubated with recombinant hWARS protein before challenging RD cells. hSCARB2 CRISPR RD cells showed slow-growing and lethal phenotypes. no obvious deleterious growth effect was observed in hSCARB2 CRISPR cells. hWARS expression levels were positively correlated with those of the EV-A71 protein detected in these hSCARB2 CRISPR clones. a human neuron-committed teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2), primary human neuron stem cells (HNSCs) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells represent the most physiologically relevant cell models for studying EV-A71. a small percentage of NT2 and RD cells were infected by EV-A71, as shown by the weak detection of viral protein. hWARS induced surface expression correlated with increased capacity of EV-A71 to bind to the IFN-\u2013treated cells. NT2 and RD cells treated with different doses of IFN- (0, 10, 50, and 100 U/ml) were infected with low-titer EV-A71. a time-course infection experiment monitoring the viral RNA genome within the NT2 CRISPR cell clones after the EV-A71 challenge was conducted using qRT-PCR. data in A and D represent the mean SEM of 3 independent experiments. hWARS was allowed to be overexpressed for 5 days before mice were challenged with EV-A71. we detected the presence of EV-A71 proteins and RNAs in the skeletal muscles and brains of mice transduced with lenti-hWARS. the findings recapitulate the neurological symptoms associated with EV-A71 infection in humans. Western blot analyses of EV-A71 protein in the skeletal muscles of EV-A71\u2013challenged neonatal mice pretransduced with empty lentiviral vectors. a noninfected empty lentiviral vector (lane 1) was included as a control. a noninfected empty lentiviral vector (lane 1) was included as a control. mice are known to be semi-/nonpermissive to EV-A71 infection. qRT-PCR measured the mouse homolog of WARS (mWARS) showed that its expression pattern was highly correlated with the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of EV-A71. mWARS expression was also correlated with neurological complications of EV-A71. hSCARB2 has been proposed as the major receptor for systemic EV-A71 infection. hSCARB2 has been proposed as the major receptor for all of the tested EV-A71 strains (8). previously, other enteroviruses, including CV-A7, CV-A14, and CV-A16, can use hSCARB2 for infections (8). the results are consistent with the positive correlation between the level of virus production and the degree of the CPE on infected cells. we were consistently unable to detect viral protein in either hWARS-KD or hWARS CRISPR cells after EV-A71 challenge. hWARS is important for EV-A71 infection. hSCARB2 RD clones expressing various amounts of hWARS had variable susceptibilities to EV-A71. the amount of EV-A71 proteins in these clones was positively correlated with the expression level of hWARS. this indicates the important role of hWARS in EV-A71 infection, even in the absence of hSCARB2. hWARS is an IFN-inducible entry factor for EV-A71. it is able to sensitize poorly susceptible neuronal cells to EV-A71 infection. previous studies showed that hWARS could be upregulated by IFN- in several epithelial and fibroblast cell lines. blot analyses support the idea that enhanced expression of hWARS induced by IFN- could sensitize poorly susceptible NT2 cells to EV-A71 infection. a previous study showed that a subset of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-, was elevated in proportion to the severity of EV-A71 infection. lenti-hWARS\u2013transduced mice developed ruffling of the fur and bilateral rear limb paralysis with marked difficulty in walking. symptoms were compatible with symptoms of neurological disorders. cause of damage in the CNS could be due to virus-induced cytokine effect during hippocampal infection. the mechanism suggests that skeletal muscle injury can induce retrograde axonal transport of the enterovirus and thereby facilitate viral invasion of the CNS. another nonmutually exclusive mechanism for the enterovirus neuroinvasion is the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d hypothesis (36). an elegant study performed by Mena et al. in 1999 showed that CV-B3 was able to infect and replicate in B cells. cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) cells were selected and maintained in the same medium as that described above, with the addition of 1 g/ml puromycin. a feline immunodeficiency virus-based shRNA library was produced. the shRNA library was cotransfected with 10 g pPACK packaging plasmid mix into HEK293T cells. conditioned culture media were collected to harvest the viruses. cDNA synthesis and labeling were performed as described in manufacturer's protocol. 5 g total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNAs in the presence of 10 M cDNA synthesis GNF primer (5\u2032-ATTTATTGTATCTGTGGGAGCCTC-3\u2032), 100 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM each dNTP and 1 RT buffer. PCR for biotin labeling was performed under conditions: 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes, and then 68\u00b0C for 1 minute. step 2 was repeated for 18 cycles; step 2 was repeated for 3 minutes. qRT-PCR analyses were performed using a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit. qRT-PCR was performed as described previously (38), using FS Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) Reaction Mix (Roche Life Science) with the temperature-cycling condition of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C followed by 1 minute at 60\u00b0C for 55 cycles. cDNAs of EV-A71\u2013infected samples were quantified using 300 nM each of forward and reverse specific primers (5\u2032-CCCCTGAATGCGTAAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATTG the RD cell line and its derivative shRNA cell clones were inoculated with enterovirus at a viral titer MOI of 1. after 1 hour of blocking with 3% BSA at room temperature, the cells were stained with anti\u2013EV-A71 antibody. samples were immunostained with an antibody mix that contained 2 primary antibodies from different species under the same conditions as those described above. the specificities of the primary antibodies were confirmed by immunostaining of mouse L929 cells transfected with cDNA that expressed human proteins. for animal tissue stainings, tissue sections were first deparaffinized and rehydrated. unless otherwise specified, EV-A71 infection was performed by inoculating 5 105 cells with EV-A71 at a titer of TCID50/ml = 190,000 for 1 hour. conditioned media and cell lysates were harvested 1 day after infection for TCID50 and Western blot analyses. unbound viruses were removed by washing 3 times with ice-cold PBS. cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. cells were costained with anti\u2013EV-A71 (MAB979; MilliporeSigma) and anti-hWARS (Abcam; ab58054), or anti-hPSGL1 (Ab66882) antibodies. both recombinant hWARS and EV-A71 were mixed in the presence of 0.1% Tween-20 at 4\u00b0C overnight with shaking. the next day, the anti-hWARS antibodies (Abcam; ab58054) and agarose-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies (Abcam; ab97025) were added to the mixture and allowed to incubate for an additional 2.5 hours. the upper-phase solution was collected and combined with the previously harvested upper-phase solution. plasma membrane proteins were collected by centrifugation of the diluted upper-phase solution at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. then 0.5 % Triton X-100 in PBS was added to dissolve the plasma membrane protein pellets for Western blot analyses. WARS sgRNA and hSCARB2 were phosphorylated separately using polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then annealed by heating to 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. the annealed oligonucleotides were then ligated into a gel-purified lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid at 25\u00b0C for 5 minutes. purified lentiviruses were then transduced into RD or NT2 cells. the transduced cells were serially diluted into 96-well plates for clonal expansion. the inactivation of targeted gene expression in these clones was confirmed by Western blot analyses. HBEpCs (Cell Applications Inc.; 502-05a) were cultured in Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (Cell Applications Inc.; 511-500) to differentiate the HNSCs into neurons, 50,000 HNSCs were seeded into a 24-well plate well precoated with Poly-D-Lysine with Laminin Coating Solution. shRNA library packaged viruses were used to transduce 3 108 RD cells. cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RPMI-1640 Medium. the reaction mixtures were incubated at 42\u00b0C for 1 hour. the reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. half of the reaction mixture was transferred to a tube containing 1 PCR reaction buffer. qRT-PCR was performed using a FS Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) Reaction Mix (Roche Life Science) with the temperature-cycling condition of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C followed by 1 minute at 60\u00b0C for 55 cycles in a 7900 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) the cDNAs of EV-A71\u2013infected strand were purified as described above and then quantified. the expression levels of host gene candidates were quantified using sequence-specific fluorescent DNA probes. qRT-PCRs were performed under the same conditions as those described above. clones were inoculated with enterovirus at a viral titer MOI of 1. RD cells, their derivative KD cells, and L929 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with or without 0.1 % Triton X-100. after 1 hour of blocking with 3% BSA, the cells were stained with anti\u2013EV-A71 antibody. cells were stained with anti\u2013EV-A71 antibodies (MilliporeSigma; MAB979) and/or anti-hWARS (Abcam; ab58054), anti-hSCARB2 (Abcam; ab16522), or anti-hPSGL1 (Ab66882) for 1 hour at room temperature. if otherwise specified, EV-A71 infection was performed by first inoculating 5 105 cells with EV-A71 at a titer of antibody mix (250 l) was added into 250 l DMEM containing 5 104 RD cells in a 24-well plate 1 hour before cells were challenged with EV-A71 at a titer of TCID50/ml = 19,000. conditioned media and cell lysates were harvested 1 day after infection for TCID50 and Western blot analyses. anti\u2013EV-A71 (MAB979; MilliporeSigma) and anti-hWARS (Abcam; ab58054), anti-hSCARB2 (Abcam; ab16522), or anti-hPSGL1 (Ab66882) antibodies were incubated with EV-A71. the next day, the anti-hWARS antibodies (Abcam; ab58054) and agarose-conjugated secondary IgG (H+L) antibodies were added agarose-bound proteins were fractionated 6 times with buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. plasma membrane proteins were collected by centrifugation of the diluted upper-phase solution at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the resultant solution was then diluted in 5 volumes of water and kept on ice for 5 minutes. hWARS-expressing lentiviruses were generated using ViraPower Lentiviral Expression Systems (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) the lentiviruses were first successfully demonstrated in L929 cells. titers were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and then resuspended in 100 l PBS for intranasal, intravenous, and intraperitoneal injections. the annealed oligonucleotides were then ligated into a gel-purified lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid at 25\u00b0C for 5 minutes using T7 ligase (Enzymatics) the transfection complex containing 10 g hWARS-lentiCRISPR/hSCARB2-lentiCRISPR plasmid was allowed to inoculate with the 293T cells for 6 hours. the mouse experiments were approved by the Committee on the use of live animals in teaching and research, Hong Kong University (CULATR 3630\u201315) all data were evaluated using a 2-tailed, unequal variance Student\u2019s t test, and 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test."}
