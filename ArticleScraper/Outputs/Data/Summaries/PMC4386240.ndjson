{"summary": "proposed classification based on ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) at ARDS onset. a stratification based on baseline PaO2/FiO2 would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity. ARDS is characterised by severe hypoxaemia, reduced lung compliance and bilateral radiographic pulmonary infiltrates. ARDS is characterised by severe hypoxaemia, reduced lung compliance and bilateral radiographic pulmonary infiltrates. 478 consecutive patients with ARDS enrolled in two published multicentre observational studies9 11 using the Berlin criteria at ARDS onset and at 24 h without standardisation of ventilatory management. patients meeting criteria for ARDS using the AECC definition7 were considered for enrolment in the parent studies. onset of ARDS was defined as the day and time in which the patient first met ARDS criteria. a set of rules for setting PEEP and FiO2 were applied only during the SVS assessment (table 1). rules for setting PEEP and FiO2 during assessment on standardised settings at 24 h of ARDS diagnosis PEEP level before changing to standardised settings PEEP setting for assessment 10 cm H2O 10 cm H2O >10 and 13 cm H2O Set at 10 cm H2O, unless SpO288%. returned to previous level 13 cm H2O Maintain current level and assess ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure. patients meeting criteria for ARDS using the AECC definition7 were considered for enrolment in the parent studies. patients meeting criteria for ARDS using the AECC definition7 were considered for enrolment. a set of rules for setting PEEP and FiO2 were applied only during the SVS assessment. patients were categorised as moderate or severe ARDS according to the Berlin criteria. compared the overall performance of our model of stratification at 24 h of ARDS onset with the classification at baseline and at 24 h under non-standardised measurement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio. a total of 478 patients with moderate/severe ARDS had complete data. no significant differences were found in ventilation and oxygenation parameters at study entry between survivors and non-survivors. overall hospital mortality was 42.2% (95% CI 37.8% to 46.6%) of ARDS, n (%) Pneumonia 176 (36.8) Sepsis 144 (36.7) Trauma 80 (16.7) Aspiration pneumonia 60 (12.5) Others 18 (3.8) Number of organ failures 1.31.1 Hospital mortality, n (%) 202 (42.2) ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; PBW, predicted body weight; PaO2/FiO2; ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen; PEEP, positive end-expiratory 478 patients with moderate and severe ARDS categorised by the Berlin criteria. n=173 Moderate n=305 p Value Age, year, median (IQR) 56 (41\u201371) 55 (39\u201368) NS Lung injury score 3.00.6 2.90.6 NS PEEP, cm H2O 103 93 NS VT, mL/kg PBW 7.11.2 7.31.3 NS Pplat, cm H2O 275 25. patients with a 100PaO2/FiO2200 had a hospital mortality of 53.0%. patients with a 200PaO2/FiO2300 had a mortality of 39.8%. patients with a PaO2/FiO2>300 had a mortality of 16.7% (p=0.064) hospital mortality decreased 1.9\u20131.6-fold with every stage of PaO2/FiO2 severity. the lower the PaO2/FiO2 category, the higher the hospital mortality. mL/kg PBW 7.01.2 7.01.5 6.91.5 7.51.5 NS Pplat, cm H2O 285 256 246 245 0.0001 FiO2 0.940.10 0.730.18 0.540.09 0.0001 PaO2/FiO2, mm Hg 7814 14528 24226 35750 0.0001 Number of organ failures 2.51.5 1.91.4 1.51.3 1.01.2 0.0001 VFDs, days, median (IQR patients 100 289 83 6 0.064 Number of deaths, (%) 53 (53.0) 115 (39.8) 33 (39.8) 1 (16.7) At 24 h under SVS number of patients 103 243 108 24 0.000001 Number of deaths, (%) 69 (67.0) 104 (42.8) 26 (24.1) 3 (12.5) ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; PaO2/FiO2 ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen. a standardised ventilatory method based on preset PEEP and FiO2 levels is more precise than the use of PaO2/FiO2 at baseline or after 24 h of usual care. patients within an identical PaO2/FiO2 range at baseline or after 24 h may not have similar degrees of lung injury or prognosis. ALI has a range of severity from mild pulmonary insult to full blown ARDS. the assessment of PaO2/FiO2 at 24 h after ARDS diagnosis on SVS can be used to insure a better categorisation of patients by disease severity. the use of baseline or non-standardised PaO2/FiO2 values for fast enrolment into therapeutic trials may be responsible for patient selection bias. resuscitation, sedation, muscle paralysis, antibiotics, insulin, catecholamine, blood transfusion, intravascular catheterisation, intravascular catheterisation, insertion of chest tubes, selection of the best ventilatory pattern, etc. are implemented. a randomised controlled trial in patients with ARDS has been positive27. a high percentage of patients have milder forms of ARDS after 24 h of usual care. we would recommend randomising those who sustained the desired level of injury after 24 h of usual care while confirming established hypoxaemia on SVS. we did not enrol patients with mild ARDS under the Berlin criteria (PaO2/FiO2>200mm Hg) however, we do not believe that the exclusion of these patients weakens our results. we cannot expect our approach of risk stratification to hold for patients ventilated in a non-lung protective manner. there is no biomarker to identify patients as having ARDS. we must continue to search for methods to better define and stratify ARDS."}
