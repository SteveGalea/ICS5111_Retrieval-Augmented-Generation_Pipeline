{"summary": "prior studies have tested for such a role using arbitrary thresholds for population density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher or lower mortality. we study the case of the influenza pandemic of 1918\u201319 in india, where over 15 million people died in the short span of less than one year. india, where over 15 million perished in the short span of one year, was the single worst-affected country in terms of total mortality. factors affecting mortality from the pandemic included a lack of immunity to the virus, which resulted in the infection of higher-than-normal numbers of people. geography and population density in particular are potential factors for transmission and indirectly, human mortality. the same early and mild first wave was observed in other countries. it subsided by August, only to be followed by a second and far more virulent wave. a distinctive characteristic of this epidemic was its disproportionate impact on victims aged between 15 and 35 years. the city established the Metropolitan Board of Health to develop zoning codes to prevent overcrowding in the city and to establish standards for sanitary conditions. sudden virus outbreaks that could have led to widespread human pandemics, including H1N1 [37], SARS [38], and H5N1 [39] prompted a series of studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions. population density as a factor in the 1918 influenza pandemic has produced mixed results. the correlation between population density and mortality is mixed. a review of literature suggests the evidence linking higher population densities with higher mortality rates is mixed. despite interest in link between population density and influenza morbidity and mortality, little is known about critical turning points or population density thresholds above which the demographic cost of the pandemic may have exceeded that of low-population density areas. the aim of this paper is to apply a threshold estimation method to identify a population density threshold separating high-density districts in British India from low-density districts. not specified Garrett [55] United States 1918 - 1919 22 counties, each divided into countryside and towns Capitals, provincial towns, rural areas Based on weekly reports sent to county health officials Nishiura and Chowell [60] Japan Kanagawa, 199 regions Cities (> 20,000); Large towns (5,000 - 20,000); Small towns (2,000 - 5,000); Villages (2,000) McSweeney et al.

Garrett [55] found a positive relationship between mortality rates and population densities measured on a state-wide scale in the USA. despite the interest in the link between population density and population densities, there is a dire need for more research on this phenomenon. a threshold estimation method is used to identify a population density threshold separating high-density districts from low-density districts in terms of population loss. the results of our study contribute directly to the field of spatial epidemiology, which is concerned with spatial epidemiology. the point estimate of the threshold in model (1) was 19,067 PPSM (people per square mile), for which only one district, Calcutta, lay above the threshold. the results from this model suggest that Calcutta, the most densely populated district in British India, with a population density of 35,025 PPSM, is an outlier. discontinuous set of threshold values that could not be rejected was obtained, corresponding to the intervals 148\u2013209 and 381\u2013464 PPSM. the point estimate is 435 PPSM, which produced the lowest test statistic for the 381\u2013464 PPSM interval. the difference between low-density and high-density districts is large. for the 175 PPSM threshold, below-threshold districts experienced a population growth rate of 3.72% between 1918 and 1919. above-threshold districts experienced a growth rate of 4.69%, for a net difference of 0.97%. s [67] method of threshold estimation identified a threshold of 175 PPSM. below this threshold, districts experienced a decline in population of 3.72%, compared with 4.69% decline for districts above the threshold. this is significant in light of the often mixed findings of scholars on the relationship between population density and influenza mortality. threshold estimation method is designed to detect a single threshold based on a single threshold variable (in this case, population density) the data do not contain information about socioeconomic status (i.e., poverty, social class or income, or ethnicity) new analytic method, threshold estimation, introduces to study of epidemics. results suggest plans for pandemic preparedness and adaptation can be informed by the results of studies using this method. it is hoped this study will be used as a template to inform guidelines for pandemic preparedness. we have followed the approach of Davis [8] using changes in population size between 1918 and 1919 to create a picture of severity of the pandemic. this paper takes the position that the estimated population loss is an indicator of the severity of the pandemic as a whole, whether loss the direct result of influenza or of other conditions resulting from influenza. the data also do not contain information about socioeconomic status (i.e., poverty, social class or income, or ethnicity) this study may be viewed as a prototype on which health geographers can build using the more sophisticated data available in modern contexts. the data used in this study cover a larger area and population than any other single-country study of the pandemic, and thus have the strength of a large sample size. they introduce a new analytic method, threshold estimation, to the study of epidemics and their effects on populations and population growth. the data used in this study were obtained from six decennial censuses held in India, for the years 1891, 1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, and 1941 [78] we focus on these censuses, and not the two censuses preceding 1891, those of 1872 and 1881, on the basis of Davis\u2019 diagnosis that the earlier censuses undercounted the population by over 1%. the log of population is highly correlated (r = 0.999) with an alternate estimate of population density computed using the estimate of population in 1918 computed from the standard exponential population growth model allowing for a break in 1918-19. a fixed effects model allowing for each district to have different intercept and time trend terms to absorb heterogeneity in (the log of) population size and population growth. model (2) was LPO P it = 0 i + 1 i T t + 2 FL U t + 3 I D FL U t + 3 I D FL U t + 4 i T t FL U t + it (2) Data sources Following earlier studies that used census data, the data used in this study were obtained from six decennial censuses held in India. we do not use parallel data from the princely states of india. the dataset includes 199 districts for each census for a total sample size of 1,194 observations. in the 1941 census, the population statistics for each census were reported. all six observations for each district lie on the same side of the threshold. the model was a fixed effects model allowing for each district to have different intercept and time trend terms to absorb heterogeneity in (the log of) population size and population growth, and allowing for a drop in the population between 1918 and 1919, the year of the pandemic. the point estimate of the threshold value of D was the one for which the sum of squared errors for the above model was minimized. we also estimated models without district-level heterogeneity in the coefficient estimates corresponding to population growth. 4.81% 6.06% Standard errors in parentheses. *** p 0.01.
