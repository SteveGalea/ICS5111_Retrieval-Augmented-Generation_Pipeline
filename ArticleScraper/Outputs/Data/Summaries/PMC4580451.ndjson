{"summary": "two major genotypes of PRRSV, type 1 (European; prototype strain Lelystad) and type 2 (North American; prototype strain VR-2332), have been identified and share 55\u201370% nucleotide identity. PRRSV can cause a prolonged viremia phase and persist in pigs for long periods, primarily in tonsils and lymph nodes. inducible Tregs can be classified into several subtypes: TR1 cells that secrete interleukin (IL)-10; T helper (Th)3 cells that secrete transforming growth factor (TGF)-. in pigs, the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells exhibiting suppressor activity by a variety of mechanisms have been identified. Marc-145 cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO) containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. once the cytopathic effect was apparent, cell cultures were freeze\u2013thawed twice and the lysates were centrifuged at 650 g SERQLCLSSIQTAFNQGA 12 77\u201394 SSIQTAFNQGAGTCALSD 13 84\u2013101 NQGAGTCALSDSGRISYT 14 91\u2013108 ISYTVEFSLPTQHTVRLI 16 105\u2013123 SLPTQHTVRLIRATASPSA 3m 15\u201332 DGQPVNQLCQMLGKIIAQ 7m 42\u201359 GKKNKKKNPEKPHFPLAT 12m 77\u201394 PBMCs were placed into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Corning) and incubated for 3 h in an advanced RPMI 1640 medium at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. non-adherent cells were removed by washing with RPMI 1640. s expressing PRRSV structural proteins were amplified with the special primers (S1 Table) and cloned into the pFastBac Dual vector. the forward primers of each ORF contained a kozac sequence CCACCATGG. the reverse primers of each ORF contained a 6 His tag and the stop codon. plasmids carrying the full-length PRRSV cDNA were individually transfected into Marc-145 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the mutations in the rescued viruses were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. Foxp3 intracellular staining was performed with anti-rat/mouse Foxp3-PE (Clone FJK-16s; eBioscience), which had cross-reactivity with swine Foxp3 [26], using the Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (Staining, Fixation/Permeabilization and Permeabilization Buffers; eBioscience), to obtain the three-color staining CD4FITC CD25APC Fox CSFE-labeled PBMCs were co-cultured with the sorted CD4+ CD25high lymphocytes in a 96-well plate at a Treg:PBMC ratios of 1:10, 2.5:10 and 5:10. results are expressed as percentage of suppression determined with the formula: % suppression = 100 [1 (% proliferation w/PRRSV/% proliferation w/mock)] [35] eptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 once the cytopathic effect was apparent. cell cultures were freeze\u2013thawed twice and the lysates were centrifuged at 650 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. the supernatant containing the virus was collected, titrated, and stored at \u201370\u00b0C. porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO), overlaid on Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) all animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University (permit number: IACECNAU 20121001) d in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 ng/ml recombinant porcine granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rpGM-CSF; R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml recombinant porcine IL-4 (rpIL-4; R&D Systems) at 37\u00b0C. cells were incubated for 5 days with replacement of 50% of medium on day 3. recombinant baculoviruses were obtained according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol of the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) protein expression was determined by infecting SF9 cells (Invitrogen) the concentrated protein was quantified using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and stored at \u201320\u00b0C until needed. recombinant viruses were obtained and cloned by plaque assay. mutations in the rescued viruses were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. the Tregs frequency was evaluated by flow cytometry (BD FACS Canto II), and data were analyzed using FlowJo version 7.6.1 software. all cells were harvested and stained with an appropriate concentration of anti-CD4-FITC and anti-CD25-APC as described previously. CSFE-labeled PBMCs were co-cultured with the sorted CD4+ CD25high lymphocytes in a 96-well plate at a Treg:PBMC ratios of 1:10, 2.5:10 and 5:10. the results are expressed as percentage of suppression determined with the formula: % suppression = 100 [1 (% proliferation w/PRRSV/ % proliferation w/mock)] [35] +Foxp3+ Tregs among HP-PRRSV-infected MoDCs was significantly higher than that co-cultured with mock-infected MoDCs. the percentage of Tregs was not significantly increased in HP-PRRSV-infected PBMCs alone, compared with that treated with Marc-145 cell lysates. sorted the CD4+CD25high subpopulation and analyzed the expression of Foxp3. compared to mock treatment, the PRRSV-induced Tregs had a significant suppressive effect on proliferation of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. the level of suppression was correlated with the number of Tregs that was added to the culture system. GP5, M and N proteins of HP-PRRSV were purified and used to examine their effects on Tregs induction. only N protein significantly induced proliferation of Tregs. data came from three independent experiments. data analysis was done using one-way ANOVA. significant differences are shown (*P0.05, **P0.01 and ***P0.001) peptides 3 (aa 15\u201321), 7 (aa 42\u201348) and 12 (aa 88\u201394) significantly induced Tregs compared to PBS. all three peptides induced Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. RSV N protein were key amino acids in Tregs induction. rBN-N15D at residue 15 mutated to aspartic acid (D) and rBN-R46K at residue 46 mutated to lysine (K) were key amino acids. residues 15 and 46 mutated to D and K. rBN-N15D, r46K and rBN-N15D/R46K-R were also rescued. they induced plaques in Marc-145 cells similar to rB/wt. rBN-N15D, rBN-R46K and rBN-N15D/R46K significantly reduced Tregs proliferation when compared with rB/wt. the number of Tregs induced by rBN-N15D and rBN-R46K was lower than that with rB/wt. the percentage of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs among HP-PRRSV-infected MoDCs was significantly higher than that co-cultured with mock-infected MoDCs. the percentage of Tregs was not significantly increased in HP-PRRSV-infected PBMCs alone. the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ lymphocytes were only observed in the CD4+CD25high subpopulation [30]. the PRRSV-induced Tregs had a significant suppressive effect on proliferation of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. the levels of TGF- and IL-10 in HP-PRRSV BB0907 group were significantly higher than those in the C-PRRSV S1 group (P0.05) Fig 2. Effects of different PRRSV strains on Tregs induction. the effects of N protein from different PRRSV on Treg induction were determined. BB-N and S1-N significantly increased expression of TGF- and IL-10. peptides 3 (aa 15\u201321), 7 (aa 42\u201348) and 12 (aa 88\u201394) significantly induced Tregs compared to PBS. all three peptides induced Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. the effects of Tregs induction could be enhanced by adding peptides 3 and 7 together. 15N and 46R in HP-PRRSV N protein were key amino acids in Tregs induction. rBN-R46K, rBN-R46K and rBN-N15D/R46K (residues 15 and 46 mutated to D and K) were rescued. a revertant virus rBN-N15D/R46K-R was also rescued. rBN-N15D, rBN-R46K and rBN-N15D/R46K were infected with rB/wt, rBN-N15D, rBN-R46K and rBN-N15D/R46K. the number of Tregs induced by rBN-N15D, rBN-R46K and rBN-N15D/R46K was lower than that with rB/ aa 15\u201321, 42\u201348 and 88\u201394 in HP-PRRSV N protein were important for inducing Tregs. phenotype of induced porcine Tregs closely resembles that of TGF-secreting Th3 Tregs in humans, mice and swine. peptides 3 (aa 15\u201321), 7 (aa 42\u201348) and 12 (aa 88\u201394) significantly induced Tregs proliferations compared to PBS. peptides 3 (aa 15\u201321), 7 (aa 42\u201348) and 12 (aa 88\u201394) significantly induced Tregs proliferations. the results of the structures of the peptides between HP-PRRSV and C-PRRSV analyzed by using SPLIT 4.0 software revealed that the indexes of -helix and -fold of 3m were higher than peptide 3. and the index of -helix of 7m has a litter rise than that of peptide 7. the amino acid 15N is close to NLS-1 and 46R is located in the NLS-2 region, which interacts with the recombinant GP5 and M proteins were unable to induce Tregs proliferation. role of proteins GP2, GP3 and GP4 in inducing Tregs proliferation should be studied in the future. type 1 and 2 PRRSV have an up- or downregulatory effect on expression of CD80/86. differences between PRRSV strains in regulation of these molecules have been observed in vitro. the mechanisms contributing to Tregs induction should be further studied. the site-directed mutants were constructed using pEASY-BB-D as the template. fragment D of pCMV-BB0907 was replaced by the analogous fragments derived from mutants of pEASY-BB-D. the white histograms represent the PBMCs, and the grey histograms represent the cultured MoDCs. primer sequences for construction of the baculovirus structural proteins, the subgenomic replicon of PRRSV and site-directed mutagenesis."}
