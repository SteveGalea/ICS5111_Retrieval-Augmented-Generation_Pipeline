{"summary": "human noV (HuNoV) is the leading cause of acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. human noV (HuNoV) is responsible for severe cases of the disease with high morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old. double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) must be unwound for efficient RNA synthesis. RNA helicases are capable of enzymatically unwinding dsRNA structures. helicases are grouped into six superfamilies (SFs), SF1 to SF6, based on conserved helicase motifs. flavivirus NS3, alphavirus NSP2, coronavirus nsp13 and alphatetravirus Hel [20\u201323], which belong to helicase SF1 and SF2. the NS3 NTPase has been enzymatically characterized in RHDV [24], Southampton virus, norwalk-like virus (25] and HuNoV [26]. expression and purification of recombinant MNV NS3 proteins. expression and purification of recombinant MBP-NS3 proteins. n-terminal domain (NTD, 1-105) with a linker (106\u2013129), core domain (130\u2013285) and core domain (CTD, 290\u2013364) terminal 12 His tag and 10 Asn linker between MBP and NS3 are indicated in black and grey. arrow heads indicate positions where amino acids were substituted with alanine. arrow heads indicate positions where amino acids were substituted with alanine. d 16/600 column was eluted as a molecular mass that was much larger than 440 kDa. a high-molecular-weight protein band of 1200 kDa could be observed on native gel electrophoresis. the recombinant MNV NS3 protein exists as oligomers, with average molecular sizes of 35\u201340 nm. the effects of the amount of ATP (upper panel), MBP or MBP-NS3 (lower panel) on NTPase activity were tested. the effects of temperature, pH and MgCl2 concentration on NTPase activity were also tested. the addition of the MBP-NS3 protein decreased the emission of the Cy5 signal, while it increased the Cy3 signal. the signals did not change in the absence of the NS3 protein or in the presence of MBP alone. RNA destabilization activities of bacterially expressed MBP-NS3 were most efficient at 37 and 45 \u00b0C, pH 7\u20139, and in the absence of NaCl. divalent cations such as MgCl2 and MnCl2 were found to be essential for RNA destabilization. previous studies of the picornavirus 2C, which is also a member of SF3 helicases, revealed that these proteins not only have an RNA helicase activity conserved motifs of 2C significantly reduced the NTPase activity. these mutations did not alter the RNA destabilization activity of NS3 in the absence of NTP. the conserved motifs are crucial to the NTPase activity of NS3. the conserved core domains of MNV NS3 are crucial to the NTPase activity of NS3 as well as MNV replication in cells. but, like the 2C of obliqua picorna-like virus, have no effect on the RNA-unwinding activity of NS3. MNV-1 NS3 was first cloned as a recombinant protein with C-terminal fusion of the His tag. the protein was mostly expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. the NS3 protein was then expressed as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein. arrow heads indicate positions where amino acids were substituted with alanine. native and mutant MBP and MBP-NS3 proteins were analysed by 12 % SDS-PAGE. molecular masses of standard proteins are shown in kDa on the left. AGE and dynamic light scattering studies indicated that the recombinant MNV NS3 protein exists as oligomers, with molecular sizes of 35\u201340 nm. the recombinant protein exists as oligomers, with average molecular sizes of 35\u201340 nm, where 14\u201315 MBP-NS3 molecules may form complexes, or as larger aggregates. ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP were preferred over ATP and ATP. ATP was the most favoured substrate for hydrolysis by MNV NS3. dsRNA substrates labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes at the end of each strand were used for the assays. both Cy3 and Cy5 emission signals were monitored every 1 min. the optimum temperature, pH and effects of NaCl concentration were determined. the effects of temperature, pH, NaCl, divalent cations, MgCl2, MnCl2 and ATP on FRET efficiency were measured. RNA chaperone activity with different nucleotides was also measured. motifs A, B and C of NS3 play important roles in viral replication. plasmid-based reverse-genetic system generated recombinant MNVs. recombinant plasmids harboured K169A, D213A and N260A mutations of NS3. these mutations did not alter the RNA destabilization activity of NS3 in the absence of NTP. RNA helicases and chaperones, the major RNA remodelling proteins, unwind or destabilize dsRNA structures [11\u201313] in picornaviruses, there are at least three RNA remodelling enzymes: 2C (NTPase, helicase), 3AB (precursor of VPg) and 3D (RNA polymerase). the localization of NS3 to the replication complex may be related to the helicase motifs that are characteristic of an enzyme involved in positive-strand RNA virus replication. mutations of three important motifs of 2C (A, B and C) significantly reduced NTPase activity [18]. recombinant MNVs with mutated NS3 at these motifs did not show any sign of replication in cells. norovirus NTPase demonstrated that this protein can form homodimers and homooligomers through a head-to-head, head-to-tail, or tail-to-tail configuration. entropy or disorder transfer proposed that intrinsic disordered RNA chaperones transfer their entropy or disorder to RNA molecules to aid RNA refolding by destabilizing misfolded RNAs. NS3 was able to break hydrogen bond(s) between two strands of RNA. but the NS3-driven complete unwinding of dsRNA could not be seen. it is widely believed that RNA chaperones usually destabilize short hairpin structures, rather than unwinding dsRNA. cDNA encoding NS3 for cloning was amplified by PCR using pET-DUET1 restriction sites. the plasmids were designated pET-MBP and pET-MBP-NS3 respectively. further studies are needed to find out whether other nonstructural proteins have similar activities. mutagenesis using pET-MBP-NS3 as a template followed by DpnI digestion of the template DNA. a three-dimensional MNV-1 NS3 structure was modelled using the helical repeat protein DHR79 (PDB ID 5CWP) and enterovirus 71 2C (PDB ID 5GRB) as templates for amino acids 1\u2013151 and 152\u2013364, respectively. soluble fraction pooled, diluted with four volumes of pre-chilled buffer A. non-specific bound proteins were washed with buffer A, and MBP-containing proteins were eluted with buffer B. a reaction mixture containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NTP and 4 M MBP-NS3 was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. a reaction mixture containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NTP and 4 M MBP-NS3 was incubated at 37 the dsRNA was denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. this was then used for the FRET assay in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabelled ssRNA (5\u2032- AGACACAAUGGACGAUCUACAACAG-3\u2032) variation in the FRET values at time=0 may have been due to the initial burst of enzyme activity and experimental errors. BV-2 cells were used to titre infectious virus for TCID50 analysis. the transfected cells were harvested by freezing and lysed by one cycle of freeze and thaw. the infectious viruses were titred via TCID50 analysis as previously described. a three-dimensional MNV-1 NS3 structure was modelled by submitting its amino acid sequence to the ROBETTA full-chain protein structure prediction server. five models were predicted using the helical repeat protein DHR79 (PDB ID 5CWP) and enterovirus 71 2C (PDB ID 5GRB) as templates for amino acids 1\u2013151 and 152\u2013364, respectively. non-specific bound proteins were washed with buffer A, and MBP-containing proteins were eluted with buffer B [20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM maltose]. eluted fractions were pooled, concentrated and subjected to an HLSuperdex 200 column. ten microlitres of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NTP and 4 M MBP-NS3 were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. the released inorganic phosphate was measured by a colorimetric phosphate assay kit. pcDNA3\u2013MNV system [32] was used to produce recombinant MNV with mutated NS3. specific NS3 mutations were generated using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) the sequences of wild-type NS3 were modified from GGGAAAACC to GGGgcAACC for K169A.
