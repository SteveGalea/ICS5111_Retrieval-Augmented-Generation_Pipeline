{"summary": "the explanted spinal cord was embedded in a 5% agarose gel to maintain spinal cord integrity during superfusion with oxygenated medium. we used transgenic Thy1-YFP mice which express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in a subset of medium- to large-caliber axons to study axonal pathology in the ventral spinal cord during the course of demyelination. axonal degeneration occurs in the ventral side of a mouse spinal cord. an explanted mouse spinal cord embedded in a 5% agarose gel (Upper) and mounted on a coverslip with the ventral surface exposed before 2P imaging. -32 staining appeared punctate or absent, indicating severely damaged axons. loss of YFP signal correlates with varying degrees of axonal damage. loss of YFP fluorescence correlates with varying degrees of axonal damage. colabeled with -SMI-32 (red) to show damaged axons. white asterisk represents a lesion with multiple SMI-32+ damaged axons. spinal cord slices stained for ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), a marker of activated macrophages and microglia (30). despite a high number of activated macrophages and microglia in the spinal cord 3 wk following transplant, GFP fluorescence did not overlap with Iba-1 staining. at day 1 following transplant, clusters of cells had limited motility at the site of transplant. in control noninfected mice, GFP-NPCs moved with an average velocity of 1.9 0.1 mmin1 (n = 5) directional persistence analysis was used to describe direction of cell movement over time. a subset of GFP-NPCs expressed Ki-67, a nuclear marker of cellular proliferation (32), indicating proliferation occurred 2 wk after transplant. proliferation was significantly increased within the JHMV-infected spinal cord. time-lapse images of a GFP-NPC cluster expanding at the indicated time points (min:s) in a noninfected spinal cord 7 d posttransfer (Movie S3). GFP-NPCs preferentially established residence in regions with extensive axonal damage as determined by the FAD index. the migration of NPCs away from damaged axons was strongly correlated with the loss of axonal YFP fluorescence. the migration of NPCs away from damaged axons was strongly correlated with the loss of axonal YFP fluorescence. GFP-NPCs bring together YFP-fluorescent axonal segments in JHMV-infected Thy1-YFP spinal cord. panels depict cell positions at times indicated, along with superimposed tracks depicting progressive YFP migration since the beginning of the record. time-lapse images showing a GFP-NPC (green) migrating away from a FAD Thy1-YFP+ axon (yellow) in a posttransfer we cultured NPC neurospheres isolated from mice that express GFP under the control of the myelin proteolipid protein promoter (PLP-GFP) two weeks following transfer into a JHMV-infected spinal cord, NPCs formed stable interactions with damaged axons. in these cells, GFP fills the cytoplasm of the cell body, revealing differentiated NPCs wrapped around damaged axons. LP-GFP (green) and stage 1 FAD axons (yellow) in the JHMV-infected Thy1-YFP spinal cord 15 d posttransfer. the explanted spinal cord was embedded in a 5% agarose gel to maintain spinal cord integrity during superfusion with oxygenated medium. lesions in the ventral spinal cord contained axons displaying a spectrum of \u201cfocal axonal degeneration\u201d (FAD) morphologies. long, continuous axons with no damage are defined as \u201cFAD stage 0\u201d. axons contain focal swellings progressing along the length of the axon. % SEM displaying different FAD stages in normal spinal cord (N) and in lesioned regions 1\u20134 wk after JHMV infection. time-lapse images showing progression of FAD in a Thy1-YFP spinal cord 7 d following JHMV infection. loss of YFP signal correlates with varying degrees of axonal damage. but it does not necessarily indicate complete axonal transection. axons exhibiting loss of both YFP and SMI32 at multiple loci were more common in FAD 2 axons. white asterisk represents a lesion with multiple SMI-32+ axons. image shows YFP+ axonal regions without damage (white arrow, YFP+SMI-31+), damaged axonal regions with YFP signal (yellow arrow, YFP+SMI-31+) Activated microglia and macrophages labeled with anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) are shown in red, overlaid with DAPI-stained nuclei (blue) inset shows a separation of green and red fluorescence in the enlarged area. the directional persistence of transplanted NPCs was significantly lower in the JHMV-infected spinal cord, compared with the noninfected spinal cord. at day 1 posttransplant, GFP-NPCs were observed distal to the transplant site in both infected and noninfected mice. two-photon imaging revealed that GFP-NPCs exhibit dynamic morphologies in the ventral spinal cord. cells were observed to proliferate, with large (10 m) \u201cbuds\u201d protruding off clusters of GFP-NPCs. GFP-NPCs actively extended and retracted processes in both the noninfected and the noninfected spinal cord. large clusters of GFP-NPCs preferentially established residence in regions with extensive axonal damage. following migration to FAD lesions, GFP-NPCs initiated intercellular interactions with stage 1 and stage 2 FAD axons. a representative image from the same spinal cord as in A shows increased colocalization between GFP-NPCs and \u201cstage 2 FAD\u201d axons in a more damaged lesion. number of transferred GFP-NPCs found in lesions is plotted vs. FAD severity of the lesions in the JHMV-infected Thy1-YFP spinal cord 8 d posttransfer. time-lapse images showing a GFP-NPC migrating away from a FAD Thy1-YFP+ axon (yellow) in a JHMV-infected Thy1-YFP spinal cord 14 d posttransfer. Imaris analysis of the axonal fluorescence depicted in A with Thy1-YFP pixel volume represented in yellow. two weeks after transfer into a spinal cord, NPCs formed stable interactions with damaged axons. in these cells, GFP fills the cytoplasm of the cell body. YFP fluorescence increased (Fig. 7C), indicating increased axonal health. analysis of change in Thy1-YFP fluorescence intensity during PLP-GFP wrapping presented as arbitrary fluorescent units (AU) MBP (red), YFP+ axons (yellow) and colocalization between overlapping GFP-NPC (green) and MBP fluorescence were determined using the Imaris colocalization tool (white) axonal damage in MS is considered a secondary event that occurs following myelin loss in response to accumulation of myelin-reactive lymphocytes within the CNS. emerging evidence supports the possibility that axonal damage precedes demyelination. loss of fluorescence in axons indicates total axonal transection (20, 23) loss of fluorescence in intact axons does not necessarily mean axonal transection. axonal YFP fluorescence changes reversibly during and subsequent to interaction with transplanted NPCs. fluorescence is particularly sensitive to acidic pH (51), indicating that restoration of normal physiological pH may underlie rapid increases in axonal YFP fluorescence observed during remyelination. the motility of engrafted NPCs was not examined. the motility of engrafted NPCs was slower than in the absence of infection. ed GFP-NPCs are the first step in events leading to NPC differentiation and remyelination (53, 54) we have previously shown that transplanted NPCs directly or indirectly contribute to endogenous remyelination (11, 55), although evidence of direct remyelination was not entirely conclusive. mice were killed by inhalation of halothane (Sigma-Aldrich) at various days postinfection. spinal cords were removed and processed for analysis. all experiments were approved by the University of California, Irvine. spinal cords were isolated from thoracic vertebra 4 to lumbar vertebra 2. explanted spinal cords were imaged with a laser excitation of 900 nm. increased power to the blue channel photomultiplier tube and Gaussian filtering were applied. the murine spinal cord was extracted and processed for optimal cutting temperature compound and resin-embedded sections as previously described (8). primary antibodies included rabbit anti-Iba1 (1 mg/mL; Wako Chemicals), rabbit anti-MBP (1:200; Chemicon), mouse anti-SMI-31 (phosphorylated neurofilament H; 1:1,000; EMD Millipore), or mouse anti-SMI-32 (nonphosphorylated neurofilament H; 1: Statistical significance for velocity measurements was determined using Student\u2019s t test. the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to calculate significance for nonnormally distributed directional persistence measurements. undifferentiated GFP-NPCs or PLP-GFP-NPCs were transplanted at spinal cord T10 at day 14 p.i. into C57BL/6 and Thy1-YFP mice. imaging volumes of x = 270 m, y =212 m, and z = 100 m were acquired using Slidebook version 4.2. 3D stacks were compiled in Metamorph version 6.1 (Molecular Devices) 5% (vol/vol) purified goat anti-mouse IgG was added. secondary antibody used for anti-Iba1 and anti-MBP was Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Invitrogen); for anti-SMI-31 and anti-SMI-32."}
