{"summary": "pandemic of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) emerged in 2008 with severe consequences for production in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and Chile. earlier disease epidemics in China, South Korea, and Japan had regional impacts. but as infections were often lethal, Psa was predicted to pose a major threat to global kiwifruit production. an outbreak of disease with symptoms similar to those produced by Psa was reported to have occurred in 1983\u20131984 in Hunan, China. no positive identification was made or isolates were stored at that time. the cultivation of more recently developed gold-fruiting cultivars derived from A. chinensis var. chinensis began only in the 2000s. strains from each clade are capable of infecting and growing to high levels in both A. chinensis var. deliciosa and A. chinensis var. chinensis. the severity of the latest global outbreak is predicated on the expansion in cultivation of clonally propagated highly susceptible cultivars. isolated Psa from cultivated kiwifruit across six provinces in china. strains from multiple clades are present in both Korea and Japan. despite high similarity at the level of the core genome, there has been substantial gene gain and loss even within the single clade. strain isolations were performed from same-day sampled leaf and stem tissue by homogenizing leaf or stem tissue in 800 l 10 mM MgSO4. single colonies were restreaked and tested for oxidase activity. additional 2 250 bp paired-end sequencing was performed at new Zealand Genomics Limited (Auckland, New Zealand) using the miSeq platform. a near complete version of this genome was used as a reference in our previous publication. retaining variants if they had a minimum alternate allele count of ten reads and fraction of 95% of reads supporting the alternate call. average coverage was calculated with SAMtools and used as a guide to exclude overrepresented SNPs. removal of 3,122 recombinant positions produced a 1,059,722 bp core genome alignment including 2,953 variant sites. a starting tree was used to compute 100 bootstrap replicates (-m GTRGAMMA -p $RANDOM -b $RANDOM -# 100) membership within each phylogenetic clade corresponds to a minimum average nucleotide identity of 99.70%. identification of the Pangenome Genomes were assembled with SPAdes (v.3.6.2) using the filtered, trimmed and corrected reads and the \u2013careful flag to reduce mismatches and indels. assemblies were annotated using Prokka (v.3.6.1, A.J. Page et al. 2015). orthologs present in 99% (59 out of a total of 60) genomes were considered core in order to account for assembly errors. pathogenicity assays Growth assays were performed using both stab inoculation as in McCann et al. (2013) an initial inoculum of 108 cfu/ml and four replicate plants at day 0 and day 6 at all subsequent sampling time points. single colonies were restreaked and tested for oxidase activity. they were then stored at 80 \u00b0C in 15% glycerol. the remainder of the liquid culture was reserved for genomic DNA isolation. Variant calling was performed on all P. syringae pv. actinidiae isolates for which read data was available. read data was corrected using the SPAdes correction module. invariant sites with a minimum coverage of ten reads were also retained in the alignment. areas of low (less than ten reads) or no coverage are represented as gaps relative to the reference. an implementation of ClonalFrame suitable for use with whole genomes was employed to identify recombinant regions. membership within each phylogenetic clade corresponds to a minimum nucleotide identity of 99.70%. the average nucleotide identity was determined using a BLAST-based approach in JspeciesWS (ANIb) orthologs present in 99% (59 out of a total of 60) genomes were considered core in order to account for assembly errors. BLASTn-based confirmation (E value cutoff 105) was used to confirm the identity of predicted virulence or pandemic-clade-restricted genes in genome assemblies. genomes of 50 P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) isolated from symptomatic kiwifruit between 2010 and 2015 were sequenced. the genomes represent the main Psa genotypes from the countries producing 90% of kiwifruit production worldwide. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed the four clades of Psa known to cause bleeding canker disease were represented among the 80 strains. all Psa isolated from kiwifruit across six different provinces in china are members of the same clade: Psa-3. this subset is referred to as the pandemic lineage of Psa-3. the within-clade ratio of recombination to mutation (R/theta) is reduced in Psa-3 (6.75 102 3.24 105) relative to between clade rates (1.27 5.16 104), and the mean divergence of imported DNA within Psa-3 is 8.54 103 5.18 107. clades defining Psa-1 and Psa-3 exhibit similar levels of diversity. assuming they are evolving at a similar rate, they may have been present in Japan and China for a similar duration. the strains isolated during the latest kiwifruit canker pandemic cluster with nine Chinese isolates. parenthetical numbers represent the number of strains in the core, soft-core, shell, and cloud genomes. the most polymorphic region corresponds to the location of the integrative and conjugative element (ICE) in Psa NZ13. the exact region from which the pandemic arose remains unclear. there was likely extensive regional transmission of Psa both prior and subsequent to the emergence of the pandemic in china. the reduced level of diversity within the core genome of pandemic Psa-3 demonstrates these strains have been circulating for a shorter period of time relative to those responsible for earlier outbreaks in both Japan and Korea. 2,206 SNPs mapping to the core genome of Psa-3 were identified. most strain-specific SNPs are found in the two most divergent members of the Psa-3 clade. the pandemic clade differs from the more divergent Chinese strains by 72 shared SNPs. of the 953 substitutions introduced by mutation in Psa-3, 927 resulted in amino acid substitutions, two resulted in extensions and 24 resulted in premature truncations. multiple independent mutations in the same gene may be a function of gene length, mutational hotspots or directional selection. polymorphisms are present in the pandemic new Zealand and Japanese isolates. one of these is a silent substitution in an ion channel protein (AKT31947.1 A213G), another is an intergenic (TG) mutation at position 362,522 of the reference Psa NZ13 chromosome. the remaining four are nonsynonymous substitutions in an adenylyltransferase (AKT32845.1, W977R); 107 cfu/g 3 days post inoculation declines to 8.8 104 cfu/g at 14 dpi. Psa NZ13 attains 3.0 109 and 4.2 107 cfu/g 3 and 14 dpi. loss of TTSS does not inhibit growth of Psa C17. the most striking difference between the pandemic lineage and more divergent Chinese Psa-3 strains is the deletion of multiple genes involved in cellulose production and acetylation. the deletion of the cellulose-encoding Wss operon significantly compromises ability to colonize plant surfaces. it is possible that loss of this locus aids movement through the vascular system and/or dissemination between plants, by limiting capacity for surface colonization. the entire P. syringae species complex estimated the core genome to be 48% of an average P. syringae genome, and 20.6% of the total pangenome. estimates range from 17% of the entire Ralstonia solanacearum pangenome to 59% of the Erwinia amylovora pangenome. phylogeography of Psa The genomes of 50 P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) isolated from symptomatic kiwifruit in china, Korea and new Zealand between 2010 and 2015 were sequenced. the genomes of 50 Psa isolated from symptomatic kiwifruit in china, Korea and New Zealand between 2010 and 2015 were sequenced. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed the four clades of Psa known to cause bleeding canker disease in kiwifruit were represented among the 80 strains. the first clade (Psa-1) includes the pathotype strain of Psa isolated and described during the first recorded epidemic of bleeding canker disease in Japan (1984\u20131988) the 4,853,413 bp core genome of all 62 strains in Psa-3. the core genome includes both variant and invariant sites. the core genome excludes regions unique to or deleted from one or more strains. clades defining Psa-1 and Psa-3 exhibit similar levels of diversity. these clades share a common ancestor: assuming they are evolving at a similar rate, they may have been present in Japan and China for a similar duration. two recently isolated Japanese pandemic Psa-3 isolated in 2014 group within the new Zealand isolates, suggesting a transmission event between Japan and New Zealand. Fig. 2 suggests a single transmission event between Japan and new Zealand. Isolates from four different provinces in Western China are represented among the pandemic lineage. but each province harbors basally diverging Psa-3 isolates. there is no phylogeographic signal among the more divergent Chinese strains. the estimated divergence time of Psa broadly considered is likely older than the pandemic and epidemic events with which they are associated. the earliest report of disease cause by Psa-1 occurred in 1984 and the first report of infection from the latest pandemic was issued in 2008. pandemic clade differs from the more divergent Chinese strains by 72 shared SNPs. protein-coding sequence accounts for 88.4% of the nonrecombinant, gap-free core genome of this clade. two substitutions are shared exclusively by the european pandemic strains. one silent substitution in a gene encoding an acyltransferase superfamily protein (AKT31915.1 C273T) is shared among the European pandemic. six of nine Chinese pandemic strains (C3, C29\u201331, C67, C69) a 44,620 bp deletion event in Psa C17 resulted in the loss of 42 genes encoding the structural apparatus and conserved type III secreted effectors. this strain is highly compromised in its ability to grow in A. chinensis var. deliciosa \u201cHayward\u201d. osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs, in particular opgG and opgH) are required for motility, biofilm formation and virulence in various plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi. the premature stop mutation in opgC likely results in the loss of glucan succinylation. 990 genes are present in 15\u201395% of strains (9\u201357 genomes), the so-called \u201cshell genes\u201d. the flexible genome is comprised of the \u201cshell\u201d and \u201ccloud\u201d genes. 3,608 genes are present in one to eight strains. three divergent ICEs have been previously described from the global pandemic lineage. no phylogeographic signal is evident within a single Chinese province. pandemic strains isolated in Italy, Portugal, Chile, and new Zealand are derived from a single lineage within this clade along with a subset of Chinese isolates. the new Zealand isolates share six clade-defining mutations, indicating that a separate and single transmission event was responsible for the outbreak of disease there. our phylogeographic study of a single clade giving rise to a pandemic in P. syringae has revealed far greater diversity than was previously appreciated. the amount of diversity present within Psa-3 indicates this population was present and circulating in China. both pandemic and divergent Psa-3 were isolated from four out of six provinces. d of three distinct clades of Psa (1, 5 and pandemic Psa-3) coexistence of multiple clades suggests that the source population of all Psa resides there rather than in China. the apparent presence of just a single clade in China may reflect the use of clonal monocultures of popular cultivars. 188 Pseudomonas spp. isolated from 98 wild A. chinensis var. deliciosa or A. chinensis var. chinensis sampled across china. early work by Ushiyama et al. (1992) found that Psa could be isolated from symptomatic A. arguta plants in Japan. the emergence of Psa over the last three decades offers a rare opportunity to understand the relationship between wild populations of both plants and microbes and the ecological and evolutionary factors driving the origins of disease. it is now possible to exclude China as the native home to the source population, but the precise location remains unclear."}
