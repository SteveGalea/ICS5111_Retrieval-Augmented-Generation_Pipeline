{"summary": "bats were captured manually and by using mist nets and hand nets. adults and subadults of both sexes were captured. each bat was measured, sexed, and identified to the genus or species level. total nucleic acids were extracted from 200 L of a phosphate buffered saline suspension of each swab by using the QIAamp Mini Viral Elute kit. the positive PCR products were purified by gel extraction by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) the positive PCR products were then sequenced on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) results of detection of CoV RNA in fecal swabs of bats from Kenya*. PCR results, no. positive/no. tHKU9-like 16 6/9 BtCoVA970-like, BtHKU9-like 13 2/11 Taphozous hildegardeae 14 0/3 Total 41/221 (19%) *CoV, coronavirus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome. an additional 47 selected human and animal coronaviruses from the national center for biotechnology information database are included. two sequences from Chaerophon spp. bats (location 17) were closely related to a SARS-like CoV cluster. 2 NA sequences show 89% identity with the nearest previously characterized bat. one cluster contains the recently described BtHKU9 with >95% NA sequence identity. the other cluster contains no other previously known CoVs. this finding is consistent with studies from china in which BtCoV1A-like and BtHKU8-like CoVs were frequently identified but only in Miniopterus spp. bats (15) this may suggest that viruses of the BtCoV1A-like cluster and the BtHKU8-like cluster are specifically adapted to Miniopterus spp. bats. other genetically similar CoVs were detected in several different bat species. foundation for detecting new disease introductions that may present a public health threat."}
