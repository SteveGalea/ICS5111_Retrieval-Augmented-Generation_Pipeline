{"summary": "66 bats were caught at 3 locations in papua new Guinea. they were anesthetized by using ketamine and medetomidine. blood samples were held at room temperature for 24\u201348 hours. serum separated by centrifugation as required. the seroprevalence of the 2 types of paramyxoviruses, HeV/NiV at 55% and TioPV/MenPV at 56%, is high. the most striking finding is the presence of antibodies to both groups of viruses in 36% (24/66) of the samples. Considering that VNT is a more specific and less sensitive assay, the actual positive rate could be >36%. a serologic survey was conducted for 4 groups of viruses, 2 from the family Paramyxoviridae and 2 from the genus Orthoreovirus, family Reoviridae. a high prevalence of antibodies to both henipaviruses and TioPV/MenPV in individual pteropid bats highlights the need for more structured studies to investigate the infection dynamics of zoonotic viruses. the bat rubulavirus(es) circulating in papua new Guinea are more MenPV-like (Australia), whereas the henipavirus(es) seem to be more NiV-like (Asia) these findings are consistent with those in Indonesia (15)"}
