{"summary": "apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G or A3G) inhibits viral replication by preferentially deaminating dC to dU in the viral -ssDNA during reverse transcription. some studies suggest that mutations induced by A3G are occasionally sub-acute. a recent study concluded that hypermutation is almost always a lethal event and makes little or no contribution to viral genetic variation [15]. the deaminase activity of A3B has been linked to mutations found in breast cancer [18], and overactive AID can lead to non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma [19]. biochemical studies have established a framework for A3G hotspot selectivity. novel protein fusion strategy captures A3GCTD bound to a nucleotide. results reveal key interactions that govern substrate sequence specificity of A3G and related cytidine deaminases. fusion design captures A3GCTD bound to a nucleotide. ssDNA substrate contains both the Pot1 cognate sequence, GGTTAC, and the A3G hotspot sequence, CCCA, separated by a 14-nucleotide linker sequence. we confirmed that the fusion construct retains its native activity towards the A3G DNA substrate. the dA nucleotide bound to the -1 pocket is shown in orange. the red star (schematic) and red sphere (structure) represent the zinc ion found in the catalytic site. no reflections 40118 Redundancy 3.3 (3.3) Rmerge 0.105 (0.856) Rpim 0.064 (0.539) Mean I / I 5.1 (1.1) Completeness (%) CC1/2 last shell 97.5 0.70 Refinement Resolution () 44\u20132.9 No. Reflections 32909 Rwork / Rfree 0.24/0.29 (0.30/0.37) No. atoms 11958 B-factors 88.2 RMSD in Bond lengths (\u00b0 nucleotide at the 3\u2019-side of the deaminated dC is preferred for dC. binding pocket likely allows binding of all nucleotides before encountering the preferred hotspot sequence for catalysis. residues in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket are shown in teal sticks. the backbones of I314 and P210 form hydrogen bonds with the adenosine in the -1 nucleotide pocket. residues D316 and D317 in the adenine bound structure adopt similar conformation to that of the apo structure. this suggests that A3G samples this conformation in the absence of DNA and while scanning the DNA for its preferred hotspot sequence. loop 1 of A3GCTD swings approximately 3 towards the adenine. movement of loop 1 leads to repositioning of W211 for stacking interactions with the adenine. residues Y315 and Y385 remain static. mutating residues on loop 1 can disrupt the deaminase activity of A3G completely in the case of W211A or partially in the case of P210G. we mutated residues P210 and W211 and determined the enzymatic activity of the mutants. this is consistent with previous mutagenesis findings that the aromatic residues in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket are critical for the catalytic and antiviral activity of A3G. AID shares the greatest degree of sequence conservation with A3G in the residues that interact with the +1 base, with only a single amino-acid variation at the A3G P210 (AID R19) position. the -1 nucleotide-binding residues may affect the selectivity for the +1 nucleotide in the ssDNA substrate. arrow marks the A3G P210 corresponding position. deaminase activity assay shows that the mutation does not disrupt deaminase function when compared to WT A3GCTD. errors represent standard errors of the parameters. the mutation decreased the affinity for CCCA while increasing the affinity for both CCCT and CCCG substrates. the preference for the +1 nucleotide was calculated based on the ratio of efficiency for catalyzing DNA containing adenine compared to thymine or guanine at this position. however, the A3GCTD P210R mutant had a three-fold decrease in A:T preference compared to WT, indicating a switch of preference from the presence of viral infectivity factor (Vif) completely averted both WT and mutant A3G antiviral activity. the substitution did not affect the overall antiviral activity of A3G or its susceptibility to Vif-mediated degradation. -2 position nucleotide, mutation frequencies for preferred sites with a C at -1 position (5\u2019CC), both A3G-WT and A3G-P210R prefer CCC over TTC, ACC, or GCC. the significantly preferred nucleotide in the -2 or +1 positions are indicated (*P 0.001) change in 5\u2019CCA:5\u2019CCT preference is consistent with, but not as drastic as observed in our biochemical studies using the A3GCTD. the substantial change in 5\u2019CCA:5\u2019CCT ratio in the cell-based assay using full-length A3G variants corroborates the notion that the nucleotide binding pockets are tightly entwined. changes to the -1 nucleotide pocket affect the nucleotide preference at the +1 position when the -1 nucleotide is the preferred cytidine (5\u2019CC) and at the -2 position when the -1 nucleotide is the non-preferred thymidine (5\u2019TC). this results lend support to our biochemical and structural studies with Pot1A3GCTD. adenine in the -1 pocket is colored orange and the expected deaminated cytidine is blue. the fusion protein has the same deamination activity as that of A3GCTD. the structure was determined in a space group with four independent copies of the protein in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. both A3GCTD and Pot1 together with the Pot1 cognate DNA were clearly visible in the electron density. the rest of the ssDNA was disordered with clear electron density for only one nucleotide, adenine. A3G-adenine structure captures a non-preferred nucleotide in the -1 pocket. it processively scans ssDNA [35] and prefers to deaminate dC in the context of the 5\u2019-CCCA sequence. the nucleotide preceding the deaminated C is the +1 nucleotide. the backbone of residues P210 and I314 bond with the amine group of the adenine. Y315 hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group of the DNA backbone. the overall architecture of the A3GCTD DNA binding pocket is conserved. conserved residues W285, I314, and Y315 of the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket are held in similar positions. in the A3A structure, D131 forms a hydrogen bond with the Watson-Crick edge of the hotspot nucleotide thymidine. residues in the -1 pocket change conformations in response to the identity of the nucleotide that A3G encounters. the adenine bound structure of A3GCTD aligns to the apo structures of A3GCTD. loop 1 swings approximately 3 towards the adenine. the movement of loop 1 leads to the repositioning of W211. loop 1 in a3GCTD-DNA complex moves 3 compared to apo A3GCTD (PDBID 3IR2) to enclose the adenine in the -1 pocket. mutating residues on loop 1 can disrupt the deaminase activity of A3G completely in the case of W211A. we examined the importance of rigidity of loop 1 by mutating P210 to a flexible glycine. this mutation caused a reduction in the deaminase activity. this suggests that loop1 is important not only for interacting with the nucleotides, but also affects A3G catalysis. AID shares the greatest degree of sequence conservation with A3G in the residues that interact with the +1 base. only a single amino-acid variation at the A3G P210 (AID R19) position results in change of preference for +1 nucleotide. error values are based on fits to the hyperbolic Kd curve, kobs = (kchem*[E])/(Kd+[E]) errors represent standard errors of the parameters. to mimic AID, we mutated P210 in A3G to arginine. mutations in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket perpetuate changes in the +1 nucleotide preference. mutations in the +1 nucleotide-binding pocket perpetuate changes in the +1 nucleotide preference. mutating loop 1 of A3G has a broad effect on hotspot mutation rates in vivo. uedotyped HIV-1vif viruses produced in presence or absence of A3G-WT or A3G-P210R. mutation frequencies for the preferred sites with a C at -1 position (5\u2019CC), both A3G-WT and A3G-P210R prefer CCC over TCT, ACC, or GCC. the significantly preferred nucleotide in the -2 or +1 positions are indicated. despite a comparable antiviral activity of WT A3G and the P210R mutant, our biochemical data suggest that each A3G construct exhibits different nucleotide preference at the +1 position. the overall 5\u2019GG-to-AG hypermutation frequency was similar for both WT and P210R A3G, suggesting that the mutation did not significantly alter the deamination activity of the enzyme. both WT A3G and P210R A3G preferred cytidine compared to thymidine at the -2 position when the -1 position was a cytidine. however, WT A3G maintained a preference for cytidine at the -2 position (5\u2019CTC:5\u2019TTC ratio = 0.07/0.01; P 0.0001). despite this hotspot preference, deamination can still occur to a lesser extent when other nucleotides are at the flanking positions. for example, A3G is capable of cytidine deamination with any nucleotide at the +1 position, albeit at different frequencies. mutating residues 210PW211 causes deformations in the -1 nucleotide pocket. this perturbation further perturbs the conformation of other nucleotide-binding sites. mutating residues may shift residues in the catalytic pocket. the wild-type A3GCTD was constructed from A3G191-384-2K3A gene inserted into the NcoI\u2013XhoI site of the expression vector pMAT9s. all constructs were transformed and expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Lucigen) grown in TB media to an OD600 of 0.6. lysate was centrifuged [13,000 rpm, 40 min, 4\u00b0C] and proteins were purified by nickel affinity column (Qiagen) on FPLC.
