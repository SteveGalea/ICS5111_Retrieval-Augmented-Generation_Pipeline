{"summary": "a recombinant adenovirus expressing EGFP-tagged LC3B has been used to study autophagy in avian systems. a recombinant adenovirus expressing EGFP-tagged LC3B has been used to study autophagy in primary rat hepatocytes. inhibition of autophagy results in increased replication of Sindbis virus,17 herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)18 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)18,20,21 Conversely, viruses also use autophagy to increase their replication. expression of nonstructural protein 6 (Nsp6) alone from IBV, as well as Nsp6 homologs from related coronaviruses and arteriviruses, is able to induce autophagy. this was not dependent upon virus pathogenicity and virus replication was unaffected by induction or inhibition of autophagy. the avian LC3 orthologs were highly related to counterparts in other species. the identified avian genes clustered together with their orthologous genes from other species in a phylogenetic tree. therefore chicken LC3A, LC3B and LC3C sequences were RT-PCR-amplified. the LC3C protein accession numbers used were Gallus gallus NP_001026632.1, Zebra Finch NP_001232222.1, Human NP_073729.1, Mouse NP_080436.1, Rat NP_074058.2, Pig NP_003130606.1, Bos taurus NP_001094528.1 and Zebra Finch database ID TR:H0ZK62_TAEGU. avian EGFP-LC3 paralogs respond to treatments to induce or inhibit autophagy. cells were transduced with either a control adenovirus expressing GFP, rAd5-GFP, -LC3B or -LC3C. transduced cells incubated in full-nutrient medium (FM) were compared with transduced cells incubated in either HBSS, to induce autophagy, or in HBSS with 10 nM wortmannin, a PI3 kinase/PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor known to inhibit autophagosome formation. the distribution was unaffected by any of the treatments. rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3A, rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B, rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B and EGFP-Av-LC3C are markers for autophagy in primary chick kidney (CK) cells. there was no change in the number of puncta per cell in CK cells expressing GFP from rAd5-GFP. CK cells were transduced with rAd-EGFP, rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B or rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B G120A. cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in FM, HBSS or HBSS continaing 10 nM wortmannin. CK cells were transduced with adenovirus expressing EGFP-tagged avian LC3B G120A or a wild-type control and were starved in HBSS to induce autophagy. further experiments were performed to confirm that LC3 puncta observed were as a result of post-translational cleavage of LC3 at position G120. second EGFP-LC3-II band detected at 36 kDa. a deletion at the N terminus was still observed for the G120A mutant. a decrease in level of LC3-II was not seen in the presence of wortmannin. autophagosomes containing EGFP-Av-LC3A, -LC3B and -LC3C fuse with endosomes/lysosomes, allowing the progression of the full autophagy pathway to be visualized in avian cells. the percent EGFP signal colocalized with LAMP1 was quantified using Imaris coloc module. EGFP-Av-LC3A 0.57 (0.08) EGFP-Av-LC3B 0.51 (0.17) EGFP-Av-LC3C 0.64 (0.02) Mean plus standard deviation shown from three independent experiments. CK cells were transduced with recombinant adenoviruses encoding both EG. FP- and FLAG-mCherry-tagged LC3 paralogs after 24 h cells were starved for 2 h to induce autophagic signaling. nuclei (blue) were stained with DAPI. primary CK cells and DF1 cells were transduced with either rAd-GFP-LC3B, derived from rat LC3 or rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B. after 24 h, cells were infected with the nonpathogenic Beau-R41 strain of IBV. however, neither the mammalian nor the avian GFP-LC3B protein indicated the induction of autophagic signaling. CK cells were transduced with rAd-GFP-M-LC3B (mammalian) or rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B (avian) and after 24 h, cells were infected with IBV, Beau-R strain. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and labeled with anti-dsRNA (red) to show IBV infection. DF1 cells were transfected with pmCherry-N1-nsp6 or pmCherry-N1-nsp1034. after 24 h cells were fixed and examined using confocal fluorescence microscopy. EGFP-Av-LC3B showed a pronounced relocalization to cytoplasmic puncta when compared with untransfected cells. DF1 cells were transfected with pmCherry-N1-nsp6 or pmCherry-N1-nsp10 (red) after 24 h, cells were transduced with rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B (green) nuclei (blue) were stained with DAPI. differences in virus titer between treatments were shown to be not significant. at 12 and 24 hpi, induction of autophagy by starvation resulted in an approximately 10-fold reduction in virus titer. at 24 hpi there was a comparable reduction when cells were incubated in HBSS containing wortmannin. CK cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in FM, HBSS, HBSS+WM, Rapamycin or FM+WM. cells were lysed and lysates separated on 10% NuPAGE in MOPS buffer. proteins were detected by western blot with anti-LC3 or anti-actin. IBV does not inhibit autophagy induced by HBSS starvation or rapamycin. CK cells were transduced with rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B and 24 h later. at 24 hpi, cells were washed and incubated for a further 2 h. the avian LC3 orthologs were highly related to counterparts in other species. the identified avian genes clustered together with their orthologous genes from other species in a phylogenetic tree. therefore chicken LC3A, LC3B and LC3C sequences were RT-PCR-amplified. the LC3C protein accession numbers used were Gallus gallus NP_001026632.1, Zebra Finch NP_001232518.1, Human NP_115903.1, Rat NP_080011.1, Rat NP_955794.1, Mouse NP_080436.1, Rat NP_074058.2, Pig NP_001177219.1, Bos taurus NP_001001169.1. Sequence of primers used to clone avian EGFP-LC3 paralogs respond to treatments to induce or inhibit autophagy. cells were transduced with either a control adenovirus expressing GFP, rAd5-GFP (kindly provided by Sharon Tooze10) or rAd5-GFP. transduced control cells incubated in full-nutrient medium (FM) were compared with transduced cells incubated in either HBSS, to induce autophagy, or in HBSS with 10 nM wortmannin, a PI3 kinase/PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor known to inhibit autophagosome formation. when CK cells were transduced with rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3C and incuba wortmannin inhibited formation of EGFP-LC3 puncta per cell in CK cells. there was no change in number of puncta per cell in CK cells expressing GFP from rAd5-GFP. there was no change in number of puncta per cell in CK cells expressing GFP. CK cells were transduced with rAd-EGFP, rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B or rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B G120A. after 24 h cells were washed and incubated in HBSS. nuclei were stained with DAPI. avian LC3 paralogs expressed from recombinant adenovirus can be used to visualize autophagic signaling in either an avian cell line or in primary avian cells. further experiments were performed to confirm that LC3 puncta observed were as a result of post-translational cleavage of LC3 at position G120 and lipidation, giving rise to LC3-II. CK cells were transduced with a recomb a second EGFP-LC3-II band was detected at 36 kDa. a second EGFP-LC3-II band was detected at 35 kDa. autophagosomes labeled with avian EGFP-LC3 paralogs fuse with endosomes. EGFP-Av-LC3A, -LC3B or -LC3C-labeled autophagosomes fuse with endosomes/lysosomes. adenovirus transduced avian EGFP-LC3A, -LC3B or -LC3C. cells were incubated in HBSS for 2 h to induce autophagy. AMP1 was quantified from (A) using Imaris coloc module. EGFP-Av-LC3A 0.57 (0.08) EGFP-Av-LC3B 0.51 (0.17) EGFP-Av-LC3C 0.64 (0.02) Mean plus standard deviation shown from three independent experiments. CK cells were transduced with recombinant adenoviruses encoding both EGFP- and FLAG-mCherry-tagged LC3 paralogs. after 24 h cells were starved for 2 h in HBSS to induce autophagic signaling. rat-derived GFP-LC3B is commonly used in studies of autophagy function. primary CK cells and DF1 cells were transduced with either rAd-GFP-LC3B or rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B. after 24 h, cells were infected with the nonpathogenic Beau-R41 strain of IBV. CK cells were transduced with rAd-GFP-M-LC3B (mammalian) or rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B (avian) and after 24 h, cells were infected with IBV, Beau-R strain. CK cells were transfected with rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B (green), mock-infected and labeled with anti-dsRNA (red). DF1 cells were transfected with pmCherry-N1-nsp6 or pmCherry-nsp1034 and 24 h post transfection, transduced with rAd-GFP-Av-LC3B. expression of the IBV replicase protein induced autophagic signaling in avian cells. DF1 cells were transfected with pmCherry-N1-nsp6 or pmCherry-N1-nsp10 (red) after 24 h, cells were transduced with rAd-EGFP-Av-LC3B G120A (green) differences in virus titer between treatments were shown to be not significant by Student\u2019s t-test. at 12 and 24 hpi, induction of autophagy by starvation resulted in an approximately 10-fold reduction in virus titer. CK cells were washed and incubated for 1 h in FM, HBSS, HBSS+WM, Rapamycin or FM+WM. proteins were detected by western blot with anti-LC3 or anti-actin. infectious bronchitis virus is not able to inhibit autophagy. CK cells were starved in HBSS or treated with rapamycin to induce autophagy. IBV does not inhibit autophagy induced by starvation in HBSS or by using rapamycin. rat derived GFP-LC3B colocalizes with human LC3A, LC3B and LC3C upon cellular starvation. rat LC3A and two splice variants of LC3B also shown to colocalize upon induction of autophagy. authors highlighted that all three proteins could be used as autophagosomal markers. infection of mammalian vero cells with IBV resulted in autophagy at 24 hpi. however, when expressed individually, the membrane-bound IBV replicase protein Nsp6, but not Nsp4 or cytoplasmic Nsp10, induced autophagy. MHV, a betacoronavirus, has also been shown to induce autophagy in infected cells. we have demonstrated that classical autophagy does not play a major role in the replication cycle of IBV or other coronaviruses. a role for autophagy in the development of DMVs seems less likely. previous observations show that IBV Nsp6 and homologs from other members of the Nidovirales order, MHV and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) induce autophagy but do not enter autophagosomes. but the Nsp6 protein from SARS-CoV does partially colocalize with LC3B. this again highlights a difference in protein function when expressed in mammalian and avian cells. autophagy may be playing a role in innate cellular defense to the virus. when tested, IBV could inhibit autophagy at an upstream step of these signals or via an alternative route of autophagy signaling. avian orthologs of the mammalian LC3A (XM_417327 and XP_417327), LB3B (NM_001031461 and NP_001026632) and LC3C (XM_419549 and XP_419549) precursor genes were identified in the genome of the Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus), using the Ensembl database. cDNAs of the three avian step 1, 98\u00b0C 30 sec, step 2, 98\u00b0C 10 sec, 55\u00b0C or 65\u00b0C 45 sec, 72\u00b0C 1 min, step 3, 72\u00b0C 2 min, step 4, 4\u00b0C hold with step 2 repeated to give 30 cycles. avian-derived LC3s were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, 6084-1) between the XhoI and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites to generate avian EGFP-LC3 and FLAG-mCherry-LC3 genes were PCR amplified from plasmids pEGFP-C1-Av-LC3A, -LC3B and -LC3C. the products were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO and subcloned into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST. the EGFP-tagged avian LC3 rAd-FLAG-mCherry-Av-LC3A, rAd-FLAG-mCherry-Av-LC3B, rAd-FLAG-mCherry-Av-LC3C and rAd5-EGFP-Av-LC3B G120A were rescued using the ViraPower protocol (Invitrogen) 293 cells were transfected with each pAd/CMV/V5 recombinant viruses were titrated to determine the amount required to produce 75% or more GFP or mCherry expressing CK, CEF or DF1 cells at 24 h post-transduction. cells were then washed 4 times using Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma, H8264) cells were washed four times using HBSS and starved in HBSS. after 2 h incubation, cells were fixed at 20\u00b0C in ice-cold methanol for 4 min. cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-LAMP1 at a dilution of 1:1000 in 2% BSA in PBS and washed three times using 2% BSA in PBS. dilution of 1:1000 followed by secondary antibody anti-mouse-Alexa 568 diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA in PBS. coverslips were analyzed using a leica DM6000 confocal microscope. cell lysates were separated on a 10% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, NP0302BOX) in MOPS buffer. proteins were detected using anti-GFP diluted at 1:1000 (Abcam, ab290), anti-LC3 diluted at 1:1000 (Sigma Aldrich, L7543) or anti-actin diluted at 1:750 (actin, and, Abcam, ab3280) IBV replication CK cells were pretreated for 1 h in FM, HBSS, HBSS.
