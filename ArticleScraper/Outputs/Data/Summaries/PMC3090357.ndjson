{"summary": "HCV causes acute and chronic hepatitis infection which can eventually lead to permanent liver damage, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. it is estimated that three to four million people are infected with HCV every year [1]. the term \"lysosomotropic agent\" was introduced by deDuve and co-workers (1974) to designate substances that are taken up selectively into lysosomes. it leaves open the chemical nature of a lysosomotropic substance and the mechanism of its uptake. lysosomotropic agents such as NH4C1, chloroquine and methylamine exert direct antiviral effects on several RNA viruses. toxicological analysis of Chloroquine and NH4Cl were done in liver cells. antiviral effects were studied in HCVpp of 1a and 3a genotype. the MTT substance is reduced by mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenases in living cells to purple formazan crystals that are not soluble in aqueous water. the absorption of dissolved formazan in the visible region correlate with the number of viable cells [21]. statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (version 16.0, SPSS Inc) numerical data were analyzed using student's t-test and ANOVA. the absorption of dissolved formazan in the visible region correlates with the number of viable cells [21] to investigate cellular toxicity, 2 104 cells were plated into 96-well plates. after 24 h, different concentrations of Chloroquine and NH4Cl were added. numerical data were analyzed using student's t-test and ANOVA. P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. results MTT assay is a widely used test for evaluating cytotoxicity of compounds/herbs in cell cultures. fusion of the viral envelope protein(s) is triggered by low pH within the endosome. we therefore tested the infectivity of HCVpp after treatment of target cells with different concentrations of Chloroquine and NH4Cl. the MTT substance is reduced by mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenases in living cells to purple formazan crystals that are not soluble in aqueous water. the absorption of dissolved formazan in the visible region correlates with the number of alive cells [21] HCVpp infection is pH dependent Enveloped viruses enter cells through two main pathways: direct fusion at the plasma membrane and receptor-mediated endocytosis. fusion of the viral envelope protein(s) is triggered by low pH within the endosome. a major advancement to look into HCV entry process was the development of HCVpp, consisting of native HCV envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2 assembled onto retroviral core particles. this assay is only dependent on the entry steps mediated by the heterodimer E1E2 (binding, endocytosis, and fusion) lysosomal weak bases are known to affect acid vesicles. NH4Cl and Chloroquine are lysosomal weak bases known to affect acid vesicles leading to dysfunction of several proteins. Chloroquine and NH4Cl inhibit HCVpp entry in a dose-dependent manner at non toxic concentration. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
