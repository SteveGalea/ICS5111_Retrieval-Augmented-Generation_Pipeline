{"summary": "a collection of antiviral drugs was tested against SARS-CoV, the etiologic agent of the atypical pneumonia. information on antiviral drugs was obtained from prescribing information sheets or from communications with the manufacturer. nucleoside analogues are a diverse class of compounds. ukocytes and 1a and 1b were used to express antiviral activity. different terms have been used to express antiviral activity. EC50, 95% effective concentration (EC95) and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) seltamivir (Tamiflu) Roche 10,000 M No Zanamivir (Relenza) GlaxoSmithKline 1,000 M No Other Amantadine (Symmetrel) Novartis 1,000 g/mL No Foscarnet (Foscavir) AstraZeneca 8,000 M No Tenfold dilutions were tested to cover a broad range of concentrations above and below inhibitory dosages. 2 mL of stock virus was added to a confluent monolayer of vero E6 cells. the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. 13 mL of medium 199 supplemented with 5% FCS was then added. 100 L of serial 10-fold dilutions of the drugs were incubated with 100 L of Vero E6 cells. the incubation period was 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, except for the interferons, which were incubated overnight with the cells. 10 L of virus at a concentration of 10,000 PFU/well was then added to each of the test wells. a collection of antiviral drugs was tested against SARS-CoV, the etiologic agent of the atypical pneumonia. a polynomial of order three was used to approximate the data and extrapolate IC50 and IC95 values. interferons were the next major class of antivirals studied. various subtypes of interferon (2a, 2b, n1, and n3, human leukocyte) and (1a and 1b) were used. amantadine, an old antiviral compound, was also studied. dilutions of the drug were tested to cover a broad range of concentrations above and below inhibitory dosages. compounds already present in aqueous injections were made up to volume by using Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution. SARS-CoV 2003VA2774 (an isolate from a SARS patient in Singapore), which has been previously sequenced (14), was propagated in vero E6 cells. Briefly, 2 mL of stock virus was added to a confluent monolayer of Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. 13 mL of medium 199 supplemented with 5% FCS was then added to each well. 100 L of serial 10-fold dilutions of the drugs was incubated with 100 L of Vero E6 cells, giving a final cell count of 20,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. the incubation period was 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, except for the interferons, which were incubated overnight with the cells. 10 L of virus at a concentration of 10,000 PFU/well was then added to each of the test wells. concentration of drug that inhibits 50% of plaques in each well was determined. results were plotted in Microsoft Excel, and a polynomial of order three was used to approximate the data. human leukocyte interferon (Multiferon) at 500,000 IU/mL. none of the other drugs showed complete inhibition of CPE. none of the other drugs showed complete inhibition of CPE. feron (IU/mL) Betaferon (IU/mL) Alferon (IU/mL) 10,000 10,000 500,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 5,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 500 10 100 Rebif (IFN--1a) showed slight inhibition of CPE at 250,000 IU/mL, but the inhibition was not complete at the screening virus load of 10,000 PFU/well. all four drugs again showed inhibitory effect, although the CIA100 were dependent on viral loads. ribavirin is inactive against SARS-CoV. a plaque reduction assay format with 100 PFU of SARS-CoV (MOI = 0.0005) was conducted to determine the IC50 for Betaferon, Alferon, and Multiferon, the three compounds that showed greatest potency for inhibition of CPE. a collection of 19 antiviral drugs was tested in the SARS-CoV CPE inhibition assay (Table 2). the set of drugs tested included seven interferons, five nucleoside analogs, three protease inhibitors, two RT inhibitors, and two neuraminidase inhibitors. complete inhibition of the CPE was observed for four of the seven interferons in the initial screen. 25\u2013100 g/mL HIV and other retroviruses 3.2\u201350 g/ml (MIC) Herpes and poxviruses suppression Lamivudine 0.0006\u20130.034 g/mL HIV Zidovudine 0.003\u20130.013 g/mL HIV Fortovase 1\u201330 nM (EC95) HIV Crixivan 25\u2013100 nM HIV Relenza 0.005\u201316 M Influenza virus Tami the four active interferons and ribavirin were retested at two lower viral challenges, 103 and 102 PFU/ well. at the lowest viral load the CIA100 were 5 IU/mL for both interferon -1b (Betaferon) and human leukocyte interferon (Multiferon); and 50 and 250 IU/mL for interferon -n3 (Alferon) and interferon -n1 (Wellferon dose-response curves for Alferon (a), Betaferon (b) and Multiferon (c) were determined by plaque reduction assays. IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) and IC95 (95% inhibitory concentration) values were calculated by using the fitted functions describing the curves. combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon has become standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C (20\u201322) ribavirin and Betaferon have been used as anticancer and antiviral agents against the SARS-CoV. plasma levels of interferons administered through the subcutaneous route are usually low with correspondingly short half-lives. in view of their mechanism of action, absolute serum levels may not be meaningful as a measure of the biologic activity of interferons. specific interferon subtypes which inhibit SARS-CoV may not necessarily have the same effect in other cells. n1, -n3, and human leukocyte interferon exhibit antiviral activity in an in vitro model. potential drugs for in vivo research and clinical management of SARS-CoV infection."}
