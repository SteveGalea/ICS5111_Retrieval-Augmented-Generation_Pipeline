{"summary": "phylogenetic and PAQ analyses have revealed a highly dynamic variation of intrapopulation diversity of FMDV quasispecies. the population diversity suffers striking expansions in the presence of mutagens and then compressions when the presence of the mutagenic analogue was discontinued or when a mutation that decreased sensitivity to a mutagen was selected. phylogenetic relationships established with consensus viral sequences have been instrumental to classify viruses. for many purposes it is important to analyze phylogenetically the relationship between different genomes from the same mutant spectrum of a viral quasispecies. this type of analysis may reveal the existence of genome subpopulations within mutant spectra that might encode different phenotypic traits. the reliability of the derived genome clusters may be questionable when the number of mutations distinguishing different components of a mutant spectrum is small. the general topology of a NJ tree may be robust enough to provide information about the evolutionary pattern undergone by the viral population. the molecular epidemiology of FMDV has been analyzed in detail by establishing an extensive database of genomic nucleotide sequences. extinction can occur with a modest average number of mutations per genome that generate a class of genomes termed defectors. extinction can occur with a modest average number of mutations per genome that generates a class of genomes termed defectors. phylogenetic and clustering methods can provide a quantification of the mutagenic activity exerted on viral populations by reflecting changes in genetic distances. this type of representation has revealed that viral populations can respond rapidly to environmental changes, with striking switches between relaxation and compactness of the population diversity. viral populations derived from each passage are indicated with a \"p\" before the passage number. the viral populations derived from each passage are indicated with a \"p\" before the passage number (i.e. C-S8p50 means C-S8c1 passaged 50 times in BHK-21 cells) treatment with ribavirin A 100 mM solution of R was prepared in PBS, sterilized by filtration, and stored at -20\u00b0C. cell monolayers were preincubated with R for 7 h prior to infection. infections in the absence of R, and mock-infected cells were maintained in parallel. RA populations originated from serial cytolytic infections of MARLS in the presence of the indicated concentrations of ribavirin (R) the concentration of R was increased from 200 M to 800 M in the first 30 passages and from 800 M to 5000 M between passages 45 and 60. the population obtained after 35 parallel passages of MARLS in the absence of drug. ML trees were generated by the program PUZZLE [16] using the Tamura-Nei substitution model [60] and the Gamma distributed rates with eight parameters (TN-8) as heterogeneity model. a ML analysis of mutagenized populations of FMDV was performed by the program Modelgenerator [61], available at [63]. normalized Shannon entropy (H) is a measure of the proportion of identical sequences in a distribution. the clones of each viral population were grouped together under the minimum possible radius, considering no partition. software was used to infer the Ks and Kn in the FMDV genome using 200 nucleotide windows and a shift of 100 nucleotides per step. the software calculates the confidence interval using Monte Carlo simulations. the origin of BHK-21 cells and procedures for cell growth have been previously described. a clone derived from subjecting C-S8c1 to 280 plaque-to-plaque transfers in BHK-21 cells has been described in the primary publications. nucleotide sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Abi Prism; Applied Biosystems) FMDV MARLS was serially passaged in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations (200 M to 800 M) of R. for each passage, 4 106 BHK-21 cells were infected with 1\u20134 106 PFU of virus from the previous passage until cytopathology was complete (about 30 h in the presence of R, and 16 h in the absence of R) treatment with fluorouracil, azacytidine and guanidine hydrochloride 5-fluorouracil (FU) and azacytidine (AZC) were used as mutagenic base analogues. guanidine hydrochloride (G) was used as inhibitor of FMDV replication. solutions were sterilized by filtration and stored at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 15 days before use. ML trees were generated by the program PUZZLE [16] using the Tamura-Nei substitution model [60], and the Gamma distributed rates with eight parameters (TN-8) as heterogeneity model. a ML analysis of mutagenized populations of FMDV was performed by the program Modelgenerator [61], useful to identify the optimal evolutionary model. the clones of each viral population were grouped together under the minimum possible radius, considering no partition. the average distance (AD) value, with respect to the central sequence reported by PAQ, was calculated as a measure of the intrapopulation diversity. the populations are represented as spheres with the diameter proportional to the AD value. FMDV MARLS was serially passaged in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations (200 M to 800 M) of R. for each passage, 4 106 BHK-21 cells were infected with 1\u20134 106 PFU of virus from the previous passage until cytopathology was complete. concentrations of ribavirin (R) increased from 200 M to 800 M in the first 30 passages and from 800 M to 5000 M between passages 45 and 60. a bifurcation was established at passage 30 and the populations were subjected to 5 additional passages in the absence of R. ML trees were generated by the program PUZZLE [16] using the Tamura-Nei substitution model [60] and the Gamma distributed rates with eight parameters (TN-8) as heterogeneity model. a ML analysis of mutagenized populations of FMDV was performed by the program Modelgenerator [61], useful to identify the optimal evolutionary model. clones of each viral population were grouped together under the minimum possible radius. the average distance (AD) value was calculated as a measure of the intrapopulation diversity. Statistical analysis One Way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc tests for non equal n, and standard errors were calculated using Statistica 6.0 software package (StatSoft 2001). results Phylogenetic evaluation of the mutagenesis-induced diversification of viral populations The present study was aimed at analyzing retrospectively sets of consensus and clonal nucleotide sequences determined in our laboratory. nt. sequenced Drug treatmentc Mutationsd Transitionse Transversionse Minimum mutation frequency (10-3)f Maximum mutation frequency (10-3)g Min/max ratio Hh ADi No Drug p1 6609\u20138013 5 7025 None 2/2 0.50 0.50 0.28 0.28 1 0.58 0.50 AZCp1 6609\u20138013 5 7025 [200 g/ml] FU 2/2 1 0 0.28 0.28 1 0.58 0.50 No drug p cDrug treatment (AZC, azacytidine; FU, 5-fluorouracil; R, ribavirin) and concentrations are as described in Figure 1. eExpressed per 1 in each population. gMaximum mutation frequency is the number of different mutations divided by the total number of nucleotides sequenced. the trees were constructed with sequences from the 3D (polymerase)-coding region (nucleotide residues 6609 to 8013; numbering of residues as in [47]) the populations analyzed correspond to those depicted in Figure 1A. trees were constructed using the NJ method, with 1000 bootstrap resamplings. each tree represents the analysis of one individual population from the MARLS lineage depicted in Figure 1B. the control population CAp35 shows a characteristic tree with lower diversity than the populations treated with mutagenized FMDV populations. the clonal structure of mutagenized FMDV populations was applied to the same FMDV populations (Figure 1) studied by phylogeny. values are based on nucleotide sequences of the 3D(polymerase)-coding region, genomic residues 6609 to 8013 for A), and 6667 to 7997 for B. population RA0p35 was also analyzed using residues 7150\u20137997. RAp35 showed a 15.47-fold larger AD value (Tukey post hoc test, p 0.001) than the population CAp35, the parallel control in the absence of the drug. further passages in the presence of 800 M R led to a reduction of diversity of population RAp45. RAp60 and RAp35 have lower AD values than in population RAp35. mutation profile in mutant spectrum indicated a specific pattern of mutations was associated with each mutagen. FU-treated populations accumulated an excess of U C transitions. -RA populations preferentially fixed transitions C U and G A [42] the NJ tree derived from consensus nucleotide sequences of the entire FMDV genome of R treated populations disclosed an unusually rapid fixation of mutations in the consensus sequence of RAp45. in the course of serial cytolytic passages of C-S8c1, mutations accumulated at a rate of approximately 0.20 mutations per passage [48], with MARLS displaying a similar rate of 0.24 mutations per passage. a linear regression constructed with C-S8c1 and successive passages (C-S8c1 lineage) is shown (y = 0.1987x-1.6922; R2 = 0.9882) the position of MARLS and RAp45 is indicated. the genomes were analyzed in windows of 200 nt and a shift of the window of 100 nt in each step. the scaled protein-coding region of the FMDV genome is indicated in the abscissa [23,24] the confidence intervals were calculated by k-estimator using Monte Carlo simulations [68]. c RAp35 0.16 N.D RAp45 0.08 0.09 (MALRS) RAp60 0.07 0.08 (MARLS) RA0p35 0.12 N.D.

FU-treated populations accumulated an excess of U C transitions. -RA populations preferentially fixed transitions C U and G A. FMDV genome of R treated populations disclosed rapid fixation of mutations in the consensus sequence of RAp45. mutations accumulated at a rate of approximately 0.20 mutations per passage [48], with MARLS displaying a similar rate of 0.24 mutations per passage. RA deviated to 1.13 mutations per passage, suggesting a very fast evolution associated with the presence of R. values are based on the nucleotide sequence of entire genomes. a linear regression constructed with C-S8c1 and successive passages (C-S8c1 lineage) is shown (y = 0.1987x-1.6922; R2 = 0.9882) the position of MARLS and RAp45 is indicated. the genomes were analyzed in windows of 200 nt and a shift of the window of 100 nt in each step. the scaled protein-coding region of the FMDV genome is indicated in the abscissa [23,24] the confidence intervals were calculated by k-estimator using Monte Carlo simulations [68]. bdn/ds is the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations (corrected per nonsynonymous site) to synonymous mutation (corrected per synonymous site), calculated as described in Methods [85,86]. cdn/ds calculated as in b, applied to consensus nucleotide sequences, compared with thecorresponding parental clone (given in parenthesis). arrows indicate high m.o.i. passages (1 to 5 PFU/cell) the circle with a cross represents an extinct population. the tree includes also clones derived from the population obtained after 3 passages of C-S8c1 in the presence of FU and G. poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus replicate in presence of mutagenic agents. mutation frequency increases at single base sites of poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus. mutant spectrum complexity increases by 6.4-fold. the NJ tree topology of a population evolved under enhanced mutagenesis conditions consists of a basal consensus sequence, with the individual components of the population radiating from it. the more mutated the population the bigger the radiation of the branches, and with no apparent population structure in the form of subclusters. the comparison of phylogenetic and PAQ analyses has documented striking expansions of the average intrapopulation genetic distance associated with mutagenic treatments. a 2.15-fold reduction in AD value was observed when the drug treatment was discontinued for only 5 passages. populations with FMDV including in its 3D (polymerase) replacement M296I -that decreases the sensitivity to R - displayed a 1.90-fold reduction in AD value. mutation frequencies are less definitory than PAQ (when analyzing AD) to characterize the internal genetic diversity of mutagenized viral populations. mutations of FU-treated, AZC-treated and R-treated populations. increase in mutant frequency with respect control populations. mutations did not accumulate at random along the viral genome, but accumulated at preferred genomic regions. clones subjected up to 409 bottleneck transfers are highly significant. average mutation frequencies are 5- to 37-fold higher than those associated with viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis. phylogenetic and PAQ approaches should be extremely helpful to monitor in a quantitative fashion. the average distance parameter (AD) reflects the intrapopulation structure better than the other estimators traditionally used.
