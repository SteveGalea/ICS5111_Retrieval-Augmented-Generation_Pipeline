{"summary": "influenza viruses can be transmitted via contact with respiratory secretions, large droplets, and aerosolized small particles/droplet nuclei. small particle aerosols and droplet nuclei are also of concern due to the potential for prolonged airborne suspension. the twostage bioaerosol sampler contains two microcentrifuge tubes and a backup filter, which separate airborne particulates based on their aerodynamic diameter. the sampler facilitates the direct processing of samples for downstream diagnostic applications such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. each 0.5 ml dose contains approximately 107 TCID50 (106.5\u2013107.5 median tissue culture infectious dose) per viral strain. the bioaerosol samplers were connected to personal air sampling pumps. the solution was aerosolized at 138 kPa (20 lbs/in2) air pressure. it passed through a diffusion drier and mixed with 26 l/minute dry filtered air. the bipolar ionizer employed in earlier studies 10 was not used. RNA extraction Viral RNA was extracted using the magMAXTM Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) the backup filters were aseptically removed, immersed in 1 ml of the supplemented lysis/binding solution and vortexed at moderate speed for 2 minutes. samples were centrifuged, placed in a thermocycler (Ashford, UK) and run under the following conditions: 25\u00b0C for 10 minutes, 48\u00b0C for 30 minutes, and 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. fluMist\u00ae was mixed with fungal spores and then collected. ters were eluted in 1 ml of the supplemented AP1 buffer, vortexed for 2 minutes, and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. samples were beadbeaten at maximum speed in a miniBeadBeater8 (BioSpec Products, Inc.) for 1 minute and chilled on ice for 2 minutes. the beadbeating/cooling steps were repeated twice. realtime PCR primers and probes Influenza strain Gene Sense primer Antisense primer TaqMan TAMRA probe H1N1. 10 l of the generated viral cDNA or fungal genomic DNA was added to 25 l Applied Biosystem\u2019s TaqManTM Universal PCR Master Mix. cDNA generated from a single dose of nonaerosolized FluMist\u00ae containing approximately 107 TCID50 per influenza strain. a negative control without template was included in all qPCR reactions. cDNA was generated from a single dose of nonaerosolized fluMist\u00ae containing approximately 107 TCID50 per viral strain. the bioaerosol samplers were connected to personal air sampling pumps. the vertical reference samplers were connected to a central vacuum line through a rotameter. airflow through each sampler was calibrated to 3.5 l/minute. the bipolar ionizer used in earlier studies 10 was not used. it drew air from a vertical probe placed at the same height as the bioaerosol sampler inlets. sampler pumps were switched off after 5, 10, 20 and 40 minutes. RNA extraction was carried out using the MagMAXTM Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) the supplied lysis/binding solution supplemented with carrier RNA was used in the extraction of viral RNA from either the neat FluMist\u00ae (qPCR standards) or experimental samples (T1 and T2). aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 44408, American Type Culture Collection) was grown on malt extract agar for 16 days at 24.9\u00b0C and the spores isolated as previously described. one dose of FluMist\u00ae was diluted with 49.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl containing 107 A. versicolor spores. dBeater8 chilled on ice for 1 minute and chilled on ice for 2 minutes. samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 11000 g. protein precipitation, washing, and drying of fungal DNA was carried out. 10 l of the generated viral cDNA or fungal genomic DNA was added to 25 l Applied Biosystem\u2019s TaqManTM Universal PCR Master Mix. qPCR was performed in parallel using either serial 10fold dilutions of cDNA generated from nonaerosolized FluMist\u00ae containing approximately 107 TCID50 per influenza strain. measurements were taken at 5, 10, 20, and 40 minutes. Proc Mixed was used to analyze data for significance. results were considered significant if P 0.05. the PTFE filter was found to be optimal for the recovery of viral particles. three identical experiments were performed for viral aerosols collected at 5, 10, 20 and 40 minutes. qPCR and spore counts confirmed that stage T1 retained 96% of the A. versicolor spores while stage T2, with 2% of the spores, contained the greatest amount of viral particles (48%). fewer viral particles were detected on the backup filter F (10%) in comparison with the backup filter F using FluMist\u00ae alone (38%). Tube 1 5451 2078* 7169 3100* 9760 7596* 25 624 7329 Tube 2 8647 2861* 14 345 3983* 24 970 6314* 42 962 14 161 Backup filter 7576 1869* 13 924 2530* 26 286 11 716* 43 412 7507* Reference filter n/a n/a n/a n/a 115.5% 110.9% H3N2. we were unable to generate a reproducible signal for the B strain virus. standard curves were used to extrapolate relative viral or spore numbers in unknown samples. qPCR and spore counts confirmed that stage T1 retained 96% of the A. versicolor spores while stage T2, with 2% of the spores, contained the greatest amount of viral particles (48%). fewer viral particles were detected on the backup filter F (10%). filter F using FluMist\u00ae alone (38%), suggesting some interaction or aggregation of the particles during aerosolization. Spore counts were the average of eight replicate hemacytometer counts. the need for rapid and accurate methods for detecting airborne viruses has increased in recent years, particularly following the reported outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) and SARS. 7, 14, 15, 16 Using the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler, we were able to overcome some common viral particle sampling limitations. qPCR results of aerosolized viral samples collected at 5, 10, 20 and 40 minutes confirm that a sampling time of 40 minutes yields the highest quantity of viral particles. however, this does not necessarily represent an ideal environmental sampling time as the quantities of aerosolized influenza virus expelled from patients have not yet been evaluated. qPCR detection was successful for both strains H1N1 and H3N2. this may not be due to the presence of inhibitors in the reaction. but instead is more likely due to poor primer or probe design or the presence of secondary structures in the influenza B RNA. if aerosolized influenza particles are a significant contributor to influenza transmission in work environments and the community remains to be determined. future experiments will focus on studying the dissemination of viralladen aerosols using an artificial cough generator to simulate cough dispersal of influenza viruses.
