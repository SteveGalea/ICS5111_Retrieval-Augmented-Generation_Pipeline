{"summary": "microbial resistance to toxic molecules occurred long before the modern era of antibiotics. many antibiotic resistance plasmids isolated in the 1950s carried genes for resistance to salts of arsenic and mercury. there is also a real possibility that genetically determined resistance was spread during the intense pollution. resistance to sulfonamide drugs and trimethoprim can occur by mutations in the target pathways or by inheritance of plasmids carrying altered, drug-insensitive variants of the target enzymes. it is often forgotten that Bacillus strains were studied early on and found to produce some of the first bioactive molecules. antibiotic resistance in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the sole source of resistance to anti-TB drugs is by mutation of the target genes. no transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids have been found to encode resistance in Mtb. resistance to fluoroquinolones is common in Gram-negative pathogens. antibiotic resistomes are conglomerations of putative resistance genes. the presence of natural resistomes appears to have no causal relationship with the use of antibiotics. resistance transfer factors (R-plasmids) appeared on the environmental/clinical scene in the 1950s. there seems to be endless diversity with rampant gene transfer occurring within related groups of microbes and plasmids that are but one of the transfer mechanisms. some recent studies of plasmids with strictly environmental roles show that they can be rapidly assembled and disseminated. antimicrobial production residues should never have been used in agriculture and as food supplements for animals and fish. the effects of the worldwide commercial (not-health-related) use of antibiotics are now irreversible. antibiotics should not have been used in agriculture and as food supplements. the impact of this \u201cmisuse\u201d on the advancement of biological science has been enormous and has led, and will lead, to future advances in medicine and biotechnology. the only solution is to generate collections of truly novel antibiotics with a narrow spectrum of action that can be combined with synthetic inhibitors of AR function."}
