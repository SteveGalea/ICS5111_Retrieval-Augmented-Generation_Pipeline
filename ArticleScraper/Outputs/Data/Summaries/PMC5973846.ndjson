{"summary": "Objective Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children and adults. we aim to assess the factors associated with changes in the incidence of and indications for AT using population-level data. the variation in adenotonsillectomy rates across different countries may be explained in part by the different cultural attitudes toward the protective role of these lymphoepithelial structures. a 22-year nationwide cohort showed a significant decrease in the incidence of tonsillectomy over time [12]. the surgical rate of pediatric AT varies notably among different countries [21\u201323] because of the high accessibility of medical resources when throat infections occur and the cultural acceptability of antibiotic treatment for upper respiratory tract infections. most parents are concerned about the effects of tonsil removal on the immune system. patients who underwent an adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy were excluded. the index date was defined as the time that the tonsillectomy or AT was performed. top three diagnoses were categorized into either infectious or inflammatory indications. pharyngitis and nasopharyngitis 463 acute tonsillitis 462 acute pharyngitis 461 acute sinusitis 382 acute suppurative otitis media 289 other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs 41 alcoholism in family 39 liveborn unspecified whether single twin or multiple born in hospital UAO 780.53 (55%) hypersomnia with sleep apnea, unspecified 786 (15%) symptoms 229 benign neoplasm of unspecified site 235 neoplasm of uncertain behavior of digestive and respiratory systems 238 neoplasm of uncertain behavior of other and unspecified sites and tissues 527 diseases of the salivary glands 528 diseases of the oral soft tissues excluding lesions specific for gingiva and tongue ICD-9-CM: International classification of diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. the significance was set at a two-sided p 0.05. the study was conducted using data from the national health insurance research database. the NHI commenced in 1995 and covers over 99% of the population in Taiwan. the leading ICD-9-CM codes for the indications of RICI, UAO, and Tumor were 474, 780, and 146. table 1 shows the complete list of ICD-9-CM codes (top three diagnoses) in these categories of surgical indications. secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes of head, face, and neck 210 (11.7%)benign neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx 239 neoplasm of unspecified nature 141 malignant neoplasm of tongue 202 other malignant neoplasms of lymphoid and histiocytic tissue 145 malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified parts of a total of 1,892 ATs were performed between 1997 and 2010. the average annual incidence of AT was 14.7 per 100,000 individuals. patients aged 18 years formed 48.2% of the total AT population. tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy is most often performed in patients of 5\u201311 y/o (415/697, 59.5%) only two patients (2/1892, 0.1%) underwent AT on an outpatient basis. mean hospital stay of AT patients was 3.7 2.9 days (median, three days) the incidence of adenotonsillectomies per one million population by the calendar year fluctuates. Figs 2A and 3A illustrate the incidence and stacked percentage of the three categories of surgical indications for AT by the calendar year in the total study population. in the adult subgroup, the incidence and proportion of AT performed for RICI decreased from 46 (78%) in 1997 to 32 (50%) in 2010. incidence and percentage of UAO surged between 2001 and 2006 and decreased markedly after 2006, showing a weak increasing trend (y = 0.4835x \u2013 946.73, p = 0.609) y = 0.4703x \u2013 897.02, p = 0.486 and y = 1.7209x \u2013 3429.4, p = 0.002 respectively. male patients had a higher overall AT rate and were more likely to undergo AT with the indications of UAO and Tumor. female patients were more liable to undergo surgery with the indication of RICI. 73.7% of the patients in this age category underwent surgery due to UAOs. only 2% of these patients received surgery because of a suspected or confirmed neoplasm. proportion of infectious indications increased dramatically in the >40 years age group (28.1%) most of the ATs were performed in the medical centers and regional hospitals. infection was the most frequent cause of surgery at all hospital levels. the distribution of surgical indications across the hospital level was significantly different. the proportion in the 5\u201311 years of age had a higher incidence of AT due to UAO after 2006. the incidence in the 18\u201340 and >40 years group decreased after 2000. the incidence of patients with RICI for AT shifted from medical centers to regional hospitals during the study period. 0.001a Male 236 (42.8) 210 (68.2) 99 (71.7) Age mean SD 35.4 13.0 37.6 11.9 50.7 12.0 0.0001b Hospital level Medical centers 305 (55.4) 159 (51.6) 78 (56.5) 0.0001a Regional hospitals 187 (33.9) 135 (43.8) 57 (41.3) Local hospitals 59 (10.7) 14 (4.5) 3 (2.2) Insured residence areasc Taipei D (36.6)d 249 (46 0.0001a Regional hospitals 269 (42.4) 73 (28.4) Local hospitals 42 (6.6) 24 (9.3) Insured residence areasc Taipei D (36.6)d 280 (44.4) 100 (39.2) 0.492a Northern D (14.0)d 65 (10.3) 30 (11.8) Central D (18.4)d 143 (22.7) 70 (27.5) Southern D (13.9)d 83 (13.2) 32 (12.5) Kaoping D (14.8)d 46 (7.3) 15 (5 adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. solitary tonsillectomy as a treatment for adult SDB patients may have a limited effect. ambulatory AT procedures in children have nearly doubled over the past decade in the united states. only 3% of tonsillectomies performed in an inpatient setting. parents often choose nonsurgical treatment options because of anecdotal reports. the surgical indications for tonsillar neoplasm increased substantially from 1997 to 2010, especially after 2006. a possible reason for this trend was the implementation of free oral and pharyngeal mucosal screening among high-risk groups. by the end of this national cancer prevention and control project, 1440,000 high-risk candidates (aged 18 or above) had been screened. this study included a homogeneous population of Chinese patients in Taiwan. the generalizability of our results to other ethnic populations may be limited. a complete dataset from the entire population would allow for more accurate trend analysis and prediction. multinomial logistic regression contributors for different surgical indications."}
