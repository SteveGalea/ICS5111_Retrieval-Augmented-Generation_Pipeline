{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. a total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. about 77 % of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80 % of the participants. hand washing between 30 s to a minute was protective factors against diarrhoea. this observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences."}
