{"summary": "current diagnostic methods used in cases of infectious encephalitis successfully identify a specific microbiologic cause of the disease in 40% of cases. recent work suggests that a larger number of cases actually have an infectious etiology but are misdiagnosed. seven encephalitis cases and fourteen normal brain controls were sequenced and evaluated for the presence of viral sequences. a pathogen was possible in each of the five samples that had a known or strongly suspected infectious etiology. no pathogen was identified in the two samples without a suspected infectious etiology. samples were reverse transcribed and prepared with the Illumina TruSeq kit. to ensure inclusion of possible RNA genomes, oligo dT selection was not performed. the sequence data sets were then screened for quality. the NRVDB was derived from 1,296,974 viral sequences in the GenBank database. it includes 579,282 unique viral sequence records of 31 to 1.2 million bp in length, representing 2480 different viral taxa. sequences were assembled using SSAKE from reads that aligned to sequences in each taxon of interest. alignments and contigs were then manually examined to determine if they represented human sequence within the taxon-specific database. RNA and DNA were re-extracted from the encephalitis and control brain samples. a random double stranded cDNA amplicon library was generated using a modified (Document S1) round A/B protocol. the resulting Round B library was used, undiluted, as the measles positive control. samples were reverse transcribed and prepared with the Illumina TruSeq kit. to ensure the inclusion of possible RNA genomes, oligo dT selection was not performed. rRNA selection was also not performed. the NRVDB was derived from 1,296,974 viral sequences in the GenBank database. it includes 579,282 unique viral sequence records of 31 to 1.2 million bp in length. the use of this database reduces redundant hits resulting from overrepresented taxa. RNA and DNA were re-extracted from the encephalitis and control brain samples in preparation for VZV- and HSV-specific PCR and measles-specific RT-PCR. RNA and DNA were re-extracted from the encephalitis and control brain samples. measles virus RNA was extracted from one full dose of the vaccine. a random double stranded cDNA amplicon library was generated using a modified (Document S1) round A/B protocol.

PCR with validated diagnostic primers also failed to confirm the presence of VZV in sample 924. the deep sequencing of sample 924 did indicate the presence of HSV1. a product of the expected size (800 bp, data not shown) was obtained using methods previously described. 199,666 to 907,362 screened reads in the encephalitis samples. 216,651 to 2,342,726 (mean SD = 944,680679,117) in the control samples. transcriptome, human genome, internal sequencing control and human ribosomal sequences are removed from the set of HQ reads. transcriptome, human genome, internal sequencing control and human ribosomal sequences are removed from the set of HQ reads to yield Screened Reads. % GI covered longest contig (bp) 710 Bovine viral diarrhea virus 3 3 0 390189256 0.01 0 710 Meleagrid herpesvirus 1 72 0 12025107 0.19 0 710 Human herpesvirus 1 0 10 290766003 0.13 78 1418 Hepatitis E Virus 20 0 319748765 0.87 0 1418 ORF Virus 1 0 325073632 0.01 0 924 giosum virus 1 0 9628932 0.01 0 4403 Monkeypox virus 12 0 68449479 0.02 0 4471 Human herpesvirus 6 540 0 9633069 0.74 0 4471 Monkeypox virus 18 0 68449479 0.02 0 Co-A Canine distemper virus 2 0 5733642 0.01 0 Co-A Cetacean morbillivirus 2 0 38707562 taxon-specific follow-up Assembly of reads aligned to taxon-specific follow-up databases resulted in apparently viral contigs ranging from 66 to 4019 bp long in 5 of the 7 encephalitis samples. deep sequencing analysis indicated the presence of the measles virus (MV) this was confirmed by specific PCR (Figure 2). further, the depth of sequencing coverage in Co-A and Co-B was sufficient to identify mutations in the genomes of each MV strain known to be present in SSPE-causing isolates. etiology None - - - No Pathogen Identified 4403 2006 HSV encephalitis, stroke HSV1 + - - Confirmed HSV Encephalitis 4471 2007 Rasmussen's encephalitis None - - - No Pathogen Identified In four of five cases, virus calls from the bioinformatic analysis of the deep sequencing data and the subsequent pathogen specific amplification were concordant with the prior clinical diagnoses study demonstrates the utility of using deep-sequencing to identify viral etiologies in encephalitis. validated PCR primers sometimes fail to amplify agents against which they have been validated. but diagnostic HSV primers failed to yield a product. study demonstrates the feasibility of using deep sequencing to identify viral causes of encephalitis."}
