{"summary": "enteroviruses are a large and diverse family of small (30-nm) nonenveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome. human pathogens are found among the EV-A to EV-L species and the three rhinovirus species. the best-known pathogenic enterovirus is poliovirus (PV), the causative agent of poliomyelitis. 2Apro cleaves at the junction between the structural proteins (P1 region) and its own N terminus. both proteases also cleave host cell factors to optimize virus replication. a well-known antiviral response is the induction of type I interferons. IFN-/ signals in autocrine and paracrine ways to induce a tissue-wide antiviral state. one of the ISGs is dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), a sensor protein of the integrated stress response (ISR). when PKR binds dsRNA ligands, it dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and subsequently phosphorylates the subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 ( enteroviruses suppress IRF3 dimerization and thereby, IFN-/ gene transcription. both viral proteases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, cleave various factors of the RLR signaling pathway, implicating them in the suppression of IFN-/ gene transcription. some studies reported that EV-A71 infection reduces expression levels of the IFN receptor, blocks STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, and suppresses expression of multiple ISGs through the action of 2Apro (31, 32). however, it was suggested that EV-A71 infection does not affect STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation but that 3Cpro prevents these molecules from entering the nucleus (33). recombinant EMCVs contained an intact antagonist of the antiviral responses, i.e., the leader (L) protein. these viruses could not be used to study the effect of the enterovirus proteases on IFN-/ mRNA levels and SG formation. small SGs were no longer detected at 6 hpi in cells infected with CV-B3 or CV-A21. the majority of cells infected with EV-A71 and EV-D68 also lacked SGs at 6 hpi. dsRNA staining was performed for the SG markers eIF3 and G3BP2. enterovirus 2Apro suppresses SG formation when introduced into recombinant EMCV containing an inactive stress antagonist. overexpression of enteroviral proteases, followed by sodium arsenite treatment, may not accurately represent the role of the proteases in an enterovirus-infected cell. CVs harboring 2Apro and 3Cpro of different enteroviruses upstream of the leader protein to study the proteolytic activity of 2Apro and 3Cpro. however, we could not use these viruses to study the effects of the enterovirus proteases on SG formation. EMCV actively suppresses SG formation in cardiovirus-infected cells (11, 41, 42) infection with EMCV-2Apro resulted in cleavage of eIF4G. infection with EMCV-3Cpro resulted in cleavage of eIF4G. no cleavage was observed in cells infected with either EMCV-LZn. immunofluorescence staining was performed for the SG markers eIF3 and G3BP2 and dsRNA to identify the infected cells. the number of SGs per cell was analyzed for at least 50 cells per condition. at 24 hpi, samples were frozen and subject to 3 freeze-thaw cycles. infection with EMCV-2Am did not induce small SGs at 4 hpi. it suppressed the formation of larger SGs at 8 hpi. this indicates that the catalytic activity of 2Apro is needed for both the induction of small SGs at 4 hpi and subsequent suppression of the formation of larger SGs. expression of 2Apro restores impaired replication of EMCV-LZn. EMCV-LZn replication in HeLa cells is predominantly restricted by the ISR. EMCV-LZn replication in HeLa cells is predominantly restricted by the ISR. enterovirus 2Apro does not affect PKR signaling. 2Apro depends on its catalytic activity to suppress SGs. 2Apro does not cleave known structural SG components like TIA-1. enterovirus 2Apro suppresses the induction of type I IFN gene transcription. infection of HeLa cells with EV-A71, CV-B3, CV-A21, or PV did not significantly induce the expression of IFN- mRNA at 8 h p.i. ovirus 2Apro suppresses type I IFN- gene expression in infected HeLa cells. cells were lysed at 8 hpi, total cellular RNA was isolated. RT-qPCR analysis was performed for IFN- and actin mRNA. infected (A to D) or EMCV-LZn-infected (E) cells (**, P 0.01; ****, P 0.0001) tested the effect of 2Apro and 3Cpro on JAK-STAT signaling. 3Cpro had no effect on the induction of IFN- gene transcription. PKR k.o. cells are both deficient in SG formation. one lacks the RNA binding domain (PKR RBD k.o. MEFs) and the other lacks the kinase domain (PKR KD k.o. MEFs) PKR k.o. and wt MEFs were infected with EMCV-LZn at an MOI of 10 and stained for the SG marker G3BP1. total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-qPCR analysis. to interfere with SG formation, we generated HeLa cells lacking expression of SG scaffolding protein G3BP1 and/or G3BP2 using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. to characterize our newly generated cell lines, we determined whether they form SGs upon infection with EMCV-LZn or addition of sodium arsenite. SG formation-deficient HeLa G3BP1/2 k.o. cells show only a small impairment in IFN- induction. RNA was isolated and RT-qPCR analysis was performed for IFN- induction. IFN- mRNA is depicted as the fold induction of IFN- mRNA levels compared to the levels in mock-infected cells. EMCV RNA is shown as the copy number per cell, calculated from a plasmid standard. the ability to counteract SG formation is conserved among all human enterovirus species (i.e., EV-A to EV-D) the ability to counteract SG formation is conserved among all human enterovirus species (i.e., EV-A to EV-D) enterovirus 2Apro suppresses SG formation when introduced into recombinant EMCV containing an inactive stress antagonist. overexpression of enteroviral proteases, followed by sodium arsenite treatment, may not accurately represent the role of the proteases in an enterovirus-infected cell. eIF4G, a well-known 2Apro target, resulted in cleavage of eIF4G. eIF4G, a well-known 2Apro target, resulted in cleavage of eIF4G. eIF4G, a well-known 2Apro target, resulted in cleavage of eIF4G. eIF4G, a well-known 2Apro target, was enterovirus 2Apro suppresses SG formation in EMCV-infected cells. the endogenous stress response antagonist (leader) was inactivated by the insertion of point mutations in its Zn finger domain (C19A/C22A) the genes encoding 2Apro and 3Cpro were introduced at the 5\u2032 end of the EMCV open reading frame. fluorescence staining was performed for EMCV, EMCV-LZn, EMCV-2Apro, or EMCV-3Cpro. at 24 hpi, samples were frozen and subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles. TCID50, 50% tissue culture infective dose. the catalytic activity of 2Apro is needed for both the induction of small SGs at 4 hpi and the subsequent suppression of the formation of larger SGs. this suggests that CV-B3 2Apro, rather than CV-B3 3Cpro, is the main antagonist of SG formation. we infected HeLa cells wild type (wt) for or deficient in PKR (PKR knockout [k.o.] at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and determined the virus yields at 24 hpi. we observed a strong defect in the replication of EMCV-LZn in wt cells but not in PKR k.o. cells. enterovirus 2Apro suppresses the induction of type I IFN gene transcription. enterovirus 2Apro suppresses the induction of type I IFNs. 2Apro and 3Cpro can cleave proteins in the RLR signaling pathway. EMCV-LZn failed to suppress the RLR signaling pathway. infection with EMCV-2Apro hardly induced IFN- mRNA levels. infection with EMCV-2Am resulted in high IFN- mRNA levels. cells were infected with EMCV-LZn encoding the 2Apro or 3Cpro of EV-A71, CV-B3, CV-A21, or EV-D68 at an MOI of 10. cells were lysed at 8 hpi, total cellular RNA was isolated. RT-qPCR analysis was performed for IFN-, ISG56, MDA5 and actin mRNA. 2Apro of these different enteroviruses suppressed IFN- gene expression in the context of EMCV, while 3Cpro did not. 2Apro of these different enteroviruses suppressed IFN- gene expression in the context of EMCV, while 3Cpro did not. the PKR RBD k.o. cells fail to induce IFN expression (10), we previously observed only a 5- to 10-fold reduction in IFN- mRNA levels in PKR KD k.o. MEFs (11) to better understand these different results, we compared both types of PKR k.o. MEFs side by side. PKR has been suggested to play a role in the MDA5 signaling pathway (49) PKR k.o. and wt MEFs were infected with EMCV-LZn at an MOI of 10. total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-qPCR analysis. EMCV RNA is shown as the copy number per cell, calculated from a plasmid standard. 3BP1 and G3BP2 needed to be simultaneously depleted (G3BP1/2 k.o.) to prevent SG formation. infection with EMCV-LZn resulted in the phosphorylation of PKR in all cell lines, indicating that the signaling pathway was not affected. o., G3BP2 k.o., and G3BP1/2 k.o. cells were infected with EMCV-LZn at an MOI of 10 or incubated with 500 M sodium arsenite (NaArs) cells were fixed at 8 hpi or 30 min after addition of sodium arsenite. SGs were visualized by immunofluorescence staining for G3BP1, eIF3 and G3BP2 enterovirus 2Apro and enterovirus 3Cpro suppress both SG formation and the induction of IFN-/. EV-A71, CV-B3, CV-A21, and EV-D68 suppress SG formation and IFN- gene transcription in infected cells. cleavage-resistant G3BP1 (G3BP1Q326E) led to an increase in the number of SGs (34, 35) and a small reduction in viral titers (34). enterovirus 3Cpro had an effect on SG formation, but 2Apro had a much stronger inhibitory effect on the number of SGs. 2Apro can inhibit arsenite-induced SG formation. this is triggered via activation of another eIF2 kinase. this suggests that 2Apro targets SG assembly. cleavage of eIF4G impairs recruitment of 40S ribosomes to mRNAs. 3Cpro, when overexpressed, cleaves MAVS and suppresses IFN-/ induction. but we showed that 3Cpro failed to cleave MAVS (21) by infecting cells with EMCV-LZn encoding 2Apro or 3Cpro. enterovirus 2Apro suppresses the induction of IFN-/ gene transcription in other cell types. PKR KD k.o. MEFs and G3BP1/2 k.o. cells showed a 5- to 10-fold reduction in IFN- gene transcription. suppression of SG formation by 2Apro is the major contributing factor in the viral suppression of IFN- gene transcription. poliovirus 1 Sabin reference strain was obtained from the NIBSC. all enteroviruses were passed on HeLa R19 cells and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. the 3Cpro genes were ligated into the pcDNA-GFP vector. the 2Apro genes were ligated into the pIRES-EGFP-MCS plasmid. anti-dsRNA (English & Scientific Consulting), anti-G3BP1 (Aviva Systems Biology), anti-eIF3 (Santa Cruz), and anti-TIA-1 (Santa Cruz) were used for detection. the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min.
