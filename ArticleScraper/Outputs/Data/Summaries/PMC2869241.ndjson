{"summary": "extracts and constituents of Andrographis paniculate exhibit broad pharmacological activities, such as anti-bacterial, ant-malarial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, immunological regulation, and hepatoprotective effects. -glucosidase is a key enzyme in the absorption of sugar in the small intestine mucous membrane. 2D and 3D QSAR models were constructed to describe the important fragments in andrographolide derivatives. the combination of 2D and 3D QSAR models could better summarize the QSAR of andrographolide derivatives in inhibiting -glucosidase. the best 2D-QSAR model was applied by the criterion of cross-validation R2. the test set\u2019s biological activity was predicted by the best 2D-QSAR model. the most common structure (MCS) could be calculated by HQSAR. coMFA and CoMSIA were both used to generate 3D-QSAR models. then the relative higher predictive 3D-QSAR models were selected by comparison. the selected models were further optimized by the Focusing method. cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and partial least squares (PLS) should be possible to predict the activity of a molecule from its fingerprint. the best 2D-QSAR model was applied by the criterion of cross-validation R2. CoMFA and CoMSIA were both used to generate 3D-QSAR models. then the relative higher predictive 3D-QSAR models were selected by comparison. the selected models were further optimized by the Focusing method. the distribution pattern of the 25 andrographolide derivatives is shown in Figure 2. eighteen compounds were selected as the raining set by the MDC method. the rest of them were used as the test set whose biological activities were covered by the training set. 3.983 3.924 0.059 16 3.921 3.961 0.040 17 3.996 3.954 0.042 18 3.971 3.902 0.069 19 4.553 4.686 0.133 20 4.796 4.813 0.017 21 5.222 4.806 0.416 22 4.854 4.798 0.056 23 4.602 4.715 0.113 24 4.444 4.745 0.301 25 4.959 4.698 0.261. four models (4, 8, 10 and 11) had top four predictabilities, so the Focus method was applied to optimize these models. model 16 also provided the best prediction with a correlation coefficient R2 (0.941) 0.297 0.498 14.876 6 A 1 0.724 0.184 0.807 62.902 7 S+E 1 0.732 0.182 0.812 64.778 8 CoMSIA S+H 1 0.774 0.148 0.875 105.050 9 S+A 2 0.738 0.159 0.866 45.251 10 S+E+H 1 0.755 0.169 0.838 77.788 11 S+H+A 2 0.759 0.130 0.910 70.509 12 model 16 used steric field, hydrophobic field and H-acceptor field together to describe the relationship between activities and structures of andrographolide derivatives. atoms and groups in the region marked by yellow lines impaired the activities. the compounds with structures fitting well into the 3D contour maps derived from the model 16 usually exhibited potent inhibitory activity. weak inhibitors such as compounds 3, 4, 13 and 16 did not have a good fit to the 3D contour maps. PCA was applied to select a training set from among 25 andrographolide derivatives. it is a statistical technique useful for summarizing all the information encoded in the structures of compounds. eighteen compounds were selected as the raining set by the MDC method. 3.933 0.067 2 4.000 3.995 0.05 3 3.959 3.876 0.109 4 3.959 4.054 0.095 5 - - -d 6 4.237 4.139 0.098 7 4.237 4.159 0.078 8 4.076 4.087 0.011 9 4.155 4.061 0.094 10 4.000 4.099 0.099 11 - - -d 13 3.959 4.176 0.217 14 4.000 3.946 0.054 CoMFA and CoMSIA were used to develop a number of QSAR models based on properties of compounds belonging to different fields. the model\u2019s predictability was the criterion to judge which QSAR model was the best. four models (4, 8, 10 and 11) had top four predictabilities. no.
