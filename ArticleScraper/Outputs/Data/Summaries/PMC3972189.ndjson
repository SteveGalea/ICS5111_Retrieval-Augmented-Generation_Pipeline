{"summary": "soluble angiotensin converting Enzyme-2 (sACE2) appears to be biomarker in heart failure, and in hypertension, where heart failure may be imminent. soluble angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were lower in the diseased populations, but did not show a strong correlation with echocardiographic parameters. sACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase generating Ang-(1\u20139) from Ang-I. Ang-(1\u20137) is a biologically active metabolite of the RAS acting through the G-protein-coupled Mas receptor. sACE2 is expressed in various cell types including fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. expression and activity of sACE2 in human hypertension has not been addressed directly yet. targeted disruption of sACE2 in mice results in severe cardiac contractility defect, increased plasma and heart AngII levels leading to cardiac dysfunction. absence of sACE2 causes stress activation of the myocardial NADPH oxidase system. sACE2 activity was measured in hypertensive patients for the first time. sACE2 was identified as a biomarker of imminent heart failure. deterioration of cardiac performance is expected. a third group of 100 patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with indication of cardiac resynchronization therapy (heart failure, HF) were also enrolled into the study (HF - CRT before) cardiovascular risk assessment included age, sex, hypertension, hypercholesterinaemia, diabetes mellitus or ischaemic cardiomyopathy. independent clinicians who were not aware of echocardiographic data were not aware of echocardiographic data. sACE2 activity was measured by fluorometric assay of the enzymatic cleavage of K(Dnp) from the fluorogenic substrate Mca-APK(Dnp) all chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) if not stated otherwise. assay was tested by the specific human sACE2 inhibitor DX600. the reaction mixture contained 50 L of serum, 0.5 mM FAPGG (N-[3-(2-Furyl)acryloyl]-L-phenylalalaline (FAP) and glycylglycine (GG) one unit (U) represents 1 nmol of FAPGG hydrolysis per minute at 37 \u00b0C. ACE concentration was determined using a human ACE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) development system. ACE concentration was measured at least three times to achieve a standard deviation of at least 15%. NT-proBNP levels were measured in serum using a commercially available kit. unpaired echocardiographic values were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (two tails, panel A\u2013C and dP/dt, panel D) significant differences are labeled by asterisks (** P0.001). sACE2 activity was plotted as a function of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) in healthy people (healthy, n = 45, panel A), in patients with preserved EF (hypertensive, n = 239, panel B) and in patients with severe reduction in EF (HF \u2013 CRT before, n = 65, panel C) n = 45, panel A, hypertensive, n = 239, panel B, HF - CRT before, n = 100, panel C, HF - CRT after, n = 65, panel D) each dot represents values of individual patients in these plots. points were fitted by linear regression. study populations Written informed consent has been obtained from the patients. all clinical investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. a third group of 100 patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with indication of cardiac resynchronization therapy (heart failure, HF) were also enrolled into the study (HF - CRT before) echocardiography was performed using an Accuson Sequoia (Siemens AG, Germany) echocardiograph. the left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by M mode left ventricular dimensional method. preserved EF cutoff was >50%. all chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) if not stated otherwise. the reaction was performed in black 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhauser, Germany) reaction mixture (200 L) contained 50 L of serum, 0.5 mM FAPGG (N-[3-(2-Furyl)acryloyl]-L-phenylalanyl-glycine) substrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 25 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) at 37C\u00b0. serum samples were diluted 100-fold in the same buffer (10 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin in DPBS) the remaining binding sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 10 mg/mL, dissolved in DPBS. ACE concentration was measured at least three times to achieve a standard deviation of at least 15%. unpaired echocardiographic values were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (two tails, panel A\u2013C) with these nonparametric tests there is a difference between hypertensive and healthy patients groups. bars are mean S.E.M. Significant differences are labeled by asterisks. differences in biochemical parameters were addressed by parametric ANOVA tests. linear regression analysis was performed to compare serum ACE concentration with echocardiographic parameters and NT-proBNP levels. P0.05 was considered statistically significant for all comparisons. each dot represents values of individual patients in these plots. the value P indicates the level of significance of the positive correlation between the plotted parameters, while r represents a measure of the goodness of the fit. patients with mild (NYHA II) to severe heart failure (NYHA III\u2013IV) matched ECG and echocardiographic criteria for biventricular pacemaker implantation. the mean EF in the CRT group was seriously reduced (Table 1) with enlarged end-systolic (ESD, Table 1) and end-diastolic (EDD, Table 1) diameters. sACE2 activity positively correlates with the clinical status of systolic heart failure patients. sACE2 activity was present in CRT patients before pacemaker implantation (HF \u2013 CRT before) compared to healthy people and to the hypertensive patients with preserved left ventricular EF. sACE2 activity strongly correlated with the clinical condition of patients with severe heart failure. sACE2 activity correlates with hypertension and with the deterioration of left ventricular systolic function Serum ACE2 activity correlated with the clinical status of HF. sACE2 activity was higher in hypertensive patients compared to healthy individuals. ACE2 activity was determined in healthy people (healthy, n = 45, filled bar), patients with preserved ejection fraction (hypertensive, n = 239, grey bar) and in patients with severe heart failure before (HF \u2013 CRT before) and after (HF \u2013 CRT after) cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT, n = 65, open bars, panel A) significant differences between values are labeled by asterisks (** P0.001). serum ACE2 activity positively correlated to NT-proBNP levels in HF patients before CRT (HF \u2013 CRT before: P0.01, r = 0.47, Figure 5D). correlation of serum ACE activity and concentration to left ventricular systolic function ACE activity of the cardiovascular patients were significantly lower than that in healthy individuals. the hypertensive group consisted of patients with mild (NYHA II) to severe heart failure (NYHA III\u2013IV) and matched ECG and echocardiographic criteria for biventricular pacemaker implantation. the mean EF in the CRT group was seriously reduced with enlarged end-systolic (ESD, Table 1) and end-diastolic (EDD, Table 1) diameters. sACE2 activity positively correlates with the clinical status of systolic heart failure patients. the positive correlation between sACE2 and NYHA classes remained unchanged after pacemaker implantation. sACE2 activity correlates with hypertension and with the deterioration of left ventricular systolic function Serum ACE2 activity correlated with the clinical status of HF. a clear positive correlation was found between serum ACE2 activities and ESD (Figure 3D) and EDD (Figure 3E) in HF patients. serum ACE2 activity was determined in healthy people (healthy, n = 45, filled bar) and in patients with severe heart failure before (HF \u2013 CRT before) and after (HF \u2013 CRT after) cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT, n = 65, open bars, panel A) significant differences between values are labeled by asterisks (** P0.001) sACE2 activity positively correlated to NT-proBNP levels in patients with normal left ventricular systolic function. correlation of serum ACE activity and concentration to left ventricular systolic function ACE activity was significantly lower than that in healthy individuals. hypertension leads to secondary cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, chronic nephropathy, neuropathy and many other severe pathologies. it is important to note that there are effective treatments for hypertension, making it a relatively easily manageable disease. however, there is no cure for it, which is probably related to the issue. this is the first time increased sACE2 activity was shown in hypertension in human. previous animal data have shown that transgenic sACE2 overexpression in the vessels of SHRSP rats normalizes (reduces) high blood pressure [11]. genetic association studies have shown a strong association of sACE2 polymorphisms to hypertension in different human populations. changes in serum ACE2 activity were measured in severe heart failure. ACE2 activity negatively correlated with EF in patients with systolic HF. soluble ACE2 levels are independent predictors of a composite end-point. sACE2 shedding is stimulated by the tumor necrosis factor- convertase ADAM17. cleavage of membrane sACE2 may be due to up-regulation of protease. changes in local concentrations of AngII and Ang-(1\u20137) can significantly contribute to remodeling and to the deterioration of cardiac function. soluble ACE2 activity correlated well with the improvement of cardiac function after implantation of a biventricular pacing device (CRT) soluble ACE concentration was lower before pacemaker implantation than in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension with preserved ejection fraction and it increased in parallel with the improvement of cardiac function. soluble ACE concentration decreases, while soluble ACE2 concentration increases in systolic HF suggesting an opposite change in the tissue located forms of these enzymes. it is not clear whether these changes are consequences of HF, or important contributors to the progression and reversion of the disease. Mca-APK(Dnp) hydrolysis was incubated with a single test human serum sample for 120 min in the presence of 0\u20133 M sACE2 inhibitor DX600. DX600 completely inhibited Mca-APK(Dnp) hydrolysis in a concentration dependent manner."}
