{"summary": "BRIL is part of an evolutionarily conserved family of so-called small interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins (2). there are at least four closely related members in humans. BRIL, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 are all clustered within 25 kb on chromosome 11 (in humans) expression of Bril is mostly restricted to osteoblasts (5), whereas other Ifitm genes are ubiquitous. the molecular mechanisms of BRIL action in osteoblasts, however, have yet to be uncovered. a mutation in the 5\u2032-UTR region of the BRIL gene is the cause of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)3 type V (12, 25) the mutation found (c.14CT) creates a novel in frame ATG upstream of the natural coding start of BRIL, resulting in an extension of 5 residues (MALEP) at its N terminus. this single recurrent mutation is present in 42 individuals with type V OI (27) HEK293, UMR106, and MC3T3-E1 cells were grown in DMEM.

PCRs were loaded on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide. purified products were then ligated into pBluescriptKS having T/A overhangs. randomly selected colonies were picked for plasmid preparation. the highest regions of similarity were those covering the exons and intron. a very high region of identity was also observed on a short stretch upstream of exon 1 covering about 400 bp. further upstream, the sequence homology abruptly became very divergent and less likely to contain conserved regulatory elements. special interest was also the presence of elements matching the binding site for GLI, TCF/LEF, and two putative TATA boxes. other putative elements for ZFP354c, AP2 and RUNX2 were also variably found interspersed in rats, humans, and mice. length promoter constructs tested were highly active in UMR106 cells. progressive deletions from the 5\u2032-end of the promoter fragments indicated a significant loss of activity at 213 for rats. the activity further declined to background levels for the 82 and 53 fragments. a rat 283 bp end-labeled fragment was incubated or not (nude probe) with nuclear extracts prepared from wild type or HEK293 cells transiently transfected with an Sp1 expression plasmid. partial protection was also noticed on FP1 and FP2 using nuclear extracts from wild type HEK293 cells overexpressing Sp1. 1, FP2, and FP3 observed in Fig. 3A matched oligonucleotide sequences 61, 82, 142, and 160, respectively. the rat 265 bp probe was end-labeled with 32P and incubated in the absence of nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells. the DNA-protein complex was then digested with increasing amounts of DNase I. among 15 transcription factors tested, Sp1 had some of the strongest transactivating properties. three different isoforms of Sp3 (Sp3-L1 (residues 1\u2013781), Sp3-L2 (residues 69\u2013781), and Sp3-S were also tested. Luc constructs (100 ng) was co-transfected with 300 ng of each expression plasmid encoding Sp1, Sp3-L1 (long form 1), Sp3-L2 (long form 2), Sp3-S (short form) and OSX. results are presented as -fold increase relative to negative control plasmid encoding GFP. two point mutations in the Sp1 elements abolished binding activity. co-transfection experiments were performed in HEK293 cells. deletion of the proximal TATA (-pTATA) caused a 67% decrease in base-line activity. BRIL Luc constructs (100 ng) were co-transfected with either GFP or Sp1 expression plasmids (300 ng) in HEK293 cells. Luc activity was assayed 48 h later and plotted relative to the activity of the promoter. a plasmid ratio of ZFP354C/Sp1 as low as 1:6 (25 ng/150 ng) significantly reduced the induction by 25%. expression of Zfp354C measured by RT-qPCR was 60-fold greater in cells not expressing endogenous Bril (HEK293 and NIH3T3) relative to those expressing it. the amount of co-transfected plasmid was kept constant at 300 ng with GFP alone (300 ng) the values represent the -fold increase relative to co-transfection with GFP alone (300 ng) the consensus binding site for GLI has a core of 10 nucleotides (GACCACCCACNNNG) the human site is an almost perfect match to the high affinity consensus except for a single base change at the last position of the core. the human site is an almost perfect match to the high affinity consensus except for a single base change at the last position of the core. c, MC3T3 cells were co-transfected with the human 1434 bp promoter Luc construct (100 ng) with 300 ng of plasmids encoding GFP, GLI1, or GLI3. Luc activity was measured 15, 25, and 42 h post-transfection and expressed as -fold increase relative to a co-transfection with GFP. MC3T3 cells were grown to confluence (day 0) and incubated in differentiating media in the absence or presence of PMP. MC3T3 continuously treated with 1 m PMP had an accelerated mineralization, as determined by alizarin red staining. alizarin red staining increased at day 7 and continued to increase at day 10. western blotting also revealed markedly increased levels of BRIL from day 4 onward. effects of PMP on BRIL at day 4 was also concentration-dependent. the expression of MC3T3 was up-regulated 2-, 29-, 33-, and 17-fold at day 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. by day 10, Bril expression had returned to control levels. expression of osteopontin (Ssp1) and osteocalcin (Ocn) were mostly unaffected at the early time points (days 1\u20134) but increased significantly at days 7 and 10. MC3T3 cells were grown in the absence () or presence () of 1 m PMP for up to 10 days. total RNA was extracted after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 days. values were computed using the threshold cycle method after normalization to 18S and expressed as 2Ct. BRIL labeling was observed on osteoblasts at the bony collar (Fig. 10B, arrows), in the primary ossification center (Fig. 10B, asterisks), and in the perichondrium adjacent to the layers of prehyperthrophic and hyperthrophic chondrocytes. BRIL staining of calvarial osteoblasts did not reveal a significant difference between the WT and the KO. a 408-bp segment of the mouse Bril gene covering 240 to +166 relative to the ATG contains 12 CpG dinucleotides that are susceptible to be methylated. in control cells, all CpG sites were methylated except for 13 (filled squares), representing only 12 independent clones out of 36. in non-expressing HEK293 cells, the human BRIL gene promoter-Luc plasmid was treated or not in vitro with the methylated plasmid became resistant to restriction at CCGG sites by HpaII. both the base-line and Sp1-induced activities of the methylated promoter were reduced down to less than 10%. Activation of the Bril gene is correlated with extensive CpG demethylation in MC3T3 cells. the genomic sequences were analyzed in silico using the ECR Browser. the highest regions of similarity were those covering the exons and intron. a very high region of identity was also observed on a short stretch upstream of exon 1 covering about 400 bp. another highly conserved region covering about 70 bp was also identified in the 3\u2032-intergenic region. GC content (70%) feature of this region being annotated as a CpG island in the human BRIL gene. other putative elements for ZFP354c, AP2 and RUNX2 were also found interspersed in rats, humans, and mice. the activities of all full-length promoter constructs tested were highly active in UMR106 cells (300,000 relative light units) as compared with the empty pGL3-basic plasmid. progressive deletions from the 5\u2032-end of the promoter fragments indicated a significant loss of activity at 213 for rats. promoterless pGL3-basic was used as a negative control. results shown are mean S.E. (error bars) (n = 4) tide having two mutated bases (Fig. 3, mSp1) did not bind Sp1. footprints FP1, FP2, and FP3 observed in Fig. 3A matched oligonucleotide sequences 61, 82, 142, and 160 respectively. bp Luc reporter could activate the human 1434 bp Luc reporter in HEK293 and MC3T3 cells. among 15 transcription factors tested, Sp1 had some of the strongest transactivating properties. the effects of combinations of Sp1 with other Sp members on the activity of the human BRIL promoter were also tested. Luc constructs (100 ng) was co-transfected with 300 ng of each expression plasmid encoding Sp1, Sp3-L1 (long form 1), Sp3-L2 (long form 2), Sp3-S (short form) and OSX. Luc activity was measured 48 h after transfection into MC3T3 osteoblasts (A) or HEK293 (B and C) we introduced either internal deletions in the putative TATA boxes or two point mutations in the Sp1 elements that abolished binding activity. co-transfection experiments were performed in HEK293 cells to assess the base-line (with GFP) and stimulated (with Sp1) activity of the human 452 promoter, which retains full activity compared with the 1434 bp promoter. deletions and point mutations were introduced in each of the two putative TATA boxes. the four elements were co-transfected with either GFP or Sp1 expression plasmids. Luc activity was assayed 48 h later and plotted relative to the activity of the WT promoter. Zfp354C repressed the base-line activity in HEK293 cells down to 76%. in a co-transfection experiment in HEK293 cells, ZFP354C was also found to be a potent inhibitor of Sp1-mediated transactivation of the human 1434 bp promoter. a plasmid ratio of ZFP354C/Sp1 as low as 1:6 significantly reduced the induction by 25%. the amount of co-transfected plasmid was kept constant at 300 ng with GFP. the values represent the -fold increase relative to co-transfection with GFP alone (300 ng) the consensus binding site for GLI has a core of 10 nucleotides (GACCACCCACNNNG) the human site is an almost perfect match to the high affinity consensus except for a single base change at the last position of the core (36, 37) the rat GLI site also is a perfect match except at the +4 G (GACCACCCACcagA) the functionality of the GLI site to the activity of the human promoter was tested by co-transfection experiments in MC c, MC3T3 cells were co-transfected with the human 1434 bp promoter Luc construct (100 ng) with 300 ng of plasmids encoding GFP, GLI1, or GLI3. Luc activity was measured 15, 25, and 42 h post-transfection and expressed as -fold increase relative to a co-transfection with GFP. MC3T3 transfected with GLI2 increased by 2.7-fold at 25 h. MC3T3 cells were grown to confluence (day 0) and incubated in differentiating media. PMP is a direct agonist of Smoothened (SMO) compared with control cells receiving DMSO only, PMP-treated cells showed almost maximal alizarin red staining at day 7 and continued to increase at day 10. Western blotting also revealed markedly increased levels of BRIL from day 2 onward. the effect of PMP on BRIL at day 4 was also concentration-dependent. expression of control and PMP-treated MC3T3 was up-regulated 2-, 29-, 33-, and 17-fold at day 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. by day 10, Bril expression had returned to control levels. expression of osteopontin (Ssp1) and osteocalcin (Ocn) were mostly unaffected at the early time points (days 1\u20134) but increased significantly at days 7 and 10. MC3T3 cells were grown in the absence () or presence () of 1 m PMP for up to 10 days. total RNA was extracted after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 days and used for RT-qPCR with selected Taqman probes. BRIL labeling was observed on osteoblasts at the forming bony collar (Fig. 10B, arrows), in the primary ossification center (Fig. 10B, asterisks), and in the perichondrium adjacent to the layers of prehyperthrophic and hyperthrophic chondrocytes. BRIL staining of calvarial osteoblasts did not reveal a significant difference between the WT and the KO. a 408-bp segment of the mouse Bril gene covering 240 to +166 relative to the ATG contains 12 CpG dinucleotides that are susceptible to be methylated. in control cells, all CpG sites were methylated except for 13 (filled squares), representing only 12 independent clones out of 36. in non-expressing HEK293 cells, the human BRIL gene promoter contains a bona fide CpG island, and all C pG methyltransferase enzyme M.SssI became resistant to restriction at CCGG sites by HpaII. when assayed by co-transfection in HEK293 cells, both the base-line and Sp1-induced activities of the methylated promoter were reduced to less than 10%. genome sequences were analyzed in silico using the ECR Browser. highest regions of similarity were those covering the exons and intron. a very high region of identity was also observed on a short stretch upstream of exon 1 covering about 400 bp. rich sequences are present within the proximal promoters of rats, humans, and mice. of special interest was also the presence of elements matching the binding site for GLI, TCF/LEF, and two putative TATA boxes. other putative elements for ZFP354c, AP2 and RUNX2 were also variably found interspersed in rats, humans, and mice. the activities of all full-length promoter constructs tested were highly active in UMR106 cells. progressive deletions from the 5\u2032-end of the promoter fragments indicated a significant loss of activity at 213 for rats and at 134 for humans. a rat 283 bp end-labeled fragment was incubated or not (nude probe) with nuclear extracts prepared from wild type or HEK293 cells. oligonucleotides containing GC-rich elements were incubated with nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells overexpressing Sp1. the mutant oligonucleotide having two mutated bases (Fig. 3, mSp1) did not bind Sp1. footprints FP1, FP2, and FP3 observed in Fig. 3A matched oligonucleotide sequences 61, 82, 142, and 160. activate the Bril Promoters in Vivo A co-transfection assay was performed to screen a selected set of transcription factors that could activate the human 1434 bp Luc reporter in HEK293 and MC3T3 cells. among 15 transcription factors tested, Sp1 had some of the strongest transactivating properties. three different isoforms of Sp3 (Sp3-L1 (residues 1\u2013781), Sp3-L2 (residue the effects of combinations of Sp1 with other Sp members on the activity of the human BRIL promoter were also tested in HEK293. first, doubling the amount of transfected Sp1 (from 150 to 300 ng) resulted in the promoter being 3.7-fold more active. second, co-transfection of Sp1 with Sp3-L1, Sp3-L2 and surprisingly Sp3-S or OSX also resulted in -fold inductions greater than simple BRIL promoter was selected for subsequent studies because of its higher responsiveness to transcriptional regulators, at least of the Sp family. we introduced either internal deletions in the putative TATA boxes or two point mutations in the Sp1 elements that abolished binding activity. deletions and point mutations were introduced in each of the two putative TATA boxes. the four BRIL-like elements were co-transfected with either GFP or Sp1 expression plasmids. Luc activity was assayed 48 h later and plotted relative to the activity of the promoter. Zfp354C represses basal and Sp1-induced transcriptional activity of the Bril promoters. expression of Zfp354C measured by RT-qPCR was 60-fold greater in cells not expressing endogenous Bril (HEK293 and NIH3T3) relative to those expressing it (UMR106) or committed to express it (MC3T3). the human 1434 bp promoter construct (100 ng) was co-transfected with a fixed amount of Sp1 (150 ng) and with increasing quantities (0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 ng) of ZFP354C. the values represent the -fold increase relative to co-transfection with GFP alone (300 ng) the consensus binding site for GLI has a core of 10 nucleotides (GACCACCCACNNNG) the human site is an almost perfect match to the high affinity consensus except for a single base change at the last position of the core. the human site is an almost perfect match to the high affinity consensus except for a single base change at the last position of the core. c, MC3T3 cells were co-transfected with the human 1434 bp promoter Luc construct (100 ng) with 150 ng each of plasmids encoding GFP, GLI1, or GLI3. Luc activity was measured 15, 25, and 42 h post-transfection and expressed as -fold increase relative to a co-transfection with GFP. bp promoter to GLI2 was significantly different in both the kinetics and magnitude of induction as compared with Sp1. the potency of GLI2 was greater than Sp1, with significant induction detected with only 50 ng of plasmid transfected, above those recorded at 15 and 25 h for Sp1. 3 continuously treated with 1 m PMP had an accelerated mineralization, as determined by alizarin red staining (Fig. 8A) compared with control cells receiving DMSO only, PMP-treated cells showed almost maximal alizarin red staining at day 7 and continued to increase at day 10. Western blotting also revealed markedly increased levels of BRIL from day 2 onward. gene expression signature of control and PMP-treated MC3T3 was investigated by qPCR. expression of Bril was up-regulated 2-, 29-, 33-, and 17-fold at day 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. expression of osteopontin (Ssp1) and osteocalcin (Ocn) were mostly unaffected at the early time points (days 1\u20134) but increased significantly at days 7 and 10. mef2C, and Tcf7 in non-treated MC3T3 cells increased steadily up to about days 7\u201310, in similar fashion to those of Bril. differentiating MC3T3 cells were grown in the absence () or presence (() of 1 m PMP for up to 10 days. total RNA was extracted after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 days and used for RT-qPCR. immunolabeling at E17.5 indicated a considerable reduction in the domain of cells expressing BRIL in the KO compared with the WT. BRIL labeling was observed on osteoblasts at the forming bony collar (Fig. 10B, arrows), in the primary ossification center (Fig. 10B, asterisks), and in the perichondrium adjacent to the layers of prehyperthrophic and hyperthrophic chondrocytes a 408-bp segment of the mouse Bril gene covering 240 to +166 relative to the ATG contains 12 CpG dinucleotides that are susceptible to be methylated. in control cells, all CpG sites were methylated except for 13 (filled squares), representing only 12 independent clones out of 36. in non-expressing HEK293 cells, the human BRIL gene promoter contains a bona fide CpG island, and all C methylation, the human 1434 bp promoter-Luc plasmid was treated or not in vitro with the CpG methyltransferase enzyme M.SssI. the methylated promoter became resistant to restriction at CCGG sites by HpaII. both the base-line and Sp1-induced activities of the methylated promoter were reduced to less than 10%. 1434 bp promoter plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells with either GFP or Sp1. Luc activity was measured 42 h later and normalized to the control GFP values. a very high region of identity was also observed on a short stretch upstream of exon 1 covering about 400 bp. at least four such GC-rich sequences are present within the proximal promoters of rats, humans, and mice. of special interest was also the presence of elements matching the binding site for GLI, TCF/LEF, and two putative TATA boxes. other putative elements for ZFP354c, AP2 and RUNX2 were also variably found interspersed in rats, humans, and mice. l gene transcription, genomic fragments for mice (3913), rats (1327), and humans (1434) were cloned in the pGL3-basic Luc reporter plasmid. the activities of all full-length promoter constructs tested were highly active in UMR106 cells (300,000 relative light units) activity resides within 265 bp (rat) and 199 bp (human), with complete loss of activity down to 82 bp. data represent relative Luc activity as compared with the 633 and 1434 bp for the rat and human constructs. mutant oligonucleotide having two mutated bases did not bind Sp1. footprints FP1, FP2, and FP3 observed in Fig. 3A matched oligonucleotide sequences 61, 82, 142, and 160, respectively. a co-transfection assay was performed to screen a selected set of transcription factors that could activate the human 1434 bp Luc reporter in HEK293 and MC3T3 cells. among 15 transcription factors tested, Sp1 had some of the strongest transactivating properties. three different isoforms of Sp3 (Sp3-L1 (residues 1\u2013781), Sp3-L2 (residues 69\u2013781), and the effects of combinations of Sp1 with other Sp members on the activity of the human BRIL promoter were also tested in HEK293. the effects of combinations of Sp1 with other Sp members on the activity of the promoter were also tested in HEK293 (>50%). human BRIL promoter was selected for subsequent studies because of its higher responsiveness to transcriptional regulators, at least of the Sp family. to abolish activity of the respective elements, we introduced either internal deletions in the putative TATA boxes or two point mutations in the Sp1 elements that abolished binding activity. deletions and point mutations were introduced in each of the two putative TATA boxes. the four BRIL-like elements were co-transfected with either GFP or Sp1 expression plasmids. Luc activity was assayed 48 h later and plotted relative to the activity of the WT promoter. Zfp354C represses basal and Sp1-induced transcriptional activity of the Bril promoters. expression of Zfp354C was 60-fold greater in cells not expressing endogenous Bril (HEK293 and NIH3T3) relative to those expressing it (UMR106) or committed to express it (MC3T3). the human 1434 bp promoter construct (100 ng) was co-transfected with a fixed amount of Sp1 (150 ng) the amount of co-transfected plasmid was kept constant at 300 ng with GFP. the values represent the -fold increase relative to co-transfection with GFP alone (300 ng) BRIL 3\u2032-UTR plasmid was still fully responsive to Sp1. a canonical binding site for the GLI transcription factors has a core of 10 nucleotides (GACCACCCACNNNG) the human site is an almost perfect match to the high affinity consensus except for a single base change at the last position of the core. the human BRIL promoter contains an element between 191 and 204 matching the GLI consensus binding site. the human 1434 bp promoter Luc construct (100 ng) was co-transfected in MC3T3 cells with increasing amounts of plasmid encoding GFP, GLI1, or GLI3. Luc activity was measured 15, 25, and 42 h post-transfection and expressed as -fold increase relative to a co-transfection with GFP. dose-response experiment was performed in MC3T3. activity of the human 1434 bp promoter to GLI2 was significantly different in both the kinetics and magnitude of induction as compared with Sp1. the potency of GLI2 was greater than Sp1, with significant induction detected with only 50 ng of plasmid transfected. MC3T3 continuously treated with 1 m PMP had an accelerated mineralization, as determined by alizarin red staining. compared with control cells receiving DMSO only, PMP-treated cells displayed almost maximal alizarin red staining at day 7 and continued to increase at day 10. Western blotting also revealed markedly increased levels of BRIL from day 2 onward. gene expression signature of control and PMP-treated MC3T3 was investigated in more detail by qPCR. expression of Bril was up-regulated 2-, 29-, 33-, and 17-fold at day 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. expression of osteopontin (Ssp1) and osteocalcin (Ocn) were mostly unaffected at early time points (days 1\u20134) but increased significantly at days 7 and 10. expression profiles for Gli2, Osx, Mef2C, and Tcf7 in non-treated cells increased steadily up to about days 7\u201310. these data suggest that PMP promoted gene expression of Bril. MC3T3 cells were grown in the absence () or presence () of 1 m PMP for up to 10 days. immunolabeling at E17.5 indicated a significant reduction in the domain of cells expressing BRIL in the KO compared with the WT. BRIL labeling was observed on osteoblasts at the forming bony collar (Fig. 10B, arrows), in the primary ossification center (Fig. 10B, asterisks), and in the perichondrium adjacent to the layers of prehyperthrophic and hyperthrophic chondrocytes ts indicate domain of BRIL immunolabeling; asterisks indicate primary ossification center; arrows point to bone collar; arrowheads show perichondrial osteoblasts. genome was isolated from MC3T3 cells 3 days after differentiation. a 408-bp segment of the mouse Bril gene covering 240 to +166 relative to the ATG contains 12 CpG dinucleotides. the human 1434 bp promoter-Luc plasmid was treated or not in vitro with the CpG methyltransferase enzyme M.SssI. when assayed by co-transfection in HEK293 cells, both the base-line and Sp1-induced activities of the methylated promoter were reduced down to less than 10%. the most proximal sequence contained within 250 bp was highly active in the three species after transfection in uMR106 osteosarcoma cells. the activity of the promoter was found to be dependent on the presence of the proximal TATA box (38) located just downstream of the transcriptional start sites. oligomers can synergistically transactivate at promoters containing multiple copies of its DNA binding element, through cooperative DNA binding. despite the presence of several functionally active Sp1 sites, OSX turned out to be totally inactive in HEK293 cells. co-immunoprecipitation indicated a physical interaction between OSX and Sp1 (57) the same could apply to RUNX2, which was inactive on Bril. the same could apply to RUNX2, which was inactive on Bril. the core consensus DNA binding element of ZFP354C resembles that of the RUNX2 binding site (62, 65). ZFP354C was reported to antagonize RUNX2-mediated transcriptional activation on a multimerized RUNX2 element (62). functionally, very little is known about ZFP354C, yet it has been suggested to act as a negative regulator of osteogenesis, because its overexpression in C3H10T1/2 reduced BMP4-induced osteogenic differentiation the human BRIL is predicted to contain a bona fide CpG island. methylation of CpG dinucleotides is often associated with silent chromatin, being refractory to transcriptional initiation (66). the BRIL gene was found to be fully methylated in non-expressing HEK293 cells and also in permissive but non-differentiated MC3T3 cells. DMSO was found to down-regulate gene expression and protein levels of methylation prone molecules (DNMT1, DNMT3 and HELLS) and to up-regulate enzymes involved in the conversion of methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, an intermediate to unmethylated CpG. a global gene expression profile monitored by microarrays did not identify Bril as being changed after 5 days of culture. a high affinity binding site for GLI (36, 37) was found in the proximal promoter across species. this element was essential to mediate strong transactivation of the BRIL promoter to GLI2 and much less to mediate transactivation to GLI1 and GLI3. BRIL expression indicated that the PTCH-SMO-GLI pathway is operative in our system. it signals to the perichondrial cells adjacent to hyperthrophic chondrocytes of the bone collar region to induce their differentiation into fully mature mineralizing osteoblasts. the expression and localization of BRIL in embryonic long bones coincide with the domain of osteoblasts responsive to IHH cues. these mice die in late gestation and perinatally due to a number of tissue defects. expression levels of Bril in hind limbs at E15.5 and E17.5 were reduced to less than half. a small yet significant stimulation of the BRIL promoter by GLI1 would support such a hypothesis. the primary repressor function of GLI3 needs to be alleviated for proper osteogenesis. the activating function of GLI1 was found to be dispensable in vivo for mouse development (91), but recent evidence has indicated that it is also important for endochondral ossification (24)."}
