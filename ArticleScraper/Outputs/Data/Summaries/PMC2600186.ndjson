{"summary": "two groups of patients were enrolled: those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who came to emergency departments with exacerbation of their illness (including patients with pneumonia) and those >18 years of age without COPD who were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. yncytial virus (hRSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (24,25), yncytial virus (hRSV), yncytial virus (hRSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (24,25) were performed. nucleic acids were extracted from 200 L of NPA. KCl, 0.625 U Promega Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific, Markham, Ontario, Canada) combined with TaqStart antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) amplification was performed in a Smart Cycler thermal cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) a PCR extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C was performed at the end of the cycling protocol. study design Respiratory samples from adults were obtained from a previous study conducted from December 2002 to April 2003. participants included children 3 years of age who were hospitalized from December 2002 to April 2003, at Laval University Hospital Center in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. nucleic acids were extracted from 200 L of NPA by using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) nucleic acids were extracted from 200 L of NPA by using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. mmol/L of each of the 4 deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 50 mmol/L KCl, 0.625 U Promega Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific, Markham, Ontario, Canada) combined with TaqStart antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) topologic accuracy of the tree was evaluated by using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. results HBoV DNA was detected in NPA samples from 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults (71 years of age) and from 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children (mean age 17 months, median age 23 months) none of the children with single HBoV infections and only 2 (6%) of all 31 HBoV-infected children were admitted to the intensive care unit. the control group of asymptomatic children who underwent elective surgery was more frequently performed in children with HBoV infections (36/43, 84%) than in children without HBoV infections (35/57, 61%). the 1 adult with an HBoV infection was a 71-year-old man. he was treated with systemic corticosteroids and antimicrobial drugs. no other microbiologic agents (bacteria or viruses) could be identified in his sputum or NPA. HBoV was detected in NPA samples from 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults, 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children, and 43 (43%) of 100 asymptomatic children. another virus was detected in 22 (71%) of 31 HBoV-positive samples from symptomatic children. studies have reported HBoV DNA in 3%\u201319% of children with RTIs. rates of detection tend to be higher in children 1 year of age (4,10) incidence of HBoV infections also tends to be higher in samples from lower respiratory tract. HBoV in any of 64 asymptomatic children (median age 4.1 years, range 5 months to 14 years) but used nasal swabs in asymptomatic patients and NPA samples in symptomatic patients. their control group was also older than our population (mean 18.6 months, median 18 months) we detected 2 HBoV genotypes circulating at the same time in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children during the winter of 2002\u20132003 in Quebec. this result is consistent with findings of other groups from North America and Europe during 2002\u20132004 and highlights the fact that HBoV lineages do not appear to be geographically clustered."}
