{"summary": "a total of 284 nasal swabs were collected during symptomatic and asymptomatic periods of respiratory symptoms from a young female child. a total of 284 nasal swabs were collected during symptomatic (196 specimens) periods of respiratory symptoms from a young female child. we conducted a 27-month study to investigate the frequency of infection of 19 different respiratory viruses and subtypes in a young child in a nursery school. we sought to determine the duration of viral genome detection in clinical specimens using multiplex real-time PCR. human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (A and B), human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134 (HPIV-1\u20134), human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134 (HPIV-1\u20134), human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), human coronavirus (HCoV), influenza virus [A (FLUAV), A (H1N1) 2009, B (FLUBV) and C (FL the combinations of viruses co-detected in 66 samples are shown in Table 1. only HRV was detected before the child was admitted to nursery school (3/24, 12.5 %). \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 the most frequently detected virus was HRV (26 occasions), followed by HAdV (26), HBoV1 (four), HEV (three), HCoV-OC43 (two), HCoV-NL63 (one), hMPV (one), HPIV-3 (one), FLUAV (one), FLUCV (one) and RSV A (one). results of 27-month follow-up study of respiratory virus infections and duration of detection. no reports describing detection and analysis of 19 different respiratory viruses from numerous specimens collected from one person. despite being one of the most frequent respiratory virus infections for young children, most cases only experience mild symptoms. in addition to HRV, HAdV, HBoV1, HEV and HCoV-OC43 were also detected multiple times. a follow-up study for a young child also showed a high proportion of multiple virus-positive specimens in both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods. however, the effect of multiple viral infections on the severity of clinical signs is uncertain as described previously."}
