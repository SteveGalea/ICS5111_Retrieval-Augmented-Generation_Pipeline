{"summary": "small fragments of proteins (peptides) derived from both intracellular and extracellular sources are displayed on the surface of cells by molecules encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) these peptides are recognized by T lymphocytes and provide the immune system with a surveillance mechanism for the detection of pathogens and cancer cells. sulfinic (dioxidation) and sulfonic acids (trioxidation), S-nitrosylation, and S-glutathionylation are hallmarks of this process. oxidative stress, triggering of the unfolded protein response, and modulation of host cell synthesis by the virus are hallmarks of this process. innate immunity, apoptosis, redox homeostasis, and cytokine production are modulated by this GST-catalyzed post-translational modification (30\u201332) viruses are known to induce oxidative stress (33\u201335), the intracellular environment of viral infection may lead to an increase in S-glutathionylated cellular proteins and viral antigens. we describe the functional and structural implications of redox-modulated antigen presentation. we suggest that S-glutathionylation plays a key, previously unappreciated role in adaptive immune recognition. ic acid protein assay with a micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) was obtained either from the University of Melbourne Tetramer Facility (Parkville, Australia) or the NIAID, National Institutes of Health, MHC Tetramer Core Facility (Atlanta, GA). 108 DC2.4 cells were disrupted by gentle resuspension in a total of 5 ml of lysis buffer without cryogenic milling. cells were infected with VACV-S510 at 5 pfu/cell and incubated for 4 h. an AB SCIEX QTRAP\u00ae 5500 mass spectrometer was used for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection. 20-l samples were injected and loaded onto a trap column. buffer B of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA and at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. peptides were separated using linear gradient elution of 0\u201380% acetonitrile over 90 min (300 nl/min) a false discovery rate cut-off of 5% was applied, and the filtered data set was further analyzed manually. mononuclear cells were harvested from the brains of acutely ill mice 7 days p.i. and analyzed for expression of IFN- after peptide stimulation. unless otherwise noted, peptides corresponding to S510 or GSH-S510 epitope were used at a final concentration of 1 m. crystals of H-2DbGSH-S510 were grown at 21 \u00b0C in 0.1 m citrate, pH 7.5, 28% PEG 3,350, 0.2 m LiSO4 using a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. crystals were cryoprotected by equilibration against mother liquor containing 5% glycerol and flash-frozen by placing in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. dRfactor = (Fo| |Fc)/(hkl)iI(hkl), where N is the redundancy of the hkl reflection. two loop regions of the 1/2 domain of the glutathionylated structure superimposes with individual pMHC copies of 2ZOK.

GSH-S510 peptide was less potent than S510 peptide in inducing IFN- responses (EC50 = 1.3 1010 m versus 4.6 1010 m, respectively) overlapping subsets of CD8+ T cells in the JHMV-infected brain recognize epitopes S510 and GSH-S510. CNS leukocytes isolated from JHMV-infected brains at day 7 p.i. were incubated without tetramer (negative control), stained with H-2DbS510 tetramer or H-2DbGSH-S510 tetramer, or co-stained with both tetramers. we examined whether CD8+ T cells were composed of discrete populations by co-staining cells with both forms of S510. 40% of H-2DbS510 tetramer+ cells were not labeled with the tetramer. this indicates that a considerable fraction of the cells recognize only the native form of S510. notably, there was also no distinct population of cells labeled with the H-DbGSH-S510 tetramer alone. the structure of the H-2DbGSH-S510 binary complex was determined to 2.8 resolution. initial refinement revealed clear unbiased density for the peptide with a covalent modification at P1. the peptide adopts an extended conformation equivalent to that observed for the native peptide complex. the cleft of the complex is mediated primarily by Cys(P)1, Ser(P)2, Asn(P)5, and Leu(P)9. the glutathione tripeptide forms multiple van der Waals contacts with the heavy chain of H-2Db as well as with the peptide residues Cys(P)1 and Trp(P)4. the 2 helix has been rendered in semitransparent mode in A and removed in C. in all panels, the ligand residues are labeled in italic type.

CD8 T cell escape is common in viral infections, including those caused by HIV and hepatitis C virus (69, 70) we speculate that this may be a common theme in viral infections and other pathologies, such as tumors. oxidation state of Cys residues in candidate tumor peptide vaccines has influenced the anti-peptide CD4 and CD8 responses. a high proportion of cysteine-containing peptides are oxidatively modified. the extent to which cysteine-containing peptides are selected for presentation are allele-dependent. viral infection modulates the redox balance and skews the GSH/GSSG ratio."}
