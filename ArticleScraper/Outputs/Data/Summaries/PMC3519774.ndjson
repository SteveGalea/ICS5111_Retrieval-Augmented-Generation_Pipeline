{"summary": "specialists are expected to have reduced fitness in heterogeneous environments. fitness of generalists in homogeneous environments is expected to be below that of a specialist. such fitness trade-offs may be caused by antagonistic pleiotropy, in which a beneficial mutation in one environment is harmful or neutral in another environment. high densities of domesticated species have created heterogeneous host environments favorable to the evolution of specialist virus strains. high densities of domesticated species have created extensive homogeneous host environments that favor strong host-specific selection. CDV encodes two envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (CDV-H) protein which mediates virus binding to the target host cell receptor, and the fusion (CDV-F) protein which accomplishes membrane fusion, thereby enabling entry of the viral replication complex into the cytoplasm [36]. Interestingly, the CDV-H protein is the most variable H protein among all members of the genus Morbillivirus. it is unclear to what extent the molecular structure of SLAM receptors of species belonging to different carnivore families alters the binding ability of CDV-H proteins of different strains. it was proposed that strong positive selection at site 549 in the SLAM binding region of the CDV-H protein associated with the substitution of tyrosine (Y) by histidine (H) at this site changed CDV-H protein structure leading to the spread of CDV from domestic dogs to non- syncytia formation assay measured virus production post cell entry by the same CDV strains in cells expressing SLAM from the same three carnivore species. syncytia formation assay measured virus production post cell entry by the same CDV strains in cells expressing SLAM from the same three carnivore species.

Flow cytometry analysis of parental Vero cells and derived cell lines stably expressing domestic dog, lion, and cat SLAM (CD150) receptors. the extent of syncytia formation (mean number of nuclei per syncytium) induced by proteins from two domestic dog strains (Dog94SE and A75/17), two non-dog strains (5804P and Lion94SNP) and one CDV-H protein mutated at position 549 (A75/17-549H) in domestic dog (black bars), African lion (grey bars) or domestic cat SLAM-expressing cells (white CDV-H proteins of strains 5804P, Lion94SNP and mutant A75/17-549H showed similar MNN per syncytium in cells expressing SLAM of the two known CDV host species. mutated CDV-H protein A75/17-549H induced significantly higher MNN per syncytium in cell lines expressing domestic dog SLAM receptors. the relative marginal effects on MNN per syncytium by CDV-H proteins from different CDV strains on cells expressing SLAM receptors from different host species are illustrated in figure S5a. domestic dog strains induced larger syncytia when grown on cells expressing dog SLAM than in cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. the non-dog strains produced similar-sized syncytia in cell lines expressing dog, lion and syncytia produced by infection with four CDV strains used in this study on domestic dog, african lion and domestic cat SLAM-expressing cell lines. images were taken 40 h after infection using phase contrast at 100 magnification. both non-dog strains replicated to higher titer levels than domestic dog strains in cell lines expressing lion SLAM and cat SLAM. all sequences from species in the Canidae clustered together, i.e. domestic dog, raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) the spotted hyena SLAM sequence and SLAM sequences from felids shared a high (96.3%) amino acid sequence identity. the lion and domestic cat SLAMs shared a high (96.3%) amino acid sequence identity and formed a cluster phylogenetically distant to canid SLAM sequences. syncytia formation (mean number of nuclei per syncytium) induced by proteins from two domestic dog strains (Dog94SE and A75/17), two non-dog strains (5804P and Lion94SNP) and one CDV-H protein mutated at position 549 (A75/17-549H) in domestic dog (black bars), African lion (grey bars) or domestic cat SLAM-expressing cells (white bars). photos CDV-H proteins of strains 5804P, Lion94SNP and mutant A75/17-549H showed similar MNN per syncytium in cells expressing SLAM of the two known CDV host species. CDV-H proteins of strains 5804P, Lion94SNP and mutated CDV-H protein A75/17-549H induced significantly higher MNN per syncytium in domestic dog SLAM cell lines. replacing residue Y at site 549 by H in the CDV-H protein of domestic dog strain A75/17 created the experimental CDV-H protein A75/17-549H. this single substitution reduced the MNN per syncytium in cell lines expressing domestic dog SLAM receptors and increased the MNN per syncytia in cells expressing the lion SLAM receptors. the relative marginal effects on MNN per syncytium by CD titers produced by domestic dog strains (a) Dog94SE and (b) A75/17, and non-dog CDV strains (c) 5804P and (d) Lion94SNP after 60 h of growth on cells expressing SLAM receptors from different host species. cells expressing domestic dog SLAM (black bars), African lion SLAM (grey bars), domestic cat SLAM (white bars) and Vero (SLAM negative) cells (hatched dog strains did not produce higher titers than non-dog strains in cell lines expressing domestic dog SLAM receptors. both non-dog strains replicated to similar titer levels in cell lines expressing dog and lion SLAM (ATS = 5.08, df = 1, 7.93; p = 0.055) idae predicted far lower similarities (72.9\u201385.2%) between canid SLAM sequences and SLAM sequences from six species in other carnivore families. results from the syncytia formation assay provided in vitro evidence consistent with the predicted expression of specialist traits by CDV-H proteins from CDV strains. both CDV-H proteins from domestic dog strains performed less well in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM than in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM. domestic dog strains produced higher virus titers in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM. both non-dog strains produced viral titers similar to those produced by domestic dog strains in cells expressing domestic dog SLAM. both non-dog strains produced higher viral titers in cells expressing non-dog SLAM than domestic dog strains produced in cell lines expressing lion SLAM or domestic cat SLAM. results of the virus titer assay indicated factors post cell entry also influenced replication of tested strains. generalists are expected to have a lower fitness than specialists in the environment to which specialists are adapted. domestic cats are not known to exhibit pathological effects of CDV infection. it is likely that immune responses clear CDV before disease is manifested in domestic cats. results from both assays provide considerable evidence for expression of specialist traits by domestic dog CDV strains and generalist traits in non-dog strains. our results provide evidence that one amino acid site (i.e., site 549) on the CDV-H protein influences the efficiency by which different CDV strains enter cells of domestic dog and other carnivore hosts. many models of CDV transmission consider just one host species [56], [57]. specialist CDV strains would be expected to emerge when the size and density of a domestic dog population was sufficient to permit strong host species-specific selection for the emergence and maintenance of specialist strains. our results have important implications for the understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of this multi-host infectious virus in carnivores. strain 5804P was initially isolated from a domestic dog in dog PBMCs. strains Dog94SE, A75/17 and 5804P provided a domestic dog and a non-dog adapted strain from different CDV genetic lineages in the virus titer assay. ukaryotic expression vector using pCG-lion94SNP-CDV-H, pCG-lion94SNP-F, pCG-Dog94SE-CDV-H, pCG-A75/17-CDV-H and pCG-A75/17-CDV-F. protein expression vector pCG-A75/17-CDV-H was used for site-directed mutagenesis at amino acid position 549. SLAM open reading frames without the signal peptide sequence were cloned into a pCG vector already carrying an Ig signal peptide. the nucleotide sequences of all protein expression vectors were confirmed by sequencing. vero cell lines were transfected with the respective SLAM protein expression vector using the Fugene transfection reagent (Roche, Germany) on94SNP-CDV-H+pCG-Lion94SNP-CDV-F (Lion94SNP), using 0.15 g DNA from each protein expression vector per well. images were taken using a Zeiss AxioVert S100 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) and recorded with an Axiocam CCD camera (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) for each cell line, six independent transfection experiments were performed. syncytia formation mainly depended on the CDV-H protein and its ability to bind its cognate receptor. the size of syncytia formation mainly depended on the CDV-H protein and its ability to bind its cognate receptor, and is not significantly affected when CDV-F proteins from different strains or even different morbilliviruses are applied. the NMM is superior to well-known parametric models such as GLMs. a relative marginal effect of 0.5 indicates that it is equivalent to the mean. a relative marginal effect of 0.5 for a given factor category indicates that it is equivalent to the mean. strains dog94SE, A75/17 and 5804P were obtained from a domestic dog. strains were obtained from a domestic dog and non-dog host in 1994. they are well suited to test for specialist and generalist traits. strain Lion94SNP was amplified on vero cells expressing the lion SLAM receptor. titers were determined by the standard limiting dilution method. 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) were calculated. pCG-A75/17-549H-CDV-H was labeled as A75/17-549H in the results for the syncytia formation assay. SLAM genes were amplified from concanavalin A (Con A) stimulated PBMCs and sequenced. SLAM-expressing cells were selected using 1 mg/ml of Zeocin. pCG-A75/17-CDV-H+pCG-A75/17-CDV-F (A75/17), pCG-Dog94SE-CDV_H+pCG-Lion94SNP-CDV-F (Dog94SE), pCG-5804P-CDV-H+pCG-5804P-F (5804P), pCG-Lion94SNP-CDV-F (Lion94S the presence of SLAM on target cells was shown as important for CDV H and F induced syncytia formation. the presence of SLAM on target cells was shown as important for CDV H and F induced syncytia formation (figure S3). the experiments performed for both assays corresponded to a split-plot design of independent experiments. we used the \u2018nonparametric marginal model\u2019 [69], [70] to assess the statistical significance of the results of the fusion assay (six replicates of mean number of nuclei per syncytium per experiment) for more details see references [69] and [70] and the supplementary methods. supporting information methods S1 (DOC) Click here for additional data file."}
