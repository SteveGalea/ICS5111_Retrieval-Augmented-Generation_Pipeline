{"summary": "monoclonal antibodies are made by homogeneous hybrid cells (B cells) that are each clones of the same origin parent cell. polyclonal antibodies are made of several different immune cells (B cells) hybrid cell lines are generated through the fusion of an antibody-producing B cell with a myeloma (B cell cancer) cell. in 1975, K\u00f6hler et al[2] developed a hybridoma method for the production of mAb. in 1984, K\u00f6hler et al[2] were awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. mAb are now long-established as vital research products, but their therapeutic use requires further development. oma cell lines by chemical fusion techniques using for example polyethylene glycol (PEG) this technique is superior to the PEG method due to its high fusion efficiency. a recent publication by Kanduer et al[10] describes another technique for cell fusion based on electrofusion. in 1984, K\u00f6hler et al[2] were awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. mAb are now long-established as vital research products, but their therapeutic use requires further development. cato et al[11] reported that CpG ODN stimulation increases fusion efficiency. mAb can be produced by the hybridoma technology using rat and rabbit spleen cells. EBV transforms the B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce antibodies, representing the humoral immune response in vivo. the first B lymphocyte immortalization experiment was performed by culturing B cells in the presence of a herpes virus from a marmoset lymphocyte cell line. Siemoneit et al[24] isolated B lymphocytes from an anti-HCV-positive donor and immortalized them by EBV infection. two cell colonies were fused with the (mouse/human) heteromyeloma cell line K6H6/B5. this allows for the isolation of monoclonal cell lines that secrete specific human mAb. immortalization by 100% EBV only producing large clones compared to immortalization by 30% EBV and CpG2006 with IL2. the antibody levels, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), showed high optical density in cells immortalized with 30% EBV and stimulants CpG2006. a recent study has shown that the proteins of core and E2 genes within the antigenic regions of a local HCV-3a genotype can be used to develop highly sensitive diagnostic assays. the recombinant antigen showed 100% reactivity against HCV-infected sera, with no cross reactivity in the HCV-negative sera. the disadvantage of diagnosis via the detection of HCV-Abs is the inability to distinguish between active and past infection. the assay developed was able to detect the HCV target antigen in 95% of the serum samples from infected individuals with a specificity of 97% compared to the sera of uninfected individuals. this antigen-detection-based method showed high positive predictive values (99%) and negative predictive values (90%). the added advantage of the assay is that it was highly sensitive and specific for HCV antigen detection. the authors therefore concluded that HCV-NS4 antigen detection using ELISA is a reliable test to confirm HCV infection. we also produced mouse mAb targeting HCV E1 a.a 315-323[43] and used them in the ELISA as a diagnostic assay for HCV infection. a large number of broadly anti-HCV neutralizing antibodies block CD81 interaction with the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2. anti-CD81 mAb inhibits the entry of both HCVcc and HCVpp into the Huh-7 cell line[44,45] HVR1 facilitates the interaction between HDL and SR-BI, which inhibits the neutralization of both HCVpp and HCVcc. anti-SR-BI antibodies inhibit the HCV infection of different genotypes, both in cell cultures and humanized mice. tetraspanin CD81 (26 kDa) is an integral membrane unglycosylated protein. it is reported to possess several functions, such as signal transduction, cell activation, and cell adhesion. a large number of broadly anti-HCV neutralizing antibodies block CD81 interaction with the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2. SR-BI receptor can bind high density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins[8,47]. SR-BI has been previously shown to mediate interactions of E2-CD81. it has been suggested that the SR-BI receptor interacts with HCV glycoprotein E2 hypervariable region 1. anti-HCV antibodies can be targeted against structural and nonstructural protein epitopes. the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are considered major targets for neutralizing antibodies. despite the fact that the HCV E1 glycoprotein is more conserved than E2, it has been proposed that E1 is of lower immunogenicity. anti-E2 human conformational-dependent HCV antibodies targeting E2 in HCVpp cell culture systems have been used to identify E2 epitopes. these regions include the E2 HVR1, the E2 HVR2, and the CD81 binding region of E2 and the C-terminus of HVR1[69]. H-111 E1 (192-202) linear Cross-reactive NA [68] 95-2 E2 (412-423) linear Cross-reactive NA [65] HC-1 E2 (523-540) conformational Cross-reactive No escape [69,125] 3/11 E2 (412-423) linear Cross-reactive N415Y, N415D, N417S, G418D [75] 3C7 E2 (396-407) H strain NA [126] AP Fab e20 E2 (523-540) conformational Cross-reactive NA [132] Fab e137 E2 (412-423) conformational cross-reactive NA [73] E2 (523-540) conformational cross-reactive NA [73] E2 (523-540) conformational cross-reactive NA [127] AR3A E2 (394-424), E2 (437-447) Cross-reactive NA [76] E2 (523-540 two human mAb, HCV1 and 95-2, have been identified as successfully neutralizing HCVpp belonging to different genotypes. a highly conserved linear epitope in E2 (amino acids 412 to 423) has been reported as recognized by HCV1 and 95-2 mAb[65]. AR3B neutralizing antibodies have been shown to protect against viremia in an infected mouse model. lack of cell culture-based assays to measure and quantify HCV activity has long hindered the study of the role of neutralizing antibodies in HCV infections. the binding of HCV to lipoproteins may facilitate HCV uptake by liver cells[47,84]. this facilitated viral entry is mediated through interaction between the ApoB and SR-BI receptors. lipoproteins could possibly play a role in protection against antibody-mediated neutralization by masking epitopes of the viral surface glycoproteins. these 15 glycans in total were reported to play a role in the entry of HCV into host cells. several glycans (E2N1, E2N2, E2N3, E2N4, E2N6, E2N8, E2N9, E2N10, an E2N11) were found to limit the accessibility of neutralizing epitopes on E2[92]. HCV is classified into seven different genotypes. each genotype includes a number of subtypes that are roughly 25% different at the nucleotide level. loss of proofreading ability of HCV NS5B polymerase increases the mutation rate of the virus to one nucleotide per replication cycle. direct cell-to-cell transmission is more efficient in spreading the virus in host, as it allows the virus to escape neutralizing antibodies. both CLDN1 and OCLDN cell receptors were reported to play a role in cell-to-cell transmission[94,95]. an average hen can lay roughly 325 eggs a year. an egg can produce 60-150 mg of IgY[99], one can produce 20-40 g of antibodies a year. the large-scale industrial production of eggs makes the process of IgY production technically efficient. the production of antibodies in plants was carried out in 1989 in transgenic plants. a review by Virdi et al[121] also showed the role of plants as an adaptable expression system for passive immunotherapy. synthetic antibody mimics (synthetic antibody mimics) attach themselves simultaneously to disease cells and immune fighting cells, performing a similar action to natural human antibodies. the synthetic antibody mimics (SyAMs) are thermally stable and can be administered orally. one hen can produce 20-40 g of antibodies a year, with 2%-10% of the antibodies being antigen specific[100] additional advantages of using IgYs include the ease of isolating egg yolk antibodies and the absence of interaction accruing between IgYs and the Fc receptors of mammals. the large-scale industrial production of eggs makes the process of IgY production technically efficient. a review by Virdi et al[121] also showed the role of plants as an adaptable expression system for passive immunotherapy. the authors prospected the use of a plant-based HCV vaccine. synthetic antibody mimics (SyAMs) attach themselves simultaneously to disease cells and immune fighting cells, performing a similar action to natural human antibodies. the synthetic antibody mimics (SyAMs) are thermally stable and can be administered orally."}
