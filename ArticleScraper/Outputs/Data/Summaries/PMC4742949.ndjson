{"summary": "deficiency in the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 transcription factor constitutes a susceptibility factor to occupational, consumer, or environmental exposure to carbon nanotubes. individuals with asthma who manifest reduced expression of STAT1 are at increased risk for exposure to certain engineered nanomaterials. ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) followed by intranasal aspiration (i.n.) followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OPA) of MWCNTs. data are the mean SEM (n = 4 animals control and n = 6 MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups) s Cells from BALF were fixed and stained with the Diff-Quik Stain Set (Dade Behring Inc., Newark, DE), and differential cell counts as well as total cell counts were performed for each animal. RNA Extraction and Taqman Real-Time PCR RNA was collected from mouse lung tissue or primary fibroblasts using the RNeasy Mini Kit. primary MLFs Primary MLFs were isolated from adult male WT and Stat1/ mice as previously published (33). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software v. 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 deficiency does not increase acute lung inflammation at 1 day after exposure to allergen and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) but increases chronic eosinophilia at 21 days. Lungs were lavaged with two aliquots of 0.5 ml PBS and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) saved for cell counts and ELISA. left lung was inflated and fixed with neutral buffered formalin. differential cell counts as well as total cell counts were performed for each animal. RNA Extraction and Taqman Real-Time PCR RNA was collected from mouse lung tissue or primary fibroblasts using the RNeasy Mini Kit. primary MLFs Primary MLFs were isolated from adult male WT and Stat1/ mice as previously published (33). exposure to MWCNTs without OVA presensitization caused an increase in neutrophils in the BALF of both WT and Stat1/ mice at 1 day. however, numbers of eosinophils resolved in both WT and Stat1/ mice by 21 days, but eosinophils remained significantly elevated in Stat1/ mice at 21 days. IL-13 levels returned to control levels in both genotypes by 21 days. IL-5 levels were induced similarly at 1 day in Stat1/ and WT mice. IL- levels were induced by OVA, MWCNTs or the combination of OVA and MWCNTs at 1 day after exposure. IL-1 levels in Stat1/ mice treated with OVA followed by MWCNT exposure were significantly higher at 21 days compared with WT mice. AB-PAS staining of lung sections from WT and Stat1/ mice showed that OVA sensitization or OVA followed by MWCNT exposure resulted in MCM in small airways at 21 days after exposure. MWCNTs significantly exacerbated OVA-induced MCM in WT and Stat1/ mice at 21 days after exposure. airway fibrosis was significantly increased in Stat1/ mice sensitized with OVA or sensitized with OVA then treated with MWCNTs. airway fibrosis in OVA or OVA/MWCNT groups was significantly greater in Stat1/ mice compared with WT mice that received the same treatments. n = 4 animals control and OVA groups, n = 6 MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups. data are the mean SEM (n = 4 animals control and n = 6 MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups) PDGF-AA protein levels in BALF were also increased significantly at 21 days in Stat1/ mice compared with WT mice. the data indicate that STAT1 plays an important role in suppressing the chronic expression of profibrogenic cytokines. TGF-1 treatment increased Col1A1 and Col1A2 mRNAs in WT MLFs. however, Stat1/ MLFs showed increased basal expression of Col1A1 and Col1A2 mRNAs. primary lung fibroblasts from Stat1/ showed increased collagen mRNAs and soluble collagen protein after treatment with recombinant TGF-1. 1A1 mRNA levels at 48 hours in WT and Stat1/ MLF. soluble collagen levels in supernatants 72 hours after treatment with 10 ng/ml TGF-1 or medium alone. mRNA data are the mean SEM of four separate dishes from two experiments. we also measured lung mRNA levels of T-bet, a transcription factor that is required for Th1 development. this effect was not significant, nor was there a significant difference between genotypes. T-bet mRNA levels in lung tissue returned to control levels by 21 days after exposure to MWCNT. statistically significant increases were found after OVA sensitization and treatment with MWCNTs. Stat1/ mice display significant increases in apoptosis compared with WT mice after OVA sensitization and treatment with MWCNTs. data are the mean SEM (n = 4 animals, control and OVA groups; n = 6 animals, MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups) significant differences compared with controls were determined by one-way ANOVA. 1/ mice had higher total cell counts after OVA or OVA/MWCNT at 21 days compared with WT mice. exposure to MWCNTs without OVA presensitization caused an increase in neutrophils in the BALF of both WT and Stat1/ mice at 1 day. however, numbers of eosinophils resolved in both WT and Stat1/ mice by 21 days. MWCNT exposure alone did not increase IL-13, and treatment with MWCNTs after OVA slightly reduced IL-13 levels. IL-5 levels were induced similarly at 1 day in Stat1/ and WT mice after OVA sensitization with or without MWCNTs. IL-1 levels in the BALF were significantly higher at 21 days compared with WT mice. AB-PAS staining of lung sections from WT and Stat1/ mice showed that OVA sensitization or OVA followed by MWCNT exposure resulted in MCM in small airways at 21 days after exposure. MWCNTs significantly exacerbated OVA-induced MCM in WT and Stat1/ mice at 21 days after exposure. airway fibrosis was significantly increased in Stat1/ mice sensitized with OVA or sensitized with OVA then treated with MWCNTs. airway fibrosis in OVA or OVA/MWCNT groups was significantly greater in Stat1/ mice compared with WT mice that received the same treatments. data are the mean SEM (n = 4 animals control and OVA groups, n = 6 MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups) data are the mean SEM (n = 4 animals control and n = 6 MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups) STAT1 suppresses mediators of fibrosis in BALF after OVA sensitization and exposure to MWCNTs. PDGF-AA protein levels were also increased significantly at 21 days in Stat1/ mice compared with WT mice. TGF-1 treatment increased Col1A1 and Col1A2 mRNAs in WT MLFs. however, Stat1/ MLFs exhibited increased basal expression of Col1A1 and Col1A2 mRNAs. primary lung fibroblasts from Stat1/ showed increased collagen mRNAs. Col1A1 mRNA levels at 48 hours in WT and Stat1/ MLF. soluble collagen levels in supernatants 72 hours after treatment with 10 ng/ml TGF-1 or medium alone (control) we also measured lung mRNA levels of T-bet, a transcription factor that is required for Th1 development. this effect was not significant, nor was there a significant difference between genotypes. mRNA levels in lung tissue returned to control levels by 21 days after exposure to MWCNT. Stat1/ mice display significant increases in apoptosis compared with WT mice after OVA sensitization and treatment with MWCNTs. we quantitated apoptosis in paraffin-embedded lung tissue from control and treated animals. Arrows indicate TUNEL-positive cells. data are the mean SEM (n = 4 animals, control and OVA groups; n = 6 animals, MWCNT and OVA/MWCNT groups). profibrogenic cytokines (TGF-1, TNF-, OPN) were exaggerated in the lungs of Stat1/ mice. the mechanism of susceptibility to OVA and MWCNTs in Stat1/ mice involved increased production of profibrogenic cytokines, but also increased responsiveness to cytokines. OVA sensitization completely prevented MWCNT-induced neutrophilia in either WT or Stat1/ mice, while not affecting OVA-induced eosinophilia. this could be significant for understanding the exacerbation of allergen-induced airway remodeling by MWCNTs. transgenic mice that overexpress IL-13 develop nearly all of the chronic remodeling phenotypes present in patients with severe asthma. IL-13 likely mediates its profibrogenic effects by serving as an upstream regulator of TGF-1 (38) and PDGF-AA (39) to promote collagen deposition and fibroblast proliferation. studies with mice have shown that STAT1 is protective in suppressing lung fibrogenesis. mRNA encoding IL-10, an antifibrogenic cytokine, was completely suppressed in Stat1/ mice after OVA sensitization and MWCNT exposure. mRNA levels of the transcription factor Foxp3 were significantly enhanced in lung tissue from Stat1/ mice compared with WT mice. this is consistent with observations that some TUNEL-positive cells were observed within and surrounding the pulmonary vasculature. it remains unclear whether it is the absence of STAT1 that directly results in this increase in apoptosis. it remains unclear whether it is the absence of STAT1 that directly results in this increase in apoptosis. STAT1 suppresses the production and activity of a network of profibrogenic cytokines. Deficiency in STAT1 results in susceptibility to chronic airway remodeling by increased production of profibrogenic cytokines. Porter and colleagues used an MWCNT dose range of 10\u201380 g/mouse. a dose of 10 g in mice approximates human deposition for a person performing light work for between 9 months and 7.5 years. however, the dose used in our study would likely represent a relatively high occupational exposure. deficiency of STAT1 is a susceptibility factor to allergic airway disease and exposure to MWCNT."}
