{"summary": "endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site where all proteins (secreted, membrane bound, and organelle targeted proteins) are typically processed and folded in eukaryotes. this accumulates a very high concentration of proteins in the ER which can lead to co-aggregation between proteins and/or polypeptides. this can lead to co-aggregation between proteins and/or polypeptides. the UPR tries to correct folding homeostasis via induction of chaperones that promote protein folding. incorrectly folded proteins are targeted to ER Associated Degradation pathways for processing. if proper folding cannot be restored, incorrectly folded proteins are targeted. adenovirus (Ad), adeno-associated virus (AAV), dengue virus, cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, simian virus-5, Tula virus, rota virus African swine fever virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), hepatitis C virus, corona virus, influenza virus amongst others have been shown to regulate host cell UPR machinery to promote their infection and persistence in the host cytomegalovirus uses the viral protein M50 to downregulate IRE1 leading to suppression of UPR. this article reviews the tug of war initiated by the cell through its UPR signaling against viruses used in gene therapy. the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is the master regulator of the UPR. the stress sensors, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, are activated by the release of BiP from the sensors leading to any of the three distinct pathways. PERK dimerises and autophosphorylates leading to phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (elF) 2. cleaved ATF6 fragment further transcribes chaperones and UPRE to cope with cellular stress and restore homeostasis. IRE1 pathway IRE1 initiates both the pro-survival and pro-apoptotic components in presence of misfolded proteins. sXBP1 acts as a potent transcription factor that regulates the expression of several protein degradation related genes. the late signaling sensor of IRE1 is initiated when the cytosolic IRE1 dimers interact with molecules like the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). these proteins trigger a proapoptotic signal through pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bim and caspase-3 leading to cell death. PERK oligomerizes in the ER membrane and induces autophosphorylation. this leads to global attenuation of translational machinery. accumulated protein load is then cleared off from the ER by ERAD pathway. IRE1 pathway IRE1, the most evolutionarily conserved branch of UPR, initiates both the pro-survival and pro-apoptotic components in presence of misfolded proteins. IRE1 pathway IRE1, the most evolutionarily conserved branch of UPR (Cox et al., 1993) initiates both the pro-survival and pro-apoptotic components. sXBP1 acts as a potent transcription factor that regulates the expression of several protein degradation related genes. the late signaling sensor of IRE1 is initiated when the cytosolic IRE1 dimers interact with molecules like the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). these proteins trigger a proapoptotic signal through pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bim and caspase-3 leading to cell death. PERK oligomerizes in the ER membrane and induces autophosphorylation. this leads to global attenuation of translational machinery. accumulated protein load is then cleared off from the ER by ERAD pathway. gene therapy involves either replacing a mutated gene with a healthy copy or introducing a new gene into the cells to help protect against the disease. gene therapy involves either replacing a mutated gene with a healthy copy or introducing a new gene into the cells to help protect against the disease. the safety and efficacy of this novel modality of treatment recognizably needs to be improved. viral vectors currently available for gene therapy can be categorized into integrating and non-integrating vectors. vectors based on retroviruses (including lentivirus and foamy virus) have the ability to integrate their viral genome into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell. kb No Only dividing cells Large transgene carrying capacity, production of high titres Host immune response, short term gene expression Table 2. Viral vectors used in clinical trials (Last date of access\u201424th March, 2014) ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) NCT01852071 January 14, 2014 X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) NCT00598481 July 26, 2009 X-Linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) NCT00598481; NCT00599781; NCT00794508 December 12, 2013. HSV and UPR HSV-1 are a large (152 kb) fast replicating, enveloped, double stranded (ds) DNA virus. the mature viral particle consists of about 13 glycoproteins which helps the virus to bind and enter the host cell. a second layer called tegument contains 20 different structural and regulatory proteins. amplicons can be efficiently packaged in mammalian cells as concatamers. amplicons are non-toxic and can carry very large DNA fragments. both replication defective and replication competent HSV vectors have been used in gene therapy. cassady et al. (1998) and Mulvey et al. ((2003)) showed that a viral protein, US11 can repress two kinases (eIF2, PKR) and PERK upon HSV infection. this inhibition resulted in a 1000-fold increase in the replication efficiency of HSV1. XBP1 was found to be the primary factor triggering activation of the UPR enhancers during HSV-1 replication. HSV-1 produces proteins such as glycoprotein B (gB) and US11 that have been shown to evade the host UPR mechanism. PERK phosphorylation leads to the activation of the elF2 through phosphorylation. the phosphorylated elF2 also activates the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) the protein of which translocates into the nucleus activating a set of UPR responsive elements. murine retroviruses induce ER stress related genes such as CHOP/GADD153 which leads to apoptosis. lentiviral proteins such as Tat and Nef activate unfolded protein response elements (UPRE) by increasing ROS. NF- B activates inflammatory cytokines and interferons that constitute the initial anti-viral response of the cells. NF- B activates inflammatory cytokines and interferons that constitute the initial anti-viral response. VAI RNA is highly expressed during the late phase of Ad infection. it is transcribed by a RNA polymerase III. it plays a crucial role in preventing shutdown of cellular translational apparatus. recombinant AAV is produced by stuffing the transgene of interest between the flanking ITRs while the rep and cap genes are supplied in trans along with helper function genes. the vector dose-dependent immune response and the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibody against AAV capsids can limit persistent gene expression in humans. scAAV2 was shown to activate the PERK and IRE-1 pathway in HeLa cells with peak activation 12 h post-infection. single-stranded (ss) AAV2 did not induce UPR effectors as dominantly as scAAV2 although it modestly activated PERK and IRE-1. scAAV6 had a comparable effect on PERK activation but not on IRE-1 as scAAV2 vectors innate immune response markers follow UPR inhibition in vivo. this clearly points to the link between UPR activation and clearing of the vectors through innate immune response. it is also known that UPR caused by protein overload can activate cellular NF- B in the early phase while it is inhibitory in the late phase. retroviral vectors to transfer therapeutic genes to autologous hematopoietic cells. but random integration of the lentiviral vectors is also known. retroviruses can induce ER stress related genes like CHOP/GADD153 and Bip. the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)-1 complex can decrease mitochondrial cytochrome c release, thereby inhibiting caspase activation. this mechanism demonstrates how the lentivirus (HIV) can prevent cell death under conditions of stress condition. another unique retrovirus called Foamy viruses (FVs) have also been extensively studied as a gene therapy vector due to their lack of pathogenicity, broad tissue tropism and the ability to carry large (minim vaccinia virus regulates the cellular UPR machinery to facilitate its infection. a vaccinia viral protein K3L which has 28% sequence identity with eIF-2a is thought to function as a pseudo substrate for its kinase. another Vaccinia protein called F1L can indirectly inhibit the activation of the apoptotic protein Baxby by interacting with the proapoptotic protein Baxby. e family that has a natural tropism for B cells has been used to deliver GM-CSF to human B cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients as a potential immune therapy. rigorous vector modification and validation is called for prior to its application as a gene delivery vehicle in humans. seV has been shown to upregulate CXCL2 protein following ER stress. this virus can activate eIF2 kinases like PERK and PKR to induce IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7, a major player in host antiviral innate response. SFV envelope glycoproteins activate the UPR response through induction of CHOP proteins and its consequent upregulation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 apoptotic enzymes. one study revealed that the alpha virus SINV could activate PERK and IRE-1 but not the ATF6 within 48 h of infection in vitro. three types of HSV-1 vectors are currently in use in gene therapy. replication-defective, replication-competent vectors and amplicons. deleting one or more genes involved in the lytic cycle creates a replication-defective vector. innate immunity is a major rate-limiting factor in HSV transduction. the process of autophagy is initiated through the cellular UPR pathway. a number of HSV-1 proteins have been shown to block phosphorylation of eIF2. PERK and IRE were also highly resistant to acute ER stress. this resistance of PERK toward activation by ER stress in infected cells is attributed to the glycoprotein B (gB) associated with the luminal region of PERK. this study also showed a genetic association between PERK and gB. another viral protein called US11 represses the elF2 phosphorylation by directly binding to it. the late HSV viral protein 134.5 also induces dephosphorylation of eIF2. this leads to early repression of ATF4 and CHOP genes downstream. rylated elF2 also activates IRE1 which induces the unusual splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA downstream. IRE1 also activates the IKK leading to NF- B upregulation. the activated NF- B further activates the inflammatory genes thus inducing an inflammatory response. Ad vectors expressing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR have been used in phase I clinical studies to treat cystic fibrosis. improved Ad vectors have also been used to deliver human coagulation factors VIII and IX for phenotypic correction of hemophilia. Ad E3/19 K protein activates NF- B mediated by Ca2+ release from the ER. as a result, NF- B activates inflammatory cytokines and interferons. in the late phase of productive infection, viral protein synthesis is promoted. AAV and UPR Naturally occurring AAV is small (22 nm), non-enveloped and contains single-stranded DNA (4.7 kb) it belongs to the family Parvoviridae, and the genus Dependovirus. it enters the infective cycle only in presence of other helper virus. several other alternate serotypes have shown significant promise in targeting tissues like the muscle and the central nervous system. however, the vector dose-dependent immune response and the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibody against AAV capsids can limit persistent gene expression in humans. single-stranded (ss) AAV2 did not induce UPR effectors as dominantly as scAAV2. inhibiting PERK and or IRE-1 expression in in vitro led to a modest increase in gene expression from scAAV2 vectors. 4 out of 9 patients developed leukemia due to random retroviral integration. this remains a major concern with retrovirus based gene therapy. retroviruses can induce ER stress related genes like CHOP/GADD153 and Bip. a lentivirus-HIV-1 protein called the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) has been reported to induce UPR in mink cells following large accumulation of the viral protein MLV gPr80env. another HIV viral protein called Nef, known to increase infectivity and replication in lymphocytes and macrophages, has been shown to directly interact with the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)-1. there are no published evidence which have studied the interaction between FVs and cellular UPR. however it is possible that like other retro-/lenti- viruses, FVs would have developed mechanism to counteract or utilize the UPR machinery to enhance its own replication in the infected cells. VZV is a member of the Herpesviridae family that has a natural tropism for B cells. it has been shown to induce cellular UPR through ER stress in vitro. it has also been tested as a cancer gene therapy vector. sendai virus (SeV) is a negative strand RNA virus. it uses sialic acid residue or a sialoglycoprotein as their receptor for cell entry. the major advantages of using recombinant SeV as a gene therapy vector is its non-pathogenicity. alphavirus vectors based on Sindbisvirus (SINV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) have been evaluated as a gene therapy vector because of advantages like broad host range, efficient replication in the cytoplasm and the capacity to produce high levels of recombinant proteins. more recently, SFV was used for gene transfer into the central nervous system but was also toxic. SINV activated the UPR by phosphorylation of eIF2 and leading to apoptosis. it has been shown to promote autophagy in neuronal cells in in vitro and in vivo probably via activation of the UPR pathways, thus limiting the spread of viral infection. chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 2 (Ccr2) and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 15 (CXCL15) inhibiting the UPR by proteasomal repressors could reduce innate immune response against AAV leading to higher and probably persistent gene expression. cellular UPR strives to reduce the burden on the ER by enhancing its capacity with the help of several stress response chaperones. if this process becomes futile, UPR can induce apoptosis of the host cell. most viruses reprogram the cellular translational machinery to facilitate the generation of their proteins, but this process can also trigger the UPR pathways."}
