{"summary": "the 2013\u20132016 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in west africa was unprecedented in scale and spread. this epidemic has caused more than 11 300 deaths with more than 28 600 cases. development of efficacious EVD therapeutics and vaccines could have played a more significant role in limiting the 2013\u20132016 outbreak. the most clinically advanced vaccines against EVD are based on generating immune responses toward GP with trials ongoing in Europe, the USA and Africa. the most clinically advanced vaccines against EVD are based on generating immune responses toward GP with trials ongoing in Europe, the USA and Africa. a vaccine regimen which induces long-lived and sustainable levels of CMI and antibodies is desirable. only those vaccines that are safe, efficacious and deployable will be field-effective. only vaccine candidates that have progressed to published Phase I studies will be reviewed here. doses at weeks 0, 4, 8 Kampala, Uganda 30 EBOV vaccine, 30 Marburg vaccine, 30 both concomitantly [16] replication-deficient viral vectors mixture of ChAd3 EBOV and SUDV GP NCT02231866 September 2014 1 1010 vp, 1 1011 vp single dose MD, USA 20 (10 per dose) [18] replication-deficient viral vectors ChAd3 EBOV GP and MVA-BN Filo NCT vp, 5 1010 vp, 1 1011 vp ChAd3 at D0, MVA at 11\u201316 weeks Bamako, Mali 91 [21] live replicating viral vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV NCT02296983 NCT02283099 NCT02287480 November 2014 3 105, 3 106, 1 107, 2 107, 5 107 pfu single dose Kilifi, Kenya; Hamburg, Germany; Geneva the most widely evaluated adenoviral vector EVD vaccines are based on a simian adenovirus serotype 3 backbone (ChAd3) encoding either Ebolavirus glycoprotein alone [18,20] and administered as a single shot or as mixture of ChAd3 EBOV and ChAd3 SUDV vaccines. adenovirus vectors have been extensively evaluated as candidate vaccines for malaria, HIV, HCV, RSV, influenza and tuberculosis, in adults, children and infants. safety profiles were similar for candidate Ebola virus vaccines, with higher doses eliciting more AEs; however, AEs were mostly graded as mild, resolving within 24 h of vaccination. unmodified VSV causes either asymptomatic infection or a mild, flu-like illness in humans. however, truncation of the VSV glycoprotein results in an attenuated, avirulent form that has been shown to be safe in pre-clinical studies in macaques and mice with no evidence of viral shedding. rVSV-ZEBOV was evaluated in a further 51 volunteers. a much lower dose resulted in much lower total IgG and neutralizing antibody titres. rVSV-ZEBOV was again associated with arthritis in 25% of participants. despite the wide use of ELISA assays to measure anti-glycoprotein IgG responses, the majority of Phase I studies used an array of different antibody binding assays to assess the quantity and quality of the antigen-specific antibody response induced by vaccination. the use of different assays conducted in different laboratories following different protocols hinders the comparison of humoral immunogenicity induced by different vaccine candidates. ant EBOV GP arbitrary ELISA units [18] whole virion ELISA EBOV Makona total IgG binding to inactivated EBOV virion arbitrary ELISA units [18,22,25] Alpha Diagnostics (ADI) kit ELISA\u2014Sudan Ebola virus (AE321620-1) SUDV GP (recombinant) unknown total IgG binding to recombinant EBOV GP titres calculated from an lentivirus expressing EBOV GP mayinga capacity of antibody to neutralize a lentivirus expressing EBOV GP IC50 [18] pseudotyped VSV ELISA VSV pseudovirus expressing EBOV GP endpoint titre [19,22,25] aDeSantis et al.

PVs are chimeric virions, which comprise the structural and enzymatic core of one virus with a heterologous envelope protein. retroviruses (lentiviruses and gammaretroviruses) or rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis virus) are used as pseudotype cores. pre-incubation of PV with NAb which bind an envelope protein will result in a lower level of quantifiable reporter protein neutralizing antibodies were measured with a single-round infection assay with EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses. the same team also used EBOV or MARV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses to measure neutralizing antibody activity after 3 or 4 DNA vaccinations. neutralizing antibody titres in the live EBOV and PV assay correlated positively with each other (r = 0.57, p = 0.001) as did titres measured by ELISA and live EBOV (Mayinga strain) neutralization assay (r = 0.8, p = 0.0001) were also detected in vaccinees receiving as little as 3 105 pfu rVSV-ZEBOV. ebolavirus outbreaks occur sporadically and have previously been considered too limited in size to enable assessment of vaccine efficacy prior to regulatory approval. in 2002, the USA Food and Drug Administration introduced the \u2018animal rule\u2019 enabling data from pre-clinical trials to be used to demonstrate efficacy when human trials were not possible as an alternative licensing route for drugs and vaccines against highly lethal diseases. strain parameter measured read-out references binding assays Ebola GP standardized ELISA EBOV GP (recombinant) Mayinga total IgG binding to recombinant EBOV GP arbitrary ELISA units [18] whole virion ELISA EBOV Makona total IgG binding to inactivated EBOV virion arbitrary ELISA units [18,22,25] Alpha Diagnostics (ADI) kit ELISA\u2014Sudan live virus neutralization live Ebola virus mayinga capacity of antibody to neutralize live Ebola virus in vitro neutralizing titre [18,22] pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization pseudotyped lentivirus expressing EBOV GP IC50 [18] pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization pseudotyped lentivirus expressing EBOV GP IC50 [18] pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization pseudotyped standardized glycoprotein ELISA and pseudotyped lentivirus assays each correlate strongly with neutralizing titres against live Ebola virus. these assays avoid the need to work at high containment levels, but may be used to indicate the presence of antibodies with neutralizing activity. lentivirus IC50 r = 0.28 p = 0.14 (n.s.) r = 0.67 p 0.0001 (****) lentivirus IC50 r = 0.28 p = 0.14 (n.s.) r = 0.19 p = 0.31 (n.s.) r = 0.74 p 0.0001 (****) competition ELISA r = 0.18 p = 0.35 (n.s.) same vaccine at the same dose, in the us, induced IgG against Zaire-Mayinga GP with a geometric mean titre (GMT) of 1429 (95% CI: 808\u20132526) at day 28 post-vaccination, which is probably higher than the level achieved 7\u201310 days post-vaccination. no new cases were observed in rVSV-ZEBOV ring vaccination trial. 100% of volunteers in the high dose group developed antibodies against the vaccine strain of Zaire glycoprotein (Mayinga) only 90% developed responses against glycoprotein from the outbreak strain (Guinea) the response rates induced against the vaccine strain were lower than for Zaire (90 and 100%) despite receiving the same dose of each. this may reflect the different sensitivities of the two assays. PVs are chimeric virions, which comprise the structural and enzymatic core of one virus with a heterologous envelope protein. transduction of permissive target cells, facilitating genome transfer and subsequently reporter protein expression, allows a quantifiable read-out. however, pre-incubation of PV with NAb which bind an envelope protein, can inhibit cell entry, will result in a lower level of quantifiable reporter protein expression. in 2010, neutralizing antibodies were measured with a single-round infection assay with EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses. the same team also used EBOV or MARV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses to measure neutralizing antibody activity after 3 or 4 DNA vaccinations. infection was observed post-prime using a pseudotyped lentivirus expressing the GP from the mayinga strain of EBOV. the levels of NAb increased significantly post-boost. a strong correlation between vaccine dose and neutralizing antibody titres was also identified. survival was associated with early and rapid rises in IgG directed mainly toward the viral nucleoprotein. CD8+ T cells specific to the Ebola virus nucleoprotein are also associated with protection in a mouse model of EVD [48]. in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells using a monoclonal antibody abrogated protection in four out of five NHP, whereas passive transfer of IgG did not induce protection. rAdHu5 and ChAd3 vectors encoding EBOV GP induced antigen-specific T cell responses of a similar magnitude [18,24] for the vaccine regimen where ChAd3 vectors encoding EBOV and SUDV GP were mixed, only the responder frequency and not the magnitude of response was reported. however, responder frequency to the mixture was similar to that observed to ChAd3 EBOV GP alone. rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine may be comparatively easy to produce, compared with efforts to generate vaccines for diseases such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine may not induce significant CMI component based on pre-clinical data. cellular immunity that are not readily measured play key roles in protection. this highlights the importance of not being over-reliant on immunological correlates derived from pre-clinical testing. the ability of prime-boost regimens to induce durable CMI and humoral immunity may be desirable for longevity of protection. a single dose of a recombinant adenoviral or VSV vector may suffice for outbreak control. however, large-scale prophylactic immunization of healthcare workers would be a useful first line of defence. a single-dose multivalent vaccine encoding antigens from several putative emerging pathogens could be particularly valuable in such a scenario. studies of patients with EVD in two outbreaks in. gabon revealed that in survivors, IgG responses were largely directed against nucleoprotein. the same observation was made in a small study of EVD cases in the. USA [10]. Characterization of immune responses in natural. Ebolavirus infection have also revealed that exposure can induce cross-reactive antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple Ebolaviruses. phylogenetically related viruses that share receptor-binding domains, and epitopes within envelope proteins may well share therapeutic and vaccine targets. Detailed understanding of the processes associated with inhibition of receptor binding has yielded numerous opportunities for vaccines against other diseases, including malaria and HIV. authors' contribution All authors contributed to the design, drafting and revision of the article. funding K.J.E. is funded by a Horizon 2020 award from the European Union."}
