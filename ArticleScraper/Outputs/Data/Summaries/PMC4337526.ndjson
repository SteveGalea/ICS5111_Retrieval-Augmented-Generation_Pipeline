{"summary": "lineage B SARS coronavirus and lineage C MERS coronavirus highlight the importance of betacoronaviruses as agents of emerging infections. the new virus represents the murine origin of this lineage, with interspecies transmission from rodents to other mammals. deHart et al. (p. 3209\u20133220) constructed such a mutant to clarify the contribution of the E4orf3 protein to inhibition of p53-dependent transcription. findings indicate that the viral E4orf3 protein is not sufficient to inhibit p53-dependent transcription, nor does it induce significant alterations in the profile of p53 posttranslational modifications. cox and Baker et al. describe an animal model that can be used to determine safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of influenza vaccines. this model may allow for preliminary testing of vaccine candidates that can be administered to susceptible populations."}
