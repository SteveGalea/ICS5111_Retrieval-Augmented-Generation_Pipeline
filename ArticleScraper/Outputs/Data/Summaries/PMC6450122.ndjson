{"summary": "LASV is an enveloped ambisense RNA virus belonging to the Arenaviridae. it infects an estimated 300,000 people each year. the only antiviral treatment option for LHF is guanosine analogue ribavirin. a similar recent screen revealed FDA-approved drugs with potential activity against LASV (8). blocking infection early in the life cycle will reduce cellular and tissue damage associated with the replication of incoming viruses and the production of viral progeny. determining the mechanism of action of arbidol implicate a number of possible antiviral effects. the principal inhibitory effect of arbidol on influenza virus appears to be during a late stage of entry when influenza virus fuses with an endosomal membrane. it is not yet clear whether this is its sole or primary mechanism of anti-influenza activity. each drug was tested in parallel against LASV GP- and EBOV GP-MLV pseudoviruses in three to five independent experiments. the average ratio of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value against LASV GP was divided by that for EBOV GP, analyzed in parallel, for each of the eight drugs tested. these ratios indicated that the IC50 values against LASV GP-MLV pseudoviruses were either approximately the same as or lower than the corresponding values for n Avg ratio of IC50 for LASV to IC50 for EBOV, mean SEM Zoniporide Internalization 3 0.72 0.14 Amodiaquine Acidification 4 0.41 0.14 Niclosamide Acidification 5 0.54 0.13 Apilimod Traffic 3 1.50 0.16 Arbidol Fusion 3 0.59 0.12 Clomiphene Fusion 4 4.72 2.41 Sertraline Fusion 3 4.99 2.37 Toremifene Fusion 3 6.71 3.09 a In 115 M and 98%; amodiaquine, 6.6 M and 97%; niclosamide, 0.24 M and 100%; apilimod, 0.03 M and 100%; clomiphene, 1.8 M and 100%; sertraline, 0.7 M and 100%; and toremifene, 0.5 M and 100%. the only published evaluation of the efficacy of arbidol against an arenavirus. data in panel A represent the averages SDs from three experiments. arbidol blocks authentic LASV infection. cells were pretreated with arbidol for 1 h and then infected with LASV. titers were determined on vero 76 cells by a 96-h plaque assay. results indicate the average normalized infection in samples treated with 20 M arbidol (SD) from experiments shown in panels A to C. arbidol appears more potent at impeding LASV-GP than influenza virus HA-mediated CCF. effector cells were generated by transfecting HEK293T/17 cells with plasmids encoding DSP1-7 (the N-terminal split luciferase plasmid) and either LASV GP (A) or WSN influenza HA and NA (B) as a complement to the CCF study, we employed an assay involving forced fusion at the plasma membrane (FFPM) we assessed fusion of LASV GP-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviruses with the surface of cells expressing pmLamp1 (i.e., with Lamp1 at the cell surface), as previously described (31). the ratio of Renilla to firefly luciferase (RLUC/FLUC) was then normalized to RLUC/FLUC ratio for the mock-treated cells (A) or directly plotted (B). each experiment was repeated one time, with similar results. da GP1 subunit occurs optimally at 37\u00b0C and half maximally at pH 6.4 at 37\u00b0C following a 1-min low-pH pulse. the presence of 40 M arbidol shifted the pH dependence for GP1 dissociation by 0.5 U in the more acidic direction. if arbidol stabilizes LASV GP, then it might delay GP1 dissociation in this system. data are the averages from five experiments. error bars represent SEMs. comparison of potency of small-molecule inhibitors against LASV GP- and EBOV GP-mediated entry. clomiphene, sertraline, and toremifene are cationic amphiphilic drugs. clomiphene, sertraline, and toremifene are more potent against EBOV. clomiphene, sertraline, and toremifene are cationic amphiphilic drugs. the average IC50 and maximum percent inhibition values across all experiments for EBOV were as follows: zoniporide, 88 M and 87%; amodiaquine, 1.9 M and 82%; niclosamide, 0.12 M and 100%; apilimod, 0.04 M and 100%; clomiphene, 5.7 M and 100%; sertraline, 2.6 M and 90%; and toremifene, 2.9 M and 96%. clomiphene, 1.8 M and 100%; sertraline, 0.7 M and 100%; and toremifene, 0.5 M and 100%. EC50 of 5.8 M in vero cells for arbidol against the new world arenavirus Tacaribe virus (34) SEMs from three experiments performed with triplicate samples from one experiment. arbidol blocks authentic LASV infection. cells were pretreated with arbidol for 1 h and then infected with LASV. orbed virus was removed and the cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of drug in a 37\u00b0C CO2 incubator. results in panels A to C are the average titers from duplicate wells. arbidol blocks LASV GP-mediated fusion. arbidol suppresses LASV GP-mediated cell-cell fusion (CCF) effector cells were generated by transfecting HEK293T/17 cells with plasmids encoding DSP1-7 (the N-terminal split luciferase plasmid) and either LASV GP (A) or WSN influenza HA and NA (B) arbidol suppressed LASV-GP-mediated FFPM. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pmLamp1 and firefly luciferase (FLUC) 24 h later, the cells were pretreated with the indicated dose of arbidol (or mock treated) for 1 h. data are from a representative experiment performed with quintuplicate samples. Error bars indicate SD. ***, P 0.001; ****, P 0.0001. each experiment was repeated one time. the presence of 40 M arbidol shifted the pH dependence for GP1 dissociation by 0.5 U in the more acidic direction. if arbidol stabilizes LASV GP, then it might delay GP1 dissociation. to test this idea, we again captured LASV GP1/GP2 on beads. DISCUSSION Drugs that block LASV and EBOV GP-mediated entry with similar potencies. all eight are orally available, room temperature-stable small molecules that block EBOV entry. six are approved for clinical use and two are in advanced clinical testing. apilimod blocks EBOV trafficking to late endosomes (51, 53, 61) apilimod blocks EBOV trafficking to late endosomes (51, 53), which serve as portals for both EBOV and LASV (25, 26, 62\u201364). arbidol (Umifenovir), a synthetic antiviral approved and used in Russia and China to combat influenza, showed 3- to 6-fold greater activity against EBOV GP- than arbidol shifts pH dependence for fusion-inducing conformational changes by 0.2 to 0.3 U in the more acidic direction. this event is thought to unclamp the LASV fusion subunit (GP2). a long-term goal is to identify a drug cocktail that inhibits LASV and EBOV entry into cells. zoniporide is not approved, but has advanced to phase II clinical trials for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. aripiprazole blocks EBOV infection and synergizes with other entry inhibitors. arbidol is approved and used in china and Russia against influenza. a single standard human dose (200 mg) of arbidol yields a Cmax lower (33, 72\u201374) than our preliminary indication (Fig. 3) of its IC50 against authentic LASV. amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and ribamidil have been reported to enhance the activity of arbidol against influenza (79) we envision that an orally available, room temperature-stable, approved drug or cocktail of approved drugs could be rapidly deployed for treatment or prophylaxis against (suspected) cases of LASV and EBOV. zoniporide, an inhibitor of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, blocks infection by the arenavirus LCMV by thwarting macropinocytotic uptake of viral particles (52). zoniporide, an inhibitor of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, blocks infection by the arenavirus LCMV by thwarting macropinocytotic uptake of viral particles (52). CADs may interfere with LASV entry due to general impairments of late endosome function. arbidol showed roughly equivalent potencies against LASV and EBOV GP-mediated pseudovirus infection. a long-term goal is to identify a drug cocktail that inhibits both LASV and EBOV GP-mediated entry. aripiprazole blocks EBOV infection and synergizes with other entry inhibitors. aripiprazole blocks EBOV particle internalization as well as LASV GP-mediated infection. the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) is within range of the IC50 for anti-EBOV/LASV activity (20\u201323, 57, 68, 69) newer amodiaquine derivatives (59) or synergistic drug pairs containing amodiaquine or niclosamide and another agent could lower the needed doses (23). the trafficking inhibitor apilimod is well tolerated and a potent antagonist of EBOV and LASV (51, 53, 70; also the net (cumulative) Cmax with multiple daily dosing is expected to be significantly higher. a tolerated higher dose of arbidol (74), a new arbidol derivative (39, 44), or a combination of arbidol with another drug (23, 77, 78) might lower the dose needed to be in line with attainable antiviral efficacy. phenol-red free DMEM, Opti-MEM, sodium pyruvate, antibiotic/antimycotic, trypsin-EDTA (0.05%), phenol-red free trypsin-EDTA (0.5%), and neutral red (NR) were from Thermo Fisher Scientific. vero 76 cells were from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) HEK293T/17 and BSC-1 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% CCS.
