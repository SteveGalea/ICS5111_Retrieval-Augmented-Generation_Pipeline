{"summary": "village doctors receive a modest subsidy for providing public health services associated with the package. their beliefs about this subsidy and providing public health services could influence the quality and effectiveness of preventive health services and disease surveillance. local government agencies are required to subsidize village clinics for providing public health services. but reduced government health spending has undermined preventive health services provision and disease surveillance activities. the government launched the health system reform plan in 2009 to revitalize the provision of basic public health services. we conducted 10 focus group discussions with village doctors during 2011. we focused on village doctors\u2019 perspectives on and experiences with the provision of public health services. we adopted thematic framework analysis to inductively analyse and interpret the data. village doctors from all three towns attended the same focus group discussion. ten focus group discussions were conducted, each with approximately 10 participants. the topic guide addressed the type of public health services provided. in 2010, there were 620 700 and 1 021 411 individuals in the Hubei study counties and 317 200 and 383 405 in the Jiangxi study counties. the average annual farmer income ranged from 5255 RMB to 6778 RMB (national average, 5919 RMB) most villages had one clinic but some had more. four directors from county CDCs and 12 directors from township health centres composed this group of key informants. we used a semi-structured topic guide to explore key informants\u2019 views on the public health services provided by village doctors. each interview was conducted in Mandarin in the participant\u2019s office or meeting room, without others present. focus group discussions were tape recorded with participant consent and conducted in Mandarin. each focus group discussion lasted around 50 minutes. data analysis Because of the study\u2019s applied nature and its relevance to policy decisions. some township directors believed that village doctors did not take their public health responsibilities seriously. but most key informants assert that indifference has decreased since the introduction of the subsidy. village doctors said they prioritized providing public health services. village doctors claim that providing public health services involves a significant investment of time that has a negative impact on other income-earning activities. a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that village doctors tend to equate value and recognition with remuneration. village doctors complained that the outcome of supervision by township staff sometimes influenced the amount of subsidy they received. other studies confirmed difficulties in supervising village clinics3 and acknowledged that public health services are weak in villages partly because of limited supervision."}
