{"summary": "respiratory infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. a worldwide disease burden estimated at almost 98,000,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and more than 4,000,000 deaths per year [1], [2]. a number of studies show that respiratory infections have the most prominent impact on the pediatric population. the most sensitive and specific methods for detection of respiratory viruses are molecular techniques [17], [27], [28], [29]. Molecular methods may be roughly divided into sensitive and specific assays such as real-time PCR or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (SISPA), and techniques with broad specificity that are capable of detecting a wide variety of pathogens. assay design was based on all available sequence data for human respiratory viruses. the combination of this highly sensitive culture system with a set of optimized molecular assays should allow improved detection in clinical samples.
