{"summary": "cross-species transmission of H5N1 viruses to human has been documented in 633 cases, with a mortality rate of 59.6%, since the reemergence of H5N1 viruses in 2003 [6] cross-protection is a highly desirable feature of an H5N1 vaccine to avoid the possible pandemic of H5N1 influenza viruses. inactivated virus of clades 1 and 2.1 and virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the HA, NA and M1 proteins of IN5/05 and VN/1203 showed significant cross-protective potential [15]\u2013[17]. a veterinary vaccine expressing the H5 gene of the A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (A/BhG/QH/1/05) also provided protection against lethal challenges of homologous and heterologous MVTTHA-QH and MVTTHA-AH express the H5 gene of a human-derived Qinghai strain A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived Anhui Strain A/Anhui/1/2005. we determined the immunogenicity and efficacy of both vaccine constructs in mice against homologous and heterologous human influenza viruses. a group of diverse H5N1 pseudoviruses were prepared according to recently described methods. the HA gene of A/BhG/QH/1/05 was amplified by RT-PCR. each HA ORF gene was then inserted into a vaccinia shuttle vector pZCXz under the strong synthetic promoter pSYN. anhui-F 5\u2032-ATGGAGAAGATCGTGCTGCTG, and anhui-B 5\u2032-GATGCAGATTCTGCACTGCAGGCT. MVTTHA-AH and MVTTHA-AH viral stocks were propagated in vero cells and then purified by ultracentrifugation through a 36% sucrose cushion. mice were immunized with 3.0106 plaque formation unit (PFU) of MVTTHA-QH or MVTT HI tests were performed with 1% chicken red blood cells according to a method recommended by the world organization for animal health. serum samples were also tested for neutralizing antibody against live A/BhG/QH1/05, A/HAXJ/WSN and A/VN/1194/04. the animals were humanely euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium salt (100 mg/kg) and followed by cervical dislocation. weight loss is greater than 20% body weight at the start of the experiment for 72 hours. A/BhG/QH/1/05 and A/VN/1194/04 were cultivated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. A/HAXJ/WSN was propagated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. allantoic fluids and cell cultures were harvested and stored at 70\u00b0C. the recombinant virus was selected through six rounds of plaque purification under agar and confirmed by immunostaining assay using an anti-H5 serum. the insertion of full length gene of H5N1 HA was further confirmed by PCR using specific primers. recombinant virus expressing spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. blood samples from each mouse were collected 2 weeks after each vaccination. titer of neutralizing antibody defined as highest serum dilution. the cell-mediated immune response was determined by measuring H5-specific IFN- released by splenocytes according to a previously published ELIspot assay. mice were either immunized with 1.5106 or 3.0106 PFU of MVTTHA-QH and MVTTS, respectively, twice, with a one month interval. data obtained from animal studies and pseudotyped virus neutralization assays were examined by using one-way ANOVA. differences were considered significant at P0.05. HA gene of A/BhG/QH/1/05 and A/Anhui/1/2005 was chosen for vaccine construction because A/BhG/QH/1/05 represents the prototype of clade 2.2 highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 viruses. the three live viruses that are included in this study are marked with arrowheads. the three live viruses that are included in this study are marked with arrowheads. the amino acid positions are based on mature H5 sequences. three live viral strains included in this study. modified shuttle vector pZCxz was constructed to target the H5N1 HA gene into the MVTT genome in the location of the MVTT HA gene. the shuttle vector contains dual promoters that allow the simultaneous expression of two target genes. the reporter gene served as a surrogate marker for the selection of recombinant VTT carrying the HA gene. MVTT virus expressing H5 gene from a/BhG/QH/1/05 and a/Anhui/1/2005 strains. the HA gene was introduced together with GFP gene or RFP gene. the restriction enzymes Bam HI and Xho I were used for constructing MVTT-HA-QH and MVTT-HA-AH. MVTTHA-AH was able to induce potent NT response against the autologous viral strain with a dilution factor of IC50 over 1000 after the first immunization. the second immunization boosted primary responses by 2 (I.N.) to 8 (I.M.) fold for NT titers. 3rd immunization boosted primary responses for NT titers. HA from A/Anhui/1/2005 is less antigenic compared to HA from the Qinghai strain. MVTTHA-QH was found to be immunogenic in mice for inducing both antibody and cellular immune responses. MVTTHA-QH was a better vaccine candidate for the prevention of the H5N1 pandemic compared to MVTTHA-AH. three groups of mice were immunized twice with 3106 PFU of MVTTHA-QH on day 0 and 31. all three vaccination routes were able to induce both HI and NT responses. the I.N. route induced higher levels of both HI and NT responses than the other two routes after the first immunization. vaccinated animals were challenged with the homologous pathogenic A/BhG/QH/1/05 virus strain three weeks after the second immunization. the protected mice showed no clinical signs of infection, including huddling, shivering and ruffled fur. the protected mice showed significant clinical signs of infection and died within 6 days post viral challenge. MVTTHA-QH was able to induce both HI and NT responses, as expected. two heterologous human viruses, A/VN/1194/04 and A/HAXJ/WSN, were included. hG/QH/1/05 and A/VN/1194/04 viruses were not included in the challenge experiment. all animals with detectable antibody responses were completely protected against the homologous A/BhG/QH/1/05 challenge. animals which received MVTTS showed significant clinical signs. no viruses were obtained from mice vaccinated with MVTTHA-QH. in agreement with the data shown in Fig. 5, no viruses were obtained from mice who received MVTTHA-QH. we analyzed the sequences of the HA genes derived from the human A/Xingjiang/1/06 strain. the major antigenic sites within clade 2.3.4 were relatively conserved. we hypothesized that vaccines based on the HA would at least offer protection to human H5N1 influenza viruses of the same clade. 2.2 A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005*... A................ 2.2 A/WS/Mongolia/244/2005*. 2.1 A/Chick/Indonesia/5/2004. modified shuttle vector pZCxz was constructed to target the H5N1 HA gene into the MVTT genome in the location of the MVTT HA gene. the HA gene of A/BhG/QH/1/05 or A/Anhui/1/2005 was constructed under. reporter gene served as surrogate marker for selection of recombinant virus. positive plaque was selected under a fluorescence microscope. total DNA was extracted from vero cells infected by either MVTTHA-QH or MVTTHA-AH. no HA protein expression was detected on vero cells infected with MVTT-HA-QH or MVTT-HA-AH using mouse anti-HA serum in an immunohistochemical staining assay. MVTTHA-QH induced specific immune responses against homologous H5N1 influenza virus. the second immunization boosted primary responses by 2 (I.N.) to 8 (I.M.) fold for NT titers. none of the mice immunized with MVTTHA-AH was able to induce any NT response against its homologous strain. however, MVTTHA-AH induced seemingly lower levels of NT responses through the I.N. route than through the I.M. route. MVTTHA-QH (A) or MVTTHA-AH (B, C), respectively, at three-week intervals via intranasal (I.N.) and intramuscular (I.M.) inoculations. the antiserum was collected at two weeks after each vaccination. control animals were given MVTTS via the same routes. the group included viruses from clades 1 (VN1203 and VN1194), 2.1 (ID05 and ID04), 2.2 (Qinghai and Turkey), 2.3.2 (Chinese duck E319) and 2.3.4 (Fujian and Anhui) clades 2.2 were most optimally inhibited, followed by clades 2.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.4 and 1. all three vaccination routes were able to induce both HI and NT responses. the I.N. route induced higher levels of both HI and NT responses. the second immunization boosted the primary responses significantly. mice were vaccinated with 100 MLD50 A/BhG/QH/1/05 three weeks after the second immunization. MVTTHA-QH induced potent antibody response and protected mice against live heterologous human H5N1 influenza viruses. despite antigenic variation, HI and NT responses were also detected against the clade 1 A/VN/1194/04. as expected, no H5-specific HI and NT responses were detected among mice immunized with MVTTS. despite clinical signs, three control animals survived the A/VN/1194/04 challenge. mice were vaccinated twice with MVTTHA-QH via intranasal and intramuscular routes. mice who received MVTTHA-QH were included as controls. MVTT-HA (i.n.) 0/2 0/2 0/2 MVTT-HA (i.m.) 2/2 2/2 0/2 0/2 MVTT-S (i.m.) 2/2 2/2 0/2 0/2 MVTT-S (i.m.) 2/2 2/2 0/2 0/2 MVTT-S (i.m.) 2/2 2/2 0/2 1/2 *, dpi: day post infection virus that are closely related to A/BhG/QH/1/05 have been found to have spread rapidly to Europe, India and Africa via migratory birds. in the past few years, viruses that are closely related to A/BhG/QH/1/05 have been found to have spread rapidly to Europe, India and Africa via migratory birds. the HA gene of A/Xinjiang/1/06 remains closely related to A/BhG/QH/1/05. mutations in A/Xinjiang/1/06 did not seem to confer resistance to the NT and HI antibodies induced by MVTTHA-QH. this was most likely caused by mutations inducing conformity. two out of five mice in the oral administration group did not respond to the MVTT-HA-QH vaccine after two immunizations due to individual variance. MVTT-HA-QH can be produced using WHO-recommended Vero cells with ease and without the requirement of bio-safety level-3 containment. intranasal vaccination with MVTTHA-QH induced consistently high levels of systemic neutralizing antibodies against SARS coronavirus. intranasal vaccination can overcome pre-existing anti-vector immune responses, which offers advantages for the elderly who previously have received VTT."}
