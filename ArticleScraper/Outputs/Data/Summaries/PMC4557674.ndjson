{"summary": "the requirement for CD4 T-cell help in primary CD8 T-cell responses is not universal. primary CD8 T-cell responses against infectious agents are mostly CD4 T-cell independent, whereas responses to non-inflammatory stimulation or non-replicating vaccines are dependent on CD4 T-cell help. CD8 T cells are the major effectors controlling viral load via both IFN- and perforin-mediated mechanisms. the role of CD4 T cells is complex because they promote CD8 T-cell function and survival within the CNS9,10 and directly contribute to viral control. the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype was rescued when virus replication was controlled by transfer of memory CD8 T cells. the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype during primary responses is regulated by antigen load, rather than lack of CD4 T-cell imprinting. hemisphere with 2000 plaque-forming units of glia tropic monoclonal antibody (mAb) -derived 2.2v-1 variant of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (JHMV) HC class II (clone M5/114.15.2), Fc III/II receptor (clone 2.4G2) and NK1.1 (clone PK136) were transferred into either naive BALB/c mice at day 1 before intracranial infection (12 106 to 15 106/mouse) or at 5 days after intracranial infection (025 106/mouse) all procedures were carried out under animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Cleveland cDNA was generated by Superscript III RTase (Invitrogen) with oligo-dT(12\u201318) primers. RNA levels were determined using stepOnePlusTM Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems) and steponeTM software v2.1 (Applied Biosystems) cytotoxicity assays target cells were prepared by pulsing ammonium-chloride-potassium lysing buffer (Invitrogen) -treated splenocytes with the immunodominant pN peptide (5 m) for 2 hr at 37\u00b0. target cells were then labeled in 50 nm CFSE and 25 nm CFSE. a 96-well plate at 103 per/well was added at effector : target ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 1 or 4 : 1. the plate was centrifuged (300 g for 1 min) to optimize cell contact. the proportion of CFSEhigh and CFSElow cells was determined by flow analysis. all mice were used at 6\u20137 weeks of age and infected intracranially in the right hemisphere with 2000 plaque-forming units of the glia tropic monoclonal antibody (mAb) -derived 2.2v-1 variant of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (JHMV) splenic donor CD8 T cells were isolated by negative selection using FITC-labelled anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5), CD19 (clone 1D3), MHC class II (clone M5/114.15.2), Fc III/II receptor (clone 2.4G2) and NK1.1 (clone PK136) all procedures were carried out under animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Cleveland Clinic Foundation. clear cells were collected from the 30%/70% interface, washed with RPMI-1640 and counted before analysis. quantitative real-time PCR analysis RNA from brains of naive and JHMV-infected mice was extracted using TRIzol reagent. cDNA was generated by Superscript III RTase (Invitrogen) with oligo-dT(12\u201318) primers. cells were stained with surface molecules before permeabilization with FIX (04% PFA)/PERM buffer. cells were cultured with or without 1 m pN peptide for 5\u20136 hr with 1 l of Golgi Stop. peptide pulsed and untreated targets labeled in 50 nm CFSE and 25 nm CFSE. total target cells were plated into a 96-well plate at 103 per/well. virus-specific CD8 T cells were added at effector. tailed Student\u2019s t-test and verified using two-way analysis of variance. any variance between statistical evaluations resulting in a change from significant to non-significant or vice versa are indicated in respective figure legends. etramer staining at the indicated times post-infection (p.i.) shows a critical role of CD4 T cells in controlling CNS virus replication at least to day 14 p.i. the sustained symptoms leading to mortality were associated with uncontrolled virus replication. clinical scores (a) and survival rates (b) of infected CD4-depleted and control mice (n = 12 to n = 20 per group) immunohistochemistry revealed an increased number of virus-infected cells in CD4-depleted mice at day 21 p.i. depleted mice analysed for distribution of infected cells, inflammation and demyelination. CD4 T cells in brain exhibit a predominantly neuronal morphology (a, insert), but glia morphology in the spinal cord (b, left insert). CD4 T cells do not influence CNS recruitment of virus specific CD8 T cells. peak frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells were equally low at day 5 p.i., peak frequencies were reached by day 7 p.i. in both groups. in the spinal cord virus-specific CD8 T cells were virtually identical throughout infection, irrespective of the presence or absence of CD4 T cells during priming. paired Student\u2019s t-test, evaluation by anova determined significant differences in (b) for spinal cord at day 7 p.i. for Ld/pN-tetramer staining (*P 005) The primary anti-viral mediators reducing infectious JHMV within the CNS are T-cell-derived IFN- and perforin. in spinal cords the frequencies of IFN--producing CD8 T cells were highest at day 7 p.i. and declined in both groups out to day 21 p.i., with no statistically significant differences between both groups. this suggests that CD4 T cells support sustained IFN- expression by virus-specific CD8 T cells under conditions of prolonged antigen exposure. no defects in initial generation and CNS recruitment of IFN--producing virus-specific CD8 T cells suggested failure to control infectious virus was attributed to inefficient triggering of T-cell effector function in vivo. 8 T cells do not acquire a memory precursor effector phenotype. maintenance of CD8 T cells in the CNS appears optimal. however, two effector cell subsets whose differential expression of the interleukin-7 receptor a chain (CD127) and Killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) is associated with fate determination and development of memory cells are common to many infections or immunizations. d mice, while 30% of helped CD8 T cells displayed this terminal effector phenotype. the proportion of KLRG1+ cells and SLEC within virus-specific CD8 T cells had dropped significantly in both groups. this population only reached 30% in CD4-depleted mice. gating strategy to distinguish CD127 KLRG1+ short-lived effector cells (SLEC) and CD127+ KLRG1 memory precursor effector cells (MPEC) is indicated. evaluation by analysis of variance showed slightly increased statistical significance (***P 0001) in left graph (SLEC) for days 5 and 21 p.i. and right graph (CD127+ KLRG1+) for day 21 p.i., but no significance in the CD127+ KLRG1+ population at day 14 p.i. ral load determines the unhelped CD8 T-cell phenotype Similar phenotypic subsets, as well as activity of helped and unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS at day 7 p.i. suggested that CD4 T cells do not imprint peripheral CD8 T-cell activation or initial CNS effector function. memory CD8 T cells were derived from mice immunized with JHMV 3\u20134 weeks post immunization ous CD8 T-cell populations were not skewed by the transfer. the relative MPEC and SLEC populations were similar in spinal cords. the capacity of endogenous unhelped CD8 T cells to produce IFN- was also restored to that of helped CD8 T cells. CD8 T cells require CD4 T-cell imprinting during priming for recall responses. mice were either treated with anti-CD4 or control mAb before JHMV immunization. unhelped virus-specific memory CD8 T cells were significantly impaired in expansion in the draining CLN, as well as early accumulation in the CNS. the relative proportion and total numbers of Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells was significantly lower in the unhelped, relative to helped, donor populations in both CLN and the CNS. the difference was most apparent at day 5 p.i. in the CNS and was resolved by day 14 p.i. helped or unhelped memory Thy-1.1 CD8 T cells (12 106 to 15 106 cells) were transferred into naive wild-type Thy-1.2 recipients 1 day before infection. Virus titres in brains of recipients of helped or unhelped memory CD8 T cells. values in (b) for brain and CLN at day 7 and in (d) for brain at day 7 and in (d) for brain at day 7 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and 14 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and 14 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and 14 and in (d) for brain at day 7 did not reach statistically significant differences. CD4 T cells do not affect CD8 T-cell peripheral expansion. tetramer staining at the indicated times post-infection (p.i.) shows a critical role of CD4 T cells in controlling CNS virus replication at least to day 14 p.i. clinical scores (a) and survival rates (b) of infected CD4-depleted and control mice (n = 12 to n = 20 per group) immunohistochemistry revealed an increased number of virus-infected cells in CD4-depleted mice at day 21 p.i. CD4-depleted mice analysed for distribution of infected cells, inflammation and demyelination at day 21 post-infection (p.i.) virus-infected cells in brain exhibit a predominantly neuronal morphology (a, insert), but glia morphology in the spinal cord (b, left insert).

NS environment and/or the redundant role of interleukin-12, a strong inducer of KLRG1 during JHMV infection. these results are consistent with the notion that early differences in virus-specific CD8 population arise from the absence of CD4 T cells during priming. the significantly reduced efficacy to acquire an MPEC phenotype is driven by ongoing viral antigen stimulation. evaluation by analysis of variance showed slightly increased statistical significance (***P 0001) in left graph (SLEC) for days 5 and 21 p.i. and right graph (CD127+ KLRG1+) for day 21 p.i. but no significance in the CD127+ KLRG1+ population at day 14 p.i. CD4 T cells do not imprint peripheral CD8 T-cell activation or initial CNS effector function. memory CD8 T cells were derived from mice immunized with JHMV 3\u20134 weeks post immunization and transferred into JHMV-infected CD4-depleted or control Thy-1.2 recipients at day 5 p.i. the relative MPEC and SLEC populations were also similar in spinal cords in both recipient groups. the capacity of endogenous unhelped CD8 T cells to produce IFN- was also restored to that of helped CD8 T cells. numbers in the upper left corner represent per cent of tetramer+ cells among total CD8 T cells. e) Recipient virus-specific CD8 T cells were monitored for CD127 and KLRG1 expression. data represent the mean SEM. unhelped virus-specific memory CD8 T cells were significantly impaired in expansion in the draining CLN, as well as early accumulation in the CNS. the relative proportion and total numbers of Thy-1.1+ CD8 T cells was significantly lower in the unhelped, relative to helped, donor populations in both CLN and the CNS. the difference was most apparent at day 5 p.i. in the CNS and was resolved by day 14 p.i. a new tab CD8 T-cell recall response requires CD4 help during priming. helped or unhelped memory Thy-1.1 CD8 T cells (12 106 to 15 106 cells) were transferred into naive wild-type Thy-1.2 recipients 1 day before infection. values in (b) for brain at day 14 and in (d) for brain at day 7 and in (d) for brain at day 7 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in (d) for brain at day 7 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in (d) for brain at day 5 and in ( cinia virus infection of H-2b mice remained unaffected by absence of CD4 T cells. cytolytic activity was similar and IFN--producing CD8 effector cells were equally abundant in the CNS. failure to clear infectious virus from the CNS also resulted in higher proliferation and apoptosis of virus-specific CD8 T cells within the CNS. uncontrolled viral replication despite intact accumulation of virus-specific CD8 T cells was the consequence of CD4 T-cell depletion in both H-2b and H-2d mice. an early defect in CNS CD8 T-cell responses in infected H-2d mice suggested a local beneficial effect of CD4 T cells on CD8 T cells. TRAIL expression influences limited expansion and survival of unhelped memory CD8 T cells in H-2d mice. uncontrolled virus replication during persistence did not exacerbate demyelination in CD4-depleted mice. this contrasts with increased demyelination associated with similarly uncontrolled viral replication in mice deficient in humoral immunity. identifying the cellular mechanism by which CD8 T-cell immunity is regulated by CD4 T cells will provide a key insight into understanding CD4\u2013CD8 cooperation for the development of effective primary as well as memory responses."}
