{"summary": "the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis is of particular interest because it recapitulates clinical and immunopathological features of human disease. a differentially expressed transcript was identified as having at least a 2-fold change in expression between uninfected and infected groups. a robust and functional IFN- response did not restrain parasite load and progression of disease. this supports the accumulating evidence that macrophages are ineffectively activated to kill the parasite. the concomitant expression of IL-4/IL-13 and their downstream target genes are likely to contribute to this."}
