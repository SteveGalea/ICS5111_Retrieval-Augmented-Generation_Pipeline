{"summary": "as of february 2012, there were 583 confirmed human H5N1 infections from 15 countries, with a fatality rate of >59% (344), alarming that the consequences of a H5N1 pandemic could be catastrophic. many efforts have focused on developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in preparedness. the antibody binding epitopes of the H5 HA are located exclusively in areas corresponding to antigenic sites A and B of H3 HA and the antigenic site Sa of H1 HA. previous epitope mapping of HA protein were largely based on the virus escape mutants selected by mouse monoclonal antibodies. previous epitope mapping of HA protein were largely based on the virus escape mutants selected by mouse monoclonal antibodies. human mAb AVFluIgG01 targets a linear epitope within a sequence of the 116IIPKSSWSS124 in the global head region of HA [12] to better locate its epitope residues. we synthesized a set of overlapping peptides that cover full length HA and used in peptide-based ELISA. a. Representative sequences of synthesized HA peptides (Viet04) and overlapping peptides in ELISA. a. Reactivity of AVFluIgG01 with the native and reduced HA proteins (HK06) in ELISA. the mapitope predicted a total of 32 residues while the Pep-3D-Search predicted 36 residues. all predicted residues are exclusively located in the global head region of HA1 subunit. substitutions of residues I116, I117, P118, S123, and Y164 resulted in a dramatic loss of the reactivity. mutations at N165 and N168 also substantially reduced the reactivity of AVFluIgG01 with the expressed HA in the FACS assay. reactivity of AVFluIgG01 with HA and its mutants was tested at 10 g/ml by IFA and FACS respectively. bold mutants indicate the residues critical for AVFluIgG01 binding. H5N1 clades and subclades [12]\u2013[13], [17], underlying the broad-spectrum H5N1-neutralizing activity by AVFluIgG01. the epitopic site I residues (I116, I117, P118) is colored in yellow. the region encompassing the receptor binding site (RBS) is colored in red. two control mAbs, AVFluIgG03 and CR6261 could not inhibit the virus-receptor binding. it is known that AVFluIgG03 has no reactivity with the tested HA. the Viet04 HA pseudoviruses were preincubated overnight. the HA pseudoviruses were allowed to attach to monolayer MDCK cells at 4\u00b0C for 6 hours. the unbound viruses were washed off and the tested antibodies were added to the monolayer for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. both of AVFluIgG01 and its Fab inhibit the pseudovirus entry at a dose-dependent manner. AVFluIgG01 inhibits cell fusion between 293T effector cells and MDCK target cells at a dose-dependent manner. 293T cells were co-transfected with pViet04-HA and pGAL4-VP16. the cells were stained with crystal violet. recombinant Viet04 HA proteins were incubated with or without AVFluIgG01 (A) or its Fab (B) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the mixture was either held at pH 7.5 (lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8) or changed to pH 5.0 (lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. AVFluIgG01 did not react with the peptide 110\u2013127 that contains the 116IIPKSSWSS124 sequence and any of other overlapping and non-overlapping peptides. this result implied that the epitope for AVFluIgG01 could not be simply located within the 116IIPKSSWSS124 motif. g/ml were used to coat 96-well microtiter plates, and a control mAb was tested at a final concentration of 10 g/ml. we used two computational methods, Mapitope and Pep-3D-Search, to predict the AVFluIgG01 epitope. both programs are preferentially for identifying discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the 3D structure of a protein antigen. the common residues predicted by both algorithms are underlined and shown in bold. identification of the epitope residues critical for AVFluIgG01 binding was examined by IFA and FACS assays. uIgG01 Control mAb HA IFA FACS Cells \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 WT +++ +++ +++ +++ N109A +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ E112A +++ +++ +++ +++ K113A +++ +++ +++ +++ K113A +++ +++ +++ +++ I117A +++ +++ P118A +++ +++ S121A +++ +++ +++ Y164A +++ +++ + reactivity of AVFluIgG01 with wild-type (WT) HA or HA containing site-directed mutations analyzed by flow cytometry. three discontinuous sites, designated site I (I116, I117, P118), site II (W122, S123) and site III (Y164, T167) are likely involved in the AVFluIgG01 epitope. AVFluIgG01 inhibits both Virus Attachment and Post-attachment Steps Cell entry of influenza A viruses is mediated by its HA protein through two steps [18]. the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral RNA into the host cell. t04 HA pseudoviruses were preincubated with the tested antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. the unbound viruses were washed off and the amount of bound viruses was quantified. Binding was expressed as a percentage of the reading obtained in the absence of antibody (No Ab) AVFluIgG01 and its Fab inhibit the viral entry at indicated concentrations. both of AVFluIgG01 and its Fab inhibit the pseudovirus entry at a dose-dependent manner. 293T cells were co-transfected with pViet04-HA and pGAL4-VP16. pGal4-VP16 and MDCK cells were transfected with pGal5-luc. the percent inhibition and IC50 were calculated. the recombinant Viet04 HA proteins were incubated with or without AVFluIgG01 (A) or its Fab (B) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the mixture was either held at pH 7.5 (lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8) or changed to pH 5.0 (lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after the pH was restored to 7.5, trypsin (1 g/ml) was added this region is highly variable but all the epitope participatory residues are highly conserved among diverse H5 clades and subclades. the authors considered that the AVFluIgG01 was directed against a linear epitope based on its reactivity. the epitope was further located within the amino acid sequence of 116IIPKSSWSS124 based on the mutagenesis analysis. three sites could be readily refolded through short-range interactions. but the epitope could not be refolded when the HA protein was treated by a reagent followed by blocking the reactive sites. the data strongly suggested a conformation-dependent epitope for AVFluIgG01. antigenic characterizations of the newly-isolated anti-H5N1 human mAbs have identified novel neutralizing epitopes in HA protein. the best examples are human mAbs CR6261 and F10, which possess broadly neutralizing activity and are directed against the highly conserved epitopes in the HA2 subunit [19], [25], [28], [31]. a new anti-H5N1 human mAb, 65C6 with the neutralizing infected patients reacted with the overlapping epitopes that are closely located on the surface of HA 3D structure. we believe that the AVFluIgG01 epitope represents an immunodominant site during natural infection and can be used to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. the Fab fragment of AVFluIgG01 could not inhibit the receptor-binding step at a same concentration as its IgG molecule. it could effectively block the membrane fusion step, as evidenced by its potent inhibition on the viral entry after cell attachment. previous studies established that some HA1-specific Fabs neutralize by inhibiting virus attachment only, but mechanism of neutralization by their IgGs is complex. a set of 77 overlapping peptides span the entire sequence of the HA protein of H5N1 strain A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Viet04-HA) were synthesized at the SciLight Biotechnology LLC, Beijing.
