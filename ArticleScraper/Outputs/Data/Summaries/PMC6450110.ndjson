{"summary": "viral factors target key players in the signaling pathways responsible for activating the type I interferon (IFN) response. viral factors target downstream signaling pathways needed to amplify IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that induce an antiviral state. identifying viral antagonists and investigating how these viral factors interrupt or delay innate responses is important for controlling viral pathogenesis. coVs belong to the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. they encode 15 to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 through nsp16), four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]) many betacoronavirus accessory proteins and several nsps have been identified as IFN antagonists (11) this study aims to characterize the role of EndoU of an enteric CoV. PEDV is an alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV) that infects the enteric tract of swine. it emerged suddenly in the united states in 2013, causing devastating losses in swine production. PEDV infection occurs primarily in intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) it can also be detected in macrophage-like cells located within Peyer\u2019s patches (24\u201326) the endoU activity of PEDV inhibited the type III IFN response in porcine epithelial cells. ligated DNA and linearized N gene plasmid DNA were used as the templates for in vitro RNA transcription reactions to yield full-length genomic RNA and N gene transcripts. these RNA transcripts were mixed and coelectroporated into vero cells, where they were translated into viral proteins to initiate the replication and assembly of infectious particles of PEDV. however, using reverse transcription-PCR, we detected viral leader-containing subgenomic mRNA from the total RNA isolated from electropo virus recovered from the supernatant was designated infectious clone wild type, icPEDV-wt. icPEDV-EnUmt was introduced by introducing a His-to-Ala substitution (H226A) of the catalytic residue of nsp15. the genome sequence of each virus was confirmed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from virus particles. icPEDV-wt replicated as efficiently as icPEDV-wt in vero cells. icPEDV-wt replicated as efficiently as icPEDV-wt in vero cells. icPEDV-wt replicated as efficiently as icPEDV-wt in vero cells. PK1 cells were mock-infected or infected with the indicated virus. the mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-3, the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene and the porcine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at different hours postinfection (8, 12, 24, and 32 hpi) oU-deficient PEDV induces early and robust type I and III IFN responses in PK1 cells. PK1 cells were transfected with 200 ng poly(I:C) for 24 h. relative mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN-3 and (B) ISGs were measured. ISG15, 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) were infected with either icPEDV-wt or icPEDV-EnUmt. PK1 cells were infected with either icPEDV-wt or icPEDV-EnUmt. t at a dose of 0.1 TCID50 per cell assessed the mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN- and IFN-3. we also detected elevated levels of IFN- mRNA in cells infected with the icPEDV-EnUmt. the level was slightly elevated (2-fold) at 24 hpi in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected cells. icPEDV-deEndoU (0.1 TCID50/cell) was harvested for total RNA extraction. relative mRNA levels of IFN- (A), IFN- (B), IFN-3 (C), ISG54 (E) and OAS1 (F) were measured using RT-qPCR. the experiment was performed three times, and the representative data are shown. icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets had significantly reduced viral shedding on days 3 and 6. there was no mortality in the icPEDV-wt and PEDV-Colorado parental strain infected piglets. we performed histopathologic examination of sections of the small intestine. piglets were inoculated orally with 105 TCID50 of the indicated strain of PEDV. clinical symptoms were graded daily for 7 days. piglets were euthanized at the day 7 time point. three synthetic DNA fragments were generated based on the PEDV-Colorado genomic RNA sequence (28) these synthetic DNAs were used as the template for PCR amplification of five segments that were then cloned into plasmid vector backbones. the promoter sequence of the N gene was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector that carries a T7 promoter sequence. ide into the spike sequence resulted in replacement of aspartic acid by a glycine residue, and the addition of a histidine residue. syncytia-like CPE was detected in vero cells electroporated with the in vitro synthesized RNA. the virus recovered from the supernatant was designated infectious clone wild type, icPEDV-wt, and icPEDV-EnUmt. vero cells infected with supernatant from electroporated cells were fixed at 24 hpi. supernatants from infected cells were collected at indicated time points. TCID50 was calculated using the Reed-Muench method. PK1 cells are a porcine kidney epithelial cell line that has been used for isolating and propagating porcine CoVs. we transfected these cells with a dsRNA mimic, poly(I:C) PK1 cells are capable of detecting and responding to cytoplasmic dsRNA molecules. IFN- mRNA as early as 8 hpi, and IFN-3 at 24 hpi. icPEDV-EnUmt-infected cells were significantly reduced at late times postinfection. PK1 cells were transfected with 200 ng poly(I:C) for 24 h. icPEDV-EnUmt infection induces robust expression of ISGs and proinflammatory cytokines in PK1 cells. PK1 cells were infected with either icPEDV-wt or icPEDV-EnUmt. the experiment was performed three times and the representative data are shown. PEDV replication can be detected in macrophage-like cells. PEDV has also been shown to infect primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro. mRNA levels of ISG54 and OAS1 were significantly increased in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected PAMs compared to those in icPEDV-wt-infected PAMs. these results together indicate that EndoU activity antagonizes the type I IFN response during PEDV infection in primary macrophages. icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets showed similar clinical symptoms. icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets showed slightly reduced clinical scores. icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets showed significantly reduced viral shedding. representative images of ileum sections from an age-matched, uninfected piglet and from one piglet per virus-infected group are shown in Fig. 7 upper panel. to determine if the sites of virus replication were similar in all infected animals, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect PEDV nucleocapsid protein. coronaviruses encode a highly conserved enzyme, EndoU, that mitigates type I and type III IFN responses in virus-infected macrophages and epithelial cells. the loss of EndoU activity correlated with activation of type I and type III IFN responses in macrophages and epithelial cells. the timing of the IFN response is delayed and the magnitude of IFN levels is lower than that in PEDV-EndoU mutant virus infection. the earlier IFN response elicited by icPEDV-EnUmt infection results in the transcription of a series of ISGs that are known to induce an antiviral state. evaluating type III IFN responses in epithelial cells is particularly important for hepatotropic, respiratory, and enterotropic viruses. previous studies revealed cell type specific differences in the innate immune response and the key role of peroxisomes in activating IFN- in response to viral infection. mutagenesis studies have validated the role of the conserved histidine residues as essential for catalytic activity (48\u201350) nsp15/EndoU protein was shown to localize with other nonstructural proteins and viral RNA in the double membrane vesicles that are thought to protect the viral RNA from recognition by pattern recognition receptors. studies of the arterivirus EndoU revealed pleiotropic effects on replication. however, these mutant viruses were evaluated in BHK-21 cells. this virus recently emerged from bats into the swine population in china. there are no vaccines currently available to protect from this infection. the Colorado strain of PEDV (USA/Colorado/2013; GenBank accession number KF272920) was obtained from APHIS-NVSL. to make a large stock, PEDV was propagated once more in Vero cells with maintenance media containing FCS-free growth media. in the PEDV-A fragment, a promoter sequence of T7 RNA polymerase was added upstream from the sequence of the PEDV 5\u2032 untranscribed region (UTR) in the E fragment, two synonymous mutations (A23309G and A23312G) were introduced to disrupt a stretch of six A nucleotides. this insertion resulted in a replacement of aspartate 466 residue with a glycine and a histidine (D466 the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector containing a T7 promoter sequence. the mutated D fragment was combined with the other fragments for generation of an EndoU-deficient PEDV. in a 24-well plate, vero cells were infected with PEDV at a dose of 0.1 TCID50 per cell in the presence of 2 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. after two hours incubation, the inoculum was removed and replaced with vero cell maintenance medium. 3 105 PK1 cells or 6 105 PAMs per well were plated in a 12-well plate 16 h prior to infection. cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with the indicated virus at a dose of 0.1 TCID50 per cell. three pregnant sows free of clinical disease were purchased from a PEDV-negative herd and transported to NADC about 4 weeks prior to farrowing. each sow was placed in a farrowing crate in an isolation room and allowed to farrow naturally. the quantification of viral RNAs in fecal samples has been previously described. each sample was thawed, vortexed for 10 s, and then centrifuged to clarify. slides were deparaffinized using a preprogrammed immunohistochemistry protocol. a veterinary pathologist evaluated sections of small intestine by light microscopy to identify location and subjectively assess villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. PK1 cells were grown in growth medium containing modified Eagle medium (MEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep; HyClone) the Colorado strain of PEDV was propagated once more in vero cells with maintenance media. cDNA clone of PEDV-Colorado strain was titrated on vero cell monolayers. a previously published approach for generation of a reverse genetics system (27) was used to assemble a full-length PEDV cDNA clone. the genome was divided into five fragments (PEDV-A to PEDV-E) recombinant plasmid DNA using restriction sites designated in Fig. 1. all five PEDV fragments were mixed and ligated overnight at 16\u00b0C using T4 DNA ligase (catalog no. M0202L; New England Biolabs) two nucleotides were mutated (C19390G and A19391C) in fragment D to produce a histidine-to-alanine substitution in nsp15. recombinant viral stocks were sent to the Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for full genome sequencing. cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with cold methanol/acetone. fixed cells were then blocked with PBS containing 5% FCS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-N protein monoclonal antibody. samples were assayed in triplicate and data are representative of three independent experiments. levels of mRNA were relative to -actin mRNA and were expressed as 2CT. qPCR primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. at 7 days of age, 8 piglets in each litter were orally inoculated with the indicated virus in a 2-ml volume. clinical diarrhea signs were recorded daily and graded based on severity using the following criteria: 0 = healthy, normal feces; 1 = soft stool; 2 = semiliquid stool; 3 = projectile liquid feces; and 4 = voluminous watery diarrhea. reverse transcription was performed at 45\u00b0C for 10 min and reverse transcriptase denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 45 sec were collected. sequences of probe and primers are listed in Table 1. murine monoclonal antibody SD6-29 specific for the nucleocapsid of PEDV (62) at 1:1,000 dilution. slides were counterstained in hematoxylin and cover slipped."}
