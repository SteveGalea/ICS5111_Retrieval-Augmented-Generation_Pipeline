{"summary": "the damage-response framework (DRF) is based on three assumptions that are self-evident and incontrovertible. the first article was published in 1999 (1), and the concept was further developed in subsequent essays (2\u20135) 11 attributes affect the outcome of host-microbe interaction: microbiome, inoculum, sex, temperature, environment, age, chance, history, immunity, nutrition, and genetics. the first letters of these attributes can be assembled into the acronym MISTEACHING, which conveys the additional meaning that teaching microbial pathogenesis is difficult. the composite of factors for a given host is almost certainly unique and specific to that host. the use of antimicrobial drugs is known to be associated with the development of certain infectious diseases, such as colitis and candidiasis, through disruption of the host-associated microbiome. microbiome bacteria produce antifungal compounds that reduce susceptibility to fungal pathogens. each host is likely to have a different microbiome, since the microbiota species composition and diversity can be affected by and change with time, diet, health, and disease. recognizing the impact of disease states, such as diabetes and malnutrition, and perturbations of the microbiome on immune function is critical for assessing risk for infectious diseases. many infectious diseases exhibit marked differences in the frequency at which they affect the sexes (23) the mechanisms responsible for sex-related differences in susceptibility include anatomical, hormonal, and immune differences (23, 24). frog eggs have increased susceptibility to fungal infection after exposure to deicing salts (33), fish exposed to herbicide glyphosate are more susceptible to bacterial infection (34), and daphnia exposed to pesticides become rapidly resistant to the chemical. climate change may have effects on host, microbe, and vectors that transmit microbes that may in turn affect susceptibility to infectious diseases (36\u201338) the attribute of age incorporates the element of time, as the immune response changes over time from ontogeny to puberty to adulthood to senescence. in some instances, susceptibility reflects exuberant inflammatory responses, which in turn may be age related. age is also an important variable in affecting risk though the environment. a prior immune response to a microbe can affect host susceptibility and resistance to the same microbe as well as other microbes. infection with one serotype of dengue virus predisposes to hemorrhagic disease upon infection with a different serotype. infection with one arbovirus can influence the immune response to another. a major factor influencing susceptibility is the microbial inoculum, which has been known to be a determinant of the outcome of infection since the earliest days of the germ theory. a major factor influencing susceptibility is the microbial inoculum, which has been known to be a determinant of the outcome of infection since the earliest days. vaccines have been proposed to neutralize the infecting inoculum so that the immune response of the host is able to reduce the effectiveness of the inoculum to the point that no disease develops. nutrition is critical for homeostasis, and nutritional deficits are likely to have protean effects on physiology, including immune function. iron overload is known to predispose to Yersinia enterocolitica (56) in mice, major histocompatibility loci have been associated with susceptibility to theiler's virus (60), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (61), and Rickettsia conorii (62), to name a few. some human genetic diseases, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, have been associated with resistance to certain microbes. metabolome and microbiome are linked, with the latter providing the fuel for generation of important biomolecules. the ability of the microbiome to determine host susceptibility to disease was established in insects by showing that the ability of Bacillus thuringiensis to kill gypsy moth larvae was dependent on the presence of certain gut bacteria. a report that human susceptibility to Campylobacter is associated with certain microbiome compositions (15) recognizing the impact of disease states, such as diabetes and malnutrition, and perturbations of the microbiome on immune function is critical for assessing the contribution of immune impairment to risk for infectious diseases. recognizing the impact of disease states, such as diabetes and malnutrition, and perturbations of the microbiome on immune function is unequivocally associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases. frog eggs have increased susceptibility to fungal infection after exposure to deicing salts (33), fish exposed to the herbicide glyphosate are more susceptible to bacterial infection (34) frog eggs have increased susceptibility to fungal infection after exposure to deicing salts (33), fish exposed to the herbicide glyphosate are more susceptible to bacterial infection (34), and daphnia exposed to pesticides become rapidly resistant to the chemical. climate change may have effects on host, microbe, and vectors that transmit microbes that may in turn affect susceptibility to infectious diseases (36\u201338) the attribute of environment also includes social, political, and psychological factors that influence the conditions under which individuals and populations live. chance can affect susceptibility in its own right as well as by affecting other variables. an unexpected encounter with a rabid animal reflects chance. risk can emerge as an unintended consequence of construction and curiosity. infection with one arbovirus can influence the immune response to another (45) this phenomenon is a variation on the concept of \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d. new tools for dissecting the antibody response have made it possible to identify defined antibodies that bind an originally encountered (priming) microbe and have beneficial functional activity against the newly acquired microbe (47). a toxigenic encapsulated bacterium such as Bacillus anthracis causes kill mice at much lower doses than other bacteria lacking those characteristics (50). a toxigenic encapsulated bacterium such as Bacillus anthracis is able to cause kill mice at much lower doses than other bacteria lacking those characteristics (50). a toxigenic encapsulated bacterium such as Bacillus anthracis is able to cause kill mice at much cystis pneumonia was first described in association with malnourished infants. malnourished infants are also more susceptible to life-threatening diarrheal diseases. iron overload is known to predispose to Yersinia enterocolitica (56) iron overload is known to predispose to Yersinia enterocolitica (56) the basic relationship of the DRF is depicted by a parabola with damage on the y axis and host response on the x axis. the central concept in the DRF is that all host-microbe interactions have the potential to result in a host response. here we illustrate how the basic relationship applies to individuals and, by the aggregate of individual relationships, to populations. the line for disease threshold denotes a point at which host damage is sufficient to affect homeostasis. the line for disease threshold denotes those with and without clinical symptoms. the line for disease threshold denotes those with and without clinical symptoms. the majority of individuals who acquire S. cerevisiae suffer no clinical symptoms. disease can occur at the extremes of the immune response. strong responses produce tissue damage from allergy and severe inflammatory responses. host 1 is an individual with asymptomatic latent tuberculosis who responds to antimicrobial therapy combined with gamma interferon. in contrast, Host 3 represents a case of tuberculous meningitis, where inflammation contributes to damage. host 3 has tuberculous meningitis, a condition where the inflammatory response is a major contributor to brain damage. the treatment reduces the host response and moves the individual to the right, resulting in cure. DT, disease threshold. HCV-human interactions. the original six curves (1) were derived by tipping the parabola toward the left or right. each host-microbe interaction produces its own distinct parabolic curve, which is a derivative of the basic parabola. the original curves (1) remain useful for understanding host-microbe relationships for specific microbes. the three curves (A to C) can denote the damage-response relationships of a single microbe with three host or those of a single host with three different microbes. each interaction has the potential to cause sufficient damage to cross the disease threshold. for curve A, the vertex lies on the axis during intermediate responses, resulting in an interaction where no damage occurs. S. cerevisiae is also a cause of fungal vaginitis in certain women. disease can occur at the extremes of the immune response. weak responses allow invasion, whereas strong responses produce tissue damage. tuberculosis has protean disease manifestations which include caseous necrosis in the lung following a strong inflammatory response. the name comes from the radiologic appearance of small granulomas in the lung. each individual will have a different MISTEACHING composite. the interaction of each individual with M. tuberculosis can be plotted on the DRF parabola. infection with HIV results in a damaged immune system that cannot contain the latent infection, which disseminates. treatment with antiretroviral therapy restores immunity, which attacks host tissues where residual mycobacterial antigens are found to cause the immune reconstitution syndrome. the original six curves were derived by tipping the parabola toward the left or right. each host-microbe interaction produces its own distinct parabolic curve, which is a derivative of the basic parabola. the original curves (1) remain useful for understanding host-microbe relationships for specific microbes and disease syndromes. different host-microbe interactions result in different damage-response relationships. the three curves (A to C) can denote the damage-response relationships of a single microbe with three host or those of a single host with three different microbes. each interaction has the potential to cause sufficient damage to cross the disease threshold. a person without immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases has a high likelihood of acquiring these viruses and exhibiting disease after an exposure. this is why herd protection is so important to maintain protection against vaccine-preventable diseases that are further prevented by herd immunity. this is why herd protection is so important to maintain protection against vaccine-preventable diseases that are further prevented by herd immunity. assessing risk for disease as a function of the attributes of MISTEACHING provides a roadmap for a rational assessment of susceptibility in individuals and populations. however, the attributes of MISTEACHING include attributes that are interrelated, such as genetics, age, nutrition, microbiome, and immunity."}
