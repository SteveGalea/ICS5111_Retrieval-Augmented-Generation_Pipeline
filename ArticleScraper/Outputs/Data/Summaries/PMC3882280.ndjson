{"summary": "canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) is a multifactorial disease affecting dogs of all ages. novel viruses are being continuously associated with CIRD occurrence in dogs. these include canine influenza virus [5], canine distemper virus [3] and canine parainfluenza virus [4]. the full-length genome of a prototype strain was determined and analysed in comparison with American strains and other pneumoviruses. the study did not involve any animal experiment. only sample collection from naturally infected dogs was carried out. modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1000 IU/ml penicillin, 1000 g/ml streptomycin and 10 g/ml amphotericin B. RNA Extraction Aliquots of the nasal and pharyngeal swab extracts were combined and clarified by centrifuging at 2,500g for 10 min. assay Reference Primer/probe Sequence 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 Polarity Targetgene Positiona Ampliconsize Real-timeRT-PCR. a real-time RT-PCR assay based on the TaqMan technology was developed for the rapid detection and quantification of the CnPnV RNA. Virus Isolation Attempts CnPnV positive samples were inoculated into semiconfluent canine fibroma (A-72) cells. inoculated cells were maintained in D-MEM supplemented with 5% FCS and monitored daily for the occurrence of cytopathic effect. PCR amplicons were cloned and consensus sequences were elaborated using at least three clones per fragment. cDNAs were amplified using a 5\u2032 RACE kit (5\u2032 RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Invitrogen srl), following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. metapneumovirus human metapneumovirus (HMPV) CAN97-83 (NC_004148) was used as outgroup. full-length genome of the CnPnV strain dog/Bari/100-12/ITA/2012 was deposited in GenBank. in 2012, 37 out of 350 housed dogs were vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper (CDV), canine adenoviruses (CAdVs) and leptospira spp.. no specific vaccine for prophylaxis of CIRD was employed. no specific vaccine for prophylaxis of CIRD was employed. canine Pneumovirus Detection and Quantification All RNA extracts were subjected to a previously-established RT-PCR assay for detection of CnPnV RNA [14], with minor modifications. a one-step method was adopted using superscriptTM One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates (Invitrogen srl, Milan, Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. a real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the rapid detection and quantification of the CnPnV RNA in all clinical samples. the thermal profile consisted of incubation with UDG at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and activation of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 2 min. after 6 days of incubation, the monolayers were tested for CnPnV antigen by an immunotherapy. the cells were sub-cultured every 6\u20138 days for 5 consecutive passages. RT-PCR products obtained with primer pair SH1F/SH187R were subjected to direct sequencing at the BaseClear B.V. phylogenetic trees based on the 8,598 nucleotide (nt) fragment available for extant CnPnVs and on the amino acid sequences of nucleocapsid (N) and fusion (F) proteins were elaborated using both parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. following Pneumovirus reference strains were used for phylogeny. canine pantropic coronavirus [23]\u2013[24], canine minute virus [26], canine hepacivirus [28], canine bocaviruses [9], Bordetelella bronchiseptica [29], Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus [30], Bordetelella bronchiseptica [29], Bordetelella bronchiseptica [29], canine bocavirus the genome of strain dog/Bari/100-12/ITA/2012 (Bari/100-12) was 14,884 nucleotides (nt) in length. the same genomic organization was found as in MPV with the gene order 3\u2032-NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L-5\u2032. all sequences are shown in the negative genome sense from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032. the full-length genome of the Italian CnPnV strain displayed the highest nt identity (95.7\u201395.8%) to MPV. the genetic relatedness to HRSV and BRSV was less than 50%. nt identity to other members of the genus Pnuemovirus ranged from 68.2% (HRSV) to 83.3% (MPV/J3666) only the 5\u2032-end 25 nt had been sequenced for reference CnPnV strains showing a 100% identity to the same stretch of the leader region. a conserved 5\u2032-end stretch of 12 nt was found among all pneumoviruses analysed with the exception of the fourth position where HRSV and BRSV exhibited the substitution G to A. non-translated regions were found to be located between the protein coding regions, including gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) sequences that define the transcriptional boundaries on the negative strand template. the former protein showed only 1 aa variation in comparison to extant CnPnVs. 10 substitutions were encountered in the NS2 polypeptide. 1 187 36 D G G G NS2 507 12 V I I I I 555 28 G S S G G 570 33 V M M V V 672 67 W R R W 774 101 A S S S S S S S S S 816 115 E K K E E E 832 120 V E E V V 876 135 V I I I I 899 142 P L L P P 939 156 N D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D the phosphoprotein (P) gene had the same length (907 nt) as for reference CnPnVs. the nt identity was 97.4% against other CnPnVs and 94.8\u201395.6% against MPVs. the putative M protein was 257 aa long and exhibited approximately the same aa identity (98.1\u201398.5%) with canine and murine strains. the genetic distance to MPVs was higher in the SH gene than in other regions. the aa identities to strain CnPnV-Bari/100-12 ranged from 91.9% (MPV/J3666) to 97.1% (CnPnV/Ane4). however, when recent CnPnVs were included, the aa identities varied from 89.6% to 95.9%. in strain bari/100-12, this gene was 926 nt long and shared a 96.4% and 95.1% nt identity with other CnPnVs and MPVs. the genetic relatedness was higher to HPMV (46.2% nt identity) than to HRSV/BRSV (44.6\u201345%). maximum parsimony trees are based on the 8,598-nt fragment spanning from the very 3\u2032 end of the L gene to the 5\u2032end of the leader region (genome sense) strain CnPnV/Bari/100-12 clustered with other CnPnV isolates and with the murine strain J3666, whereas MPV/15 was more distantly related. a 100% nucleotide (nt) identity was found between the two detected CnPnV strains. the dogs were confirmed to be infected by CnPnV, displaying discrete viral titers. no other respiratory pathogens were detected in the analyzed samples. genes are shown as rectangle, with shaded bars at each end representing the gene-start (lighter shading) and gene-end (darker shading) transcription signals. horizontal line represents the extargenic regions, specifically the 3\u2032-leader (Le), 5\u2032-trailer (Tr) and intergenic regions. leaderregion NS1 NS2 N P M SH G F M2 L Trailerregion Full-lengthgenome 8598-ntfragment CnPnV/Brne17 (GU247050) NA 94.7 94.7 97.2 97.4 96.8 95.5 96.4 97.4 96.4 N.A. the 14 nt at the 3\u2032 end were conserved among pneumoviruses. the nt identity was very high to MPV isolates (94.5\u201395.6%) no comparison was possible with the analogous sequences of CnPnV strains Brne17 and Ane4 (that had not been determined) the same genes were shorter for MPV/J3666. HRSV and BRSV had longer NS1 (532 and 527 nt, respectively) and shorter NS2 sequences (502 and 494 nt, respectively) in these genomic regions gene strain bari/100-12 was closely related to other CnPnVs. 98.3 97.8 91.9 98.3 97.7 96.9 98.5 HRSV/B1 (NC_001803) 14.8 16.7 59 33.1 41 15.7 8.9 40.4 42.1 13.3 49.9 BRSV/ATue51908 (NC_001989) 11.9 18.1 59.5 36.2 41 16.1 13.2 41.6 42.1 14.3 49.1 NA, sequence not available. the phosphoprotein (P) gene was 1,220 nt long as for extant CnPnVs. the nt identity in this region ranged from 60% for BRSV to 97.2% for CnPnV/Brne17. the nt identity was 97.4% against other CnPnVs and 94.8\u201395.6% against MPVs. the major polypeptide of strain bari/100-12 displays the best aa identity (99.7%) against other canine isolates. the analogous gene of HRSV and BRSV was 412 and 494 nt shorter. the genetic relatedness to other canine isolates was slightly higher with respect to MPVs (94.1\u201394.4%) nt identities to other CnPnVs were slightly higher than to MPVs. in the encoded protein (537 aa) the aa identities were approximately equal for canine and murine strains. phylogeny was first constructed on the 8,598-nt fragment spanning from the very 3\u2032 end of the L gene to the 5\u2032end of the leader region. the nt identity against murine strains was 96.6\u201396.7%. in this region, the nt identity against murine strains was 96.6\u201396.7%. the 8,598-nt fragment spanning from the 3\u2032 end of the L gene to the 5\u2032end of the leader region (A), nucleocapsid (B) and fusion (C) proteins. the distantly-related Metapneumovirus human metapneumovirus (HMPV) CAN97-83 (NC_004148) was used as outgroup. a statistical support was provided by bootstrapping over 1,000 replicates. antibodies were detected in certain species of wild voles and mice and in wild grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) if the mouse virus circulates in the field, there are several chances for its species jump to the canine host. in this scenario, kenneled dogs should be highly exposed to the cross-species transmission. recent reports of natural infections in dogs and experimental infections in mice have suggested its potential role in the occurrence of CIRD. additional evidence has been obtained during an epidemiological survey carried out in the united kingdom [35]."}
