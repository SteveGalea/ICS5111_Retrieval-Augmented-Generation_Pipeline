{"summary": "the site of infection and access of neutralizing antibody (Ab) contribute to viral control during both primary and secondary infections. this is particularly important in the central nervous system (CNS), which is a target for numerous acute encephalitic viral infections. both virus strains cause acute encephalomyelitis that resolves into a persistent infection associated with chronic, ongoing immune-mediated myelin loss (23, 25). control of infectious virus in the CNS is T cell mediated (26\u201328), continuously produced antiviral IgG within the CNS is required to prevent viral recrudescence (4, 24, 29). the parenchymal accumulation of ASC in wild-type (WT) mice was directly linked to the predominant CXCL10 expression by astrocytes, while CXCL9 expression was confined to the microvasculature. these results demonstrate a prominent, nonredundant role of CXCL10 in both ASC recruitment and entry into the inflamed CNS parenchyma during viral encephalomyelitis. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using a 7500 fast real-time PCR system. PCR conditions were 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. the PCR conditions were 20 s at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 3 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. the transcript levels were calculated relative to the levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. ated goat anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) secondary Ab was detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) followed by 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB reagent set; BD Bioscience) viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in paraffin-embedded sections by immunoperoxidase staining using anti-JHMV mouse monoclonal Ab (MAb) J.3.3. sections were scored in a blinded manner, and representative fields identified based on the average score of all sections in each experimental group. clonal Ab overnight at 4\u00b0C, slides incubated for 1 h at room temperature. cells were isolated from pooled brains (3 or 4 mice per time point) mice were infected at 6 to 7 weeks of age by intracranial injection with 1,000 PFU of the gliatropic JHMV variant (34). animals were scored daily for clinical signs of disease as follows: 0, healthy; 1, ruffled fur and hunched back; 2, hind limb paralysis or inability to turn to upright position; 3, complete hind limb paralysis and wasting; and 4, moribund or dead. real-time primers for transcripts encoding a proliferating-inducing ligand (APRIL), B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BCMA), interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-21, transmembrane activator and calcium modulator ligand interactor (TACI), CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CX the levels of virus-specific IgG within the CNS were determined in clarified spinal cord supernatants by ELISA as described previously. 96-well plates were coated with 100 l of a serum-free supernatant derived from JMHV-infected DBT cells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. triplicates of serial 2-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum from individual mice (n = 5) were incubated with 50 PFU of JHMV in 96-well plates for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. the neutralization titers represent the log10 of the highest average serum dilution that inhibited cytopathic effect. longitudinal sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, treated with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature, blocked for 30 min, and then stained with rabbit anti-mouse laminin. sections were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), or anti-JHMV monoclonal Ab overnight at 4\u00b0C. cell numbers were calculated based on cell yields and percentages of gated live cells. a P value of 0.05, determined by the unpaired t test, was considered significant. RESULTS Impaired Ab production within the CNS of CXCL10/ mice. by day 21 p.i., mRNA increased further, by 10-fold, in WT and CXCL9/ mice but only reached 25% of the WT values in CXCL10/ mice. expression of receptors that support ASC survival and differentiation, namely, BCMA and TACI (39\u201342), were also upregulated at day 21 p.i. in infected WT and CXCL9/ mice. ab production within the CNS is impaired in the absence of CXCL10. n = 5 individual mice per time point per experiment. ates at day 21 p.i. were assessed by ELISA. significant differences between WT and CXCL9/ or CXCL10/ mice are denoted as follows: **, P 0.005;***, P 0.001 NS, not significant. all involved in regulating B cell movement within lymphoid tissue and ectopic follicles were also assessed within the CNS. infection increased CXCL19 mRNA to a similar extent in all groups. but mRNA expression of CXCL13 was 10- to 20-fold higher in both CXCL9/ and CXCL10/ mice. transcripts encoding APRIL and BAFF (39, 40, 45\u201347) were assessed. XCL9/, and CXCL10/ mice were assessed by real-time PCR. significant differences between WT and CXCL9/ or CXCL10/ mice are denoted as follows: *, P 0.05;***, P 0.001 NS, not significant (P > 0.05). despite 5-fold increased viral titers in CXCL10/ mice at day 7 p.i., infectious virus was controlled with similar kinetics and efficiency in all groups by day 21 p.i. the analysis of spinal cords further revealed reductions of viral RNA in WT, CXCL9/, and CXCL10/ mice by day 21 p.i. nucleocapsid mRNA in spinal cords was determined by real-time PCR. data are the means SEM relative to GAPDH mRNA of two or three independent experiments with at least 3 mice per time point per experiment. differential in vivo recruitment may therefore be attributed to distinct quantities or localization. astrocyte-mediated CXCL10 expression may provide a stronger signal at the glia limitans to attract ASC into the parenchyma. spinal cords from JHMV-infected mice were analyzed for chemokine expression prior to the emergence of ASC at day 14 p.i (12, 30, 36) CXCL10 expression was indeed most prominently expressed in GFAP+ astrocytes at day 7 p.i., with limited expression by Iba n = 3 individual mice per time point. BD, below detection level. CXCL10 is identified with anti-CXCL10 Ab staining (red) DAPI staining (blue) was used to identify cell nuclei. spinal cords of persistently infected mice were analyzed for frequency and distribution of ASC. the number and distribution of CD138+ ASC were similar when comparing. longitudinal sections of spinal cords from infected mice at day 21 p.i. analyzed for CD138+ cells and laminin. CD138+ cells were identified with anti-CD138 Ab (green) laminin was visualized with antilaminin Ab (red) DAPI staining (blue) was used to identify cell nuclei. the ongoing viral control in the CNS of infected CXCL10/ mice differs from the lack of control in CXCR3/ mice. despite significantly impaired ASC accumulation, IgG was 6-fold higher in CXCL10/ than in CXCR3/ mice at 21 days p.i. s declined more slowly in the absence of CXCL10. notably, however, infectious virus remained below detection in CXCL10/ mice. local CNS Ab production is less impaired in CXCL10/ mice than in CXCR3/ mice. 57BL/6 mice were analyzed for humoral responses in the periphery and CNS. gliatropic-JHMV-infected CXCL9/ and CXCL10/ mice were analyzed. neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10 deficiency affected peripheral ASC activation. kinetics of mRNA expression thus indicated similar ASC recruitment in WT and CXCL9/ mice but lagging levels in the absence of CXCL10. viro-specific IgM and IgG levels were similar between WT and CXCL9/ mice. significant differences between WT and CXCL9/ or CXCL10/ mice are denoted as follows: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.005; **, P 0.005; **, P 0.005; **, P 0.001. NS, not significant (P > 0.05). CXCL9 mRNA was 50% lower in infected CXCL10/ mice than in infected WT mice at day 7 p.i. but relative difference in CXCL9 expression subsequently diminished. indistinguishable CXCL9 mRNA in infected CXCL10/ and WT mice by day 21 p.i., peak of ASC CNS accumulation (12, 24, 30, 36) transcripts encoding APRIL and BAFF (39, 40, 45\u201347) were assessed. transcripts encoding APRIL and BAFF (39, 40, 45\u201347) were assessed. expression of chemokines and survival factors involved in B cell and ASC regulation is not altered in the absence of CXCL9 or CXCL10. anti-CXCL10 Ab treatment reduced T cell recruitment following a heterologous coronavirus infection. however, CXCR3 deficiency did not impair T cell accumulation or initial viral control in the CNS. despite 5-fold increased viral titers in CXCL10/ mice at day 7 p.i., infectious virus was controlled with similar kinetics and efficiency in all groups. the onset of encephalomyelitis and clinical disease were similar in all groups. these data demonstrate that CXCL10 promotes early virus control. neither the absence of CXCL9 nor that of CXCL10 significantly impairs antiviral function in the CNS prior to ASC accumulation. RNA expression was 3-fold higher than CXCL9 mRNA in the CNS of WT mice at day 7 p.i., but mRNA levels were similar at days 14 and 21 p.i. chemokine secretion is rapidly reduced and/or extracellular chemokine is bound by surrounding matrix or consumed. day 10 p.i., coinciding with initial ASC recruitment, was still detectable at day 21 p.i. notably, during viral persistence at day 21 p.i., CD138+ ASC located proximal to CXCL10+ astrocytes. the absence of CXCL10 expression by virus-infected cells supported sparse astrocyte infection (55) and IFN-mediated CXCL10 expression. spinal cord sections from infected WT mice at day 7 p.i. were analyzed for CXCL10 expression (A to C, left) CXCL10 is identified with anti-CXCL10 Ab staining (red) DAPI staining (blue) was used to identify cell nuclei. few CD138+ ASC were confined to the vasculature, often in small clusters. reduced numbers of ASC, as well as vascular retention in the CNS of CXCL10/ mice, suggest that CXCL10 is instrumental not only in recruiting ASC but also in mediating their migration into the parenchyma. neither the absence of CXCL9 nor that of CXCL10 affected the localization of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells within the CNS during virus-induced encephalomyelitis. the numbers of virally infected cells and their distribution were also comparable in WT and CXCL10/ mice (data not shown), consistent with the similar viral mRNA (Fig. 3). CNS expression of IgG and -light chain mRNA was increased 5- and 8-fold, respectively, in CXCL10/ versus CXCR3/ infected mice. these data indicate that virus-specific IgG coincides with total Ig mRNA expression. the low, yet elevated levels of virus-specific IgG in CXCL10/ versus CXCR3/ mice were monitored during persistence. ELISA assessed homogenates of infected WT, CXCL10/, and CXCR3/ mice at day 21 p.i. significant differences between WT and CXCL10/ mice are denoted as follows: ###, P 0.001. CR3 ligand CXCL10 regulated CXCR3-mediated ASC recruitment to the CNS following a gliatropic coronavirus infection. the absence of CXCL10 diminished overall ASC recruitment but trapped the few migrating ASC within the CNS vasculature. the preferential CNS recruitment of ASC by CXCL10 rather than CXCL9 correlated with their distinct localization patterns. astrocytes may be the main CXCL10 producers, irrespective of virus tropism. in contrast to CXCL10, CXCL9 was only detected in the microvasculature. this observation is consistent with CXCL9 detection on endothelial cells during cerebral malaria (61), as well as vascular localization in Rickettsia rickettsii infection and primary CNS lymphoma (22, 62). elevated CXCL13 in both CXCL9/ and CXCL10/ but not CXCR3/ infected mice (24) was surprising, as CXCL13 upregulation is associated with ectopic follicle formation and ASC accumulation during neuroborreliosis. however, we did not detect ectopic follicle-like structures. confined localization of T cells to white matter may limit disease severity.
