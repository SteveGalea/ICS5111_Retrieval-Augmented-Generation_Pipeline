{"summary": "the definite diagnosis of tuberculosis pleural effusions depends on the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, pleural fluid, or pleural biopsy specimens. however, measurement of IFN- in the pleural fluid has gained wide acceptance in the diagnosis of TB pleural effusions. a significant increase in CD69 expression on CD4+ T cells in PFCs. phenotypic analysis of CD69-expressing cells strongly suggested that CD69 could be a useful marker for identification or enrichment of antigen specific Th1 cells at local sites following MTB infection. significantly higher expression of CD69 on CD4+ T cells in PFCs from patients with TBP without any stimulation. expression of CD69 on CD4+ T cells was determined by FACS in PBMCs from healthy donors. CD69 expression on HD (n = 22), PTB (n = 21) and PFCs (n = 50) each symbol represents a value from a single donor. the expression of each marker within the CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69 T cell subsets is shown by the dotted line. expression of T-bet and IL-12R2 was evaluated on CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69 T cells by flow cytometry. expression of T-bet (B) and IL-12R2 (C) on CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69 T cells derived from five independent experiments are represented. stimulation of PFCs with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides resulted in increased surface CD69 expression that is difficult to elucidate IL-2 or TNF--producing CD4+CD69+ T cells were significantly higher than those for CD4+CD69 T cells (P0.001, Fig 3C). we also stimulated PFCs from tuberculous pleurisy patients with other irrelevant antigens such as SARS-CoV S peptides (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) and (NFSQILPDPLKPTK RSFI) CD4+CD69+, CD4+CD69 and total CD4+ T cells simultaneously produced IFN-, IL-2 and TNF-. compared expression of IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- in CD4+CD69+, CD4+CD69 and total CD4+ T cells after short-term in vitro stimulation. the percentages of double expressers were similar within CD4+CD69+, CD4+CD69 and total CD4+ T cells. however, polyfunctional T cells were primarily enriched within CD4+CD69+ T cells. significant positive correlation between CD4+CD69+ T cells and polyfunctional T cells was observed. CD4+CD69+ T cells were mostly effector memory T cells. the majority of CD4+CD69+ T cells showed a CD45RACCR7CD62LCD27 effector memory cell phenotype. the expression of memory markers CD45RA, CCR7, CD62L and CD27 was overlaid with CD4+CD69+IFN-+ cells. the expression of each marker within CD4+CD69+IFN-+ T cells was overlaid with CD4+CD69+IFN-+ T cells. significantly higher levels of IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- were produced by CD4+CD69+ cells than by CD4+CD69 T cells. CD69 expression provides a means to identify the vast majority of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells regardless of the type of cytokine measured. the frequencies of IFN-, IL-2 or TNF--producing CD4+CD69+ (closed circles) or CD4+CD69 T cells (open circles, n = 3\u20135) are demonstrated. the majority of CD4+CD25+ T cells expressed Foxp3(Data not shown), the specific marker for this subset. CD4+CD25+ cells inhibit production of Th1 cytokines by sorted CD4+CD69+ cells. production of IFN- and TNF- by sorted CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69+ cells was assessed by ELISA. %, mean SD) on CD4+ T cells were observed in 78% of the PFCs from individuals with TBP than on PBMCs of PTB or HD (1.48%1.60% for healthy donors and 1.38%1.68% for TB patients, mean SD). no significant difference in CD69 expression was observed on PBMCs from PTB and from HD (Fig 1B, P = ns) more than 90% of CD4+CD69+ T cells expressed T-bet. about 57.24% of CD4+CD69 T cells expressed T-bet. expression of IL-12R2 was significantly higher than that on CD4+CD69 T cells. we aimed to examine whether direct ex vivo evaluation of surface expression of CD69 without in vitro upregulation permits direct assessment of MTB-specific Th1 cells. stimulation of PFCs with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides resulted in increased surface CD69 expression that is difficult to elucidate. short-term stimulation of these cells includes incubation with secretion inhibitory brefeldin A (BFA), which can block the transport of newly synthesized CD69 molecules to CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69 T cells expressed high levels of IFN-, IL-2 and TNF-. however, after stimulation with peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10, CD4+CD69+ and total CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of IFN-, IL-2 and TNF-. the total antigen-specific responses were defined as the percentages of T cells expressing any combination of IFN-, IL-2 or TNF-. Interestingly, polyfunctional T cells (IFN-/IL-2/TNF- triple expressers) dominated the CD4+CD69+ T cell response. cells were gated on CD4+CD69+IFN-+ and CD4+CD69+IFN- cells. representative expression of TNF- and IL-2 within gated cells is shown. the numbers in each quadrant represent the percentages of positive cells in gated cells. the majority of CD4+CD69+ T cells displayed a CD45RACCR7CD62LCD27 effector memory cell phenotype. the majority of CD4+CD69+ T cells showed a CD45RACCR7CD62LCD27 effector memory cell phenotype. each marker within CD4+CD69+IFN-+ T cells was overlaid with CD4+CD69+IFN-+ T cells. the numbers indicate the percentage of cells among CD4+CD69+IFN-+ T cells. CD69 expression provides a means to identify the vast majority of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, regardless of the type of cytokine measured. CD4+CD69+ and CD4+CD69+ cells were sorted from magnetic bead-purified CD4+ T cells. sorted CD4+CD69+ or CD4+CD25+ T cells expressed Foxp3(Data not shown) the majority of CD4+CD25+ T cells expressed Foxp3(Data not shown) the result demonstrated that neither IFN- nor TNF- was produced by the CD4+CD25+ T cells, whereas CD4+CD69+ T cells produced large amounts of IFN- and TNF- upon coculture. CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD69+ cells were cultured at different ratios and cocultured with purified CD14+ cells in the presence or absence of P1\u2013P6. cytokine production was assessed by ELISA. IGRAs are based on the principle that individuals sensitized with TB antigens produce IFN- when they re-encounter highly MTB-specific antigens such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10. however, this assay precludes further analysis because it is lethal to cells. CD4+CD69+ T cells from same patients with tuberculous pleurisy expressed high levels of IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- indicating that the response was MTB-specific. detection of CD69 is useful for the direct identification of MTB-specific Th1 cells in vivo without further stimulation. a previous study has indicated that CD4+CD69+CD25 cells represented a new subset of regulatory T cells in the tumor model [41] these CD4+CD69+CD25 cells are hyporesponsive and can suppress proliferation of CD4+ T cells in a cell-to-cell contact manner. in our study, however, CD4+CD69+ T cells represented effector or effector memory cells and quickly produced large amounts of cytokines following short-term stimulation. the suppressive effect of Treg cells on IFN- production by CD4+CD25+ T cells[43] and T cells[48] was mainly mediated via the release of IL-10 but not TGF-. the majority of CD4+CD69+ T cells but not total CD4+ T cells, were dominated by polyfunctional T cells. twenty-one patients (10 females and 11 males, range 20 to 50 years of age) with active pulmonary tuberculosis were also included in this study. none of the patients was receiving MTB-related treatments at the time of the study. purified anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2) and anti-CD49d (clone 9F10) mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA) the following mAbs were used for phenotypic and intracellular cytokine analysis. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation of heparinized venous blood obtained from healthy individuals or TB patients. Flow cytometry was performed using BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) purified CD4+CD69+, CD4+CD69 and CD4+CD25+ cells were co-cultured with purified CD14+ cells. cell-free supernatants were collected and assessed for IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- production by ELISA kits. study participants a total of fifty patients with tuberculous pleurisy (15 females and 35 males, range 18\u201371 years of age) were recruited from the Chest Hospital of Guangzhou, China. twenty-one patients (10 females and 11 males, range 20 to 50 years of age) with active pulmonary tuberculosis were also included in this study. peptides of 20 amino acids (aa) in length were obtained from shenzhen Hanyu manufacture, Shenzhen, China. the sequences of the peptides are as follows: P1, ESAT-61\u201320 (MTEQQWNFAGIEAAASAIQG); P2, ESAT-631\u201350. CD27-APC (O323) was obtained from Biolegend (San Diego, CA) affinipure F(ab')2 fragment donkey anti-rat IgG (H+L) was purchased from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA) surface markers were first stained and cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde. expression of IL-12R2 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. cells were incubated with mAb for IL-12R2, followed by biotin-SP-conjugated anti-rat IgG F(ab')2 fragments. cell-free supernatants were collected and assessed for IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- production by ELISA kits (BD Bioscience Pharmingen) cells were cultured for 8 hours and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis."}
