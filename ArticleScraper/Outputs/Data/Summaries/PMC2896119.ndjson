{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has become a popular approach by utilizing genome-wide genotyping array to map susceptibility effects through examining associations between SNP genotype frequency and traits (1,2) the standard GWAS analysis focuses on single SNP/gene and identifies only a number of the most significant SNPs that account for only a small proportion of the genetic variants. it also ignores the combined SNP/gene effects representing interactions of multiple genetic i-GSEA has improved sensitivity to identify pathways/gene sets representing combined effects of possibly modest SNPs/genes. there have been more than 480 GWAS publications covering a broad range of human diseases available by the end of January 2010. in i-GSEA, we implement SNP label permutation instead of phenotype label permutation to correct gene and gene set variation. i-GSEA trends to pick up pathways/gene sets including a high proportion of significant genes. this ensures i-GSEA the improved sensitivity. i-GSEA4GWAS is freely available and there is no registration required. we also provide a template program for users to access our web server through command lines instead of web browser. i-GSEA4GWAS contains an optional multiple-level broad-to-narrow SNPs->genes mapping system. it helps users either fully explore genome-wide SNP data (by choosing \u2018500-kb upstream and downstream of gene\u2019) or narrow down the research scope by only focusing on functional SNPs. 4GWAS output is the Manhattan plot of gene set. it highlights the results of association test for a given pathway/gene set. the result page also contains the download URL, from where all the results can be downloaded. pathway \u2018st myocyte ad pathway\u2019 (FDR = 0.047) contains a variety of adrenergic receptors that induce subtype-specific signaling effects. the top gene with the smallest P-value in this gene set, ITPR1 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, type 1), has been reported to interact with genes in HIV. there is no pathway/gene set found with FDR 0.05 or FDR 0.25 by using GSEA with the same parameters. i-GSEA is an application and extension of GSEA. significant genes are defined as the genes mapped with at least one of the top 5% of all SNPs. i-GSEA trends to pick up pathways/gene sets including a high proportion of significant genes. this ensures i-GSEA the improved sensitivity. collection of pathways/gene sets used in i-GSEA4GWAS is extracted and curated from MSigDB v2.5 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/) to ensure comprehensiveness and high quality. includes gene sets denoting canonical pathways integrated from a variety of online resources like KEGG (19) and BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com/), and GO (gene ontology) major histocompatibility complex/extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC/xMHC) region (22) to only explore the non-MHC/xMHC region (22) to restrain gene set size to avoid overly narrow or overly broad functional categories and too large a search space. i-GSEA4GWAS performs i-GSEA to identify pathways/gene sets correlated with traits. a total of 23 pathways/gene sets were identified to be possibly correlated with the trait (FDR 0.25) five pathways namely \u2018antigen processing and presentation\u2019, \u2018inflampathway\u2019, \u2018cskpathway\u2019, \u2018ribosome\u2019 and \u2018st myocyte ad pathway\u2019 have high confidence (FDR 0.05) i-GSEA4GWAS identified two pathways/gene sets (FDR 0.05) by using the default \u2018500 kb upstream and downstream of gene\u2019 SNPs- > genes mapping rule. one pathway is \u2018glutathione metabolism\u2019 (FDR = 0.036), which was also reported by Holmans et al.(30). the system architecture and overview of i-GSEA4GWAS web server. input data The input data of i-GWAS are SNP data, mainly P-values. the server will transform the P-value to log(P-value) the program uses the list of SNP-mapped genes to filter the collection of pathways/gene sets to obtain candidate pathways/gene sets. i-GSEA4GWAS performs i-GSEA to identify pathways/gene sets correlated with traits. the progress of the three key steps will be shown in the progress bar. a total of 23 pathways/gene sets were identified to be possibly correlated with the trait (FDR 0.25) the pathways \u2018antigen processing and presentation\u2019, \u2018inflampathway\u2019, \u2018cskpathway\u2019, \u2018ribosome\u2019 and \u2018st myocyte ad pathway\u2019 have high confidence (FDR 0.05) the pathway'st myocyte ad pathway' contains a variety of adrenergic receptors that induce subtype-specific signaling effects. the top gene with the smallest P-value in this gene set, ITPR1 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, type 1) has been reported to interact with genes in HIV. i-GSEA4GWAS aims to help researchers take the best advantage of the high-cost GWAS data to look for new biological insights worthy of further confirmation. the improved i-GSEA approach, the optimal multiple-level SNPs->genes mapping system, the comprehensive pathway/gene set database with options of customization. the key issue of i-GSEA is focusing on pathways/gene sets with high proportion of significant genes to detect combinations of modest effects. the key issue of i-GSEA greatly improves sensitivity in comparison to GSEA. the i-GSEA4GWAS web server provides researchers an efficient open platform for GWAS analysis. this helps further interpret the SNP P-values from hundreds of available GWASs and future GWASs to provide new insights into disease study."}
