{"summary": "patient 1 was a 51-year-old male tourist from Bali, Indonesia, who became ill in April 2007. she had a 2-day history of influenza-like illness (ILI) and oseltamivir was prescribed. Throat and nasal swab specimens were taken 3 days after onset of illness. the patient recovered uneventfully. a sample from patient 2 was also tested for influenza A. we processed supernatant of tissue culture fluid for examination of virus morphologic appearance. PCR, Nucleotide Sequencing, and Phylogenetic Analysis. phylogenetic tree of orthoreoviruses based on partial sequence alignment of the cell attachment protein (S1 gene segment) sequences were submitted to GenBank and compared with other orthoreovirus sequences for genetic relatedness and evolution. dots indicate viruses isolated from 3 travelers who had returned from Indonesia to Hong Kong during 2007\u20132010. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. serum samples from 1:5 to 1:2,560 were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. serum, virus, and cell controls were included in the assay. patient 1 was a 51-year-old male tourist from Bali, Indonesia, who became ill in April 2007. patient 3 was a 29-year-old woman who sought care for ILI at the general outpatient clinic in Hong Kong in June 2010. as part of sentinel surveillance for ILI, throat and nasal swab specimens were taken for routine isolation of respiratory viruses. a sample from patient 2 was also tested for influenza A. PCR, Nucleotide Sequencing, and Phylogenetic Analysis. primers based on published sequences of Melaka virus. PCR, nucleotide sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree of orthoreoviruses based on partial sequence alignment of the cell attachment protein (S1 gene segment) number for each sequence is in parentheses after the virus name. number at nodes indicate bootstrap values based on 1,000 replicates. phylogenetic tree of orthoreoviruses based on partial sequence alignment of the major outer capsid protein (S4 gene segment) number for each sequence is in parentheses after the virus name. numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values based on 1,000 replicates. a monolayer of confluent Vero cells washed with 2% MEM. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator for 4 days. the end-point neutralizing antibody titer was determined by serum with the highest dilution. we extracted viral RNA from 200 L of culture supernatant of 3 orthoreoviruses. the amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. the amplified products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values based on 1,000 replicates. dots indicate viruses isolated from 3 travelers who had returned from Indonesia to Hong Kong during 2007\u20132010. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitution per site. phylogenetic tree of orthoreoviruses based on partial sequence alignment of the major outer capsid protein (S4 gene segment) number for each sequence is in parentheses after the virus name. the end-point neutralizing antibody titer was determined by serum with the highest dilution that reduced plaques by 70% more than the virus control. immunofluorescent testing indicated that the samples were negative for influenza, respiratory syncytial, measles, and mumps viruses. HK46886/09 and HK50842/10 viruses were clustered together. the HK23629/07 virus was clustered with Miyazaki virus. the difference in sequence homology between segments suggested reassortment events. the control serum had a neutralizing antibody titer 10 against all 3 viruses. the HK46886/09 and HK50842/10 viruses were clustered together and closely related to the Kampar virus isolated in Malaysia. the HK23629/07 virus has been reported as similar but distinct from Melaka virus (11) orthoreoviruses may be associated with upper respiratory tract infections. incubation periods for the patients reported here ranged from 4 to 7 days. cross-reactivity of the 3 virus strains, demonstrated by PRNT, suggests that they were antigenically similar. the association of orthoreovirus infection with bat exposure showed that these abundant mammals are natural reservoirs. the segmented nature of the virus genome also facilitates virus reassortment, which leads to virus diversity."}
