{"summary": "ZIKV is a reemerging mosquito-borne flavivirus circulating in a wide range of regions including africa, south America, and Asia. the virus can cause serious damage to the central nervous system, such as infant microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. four hospitalized individuals from a family were diagnosed with ZIKV infection at Enping People's Hospital. this family had lived in Venezuela for more than two months before 20 February 2016. they flew to new york on that day and stayed there for 4 days. the family was then isolated by the local department of public health. route of the family traveling from an affected area to south china in late February 2016. RNA extraction Before RNA extraction, urine samples were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Units with Ultracel-10 membrane. RNA was eluted in 50 l of AVE buffer and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. phylogenetic trees were drawn using the maximum likelihood method in the Tamura-Nei model with gamma-distributed evolutionary rates in MEGA 7.0 (www.megasoftware.net). an initial tree was made automatically with the nearest-neighbor-interchange method. all samples were tested for ZIKV RNA by real-time PCR. some urine was used to isolate virus. RNA was eluted in 50 l of AVE buffer and stored at 80 \u00b0C. the sequences of the PCR products were identified by using the Sanger sequencing method. the sequences were aligned with other reference sequences using Clustal 2.1 software (http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/). rash first occurred on the third day after his son showed fever and rash. the only symptom he had was a rash, and the rash was distributed uniformly on his neck and back. the 37-year-old mother did not have any symptoms during the whole period of observation. rashes on the back of patient 1, who was infected with Zika virus. time point when peripheral blood was positive for ZIKV. only patient 4 was positive for ZIKV in a saliva sample. phylogenetic trees were constructed using maxim likelihood method. the whole tree can be divided into African and Asian lineages. strains HQ234499.1-P6-740 isolated from A. aegypti in Malaysia in 1966. phylogenetic tree based on E gene sequences of Zika virus isolates. all isolates are indicated with related information (Genbank number, country, year and host, some with sample type) the four family members had been isolated since 25 February 2016. the clinical laboratory showed results that the overall symptoms were mild. the daughter and the son were subjected to laboratory blood tests twice and thrice, respectively. some patients received multiple test, and date is indicated in brackets. inferred time axis ranging from probable biting by mosquitoes. time point when peripheral blood was positive for ZIKV using real-time PCR. strain HQ234499.1-P6-740 isolated from A. aegypti in 1966 is the earliest ancestor of the Asian lineage. strains KU820899.2-ZJ03, KU866423.1-virus/SZ01/2016 and KU955589.1-Z16006 are isolated among imported cases from Samoa or Fiji, pacific islands near Asia. DISCUSSION ZIKV infection is becoming a global public health concern. microcephaly cases in Brazil might be linked to ZIKV infection during pregnancy. the temperature in February in north America, especially northern regions such as new york, is below 10 \u00b0C. therefore, the family members in our study were unlikely to be bitten by mosquitoes during their 4-day stay in New York. Rash and low-grade fever seem to be the main symptoms for most ZIKV-infected individuals. RT-PCR based on TaqMAN probes may be the most convenient tool to detect ZIKV infection in suspected patients23, 24. the results must be validated by a plaque reduction neutralization test, a labor-intensive and costly method. compared with blood drawing, urine and saliva collection are more acceptable options for suspected individuals. tree based on NS1 gene sequences can distinguish all clusters of ZIKV isolates from all over the world. phylogenetic tree constructed from E protein gene sequences can be divided into two lineages, african and Asian. the diversity of the strains is apparent, and the latter is nearer to KU744693.1-VE Ganxian strains. no direct evidence has demonstrated that this virus could be spread by A. albopictus, a local vector for dengue virus in south china. the fact that ZIKV can propagate in the C6/36 cell line derived from A. albopictus suggests that this mosquito may be a competent vector. four subjects in one family had lived and traveled together for the past few months. but because they are a family, the probability of human-to-human transmission by close contact between family members should not be ignored. if their ZIKV infections were all caused by mosquito-biting, the incubation periods of three of the patients were all more than five days. RT-PCR positivity for ZIKV RNA and viral isolation from urine samples proved that there were live viruses present in these samples. RT-PCR also indicated the existence of viral RNA in the patients' saliva."}
