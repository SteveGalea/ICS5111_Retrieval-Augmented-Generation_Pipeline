{"summary": "the evolution of emerging diseases is associated with factors embedded in the concept \u201chost-agent-environment triangle\u201d (1). to infect the host and cause disease, the pathogen needs to evade host defenses, which may occur through single point mutations, genome rearrangements, recombination and/or translocation (2). genetic uniformity generated through genetic selection of the host (3) must be considered as essential factors for the development of emerging diseases (4\u20136) atypical porcine pestivirus (cause of congenital tremors type II) (15) and HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin (associated with a fatal swine acute diarrhea syndrome) (16) many other novel infectious agents have been detected in both healthy and diseased animals. metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of an uncharacterized virus (21) further analyses using rolling circle amplification followed by Sanger sequencing showed a circular genome of 2,000 nucleotides. results revealed qPCR positivity in 93.75 and 12.5% of the analyzed samples. a new taxonomical grouping has been established by the international committee on taxonomy of Virus. the genus has been removed from the family Circoviridae and reassigned into the anelloviridae family. viral sequences of the genus Cyclovirus have been reported in both vertebrates and invertebrates. circoviruses are small single-stranded DNA viruses (43), characterized by a non-enveloped virion with icosahedral symmetry. PCV-1 has a genome size ranging from 1,758 to 1,760 nucleotides (45\u201347), while the circular genomes of PCV-2 and PCV-3 consist of 1,766\u20131,769 and 1,999\u20132,001 nt (21, 46, 48\u201350) ORF1 apparently codes for a single replicase protein in PCV-3, of 296\u2013297 aa (21, 22) ORF1 is located on the positive strand and considered the most conserved region of the circovirus genome. the ORF3 protein consists of 206 aa for PCV-1, 104 aa for PCV-2 and 231 aa for PCV-3 (21, 66) the apoptotic activity of ORF3 protein has been described both in vitro and in vivo for PCV-1 and PCV-2 (67, 68) 0.057 [0.000\u20130.172] 0.547 [0.539\u20130.569] 0.174 [0.116\u20130.194] 0.022 [0.000\u20130.056] 0.495 [0.485\u20130.520] PCV-3 0.533 [0.528\u20130.543] 0.525 [0.518\u20130.544] 0.009 [0.000\u20130.024] 0.598 [0.586\u20130.611] 0.547 [0.539\u20130.569] 0.014 [0.000\u20130.028] 0.500 [0.491 several sub-clusters (48, 72, 73), based on differences found in the aa sites 122 and 320 (S122A and A320V) the progressive increase in sequence availability is revealing the presence of other branching patterns. similar to PCV-2, a higher heterogeneity might be found in the future. PCV-3 DNA was found at all age-groups in four tested farms. the frequency of infection was not clearly dominant at any age. also, PCV-3 has been detected at moderate to high rate in sera pools. Kedkovid et al. (84) found a positive correlation between detection in serum samples and in colostrum, suggesting that the colostrum is influenced by the viremic stage of the sow. the virus was found in 2 out of 4 sponges used for sampling pig transporting trucks after sanitation. PCV-3 genome has been found in 4 out of 44 (9.09%) serum samples of dogs from china. authors suggested that the virus might infect non-porcine species. Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) NA Yes* NA Phan et al. (22) Shen et al. (22) Kedkovid et al. (91) Cardiovascular Weaning \u2022Diarrhea Yes* Zhai et al. (22) Gastrointestinal Weaning \u2022Diarrhea Yes*. PCV-3 genome was initially retrieved from sows with clinical signs compatible with PDNS in the USA. in the affected farm, a decrease of 0.6% in the conception rate was found while the sow mortality showed a 10.2% increase (21) in china, PCV-3 was found in serum samples from sows with reproductive problems characterized by acute loss of neonatal piglets. pigs with clinical signs showed higher prevalence in pigs with clinical signs (17.14%, 6 out of 35) compared to those with non-diarrhea signs (87) PCV-3 was the only pathogen found in the brain, with high amount of viral DNA (101) co-infections. it is still too early to establish the overall picture of PCV-3 infection. the likelihood of disease may not depend on its presence only. other factors may serve as illness triggering factors. a comparative study between healthy sows and sows with a clinical picture characterized by chronic reproductive failure revealed that PCV-3 positivity was higher in affected sows (39 out of 84, 46.42%) than in healthy ones (23 out of 105, 21.9%) (69) viral genome has also been found in tissues from stillborn farms experiencing reproductive failure in china (69\u201371) and Korea (94) cases were negative for three of the most important swine infectious agents (PCV-2, PRRSV, and Porcine parvovirus, PPV) (21, 22, 87), subsequent studies revealed frequent co-infection with other viruses. pathogens present in PCV-3 PCR positive samples/cases are summarized in Table 5. it is still too early to establish the overall picture of PCV-3 infection. it is currently based on molecular techniques such as conventional PCR and qPCR and its characterization by Sanger sequencing or NGS. infection of cell cultures with PCV-3 tissue homogenates has been attempted in PK-15 (21, 75) and swine testicle cells (ST) (21) without success. the cells were observed for cytopathic effects and monitored by qPCR for viral growth. there is not any PCV-3 isolate so far available. current literature has already reported the presence of PCV-3 in diseased animals. only few of them included healthy control groups (71, 76, 87, 91). lack of virus isolation has impeded the establishment an infection model to date. PCV-3 has been found in pigs affected by periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome in co-infection with PPV and Ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (100) only one study has monitored PCV-3 infection longitudinally (83) colostrum antibodies are protective against infection and then decline during the lactation and weaning phases. a study performed in samples from captured and re-captured wild boar revealed long-lasting infection (potential persistent infection), since the virus was detected during a period of at least 5\u20137 months in few animals (95). this species shows susceptibility to several pathogens that affect humans and animals (123), including PCV-2. PCV-3 has been detected in the oldest samples so far tested in these studies, suggesting that this virus could have been infecting pigs for even a longer period. the most common ancestor of PCV-3 was estimated to be originated approximately in 1966 (73, 130). the first metagenomics sequence available from PCV-3 revealed low identity with cap and rep genes of PCV-1 and PCV-2. a closer identity with other Circoviruses such as canine circovirus (21, 22) and barbel circovirus (71) the rep gene closely related with that of bat circoviruses and cap gene with that of avian ones (132) the presence of possible genotypes was also suggested in other studies (73, 76) but the importance of determining genotypes or groupings at this stage seems poorly relevant. it must be emphasized the need to apply NGS technology to discover minor variants, which might unravel the presence of quasispecies undetected. the lack of virus isolation has impeded the establishment of an infection model. it is known that PCV-3 can be found in different tissues of domestic pig and wild boar (86, 87, 95), indicating the systemic nature of the infection. but the point of viral entry, primary replication, organic distribution and persistence are still unsolved issues. PCV-3 genome has been detected at higher prevalence in weaned pigs. only one study has monitored PCV-3 infection longitudinally. infection dynamics contrasts with that of PCV-2, which infects pigs mainly between five and 12 weeks of age. 123 pathogens affect humans and animals, including PCV-2. the wild boar can also develop PCV-2-SD (124). lack of other detection techniques able to confirm a true infection with this virus is still to be demonstrated. retrospective studies showed evidence of pig infection a number of decades before. in most of these investigations, evidence of PCV-2 infection coincided with the very first investigated year. the most common ancestor of PCV-3 was estimated to be originated approximately in 1966. rep genes of PCV-1 and PCV-2 and a closer identity with other Circoviruses such as Canine circovirus (21, 22) and Barbel circovirus (71). the Circovirus genus members are able to infect a wide range of hosts. cross-species transmission has also been reported. porcine circovirus 3 is a recently discovered virus widespread in both domestic pigs and wild boar population. the virus can be found at all tested ages and few animals may display a persistent infection."}
