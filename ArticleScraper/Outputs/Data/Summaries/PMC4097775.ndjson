{"summary": "PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. it infects the epithelia of the small intestine, an environment rich in proteases, and causes villous atrophy. intriguingly, in vitro propagation requires supplementation of trypsin to the cell culture supernatant. most coV-like PEDV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) carry noncleaved S proteins upon release (12) however, most coV-like PEDV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus carry noncleaved S proteins upon release (12) a vero-CCL81-derived cell line expressing the MHV receptor, murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (CCM) was made by transduction with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) the polyclonal Vero-CCM cell line was selected and maintained with G418 (PAA), and CCM PEDV S protein or derivatives thereof were propagated and titrated in aMEM-TPB supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 15 g/ml trypsin (Sigma catalog no. T4799) for purification of the PEDV-Swt virus particles in the absence of trypsin, vero cells were inoculated in the presence of trypsin activity. the culture supernatant was replenished by aMEM- DV-S_aB genes were generated by replacing the PstI PmlI, PstI Bsu36I, or Bsu36I PmlI fragments of the caPEDV S gene with those of the wtPEDV sequence. the entire S gene was replaced by BamHI PmlI, generating p-PEDV-CV777-ORF3/GFP. samples were imaged by an EVOS-fl fluorescence microscope. samples were prepared for flow cytometry analysis. same procedure was used if the inoculum had been pretreated. vero cells were inoculated with recombinant PEDV at an MOI of 2 for 2 h. incubated in aMEM-TPB or aMEM-TPB supplemented with 15 g/ml trypsin. supernatant was collected and cell debris was removed by spinning for 10 min at 10,000 g. wtPEDV S gene-specific PCR products were subcloned into pCAGGS expression vector for transient expression (Swt) cDNA was recovered from virus preparations, and wtPEDV S gene-specific PCR products were subcloned into pCAGGS expression vector for transient expression. stacks were acquired every 65 s at 40 magnification. cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. membrane permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. samples were supplemented with or without 15 g/ml trypsin before being warmed to 37\u00b0C for 30 min. samples were chilled and triedpsin activity was quenched by the addition of 80 g/ml SBTI before the titers were determined by endpoint dilution or denaturing. a vero-CCL81-derived cell line expressing the MHV receptor, murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (CCM) was made by transduction with vesicular stomatitis virus. the polyclonal Vero-CCM cell line was selected and maintained with G418 (PAA) to propagate PEDV, cell layers were generally washed twice with phosphate-buffered sa recombinant virus carrying wtPEDV S protein or derivatives thereof were propagated and titrated in aMEM-TPB supplemented with 20 mM HEPES. recombinant virus carrying wtPEDV S protein, including trypsin-independent derivatives thereof, were propagated and titrated in vero cells (20. transfer vectors for novel recombinants were derivatives of p-PEDV-ORF3/GFP. chimeric PEDV-S_AB, PEDV-S_Ab, and PEDV-S_aB genes were generated by replacing the PstI PmlI fragments of the caPEDV S gene with those of the wtPEDV sequence. for recombinant PEDV containing the GFP reporter gene, inocula contained 15 g/ml trypsin, 40 g/ml SBTI, or both. after 2 h, inoculum was removed, cell layers were rinsed with PBS and incubated with aMEM-TPB supplemented with SBTI. the threshold for mock-infected cells was set at 0.1% positive cells. vero cells were inoculated with recombinant PEDV at an MOI of 2 for 2 h and incubated in aMEM-TPB or aMEM-TPB. wtPEDV S gene-specific PCR products were subcloned into pCAGGS expression vector for transient expression (Swt) cDNA was recovered from virus preparations and wtPEDV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. cell-cell fusion was monitored by immunofluorescence staining against PEDV-Swt. cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. image stacks were acquired every 65 s at 40 magnification. western blot analysis was used to visualize staining. samples were supplemented with or without 15 g/ml trypsin. samples were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. the transmembrane domain of PEDV S protein was predicted by TMHMM 2.0 and the signal peptide by SignalP 4.1. microscopy images were quantified with ImageJ and GIMP. infection with wild-type PEDV isolate but not with cell culture-adapted PEDV benefits from trypsin activity. inocula were supplemented with soy bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), trypsin, or a combination of both and applied to Vero cells. after 15 h of incubation, infected cells were detected by immunofluorescence staining against the nucleocapsid protein (green). vero cells were inoculated in the presence or absence of trypsin or soy bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) after 2 h, the inoculum was removed and incubation continued in the presence of SBTI to prevent syncytium formation. trypsin affects different steps in the viral life cycle. trypsin might affect virus propagation at different steps in the viral life cycle. trypsin might affect virus propagation at different steps in the viral life cycle. PEDV-Swt infection showed a 3-fold increase of infection for PEDV-Sca. trypsin has been reported to increase the release of PEDV from infected cells. trypsin was added to all samples to normalize the sample conditions. trypsin activity was quenched by SBTI before or after inoculation. infection by PEDV-Swt was not enhanced by trypsin pretreatment. infection with PEDV-Sca did not benefit from trypsin pretreatment of virus or cells. infectivity was determined by endpoint dilution (50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50]/ml), and virus particles were subjected to Western blot analysis. proteins were detected by a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase or rabbit anti-PEDV-S1 serum. after addition of an excess SBTI, virus was added to cells. nontagged PEDV-Sca was detected only by anti-S1 serum. incubation with trypsin cleaved a fraction of PEDV-Swt. but essentially all of PEDV-Sca S protein migrated at approximately 70 kDa and 50 kDa. the infectivity of pretreated PEDV-Swt was unaffected and required trypsin activity after attachment. the infectivity of PEDV-Swt is compromised before and after receptor binding. chimeric viruses were tested for trypsin-dependent entry. all other viruses that contain part A of caPEDV, such as PEDV-S_aB, did not require trypsin for efficient entry. part A contains the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry. arginine occurred in the S protein of wtPEDV and PEDV-DR13par. but was replaced by a glycine in the cell culture-adapted caPEDV. despite multiple efforts, this virus could not be recovered by our RNA recombination approach. small syncytia were induced in the cells expressing Swt_R890G. overexpression of Sca results in small-sized syncytia. the Sca mutant bearing the reciprocal G890R mutation did not differ in its ability to induce syncytium formation. number of nuclei per focus was quantified and displayed as binned frequency distribution histogram. Syncytia containing 1 to 4 nuclei were small, 5 to 8 nuclei were medium, and more than 8 nuclei were large. average syncytium sizes induced by Swt and Swt_R890G mutant significantly differ from each other. recombinant viruses were encoding the wtPEDV S gene (PEDV-Swt) or the caPEDV S gene (PEDV-Sca) in an isogenic background, the viruses hence only differing in their S proteins. the ORF3 was replaced by a GFP gene to enable the detection of infection by fluorescence (16). infected cells were examined by GFP expression using fluorescence microscopy (green) nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the percentage of infected cells was determined by quantifying GFP-expressing cells using flow cytometry. vero cells were inoculated in the presence of trypsin for 2 h with PEDV-Sca or PEDV-Swt at an MOI known to infect about 10% of cells. after the virus entry stage, the inoculum was removed and incubation was continued in the presence of SBTI for 9 h to prevent syncytium formation by residual trypsin in the culture supernatant. vero cells were inoculated with PEDV-Swt and PEDV-Sca. incubation was continued in the absence or presence of trypsin until 14 to 16 h p.i.. trypsin was added to all samples before determining viral infectivity. infection with PEDV-Sca did not benefit from trypsin pretreatment of virus or cells. exposure to active trypsin reduced PEDV-Sca infectivity in absence of cells. recombinant PEDV-Sca_flag and PEDV-Swt_flag were generated in which the S proteins were C-terminally extended by a FLAG-tag. recombinant PEDV-Sca_flag and PEDV-Swt_flag were generated in which the S proteins were C-terminally extended by a FLAG-tag. PEDV-Swt_flag and PEDV-Sca_flag migrated at approximately 70 kDa and 50 kDa. the extent of trypsin-mediated proteolysis of the S proteins correlate with the observed reduction of virus infectivity. the amino acid sequences of PEDV-Sca and PEDV-Swt differ at 129 amino acid positions. we aimed to map the genetic determinant for trypsin-dependent entry. chimeric viruses were tested for trypsin-dependent entry. a schematic overview shows the chimeric S proteins of the recombinant PEDV variants. the alignment of the amino acid sequence N-terminal of the fusion peptide depicts a conserved arginine or a glycine substitution (bold italic) the alignment of the amino acid sequence N-terminal of the FP depicts a conserved arginine or a glycine substitution (bold italic) wtPEDV, attempts were made to generate PEDV-Swt encoding an R890G substitution. this virus could not be recovered by our RNA recombination approach, whereas control recombinations were successful. we did not consider introducing the reciprocal G890R substitution in PEDV-Sca. the sizes of the foci were quantified by counting the number of nuclei. for Swt, about 50% of syncytia were found to be small, containing 1 to 4 nuclei, 25% were medium size, with 5 to 8 nuclei, and 25% were large, having more than 8 nuclei. in contrast, the Swt_R890G mutant yielded almost 80% of small syncytia, 15% medium, and only 5% large. synchronytia containing 1 to 4 nuclei were small, 5 to 8 nuclei were medium, and more than 8 nuclei were large. average syncytium sizes induced by Swt and Swt_R890G mutant significantly differ from each other. proteolytic priming of class I fusion glycoproteins has been reported to occur with different timing and by various host proteases. a preceding cleavage of SARS-CoV S protein facilitates cleavage at a second site further C-terminal of the first (30). a preceding cleavage of MHV-2 S protein facilitates cleavage at a second site further C-terminal of the first (30). a prior cleavage of MHV-2 S protein facilitates cleavage at a second site further C-terminal of the first (30). a sequence comparison of PEDV S proteins pointed at an arginine (R890)-to-glycine substitution that has occurred during the serial in vitro passaging process. a role of this residue in trypsin-mediated activation of fusion was indicated by the significant reduction in syncytium formation by cells expressing the CV777 S protein encoding the R890G mutation. avage at R890 would allow the bulky receptor binding head domain of the PEDV S protein to move aside, thereby liberating an N-terminal fusion peptide. entry by cell culture-adapted caPEDV into vero cells is independent of trypsin. however, fusion by infected cells still required the addition of trypsin. ated vaccine and its attenuated phenotype in pigs was suggested to be associated with a deletion in the accessory ORF3 gene product. we add that attenuation could also result from reduced viral fitness of the trypsin-independent PEDV vaccine strain in the gastric and pancreatic protease-rich environment of the intestine. enveloped virus entry is generally directed and controlled by proteolytic processing of the fusion protein, receptor binding, and triggering of membrane fusion. in vitro, PEDV is unique in its dependence on a protease that is not expressed by the target cell."}
