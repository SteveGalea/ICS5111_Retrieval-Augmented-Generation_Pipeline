{"summary": "NP of IAV interacts with human API5. screen led to identification of API5 as an interactor of NP. co-transformants tested positive for histidine prototrophy and -galactosidase activity. panel 3 shows immunoprecipitation of NP followed by western blotting with anti-NP antibody. panel 4 shows immunoprecipitation of API5 followed by western blotting with anti-API5 antibody. panel 7 shows the specificity of interaction between API5 and viral protein NP. panels 1 and 4 show immunoprecipitation and western blotting with -API5 and -NP antibodies. panels 5, 6, and 7 show western blotting with -NP, -API5, and -GAPDH antibodies NP colocalizes with API5 in the nucleus. NP was stained with rabbit -API5 as primary antibody and anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa594 as secondary antibody (red) nuclei are stained blue with DAPI. NP was stained with mouse -NP as primary antibody and anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa488 as secondary antibody (green) whole-cell lysates resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) 48 h post transfection the whole-cell lysates from the samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. total RNA was isolated for the estimation of API5 mRNA levels using quantitative PCR with specific primers. a time-dependent decrease in relative levels of API5 mRNA and protein was observed upon infecting A549 cells with PR8 virus at increasing MOI. a time-dependent decrease in relative levels of API5 mRNA and protein was observed upon infecting A549 cells with PR8 virus at increasing MOI. this results indicate a negative impact of IAV infection as well as NP on expression of API5. cleavage was used as a marker of caspase activity in infected cells. overexpression of NP in A549 cells mirrored effect of IAV infection on cellular apoptosis. APAF1 mRNA levels also increased. at 48 h post transfection, the total RNA was isolated for the estimation of APAF1 mRNA levels. the data in b and d are shown as meanS.D. of three independent experiments. at 24 h post transfection, cells were infected with either non-targeting (NT siRNA) or API5-specific siRNA (API5 siRNA) the whole-cell lysate was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. at 24 h post transfection, cells were infected with either mock or PR8. we performed ChIP assay to investigate the status of E2F1 recruitment to APAF1 promoter under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells. we conclude that API5 in order to obstruct the proapoptotic pathway, interferes with recruitment of E2F1 transcription factor to target gene promoters. cells were transfected with either control, NP (NP-myc) alone, API5 (API5-Flag) alone or both constructs. cells were subjected to analysis for apoptosis using annexin V (an early apoptotic marker) and 7AAD (a late apoptotic marker) staining. at 48 h post transfection, cells were transfected with either control (pcDNA3.1-myc/His) or API5-Flag (pLPC-API5-Flag) at 24 h post transfection, cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1. replicase assay results showed sixfold elevation in replicase activity upon depletion of API5. NP protein levels were in accord with mRNA levels under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells. NP protein levels were in accord with mRNA levels under conditions of API5 depletion. whole-cell lysate was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotted with -NP and -GAPDH antibodies. total RNA was isolated for estimation of NP mRNA levels using quantitative PCR with specific primers. a549 cells were transfected with either control (pcDNA3.1-myc/His) or API5-Flag (pLPC-API5-Flag) for 24 h followed by infection with X31 virus at an MOI 1. the cells were collected at 24 h post infection. the co-transformants tested positive for histidine prototrophy and -galactosidase activity. the NP\u2013API5 interaction was further ascertained by performing a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in mammalian cells. at 16 h post infection, cells were collected and lysed for co-immunoprecipitation assays. panel 1 and 2 show immunoprecipitation of NP by -NP followed by western blotting with -API5 antibody. panel 10 shows the isotype control. NP of IAV colocalizes with API5 in the nucleus. similar observations were made in cells infected with PR8 strain of IAV. NP colocalizes with cellular API5. NP was stained using rabbit -API5 as primary antibody and anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa594 as secondary antibody (red). NP was stained with mouse -NP as primary antibody and anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa488 as secondary antibody (red). NP was stained with mouse -NP as primary antibody and anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa488 as secondary antibody (green). A549 cells were either mock infected (MI) or infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.1, 1, 2, and 5 for 24 h. whole-cell lysates from the samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE. APAF1-dependent apoptosis involves APAF1-dependent induction of both initiator and effector caspases. overexpression of NP in A549 cells mirrored the effect of IAV infection on cellular apoptosis. whole-cell lysates were prepared at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h post infection. whole-cell lysates were either mock infected (mock) or infected with PR8 (PR8) at an MOI of 1. total RNA was isolated for estimation of APAF1 mRNA levels. poptotic factor API5 prompted us to assess the impact of altering cellular status of API5 on IAV-induced apoptosis. we thus analyzed the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of API5 on E2F1-mediated apoptosis. to this end, A549 cells depleted of API5 were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1. a549 cells were transfected with either control (pLPC) or API5-Flag (pLPC-API5-Flag) 24 h post transfection cells were infected with either mock or PR8 at an MOI of 1. the total RNA was isolated for the estimation of APAF1 mRNA. a549 cells were transfected with either non-targeting siRNA (NT siRNA) or API5-specific siRNA (API5 siRNA), (b) either control (pLPC) or API5-Flag (pLPC-API5-Flag) at 24 h post transfection, cells were infected with PR8. NP induces 2-fold increase in 7AAD positive and 2.5-fold increase in annexin V positive cells compared with control. API5 overexpression mitigates the proapoptotic effect of NP and significantly decreases the percentage of annexin V and 7AAD stained cells. FITC-conjugated annexin V or 7AAD and subjected to flow cytometry. for acquisition 20 000 cells per sample were used. the data are shown as meanD. of three independent experiments. replicase assay results showed sixfold elevation in replicase activity upon depletion of API5. upregulation of NP mRNA, protein levels, polymerase activity as well as viral titers in API5-depleted cells are clear indicators that viral replication is inhibited by the host factor API5. the cells were collected at 24 h post infection. Aliquot of supernatant obtained from IAV-infected cells was used to infect MDCK cells followed by the determination of viral titers using a plaque assay. the data in b, c, d, f and g are shown as meanS.D. of three independent experiments. the data in b, c, d, f and g are shown as meanS.D. Akt signaling pathway has been associated with both viral replication and host survival. we have shown that API5 interacts with NP of IAV and not with other viral proteins such as M1 and NS1. the interaction is conserved in H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, suggesting specificity of interaction with NP. IAV sequesters host antiapoptotic protein bcl2 through its phosphorylation by activating cellular p38MAPK, facilitating viral-induced apoptosis. NP of IAV has been recently shown to promote the release of cytochrome c into cytoplasm through its modulation of clusterin\u2013Bax association. different proteins encoded by IAV, such as NP and M1, use multiple mechanisms to target strategic host proteins involved in regulation of the cellular apoptotic network. effect of the NP\u2013API5 interaction on APAF1 expression and caspase cleavage prompted us to check apoptosis induction in NP expressing as well as IAV-infected cells. RNA viruses for example HIV, coronavirus IBV, and influenza virus arrest cell cycle at an early stage of infection. these reports, together with role of API5 in cell proliferation, raise a compelling possibility that regulation of API5 by NP in IAV-infected cells may also impact E2F1-mediated cell cycle control. influenza virus strains were used at an MOI of 1 unless specified otherwise. cells were washed with PBS and were supplemented with DMEM 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) medium containing 1 g/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. cDNA library cloned in pYesTrp2 was purchased from Invitrogen. the bait plasmid was constructed by cloning IAV NP coding sequence in frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain in pHybLexA/Zeo. co-immunoprecipitation A549 cells were infected with either mock (allantoic fluid of uninfected eggs), PR8, and X31 virus at an MOI of 1. the beads were washed three times with chilled PBS, resuspended in Lamelli buffer, boiled for 10 min, and spun down.
