{"summary": "frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein synthesis. in response to elements in the mRNA, the ribosome switches from the zero reading frame to the 1 frame (in the 5\u2032 direction) at a defined position. the mRNA signals that promote frameshifting comprise a slippery sequence. the mechanism of frameshifting is not fully understood. some viral pseudoknots have also been described as kissing hairpins (8,9) the mechanism of frameshifting is not fully understood. the normal function of the PEG10 protein is yet to be determined. it is associated with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma. the signal is poorly characterized. we derived a model of the Edr stimulatory RNA and assessed its similarity to those found at viral frameshift sites. we found that the structure is an RNA pseudoknot quite different from the one proposed previously (20) but possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots. plasmid junctions were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded templates rescued from E.coli JM101. a 1230 bp DNA fragment (631\u20131861) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pSP64T/Edr (20) and cloned into NcoI/HindIII digested plasmid pKT0 (28) in vitro transcription reactions using the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase were carried out essentially as described by Melton et al..

RNA was recovered by centrifugation, washed with acetone, dried, dissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above. all structure probing gels included an alkaline hydrolysis ladder as a size marker, prepared by dissolving the dried pellet from 3 l of end-labelled RNA and 10 g carrier rRNA in 3 l of 22.5 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM Na2CO3. the mRNAs were translated in the RRL in vitro translation system. each mRNA showed an efficiency of 30% (hereafter the \u2018wild-type\u2019 efficiency) in good agreement with the value obtained by Shigemoto et al. (20). the non-frameshifted product is predicted to be 29 kDa in each case. in-frame deletions of 24, 63 or 90 nt were introduced into pKT0/Edr. the plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitro transcription. each deletion (of 90, 63 or 24 nt) was to a common 3\u2032 site (immediately downstream of the NdeI site), leaving varying lengths of 5\u2032 sequence. the nucleotides implicated as forming the stimulatory RNA in a previous study (20) are in bold. stem 1 is considered as two helices, 1a and 1b, separated by a 3 nt bulge (\u2013ACA\u2013) in the second arm. site-directed mutagenesis of the Edr frameshift signal was carried out. mutants fell into four groups. products were labelled with [35S]methionine, separated on 15% SDS/polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. the non-frameshifted (stop) and frameshifted (FS) species are marked with arrows. destabilization of any stem reduced frameshifting efficiency (m3, m4, m6, m7, m9 and m10) but frameshifting was restored in the double mutant, pseudowild-type constructs (m5, m8 and m11) however, some stem-specific variation in the magnitude by which frameshifting was reduced by stem destabilization. adenosine-rich triplex formed between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 has been described and contributes to frameshifting (23,24,36,37). loop 2 of the proposed Edr pseudoknot is relatively A-rich (five of nine bases) and includes a 5\u2032-AACGA-3\u2032 stretch. RNA derived by transcription of pKT0/Edr/T3/NdeI with T3 RNA polymerase was 5\u2032 end-labelled with [-33P]ATP and subjected to chemical and enzymatic digestion. four enzymatic probes were used: RNases CL3, T1 and U2 which preferentially cleave single-stranded C, G and A residues, respectively, and RNase CV1. the chemical structure probing was with imidazole (2 h, I) or lead acetate (Pb2+; mM concentration in reaction) the water lane (W) represents RNA, which was dissolved in water, incubated for 2 h and processed in parallel to the imidazole-treated sample. the sensitivity of bases in the Edr frameshift region to the various probes is shown. loop 2 was cleaved by single-stranded chemical probes and loop 2 also by single-strand-specific enzymes. most unexpected features of this stimulatory RNA were the atypical cleavage pattern of stem 1 and the paucity of cleavages in the slippery sequence/spacer region. some features of this alternative model are attractive, e.g. the cleavage of G80\u201382 by RNase T1 is rationalized as these residues would be located in loop 2. however, the limited reactivity of the slippery sequence and spacer region to single-strand cleavage reagents could be attributed to the fact that much of the region is folded into a hairpin. the 3\u2032 boundary of the Edr frameshift signal was cloned by PCR into the expression vector pKT0 (28). this plasmid contains a bacteriophage SP6 promoter for the generation of in vitro transcripts and provides an optimized (Kozak) initiation codon for the translation of the cloned Edr segment. a series of run-off transcripts containing varying lengths of Edr sequence were prepared following digestion of the plasm pKT0/Edr was linearized with NdeI, AvrII, HindIII or BamHI. products were labelled with [35S]methionine, separated on a 15% SDS/polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. t were introduced into pKT0/Edr in the region between the GGGAAAC motif and the NdeI site. the plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitro transcription and translation. the stimulatory RNA is in fact longer than that proposed in the original study (20) mutants were digested with HindIII, transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase. products were labelled with [35S]methionine, separated on a 15% SDS/polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. the non-frameshifted (stop) and frameshifted (FS) species are marked with arrows. mutants fell into four groups (i) changes in the putative slippery sequence GGGAAAC, (ii) destabilizing and restabilizing mutations within the predicted stem regions 1a, 1b and 2. a mutation that deleted the bulge triplet between stems 1a and 1b and (iv) a mutation that changed the central seven (of nine) nucleotides in loop 2 to their complementary Watson\u2013Crick bases. in constructs pKT0/m5, m8 and m11, both arms of the relevant stem region were mutated so that the stems should reform (double/revertant) the two independent mutations created within the putative slippery sequence had the second base of each homopolymeric triplet changed to a C residue (m1 and m2) these changes would reduce the ability of the tRNAs decoding this sequence to slip into the 1 reading frame. frameshifting efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild-type in the double mutant construct. a triplet bulge was observed in the frameshift stimulatory RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and shown to contribute to frameshifting. loop 2 of the proposed Edr pseudoknot is relatively A-rich (five of nine bases) and includes a 5\u2032-AACGA-3\u2032 stretch. a modest reduction in frameshifting was observed (m12, 23.2%), but not so dramatic. RNA derived by transcription of pKT0/Edr/T3/NdeI with T3 RNA polymerase was subjected to limited RNase or chemical cleavage using structure-specific probes. the chemical probes imidazole and lead acetate were also employed, which show specificity for single-stranded regions. the sensitivity of bases in the Edr frameshift region is shown. the size of the symbols is approximately proportional to the intensity of cleavage at that site. the structure probing data were strongly supportive of the pseudoknot model of Figure 4. stem 1 showed susceptibility to cleavage by single-strand-specific enzymatic probes, notably RNase CL3, a C-specific reagent also showed cleavage at some of the C residues in stem 1. some features of this alternative model are attractive, e.g. the cleavage of G80\u201382 by RNase T1 is rationalized as these residues would be located in loop 2. stem 1a folds according to the original prediction, but shows breathing or flips occasionally into an alternative conformation. this behaviour might account for the fact that destabilization of the stem did not reduce frameshifting as dramatically as those mutations that destabilized stem 1b or stem 2. the Edr frameshift site comprises a slippery sequence GGGAAAC, a 5 nt spacer region and a relatively large pseudoknot (in viral terms) with 10 bp in stem 1, 9 in stem 2 and loops of 3 (loop1) and 9 (loop 2) nucleotides. in comparison with viral frameshift signals, Edr does not fit into a specific category. ide differences are present within the frameshift region, but only one is likely to have an effect on pseudoknot function. of the other three changes, one is within the stem 1 bulge and the other two in loop 2. the transition itself would only affect the ultimate stem 2 base pair and would likely have only a modest effect on frameshift efficiency. a ribosomal pause is proposed to occur upon encounter of the pseudoknot. this pause occurs while the decoding centre is over the slippery sequence. in constructs with a stem 1 destabilization, one expects frameshifting to be greatly reduced. the report of frameshifting in the mouse Edr gene provided the first opportunity to characterize such a cellular signal. the similarity of parts of the Edr coding sequence to the gag/pro region of retroviral genomes extends to the maintenance of a retrovirus-like frameshifting signal."}
