{"summary": "mycoplasma suis is an extracellular bacterial organism that attaches to and causes deformity and damage to porcine red blood cells. this bacterium mainly infects pigs and is responsible for a disease referred to as infectious anemia. chronic infection is associated with reproductive inefficiency in sows and increased incidence of respiratory and enteric disease. splenectomized pig was infected with M. suis and confirmed by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears stained with acridine orange. blood cells were sedimented by low-speed centrifugation at 300 g for 15 min at room temperature. plasma and buffy coat were discarded. oma cells (SP2/0) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) female BALB/c mice, 4\u20136 weeks of age, were purchased from the laboratory animal centre of Nantong University (Nantong, China) animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University (approval no. IACECNAU20100902) a series of primers were synthesized to amplify different fragments of MSG1 gene. PCR products were cloned into a pET-32a expression vector with EcoRI and KpnI sites. a series of primers were synthesized to amplify different fragments of MSG1 gene. pping and Truncated Segments of MSG1 Gene Fragment Primer sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) F2: 1-180aa 5\u2032 AGTGGTACCATGACCATCCACAAAG 3\u2032 F14: 292-337aa 5\u2032 TAAGGTACCACCACCCATGGTAG 3\u2032 5\u2032 CTTGAATTCCTAGCCGCTGTTAATGCCG 3\u2032 F3: 136-337aa 5\u2032 CAGGGTACCAAAACCGTTGTGTGT 3\u2032 F19: 248-299aa 5\u2032 TAAGGTACCCTGGTTGACCTGT 3\u2032 5\u2032 CCCGAATTCCTAGCTGTCGAAAAC 3\u2032 F8: 268-314aa 5\u2032 CTGGGTACCCTGTGTCGAAAAC 3\u2032 F20: 251-299aa 5\u2032 ATAGGTACCCTGTGTCTG 3\u2032 F20: 251-299aa 5\u2032 CTGGGTACCCTGTGTCGAAAAC 3\u2032 F9 splenectomized pig was infected with M. suis and confirmed by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears stained with acridine orange. blood cells were sedimented by low-speed centrifugation at 300 g for 15 min at room temperature. plasma and buffy coat were discarded. the resulting pellet of M. suis was re-suspended in 0.15 M NaCl. blood sample from the non-infected pig was processed in the same manner as negative control. the recombinant plasmid pBAD-msg1 was previously constructed by our laboratory. female BALB/c mice were fused with spleen cells from immunized mice. ELISA plates were coated with purified rMSG1 protein and E.coli/pBAD lysate. the sera isolated from immunized mice and the supernatant of SP2/0 cells were used as positive and negative controls. a series of primers were synthesized to amplify different fragments of MSG1 gene. PCR products were cloned into a pET-32a expression vector with EcoRI and KpnI sites. the recombinant proteins were expressed in Rosetta 2 strain and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 225-314aa 5\u2032 CTAGGTACCCGTGTTATTCCCG 3\u2032 F17: 233-296aa 5\u2032 GCCGGTACCAAACTGGATGGTATT 3\u2032 5\u2032 CCCGAATTCCTAAACGCTACCA 3\u2032 F6: 233-277aa 5\u2032 GCCGGTACCAAACTGGATGGTATT 3\u2032 F18: 225-272aa 5\u2032 CACGGTACCATCAACGAAGCGAT 3\u2032 F19: 248-299 TTTC 3\u2032 5\u2032 CGCGAATTCCTAGCTTTTGTTG 3\u2032 F11: 233-274aa 5\u2032 GCCGGTACCAAACTGGATGGTATT 3\u2032 F23: 196-255aa 5\u2032 ATAGGTACCGACAGCCCGCACA 3\u2032 5\u2032 CCCGAATTCCTAGATTTTCAGACAC 3\u2032 F12: 233-273aa 5\u2032 GCGAATTCCTAGTATT 3\u2032 F12: 233-273aa 5\u2032 positive hybridomas were sub-cloned three times by limiting dilution. four MAbs targeting MSG1 were obtained. Western blot analysis showed that these MAbs specifically reacted with both the purified His-MSG1 protein and crude M. suis extracts. western blot analysis was used to detect bindings of MAbs 1C10, 2F10, and 10E9 with various truncated rMSG1 fragments. a polyclonal rabbit anti-MSG1 antibody bound rMSG1 and the truncated proteins from F2 to F23. we then examined the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies. the OD450 values of MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 against F1, F3-F8, F10, and F11 were much higher than the values against F2, F9, and F12 (p0.05) the binding of MAb 1C10 to fragments F1, F3, F4, F13, F15, and F16 was significantly higher than that to fragments F1, F14, and F17 (p0.01) epitopes I268KDGENE274 and D291THGSVF297 were moderately conserved, except for the amino acid differences at positions 273 (N273S) and 296 (V296I) these data confirmed that the antigenic epitopes identified by Western blot and ELISA are highly conserved among MSG1 sequences. the polyclonal rabbit anti-MSG1 antibody bound all 23 truncated recombinant proteins and full-length rMSG1. the polyclonal rabbit anti-MSG1 antibody bound all 23 truncated recombinant proteins and truncated proteins from F2 to F23. western blot analysis revealed that rMSG1 fragments were not targeted. MAb 1C10 reacted with fragments F1, F3, F4, F13, and F16, but not with F2 (aa 1-180), F14 (aa 292-337), or F17 (aa 233-296) these data suggest that MAb 2F10 recognized the epitope spanning amino acids 251\u2013255. truncated fragments were used as antigens in an ELISA. the antigenic epitopes identified by Western blot and ELISA are highly conserved among MSG1 sequences. the amino acid sequence L251CLKI255 was highly conserved among all M. suis strains. the epitopes I268KDGENE274 and D291THGSVF297 were moderately conserved. despite the fact that MSG1 is a surface protein with similarities to GAPDH, there are only a few reports demonstrating the functions of MSG1 in M. suis infection. the antigenic epitopes of MSG1 have not been reported to date. the epitopes I268KDGENE274 and D291THGSVF297 were relatively conserved among all M. suis strain sequences available on NCBI. further studies should be carried out to confirm the relationship between these epitope variations and their pathogenicity."}
