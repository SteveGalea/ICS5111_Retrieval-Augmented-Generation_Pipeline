{"summary": "hMPV is a negative-sense, nonsegmented RNA virus that belongs to the paramyxoviridae family. LRTI associated with hMPV in infants and young children is a frequent cause of hospitalization. by the age of 5 years, most children have been infected by hMPV. by the age of 25, virtually all adults have already been exposed to the virus. three subtypes of IFN-: IFN-1 (interleukin-29 [IL-29]), IFN-2 (IL-28A) and IFN-3 (IL-28B) (11) more recently, an additional human isoform (IFN-4) moderately similar to IFN-3 has been described (12, 13) hMPV is susceptible to the effect of recombinant IFN-. it contributes to the control of hMPV-induced disease by influencing body weight loss, pulmonary inflammation, and lung viral titer. ed with the BssHII restriction enzyme to remove all restriction sites located between base 619 and base 792. this vector region was replaced by a polylinker containing the following DNA sequences. this DNA segment was followed by 3,038 bases of the virus sequence, including a NheI restriction site artificially created within the putative M-F intergenic region. hMPV cDNA was used as the template to clone the structural genes (N, P, L, and M2-1) in the pMT-1 vector (25). hMPV cDNA was used as the template to clone the structural genes (N, P, L, and M2-1) mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 50 l of hMPV or RSV diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (here referred as \u201cmock\u201d) as a mock treatment, mice were inoculated with an equivalent volume of PBS. cell-free supernatants were stored at 70\u00b0C until analysis. inflammatory infiltrates were scored by enumerating layers of inflammatory cells surrounding the vessels and bronchioles. finding moderate to abundant infiltrate was considered normal. qRT-PCRs were run on a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system. results were normalized to the endogenous reference (GAPDH) expression levels of transcripts from uninfected, control cells. recombinant full-length hMPV (rhMPV) and the G gene deletion mutant virus (G) were generated from a cDNA clone encoding the complete 13,335-nucleotide (nt) anti-genomic RNA of hMPV. the original pBlueScript II SK(+) vector was digested with the BssHII restriction enzyme to remove all restriction sites located between base 619 and base 792 hMPV cDNA was used as the template to clone structural genes in the pMT-1 vector (25). hMPV cDNA was used as the template to clone structural genes (N, P, L, and M2-1) in the pMT-1 vector (25) piratory syncytial virus (RSV) A2 was grown in HEp-2 cells (ATCC CCL 23) and purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation, followed by centrifugation on 35% to 65% discontinuous sucrose gradients. the virus titers were determined by a methylcellulose plaque assay, as previously reported (29, 30). 8-to-10-week-old mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 50 l of hMPV or RSV diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pBS; final administered dose, 1 107 PFU) mice were inoculated with 1, 3, or 5 g of recombinant murine (rm) IFN-2 (rmIFN-2; Peprotech) or 3 g of rmIFN the number of abnormal perivascular and peribronchial spaces divided by the total perivascular and peribronchial spaces was the percentage reported as the pathology score. for gene expression experiments, lung tissue was collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 70\u00b0C until analysis. RNA from cells or lung tissue was extracted using an RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) all primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. quantitative RT-PCRs (qRT-PCRs) were run on a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system following the manufacturer's suggested cycling parameters. hMPV infection was a stronger inducer of the interferon responses than RSV infection. the induction of IFN-1, IFN-2/3, IFN-4, and IFN- by both viruses was time dependent. hMPV induced a stronger interferon response than RSV. the expression of IFN-, IFN-1, -2, -3, and -4 was determined in RSV- or hMPV-infected A549 cells by qRT-PCR. cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 3. hMPV is susceptible to lambda interferons in vitro. treatment of infected cells with 50 ng/ml IFN-1 resulted in a >60% decrease in viral antigen expression. treatment with IFN-2 or IFN-3 decreased viral antigen expression by 50% with both concentrations (10 or 50 ng/ml) of interferon used. hMPV is sensitive to the effect of IFN-. production of lambda and beta interferon was assessed by ELISA in BAL fluid samples at 12, 24, and 48 h after infection. a separate group of mice was infected with RSV to compare the lambda interferon responses to these two close-related human paramyxoviruses. duction of IFN- by hMPV infection was 4-fold higher than induction of IFN-2/3 (subtracting the baseline amount of IFN- seen with mock-infected mice) hMPV induced larger amounts of IFN-2/3 and IFN- than RSV in an experimental mouse model of infection. transcription factor IRF-7 (21) was used to define the transcriptional regulation of lambda interferon induction in hMPV infection. mice deficient in IRF-7 (IRF-7/) or IRF-3 (IRF-3/) or C57BL/6 wild-type (wt) mice were infected for 24 h. analysis of the hMPV N gene revealed a significant (80%) decrease in hMPV N gene expression at each treatment concentration of IFN-2. treatment of mice with 1, 3, or 5 g of IFN-2 significantly reduced the virus titer by more than 1 log10. a similar effect was observed when mice were treated with same amount of IFN-3. the combination of the two IFNs (IFN-2 plus IFN-3) has a greater effect on hMPV replication than treatment with either IFN- separately. these data also indicate that saturation of the receptor for IFN- had not occurred at a concentration of 3 g/mouse. these results confirm the in vitro findings observed in A549 epithelial cells. mice treated with increasing concentrations of rmIFN-2 24 h prior to i.n. infection with hMPV. mice were monitored daily for disease symptoms and for changes in body weight. mice treated with 1 g of IFN-2 recovered faster than untreated mice. h&E-stained lung sections obtained at day 7 after infection were analyzed. there was minimal cellular peribronchial and perivascular infiltration in mock-infected mice. however, in hMPV-infected, nontreated mice, significant pathology was observed. IFN- modulates inflammatory response in hMPV-infected mice. BALB/c mice were treated i.n. with rmIFN-2 for 24 h prior to hMPV infection. at the 7-day time point, lung tissue was collected, fixed for slide preparation. expression of hMPV G and N genes was assessed by qRT-PCR. the presence of hMPV G protein significantly inhibited the expression of IFN-1, IFN-2/3, and IFN-4. the effect of hMPV G protein on the signaling pathway of IFN- was assessed. hMPV G protein inhibits the expression of IFN- in vitro and in vivo. expression of IFN-2/3 in the lungs of rhMPVG-infected mice was 13-fold higher than the expression from those infected with the rhMPV. qRT-PCR determined lambda interferon expression in rhMPV- and rhMPVG-infected cells. hMPV induced the expression of all four interferons assessed in the infected cells. hMPV (MOI of 3.0) induced a peak of an 4.0 1.7 104-fold increase. hMPV induced a peak of an 4.0 1.7 104-fold increase versus the 45 25.3-fold increase observed with RSV. inactivation of the virus by UV light failed to induce its expression. hMPV is susceptible to lambda interferons in vitro. we infected epithelial cells with hMPV in the presence of lambda interferons. expression of viral antigen (hMPV N gene) was determined by qRT-PCR. hMPV is sensitive to the effect of IFN-. cells were treated with 10 or 50 ng/ml of human recombinant IFN-1, -2, or -3 for 24 h, followed by hMPV infection (MOI of 3) and replenishment of the corresponding IFN- for additional 24 h. production of lambda interferon was not significantly induced by RSV at any of the time points tested. at 12 h after inoculation, similar significant amounts of IFN- were induced by the two viruses. at 24 h after hMPV infection, a significant peak of 1,129.8 319 pg/ml was observed. hMPV infection induces IFN- in vivo. mice were sacrificed at the indicated time after infection. production of IFN-2/3 (A) or IFN- (B) in BAL fluid was determined by ELISA. IRF-7/ (A) or IRF-3/ (B) mice were infected i.n. with 1 107 PFU of hMPV or RSV or were mock infected. C57BL/6 mice were used as controls (WT) after 24 h, mice were sacrificed and BAL fluid samples were collected. treatment of mice with 1, 3, or 5 g of IFN-2 significantly reduced the virus titer by more than 1 log10. similar effect was observed when mice were treated with 3 g of IFN-3. similar effect was observed when mice were treated with 3 g of IFN-2. BALB/c mice were treated i.n. with increased concentrations of rmIFN-2 24 h prior to i.n. infection with hMPV. mice were monitored daily for disease symptoms and for changes in body weight. treatment of lambda interferon ameliorates disease severity and inflammatory response. mice treated with 1 g of IFN-2 recovered faster (beginning at day 3 and completely by day 4 after infection) mice treated with 3 and 5 g of IFN-2 lost less weight and recovered significantly faster (beginning at day 3 and completely by day 4 after infection) the levels of cytokines and chemokines were assessed in BAL fluid samples from each group of mice after 7 days of infection. hMPV-infected mice with IFN-2 showed a significantly reduced release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1. no significant changes in the production of IL-1 and IL-1 were observed. recombinant hMPV (rhMPV) and a mutant hMPV lacking G protein (rhMPVG) were infected with lambda interferon for 24 h. expression of hMPV G and N genes was assessed by qRT-PCR. expression of lambda interferon genes was determined by qRT-PCR. the presence of hMPV G protein significantly inhibited the expression of IFN-1, IFN-2/3, and IFN-4. expression of lambda interferon genes was significantly increased in cells infected with rhMPVG. hMPV G protein inhibits the expression of IFN- in vitro and in vivo. the virus genotype was confirmed by analyzing the expression of hMPV N and G genes. the effect of rhMPVG on the expression of IFN-2/3 in vivo was also determined by infecting BALB/c mice with 105 PFU of rhMPV or rhMPV G. FN-1, IFN-2, and IFN-3 have been reported to be antiviral cytokines producing an effect similar to that of IFN-/ (10) the antiviral state induced by IFN- appears to be specifically expressed by epithelial cells and, as a consequence, to induce protection mostly at epithelial surfaces (16, 18) primary human bronchial/epithelial (NHBE) cells. these data are in line with our previous observation that hMPV infection is a stronger inducer of the overall IFN-/ response than RSV infection in vitro and in vivo (23, 37, 38). Interestingly, we observed that IFN-4 production was almost absent in RSV-infected cells but was highly induced by hMPV infection. a time-dependent pattern of expression different from those seen with rhIFN-3 (12.5 to 100 ng/ml) and infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (43, 44) in vivo, we first determined level of induction of IFN-2/3 in hMPV-infected mice. in mice, the IFN-1 gene is a pseudogene (45) and expression of IFN-4 has not been reported. IFN-2/3 expression, induced by hMPV, was regulated by IRF-7 expression. both IRF-3 and IRF-7 may regulate the induction of IFN-1. but IFN-2/3 is mostly regulated by the expression of IRF-7. tis B virus (HBV) mice treated with 10 g and 100 g of mrIFN- showed rather modest inhibition of HBV replication (50) however, the antiviral effect of IFN- seems to be selective, as IFN- did not have any effect on in vivo replication of other RNA viruses. production of several inflammatory mediators has been reported in infants and mice infected with hMPV. production of several inflammatory mediators was altered in IFN--treated mice. hMPV induced lower levels of IL-6, IL-1, IL-10, G-CSF, CXCL1, CXCL9 and CXCL11. the production of IFN- in hMPV infection appears to be regulated by expression of the attachment G protein by inhibiting at least the MDA5 pathway. however, we do not rule out the possibility of a role of a toll-like receptor pathway in the production of IFN- in response to hMPV infection."}
