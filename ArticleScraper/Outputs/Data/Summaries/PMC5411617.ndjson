{"summary": "PDCoV is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus (PDCoV) it causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in piglets (1\u20134). it is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. it has been detected in at least 20 states of the united states. type I IFN binds to its surface receptor at two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and induces heterodimerization of the receptor subunits. cytoplasmic domains of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are activated and phosphorylate. STAT1 and STAT2 are then phosphorylated by JAK1 and TYK2. PDCoV nsp5 suppressed type I IFN signaling by cleaving STAT2. nsp5 strongly inhibited IFN--induced ISRE promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in HEK-293T cells. PDCoV nsp5 antagonizes type I IFN signaling. HEK-293T cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with a PDCoV nsp5 expression plasmid or vector. after 24 h, cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 12 h. based on the crystal structures of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp5 (PDB accession number 4ZUH) using Modeller, version 9.14, software and compared it with the three-dimensional (3D) structures of PEDV nsp5 (alpha-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp5 (beta-CoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (gamma-CoV) secondary structural elements of PDCoV nsp5 are represented as spirals for -helix, for 310 helix, arrows for -strands, and T for -turns. arrows indicate conserved enzymatic proteolysis residues. PDCoV nsp5 inhibits type I IFN signaling by targeting STAT2. the endogenous protein level and phosphorylation of JAK1, TYK2, STAT1 and STAT2 were not affected by PDCoV nsp5. however, STAT2 phosphorylation was impaired by PDCoV nsp5 after IFN- treatment. antibody, phospho-JAK1 (P-JAK1) antibody, and phospho-TYK2 (P-TYK2) antibody were used to detect each endogenous protein. the level of endogenous STAT2 and phosphorylation were both reduced under the expression of PDCoV nsp5. nsp5-mediated reduction in endogenous STAT1 expression was not investigated further in this study. PDCoV nsp5 cleaves STAT2 through its protease activity. hek-293T cells were cotransfected with STAT2 and various concentrations of PDCoV nsp5. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type PDCoV nsp5 and STAT2 expression plasmids. cells were treated with MG132 or Z-VAD-FMK for 8 h. mRNA and protein levels of endogenous STAT2 were determined in PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 cells. a cluster of potential nsp5 cleavage sites was suggested to be in the carboxyl-terminal region of STAT2. the two cleavage products of STAT2 were longer than STAT21\u2013637, indicating that the recognized Q residue should be located at the C-terminal region (residues 637\u2013864) of STAT2. a double mutant (STAT2-Q685A-Q758A) was constructed and cotransfected into HEK-293T cells with PDCoV nsp5. the results showed that STAT2-Q685A-Q758A was resistant to cleavage. PDCoV nsp5-mediated cleavage impairs STAT2. PDCoV nsp5-mediated STAT2 cleavage impairs the ability of STAT2 to activate type I IFN signaling. PK-15 cells were cotransfected with STAT1, IRF9, and wild-type STAT2 or the indicated deletion mutant. after 32 h, cells were harvested for luciferase assays. mRNA levels of ISG15, ISG54, ISG56, and OAS1 were detected by qPCR. PDCoV nsp5 strongly inhibited IFN-induced ISRE promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in HEK-293T cells. cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with a PDCoV nsp5 expression plasmid or vector. after 24 h, cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 12 h. PDCoV nsp5-mediated inhibition of type I IFN signals requires its protease activity. nsp5 (beta-CoV), and IBV nsp5 (gamma-CoV) are conserved in the 3D structures of PEDV nsp5, SARS-CoV nsp5, IBV nsp5, and PDCoV nsp5. this finding suggests that the protease activity of PDCoV nsp5 is involved in antagonizing type I IFN signaling. secondary structures of PDCoV nsp5 are represented as spirals for -helix, for 310 helix, arrows for -strands, and T for -turns. the homology model of PDCoV nsp5 was generated based on the crystal structures of PEDV nsp5. PDCoV nsp5 inhibits type I IFN signaling by targeting STAT2. the endogenous protein level and phosphorylation of JAK1, TYK2, STAT1 and STAT2 were not affected by PDCoV nsp5 after IFN- treatment. however, STAT2 phosphorylation was impaired by PDCoV nsp5 after IFN- treatment, and the expression of total STAT2 was reduced. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with a flag-tagged JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2 or IRF9 expression plasmid along with PDCoV nsp5. no cleaved products were detected with JAK1, TYK2, STAT1, or IRF9 cotransfection. nsp5-mediated reduction in endogenous STAT1 expression was not investigated further in this study. PDCoV nsp5 induced STAT2 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. also, STAT2 cleavage was not observed in cells cotransfected with nsp5 H41A or nsp5 C144A. PDCoV nsp5-induced STAT2 cleavage was not affected by treatment with caspase inhibitor MG132. LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014. cells were harvested for STAT2 mRNA detection by qPCR at 18 h postinfection. mRNA and protein levels of endogenous STAT2 were determined in PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 cells. a cluster of potential nsp5 cleavage sites was suggested to be in the carboxyl-terminal region of STAT2. mutants STAT2 consisting of amino acids (aa) 1 to 637 (STAT21\u2013637), STAT21\u2013719, and STAT21\u2013758. the two cleavage products were longer than STAT21\u2013637. Q685 and Q758 are the sites of PDCoV nsp5-mediated STAT2 cleavage. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the STAT21\u2013637, STAT21\u2013719, or a STAT2 mutant as indicated. cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. full-length STAT2, individual deletion mutants, or mixed deletion mutants were cotransfected with STAT1 and IRF9. the luciferase activity of ISRE-Luc significantly decreased under the expression of any cleaved fragments. mRNA levels of ISGs, such as ISG15, ISG54, and OAS1 were also not sufficiently induced by the cleaved STAT2 fragments. viruses have developed strategies to inhibit type I IFN signaling. STAT2, an essential component of ISGF3 activity, is hijacked by viral proteins. NS5 proteins of flaviviruses target STAT2 for degradation. PDCoV nsp5 cleaves NEMO to reduce type I IFN production. role of PDCoV nsp5 in both IFN production and IFN signaling blockage suggests that PDCoV nsp5 limits the IFN-induced antiviral state in infected cells. however, relative impact of either NEMO or STAT2 in cells with PDCoV infection is unclear. human STAT2 could not be cleaved by the nsp5 of all tested human coronaviruses. however, whether cleavage of STAT2 is unique to PDCoV nsp5 requires further evidence in other coronaviruses. it is well known that STAT2 exhibits several functionally conserved regions, such as the critical tyrosine residue (Y690), which is phosphorylated to mediate STAT heterod peptides EKANLQ685ERKKYL and LEPMLQ758STLEPV (P6 to P6\u2032; numbering based on STAT2; downward arrows indicate cleavage sites) recognized by PDCoV nsp5 at the P1 and P2 positions are generally conserved substrates for all CoVs. however, glutamic acid (E) at the P1\u2032 position, which shared a large negatively charged side chain responsible for Q the main chain of the P2\u2032 residue formed two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of A26. previous studies showed that PEDV nsp5 tolerates the positively charged side chain of arginine (R) of PEDV N protein and a larger hydrophobic residue, valine (V), of NEMO at the P1\u2032 position for cleavage. this suggests a broader selection in PDCoV nsp5 substrate recognition. carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are marked as black, blue, and red circles. hydrophobic interactions are indicated by an arc with spokes radiating toward the ligand atoms they contact. at least 10 proteins have been identified as IFN antagonists. PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 was isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea in china in 2014. nsp5 gene was amplified and cloned into pCAGGS-HA-C with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag.
