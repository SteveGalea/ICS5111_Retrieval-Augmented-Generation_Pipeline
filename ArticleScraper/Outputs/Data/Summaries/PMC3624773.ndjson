{"summary": "the biological effects of interferons (IFNs) are complex. they reflect the impact of these cytokines on hundreds of cellular genes. they have been used clinically as antiviral agents and for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. the proapoptotic effects of ISG54/IFIT2 likely contribute to both antiviral and antiproliferative actions of IFN. there are 3 families of IFN cytokines that bind to 3 distinct cell surface receptors associated with Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 dimer and other STAT dimers recognize a DNA sequence with an inverted repeat, the IFN-activated site, originally described in the type II IFN pathway. the promoter of the ISG54/IFIT2 gene has an ISRE that binds ISGF3 and it is robustly induced in response to type I and III IFNs. ISG54 is one of the genes induced directly in response to activated IRF3. apoptosis is one of the innate cellular defense responses. ISG54/IFIT2 is a newly identified mediator of mitochondrial cell death in the direct primary response to IFNs and PRRs. it was expressed in HeLa-transformed cells without IFN stimulation. the effect of mGFP or ISG54-mGFP expression was evaluated in cell cultures by flow cytometry. transient expression of a tetracycline-inducible ISG54-mGFP elicited a similar apoptotic death response. we tested the prediction that ISG54/IFIT2 contributes to apoptosis stimulated in response to IFN. pathways that lead to caspase activation have been described as extrinsic. a dominant-negative Fas-associated protein with a death domain and a caspase-8 cell-permeable inhibitor do not block apoptosis. the conformational change promotes Bax, Bak effector binding to mitochondria. current models indicate that the prosurvival Bcl2 proteins bind to and inhibit both the activators and effectors. but discerning the mechanisms that regulate their interactions and functions is an active field of study. a proteomic approach was used to identify the proteins that could associate with ISG54/IFIT2. endogenous proteins bound to tagged ISG54 were identified as endogenous ISG54/IFIT2, ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG60/IFIT3. expression of ISG54 with ISG54 has the effect of inhibiting apoptosis promoted by ISG54. monomer consists of 22 tandem antiparallel -helices; most are part of 9 TPR-like motifs grouped into 3 regions: N-terminal (helices 1\u20136), middle (helices 7\u20139) and C-terminal (helices 10\u201322), linked by long loops. recombinant ISG54 or ISG56 protein added to in vitro rabbit reticulocyte translation system was able to significantly reduce protein synthesis. the binding of ISG54 to the eIF3 subunits was proposed, thereby to inhibit translation. translational inhibition does not appear to be a primary means by which ISG54 promotes cellular apoptosis. a direct negative effect of ISG54 on translation of cellular mRNAs in vivo was not apparent. mice with an ISG54/IFIT2 gene knockout succumb to intranasal apoptosis. mice with an ISG54/IFIT2 gene knockout succumb to intranasal. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative-sense ssRNA rhabdovirus, has increased titers of VSV in the brains of knockout mice. the basis of the protective effect in the brain remains to be elucidated. ISG56 binds and inhibits the HPV E1 protein, which is essential for viral replication. several DNA and RNA viruses are associated with human cancers. ISG54 is induced by viruses in response to activation of viral PRRs. a subset of PRRs are activated during viral infection by binding dsRNA or uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphorylated (5\u2032ppp) RNA (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5), Pichlmair and others (2011) used affinity proteomics to search for proteins that bind 5\u2032ppp RNA. they identified ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG58/IFIT5. a major class of short noncoding RNAs is micro-RNA (miRNA) miRNAs are complementary to their target mRNAs and decrease gene expression by translational inhibition and/or mRNA degradation. translation expression of ISG54/IFIT2 has been reported to elicit several inhibitory effects. ISG54-mGFP or control mGFP were transfected with either 5\u2032-m7G-capped polyadenylated luciferase mRNA or polyadenylated luciferase mRNA regulated by the hepatitis C virus IRES. a direct negative effect of ISG54 on translation of cellular mRNAs in vivo was not apparent. knockdown cells were evaluated for markers associated with the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with migration and invasion in vivo. the knockdown cells were also evaluated for the establishment of tumors in NOD/SCID mice. mice with an ISG54/IFIT2 gene knockout succumb to intranasal infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative-sense ssRNA rhabdovirus. a group reported a protective role for ISG56/IFIT2 with a significant decrease in survival of VSV infection in knockout mice. the gain of function by ectopic expression in the absence of other ISGs has also been used to evaluate the impact of individual proteins on viral replication. most studies with ectopic expression of ISG54/IFIT2 and other members of the ISG/IFIT family have reported the inhibitory effects on infection by RNA viruses in tissue culture. authors propose that by modulating STING, ISG54 and ISG56 act as negative feedback regulators of IFN induction. ability of ISG54 and ISG56 to promote apoptosis was not addressed in this study. a major class of short noncoding RNAs is micro-RNA (miRNA) miRNAs are complementary to their target mRNAs and decrease gene expression by translational inhibition and/or mRNA degradation. a major class of short noncoding RNAs is micro-RNA (miRNA) it remains to be determined how this response contributes to the reported effects of ISG54 on tumor colonization and antiviral responses. the ISG54 gene is normally induced in response to type I and III IFNs, but is also induced directly in response to PRR activation of IRF3 during microbial infection."}
