{"summary": "the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 is considered a significant threat for the next influenza pandemic. the genetic variability of this virus makes it an unprecedented risk for the spread of the new virus strains. effective vaccines would play a key role in preventing dire predictions noted above. a tri-clade DNA vaccine encoding HA of clade 0, 2.3.2.1 and 7.2 elicits broadly neutralizing antibody responses against H5 clades and subclades. HA is considered a primary target for designing effective vaccines against H5N1 virus infection. reassortant virus may preferentially recognize human-type receptors and transmit efficiently in ferrets. the trimeric form of HA may significantly improve immunogenicity over monomeric HA in vaccinated mice against influenza A virus (IAV) infection. a recombinant vaccine covering the full-length HA1 region of H5N1 induced neutralizing activity against divergent strains of H5N1 influenza virus [15], suggesting that the oligomeric form of influenza virus HA plays significant roles against virus infection. recombinants with different conformations can induce strongest protective immunity against divergent strains of H5N1 virus. we constructed six recombinant proteins covering different lengths of HA1 of HA1. the expressed proteins were shown as monomers in the boiled samples. HA1-Fdc protein was previously expressed covering HA residues +3\u2013322 [15], corresponding to residues 13\u2013325 of H5 numbering. each fragment contains IL2ss signal peptide at the 5\u2032 terminus. predicted RBD region was indicated in black. er of 1: 2.1 108 was detected in the sera of mice vaccinated with all six proteins. truncated HA1 protein fragments containing suitable conformation have high immunogenicity. sera from 10 days post-last vaccination were used for the detection. protein fragment containing residues 13\u2013263 of HA1 is the CND in HA1. fusion protein containing Fd and Fc (HA-13\u2013263-Fdc) could induce strongest neutralizing antibody response. fusion protein containing Fd and Fc (HA-13\u2013263-Fdc) may be ideal immunogen. HA-13\u2013263 fused with Fd mainly form trimeric conformational structure. similar bands with almost identical molecular weight were detected in boiled and non-boiled conditions, indicating that HA-13\u2013263 fragment alone maintained a monomeric form. these particular bands were further confirmed in Western blot analysis by a HA1-specific mAb. no clear band was shown in HA-13\u2013263-His protein. oligomer was detected by a HA1-specific mAb in Western blot. the molecular weights of cross-linker samples were about 1-, 2- or 3-fold higher than that of the without-cross-linker samples. we immunized mice using purified HA-13\u2013263 proteins with or without Fd and/or Fc. HA-13\u2013263-Fdc and HA-13\u2013263-Fc induced higher titers of IgG antibodies against the HA protein than HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His. HA-13\u2013263-His induced the lowest antibody responses against the HA protein. ability of IgG1 (C) and IgG2a (D) antibodies to bind to HA-13\u2013263-His protein was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. data are presented as mean NT50 SD from five mice per group. HA-13\u2013263-Fdc, HA-13\u2013263-Fc, or HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His vaccination groups and HA-13\u2013263-His group or PBS control for the three H5N1 pseudoviruses. the titers of neutralizing antibodies are presented as mean SD of five mice per group. HA-13\u2013263 proteins with suitable polymeric conformation promote greater cross-protection than protein monomer. mice vaccinated with HA-13\u2013263 proteins were challenged with lethal dose of H5N1 virus from VN/1194 (clade 1) and SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4). HA-13\u2013263-fdc, HA-13\u2013263-Fc, or HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His vaccination groups and HA-13\u2013263-His group, or PBS control, for VN/1194 virus. only slight body weight loss (less than 3%) was found on day 6\u20138 in the mice vaccinated with HA-13\u2013263-fdc after challenge with VN/1194 and SZ/406H virus. cross-protective effect induced by HA-13\u2013263 proteins fused with or without Fd and/or Fc was further evaluated by detection of viral titers in the lung tissues of vaccinated mice. a significantly lower level of virus titers was detected in the mice vaccinated with HA-13\u2013263 proteins than those vaccinated with HA-13\u2013263-His proteins. the data are expressed as mean SD of viral titers 50% tissue culture infective dose (Log10TCID50/g) of lung tissues from five mice per group. the limit of detection is 1.5 Log10TCID50/g of tissues. recombinant truncated HA1 protein fragments fused with Fd and Fc. HA1-Fdc protein previously expressed covering HA residues +3\u2013322 [15], corresponding to residues 13\u2013325 of H5 numbering. all protein fragments induced high HA1-specific IgG antibodies in the vaccinated mice. no significant differences were detected in the sera collected from any vaccinated group. sera from 10 days post-last vaccination was used for the detection. HA-13\u2013263-Fdc vaccinated group elicited very strong neutralizing antibody response against AH-HA H5N1 pseudovirus, reaching a titer of 18.6 1045.7 104. this is significantly higher (P0.05) than that induced by the groups vaccinated with the other five truncated protein fragments. the protein fragment containing residues 13\u2013263 of HA1 is the CND in HA1 that could the top band from the non-boiled HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His sample line had a molecular weight almost 3-fold greater than the boiled line (monomer) similar bands with almost identical molecular weight were detected in both boiled and non-boiled conditions, indicating that HA-13\u2013263 fragment alone maintained a monomeric form. this indicates that HA-13\u2013263 fragment alone maintained a monomeric form. clear bands with high molecular weight were detected in HA-13\u2013263-Fdc, HA-13\u2013263-Fc and HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His proteins. HA-13\u2013263-Fdc showed the highest molecular weight oligomer, while no clear band was shown in HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His protein. HA-13\u2013263-Fdc showed the highest molecular weight oligomer, the proteins without cross-linking (w/o cross-linker) were used as the controls. we immunized mice using purified HA-13\u2013263 proteins. HA-13\u2013263-Fdc and HA-13\u2013263-Fc induced higher titers of IgG antibodies against the HA protein. ability of IgG1 (C) and IgG2a (D) antibodies to bind to HA-13\u2013263-His protein was detected using mouse sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. data are presented as mean A450 SD of five mice per group at various dilution points. the data are presented as mean NT50 SD from five mice per group. difference between HA-13\u2013263-Fdc, HA-13\u2013263-Fc, or HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His vaccination groups and HA-13\u2013263-His group or PBS control for the three H5N1 pseudoviruses. HA-13\u2013263 proteins with appropriate polymeric conformational structures were capable of inducing a significantly higher level of antibody responses and cross-neutralizing activity than monomeric protein covering the same neutralizing fragment against H5N1 virus infections. mice vaccinated with the above fusion proteins were challenged with VN/1194 (clade 1) and SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) 263 proteins challenged with lethal dose of H5N1 virus from VN/1194 (clade 1) (A) and SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) (B) indicates significant difference (P0.05), respectively, between HA-13\u2013263-Fdc, HA-13\u2013263-Fc, or HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His group and HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His group. only slight body weight loss (less than 3%) mice that lost more than 25% of their initial body weight were humanely euthanized. results suggest HA-13\u2013263 proteins with suitable polymeric conformation could significantly protect vaccinated mice against various H5N1 virus challenges. cross-protective effect induced by HA-13\u2013263 proteins fused with or without Fd and/or Fc was further evaluated by detection of viral titers. mice vaccinated with HA-13\u2013263 proteins were used as the negative control. the data are expressed as mean SD of viral titers 50% tissue culture infective dose (Log10TCID50/g of tissues) the limit of detection is 1.5 Log10TCID50/g of tissues. a live attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara vector vaccine expressing influenza H5N1 HA induces substantial cross-clade protective immunity in vaccinated animals [33] a vero cell-derived, whole virus clade 2 H5N1 influenza vaccine is now in phase I/II study for safety and immunogenicity testing in healthy adults in Hong Kong and Singapore. the development of the vaccine has raised a serious concern about the safety of using the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV as a vaccine. we therefore constructed six truncated recombinant fragments covering partial or full-length RBD or other regions in HA1 for immunization of mice. only the one containing residues 13\u2013263 covering full-length RBD induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped H5N1 virus than other recombinant proteins conjugated with this motif have been shown to form stable trimers with improved antiviral activity. HA-13\u2013263 protein with Fd and Fc (HA-13\u2013263-Fdc) was able to form an oligomeric structure with the highest molecular weight, while those fused with Fd-His (HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His) formed different polymeric conformations, including dimer or trimer, with relatively lower molecular HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His protein with highest molecular weight oligomer induced strongest neutralizing antibody responses and cross-protection against challenges by two tested H5N1 strains. clade 1 and clade 2.3.4 followed by lower molecular weight polymers HA-13\u2013263-Fc (mainly dimer) and HA-13\u2013263-Fd (mainly trimer) al structures may significantly enhance cross-protective immunity against divergent strains of H5N1 influenza virus infections. oligomeric conformation could induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and cross-protection against two tested H5N1 strains covering clade 1 and clade 2.3.4. a 6 Histidine (His) tag was added at the C-termini of HA-13\u2013263 (HA-13\u2013263-His) and HA-13\u2013263-Fd (HA-13\u2013263-Fd-His) for easy purification of the proteins. plasmid encoding residues 13\u2013263 of HA1 with Fc (HA-13\u2013263-Fc) was constructed by inserting digested HA-13\u2013263 fragment boiled or boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and separated by 10\u201320% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) after blocking with 5% non-fat milk in PBST overnight at 4\u00b0C, the blots were incubated with a HA1-specific mAb (1500) developed in our laboratory for 1 h at room temperature. signals were visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm. 96-well ELISA plates were precoated with truncated HA1 protein fragments or full-length HA protein overnight at 4\u00b0C. serially diluted mouse sera were added to the plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. exogenous bacterial neuraminidase (NA) was added 24 and 48 h later. supernatant was harvested 72 h post-transfection for single-cycle infection. cell lysed by cell lysis buffer and transferred to 96-well luminometer plates. vaccinated mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 50% lethal dose (5 LD50) of VN/1194 (clade 1) or SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) H5N1 virus. five mice per group were sacrificed on day 5 post-challenge, and lung samples were collected for virological analysis. virus titer was determined by HA test. 50 l of 0.5% turkey red blood cells were added to 50 l of cell culture supernatant. wells containing HA were scored as positive. plasmid encoding residues 13\u2013263 of HA1 with Fc (HA-13\u2013263-Fc) was constructed by inserting digested HA-13\u2013263 fragment directly into the Fc vector. recombinant plasmids were then transfected into 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) seeded 24 h before transfection. the blots were incubated with a HA1-specific mAb (1500) developed in our laboratory for 1 h at room temperature. signals were visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm. 96-well ELISA plates were precoated with truncated HA1 protein fragments or full-length HA protein (eEnzyme, Gaithersburg, MD) overnight at 4\u00b0C and blocked with 2% non-fat milk for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. diluted mouse sera were added to the plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. supernatant was incubated with serially diluted mouse sera at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. fresh medium was added 24 h later, and the culture was continued for 72 h. cells were lysed by cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and transferred to 96-well luminometer plates. Vaccinated mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 50% lethal dose (5 LD50) of VN/1194 (clade 1) or SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) H5N1 virus, respectively, at 10 days post-last vaccination. infected mice were observed daily for 14 days for the clinical signs. ies were added to 50 l of cell culture supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. wells containing HA were scored as positive."}
