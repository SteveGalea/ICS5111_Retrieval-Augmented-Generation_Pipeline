{"summary": "the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) was established in 1952. the network provides support to both seasonal and pandemic influenza preparedness and response activities in areas such as diagnostics, vaccine development, virological surveillance and risk assessment. biannual recommendations are based on the virological and epidemiological information generated by the GISRS and play a crucial role in the development, production and availability of effective influenza vaccines. the continuing threat posed by avian H5N1, the aftermath of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the increased knowledge of influenza, and the development and availability of new technologies provide a timely opportunity. in equatorial regions, epidemiological considerations influence which recommendation (February or September) individual national and regional authorities consider more appropriate. their core activities include collating epidemiological information and diagnosing cases of influenza A and B infection. NICs in some settings then attempt to relate potentially important virological changes observed with clinical and epidemiological information and trends. typable using current WHO reagents, will immediately be reported to WHO. if required laboratory biosafety facilities and procedures are not available, then virus isolation should not be attempted in the national laboratory. criteria for forwarding viruses include temporal, geographical and agegroup distribution. the HAI test is likely to remain the assay of choice for the antigenic characterization of virus HA for the foreseeable future. resulting sets of reference viruses and antisera are then used to evaluate the antigenic characteristics of the HAs of recent isolates. complete genome sequencing is necessary to identify animal (including avian) viruses causing human infection and is important in detecting the emergence of reassortant viruses among cocirculating human viruses or between human and animal viruses. studies using human sera collaborate with the WHO ERLs in serological studies of representative human sera from previously vaccinated individuals. the technical advisory group considers the cumulative antigenic and genetic data on the viruses characterized by WHOCCs. the data are set against the broader epidemiological context collated by WHO and are supported by serological data from WHOCCs. to support the development of safe and effective human H5N1 vaccines, WHO has coordinated the development of a number of candidate attenuated vaccine viruses (Annex 1). clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of different H5N1 vaccine formulations and the breadth of antibodies elicited. the process impacts directly upon the subsequent authorizing of vaccine composition by national and regional regulatory authorities and upon the largescale production of vaccine by manufacturers. retrospective studies have shown that with very few exceptions WHO vaccine virus recommendations have closely matched the influenza viruses that have circulated during the following influenza season. weekly reports on the virological characteristics and epidemiology of circulating viruses are submitted to the WHO FluNet. a suitable NIC or other national influenza reference laboratory can conduct preliminary diagnostic testing using RTPCR protocols and/or reagents for H5, H7 and H9 subtypes provided by WHO. antigenic characterization Of prime importance in immunity to influenza is the production of antibodies to the virus haemagglutinin (HA) protein. such antibodies can neutralize the infectivity of viruses, and their level in the blood has been shown to correlate with the level of protection against infection with a homologous virus. phylogenetic analyses are carried out to better understand evolution of circulating viruses, their degree of genetic heterogeneity and the emergence of new genetic clades. antigenic variants may thus be defined in terms of separate genetic clades with distinct amino acid signatures. identifying amino acid substitutions also facilitates global monitoring of the emergence, distribution and impact of different genetic variants. influenza vaccine virus selection has primarily been based on the antigenic characterization of virus HA using the haemagglutination inhibition inhibition (HAI) assay. the HAI test is likely to remain the assay of choice for the antigenic characterization of virus HA for the foreseeable future. clades with distinct amino acid signatures help to identify individual substitutions associated with phenotypic (antigenic) changes. identifying such amino acid signatures also facilitates global monitoring of the emergence, distribution and impact of different genetic variants. the most recent virological and epidemiological data are shared and discussed via teleconferences held 6 and 2 weeks before the WHO vaccine composition consultation. a summary of each teleconference is promptly distributed to keep all NICs and vaccine manufacturers informed of the developing situation. the decision is announced at an Information Meeting immediately following each WHO consultation. the decision is announced at an Information Meeting immediately following each WHO consultation and published on the WHO web site. candidate vaccine viruses must still be isolated directly in eggs according to current regulatory requirements. the limited availability of egg isolates, particularly of recent H3N2 viruses, has led to the establishment of cooperative research and development agreements. in africa there are now 25 influenza laboratories in 21 countries. in less than two years, the percentage of African countries with an NIC increased from 17% to 26% with the number of countries with no influenza laboratory markedly decreasing. increased participation in internal and external quality assurance programmes has contributed to marked improvements in laboratory proficiency. identifying research priorities in influenza surveillance and response include evaluation of temporal and geographical circulation of influenza viruses and of the burden of influenza. establishing a sound evidence base will support the development of national, regional and global policies, plans and guidelines. this in turn could lead to greater acceptance of the use of influenza vaccines, particularly seasonal vaccines, and assist in the development of vaccination policies. a WHO Shipment Fund Project was established to overcome logistical and other obstacles to the safe and efficient shipping of clinical specimens and virus isolates. the project provides support to NICs and other influenza laboratories in all countries by arranging the transport of specimens and isolates along a guaranteed cold chain. there has been a significant increase in the number of countries sharing specimens and isolates. animal influenza surveillance coverage is limited with a shortage of epidemiological data on the circulation of various viruses in different countries. a more formal collaborative mechanism might allow for the improved integration of animal virus data into the WHO candidate vaccine virus selection process. increasing awareness of the content and extent of use of animal influenza vaccines would also aid understanding of their impact on virus evolution. global, regional and national training workshops, assessments and donations have led to significant increases in trained personnel, equipment procurement and laboratory capacity. recent WHO capacitybuilding activities have included BSL3 training courses for NICs to promote safe practices when working with highly pathogenic influenza viruses. a more systematic approach to engaging NIC information and expertise would lead to significant benefits. such an approach is likely to be facilitated by a number of developments in the use of WHO webbased tools. a better understanding of the diversity and evolution of animal influenza viruses is essential for evaluating the pandemic risk posed by subtypes currently causing sporadic human infections (such as H5N1 and H9N2) and informing the selection of candidate vaccine viruses. the emergence of H5N1 led to the establishment in 2005 of the OIE\u2013FAO network of experts on animal influenza. increased awareness of the content and extent of use of animal influenza vaccines would also aid understanding of their impact on virus evolution. inherent limitations in the biological assays used and significant variations in the results obtained by different laboratories complicate the collation and definitive interpretation of data. neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assays are being validated using ferret and human antisera. studies of NA antigenic variation have been limited, and the NA content of influenza vaccines is not currently standardized. efforts are under way to use MN assays for H1 and B viruses. this should facilitate the use of MN assays to overcome the variable nature of interactions between viruses and RBCs. improvements in automation will potentially enable more labourintensive MN assay to be applied to largescale serological analysis. studies providing estimates of vaccine efficacy over successive influenza seasons should improve understanding of the effects of small rather than major antigenic differences between vaccine and circulating viruses on clinical outcomes. advances in highthroughput genetic sequencing could potentially lead to a greatly enhanced understanding of the genetic changes occurring in influenza viruses. phylogenetic models have also been used to identify changes in selective constraints in relation to antigenic drift and interspecies transmission. phylodynamic modelling has already been successfully used to trace the emergence of new antigenic and genetic variants and track their geographical spread. changes in receptorbinding affinity or specificity associated with adaptation, antigenic drift or the isolation and passage of viruses in eggs and cell culture may also affect HAI titres. standardization between laboratories has proved difficult, and the assay is currently not suitable for a fully automated system. a number of different NAI microtitre assay formats have recently been developed. these have been used to correlate antigenic changes with sequence variations in the NA component. improved understanding of antigenic drift in NA and of the role of antiNA antibodies in conferring immunity might have significant implications for vaccine virus selection and vaccine development. countries should be supported in establishing well-characterized serum banks of agestratified representative sera as a national, regional and global resource. current advantages of the GISRS serological activities undertaken in support of vaccine virus selection include the use of shared serum panels and common antigens. limitations include the large variability of HAI data, a requirement for antibody standards and a need for MN or other assays to resolve inconsistencies. further development of highthroughput laboratory systems for integrated and automated genetic and phenotypic analyses offers the intriguing prospect of a futuristic standardized virtual network for virus characterization in an epidemiological context. ally stochastic nature of influenza evolution may make such predictive modelling extremely challenging. such predictive models might be better suited for use in understanding longterm effects of vaccination, optimizing timing and location of focused surveillance efforts and predicting possible consequences of the emergence of a novel virus. there has been no specific intention to provide a broader spectrum of immunity to circumvent the need for annual vaccine updates. recombinant vaccines are now under development, including protein subunit, DNA, vector and VLP vaccines. the feasibility of isolating seasonal vaccine viruses in qualified 1 cell lines is being evaluated. this would result in a greater choice of candidates, especially for recent H3N2 viruses. such virus isolates would not be subject to undesirable eggselected changes. such virus isolates would potentially provide a better match to the natural virus. global influenza surveillance is the foundation of the vaccine virus selection process. Efforts to enhance and strengthen national, regional and global laboratory capacity for virological surveillance and representative virus sharing must continue. collaboration between the GISRS and veterinary laboratories and organizations such as OFFLU has been greatly enhanced. new approaches to the generation of highgrowth vaccine viruses involving the use of reverse genetics and qualified cell cultures will continue to be evaluated and developed. new vaccine types currently under development may allow more flexibility in the timing of recommendations on vaccine virus composition. step 1\u20134: the collection, isolation and thorough antigenic and genetic characterization of recent virus isolates continues throughout the year. step 4a: comparisons of the recognition of representative recent viruses by vaccineinduced antibodies in human sera are conducted 2\u20133 weeks before the biannual WHO vaccine consultation meetings. step 8: Evaluation of their growth properties is conducted in a timely manner around the time of the WHO vaccine virus consultations. ofo None FDA, USA Dr Norman Baylor None NIC, Argentina Dr Jorge Augusto Camara None NIH, Thailand Dr Malinee Chittaganpitch None Imperial College London, UK Dr Neil Ferguson None TGA, Australia Dr Gary Grohmann None NIMR, UK Dr Alan Hay None CDC, USA Dr Paul Selleck None NIID, Japan Dr Masato Tashiro None Freelancer Dr Anthony L.
