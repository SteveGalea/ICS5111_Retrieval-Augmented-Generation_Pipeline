{"summary": "human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) or immunoglobulins (hIgs) prepared from the plasma of normal and convalescing human donors have been widely used to treat autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases. hpAbs from recovering patients or pre-vaccinated individuals are effective in treating infections caused by the same pathogens [3,4] transchromosomic (Tc) bovine system quickly produces diverse hpAbs in large quantities. this is significantly lower than the physiological serum IgG levels of 5-10 g/l in normal humans. if successful, the system may not be useful for treatment of diseases in which antigens are not well characterized. the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) plays critical roles for pre-B cell proliferation and maturation during B lymphogenesis. we reasoned that the poor B cell development and low hIgG production in these previously produced Tc cattle could be due to a compromised function of pre-BCR. hIGHM gene was replaced by the corresponding bovine gene sequence. modifications would restore the natural intra-species protein-protein interactions in the pre-BCR. we also envisioned that the bovinized CH-TM domain would also improve the functionality of hIgM. kb centromeric to the hIGH locus) and the other at AL391156 locus (about the 85 Mb centromeric to the AL512355 locus) in order to facilitate the identification of the correctly deleted DT40 cell clones, we also integrated a CAG promoter and a hisD selection cassette. such strategy ensured that only the correctly deleted hChr14 acquired puromycin resistance and was sensitive to hygromycin and histidino puro cassette was integrated at locus AL512355 with gene targeting vector p14CEN(FR)hygpurolox511DT. a lox511 sequence along with a CAG promoter and a hygromycin (hyg) selection cassette was then integrated at the RNR2 locus to generate 14D. a DT40 clone, 14D, containing the correctly modified hChr14. a DT40 clone, STL54, was identified to carry the correctly modified hChr22. the intact hChr22 carried in a DT40 cell line, 52-18, was first truncated at the AP000350 locus with the targeting vector pTELCAGzeoSLFR. a DT40 clone, STL54, was identified to carry the correctly modified hChr22. the distance between AP000350 and AP000553, where the hIgL and hSLC are located, is about 2 Mb. we further modified this hChr2 fragment carried by a DT40 clone (named as TL1) to both truncate the hChr2 fragment and integrate the lox2272 and the promoter-less puro gene. the lower panel of the figure depicts the homologous recombination event mediated by the pTEL\u2019hisDpurolox2272F9R9 gene targeting vector. we translocated the hSLC and hIGL loci on hChr22 to the AC104134 locus adjacent to hIGK locus on hChr2 through Cre/loxP mediated site-specific chromosome recombination. puromycin resistant colonies were previously inserted at the AC104134 locus on the hChr2 and AP000553 locus on the hChr22. the translocated chromosome (carried by DT40 clone SLKH6) was transferred to plain DT40 cells by MMCT to generate clone SLKD18. cKSL-HAC was constructed in chicken DT40 cells. cKSLDH22 was induced for site-specific translocation between the two loxP sites. cKSLDH22 was finally identified as a DT40 hybrid clone. cell line retaining the cKSL-HAC was subjected to extensive genomic PCR, array comparative genomic hybridization and three-color FISH. DT40 clones carrying modified hChr14 (CH2D4) and modified hChr2/hChr22 (SLKD18), respectively, were fused by WCF to generate DT40 hybrid clone cKSLD22. cKSL-HAC/DKO bovine fibroblast donor cells were established by cloning cKSL-HAC/DKO cattle via MMCT. cells from the fibroblast colonies derived from MMCT were used as donors for somatic cell chromatin transfer (CT) in total, 314 embryo transfers were conducted, with 114 from cell colonies (Col) and 200 from fetal cell lines, and 17 healthy calves were produced. the retention rate of cKSL-HAC and its structural integrity in the produced Tc calves was examined both in the peripheral blood lymphocytes and fibroblasts established from ear biopsies of newborn calves. the retention rate of cKSL-HAC in three of the analyzed calves is shown in Figure 9c. anti-hIgM antibody can still recognize the retained CH 1 domain of the bovinized hIgM. cKSL-HAC/DKO calves showed higher percentage IgM-single positive (IgM+) and IgM/CD21-double positive (IgM+/CD21+) B cells in PBMCs from newborn animals. bovine immunoglobulin light-chain genes lambda and kappa were not genetically knocked out in such Tc cattle. expression of human light-chain loci on the HAC would be easily overwhelmed by the endogenous bovine light-chain locus. we also analyzed the IgG subclass distribution in the plasma of such Tc animals. immunizing two Tc cattle with a human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line as an antigen, we performed a flow cytometry-based immunofluorescence assay. the titer against human tumor cells from fully hIgG is significantly lower than that from total hIgG. the titer against human tumor cells from fully hIgG is significantly lower than that from total hIgG. we integrated two lox511 sequences into hChr14, one at the AL512355 locus (about 300 kb centromeric to the hIGH locus) and the other at AL391156 locus (about the 85 Mb centromeric to the AL512355 locus) in order to facilitate the identification of the correctly deleted DT40 cell clones, we also integrated a CAG promoter and a hisD selection cassette along with the lox511 sequence lox511 sequence along with promoter-less puro cassette was integrated at locus AL512355 with gene targeting vector p14CEN(FR)hygpurolox511DT. following Cre expression, the 85 Mb genomic sequence was removed rendering puro expression. a loxP sequence and a GFP reporter cassette was then integrated at the RNR2 locus to generate 14D. a DT40 cell clone, CH2D4, was confirmed by extensive genomic PCR genotyping experiments. the upper line shows the genomic configuration of the CH 1-TM2 domain of hIgM, the middle line shows the gene targeting vector pCH2CAGzeoDT. the bottom line depicts the modified CH2-TM2 domain of hIgM in a DT40 cell clone, CH2D4. sequence and a hygromycin selection cassette at locus AL391156, respectively. such strategy ensured only the correctly deleted hChr14 acquired puromycin resistance and was sensitive to hygromycin and histidinol (hisD) the correctly deleted colonies were screened by genomic PCR and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) bovine genomic DNA used for gene targeting vector construction were cloned from an isogenic bovine genomic phage library. a DT40 cell clone, CH2D4, was confirmed by extensive genomic PCR genotyping experiments. the bottom line depicts the modified CH2-TM2 domain of hIgM in a DT40 cell clone, CH2D4. the intact hChr22 carried in a DT40 cell line, 52-18, was first truncated at the AP000350 locus with the targeting vector pTELCAGzeoSLFR. through extensive genomic PCR screening, a DT40 clone, STL54, was identified to carry the correctly modified hChr22. truncation event deleted all the non-immunoglobulin chromosomal sequences between this locus and the p-arm on hChr2. DT40 colonies were screened with genomic PCR for the correctly modified hChr2. clone K53 was identified and selected for the final HAC construction. a DT40 clone K53 carrying the hChr2 fragment with the previously inserted hisD-lox2272-promoter less puro and hyg-loxP cassettes. a DT40 clone STL54 carrying the hChr22 fragment with the previously inserted bsr cassette and lox2272, were fused via whole cell fusion (WCF) to generate DT40 hybrid cells. omycin resistant and blasticidin S sensitive colonies were screened by extensive genomic PCR. candidate clones were further confirmed by two-color FISH using the hChr2 painting probe labeled with Rhodamine and the hChr22 painting probe labeled with Fluorescein. we chose clone SLKD18 for subsequent HAC engineering. cKSL-HAC was constructed in chicken DT40 cells. DT40 clones, CH2D4 containing the CH2D HAC and SLKD18 containing the SLK HAC established above were fused by WCF to generate DT40 hybrid clone cKSLD22. cKSLDH22 was induced for site-specific translocation between the two loxP sites at the cos138 locus on the SLK HAC. chromosomes in cKSLDH22 clone were confirmed by three-color FISH. the presence of the three human immunoglobulin loci, hIgH, hIgK and hIgL as a single HAC was confirmed by three-color FISH. the structural integrity of the constructed cKSL-HAC was further examined by extensive genomic PCR, array comparative genomic hybridization and three-color FISH. embryos developed to the blastocyst stage were singly transferred into recipient cows. some of the established cell lines were also used for cKSL-HAC/DKO cattle cloning. cKSL-HAC retention rates in cKSL-HAC calves 1921, 1922 and 1923 analyzed by FISH. cKSL-HAC/DKO calves demonstrated higher percentage IgM-single positive (IgM+) and IgM/CD21+ (CD21+) B cells. CD21-double positive (IgM+/CD21+) B cells in PBMCs from newborn animals were compared between HAC/DKO and cKSL-HAC/DKO calves. we measured serum concentrations of total hIgG, i.e. all the hIgG regardless of whether it pairs with human lambda or kappa (hIgG/hIg/) light-chains or bovine lambda or k cKSL-HAC/DKO Tc cattle produce high titer antigen-specific hpAbs. cKSL-HAC/DKO cattle produce high titer antigen-specific hpAbs. the titer against human tumor cells from fully hIgG is significantly lower than that from total hIgG. this was expected due to the fact that bovine immunoglobulin light-chain genes have not been genetically inactivated in these Tc cattle and only roughly 8% fully hIgG is produced. we chose bovine for the large body size, which makes it feasible to collect large volumes of plasma, a prerequisite for producing large amounts of therapeutic hpAbs. however, our initial success in producing antigen-specific fully hpAbs in the Tc cattle system was limited by the relatively low levels of total hpAbs production and the low level of fully hpAbs production. animal derived antibodies are more desirable as a biotherapeutic. this is especially true for long-term repetitive treatments. we have recently knocked out the bovine lambda light-chain gene cluster. animals may have to be euthanized due to unfortunate events like terminal illness and trauma. methods of euthanasia must follow the guidelines given by the AVMA. a 7.3kb homologous arm was subcloned into Bam HI site of plasmid pPUR. the second homologous arm (amplified by using a PCR primer pair, kD-F9 and kD-R9, in 40 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s and 68 \u00b0C for 9 min) was cloned into Bam HI site of plasmid pTEL\u2019hisD pDRIVE-CAG (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) was modified by replacing the lacZ fragment (Bsr GI-Eco RI) with the loxP-containing oligo DNAs (Oligo DNA pair 2). then the bsr gene was added to Spe I site to generate pCAGloxP2272bsr. pCAGlox511hisD plasmid was cloned into Spe I site to generate pCAGlox511hisD. the not I-Kpn I fragment (CAG-lox511-polyA-hisD) was cloned into the Eco RV site of pSC355F3R3. the dT-A cassette was cloned into not I site to complete pCAGlox511hisD. dT-A cassette was subcloned into the Hpa I site of p14CEN(FR)hygpurolox511DT. a genomic phage library was constructed using FIX II vector. a 1.7 kb of Pml I fragment from one of the positive phage clones was cloned into Sma I site of pBluescript to generate pCH1S (F) sac I fragment from pBCAY37-95 was cloned into pBluescript. then floxed CAGzeo was cloned into Van91 I site to generate pmAYSazeo. dT-A cassette was cloned into not I site of the pCH1zeo. 1.7 kb of Pml I fragment from above clone 4 was subcloned into Sma I site of which Eco RV site was converted to Mlu I site, generating pCH2S (F) dT-A cassette was subcloned into Not I site of the pCH2CAGzeo (F) to complete the pCH2CAGzeoDT.
