{"summary": "patients 4 and 5 were believed to have contracted SARS on a flight from Hong Kong to china. four of the patients progressed rapidly to respiratory failure and were intubated. 73 healthcare workers were exposed to patients 1 and 2. serum samples were collected twice from 206 healthcare workers during a 1-month period after the initial exposure to patients with SARS. the sensitivity of the ICT test was >90% within 2 weeks of fever onset and 100% after 6 weeks (8). the specificity of each assay determined by 812 serum samples was 100%. p value Masks 0.001 0.001 None 36 0 20 0 17 0 Surgical mask, N-95 or P-100 respirator 37 155 26 132 20 92 Gloves 0.001 0.001 0.001 None 57 7 28 4 17 2 One- or two-layer 16 148 18 128 20 90 Eye protection 0.001 0.001 0.001 No 73 117 46 99 37 66 Glasses, goggles, or face shields 0 38 a serologic response to SARS-CoV could not be demonstrated in 205 healthcare workers who spent time in the same room as or had direct contact with SARS patients. the major question that arises from this study is why 36 (50%) healthcare workers who stayed in the same room with SARS patients were not infected. phylogenic tree analysis (9) indicates that patients 2, 3, and 6 were infected by strains related to the large outbreak in amoy Gardens in Hong Kong (2). patients 4 and 5 were infected by strains related to a large hospital outbreak in Taipei (10)"}
