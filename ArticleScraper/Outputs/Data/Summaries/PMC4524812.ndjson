{"summary": "bronchiolitis is responsible for more than 100000 hospitalizations annually. 5% to 30% of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis require pediatric intensive care. many institutions have established bronchiolitis order sets and pathways. bronchioles contribute to airways obstruction, along with intraluminal debris (D) macrophages are the predominant inflammatory cell type in the submucosal infiltrates and intraluminal locations. more than 500 clinical laboratories, many of which are maintained by academic centers, participate in the national Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) a virology-positive diagnosis of RSV or another well-established bronchiolitis-causing agent would possibly help distinguish cases of bronchiolitis from asthmatics with first-time acute wheeze. a virology-positive diagnosis of RSV or another well-established bronchiolitis-causing agent would possibly help distinguish cases from asthmatics with first-time acute wheeze. bronchiolitis scoring system has poor construct validity for overall respiratory status and limited discriminative ability to determine major clinical outcomes like length of stay[19]. RDAI is the most common scoring system for bronchiolitis, the RDAI. weisgerber et al[23] developed a model to predict prolonged duration of stay based on age, dehydration, work of breathing, and initial heart rate. a clinical score for bronchiolitis that accurately reflects relevant indicators of bronchiolitis outcomes could potentially enable research on earlier interventions. the proscription against a bronchodilator trial in the latest AAP bronchiolitis guideline will need to be reconciled with both asthma biology and long-term efforts to modify the natural history of childhood asthma. bronchiolitis is directed at first-time wheezing infants receiving beta2-agonists. exclusion criteria for studies on first-time wheezing infants included prior history of wheeze, previous bronchodilator or steroid use, and underlying lung or cardiac disease. most of the studies excluded patients requiring intensive care. bronchiolitis guideline recommends against routine chest radiography in children with bronchiolitis. but detection of radiographic atelectasis in more severe disease may be clinically important. atelectasis in severe bronchiolitis is highly correlated with worse clinical outcome. chest physiotherapy trials in bronchiolitis were conducted on small numbers of subjects. a randomized trial on the use of cough assist in acute bronchiolitis is currently underway. the literature on chest physiotherapy should be regarded as limited to non-critically ill bronchiolitis. the most recent Cochrane review on hypertonic saline therapy for acute bronchiolitis was undertaken on 11 inpatient and outpatient studies. all of the trials excluded patients with prior wheeze or severe bronchiolitis. the concentration of hypertonic saline was 3% in all but one trial, which included both 3% and 5% concentrations. the development of an institutional protocol could reasonably implement hypertonic saline for every admitted patient with acute bronchiolitis. we applaud the 2014 revision of the AAP guideline on bronchiolitis and suggest further research to help guide clinical therapies."}
