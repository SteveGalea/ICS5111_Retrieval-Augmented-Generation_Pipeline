{"summary": "trypsin inhibitors are divided into Kunitz type [11], Bowman-Birk type [12,13], and squash type [4] some of the proteins display a variety of biological activities, such as antifungal [9], immunomodulatory [5] and antitumor/antiproliferative [8,10] activities. y activity was located in fraction D2 when fraction D2 was subjected to affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel. the activity was recovered in the larger unadsorbed fraction B1 (data not shown) Upon ion exchange chromatography on SP-sepharose, fraction B1 was resolved into a small unadsorbed fraction S1 and two large adsorbed fractions (S2 and S3) of approximately equal size.

Different letters indicate statistically-significant differences. assay of GBTI for inhibitory activity toward HIV\u20131 integrase. gold bean trypsin inhibitor (GBTI) is unadsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel, but adsorbed on DEAE-cellulose. this chromatographic behavior is distinctly different from that of other leguminous antifungal proteins which are unadsorbed on the ion exchanger. gold bean trypsin inhibitor is devoid of any inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase and SARS coronavirus proteinase. the absence of antifungal activity in gold bean trypsin inhibitor is also in agreement with the observation on some trypsin inhibitors. the supernatant was collected and loaded on a 5 20 cm column of deAE-cellulose (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) after removal of unadsorbed proteins, the column was eluted sequentially with 0.2 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl. trypsin inhibitory activity was carried out by addition of test sample (20 L) to 160 L of a 1% casein solution in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) trypsin (20 L of a 0.5 mg/ml solution) was then added and the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min before 0.4 mL 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate the reaction. purified trypsin inhibitor (2.5 M) was incubated in a water bath at different temperatures from 20 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C for 15 min, then immediately chilled on ice. reaction mixture was subjected to trypsin inhibitory activity. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 cells (1 104) were seeded into each well of a 96-well culture plate. radioactive precursor, 1 Ci ([3H-methyl]-thymidine, from GE Healthcare), was then added to each well and incubated for another 48 h. recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase alyzes the cleavage of the substrate. a fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of the protein was used. the inhibitory activity of the protein was calculated as percent inhibition compared to a control without the protein [15]. the pellet was homogenized in 50 mL

20 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C for 15 min. after centrifugation, the absorbance of the supernatant, which reflects the amount of casein fragments, was measured at 280 nm. purified trypsin inhibitor (2.5 M) was incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) at the final concentration of 2.5, 10 and 40 mM for 5, 20, and 80 min at 37 \u00b0C. the reaction was terminated by adding iodoacetamide at twice the amount of thiol functions at each DTT concentration. the remaining trypsin inhibitor activity was measured at pH 7.4. incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA. plasmid that expressed his-tagged wild-type HIV-1 integrase was grown at 37 \u00b0C until OD600 reached 0.7\u20130.8. cells were induced by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside) the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-mL chelating Sepharose column. the column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. the protein was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 20% glycerol) e reaction was performed in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM MnCl2,
