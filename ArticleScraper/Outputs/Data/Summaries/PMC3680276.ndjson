{"summary": "canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is an important pathogen in domestic dogs and several wild carnivore species. CPV-2 is a small non-enveloped, singe-stranded DNA virus (5.2 Kb) the antigenic types CPV-2a and CPV-2b differ from the original CPV-2 in at least five or six amino acids/residues of the VP2 capsid protein. residue 297 is located in a minor antigenic site close to epitope B and substitutions at this position may be responsible for changes in antigenicity of CPV variants. for/Hrev primers, 1 giant panda and 62 dog samples yielded a specific amplicon of 611 bp respectively. the amplified PCR products of 11 randomly selected canine samples were subjected for sequencing using primer pair Hfor/Hrev. all the CPV samples under study were found to be new CPV-2a (CPV-2a with nucleotide variation TG at position 3675) three additional mutations were observed in the canine parvovirus sequences under study. one was at nucleotide position 3584 where a mutation (UA) resulting in the codon change from UUCUAC, with amino acid variation 267-PheTyr. this variation only was revealed in strain B11 (the giant panda sample) maximum likelihood tree (Mega-5.1 beta version) constructed using canine parvovirus sequences under study and reference sequences. other sequences had distinct lineage but shared molecular relationship with new CPV-2a reference strains. new CPV-2a/2b strains appear to have replaced the prototype CPV-2a/2b strains and become the predominant types in many countries [22-26] in china, the prevalent antigenic type in canine populations is type 2a, our results seem to confirm these data. all the CPV clinical samples under study were found to be new CPV-2a. the novel point mutation virus is most likely not a panda-adapted virus spreading among pandas, but more likely a spill-over from dogs. the virus VP2 gene coding change at nt 3894 (glnArg) was interesting because it has not been detected previously in any other strains. the CPV-2 vaccine appears to provide a comparatively lower and shorter immunity against heterologous CPVs. in many countries, such as Europe, CPV-2a has been overtaken by CPV-2b or CPV-2c. cross-antigenic evaluation revealed clear differences among the CPV variants. all activities followed the legal requirements and institutional guidelines set out by the government of P.R. China. the collected samples were emulsified in 2 ml of 0.1 M PBS of pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C.
