{"summary": "seasonal cyclicity is a ubiquitous feature of acute infectious diseases [1] and may be a ubiquitous feature of human infectious diseases in general. the concept of an epidemic calendar is the idea that seasonality is a unifying feature of epidemic-prone diseases. in the absence of control measures, the local calendar can be marked by epidemics. the timing relates to the birthing season; peaks in the summer in humans. the timing relates to the birthing season; peaks in the summer in humans.

Discrete windows of transmission are likely to have evolutionary consequences for parasite life history. disease mitigation behaviors include grooming to remove ectoparasites (as observed in birds and primates) and self-medication (as observed in primates, birds, and monarch butterflies) there are, however, very few studies of seasonality in risk-taking and risk-mitigation behavior. each of the

throughout the year. wildlife and urban human populations exist at opposite extremes of a continuum of exposure and/or subjection to natural environmental cycles. wildlife could serve as a model for developing methods and conceptual frameworks needed to disentangle the contribution of environmental cycles and behavior from other drivers of disease transmission. the study of isolation in time may reveal pathogen metapopulation structure. the Tasmanian devil contact network varies between the mating and nonmating seasons. mating and aggression can elevate disease risk, but some behaviors can
