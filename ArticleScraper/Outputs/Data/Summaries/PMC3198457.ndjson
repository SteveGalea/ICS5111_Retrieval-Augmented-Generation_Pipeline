{"summary": "the ability to rapidly detect and distinguish multiple infectious organisms is critical for the accurate diagnosis of seasonal and sporadic outbreaks [1], [2], [3], [4]. Accurate pathogen identification allows clinicians to determine the need for additional ancillary diagnostic testing, antibacterial or antiviral therapy and can inform decisions regarding hospitalization and infection control measures [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. PCR has several practical limitations. multiplex PCR is an attractive diagnostic option for respiratory infections for several reasons. the differential diagnosis of respiratory infections includes a large number of potential pathogens that cause similar signs and symptoms. emergence of novel pathogens that may result in severe disease requires availability of diagnostic testing with enough flexibility to introduce new targets rapidly. nested PCR increases sensitivity over conventional PCR due to the ability to perform up to 50 or 60 total cycles of PCR. nested primer sets are similar to probe-based assays, as all 4 primers must match the template [1], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51]. an integrated system that can interrogate a clinical sample for a broad range of pathogens is highly desirable in both diagnostic laboratory and clinical settings. the fitment contains 12 reservoirs (6 mm inner diameter on 9 mm spacing) that hold the biochemical reagents. a lyophilized pellet of silica-magnetic beads is inserted into blister \u201cE\u201d. the film is sealed shut under vacuum. the second stage primer sets are dispensed into the wells of the array using the standard GeSiM Nano-Tip. the arrays are sealed with a second layer of laminating film containing a matching array of holes. the layers of film and adhesive attaching the array to the pouch are separated to show the flow of liquid into the cells of the array. pouches are placed in a Genesis Lyophilizer (VirTis, Gardiner, NY) the plunger tree is pushed down into the fitment so as to preserve the vacuum in each of the wells. the pouches are packaged in a cylindrical aluminum can and sealed under vacuum inside an aluminized polyester bag. assays were designed with a first stage PCR amplicon length of 145 to 450 (median 193) base pairs. degeneracy of up to 64-fold was used in some primer designs in order to accommodate sequence diversity. on Type 1 300 BoV NP-1 Clinical Sample 4000 B. per Toxin A639 4,000 C. pne ompA TW183 3000 CoV 229E Polymerase VR-740 4 CoV HKU1 Nucleoprotein PCMC 6123 1.9106 CoV OC43 Nucleoprotein VR-759 600 CoV NL63 Nucleoprotein NR-470 5 EV 5\u2032 UTR Echovirus 6 30,000c hMPV Nucleo erovirus based on the combination of 6 different assays (HRV1\u20134, Entero1 and Entero2) can be obtained at much lower concentrations (300 TCID50/mL) the flu A Matrix and NS1 gene assays are referred to as \u201cpan1\u201d and \u201cpan2\u201d respectively. a 3 ml syringe fitted with a blunt metal cannula. the cannula is inserted into the hydration port where it breaks a septum in the port. the vacuum in the fitment draws liquid to fill wells 2 through 11 (80 l each) magnetic beads are concentrated in blister \u201cE\u201d with the magnet and washed 3 times with buffer from wells 3, 4 and 5. cDNA synthesis and outer multiplex PCR Reverse transcription and first stage PCR occur in blisters \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d. a mechanical hot start is achieved by holding the second stage PCR master mix/diluted template mixture at 90\u00b0C while the array is heated to 75\u00b0C. the array is then flooded with this mixture which hydrates the inner primers in their individual wells. to seal the PCR wells shut, a clear plastic bladder in the instrument is inflated over the array after it is flooded. run is declared 'Invalid' and no organism results are reported. for each well, curve shape and peak location analyses of the melt curve are used to make a \u201cPositive\u201d (amplicon present) or \u201cNegative\u201d call. the final test result of \u2018Detected\u2019 or \u2018Not Detected\u2019 is based on the assay call. the data used to validate the algorithm were acquired during clinical trials of the filmArray system and RP pouch at the Medical University of South Carolina (Frederick S. Nolte, PhD), Detroit Medical Center (Hossein Salimnia, PhD), and Children's Medical Center of Dallas (Beverly Rogers, M.D.) the institutional review boards of the University of Utah and PCMC approved this study and granted a waiver of informed consent because the patient samples were de-identified. the test compares the number of discordant results shown in the off diagonals of the paired 22 table to estimate the probability that the two methods have equal sensitivity and specificity. we chose to use the terms positive % agreement and negative % agreement to report the test characteristics of the filmArray respiratory panel. negative percent agreement (sensitivity) is the percent of time that FilmArray RP detected a virus when DFA detected it. the test does not provide the user with the information to determine that one method is more sensitive or the other is more specific. the pouch is comprised of an injection molded polypropylene reservoir (the fitment), 120 mm long, 10 mm wide, 25 mm high, \u201cA\u201d in Figure 1B. filmArray pouch was injected with mock sample (here colored blue for illustrative purposes) in the left side injection port and hydration solution (colored red) in the right side injection port. in this pouch the plunger tree was made from plastic dyed blue. the fitment and film are normally at right angles to each other. array to the pouch are separated to show the flow of liquid into the cells of the array. the layers are: 2nd pouch film, 1st pouch film, array adhesive layer (orange), array cover film, array (black, with wells), and array cover film. Arrows show flow of PCR master mix (without primers) entering the array through a hole cut in the 1st pouch film. the filmArray instrument is 39.1 cm long25.4 cm wide16.3 cm high and weighs 8.2 kg. it communicates with PC side software through USB and IEEE 1394 (FirewireTM) cables. assays were designed with a first stage PCR amplicon length of 145 to 450 base pairs (median 193) bp. primer sites for the second stage PCR amplicons were located within the first stage PCR amplicon. degeneracy of up to 64-fold was used in some primer designs. Flu A Matrix and NS1 gene assays are referred to as \u201cpan1\u201d and \u201cpan2\u201d respectively in the text. a final result of Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus can be obtained at much lower concentrations (300 TCID50/mL) 1st and 2nd stage assays were initially tested separately to ensure that they produced the expected amplification product. RNA assays were dependent on the presence of reverse-transcriptase in the reaction mix. the first and 2nd stage primers were then combined as a singleplex. a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) in PBS or a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) in viral transport medium is mixed with two volumes of a denaturing sample buffer. the loaded pouch is then inserted into the filmArray instrument. the pouch and sample are identified to the instrument by the operator using a hand-held bar code reader. cDNA synthesis and outer multiplex PCR occur in blisters \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d. PCR master mix from well 7 of the fitment is pushed into blister \u201cF\u201d. a mechanical hot start is achieved by holding the contents of the blisters separate (using a hard seal between them) until they reach 54\u00b0C. the first stage PCR consists of 26 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 4 seconds followed by 60\u00b0C for 19 seconds. amplicon melt analysis After the final PCR cycle the sample is held at 63\u00b0C for 5 sec followed by a linear ramp in temperature from 68\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C at a nominal rate of 0.5\u00b0C/second. images are acquired 10 times per second. the force for this disruption comes from a rotating metal bar located behind the plane of the pouch shown in Figure 1. Nucleic acid purification Total nucleic acid in the sample is isolated by moving the sample lysate across the silica-magnetic beads particles present in well \u201cE\u201d a mechanical hot start is achieved by holding the second stage PCR master mix/diluted template mixture at 90\u00b0C while the array is heated to 75\u00b0C. the array is then flooded with this mixture which hydrates the inner primers in their individual wells. to seal the PCR wells shut, a clear plastic bladder in the instrument is inflated over the array after it is flooded. second stage PCR conditions are 94\u00b0C for 4 seconds and 63\u00b0C for 19 seconds for 30 cycles if the controls return positive results, the run is declared 'Invalid' and no organism results are reported. for each well, curve shape and peak location analyses of the melt curve are used to make a \"Positive\" or \"Negative\" call. the data used to validate the melt calling algorithm were acquired at sites performing beta testing of the instrument. the data were acquired during clinical trials of the filmArray system and RP pouch at the medical university of south Carolina (Frederick S. Nolte), Detroit Medical Center (Hossein Salimnia, PhD), and Children's Medical Center of Dallas (Beverly Rogers, M.D.) TI and PCMC were blinded to DFA results while evaluating NPA samples using FilmArray. the test compares the number of discordant results, shown in the off diagonals of the paired 22 table (Table 2). 0.9 (87.1\u201393.9) 0.001 Neg 1 280 RSV Pos 37 9 94.9 (82.7\u201399.4) 96.9 (94.2\u201398.6) 0.035 Neg 2 280 a Positive or Negative test result comparing FilmArray RP (new test) to DFA (reference standard subject to error) the first stage PCR is run for 26 cycles. the completed first stage PCR mixture is diluted and then mixed into fresh PCR reagents. dilution of less than 100 fold caused a reduction in sensitivity. pathogens were chosen in consultation with pediatric infectious disease experts. the assays were initially optimized in conventional PCR instruments. a successful set of assays for 23 targets from 21 pathogens was transferred to the filmArray RP pouch. the amplification curves for the B. per assay replicates have a Cq of 5. This is the earliest Cq observed in the system. the amplification curves for the B. per assay replicates have a Cq of 5. all of the fluA target amplicons are detected, with similar Cqs and Tms as found for the fluA sample alone. the assays amplify and produce the expected characteristic melts. the sample did not inhibit the pouch chemistry. Detection rates of the filmArray RP pouch compared to DFA. the percent of samples in which no virus (Negative) or one of the indicated viruses was detected is shown. the viruses are grouped into those in which both DFA and FilmArray assays are available. the automated analysis of the melt curves produced a positive result for the fluA pan1 and pan2 assays (2 or more of the 3 replicates were positive) and a negative result for the FluA H1 pan assay (only one melt curve was positive) the theoretical melting temperature of a DNA sequence on the filmArray instrument was calculated using the model (modified from [66]) predicted Tms for these variants were calculated using the mathematical model determined above (the data for hMPV are shown in Figure 7A) this distribution of Tms was used to establish the expected melt range for each assay. data from 74 hMPV-positive patient samples collected during the clinical evaluation. the melting curve detection algorithm was optimized using a large training dataset. the majority of the data generated at Idaho Technology was derived from contrived samples spiked with dilution series of the various target organisms. the results of the automated analysis of the FilmArray RP system resulted in sensitivity and specificity >99.6%. the results of the automated analysis of the filmArray RP system resulted in sensitivity and specificity >99.6%. sensitivity of detection was comparable between samples containing a single organism and those containing up to five different organisms. sensitivity of each assay was appropriate for accurate detection of clinically relevant pathogen levels in NPS specimens. for the first 25 cycles of the 1st stage multiplex reaction, amplification of specific product is efficient. each additional 1st stage cycle reduces the Cq in the nested reaction by one. the first stage PCR is run for 26 cycles. cleotide in the first stage PCR master mix and the appropriate nested assay monitor all steps from the first stage PCR forward. a different DNA oligonucleotide is spotted into the array along with the appropriate forward and reverse primers to monitor the second stage PCR. a panel of assays were designed to detect viruses and bacteria known or suspected to cause upper respiratory tract infection in humans. the amplification curves for the B. per assay replicates have a Cq of 5. This is the earliest Cq observed in the system and represents dilution and second stage amplification of an outer amplicon that has fully entered plateau in the first stage reaction. the B. per is detected early (low Cq), with similar Cqs and Tms as found for the fluA sample alone. the assays amplify and produce the expected characteristic melts. the sample did not inhibit the pouch chemistry. hMPV samples were tested either by DFA at PCMC (yellow bars) or on the filmArray (Blue bars) the percent of samples in which no virus (Negative) or one of the indicated viruses was detected is shown. the automated analysis of the melt curves produced a positive result for the fluA pan1 and pan2 assays. a robust signal can be detected in the melt curves for the same sample. the theoretical melting temperature of a DNA sequence on the FilmArray instrument was calculated using the model (modified from [66]. the model was used to determine the range of possible Tms for amplicons from each different organism assay. this distribution of Tms was used to establish the expected melt range for each assay. Tm data generated during the system beta-testing with 37 banked hMPV-positive patient samples. 74 hMPV strains representing subtypes A1, A2, B1 and B2 are included in this data set. the results of the automated analysis of the FilmArray RP system resulted in sensitivity and specificity >99.6%. the results of the automated analysis were compared to expert interpretation. y detected in 95% or more of the samples tested was based on serial dilutions. additional samples were prepared and tested at the estimated LoD concentration. sensitivity of detection was comparable between samples containing a single organism and those containing five different organisms. the filmArray is a realization of a \u201cLab-on-a-Chip\u201d or TAS system. it implements the highly sensitive and specific technique of nested multiplex PCR in an enclosed disposable, the FilmArray pouch. this enables the considerable benefits of this form of PCR to be realized in settings where moderate contamination risk of pathogen or of amplicon is unacceptable. the filmArray first stage multiplex PCR uses all of the nucleic acid recovered from the input material. the second stage amplification allows specific detection of the analytes in individual 1 l PCRs without the loss of sensitivity common in small volume PCRs. nested PCR simplifies the development of complex multiplex PCR panels. in the filmArray RP pouch described here, there are two pan-influenza A assays (pan1 and pan2 for the MA and NS2 genes respectively) this increases the likelihood that either one or the other pan assay will be reactive. nmPCR is also highly resistant to target competition. initial testing of the filmArray RP pouch with clinical samples showed high percent agreement. the most common reason for discordance was the detection of pathogens by filmArray in DFA-negative samples. a subset of the assays in the RP pouch have recently been cleared by the FDA for IVD use. the filmArray pouch implements the highly sensitive and specific technique of nested multiplex PCR in an enclosed disposable, the filmArray pouch. this enables the considerable benefits of this form of PCR to be realized in settings where even moderate contamination risk of pathogen or of amplicon is unacceptable. the filmArray lab-in-a-pouch is also an efficient solution to the \u201csample to assay\u201d problem that many microfluidics systems must solve. the second stage amplification allows specific detection of the analytes in individual 1 l PCRs without the loss of sensitivity common in small volume PCRs. nested PCR simplifies the development of complex multiplex PCR panels. in order to detect viruses with great sequence diversity, the first stage PCR contains moderately degenerate primers. the first stage PCR does not inhibit the detection of a second organism present at low concentration (10 LoD95) this occurs because the first stage PCR is not the direct readout for the presence of each analyte. instead it gives the lower concentration organism adequate amplification boost. the filmArray instrument and a subset of the assays in the RP pouch have recently been cleared by the FDA for IVD use. the clinical studies performed to support the filmArray application to the FDA used NPS as the sample matrix."}
