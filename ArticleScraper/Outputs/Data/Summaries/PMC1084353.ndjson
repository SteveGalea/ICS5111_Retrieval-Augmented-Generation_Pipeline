{"summary": "pregnant women's fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may deter patients from seeking routine care from hospitals and/or interrupt patient's continuity of care. compared to the pre-SARS period, medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market share for childbirth services during the peak SARS period. people's fears originated with the novelty of the disease, its rapid nosocomial transmission, and the apparent vulnerability of hospitals and health care workers. many people started to wonder whether the overwhelming fears of SARS directed at the regional hospitals and medical centers changed a patient's care seeking behavior and even physicians' treatment patterns. the national health insurance program provides a mandatory and comprehensive universal health care coverage for all Taiwanese residents. both vaginal and cesarean deliveries are covered and no co-insurance is required for child delivery. the program offers patients complete freedom of choice among providers and methods of delivery. this study retrieved all 448,365 NHI in-patient claims for childbirth from January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2003. vaginal deliveries were those coded with the NHI Case Payment-DRG 0371A and 0373B. each claim cites the patient, provider, diagnoses, treatment procedures, mode of delivery, and admission and discharge dates. the national health insurance program provides a mandatory and comprehensive universal health care coverage for all Taiwanese residents. both vaginal and cesarean deliveries are covered and no co-insurance is required for child delivery. the program offers patients complete freedom of choice among providers and methods of delivery. this study retrieved all 448,365 NHI in-patient claims for childbirth from January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2003. vaginal deliveries were those coded with the NHI Case Payment-DRG 0371A and 0373B. each claim cites the patient, provider, diagnoses, treatment procedures, mode of delivery, and admission and discharge dates. a dramatic drop in market share was observed for both the medical centers and the regional hospitals during the SARS epidemic. compared to the pre-SARS period (t0), medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market share during the peak SARS period (t2). district hospitals and clinics increased 2.1% and 7.1%, respectively. ARS Period (MayJun 2003) Post-SARS Period (SepDec 2003) Difference Difference Accreditation Level No. % No. % No. % No. % No. % Medical Center 3,044 15.9 1,820 10.7 2,574 13.9 -1,225 -5.2 -471 -2.0 Regional Hospital 4,731 24.7 3,501 20.6 4,415 23.8 -1,230 -4.1 -316 -0.8 District Hospital 5,067 2 section rates in regional, district hospitals and clinics dropped significantly during post-SARS period from their levels before the SARS epidemic. the overall average length of stay decreased from 3.40 days to 3.25 days from the pre-SARS period (t0) to the peak SARS period (t2), and then returned to 3.39 days after the SARS epidemic (t4). a dramatic drop in market share was observed for both the medical centers and the regional hospitals during the SARS epidemic. a dramatic drop in market share was observed for both the medical centers and the regional hospitals during the SARS epidemic. on average, there were 2,189 fewer deliveries each month during peak SARS period than during pre-SARS period (t0) medical centers and regional hospitals dropped 5.2% and 4.1% in market share during peak SARS period (t2) but district hospitals and clinics increased 2.1% and 7.1% respectively. compared to the pre-, peak- and post-SARS period, we observed only a marginal decrease in overall cesarean rate (1.0%). but a significantly larger increase in cesarean rate in medical centers (2.2%) and significantly decrease in clinics (1.9%) during peak SARS period (t2). the average cesarean section rate in medical centers returned to the pre-SARS level during the post-SARS period. average LOS in most hospitals and clinics returned to the pre-SARS level. however, as soon as the SARS epidemic ended, average LOS in most hospitals and clinics returned to the pre-SARS level. t0 t2 t4 t2-t0 t4-t0 Pre-SARS Period (Jan 2002Feb 2003) peak SARS Period (MayJun 2003) post-SARS Period (SepDec 2003) Difference Difference C-Section obstetricians should be aware and extremely cautious about sudden substantial patient shift and strong demand of shorter length of maternity stay posed by the public's fear of such an outbreak. obstetricians should be well prepared to deal with these consequences during an outbreak. obstetricians should be aware and extremely cautious about sudden substantial patient shift and strong demand of shorter length of maternity stay. this study only shows the immediate impacts of the fears of SARS on the shifting of patients from one facility to another, as well as their length of stay. if in the post-SARS period, mother's and child's morbidity and mortality remained the same, the residual increase of child births in clinics and district hospitals would be a positive impact since it reduces health care costs without compromising health outcomes. a re-emergence of a SARS epidemic or any other pandemic should be part of the long term solution. Taiwan's experience could provide valuable lessons to other countries in assessing full impacts of the SARS epidemic."}
