{"summary": "the universal genetic code uses 64 codons to represent the 20 standard amino acids and the translation termination signal. each codon is recognized by a subset of a cell's transfer ribonucleotide acid molecules (tRNAs) the genetic code is remarkably conserved, although it is still in a state of evolution. mycobacteriophages have the potential to be used in diagnosis of tuberculosis. codon usage analysis was previously done for fourteen phages by Sau et al. [40]. the sequences in which Nc values are 30 are highly expressed. those with >55 are poorly expressed genes. RSCU is used to observe the synonymous codon usage variation among the genes. the complete genome sequences of 32 mycobacteriophages were downloaded from GenBank. genes having more than 100 codons with proper start and stop codons were selected. the analysis was carried out by GCUA [41], CODONW 1.4.2 (http://codonw.sourceforge.net/). RSCU values are used for CA in order to minimize the amino acid composition. to estimate the codon usage variation between these two sets of genes we have performed Chi square tests taking P.01 as significant criterion.
