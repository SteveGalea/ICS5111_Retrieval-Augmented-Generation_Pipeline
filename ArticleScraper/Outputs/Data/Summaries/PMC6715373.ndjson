{"summary": "emerging and reemerging highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses are a significant threat to global public health. this threat is illustrated by the appearance of several highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013CoV (MERS-CoV) and pathogenic strains of influenza viruses (1, 3). MERS-CoV has infected 2374 individuals and caused 823 deaths. the innate antiviral response, particularly production of IFN- and IFN-, constitutes the first line of defense against multiple virus infections. IFN-I mediates antiviral effects by directly inhibiting virus replication and indirectly modulating the host immune response to virus infection. rIFN- therapy caused a striking increase in IFN, ISG, and inflammatory cytokine levels, resulting in fatal disease in an otherwise sublethal infection. results demonstrate that timing of IFN- receptor signaling relative to peak virus replication is a critical determinant of protective and pathogenic immunity. we did not detect MERS-CoV-MA in heart, liver, spleen, or kidney tissue. but even in absence of IFN-I signaling, MERS-CoV infection is limited to the lungs in hDPP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV-MA titers in the indicated organs at 4 dpi as determined by plaque assay. naive mice infected with 200 to 250 PFU MERS-CoV-MA showed lung edema and neutrophil infiltration. MERS-CoV-MA replication and IFN (IFN- and IFN-) responses in the lungs of hDPP4-Ki mice. previous studies showed that TLR7/MyD88 and MDA5/MAVS pathways are critical mediators of coV RNA sensing and IFN induction in plasmacytoid DCs and bone marrow\u2013derived macrophages. six days after transduction, we infected mice with MERS-CoV-EMC virus. we measured lung IFN transcript levels at 1 and 2 dpi. we found significantly reduced IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- expression in the lungs of TLR7\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with expression levels in B6 mice. RNA sensing and IFN-I production in hDPP4-KI mice. titers and IFN-mRNA levels in lungs from hDPP4-KI mice at different time points. there was a significant reduction in the total number of IMMs in the lungs of -IFNAR\u2013treated mice at 2 and 4 dpi compared with controls. neutrophils in the lungs produced significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 compared with control mice. mRNA levels of IFNs, ISGs, and cytokines and chemokines on different days after MERS-CoV-MA infection in control and -IFNAR\u2013treated mice. lungs from -IFNAR\u2013treated mice had significantly lower transcript levels of IFN-, ISGs (ISG-15 and CXCL-10), and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF, IL-6, CCL-2) at early time points (2 d mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN- and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were significantly higher by 7 dpi in -IFNAR\u2013treated mice compared with levels in control mice. blocking IFN-I signaling led to reduced numbers of MERS-CoV\u2013specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs. 6-Ly5.1, hDPP4-KI, or IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 donor mice were adoptively transferred into hDPP4-KI, B6-Ly5.1, or IFNAR/ recipient mice. chimeras were infected with a sublethal dose of MERS-CoV-MA. hDPP4-KI mice lost more weight than did B6-Ly5.1 hDPP4-KI mice. IFN-, IFN-, and ISG-15 in the lungs at 2 dpi and increased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcript levels at 2 dpi (TNF) and 6 dpi (IL-6 and CXCL-1) these data suggest that IFNAR signaling in hematopoietic cells is essential for virus clearance and protection against mortality following MERS-CoV-MA infection. rIFN- treatment significantly reduced MERS-CoV-MA gRNA expression in the lungs at 2 and 4 dpi. early rIFN- treatment also reduced the frequency and number of lung-infiltrating IMMs and the number of neutrophils at 4 dpi. lungs of rIFN-treated mice at 4 dpi were less activated. reduced expression of CD80 and lower numbers of TNF+ IMMs. early treatment with rIFN- protects host from mortality. rIFN- treatment caused lethal disease in mice sublethally infected with SARS-CoV. mice treated with rIFN- at 2 dpi showed only a 3- to 4-fold reduction in viral RNA levels at 3 dpi. the levels were similar or trended higher at 5 and 7 dpi. we detected increased frequencies and total numbers of IMMs and neutrophils in the lungs of rIFN-treated mice at 5 and 7 dpi. we also observed reduced virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in the lungs of mice treated with rIFN- at 2 dpi compared with controls. titers in the lungs at 3, 5, and 7 dpi in mice treated with PBS or rIFN- (2 dpi, delayed treatment) mRNA levels of ISGs and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of PBS- or rIFN-treated mice. a total of 415 genes were differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted P 0.001; log2 fold change >1.5) in the lungs of infected mice treated with early (1 dpi) or delayed (2 dpi) rIFN-. expression levels of genes involved in viral nucleic acid sensing, ISGs, IFN-related transcription factors, and several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were markedly lower. coV-MA (200 PFU) were treated with 750 U rIFN- at 1 dpi (early, A\u2013D) or 2 dpi (delayed, E\u2013H) mice were euthanized 2 days after rIFN- treatment (3 dpi for mice in the early rIFN- treatment and 4 dpi for mice in the delayed rIFN- treatment groups) 77 genes were differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted P 0.001; log2 fold change >1.5) in the lungs of mice that received delayed rIFN- treatment compared with PBS control lungs. IPA revealed an upregulation in the expression of genes involved in complement activation and coagulation (Thbs1 and Serpine1), macrophage activation, and inflammatory pathways. -IFNAR\u2013treated mice infected with LD50 dose of MERS-CoV-MA. 100% of the -IFNAR\u2013treated mice succumbed to MERS-CoV-MA infection. -IFNAR\u2013treated mice lost more weight than the control mice. FN-I signaling is protective during i.n. infection with 1 105 PFU MERS-CoV-EMC. MERS-CoV-EMC titers in lungs determined by plaque assay at 2 and 5 dpi. 0.001 (B, F\u2013H, and J) was calculated using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. TLR-7 is the primary sensor of MERS-CoV RNA in airway epithelial cells. a delayed IFN-I response relative to peak lung virus titers correlated with severe disease in a mouse model of SARS (14) adenovirus 5\u2013expressing human DPP4 transduces the majority of airway and alveolar epithelial cells. most of these Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced cells are infected with MERS-CoV-EMC (36) hDPP4-KI mice with deletion of MAVS or TLR7 are not available. a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (MA15) showed that signaling of both TLR7 and MAVS was essential for IFN induction in the lungs. this was demonstrated by reduced IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- mRNA levels in the lungs from TLR7\u2013/\u2013 and MAVS\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with lungs from WT controls. blocking IFN-I signaling modulates inflammatory monocytes and macrophages and neutrophil responses to MERS-CoV infection. we then measured immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels in the lungs of control and hDPP4-KI mice. total DC and NK cell numbers in the lungs were lower in -IFNAR\u2013treated mice at 2 and 4 dpi. this suggests an effect of IFN-I signaling on the accumulation of these cells. lungs from -IFNAR\u2013treated mice had significantly lower transcript levels of IFN-, ISGs (ISG-15 and CXCL-10), and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF, IL-6, CCL-2) at early time points (2 dpi, and in some cases, 4 dpi) levels of CXCL-1, a neutrophil chemoattractant, were significantly increased on 4 dpi in -IFNAR\u2013 blocking IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells is essential for virus clearance and host protection. blocking IFN-I signaling in epithelial cells, hematopoietic cells, or both could be required for protection from a viral infection. infection of BM-derived cells from hDPP4-KI mice with MERS-CoV failed to produce infectious virus. mERS-CoV gRNA levels were similar in hDPP4-KI and hDPP4-KI mice at 2 dpi. we also measured mRNA levels of IFN, ISG, and other inflammatory cytokines in the chimeric mice. loss of IFN-I signaling in hematopoietic cells caused reduced transcript levels of IFN- and IFN-, IFN-, and ISG-15 in the lungs at 2 d chemokines (D) in lungs from BM chimeric mice (hDPP4-KI hDPP4-KI and IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 hDPP4-KI) were calculated using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with a 95% CI and a P value of less than 0.05 considered significant. the timing of peak IFN response determines disease outcome. expression of ISGs was downregulated by 4 dpi in the rIFN-\u2013treated group compared with expression in the control mice. levels of ISG-15, CXCL-10, CCL-2, and TNF were not different between the groups at either 2 or 6 dpi. early rIFN- treatment also reduced the frequency and number of lung-infiltrating IMMs. mRNA levels of ISGs (D) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (E) in PBS- or rIFN-treated (1 dpi) mice. mRNA levels of ISGs (D) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (E) determined at 4 dpi. delayed rIFN-I signaling caused lethal disease in mice sublethally infected with SARS-CoV. mice treated with rIFN- at 2 dpi showed only a 3- to 4-fold reduction in viral RNA levels at 3 dpi. rIFN- administration at 2 dpi resulted in significantly higher levels of ISG and inflammatory cytokine mRNA (ISG-15, CXCL-10, CCL-2, and we depleted IMMs using -CCR2 antibody at 2 and 4 dpi. mice with IMM depletion were protected from mortality compared with mice receiving a control antibody. these results suggest that delayed IFN-I signaling or late treatment with rIFN- failed to effectively control virus replication. data were pooled from 2 separate experiments (B and F\u2013H, left panels, I, left panel, and J) data were analyzed using a 2-tailed Student\u2019s t test with *P 0.05, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001, and ****P 0.0001. Differential gene expression profiles in the lungs following early and late IFN treatment. PRRs, IFN regulatory factor activation by cytosolic receptors, and IFN signaling were all decreased in the group that received early rIFN- treatment. hDPP4-KI mice infected with 750 U rIFN- were treated with 750 U rIFN- at 1 dpi (early, A\u2013D) or 2 dpi (delayed, E\u2013H) 77 genes were differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted P 0.001; log2 fold change >1.5) in the lungs of mice that received delayed rIFN- treatment compared with delayed rIFN-\u2013treated mice. IPA revealed an upregulation in the expression of genes involved in complement activation and coagulation (Thbs1 and Serpine1), macrophage activation, and inflammatory pathways. treatment increased the expression of a subset of genes associated with inflammation. IFN-I is critical for kinetics of virus clearance and has no effect on maximum titers reached in the lungs. depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells results in suboptimal virus clearance. reduced numbers of IMMs and increased neutrophil infiltration may be due to altered IMM and neutrophil chemokine production in the absence of IFN-I signaling. hematopoietic cell type, if any, is the dominant source of IFN during MERS-CoV infection. pDCs and possibly macrophages are the sources of IFN in infected mice. dependent IFN-I expression in Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced cells will require further investigation. results are similar to previous studies that showed more severe clinical disease and slower kinetics of virus clearance in IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 and Myd88\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with WT and MAVS\u2013/\u2013 mice after Ad5-hDPP4 transduction. delayed IFN treatment resulted in a robust proinflammatory response. delayed IFN treatment did not improve virus clearance. ineffective control of virus replication is likely due to IFN and ISG antagonism by viral proteins. this variability in expression of inflammatory mediators most likely occurred because IFN-I administered to an experimentally infected animal or patient functions in the complex inflammatory milieu of the lung. our results demonstrate a critical role for IFN-I in facilitating virus clearance and host survival during MERS-CoV. mice were anesthetized using xylazine-ketamine and i.n. infected with a 200 to 250 PFU (sublethal), 500 PFU (LD50) or 1000 PFU (lethal) dose of MERS-CoV-MA in 50 L DMEM. mice were euthanized on different days after challenge, lungs were removed and homogenized in PBS. titers are represented as PFU/lung. Lungs were minced and digested in HBSS buffer containing 2% FCS, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mg/mL collagenase D (Roche) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase (Roche) for 30 minutes at room temperature. digested tissues were then pressed through a 70-m cell strainer to remove particulate matter. all flow cytometric data were acquired on a BD FACSVerse (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). antibodies and rIFN- for surface and intracellular staining, cells were incubated with the following antibodies specific for mouse antigens. monocyte and neutrophil depletion Young, 7- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were treated with blocking -IFNAR monoclonal antibody (clone MAR1-5A3, Bio X Cell) at \u20136 hours (750 g) and on day 1 (250 g) the same concentrations of mouse IgG1 (clone MOPC21) were used as a control antibody.
