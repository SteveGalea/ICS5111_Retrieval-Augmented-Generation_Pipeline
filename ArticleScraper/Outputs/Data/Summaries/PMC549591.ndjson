{"summary": "direct sequence analysis of the pathogen is generally thought to be too cumbersome, technically difficult, and expensive. we present here a novel application of mass spectrometry (MS)\u2013based technology in characterizing viral sequence variations that overcome these problems. we apply it retrospectively to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. new sequence-based techniques for pathogen detection and identification have the potential to become perhaps the most important component of these investigations. the discovery of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiological agent for SARS was a major breakthrough [1], which was quickly followed by the successful sequencing of the whole genome of the virus. sensitivity study analyzed cultured viral isolates and uncultured tissue samples of SARS-CoV. five in vitro samples were generated by spiking 200-l human whole-blood samples with SARS-CoV virus obtained from a vero E6 cell culture of an anonymous Singapore patient. all the patients fitted the case definition for probable SARS [8] RNA was extracted from 200 l of blood into 50 l of water using a highPure RNA kit. RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using 2 l of RNA as template. cDNA samples were then resuspended in 20 l of water. sensitivity analysis was designed for each SARS-CoV SNV using SpectroDesigner software. one microliter of cDNA (equivalent to 0.1 l of RNA from 1 l of spiked human blood) was used as template in each analysis. five in vitro samples were generated by spiking 200-l human whole-blood samples from an anonymous Singapore patient. RNA was extracted from 200 l of blood into 50 l of water using a highPure RNA kit. RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using 2 l of RNA as template, a superScript kit and 13 sequence-specific primers. real-time quantitative PCR analyses of the RNA samples from spiked human blood were performed using a lightcycler Sars-CoV quantification kit (Roche) each analysis was done using 1 l of RNA and in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. the viral RNA copy numbers in five spiked human blood samples were quantified by real-time PCR analysis. the three samples (SB3, SB4 and SB5) with the lowest virus copy numbers were used to determine the sensitivity of the MS-based assay. nine of the 18 SNVs analyzed, nine were detected in at least two SARS isolates. the pattern of the shared variants among the nine viral isolates clearly indicated two major molecular lineages of isolate. the four fifth- and six-generation isolates are separated into three different sub-lineages. these are defined by three distinct variants: C:T:T:C in the isolate from patient Sin842, T:T:C in the isolate from patient Sin849, and T:C:C:T in the isolates from patients Sin852 and Sin848. the detected sequence variations in the four new isolates supported the three-sub-lineage pattern in the later Singapore isolates. six of the 72 direct sequence variation comparisons were due to heterogeneous sequences in primary tissue samples. the cultured isolate from patient Sin849 showed the sequence variant T:T:C at SNV positions 548, 1,727, and 13,347, a subset of the heterogeneous T/C:T/C variant observed in the matched lung tissue sample from the same patient. the sequence of the isolate from the german patient was determined to be T:C:G:A at these SNV positions. the sequence variant at position 19,084 was detected only in the early Singapore isolates [5,6] and is clearly different from the C variant at position 19,084 observed in the Vietnam-originated isolates [6,14]. sensitivity of the MS-based assay for detecting SARS-CoV sequence variations was measured by analyzing eight SNVs in in vitro human blood samples spiked with SARS-CoV. the viral RNA copy numbers in five spiked human blood samples were quantified by real-time PCR analysis. the pattern of the shared variants among the nine viral isolates clearly indicated two major molecular lineages of isolate. one lineage includes the four early isolates from patients Sin2500, Sin2774, Sin2748, and Sin2677. the second lineage is defined by the sequence variant C:T:C. the detected sequence variations in the four new isolates supported the three-sub-lineage pattern in the later Singapore isolates. the detected sequence variations in the four new isolates supported the three-sub-lineage pattern in the later Singapore isolates. six of these differences were due to heterogeneous sequences in primary tissue samples. the cultured isolate from patient Sin849 showed the sequence variant T:T:C at SNV positions 548, 1,727, and 13,347. the heterogeneous variant T/C:T:C:T/C in the primary lung tissue sample revealed both of the two existing variants. german health authorities assumed that this patient was infected somewhere in Hanoi, Vietnam, although the possibility of him being infected could not be ruled out. we genotyped the virus directly from a brochoalveolar lavage specimen from the german patient at four SNV positions that were distinctive for the early Singapore SARS-CoV isolates. the molecular relationship between the viral isolates is not consistent with the current understanding of the clinical transmission relations between these patients. patients Sin2774, 2748, and Sin2677 were believed to have been infected directly by the index case Sin2500, and patient Sin2679 was infected by the index case through another, unidentified, primary patient. unidentified secondary SARS-CoV infection routes from Guangdong to Hong Kong were also suggested by the genetic characterization of SARS-CoV isolates. a further application of MS-based viral sequence variation analysis in tracking the virus strain was demonstrated by our confirmation of the Singapore origin of a SARS-CoV isolate from a german patient. viral genetic characterization in cultured viral isolates may not capture the whole sequence variation spectrum of a virus in a patient population. this raises a concern that viral genetic characterization in cultured viral isolates may not capture the whole sequence variation spectrum of a virus in a patient population. multiplexing analysis of MS-based assays greatly reduces the cost of analysis to about US$0.10\u2013$0.20 per analysis. MS-based sequence variation analysis is a sensitive, accurate, cost-effective, and high-throughput method for confirming putative variations and characterizing known variations in clinical samples. direct sequence analysis is still the \u201cgold standard\u201d for identifying new sequence variations. the x-axis denotes the cycle number of the quantitative PCR assay. the y-axis denotes fluorescence intensity (F2) over the background level. the virus loads determined in the five spiked human blood samples were as follows. mass spectrometry is a molecular biology technique called mass spectrometry. they found that mass spectrometry is a useful tool for detecting the SARS virus and for distinguishing between different strains. they also found that they could use this tool to help understand how the virus had been transmitted between specific patients. RNA standards were as follows: 1.05 106 copies per reaction (line a), 1.01 105 copies per reaction (line b), 9.4 103 copies per reaction (line c), 8.9 102 copies per reaction (line d), and 1.07 102 copies per reaction (line e). the virus loads determined in the five spiked human blood samples were as follows: SB1, 1.64 106 copies per reaction. mass spectrometry is a molecular biology technique called mass spectrometry. they took samples from patients (such as blood samples and nasal swabs) they found that mass spectrometry is a useful tool for detecting the SARS virus and distinguishing between different strains. this means that detailed DNA sequencing is necessary to find these differences in the first place. mass spectrometry used a molecular biology technique called mass spectrometry. they found that different strains could be distinguished from each other on the basis of specific genetic \u201cfingerprints\u201d. they found that mass spectrometry is a useful tool for detecting the SARS virus and distinguishing between different strains. molecular biology can help to identify the cause of a disease (such as a virus, bacterium, or parasite) and understand how it spreads. they had previously used molecular biology techniques to study different strains of the SARS virus. they found that different strains could be distinguished from each other on the basis of specific genetic \u201cfingerprints\u201d. researchers used molecular biology techniques to study different strains of the SARS virus, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. they found that different strains could be distinguished from each other on the basis of specific genetic \u201cfingerprints\u201d. mass spectrometry is a useful tool for detecting the virus and distinguishing between different strains. .sciencemag.org/feature/data/sars/ News article on the SARS genome on the Genome Network News Web site."}
