{"summary": "we applied a precision public health strategy to syndromic surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Uganda by combining spatiotemporal analytics with genomic sequencing. we identified patients with unexplained, influenza-negative SARI from 2010 to 2015. SARI was defined as a syndrome of acute onset of difficulty breathing or cough within 10 days of symptom onset and disease severity sufficient to lead to hospitalization. for patients aged 2 months, SARI was defined as a syndrome of fever (measured or subjective) plus cough or shortness of breath within 10 days of symptom onset. VirCapSeq-VERT positively selects and enriches viral sequences for high-throughput sequencing via probe hybridization [16]. VirCapSeq-VERT positively selects and enriches viral sequences for high-throughput sequencing via probe hybridization [16]. VirCapSeq-VERT compared expected versus observed case counts inside and outside scan windows. BLASTX against the viral GenBank protein database. based on the identified contigs, GenBank sequences were downloaded and used for mapping the whole data set to recover partial or complete genomes. al swab samples were collected from each patient and shipped to UVRI using an established protocol [12] for all SARI cases, testing was initially done for influenza A and B viruses using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. only patients with SARI of unexplained etiology (ie, influenza A and B negative by RT-PCR) were included. VirCapSeq-VERT positively selects and enriches viral sequences for high-throughput sequencing via probe hybridization. sequencing libraries were prepared by including the viral sequence capture step within the standard KAPA protocol. genomes of all 207 known vertebrate viral taxa were identified and tested. Detection and Characterization of SARI Clusters Among 2901 influenza-negative SARI cases, 2901 had spatial and temporal data available for analysis. the median size, radius, and duration of these clusters was 30 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 21\u201344 cases), 13 kilometers (IQR 9.5\u201316.7), and 38 days (IQR 23\u201358 days), respectively. the largest clusters occurred in Wakiso, central Uganda from March to May 2012. 48 (15.9) 197 (7.6)m Cough 249 (82.7) 2449 (94.2)m Sore throat 10 (3.3) 77 (3.0) SOB 173 (57.5) 1773 (68.2)m Diarrheae 78 (29.4) 744 (29.4) Vomitingc 35 (12.9) 407 (17.4) Headache 45 (15.0) 442 (17.0) Confusiong 10 (3.7) 107 (4.6) Convulsionsf 17 (7.2) SARI Clusters and Respiratory Viruses Identified in Uganda, October 2010\u2013June 2015 Cluster Event 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 District Koboko Kampala Wakiso Tororo Kabarole Kabarole Kabarole Arua Mbarara Koboko Time period (days) 11/2010\u20131/2011 (38) 4/2015\u20135/2015 (59) 3/2012\u20135/2012 (59) 7/2013\u20138/2013 (24) 6 CMV (12) HRV-A (9) HPIV-2,3 (3) CoV-OC43 (2) RSV-B (2) HPyV (2) ADV-C (1) EV-D68 (1) HBoV (1) HHV-6 (2) No virus detected (5) RSV-A,B (8) ADV-B,C (2) CMV (3) CV-A4 (1) EV-D68 (1) CoV-OC43 (1) HRV-B,C (3) No virus detected (6) Measles (18) CoV- aSamples unavailable for 1 case, failed sequencing in 1 case. cSamples unavailable in 3 cases, failed sequencing in 17 cases. dSamples unavailable for 35 cases. nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab samples from 199 (66.1%) cases were available to undergo analysis with VirCapSeq-VERT. high-throughput sequencing was performed on samples from 176 patients. human rhinoviruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), measles virus, and human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) were the most commonly detected measles was the sole virus detected in 11 cases (61.1%) there were 3 cases coinfected with CMV, 2 with HPIV, and 1 each with RSV-A and rubella virus. sequences from 13 cases were consistent with genotype B3, the genotype endemic in East Africa in 2009. sequencing reads from both cases revealed infection with PBV most closely related to PBV previously identified in swine and dromedary camels. sequences were 88.7% homologous; on an amino acid level they were 98.6% identical. signs and symptoms Measured temp. >38\u00b0C 48 (15.9) 197 (7.6)m Cough 249 (82.7) 2449 (94.2)m Sore throat 10 (3.3) 77 (3.0) SOB 173 (57.5) 1773 (68.2)m Diarrheae 78 (29.4) 744 (29.4) Vomitingc 35 (12.9) 407 (17.4) Headache 45 (15.0) 442 (17.0) Confusiong 10 (3.7) 107 ( fData missing from 109 cases. gData missing from 292 cases. iData missing from 290 cases. jData missing from 109 cases. kHIV infection status obtained based on patient self-report only. lData missing from 134 cases.

VirCapSeq-VERT should be a powerful molecular tool for global virologic surveillance moving forward. scalability to national reference laboratories in low-income settings is also realistic. measles remains an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of severe respiratory infections in under-immunized settings such as Uganda. our findings suggest that genotype D4 measles virus circulating in Uganda was likely imported from England, where suboptimal rates of immunization have resulted in recurrent measles outbreaks. two thirds of clusters originated during rainy season months. districts located within these clusters had higher annual rainfall. cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected in over 25% of virus-positive samples. this is consistent with data reported from Zambia. further work is needed to identify alternative spatiotemporal surveillance strategies that may provide greater pathogen specificity. the study demonstrates that precision surveillance strategies can enhance detection and characterization of previously unrecognized, epidemic-prone viral pathogens."}
