{"summary": "study recruited 101 cases of S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls. risk factors identified for S. suis infection as compared to either control group included eating \u2018high risk\u2019 dishes popular in parts of Asia. the importance of zoonotic emerging infections is increasingly recognized. it is illustrated by outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and the ongoing threat of human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus. it is essential to understand transmission dynamics and risk factors for infection. patients may be infected through minor cuts or abrasions on their skin. but occupational exposure to pigs or pork was documented in 88% of the European patients described. it was reported in less than 50% of Asian cases [4], [7], suggesting the contribution of other behavioural or exposure related risk factors in Asian populations. three community controls, matched for age, were randomly identified from a list of eligible households available at the health center in the community of residence of the case. written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls or their care takers. at least 15 year-old Recent history of bacterial meningitis (1 year before admission) the questionnaire was developed in Vietnamese and validated at HTD. it consisted of four parts; socio-demographic and cultural factors. the majority of the questions were \u201cclosed questions\u201d but \u201copen questions\u201d which allowed participants to explain in their own words. a person with 1 PCR positive swab sample Collection of swabs for detection of S. suis serotype 2 carriage. household members were also studied for carriage of S. suis serotype 2. if carriage and associated transmission were to occur, household members of carriers are most likely to become positive. swab samples were inoculated into selective Todd-Hewitt broth. positive samples were cultured to retrieve S. suis isolates. real-time PCR for detection of S. suis serotype 2 was also used. 2.1 assuming a probability of exposure in controls of 0.25 and a correlation coefficient for exposure between matched cases and controls of at least 0.2. with 100 cases, we expected to fit reliable multivariate models with up to 10 covariates without over fitting the data [11]. the study was conducted at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD), a tertiary referral hospital of infectious diseases in the south of Viet Nam, between May 2006 and June 2009. the recruitment of cases and hospital control groups took place at the dedicated central nervous system (CNS) infectious disease ward. patients living in the same commune as case for at least 4 weeks until inclusion of case Age matched with case (10 years range) if patient completely regained consciousness during treatment with antimicrobial agents for a duration of 48 hours or less. injuries defined as lesions with signs of disruption of skin integrity. alcoholism, diabetes mellitus and splenectomy. household members were also studied for carriage of S. suis serotype 2. samples were taken from all pigs present (except pregnant sows to avoid stress-induced miscarriage) within 4 weeks of admission of the patient, or at the second visit to the community controls. culture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid was performed using standard culture methods. 59/226 (26%) of the non-S. suis patients had potential occupational exposure to pigs compared to 46/78 (59%) of the non-S. suis meningitis patients [3], corresponding to an odds ratio of 4. we decided on a target sample size of 100 cases (and 300 matched controls), corresponding to a recruitment period of approximately 4 years. all analyses were performed with Stata version 10.1 (StataCorp) software. 722 patients with suspected CNS infections or severe malaria were admitted to HTD. the 49 hospital controls with bacterial meningitis were significantly younger than S. suis cases with median (IQR) age of 27 (23\u201345) compared to 50 (41\u201359) years (p0.001). the 49 hospital controls with bacterial meningitis (not S. suis) were significantly younger than S. suis cases with median (IQR) age of 27 (23\u201345) compared to 50 (41\u201359) years (p0.001). 3.7) 243 (81) Urban 19 (18.8) 110 (36.3) 57 (19) Age (years), median (interquartile range) 50 (41,59) 27 (20,40) 50 (41,6) Occupations related to pigs (1), n(%) 21 (20.79) 8 (2.64) 8 (2.7) Education level, n(%) Primary 52 (51.5) 96 (31.7) 175 (58.3) Secondary \u201clevel 2\u201d 30 (29.7) 134 (44.2 the last 2 weeks 48 (47.5) 66 (21.8) 48 (16.4) Fresh pig blood 5 (5) 5 (1.7) 5 (1.7) Tonsils/tongue 19 (18.8) 29 (9.6) 25 (8.3) Stomach/intestines 45 (44.6) 53 (17.5) 42 (14) Uterus 8 (7.9) 8 (2.6) 13 (4.3) Undercooked pig blood 11 (10.9) 18 (5.9) 5 (1.7) Ill pigs at home in the last 4 weeks breeding pigs at home, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism or exposure to pigs or pork without skin injuries were not associated with S. suis infection in multivariate analysis. the association was independently associated with occupations related to pigs, exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries. 0.001 11.01(4.03\u201330.12) 0.001 Medical history Diabetes mellitus 3.06(0.61\u201315.41) 0.175 0.82(0.13\u20135.23) 0.830 2.25(0.50\u201310.05) 0.288 3.75(0.75\u201318.73) 0.107 Alcoholism 2.55(1.22\u20135.33) 0.013 1.31(0.54\u20133.16) 0.547 2.50(1.15\u20135.45) 0.021 1.48(0.63\u2013 Ill pigs at home in the last 4 weeks (4) 24.62(2.85\u2013212.24) 0.004 30.10(2.72\u2013333.64) 0.006 - - - Pigs at home with S. suis serotype 2 (confirmed by PCR) pork in the last 2 weeks with skin injuries 7.48 (1.97\u201328.44) 0.003 15.96 (2.97\u201385.72) 0.001 Without skin injuries 2.15 (0.88\u20135.24) 0.092 1.14 (0.49\u20132.69) 0.757 Eating any \u201chigh risk\u201d dish in the presence of skin injuries, eating \u201chigh risk\u201d dishes predominantly consisted of undercooked food. one patient, who had eaten pig intestines two days before admission, had two PCR positive rectal swab samples on separate occasions. s. suis serotype 2 was cultured from the first sample.
