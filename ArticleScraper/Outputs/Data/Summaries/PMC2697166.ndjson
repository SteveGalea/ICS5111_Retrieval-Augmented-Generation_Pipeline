{"summary": "Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central Taiwan. the five most prevalent emm types were emm12 (50.4%), emm4 (23.2%), emm1 (16.4%), emm6 (3.8%) and emm22 (3.0%). the large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. the fluctuation in scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the SARS outbreak in 2003. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) is a common pathogen responsible for a number of human suppurative infections, including pharyngitis, impetigo, pyoderma, erysipelas, cellulitis, vir typing has been abandoned in our lab because it has lower discriminatory power than PFGE. a second enzyme, SgrAI, has been found to replace SmaI for analysis of strains with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion. emm sequencing provides unambiguous sequence information regarding emm type. the number of scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan fluctuated greatly between 2000 and 2006. the total, adjusted number of confirmed scarlet fever cases increased from 716 cases in 2000 to 1,258 in 2002, but dramatically dropped to 771 in 2003. this number increased again in 2004 and, in 2005, reached the high levels seen in 2002. the number of cases increased again in 2004 and, in 2006, reached the levels seen in 2002. the weekly reported number of scarlet fever cases in 2002 was mostly higher than the weekly average from 2000 to 2006. in 2003, except in the 11th week, the number of weekly reported cases in the first 16 weeks was greater than the average. after the 16th week, the number of cases between the 4th and 9th weeks was even higher than that in 2002. stage I occurred from late-February to mid-April (9th \u2013 16th week), with scattered sporadic cases. stage II occurred between mid-April and mid-June (17th \u2013 24th week), with severe nosocomial infections in several hospitals. dramatic decline of scarlet fever notifications in 2003 occurred during the stage II period of the SARS epidemic. 1,218 S. pyogenes isolates were analyzed by PFGE with SmaI. genetic relatedness of the bacterial strains was evaluated. a dendrogram was constructed using the Unweighted Pair Group Method. it revealed that all of the emm4 and emm6 isolates, as well as the majority of emm1 and emm22 isolates, were each distributed in a unique cluster. however, the emm12 isolates were located in two distinct clusters and two singletons. 94 emm:PFGE-SmaI genotypes were identified in the 1,218 isolates. emm1:SPYS16.0022 (14.9%), emm4:SPYS16.0006 (11.7%), emm4:SPYS16.0008 (8.1%), emm4:SPYS16.0083 (2.6%), emm6:SPYS16.0020 (2.7%), emm12:SPYS16.0013 the emm12* clone represents the emm12 strains with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion. the emm12* and emm12 clones were the most prevalent in 2000. the two clones declined over time and were at their lowest levels in 2003. the total number of scarlet fever cases in 2002 was doubled that in 2000. the number of cases in 2003 was considerably lower than that in 2002. this increase is associated with a dramatic rise in the prevalence of the emm12 clones. the number of cases in central Taiwan accounted for 18% to 24% of cases in 2002. the total average throughout 2000\u20132006 is indicated by a red dashed line. the two stages of the SARS epidemic in 2003 are marked by blue (stage I) and red (stage II) bars. scarlet fever was more prevalent in the winter and spring seasons (2nd \u2013 25th weeks) in 2000\u20132006. however, there was a remarkable decrease in the number of cases in the 6th and 7th weeks. the weekly reported number of scarlet fever cases in 2002 was mostly higher than the weekly average from 2000 to 2006. the five most prevalent emm types, accounting for 96.8% of the collection, were emm12 (50.4%), emm4 (23.2%), emm1 (16.4%), emm6 (3.8%) and emm22 (3.0%) emm12 was the predominant type found between 2000\u20132001, accounting for 87.1% and 57.1% of the total isolates in 2000 and 2001. it became the predominant type again in 2005 and 2006, accounting for 69. 139 154 273 122 115 174 241 1218 *18 emm types: emm2 (5 isolates), emm11 (11), emm28 (1), emm49 (5), emm58 (1), emm76 (1), emm77 (1), emm81 (1), emm82 (1), emm89 (3), emm92 (1), emm102 (1), emm102 (1), emm102 (1), s two strains with different emm types (emm101 and st5282) had indistinguishable PFGE-SmaI patterns. a strain with a stIL103 type was located within the emm1 cluster. stIL103 is an allele of emm1 that lacks the codons encoding the mature M1 7\u201324 residues. emm4:SPYS16.0008 (8.1%), emm4:SPYS16.0083 (2.6%), emm6:SPYS16.0020 (2.7%), emm12:SPYS16.0026 (10.3%) and emm12:SPYS16.0087 (2.3%) made up 82.2% of the 1,218 isolates. most emm:PFGE genotypes lasted for only 1\u20132 years. six major emm (emm1, emm4, emm6, emm12, emm12* and emm22) clones were identified. the emm12* clone represents the emm12 strains with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion. the adjusted number of confirmed cases of scarlet fever in central Taiwan ranged from 142 to 282 between 2000 and 2006. cases of scarlet fever in central Taiwan from 2000 to 2006 were caused by S. pyogenes strains with a limited number of emm types. five prevalent emm types represented 96.8% of the isolates causing scarlet fever during this time period. of the 23 emm types isolated, 17 made up 99.4% of the isolates. the most common emm types in 427 isolates collected in the same time period in central Taiwan were emm12 (35.6%), emm1 (34.2%), emm4 (18.5%), emm6 (7.5%) and emm22 (1.9%). the geographic variation in the prevalence of emm types may explain why the epidemiological trend of scarlet fever in 2006 in central Taiwan was different from that in the whole country. the emm12*, emm1 and emm6 clones both increased and decreased within one year. the emm12 and emm4 clones persisted throughout the seven year period. this phenomenon may be due to the fact that the emm12 and emm4 clones produced less M protein and were less virulent. the emm12:SPYS16.0026 strain was detected for the first time in 1999. of the 127 SPYS16.0026 isolates, 125 belonged to the emm12 type. the first isolate resistant to SmaI digestion was identified in central Taiwan in 1998. the dramatic drop in reported cases in 2003 is difficult to explain. the occurrences of scarlet fever in central Taiwan between 2000 and 2006 were often lower than the overall average until the first half of 2004. scarlet fever was a notifiable disease in Taiwan until 2007. hospitals and clinics were obligated to report confirmed or suspected cases to the county public health department via a web-based Notifiable Diseases Reporting System. the number of annual confirmed cases detected through the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System was adjusted by multiplying the number of reported cases. PFGE analysis S. pyogenes isolates were subjected to PFGE analysis using a previously described protocol [7] all of the isolates were analyzed by SmaI digestion. Isolates with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion were analyzed with SgrAI. ed cases were those in which S. pyogenes was isolated from the specimens. the number of annual confirmed cases detected through the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System was adjusted by multiplying the number of reported cases and the rate of positive specimens. a unique PFGE pattern was defined if it contained one or more DNA bands different from the others. the genetic relatedness among isolates is presented in a dendrogram built by clustering the PFGE patterns."}
