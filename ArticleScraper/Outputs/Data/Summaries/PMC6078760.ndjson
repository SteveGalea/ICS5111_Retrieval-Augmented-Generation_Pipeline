{"summary": "ARTI is the most common cause of outpatient visit and hospital admission for children. the severity of the ARTI depends on the site of infection, the type of viruses, involved organs and comorbidities. viral pneumonia can be life threatening due to uncontrolled systematic inflammatory response, leading to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. the results of all nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples sent for the test for respiratory viruses were extracted from electronic healthcare records. samples with missing information on test results were excluded. spring was defined as the period from 2016 May 2, 2016 to May 5, 2016 and from February 3, 2017 to April 9, 2017. summer was defined from the period from May 5, 2016 to August 7, 2016. winter was from November 7, 2016 to February 3, 2017. samples from ER were more likely to be due to acute respiratory tract infection. samples were obtained using the throat swab, which was immediately prepared for analysis. if a sample cannot be analyzed immediately, it could be stored in 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for at most 8 hours. influenza A and B were detected using diagnostic kit (colloidal gold method, KaiBiLi) categorical variables were expressed as the number and proportion, and were compared by using t test. multivariable logistic regression model was built upon complete case analysis that observations with missing values on covariates were excluded. the positive rate of influenza B was highest in April (n = 1187) and lowest in August (n = 0, Fig. 2). the absolute number of positive samples for influenza B was highest in March (n = 1548) and lowest in November (n = 22, Fig. 3). the positive rate for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was highest in December (28.5%), lowest in June (2.9%) and July (4.3%). the absolute number of positive samples for RSV was highest in December (n = 1825) and lowest in may (n = 28). samples from boys were more likely to have positive result for adenovirus. in multivariable logistic regression analysis, age was independently associated with positive result for adenovirus. with 1 year increase in age, odds of positive result increased by 2%. male gender was associated with higher risk of positive for adenovirus. with 1 year increase in age, odds of positive result increased by 25%. male gender was not associated with risk of positive results. samples obtained in the emergency department were less likely to have positive results. study showed that among samples tested for respiratory virus, RSV had the highest positive rate (13.0%), followed by influenza B (9.9%), adenovirus (8.9%), and influenza A (8.0%). the positive rates for the 4 respiratory viruses changed in distinct seasonal patterns. the difference might be attributable to different methodological designs for the 2 studies. our study was based on swab or sputum samples. sputum showed higher positive rate for the detection of respiratory virus than sputum. Saraya et al[24] showed that influenza viruses were more frequently detected in spring and winter, and RSV was more common in autumn. their study was conducted in adult patients with asthma, which might be responsible for the difference. the study reported epidemiological data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in a large tertiary care children's hospital. the positive rates of the 4 respiratory viruses showed distinct seasonal patterns. such a seasonal pattern may help develop a specific vaccination program."}
