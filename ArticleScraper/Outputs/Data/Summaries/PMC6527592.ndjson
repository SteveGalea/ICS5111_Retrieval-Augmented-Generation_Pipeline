{"summary": "the ostrich (Struthio camelus var. domesticus) is the largest living, flightless bird species belonging to the ratite group (1). the majority of ostriches destined for slaughter are reared in free-range systems. mycoplasma is highly infectious in these intensive rearing systems. the development of whole organism vaccines for use in ostriches is limited by the slow-growing nature of these organisms and the cost of medium required to sustain growth. DNA vaccines, on the other hand, can be produced at relatively low cost and are more temperature stable than other vaccines (13, 14). a DNA vaccine is a plasmid expression vector containing a gene that codes for a protein antigen. the extracellular components of these transporters are ideal targets for vaccine development. the extracellular components of these transporters are ideal targets for vaccine development. pCI-neo (Promega) and VR1020 (Vical Inc.) were chosen as vaccine vectors. the mutated oppA gene was sub-cloned into each vector using restriction digestion. the isolated plasmids were diluted to 100, 600, and 1,200 g/ml with sterile PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2) the isolated plasmids were diluted to 100, 600, and 1,200 g/ml with sterile PBS. three-month-old chicks were randomly selected from a chick rearing unit in the Fraserburg district (Northern Cape Province, South Africa) trial ostriches were transported back to a commercial ostrich farm in the Oudtshoorn district (Western Cape Province, South Africa) the chicks were quarantined for 28 days after relocation and random testing was performed for avian influenza. the pCI-neo_oppA and VR1020_oppA vaccine groups were randomly allocated to seven treatment groups of 20 ostriches each. the last group was the control group that did not receive any vaccine. the dose typically administered to poultry ranges from 0.25 to 800 g when injected intramuscularly. pGEX-4T-1_oppA plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. expression of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) OppA fusion protein was induced at an OD600 between 0.4 and 0.6 by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG. cells harvested at 0 and 6 h by centrifugation (10,000 g at 4\u00b0C) a sample (8 ml) was prepared for loading of the column by treating the resuspended pellets with three freeze-thawing cycles (20 min at 37\u00b0C followed by 10 min at 80\u00b0C) the samples were then triturated three times through a 25Gx5/8\u2032\u2032 needle (Avacare) into a 1 ml Injekt-F syringe (BBraun) Ig polyclonal antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:100 in casein-Tween. a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate mixture was added at a dilution of 1:100. the plate incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. non-specific binding of anti-OppA antibodies during ELISA analysis was evaluated by coating the wells with carbonate buffer (100 l/well) containing no capture antigen and serum from a vaccinated bird that gave a high absorbance value at a dilution of 1:100. the weight of trial birds was monitored and recorded at weeks 0, 6, and 9. d Mutagenesis of the oppA gene cultures of \"M. nasistruthionis sp. nov\" was obtained from Mr J.J. Gouws (Faculty of Veterinary Science, Onderstepoort, University of Pretoria) gDNA was isolated from these cultures using a method described by Hempstead (29) the mutated oppA gene was sub-cloned into each vector using restriction digestion. for pCI-neo, AccI and MluI, and for VR1020, BamHI (Fermentas) restriction enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. ilutions were prepared under aseptic conditions, in sterile serum glass bottles, closed with inert silicone stoppers and sealed with a tear away center aluminum cap. site-directed mutagenesis of the oppA gene cultures of \u201cM. nasistruthionis sp. nov\u201d was obtained from Mr J.J. Gouws (Faculty of Veterinary Science, Onderstepoort, University of Pretoria) the mutated oppA gene was sub-cloned into each vector using restriction digestion. for pCI-neo, AccI and MluI, and for VR1020, BamHI (Fermentas) restriction enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. ostrich chicks of 3-months-old were randomly selected from a chick rearing unit in the Fraserburg district (Northern Cape Province, South Africa) the chicks were quarantined for 28 days after relocation and random testing was performed for avian influenza. each ostrich was tagged with other populations on any farm to which they have been transported. trial was conducted under similar conditions to which a commercial vaccine would be administered. trial ostriches were kept in open air camps (1,250 m2) with 120\u2013150 chicks per camp. trial birds were not kept separately but grouped with other ostriches of the same weight and age. blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein using 18Gx1/2\u2032\u2032needles (Vacuette\u00ae) and collected in Vacuette\u00ae Z serum sep clot activator tubes at week 0, 3, 6 and 9. the ostriches were moved from Fraserburg to Oudtshoorn 12 days prior to the week 6 sampling. the chicks were quarantined for 28 days after relocation and random testing was performed for avian influenza. each ostrich was tagged with a unique number for identification under the right wing. trial ostriches were housed and treated in the same manner as non-trial ostriches on the farms. ostriches were moved from Fraserburg to Oudtshoorn 12 days prior to the week 6 sampling. no adjuvant was used to limit possible skin reactions. an overnight culture (from a freezer stock) and expression cultures were prepared using Terrific-Broth (TB) medium. expression of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) OppA protein was induced at an OD600 between 0.4 and 0.6 by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG. cells harvested at 0 and 6 h by centrifugation (10,000 g at 4\u00b0C) expression and isolation products were analyzed using a modified Bradford assay. expression and isolation products were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. absorbance measured at 405 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan EX plate reader after 30 min incubation at 37\u00b0C. content of the plate was first decanted followed by washing five times with PBS-Tween. a first-row column blank (containing all components except ostrich serum) was used on each plate to blank absorbance values. recombinant OppA protein was produced for use as coating antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to this end, the SDM corrected oppA gene was PCR amplified and sub-cloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector using restriction digestion. an overnight culture (from a freezer stock) and expression cultures were prepared using Terrific-Broth (TB) medium. ml was prepared for loading of the column by treating the resuspended pellets with three freeze-thawing cycles (20 min at 37\u00b0C followed by 10 min at 80\u00b0C) the samples were then triturated three times through a 25Gx5/8\u2032\u2032 needle (Avacare) into a 1 ml Injekt-F syringe (BBraun) a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate mixture was diluted 1:100 with casein-Tween. the plate incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the content of the plate was first decanted followed by washing five times. non-specific binding of anti-OppA antibodies during ELISA analysis was evaluated by coating the wells with carbonate buffer (100 l/well) containing no capture antigen and serum from a vaccinated bird that gave a high absorbance value at a dilution of 1:100. trachea swabs were collected at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9 and tested for the presence of mycoplasma infections. 67 bp oppA gene was successfully amplified from the Ms03 gDNA. all 16 mycoplasma TGA codons in this plasmid were successfully mutated to universal TGG codons. mutated oppA gene was successfully sub-cloned into the pGEM\u00ae-T Easy vector as confirmed by sequencing. SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses confirmed that the recombinant OppA protein was expressed successfully as an N-terminal GST-fusion protein with the predicted size of 170 kDa. Bradford analysis indicated that the OppA protein was eluted between fraction 7 and 12 with the highest concentration obtained in the 9th fraction. 600 g doses resulted in average ELISA titers that differed significantly from the control. this was also only at week 9 after a booster vaccination was administered. the average titers of the different doses were, however, not significantly different from one another. 45.4 VR1020_oppA 100 g 19 27.5 47.9 47.2 600 g 18 26.2 42.7 41.1 1,200 g 19 26.0 44.5 42.9 Control \u2013 17 27.2 44.2 43.8 * At the start of the trial there was 20 ostriches in each group. during the trial some of the ostriches lost their tags and were excluded from the analysis. the highest percentage of infections at week 9 was due to Ms02 (10.5%), followed by Ms03 (5.2%) and Ms01 (3.5%). the only group that had no PCR-detectable mycoplasma infections was the group that had received 1,200 g of the VR1020_oppA vaccine. large scale production of the isolated plasmids was achieved. approximately 89 mg of plasmid was isolated for each of pCI-neo_oppA and VR1020_oppA. integrity of the isolated plasmids was confirmed with agarose electrophoresis. electrophoresis and most of the pDNA was in the required supercoiled conformation. a supercoiled conformation has a higher transfection rate into mammalian cells. a supercoiled conformation has a higher transfection rate into mammalian cells. the titer values of the control group, which received no vaccine, did not show significant variation over time. however, there was a slight increase in the average titer at week 9. the average titers of the different doses were, however, not significantly different from one another. expression and Purification of the recombinant OppA protein Sub-cloning of the mutated oppA gene into the pGEX-4T-1 vector was successful as confirmed by sequencing. SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses confirmed that the recombinant OppA protein was expressed successfully as an N-terminal GST-fusion protein. pCI-neo_oppA vaccine resulted in significant treatment x time interactions (P = 0.0462) but only the 100 and 600 g doses resulted in average ELISA titers that differed significantly from the control. the average titers of different doses were, however, not significantly different from one another. no weight recorded 43.2 44.9 600 g 17 26.0 42.7 43.7 1,200 g 19 26.8 45.8 45.4 VR1020_oppA 100 g 19 27.5 47.9 47.2 600 g 18 26.2 42.7 41.1 1,200 g 19 26.0 44.5 42.9 Control \u2013 17 27.2 44.2 43.8 * At the start of the trial there was 20 ostriches in each group, during the trial some of the ostriches lost their tags and the group that received the VR1020_oppA vaccine had fewer mycoplasma infections. compared to this, the groups that received the pCI-neo_oppA vaccine had fewer mycoplasma infections. for both vaccine groups, some of the birds were infected by more than one of these Mycoplasma species. the VR1020_oppA vaccine, on average, elicited higher titer values compared to the pCI-neo_oppA vaccine. a general trend of increases in the average titer values was observed from week 0 to 3 for groups that received the VR1020_oppA vaccines. vaccination trial, the health of the ostriches was monitored by recording weight gain. all groups gained weight up to week 6 but toward week 9 their weight gain decreased. the decrease in weight did coincide with the movement of the birds to a new location. the ELISA titer values were already raised at the start of the vaccination trial. this is the first study to show that DNA vaccines are able to elicit an antibody response in ostriches against a mycoplasma antigen. this response was dose dependent and required a booster vaccination. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
