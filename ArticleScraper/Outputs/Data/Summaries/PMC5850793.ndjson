{"summary": "M. domestica, S. bullata, and D. virilis were transferred to a disinfected container with sterile water. flies were left unfed to prevent introducing additional bacteria. ophila virilis were transferred to bacterial lawn plates using an ethanol-disinfected mouth aspirator. the plate was rotated or gently tapped to encourage fly movement. flies that flipped upside down on the bacterial lawns were eliminated from the study due to gross contamination. Bacterial colony-forming units were enumerated to determine the contamination of the flies. the average CFU of unexposed control fly was subtracted from the bacteria enumerated in the treatment groups prior to statistical testing. number of bacteria per gram body weight was determined by dividing the amount of bacteria removed from the fly by the average weight of the fly species. twenty-two flies were aseptically removed from their containers and placed on a 24 h lawn of E. coli. fly and Bacterial Stocks Three fly species were used in this study. flies were left unfed to prevent introducing additional bacteria. flies were kept in bottles of pasteurized fly food. Drosophila virilis were transferred to bacterial lawn plates using an ethanol-disinfected mouth aspirator. flies were allowed to walk on the plate for a period of 5 min. the plate was rotated or gently tapped to encourage fly movement. serial dilutions were prepared to 106 in 0.85% saline. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. average CFU of unexposed control fly was subtracted from bacteria. the sex of the individual flies was determined by dividing the amount of bacteria (CFUs) removed from the fly by the average weight of the fly species. twenty-two flies were aseptically removed from their containers and placed on a 24 h lawn of E. coli. wings, metathoracic legs cleaning body, metathoracic legs rubbing together, and metathoracic legs cleaning mesothoracic legs were counted over 5 min. a Student\u2019s t-test (P 0.05) was used to test for statistical differences in cleaning behavior between exposed and unexposed flies. P. aeruginosa was exposed to E. coli or P. aeruginosa for 5 min. flies were not exposed to bacteria, but placed in tubes for 5 min. 50 flies of each species were weighed and an average fly weight was used to standardize for the number of bacteria per gram weight of fly. the average weight of S. bullata was 0.045g, 0.007 g for M. domestica, and 0.002 g for D. virilis. 1010 2.10 109 Flies were exposed to E. coli or P. aeruginosa for 5 min. they were not allowed to clean or allowed to clean for 5 or 10 min. bacterial numbers per gram weight were calculated by dividing the average bacterial load by the average weight of the fly. metathoracic legs to wings 3.9 0.82 4.5 0.93* Mesothoracic legs to wings 2.9 1.1 9.7 0.85 Mesothoracic legs to body 3.0 0.74 5.6 0.86 Mesothoracic legs together 8.6 1.6 18.4 1.5 Mesothoracic legs to body 8.6 1.6 18.4 1.5 Mesothoracic legs to body 8.6 1.6 18.4 1.5 Mesothoracic legs to body 8.6 1.6 18.4 1.5 Mesothoracic legs Drosophila virilis was able to significantly reduce both the E. coli and P. aeruginosa within 10 min. bacterial reduction was calculated by dividing the average bacterial measure for 5 min or 10 min by the average bacterial measure for no cleaning. flies exposed to E. coli transferred 1.2 106 CFU and to P. aeruginosa 1.1 106 CFU. flies were able to transfer statistically the same amount of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa to the surrounding surface during grooming. S. bullata 3.66 109 2.08 109 8.68 108 1.78 109 5.15 108 2.66 108 D. virilis* 1.68 109 2.00 108 1.89 108 7.57 1010 1.71 1010 2.10 109 Flies exposed to E. coli bacterial lawns for 5 min and then not allowed to clean or allowed to clean for 5 or 10 min. flies showed significantly higher rates of cleaning behavior than control flies. results show that D. virilis and S. bullata are able to remove a significant amount of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa. flies are domestic filth flies that breed in animal manure and human excrement. bacterium may stick more strongly to the pulvillus, which is the sticky substance released by the glandular hairs of filth flies. new studies will be needed to define roles for E. coli ATCC 25922-encoded adhesins, as well as additional adhesins encoded by other pathogenic E. coli strains. flies picked up similar amounts of bacteria when fly size is taken into account. it is not known why it would be higher in one species of fly. there were differences in M. domestica\u2019s ability to remove E. coli as well. flies removed 86% of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa within 10 min of cleaning. ingested bacteria are greatly reduced in the gut of the fly after 3\u20134 d. the length of time from exposure to the bacterial contamination and location of a host may be significant in the transmission of bacterial pathogens. additional studies are necessary to quantify the effects of cleaning on other infectious microorganisms transmitted by flies."}
