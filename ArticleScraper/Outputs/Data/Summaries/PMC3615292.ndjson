{"summary": "dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a membrane-bound serine protease that preferentially cleaves the peptide bond after the penultimate proline residue (1). the substrates of DPP-IV are small oligopeptides, including hormones, chemokines, and neuropeptides (5\u20138) the biological function of IGF-1 is mediated through IGF-1R tyrosine kinase signaling. IGF-1R phosphorylates several downstream adaptor proteins, thus activating distinct downstream signaling pathways. total concentration of IGF-1 in the blood is 10\u201340 nM (23\u201325) anti-IGF1R and anti-phospho-IGF1R (Tyr1135/1136)/insulin receptor (Tyr1150/1151) were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA) anti-insulin R and anti-phospho-insulin receptor (Tyr1150/1151) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). column was washed with 10 and 20 mM imidazole before the sample was eluted with 250 mM imidazole. additional purification was performed with ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. an expression plasmid for insect cells was constructed. the samples were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and/or MALDI\u2013TOF analysis. the initial velocity is given as a function of the enzyme concentration [E] with the following equation. the peak area was quantified with flexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). CI-H661 cells incubated for 1 h before the addition of different concentrations of IGF-1 or T-IGF1. cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, pH7.2) 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h followed by three washes with PBS. a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (100 L) was added to the wells. the plate was incubated for 1 h with 100 L of an anti-IGFBP3 antibody. primers used for quantitative RT\u2013PCR were 5\u2032-taaaggaatgccaggaggaggaa-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-tatagaggggcagaccagga-3\u2032 for DPP-IV. 5\u2032-gaaggtgaaggtcggagtca-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-tggaagatgggatt-3\u2032 for GAPDH. affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography were used to isolate the pure proteases. the protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in a binding buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. the purity of the protein was determined by the Bradford method. the protein was eluted in a 0\u2013500 mM NaCl gradient in buffer A. the reaction was terminated by the addition of 15% acetic acid. the peak area was quantified with flexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) the amount of T-IGF1 was calculated by measuring the peak area and comparing it against the IGF-1 control. the initial velocity was calculated from the amount of T-IGF1 obtained at different time points. 96-well ELISA plate was coated overnight with 100 L of either 50 nM T-IGF1 or 50 nM intact IGF-1. excessive antigen was removed after overnight incubation. quantitative RT\u2013PCR analysis of human lung tissues Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was performed according to published protocols (33). Tumor and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues dissected from the lungs of patients with SCC or adenocarcinoma (ADC) were obtained from Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan, according to the institutional guidelines. HPLC analysis identified the dipeptide Gly\u2013Pro and the octapeptide ETLCGAEL as the products of DPP-IV digestion. the identities of these two cleavage products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). under the same reaction conditions, FAP did not cleave GPETLCGAEL (data not shown). kcat/Km value for the cleavage of IGF-1 by DPP-IV was 360 M\u20131s\u20131, with Km and kcat equal to 14 M and 0.005 s\u20131 respectively. cleavage is more efficient than the cleavage of CXCL11 by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) the activation of IGF-1R was only detected in the CL1-0 and NCI-H661 cells in the presence of 10 nM IGF-1 after stimulation for 30 min. phosphorylation status of IGF-1 was determined by western blot analysis. the concentration of IGF-1 or T-IGF1 is indicated on the top of each lane. for intact IGF-1 at 0.1 nM, IGF-1R phosphorylation reached an optimal level 3 min after stimulation, was sustained for 15 min and decreased after 30 min. the activation of IGF-1R by T-IGF1 is delayed and not sustained. phosphorylation status of IGF-1R was determined by western blot analysis. the binding of IGFBP3 at different concentrations to either T-IGF1 or IGF-1 was measured by ELISA. the values are the means standard errors of three independent experiments. HPLC analysis identified the dipeptide Gly\u2013Pro and the octapeptide ETLCGAEL as the products of DPP-IV digestion. the identities of these two cleavage products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. under the same reaction conditions, FAP did not cleave GPETLCGAEL. kcat/Km value for the cleavage of IGF-1 by DPP-IV was 360 M\u20131s\u20131, with Km and kcat equal to 14 M and 0.005 s\u20131 respectively. cleavage is more efficient than the cleavage of CXCL11 by matrix metalloproteinases or CD23 by ADAM10. the activation of IGF-1R was only detected in the CL1-0 and NCI-H661 cells. CL1-0 cells were selected to study the activation of IGF-1 by intact or truncated IGF-1. the concentration of IGF-1 is indicated on the top of each lane. either IGF-1 or T-IGF1 was added at any concentration tested. phosphorylation status of IGF-1R, IR, ERK, AKT and actin was determined by western blot analysis. IGF-1R phosphorylation caused by both were indistinguishable during the subsequent 3 h. the results suggest that the activation of IGF-1R by T-IGF1 is delayed and not sustained. the binding of IGFBP3 at different concentrations to either T-IGF1 or IGFBP3 was measured by ELISA. the values are the means standard errors of three independent experiments. PP-IV may represent a defense mechanism that mitigates IGF-1 activity in normal cells. the attenuation of IGF-1 signaling may be achieved by both a reduction in IGF-1R activation and increased IGF-1\u2013IGFBP3 binding. reduced IGF-1 expression is linked to a reduction in cancer formation and metastasis. higher levels of intact IGF-1 in the absence of DPP-IV might contribute to the early carcinogenesis of lung SCC. residues that interact with IGFBPs are located at the B (residues 1\u201329) and A domains (residues 42\u201362) of IGF-1 (45). mutations at these residues, such as Glu3, significantly reduce the binding of IGF-1 to IGFBPs (48)."}
