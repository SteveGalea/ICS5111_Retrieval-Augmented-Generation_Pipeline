{"summary": "the family is widely expressed in epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. the family is widely expressed in epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. a CEACAM5 expressing measles virus has entered phase I trials in ovarian cancer. mAbs belonging to the CD66 cluster are described by their reactivity with each family member. at least eight forms of CEACAM1 produced by differential splicing of the single CEACAM1 gene have been identified. the effects of a set of well characterized CD66 mAbs on neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs were studied. the findings suggest a unique role for CEACAM-1 in CEACAM signaling in neutrophils. the source of mAbs was either hybridoma cell culture supernatants, purified antibody, or ascites fluid diluted in PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA as indicated. all sera and ascites were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 15 min before use. in some experiments, the HUVECs were stimulated by culture for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C with 50 ng/ml TNF (Cetus, Emeryville, CA) the wells were then washed four times with calcium free wash buffer (HBSS without Ca2+ plus 4% HIFBS) the wells were then aspirated and washed 4 times with endo wash buffer (HBSS plus 4% HIFBS) Figure 2. Cross desensitization with three CD66 mAbs to further stimulation of neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs. TNF-stimulated HUVECs were washed and Ca2+ free buffer containing IgG (panel A), the CD66ae mAb and CD66b mAb (panel B), the CD66ae mAb and CD66c mAb (panel C), the CD66ae mAb and CD66c m Ca2+ free buffer containing 10 ug/ml final concentration each of IgG (panel A), the CD66ae mAb, CD66b mAb, and CD66de mAb (panel B), or the CD66ae mAb, CD66c mAb, and CD66de mAb (panel E) were added. after 15 sec (solid bars) buffer containing 10 ug/ml final concentration each of the indicated next mAb or buffer the CD45 mAb AHN-12 (IgG1) [57], the CD63 mAb AHN-16.1 (IgG1) [58], and the anti-HLA class I mAb W6/32 (IgG2a) [59] have been previously described. mAbs were obtained from the CD66 section of the sixth international workshop and conference on human leukocyte differentiation antigens. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 96 well microtiter plates in EGM media (Clonetics) and fed every 24 hours. no difference in resting and stimulated neutrophil adhesion was observed. the plates were then washed four times with calcium free wash buffer. the wells were then aspirated and washed 4 times with endo wash buffer. the fluorescence was quantitated using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. each experiment was performed at least four times using different HUVEC subcultures. neutrophils were incubated in the wells for 30 min in the presence of buffer containing Ca2+ with or without 10 ug/ml IgG. the percent of neutrophils adherent to the monolayers are shown. mAbs on neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs were analyzed by the Mann Whitney U test when appropriate. mAbs are highly homologous structurally, and can undergo a number of different homotypic and heterotypic adhesion reactions among themselves. mAbs were used to examine individual CEACAM-mediated signaling. neutrophils were added to the microtiter wells containing the TNF stimulated HUVECs in the absence of Ca2+. aliquots of CD66ae mAb, CD66b mAb, CD66c, CD66de, or CD63 mAbs were added to the wells containing the TNF stimulated HUVECs in the absence of Ca2+. aliquots of buffer, CD66ae mAb, or CD63 mAb were added. neutrophils were added to the wells in the absence of Ca2+. aliquots of buffer, CD66ae mAb, or CD63 mAb were also added. CD66de mAbs selectively desensitized the cells to further stimulation by the CD66b and CD66de mAbs, but not to CD66ae, CD66b, or CD63 mAbs. cross desensitization to combinations of three CD66 mAbs Desensitization with various combinations of three CD66 mAbs was next examined. aliquots of buffer, CD66ae mAb, CD66b mAb, or CD66c mAb were added. the cells were no longer responsive to stimulation by the CD66de mAb. desensitization of neutrophils to stimulation by the CD66ae, CD66b, and CD66de mAbs desensitized the cells to further stimulation by the CD66c mAb. we used calcium-dependent desensitization by CD66 mAbs to examine individual CEACAM-mediated signaling on human neutrophils. each of the CD66ae, CD66b, CD66c, and the control CD63 mAbs augmented neutrophil adhesion approximately two-fold compared with IgG or media. IgG was added to the microtiter wells containing the TNF stimulated HUVECs in the absence of Ca2+. when neutrophils were added to the wells in the absence of Ca2+ and allowed to incubate for 15 sec before Ca2+ was added (solid bars) stimulated neutrophil adhesion was observed when aliquots of CD66ae mAb, CD66b mAb, CD66c, CD66de, or CD63 m neutrophils were added to the wells in the absence of Ca2+. the cells were still responsive to stimulation by CD66c, CD66de, and CD63 mAbs. desensitization to the CD66ae and CD66de mAbs left the cells unresponsive to CD66b and CD66de mAbs. aliquots of buffer, CD66ae mAb, CD66b mAb, CD66de mAb, or CD63 mAbs were added to the wells containing the TNF stimulated HUVECs in the absence of Ca2+. aliquots of buffer, CD66ae mAb, CD66b mAb, CD66de mAb, or CD63 mAb were added. cells were desensitized to CD66de mAb stimulation with a combination of mAbs that does not bind the CD66d antigen. desensitization of neutrophils to stimulation by the CD66ae, CD66b, and CD66de mAbs desensitized the cells to further stimulation by the CD66ae, CD66b, and CD66de mAbs, but not by CD63 mAbs. in the absence of extracellular calcium, this activation state decayed significantly within 1 min, and is no longer functional after 10 min, i.e. the cell is desensitized to stimulation by that mAb [37]. this observation allowed the current study to be performed. mAbs were found to stimulate neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs in this assay. Fab fragments of the CD66ae mAb had little effect on neutrophil adhesion. tyrosine kinase activity may be involved in signal transduction via CEACAM family members. neutrophils have also been reported to be associated with CD63. serine kinase activity has been reported to associate with CD63 in melanoma cells. mAbs to both CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 triggered neutrophil activation. ensitization of CEACAM-1 would leave no active dimers. desensitization of CEACAMs-8, 6, and 3 would leave active homodimers. association of CEACAMs into larger complexes containing more than just two CEACAMs is also possible. ligation of CEACAM-1, -8, -6, and -3 by CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, and CD66d mAbs, respectively, transduce signals in neutrophils resulting in activation of CD11/CD18. CEACAM1 also regulates neutrophil apoptosis, thus possibly influencing the resolution of inflammation. CEACAM1 associates with the beta 3-integrin, and this association is dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr-488 in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1. this complex may play a role in cell invasion. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
