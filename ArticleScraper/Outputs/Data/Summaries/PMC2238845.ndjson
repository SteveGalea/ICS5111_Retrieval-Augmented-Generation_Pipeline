{"summary": "15 million (>25%) of 57 million annual deaths are estimated to be related directly to infectious diseases. the discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has led to renewed appreciation of the consequences of the emergence of infectious diseases. base (8), integrated cancer biomarker information system (9) and database for cancer, asthma and autism for children's study (10). no systematic effort has been described for integrating information from the cancer biomarker and the infectious disease domains. IDBD is an integrated framework for identifying, collecting, distributing and managing of biomarkers. the content in IDBD is open and freely accessible to the general public. the database contains approximately 8\u20139 biomarkers per pathogen (Table 1), comprising proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and small molecules. Biological functions or roles of biomarkers are also included, if available. simple and complex search returns a result list of distinct biomarkers that matches the search criteria (Figure 1D). the listed entries of biomarkers are linked to detailed information (general information, detection, mechanism, etc.) the sequence information in the displayed list can be retrieved in a separate window (Figure 1E) DATA ANALYSIS On the biomarker list page, IDBD allows access to sequence and structure analysis tools by clicking \u2018Data analysis new window\u2019 on the left-hand navigation bar. the user can select sequences of interest obtained from biomarker search (Figure 1E), prepare an input data by clicking \u2018Sequence alignment\u2019, and conduct multiple sequence alignment. the alignment can then be exported for phylogenetic tree construction. the main challenge in the future is to keep IDBD up to date with the growing number of biomarkers experimentally verified and published in peer reviewed journals. the main challenge in the future is to keep IDBD up to date with the growing number of biomarkers experimentally verified and published in peer reviewed journals. IDBD was developed as relational database using Oracle 10g applications (12) on the Windows operating system. two open source softwares, the Apache HTTP Server and Apache Tomcat, were used as HTTP server and servlet container for Web service."}
