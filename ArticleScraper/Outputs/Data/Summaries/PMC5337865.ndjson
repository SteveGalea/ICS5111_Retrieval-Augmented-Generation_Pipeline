{"summary": "IL-10 is a key component of this cytokine system that regulates and suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during the recovery phases of infections. IL-10 binds IL-10R, a dimeric receptor composed of a high affinity IL-10R1 chain predominantly expressed on leukocytes. IL-10 is considered a master negative regulator of inflammation. autoimmune disease models in IL-10-deficient mice have helped elucidate the role of this cytokine in T cell homeostasis in the periphery. they also highlight the complex link between IL-10's source and its role. IL-10 maintains T cell tolerance to commensal microflora in the gut. deficiency in IL-10 signaling in macrophages leads to colitis development. IL-10 produced during the initial inflammation in the gut probably drives IL-10 production by Treg cells. IL-10 deficiency aggravates several experimental autoimmune disorders. IL-10 production in aPC is complex and depends on cell type [37] and the integration of secondary activation signals such as type I IFN [34, 38], PGE2 [39], or CD40 ligation [40] that synergize with PRR signals. early IL-10 production by APCs probably limits excessive inflammation and thus potential tissue damage. cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10 (cmvIL-10) and latency-associated cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10 (LAcmvIL-10) are produced in myeloid cells and impair their function. high IL-10 levels produced by DCs suppress their antigen presenting capacity and lead to inefficient T cell activation. IL-10 acts as a prosurvival factor in activated NK cells by inhibiting activation-induced cell death. NK cells are also a source of IL-10 upon synergistic activation with IL-2 and IL-12. IL-10-producing NK cells can control liver inflammation in acute murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. high IL-10 levels act as a regulatory trigger that initiates the resolution of the acute phase of infection in which antiviral T cell populations contract. IL-10 production in Th1 cells is driven by TCR engagement but is not directly regulated by T-bet. transcription factor BLIMP-1 is essential for IL-10 production in effector and memory CD8+ T cells. IL-10 is induced in effector and memory CD8+ T cells through T cell help. antiviral and inflammatory signals trigger activated T cells to produce IL-10 as a feedback regulatory mechanism that limits excessive inflammation. IL-10 controls inflammation and interrupts T cell responses once pathogens are cleared. IL-10 controls cytokine production and proliferation in antiviral Th1 cells. removal of IL-10 \u201cbrake\u201d on Th responses can lead to immunopathology. IL-10 blockade/deficiency facilitates virus clearance by CD8+ T cells in chronic LCMV infections [2, 31, 104, 107], which confirms that secondary CD8+ T cell responses are regulated by IL-10 [105] IL-10 has also been linked to CD8+ T cell memory differentiation in LCMV infections. nonneutralizing antibodies participate in antiviral immunity as shown in LCMV infections where virus-specific nonneutralizing antibodies participate in virus clearance alongside CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. the importance of B cell responses in viral immunity is also exemplified by the interference of viruses with humoral immunity. a B regulatory cell population (Breg) has been described [129, 130] and can be a principal source of IL-10. no precise Breg cell markers have so far been defined. these cells are potent inhibitors of autoimmune inflammation through their IL-10 production. high IL-10 plasma levels could be protective in early response to HIV. in influenza infections, coproduction of IL-10 and IFN- facilitates anti-influenza antibody accumulation in the lung mucosa. IL-10's supportive role for effective virus clearance is very apparent in CNS infections. IL-10-producing CD4+ Foxp3+ natural Treg cells improve survival in a murine model probably by controlling the immunopathology. in MCMV acute infection, NK cells are the main IL-10 source that modulates immunopathology in liver. IL-10 regulatory mechanisms are therefore essential to control severe inflammatory responses produced by viral infections and can thus, indirectly, be essential for virus clearance. IL-10 production in aPC can be antagonized by the presence of IFN-. in macrophages, IL-10 production can be maintained through an autocrine IFN- feedback loop [36], which suggests that IL-10 balances the proinflammatory signals induced by viral PAMPs. cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10 and latency-associated cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10 are produced in myeloid cells and impair their function. cmvIL-10 induces hIL-10 production in DCs, macrophages, and monocytes, impairs DC differentiation, and promotes M2 polarization of macrophages. IL-10 viral homologs induce human IL-10 (hIL-10) production in myeloid IL-10 produced in the early phase of antiviral innate immunity by APCs and NK cells is probably a counterbalance to proinflammatory signals that protect from tissue damage. cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes are critical in antiviral immunity, since they can kill infected cells through the recognition of viral peptides presented on MHC-II molecules. IL-10 production in Th1 cells is driven by TCR engagement. IL-27 (a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-12 family) is a potent inducer of IL-10 in Th cells. chronic antigen stimulation results in IL-10-producing Th1 cells unable to respond to pathogens. IL-10 is a regulator of the potent APC-derived inflammatory cytokine IL-12 [100] and promotes expression of its own mRNA in a positive feedback loop. IL-10 also restricts the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that permit APC trafficking to the lymph nodes. IL-10 blockade increases the amount of Th1 cells in germinal centers [104], promotes Th1 priming [106], and enhances Th1 effector function and memory development [104, 107] removal of the IL-10 \u201cbrake\u201d on Th responses can lead to immunopathology following viral infection. this general regulatory mechanism prevents host immunopathology and controls the amplitude of Th1 cell responses during acute viral infections. IL-10 produced by Treg cells promotes CD8+ T cell memory differentiation in LCMV infections by insulating a portion of CD8+ T cells from inflammatory signals during the resolution phase of the immune response [112]. IL-10 could impair CD8+ T cell memory development in the same infection [104], while others found no difference in the quality and quantity of CD8+ T cell memory development after IL-10 blockade [107]. IL-10 production in Th cells therefore depends on secondary environmental signals upstream of STATs. chronic antigen stimulation results in IL-10-producing Th1 cells unable to respond to pathogens. transcription factor BLIMP-1 is essential for IL-10 production in effector and memory CD8+ T cells [92] exposure to IL-10 leads to downregulation of costimulatory and MHC molecules on APCs. IL-10 also restricts the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that permit APC trafficking to the lymph nodes. these elevated IL-10 levels impair de novo Th1 stimulation. removal of the IL-10 \u201cbrake\u201d on Th responses can lead to immunopathology. this general regulatory mechanism prevents host immunopathology and controls the amplitude of Th1 cell responses during acute viral infections. this mechanism can be exploited by viruses to promote chronic and persistent infections as discussed later. IL-10 dampening of CD8+ T cell responses could facilitate differentiation of a portion of these cells into memory. this raises the intriguing possibility for a new facet in IL-10 biology whereby IL-10 dampening of CD8+ T cell responses could facilitate differentiation of a portion of these cells into memory. IL-10 expression in B cells can be triggered by TLR engagement [123\u2013125] and increases when B cells are activated in a context mimicking T cell and DC help. a B regulatory cell population (Breg) has been described [129, 130] and can be a principal source of IL-10. no precise Breg cell markers have so far been defined. IL-10-producing Breg cells are elevated in peripheral blood of untreated patients. in chronic hepatitis B virus patients, IL-10-producing B cells are elevated in the periphery and suppress HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vitro. localized effects of IL-10 on T cells suggest that B cell-derived IL-10 would probably affect effector T cell activity in specific settings. IL-10 usually improves virus control, although this outcome probably results from direct and indirect effects of the cytokine. IL-10 produced during the immune response peak could enhance CD8 activity while limiting APC-driven inflammation. IL-10 produced during the immune response peak could enhance CD8 activity while limiting APC-driven inflammation. asis and host tissue protection can be subverted by viruses to allow replication and spreading. IL-10 in chronic viral infections is not cleared by the host immune response. several factors can contribute to this persistence such as viral immune evasion mechanisms. a common characteristic of these persistent infections is elevated IL-10. this has been described for HCV and HIV infections in which high IL-10 levels in the early/acute phase are associated with progression to persistence. increased IL-10 production by DCs has also been reported during HIV, HCV, and foot-and-mouth disease virus infections. IL-10 production is higher in CD8 DCs and those expressing high CCR7 levels, a receptor required for DC migration to T cell areas in secondary lymphoid tissues. IL-10 production in these DCs therefore increases the likelihood for IL-10 exerting its regulatory influence on T cells. self-regulatory Th1 cells can prevent DC maturation and suppress Th1 cell differentiation. this negative feedback mechanism can thus be used by LCMV to suppress Th1 effector function. IL-10-producing NK cells could produce a DC-NK cell cross-talk that impairs adaptive immune response. large DNA viruses encode for protein homologs of cytokines and chemokines or express viral factors that alter host cytokine production. cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10, termed cmvIL-10, and the latency-associated cmvIL-10, termed LAcmvIL-10 [181, 185] are best-characterized IL-10 homologs. cmvIL-10 induces the upregulation of hIL-10 in monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. hIL-10-producing CD4+ T cells are also linked to HCMV and MCMV persistence. hIL-10-producing CD4+ T cells are also linked to HCMV and MCMV persistence. latent infections are mostly asymptomatic, but in some cases EBV induces mononucleosis or B cell and epithelial-cell malignancies. vIL-10 has been shown to bind to and signal through the human IL-10 receptor, similarly to cmvIL-10 [200], although its affinity for the IL-10 receptor is 1000-fold lower than that of hIL-10 [201]. vIL-10 retains the capacity to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production and enhance persistent infections such as those established by hepatitis C virus (HCV), HBV, and HIV are of particular interest in human health due to their high rates of morbidity and mortality. impaired viral clearance can result from viral evasion of the immune response or be assisted by the host-regulated immunosuppression. CD8+ T cells lose their effector functions and are unable to control viral infections, a phenomenon called T cell exhaustion [150] infection of adult mice with Armstrong (Arm) LCMV strain results in acute infections that are efficiently cleared within 7\u201310 days by anti-LCMV CD8+ CTLs. by contrast, the LCMV clone 13 (Cl13) induces a persistent infection that suppresses cellular and humoral responses. IL-10 production is highly increased in serum. NK cells and virus-specific T cells also play a large role in producing IL-10 [72] in the T cell compartment, virus-specific CD4+ T cells become the main IL-10 overproducers. this induction of IL-10 production in CD4+ T cells is probably a homeostatic mechanism that limits Th-induced inflammation. the DC-T cell cross-talk in the presence of high IL-10 levels can thus give rise to IL-10-producing T cells that limit T cell immunity. chronic viral infections often use the regulatory role of IL-10 on T cells and APC to cause T cell exhaustion and contribute to clearance of persistent infections. pesvirus 2 encodes for IL-10 homologs. cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10, termed cmvIL-10, and latency-associated cmvIL-10, termed LAcmvIL-10. HCMV establishes a lifelong latent infection in cells of the myeloid lineage. macrophages show increased phagocytic activity and suppress proinflammatory cytokine production. cmvIL-10 induces the upregulation of hIL-10 in monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells are also linked to HCMV and MCMV persistence. vIL-10 encodes a viral IL-10 (vIL-10) encoded by the BCRF1 gene. vIL-10 has been shown to bind to and signal through the human IL-10 receptor. vIL-10 protects infected B cells by altering cytokine production, inhibiting CD4 and NK cell responses. IL-10 prevents tissue damage in this phase while probably not affecting effector function of antiviral CD8+ T cells. IL-10 does however negatively regulate Th1 responses by downmodulating antigen presenting capacity of APC. chronic antigen exposure in this phase can exhaust antiviral T cells."}
