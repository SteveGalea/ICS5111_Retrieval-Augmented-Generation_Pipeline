{"summary": "strains used for commercially available swine influenza vaccines are not regularly replaced, making the vaccines provide limited protection against antigenically diverse viruses. it is therefore necessary to develop broadly protective swine influenza vaccines that are efficacious to both homologous and heterologous viruses. clinical signs of swine influenza include high fever, lethargy, anorexia, coughing, labored breathing and nasal discharge. pigs express sialic acid receptors for both mammalian and avian strains of influenza viruses on their tracheal epithelial cells. influenza viruses evolve by increasing the mutations in epitopes (antigenic drift) or by reconstituting the genome with other strains (antigenic shift) the increased incidence of avian-like or human-like SIV reassortants has been documented [6-8], resulting in the \u201cantigenic mismatch\u201d between vaccine and circulating strains. the combined utility of the consensus HA and conserved viral proteins will confer complete protection against homosubtypic and, at least partial, heterosubtypic challenge. in this study, two types of swine influenza DNA vaccines were constructed: (1) fusing matrix 2 ectodomain (M2e) to consensus HA of H3 subtype SIV (MHa, means M2e + HA) and (2) fusing M2e and a conserved CTL epitope, NP no significant difference in serum IgG antibody levels were observed between MHa and MNHa group. but the antibody titer of M2e was lower than that of HA (p 0.001) this is not surprising, because M2e contains only 24 amino acids. a synthesized peptide NP147-155 was used for restimulating splenocytes isolated from 3 mice of each group. results were expressed as spot-forming cells (SFC) per million splenocytes. mice were infected intranasally with two homologous strains within H3 subtype 21 days after last immunization. results showed no detectable virus load in all the vaccine-immunized mice. empty vector control group showed high lung viral titers. the immunized mice were challenged with heterologous G11 and rPan09. all the mice that had been vaccinated with MHa had a detectable virus level. pathology damage of mice lung was less pronounced than that of MHa. consensus HA, linked with M2e, was cloned into eukaryotic expression vector with or without NP147-155 to generate two DNA vaccines. both M2e and HA genes expressed in vitro. the two DNA vaccines, as well as empty vector, were coated with gold particles and delivered into the skin with a gene gun. ELISA plates were coated with inactivated SwHLJ1 and synthetic M2e peptides. OD450 at each dilution were determined by indirect ELISA. both of the vaccine immunization groups developed HI antibodies against homologous viruses. splenocytes were harvested from 3 mice 2 weeks after last immunization. results were expressed as spot-forming cells (SFC) per million splenocytes. both MHa and MNHa vaccination conferred complete protection against homologous challenge. saline and expressed as EID50/ml. the limit of virus detection was 1.5log. the limit of virus detection was 1.5log. consensus HA elicits cross-cluster immunity, and CTL response contributes to the control and clearance of infection and reduces pathogenesis. the conventional inactivated human influenza vaccines are updated annually with the world health organization-recommended H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B strains. HA alone may be not enough to induce complete protection against all strains within one subtype, much less heterosubtypic strains. to this end, we linked M2e and NP147-155 to consensus H3 HA to construct a universal swine influenza vaccine. results of present study demontrated that both MHa and MNHa vaccination provided complete protection against these two viruses challenges. but not MHa, induces immune responses partially protect against heterologous influenza infection, suggesting the echanced T-cell mediated response is not required for homologous protection. results also confirm that CTL responses play important roles for heterologous protection. gene gun immunization induces stronger immune response than needle injection method. it is necessary to study whether the HA vaccines will confer protection in pig models. r164, containing SwGD164 surface glycoproteins and PR8 internal proteins, was prepared by using reverse genetics as described [38]. these viruses were propagated in allantoic cavities of 9 to 10-day old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope of NP protein NP147-155 (TYQRTRALV) [41] were optimized for mammalian expression and synthesized by GenScript Corporation (Nanjing, China) the chimeric ORF encoding M2e, CTL epitope and consensus HA was PCR-amplified by introducing 5\u2019 Sma I and 3\u2019 Nhe I restriction sites for ligation into the pCAGGS a secondary Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was then used to detect the primary antibody. a secondary Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was then used to detect the primary antibody. HI assays were performed using 0.5% chicken red blood cells (RBCs) with 4 HA units of homologous (SwHLJ1 and r164) and heterologous (G11 and rPan09) virus and receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE, sigma) treated serum. HI assays were performed using mouse IFN- ELISPOT kits. phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 5 g/ml) and medium alone were used as positive and negative controls. plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with biotinylated anti-mouse IFN- antibody. r164, containing SwGD164 surface glycoproteins and PR8 internal proteins, was prepared by reverse genetics as described [38]. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) test were used to isolate pigs. fetal bovine serum in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. fetal bovine serum in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. all animal studies were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines. in vitro expression of recombinant protein HEK 293 T cells were transfected with 4 g of MHa, MNHa or empty vector. after 48 h, the transfected cells were scraped from the culturing plate, washed with PBS, then spotted onto a glass slide, air dried, and fixed with pre-chilled acetone. left 40 mice of each group were divided as 4 subgroups, each comprised of 10 mice. each group was intranasally challenged with 106 EID50 of two H3N2 and two H1N1 strains, respectively, at 21 days after the final immunization. the reciprocal of highest dilution of serum that gave complete inhibition of hemagglutination was considered the HI titer. a titer of less than 10 was assigned for serum samples that did not inhibit hemagglutination. sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin and 100 IU/ml of penicillin. infection within individual eggs was confirmed using a standard hemagglutination assay. the viral titers were determined by the method of Reed and Muench. authors declare that they have no competing interests. 2010JB02)"}
