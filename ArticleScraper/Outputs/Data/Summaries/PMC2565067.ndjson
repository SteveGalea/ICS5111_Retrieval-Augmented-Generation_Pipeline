{"summary": "intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens. intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells producing IFN- and TNF- produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-. HIV co-infection increased the risk of histological hepatic cirrhosis by two-fold and clinically decompensated liver disease by six-fold. hepatic damage in HCV/HIV co-infection is associated with increased incidence of HAART related liver injury. ex-vivo HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in PBMCs are about one log higher than ex-vivo HCV-specific responses in HCV mono-infection. impairment in cellular immune responses to HCV compared to HIV has been shown in HCV/HIV co-infection [12]. na 6.5(0.15) 1.43(0.37) p.01 CD4 count/l (mean) na 492(34.4) 599(56.9) p>.05 ALT (mean) 65(13)* 70(16) 109(52)* *p.05 Liver Biopsy Inflammation Grade (mean) 1.7(0.16) 1.9(0.25) 1.7(0.15) p>.05 Liver Biopsy Fibrosis Score ( ELISPOT assay used four peptide pools to evaluate hepatic responses. pools spanned HIV-Gag and HCV-NS3, HCV-NS4 and HCV-Core protein. pool that gave strongest ELISPOT response in PBMCs was used for hepatic cell stimulation. data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 8.6 (Treestar Inc., San Carlos, CA) polychromatic FlowJo data were analyzed with PESTLE software. pie-chart graphs were generated using SPICE software.

Flow cytometry Cells were analyzed on a multi-color FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) for blood samples between 500,000 to 1,000,000 total events and for liver biopsy samples between 50,000 to 200,000 total events were collected. additional HIV, HCV and CMV-specific pentamer staining was conducted followed by PD-1 staining. results Subject Characteristics Three groups of individuals were studied as depicted in Table 1. HAART-treated individuals showed significantly higher frequencies of intra-hepatic IFN- producing CD4+ T-cells in response to HCV peptides. however, the percentage of intra-hepatic CD8+ T-cells was higher in both co-infected groups. co-infected individuals had significantly reduced HCV-specific IFN- producing CD4+ T-cells compared to untreated co-infected individuals. antigen-specific cytokine production by intra-hepatic T-cells in HCV mono-infection and HCV/HIV co-infection. co-infected individuals showed significantly higher frequencies of intra-hepatic TNF- producing CD4+ T-cells compared to HAART-treated co-infected individuals. both types of responses were shown to be reduced in the HAART group [HIV-specific: 0.020.01% vs 1.080.21% vs 0.110.06%] marker CD107a, cytokines IFN-, TNF- and IL-2, as well as the chemokine MIP-1 were simultaneously measured in response to HCV or HIV peptide pools. compared to blood, the frequency of HIV-specific T-cells producing CD107a and IL-2 was significantly higher in the liver of therapy-nave, co-infected individuals. all intra-hepatic HCV-specific responses are significantly stronger than peripheral HCV-specific responses. recognition of functional CTL, specific for the HLA-A0201-restricted HIV-SL9 epitope in HCV/HIV co-infected liver. gating scheme on tetramer positive responses is based on initial gating on responses from the tetramer negative population. cells were stained with pools of HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*2402-restricted pentamers (Pro5 MHC class I Pentamers, Proimmune) no CD8+ T-cells specific for CMV were detected in this co-infected liver sample. a representative functional profile of virus specific CD8+ T-cells in blood and liver during HCV/HIV co-infection. analysis of co-infected subjects demonstrates a very limited functional hierarchy of HCV-specific T-cells in the blood. cells expressing all 5 functions were absent in the blood of co-infected subjects, mainly due to lack of IL-2 production. each pie chart generated by SPICE software represents the hierarchy of responses to either HCV or HIV antigen stimulation. color red represents the 5+ responding population and blue, green, turquoise, and yellow representing the 4+, 3+, 2+, and 1+ populations respectively. the software would not allow for arc colors for more than 4 responses. PD-1 gating was based on FMO (fluorescence minus one) of the control sample. the profile of HCV-specific responses in the liver showed the appearance of a very small population of 4+ responding cells in the liver. in an HCV/HIV co-infected liver, we found 100% of intra-hepatic HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells were PD-1 positive, compared to 48.8% of those cells that were HIV-specific. all individuals never received prior treatment for HCV and underwent liver biopsies for staging and evaluation. p0.01 was not associated with any improvement in HAART-treated individuals. however, the percentage of intra-hepatic CD8+ T-cells was higher in both co-infected groups. frquencies of lymphocytes obtained from liver biopsies normalized. HAART-treated co-infected individuals had significantly reduced HCV-specific IFN- producing CD4+ T-cells compared to untreated co-infected individuals. antigen-specific cytokine production by intra-hepatic T-cells in HCV mono-infection and HCV/HIV co-infection. co-infected individuals showed significantly higher frequencies of intra-hepatic TNF- producing CD4+ T-cells compared to HAART-treated co-infected individuals. HAART showed significantly higher frequencies of intra-hepatic TNF- producing CD4+ T-cells. levels of degranulation marker CD107a and cytokines IFN-, TNF- and IL-2, as well as the chemokine MIP-1 were simultaneously measured in response to HCV or HIV peptide pools. compared to blood, the frequency of HIV-specific T-cells producing CD107a and IL-2 was significantly higher in the liver of therapy-nave, co-infected individuals. all intra-hepatic HCV-specific responses are significantly stronger than peripheral HCV-specific responses. recognition of functional CTL, specific for the HLA-A0201-restricted HIV-SL9 epitope in HCV/HIV co-infected liver. tetramer positive responses are based on initial gating on responses from the tetramer negative population. cells were stained with pools of HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*2402-restricted pentamers (Pro5 MHC class I Pentamers, Proimmune), followed by staining for cell surface markers CD3 and CD8. we characterized the ability of CD8+ T-cells to exert these \u2018functions\u2019 in response to both HCV and HIV peptides. analysis of co-infected subjects demonstrates a very limited functional hierarchy of HCV-specific T-cells in the blood. cells expressing all 5 functions were absent in the blood of co-infected subjects. each pie chart generated by SPICE software represents the hierarchy of responses to either HCV or HIV antigen stimulation. color red represents the 5+ responding population and the colors blue, green, turquoise, and yellow representing the 4+, 3+, 2+ and 1+ populations respectively. PD-1 gating was based on FMO (fluorescence minus one) of the control sample. the profile of HCV-specific responses in the liver showed the appearance of a very small population of 4+ responding cells in the liver. in an HCV/HIV co-infected liver, we found that 100% of intra-hepatic HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells were PD-1 positive, compared to 48.8% of those cells that were HIV-specific. this is the first study to demonstrate the presence of HIV-specific T-cells within the liver of co-infected individuals. some individuals infected with influenza-A develop transaminitis. non-hepatotropic viruses such as HIV, CMV and EBV do not induce chronic hepatitis. this could be due to an up-regulation of integrins such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in hepatic sinusoids. therapy nave co-infected individuals showed a higher frequency of intra-hepatic CD8+ T-cells that produce TNF- in response to both HCV and HIV antigen stimulation compared to HCV mono-infected individuals. however, this observation may explain the added contribution of HIV-specific immune responses to the ongoing intra-hepatic damage induced by the virus. PD-1 levels of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells from co-infected liver demonstrates higher expression of PD-1 on HCV-specific T-cells. degranulation marker CD107a dominates the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the liver, with the majority of the responding cells expressing CD107a. despite this defect of CD4+ T-cell help, comparable frequencies of HCV-specific responses were found in co-infected livers. HAART-treated biopsies showed further reduced frequencies of HCV-specific responses. further investigation is needed to clarify role of CD4+ T-cell help in affecting frequencies of HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells in HCV/HIV-1 co-infection."}
