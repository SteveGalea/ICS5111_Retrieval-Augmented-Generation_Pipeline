{"summary": "despite advances in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapy and available prevention methods, HIV infection continues to spread worldwide with about 5,500 new infections every day. there have been tremendous advances over the past years in the standard use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. the high cost of antiviral drugs and the risk of opportunistic infections in individuals with HIV demand the development of new antiviral drugs that could simultaneously target other pathogens. multiple lectins have been shown to neutralize a number of viruses, including HIV, making them attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral drugs. entry inhibitors would constitute important additions to the currently available weapons against the AIDS pandemic [17, 18]. recent approaches have led to the design of active compounds interfering with entry events. meanwhile, maraviroc belongs to a separate class of antiretroviral agents that target a host protein. gp120 and gp41 are heavily glycosylated, and N-linked carbohydrates might make up to 50% of the total molecular weight of gp120. the associated oligosaccharides contain mannose, galactose, N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), L-fucose, and sialic acid. anti-HIV effects are attributed to lectins with specific recognition for mannose and/or GlcNAc. lectins contain multiple sugar-binding sites allowing them to neutralize a broad range of lab-adapted and clinically isolated strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2. lectins have been investigated for their antiretroviral activities. the antiviral activity against HIV occurs after virus-cell attachment or at a post-CD4-binding step in the entry process. however, CV-N treatment results in cell activation, mitogenicity, and increased cytokine production in human PMBC. MVN is a monomer in solution with one sugar binding site that also recognizes terminal 1,2-mannose sugars. AH has the potential to be developed as a microbicide drug. it can effectively inhibit HIV-1 and HIV-2 with low IC50 values (2\u2013110 nM), block syncytium formation, and display neutralization activity against laboratory-adapted strains. binding lectin is considered the most potent HIV entry inhibitor to date. the protein contains 121 amino acids and folds into a stable domain-swapped homodimer. GRFT is currently the leading candidate for clinical use as an HIV prophylactic. the most credible mechanism proposed for virus-cell attachment involves the interaction between positively charged regions of the viral-envelope glycoproteins and negatively charged heparan sulphate proteoglycans. the fusion process starts with binding of gp120 to the cell-surface CD4 antigen. lectins have specific recognition for mannose (Man) and/or GlcNAc. lectin consists of 101 amino acids with a molecular weight of 11 kDa. lectin contains two carbohydrate-binding sites with specificity towards terminal 1,2-mannose sugars on high-mannose glycans. CV-N has broad neutralization activity against primary isolates. AH is an anti-HIV lectin isolated from the actinomycete longispora albida. the protein is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 12.5 kDa. AH has affinity only to glycoproteins with multiple high-mannose glycans. a mutation within the sugar-binding site of BanLec notably reduces its mitogenic activity without affecting HIV neutralization. GRFT is currently the leading lectin candidate for clinical use as an HIV prophylactic, neutralizing HIV with IC50 in the picomolar range. GRFT has an excellent safety profile when tested in a rabbit vaginal irritancy model [46], with minimal toxicity when administered in single or chronic subcutaneous doses in mice and guinea pigs [47]. lectins are active against a multitude of enveloped viruses which share the feature of heavily glycosylated proteins on their surfaces. a few envelope viruses sensitive to lectins are discussed below. a few envelope viruses sensitive to lectins are discussed below. g/ml [66] Cymbidium agglutinin (CA) 4.9 g/ml [66] Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) 1.3 M [67] HIV Griffithsin (GRFT) 0.04\u20130.63 nM [45] BanLec 0.33\u20134.1 nM [44] Actinohivin (AH) 2\u2013110 nM [42] Cyanovirin N (CV-N) cyanovirin-N can inhibit HCV infection by binding the N-linked glycans on its surface, preventing the interaction between E2 and the entry receptor CD81. other studies demonstrated that CV-N, Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) inhibit HCV in vitro. a lectin from the red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii (KAA-2) exerts potent anti-influenza effects by directly binding HA of multiple strains. a lectin from the green alga Boodlea coacta (BCA) exerts potent anti-influenza effects by directly binding HA of multiple strains, including the pandemic H1N1-2009 virus. lectins were shown to suppress cell fusion and hemadsorption associated with human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2) in vitro. the red alga Eucheuma serra derived high-mannose binding anti-HIV lectin ESA-2 strongly inhibits influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1) and influenza B viruses with IC50 values between 0.20 g/ml and 1.33 g/ml. oica agglutinin (UDA) demonstrate antiviral activities against coronaviruses in vitro and/or in vivo. strongest activities found predominantly among mannose-binding lectins. GRFT has been widely assessed for its activities against other enveloped viruses. cyanovirin-N can inhibit HCV infection by binding the N-linked glycans on its surface, preventing the interaction between E2 and the entry receptor CD81. other studies demonstrated that CV-N, Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) inhibit HCV in vitro. a lectin from the red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii (KAA-2) inhibits infection by multiple influenza strains with EC50 values in the low nanomolar range. a lectin from the green alga Boodlea coacta (BCA) exerts potent anti-influenza effects by directly binding HA of multiple strains, including the pandemic H1N1-2009 virus. fusion and hemadsorption associated with human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2) in vitro mainly by preventing virus adsorption to the cells. the red alga Eucheuma serra derived high-mannose binding anti-HIV lectin ESA-2 strongly inhibits influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1) and influenza B viruses with IC50 values between 0.20 g/ml and 1.33 g/ in an impressive screening of 33 plant lectins, remarkable antiviral effects on both SARS-CoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) with EC50 values at low g/ml levels were observed. strongest activities found predominantly among mannose-binding lectins. lectins should be included in antiviral strategies to fight SARS coronavirus infections. inflammatory and ulcerative STDs increase HIV susceptibility, while enhancing virus shedding and therefore increasing patient infectiousness. this vicious cycle might promote HIV superinfection. a socioepidemiological rationale was recently proposed for the development of multipurpose prevention technologies. this would help tackle both AIDS and other STDs and likely improve the immune system of the affected patients. more than 90% of all UPEC strains express the adhesin FimH. microbial lectins would compete for the binding of bacteria and prevent adhesion, consequently suppressing colonization and infection. three lectins, including the major outer membrane protein (MOMP; 40-kDa), a 32-kDa outer surface glycoprotein, and an 18-kDa molecule, have been reported. agglutinin, ricin, soybean, and peanut agglutinin have the ability to agglutinate different strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. TB is one of the top 10 causes of mortality worldwide according to the WHO. prevalence of a multiresistant form of TB (MDR-TB) that does not respond to first-line anti-TB drugs calls for new ways to cope with this infection. the novel lectin CasuL produced by Calliandra surinamensis was shown to display bacteriostatic effects and reduce biofilm formation by nonresistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. despite preliminary nature, these findings indicate that lectins could well target bacterial organisms. Punica granatum produces a chitin-binding lectin (PgTeL) with antifungal activity against Candida albicans and C. krusei. low dose of the plant lectin Con A has been shown to protect mice from a lethal dose of C. albicans by producing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) eukaryotic parasites include N-glycans, O-glycans, and lipophosphoglycans. glycoconjugates of eukaryotic parasites are critical to host-pathogen interactions. adherence, invasion, and immune activation suggest their potential importance in virulence. two lectins isolated from plants have been shown to be beneficial in controlling T. gondii infection in mice. the latter induce the production of cytokines necessary to control T. gondii infection without any cytotoxicity. also stimulate nitric oxide production by macrophages required for parasite killing. three lectins, including the major outer membrane protein (MOMP; 40-kDa), a 32-kDa outer surface glycoprotein, and an 18-kDa molecule, have been reported. two plant lectins, including wheat germ agglutinin and Galanthus nivalis lectin, can block chlamydial attachment sites and inhibit infection in vitro. tuberculosis is one of the top 10 causes of mortality worldwide according to the WHO. the prevalence of a multiresistant form of TB (MDR-TB) that does not respond to first-line anti-TB drugs calls for new ways to cope with this infection. the plant lectins ConBr and CFL produced by canavalia brasiliensis and Cratylia argentea induce antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects in mouse peritoneal macrophages. the plant lectins induce antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects in mouse peritoneal macrophages upon infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. chitin-binding lectin (PgTeL) with antifungal activity against Candida albicans and C. krusei. low dose of the plant lectin Con A has been shown to protect mice from lethal dose of C. albicans by producing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and activating macrophages. eukaryotic parasites include N-glycans, O-glycans, lipophosphoglycans. infection with T. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV acquisition. lectins with anti-HIV activity could potentially affect this parasite. lectins induce the production of cytokines necessary to control T. gondii infection without any cytotoxicity. also stimulate nitric oxide production by macrophages required for parasite killing."}
