{"summary": "pathogenic E. coli is causative of three clinical syndromes: urinary tract infections, enteric/diarrheal diseases and meningitis. key mechanisms by which E. coli cause enteric diseases include attachment and colonization of the intestinal mucosa, manipulation of the host cell cytoskeleton or evading host immune defenses. probiotics have been associated with the treatment of gastroenteritis. antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (Friedman, 2012), necrotizing enterocolitis (Alfaleh et al., 2011), pouchitis (Wall et al., 2011), inflammatory bowel diseases (Schultz, 2008), allergic disorders and others. a single colony from each strain was transferred into MRS broth for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for the preparation of the cell-free spent medium (CFSM) the isolated colonies were further identified using Vitek 2 system (Biomerieux, USA) study E. coli IC2 E. coli IC3 E. coli IC4 E. coli WW1 E. coli WW2 2.2. preparation of cell-free spent medium (CFSM) of probiotics. the CFSM of all probiotic strains was stored at 20 \u00b0C until use for further assays. the test bacteria were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. a top layer of molten and cooled TSA (5 ml) was poured on the bottom layer. 40 l of the test antibiofilm CFSM prepared was added in triplicate to the corresponding wells of sterile 96-well microtitre plate. the same volume of broth medium was added instead in case of experimental control. the biofilm biomass compared to negative control was determined using crystal violet (CV assay) six strains of probiotics belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were grown in man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS, Oxoid, Hampshire, England) agar medium for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. a single colony from each strain was transferred into MRS broth under the same incubation conditions for 24 h.

CFSM of skim milk fermented by probiotics exhibited a slight inhibitory activity against IC2 isolate using L. helveticus and L. rhamnosus. however, the rest of probiotic strains had no inhibitory effect on IC2 biofilms. us 0.072 0.015 (54.14) 0.095 0.089 (60.25) Control 0.157 0.010 0.239 0.030 Table 5. Antibiofilm potential mediated by CFSM of probiotics grown in skim milk. six multidrug resistant E. coli were isolated. two isolates showed intermediate sensitivity to cefoxitin and ciprofloxacin. the multidrug resistance pattern was exhibited by all isolates of which E. coli WW2 and E. coli IC2 were the most resistant to all antibiotics. the two studied E. coli isolates showed a satisfactory ability to form biofilms while E. coli WW1 is a strong biofilm former. all probiotics resulted in inhibition of biofilm formation to similar extent. B. longum and L. helveticus showed the strongest antibiofilm activity against the WW1 isolate. these results demonstrated promising inhibitory potential of CFSM of standard MRS broth medium and skim milk fermented by probiotics. emergence of multidrug-resistant E. coli has been increasingly reported. emergence of multidrug-resistant E. coli has been reported. probiotics have received a growing interest in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases such as gastrointestinal, urogenital, respiratory and even periodontal diseases. probiotics belong to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species were able to reduce the growth of drug-resistant E. coli when investigated using agar well diffusion method. infections due to biofilms formed by Staphylococcus sp. and enterobacteria such as E. coli are difficult to diagnose. CFSM of probiotics grown in MRS broth or skim milk reduced biofilm formation of two multidrug resistant E. coli."}
