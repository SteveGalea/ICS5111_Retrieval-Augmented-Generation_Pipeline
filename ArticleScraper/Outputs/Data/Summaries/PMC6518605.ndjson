Virus shedding started 1\u20132 days post-infection (dpi) no infectious virus or viral RNA was detected in faecal or urine samples. a study following camels on a closed farm found that neutralizing antibodies remained consistent during a year [30], while other studies found that antibody titres rapidly drop by 1\u20134-fold within a period often as short as 2 weeks. additional serological evidence of the widespread presence of MERS-CoV in camels has been found in 18 additional countries. one out of 17 camels that had MERS-CoV antibodies in Bangladesh was born in Bangladesh. 16 others were imported from india. there is no record of foreign origin of the seropositive camels from Pakistan. median rate of nasal shedding in 0\u20132 years old camels was 34% (718/2612; range 0\u2013100%) of cases compared with 2% (91/1142; range 0\u2013100%) in camels older than 2 years. similar disagreeing results are published for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA in male vs. female camels. a median seroprevalence of 84% (5632/8115; range 0\u2013100%; excluding Australia and Spain) in camels from farms and 80% (943/1005; range 28\u201398%) in the camel population sampled at markets and quarantine facilities. some authors did not find a statistical difference between the two herd management types, while others found some evidence of higher seroprevalences in nomadic herds. to date, no MERS-CoV antibodies or viral RNA have been detected in Bactrian camels [4, 37, 44\u201347]. most surveys that investigated sheep did not find evidence of MERS-CoV infection or exposure. literature search The literature search resulted in a total of 53 papers. in total, 33 papers describe camel studies in the Middle East, 13 studies investigated camels from Africa and the remaining seven surveys were from Spain, Australia, Japan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. valence Sex Age Imported/local Sampling location Other animals tested Hemida et al.
