{"summary": "exposure to asbestos can result in pleural lung fibrosis. occupationally related asbestos exposure contributes to 5\u20137% of all lung cancer cases. genetic factors have been suggested to be involved in asbestos-related carcinogenesis and lung genotoxicity. current GWASs have been designed to detect the main effect of genetic variants. the ability to detect gene\u2013environment interactions even in the single SNP analysis has been limited. study included 1154 patients newly diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 1137 cancer-free controls, who were non-Hispanic white ever smokers and frequency matched by age (5 years), sex and smoking status. participants signed an informed consent, provided a 30ml blood sample and completed a personal interview using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis Chi-square tests were used to compare differences in distributions of demographic variables between the cases and controls. logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to determine the main effect of self-reported asbestos exposure and smoking status on the risk of lung cancer. a versatile gene-based test (VEGAS) was used to assess the gene-level interaction by assessing the P-values of the SNP-level gene\u2013asbestos exposure interaction (20) the gene-based test statistic was the sum of the chi-squared 1 df statistics within that gene (with the gene boundaries of 50kb away from two sides of the gene) the linkage disequilibrium between markers and number of SNPs per gene was calculated. i-GSEA used label permutations instead of phenotype-label permutations in a classical GSEA to calculate nominal P-values. i-GSEA focuses on the pathways or gene sets with the highest proportions of significant genes instead of relying solely on the total significance generated from either a few or many significant genes. pathways or gene sets with FDR 0.25 were regarded as mild confidence that the interactions were enriched in a pathway. the study included 1154 patients newly diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 1137 cancer-free controls. former smokers were defined as a person who had quit smoking >1 year before enrollment. current smokers included recent quitters who had quit smoking within the past 12 months. pack-years were calculated as the years smoked times the average number of cigarettes per day divided by 20. the interaction term was used to assess the significance of the interaction between genetic variants and asbestos exposure. since there were 307 944 SNPs having P-values, a P-value of 1.610\u20137 (0.05/307 944) was considered the threshold for a statistically significant test. significance proportion-based enrichment score was calculated to estimate enrichment of genotype\u2013phenotype association in a particular gene set S. i-GSEA was implemented by using SNP-label permutations instead of phenotype-label permutations in a classical GSEA. i-GSEA focuses on the pathways or gene sets with the highest proportions of significant genes instead of relying solely on the total significance generated from either a few or many significant genes. MSigDB included gene sets denoting canonical pathways integrated from a variety of online resources like KEGG (23), signal transduction knowledge environment (Science Signaling, [24]), BioCarta (25), GO (gene ontology) terms with high confidence (26). pathways or gene sets with FDR 0.25 were regarded as mild confidence that the interactions were enriched in a pathway. 4.8 359 31.6 61\u201370 391 33.9 491 43.2 >70 282 24.4 150 13.2 Sex 0.855a Male 658 57.0 644 54.6 Female 496 43.0 493 43.4 Smoking Status Current smoker 600 52.0 657 57.8 1.00 Former smoker 554 48.0 480 42.2 1.26 (1.07\u20131.49) 0.005b Pack-years 25 209 18.1 288 25.3 1.00 26\u201350 458 36.7 4 gene self-reported asbestos exposure interactions with \u2013log10 P-value for genome-wide gene\u2013asbestos exposure interaction and lung cancer risk. each of P-values was calculated by the interaction term of an additive model for risk associated with self-reported asbestos exposure. the top 20 SNPs in the genome-wide interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure in lung cancer risk SNP Chromosome Position Gene Location Allele change MAF. 17 572 genes were mapped according to positions on the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser hg18 assembly. most of the other top 20 significant genes were located at a narrow region of chromosome 11q13. most of the other top 20 significant genes were located at a narrow region of chromosome 11q13. the top 20 genes in the gene-level genome-wide interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure and lung cancer risk Gene Chromosome location Gene description Number of SNPs P a C7orf54 7q32.1 Chromosome 7 open reading frame 54 7 8.90E-05 LRRC4 7q31.3 Leucine rich repeat containing 4 9 1.87E-04 SND1 7q31.3 Staphylococcal nuclease and tudor q21\u2013q25 Angiotensin II receptor, type 1 18 5.76E-03 ZNF177 19p13.2 Zinc finger protein 177 6 5.94E-03 ARHGEF15 17p13.1 Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 15 16 6.10E-03 TXN2 22q13.1 Thioredoxin 2 19 6.19E-03 a P-values were estimated by a versatile gene-based test approach. antigen processing and presentation Genes involved in type I diabetes mellitus 0.0010 0.055 19/59/83 Type I diabetes mellitus Genes involved in type I diabetes mellitus 0.0010 0.089 19/41/45 Granule cell survival pathway The survival and differentiation of granule cells in the brain is controlled by pro-growth PACAP and pro-apoptotic ceramides. a total of 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 controls were included in the study. there were more current smokers in controls than in cases (P = 0.005) but cases had smoked more pack-years than the controls (P 0.001) bOR, 95% CI and P-values were estimated by unconditional logistic regression model. cAsbestos exposure status for 32 cases and 4 controls were missed. the top 20 significant SNPs are listed in Table II.

GWASs may have limited power to detect gene\u2013environment interactions at the SNP and gene levels. pathway-based approach may be more powerful in performing genome-wide gene\u2013environment analyses."}
