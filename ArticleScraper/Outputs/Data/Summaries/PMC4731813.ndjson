{"summary": "cat 1 and cat 3 started shedding viral RNA from day 2\u20134 onwards. faecal shedding peaked at 5 dpi and remained at high levels until 28 dpi. cat 2 showed no loss of appetite, weight loss or abnormal stool consistency. dpi for cat 1 and 3, respectively, were 3\u20134.3 log10 higher with the 3\u2032 RT-qPCR compared to the 5\u2032 RT-qPCR. thereafter, viral RNA was undetectable until 14 dpi. this cat ultimately stopped shedding 6 months after inoculation. antibody titres were assessed in the serum on day 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 pi by virus neutralisation assay in enterocytes using FECV UCD (blue line) RNA levels in saliva were the highest in all cats directly after inoculation. the days at which the samples were positive varied considerably between cats. NK cells, Tregs, and CD8+ Tregs were quantified by flow cytometry in regularly taken blood samples. two horizontal dashed lines represent reference values in healthy animals. the complete genomes of the faecally shed viruses were determined at different time points. 83.8% of all reads showed a 101 bp deletion in the 7b gene. the most striking difference was found in the viruses shed by cat 2. the deletion was no longer found at a later time point (84 dpi) in cat 1, no amino acid substitutions had occurred by 7 dpi. in cat 3, single amino acid substitutions were found in a minority of the viruses in nsp6, nsp9, nsp12, and spike protein at 9 dpi. 3GenBank accession numbers KU215421 (with 7b deletion) and KU215422 (without 7b deletion) 4GenBank accession number KU215423. 582.4%, 662.3%, 744.6%, 883.8%, 921.9%, 10,1332.7% of all reads. 2GenBank accession numbers KU215424 (with S1 deletion) and KU215428 (without S1 deletion). 5,7,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,20,21,22,23,28100%, 897.8%, 10. spike protein was the most affected in all cats. most mutations in the spike protein occurred in the globular S1 domain. mutations included deletions (cat 1 and 3) and amino acid substitutions. clinical signs Mild clinical signs were seen in cat 1 and cat 3 during the first week after inoculation. they consisted of diminished appetite and moderate weight loss, to 95.4 and 88.4% of the initial weight for cat 1 and 3, respectively. cat 1 also showed an increased body temperature at 4 (39.5 \u00b0C) and 6 (39.7 \u00b0C) dpi. viral RNA levels were 3\u20134.3 log10 higher with the 3\u2032 RT-qPCR compared to the 5\u2032 RT-qPCR. thereafter, viral RNA was undetectable until 14 dpi. this cat ultimately stopped shedding 6 months after inoculation. the amount of infectious virus was determined by titration of faecal suspensions in feline enterocyte cultures (orange dashed line) neutrising antibody titres were assessed in the serum on day 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 pi by virus neutralisation assay in enterocytes using FECV UCD. RNA levels in saliva were the highest in all cats directly after inoculation. NK cells slowly declined until 14 or 21 dpi, whereupon they rose again to pre-infection level at 56 dpi. NK cells, Tregs, and CD8+ Tregs were quantified by flow cytometry in regularly taken blood samples. no abnormal leukocyte numbers were observed in any of the cats. for each cat, T and B cell numbers followed a similar trend. both cat 1 and 3 showed a slight lymphocytosis, which coincided with cessation of shedding. NK cells, Tregs, and CD8+ Tregs were quantified by flow cytometry. no cell-free viraemia was detected, but a cell-associated viraemia was observed at infrequent time points for all cats. viraemia in cat 2 was detected before the onset of faecal shedding. 83.8% of all reads showed a 101 bp deletion in the 7b gene. 83.8% of all reads showed a 101 bp deletion in the 7b gene. this resulted in the formation of a truncated 7b protein with only 143 amino acids.

FECV is not confined to the intestinal epithelial cells but can be found at low level throughout the body in cells of the monocytic lineage19,30. it is known that FECV is not confined to the intestinal epithelial cells but can also be found at low level throughout the body in cells of the monocytic lineage19,30. this systemic spread is supported by the cell-associated viraemia detected in the present study. the onset of mutant viruses is not surprising, since RNA viruses generally have a high mutation rate. in the present study, notably the amino-terminal part of the spike protein had extensively mutated in all cats. two of the three cats even showed small deletions in this domain. FECV infection was characterised by a transient NK cell reduction in peripheral blood, which was most likely the result of migration of NK cells to the intestine or associated lymphoid tissue. FECV infection was characterised by a transient NK cell reduction in peripheral blood, which was most likely the result of migration of NK cells to the intestine or associated lymphoid tissue. cat 2 showed a deviating pattern in peripheral circulating CD8+ Tregs compared to other cats. if and how these cells played a role in the aberrant infection pattern of this cat remains elusive. if and how these cells played a role in the aberrant infection pattern of this cat remains elusive. faecal suspension containing an unknown titre of the FECV strain UCD was provided by Dr. Rottier (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) the suspension was centrifuged at 16200 g for 10 min to remove bacterial or host cells. animals were infected with 800 l of faecal suspension supernatant, while stimulating the swallowing reflex. litter trays, food trays and water bowls were cleaned and decontaminated daily. cats were monitored each day during the first week after infection. each time, the rectal temperature was measured, lymph nodes were palpated, an oral swab was taken and faeces were collected. RT-PCR based on SYBR Green detection was performed with primers described by Gut et al.
