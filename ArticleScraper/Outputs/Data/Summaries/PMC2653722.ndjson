{"summary": "virions are wrapped within intracellular membrane-bound compartments. the newly budded viruses exit the cell by using the cellular secretory pathway. avian coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the third group of coronaviruses genus. the M protein is a type III membrane protein and a key player in coronavirus assembly. it spans the membrane bilayer three times, leaving a short amino-terminal domain on the virion exterior surface. a large carboxy-terminal tail in the virion interior (or in the plasma) [6]. Lateral interactions between M proteins are thought to mediate the formation of the virion envelope. actin filaments form the cytoskeleton, a three-dimensional network inside a eukaryotic cell. actin filaments provide mechanical support for the cell, determine the cell shape, enable cell movements (through lamellipodia, filopodia, or pseudopodia) actin was identified as a potential interacting protein of the IBV M protein. transfection H1299 and Vero cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 and complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) they were supplemented with 10% new born calf serum (Sterile) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO2. 90% monolayers of H1299 cells were infected with 10 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell of cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. cells were then washed with PBS, incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DAKO) in fluorescence dilution buffer at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour and with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin at RT for 20 minutes before mounting. in vitro assembly and transcription of full-length cDNA clones were carried. plasmids were digested with either BsmBI (fragment A) or BsaI (fragments B, C, D and E) bands corresponding to each fragment were cut from the gels and purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.) RT-PCR and real-time PCR Viral RNA reverse-transcribed to cDNA. random hexamers (300 ng) and total RNA (5 g) were incubated for 10 minutes at 70\u00b0C. reaction was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 hour followed by 20 minutes at 70\u00b0C. the deletion constructs M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 were made by two rounds of PCR. the primer used for M1 is 5\u2032-AACTGCAGTTAAGCAAGCCACTGACCCTC-3. the primer for M3 is 5\u2032-AACTGCAGCTTT GGTCACCAG-3. 90% monolayers of H1299 cells were infected with 10 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell of the recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF-3), which express the T7 RNA polymerase gene, for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C prior to transfection. total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C and further incubated for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. cells were then washed with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DAKO) in fluorescence dilution buffer at room temperature for 2 hours. cells were then incubated with DAKO in fluorescence dilution buffer at room temperature for 2 hours. samples were lysed with 2SDS loading buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. in vitro assembly and transcription of full-length cDNA clones were carried. plasmids were digested with either BsmBI (fragment A) or BsaI (fragments B, C, D and E) bands corresponding to each of the fragments were cut from the gels and purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.) random hexamers (300 ng) and total RNA (5 g) were incubated for 10 minutes at 70\u00b0C. the reaction was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 hour followed by 20 minutes at 70\u00b0C to inactivate the RT. a forward primer in the leader sequence and a reverse primer were used to generate a product by RT. the primer used for M1 is 5\u2032-AACTGCAGTTAAGCAAGCCACTGACCCTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTCTGGTTCACACTTA TAACCTACAAAGA-3\u2032. the primers for M4 are 5\u2032-TGTGAGGGTCCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAAGTGGTCTCTGGACCCTCACA-3. actin was detected in fractions 7\u201311 with majority of the protein located in fractions 8\u201310. lysates from cells without IBV infection were mainly detected in fractions 3\u20134. it is currently uncertain if actin could be incorporated into virions. IBV proteins were used as baits to screen a human cDNA library in yeast two-hybrid screening. the full-length cDNA for -actin was amplified by RT-PCR from HeLa cells, cloned into an expression vector with a c-Myc tag at its N-terminus (Myc-actin) the same cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. no detection of the M protein was found in cells expressing either the M protein or Myc-actin alone. heLa cells were transfected with the tagged actin alone (lanes 1, 4, 7 and 10), IBV M alone (lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11) or cotransfected with actin and IBV M (lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12) Western blot analysis showed similar expression levels of wild type and mutant constructs in yeast. however, none of the other deletion and mutant constructs could grow on the same plate. polypeptides were either analyzed directly by Western blot with anti-Myc antibody (lower panel), or subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-actin antibodies. co-immunoprecipitation was carried out by expressing myc-tag wild type M (C-terminal domain from amino acid 104 to 225, Myc-M) cells treated with cytochalasin D were transfected with M construct. 12.5 g/ml of cytochalasin D was added to the cells at 4 hours post-transfection. the same cells were also stained with actin dye Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin. deletion and mutation were introduced into a full-length IBV infectious clone. the effect of this minimal deletion and mutation on the replication of viral RNA and the recovery of infectious IBV was analyzed. no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with either M5 or Mm1 transcripts. in vitro transcripts derived from wild type, M5 and Mm1 full-length IBV clones were electroporated into vero cells. at 24 and 72 hours post-electroporation, total RNA was extracted from the cells and specific primers were used to detect the minus RNA and subgenomic mRNA 4 (lower panel) the forward primer (5\u2032-ACTTAAGATAGATATTA A-3\u2032) used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from nucleotides 26\u201346 in the genomic RNA. downstream primer (5\u2032-CTCTGGATCCAATAATAACCTAC-3\u2032) covers the IBV sequence from nucleotides 24784 to 24803. a dominant 415 bp PCR product corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA 159-K160 deletion M sequences (pM5) were transfected into H1299 cells using the vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus expression system. this cell line can be efficiently infected by the vero cell-adapted IBV [17] and is much more resistant to the vaccinia virus-induced morphological changes. at 16 hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of approximately 0.5 PFU/cell t analysis with anti-IBV E protein antibodies showed the presence of E protein in cells expressing the protein on its own or together with wild type or the Mm1 mutant protein. the results confirm that the A159-P/K160-E mutations did not affect the interaction between IBV M and E proteins. cytochalasin D was added to cells at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hours post-infection. no obvious difference in expression of N protein was seen when cytochalasin D was added at 16 hours post-infection. western blot analysis of actin was included as a loading control. confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 2 PFU/cell. the supernatants were collected at 18 hours post-infection and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes. the virus particles were spun down by ultracentrifugation through a 2 ml sucrose cushion (20%). the virus was pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 2 ml surcrose cushion (20%) at 175,000g for 3 hours and further purified using a linear gradient of 10\u201350% sucrose at 175,000g for 18 hours. polypeptides were analyzed by Western blot with anti-actin antibodies. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-M antibodies showed the detection of the Myc-tagged actin. no detection of the M protein was found in cells expressing either the M protein or Myc-actin alone. Western blot analysis showed similar expression levels of wild type and mutant constructs in yeast. as M5 contains minimal deletion of two amino acids, this study maps the actin-binding site on the M protein to the region containing amino acids A159 and K160. the two N-linked glycosylation sites (N-gly), three transmembrane domains (Tm1-3) and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the M protein are highlighted. also shown are the amino acid positions of the deleted and mutated region in each construct. Western blot analysis of the precipitates with anti-actin antibody showed the presence of Myc-M but not Myc-Mm1. the detection of Myc-M in the immunoprecipitates was greatly enhanced by co-expression of Myc-M and actin. the plasmids containing the M gene were transfected into H1299 cells. at 4 hours post-transfection, the cells were treated by cytochalasin D (12.5 g/ml) and stained with anti-M antibodies. the same cells were stained with actin dye Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (green). the primer pair (5\u2032-14931GCTTATCCACT AGTACATC14949-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-15578CTTCTCTCTCGCACTAGCA15600-3\u2032) was chosen to amplify the negative strand IBV sequence from nucleotides 14931 to 15600 by the RT-PCR. if replication of viral RNA occurred, a 670 bp RT-PCR fragment would be expected. s were analyzed by Western blot with anti-IBV M antibodies. the precipitates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-E antibodies. a dominant 415 bp PCR product corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA4 would be detected. a much weaker band was detected in cells transfected with the two mutant transcripts at 24 hours post-transfection. the amounts of the subgenomic RNA 4 fragment detected from cells transfected with M5 and Mm1 transcripts were increased approximately 3 to 5 fold, respectively, at 72 hours post-transfection based on real time PCR assay. the expression of the A159-K160 deletion M protein significantly reduces the infectivity of IBV. this suggests that expression of this mutant protein could inhibit the production of infectious virus in a dominant-negative manner. this suggests that expression of the mutant protein significantly reduces the infectivity of IBV. the effects of disrupting actin filaments by cytochalasin D on the replication, budding and release of IBV were tested by detailed time-course experiments. the effects of disrupting actin filaments by cytochalasin D on the replication, budding and release of IBV were tested by detailed time-course experiments. no N protein was detected in supernatants harvested from cells treated with cytochalasin D at 0, 4 and 8 hour post-infection. no N protein was detected in supernatants harvested from cells treated with cytochalasin D at 0, 4 and 8 hour post-infection. the interacting region in the M protein was pinpointed by deletion and mutation studies. the domain responsible for this interaction may be located in the region covering amino acids 159\u2013160. however, the two amino acids are not conserved in other coronaviruses. the M protein of Newcastle disease virus could interact with actin in vitro. it could aggregate elongation factor 1 through direct interaction. the SARS-CoV N protein could induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stress conditions. actin-binding proteins are grouped into 60 distinct classes based on primary structures. the sequence of the actin-binding sites ranges from 10\u201330 residues. the sequence of the actin-binding sites ranges from 10\u201330 residues. cytochalasin D was added early in the viral replication cycle. it suggests actin filaments are unlikely involved in the release of the IBV particles. however, our data support that actin filaments may be involved in the virion assembly and budding process."}
