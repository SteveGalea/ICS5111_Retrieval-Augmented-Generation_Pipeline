{"summary": "country-specific healthcare cost data, valuation of life, and lost tourism revenue were imputed. successful border closure for 26 weeks provided a net societal benefit. but for some other pandemic scenarios, border closure resulted in a net negative societal value. border closures have a limited, if any, role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. a new virus that had the infectiousness of measles or influenza would justify extraordinary control measures. a new virus that had the infectiousness of measles or influenza and the lethality of rabies or Ebola would justify extraordinary control measures. new Zealand has the benefits of being geographically remote. it has a very well developed border control system. the model extrapolated existing data on past influenza pandemics in new Zealand. input parameters used in the pandemic and border closure model. Variable Expected value Distribution* Data source/s and details Key epidemiological characteristics Proportion (of the population) infected Scenario A: 0.400 Beta (14.6, 21.9) Wilson et al 2012 [9] (within the range of 33% to 50% for 1918 influenza pandemic data) Scenario B: 0.100 Proportional to infected, capped at 10%. average number of international visitors per day to NZ (number of visitor days per annum divided by 365) 151,251 Gamma (11.1, 13613) NZ Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment [16] Value of saving a life in each five year age group (males and females combined) the key aspects of the pandemic scenarios were scaled from historical experience with influenza pandemics in the new Zealand setting. Scenario A was a serious pandemic that was assumed to have similar morbidity impacts to the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic. border closure intervention was assumed to completely prevent any harm to health from the threat. the ratio of the proportion infected in the 1918 pandemic to the proportion infected in 2009 allowed us to estimate the number likely to consult their GP in the Scenario A pandemic. we assumed 50% of the population would be infected, 10% would consult their GP and 10 times as many would die as in the Scenario A pandemic. deaths in the more extreme Scenario B pandemic were modeled as 10 times greater than the 1918 scenario. infected people were modeled as experiencing one week with the DW. those consulting their GP experienced two weeks, and those hospitalized received three weeks. the DWs were multiplied by (1-pYLD [prevalent years lived with disability] to account for the proportion of years lived with disability derived from life-tables. in terms of direct health care costs, GP visit costs were set at NZ$60 per visit. hospitalization costs were those that have previously been estimated for the 2009 pandemic in new Zealand [8]. from this we could calculate the average number of international visitors in new Zealand on the day of border closure. out of new Zealand were assumed to be via one highly-guarded shipping port and one highly-guarded airport. we assumed that this would constrain the total value of cargo-based exports and imports by 50% during the \u201cborder closure\u201d period. also assumed a recovery period of three months after the border was reopened until normal cargo trade for exports and imports was resumed. the border closure intervention was assumed to completely prevent any harm to health from the threat of these two pandemic scenarios. if trans-oceanic yachts or private jets attempted to enter territorial space after closure, it was anticipated that they would be detected and managed by new Zealand\u2019s military (e.g., forced to go to other countries or to uninhabited off-shore islands around the coast) population data by five-year age groups in 2014 were used for calculations. deaths in the more extreme Scenario B pandemic were modeled as 10 times greater than the 1918 scenario. we assumed \u2018W-shaped\u2019 mortality rate distributions with peak death rates for children and younger adults. the \u201cExpected Maximum Intervention Cost\u201d is the amount of money that a society might spend on a one-off intervention to save the life of an individual given their age. the online calculator allows for country-specific estimates of these values, but we used the values for new Zealand in the main analysis [13] for the cost-effectiveness threshold. tourists remaining in new Zealand (estimated at NZ$200 per day per person) and the costs of evacuating visitors by essentially \u201cone-way\u201d flights home (estimated at NZ$1000 per individual) border closure enforcement costs (including guarding cargo ships) were ignored due to the complexity of this aspect. also ignored the costs of using air force and naval patrols to ensure border protection. in this extreme scenario we assumed a complete end to all cargo imports and exports in and out of new Zealand during the \u201cborder closure\u201d period. this would effectively double the impact of the scenario detailed above. we also assumed a recovery period of three months after the border was reopened until normal cargo trade for exports and imports was resumed. border closure accounting just for direct health system costs of pandemic, 26-week linear return after initial 50% tourist downturn, evacuation costs, and 2 weeks accommodation. if border closure failed, and as a result the pandemic reached New Zealand, then closure would no longer be cost-beneficial in Scenario B. a 12-week border closure was still cost-beneficial for some scenarios. for the Scenario A pandemic with a subsequent 50% tourism downturn, 26-weeks linear return to normal visitor numbers, closure was still estimated to be beneficial overall by NZ$300 million compared with no closure. a net societal benefit was estimated for closing the borders for 50 weeks if 0.15% of the population were predicted to die. Scenario A x 5 (100%) +23.9 -5.3 6. Scenario A x 3 (100%) +0.4 -28.9 * These use the \u2018base scenario\u2019 i.e. we don\u2019t account for costs of returning visitors home, nor do we account for their accommodation costs. the proportion dying from the pandemic was the most influential parameter on the net economic impact of the base-case for Scenario A. the proportion dying from the pandemic was the most influential parameter on the net economic impact of the base-case for Scenario A. the severity threshold where border closure is likely to be justified is (not surprising) higher in situations where the duration of closure needs to be prolonged. any comprehensive pandemic plan by an island country could include ways of reducing these negative effects (e.g., by planning contingency measures to support continuing export and import activities during such periods) food imports are largely discretionary for new Zealand at present. a MCDA approach could also capture considerations around more adverse health and economic impacts on low-income populations that could exacerbate inequities. a period of border closure could delay the arrival of the pandemic. even short border closures could buy time to allow for more detailed epidemiological assessment. a workable policy would need the capacity for rapid border closure before detailed knowledge about the nature of the novel pandemic agent. the international health regulations (2005) include in their stated purpose (Article 2) a focus on preventing the international spread of disease. it is therefore important to build on the initial work presented here to further refine the circumstances and types of countries where the level of public health risk, and potential health gain, might justify border closures. some of these designated exports could be diverted to the domestic market. similar arguments might also apply to imports with some of these goods able to be stockpiled in foreign ports until the new Zealand border closure ended. a MCDA approach may also capture considerations around more adverse health and economic impacts on low-income populations that could exacerbate inequities. a period of border closure could delay the arrival of the pandemic. even short border closures could buy time to allow for more detailed epidemiological assessment, time to launch a national mass media campaign around hygiene and staying at home if sick. the cost-benefit calculation can flip from being massively cost-beneficial to a substantial net societal loss. the topic of border closure for different types of countries also needs to be further refined at the international level."}
