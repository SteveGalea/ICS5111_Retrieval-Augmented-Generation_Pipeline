{"summary": "multicenter study enrolls adult patients coming from the community with pneumonia. risk factors included AIDS, aplastic anemia, asplenia, hematological cancer, chemotherapy, neutropenia, biological drug use, lung transplantation, chronic steroid use, and solid tumor. the GLIMP study was an international, multicenter, observational, point-prevalence study of adult patients hospitalized for community-onset pneumonia in 54 countries worldwide. patients were enrolled on a single day during the months of March, April, May, and June 2015. the methods of the study have been published elsewhere. microbiological examinations and susceptibility tests were performed within the first 24 hours after hospital admission. non-community-acquired bacteria were stratified according to the coverage of standard CAP therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). aplastic anemia, asplenia, hematological cancer, lymphoma, acute or chronic leukemia, or multiple myeloma. hematological cancer, defined as lymphoma, acute or chronic leukemia, or multiple myeloma, defined as a neutrophil count 500/dL. a network analysis was conducted to represent the frequencies of all immunocompromise variables and their relationships. the size of the circles represents both prevalence of the risk factor and strength of association with other variables. the predictive value of each variable was analyzed using a cox regression logistic analysis. data collected from medical records at the time of hospital admission. data gathered included demographics; respiratory and cardiovascular comorbid conditions; immunocompromised status and other chronic medical conditions; severity of pneumonia. specific risk factors for resistant pathogens infection included chronic aspiration, being bedridden, malnutrition, presence of enteric tube feeding and indwelling catheters. atypical pathogens included C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia. CAP therapy was defined as -lactams (ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam) and fluoroquinolones alone. acute or chronic leukemia, or multiple myeloma; (5) chemotherapy during the last 3 months; (6) neutropenia, defined as a neutrophil count 500/dL at complete blood cell count; (7) biological drug use (including trastuzumab and therapies for autoimmune diseases, eg, anti-tumor necrosis factor, prescribed during 6 months before hospital admission); (8) lung transplantation; (9) chronic steroid use (>10 mg/d of pred the prevalence of immunocompromise was significantly higher in both North and South America than in the rest of the world. the prevalence of immunocompromise was significantly higher in both North and South America than in the rest of the world. clinical and microbiological Characteristics of patients with immunocompromise are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3. immunocompromised patients were significantly younger and malnourished, had a higher frequency of comorbid conditions, previous infections, and colonization by resistant pathogens.

ICS use 1.76 (1.09\u20132.82). a subanalysis was conducted among patients with chronic steroid use versus other risk factors for immunocompromise. the prevalence of immunocompromise was significantly higher in both North and South America than in the rest of the world. in the study, categorized as no data, 5%, 5%\u201310%, 11%\u201320%, 21%\u201330%, or >30% of total cases. chronic steroid use (45.0%), hematological cancer (25.0%), and chemotherapy (22.0%) were the most frequent ones. 125 (6.5) 41 (10.5).004 Malnutrition 243 (8.0) 80 (12.3).001 Bedridden 355 (11.6) 60 (9.2).04 Chronic aspiration 224 (7.3) 33 (5.1) microbiological testing was performed in 91.0% (596 of 652) of immunocompromised and 86.0% (2626 of 3050) of immunocompetent patients (P.001). Bacteremia was found in 6.0% (36 of 596) of immunocompromised and 5.5% (145 of 2626; P =.62) of immunocompetent patients. patients, no.

AIDS (OR, 15.10; 95% CI, 6.36\u201335.88; P =.001) and hematological cancer (4.65; 91.85\u201311.69; P =.001) were independently associated with fungal infections; hematological cancer (5.49; 2.20\u201313.70; P.001) and severe pneumonia (2.56; 1.27\u20135.19; P =.009) with infection by viruses other than influenza; and AIDS (4.41; 1.53\u201312.73; P 17.6% of patients admitted with pneumonia from the community have 1 risk factor for immunocompromise, with significant differences among continents and countries. chronic steroid use is by far the most prevalent risk factor leading to immunocompromise, followed by hematological cancer and chemotherapy. 1 in 5 hospitalized patients with CAP are not immunocompetent. the most frequent risk factor for immunocompromise is the chronic use of systemic steroids. AIDS, lung transplantation, asplenia, and aplastic anemia seem to be less frequent at admission and to represent distinct clinical entities. e is the leading microorganism in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent groups [32, 33] only P. aeruginosa was more frequently isolated in immunocompromised compared with immunocompetent patients. these findings differ from microbiological results of previous studies. there are no studies on bacteremia and immunocompromise in general. the majority of studies have focused on bacteremia in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. the prevalence of bacteremia was 5T\u20136% in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. we were not able to involve many investigators from Asia and Africa. most cases occurred in North America and Europe, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings. our study offers to the scientific community a perspective on immunocompromised patients coming from the community with pneumonia."}
