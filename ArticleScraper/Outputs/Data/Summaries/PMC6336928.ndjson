GHX01 Genkwanin BX02 Cavidine GHX04 Irisolidone BZ04 Coumarin GHX05 Patchouli alcohol CP03 Nobiletin GHX06 Quercetin DFP01 Arecolidine HP01 Magnolol HP02 Honokiol GC35 Pachymic acid GC11 Medicarpin BX03 Baicalein GHX07 Rutin GC69 Glycyrrhizic acid GC13 flavonoids belong to two categories: 2-phenylchromans (40) and 3-phenylchromans (21) flavonoid active ingredients in HXZQ belong to two categories: 2-phenylchromans (40) and 3-phenylchromans (21), also called isoflavoids. GHX06 exerts remarkable antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. flavonoids, the main ingredients of HXZQ, should be the major molecular bioactivities basis of this formula. terpenoids, another major category of HXZQ\u2019s active components, are defined as the derivative of mevalonic acid conforming to the (C5H8)n general structure. a comparison of the properties of herbal active ingredients and DrugBank medicines is carried out by consideration of eight common molecular descriptors. the specific content of this rule is a rule of thumb to evaluate the DL or determine if a compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has chemical and physical properties to make it a likely orally active drug in humans. four parameters including nHDon, nHAcc, MW, and MlogP are all related to this principle and meet the rule well. significant difference exists between the herbal chemicals in nHDon, nHAcc, and MlogP as shown in Table 3 (with p > 0.05) nCIC, TPSA, and RBN are also shown in Table 3. the average value of TPSA is lower than those of drugBank ones. the compounds in herbal formula are more likely to permeate the membrane and be absorbed by human body. the combination rules of HXZQ herbs based on the TCM \u201cJun-Chen-Zuo-Shi\u201d theory. presently, we first analyzed the therapeutic functions of individual herbs of the formula on FD treatment from these three classes of factors. based on the analysis of the structural distribution of active compounds in the herbs and the contribution of their specific activities to FD treatment. GHX is the dried aerial part of a famous herb called Guanghuoxiang. it regulates the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, accelerates the secretion of digestive juice, and protects the human body. this principle signifies that each herb of the recipe has a specific function within the composition. GHX contains 94 ingredients, where 7 compounds are identified as candidate compounds. irisolidone (GHX04), a major isoflavone in GHX, has a wide spectrum of favorable bioactivities. patchouli alcohol (GHX05), GHX\u2019s principal ingredient and a tricyclic sesquiterpene, also demonstrates high selective antibacterial effects against H. pylori. GHX is the most abundant herb in HXZQ, which may also account for its prominent roles in the formula. despite the relatively low levels of relative blood concentration, ZS and BZ exert their medicinal properties. in FD therapy, these drugs mainly undertake a function of promoting the insufficient gastrointestinal motility. in FD therapy, these drugs mainly undertake a function of promoting the insufficient gastrointestinal motility and dealing with minor symptoms like abdominal distension, belching, nausea and vomiting. glycyrrhizic acid (GC69) reacts with these alkaloids and weakens their adverse effects. GC is widely used in concerted application of botanical drugs as a crucial Shi drug. GC regulates the function of certain transporters like p-glycoprotein. GC also regulates the function of certain transporters like p-glycoprotein. GC possesses a broad range of activities including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, immunostimulant, anti-oxidant, antispasmodic metabolic syndrome prevention activities. a compound-target network is constructed by using all 132 active components of HXZQ formula. circles and hexagons represent bioactive compounds and corresponding FD targets. purple, green and blue hexagons represent the inflammatory, immunological and gastrointestinal targets. figure 6 shows the degree and betweenness distribution of all targets and top 60 active compounds. the most highly connected nodes have higher centrality scores. the most highly connected nodes possess high betweenness values. BX02 decreases the expression of various inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), PGE2 and cytokines like TNF- and interleukin (IL-6) thus, these highly connected chemicals are key to HXZQ for exerting proper efficacy. the average degree of candidate compounds is as big as 10.7, proving the multi-ingredient cooperative mechanism of the formula. Imm-C-T (Immune-Compound-Target) and Gas-C-T (Gastrointestine-Compound-Target) networks were built from these three pathogenic factors. a typical symptom of FD is the inflammation of GI tract, i.e., gastroenteritis, which is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. PTGS1 and PTGS2, two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, are the anti-inflammation targets of most NSAIDs. their anti-inflammatory function is closely related to the production of PGE2. PTGS1 and PTGS2 enhance PGE2\u2019s level, and thus their inhibition always leads to the inhibition of PGE2\u2019s production. PTGS1\u2019s inhibition influences all cells of GI tract; whereas PTGS2\u2019s inhibition only affects inflammatory cells. however, the inhibition of PTGS2 only results in preferable anti-inflammatory effects, with no bad impacts on the GI mucosa detected. GHX01 also interacts with other targets that are tightly implicated in inflammatory gastrointestine, i.e., PTGS2, PRSS1, GSK3B, MAPK14, PPARG, NOS2 and ESR2. the interactions between these targets and PTGS1 may relieve gastroenteritis and counteract possible adverse effects. steroid receptors like ESRs and AR are key anti-inflammation targets in the treatment of GI disorders. in a word, steroid receptors like ESRs and AR are key anti-inflammation targets in the treatment of GI disorders. the immune protection function of FD is the invasion of viruses and bacteria. autophagy is induced against all harmful pathogens, among which H. pylori is a typical pathogenic factor of stomach and intestine. it adheres to mucosal epithelial cells and stimulates the gastric mucosa to produce inflammatory factors. a major pathological cause of FD is the immune disorder caused by the invasion of harmful bacterium, therefore anti-bacterium is one effective means against GI disorders. autophagy activation is a catabolic process which degrades excrescent and impaired organelles, cytosolic proteins, and invasive microbes. autophagy is crucial for the inhibition of the growth of various pathogens and the enhancement of human immunity in the treatment of GI diseases. GHX01, GHX06, GHX07, HP01, and HP02 all possess proper anti-bacterium activities. four of them, including GSK3B, NOS2, NOS3, have been proven capable of inducing the initiation of autophagy. the regulation of GSK3B may protect host cells from H. pylori\u2019s infection. factually, GSK3B\u2019s inactivation suppressed the H. pylori-induced pernicious biological activities. NO is closely related to human immune system that it induces or suppresses apoptosis as a toxic or immune regulatory media. heat wet cold belongs to categories of upper respiratory tract infection and influenza. the upper respiratory tract infection is induced by viral and bacterial infections that certain viruses, like rhinovirus, adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus, coxsackie virus (CVB3) and coronavirus, often lead to viral upper respiratory tract infection. the extract of Jun herb GHX, patchouli oil, has proper antiviral effects both in vivo and in vitro. the gastrointestinal motility regulation function Poor digestion is a main symptom of FD. presently a gas-C-T network was constructed using all 19 GI motility-related targets. the edges represent the mutual relations between the targets and chemicals. ESR1 and ESR2 are involved in the mediation of colonic motility. er type in intestinal tract inhibits K+ currents of intestines smooth muscle cells. adrenoceptor agonists are involved in the regulation of GI motility. in smooth muscle, CHRM3 receptor mediates the phosphoinositide hydrolysis. the other 9 molecules may also possess potentials in participating in the regulation of GI motility. vagal afferents are a kind of nerves that are extensively distributed in digestive tract from esophagus to colon. they are often implicated in the flex control of the secretion and motility function of GI tract, and thus reflex FD. these targets exert considerable influence on the regulation of GI motility. a dense distribution of GABAB receptor agonists, like baclofen, reduce the triggering of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and thereby inhibit the gastroesophageal reflux in human body. the modulation of GI activity through regulating enteric nerves is an important factor for HXZQ contributing to the treatment of GI diseases. in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, K+ channel activation is capable of reducing propulsive motor activity by relaxing both the circular muscle and the taenia coli. CP03 regulates jejuna contractility through the modulation of enteric nervous system, that is, it reflexes the high-contracting GI smooth muscle while exciting the low-contracting one. FD treatment is mostly related to four pathways in mechanism, i.e., PI3K-Akt, TLRs, JAK-STAT and calcium signaling pathways. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway negatively modulates LPS-induced acute inflammatory responses. inhibition enhances the activation of NF-B, AP-1, and Egr-1 transcription factors. 9 targets are involved in PI3K-Akt pathway as important regulator of immune system. this includes CHRM1, CHRM2, KDR, PIK3CG, HSP90AA1, GSK3B, NOS3, RXRA, and CDK2. the key roles of all proteins (except GSK3B) as anti-inflammation and immune regulation targets have already been discussed previously. PIK3CG and PIMI participate in regulation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. PIM1 kinase, expressed in human eosinophils, also contributes to the survival of T cells in immune cells. the third pathway involves TLRs signaling pathway. GHX06 exerts its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting TLRs signaling. this all indicates that the regulation of TLRs signaling pathway incorporating targets GSK3B, MAPK14, and PIK3CG is also a reason for curative effects of HXZQ on FD treatment. calcium signaling pathway, the fourth signaling path, is also key for its close association with the treatment of GI motility insufficiency. calcium signaling pathway is critical FD-related pathway in regulation of GI motility. cross-talk often exists which links various pathways into an adaptable complex network. PIK3CG (PIK) is expressed in leukocytes, and presents at low concentration in smooth muscle cells. calcium signaling pathway is mainly involved in learning or memory, as well as the contraction or relaxation of GI smooth muscle. the inhibitory efficiency of a ligand is closely associated with the number and strength of its binding forces with its receptor. the ligand has a unique array of pharmacological actions including the inhibition of multiple autonomic responses. GC08 is reported to exhibit great anti-GI bacteria action even at 10 g/ml. binding pattern explains why GC08 has such great biological activities. the binding of CP03 and PTGS2 explains CP03\u2019s suppressing inflammation effects on GI system. the complex PTGS2-GHX06 is stabilized by three H-bonds including the \u2013OH groups with Gln423 (3.80 ), asn351 (2.46 ) and Thr175 (2.69. several compounds have relatively low pharmacokinetic values. but they are either the richest ingredients of the herbs, like magnolol (HP01) and honokiol (HP02), or biologically active, thus are also considered as candidate components. beta-sitosterol is the mutual ingredient of five herbs in HXZQ formula. it is used in modulation of immune system, as well as the prevention of cancer or heart diseases. flavonoids and terpenoids are widely accumulated in medicinal plants. GHX06 has also analgesic effects through inhibiting the nociceptive neurotransmission. a continuous daily administration of GHX06 at 100 mg/kg for 14 days attenuated the hyperalgesia of model rats in the long-term pain treatment trails. flavonoids, the main ingredients of HXZQ, should be the major molecular bioactivities basis of this formula. terpenoids are also important active substance of HXZQ. many plant sterols have inhibitory functions for the growth of tumors. alkaloids also one kind of effective component of TCM. Lipinski\u2019s rule of five is a rule of thumb to evaluate the DL or determine if a compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has chemical and physical properties to make it a likely orally active drug in humans. the specific content of this rule is, in general, an orally active drug has no more than one violation of the following criteria: possessing (1) no more than 5 hydrogen bond donors; (2) no more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors; (3) a molecular weight less nCIC, TPSA, and drugBank one have fewer hydrophilic molecules. the compounds in herbal formula are more likely to permeate the membrane and be absorbed by human body. in a word, the herbal chemicals are characterized by large number of aromatic components. most famous one is the ancient Chinese theory of \u201cJun-Chen-Zuo-Shi\u201d. a salutary meat burger is drawn, where the meat, bread, vegetables and cream correspond to Jun, Chen, Zuo, and Shi. the combination rules of HXZQ herbs based on the TCM \u201cJun-Chen-Zuo-Shi\u201d theory can be scientifically interpreted as herbs playing different roles. Jun drug is the most essential herb/herb in a TCM prescription. it promotes curative effects of Jun drug or is responsible for treating accompanying symptoms. Shi drug is generally used in low dose, with aim to induce the herbs\u2019 impact to the disease location and modulate the interaction among the herbs. GHX, belonging to Lamiaceae family, is the dried aerial part of a famous herb called Guanghuoxiang. it regulates the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, accelerates the secretion of digestive juice and protects the intestinal barrier function. GHX contains 94 ingredients, where 7 compounds are identified as candidate compounds. GHX05 potently inhibits the inflammatory response through decreasing those inflammatory mediators including TNF-, IL-1, and NO in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. GHX is the most abundant herb in HXZQ, which may also account for its prominent roles in the formula. BZ has strong antipyretic, analgesic, antiasthmatic, antispasmodic and antibiosis effects. one BZ active ingredient, coumarin (BZ04), remedied the pain caused by glacial acetic acid in rats and intestinal smooth muscle spasm caused by BaCl2 in rabbits. a saturated monoterpene exerts various bioactivities including inhibiting cyclooxygenase pathway, suppressing the arachidonic acid metabolism or cytokine production. beta-sitosterol, another potent bioactive molecule, widely distributes in various botanicals with blood cholesterol lowering effects. GC regulates CYP450 enzymes which are primary phase I isoenzymes in liver responsible for the metabolism of almost all drugs and toxins. GC also regulates the function of certain transporters like p-glycoprotein which is an important protein of the cell membrane that pumps many foreign substances out of cells. also regulates the function of certain transporters like p-glycoprotein which is an important protein of the cell membrane that pumps many foreign substances out of cells. GC is assumed as Shi drug to coordinate other herbs as well as an antidote agent in HXZQ formula. the association of many of them with FD treatment has been validated, like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), nitric oxide synthase, prostaglandin G/H synthase (PTGS2) and glycogen synthase 3 beta (GSK3B) betweenness reflects the fraction of the shortest paths in the network that pass through any particular node. this measurement favors the nodes that act as connecting links between dense subnetworks, rather than nodes that lie inside a subnetwork. this measurement favors the nodes that act as a hub in a network. cavidine (BX02), 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone (GC13) and medicarpin (GC11) are the top three. their crucial bioactivities for remedying FD have been experimental validated. the average degree of candidate compounds is as big as 10.7. a typical symptom of FD is the inflammation of GI tract, i.e., gastroenteritis, which is a common disease characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. a typical symptom of FD is the inflammation of GI tract, i.e., gastroenteritis, which is a common disease characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. hexagons and circles represent all inflammation-related targets and corresponding candidate compounds, respectively. the calculated average degree of these inflammatory targets is 48, larger than the average degree of all targets of the formula (30), indicating that anti-inflammatory function may account for the main curative effects of the formula. inhibition always leads to the inhibition of PGE2\u2019s production. PTGS1 is not detectable in normal GI cells, but only expressed in inflammatory cells. inhibition of PTGS2 only results in preferable anti-inflammatory effects. genkwanin (GHX01), as an active component in HXZQ, targets both PTGS1 and PTGS2. GHX01 potently decreases the level of proinflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6. GHX01 also interacts with other targets that are tightly implicated in inflammatory gastrointestine. lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and cellular differentiation are key steroid receptors in vivo. in GI inflammatory diseases, ER receptors bring favorable anti-inflammation activities by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokine. in a word, steroid receptors like ESRs and AR are key anti-inflammation targets in the treatment of GI disorders. the immune protection function One important cause of FD is the invasion of viruses and bacteria, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia lamblia, norovirus, and H. pylori. on one hand HXZQ enhances the immunity of patients and inhibits certain bacteria which may induce FD. on the other hand, HXZQ also up-regulates CD4+ to the normal content range a major pathological cause of FD is the immune disorder caused by the invasion of harmful bacterium. autophagy activation is a catabolic process which degrades excrescent and impaired organelles, cytosolic proteins, and invasive microbes. autophagy is involved in many essential processes in the innate and adaptive immune responses. GHX05, another active ingredient, protects the gastric epithelial cells from the urease injury induced by H. pylori. a few targets of HXZQ in Imm-C-T network are also observed getting involved in autophagy or anti-H. pylori processes. pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B in TLR4-stimulated macrophages may increase IFN- production. the regulation of GSK3B may protect host cells from H. pylori\u2019s infection. 84 molecules act on NOS2 and NOS3, indicating that HXZQ tends to produce sustainable and large concentration of NO to exert therapeutic effects on FD. regulating the production of NO to modulate the immune system through NOS2 and NOS3 targets should also account for the immune regulation function of HXZQ. patchouli alcohol exerts anti-adenovirus activity through interacting with Hexon, a target responsible for translating the capsid protein of adenovirus. all these results demonstrate that anti-virus is an important mechanism of HXZQ for the treatment of heat wet cold. three targets, ESR1, ESR2 and ACHE receptors, outstand due to their high connection degree. ER subtypes are detected in reproductive systems like mammary gland, uterus, ovary and prostate. ER subtypes are also detected in GI tissues such as fundus, antrum, and duodenum. RM1 and DRD1 are five distinct subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. the principle subtypes on the sarcolemma are CHRM2 and CHRM3. the activation of CHRM2 decreases the opening times of a potassium channel activated by -adrenoceptor agonists. it is well known that GI motility is regulated by three factors, i.e., the intact immune system, the enteric nerves, as well as the smooth muscle cells. the impacts of two other factors, enteric nerves and smooth muscle cells, on GI motility are analyzed here. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., granisetron and ondansetron) have been used in the treatment of acute phase of emesis, post-operative nausea and vomiting. in gas-C-T net, molecule maackiain acts on HTR3A, indicating its potential capability of controlling GI motility through activating the vagus. in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, K+ channel activation is capable of reducing propulsive motor activity by relaxing both the circular muscle and the taenia coli. in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, K+ channel activation is capable of reducing propulsive motor activity by relaxing both the circular muscle. FD treatment is mostly related to four pathways in mechanism, i.e., PI3K-Akt, TLRs, JAK-STAT and calcium signaling pathways. PI3K, the key component of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, regulates a wide variety of cellular processes including cellular growth, migration and proliferation. Akt signaling pathway negatively modulates LPS-induced acute inflammatory responses. inhibition enhances activation of NF-B, AP-1, and Egr-1 transcription factors. this pathway is also involved in the regulation of autophagy in immune response, so as to remove bacteria from gastrointestinal infections. PIK3CG and PIMI participate in the regulation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. kinase, expressed in human eosinophils, also contributes to the survival of T cells in immune cells. the third pathway involves TLRs signaling pathway. in enteroendocrine cells, TLR expression promotes elimination of pathogens. GHX06 exerts its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting TLRs signaling. calcium signaling pathway, the fourth signaling path, is key for its close association with the treatment of GI motility insufficiency. calcium signaling pathway is critical FD-related pathway in regulation of GI motility. the active molecule BS03 (atractylenolide I) also stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration and proliferation via polyamine-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. in HXZQ formula, PIK3CG is regulated by 14 active molecules. GHX07 (Rutin) is a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway participates in the process of inflammation and immune responses. the degree and betweenness distribution of all targets and top 60 active compounds is strongly correlated with each other. among the targets, the top three degree-ranked proteins are androgen receptor (AR,), estrogen receptor (ESR1) and prostaglandin G/H synthase 2. cavidine (BX02), 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone (GC13) and medicarpin (GC11) are the top three. their crucial bioactivities for remedying FD have been experimental validated. the average degree of candidate compounds is as big as 10.7. FD is conventionally caused by three primarily physiology reasons, i.e., bacterial infection, gastroenteritis and the disturbance of gastric physiologic factors. currently three C-T networks, i.e., inf-C-T (Inflammation-Compound-Target), Imm-C-T (Immune-Compound-Target) and Gas-C-T (Gastrointestine-Compound-Target) were built from hexagons and circles represent all inflammation-related targets and corresponding candidate compounds, respectively. the calculated average degree of these inflammatory targets is 48, larger than the average degree of all targets of the formula (30) PTGS1 and PTGS2 have similar anti-inflammation bioactivities. PTGS1 is not detectable in normal GI cells, but only expressed in inflammatory cells. inhibition of PTGS2 only results in preferable anti-inflammatory effects. GHX01 has a variety of pharmacological effects including anti-bacterial, radical scavenging and anti-inflammation. GHX01 potently decreases the level of proinflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6. GHX01 also interacts with other targets tightly implicated in inflammatory gastrointestine, i.e., PTGS2, PRSS1, GSK3B, MAPK14, lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and cellular differentiation predominantly expressed in intestine. steroid receptors are key anti-inflammation targets in the treatment of GI disorders. steroid receptors like AR and ESRs are key anti-inflammation targets. the immune protection function One important cause of FD is the invasion of viruses and bacteria, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia lamblia, norovirus, and H. pylori. a bacterium capable of adapting to stomach environment and thus living in gastric mucosa, is a typical pathogenic factor of stomach and intestine. a major pathological cause of FD is the immune disorder caused by the invasion of harmful bacterium. autophagy activation is a catabolic process which degrades excrescent and impaired organelles, cytosolic proteins, and invasive microbes. a major pathological cause of FD is the immune disorder caused by the invasion of harmful bacterium. GHX05, another active ingredient, protects the gastric epithelial cells from the urease injury induced by H. pylori. it also has a wide spectrum of other biological activities, including anti-inflammation, oxidative balance regulation and the enhancement of gastric mucosa defense. pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B in TLR4-stimulated macrophages may increase IFN- production which has an important role in cell growth and differentiation. the regulation of GSK3B may protect host cells from H. pylori\u2019s infection. heat wet cold is a kind of exogenous cold disease caused by sudden wind, cold or dampness in summer, with main clinical symptoms of fever, dizziness, encephalalgia, tiredness, thirsty, chest tightness, nausea etc. heat wet cold belongs to categories of upper respiratory tract infection and influenza. the extract of GHX, patchouli oil, has been proved possessing proper antiviral effects both in vivo and in vitro. patchouli alcohol exerts anti-adenovirus activity through interacting with Hexon, a target responsible for translating the capsid protein of adenovirus. all these results demonstrate that anti-virus is an important mechanism of HXZQ for the treatment of heat wet cold. ESR1, ESR2 and ACHE receptors outstand due to their high connection degree. ER subtypes are detected in reproductive systems like mammary gland, uterus, ovary and prostate. ER subtypes are also detected in GI tissues such as fundus, antrum, and duodenum. muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are widely expressed in smooth muscle in GI tract. the principle subtypes on the sarcolemma are CHRM2 and CHRM3. the activation of CHRM2 decreases the opening times of a potassium channel activated by -adrenoceptor agonists. it is well known that GI motility is regulated by three factors, i.e., the intact immune system, the enteric nerves, as well as the smooth muscle cells. the effects of two other factors, enteric nerves and smooth muscle cells, on GI motility are analyzed here. granisetron and ondansetron have been used in the treatment of acute phase of emesis, post-operative nausea and vomiting. in gas-C-T net, molecule maackiain acts on HTR3A, indicating its potential capability of controlling GI motility through activating the vagus. i.e., KCNH2 (encoded HERG potassium channel) and SCN5A (encoded Nav1.5 sodium channel) have long been highlighted by recent studies that the activation or inhibition of K+ channels generates profound relaxations or inhibition of gastric smooth muscle. in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, K+ channel activation is capable of reducing propulsive motor activity by relaxing both the circular muscle and the taenia coli. the indirect way is related with SCN5A\u2019s inhibition, which hyperpolarizes human intestinal circular smooth muscle cells. when SCN5A is inhibited, this slow wave\u2019s rate of rise is slowed and its frequency is decreased, which finally ends up with the contraction of smooth muscles. currently, 36 active compounds act on SCN5A, similar to KCNH2, indicating that their potential therapeutic effects for FD treatment may modulate GI motility through acting on ion channels. an inf-C-T network was constructed presently by using all 25 inflammatory targets and corresponding interacting compounds of HXZQ. hexagons and circles represent all inflammation-related targets and corresponding candidate compounds, respectively. the calculated average degree of these inflammatory targets is 48, larger than the average degree of all targets of the formula (30) PTGS1 and PTGS2 enhance PGE2\u2019s level, and thus their inhibition always leads to the inhibition of PGE2\u2019s production, which finally results in anti-inflammation effects. PTGS1 is not detectable in normal GI cells, but only expressed in inflammatory cells. PTGS2\u2019s inhibition only affects inflammatory cells. interactions between the chemicals and targets of the formula may offset and reduce potential side effects due to their promiscuous properties. genkwanin (GHX01), as an active component in HXZQ, targets both PTGS1 and PTGS2. GHX01 potently decreases the level of proinflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6. in GI inflammatory diseases, ER receptors bring favorable anti-inflammation activities by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokine, such as NO, IL-1, TNF-. in a word, steroid receptors like AR are key anti-inflammation targets in the treatment of GI disorders. inflammatory function of HXZQ accounts for most of its curative effects on FD treatment. the immune protection function is one important cause of FD is the invasion of viruses and bacteria, such as salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia lamblia, norovirus, and H. pylori. a major pathological cause of FD is the immune disorder caused by the invasion of harmful bacterium, therefore anti-bacterium is one effective means against GI disorders. the autophagy activation is a catabolic process which degrades excrescent and impaired organelles, cytosolic proteins, and invasive microbes. curcumin (SJ02), a representative component of herb SJ, is a yellow pigment commonly used in food. it possesses favorable pharmacological effects like anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective and anti-tumor abilities. GHX05, another active ingredient, protects the gastric epithelial cells from the urease injury induced by H. pylori. pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B in TLR4-stimulated macrophages may increase IFN- production which has an important role in cell growth and differentiation. the regulation of GSK3B may protect host cells from H. pylori\u2019s infection. heat wet cold is a kind of exogenous cold disease caused by sudden wind, cold or dampness in summer, with main clinical symptoms of fever, dizziness, encephalalgia, tiredness, thirsty, chest tightness, nausea etc. heat wet cold belongs to categories of upper respiratory tract infection and influenza. patchouli alcohol inhibits H1N1, CVB3 and ADV with lower concentrations. patchouli alcohol exerts anti-adenovirus activity through interacting with Hexon, a target responsible for translating the capsid protein of adenovirus. three targets, ESR1, ESR2 and ACHE receptors, outstand due to their high connection degree. ER subtypes are detected in reproductive systems like mammary gland, uterus, ovary and prostate. ER subtypes are also detected in GI tissues such as fundus, antrum, and duodenum. muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are widely expressed in smooth muscle. the principle subtypes on the sarcolemma are CHRM2 and CHRM3. the activation of CHRM2 decreases the opening times of a potassium channel activated by -adrenoceptor agonists. three chemicals (BX02, GC11, and GC13) act on DRD1 receptor. it is well known that GI motility is regulated by three factors, i.e., the intact immune system, the enteric nerves, as well as the smooth muscle cells. it is well known that GI motility is regulated by three factors. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., granisetron and ondansetron) have been used in the treatment of acute phase of emesis, post-operative nausea and vomiting. presently, molecule maackiain acts on HTR3A, indicating its potential capability of controlling GI motility through activating the vagus. in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, K+ channel activation is capable of reducing propulsive motor activity by relaxing both the circular muscle and the taenia coli. in this net, 11 active compounds interact with KCNH2. this net regulates jejuna contractility through the modulation of enteric nervous system. the direct way is related with SCN5A\u2019s inhibition, which hyperpolarizes human intestinal circular smooth muscle cells. the indirect way is through an electrical slow wave which is generated by interstitial cells and tightly associated with the motility of GI tract. ion channels are essential targets responsible for regulation of human intestinal motility. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway negatively modulates LPS-induced acute inflammatory responses. factor is inhibition of NF-B, AP-1, and Egr-1 transcription factors. this pathway is also involved in the regulation of autophagy in immune response, so as to remove bacteria from gastrointestinal infections. PIK3CG and PIMI participate in regulation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. kinase, expressed in human eosinophils, also contributes to the survival of T cells in immune cells. pathogen activates TLR signaling which then results in corresponding immune responses against the GI bacteria challenge. GHX06 exerts its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting TLRs signaling. this all indicates that the regulation of TLRs signaling pathway incorporating targets GSK3B, MAPK14, and PIK3CG is also a reason for curative effects of HXZQ on FD treatment. active molecule BS03 (atractylenolide I) also stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration and proliferation via polyamine-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway. PIK3CG (PIK3CG) is expressed in leukocytes, and also presents at low concentration in smooth muscle cells. in HXZQ formula, PIK3CG is regulated by 14 active molecules. GHX07 (Rutin) is a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway participates in the process of inflammation. hydrophobic effects exist between the propyl side chain of HP02 and hydrophobic amino acid. GC08 (Maackiain) is fixed in the cavity through three H-bonds. the binding pattern explains why GC08 has such great biological activities. GHX06-GSK3B complex remains a stable conformation. CP03 is fixed the binding cavity of inflammatory target PTGS2 through three H-bonds with residues Typ356 (3.33 ), His357 (3.19 ) and Thr175 (2.69 ). CP03 and PTGS2 explains CP03\u2019s suppressing inflammation effects on GI system. HXZQ formula have multiple pharmacological functions including anti-inflammation, immune-protection and gastrointestinal motility regulation effects. the active ingredients of HXZQ formula are diverse in both species and structures, and are large in number, which greatly reduce the possibility of drug resistance. a system pharmacology approach which contains ADME screening, targets prediction, network analysis and pathway screening was used. the treatment of minor symptoms, like abdominal distension, belching, nausea and vomiting, is undertaken by BX, HP, FL, SJ, CP, BS, and DFP, as Zuo drugs. GC is employed as Shi drug because of its detoxication capacity, but also its ability in influencing the ADME properties of other herbs. lithography, molecular absorption spectrophotometry (ultraviolet), titration, etc., have been developed and applied on determination of TCM ingredients\u2019 contents. however, these methods themselves exist certain limits which make the determination of all TCM components almost impossible.
