{"summary": "the domestic cat is the consequence of a remarkable domestication experiment. the wildcats fed and clothed many more people than hunters could support. the major benefit of cat domestication appears to be human companionship, but this role is rapidly expanding to encompass issues in human health. feline calicivirus, feline herpes virus, feline foamy virus and panleukopenia parvovirus provide a panoply of infectious disease models for many devastating human diseases. cat species provide a panoply of infectious disease models for many devastating human diseases. tenets have been revised and amended due to new insights from genetic studies of cat populations. Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) pathogenesis in domestic cats Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, progressive, and immune-augmented disease of cats caused by infection with feline coronavirus. coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped, single stranded, positive sense, non-segmented RNA viruses. there is no effective treatment, vaccine, or a diagnostic protocol that can discriminate the avirulent FECV from the pathogenic FIP strains. the precise nature of the mutation responsible for pathogenesis has never been identified. brown et al. [43] inspected the phylogenetic clustering of four FCoV genes in 56 cats (8 FIP and 46 healthy) from Maryland catteries. the results were definitive in clustering the virus from sick FIPV cats together in a monophyletic group, quite distinctive from the FCoV derived from the healthy cats. a circulating pathogenic virus would have accumulated mutations over time to drift apart from the avirulent FCoV strain. a recent study documented paraphyly (mixing) of FIP and healthy FCoV infected cat strains in the world. current evidence would suggest that FIP etiology is more complex than either hypothesis alone would suggest. phylogenetic tree of cloned feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) membrane sequences (655 bp) from 19 healthy (feline enteric coronavirus); green) and 8 symptomatic (feline infectious peritonitis virus FIPV; red) cats. one cat, Fca-4590, was sampled when healthy and then at death caused by FIP. phylogenetic analysis of individual FIV-isolates in a dozen or more species of felids [7,58,59,60,61] demonstrates reciprocal monophyly of FIV among various species. these events are exceedingly rare, leading to a monophyletic expansion of viral genome sequence diversity within every species. yagouaroundi Jaguarundi 9/40 1/8 [7,78] Acinonyx jubatus Cheetah 22/303 7/10 6/242 [7,75,79,80] Lynx pardinus Iberian lynx 7/74 0/75 [7,81] L. lynx Eurasian lynx 0/10 [7,75] L. canadensis Canada lynx 0/92 a leo Lion 212/321 72/132 1/1 [7,75,80,84,85,86] P. onca Jaguar 0/2 8/42 0/7 [7,75,78] P. pardus Leopard 7/10 1/96 0/1 [7,75,78] P. tigris Tiger 7/10 1/96 0/1 [7,75,78] P. pardus Leopard 7/10 1/96 0/1 [7,75] Neofelis n a marked depletion of CD4 bearing T lymphocytes was apparent in FIV infected lions, a prelude to immune collapse in well defined AIDS. spleen and lymph node biopsies from nine free ranging lions revealed evidence of lymphoid depletion. the findings strongly suggest FIV is contributing to the loss of immune competence in these lions. lions harbor six genetically distinct strains, or subtypes, of lion FIV (FIVPle) resolved by phylogenetic analyses [57,58]. these strains have distinct phylogeographic distributions, suggesting prolonged host association, perhaps predating the Late-Pleistocene expansion of lions roughly 325,000 years ago. VPle A and C carrying individuals actually altered FIV strain incidence causing a rise in FIVPle B and a drop in FIVPle C during the course of the CDV outbreak. medical conditions present in FIVPle infected wild lions compared with FIVPle negative lions. lions that were alive at the beginning of the CDV outbreak were sampled either prior to April 1994, during the month of April 1994, or after April 1994. most of the 1994 sampling occurred either in April after the peak mortality (approximate time shown as grey bar) the statistical rigor associated with these conclusions is rather weak since the number of lions was limited (total = 119 lions) FeLV Outbreak in Free Ranging Florida Pumas Feline leukemia virus displays a prevalence of 1\u20138% among feral cats worldwide. Mortality among persistently infected domestic cats is high as 83% die within 3.5 years. Florida panther is an endangered subspecies whose range was contiguous with other puma populations. in 1995, a Florida panther restoration management action relocated eight Texas cougars (Puma concolor coryi) to the Florida habitat in a hopeful rescue of the threatened subspecies. the population rebounded to over 100 individuals, doubling panther numbers, density, survival parameters and fitness. f. bieti obtained infectious FeLV gene sequence (LTR and env genes; 2851 bp) from several FeLV-infected Florida panthers. a vaccination campaign was initiated in 2006 and 52 Florida panthers were captured and vaccinated with no major FeLV incidence reported. 13 of 17 panthers tested during 2004\u20132005 in the FeLV-endemic region (76%; Figure 1) were FIV positive. this apparent elevation in FIV incidence among FeLV afflicted panthers raises the possibility of a role for FIV-mediated immune depletion in FeLV pathogenesis. in domestic cats, FIV and FeLV co-infections have resulted in conflicting interpretations. FIV in wild african lions, once considered benign, is causally linked with AIDS-related symptoms in some individuals. some strains may increase susceptibility to co-infection and mortality."}
