{"summary": "some of the worst haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in humans, great apes and nonhuman primates have been caused by Ebola viruses (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) these enveloped filamentous single-stranded RNA viruses belong to the family Filoviridae. the only EBOV species found outside of africa is Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) experimental ZEBOV and REBOV in pigs seem to target the respiratory system but only the former induces overt clinical disease [5], [6]. pigs could transmit virus to contact animals. the aim of the current report was to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the cellular infiltration into the lungs. we aimed to characterize the cellular infiltrates into the lungs using cell type-specific surface markers, also permitting the definitive identification of the cells harbouring ZEBOV antigen. two pigs were euthanized at 3, 5 and 7 days post inoculation. tissues collected for virus isolation and pathology. six pigs of same age group and source as in experiment 1 were acclimatized and inoculated. Enteroviral armoured RNA (Asuragen, Austin, Tx., U.S.A.) was used as an exogenous extraction/reaction control. a standard curve generated by serial 10 fold dilutions of EBOV L-gene plasmid was included for every run. Clone Mac 387 (Dako, USA) was applied for 10 minutes at a dilution of 1400. it was visualised using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelled polymer, Envision\u00ae+system (anti-mouse) and reacted with DAB. epitopes were then visualized using a HRP labelled polymer, Envision\u00ae+system (anti-rabbit) and reacted with 3,3\u2032-Dia Clone Mac 387 was applied for 10 minutes at a dilution of 1100. an AP-polymer kit, Mach 4 Universal (BioCare Medical, CA) was applied for 30 minutes. all sections were counterstained with Gill\u2019s hematoxylin. PBMCs were isolated from citrated blood collected from pigs in experiment 2. plasma collected into cryovials washed twice in PBS and used for flow cytometry. antibodies against porcine surface markers CD3 FITC, CD21 PE, CD14 FITC, CD172a PE and the corresponding isotype controls were used. plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) was quantified using the porcine IL-6 DuoSet (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. cytokine mRNA changes in PBMCs collected from pigs in experiment 2 were measured by semi quantitative real time RT-PCR. monocytes, B cells and T cells were exposed to ZEBOV by incubating 5105 cells with 0.1 MOI of virus in RPMI for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed, resuspended in complete medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h the supernatant was removed and cells permeabilized using BD cytoperm/cytofix. rabbit polyclonal anti-EBOV IgG was added to bind ZEBOV antigen. this reaction was detected by adding peroxidase-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG followed by ABTS substrate. the average OD405 for negative control antigen was subtracted from the corresponding ZEBOV antigen to obtain the adjusted OD405 for each serum sample. six pigs were given inhalation anaesthesia and then inoculated with 106 PFU of ZEBOV. two control pigs were mock inoculated with PBS and housed separately. two pigs were euthanized at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection respectively. pigs were negative for PRRSV and porcine circovirus -2 (PCV-2). pigs were inoculated with 106 PFU of ZEBOV in sterile PBS per pig. two control pigs were mock inoculated with PBS and housed separately. necropsy, blood and swabs were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) targeting the EBOV L-gene. total RNA was extracted from tissues and swabs using a bead mill homogenizer. ZEBOV VP40 were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections as previously described [6] for epitope retrieval, slides were treated with high pH AR10 (BioGenex, CA) in a bioCare Medical decloaking chamber. to identify the presence of T lymphocytes, epitopes were retrieved using glyca solution (BioGenex, CA) and then a polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD3 (Dako, tissues were pretreated with proteinase K for 10 minutes. the VP40 antibody was applied to the sections as previously described. the sections were incubated with a denaturing solution for 5 minutes. probes with at least 1 out of 16 samples having values between 20 and 100 percentile in the raw data were retained for further analysis. data with corrected p0.05 and any pair (infected lungs vs control) with fold changes > 2 were considered significant. at least 25,000 events were acquired per sample and data analysed with the CXP analysis software (Beckman Coulter) plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) was quantified using porcine IL-6 DuoSet (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. non-adherent cells were removed, adherent monocytes washed twice with sterile PBS. harvested by incubating with TrypLETM (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed, resuspended in complete medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C. a rabbit polyclonal anti-EBOV IgG was added to bind to captured antigen-specific IgM. this reaction was detected by adding peroxidase-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG. the average OD405 for negative control antigen was subtracted from that of the corresponding ZEBOV antigen to obtain the adjusted OD405 for each serum sample. ral RNA was detected by rRT-PCR in oral swabs from all pigs beginning on DPI 1 (2 pigs), DPI 3 and 5 (4 pigs) only 2 pigs had detectable viremia based on RNA detection on DPI 5 (1 pig) and DPI 6 (1 pig) viral RNA was detected in submandibular lymph nodes of all pigs and in bronchial lymph nodes, lungs and trachea of all but one pig. no viral RNA was detected in muscle and only one pig had virus RNA in the mesenteric lymph nodes. data represents log10 copies/mL of tissue suspension. SLN, submandibular lymph node; BLN, bronchial lymph node; MLN, mesenteric lymph nodes, U, virus was either absent or below levels detectable by the current assay. pneumonia was distributed primarily in the dorso-caudal lobes and was characterized by consolidation and haemorrhage. 3 showed that the presence of T lymphocytes was limited to bronchiolar submucosa and peribronchiolar areas and represented only a small proportion of the inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs. Immunostaining for CD79a showed only few scattered B-lymphocytes throughout the section. microarray data found in gene expression Omnibus database in NCBI. changes in gene expression in lung sections from infected pigs were minimal at DPI 3. anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in activation and recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection were up-regulated starting on DPI 3. gene Description Fold change Function DPI 3 DPI 5 DPI 7 IL-6 Interleukin- 6 2 41 23 Recruitment of inflammatory cells; induction of acute phase proteins IL-8 Interleukin-8 8 106 45 IL-22 Interleukin-26 1 59 30 IL-5 Interleukin- 5 3 4 5 Attracts eosinophils IL-26 Interleukin-26 1 10 5 Mucosal & cutaneous immunity IL-27 Inter PI 3 DPI 5 DPI 7 CCL2 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 1 29 32 Chemoattractant for immune cells CCL3L1 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3like 1 2 21 22 CCL4 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 2 33 28 CCL10 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 10 10 109 211 CCL19 Chemokine (C associated factor 3 2 6 7 TNIP3 TNFAIP3 interacting protein 3 isoform 3 3 10 14 AIF1 Allograft inflammatory factor 1 1 3 3 Data was obtained by microarray analysis of RNA from pigs infected with Zaire ebolavirus in experiment 1. numbers represent fold change in transcription relative to tissues from uninfected controls.

CD21+ B cells decreased in frequency from DPI 1\u20136. there was no effect on CD3+ T cell frequencies in PBMCs. kine Response Systemic cytokine response in ZEBOV-infected pigs in experiment 2 was measured by both ELISA and qRT-PCR. Pigs responded to ZEBOV infection by secreting IFN- and IL-6 in blood starting at DPI 3. peak levels of IFN- were attained on DPI 6 (p0.05 relative to baseline levels) but the IL-6 response did not reach statistical significance. data for individual animals is presented as adjusted OD405 obtained by subtracting the OD405 of a negative antigen from that of the ZEBOV antigen. the horizontal broken line represents the cut-off OD405 value defined as mean +3 standard deviation of negative control sera. clinical signs in pigs in experiment 1 and 2 were as previously described [6]. 8 U U U U 3.91 (0.0002) 3.6 (0.21) U U 4.8 (0.007) U 3.7 (0.12) 3.94 (0.0) Pig 9 U U U U U 4 (0.163) 4.1 (0.021) 4.3 (0.012) U U U Pig 11 U U 2.4 (0.057) 4.15 (0.029) U U Pig 12 U 3.86 (0.0005 U 4.5 (0.0) 3.4 (0.021) U, virus was either absent or below levels detectable by the current assay pigs were infected with Zaire ebolavirus in experiment 2. the pneumonia was distributed primarily in the dorso-caudal lobes. there was inflammation and necrosis in the bronchial lymph nodes and mild tracheitis. 80% of the inflammatory cells in the lungs showed positive immunostaining using Clone Mac387 macrophage and neutrophil marker. a previously unreported feature was the presence of numerous multinucleated cells within alveoli. a previously unreported feature was the presence of numerous multinucleated cells within alveoli. double immunolabelling detected simultaneous expression of mac387 macrophage marker (pink) and ZEBOV antigen (brown, arrows) within the same cell indicating the presence of viral antigen within macrophages. bar = 10 m. Numerous multinucleated syncytial cells were observed within alveolar spaces. mRNA for the acute phase protein, SAA, was also up-regulated in the lungs of ZEBOV-infected pigs. the transcriptome for molecules involved in the apoptosis pathway was also up-regulated in the lungs of ZEBOV-infected pigs. cell adhesion and trafficking RETN Resistin 1 248 185 Proinflammatory by inducing TNF- & IL-12 from macrophages PLUNC palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated 66 496 273 Airway inflammation, innate immunity IL-10 Interleukin-10 2 20 18 Anti inflammatory Data was obtained by microarray analysis of RNA from pigs infected with Zaire ebolavirus in experiment 1.
