{"summary": "acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is characterized by changes in sputum production, dyspnoea, and cough. acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by changes in sputum production, dyspnoea, and cough. patients were recruited within 4\u201312 h after presentation. all patients were diagnosed with COPD according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria. eosin methylene blue agar, blood agar, Brucella agar, and chocolate agar media were excluded. participants whose samples were identified as having bacterial infection or bacterial-viral coinfection were excluded. nebulized 0.9% saline for 30 seconds [15]. RT-PCR (ABI AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit) to detect influenza A and B. RT-PCR (Super Script\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum\u00ae Taq DNA Polymerase and Platinum PCR Super Mix, Invitrogen) to detect parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus (Ev71) 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the difference between the two groups was analyzed by Chi-square test. 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 12 healthy, never-smoking, nonatopic, similar-aged volunteers with no history of respiratory disease underwent sputum induction and lung function assessment. all of them accepted routine check-ups and showed no clinical symptoms of inflammatory diseases. all sputum was processed within 2 h. a minimum of 200 L sample was transferred to a test tube. the samples were then filtered and centrifuged for 10 minutes. parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus (Ev71) participants were divided into virus positive AECOPD participants, bacteria positive AECOPD participants, virus-bacteria negative AECOPD participants, coinfection (CI) participants. 40%) 18 (70%) 5 (33%) Symptoms at entry Fever 3 (15%) 10 (38%) 6 (40%) Sore throat 4 (20%) 12 (46%) 7 (46%) Runny or congested nose 9 (45%) 17 (65%) 9 (60%) Discolored sputum 8 (40%) 16 (62%) 8 (53%) Treatment Oxygen therapy 2 (10%) 3 (12%) 3 (20%) Antibiotic therapy 11 (55%) 15 (58%) 8 (53%) Corticoster n (%) 11 (11%) COPD severity as per GOLD n (%) GOLD I (mild) 4 (4%) GOLD II (moderate) 39 (39%) GOLD III (severe) 52 (52%) GOLD IV (very severe) 5 (5%) 3.2. Detection of Respiratory Viruses and Bacteria The most common virus was influenza A (10 cases, 10%) correlations between Viral Infection and Clinical Symptoms Baseline characteristics and treatment of the recruited patients are shown in Table 3 according to whether they are VP, VN, or CI. VP participants more frequently had a fever (38% versus 15%, p 0.05) and sore throat (46% versus 20%, p 0.05) CI participants had the highest rate of fever (40%) and sore throat (46%) the differences in the levels of IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 between VN and HC were not significant (p > 0.05) the levels of these three markers showed no difference between VP and CI (p > 0.05) no VP were observed in may and July, and no VP were observed in March, April, May, and July. the number of AECOPD was larger than that in summer and autumn. moraxella catarrhalis 4 (4%) Staphylococcus aureus 4 (4%) Other bacteria 3 (3%) Rhinovirus + S. pneumoniae 6 (6%) Rhinovirus + H. influenzae 5 (5%) Rhinovirus + Pseudomonas spp. 3 (3%) Adenovirus + S. pneumoniae 1 (1%) Figure 2. Monthly distribution of viruses detected by multiplex PCR and RT-PCR. the percentages of VP participants that received treatments showed no difference when compared with that of VN participants (p > 0.05). the levels of IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 in VP and CI were higher than those in HC (p 0.01) and overexpression of IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1 was also observed between VP and VN (p > 0.05). influenza A was the most common respiratory virus in our study. this is consistent with a finding in which the most common virus identified was influenza A (31%) in 2069 tested virus positive nasopharyngeal aspirate samples between august 2014 and July 2015 in Australia [16]. this contrasts with other reports. asopharyngeal samples of 81 participants admitted for AECOPD [22] were inconsistent with our findings. the reason why RSV was not observed in our investigation remains elusive. viral symptoms include increased rhinorrhoea, sore throat, and fever/chills. higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF- may be associated with the activation of macrophages. inflammatory markers may be induced by viral inflammation and activation of macrophages. this could provide support for further investigation in the pathogenesis of viral AECOPD. viral AECOPD is associated with a systemic immune response. it involves IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1, suggesting a prominent role for macrophage activation in AECOPD. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
