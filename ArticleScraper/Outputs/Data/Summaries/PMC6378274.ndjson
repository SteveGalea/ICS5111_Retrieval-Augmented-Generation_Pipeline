LAB-probiotics belong to Lactobacillus (Lb.), Pediococcus (Ped.), Lactococcus (Lc.), Enterococcus (Ent.), pathogenic or zoonotic bacteria in food-animal farming are Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio anguillarum, Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas spp. and Edwardsiella spp. production of inhibitory compounds The LAB can produce a wide range of inhibitory compounds to reduce pathogens invasion. these include AMPs such as bacteriocins, organic acids, ethanol, diacetyl, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide (Liao and Nyachoti, 2017). mesenteroides 406 Lc. lactis subsp. lactis CECT-4434 L. monocytogenes L. monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Wong et al., 2017; Arakawa et al., 2016; Singh, 2018 Reuterin Lb. reuteri DSM 20016 Gram-positive (Clostridium and Staphylococcus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia LAB-bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized AMPs produced by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. LAB-bacteriocins are emerging as a novel wave of antibiotics with potent in vitro and in vivo activities. s are known to exert either bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity toward sensitive organisms. their modes of action have been widely but not thoroughly investigated. LAB are producing lacticin 3147 and nisin KA-farnesol. LAB metabolically known as hetero-fermentative species can concomitantly produce other end-products such as acetic acid. organic acids act by reducing intracellular pH and inhibiting the active transport of excess internal protons which requires cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption leading to cellular energy depletion. diacetyl interferes with arginine utilization by reacting with the arginine-binding protein of Gram-negative bacteria. some species of LAB are able to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and can inhibit pathogenic bacteria devoid of catalase. competitive exclusion (CE) can occur after addition of any culture containing at least one non-pathogenic bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract of animals. this will decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria, through direct or indirect competition for nutrients and adhesion for sites in the gut. pathogens are not able to adhere to the intestinal mucosa, which blocks the development of their population by the constant flow of digesta. L of Lb. pentosus HC-2 strongly inhibited the growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the intestine of shrimp. innate immune system induces immediate defense against infection, but also activates a long-lasting adaptive immunity. innate immune system induces immediate defense against infection, but also activates a long-lasting adaptive immunity. probiotic strains have been shown to have beneficial effects related to the nutritional function of the intestinal epithelium (Lebeer et al., 2008) they also improve intestinal barrier function by stimulating: (i) increased immune responses, (iii) improved expression and/or localization of tight junction proteins. natural Killer (NK) cells produce cytokines such as interferon (IFN-) and various interleukins (IL): IL-10, IL-3, etc. the combination at 1 107 CFU each/g feed pellet of Lc. lactis BFE920 and Lb. plantarum FGL0001 induced IL-8 and IL-6 increase in Streptococcus iniae-infected Japanese flounder fish. administration of 1 109 CFU/kg of lamina propria CD3+ CD4+ CD8- T cells increased production of CD4+, CD8+, and TCR1+ T cell in GI tract. administration of 1010 CFU/mL of lactobacillus spp. could effectively activate the immunity of mucosa in chickens by increasing levels of IgA and IgG. LAB-probiotics can indirectly modify the gut microsystem (FAO, 2016) by helping in the assimilation of nutrients through activation of the host immune cells and increasing the number of antibodies leading to animal welfare improvement.
