{"summary": "as of 26 December 2014, a total of 941 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, resulting in at least 347 deaths. however, no vaccine or effective treatment options exist to prevent a potential MERS-CoV pandemic. vaccination with recombinant S protein has been shown to induce potent neutralizing antibodies capable of inhibiting infection. more than 50 types of human adenoviruses are classified into seven distinct species (A\u2013G), each with a different set of tissue-specific tropisms. adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad41 have been tested for use in intramuscular (i.m.) immunizations and in DNA-rAd vaccine regimens. two adenovirus vectors were used to immunize mice via different routes of delivery. replication-deficient Ad5 and Ad41 expressing the MERS-CoV S protein were used to immunize mice via different routes of delivery. mice were purchased from the Animal Care Centre of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China) pSh5\u2013MERS-S was linearized with PmeI, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and co-transformed with pAdEasy-1 into E. coli BJ5183 by electroporation to generate the rAd type 5 (HAdV-5) plasmid pAd5\u2013MERS-S. pSh41\u2013MERS-S was linearized with PacI then transfected into hek293 cells grown to the log phase were infected with Ad41-MERS-S or Ad5-MERS-S at a multiplicity of infection of 100 or 10 virus particles/cell. total proteins were extracted and resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE. the serial dilution range of sampling for the SIgA detection is more than 200-fold. the sera and other tissues were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0 for 30 min before the detection of MERS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific and neutralizing antibodies. serially diluted mouse sera were added to 96-well microtitre plates. bound antibodies were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1 : 5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) 96-well plates were coated with 100 l/well of 5 mg/ml anti-mouse IFN- antibodies. they were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 in a humidified chamber. the plates were blocked for 2 hr at room temperature. splenocytes (5 105 per well) of eight mice in each group were distributed in 96-well plates. the concentrations of cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-), IL-17A and IFN-, were measured using a mouse. the codon-optimized S gene (MERS-S) was cloned to generate pVRC\u2013MERS-S. this was then digested with BglII, blunt-ended, and digested again. the fragment was purified from an agarose gel and inserted into the KpnI/EcoRV sites of pShuttle\u2013cytomegalovirus. recombinant virus was rescued and amplified in 293TE32 cells. mice were randomly distributed to nine groups (n = 10 per group) and vaccinated with different recombinant viruses by different routes. half of the mice were killed 4 weeks after immunization. lung lavage samples were collected by perfusing and draining the circulatory system with 1 ml of PBS. small intestine and large intestine were collected in 2 ml of PBS, homogenized and centrifuged, with the result supernatant used for analysis. HAd5V-MERS-S i.m. 1 109 10 I (Ad5S i.g.) HAd5V-MERS-S i.m. 1 109 10 i.g., intragastric; i.m., intramuscular; vp., virus particles. dose of Ad41-based vaccine is fivefold that of Ad5-based vaccine. system.22,23 Serum samples were serially diluted twofold in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr after the addition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus to each well. resulting mixtures were transferred to duplicate wells containing confluent Huh7 cells. blots were developed by the addition of 3-amino-9-ethycarbazole substrate solution. the plates were incubated for 5 min, after which IFN- spot-forming cells could be counted. the negative control group received no stimuli. adenovirus vectors were constructed by the homogeneous recombination of shuttle and backbone plasmids in Escherichia coli. adenovirus vectors were rescued, amplified and purified using traditional methods. the expression of MERS-S in Ad41-MERS-S-infected or Ad5-MERS-S-infected cells was detected by Western blotting. a cytomegalovirus promoter and simian virus 40 polyA tail were used to control target gene expression. hek293 cells were infected for 48 hr. total proteins were then extracted and resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE. both the Ad5-MERS-S and Ad41-MERS-S viruses induced strong RBD-specific IgG antibody responses 4 weeks (short term) after vaccination. no significant difference was seen in the IgG titres of mice vaccinated intramuscularly with either Ad5-MERS-S or Ad41-MERS-S (P > 005) MERS-S-specific IgG titres induced in the Ad41-MERS-S i.m. and the Ad5-MERS-S i.g. and i.m. vaccination groups were significant. however, the differences between these three groups were not significant. neutralizing titres were defined as the dilution at which the relative inhibition rate was 90%. the data are presented as means standard error of the mean. mice were killed 16 weeks after vaccination and analysed as above. at 4 weeks post-immunization, i.m. Ad5-MERS-S and i.m. Ad41-MERS-S vaccination induced significant IFN--secreting T-cell responses. response was substantially stronger in mice vaccinated intramuscularly compared with those vaccinated intragastrically for either Ad5-MERS-S or Ad41-MERS-S. cytokine profiles of spleen cells from immunized mice at 16 weeks were analysed. spleen cells from mice immunized with either Ad41-MERS-S or Ad5-MERS-S via an i.m. route produced IFN- (Fig.5a), IL-2 (Fig.5b), IL-10 (Fig.5c) and TNF- (Fig.5d) splenocytes from immunized mice were rescued, amplified and purified. each group contained six mice. adenovirus vectors were rescued, amplified and purified using traditional methods. recombinant adenovirus type 41\u2013Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (Ad41-MERS-S) or Ad5-MERS-S vectors were constructed. target genes (GFP or MERS-S) inserted into the deleted E1 region. cytomegalovirus promoter and simian virus 40 polyA tail were used to control target gene expression. the dosage of Ad41-based vaccines is fivefold that of the Ad5-based vaccines in this study. both the Ad5-MERS-S and Ad41-MERS-S viruses induced strong RBD-specific IgG antibodies 4 weeks (short term) after vaccination. statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: *P 0.05, **P 0.01, and ***P 0.001 Next, we assessed the capacity of Ad41-MERS-S and Ad5-MERS-S to induce long-term antibody responses in mice vaccinated with i.g. or i.m. injection. both the i.g. and i.m. groups induced only background levels of neutralizing antibodies. mice were killed 16 weeks after vaccination and analysed as above. intramuscular vaccination with Ad-MERS-S induces robust cellular immune responses in spleen and lung of mice. at 4 weeks post-immunization, i.m. Ad5-MERS-S and i.m. Ad41-MERS-S vaccination induced significant IFN--secreting T-cell responses. the data are expressed as spot-forming cells (SFCs) responding to receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific peptides. the data are presented as means standard error of the mean (SEM) a higher frequency of S-specific, Th1 cytokine-producing T cells were induced when Ad41-MERS-S or Ad5-MERS-S were vaccinated via an i.m. route. these data indicated that a higher and sustained frequency of S-specific, Th1 cytokine-producing T cells were induced when Ad41-MERS-S or Ad5-MERS-S were induced. novel vectors that possess natural mucosal tropism may have advantages over some of the more common vectors in terms of administration, safety and vaccine potency. no significant antigen-specific T-cell responses were detected in the spleens and pulmonary lymphocytes of mice immunized intragastrically with Ad5-MERS-S. terologous rAd41 oral or ileal priming followed by an i.m. rAd5 boost elicits enhanced intestinal mucosal cellular immunity. antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were induced by the administration of rAd5- or rAd41-based vaccines expressing the S protein of MERS-CoV. i.m. rAd immunization consistently generated high-level T-lymphocyte responses among the systemic and mucosal compartments. a single i.m. dose of Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced strong, persistent and complementary systemic and mucosal immunity. a single i.m. or i.g. administration of Ad5-S or Ad41-S induced S-antigen-specific systemic and mucosal immunity. the most significant and sustained neutralizing antibody production could be elicited by rAd5-based vaccine via the intramuscular route."}
