{"summary": "enteric viruses are the etiological agents for a series of health disturbances for commercial chickens around the world. they cause severe economic losses for the poultry industry because they negatively affect productive parameters. they cause growth retardation, low feed consumption, high mortality, poor egg and meat production, and runting-Stunting syndrome (RSS) samples were collected between 2010 and 2017 from eleven states. each sample was composed of a pool of maximum five organs of the same type. the main reported symptoms of the birds were enteritis, diarrhea, decreased feed absorption, a decrease in production, mortality, signs of respiratory disease, and stunting syndrome. the mixture was vortexed, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. the mixture was clarified at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. aliquot of each supernatant was used for DNA and RNA extraction. RT products were stored at \u201320 \u00b0C. 2.4. primers used for detection of FAdV-I were those described in table 1.

FAdV-I was detected in samples originating from Pernambuco, Santa Catarina, and So Paulo. CAstV and ARtV were detected in the state of Minas Gerais. the origin of the remaining viruses detected, i.e., FAdV-I (2/333), ChPV (7/333), CAstV (7/333), ANV (5/333), IBV (63/333), and ARtV (2/333), were not reported. 2 (9.1) 5 (11.9) 1 (0.5) 1 (5.9) Piaui 1 0.4% 1 (0.5) Santa Catarina 7 2.6% 7 (25) So Paulo 82 30.4% 18 (64.3) 3 (13.6) 7 (16.7) 65 (33.2) 3 (17.6) Not informed 79 29.3% 2 (7.1) 7 (31.8) 7 (25.9) 5 (11.9) 63 (32.1) 1 (100) 2 (11.8) Total 270 100% 28 (100) 22 (100 phylogenetic tree for FAdV-I strains was inferred with neighbor-joining statistical method and based on the partial sequence of the Hexon gene. numbers along the branches refer to bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. the five species of FAdV-I are grouped and identified with letters A\u2013E. numbers along the branches refer to bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. the three sequences that were positive for ARtV were analyzed with reference sequences from the united states, Peru, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, and Nigeria. Isolate 786-1 clustered with an isolate of ChPV from Peru. isolates 752-3 and 691-1 clustered in a different group. phylogenetic trees were inferred using neighbor-joining method. multiple infections occurred with 25 profile combinations of viruses. ANV, CAstV, IBV, ChPV, and ARtV were present in combination with each other, resulting in between two and five virus combinations. the samples received for viral diagnostics were from broilers, layers, and breeders of all ages. according to the age of birds, the samples corresponding to layer and breeder hens were divided into 5 groups. a group for which the ages were not reported. age of Flocks Layers Breeders Number of Positive Samples % of Samples Positive for Each Week of Age Number of Positive Samples % of Samples Positive for Each Week of Age 1\u201310 weeks 49 16.3% 37 18.9% 11\u201320 weeks 18.4% 0% 21\u201330 weeks 4.1% 0% 31\u201340 weeks 16.3% 13.5% 41\u201350 weeks 0% 18.9% >51 weeks 22.4% 37.8% Not reported 22.4% 10.8% The samples corresponding to broilers were divided into 6 groups with single viral infections found mostly in broilers, with 129/233 (55.4%), followed by 49/233 (21%) in layers and 34/233 (14.6%) in breeders. multiple viral infections found with more frequency in broilers, with 14/17 (82.4%) with two viruses, 15/15 (100%) with three viruses, and 4/4 (100%) with four viruses. the organs corresponding to positive results for FAdV, ChPV, CAstV, and ARtV included the liver, intestines, and pancreas. AReo was present in one sample of intestines and IBV was present in all the five organs used for this study. ARtV was found in samples from breeders (2/17) and broilers (15/17) all data describing the positive samples according to the age of layers, breeders, and broilers affected by the enteric viruses in this study are shown in Table 8. Frequency of viruses affecting birds according to the age of birds. IBV was the main virus found in 11 states, accounting for 133/333 of the total viruses detected, excluding the state of Paraiba. most of the samples positive for enteric viruses were from to the state of so Paulo 82/270 (30.4%) the numbers in parentheses represent the percentage values of each sample. the blanks indicate that the sample showed negative results in the PCR assay. phylogenetic tree for FAdV-I strains was inferred with neighbor-joining statistical method. numbers along branches refer to bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. some isolates originated from china and Peru. Isolates 475-5, 656-3, 691-6, and 752-3, clustered with reference sequences of Avian Nephritis Virus from the united states, Korea, Australia, China, and Japan. a second group of isolates were clustered with reference sequences of chicken astrovirus from India and the united states. numbers along the branches refer to bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. phylogenetic tree for AReo strains, was inferred with neighbor-joining statistical method. numbers along the branches refer to bootstrap values for 1000 replicates. Sequence of Duck Reovirus was used as out-group control. most common enteric viruses associated with the enteric diseases of chickens and turkeys include FAdV-I, ChPV, CAstV, ANV, IBV, AReo, and ARtV [7,9]. clinical signs reported for each sample used in this study were related to digestive problems (diarrhea and feed intake), respiratory signs, stunting, high mortality, and a decrease in egg and meat production. the virus was detected in 20 infected samples from broilers between 1 and 28 days old. AReo was found in 15/333 detections, corresponding to broilers in the growth phase. both astroviruses, CAstV and ANV, were found in samples from young broilers. astroviruses, such as CAstV and ANV, are commonly detected in the digestive organs and fecal samples of sick and healthy birds. in our study, we found three different serotypes of FAdV-I, without ruling out the possibility of multiple FAdV infections in the same sample because multiple strains of different serotypes can affect to the same animal. PV was present in co-infections with one to four enteric viruses, including IBV, ANV, FAdV-I, and CAstV. the most common virus found in this study belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which indicates the presence of single IBV infections. isolates from the united states, Peru, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, Nigeria, and Brazil may confirm the complete distribution of the virus around the world. the geographical distribution of the enteric viruses analyzed in this study was reported previously in some regions from the Brazilian territory. V in the states of minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, and Goias is the most disseminated virus among Poultry flocks in Brazil [63]. this virus requires more specific analysis for the characterization of the different genotypes that affect commercial chickens in Brazilian states and other countries in South America."}
