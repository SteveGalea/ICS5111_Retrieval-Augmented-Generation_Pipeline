{"summary": "the report of the construction of an infectious horsepox virus from synthesized DNA raised considerable concerns about whether this study will facilitate the construction of smallpox virus using synthetic biology. the authors describe a workflow from chemically synthesized DNA to the rescue of infectious horsepox virus with the intention to generate a horsepox virus-based vaccine that may be equally efficacious as vaccinia virus-based vaccines. the authors are now blamed for providing a workflow that allows for the generation of any infectious poxvirus, including smallpox virus, from synthesized DNA. the authors are now blamed for providing a workflow that allows for the generation of any infectious poxvirus, including smallpox virus. vaccinia virus has been used for decades to modify mainly vaccinia virus, but also other poxviruses. overlapping DNA fragments are joined in poxvirus-infected cells by homologous recombination. procedures to rescue poxviruses from naked DNA have also been established for decades. synthetic biology has entered the field of large DNA viruses. synthesis of infectious horsepox virus by Evans and colleagues demonstrates that synthetic biology has entered the field of large DNA viruses. the impact of synthetic biology goes far beyond the question of DURC. it can be expected that synthetic eukaryotic cells will follow soon. this technology will allow the generation of designer microbes and, ultimately, synthetic life."}
