{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antigenic formulations have been tested in animal models and clinical trials. but the immunogenicity of a protein antigen can be enhanced by targeting the antigen to the major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) processing compartment. several LAMP/antigen chimeras have been shown to co-localize in vitro with MHC II, LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and H-2M in multiple cell types. the immunological benefits of LAMP-targeted antigens have been demonstrated in several mouse strains and also in humans [25]\u2013[26]. immunization of these primates with a human LAMP/gag (hLAMP/gag) DNA vaccine promoted a humoral and cellular immune response. this was associated with a sustained activation of B-lymphocytes as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. these results substantiate the usefulness of the LAMP vaccination strategy. pITR vector [27] contains the AAV-ITR flanking expression elements. the p55gag sequence was inserted between the luminal domain and the TMCy domain of mouse LAMP (mLAMP) the control plasmids, consisting of mLAMP and hLAMP, were constructed using the respective complete LAMP sequences without Gag. coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min and washed with PBS. then blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 4% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin. cells were incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-Gag monoclonal antibody. studies with Mice Immunization of mice Female BALB/c mice, 6\u20138 weeks of age, were obtained from Charles River (Kingston, NY, USA) mice in groups of eight were each immunized twice (21 days apart), intramuscularly (i.m.), with 50 g of the indicated plasmid and sacrificed 7 days later. immunoization of macaques Each animal was immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) five times at weeks 0, 4, 14, 22 and 38 with 5 mg of hLAMP/gag DNA plasmid. blood and mucosal samples of non-immunized macaques were supplied periodically as controls. the CD8+ cells were >98% pure as assessed by flow cytometry. the frequency of IFN--producing CD4+ or CD8+ cells from immunized Rhesus macaques was measured by ELISPOT assays. ylated anti-human IFN- for 2 h at RT followed by HRP-conjugated avidin for 1 h at RT. the reaction was developed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbozole substrate. the reaction was developed with an immunospot image analyzer. plates were coated with 5 g/ml HIVIIIB lysate in sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4 (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) after overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, the solution was removed. plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with blocking buffer (PBS-T with 5% FBS) and then washed three times with PBS-T. plates were diluted in 0.1 M sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4, to give a concentration of 5 g/ml, and 50 l of the individual peptide was added to each well of a 96-well plate, in duplicate. after overnight incubation, the solution was removed, and the plates were incubated with blocking buffer for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and washed three times. the p55gag sequence was inserted between the luminal domain and the TMCy domain of mouse LAMP (mLAMP) in the present study, the complete mLAMP cDNA described above was replaced by the human LAMP-1 (hLAMP) cDNA. the control plasmids, consisting of mLAMP and hLAMP, were constructed using the respective complete LAMP sequences without Gag. coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min and washed with PBS. then blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 4% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin. cells were incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-Gag monoclonal antibody. studies with Mice Immunization of mice Female BALB/c mice, 6\u20138 weeks of age, were obtained from Charles River (Kingston, NY, USA) mice in groups of eight were each immunized twice (21 days apart), intramuscularly (i.m.), with 50 g of the indicated plasmid and sacrificed 7 days later. mice were challenged 21 days after the first immunization with a plasmid containing the native Gag sequence. antibody responses Mouse serum was obtained from the tail vein 7 days after the second immunization. mucosal samples including mouth swabs, nasal and rectal washes were drawn over the 42 week experiment period. blood and mucosal samples of non-immunized macaques were supplied periodically as controls. IFN--producing CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from immunized Rhesus macaques was measured by ELISPOT assays. ELISPOT plates were coated with anti-human IFN- Ig at 5 g/ml and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. total PBMCs (3105 cells/well) were cultured with hybridoma serum-free medium. all results were expressed as mean number of SFC per 106 PBMCs. for each antigen, a responder Rhesus macaque was defined as one exhibiting a significant number IFN-SFC cells over the background value or value for non-immunized macaques. the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with blocking buffer (PBS-T with 5% FBS) and then washed three times with PBS-T. IgA responses in serum, nasal, mouth and rectal washes were measured. 100 l of a 1300 dilution in blocking buffer was added to each well. the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and washed three times. PBMCs were isolated by centrifugation (400g, 40 min) on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. PBMCs to be used for cytokine analysis or ELISPOT assay were resuspended in supplemented culture medium. ELISPOT plates were coated with anti-human IFN- Ig at 5 g/ml. after 16 h of culture, the plates were washed and incubated with biotinylated anti-human IFN- Ig for 2 h at room temperature. antigen, a responder Rhesus macaque, was defined as one exhibiting a significant number IFN-SFC cells over the background value or value for non-immunized macaques. ELISA Total PBMCs (5105 cells) from immunized macaques were cultured in a 96-well plate containing recombinant human IL-2 (500 U/well) 100 l of goat anti-monkey IgG (Sigma) diluted 15000 in blocking buffer was added to each well. plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and washed eight times. 100 l of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-monkey IgG (Sigma) were added to each well. the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and then washed. cellular MHC II was confirmed with transfected cells stained with anti-Gag and anti-MHC II monoclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis of human 293 cells transfected with mLAMP/gag and hLAMP/gag plasmids. samples were probed with anti-Gag monoclonal antibodies. blood samples were collected 7 days after the second immunization. each titration curve indicates the OD450 of Gag-specific total IgG present in serial dilutions of pooled serum from individual groups of mice. splenocytes were prepared for assay of CD4+ T-cell responses. AMP/gag plasmids elicited comparable IFN-+ responses (8000 pg/ml and 6000 pg/ml, respectively) mice immunized once with 50 g of the plasmid DNA, followed 21 days later by inoculation with recombinant vaccinia-Gag-Pol (rVVGag-Pol) mice were sacrificed after 2 h for ex vivo assay. responses of each macaque to the hLAMP/Gag chimera were measured at 12 time points, through 42 weeks. ELISPOT assays to quantify the IFN-+-secreting cells present in the macaque PBMCs were independently performed at the Southern Research Center and The Johns Hopkins University laboratories. IFN- ELISPOT assays were performed with PBMC samples from each of five Rhesus macaques immunized with 5 mg of hLAMP/gag DNA plasmid. each bar represents the number of cells activated in separate assays by rGag protein or Gag 15- or 20-aa peptides. each bar represents the number of IFN-+ cells per 106 PBMCs. each bar is the average count from duplicate wells+/S.D. each bar represents the number of IFN-+ cells per 106 CD8+-depleted PBMCs. chimeric antigen commonly elicits enhanced and additional T-cell responses that were not detected with the native antigen. ELISPOT assays at week 20 after three DNA immunizations. each bar represents the frequency of IFN-+ cells per 106 PBMCs. similar findings have been obtained with the five immunized macaques. the strength of these responses followed the same pattern as the T-cell responses. a diluted 1100 from individual macaques was assayed for total anti-Gag antibodies. the reported titers correspond to the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that gave an OD value three times higher than that of a non-immune serum. significant levels were detected in three (#3119, 3159 and 3162) of the immunized macaques. d at week 32 with recombinant Gag protein after four DNA immunizations. responses to 49 individual 20-aa Gag peptides overlapping by 10-aa were measured by ELISA. western blotting with anti-Gag antibody showed the presence of 200 kDa LAMP/Gag protein at comparable levels in 293 cells transfected with either mouse or human LAMP/gag. there appeared to be increased degradation of Gag in the hLAMP/gag transfected cells. total anti-Gag IgG responses were assayed with blood collected on day 28. the response of mice immunized with the hLAMP/gag construct was considerably greater than the response to the mLAMP/gag. nonspecific lysis (using unpulsed P815 target cells) was 5% for all groups. the effector cells from the various groups of immunized mice were used as indicated. inant vaccinia virus encoding Gag is attributed to the massive in vivo expansion of Gag-activated CD8+ T cells reactive against several other Gag MHC I epitopes. the immunodominant H-2Kd-AMQMLKETI peptide-tetramer epitope complex was immunized i.m. with 5 mg of the hLAMP/gag plasmid at weeks 0, 4, 14, 22 and 38. PBMCs of all five immunized macaques stimulated with 15- and 20-aa Gag peptide pools separately showed no significant difference in the IFN- response. all five macaques showed a response in the range of 200\u20131000 IFN-+ SFC/106 CD8+-depleted cells, indicating a potent CD4+-mediated response. ELISPOT assays show the average number of IFN-+ cells activated by Gag 15- and 20-aa peptide pools. each bar represents the number of IFN-+ cells per 106 PBMCs. each bar represents the number of IFN-+ cells per 106 CD8+-depleted PBMCs. immunized macaques showed responses to five to eight of the peptide pools. one of the animals, macaque #3162, showed activation of IFN-+ cells. hLAMP/gag can prime a broad T-cell response in primates. end-dilution titers of the IgG antibodies achieved after four hLAMP/gag immunizations ranged from 2,700 to 24,300. serum dilution of 1100 from individual macaques was assayed for total anti-Gag antibodies (IgG) IgA antibodies detected in mouth swabs and nasal and rectal washes varied remarkably among the individual macaques. comparatively higher IgA antibodies were found in nasal washes of all the five macaques. g peptides overlapping by 10-aa comprising the HIV Gag sequence were measured by ELISA in sera collected at week 24. the antibody activity in each of the five macaques was directed at 13 peptides, with dominant responses to 2 amino-terminal and 10 carboxy-terminal sequences. previous studies have shown protection of small animals against pathogenic challenges. /c mice with LAMP-targeted Gag increase the breadth of B- and T-cell responses. some of the peptides behave as dominant epitopes and induced strong B-cell activation in all five macaques. some of the peptides behave as dominant epitopes and induced strong B-cell activation. IL-6 production was detected in three of the five immunized macaques. increased production of IL-6 by Gag-specific CD4+ T cells is consistent with induction of HIV-specific IgA B-cell responses. IgA and IgG antibodies may function as a first line of defense. a significant percentage of humans respond to both the DNA and adenovirus approaches. the current study was limited by the small number of animals and the lack of an HIV challenge system to assess the protective efficacy afforded by the HIV hLAMP."}
