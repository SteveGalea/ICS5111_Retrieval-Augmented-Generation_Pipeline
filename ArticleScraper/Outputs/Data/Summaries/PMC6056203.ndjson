{"summary": "new demographic, epidemiological and clinical trends have emerged. they include migration, antimicrobial resistance and accumulated evidence on the role of infections in the pathogenesis of neoplasia. ENT is one of the areas where use and misuse of antibiotic treatment has resulted in enormous issues relating to antibiotic resistance. in high-income countries in the last century there was an epidemiological and demographic transition involving the shift from high mortality due to infectious diseases to increased mortality through chronic degenerative disease. 328 million adults and 32 million children (equal to approximately 5.3% of the world\u2019s population) live with an invalidating hearing loss and that approximately 15% of the world\u2019s population is affected by various degrees of hearing impairment. foetal infection in the first three months, especially in the first 8-10 weeks, carries an extremely high risk of causing malformations and hypoacusia. deafness as a result of rubeolic infection is generally sensorial and bilateral, can already be seen at birth, but may appear in later stages. varicella zoster is a herpes virus which causes severe bilateral deafness by destroying the nerve and sensory cells of the neuroepithelium. it is estimated that after a meningitis from Streptococcus pneumoniae and from Neisseria meningitidis there is a risk of hypoacusia of 22% and of 8% respectively 12. OM is one of the most common diseases in infancy, causing approximately 51,000 deaths per year in children under 5 years of age 17. it is responsible for a number of extracranial complications (facial paralysis, subperiosteal abscess, labyrinthine fistula etc.) the ENT area constitutes, with its own epithelia and anatomically, the first barrier against infections. it is also rich in tissue involved in immune reactions, owing to the numerous lymphatic stations. this is a member of the Herpesviridae family, which is transmitted through contact with bodily secretions and by sexual means. congenital CMV (maternal-foetal transmission) can lead to a highly complex symptomatology, including important loss of hearing. Typical signs in the immunodepressed patients who undergo reactivation of the latent virus are antibiotic-resistant sinusitis, with exacerbations of local invasiveness. the manner in which the toxoplasmosis manifests itself depends on the condition of the immune system of the patient. a major review of the literature 30 in 2015 concluded that a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is rarely taken into consideration by doctors, even when a patient shows an isolated cervical or occipital lymphadenopathy. the otorhinolaryngologist must therefore take this diagnostic assumption into consideration. the majority of patients with head/neck located TB in most cases show signs and symptoms of lymphadenitis (86.53%), followed by manifestations determined by laryngeal, adenotonsillar, deep spaces of the neck and the salivary glands localisation. needle aspiration biopsy is recognised as the gold-standard procedure for diagnosis of tubercular lymphadenitis. more than 90% of new cases reported by the WHO in 2014 occurred in 8 countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Algeria and Colombia. more than 90% of new cases reported by the WHO in 2014 occurred in 8 countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Algeria and Colombia. the WHO recorded the highest frequency of severe visceral leishmaniasis with 9000 cases/year in Southeast Asia. 44% of patients affected by leishmaniasis bore disease lesions at the head and neck level only, while 13% bore them in association with lesions in other sites 39. if the initial lesion located in the head/neck is of large dimensions, the progression to widespread cutaneous leishmaniasis is considered to have higher probability. infections from udomonas aeruginosa are typical in widely known disease pictures familiar to the ENT specialist. the bacterium can play the role of transmissible or opportunist infectious disease, also affecting the tissues of the hearing organ. in the area of the ear, Pseudomonas causes various types of otitis. in adults with full-blown AIDS, the more frequent infectious head/neck diseases are oropharyngeal candidiasis, chronic rhinosinusitis and cervical lymphadenopathies. some studies have demonstrated a very strong correlation between HIV, HPV and tumours, not only in the uterine cervix and anorectal tract, but also in the head/neck area. infections with genotypes that are more often associated with oncogenic effects are linked to HPV 16 and 18. squamous cell carcinomas are prevalently in the oropharynx, which affect specifically the tonsillar epithelium and the base of the tongue 48. an important recent study has provided the first evidence of the molecular pathogenetic mechanism with which EBV causes the typical beginning of induced oncogenic cell division in nasopharyngeal carcinomas 57. there is a role of EBV in the genesis of malignant tumours in the salivary glands 58. an epidemiological element that stands out is its greater incidence in Asia, compared to Europe and America. the increase of microbial resistance has become a well known issue of worldwide public health 60 61. these two phenomena, antibiotic resistance and their inappropriate use, are dramatically linked inasmuch as they overlap clinically in hospital patients. best use of antibiotics and best practices of hygiene and prophylaxis on premises and in procedures of medical assistance should be the keys to successfully curbing these rampant phenomena. the study deals with the appropriateness of dosages, times and methods of antibiotic prophylaxis for minor paediatric operations such as tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, otosurgery of the middle ear and tympanum. the authors come to the conclusion that prevention of nosocomial infections is almost completely in the hands of and down to the choices of the otorhinolaryngological surgeon. the new PNPV 2017-19 includes classic vaccines against measles, parotitis, rubella, H. influenzae type b, pneumococcus, meningococcus C-ACYW135, diphtheria influenza. it extends the recommendation for HPV vaccination also to adolescent males. since 2013 in Italy a gradual fall has been recorded in vaccine coverage 70-72. obligatory vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and hepatitis B has been extended to a further 6 vaccinations, against measles, parotitis, rubella and varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type B and whooping cough. primary prevention actions also include health education to inform the population on prevention methods, on modality of transmission and potential risk factors of infectious diseases. for control of tuberculosis there are ongoing specific programmes of supervision and control of the disease. the main objective of these programmes is identification of infected subjects (Mantoux and Quantiferon Tests), administration of preventive chemotherapy in cases of positive tests, and diagnosis of pulmonary forms of tuberculosis 81. other secondary prevention measures are targeted on identification of precancerous forms or tumours in the initial stage in the head and neck area passing on to identifying HPV infections and mutation choices of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) intended to prevent recurrence or progression of the specific pathology and in consideration of its etiologic agent. 328 million adults and 32 million children (equal to approximately 5.3% of the world\u2019s population) live with an invalidating hearing loss. approximately 15% of the world\u2019s population is affected by various degrees of hearing impairment 6. despite the existence of a world-wide plan for elimination of congenital rubella, approximately 100,000 babies per year are born with congenital rubella syndrome. despite the existence of a world-wide plan for elimination of congenital rubella, approximately 100,000 babies per year are born with congenital rubella. in italy there are still issues linked to congenital rubella. meningitis Bacterial meningitis in paediatric age is one of the most common causes of acquired deafness. it is estimated that after a meningitis from Streptococcus pneumoniae and from Neisseria meningitidis there is a risk of hypoacusia of 22% and of 8% respectively 12. cases of bacterial meningitis aggravated by neurological complications and deafness are also found in adults. bacterial meningitis secondary to acute and chronic OM continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality 16 18. rubella virus is an RNA virus of the Togaviridae family, which can cause prenatal or congenital deafness through vertical transmission of the virus from mother to foetus. approximately 100,000 babies per year are born with congenital rubella syndrome. 160 rubella infections appeared during pregnancy and 75 cases of congenital infection. measles, parotitis and varicella, unlike rubella, are mainly a cause of post-natal or acquired deafness. itidis there is a risk of hypoacusia of 22% and 8% respectively. cases of bacterial meningitis aggravated by neurological complications and deafness are also found in adults. in high-income countries annual incidence of bacterial meningitis is 0.8-2.6/100,000 adults, while in low-income countries it may be up to 10 times higher. chronic OM is responsible for a number of extracranial complications (facial paralysis, subperiosteal abscess, labyrinthine fistula etc.) it causes important sequelae (paralysis of the facial nerve, profound hearing loss) 5. bacterial meningitis secondary to acute and chronic OM continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality 16 18. congenital CMV (maternal-foetal transmission) can lead to a highly complex symptomatology, including important loss of hearing, included as first non-genetic cause of loss of hearing during pregnancy 26. it is a member of the Herpesviridae family, which is transmitted through contact with bodily secretions and by sexual means. toxoplasma gondii is the agent for toxoplasmosis, which is a widespread disease in most of the world. the definitive hosts of the protozoi are felines, while other mammals (including humans) are intermediate hosts 28. 11% of the population between the ages of 6 and 9 years is positive for toxoplasmosis. lymphadenitis from toxoplasmosis is a self-limited disease in an immunocompetent subject, with resolution in 1 or 2 months at most, without antibiotic treatment 31. it is extremely important to make a specific diagnosis of this infection in immune compromised patients, given that it may have severe developments or even lead to fatal outcomes 32. otorhinolaryngologists must therefore take this diagnostic assumption into consideration and absolutely must not underestimate it. leishmaniasis is a parasitic infectious disease that is endemic in more than 90 countries in the world. the pathogens involved may be at least 20 species of protozoan parasites. the parasitic protozoan parasites are transmitted to humans through the bite of females. more than 90% of new cases reported by the WHO in 2014 occurred in 8 countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Algeria and Colombia. larger epidemics of cutaneous leishmaniasis have affected various areas of Afghanistan and Syria 38. sporadic cases may appear and they are undergoing a slight increase. sporadic cases may appear and they are undergoing a slight increase. sporadic cases may appear and they are undergoing a slight increase. more than 95% of cases of malignant otitis externa caused by Pseudomonas are found in patients affected by AIDS or by advanced forms of diabetes with a complex pathological picture. the highest frequency of serious and severe progression in osteomyelitis of the cranial base and the temporomandibular joint is in some Regions 42. hypogeusia, lymphoepithelial parotid cysts, tuberculous retropharyngeal abscesses, non-malignant nasopharyngeal lymph node hypertrophy. some studies have demonstrated a very strong correlation between HIV, HPV and tumours. this virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family, which is transmitted through contact with bodily secretions and by sexual means. toxoplasma gondii is the agent for toxoplasmosis, which is a widespread disease in most of the world. the definitive hosts of the protozoi are felines, while other mammals (including humans) are intermediate hosts 28. 11% of the population between the ages of 6 and 9 years is positive for toxoplasmosis. toxoplasmosis is a self-limited disease in an immunocompetent subject, with resolution in 1 or 2 months at most, without antibiotic treatment 31. it is extremely important, however, to make a specific diagnosis of this infection in immune compromised patients, given that it may have severe developments or even lead to fatal outcomes 32. the otorhinolaryngologist must therefore take this diagnostic assumption into consideration and absolutely must not underestimate it. leishmaniasis is a parasitic infectious disease that is endemic in more than 90 countries in the world, with an incidence in the global population that the CDC estimates to range from 700,000 to 1,200,000 subjects infected per year 36. pathogens involved may be at least 20 species of protozoan parasites. transmission never occurs through direct contact person to person or dog to dog, nor even through contact of a person with an infected dog 36. the majority of infected people will never develop any symptomatology, while on the contrary, in patients with various degrees and causes of reduced immunocompetence the following pictures may appear. sporadic cases may appear and they are undergoing a slight increase. sporadic cases may appear and they are undergoing a slight increase. sporadic cases may appear and they are undergoing a slight increase. more than 95% of cases of malignant otitis externa caused by Pseudomonas are found in patients affected by AIDS or by advanced forms of diabetes with a complex pathological picture. opportunist infections are typical in this area and are prone to frequent complications and the cause of particularly difficult cases to treat. recurrent OM, vestibular deficiency, hyposmia and hypogeusia, lymphoepithelial parotid cysts, tuberculous retropharyngeal abscesses, non-malignant nasopharyngeal lymph node hypertrophy. some studies have demonstrated a very strong correlation between HIV, HPV and tumours, not only in the uterine cervix and anorectal tract, important genotypes have specific tropism for the basal cells of the stratified epithelia 49. the AIRC 50 officially included HPV-16 in 2007 as an oncogenic factor involved in these tumours 51. this was confirmed by a systematic review of 2017 which concluded that global spread of HPV infections is dramatically changing the epidemiological scenario of carcinomas in the head and neck area 53. an important review in 2017 attempted to assess incidence of malignant neoplasia in the salivary glands with correlations between types of neoplasia and geographical distribution. the multicultural nature of society, as well as globalisation related to transcontinental transfer of people, are aspects that give reason to reflect on the importance of the etiological hypothesis of EBV infection also on our continent. a systematic review of 2017 concluded that global spread of HPV infections is dramatically changing the epidemiological scenario of carcinomas in the head and neck area 53. this epidemiological situation constitutes an enormous prevention challenge, but this aspect will be better analysed in the paragraph on \u201cPrevention\u201d. the incidence of tumours in salivary glands was EBV correlated in 45.1% of cases occurring in patients in the world, but with the following geographical distribution. the multicultural nature of society, as well as globalisation related to transcontinental transfer of people, are aspects that give reason to reflect on the importance of the etiological hypothesis of EBV infection also on our continent. otorhinolaryngological surgeon has to prescribe antibiotics daily for treatment. he has to manage perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and carry out surgical operations in conditions that are frequently contaminated, if not occasionally dirty-contaminated. the hygienist and epidemiologist have to implement their preventive actions. the new PNPV 2017-2019 includes the classic vaccines of ENT interest, against measles, parotitis, rubella, H. influenzae type b, pneumococcus, meningococcus C-ACYW135, diphtheria influenza. the new PNPV 2017-2019 includes the classic vaccines of ENT interest, against measles, parotitis, rubella, H. influenzae type b, pneumococcus since 2013 in Italy a gradual fall has been recorded in vaccine coverage 70-72. this fall leads to the risk of reappearance of diseases that have been eliminated and is causing epidemic outbreaks on a large scale. the vaccines included in the PNPV 2017-19 have also been added to the Essential Levels of Assistance. ENT specialists have a good level of knowledge of HPV infection. they have a positive attitude towards prevention, especially towards vaccination. these results must form a useful basis for planning, implementing and assessing specific continuous education programmes on the subject of prevention of HPV infection 78. tertiary prevention measures include any measures aimed at controlling the more complex outcomes of a disease. the new PNPV 2017-2019 includes the classic vaccines of ENT interest, against measles, parotitis, rubella, H. influenzae type b, pneumococcus, meningococcus C-ACYW135, diphtheria influenza. the PNPV 2017-19, the calendar for life 2016 and the scientific Societies also lay down the offer of active, free vaccination against influenza, pneumococcus and Herpes Zoster. since 2013 in Italy a gradual fall has been recorded in vaccine coverage 70-72. this fall leads to the risk of reappearance of diseases that have been eliminated and is causing epidemic outbreaks on a large scale. ENT specialists have a good level of knowledge of HPV infection. they have a positive attitude towards prevention, especially towards vaccination. these results must form a useful basis for planning, implementing and assessing specific continuous education programmes on the subject of prevention of HPV infection 78. other secondary prevention measures are targeted on identification of precancerous forms or tumours in the initial stage in the head and neck area passing on to identifying HPV infections and mutations on a genetic level. it will be necessary, in any case, to identify new biomarkers and gain clearer understanding of the genetic mechanisms and of cancerization. the viral DNA contains a sequence of 7 early genes (E1-7) and 2 late genes (L1-2) the early proteins serve the purpose of encouraging cell growth and replication. the transcription products of the L1 and L2 genes represent two structural genes for the virus. more than 100 different types of HPV are known. a screening for oral infection from HPV carried out on 9256 subjects aged between 18 and 69 years revealed a prevalence of 7.3% of all HPVs and of 4% of those at high risk. HPV infection is positively associated with the number of partners for oral sex but not with the female sex or socio-economic class 4. the treatment for the two lesions is the same: surgical excision; FOCAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA, otherwise known as Heck\u2019s disease, is associated with HPV-13 and HPV-32 infection. it localises in the mucosa of the lips and tongue, with multiple and sessile nodular lesions. this does not correspond to what is actually observed in western countries. the mean age of patients affected by this type of tumour has fallen (40-55 years) and frequently exposure to traditional risk factors is anamnestically negative. however, the incidence of tumours of the oral and oropharyngeal cavity are, in any case, quite low. type 16 and 18 alone are responsible for 90% of HPV-correlated cases 9. however, identification of the viral DNA in neoplastic tissue does not demonstrate per se an etiopathogenetic link between HPV and tumour. it will be shown below which methods currently represent the diagnostic gold standard in this sense. viral protein E7 interacts with p53, which is normally capable of blocking the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. the latter, through the formation of a link with the transcription factor E2F, is capable of arresting progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S, therefore inhibiting cell replication. breakage of the circular DNA of the virus usually occurs in correspondence with the E2 gene, which has a repressive effect on transcription of E6 and E7. this event determines cell transformation towards neoplastic 18-20. diagnosis of HPV-correlated tumours is currently anatomopathological and aimed at identifying viral oncogenic activity present in tissue samples. PCR is highly sensitive in detecting the presence of even a few copies of viral DNA, but for the same reason it is not very specific. it is capable of performing quantitative analysis of virus load, which is more correlated to a real state of infection. it is performed with RNA probes, complementary to viral DNA, interacting with sections of tissue fixed in formalin and analysed through a fluorescent microscope. more than 10% of p16+ tumours lackany viral DNA detection. the specificity of immunohistochemistry for p16 alone cannot therefore be considered satisfactory. a two-step diagnostic strategy has been proposed, envisaging preliminary immunohistochemical assessment for detection of p16 in paraffin embedded tissue. new alternative strategies have also been proposed for the diagnosis of HPV correlated tumors. the detection of anti E6 antibodies shows high sensitivity and specificity in cases of oropharyngeal tumours 29. the detection of anti E6 antibodies shows lower sensitivity (50%) while maintaining high specificity (100%) 31. HPV positive oropharyngeal tumours also appear with distinct histological characteristics compared to HPV negative tumours. it is also possible to detect radiological differences between HPV positive oropharyngeal carcinomas and negative ones, the latter usually presenting as small or even hidden primitive lesions. the exact mechanism of improved prognosis for HPV positive oropharyngeal tumours is not clear at the moment. better therapeutic responses are believed to be due to the lack of the so called field cancerization effect and a consequent lower rate of genomic damage 39,40. the previous TNM classification, this tumour was classified as stage IV, whereas according to the new classification it belongs to stage I 43-45. it is absolutely necessary to update the classification of head and neck tumours because starting from the 1990s, initially in the united states and later elsewhere, incidence of carcinomas of the tonsil and tongue associated with infection from papillomavirus has undergone an increase of around 5% each year. tumour invades larynx, extrinsic muscle of tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible or beyond Table 3.II. clinical and pathological N for p16 positive oropharyngeal Carcinoma, eight.

Overview of treatment In order to be more schematic, treatment will be divided according to the stage of the disease: early stages of the disease (T1-T2 N0 and. a tendency has been seen to offer patients with advanced disease concomitant radio-chemotherapy treatment, as a strategy for organ preservation. a potential worry arises from the consideration that salvage surgery has proved to have an elevated percentage of success in carcinoma of the larynx but not equally so in other cervical cephalic areas. the choice of treatment derives from the dimension and site of the disease. there is no high quality definitive scientific evidence supporting induction chemotherapy for HPV related head and neck tumours. in the future it might have a better-defined role within de-intensified therapeutic protocols and in selected patients. squamous carcinoma patients have different epidemiological, molecular and clinical features from non-HPV related counterparts, with better radiosensitivity and prognosis. these subjects are also younger and with higher morbidity correlated to treatment, which may negatively influence quality of life. at the moment, de-intensified treatments for HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma are still subject of study. needle aspiration cytology may represent the first sample for carrying out diagnostic tests. it may represent a transitory viral infection of the mucosa, without real oncogenic potential. it is therefore necessary to separate the methodologies which detect the presence of the virus in the tissues. this method enables the analysis of the distribution of viral DNA in the cells and in the bioptic tissue and shows greater specificity. this enables distinction of a diffuse nuclear pattern, indicative of the plasmid state of the viral DNA. it also enables a view of a diffuse state of viral infection on cancer cell clones, rather than a state of infection localised to a few isolated cells. combining analysis of these two methods would make it possible to reach close to 100% sensitivity and specificity 23 29. the current importance of methods for the identification of p16+ tumours is in the fact that this marker seems to be closely linked to the prognosis of cancer pathology, rather than the presence of the HPV virus itself. research on anti-e6 antibodies in non-oropharyngeal HNSCC shows lower sensitivity (50%) while maintaining high specificity (100%) 31. a recently introduced method should also be pointed out, which enables detection, with in situ hybridization techniques, of viral mRNA for E6 and E7, performed on fixed and paraffin embedded material. overcoming the need of fresh material for this type of investigation should represent a breakthrough, enabling diffusion of a shared single diagnostic test for identification of a number of studies have shown better disease-free and overall survival for patients with HPV positive oropharyngeal carcinomas compared to patients with HPV negative oropharyngeal tumours. in the latter a 49% lower risk of death and 36% lower risk of recurrence 37. angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor are favourable to angiogenesis in patients with p16 negative head and neck carcinomas. this may explain the decrease in angiogenesis in the HPV positive carcinoma and its consequent better prognosis 41. this treatment de-intensification might consist of a reduced radiation dose and/or concomitant therapy, or again the introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to avoid concomitant chemotherapy during papillomavirus has undergone an increase of around 5% each year. the only widespread inexpensive and reliable test is represented by the histochemical detection of p16 protein in fixed tissue. overexpression of p16 should involve both the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of the tumour cell. greatest dimension T2 Tumour larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm in greatest dimension T3 Tumour larger than 4 cm in

metastasis N1 Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and extranodal extension negative. metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and extranodal extension negative. initial stages of the disease are normally treated with a single method: surgery or RT. the most modern treatment envisages a transoral approach, with either laser (TLM) or with the aid of a robot (TORS) the risk of hidden lymph node metastases in this stage varies from 10 to 31%. ipsilateral surgical treatment of the cervical lymph node stations is normally indicated. a prophylactic RT should be carried out on the ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes. transoral approach is suited more for the T1-T2 categories but may be considered for the T3 category, if there is a reasonable chance of achieving negative resection margins. open surgery approach can be considered especially if a reconstruction stage is needed Free flaps are usually preferred, but in such cases the functional results are often less than optimal. IMRT has allowed reduction of late toxicity and sparing of the parotid glands. trials are currently underway to explore the role of IMRT in improving dysphagia. a policy of active PET-CT guided supervision allows survival rates. vaccines for oropharyngeal carcinoma are still subject of study. there are many current indications for extending anti-HPV vaccination also for males. in the u.s. each year there are an estimated 7500 new male cases of HPV related neoplasias. the risk of hidden lymph node metastases in this stage varies from 10 to 31%, so ipsilateral surgical treatment of the cervical lymph nodes is normally indicated. radiotherapy In radical treatment, a total dose equivalent to 70Gy in 35 fractions is normally used. the most frequently used technique is IMRT. primary chemoradiotherapy CRT in loco-regionally advanced stages of disease is an effective therapeutic choice (organ preservation) RT alone can be taken into consideration for patients unfit for concomitant CRT, especially if aged over 70 years. there is no high quality definitive scientific evidence supporting the use of induction chemotherapy for HPV related head and neck tumours. recent level I scientific evidence showed that a policy of active PET-CT guided supervision allows survival rates similar to those achieved with neck surgery planned as default at the end of CRT. Surgical treatment of the neck is only planned when there is clear or doubtful residual lymph node on PET-CT carried out at 10-12 weeks after the end of CRT. oral HPV prevalence has passed from 9.3% in 2009 to 1.4% in 2014. in the u.s. each year there are an estimated 7500 new male cases of HPV related neoplasias. vaccines have shown to be highly promising in primary prevention against HPV related oropharyngeal tumours. the viral envelope has an irregular shape and is acquired during budding of the virus by the plasma membrane of the host cell. the viral genome consists of a single short and a single long region, with multiple repeated terminal sequences, which probably allow circularization of the DNA. it is estimated that 95% of the world population contracts an asymptomatic infection from EBV, lasting the whole lifetime. the deterministic intervention of EBV in pathogenesis of some neoplastic diseases is linked to its complex and structured oncopathogenic process, which has not yet been clearly defined. the regional prevalence of these oncological pathologies is found in the cervical cephalic region, characterised by high incidence of neoplastic pathologies. determinism of a state of latency, during which the virus does not replicate inside the cell. the viral genome localised inside the B-lymphocyte induces synthesis of specific proteins, called EBNA antigens. proliferation of B-lymphocytes is mediated by the EBNA antigens. the viral capsid antigen, the first antigen system to be described in infections from EBV, is a complex antigen including the structural components of the viral capsid which are synthesised into an infected cell at the end of the lytic cycle. anti-VCA antibodies appear after the infection and remain lifelong. not all human serums with antibodies against the EA complex possess antibodies against the complex. the pathological mechanisms determining the evolution of a viral infection towards oncological pathologies of the cervical cephalic area assumes particularly complex variegations. the existence may be presumed of a conditioning, favourable substrate, which might be a disorder of the immune system or synergic co-intervention of other viral elements. neoplasia is widely present in severe forms of epithelial dysplasia. however, different diagnostic weight may be given to association between presence of EBER, of LMP1 and EBNA2. it is important to highlight that oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma localises mainly at the level of the tonsils and base of the tongue. all patients with non-differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma possessed anti-VCA and anti-EA antibodies, especially against component D. the presence of the viral genome was demonstrated in all bioptic samples of the undifferentiated tumour. the presence of the viral genome was demonstrated in all bioptic samples of the undifferentiated tumour. the physiopathological relationship and molecular mechanism of EBV-mediated carcinogenesis has not yet been clearly defined. the viral production is limited to just three proteins: EBNA 1, latent membrane protein 1 and 2 \u2013 LMP1 and LMP2 \u2013 as well as a series of small RNAs \u2013 EBER \u2013 and miRNA \u2013 11. Cells infected by EBV should normally be recognised by cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for EBV. neoplasia may show up under three different forms: well differentiated and keratinising squamous form; non-keratinising form; poorly differentiated form with abundant lymphocyte infiltration. epithelioma of the salivary glands, a rare carcinoma manifestation, is endemic to southern china and the Inuit population of the Arctic 13. association of the neoplasia with EBV infection can be found in approximately 40% of cases, where it is generally possible to detect high titres of antibodies against EBV. treatment involves chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both. approximately 1% of lymphocytes in peripheral blood contain an EBNA. a wide interval is hindered by subjective interpretation and lack of antibodies monospecific to the different components of the antigen complex. other markers, though, offer greater probative indications, such as LMP1 and EBNA2 16. akias Oral hairy leukoplakia is a typical pre-cancerous lesion featuring the presence of whitish, hyperkeratotic non-detachable patches. these manifestations can typically be seen in cases where the EBV infection appears in immunocompromised patients, such as those afflicted with infection from HIV. nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumour of the squamous epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumour of the squamous epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. in the malignant epithelial cells of NPC in vitro cultures 8,9, EBV reaches the epithelial cells by means of glycoprotein gH, which permits adhesion through a CD21-independent mechanism. in subjects with normal function of the immune system, the latent infection at the level of the memory B cells permits only transcription of the EBERs, called latency 0 state. a miRNA has been identified, mir-31, constantly down-regulated in NPC. the primitive site of the tumour is generally represented by the Rosenmuller fossa. the primitive site of the tumour is generally represented by the Rosenmuller fossa. epithelioma of the salivary glands Infection from EBV may also be associated with manifestations of tumours other than NPC, such as epithelioma of the salivary glands. neoplasia presents close histological similarities with non-keratinised nasopharyngeal carcinoma. muderris et al. 19 analysed squamous cell laryngeal carcinoma by RT-PCR. the authors concluded there was no clearly demonstrated correlation between EBV infection and squamous cell laryngeal carcinoma. the virus can be isolated from the saliva, from peripheral blood or from lymph node tissue. cervical cephalic tumours associated with EBV are relatively rare, even if they are often mistakenly diagnosed. the oncogenic role of EBV in associated tumours is of a cofactor nature that requires other genetic mutations and can be associated with other infections, such as malaria and HPV. sexual transmission occurs mainly through anal relations, either homo or hetero. the method is considered more at risk since the anal epithelium is more fragile. this can happen through transfusions of infected blood and its derivatives. this can happen between drug addicts who use injectable drugs. clinical manifestations have changed, with paucisymptomatic forms appearing, but quite typical in HIV positive subjects. the more typical forms of AIDS have become less frequent 1 2. side effects of antiviral treatment may come into play, that is the so-called IRIS, an atypical reaction to infections after employment of antiretroviral therapy. \"hearing disorder\"[Title/Abstract] or \"cholesteatoma\"[Title/Abstract] or \"otomycosis\"[Title/Abstract] or \"retrocochlear\"[Title/Abstract] or \"retrocochlear\"[Title/Abstract] or \"retrocochlear\"[Title/Abstract] or \"ret \"susac syndrome\"[Title/Abstract] or \"laryngitis\"[Title/Abstract] or \"vocal cord disorders\"[Title/Abstract] or \"epistaxis\"[Title/Abstract] or \"nasal polyps\"[Title/Abstract] or \"rhinitis\"[Title/Abstract] or \"pharynge \"nasopharyngeal diseases\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"pharyngitis\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"velopharyngeal insufficiency\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( [Title/Abstract] OR \u201csalivary gland neoplasms\u201d[Title/Abstract]) OR (\u201ctongue neoplasm\u201d[Title/Abstract] OR \u201ctongue neoplasms\u201d[Title/Abstract]) OR (\u201cear neoplasm\u201d[Title/Abstract] OR \u201cear neoplasms\u201d[Title/ global bibliographical research thus obtained was filtered for \"review\" and \"systematic review\" 123 publications were considered valid, which cannot all be cited for publishing reasons. the more serious clinical forms appear when the CD4+ count falls below 200/mmc. the more serious clinical forms appear when the CD4+ count falls below 200/mmc. the more serious clinical forms appear when the CD4+ count falls below 200/mmc. vulvovaginal candidiasis, persistent, frequent or poorly responsive to treatment; cervical dysplasia (moderate or severe/carcinoma in situ); constitutional symptoms e.g. persistent high temperature (38.5\u00b0C) or diarrhea > 1 month; oral hairy leukoplakia multimetameric or recurring herpes zoster idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura listeriosis pelvic inflammatory pathology. since the mid-1980 the natural history of the disease changed after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, especially HAART. the natural history of the disease has meant that today\u2019s Otorhinolaryngologist plays a role of primary importance in supporting the Infectious Disease Specialists and Internists in monitoring afflicted patients. a fall was seen of 10-50% in oral manifestations, especially candidiasis. in the USA and in the united kingdom, however, an increase was reported for oral verrucas. in both the USA and in the united kingdom, however, an increase was reported for oral verrucas. in both the uk and the united kingdom, however, an increase was reported for oral verrucas. CMV ulcers are similar to aphthous lesions and appear in subjects with CMV disseminated infection. they involve the non-keratinised oral mucosa, such as the labial and buccal mucosa and the lateral margins of the tongue. aphthous ulcers are not more frequent in HIV+ subjects compared to the rest of the population. the gamma-herpesvirus has been recognised as an etiological agent of OHL 26. it presents with hyperkeratosis, with thickening of the stratum spinosum (acanthosis), with groups of globular koilocyte-like keratinocytes. a new state of EBV infection has been found, with concomitant expression of replicant and transforming proteins. Candidiasis is characterised by a removable white patch formed from a mixture of fungal hyphae, desquamated epithelium and inflammatory cells. this form may affect every part of the oral and oropharyngeal mucosa. hyperplastic candidiasis appears as small reddish depapillated areas on the palate and dorsal surface of the tongue. the most recent data 32 indicates that the sub-class Th17 of the T-helpers plays an important role in controlling the virulence of the fungus. selective loss of these leucocytes with progress of the HIV infection causes decay of containment of the fungus on the oral epithelium and enables Candida to express its pathogenic potential. necrotising ulcerative periodontitis is a more serious lesion. it causes pain, gingival bleeding, rapid extensive destruction of gingiva, periodontal tissue and the alveolar bone. increased oral verrucas has been observed in HIV+ subjects. an initial sign of HIV infection may be hypertrophy of the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer\u2019s ring. these tissues constitute one of the main sites of replication of the virus and its presence characterises certain histopathological aspects. the patient may complain of obstruction of airways, pharyngitis, fever. rhinosinusitis is sustained by the common bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae) which afflict the general population. if the immune defence is compromised, patients become more susceptible to opportunistic infections 42. nasal involvement appears as a common rhinitis with nasal obstruction and epistaxis. the disease may progress to other muco-cutaneous tissues with ulcerations and serious mutilation of the face. disseminated histoplasmosis is very widespread in south America. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, lymphoma, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, candidiasis, aspergillosis 5 48. differential diagnosis must be made principally with squamous cell carcinoma. in HIV+ subjects there is special interest in laryngeal tuberculosis. the etiological agent is Rochalimaea or bartonella henselae 50. this disease is characterised by protruding cutaneous lesions, reddish, berry shaped. if traumatised, the lesions bleed abundantly. otologic and audio-vestibular manifestations Damage to the auditory apparatus may derive from recurrent common infections or from opportunistic infections (middle and outer ear) or from possible ototoxic action of drugs or from action of HIV itself on the central nervous system (inner ear and vestibular system) 51 52. sensorineural hearing loss can be a consequence of an infection directly involving the inner ear (viral forms) or the central nervous system 9. it is probable that a greater percentage is found among HIV+ subjects that report hearing disturbance. subjects with HIV infection in course present rapid worsening of neurosyphilis. patients with HIV encephalopathy can present motor alterations, uncertain gait, lack of balance and difficulty in effecting rapid alternating movements. ous presented oculomotor disorders in 27% of cases, but with caloric test normal. subjects who complained of subjective vertigo presented substantially stable peripheral disorder. central vestibular damage was much more evident 57 59. post mortem studies have documented involvement of whole vestibular system. lymphoepithelial parotid cyst presents with increased mono- or bilateral volume of the parotids, usually asymptomatic, but may sometimes generate pain 5 18 64. lymphoepithelial cyst is a benign form and seems to originate from the peri- and intraparotid lymph nodes. the common trend is that HIV+ subjects are more exposed to developing any kind of neoplasia. the forms of tumour most frequently found are lymphomas and tumours strictly correlated with viral infections or with known carcinogenic substances such as cigarette smoke. the nasopharyngeal carcinoma is another tumour associated with viral infection, sustained by EBV. a study in the us showed risk of incidence of around 2.4 higher in HIV+ subjects than in non-infected subjects. patients infected by HIV are more predisposed to developing basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the cutis 5 76. subjects with clear skin and excessive exposure to the sun have a higher risk of developing cutaneous carcinomas. KS is an angioproliferative disorder involving spindle cells. ogenesis was not in conflict with the co-existence of HHV-8 infection. the KS originates as a polyclonal expansion and then follows a monoclonal development 79. KS may present with 10 variations: patches, plaque, nodular, lymphadenopathic, exophytic, infiltrative, keloidal and cavernous or lymphangioma-like. the most frequently involved sub-sites are: hard and soft palate, gingiva and back of the tongue. the most frequently involved sub-sites are: hard and soft palate, gingiva and back of the tongue; it may present with a single or multiple localisation 30 81. the clinical course is highly varied, with the possibility of mild forms with gradual progression or fulminating forms. atrophic candidiasis, erythroplakia, pyogenic granuloma, bacillary angiomatosis, median rhomboid glossitis, hemangioma and lymphoma. NHL is recognised as an AIDS-defining condition 71. the spectrum of AIDS-correlated NHL includes systemic lymphoma, primitive lymphoma of the central nervous system and two rare entities. the primary effusion lymphoma has been associated with HHV-8, while plasmablastic lymphoma has been associated with EBV. this latter virus has also been associated with the aggressive Burkitt lymphoma, with the large cell lymphoma and with the immunoblastic lymphoma. Manifestations of HIV in the ENT area are present in approximately 40% of the infected young children population 88. oral candidiasis is the most common form of mucous cutaneous HIV in the paediatric population, involving around 60-75% of symptomatic patients. perinatal HIV infection represents a definite risk factor of hearing loss in the paediatric population. a lymphoma that develops in a rhinosinusal site may appear as acute rhinosinusitis, rather than chronic, because of its rapid growth 5 88. masses in the head and neck area are very common in the HIV+ paediatric population. disease of the salivary glands associated with HIV has high prevalence in africa and in Latin America, especially in the paediatric population 19. a fall was seen of 10-50% in oral manifestations, especially candidiasis. in both the USA and in the united kingdom, however, an increase was reported for oral verrucas. intraoral lesions are confined to small groups, mainly to the keratinised mucosa (gums, hard palate, dorsal surface of the tongue) after the blisters burst the ulcers are painful and in HIV+ subjects can last for as long as several weeks. the presence of OHL is not always an indication of rapid progression towards full-blown AIDS in the absence of antiviral treatment. it is proportional to the level of deterioration of the CD4+ count 18 24. a new state of EBV infection has been found, with concomitant expression of replicant and transforming proteins. extensive oral mycotic colonisation was found in 81.1% of cases. resistance to antimycotic treatment was also found 29. erythematous candidiasis appears as small reddish depapillated areas on the palate and dorsal surface of the tongue. the most recent data shows that the sub-class Th17 of the T-helpers plays an important role in controlling the virulence of the fungus. it seems that this strengthening of virulence of Candida is partly induced by the bond between the fungus and HIV or to a protein induced by HIV, such as the GP160 found in the mantle of the virus. vitis from HIV is constituted from a red band affecting the gingival margin. it is constituted from a red band affecting the gingival margin and may affect both adults and young children. hyperemia is caused by vasoactive action of cytokines. an initial sign of HIV infection may be hypertrophy of the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer\u2019s ring. these tissues constitute one of the main sites of replication of the virus. increased lymphoid mass may simulate a neoplastic picture, so a biopsy is often required. the clinical picture of sinusitis in HIV+ subjects does not differ from that of the common population. in infected subjects, various factors may contribute to the onset of rhinosinusitis. if the immune defence is compromised, patients become more susceptible to opportunistic infections 42. nasal involvement appears as a common rhinitis with nasal obstruction and epistaxis. disease may progress to affect other muco-cutaneous tissues with ulcerations and serious mutilation of the face. disseminated histoplasmosis is very widespread in south America. in HIV+ subjects there is special interest in laryngeal tuberculosis. there is special interest in laryngeal tuberculosis, inasm as this is a rare disease. angiomatosis is the most frequent cutaneous manifestation, second only to Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. the etiological agent is Rochalimaea or bartonella henselae 50. Frequently there are lymphadenopathies present, especially in the lateral cervical areas. otologic and audio-vestibular manifestations Damage to the auditory apparatus may derive from recurrent common infections or from opportunistic infections. most of the external ear infections found in HIV+ subjects are caused by common micro-organisms. most of the external ear infections are resolved with standard treatment 53. this type of chronic otitis presents with persistent polypoid formation, sometimes destructive of the bone tissue, perforation of the tympanic membrane, otorrhea, otalgia and transmissive or mixed hearing loss. treatment is mainly based on the use of cotrimossazole. subjects with HIV infection in course present rapid worsening of neurosyphilis. patients with HIV encephalopathy can present motor alterations, uncertain gait, lack of balance and difficulty in effecting rapid alternating movements. subjects who complained of subjective vertigo presented oculomotor disorders in 27% of cases, but with caloric test normal. but subjects who complained of vertigo in various stages of the disease presented substantially stable peripheral disorder in the various classes (33.3% in class A, 50% in classes B and C), while in advanced forms of disease (classes B and C) central vestibular damage was much more evident 57 59. lymphoepithelial parotid cyst presents with increased mono- or bilateral volume of the parotids, usually asymptomatic, but sometimes generate pain 5 18 64. lymphoepithelial cyst is a benign form and seems to originate from the peri- and intraparotid lymph nodes. this manifestation is closely correlated to diffuse lymphadenopathy. the common trend is that HIV+ subjects are more exposed to developing any kind of neoplasia. the forms of tumour most frequently found are lymphomas and tumours strictly correlated with viral infections or with known carcinogenic substances such as cigarette smoke. the nasopharyngeal carcinoma is another tumour associated with viral infection, sustained by EBV. a study in the us showed risk of incidence of around 2.4 higher in HIV+ subjects than in non-infected subjects, both for the keratinising form and the non-keratinising form 65. patients infected by HIV are more predisposed to developing basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the cutis 5 76. patients with clear skin and excessive exposure to the sun have a higher risk of developing cutaneous carcinomas. KS is an angioproliferative disorder involving spindle cells. this pathogenesis was not in conflict with the co-existence of HHV-8 infection. however, the theory was not taken up nor confirmed by subsequent studies. the KS originates as a polyclonal expansion and follows a monoclonal development 79. angiectatic, ecchymotic, keloidal and cavernous or lymphangioma-like 77 80. symptomatology is variable, from almost asymptomatic forms to more serious forms with pain, bleeding, difficulty in chewing, dysphagia and serious cosmetic disfigurements 82. rapidly progressive facial lymphedema associated with extensive, advanced OKS is an indication of the worst prognosis. NHL is recognised as an AIDS-defining condition 71. atrophic candidiasis, erythroplakia, pyogenic granuloma, bacillary angiomatosis, median rhomboid glossitis, hemangioma and lymphoma. risk of developing a NHL is estimated to be 1.6% per annum of HIV infection 71. the risk, calculated as 19%, is also present in subjects undergoing HAART. HL is the most common non-AIDS-defining malignant neoplasia in HIV+ subjects. Manifestations of HIV in the ENT area are present in 40% of the infected young children population 88. oral candidiasis is the most common form of mucous cutaneous HIV in the paediatric population, involving around 60-75% of symptomatic paediatric patients. a lymphoma that develops in a rhinosinusal site may appear as acute rhinosinusitis, rather than chronic, because of its rapid growth 5 88. lateral cervical adenopathies and parotid hypertrophy are frequently found, presenting in approximately 30% of infected young children. antiretroviral drugs are divided into three main categories: inhibitors of viral reverse transcriptase, drugs which inhibit viral proteases and agents which interfere with entry of the virus. some mycetes can present resistance to antimycotics in subjects with HIV+. non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors block the replication cycle of the virus at the point of DNA RNA-dependent synthesis. protease inhibitors include: saquinavir, ritonavir, tipranavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir and darunavir. common infections (otitis and rhinosinusitis, oral candidiasis) need not arouse suspicion of the otorhinolaryngologist. protraction of the infection and recurrence, together with a careful anamnesis in identifying a possible risk group, may lead to a correct diagnosis. tubercular localisations in the cervical facial area are currently being seen as primary forms (first clinical expression of the disease), both at a lymph node level and at the level of the upper airways. the most frequent localisation at the head and neck level is that of the lymph nodes, which constitute 70-90% of tubercular peripheral adenopathies and 95% of the cases of relevance to ENT. hematic or lymphatic means may start from a misunderstood source (aspect of primary localisation) or from an already known source (pulmonary by hematogenous means, mucous by lymphatic means) the rarities of the localisations might be determined by related resistance to this mucosa, caused by mucociliary clearance and richness of the lymphatic tissue. laryngeal (and hypopharyngeal) localisation This was the most widespread laryngeal pathology at the beginning of the 20th century. it presents clinically with non-specific signs, but its infectiousness requires rapid diagnosis and medical treatment. tubercular otitis is a rare disease, constituting only less than 1% of chronic diseases of the ear 2. it is often diagnosed extremely late, because of its low prevalence and its insidious, non-specific clinical signs 10. the disease can develop towards osteitis, with the appearance of complications such as petrositis, paralysis of the VII cranial nerve and labyrinthitis 3. tubercular disease at the auricular level must be suspected in the presence of facial paralysis associated with non-colesteatomatous chronic otitis media 3. the symptomatology caused by the tubercular localisations is non-specific, including mucopurulent and sanguinous rhinorrhea. neoplastic lesions and Wegener granulomatosis 9. Differential diagnosis must be made with neoplastic lesions and with Wegener granulomatosis 9. Nasopharyngeal localisation is more frequent than that of the nasal fossa. in this case too it may be possible to find hyperemia and diffuse hyperplasia of the mucosa or a pseudotumorous mass. microscopic examination of the material permits identification of the bacilli, after suitable staining which highlights alcohol-acid resistance. negative result cannot be interpreted as definite negativity, while positive result allows diagnosis of mycobacterial infection but not of tuberculosis. the next step is identification of the mycobacterium with different types of tests (molecular tests, chromatography, radiometric tests) bacterium bovis BCG are intrinsically resistant to pyrazinamide, one of the main, first choice antitubercular drugs 7,8. these molecular techniques, however, do not make it possible to obtain an antibiogram, for which culture examination is necessary anyway 3. image diagnostics enables highlighting of important findings, none of them pathognomonic. there are currently reported 400,000 cases of multiresistant TBs. antituberculosis drugs are distinguished on the basis of antimycobacterial strength, evidence of effectiveness, use in clinical practice and pharmacological classification in order of the following succession according to the WHO. fazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem/cilastatin-meropenem, clarithromycin, thiacetazone. induction therapy with 4 or 5 antibiotics for a period of 2-3 months. a further period of 5-6 months (after culture exam becomes negative) with isoniazid + rifampicin with or without ethambutol. non tuberculous or atypical mycobacteria are microorganisms present in all geographical areas. more than 170 species are known 24 but only 20 of these are capable of acquiring pathogenic strength for humans 25. they are distinguished from tuberculous mycobacteria by their bacteriological and epidemiological characteristics. tuberculous mycobacterium Non tuberculous mycobacterium Habitat Obligatory parasite Ubiquitous (water-soil-animals-food) Virulence Pathogen Opportunistic Contagion Human/human Environmental Epidemiology Familiar TB contacts Absence of TB contacts Site Supraclavicular, posterior cervical Angulo-mandibular upper anterior cervical Evolution Slow Faster Cutis involvement Infrequent Infrequent but 10 times more frequent than TB mycobacterium tuberculosis complex M. bovis M. africanum M. microti M. canetti M. leprae Rapid growth non tuberculous mycobacteria M. fortuitum complex M. fortuitum M. peregrinum M. porcinum M. chelonae M. abscessus subspecies massiliense M. abscessus subspecies bolletii M. abscess atypical mycobacteria cause 4 main clinical syndromes in humans. avium/intracellulare, kansasi, xenopi, fortuitum and haemophilum. atypical mycobacteria cause 4 main clinical syndromes in humans. the common entrance door is represented by cutaneous abrasions and penetrating trauma. it involves typically infections resulting from trauma occurring in the swimming pool or wounds in water 37 38. high incidence is also reported in subjects undergoing plastic surgery, including operations on the face. clinical suspicion of infection may be given greater value by certain anamnestic data, such as exposure to water, for example swimming pool or bathing. another indication could come from lack of response to common anti-staphylococcus and/or anti-streptococcus antibiotics, if administered, and negative culture test for common germs, if carried out. definite diagnosis requires isolation of atypical mycobacteria in culture from material obtained through biopsy. treatment of infections of cutis and soft tissues from atypical mycobacteria generally requires combination of medical and surgical treatment 44. treatment of infections of the cutis and soft tissues from atypical mycobacteria generally requires a combination of medical and surgical treatment 44. a treatment regimen may also be recommended with antibiotics administered parenterally. if clinical improvement has not been achieved in 4-6 weeks of treatment, it should be checked that the treatment is being observed and if there are potential causes of malabsorption. the addition may also be considered of an anti-streptococcal and anti-staphylococcal antibiotic, for the possibility of over-infection. atypical mycobacteria appear as unilateral lymphadenopathy, hard-elastic, 4 cm in diameter, slowly increasing in volume (several weeks) lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria appear as unilateral lymphadenopathy, hard-elastic, 4 cm in diameter, slowly increasing in volume (several weeks) the overlying cutis gradually changes colour from rosy to violet, becomes thinner until it resembles a parchment and suppurates through the common antibiotics against streptococcus or staphylococcus give no results 28 45. clinical suspicion may be helped by the lack of response to anti-streptococcal and/or anti-staphylococcal antibiotic treatment, the laboratory parameters which are not indicative of acute bacterial infection. peptides have expression both of tuberculous and non tuberculous mycobacteria. the QuantiFERON test, however, will always be negative, since it is specific only in cases of infection from tuberculous mycobacterium. today it is no longer possible to perform the two step Mantoux test. CT shows lymph nodes with reinforced periphery, with central hypodensity 63. definitive etiological diagnosis will only be obtained with isolation of the pathogen germ from culture examination. eria I

Culture negative NTM: non tuberculous mycobacteria; AFB: acid-fast bacilli; PPD: purified protein derivative. the author concluded that surgical removal is a more effective treatment than antibiotics. the surgical approach shows a success index of 96%, compared to the 66% of the antibiotic treatment. however, the type of operation does not seem to affect the rate of recurrence. progressive involvement of the cutis can be seen, which becomes violet in colour, the consistency of papyrus and with subsequent fistulisation in a period of 3-8 weeks. total resolution occurs in 9-12 months in 71% of cases 80. author suggests a waiting approach when localisation is particularly extensive. the damage is almost always temporary and functional recovery over time is greater than 90%. in laterocervical localisations, lesion of the spinal nerve is rarer because of the dimensions of the same and because of less infiltration of surrounding tissue. no neurological damage has been reported in cases treated only with incision 81. only a small percentage showed multiple localisations and other areas of the neck. reddening of the overlying area was present in 25% of cases. it was not reported in the majority of the works taken under examination. aspiration 10 Antibiotic treatment 77 Antibiotic and surgical treatment 101 No treatment 93 The antibiotic used was clarithromycin, almost always associated with rifabutin, ethambutol, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin. duration of treatment was highly variable, between 1 and 10 months This heterogeneity of treatment obviously prevent comparative analysis between the various protocols. the therapeutic scheme must be targeted on the basis of specific isolation, but empirically, while awaiting the culture result, it consists of a scheme of three drugs with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) in combination with ethambutol and rifampicin. the optimal length of treatment for lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria is not known. 73 patients treated with chronic granulomatous cervical lymphadenopathy from suspected infection from non tuberculous mycobacteria. only 45 patients (25 F \u2013 20 M) were considered with certain diagnosis given positivity to culture exam (62%) 28 patients (38%) were excluded with presumed clinical diagnosis. age distribution of children affected from cervical Non Tuberculous Mycobacteria infection recorded at Bambino Ges\u00f9 Hospital in the period 2008-2017. 42 patients underwent surgical operation with a specific treatment with clarithromycin (15 mg/kg) and rifampicin (10 mg/kg) in the stage of preparation for the surgical operation for a variable period of approximately 30 days. 1 case, aged 2 years, with parotid localisation is still in antibiotic treatment after 6 months. in only 2 cases of angulo-mandibular localisation this deficit has not been recovered within the period of 12 months. the surgical scar showed a tendency to enlargement and to keloid only in cases in which initial cutaneous infiltration was greater than 3 cm. infections from NTM represent an emerging disease in which lymph node involvement is prevalent in pediatric age. it is still one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality, with 10.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths in 2015. incidence of the disease has again increased in relation to demographic increase, immune deficiency and precarious living conditions. tubercular localisations in the cervical facial area are currently being seen as primary forms (first clinical expression of the disease) mycobacterium bovis, mycobacterium bovis and mycobacterium africanum 6 7 are etiological agents of bovine TB. the most frequent pathogen agent in cause is mycobacterium tuberculosis. local inoculation occurs by inhalation of bacillifer dust or from scratching. caseous necrosis zones may calcify or even merge, to give a clinical picture of cold abscess. cervical facial clinical manifestations are represented by: Cervical lymphadenopathies These typically affect young subjects, more often of the female sex, the opposite to what is seen in pulmonary forms. auricular localisation Tubercular otitis is a rare disease, constituting only less than 1% of the chronic diseases of the ear 2. it is often diagnosed extremely late, because of its low prevalence and its insidious, non-specific clinical signs 10. symptoms are non-specific, according to the localisation of the lesion. tubercular otitis is characterised by a classic triad consisting of multiple tympanic perforations, serous otorrhea and facial paralysis. otorrhea is usually serous, not associated with pain, except in a small percentage of cases. other clinical signs can appear in connection with loco-regional extension of the disease. tubercular localisations are non-specific, including mucopurulent and sanguinous rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, tubal symptoms 4. there may also be presence of crustiness, diffuse mucosal hyperemia with reddish-brownish fine granulations. there may also be present an exophytic pseudotumorous neoformation, peduncated or sessile, squashy (tuberculoma) in primary forms the clinical picture is that of suppurative sialadenitis or of a tumour-like lesion. secondary forms are usually associated with pulmonary TB 15. a positive result allows diagnosis of mycobacteria but not of tuberculosis. mycobacterium bovis and mycobacterium bovis are intrinsically resistant to pyrazinamide, one of the main, first choice antitubercular drugs 7,8. these molecular techniques, however, do not make it possible to obtain an antibiogram, for which culture examination is necessary anyway 3. if the culture is positive, the next step is identification of the mycobacterium with different types of tests. antituberculosis vaccination in Italy is currently obligatory only in highly selective cases. there are currently reported 400,000 cases of multiresistant TBs. antituberculosis drugs are distinguished on the basis of antimycobacterial strength. ethambutol is a bacteriostatic for both intra- and extracellular bacilli. streptomycin has a bactericide effect only on extracellular ones. ethionamide, prothionamide, cycloserine, terizidone or PAS. guidelines lay down induction therapy with 4 or 5 antibiotics. surgical operation is not indicated except in the event of failure of medical therapy, in the event of development during treatment or in the event of lymph node residues at the end of the same. cervical lymphadenopathies These typically affect young subjects, more often of the female sex, the opposite to what is seen in pulmonary forms. on a clinical level the adenopathy is initially almost always mobile and indolent. auricular localisation Tubercular otitis is a rare disease, constituting only less than 1% of the chronic diseases of the ear 2. it is often diagnosed extremely late, because of its low prevalence and its insidious, non-specific clinical signs 10. tubercular otitis is characterised by a classic triad consisting of multiple tympanic perforations, serous otorrhea and facial paralysis. the disease can develop towards osteitis, with the appearance of complications such as petrositis, paralysis of the VII cranial nerve and labyrinthitis 3. nasal and nasopharyngeal localisations are non-specific, including mucopurulent and sanguinous rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, tubal symptoms 4. there may also be the presence of crustiness, diffuse mucosal hyperemia with reddish-brownish fine granulations (nasal lupus), sometimes ulcerations. lesions appear more often on palatine tonsils with tonsillar hypertrophy or ulceration or exophytic lesion, associated with extremely non-specific symptoms (dysphagia, odynophagia) 2. Salivary localisation Involvement of the salivary glands is exceptional 1 2; lesions may be associated with oral and dental lesions. secondary forms are usually associated with pulmonary TB 15. mycobacterium bovis and mycobacterium bovis are intrinsically resistant to pyrazinamide, one of the main, first choice antitubercular drugs 7,8. these molecular techniques, however, do not make it possible to obtain an antibiogram, for which culture examination is necessary anyway 3. CT images reveal a non-specific picture of chronic otitis media with soft tissue in the cavity of the middle and mastoid ear, which can be either eburnean or antituberculosis vaccination in Italy is currently obligatory only in highly selective cases. new-born babies and young children under the age of 5 years with tuberculin test negative are living with or have close contact with persons afflicted by TB in the contagious stage. rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, streptomycin. ethambutol is a bacteriostatic for both intra- and extracellular bacilli. streptomycin has a bactericide effect only on extracellular ones. surgical treatment becomes necessary for acute or rapidly worsening dyspnea. surgical operation is not indicated except in the event of failure of medical therapy, in the event of development during treatment or in the event of lymph node residues at the end of the same. more than 170 species are known 24 but only 20 of them are capable of acquiring pathogenic strength for humans 25. they are distinguished from tuberculous mycobacteria by their bacteriological and epidemiological characteristics and their different clinical presentation. treatment of the two forms calls for substantially different treatment measures. pathogenic mycobacteria are classified into 2 main groups: those with rapid growth, which grow in culture in one week, and those with slow growth, which take several weeks to grow. the rapid growth group includes mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium hamophilum, Mycobacter contagion occurs through inhalation, direct contact or ingestion. in rare familiar cases there is always a common source present 27. it is also very rare to find contagion from animal to human. extra-pulmonary mycobacterioses affecting the cervical facial area include descriptions of manifestations affecting the cutis and soft tissues, of the thyroid, of the parotid 30 31, of the middle ear 32-35 and of the paranasal sinuses. in this paper we deal exclusively with the pathologies of a cervical-facial presentation and therefore of the superficial lymphadenitis of the cervical-facial area and infections of the cutis and soft tissues. infections from rapid growth mycobacteria may also determine localised cellulitis and/or abscesses with local pictures almost indistinguishable from other bacterial infections. in immunocompromised patients, cutaneous lesions may be disseminated and/or represent the first manifestation of disseminated disease 63. culture is essential for distinguishing between tuberculous and non tuberculous forms. culture is essential for diagnosis of species of atypical mycobacteria causing infection. a histological exam is not always nullifying, since there are generally no pathogenic aspects. ithromycin may be associated with a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin), doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole. treatment regimen should be assessed case by case, on the basis of host-dependent factors and on the basis of the suspected species of mycobacterium. the true incidence of the disease is due to lack of notification that occurs in many countries and the dispersion of the cases in relation to low incidence 11. overall incidence of the disease increased in immunocompetent individuals in the 1980s and 1990s, in parallel with the increase in cases of AIDS 49 50. lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria appear as unilateral lymphadenopathy, hard-elastic, 4 cm in diameter, slowly increasing in volume (several weeks) the overlying cutis gradually changes colour from rosy to violet, becomes thinner until it resembles a parchment and suppurates through the formation of a fistulous passage. the tuberculin skin test (TST) may help, inasmuch as the derivates of purified protein are a heterogeneous group consisting of more than 200 mycobacterial peptides. the derivates of purified protein are a heterogeneous group consisting of more than 200 mycobacterial peptides. however, positivity to this test may result in both cases. lymph nodes with reinforced periphery, with central hypodensity 63. radiography is useful for differential diagnosis with tuberculous or neoplastic etiology. this exam gives a rapid answer (48 h) of positivity to mycobacteria. in many cases, even a simple anatomo-pathological finding of a chronic granulomatous necrotising inflammation associated with a clinical history may prove useful for purposes of diagnosis. itis from streptococcus or staphylococcus, cat scratches from Bartonella henselae, toxoplasmosis, viral infections such as EBV and CMV. malignant lymphadenitis 55,56 should be mentioned and benign cysts (cysts of the thyroglossal duct) should be mentioned. removal of the package of lymph nodes may be attributed to selective functional emptying of the level, or levels, affected in a single piece, together with the associated cutaneous lesion, if present. however, the type of operation does not seem to affect the rate of recurrence, as long as all the tissue that is macroscopically affected is removed 78. a percentage of lesions to the marginal nerve is reported which varies from 24% of Gonzales 15 to 5% of Claesson 81. lesion of the spinal nerve is rarer because of the dimensions of the same and because of less infiltration of surrounding tissue. the 13 publications looked at 54 56 74 76 82-88 included a total of 691 young children with an average age of 34,15 months. total patients 691 Sex Males Females 286 (41.4%) 405 (58.6%) Mean age 34.15 months Localisation Submandibular Latero-cervical Parotid Pre-auricular Others 323 249 47 44 28 Mycobacteria M. avium/intracellulare M. hae Surgical treatment was reported in 12 out of the 13 works studied. Lymphadenectomy was carried out on 356 patients. complications described mainly concern paralysis of the facial nerve. 91.3% of patients presented a spontaneous fistulisation between the third and eighth week of observation. at a distance of two years it was still possible to note a scar in the area of the neck where it occurred. the limit of this work is that it is an observational study without comparison with other treatments. the optimal length of treatment for lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria is not known and patients are treated up to symptomatological resolution, commonly from three to six months. there is no standard definition of treatment failure in the case of lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria, but treatment failed in the event of failed symptomatological resolution within six months. in 10 cases a pre-operative diagnosis was possible, after having carried out a culture exam on pus samples from the lesion. in the remaining 36 the clinical diagnosis was confirmed on biological material removed None of the patients had immune deficiency. 42 patients underwent surgical operation with a specific treatment with clarithromycin. 1 case, aged 2 years, with parotid localisation is still in antibiotic treatment after 6 months. selective drainage was always carried out at the level affected, including the area of cutaneous infiltration. in 50% of cases, there was a deficiency in the marginal branch of the facial nerve. in only 2 cases of angulo-mandibular localisation this deficit has not been recovered within the period of 12 months. the lymph node lesion will have progressed its clinical stage with progressive extension and cutaneous involvement. if the disease is particularly extensive, the only solution is lengthy antibiotic treatment associated with a possible curettage of the lesion. the patients should be considered case by case, while seeking to succeed in shortening the length of the disease and reducing morbidity to a minimum. infections from rapid growth mycobacteria may also determine localised cellulitis and/or abscesses with local pictures almost indistinguishable from other bacterial infections. in immunocompromised patients, cutaneous lesions may be disseminated and/or represent the first manifestation of disseminated disease 63. isolation of atypical mycobacteria in culture is essential for distinguishing between tuberculous and non tuberculous forms, for diagnosis of species of atypical mycobacteria causing infection. culture is essential for distinguishing between tuberculous and non tuberculous (atypical) forms, for diagnosis of species of atypical mycobacteria causing infection, when possible. azithromycin or clarithromycin may be associated with one of the following antibiotics. a treatment regimen should be assessed case by case, on the basis of host-dependent factors and on the basis of the suspected species of mycobacterium. a combined treatment can be set up, with at least two drugs to which the isolated species is known to be susceptible 47. in the last few decades incidence of the disease has increased in immunocompetent individuals, even if it is not clear whether that represents a true increase. the entry route of the germ is not always detectable with certainty, but it is often suspected to be at the base of the localisation of the disease. lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria appear as unilateral lymphadenopathy, hard-elastic, 4 cm in diameter, slowly increasing in volume (several weeks) the overlying cutis gradually changes colour from rosy to violet, becomes thinner until it resembles a parchment and suppurates through the formation of a fistulous passage. the tuberculin skin test (TST) may help, inasmuch as the

surgical removal is 90%, compared to less than 20% after incision and curettage 80. a percentage of lesions to the marginal nerve is reported which varies from 24% of Gonzales 15 to 5% of Claesson 81. the damage is almost always temporary and functional recovery over time is greater than 90%. the 13 publications looked at 54 56 74 76 82-88 included a total of 691 young children with an average age

Mycobacteria M. avium/intracellulare M. hae only in 25% of cases (170 patients) was it decided to proceed with antibiotic treatment alone or a period of observation. an operation of incision and drainage or needle aspiration of the purulent secretions was reported in 64 patients. complications described mainly concern paralysis of the facial nerve. 91.3% of patients presented a spontaneous fistulisation between the third and eighth week of observation. at a distance of two years it was still possible to note a scar in the area of the neck where it occurred. adenitis from non tuberculous mycobacteria should be taken into consideration. the optimal length of treatment for lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria is not known and patients are treated up to symptomatological resolution. there is no standard definition of treatment failure in the case of lymphadenitis from atypical mycobacteria. there is no standard definition of treatment failure in the case of lymphadenitis from

carried out a culture exam on pus samples from the lesion. in the remaining 36 the clinical diagnosis was confirmed on biological material removed None of the patients had immune deficiency. 1 case, aged 2 years, with parotid localisation is still in antibiotic treatment after 6 months. selective drainage was always carried out at the level affected, including the area of cutaneous infiltration. in 50% of cases of parotid and angulo-mandibular localisation, there was a deficiency in the marginal branch of the facial nerve. the lymph node lesion will have progressed its clinical stage with progressive extension and cutaneous involvement. this puts the surgical operation more at risk of iatrogenic lesions of the facial nerve, with the need for more extensive removal of the affected cutaneous area. the only solution is lengthy antibiotic treatment associated with a possible curettage of the lesion. lymph node biopsy may be useful for investigating the disease of the lymph node. intensity and characteristics of the lymph node alterations depend on the type of etiological agent causing them, its manner of action and the subject\u2019s reactivity. in general, hyperplastic phenomena of lymphatic tissue or a granulomatous aspect are the most prevalent. cellosis, sarcoidosis, berylliosis, histoplasmosis, etc.; necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis without infiltration by granulocytes, correlated with disease of unknown cause, such as KFD. Morphological picture Characteristics Correlated diseases Piringer-Kuchinka lymphadenitis Hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissue with dissemination of epithelioid cells isolated or in small groups the otorhinolaryngologist is often called on in the diagnostic stage of a lymphadenopathy of which the nature has yet to be established. granulomatous lymphadenitis with cervical localisation may be separated into non-infectious forms (which are not included in this treatise) granulomatous lymphadenitis with cervical localisation may be separated into non-infectious forms (which are not included in this treatise) granulomatous lymphadenopathies, in the picture of cervical lymph node disease, represent an estimated overall share of between 6% and 15% 2,3. the presence of lymphadenopathies in some anatomical regions appears to correlate with greater risk of malignant disease. cervical lymphadenopathy consists in most cases of high fever, feeling generally unwell, arthralgia and localised or generalized cutaneous manifestations. each patient must undergo a full, systematic inspection, aimed at identification of every adenopathy that can be felt to be present. the presence of pain and tension are signs that are scarcely specific, mainly correlated with an underlying inflammatory situation. the first choice exam in assessing a cervical adenopathy is echography, keeping CT and MRI in reserve for cases of suspect concomitant involvement of the chest and abdomen or for cases of suspect neoplasia. FNAC is a simple, safe procedure featuring elevated sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of lymph node metastasis and providing good accuracy in diagnosing granulomatous lymphadenopathy. figures 7.2 and 7.3 show decisional algorithms for cervical lymphadenopathy diagnostics in young children 5. algorithm for diagnosis and evaluation of pediatric patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy suspicious to mononucleosis-like syndrome. the following is the presentation of the most common causes of granulomatous lymphadenopathies of an infectious nature. granulomatous nodules can be seen, which progress into purulent colliquation. the disease may cause death of the patient or present frequent recurrence. the diagnosis is based on cultural isolation of the parasite in biological materials (expectorate, blood, exudates) angiomatous manifestations are possible, both cutaneous (in differential diagnosis with KS) or hepatic, as well as feverish recurrent forms with bacteriemia 8-10. the infection is resolved mainly spontaneously, but over periods that are not short (2-4 months) Brucellae have tropism with histiocytary cells, inside of which they resist the phagocytes. they multiply to form granulomas of tubercular appearance within the regional lymph nodes and organs that are rich in histiocytary cells. the diagnosis is based on cultural isolation of the parasite in biological material (blood or, in the event of negative blood culture, by examining bone marrow samples from sternal puncture) the non-sporulated oocyst is formed in the intestinal epithelium of infected cats and expelled through the faeces. sporulation occurs after expulsion; sporulation occurs after expulsion. human can also be infected by ingestion of meat contaminated by cysts. infectious mononucleosis mononucleosis is an infection sustained by the Epstein Barr DNA virus. the virus replicates and can give rise to a persistent infection which may even last for several years. the disease is accompanied by the presence of a malodorous, whitish grey exudate. mononucleosis generally requires only treatment of symptomatic support. glucocorticoids are only used for reducing size of the pharynx swelling 17. there is no evidence of significant benefit from clinical practice of treatment. rheumatic disease is the primary cause of acquired cardiac disease in infancy 19. diagnosis may be made on the fourth day of the disease. patients with fever persisting for 5 days but with less than 4 diagnostic criteria may be diagnosed when coronary disease is shown. lymph nodes are mostly hard, not fluctuating and not painful. the overlying cutis is generally not reddened. treatment of KD carriers in acute stage aims at prevention of onset of coronary disease. generalised lymphadenopathy is an infrequent occurrence (5% of cases); extranodal involvement is rare. most frequent initial symptom is fever, present in 30-50% of afflicted subjects. other symptoms, such as tiredness, skin rash and hepatosplenomegaly may be present. oculoglandular (penetration through the conjunctiva), ganglionic ulcer (penetration through the cutis) disease can spread through hematic routes and generalise in various organs and tissues. if not treated properly, the disease may cause death of the patient or present frequent recurrence. the most common morbid form is a chronic granulomatous lymphadenopathy. in typical form it starts with formation of a papule at the point of inoculation. within a few days this papule develops into a pustule accompanied by a consistent regional adenopathy and, in 30-40% of cases, high fever. the appearance of cervical adenopathies is more frequent than what can be seen after infection arising from contact with animals (83 vs 63%) 11. brucellosis has a long incubation period, at the time of appearance of the first symptoms there may already be an elevated presence of antibodies. toxoplasma gondii is a family of parasitic endocellular protozoi. it involves a sporogonic stage in the final host and an asexual stage in intermediate hosts, including in humans. sporulation occurs after expulsion; sporulation occurs after expulsion. in cases of acquired immune deficiency there is the possibility of meningoencephalitis from Toxoplasma gondii, caused by uncontrolled replication of the protozoi. necrosis of the surrounding cerebral tissue as far as coma and death, and ocular forms (chorioretinitis) in about 50% of cases the disease is accompanied by the presence of a malodorous, whitish grey exudate from the palatine tonsils. it may be accompanied by various types of complication, from the appearance of morbilliform exanthems localised in the trunk to icterus. KD is characterised by fever, bilateral non exudative conjunctivitis, widespread erythema of the oral and labial mucosa, modifications of the extremities, rash and cervical adenopathies. rheumatic disease is the primary cause of acquired cardiac disease in infancy 19. laterocervical adenopathy is the least common of the main diagnostic criteria. the classic criteria require the presence of one or more lymph nodes with diameter > 1.5 cm. lymph nodes are mostly hard, not fluctuating and not painful, the overlying cutis is generally not reddened. FD has low incidence, estimated between 0.5 and 5% of all cases of adenopathies evaluated histologically. it involves the cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes in almost all cases (74-90%) 22. the adenopathies typically have dimensions no greater than 3 cm. the first paragraph of the clinical practice guideline on treatment of sinusitis makes it clear how much attention is being paid to rhinosinusal phlogistic disease in pediatric age. in this age group, infectious rhinitis is more easily capable of influencing complications to the detriment of the paranasal sinuses and, in the first three years of life, of the paranasal sinus with modified function. a percentage between 5 and 10 per cent of children afflicted by URI will develop an acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. a study from a few years ago estimated the cost of treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis in the USA to amount to 5.8 billion dollars in 1996. not all paranasal sinuses are well developed at birth. in 85% of children its pneumatization is visible on CT at the age of 8 years 7. a prospective epidemiological study followed the case histories of one hundred healthy children. it was not the dimensions of the sinuses, but the season that influenced radiological evidence of an episode of catarrh. in the first five years of life there is a highly significant difference in the prevalence of URI in children who attend nursery school than in those who enter the community later. a chronic rhinosinusitis process compared with a rhino-adenoiditis of early infancy. the inflammatory process is represented by a viral rhinitis using inflammation of the mucosa to induce an edema with related congestion of the sinusal ostium. the result is less ventilation of the sinuses, which is added natural reduced ciliary activity of the respiratory epithelium. most authors agree in considering adenoid volume as a less significant factor than bacterial load 12,13. some authors stress the correlation between the level of lymphatic hypertrophy and the disease of the maxillary sinus. adenoid volume is found in 34% of patients with significant adenoid volume and in only 13% of patients with normotrophic adenoids 14. endoscopic nasal examination confirmed the presence of purulent-like secretion of the middle meatus (indication of rhinosinusitis) in 89.2% of cases, which was isolated in 80.8%. in 7% of the children the catarrhal secretion wetted only the nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue (adenoiditis without sinusitis) traditional flat x-rays are not suitable for evaluating patients with acute rhinosinusitis. even CT, which represents the most suitable examination for diagnosis of rhinosinusitis, is not suitable for diagnosis of forms without complications. 80% of patients with banal episode of URI present with radiological anomalies, which are absolutely not significant in a clinical sense. studies have not yet been conducted on pediatric patients. assumption of amoxicillin is recommended, or alternatively cephalosporin. administration of macrolides should be reserved for patients with known allergy to beta-lactams. complications of an ARS may involve the orbit (optic neuritis, periorbital cellulitis, orbital abscess), the central nervous system (meningitis, subdural and epineural empyema, cerebral abscess, venous sinus thrombosis) or the bone (maxillary osteitis, frontal osteitis) they are classified in accordance with the scheme suggested by Chandler 19 20 into: preseptal diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age is made more difficult by the overlapping of symptoms compared with other common diseases capable of causing nasal obstruction in this age group. adenoid vegetations, chronic forms of adenoiditis, allergic rhinitis 10 and cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and post nasal drip. comorbidity relationship between asthma and CRS is definite. positivity to allergy tests was present in a percentage not dissimilar to that of the general population. 80% of patients studied through spirometry testing and detection of inflammation markers in the liquid from nasal irrigation. steroid therapy is considered the first line for chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age. local steroid therapy is considered the first line for chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age. authors find comfort in the use of bacterial lysates 29. the candidates for endoscopic surgery of paranasal sinuses are those children presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. other treatment procedures taking into account age, predisposing factors and comorbidity may be useful before turning to the solution of surgery. ESS therefore represents the last resort in treatment of rhinosinusitis. post-operative therapy includes antibiotics taken orally, nasal decongestants and topical steroids. in children it is necessary to perform a check under anesthetic after two weeks following the operation, in order to remove fibrin and encrustations that would encourage formation of synechiae. the first studies on the role of adenoidectomy in treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis were published by Rosenfield 33. the first step was represented by appropriate medical treatment followed by adenoidectomy and by ESS as the final step to fall back on. 77% of children undergoing adenoidectomy progress towards symptomatological resolution, compared to a lower percentage of patients undergoing adenoidectomy alone. polyp is found in the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses, with hypopneumatization of the frontal and sphenoid. the lateral wall of the nasal fossae shows bulging of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus, with decalcification of the uncinate process. two main indications exist for endoscopic sinus surgery 34,35 in cystic fibrosis. the stage of deep neutropenia following transplant favours the local growth of fungal hyphae. there are no effective antifungal prophylaxis schemes for patients with acute leukemia under induction chemotherapy. fluconazole prophylaxis in doses of 400 mg/die has proved useful in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant. acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age are notably prevalent, correlated with frequency of viral rhinitis and the condition of physiological immaturity of the immune system. ARS is a self-limiting disease, but antibiotic treatment is encoded in international guidelines, in order to accelerate healing times. the majority of patients respond to an adequate medical therapy. complications from otomastoiditis involve around 80% of cases in pediatric age, as reported by Singh et al. 38. in pre-antibiotic times, acute mastoiditis was associated with mortality rates of around 50% 39. mastoid empyema must be suspected in the case of otalgia and otorrhea persisting for at least two weeks or in the case of recurrence of symptoms after a period of remission of 7-10 days. the retroauricular crease is considered the pathognomonic finding, allowing differential diagnosis with retroauricular lymphadenitis or complicated external otitis. bezold\u2019s pseudo-mastoiditis, with propagation inside the sheath of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with consequent stiff neck. Mouret\u2019s jugulodigastric node mastoiditis, caused by deep exteriorisation at the level of the jugulodigastric triangle, characterised by parapharyngeal or retrostyloid abscesses. in 30% of adult individuals a marked pneumatisation may be seen of the apex of the petrous bone. in these cases, the osteitis processes spread to the cellularity of the apex. in these cases, the osteitis processes spread to the cellularity of the apex. in the last two decades there has been an epidemiological decline, linked to vaccination for the most severe pathogens. in the past Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were responsible for most of the infections. over the age of 2 years, this complication runs concurrently with predisposing factors. epidural or extradural abscess is a coalescent collection of pus encircled by adherences from the dura mater. most frequent localisation is the middle cranial fossa and the condition is frequently diagnosed in association with thrombosis of the lateral sinus. there are no specific clinical signs for this disease, which only leads to neurological signs in the case of ample extension and compression. rachicentesis and cranial CT scan to allow differential diagnosis with cerebral abscess, cerebritis, subdural empyema. the decisive diagnostic exams are rachicentesis and cranial CT scan to allow differential diagnosis with cerebral abscess, cerebritis, subdural empyema. the critical clinical elements to look for are intense headache, nausea, fever and cervical rigidity. it is not rare to find the Griesinger sign, characterised by erythema and edema immediately posteriorly to the mastoid process. the pathognomonic sign is represented by \u201cempty delta\u201d where the contrast outlines the coagulation as a triangular filling defect. the therapeutic approach to otogenic thrombosis of the lateral sinus is still subject to debate. the criteria for inclusion taken into consideration were pediatric age (0-16 years), otomastoiditis complicated by thrombosis of lateral sinus confirmed by radiological exams and availability of exhaustive clinical data. the analysis took into consideration the following independent variables: age, sex, presence and type of genetic mutations/variations favouring thrombophilia, alterations at coagulation tests, type of inflammation trigger. otomastoiditis complicated by thrombosis of the lateral sinus made a total of 25 ears. on clinical debut mean age was 63 33 months, (range = 6-139 months) 8/24 patients showed exclusively otologic signs and symptoms, in the absence of neurologic involvement. trigger inflammatory event was acute otomastoiditis in 9 cases (36%) and chronic in 16 (64%) lapse between onset of symptoms and start of anticoagulant therapy was a mean of 8 6 days (range = 1-30 days) at radiological control at one month, recanalisation of the sinus was verified in 44% of cases (11/25). the exact Fisher test did not show a significant association between recanalisation and sex (p = 0.434), trigger event (acute or chronic otomastoiditis; p = 0.434), high or low otogenic thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus was detected in 92% of cases. all patients start anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin (100 U/kg), administered subcutaneously, associated with broad spectrum antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment intravenously 47. the use of low molecular weight heparin is particularly suited to cases that present with surgical indications. term mastoid infections has produced a perisinusal inflammatory impairment. this result suggests the importance of early diagnosis and treatment as a factor capable of affecting the result. the presence of marked neurologic signs at start is also associated with lower probability of resolution, determining greater severity and extension of the picture. in pediatric patients it represents the most frequent laryngeal neoplasia and the second cause of dysphonia, after the vocal nodes. papillomatous lesions may be found at the level of the nasal vestibule, the soft palate, the trachea and the main bronchi. m of HPV with the squamous epithelia manifests with anomalous activation of the EGF and consequent exophytic growth of papillomatous formations 53. an important role appears to be played also by an anomalous function of the T-cells on the part of the host during pregnancy and childbirth. traumas compete in worsening the picture of the disease and encouraging its extralaryngeal spread 54. the form with high aggressiveness has early onset (before 2-3 years of age), with the need for more than 40 interventions, increase in mortality rate and possible need for tracheotomy 57. if possible tracheotomy and intubation are to be avoided as they have, as a consequence, greater risk of tracheobronchial diffusion. in 2004, 59 60 classifies the disease in relation to its severity, extension and extra-laryngeal diffusion. it is also a tool for assessment of progression, response to treatment and post-operative follow-up, as well as trying to predict the time lapse between surgical interventions. none of the possible treatments currently available are effective in eradicating recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. vaporisation by means of CO2 Laser ensures greater efficacy and precision in treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis. the microdebrider was brought into use in pediatric laryngeal surgery. the method is coupled with completion of treatment of lesions using radiofrequency Cold Ablation (Fig. 8.12) the antiviral that is currently most used in treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis is certainly cidofovir. the drug is used by topic injection at the level of papillomatous lesions, both before and after the debulking procedure. the results described are positive, with reduction in the number and frequency of recurrences and in aggressiveness, up to cases of full remission from disease. the breakthrough in the battle against RRP came in 2006. papillomatosis in pediatric age is a disease with an unpredictable course, potentially fatal and difficult to treat. papillomatosis in pediatric age is a disease with an unpredictable course, potentially fatal and difficult to treat. there is no unequivocal and 100% effective therapy. the number of infections in childhood is distinctly higher (from seven to ten episodes of viral rhinitis) than what is seen in adult ages. the number of infections in childhood is distinctly higher (from seven to ten episodes of viral rhinitis) than what is seen in adult ages (from two to five episodes) a study from a few years ago estimated the cost of treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis in the USA to amount to 5.8 billion dollars in 1996. the maxillary sinuses and ethmoidal chambers already become pneumatized at the 3rd-4th month of embryonic life. the ethmoid expands rapidly in the first seven years of life and completes its development at around 15-16 years. a prospective study by bagetsch 9 found that in the first five years of life there is a highly significant difference in the prevalence of URI in children who attend nursery school than in those who enter the community later. there is a progressive decrease in prevalence of acute rhinosinusitis after 6-8 years, correlated with maturity of the immune defense systems. in pediatric age, greater incidence of infections affecting the URI and the significant role played by the adenoidal vegetation in determining a condition of dysventilation lead to easier obstruction of the sinusal ostia. the beginning of an inflammatory process is almost always represented by a viral rhinitis using inflammation of the mucosa to induce an edema with related congestion of the sinusal ostium. the consequence is less ventilation of the sinuses, to which is added natural in early infancy the inflammatory process involves more or less widely all the paranasal sinuses, as witness to the predisposing role played by immune immaturity. in later infancy, the sinusal involvement is usually just on one side, as a consequence of ostiomeatal obstruction caused, as in adults, by an anatomical disease element. in 7% of the children the catarrhal secretion wetted only the nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue (adenoiditis without sinusitis) a review of acute rhinosinusitis in children proposes the use of two major criteria or of one major criterium and two minor ones, lasting at least 10 days. 80% of patients with a banal episode of URI present with radiological anomalies, which are absolutely not significant in a clinical sense. 80% of patients with a banal episode of URI present with radiological anomalies, which are absolutely not significant in a clinical sense. but even CT, which represents the most suitable examination for diagnosis of rhinosinusitis, is not suitable for diagnosis of forms without complications. treatment should be commenced with high dosage of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. levofloxacin, once reserved only for adults, is used today also in pediatric ages, when severity of the clinical picture recommends it. an ARS, frequent especially in immunocompromised patients, may involve the orbit (optic neuritis, periorbital cellulitis, orbital abscess), the central nervous system (meningitis, subdural and epineural empyema, cerebral abscess, venous sinus thrombosis) they are classified into: preseptal cellulitis; orbital cellulitis; subperiosteal abscess; orbital abs a surprising statistic emerges, showing suffering even higher than what is caused by chronic diseases such as asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy and even rheumatoid arthritis. the impact of CRS on the quality of life of young patients is extremely negative. 80% of patients afflicted with GERD were treated with spirometry tests. GERD was detected in 63% of patients afflicted with GERD. recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis is the most common mode of clinical presentation of a variable common immune deficiency. local steroid therapy is considered the first line for chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age. in prevention of recurrence of acute episodes, some Authors find comfort in the use of bacterial lysates 29. in addition to reduction of episodes of inflammatory re-acutization, an increased resistance to macrolides has actually been recorded. the candidates for endoscopic surgery of paranasal sinuses are those children presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. other treatment procedures taking into account age, predisposing factors and comorbidity may be useful before turning to the solution of surgery. ESS therefore represents the last resort in treatment of rhinosinusitis. es to be studied in axial, coronal and sagittal projections can provide high precision and relative safety in reaching zones surgically difficult to approach. relying on this type of investigation is preferable in cases where frequent radiological checks are necessary. post-operative therapy includes the use of antibiotics taken orally, nasal decongestants and topical steroids. the first step was represented by appropriate medical treatment followed by adenoidectomy and by ESS as the final step to fall back on. 77% of children undergoing ESS progress towards symptomatological resolution, compared to a lower percentage (47%) of patients undergoing adenoidectomy alone. adenoidectomy enables resolution of the CRS in 50% of cases. two main indications exist for endoscopic sinus surgery 34,35 in cystic fibrosis. the first is the necessity to remove polypoid formations, which in the majority of these patients occupy massively the nasal fossae, thus restoring nasal permeability. the second indication arises from the observation that the paranasal sinuses, and particularly the maxillary sinuses, may represent a sort of reservoir for germs which remain confined in an anaer ia following transplant favours the local growth of fungal hyphae, in the absence of the phagocyte function of the neutrophils. there are no effective antifungal prophylaxis schemes for patients with acute leukemia under induction chemotherapy. fluconazole prophylaxis in doses of 400 mg/die has proved useful in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant. early diagnosis is of fundamental importance in avoiding complications linked to orbital and intracranial invasion. acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age are notably prevalent, correlated with frequency of viral rhinitis and the condition of physiological immaturity of the immune system. ARS is a self-limiting disease, but antibiotic treatment is encoded in international guidelines, in order to accelerate healing times. the majority of patients respond to an adequate medical therapy. the presence of purulent-like secretion of the middle meatus in 89.2% of cases was associated with adenoiditis in 19.2% of cases. the catarrhal secretion wetted only the nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue (adenoiditis without sinusitis) in 7% of the children the catarrhal secretion wetted only the nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue (adenoidit traditional flat x-rays are not suitable for evaluating patients with acute rhinosinusitis and even CT is not suitable for diagnosis of forms without complications. 80% of patients with a banal episode of URI present with radiological anomalies, which are absolutely not significant in a clinical sense. 80% of patients with a banal episode of URI present with radiological anomalies. oxicillin is recommended, or alternatively cephalosporin, while macrolides should be reserved for patients with known allergy to beta-lactams. treatment should be commenced with high dosage of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. levofloxacin, which was once reserved only for adults, is used today also in pediatric ages. al algorithm evidence based scheme for therapy in children with acute rhinosinusitis. complications of an ARS may involve the orbit (optic neuritis, periorbital cellulitis, orbital abscess), the central nervous system (meningitis, subdural and epineural empyema, cerebral abscess, venous sinus thrombosis) or the bone (maxillary osteitis, frontal osteitis age represents the most important risk factor associated with CRS, with a drop in prevalence of the disease after 6-8 years of age 9 22. in symptomatic patients, detection of CT anomalies has been observed in 73% of patients aged between 2-6 years, in 74% between 6-10 years, while a sharp reduction, equivalent to 38%, was in patients aged over 10 years. the comorbidity relationship between asthma and CRS is definite. 80% of patients studied through spirometry testing and detection of inflammation markers in the liquid from nasal irrigation. there is an even more definite relationship between a deficiency of immunocompetence and recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis. steroid therapy is considered the first line for chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age. local steroid therapy is considered the first line for chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age. authors find comfort in the use of bacterial lysates 29. the candidates for endoscopic surgery of paranasal sinuses are those children presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. other treatment procedures taking into account age, predisposing factors and comorbidity may be useful before turning to the solution of surgery. ESS represents the last resort in treatment of rhinosinusitis and should be taken into consideration only after all other treatments have been tried. partial understanding of the anatomical and pathological condition of the paranasal sinuses obtained from CT Imaging. these images, if correlated with a CANS, can also provide high precision and relative safety in reaching zones surgically difficult to approach. relying on this type of investigation is preferable in cases where frequent radiological checks are necessary. adenoidectomy in treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis was published by Rosenfield 33. the first step was represented by appropriate medical treatment followed by adenoidectomy and by ESS as the final step to fall back on. 77% of children undergoing adenoidectomy progress towards symptomatological resolution compared to a lower percentage of patients undergoing adenoidectomy alone. two main indications exist for endoscopic sinus surgery 34,35 in cystic fibrosis. the first is the necessity to remove polypoid formations, which in the majority of these patients occupy massively the nasal fossae. the second indication arises from the observation that the paranasal sinuses, and particularly the maxillary sinuses, may represent a sort of reservoir for germs which remain confined in an anaerobic environment. the stage of deep neutropenia following transplant favours the local growth of fungal hyphae, in the absence of the phagocyte function of the neutrophils. there are no effective antifungal prophylaxis schemes for patients with acute leukemia under induction chemotherapy. fluconazole prophylaxis in doses of 400 mg/die has proved useful in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant. acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis in pediatric age are notably prevalent, correlated with frequency of viral rhinitis and the condition of physiological immaturity of the immune system. ARS is a self-limiting disease, but antibiotic treatment is encoded in international guidelines, in order to accelerate healing times. the majority of patients respond to an adequate medical therapy. complications from otomastoiditis involve around 80% of cases in pediatric age. in pre-antibiotic times, acute mastoiditis was associated with mortality rates of around 50% 39. in recent decades the drop in mortality has not been matched by a decrease in complications. mastoid empyema must be suspected in the case of otalgia and otorrhea persisting for at least two weeks. a mastoid empyema must be suspected in the case of otalgia and otorrhea persisting for at least two weeks or in the case of recurrence of symptoms after a period of remission of 7-10 days. mastoidectomy or anthrotomy by retroauricular route consists of a mastoidectomy or anthrotomy by retroauricular route. an external drainage is normally placed to allow maintenance of adequate mastoid ventilation in the subsequent months. in around 30% of adult individuals a marked pneumatisation may be seen of the apex of the petrous bone. osteitis processes spread to the cellularity of the apex and cause severe pictures which cannot be resolved after a surgical repair of the posterior cellularity. labyrinthitis is caused by bacterial infections involving the membranous labyrinth, with increasing loss of auditory and vestibular function. in purulent labyrinthitis, after a few weeks the central compensation mechanisms allow for resolution of crises of vertigo. in the past, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were responsible for most of the infections. this complication runs concurrently with predisposing factors, such as tegmen defects with or without herniation of cerebral tissue. similar risk factors are associated with a worse prognosis. dural abscess is a coalescent collection of pus encircled by adherences from the dura mater. there are no specific clinical signs for this disease, which only leads to neurological signs in the case of ample extension and compression. subdural empyema is a purulent infectious process which develops between the membranes of the dura and pia mater. critical clinical elements to look for are intense headache, nausea, fever and cervical rigidity, sometimes accompanied by photophobia, hyperesthesia and alteration of the state of consciousness to a variable extent. the decisive diagnostic exams are rachicentesis and cranial CT scan to allow differential diagnosis with cerebral abscess, cerebritis, subdural empyema. a retrospective review of clinical data of patients with otogenic thrombosis of the lateral sinus took as its objective the better characterisation of these patients and the definition of a diagnostic therapeutic protocol. the criteria for inclusion taken into consideration were pediatric age (0-16 years), otomastoiditis complicated by thrombosis. the thrombophilia risk is categorised as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d for factor V Leiden or MTHFR, or presence of multiple mutations) the thrombophilia risk is therefore categorised as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d (for example carriers of mutation in heterozygous form) on clinical debut mean age was 63 33 months, (range = 6-139 months), and 8/24 patients showed exclusively otologic signs and symptoms, in the absence of neurologic involvement. trigger inflammatory event was acute otomastoiditis in 9 cases (36%) and chronic in 16 (64%) two patients were affected by cholesteatoma, one of which bilaterally. the exact Fisher test did not show a significant association between recanalisation and sex (p = 0.434), trigger event (acute or chronic otomastoiditis; p = 0.434), high or low thrombophilia risk (p = 1), extension of thrombosis to the transverse sinus or internal jugular vein (p = 0.24), mastoidectomy (p = 0.43) the variables that are significantly associated with increased possibility of the use of low molecular weight heparin (100 U/kg) is particularly suited to cases that present with surgical indications. a surgical indication in cases of mastoiditis with radiological evidence of mastoid empyema or erosion of critical anatomical structures. in the presence of marked neurologic signs there may be the suspicion of wide extension of the thrombus, longer duration of the complication, possible other associated endocranial complications. in any case, it is curious to note that other markers of severity of clinical picture do not associate with unfavorable outcome. clear guidelines do not exist and the majority of authors propose personalised observations based on series of less than 10 patients. in western countries incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis is of 1-4:100000 new cases per year, with an increase in countries with lower socio-economic development, and a mean age at first detection less than 5 years 51. in adult age there is a double peak, at 35 and at 64 years 52. prevalence of laryngeal papillomatosis is less than 1% in patients born by caesarean. the first manifestation of disease is increasing dysphonia, arising from early predominant involvement of the glottal plate. the first manifestation of disease is increasing dysphonia, arising from early predominant involvement of the glottal plate. the form with high aggressiveness has early onset (before 2-3 years of age), with the need for more than 40 interventions, increase in mortality rate and possible need for tracheotomy 57. malignant transformation is infrequent and has been described in the forms of high aggressiveness at a minimum of 15 years from first onset. none of the possible treatments currently available are effective in eradicating recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. the aim of the therapy is to check on evolution, while ensuring sufficient respiratory space and improvement in the quality of the voice 53 61. the microdebrider was introduced into use in pediatric laryngeal surgery. it is owing to better endoscopic viewing during the procedure and absence of the risk of heat damage following laser treatment 63. in some centres, the approach with the Microbrewer is coupled with completion of treatment of lesions using radiofrequency Cold Ablation (Fig. 8.12) ryngeal papillomatosis is certainly cidofovir. the drug is used by topic injection at the level of papillomatous lesions. the results are positive, with reduction in the number and frequency of recurrences and in aggressiveness up to cases of full remission from disease. papillomatosis in pediatric age is a disease with an unpredictable course, potentially fatal and difficult to treat. the approach most commonly used is surgical, with the aim of ensuring respiratory space, improving the quality of the voice and controlling the evolution of the disease. the development of aMR is an inevitable natural phenomenon, caused by mutations in the genetic material of bacteria or by acquisition of exogenous genes of resistance transported by mobile elements. potential spreading of resistant organisms can have a negative impact on the health of subjects not directly exposed 3. annual number of deaths attributed to infections caused by multiresistant pathogens, amounting at the moment to 700,000, will exceed 10 million by 2050. emergence of strains of enterobacteria that are also resistant to carbapenems 6,7, the antibiotics that represent one of the last therapeutic resources for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. lost effectiveness of this class of antibiotics leaves very little margin for therapeutic intervention and requires reliance on combinations of antibiotics which include molecules that have not been used for many years. MIC values lower or close to the breakpoint of 16 mg/L does not influence outcome, while, if the MIC clearly exceeds this level then the percentage of success drastically falls 12. new molecular associations are represented both by new beta-lactams plus old BLBLIs (ceftolozane/tazobactam) and by old beta-lactams plus new BLBLIs. carbapenem sparing option in treatment of infections from ESBL + pathogens. temocillin is a beta-lactam that is active against ESBL + strains. chromosome genes present in some species such as Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. ceftazidime-avibactam is a class A and C beta-lactamase inhibitor. at present, studies carried out have not enlisted many patients with AmpC infections. there is no experience of bacteremia from AmpC producer enterobacteria 13. a new method of transmission of R to colistin between one bacterium and another, using a plasmid vehicle called mcr-1 14. this method of resistance spread rapidly worldwide and arrived first in Europe 16 then also in Italy. resistance to colistin appears to be associated, at least in infections caused by KPC producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. in some studies it is itself an independent risk factor of mortality 21,22. in the case of MIC > 16 mg/mL, carbapenem is excluded. gentamycin is the drug to combine with colistin and tigecycline in KPC. it is the only way to achieve reduction in mortality, compared to the use in combination of carbapenem 26. the current alternative is represented by ceftazidime/avibactam at dosage of 2.5 gr every 8 h. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is resistant to carbapenem and sensitive only to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. the resistance to carbapenem comes from two different mechanisms, represented by an \"over-expression of efflux pumps\" and by \"reduction of the membrane pores\" the colistin rifampicin association has proved to be synergic in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems. the synergic combination with rifampicin extends the bactericidal action of colistin to more than 12 hours 34. this time the colistin disorganises the cell wall to facilitate exit of the carbapenemase. ceftolozane is hydrolysed by metalloenzymes, which are not inhibited by tazobactam. resistance to carbapenems in this case is again linked to production of class D carbapenemase (Oxacillinase and, in particular, OXA-48 and OXA-23) sulbactam at the dose of 1.5-3 g every 6-8 hours has proved effective, in small case studies, against bacteremia and pneumonia from Acinetobacter baumannii. sulbactam at the dose of 1.5-3 g every 6-8 hours has proved effective, in small case studies, against bacteremia and pneumonia. teicoplanin, a glycopeptide of synthesis, is burdened by lesser nephrotoxicity than vancomycin. this drug reaches elevated concentrations in the bone (60% of the hematic concentration), in the cutis and in the lung 43. teicoplanin is burdened by lesser nephrotoxicity than vancomycin. telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin are long-acting drugs with indications only in infections of the cutis and soft tissues. tedizolid has fewer collateral effects and pharmacological interactions and acts against linezolid-resistant strains, but it is bacteriostatic. daptomycin may be less active against strains of Streptococcus aureus. bacteria face cellular death without lysis and do not release factors capable of stimulating inflammatory reactions. AMS programmes are understood as an interdisciplinary effort in a continuum of care. aims at achieving the best possible result in terms of treatment and prevention of infections, of survival and of reduction of mortality, quality of assistance and costs. strategy is rapid determination of the pathogen, which enables an adequate choice of antibiotic as fast as possible. the most common cause of inappropriate therapy is represented by failure of the clinician to estimate the risk of infection from antibiotic-resistant organisms. in practice, people die more from septic shock than from sepsis from MDR pathogens. this has greater impact on mortality than simple acquisition of multi resistance. a large part of interventions in ENT surgery are considered clean and do not require antibiotic prophylaxis. however, administration of a second-generation cephalosporin (cefuroxime 2 gr) is indicated, alone or in association with clindamycin or metronidazole or, as second choice, a ureidopenicillin, or a protected penicillin. the emergence of strains of enterobacteria that are also resistant to carbapenems 6,7, the antibiotics that represent one of the last therapeutic resources for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. the lost effectiveness of this class of antibiotics leaves very little margin for therapeutic intervention and requires reliance on combinations of antibiotics. fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonellae, fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant 9.2 Infections from multidrug-resistant gram-negative germs (MDROs) enterobacteria The preferred drugs for treatment of infections from ESBL producer enterobacteria are considered to be the carbapenems. use of piperacillin/tazobactam is currently guided by the MIC (MIC driven strategy) new molecular associations are represented by new beta-lactams plus old BLBLIs (ceftolozane/tazobactam) and by old beta-lactams plus new BLBLIs (ceftazidime/avibactam), but this is all dependent on molecular biology tests. ceftolozane/tazobactam is also active against enterobacteria and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. the MIC of cefepime remains lower and is often within the range of sensitivity compared to other cephalosporins. temocillin must be used at adequate dosage, which is 4-6 gr in 2-3 refracted doses for adults. temocillin also proved active against KPC producer strains with MIC 16 mg/L 15. resistance to colistin was determined by chromosome mutations, which made this pattern not easily transmissible to other strains. in 2009 in Italy only 1.3% of bacteremias from Klebsiella pneumoniae were caused by carbapenem resistant strains. in 2011 there were 27% and in 2015 33%. resistance to colistin appears to be associated with an increase in mortality. in colistin sensitive strains, the combination colistin + tigecycline + gentamicin at the dosages reported above and in colistin resistant strains, tigecycline + gentamicin + fosfomycin at high dosages (6 gr every 6 h) 23. gentamycin is the drug to combine with colistin and tigecycline in KPC. the current alternative is represented by ceftazidime/avibactam at dosage of double carbapenem may play a competitive inhibitor role on the carbapenemase. the second would be free to act 28. evidence of the efficacy of this approach is solely anecdotal and the presumption underlying the use of double carbapenem. the colistin rifampicin association has proved to be synergic in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems. the colistin rifampicin association has proved to be synergic in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems. in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, addition of an aminoglycoside, such as amikacin, significantly increases therapeutic appropriacy of the antipseudomonal beta-lactam used 35. in this case, colistin is synergic with amikacin, unlike what happens in Acinetobacter baumannii where this combination is often antagonistic. antibacterial action linked to inhibition of PBP of Acinetobacter baumannii. sulbactam at the dose of 1.5-3 g every 6-8 hours has proved effective against bacteremia and pneumonia from Acinetobacter baumannii. 80% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains have relatively low MIC for minocycline. colistin allows greater entry of minocycline at intracellular level. bactericidal effect only with MIC 1 mg/L for vancomycin. teicoplanin, a glycopeptide of synthesis, is burdened by lesser nephrotoxicity than vancomycin. this drug reaches elevated concentrations in the bone (60% of the hematic concentration), in the cutis and in the lung 43. the bond with plasma protein is very high and therefore a loading dose is required. daptomycin has its place in cellulitis and endocarditis, association with beta-lactams is perhaps the best way to administer it, also for microorganisms with reduced sensitivity to beta-lactams. ceftaroline has been approved for pneumonia in the community but not for MRSA, ceftobiprole for those in the community and nosocomial but not VAP. the study for infections of the cutis and soft tissues has not been approved by the FDA because of the impossibility of verifying the data collected. a strong consensus has emerged, by which the scientific community must act with the aim of limiting this emerging crisis. in a time-dependent pathology, septic syndrome and septic shock, septic shock. elimination of the infectious trigger may be the first step in arresting the development of the septic process. this delay appears to play a substantial role in influencing mortality in cases of septic shock. tof and profiles of sensitivity/resistance to antimicrobials to be used (e.g. molecular tests and rapid phenotype tests) 56 57. they are extremely expensive and reserved for the few, on the basis of precise selection of patients 58. enterobacteria The preferred drugs for treatment of infections from ESBL producer enterobacteria are considered to be the carbapenems. the drugs most used as alternatives to carbapenems are the combinations of BLBLIs. some studies have assessed the importance of the MIC of piperacillin/tazobactam on the outcome of this treatment. -lactams plus old BLBLIs (ceftolozane/tazobactam) and by old beta-lactams plus new BLBLIs (ceftazidime/avibactam), but this is all dependent on molecular biology tests capable of identifying the specific pattern of resistance. temocillin, a beta-lactam that is active not only against ESBL + strains, but also against the AmpC strain ceftolozane/tazobactam is also active against enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. avibactam is a class A and C beta-lactamase inhibitor. at present, studies have not enlisted many patients with AmpC infections. resistance to colistin was determined by chromosome mutations, which made this pattern of resistance not easily transmissible to other strains. in 2009 in Italy only 1.3% of bacteremias from Klebsiella pneumoniae were caused by carbapenem resistant strains. the first strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to colistin was isolated in Italy 20. resistance to colistin appears to be associated, at least in infections caused by KPC producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. in some studies it is itself an independent risk factor of mortality 21. gentamycin is the drug to combine with colistin and tigecycline in KPC. it is the only way to achieve reduction in mortality, compared to the use in combination of carbapenem 26. gentamycin is the drug to combine with colistin and tigecycline in KPC. resistance to carbapenem comes from two different mechanisms. mutations of topoisomerase II and IV, responsible for resistance to fluoroquinolones, and mutations leading to derepression of ampC type endogenous beta-lactamase. the colistin rifampicin association has proved to be synergic in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to carbapenems. the colistin is synergic with amikacin, unlike the antipseudomonal beta-lactam used 35. the colistin rifampicin association has proved to be synergic in the bacterium. anti-Pseudomonas action of this new cephalosporin is due to the fact that it is capable of eluding the main mechanisms of resistance which operate against the other beta-lactams. resistance to carbapenems in this case is again linked to production of class D carbapenemase (Oxacillinase and in particular OXA-48 and OXA-23) ampicillin/sulbactam is used for the direct action of its sulbactam. it should not be forgotten that there is no breakpoint for tigecycline and A. baumannii. it should be based on the theoretical levels of drugs which can reach the infection district at the known doses. old glycopeptides are drugs that may be bactericidal, but in the event of increase of MIC, this characteristic is lost. vancomycin must reach seric concentrations downstream of 20 mg/L or of AUC/MIC > 400 39. eicoplanin was administered at 200/400 mg die, which for a person of 70 kg corresponds to 3-4 mg/kg/die, when the minimum dose should be at least 6 mg/kg/die 44. a retrospective study showed that teicoplanin at dosage of 12 mg/kg/die had a better outcome in terms of mortality, percentage of septic shock and early disappearance of fever than dosage of 6 mg/kg/die 44. daptomycin is a semisynthetic lipopeptide antibiotic, which has a calcium-dependent anti-bacterial action. it forms complexes capable of depolarising and forming pores on the bacterial membrane, using the lateral chain of daptomycin molecules. AMS programmes are understood as an interdisciplinary effort in a continuum of care. aims at achieving the best possible result in terms of treatment and prevention of infections, of survival and reduction of mortality, quality of assistance and costs, as well as reduction of toxicity and adverse ecological effects. elimination of the infectious trigger may be the first step in arresting the development of the septic process. this delay appears to play a substantial role in influencing mortality in cases of septic shock. the most common cause of inappropriate therapy is represented by failure of the clinician to estimate the risk of infection from antibiotic-resistant organisms. a large part of interventions in ENT surgery are considered clean and do not require antibiotic prophylaxis, except in patients with elevated co-morbidity falling under the ASA 3 class of risk. a large part of interventions in clean-contaminated surgery are considered clean and do not require antibiotic prophylaxis, except in cases with elevated co-morbidity falling under the ASA 3 class of risk. resistance to antibiotics is considered as the capability that some microorganisms have to survive even in the presence of concentrations of antimicrobials. resistance to antibiotics is considered as the capability that some microorganisms have to survive even in the presence of concentrations of antimicrobials normally capable of inhibiting or killing microorganisms of the same species 2. resistance to antibiotics is complex, because it is based on multiple factors. increased and continuing use of these drugs (including inappropriate use), spread of hospital infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (and limited control of these infections), increase in international travel and therefore greater spread of bacterial strains. the european commission has also issued a plan of action to combat the growing risks of AMR. nanomaterials showing both marked intrinsic antimicrobial activity and high efficacy and safety in administering antibiotics are called \u201cnanoantibiotics\u201d and their capacity to control infection during in vitro and in vivo studies has been explored and demonstrated experimentally. nanomaterials showing both marked intrinsic antimicrobial activity and high efficacy and safety in administering antibiotics are called \u201cnanoantibiotics\u201d and their ability to control infection during in vitro and in vivo studies. metallic nanoparticles (NPs) with antimicrobial action: activity, applications and examples. metallic nanoparticles (NPs) with antimicrobial action: activity, applications and examples. metallic nanoparticles (NPs) with antimicrobial activity. polymer NPs are coated with antibiotics Chitosano + Au NPs + ampicillin (1) (13) polymers allow transmission and release of antibiotics or substances with antimicrobial action in a site of action. polymers are biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, such as: polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polylactid-co-glycolic acid, polycaprolactone and polycyanoacrylate. polymer nanoparticles are considered a valid means of delivery of antimicrobial agents, showing elevated therapeutic efficacy in treatment of many types of infections 14. polymer nanoparticles are considered a valid means of delivery some of the antibiotics used in medicine. nanoparticles loaded by adsorption with gentamicin display excellent antimicrobial activity. this polymer\u2019s radical scavenger activity can also reduce the toxicity of the gentamicin due to formation of free radicals 22. liposomes are vesicles of varying dimensions, between nanometres and micrometres, consisting of a bilayer of phospholipids with an aqueous core. polymyxin B (colistin) is active against P. aeruginosa infections. it presents a series of collateral effects and causes blockage on a muscular level. delivering polymyxin B inside liposomes displayed how the collateral effects were noticeable reduced. fibrous polymer matrices delivering antibiotics have been discovered as a solution for preventing post-operative adhesion and providing site-specific release of an antibiotic drug. they are capable of operating as carriers for hydrophilic or hydrophobic molecules, but also actually act as support for tissue regeneration. prevent infections after surgery (32) PLGA Tetracyclinehydrochloride Protein synthesis inhibitors, active against gram + and gram - (35) PLA/PCL Tetracyclinehydrochloride Protein synthesis inhibitors, active against gram + and gram - (35) PLA-collagene Gentamicin Post-operative infections due to S. epidermis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli (37) Halloysite clay nanotubes/PC a carbon nanotube may be considered as a sheet of graphene (a hexagonal net of carbon) rolled into cylindrical form. single-wall nanotubes with a diameter of around 1-5 nm and multi-wall nanotubes consisting of multiple tubes piled one on the other, with a length varying from 100 nm to a few micrometres. graphene oxide acts with both mechanical damage and with chemical oxidation. the antibacterial mechanism of graphene oxide acting with both mechanical damage and with chemical oxidation would make it more difficult for bacterial resistance to occur. the spread of ineffectiveness of traditional antibiotic treatment is a problem the scientific community is interfacing with. nanoparticles are versatile therapeutic systems; depending on their constituent material, that can fulfil intrinsic antimicrobial activities or be carriers for antibacterial active principles. the war against pathogen bacteria calls for the effort of implementation of various strategies, starting from better and more controlled application of the already existing preventive measures to avoid primary infections. it should also be laid down that antibiotics on sale should be used more rationally, underlining the need to give precedence to the use of low spectrum agents while reserving use of high spectrum ones for special, high risk circumstances. new nanomaterials and nanotechnology may find a clinical use for administering antibiotics and antimicrobial substances. new nanomaterials and nanotechnology studied as vehicles of antibiotics and antimicrobial substances. NPs with intrinsic antibacterial activity consist of metals and metal oxides, such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), Zinc oxide (ZnO) and Titanium (TiO2). metallic nanoparticles (NPs) with antimicrobial activity: activity, applications and examples. metal NPs Antimicrobial activity Target Applications Ref. Ag NPs Attach respiratory chain and cell division to cell death Gram + (S. aureus) Gram \u2013 (E. coli) Wound treatment surgical devices AgNPs Functionalized with ampicillin (1) (9) Release of silver ions with bactericidal activity Coating for medical and Synergistic action used with antibiotics (Penicillin G polymer nanoparticles are constituted from chains of equal or different monomers. the polymer membrane controls the drug release amount. it is used to cover the individual molecule of drug dissolved in water or in an oily solvent. in any case the drug will end up distributed evenly within the polymer matrix. polymer nanoparticles are considered a valid means of delivery of antimicrobial agents, showing elevated therapeutic efficacy in treatment of many types of infections 14. the polymer NPs are currently being studied for delivery some of the antibiotics used in medicine. liposomes are vesicles of varying dimensions, between nanometres and micrometres, consisting of a bilayer of phospholipids with an aqueous core. the first drug based on a liposome vehicle, doxorubicin (Doxil) was approved by the FDA in 1995, since when much attention has been paid to the use of these carriers for delivery of drugs. delivering polymyxin B inside liposomes showed how collateral effects were reduced, while at the same time antimicrobial activity was increased 28. encapsulation of gentamicin and ceftazidime in liposomes shows the advantage of prolonging the circulation time and increasing drug half-life. fibrous polymer matrices delivering antibiotics have been discovered as a solution for preventing post-operative adhesion and providing site-specific release of an antibiotic drug. these fibrous matrices are capable of operating as carriers for hydrophilic or hydrophobic molecules, but also actually act as support for tissue regeneration at the operation site 32. PLA/PCL Tetracyclinehydrochloride Protein synthesis inhibitors, active against gram + and gram - (36) PLA-collagene Gentamicin Post-operative infections due to S. epidermis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli

other, with a length ranging from 100 nm to a few micrometres. new studies have shown antimicrobial activity associated with single-wall nanotubes after implantation in damaged areas that are at risk of infection. experimental tests have demonstrated important cytotoxic action against bacteria in dispersion, with noticeable reduction of the bacterial count even after just 1-2 hours. graphene oxide acting with both mechanical damage and with chemical oxidation would make it more difficult for bacterial resistance to occur. coating medical instruments with this carbon-based material might contribute to reducing infections, especially after surgery, as well as reducing the use of antibiotics. nanoparticles can fulfil intrinsic antimicrobial activities or be carriers for antibacterial active principles, improving their activity and reducing their collateral effects. nanoparticles currently seem to be the focus of greater interest within the scientific community, especially because of their better stability compared to liposome vesicles. development of highly engineered pharmaceutical forms (such as nanoparticle drug delivery systems) can enable more targeted and controlled use of antibiotics at the infection site, starting to combat the excessive and sometimes far from effective use of antimicrobial agents. david frum: investment in new anti-infection platforms is essential and urgent and calls for close collaboration between industry, academic world and governments. he says the era in which bacterial infection, whether acute or chronic, was treated with \u201cjust\u201d the use of antibiotics is over and that only 0.8% of state expenditure in the poor nations is destined for health, while worldwide only 2% of investments in research is used to combat AIDS, malaria, TB and acute respiratory infections. underdevelopment and poverty do not only contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, but also contribute to decrease in life expectancy, reduced to no more than 40 years in many African nations. there is no data in the literature on the clinical/economic impact for assessment. there is no data in the literature on the clinical/economic impact for assessment. the direct cost to the NHS is correlated with the costs related to employment of hospital resources, together with costs of drugs. inpatient costs increased inpatient stay Use of antibiotics Possible stay in intensive care Costs of assistance potential need for isolation Use of barriers Diagnostic and laboratory tests Working time of health staff Outpatient/homecare costs additional medical check-ups Antibiotic treatment Home visits by GP Rehabilitation therapy. the inhomogeneity of each DRG is generally assessed on the basis of variation of the length of hospital stay. the greater the coefficient of variation, the higher is the inhomogeneity of the DRG in question. the inadequacy of the coding system for otorhinolaryngology heavily penalises our specialisation. the most significant example in the world comes from TB, which has gone through periods of decline and moments of re-acutisation. the most significant example in the world comes from TB, which has gone through periods of decline and moments of re-acutisation, in parallel with containment by control and aid programmes. the importance may be deduced of an adequate, correct assessment of the clinical and economic impact. it is imperative that decision makers arm themselves with monitoring instruments that evaluate new, adequate methods of treatment and the results of assistance. the importance of a clear idea of the decision making processes, of the policy aims of decision making and of the time required for making decisions. infectious diseases, emerging and re-emerging ones, pose a global threat. the threat is planetary, since an infection can set in anywhere in the world and pass rapidly to other regions, through means of communication. the spread of HIV/AIDS is undermining stability and even every attempt at economic and social development. the fight against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is achieved through health programmes for adequate treatment of patients, but also with programmes for surveillance, prevention, implementation of monitoring systems for drug resistance and effective vaccine cover. it becomes imperative to carry out cost studies on diseases and provide indication for decision making processes. direct cost to the NHS is correlated with costs related to employment of hospital resources, either for primary care for inpatients or for home care, together with costs of drugs. indirect costs include those related with lost productivity or early retirement; then aspects have to be considered that are connected with possible invalidity and lost years of life. to function properly, the DRG must inevitably be: flexible; prompt; upgradeable; transparent; accurate; fair; homogeneous. to obtain groups of patients that are reasonably homogeneous on a level of absorption of resources, the system should be less simple and it should be supplemented with indicators of severity of disease. the SDO should be completed with all the diseases and services, trying to find the best ICD-9CM codes among those available, instead of those that appear more opportunist. it is a source of \"assessment, monitoring and enhancement\" of the assistance for the so-called \u201ccomplex\u201d patient, as the one who is treated for diseases correlated with an emerging and re-emerging infection. the most significant example in the world comes from TB, which has gone through periods of decline and moments of re-acutisation. a recent alarm for public health concerned the spread of mycobacterial strains that are multi-resistant to pharmacological treatments (MDR-TB), which really represents a major issue. the goals can be reached of rationalisation of the system of supply, of improvement of assistance practices and of the creation of economy of management. dealing successfully with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases requires a clear idea of the decision making processes, of the policy aims of decision making. Availability of resources and incentives must also be defined for implementation of programmes and treatments which can lead to more cost-effective use of resources."}
