{"summary": "transforming growth factor- (TGF-) is a prototype of the secreted polypeptide cytokine superfamily. it consists of 33 members in mammalians, including TGF-, activins, nodal, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)3 and others (1, 2). TGF- plays a pivotal role in embryonic development and adult homeostasis maintenance. the two domains are bridged by a proline-rich linker region that is divergent in length and amino acid sequence. other signaling molecules are reported to transduce signals from TGF- and its receptors, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38) inflammatory bowel disease or tissue fibrosis. low or high activity of TGF- signaling is observed. underlying molecular mechanisms by which Smad7 exerts its regulatory roles are not fully understood. NEDD4L shRNAs were based on pSUPER-puro, targeting GAGGCTGTGTGTGTGTGAA and GCTAGACTGTGGATTGAGT. other plasmids encoding NEDD4L and wild-type and mutant Smads have been described before. the construct encoding FLAG-tagged Smad7 under the control of CMV promoter was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells. empty vectors were used to equalize the total amounts of plasmids in each sample. the experiments were repeated in triplicate. lysates containing equivalent amounts of total proteins were precleared for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 4 \u00b0C. immunoprecipitation was carried out by the addition of appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose followed by incubation at 4 \u00b0C overnight with gentle rotation. an aliquot of the supernatants was taken for protein expression analyses. the remaining lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting detection. recombinant human TGF-1 and BMP2 proteins were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. Cycloheximide, MG132, and anti-FLAG antibody (M2) were from Sigma. antibodies against Smad7 and Smad4 were generated by immunizing rabbits with proteins of Smad7 N terminus and Smad4-linker (144\u2013316 amino acids) luciferase reporter assay, total RNA Extraction, RT, and Quantitative RT-PCR Cells were plated in 24-well plates one night before transfection. empty vectors were used to equalize total amounts of plasmids. immunoprecipitation was carried out by the addition of appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose followed by incubation at 4 \u00b0C overnight with gentle rotation. the immune complex was isolated by centrifugation and repeated washes with lysis buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. MH2 domain structure was constructed based on the three-dimensional structure of C-terminally phosphorylated Smad3 MH2 domain (RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1U7F) using SWISS-MODEL. p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. phospho-Smad2, phospho-Smad3, or TRI were from Cell Signaling. antibodies against Smad7 and Smad4 were generated by immunizing rabbits. other antibodies, including anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-GAPDH, and anti-tubulin antibodies were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. luciferase activity measured at 40 h post-transfection by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) the experiments were repeated in triplicate, and the data are presented as the means S.D. after normalization to Renilla activity. protein turnover analysis HEK293FT cells were transfected with indicated plasmids in 12-well plates. cells were treated with 50 g/ml cycloheximide for the indicated time periods before harvest. cells were lysed for protein level analyses by immunoblotting. values were presented as the mean S.D., and the significance between the means was calculated using Student's t test. p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. myc, anti-HA, anti-GAPDH, and anti-tubulin antibodies were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. human embryonic kidney epithelial HEK293FT cells were maintained in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. total cell RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative RT-PCR were described previously (30) the primers used were as follows: for human GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), 5\u2032-ACCACAGTCCAT GCCATCAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3\u2032; for human Smad7, 5\u2032-CCAACTGCAGACTGTCCAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTCTCC cells were treated with 50 g/ml cycloheximide for the indicated time periods before harvest. cells were lysed for protein level analyses by immunoblotting. lysates were immediately diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer. a reporter assay was performed in HEK293FT cells using the luciferase reporter. treatment with TGF-1, overexpression of the constitutively active (ca-) type I TGF- receptor TRI, Smad3 alone, or Smad3 together with Smad4 stimulated reporter expression. the reporter is driven by a promoter that contains. HEK293FT cells (D) or R1B/L17 cells (E) transfected with plasmids encoding Gal4-TK-Luc (200 ng) together with Renilla luciferase (20 ng), Gal4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad2 (50 ng), Gal4-Smad3 (50 ng), Smad4 (50 ng), and Smad7 (100 ng) were treated with 100 pm each experiment was performed in triplicate. the data are presented as the mean S.D. after normalization to Renilla activity. we used the Gal4-luciferase reporter in which luciferase expression is driven by a promoter. Smad7 inhibits the signaling activity of R-Smads downstream of the receptors. hep3B cells treated with or without TGF-1 ligands were subjected to co-IP. the binding of Smad7 to wild-type (WT) Smad3, Smad3(2D) mutant is required for their interaction with Smad7. the mutant contains three serine-to-alanine mutations at the C-terminal tail. the mutant is mutated to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation. Plasmids encoding Smad3 (50 ng) and Smad7 (100 ng) were transfected to HEK293FT cells. after treatment with or without 100 pm TGF-1 for 20 h, the cells were subjected to luciferase activity measurement. co-expression of EYFP(N)-Smad3 fusion protein with Venus(C)-Smad4 gave rise to green fluorescence in the nucleus upon TGF- treatment. in contrast, TGF--induced complex of EYFP(N)-Smad3 and Venus(C)-Smad7 were mainly localized in the cytoplasm, although a weak signal could also be detected in the nucleus. the MH2 domains of Smad7 and Smad3 mediate their interaction. the truncations containing the MH2 domain of Smad7 were capable of inhibiting the ca-TRI-induced CAGA-luciferase reporter expression and the Gal4-Smad3-mediated Gal4-luciferase reporter activation. the truncations were shown diagrammatically. pFR-luciferase reporter assays were performed in HEK293FT cells. cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 (G) or 25 ng/ml BMP2 (H) for 20 h before harvested. a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-tagged Smad7 could inhibit Smad3 activation. lysates were mixed as indicated and subjected to co-IP assay. only Smad7 4E mutant lost the ability to associate with Smad3. the other two mutants still retained the Smad3 binding activity. co-IP experiment was carried out in TRI-deficient R1B/L17 cells. Smad3 and Smad4 co-expressed with or without ca-TRI. interaction was attenuated by co-expression of Smad7. plasmids encoding pFR-luciferase, Renilla, Gal4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad3 (2D) (50 ng), Smad7 (100 ng), and Smad4 (25, 50, 100 ng respectively) were transfected into HEK293FT cells for luciferase assay. HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pFR-Luc (200 ng), Renilla (20 ng), Gla4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad1/3 (50 ng), wild-type Smad7 (25, 50, 100 ng) and the PY mutant (25, 50, 100 ng) HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Gal4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad3 (2D) (50 ng), Smad7 (10 ng), wild-type (10, 25, 50, 100 ng) or the ligase-deficient C821A mutant (50, 100 ng) NEDD4L gene silence efficiency was detected by immunoblotting. 93FT cells and FLAG-Smad7 (1 g, 2 g) or the empty vector were expressed separately. cells were treated with 10 m MG132 for 4 h before harvested for anti-Myc immunoprecipitation and anti-HA immunoblotting. NEDD4L was able to decrease TGF-1-induced phosphorylated Smad3 level. ectopic wild-type Smad7 inhibited endogenous Smad2/3-Smad4 interaction while enhancing the Smad2/3-NEDD4L binding. ectopic wild-type Smad7 also reinforced the ca-TRI-induced interactions between Smad2/3 and NEDD4L when overexpressed. mutation of these residues impaired the Smad3-Smad4 interaction. a basic region also contains the L3 loop (Lys-401, Arg-409), 8 strand (Lys-359, equivalent to Lys-333 in Smad3) and an adjacent -helix that contains Lys-312 and Lys-316. the basic region including the five key residues in the MH2 domain is essential for Smad7 to associate with Smad3 and inhibit its activity. together these results demonstrated that the basic region including the five key residues in the MH2 domain is essential for Smad7 to associate with Smad3. treatment with TGF-1, overexpression of the constitutively active (ca-) type I TGF- receptor TRI, Smad3 alone, or Smad3 together with Smad4 stimulated reporter expression. in addition, Smad7 inhibited the expression of CAGA-luciferase induced by ectopic expression of Smad3 with or without Smad4 in the TRI-deficient mink lung epithelial R1B/L17 cells. HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pFR-luciferase, nonspecific (NS) shRNA (100 ng), or Smad7-tergeting shRNA (100 ng) at 20 h post transfection, cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 (F) or 25 ng/ml BMP2 (G) overnight. mRNA expression level was normalized to that of GAPDH. luciferase expression is driven by a promoter that includes repeated Gal4 binding elements. fusion proteins of gal4 DBD with Smad3 or other transcription activators are able to induce the reporter expression. however, Smad7 attenuated the activity of Smad3 even in presence of the TRI kinase inhibitor SB431542. silencing of Smad7 expression enhanced the Gal4-Smad3-induced expression of the Gal4 reporter. together, these results indicate that Smad7 can inhibit the signaling activity of R-Smads downstream of the receptors, in addition to interfering with the binding of R-Smad-Smad4 complex to DNA. mutant in which the last two serine residues at the C-terminal tail are mutated to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation (38), or Smad3(3A) mutant that contains three serine-to-alanine mutations at the C-terminal tail and cannot be activated by TGF-. wild-type Smad3 was able to induce the CAGA-luciferase reporter expression, comparable with that of 2D mutant. cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 or 10 m SB431542 for 20 h. the interaction of protein A and B in cells brings EYFP(N) and Venus(C) together and generates green fluorescence. the interaction of protein A and B in cells brings EYFP(N) and Venus(C) together and generates green fluorescence. the kinetics of the R-Smad-Smad7 interaction in MDA-MB-231 cells stably express FLAG-Smad7 were similar to the one of phospho-Smad2. the kinetics was very similar to the one of phospho-Smad2 at 0.5 h and lasted 1 h, then their associations quickly weakened. both the full-length (FL) Smad3 and its truncations containing the MH2 domain were able to interact with Smad7. the MH2 domain of Smad7 mediates its interaction with Smad7. functionally, the truncations were capable of inhibiting the ca-TRI-induced CAGA-luciferase reporter expression. HA-Smad3 and ca-TRI plasmids were transfected into HEK293FT cells. FLAG-Smad7 proteins (WT, NLS-, PY, and 4E) were independently expressed. cell lysates were mixed together as indicated and subjected to co-IP experiments. lysates were mixed as indicated and subjected to co-IP assay. only Smad7 4E mutant lost the ability to associate with Smad3. the other two mutants still retained the Smad3 binding activity. Smad3 and Smad4 co-expressed with or without ca-TRI in HEK293FT cells. the interaction was attenuated by Smad7 in a dose-dependent manner. a co-IP experiment was carried out at 40 h post-transfection. e, Renilla, gal4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad3 (2D) (50 ng), Smad7 (100 ng), and Smad4 (25, 50, 100 ng respectively) were transfected into HEK293FT cells for luciferase assay. e, co-IP was similarly done as above. inhibition of the PY motif (PY) on Smad3 or Smad1 signaling activity was less effective than wild-type Smad7 (Fig. 3, E, G, and H, and 5, A and B) together these results suggest that the recruitment of WW-HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases may contribute to Smad7-mediated inhibition of R-Smad activity. HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Gal4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad3 (2D) (50 ng), Smad7 (10 ng), wild-type (10, 25, 50, 100 ng) or the ligase-deficient C821A mutant (50, 100 ng) NEDD4L gene silence efficiency was detected by immunoblotting. 93FT cells expressing the indicated proteins were treated with 10 m MG132 for 4 h before harvested for anti-Myc immunoprecipitation and anti-HA immunoblotting. NEDD4L was able to decrease TGF-1-induced phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) level, suggesting the contribution of Smad7 to NEDD4L-induced proteasomal degradation of p-Smad3. ectopic wild-type Smad7 inhibited endogenous Smad2/3-Smad4 interaction while enhancing the Smad2/3-NEDD4L binding. deletion of the PY motif exhibited an attenuated effect. ectopic wild-type Smad7 also reinforced the ca-TRI-induced interactions between Smad2/3 and NEDD4L. the modeling structure of the Smad7 MH2 domain based on that of Smad3 also contains a basic region that includes the L3 loop (Lys-401, Arg-409), 8 strand (Lys-359, equivalent to Lys-333 in Smad3), and an adjacent -helix that contains Lys-312 and Lys-316. simultaneous mutation of the four residues to glutamic acids (4E mutant) disabled the Smad7-Smad3 association. a co-IP experiment was carried out in HEK293FT cells. the positively charged regions and amino acids are shown in blue. the negatively charged regions are shown in red. co-expression of Smad7 blocked all of these effects, indicating that Smad7 can function at both the receptor level and the Smad level. Smad7 also inhibited the expression of CAGA-luciferase induced by ectopic expression of Smad3 with or without Smad4 in the TRI-deficient mink lung epithelial cells. HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pFR-luciferase, nonspecific (NS) shRNA (100 ng), or Smad7-tergeting shRNA (100 ng) at 20 h post transfection, cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 or/and 10 m SB431542 overnight. mRNA expression level was normalized to that of GAPDH. e reporter in which luciferase expression is driven by a promoter that includes repeated Gal4 binding elements. the reporter was activated by Gal4-Smad3 overexpression and TGF-1 further promoted the activation. however, Smad7 attenuated the activity of Smad3 even in the presence of the TRI kinase inhibitor SB431542, strongly suggesting that the effect of Smad7 is independent of receptor activity. hep3B cells treated with or without TGF-1 ligands were subjected to co-IP. we expressed Smad7, R-Smad proteins (Smad2/3 and Smad1/8), Smad4 and the other inhibitory Smad Smad6. Smad7 interacted strongly with wild-type Smad3 and 2D mutant. but weakly with non-activated wild-type Smad3 or 3A mutant. hep3B cells were treated with or without 100 pm TGF-1 for 1 h. the interaction of protein A and B in cells brings EYFP(N) and Venus(C) together and generates green fluorescence. at 40 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 for 1 h before being fixed for fluorescence examination by an Olympus confocal microscope. induced complex of EYFP(N)-Smad3 and Venus(C)-Smad7 were localized in the cytoplasm. as TGF- and BMP induce both the R-Smad-Smad4 association that transduces signals and the R-Smad-Smad7 interaction that interferes with signal transduction, the two events seem to contradict each other. to elucidate the physiological consequence of these interactions, we examined the kinetics of the R-Smad-Smad mad3 and its truncations containing the MH2 domain were able to interact with Smad7. the MH2 domain of Smad7 was also involved in Smad3 interaction. functionally, the truncations were capable of inhibiting the ca-TRI-induced CAGA-luciferase reporter expression. HEK293FT cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 (G) or 25 ng/ml BMP2 (H) cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 (G) or 25 ng/ml BMP2 (H) for 20 h before harvested. lysates were mixed as indicated and subjected to co-IP experiments. the data suggest that the binding of WW-HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases could play a role in Smad7-mediated inhibition of R-Smad activity. the binding of WW-HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases could play a role in Smad7-mediated inhibition of R-Smad activity. Smad3 and Smad4 co-expressed with or without ca-TRI in HEK293FT cells. the interaction was attenuated by Smad7 in a dose-dependent manner. a, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing FLAG-Smad7 or control empty vector were treated with 100 pm TGF-1. GST-Smad4, Myc-Smad3, and ca-TRI-HA proteins were ectopically expressed in HEK293FT cells as indicated. the 4E Smad7 mutant no longer interacts with Smad3. however, the PY motif-deleted (PY) and the NLS-tagged Smad7 decreased the interaction. HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pFR-Luc (200 ng), Renilla (20 ng), Gla4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad1/3 (50 ng), wild-type Smad7 (25, 50, 100 ng) and the PY mutant (25, 50, 100 ng) and the PY mutant (25, 50, 100 ng) and treated with (A) or without (B) HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Gal4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad3 (2D) (50 ng), Smad7 (10 ng), wild-type (10, 25, 50, 100 ng) or the ligase-deficient C821A mutant (50, 100 ng) NEDD4L gene silence efficiency was detected by immunoblotting. ectopic wild-type Smad7 inhibited endogenous Smad2/3-Smad4 interaction while enhancing the Smad2/3-Smad4 binding. ectopic wild-type Smad7 inhibited endogenous Smad2/3-Smad4 interaction while enhancing the Smad2/3-NEDD4L binding. MH2 domains mediate both Smad-Smad and the Smad-TRI interactions. the basic region comprises the L3 loop (Lys-378 and Arg-386) and 8 strand (Lys-333) the basic region comprises the L3 loop (Lys-378 and Arg-386) Arg-409), 8 strand (Lys-359, equivalent to Lys-333 in Smad3), 8 strand (Lys-312, Lys-316, Lys-401, and Arg-409) have been reported to mediate binding of Smad7 to TRI. simultaneous mutation of the four residues to glutamic acids (4E mutant) disabled the Smad7-Smad3 association. regions and amino acids are shown in blue, and negatively charged regions are in red. co-IP experiment was carried out in HEK293FT cells as in Fig. 2B. HEK293FT cells (A) or R1B/L17 cells (B) were transfected with constructs encoding CAGA-luciferase reporter (200 ng) together with Renilla luciferase (20 ng), ca-TRI (50 ng), Smad3 (50 ng), Smad4 (50 ng), and Smad7 (100 ng) at 20 h post-transfection, cells were treated with or without 100 pm TGF-1 se reporter assays were done similarly as in D in HEK293FT cells. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pFR-luciferase, nonspecific (NS) shRNA (100 ng), or Smad7-tergeting shRNA (100 ng) at 20 h post transfection, cells were treated with or without 10 m SB431542 (SB) overnight. the gal4-luciferase reporter was activated by Gal4-Smad3 overexpression. however, Smad7 attenuated the activity of Smad3 even in the presence of the TRI kinase inhibitor SB431542, strongly suggesting that the effect of Smad7 is partly due to autocrine TGF- activity. hep3B cells treated with or without TGF-1 ligands were subjected to co-IP. to further characterize their interactions, we expressed Smad7, R-Smad proteins (Smad2/3 and Smad1/8), Smad4 and the other inhibitory Smad Smad6 in HEK293FT cells. wild-type Smad3 was able to induce the CAGA-luciferase reporter expression. TGF-1 enhanced the effect of wild-type Smad3, comparable with that of 2D mutant. HEK293FT cells were expressed in HEK293FT cells. at 40 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 for 1 h. if protein A and B could associate with one another in vivo, the protein A-fused N-terminal part of EYPF (EYFP(N) and protein B-fused C-terminal part of Venus (Venus(C) would be brought together and reconstitute functional fluorescent proteins the kinetics of the R-Smad-Smad7 interaction in MDA-MB-231 cells stably express FLAG-Smad7. the cells were treated with TGF-1, harvested at different time points, and subjected to anti-Smad2/3 immunoprecipitation and anti-Smad4 immunoblotting. the kinetics was very similar to the one of phospho-Smad2. truncations containing the MH2 domain were capable of inhibiting the ca-TRI-induced CAGA-luciferase reporter expression and the Gal4-Smad3-mediated Gal4-luciferase reporter activation. these results together demonstrate that the MH2 domains of Smad3 and Smad7 mediate their interaction. pFR-luciferase reporter assays were performed in HEK293FT cells. cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-1 (G) or 25 ng/ml BMP2 (H) for 20 h before harvested. to exclude this possibility, we co-expressed ca-TRI and HA-Smad3 in different sets of cells. Y mutant showed an attenuated inhibitory effect, in comparison to those of the wild-type or NLS-tagged Smad7. the four amino acids Lys-312, Lys-316, Lys-410, and Arg-409 are important for Smad7 to interact with both TRI and R-Smads. the binding of WW-HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases could play a role in Smad7-mediated inhibition of R-Smad activity. Smad7 interferes with the R-Smad-Smad4 hetero-complex formation. FT cells were mixed with separately expressed Myc-Smad7. co-IP was carried out at 40 h post-transfection. the 4E Smad7 mutant no longer interacts with Smad3. however, the PY motif-deleted (PY) and the NLS-tagged Smad7 that retained the ability to associate with Smad3 decreased the Smad3-Smad4 interaction. HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pFR-Luc (200 ng), Renilla (20 ng), Gla4-DBD (50 ng), Gal4-Smad1/3 (50 ng), wild-type Smad7 (25, 50, 100 ng) and the PY mutant (25, 50, 100 ng) and treated with (A) or without (B) 100 pm TGF-1 overnight before harvested for luciferas NEDD4L shRNA (N4L, 100 ng), Smad7 shRNA (S7, 100 ng) and a nonspecific (NS) control shRNA were transfected into HEK293T cells. NEDD4L gene silence efficiency was detected by immunoblotting. ectopic wild-type Smad7 inhibited endogenous Smad2/3-Smad4 interaction while enhancing the Smad2/3-NEDD4L binding. ectopic wild-type Smad7 inhibited endogenous Smad2/3-Smad4 interaction. deletion of the PY motif exhibited an attenuated effect. Smad7 promotes polyubiquitination and degradation of active R-Smads through recruiting NEDD4L. MH2 domains mediate both Smad-Smad and the Smad-TRI interactions (9, 11) mutation of these residues impaired the Smad3-Smad4 interaction. four (Lys-312, Lys-316, Lys-401, and Arg-409) have been reported to mediate binding of Smad7 to TRI. simultaneous mutation of the four residues to glutamic acids (4E mutant) disabled the Smad7-Smad3 association. the effects of wild-type and mutant Smad7 on the activity of ca-TRI or Smad3 were shown in HEK293FT cells. the lysates were mixed as indicated before co-IP analysis. the lysates were mixed as indicated before co-IP analysis. our results demonstrate that Smad7 executes its inhibitory effect at another layer by directly inhibiting R-Smad activity. the MH2 domains mediate homo-oligomerization and hetero-oligomerization of R-Smads or Co-Smad. mutation of four basic amino acids impairs the Smad3-Smad7 interaction. a previous study showed that the interaction depends on ligand-activated R-Smads (37) it is possible that Smad7 interacts with either Smad3 or Smad4 and thus prevents the R-Smad-Smad4 complex formation. however, we cannot rule out other possibilities, as Smad7 can form a homodimer. Moreover, Smad6, the other inhibitory Smad that is more specifically involved in BMP pathways, was also able to oligomer NEDD4L has been shown to associate with and degrade both Smad2 and Smad3 upon TGF- signaling. in this study we found that Smad7 enhanced the interaction of Smad2/3 with NEDD4L and facilitated NEDD4L-induced polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of phospho-Smad3. NEDD4L degrades both Smad2 and Smad3 upon TGF- signaling (41, 43) and X. L. prepared plasmids for the Gal4-luciferase reporter system. established the MDA-MB-231 stable cells."}
