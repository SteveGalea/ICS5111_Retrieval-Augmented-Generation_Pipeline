{"summary": "pore translocation of knotted DNA rings has become an important tool for probing DNA properties. this technique was used to detect knots that form spontaneously in DNA filaments. this technique was used to detect knots that form spontaneously in DNA filaments and can hence impact their in vivo functionality. study identifies, characterizes, and values wind and solar electricity resources for 21 countries in the Eastern and Southern Africa Power Pools. the most competitive wind and solar resources are spatially uneven, but international transmission could allow the region as whole benefit from \u201cno-regrets\u201d or low-cost, low-impact, and highly accessible resources. international energy trade also lowers system costs by reducing the need for conventional power plants and allows lower impact, more accessible renewable energy sites to be cost competitive. systems capable of predicting which drugs affect embryonic development rely almost exclusively on prenatal animal testing. the system was used to screen a library of chemicals (1,280 drugs) and two compounds were identified as specific inhibitors of human embryonic vasculature. a phosphomimetic mutant of cytochrome c exhibits enhanced dynamics, which could be responsible for the observed differences in cytochrome c functionality in oxidative stress and cell death. phosphorylation of cytochrome c becomes a target for further development of robust therapeutic approaches. e, R\u00e9gis Pom\u00e8s, Ning Zheng, and William A. Catterall Bacterial voltage-gated sodium channels serve as models of their vertebrate counterparts. in the closed state, the activation gate fully occludes the conduction pathway and the intracellular C-terminal domain is revealed as a long four-helix bundle. we show that myoD expression is regulated by modulation of histone methylation in its promoter region by the histone demethylase, Jjmd1c. these data provide insight into the epigenetic control of gene expression in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. a model vertebrate embryo is undergoing a metabolic evolution. the self-organization of ecosystems is a major challenge. we addressed this challenge using dominant oceanic photosynthetic and heterotrophic microbes. xenograft mice showed no toxicity of the auNRs-PPTT. the apoptosis pathway was significantly perturbed. the apoptosis pathway was significantly perturbed. a small animal model can provide an important tool to better understand the disease. we humanized the mouse locus of the virus receptor DPP4, preserving native DPP4 expression. the resultant virus causes fatal lung disease that includes diffuse alveolar damage and immune dysregulation. clin-1 effectively blocks autophagy-mediated clearance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments. the accumulated APP-C99 can be further processed by -secretase. the chemical inhibition of ErbB2 by CL-387,785 effectively rescues the cognitive impairment of APP/presenilin-1 transgenic AD mice. long noncoding miRNA gene represses wheat -diketone waxes. many wheat cultivars accumulate diketone epicuticular waxes in reproductive-age plants that produce a glaucous appearance."}
