{"summary": "apoD is a lipocalin that mainly associates with HDL3 (small dense high density lipoprotein) [1] in human plasma and to a lesser degree with LDL (low density lipoprotein) and VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) the protein migrates as a 28\u201330 kD band in SDS-PAGE [2], [3]. apoD is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, notably by glial cells in the brain and by a mouse model of lethal coronary heart disease showed that the protective effect of apoD extends to the heart. the over-expression of ApoD also suppresses inflammation induced by Corona virus-induced encephalitis [14]. ApoD appears to act in the brain to protect from oxidative stress and inflammation and to distribute lipids. apoD is expressed by a variety of cells and is upregulated upon growth arrest (quiescence) in cell lines [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] an important function of HDL particles is to deliver lipids to LDL and VLDL particles. apoD may provide an important link in the interaction between lipoproteins and between lipoproteins and cells. the 7-B6-1 mAb against human IFN- and the IL4-I mAb against IL-4 (all from Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) a positive control antibody against human thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) was used for immunostaining the T24 cells. this recombinant apoD was modified at the following positions. the bladder carcinoma cell line T24 (ATCC, Manassas, USA) was cultured in either DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, BRL, Life Technology Ltd. Paisley, Scotland) with 10% FBS (HyClone, Thermo Scientific) blood samples Finger blood was obtained from consenting healthy volunteers by piercing the top of the finger with a lancet and recovering 20 l blood with an adjustable pipette and a 2% azide, except for mAb LDL20, and 100 l per well were added to 96-well ELISA plates (Costar, corning, NY, USA) after a two hour incubation, the plates were blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS azide (incubation buffer) for a further two hours at room temperature or in the refrigerator overnight. cells were seeded 24 hours before the experiment, whereas confluent cells were seeded 5 days before. cells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI buffered with 20 mM HEPES. 200 l of 1 g/ml HDL were added to each well, with or without 100 ng/ml. antibodies were loaded at a concentration of 5 g/ml, apoD at 2 g/ml and HDL2, HDL3 and LDL at 100 g/ml. the loading time was 3 minutes for antibodies and 5 min for lipoproteins. supernatants from the confluent cultures were collected 24 hours after changing the media. cell pellet was re-suspended in 100 l PBS and 3 ml of a freshly prepared buffer of PBS with 0.5% TritonX100 and 2% paraformaldehyde. after 10 minutes fixation at room temperature, the cells were resuspended by adding 9 ml PBS and then pelleted again by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 minutes. the remaining reactive groups were inactivated by addition of 1% glycine cells were washed with PBS containing 2.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.3% TritonX100. cells were then blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 1% glycine for 30 min. after 1 h, cells were stained for 5 min with DAPI (1 g/ml) apoB, the E981 mAB against apoE, the J29 and J84 mAbs against apoH and two control mAbs, the 7-B6-1 mAb against human IFN- and the IL4-I mAb against IL-4 (all from Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden). a positive control antibody against human thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) was used for immunostaining the T apoD was eluted with 0.7% HAC and immediately flash-frozen. the bladder carcinoma cell line T24 (ATCC, Manassas, USA) was cultured in either DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, BRL, Life Technology Ltd. Paisley, Scotland) with 10% FBS (HyClone, Thermo Scientific) blood samples Finger blood was obtained from consenting healthy volunteers by piercing the top of the finger with coating antibodies were diluted to 2 g/ml in PBS with 0.02% azide. mAb LDL20 was used at 1 g/ml, and 100 l per well were added to 96-well ELISA plates. plates were then washed in an automatic ELISA washer using PBS. 2.4 ApoD-mediated cell binding of HDL T24 bladder carcinoma cells was seeded onto 48-well plates (Costar) at varying concentrations to generate both confluent and non-confluent cells. cells were seeded 24 hours before the experiment, whereas confluent cells were seeded 5 days before to obtain full contact (confluency) anti-apoD and control mAbs E981 (anti-apoE) and 7-B6-1 (anti-IFN isotype control for D544) were added to Streptavidin-coated biosensor surfaces. rinsing and addition of purified apoD and/or lipoprotein particles were performed using a volume of 250 l. ached cells were transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and resuspended with a pipette to obtain a single cell suspension. the cells were washed once in PBS and after sedimentation at 250 g for 10 minutes, the cell pellet was re-suspended in 100 l PBS and 3 ml of a freshly prepared buffer of PBS with 0.5% TritonX100 and 2% paraformaldehyde. cells were incubated for 2 days (non-confluent) or 9 days (confluent) in a 37\u00b0C incubator. cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 2.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.3% TritonX100. cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 1% glycine for 30 min, followed by washing and incubation with primary antibodies at room apoD and apoB performed a dual-specific ELISA using the anti-apoD mAb D554 as a capture antibody and a biotinylated anti-apoB mAb, LDL20, for detection. the absence of detergent maintains the structure of intact lipoprotein particles. the particles are immobilized using one specific antibody. anti-apoD antibodies capture ApoB in a detergent-free dual specific ELISA. ELISA with antibodies against apoE, apoH or apoJ results in weak or absent signals. finger blood plasma, in figures B and C, was arbitrary calculated as half the finger blood volume. of the ten donors, no. 1\u20135 were women, and no. 6\u201310 were men, all between 30\u201362 years old. apoB (LDL20-biotin) is a key factor in the interaction between lipoprotein particles. apoD is a key factor in the interaction between lipoprotein particles. apoD was purified from plasma by affinity chromatography in the presence of detergent. recombinant apoD (D544) was used as the capture antibody and anti-apoB (LDL20-biotin) was used as the detection antibody. apoA1 (100 ng/ml), HDL2 (1000 ng/ml), apoD (100 ng/ml) or apoD (100 ng/ml) were added. the binding gives lower values and these values are not raised as much by addition of purified apoD. the effect of adding extra apoD (100 ng/ml) to VLDL (1000 ng/ml) was analyzed using a dual-specific ELISA with or without detergent present. subsequently loaded with the LDL, HDL2 or HDL3 lipoprotein particles. between loading reagents, the sensors were rinsed for 30 seconds. the buffer used was PBS, azide, 0.1% BSA. apoD production was high in confluent, growth-arrested T24 cells. but apoD was abundant intracellularly, as shown by flow cytometry. apoD production in T24 cells was assayed by ELISA for culture supernatant. cells were washed and incubated with a negative isotype-control mAb (anti-IL4), a positive control anti-thioredoxin reductase mAb (anti-Trxred), or anti-apoD D544 mAb. cells were photographed with a leica DMRB fluorescent microscope. apoA1 was washed three times with protein-free RPMI. the cells were non-confluent and in B the cells were confluent. p-values were calculated using two-way ANOVA with GraphPad Prism 6. the detection mAb LDL20-biotin in Fig. 2A could be replaced by a different anti-apoB antibody, LDL17-biotin, with comparable results. diluting the plasma yielded very similar titration curves from the dual-specific ELISA as the same plasma from an apoB-specific ELISA. the means SD of four replicates are shown. results within each panel are from the same donor. experiments A\u2013D were repeated three times using the same donor. only small amounts of apoB bound to D544 when detergent was present, indicating that intact lipoprotein particles are needed for the apoD-LDL interaction. when we reversed the system, using LDL20 as the capture antibody, no complexes could be detected. HDL2 contained some apoB, which often happens when HDL2 is contaminated with dense LDL. ApoB (ng) ApoD (ng) HDL2 (1 g) 106 12.9 HDL3 (1 g) ND* 68.9 LDL (1 g) 1290 7.9 VLDL (1 g) 280 6.1 ApoD (100 ng) ND**: not detected; the amount was lower than 0.12 ng/1 g HDL3 apoA1, HDL2, HDL3, apoD or recombinant apoD were added. the control without LDL is shown in grey bars. p-values were calculated using the Mann-Whitney test with GraphPad prism 6. anti-apoD mAb D544 bound purified LDL due to presence of apoD in some of the LDL particles. the mAb D263 yielded similar results (S3 Figure) subsequent reactions show the addition of HDL2 in red, HDL3 in grey, apoD in green and blue, or buffer in black to the preloaded antibodies. as expected, the antibody also bound HDL3 and HDL2 to an extent reflecting the amount of apoD in the respective particle. three flasks each of confluent cells (2.5 million in 9 ml) and non-confluent cells (1.5 million in 7 ml) were sampled 4 times by apoD ELISA. apoA1 (HDL) content in the soluble fraction was assayed. similar experiments with LDL showed that apoD did not help LDL bind to the cells. T24 cells grown in 24-well plates were washed with protein-free RPMI two times and 200 l/well RPMI supplemented with 0.1%BSA was added with or without HDL. the affinity of a single apoD is not sufficient to withstand repeated washings and incubations of the ELISA protocol. adding purified apoD helped recombinant apoD to bind more LDL, indicating that the apoD contact with LDL is a very rapid event. the binding was considerably faster if the antibodies preloaded with apoD. HDL3 has a higher density than HDL2 but carries more apoD. apoD is more important than HDL2 for protection against oxidative stress. in animal experiments, apoD has been shown to be important in protecting against oxidative stress. non-confluent cells produce, but do not export, apoD. apoD helps to supply lipids to growing cells, presumably via an apoD-recognizing receptor. apoD is important not only for brain and nerve functions but also for controlling inflammation and macrophage homeostasis. identifying and characterizing the potential cellular receptor for apoD will also be necessary. the mabtech ApoD standard was purified by affinity purification from EDTA aprotinin plasma in the presence of a reducing agent. D (2 g/ml) or buffer-control (120 seconds), then rinsed again and loaded with 100 g/ml LDL (120 seconds)."}
