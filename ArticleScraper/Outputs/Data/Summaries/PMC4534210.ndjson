artiodactyls\u2013cattle or carnivorans\u2013cattle interface, respectively, referred to bovine tuberculosis. only publications with one disease (n = 13,293) were included in analysis. time-series analysis of publications on AI and bTB revealed that the number of publications was highly positively correlated with media coverage and research funding for these specific diseases. long-term trends in rates of publication on diseases at the top three wildlife\u2013livestock interfaces Interface Changepoint year SE Intercept. the bird\u2013poultry interface was the most frequently cited wildlife\u2013livestock interface worldwide, ranking first in Asia, Europe, and North America. other interfaces reflected regional circumstances, as illustrated by the marsupial\u2013cattle interface

infections 97 21 0.13 Trichomonosis 98 21 0.13 Duck virus study is first to apply a scoping review framework to identify infectious diseases at the wildlife\u2013livestock interface. results suggest a growing interest by the scientific community in this area. in some cases (such as AI and bTB) these trends could be traced to key disease events that stimulated public interest and research funding. rates of publication on diseases at the bird\u2013poultry and artiodactyls\u2013cattle interfaces have more than doubled in the past decade. rates of publication on diseases at the bird\u2013poultry and artiodactyls\u2013cattle interfaces have more than doubled in the past decade. investments have been proportionate to perceptions of disease at the wildlife\u2013livestock interface, rather than actual costs associated with, e.g., animal and human morbidity, livestock production losses, and conservation impacts. only 18% of the publications in this review addressed diseases at the wildlife\u2013pig interface. emerging infectious diseases (42\u201344) do however illustrate the potential importance of bat\u2013livestock interfaces in emerging zoonotic diseases. trend in agricultural expansion and intensification of the wildlife interface is particularly strong in recent decades in tropical systems, associated with external economic and development pressures. authors deferred to lists of livestock and wildlife diseases deemed important by the OIE and OIE Working Group on Wildlife Diseases. the latter includes all OIE-listed (notifiable) diseases that affect wild animals, as well as some nonlisted diseases that have particular relevance to wildlife health and conservation. the categorization of species into livestock and wildlife is already to some extent arbitrary and not straightforward. a good understanding of ecosystem dynamics for most multihost infectious diseases is still widely lacking. search terms for wildlife and livestock were derived from standard nomenclature volumes for mammals (55) and birds (56) and comprised the Latin genus or species name and the common genus name. the review focused on terrestrial mammals and birds; hence, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates were excluded. the literature search was conducted through the platform Web of Knowledge (version 5.12), which provided combined access to the following six databases. all databases were searched in English from their first entries to 2013 using the topic search. non-English publications were only obtained if they included a translated title or abstract. results were visualized as maps and plotted using the lattice (61) and ggplot2 (62) packages in RStudio. piecewise models were fitted to estimate long-term trends in publication rates. major news and business circulations (as defined by Factiva) were included as the source. news reports were limited to English language; no restrictions were placed on region. data on global research funding for AI and bTB was not available. disease search terms comprised common and scientific names of pathogens including abbreviations. terms for geographic regions comprised of United Nations\u2019 sanctioned names of countries (58), continents, and geographical subregions. no geographic restrictions were applied to provide a worldwide overview. complete search strings are available upon request. publications without an abstract and publications clearly indexed as review, editorial, or errata were excluded. results were visualized as maps and plotted using the lattice (61) and ggplot2 (62) packages in RStudio. a standard Poisson regression model was fitted to each series using the glm function in RStudio. this method takes into account potential piecewise linear relationships. Davies\u2019 test was used to test for a significant difference in slope before and after the estimated changepoint. sx (1.4MB, xlsx)"}
