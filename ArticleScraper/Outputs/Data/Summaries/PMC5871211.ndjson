{"summary": "methods The national library of medicine database was searched from its earliest records through august 2015. the type of search was limited to English language studies. the review was conducted according to the guidelines for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies. the administration of oral maoto granules to adults with seasonal influenza was well tolerated and associated with equivalent clinical and virological efficacy to neuraminidase inhibitors. two studies did not reveal differences between the ginseng extract and placebo in terms of decreasing duration, severity, or frequency of overall symptoms. predy et al22 demonstrated that the ginseng extract can efficiently reduce the influenza-like illness incidence. antiwei, a traditional Chinese prescription in the treatment of natural influenza, was found effective and well tolerated in treatment of natural influenza infection in adults. Echinacea hot drink was investigated on 473 patients in the Czech Republic. it was found as effective as oseltamivir in early treatment of clinically diagnosed and virologically confirmed influenza virus infections with a reduced risk of complications and adverse events. Clinacanthus siamensis leaf extract showed activity in vitro and in vivo tests on influenza virus. after oral administration, the extract produced a higher anti-influenza virus IgG and IgA antibodies compared with oseltamivir. an aqueous extract from Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. the extract showed preventive effects on mice against lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes. the aforementioned herbal therapies for respiratory viruses are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Herbal Therapies for Respiratory Viruses. aMaoto contains 4 herbs: Ephedrae Herba, Cinnamomi Cortex, Armeniacae Semen, and Glycyrrhizae Radix. oral administration of zinc may reduce the length and severity of colds. for majority of people taking vitamin C supplements only slightly reduces the length and severity of colds. probiotic may be used as a prophylactic agent in the management of influenza. a live and nonlive lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 also showed protective effects against influenza virus infection by enhancement of natural killer cell activity. mekabu fucoidan intake increased antibody production after vaccination. some studies found beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation for influenza prevention. others concluded no favorable effects of such supplement. Lactoferrin administration enhances natural killer cell activity and Th1 cytokine responses, which lead to protection against viral infections. Table 2 lists some dietary supplements effective against respiratory viruses. the coronavirus was found to be quite stable at pH 6.0 and 37\u00b0C (half-life, approximately 24 hours) but was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by brief treatment at pH 8.0 and 37\u00b0C (half-life, approximately 30 minutes) alkaline forming diet or drinks could induce low-grade metabolic alkalosis which causes only very small increases in blood pH within the range considered to be normal. molecules such as hydrogen peroxide, oxidized halogens, chloramines, and oxidizing radicals accumulate at the site of inflammation. to restore their electrical neutrality, these agents tear electrons from the structures of invading organisms and damaged cells, rapidly destroying them. evidence comes from studies of the role of electrons in mitigating the consequences of inflammation when living systems are connected to the earth. earthing revealed anti-inflammatory effects and immunity enhancement. no previous studies were found regarding earthing in patients with influenza or upper respiratory tract infections."}
