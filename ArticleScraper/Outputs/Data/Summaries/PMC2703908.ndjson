{"summary": "traditional molecular phylogeny makes use of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequences or a few orthologous proteins. some more recent phylogenomic studies are based on concatenation of a larger number of proteins. some tree files are provided to facilitate comparison with taxonomy. CVTree server is a useful complement to phylogenetic projects such as AToL or AFTOL. one collects all protein products in a genome and counts the number of (overlapping) K-tuples to form a raw CV with 20K or 4K components. CVTree implements a two-step strategy to produce phylogenetic trees. in the first step, CVTree reads in each genome sequence and counts the frequency of all K-tuples. then the CV of each organism is calculated and dumped to the hard disk. the ffn files are locally extracted from the gbk files. only chromosomal sequences are used. the NCBI Taxonomy ID of fungi is assigned manually. up to 100 M disk space can be used for a user's; uncompressed sequences in a project. in the inbuilt genome page, one can use the keyword filter to pick up the species of interest. a keyword \u2018Streptococcus\u2019 would show up all the 38 species/strains in this genus. project space and the example project will bring up a preselected list of bacteria and archaea names from the inbuilt database. users may recall a previous project by entering its project number. the project number also enables one to share the results with others. we suggest users always to create a new project to do their analysis. inbuilt genome page This page shows the organism list of all inbuilt genomes. the default view shows organism name, proteome size (or cDNA length for DNA sequences) in MB, accession number for chromosome sequences and the superkingdom label extracted from NCBI Taxonomy Browser. two ASCII tree format files: NJtree.nwk for a full tree and Genus NJtree.nwk for a tree collapsed to genus level. these files can be displayed directly in any text editor with monospace font. the result page appears with the five file names listed in the upper part and the NJtree.txt displayed as default in the lower window. the collapsing process requires the knowledge of organism lineage. the NCBI Taxonomic Browser is more dynamic and up-to-date compared to the taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea. the tree page and tree page are directly uploadable to a user's; iTOL personal account in order to be displayed in a different manner. all the files in the result page and tree page are sent to the user if an email is given in the project page. user can select inbuilt genomes from the inbuilt genome page. the default view shows organism name, proteome size (or cDNA length for DNA sequences) in MB, accession number for chromosome sequences and superkingdom label extracted from NCBI Taxonomy Browser. the 'Download selected genomes' button will be enabled. the user will be asked to wait while the selected sequence files are being prepared for downloading. the link remains available as long as the project has not been destroyed or the user does not choose some other genomes to download again. we collapse an original genome tree to different taxonomic levels. at the phylum level the 36 species/strains classified as Cyanobacteria do form a monophyletic branch. the reduction can only be partial, as the phylum Proteobacteria does not appear as a monophyletic group in a tree. the new CVTree web server comes with a greater, monthly auto-updated inbuilt database, with a more user-friendly and intuitive interface. a phylogenetic tree of more than 900 genomes will be calculated in several hours if the job runs from scratch. the implementation of CVTree to meet the need of efficiently processing thousands of genomes is welcome.
