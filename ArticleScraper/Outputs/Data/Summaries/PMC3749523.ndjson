{"summary": "a previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from a 60-year-old patient who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. in retrospect, a cluster of respiratory infections in Jordan (April 2012) was linked to the same agent, although no convincing evidence for human-to-human transmission was obtained. in the past year, various names have been used to refer to this newly identified CoV. two years later, bats were identified as the most likely animal reservoir for this zoonotic CoV (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005), and two additional human CoVs (NL63 and HKU1) were also identified. the possibility of SARS-CoV re-emergence or zoonotic transfer of other animal CoVs has remained a public health concern over the past 10 years. innate responses, including those triggered by activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway, have been described as preventing IFN induction/signalling. treatment with type I IFNs can inhibit CoV replication in mice. linghouse et al., 1984; haagmans et al., 2004; Paragas et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2004; linghouse et al., 2004; linghouse et al., 2004; linghouse et al., 2004;. Paragas & Siddell, 2005; Taguchi & Siddell, 2005;. Taguchi & Sidde hybridization analysis of viral RNA accumulation revealed presence of genome RNA and seven sg transcripts. the relative abundance of the various sg mRNAs was similar to what has been observed for other CoVs. the smallest species, encoding the nucleocapsid protein, was by far the most abundant transcript. fected cells using an oligonucleotide recognizing the viral genome and all sg mRNAs. additional minor bands of 3 and 4 kb were observed (*) and may represent additional viral mRNA species that remain to be studied in more detail. however, the corresponding positions in the ORF4a/b and ORF5 coding regions do not contain a canonical core TRS sequence. rabbit antisera raised against synthetic peptides (23mers) represent a small but conserved C-terminal part of SARS-CoV and MHV nsp4 strongly cross-reacted with MERS-CoV nsp4. only small but apparently immunogenic parts of these peptides (e.g. LYQPP) are absolutely conserved between MHV and MERS-CoV nsp4. conservation in other betacoronaviruse monolayers of vero, vero E6, Huh7 and Calu3/2B4 cells were infected with MERS-CoV (m.o.i. of 5) and double-labelled for dsRNA (green) and nsp3 (red) mAb recognizing dsRNA localizes intermediates in viral RNA synthesis. images of similarly prepared MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells were included for comparison. low magnification images of a cell containing a small cluster of DMVs (a), enlarged in (b) some cells are indicated by black arrowheads and the inset displays a higher magnification of the boxed DMV in (b) DMVs ranged from 150 to 320 nm, comparable to what was measured previously for SARS-CoV-infected cells. a dense inner DMV core became apparent when HPF was employed. a similar dense inner DMV core became apparent when HPF was employed. similar observations were made for Calu3/2B4 cells. in contrast, MERS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells showed only mild CPE starting at 3 days p.i. cell death was not complete after 6 days. cytotoxicity was measured using a commercial cell viability assay. moderate CPE was observed on day 2 and cell viability in uninfected cells had dropped below 10 %. by day 3 cell viability in uninfected cells had dropped to 79 or 24 %. Huh7 cells were infected (dark shading) or not (light shading) with MERS-CoV (m.o.i. of 0.005) both assays confirmed an almost complete block of MERS-CoV infection. both assays confirmed an almost complete block of MERS-CoV infection. a small fraction of MERS-CoV-infected cells appeared to be refractive to CsA treatment and supported a low level of MERS-CoV replication. treatment with PEG-IFN profoundly inhibited both MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-induced CPE and RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. decreased CPE was also observed in SARS-CoV-infected cultures treated with 30 ng PEG-IFN ml1. treatment of MERS-CoV-infected cells with the same PEG-IFN dose completely blocked CPE and reduced viral RNA levels in the medium by 600- to 2000-fold. MERS-CoV does not encode a homologue of the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein. the ORF6 protein blocks the IFN-induced nuclear translocation of p-STAT1. this makes SARS-CoV less sensitive to treatment with type I IFN. cells from a variety of mammalian hosts have been found to be susceptible. infection can induce pronounced cytopathology and cell death. a few laboratory studies on MERS-CoV replication have been reported. viral mRNAs could be readily detected at 7 h post-infection (p.i.) levels remained more or less constant until 24 h p.i. in vero cells. the amount isolated from Huh7 cells declined due to the more rapid development of cytopathology in this cell line. mRNA sizes were calculated on the basis of the TRS positions in the viral genome sequence. antisera raised against non-structural proteins of other betacoronaviruses cross-react with MERS-CoV proteins. conservation in other betacoronaviruses suggests antisera recognizing this nsp4 region may be used for immunodetection of additional (newly emerging) coVs. a) rabbit antisera raised against SARS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus nsps cross-react with MERS-CoV proteins. mAb recognizing dsRNA to localize intermediates in viral RNA synthesis. the immunolabelling signals for both replicase and dsRNA localized to the perinuclear region (Fig. 2c) the preservation of such structures, typically double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), was previously improved significantly. extensive membrane alterations in the perinuclear region are shown in (c), with the boxed area displayed at higher magnification in (d), where CMs (white arrows, inset) embedded in clusters of DMVs (black arrowheads) can be observed. for comparison, (e) shows the unaltered cytoplasm of a mock-infected cell. a similar dense DMV core became apparent when HPF was employed. this observation strengthens the notion that DMV formation precedes the development of CMs. in cell culture, many CoVs induce severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 expression on vero and Huh7 cells correlated with susceptibility to MERS-CoV. monolayers of vero (a), Calu3/2B4 (b), Vero E6 (c) and Huh7 (d) cells were infected with MERS-CoV (m.o.i. of 0.05) m.o.i. of 0.005, and Huh7 and vero cells were infected for 2 or 3 days. mock-infected cells (no virus) were used as a reference for unchanged cell viability. all experiments were repeated at least twice. infected Vero cells were treated with 3 or 9 M CsA and analysed at 3 days p.i. treatment with 9 M completely inhibited CPE and left cell viability unchanged. both assays confirmed an almost complete block of MERS-CoV infection. treatment with PEG-IFN profoundly inhibited both MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-induced CPE and RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. at 2 days p.i., CPE was reduced for all time points of PEG-IFN addition when using a dose of at least 30 ng PEG-IFN ml1. vero cells were infected with 100 TCID50 virus per well (a, b) at 2 days p.i., cells were examined for CPE. effect of PEG-IFN treatment on CPE induced by SARS-CoV (a) or MERS-CoV (b) is shown. IFN-induced translocation of p-STAT1 was readily observed in IFN-treated mock-infected vero cells. in contrast, in MERS-CoV-infected and IFN-treated cultures, the translocation of p-STAT1 was detected. at least three of the four current \u2018established\u2019 human CoVs (NL63, 229E and OC43) were postulated to have originated from zoonotic reservoirs. recently, about a decade after the SARS outbreak, MERS-CoV was identified as the next zoonotic CoV (Zaki et al., 2012) low-micromolar CsA concentrations blocked MERS-CoV-induced CPE in vero and Huh7 cells (9 and 15 M, respectively) a small fraction of the cells somehow remained susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, even at high CsA concentrations. this could be a valuable and rapid tool in screening for the potential antiviral activity of small-molecule compounds. the lack of a SARS-CoV homologue may be a major factor in the higher sensitivity of MERS-CoV to PEG-IFN treatment. this was substantiated further by the finding that nuclear translocation of p-STAT1 is not blocked in MERS-CoV-infected cells. MHV has been shown to be relatively insensitive to IFN pre-treatment. sensitivity of MERS-CoV to exogenous IFN suggests administration of recombinant IFN merits further evaluation as a therapeutic intervention strategy if new infections with this novel virus occur. antisera recognizing the SARS-CoV replicase subunits nsp3, nsp4, nsp5 and nsp8 have been described previously. p-STAT1 was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled mouse anti-STAT1. FITC-labelled anti-rabbit IgG was used to enhance the green fluorescence. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope with an Axiocam HRc camera or with a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 700) EM. Vero cells were grown on sapphire discs and fixed at 8 h p.i. for 30 min at room temperature. imaging was performed in an FEI Tecnai12 TWIN electron microscope. images were acquired using binning mode 2. intracellular viral RNA analysis was carried out as described previously. cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1104 or 2104 cells per well. after overnight growth, cells were infected with an m.o.i. of 0.005 or 0.05. differences in cell viability caused by virus-induced CPE or compound-specific side effects were analysed. at 4 h p.i., RNA was isolated from 50 l cell-culture supernatant. at 48 h p.i., CPE was also scored microscopically as either none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or complete (4). for p-STAT1 nuclear translocation experiments, vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (m.o.i. of 1). men et al., 2012) at high m.o.i. (m.o.i. of 5) was carried out in PBS containing 50 g DEAE-dextran ml1 and 2 % FCS. all work with live MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was performed inside biosafety cabinets. infection was detected using the above-mentioned anti-nsp3 sera and Alexa Fluor 594-labelled anti-rabbit IgG. a 10 mM stock was stored in aliquots for single use at 20 \u00b0C. cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde in PBS. freeze substitution was performed in an automated system (Leica AFS2) using as freeze-substitution medium acetone containing 1 % OsO4, 0.5 % uranyl acetate and 10 % H2O. first, the samples were kept at 90 \u00b0C for 6 h in this medium and then slowly warmed to 20 \u00b0C within 14 h. after washing with acetone, the samples were gradually infiltrated with epoxy resin LX-112 and polymer RNA from 200 l culture medium of CoV-infected cells was isolated with a MagnaPure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Roche) and eluted in 100 l. RT-PCR conditions for quantifying MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV RNA and amplification parameters have been described previously. at t = 0 h, all wells were washed with PBS and infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. after 1 h, 150 l medium was added to cultures of t = 4 or t = 0. 100 l medium was added to untreated cultures, which at 4 h p.i. received 50 l medium supplemented with PEG-IFN to reach a final concentration of 0\u20131000 ng PEG Huh7 cells were grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Lonza) containing 8 % FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine (PAA), non-essential amino acids and antibiotics. inoculations with a low dose (m.o.i. of 0.05) of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (strain HKU-39849; Zeng et al., 2003) were carried out directly in EMEM antigens were a full-length recombinant SARS-CoV N protein and MHV nsp4. p-STAT1 was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled mouse anti-STAT1. FITC-labelled anti-rabbit IgG was used to enhance the green fluorescence. EM. Vero cells were grown on sapphire discs and fixed at 8 h p.i. for 30 min at room temperature with 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0.25 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PHEM buffer pH 6.9. cells were stored in fixative at 4 \u00b0C for 72 h and then high-pressure frozen using a Leica EM PACT2. viral mRNAs were detected by hybridization with a 32P-labelled oligonucleotide probe. equal loading was verified in a second hybridization using a 32P-labelled oligonucleotide probe (5\u2032-GCAAATCATCATCTAATC-3\u2032) recognizing 18S rRNA. infected cells were given CsA or DMSO (solvent control) prior to infection. at 4, 0 and 4 h p.i., cells were infected in the presence of the indicated concentration.
