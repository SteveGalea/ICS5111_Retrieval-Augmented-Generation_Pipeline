{"summary": "Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. this experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. the online questionnaire aimed to gather information about farmers\u2019 attitudes towards beak trimming. only two respondents indicated that they would probably not use beak-trimmed hens. light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important) other important problems included rearing, feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. pecking-related problems are more common in aviary systems, deep litter systems and enriched cages compared with traditional cages [1,2]. aviary systems seem to be less risky compared with a floor system, probably because multiple tiers in aviary systems offer greater possibilities for pecked birds to escape the peckers [14] beak trimming fails to completely prevent pecking-related problems. hens exhibit less ground pecking [29] and preening [31]. neuroma formation on the tip of the trimmed beak can also lead to long-term pain. in Finland, there are 270 laying hen farms with 300 laying hens. the questionnaire reached about 90% of Finnish egg producers. the study defined feather pecking as pecking that damaged feather cover. the last topic investigated the farmers\u2019 estimates of the most effective preventive measures (additional enrichment, such as straw bales, hanging objects and pecking stones) the most important factor received five points, and the least important factor one point. results and discussion We received a total of 35 responses, of which seven (20%) were from organic farms. most farms (20, 60%) had a single hen house. the number of houses (and, thus, flocks) per farm varied between one and five. the production equipment was installed in hen houses between 1995 and 2016. on most farms, hens were kept in enriched cages. an aviary system was used in 18 (31%) of the houses and a floor system in 14 (24%) of the houses. organic production covers only about 5% of all egg production [34] and represents 15% of egg-producing farms. organic production is practiced in only 8% of egg-producing farms [36] due to climatic conditions, outside ranging poultry represents a minority in Finnish egg production. Finnish laying hen farmers' attitude towards beak trimming was explained by considering it to be an unnecessary and unethical procedure. a couple of respondents also stated that using non-beak-trimmed hens boosted the image of egg production. Finnish pig farmers motivated their stance against tail docking with ethical arguments. tail docking was often supported for economic reasons and because it made management easier [38]. 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Finnish egg producers consider cannibalism a less serious problem than pig farmers with respect to tail biting. the same proportion of the respondents indicated that no cannibalism would be acceptable. half of the farmers said that pecking problems typically occur during peak production. 43% of respondents estimated feather pecking had not occurred in any flocks during the last five years. organic farmers estimated that feather pecking occurred more often in their flocks during the last five years at a higher than tolerable levels. farmers may consider poor feather cover in older hens as a normal course of a hen\u2019s life without realizing that it might be due to feather pecking. small skin lesions caused by cannibalistic pecking could have remained undetected by farmers. most commonly, in 11 (31%) of the responses, losses were estimated not to exceed 1\u20135%. most commonly the respondents (15, 43%) estimated mortality due to pecking-related problems did not exceed 1\u20135%. one farmer, however, estimated that mortality could be as high as 11\u201320%. poor uniformity of body weights of the pullet flock 5.6 0.18 6 (3\u20137) Diseases 5.5 0.25 6 (2\u20137) Ectoparasites 5.4 0.25 6 (2\u20137) Light evenness 5.3 0.24 6 (2\u20137) Bird density 5.3 0.27 5 (2\u20137) Mortality 5.3 0.23 6 (2\u20137) Endoparasites 5.2 0.26 6 (1\u20137) Hot summer weather 5.1 0.23 6 (1\u20137) Origin of the birds 5.1 0.27 5 (1\u20137) Natural light the importance of light intensity on pecking behaviours has frequently been reported. bright light is associated with increased incidence of pecking problems. dim light reduces the incidence of pecking problems. the importance of farmers\u2019 and/or caretakers\u2019 management competence earned a mean score of 5.9. the importance of farmers\u2019 and/or caretakers\u2019 management competence earned a mean score of 5.9 and was highlighted throughout the responses. a house temperature of less than 20 \u00b0C is associated with a higher risk of feather pecking [15]. hen density plays an important role for pecking problems (mean 5.3). stress is an essential risk factor increasing a range of health and welfare problems, including pecking [18]. but without specifying the stressor, it remains too nonspecific to offer practical assistance in solving the problem. the survey also established a connection between parasites and pecking problems [15] that was also considered an important risk factor in the current study. problems during the rearing period had a high mean (5.9) and poor uniformity of body weights of the pullet flock and the source of the birds were considered important. signs of feather or skin damage in transported pullets were, however, only rarely (20, 57% of the responses) or never (15, 43% responses) observed. study of de Jong et al. (2013) found no differences between different bedding materials in relation to feather pecking. the importance of location and functionality of perches and nests was reported to be below 4 thus representing negligible risk factors. the relevance of perches and nests is probably considered lower in enriched cages. a questionnaire among egg producers in the uk suggested that offering communal nests for hens increases the likelihood of feather pecking. two respondents listed housing conditions as being most important. avoiding natural light leakage was twice considered to be the most important factor preventing pecking problems. but housing conditions rated considerably more important than natural light. beak trimming does not completely prevent pecking-related problems. however, feather pecking and cannibalism can arise in the presence of various stressors. only for straw bales was a mean of > 4 reached. 4.3 0.28 4 (1\u20137) Straw bales 4.1 0.94 3 (1\u20137) Hanging string 3.7 0.98 3 (2\u20137) Pecking stones 3.4 0.81 3 (1\u20137) Hanging objects 3.1 0.74 3 (1\u20137) * Scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important) removing the pecker and victim earned first places twice. removal of the pecker securing slightly higher total points. removing the pecker may be a more efficient way to respond. the seriousness of feather pecking on respondent farms was estimated on average as 2.2 0.22 (median 2, 1\u20136) and cannibalism 1.7 0.18 (median 1, 1\u20135) in 9 (26%) of the responses, 5\u20137% incidence of feather pecking was considered tolerable, while 23 (66%) stated that, at its highest level, an incidence of 5\u20137% would be tolerable. the average time for pecking problems is at the beginning or at the end of the production period, according to a questionnaire survey among egg producers in the uk. the typical time for pecking problems is at the beginning or at the end of the production period. organic farmers estimated that feather pecking occurred more often in their flocks during the last five years at a higher than tolerable level compared with conventional production. the majority of respondents reported that cannibalism did not occur in their current flock(s), while in nine current flocks (17%) 1\u20132% of the hens showed signs of cannibalism. farmers may consider poor feather cover in older hens as a normal course of a hen\u2019s life without realizing that it might be due to feather pecking. small skin lesions caused by cannibalistic pecking could have remained undetected by farmers because this would have required picking up hens for thorough investigation. one farmer estimated that mortality could be as high as 11\u201320%. pecking-related problems have a negative effect on egg production. the risk factor that was rated highest among all risks was light intensity. 0.18 6 (3\u20137) Diseases 5.5 0.25 6 (2\u20137) Ectoparasites 5.4 0.25 6 (2\u20137) Light evenness 5.3 0.24 6 (2\u20137) Bird density 5.3 0.27 5

Production system 4.9 0.26 the importance of light intensity on pecking behaviours has frequently been reported. bright light is associated with increased incidence of pecking problems. dim light reduces the incidence of pecking problems. the importance of farmers\u2019 and/or caretakers\u2019 management competence earned a mean score of 5.9. it is difficult to estimate time spent on observing birds because we received only 11 responses. time spent on observing birds ranged from 25 minutes to two hours per house. the practical experience of Finnish laying hen farmers supports earlier reports that repeatedly identify the maintenance of housing conditions as an important factor influencing pecking problems. a house temperature of less than 20 \u00b0C is associated with a higher risk of feather pecking [15]. risk factor increasing a range of health and welfare problems, including pecking [18]. but without specifying the stressor, it remains too nonspecific to offer practical assistance in solving the problem. survey showed an increased risk for pecking problems when the flock suffered from infectious bronchitis and egg peritonitis. birds at a young age can express all manner of pecking behaviour, including severe feather pecking [5,14,16] and cannibalism [4]. if birds have adopted a feather-pecking habit during rearing, the flock is at a higher risk of feather pecking during the laying period [4,5,14,16,41] foraging and scratching bedding depend on age and available material. young chicks prefer wood shavings while, over time, birds express more interest towards sand. the relevance of perches and nests is probably considered lower in enriched cages. a questionnaire among egg producers in the uk suggested that offering communal nests for hens increases the likelihood of feather pecking. the most important methods to prevent pecking problems and intervention measures to manage an ongoing pecking problem, according to Finnish egg producers. the most important factor received five points, and the least important factor one point. straw bales were more important among floor houses as compared with houses equipped with enriched cages accommodating >20 hens. only for straw bales was a mean of > 4 reached. the importance of hanging objects differed between housing types. a survey observing commercial farms over two consecutive flocks reported less severe feather pecking in the latter flock due to increased enrichment. the close follow-up of the farms could have improved the management of housing conditions and, thus, led to decreased pecking problems. removing the pecker and victim earned first place twice. removing the pecker securing slightly higher total points. removing the pecker may be a more efficient way to respond. hen farmers strongly presented negative attitude towards beak trimming. the main focus should be on managing housing conditions, especially lighting, and ensuring optimal feeding."}
