{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in 2014, human coronavirus (HCoV) caused not only upper respiratory infections but also LRTIs more commonly than in other years. researchers have become more interested in human coronaviruses (HCoV) in the Republic of Korea, a single HCoV infection was detected every month in 2013, except June through September, in Seoul. from 2010 to 2012, HCoV-OC43 was the most prevalent subtype. in 2014, HCoV positive rates were lower than in other years. all clinical data were collected by retrospective review of an electric medical record system. we defined LRTIs as pneumonia or bronchiolitis. when a patient had abnormal lung sounds, such as rales or crackles, with local infiltration or consolidation on chest X-ray. the peak incidence of HCoV in our hospital during the study period was during the 48th week of 2014. a certain amount of lag time between increases in nationwide HCoV infections and our hospital\u2019s pediatric LRTIs due to HCoV. the most frequent co-infection virus with HCoV was RSV. one patient with HCoV-CO43 and HCoV-NL63 infection, one with HCo-OC43, and rhinovirus was detected. most of them had a lower respiratory tract infection, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or bronchitis. a nebulizer was less commonly used in the CoV only-infected group. a nebulizer was less commonly used in the co-infected group. n (%) Antibiotic use 19 (86.4) 17 (100) 7 (100) 2 (100) Nebulizer use 14 (63.6) 17 (100) 7 (100) 2 (100) Steroid use 4 (18.2) 11 (64.7) 1 (14.3) 1 (50) HCoV, human coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus; PIV, parainfluenza virus. HCoV among total respiratory viruses in the same months of 2013 and 2014 was higher in 2014 than in 2013. in 2013, among the total 254 tested samples, 180 samples were positive, and among these, 48 samples were positive for HCoV. the positive rate for respiratory viruses was 67.9% (342 of 504 samples). HCoV was the third most frequently detected virus (9.7%) regardless of subtype. the peak incidence of HCoV in our hospital during the study period was during the 48th week of 2014. za virus 3 1 (0.2) Bocavirus 7 (1.4) Influenza virus 4 (0.8) Metapneumo virus 1 (0.2) RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. 71 samples had two viruses co-infection and 6 samples had three viruses coinfection. most common signs of HCoV infection were fever and cough. most of the patients had an abnormal chest X-ray, such as pneumonic infiltration, ground glass opacity, air trapping, and inter-costal lung herniation. most of the patients had a lower respiratory tract infection, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or bronchitis. 0 (0) 0 (0) Vomiting 1 (4.5) 1 (5.9) 0 (0) 0 (0) Vomiting 1 (4.5) 1 (5.9) 0 (0) 0 (0) Vomiting 2 (9.1) 9 (52.9) 2 (28.6) 1 (50) Chest retraction 1 (4.5) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Chest X-ray, n (%) Normal 6 (27.3) 0 (0) 0 HCoV only p value* Total patients 20 234 Age (month) 42.20 (0.38\u201384.78) 16.07 (2.73\u201334.87) 0.013 Sex (M:F %) 60:40 51.4:48.6 0.462 Fever day (day) 3.45 (1.88\u20135.02) 2.57(0.15\u20134.99) 0.112 Obstruction sign 25% 51.9% 0.033 HOD (day) 6.15 (0.65\u201312.95) 5. 2013 HCoV only 2014 HCoV only p value* Total patients 15/180 (8.3%) 48/342 (14.0%) Age (month) 20.67 (1.61\u201339.73) 42.20 (0.38\u201384.78) 0.060 Sex (M:F %) 58.3:41.7 60:40 0.926 Fever day (day) 3.00 (0.97\u20135.03) 3.45 (1.88\u20135.02) 0.519 Obstruction sign 41.7% pattern of co-detection of respiratory virus differs from each study. previous studies have reported that influenza virus follows RSV. however, our study showed that coV seemed to follow RSV. lower respiratory infections due to HCoV in children will increase within a few weeks. HCoV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis during the last winter season. despite this, HCoV induces pneumonia rather than bronchiolitis. HCoV can cause both URTIs and LRTIs during an epidemic season. LRTI due to HCoV will increase in 4\u20135 weeks."}
