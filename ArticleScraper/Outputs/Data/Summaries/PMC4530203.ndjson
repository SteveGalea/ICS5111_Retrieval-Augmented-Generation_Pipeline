{"summary": "leishmaniasis is a complex of diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. it is estimated that the most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), causes up to 40 000 deaths per year. MIDGE vectors are small linear double-stranded DNA molecules. they contain sequences required for their function in vivo. 17 MIDGE-Th1 vectors are MIDGE vectors with a short peptide (PKKKRKVEDPYC) covalently attached. leISHDNAVAX is systemically distributed after intradermal injection of a 120 g dose. total DNA was extracted from tissue samples taken 24 h post injection. vector copy numbers per g total DNA ranged from 4.04 103 to 2.55 109. vector DNA was quantified in total DNA extracted from tissue samples 24 h after the last injection. distribution patterns and amounts of vector DNA were comparable 24 h after single and repeated injection. MIDGE-Th1 vectors persist at injection site and in draining lymph nodes Persistence of MIDGE-Th1 vectors was examined 14 days and 60 days post treatment. weight, food and drinking water consumption, ophthalmological and auditory examinations, urinalysis, organ weights and the neurological screening. no local intolerance reactions were noted after single or repeated vaccine dosing. a dose-dependent increase of LEISHDNAVAX-specific IgG levels was observed. group of 10 BALB/c mice (5 male, 5 female) were immunized i.d. at the tail base five times in weekly intervals with either PBS or LEISHDNAVAX. vani followed the known kinetic23 with distinct organ-specific growth patterns. vani followed the known kinetic23 with distinct organ-specific growth patterns in livers and spleens of infected mice. no significant differences were found in levels of creatinine in C57BL/6 mice. but neither the time point nor the direction of difference were consistent between experiments (Table 2).

MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA was not cleared from skin and inguinal lymph nodes within 60 days after four injections. this is in line with reports on i.d.-administered plasmid DNA vaccines. this short time to overall clearance was probably related to wider dispersion of DNA upon multiple jet injection, the lower DNA concentration, and the rapid entry into the blood circuit. the rats received up to 0.6 g LEISHDNAVAX DNA per gram body weight, thus a lower relative DNA dose than that administered to mice. the risk related to potential integration of MIDGE-Th1 vectors into host genomic DNA can be considered as low. in a repeated-dose toxicity study in naive mice, we tested three ascending doses of LEISHDNAVAX. we evaluated the tolerability of LEISHDNAVAX in two different mouse strains. the kinetic of infection corresponded to the well-documented pattern in mice with a rapid increase in hepatic parasite burden. the kinetic of infection corresponded to the well-documented pattern in mice with a rapid increase in parasite numbers and clearance. MIDGE-Th1 vectors were synthesized in a simple and standardized procedure. leISHDNAVAX was prepared at concentrations of 0.4, 2.0 and 4.0 mg ml1 of total DNA in PBS. the vaccine was filled as ready-to-use solutions in injection vials. animals were anesthetized deeply by isoflurane inhalation and blood was collected from the plexus ophthalmicus. total DNA was extracted from 20 mg tissue or up to 280 l blood. limit of detection and lower limit of quantification of the assay were determined at 525 copies of MIDGE-Th1 vector per reaction (that is, 2625 copies per g total DNA) all samples of extracted DNA were measured in triplicates. each animal received a dose of 10, 50 or 100 g LEISHDNAVAX or the placebo. they were killed 24 h post injection for evaluation of acute toxic reactions. animals were killed after a recovery period of 24 h, 14 days or 61 days. blood was taken for clinical biochemistry (albumin, globulin, bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, glucose, protein, urea, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, -amylase, -amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, -glutamyl-transferase, lactate dehydr the immunologically relevant organs thymus, spleen and lymph nodes were examined histologically. tissue samples were fixed in 7% buffered formalin (eyes in Davidson's solution), embedded in paraffin, sections prepared and routinely stained with haematoxylin-eosin. antigen mix was assembled at LPT. plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C, then washed three times with wash buffer. plates were then blocked with assay diluent for 1 h at room temperature. dsDNA tracer incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. radioactivity was counted using a gamma counter. dsDNA binding capacity was calculated according to a standard curve. the first dose was administered 7 days after infection and repeat doses in 7-day intervals. groups of mice were killed 29 days after receiving the last of a total of three doses of LEISHDNAVAX or PBS. t-test for numerical functional tests (P0.01), multiple t-test for body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry and organ weights (P0.01) and Fisher's exact test for histology (P0.05) parameters of the Irwin test were analyzed by Mann\u2013Whitney U-test (P0.05) and normality of body weight data by Shapiro\u2013Wilks test. leISHDNAVAX was prepared at concentrations of 0.4, 2.0 and 4.0 mg ml1 of total DNA in PBS in a controlled process. the vaccine was filled as ready-to-use solutions in injection vials. the experimental design was reviewed and approved by the local government. plexus ophthalmicus was hetized deeply by isoflurane inhalation. blood, thigh bone marrow, brain, heart, kidneys, liver (Lobus quadratus), lymph nodes, lung, thigh muscle, ovaries, skin of injection site, spleen and testes. limit of detection and lower limit of quantification of the assay were determined at 525 copies of MIDGE-Th1 vector per reaction.
