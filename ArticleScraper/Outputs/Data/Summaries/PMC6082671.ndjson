{"summary": "mice were injected by intramuscular-electroporation with GP DNA vaccines. the spleen cells were used for producing GP-specific hybridoma. the purified IgG antibodies from 5 clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) possess GP-binding activity but not Ebola virus-neutralizing activity. EVD is generally considered as an endemic disease in Africa. spread can be broadened through travel to all parts of the world. despite severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use. despite the severity of Ebola virus infection, there are currently neither preventive vaccines nor therapeutic drugs readily available for use. antibodies showed binding activity to native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface or the mucin-like region of GP, but not the denatured form of GP. none of the antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection in vitro, suggesting that these IgG antibodies are unable to block Ebola virus infection. derived GP1 proteins (GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d, and GP1e) were previously produced and tested. mice were injected intramuscularly with 50 g of pcDNA3-GP per mouse. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 20 g of GP per mouse. the cells were fused with 2107 Sp2/0-Ag14 cells using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000) the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 days in cDMEM containing hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HT) after 15 days, the cell supernatants were screened for Ab-secreting hybridomas using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) each well of a 96 well plate was coated with recombinant GP and GP1 proteins (0.5 g/mL in PBS) the next day the plate was washed 3 times with washing buffer and then blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer. after washing the plate, an ABTS solution (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was added. membrane was pre-equilibrated with TBST solution (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for detection of antibodies, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) for 1 hour at room temperature. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) and anti-mouse IgG (Fc) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Abcam. the cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. HEK293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, were purchased from Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) the cells were maintained in cDMEM media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) pcDNA3-GP encodes GP of Zaire Ebola virus strain Gabon-94. injections followed by EP at 0.2 volts for 4 seconds using Cellectra. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 20 g of GP per mouse. mice were also injected intravenously with 20 g of recombinant GP per mouse. the protein G resin column was pre-equilibrated with 10 mL binding buffer. the mixed samples were filtered through a 0.2 m filter and mixed with an equal volume of binding buffer. the bound antibodies were eluted by adding elution buffer. Optical density (OD) was read at 405 nm using an ELISA reader. HRP-conjugated anti-murine IgG1a, IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies were substituted for HRP-conjugated anti-murine IgG (H+L) Flow cytometry HEK293-GP or HEK293 cells (5105) were reacted at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes with 2 L of sera or 1 g of the purified IgG antibodies in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer. in each step, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer. an equal volume of Ebola virus Makona (GenBank No. KJ660348.2) was added to each well. the mixture was incubated for 1 hour and then 100 L of the virus-antibody mixture was added to each well. plates were read for cytopathic effect 13-day post-infection. mice were immunized by IM-EP with pcDNA3-GP at 0 and 4 weeks and then bled at 6 weeks. the immune sera reacted with HEK293-GP cells, but not with HEK293 cells (without GP expression) by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Fc) as the secondary Ab. this result shows that GP DNA vaccines can indeed induce IgG mice were bled at 2 weeks following the final injection. the sera were reacted with 5105 HEK293-GP and control HEK293 cells. mice were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. 7 monoclonal clones were obtained and designated C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, E12-10, E49-3, and E140-2. however, we were unable to generate any clones secreting GP-specific IgG antibodies for clones E2, E8, E22, E31 and E60. IgG antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D34-2, and E140-2 failed to react with any of the GP1 proteins. this result suggests that the IgG antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D34-2, and E140-2 may recognize either the tertiary structure of GP. ND ND E140-2 IgG1, no binding to 5 GP1s + 1.593 5 GP1s indicate GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d and GP1e. indicates positive reactivity; indicates no reactivity. GP, glycoprotein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 5 purified IgG antibodies were coated and reacted with HEK293-GP cells. 1 g of the purified IgG antibodies from clones showed positive reactivity to HEK293-GP cells but not to HEK293 cells. 5105 HEK293-GP and HEK293 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Fc) for flow cytometry. none of the 5 purified monoclonal IgG antibodies recognized the denatured forms of GP. commercial antibodies as a control recognized the denatured forms of GP. none of the 5 IgG antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection. a control antibody (2G4) neutralized Ebola virus even at the concentration of 3.125 g/mL. this result suggests that the 5 monoclonal IgG antibodies are unable to neutralize Ebola virus infection. GP DNA immunization and serum reactivity to a native GP antigen. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-GP and then selected against G418. cells from the six G418-selected cell colonies were reacted with GP-specific immune sera. 93 cells with pcDNA3-GP were stably transfected with pcDNA3-GP. the cells were reacted with 2 L of GP-specific immune sera, followed by reaction with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (whole molecules) for flow cytometry. mice were injected by IM-EP with pcDNA3-GP (50 g/mouse) at 0, 4, and 12 weeks, followed by intraperitoneal injection at 20 weeks with recombinant GP (20 g/mouse) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. the mice were sacrificed 3 days after the final injection and the splenocytes were used for fusion. IgG antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2 were purified using the protein G column. they resolved into 2 protein bands (50-kDa H chains and 25-kDa L chains) on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. they also reacted with Ebola virus GP, but not with SFTS virus GP. 11-3, D34-2, and E140-2 may recognize either the tertiary structure of GP or the GP regions excluding the receptor-binding domain and mucin-like region. the binding properties of the purified IgG antibodies from clone D12-1 may recognize the mucin-like region of GP. the resulting monoclonal hybridoma clones were designated C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2. the resulting monoclonal hybridoma clones were designated C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2. 1 g of the purified IgG antibodies from 5 clones showed positive reactivity to HEK293-GP cells. the antibodies from clones C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 showed no reactivity to HEK293-GP cells. this result suggests that the IgG antibodies from clones D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 may recognize the native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface. none of the IgG antibodies recognized the denatured forms of GP. commercial antibodies as a control recognized the denatured forms of GP. this result suggests that the five purified IgG antibodies are unable to recognize the denatured forms of GP. negative control C36-1 D11-3 D12-1 D34-2 E140-2 Positive control (2G4) Cells alone 100 g/mL + + 50 g/mL + + 25 g/mL + + 12.5 g/mL + + 6.25 g/mL + + 3.125 g/mL + + 1.5623 g/mL + + 3.125 g/mL + + 1.5623 g/mL + + 3.125 g/mL + DNA vaccines coding for cell membrane-associated antigens were reported to be more effective at inducing Ag-specific immune responses. these data including ours suggest that DNA vaccines encoding any viral surface membrane proteins can induce IgG responses to the native and outer-membrane forms of the viral proteins. this is possible that these antibodies may be used to target viral surface antigens as either diagnostic or neutralizing antibodies. IgG antibodies from 3 clones (D11-3, D12-1 and E140-2) recognized GP expressed on the cell surface of HEK293-GP, suggesting that they may recognize the native and outer-membrane forms of GP. none of the five purified IgG antibodies recognized the denatured forms of GP by Western blot assay (data not included) clones E12-10 and E49-3, displaying the highest OD values, were secreted as an IgM producer. this notion is supported by our observation that the cell supernatants from two hybridomas (E12 and E49) exhibited high binding activity to all five different recombinant GP1s (suggestive of antigen-non-specific binding) in an ELISA. clones E12-10 and E49-3 are indeed from polyclon five purified GP-specific IgG antibodies were unable to block Ebola virus infection to the host cell in vitro. these data suggest that the five purified GP-specific IgG antibodies do not have any neutralizing activity toward Ebola virus infection."}
