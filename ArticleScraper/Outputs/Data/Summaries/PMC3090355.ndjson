{"summary": "zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. zoonotic viruses can be categorized according to genotype. zoonotic and non-zoonotic RNA viruses exploit host proteins for viral reproduction. hepatitis C virus uses CD81 as a receptor and LDLR as a co-receptor. hepatitis C virus uses CD81 as a receptor and LDLR as a co-receptor. the receptors and viruses examined in this study are listed in Table 1. we excluded all viruses known to utilize co-receptors. only interactions occurring through virus tropism and pathogenesis were considered. musculus# Rattus norvegicus 0.952 0.983 0.963 1 Mus musculus# Homo sapiens 0.896 0.927 0.903 1 Rabies virus (AChR) canis lupus familiaris# Bos Taurus 0.280 0.373 0.366 2 Bos Taurus Homo sapiens 0.267 0.371 0.416 2 Enterovirus (CD55) primary reservoirs designated as #. Abbreviation; NANA-synthase: N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Sialic acid) synthase, HIV: Cluster of differentiation 4, FMDV: Foot-and-Mouth disease virus, ACE2: Amgoptemsom-Converting Enzyme 2, AChR: Acetylcholine receptor, CD55: Decay-accelerating factor, TGE virus. the similarity scores for the infected group (g = 1) were high, ranging from 0.790 to 0.988 for 1Si,1 from 0.841 to 0.996 for 1Si,2, and 0.794 to 0.962 for 1Si,3. the similarity scores were comparatively low in the non-infection group (g = 2). similarity scores for rabies virus were low between canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) and bos Taurus (domestic cow) but were low between C. l. familiaris and H. sapiens. transmission of disease to H. sapiens is possible only because of the high human/dog receptor similarity. gSi,1, gSi,2, gSi,3 are plotted in two dimensional space. groups 1, 2 and 3 are each well separated. the results show clearly that the receptor sequences from cases of cross-species infection are well distinguished from those of other infection cases. in Table 2, the hydrophilic similarity scores (S1) show less consistency, comparing to the hydrophobic scores (S2), with the predictive values (G) the likelihood of viral infection correlates with the similarity in sequence of the primary and host receptors. the complex processes of host tropism of viruses are ignored in our current method. this simple conceptual approach may be useful even now as a basic tool for the classification of zoonosis of new viral species. both alignment tools produced the same reliable results as Clustal X. from the result, we counted the numbers of matched amino acids and calculated three kinds of sequence similarity scores. the total sequence similarity scores were defined as: and where Ntot is the total number of matched amino acids in one sequence string; ntot is the total number of matched amino acids in the sequence; nothers is the number of deleted amino acids (gaps/insertions in sequence) plus the number of the matrix for group 1 is defined as: 2S and 3S were defined as: and all of the related variables were tabulated as shown in Table 1. from the above matrices, three averages were found for each group. we then created a pool-within-class covariance matrix P. ten RNA viruses (seven zoonotic viruses and three non-zoonotic viruses) were investigated. Viruses with unknown or poorly defined host receptors (particularly human receptors) were excluded from the study. group 1 (g = 1) represents infection; group 2 (g = 2) represents non-infection; and group 3 (g = 3) represents near-infection. by definition, if a group 1 species pair includes humans, then the infection is zoonotic. decisions for grouping were made on the basis of experimental and epidemiological studies reported in the literature [4,30-33] groups in our study predicted the likelihood of infection for a virus of unknown infection condition by calculating the Mahalanobis distance (generally D2 = d1 C-1 Di) group classification (G) was identified using the criterion: if D12 is the minimum among three values, then G = 1; i.e., \"group 1\" is the group classification."}
