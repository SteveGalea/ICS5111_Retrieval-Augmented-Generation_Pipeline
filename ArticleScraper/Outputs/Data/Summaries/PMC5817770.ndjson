{"summary": "mortality from TB in 2015 reached 1.8 million, making it one of the top ten causes of death worldwide. international travel, mass gathering events, and migration facilitate the spread of TB. the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is particularly relevant because of its hosting of the Hajj. the study was a prospective cross-sectional design study conducted in mecca, KSA, over a 2-week period from September 14 to 29, 2015 (1\u201315 Dhul Hijja 1436H in the Islamic calendar) the study enrolled 1,164 consenting nonhospitalized adult pilgrims who had cough and could voluntarily produce sputum samples. all sputum samples were processed after Hajj at the Saudi National TB Laboratory (Riyadh, KSA) using the WHO-endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the rapid diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB. rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB); rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB); rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB); rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB); RR-TB = multidrug-resistant TB. the study enrolled 1,164 pilgrims originating from five TB-endemic countries in Africa and South Asia. the mean age of pilgrims was 54.5 (SD = 12.1 years, range = 18\u201394 years) with a male to female ratio of 2.6:1. 14 1.2 Refugee camp worker 7 0.6 Prison staff 7 0.6 None of the above 1,066 94.3 Underlying health conditions 1,069 \u2013 Yes 296 27.7 No 773 72.3 Pregnancy 1,036 \u2013 Yes 1 0.01 No 1,035 99.9 Tobacco smoker (currently or in the past) 1,145 \u2013 Yes 183 16.2 No 946 83.8 Recently (past month) lived in a household with an adult with a cough 1,145 \u2013 Yes no pilgrim declared that they were receiving TB treatment at the time of enrolment. 31 (2.8%) revealed that they had been treated for TB in the past. majority of those previously treated for TB originated from Bangladesh. univariate analysis shows a statistically significant association between TB and demographic variables (P = 0.01). Pilgrims with no formal education were over six times more likely to be TB positive compared with those with some form of education (primary, secondary, or higher education) the prevalence of active TB was lowest among the youngest age group (47 year old) the association was not statistically significant for any of these factors. TB prevalence was higher among females, pilgrims residing in south Asia, those with underlying health conditions, and those who traveled outside their current country of residency in the previous year. DISCUSSION Pilgrims attending Hajj maybe at a risk of acquiring TB infection. 1.4% of hajj pilgrims with cough from TB-endemic countries had undiagnosed active TB. prevalence of cough among Hajj pilgrims is 80%. most (80%) TB cases detected in the study were in pilgrims from Afghanistan and none were from south africa. this is surprising given that among the countries included in the study, Afghanistan has the lowest TB burden and South African has nearly 4.5 times its TB incidence rate. TB is associated with socioeconomic status of which education is one indicator. individuals with low socioeconomic status have higher TB risk and prevalence, are less likely to seek medical care, have longer diagnosis delay time, and are at higher risk of death from TB. we found that pilgrims aged over 64 years were 5.3 times more likely to be TB positive than those aged 47 years old or less. this is significant given that elderly pilgrims represent a sizable proportion of the Hajj population (roughly 25% are at least 65 years old) smoking is significantly associated with increased risks of TB infection and disease, TB transmission, TB mortality, and recurrent TB. the introduction of such screening programs for Hajj pilgrims will require further research and considerations into the target countries as well as to the practicalities, benefits, and cost of such undertakings. the development and deployment of new molecular TB diagnostic technologies, which could be subsidized in low-income countries, would be most beneficial. j is an important priority and will go a long way toward achieving the WHO\u2019s End-TB strategy goals."}
