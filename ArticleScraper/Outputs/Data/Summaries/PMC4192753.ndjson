{"summary": "negative regulatory mechanisms down-modulate in vivo platelet-collagen interactions. major regulators include nitric oxide and prostacyclin,1 expressed by the endothelium. the latter group includes platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule\u20131 (PECAM-1) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule\u20131 (CEACAM1). low-avidity ligand interactions may influence regulation of inhibitory signaling by phosphatases. Conversely, higher-avidity ligand cross-linkages may activate ITAM-mediated signaling responses. in murine platelets, there are 2 hemi ITAM\u2013associated signaling pathways. CEACAM1 and CEACAM2 proteins encoded by different genes containing 9 exons each. they share a similar overall structure in particular with respect to Ig-Domains in the extracellular segment and an almost identical ITIM-containing cytoplasmic tail. however, the 2 proteins differ by 2 important features. rabbit anti-mouse CEACAM2 polyclonal antibody (2052)16 and CEACAM1 antibody (2457)13,24 were previously described. anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and rabbit anti-mouse phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from Dako (Botany, Australia) sc-929), ERK-2, and GAPDH-(sc-32233) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX) mice were purchased from animal resources centre animal facility (Perth, WA) age- and sex-matched wild-type and Cc2/ littermates were housed at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) university animal facility. 10 000 individual platelets were analyzed on a flow cytometer and by weasel software. a time course of static platelet adhesion was performed for wild-type and Cc2/ platelets as previously described. thrombus volume was calculated from the thrombus area (m2) multiplied by the thrombus height (m) for wild-type and Cc2/ at various time points. statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student t test and 2-way analysis of variance. anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA) Rabbit anti-Akt-(#9272), anti-phospho-Akt-(S473, #4060), anti-phospho-Src-(Tyr416), and anti-Src-(36D10) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) ion responses were measured on a 4-channel light transmission aggregometer. surface and expression of CEACAM2 in wild-type and Cc2/ platelets were performed using washed platelets. for total expression, platelets were resuspended in 0.1% (weight/volume [wt/vol]) saponin as previously described13,36 and rabbit anti-mouse CEACAM2 antibody 2052 (1/100) whole blood from wild-type and Cc2/ mice was normalized to 3 108/mL platelets. labeled whole blood was perfused through the collagen-coated -slide-III0.1. nonadherent cells were removed by the flow of Ringer-citrate-dextrose buffer (pH 7.4) at the same shear wall flow rate. hematologic parameters for wild-type and Cc2/ mice were analyzed from wild-type and Cc2/ whole blood. hematologic parameter Wild-type (n = 6) Cc2/ (n = 6). the assays were run in triplicate. the data shown are representative of 6 independent experiments. we investigated the cellular compartmentalization of CEACAM2 in resting platelets. CC2-2L contains 2 Ig-Domains (N terminal, A2 domain), a transmembrane domain, and long ITIM-containing cytoplasmic domain. cell-surface expression of CEACAM2 was increased in a dose-responsive manner upon agonist stimulation with thrombin, protease-activated receptor-4 agonist peptide (PAR-4) and collagen-related peptide (CRP) compared with resting platelets. platelets were resuspended in 0.1% (wt/vol) saponin and washed with a combination of 0.2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin. results are cumulative data derived from 4 independent experiments. anti-murine PECAM-1 antibody, polyclonal anti-murine CEACAM1 2457 antibody, or polyclonal anti-murine CEACAM2 2052 antibody followed by a secondary PE-conjugated anti-rat or anti-rabbit antibody. ive agonists Next, we examined whether CEACAM2 negatively regulates platelet response. wild-type and Cc2/ platelets were stimulated using a range of G-protein-coupled agonists. similar platelet aggregation profiles were observed in wild-type and Cc2/ platelets treated with PAR-4 agonist peptide, ADP and CI. count adjusted to 1 108/mL for wild-type and Cc2/ mice was determined after stimulation with the following agonists. a-c) PAR-4 agonist peptide (125-500 M); (d-f) ADP (2.5-10 M); (g-i) calcium ionophore (1.25-5 g/mL); (m-o) CRP (0.625-2.5 g/mL); and (p-r) Rhod (0.12-0. cc2/ platelets released more and dense granules at all doses of CRP and Rhod compared with wild-type platelets. they released similar and dense granules upon CRP stimulation compared with Cc1/ platelets. these results support the hypothesis that CEACAM2 acts as a negative regulator of GPVI and CLEC-2\u2013mediated platelet granule release. samples were analyzed on an FACS Canto II flow cytometer. results are representative of 3 independent experiments (*P.05, **P.01, ***P.001; n = 4). adhesion to immobilized type I collagen showed a hyperresponsive platelet adhesion compared with wild-type platelets. wild-type and Cc2/ platelets showed a higher level of platelet adhesion to type I fibrillar collagen than wild-type platelets. rc and Syk tyrosine phosphorylation was measured after CRP and Rhod stimulation for 0 to 90 seconds. rc-stimulated Cc2/ platelets showed a fivefold increase in PLC2 tyrosine phosphorylation (0.5230 0.014 vs 0.1340 0.004; ***P.001; n = 3; Figure 5Ba) compared with wild-type platelets. platelets show hyperphosphorylated proteins after GPVI and CLEC-2-selective agonists, CRP and Rhod, stimulation over time. platelets (3 108/mL) from wild-type and Cc2/ mice were stimulated with 10 g/mL of CRP at 37 \u00b0C for 3 minutes. western blotting was performed to measure tyrosine phosphorylation. the relative intensity of phosphotyrosine-phosphorylated PLC2, Src, and Syk was quantified by ImageJ software, version 1.46r. the data shown are a representative blot of similar results for 3 independent experiments. we sex-stratified the in vitro thrombus formation to investigate a potential sexual dimorphic effect. Cc2/ platelets showed increased thrombus volume in both male and female mice compared with wild-type platelets (*P.05; Figure 6C). thrombus volume (m3) over time was derived by multiplying thrombus area (m2) with thrombus height (m) for both wild-type and Cc2/ platelets.
