{"summary": "patients whose illnesses met clinical case definitions for influenza-like illness were identified by clinic staff at the time of examination. original clinical case definitions were modified to capture each patient who had a history of fever during the current illness but who was not febrile at the clinic visit. all NPA specimens were subjected to a panel of real-time reverse transcription\u2013PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for the following viruses. influenza A (separate primer/probe sets for influenza A [universal], pandemic [H1N1] 2009, seasonal subtype H1N1 and seasonal subtype H3N1 detection) (20); influenza B (CDC in-house assay [details available on request]); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV we reviewed passive disease surveillance data collected by the hospital in maela. this surveillance system captured data only on patients visiting the hospital. the number and incidence rate of clinically diagnosed upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were reported by month. a total of 324 patients were included in the surveillance. 19 were excluded from further analysis. no NPA specimen was received for 1 patient. seasonal influenza A activity spanned weeks 26\u201334 (June 28\u2013August 29) and peaked in week 31 (August 2\u20138; the virus was detected later, beginning on week 31 (August 3). activity subsequently remained steady, with a maximum of 8 cases detected in a single week (15% of all patients sampled in week 36). 205 (67%) patients met strict case definition for ILI or pneumonia. 100 (33%) met only expanded case definitions. at least 1 virus was detected in 175 (57%) patients. the median monthly incidence of URTI was 51.8/1,000 persons (range 30.8\u201366.1 persons) during May\u2013October 2009; incidence peaked in August. median monthly incidence was 36.1/1,000 persons (range 18.4\u201350.8 persons) for URTI and 22.4/1,000 persons (range 11.2\u201349.9 persons) for LRTI. in late august 2009, seasonal influenza A (H1N1) was the predominant circulating virus. during the subsequent 2 months, only cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected. surveillance did not capture mild infections that did not result in visits to the outpatient department. if this intervention had any effect on health-seeking behavior remains unclear. an influenza triage system was in operation at the hospital. not every patient eligible for sampling was included. most cases with this clinical syndrome were diagnosed as common cold. the monthly census in maela enabled generation of relatively accurate figures for this population. the virus may have been responsible for 7 pneumonia episodes per 1,000 population per month (32.4 cases 23%) in 2 rural Thai provinces during 2008, influenza virus infection was associated with 18.4% of hospitalized case-patients who had clinical pneumonia (minimum incidence of 134.4/100,000 population) camp administrators and donor agencies should consider routine vaccination for seasonal influenza in these populations. work such as this solidifies the need for inclusion of refugee populations in influenza vaccine strategies and pandemic planning."}
