{"summary": "Adaptive immunity plays a major role to provide long-term control of infection. but the very low frequency of circulating HBV-specific T cells in chronic infection contributes to the inability to clear the virus. cccDNA in hepatocytes is the main hurdle to eradicate HBV infection. tion caused by persistent exposure to high antigen concentrations provides the basis for T cell dysfunction. intensity of the T cell response appears inversely correlated with HBV DNA levels. antibodies specific for HBsAg are critical for the neutralization of free extracellular HBV, thus preventing viral entry into susceptible hepatocytes. the discovery of the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as the receptor used by HBV to bind and infect liver cells allowed identification of the preS1 sequence which is used by HBV to bind and infect liver cells. the potency and efficiency of anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies in controlling HBV also comes from early evidence showing that hepatitis B vaccines may be efficacious even when given after exposure. bulk peripheral blood B cells express several activation markers and produce large amounts of immunoglobulin in response to innate and adaptive immunity signals. there was no upregulation of B-cell exhaustion markers, i.e., FcRL4, adding further support to the concept that the bulk B cell population apparently remains functionally intact in this setting. HBcAg-specific B cells have a classical phenotypic and transcriptome profile. HBsAg-specific B cells have an atypical memory B cell profile. this is one of the first reports of dichotomous B-cell differentiation according to antigenic specificity in viral infections. human memory B cells and plasma cells are a major source of antibodies. they undergo somatic mutations and selection by antigen and T-cell help in response to pathogens and persist for life as memory cells in a given individual. these terminally differentiated cells are certainly not ideal for long-term culture. anti-HBV humAbs were originally developed to obtain sustainable reagents for immunoprophylaxis of HBV re-infection in liver transplant recipients and other settings. they were originally developed to obtain sustainable reagents for immunoprophylaxis of HBV re-infection in liver transplant recipients. anti-HBs antibodies are usually administered as an additional prophylactic measure while waiting for the appearance of neutralizing anti-HBs antibodies. a human anti-HBs mAb was used in patients with chronic hepatitis B. monoclonal or polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies in HBsAg positive mice, chimpanzees and human subjects has so far not been convincingly demonstrated. a potentially dangerous effect of immune complex formation following intravenous injection of monoclonal or polyclonal anti-HBs antibodies in HBsAg positive mice, chimpanzees and human subjects. antiviral humAbs can be exploited to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which takes place via specific receptors recognizing the Fc fragment of IgGs. one of these, the low affinity FcRIII (CD16), is the most potent activating receptor of NK cells mediating ADCC (47). established HBV infection and efficiently mediated ADCC was abolished when these antibodies were engineered in the Fc to prevent binding to FcRs. findings suggest that humAbs targeting HBV envelope epitopes might indeed have a potential for combination therapies in chronically infected individuals."}
