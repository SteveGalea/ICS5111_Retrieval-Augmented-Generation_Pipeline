{"summary": "Ischemic stroke is a complex vascular and metabolic process resulting in neuronal death and progresses with time. Cytokines play a role in immune response and also maintains the normal homeostatic environment of the central nervous system. IFN- is one of the key effector cytokines produced by NK and T cells that enhance microbicidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils. patients with acute stroke were examined by a qualified stroke neurologist. ischemic strokes were differentiated by computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. patients with hemorrhagic stroke excluded from the study. at position +874A/T was studied using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction method (ARMS PCR) each reaction employed a generic antisense primer 5\u2019- TCAACAAAGCTGATACTCCA-3\u2019 and one of the two allele-specific sense primers 5\u2019-TTCTTACAACACAAAAAAATCA-3\u2019 for \u2018A\u2019 allele. study subjects included 171 ischemic stroke patients. ischemic strokes were differentiated by computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. the polymorphism in interferon gamma (IFN) was studied using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction method (ARMS PCR) each reaction employed a generic antisense primer 5\u2019- TCAACAAAGCTGATACTCCA-3\u2019 and one of the two allele-specific sense primers 5\u2019-TTCTTACAACAACACAAAAAATCT-3\u2019 for \u2018A\u2019 allele. amplification was performed with an initial denaturation statistical analysis The association between genotypes and stroke was examined by using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and chi square (2) analysis using EPI info 6 software (EPI info 6 CDC) all the statistical tests were two sided, and were considered significant at p value 0.05. 48 (28.1) 72(47.1) Age in years, mean (SD 54.22(10) 54.19(11) Hypertension 124(72.5) 67(43.7) Diabetes 53(30.9) 31(20.2) Smoking 87 (50.8) 61(39.8) Alcohol 68(39.7) 45(29.4) Family history of hypertension 52 (30.4) 30(20.2) Family history of s troke 49(28.6) 12(7.8) IFN- +87 IFN+874A/T Stroke Patients (n=171) Controls (n=153) OR 95%CI P-value No. % No. % Genotype AA 68 39.77 67 43.79 0.84 0.54-1.31 0.46 AT 65 38.01 66 43.14 0.80 0.51-1.26 0.34 TT 38 22.22 20 13.07 1.9 1.05-3.43 0.03 Allele A 201 58.78 200 65.36 0. allele frequencies in stroke were 58.78% and 41.22% as against 65.36% and 34.64% in control group. no statistically significant differences in the A and T allele frequencies between the two groups. a functional role of neutrophils in the development of stroke-associated injury remains controversial. the contribution of specific lymphocyte subpopulations and their products to the pathogenesis of stroke-associated injury remains controversial. the microvasculature of postischemic brain assumes an inflammatory phenotype that is manifested as endothelial activation and barrier dysfunction. aspiration due to dysphagia is a known risk factor for pneumonia after severe strokes."}
