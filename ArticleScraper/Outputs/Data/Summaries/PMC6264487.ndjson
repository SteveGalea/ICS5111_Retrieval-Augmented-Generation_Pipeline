{"summary": "some food and waterborne outbreaks have been traced to P. shigelloides [8\u201313] and the incidence of Plesiomonas infections linked to immunocompromised health is increasing. climate change and global warming are also predicted to contribute to increased incidence of waterborne infectious diseases including Plesiomonas infections [16\u201319] there have been a few recent reviews on P. shigelloides [2,14,48] but no comprehensive surveys have been conducted. bibliometric analyses have been applied to global disease research on viral agents such as dengue virus [49], Ebola virus [50], John Cunningham virus [51], Mayaro virus [52], Mayaro virus [51], Mayaro virus [52], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [53][34], yellow fever virus [54], west Nile virus bibliographic coupling occurs between articles i and j when reference lists cited at least one common source [62] in a collaboration network, the nodes comprise authors and the links co-authorships [63]. a network depicts relationships in a system as a set of nodes (components) and links (relationships) a title-specific search has been reported to increase recovery and specificity with a minimal loss of sensitivity compared to a topic search [44,45,66]. a title-specific search has been reported to increase recovery and specificity with a minimal loss of sensitivity compared to a topic search [44,45,66]. elloides, \"Aeromonas-shigelloides\" and \"Plesiomonas-shigelloides\" were allotted to \"Plesiomonas shigelloides\" all networks were standardized using the Simpson\u2019s coefficient (inclusion index), proximity index (association strength), and the Jaccard\u2019s similarity index among. k-means clustering was performed on keywords to evaluate concepts in Plesiomonas field of research using the function conceptualStructure of the package. the function implements Porter\u2019s stemming algorithm [67] to modulate inflected words to their root form. peer-reviewed articles on P. shigelloides were retrieved from the Web of Science database on august 19, 2018. All available information was retrieved. a title-specific search has been reported to increase recovery and specificity with a minimal loss of sensitivity compared to a topic search. authors' names were extracted twice as two sets (A and B) each set was checked for variant names, spelling errors and matched with affiliations. multiple occurrences of a keyword or a similar keyword in an article were regarded as one. all networks were standardized using the Simpson\u2019s coefficient (inclusion index), proximity index (association strength), the Jaccard\u2019s similarity index, and the Salton\u2019s cosine coefficient among nodes of a network. the function implements Porter\u2019s stemming algorithm [67] to modulate inflected words to their root form. published studies on P. shigelloides from 1990 to 2017 and average total citations of articles by year are shown in Fig 1. The annual growth rate was 0.8%, with an overall mean of 5.542.66. research output fluctuated during the study period, peaking in 2000 and 2006 (each accounting for 7.7% [12/155] of the total) the topmost active authors were affiliated with institutions in developed nations, including Sweden (n = 6), USA (n = 5), Japan (n = 3), Spain (n = 5), Poland (n = 3), Czech Republic (n = 1), and Slovak Republic (n = 1).

Tohoku Pharmaceutical University Japan 4 2.6 4 53 9 Ranking based on the number of articles; TC, total citations. the number of articles (n = 29, 18.7%) and citations (n = 451) varied among the top countries from 1.3 to 18.7%. Sweden had highest productivity (1.563 article/million population) when normalized for population size using mid-period population (2003). the top 20 journals with the most published articles on P. shigelloides are listed in S2 Table. these journals cover a range of subjects including carbohydrates, microbiology, food science, infectious disease, immunology, and biochemistry. keyword terms associated with identification methods of P. shigelloides included polymerase chain reaction (PCR, n = 8, 5.2%), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF, n = 6, 3.9%), and serotyping (n = 3, 1.9%). co-infection with Escherichia coli (n = 24, 15.5% (ID)) and Aeromonas species (n = 6, 3.9% (DE), n = 41, 26.5% (ID) was represented. Keywords linked to extraintestinal P. shigelloides infection included septicemia (n = 24, 15.5% (ID)), meningoencephalitis (n = 4, 2.6 (DE)), Sepsis (n = 3, 1.9% (DE)), and men the 33-element cluster explained the co-occurrence and co-infection of P. shigelloides with other bacteria. other indicators of frequently represented concepts and frameworks related to P. shigelloides included co-occurrence of terms and keywords. the top 20 authors\u2019 collaboration and coupling networks on P. shigelloides studies were divided into two mega-clusters or spheres with nodes occupied solely by researchers from high-income countries. each node in the network represents a different author\u2019s collaboration with other authors. Fig 4 shows 50 countries\u2019 collaboration networks on P. shigelloides studies. collaboration pathways ranged from 1 to 9. other countries had no collaboration networks. ka and Chikungunya viruses have driven the generation of new scientific knowledge, resulting in a significant increase in the number of research articles on these subjects. most of the leading authors in the Plesiomonas research field were from developed nations such as the united states, Sweden, Austria, Japan, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic. the shift in rank among the top 20 nations most active in the Plesiomonas research field should not be regarded as a precise measure of productivity. the lower the number of articles used for estimation, the larger the impact of a few frequently cited articles [76] the most frequently mentioned keywords and research areas associated with Plesiomonas studies reflect the research hotspot during the survey period. a bibliometric survey complemented with a narrative review or meta-analysis may be beneficial in Plesiomonas research. future research is needed to answer questions related to what strain of the microorganisms are pathogenic and how to differentiate pathogenic variants from non-pathogenic ones. alliances between developing and developed countries are rare in a number of scientific areas. this is the first bibliometric study on Plesiomonas-related research contributing to the evidence base and would help direct future research. bibliometric analysis revealed a global diminishing research in Plesiomonas, greater research output from high-income countries compared to low- and middle-income countries. the detailed search Boolean for articles identification from WoS.
