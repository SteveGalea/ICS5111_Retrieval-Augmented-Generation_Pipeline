{"summary": "a cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in new Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained. survival times were estimated using Kaplan\u2013Meier methods. cats that are aggressive, sexually intact, frequently in contact with other cats or observed fighting have been identified as significantly more likely to test positive for either pathogen. almost 100% of newborn kittens developing persistent viraemia after inoculation vs only 15% of kittens over 4 months of age. a cross-sectional survey was emailed to the 423 registered veterinary practices in new Zealand on 25 May 2016 to collect quantitative data on in-house testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV performed during the 2015 calendar year. veterinarians were asked to provide their opinions on the safety, efficacy and cost of FeLV vaccines using Likert-scale ratings and free-text comment fields. test results were excluded leaving 572 cats in the final study sample. basic descriptive data, including the name, client code, date of birth, date of testing, breed, sex, neutering status and postcode, were downloaded from the electronic records. cat breed was categorised into two groups: \u2018domestic\u2019 (including domestic shorthair, domestic mediumhair and domestic longhair breeds) and \u2018purebred\u2019 (including all other defined breeds) records from subsequent visits were then examined to determine if follow-up testing was performed to confirm the positive FeLV results. for cats that were euthanased or known to have died, the date of death was recorded. for cats that were known to have died, the date of death was recorded. the log-rank test was used to compare difference in survival times between FIV-positive and FeLV-negative cats. all statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software. a cross-sectional survey was emailed to the 423 registered veterinary practices in new Zealand on 25 May 2016. the free-text field of the clinical records was then manually reviewed to collect data on the date of initial testing. data were categorised into binary variables describing the presence or absence of lethargy, anorexia, chronic diarrhoea (based on the subjective reports of the owner), weight loss (if this was recorded as a presenting complaint or the patient lost 10% of its body weight since the last recorded visit), pyrexia (if the body temperature was >39.3\u00b0C), an Statistical analysis The prevalence of positive FeLV and FIV test results was estimated at both the practice level and national level by taking the total number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests performed. separate logistic regression models were then constructed for FeLV and FIV to identify risk factors associated with test positivity. an estimated 2125 in-house tests were performed in a patient population of approximately 120,000 cats. the overall prevalence of FIV-positive tests was 18.5%. most veterinary practices never (70/112; 62.5%) or rarely (29/112 or 25.9%) vaccinated against FeLV. 6 survey respondents did not provide answers to these questions. 29 (5.1%) were positive for FeLV antigen only, 91 (15.9%) were positive for FIV antibody only and 12 (2.1%) were positive for both diseases. ency virus (FIV) using a commercially available point-of-care ELISA kit at a first-opinion veterinary practice in new Zealand between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016. all cats n (%) P value* n (%) P value* Age (years) 1 52 2 (3.8) \u2013 1 (1.9) \u2013 1\u20135 210 16 (7.6) 0.349 21 (10) 0.094 5\u201310 154 16 (10.3) 0.172 41 (26.6) (0) 0.989 1 (16.7) 0.93 Pyrexia Absent 231 13 (5.6) \u2013 38 (16.5) \u2013 Present 72 16 (21.3) 0.001 16 (22.2) 0.266 Anaemia Absent 530 28 (5.3) \u2013 92 (17.4) \u2013 Present 33 13 (39.4) 0.001 10 (30.3) 0.066 Inflammatory oral disease Absent 496 34 (6.8) \u2013 84 (16.9) \u2013 Present 66 7 (10.6) 0.2 the most common clinical signs were lethargy (65.9%;
