{"summary": "Kimchi is a low-calorie food (18 kcal/100 g) and an important source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. it is also a good source of phytochemicals (e.g., -sitosterol, glucosinolates, isothiocyanate, indoles, allyl compounds) and probiotic strains. no published study has examined the effect of Kimchi consumption on blood immune parameters in a clinical trial setting. this study was designed to determine assessed immunomodulatory properties of Kimchi consumption in the Chinese healthy college student. subjects suffering from any kind of disease/disorder, have a history of medication in the past few months were excluded. the Kimchi-group consumed 100 g of Kimchi/day. the non-Kimchi group consumed 100 g of radish/day. the ingredients of Kimchi included 92.8 g cabbage preserved in salt. serum total immunoglobulins (Ig A, G, and M) were measured using nephelometry. pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) in serum were measured. subjects were randomly assigned into two groups, a Kimchi (n = 21, 100 g/day) or a non-Kimchi (n = 22, control) group. all eligible subjects were instructed to discontinue Kimchi during one week of washout period. blood sample was obtained in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid-potassium (EDTA-K2) anticoagulant tubes and serum-separate tubes (SST) the supernatant was immediately centrifuged (3,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 min) and the supernatant used for analysis. continuous variables of two groups were compared with the independent or paired t-test. data presented as mean SD. significance level was defined at p 0.05. all values were in the reference range, neutrophils (50-80%), eosinophils (50-80%), basophils (0-2%), monocytes (2-10%), and lymphocytes (25-50%). levels of Ig A and Ig G in the Kimchi group at baseline were significantly lower than the non-Kimchi group. significant differences were shown between the groups by independent t-test at p 0.05. Suppressor T cells were not different between two groups at baseline. levels of suppressor T-cells were significantly increased in the non-Kimchi group. the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, in the Kimchi and non-Kimchi groups were not significantly different. however, in the Kimchi group, the levels of IL-4 was significantly increased (from 0.7 0.7 to 3.9 5.7 pg/mL). levels of white blood cell subsets and immunoglobulins were not different between two groups at baseline and after 4 weeks. all values were in the reference range, neutrophils (50-80%), eosinophils (0-5%), basophils (0-2%), monocytes (2-10%), and lymphocytes (25-50%) [15]. NK cells at baseline and after four weeks in the Kimchi group were significantly lower than those in the non-Kimchi group (15.9 7.0% and 14.7 6.8%, respectively) these values were not significantly changed after four weeks of intervention in both experimental groups. no differences were shown between groups by independent t-test at p 0.05. the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, in Kimchi and non-Kimchi groups were not significantly different. but in the Kimchi group, the levels of IL-4 was significantly increased. red pepper contains high levels (25-80 mg%) of capsaicin. capsaicin is involved in physiological functions related to immune response. differences exist in immunomodulatory effects of different probiotic strains. low levels of Ig were observed in humoral immunodeficiency. lactobacillus plantarum isolated from Kimchi increased production of Ig A in normal or S180-bearing mouse [26,14] the decreased levels of TNF- and IL-6 in placebo group may be due to the use of radish."}
