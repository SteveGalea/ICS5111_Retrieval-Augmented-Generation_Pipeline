{"summary": "type III IFNs are a distinct class of antiviral cytokines and inducers of the expression of ISGs. the induction processes and mechanisms of action of type I IFNs and type III IFNs are similar (7\u20139) peroxisomal MAVS in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is particularly crucial for the IRF1-dependent activation of the type III IFN response (11) receptors for type I IFNs are seemingly ubiquitous, whereas receptors for type III IFNs are confined to the mucosal epithelium (9) the type III IFN response is limited mostly to epithelial cells due to the highly restricted expression of specific receptors. in the united states, PED was recognized for the first time in April 2013. in the following 8 months, it caused more than 8 million deaths of pigs. the causative agent is PED virus (PEDV), which is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus. the PEDV genome is 28 kb long and codes for two large polyproteins. RESULTS Establishment of porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ) susceptible to PEDV. vero cells are widely used for PEDV isolation and propagation. ST (swine testicle) and PK-15 (porcine kidney) cells also support PEDV replication. ous cells were first examined for their characteristics. cytokeratin is the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton protein of epithelial tissues. pancytokeratin monoclonal antibody staining showed the abundant expression of cytokeratins. LLC-PK1, IPEC-J2, and IPEC-DQ cells were grown on coverslips. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. the cells were then permeabilized with cold methanol for 15 min at 20\u00b0C. IPEC-DQ cells produced type III IFNs efficiently. a >1,700-fold increase in the level of IFN-3 was observed in IPEC-DQ cells compared to IFN-. this suggests that IPEC-DQ cells produced type III IFNs. IFN-1 and IFN-3 inhibited PEDV replication at comparable levels regardless of the different treatment conditions. both IFN-1 and IFN-3 inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner. MARC-145 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and treated with different amounts of IFN-1 or IFN-3 (10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, and 1,000 ng/ml) for 12 h. cells were then infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed, and replenished with fresh infection medium containing indicated IFNs. DV N mRNA transcript levels were obtained from three independent experiments. asterisks indicate statistical significance relative to the nontreatment group. we also showed that they inhibited PEDV infection. type III IFNs were still not inducible in LLC-PK1 cells. the levels of the respective mRNAs were also negligible. for examination of whether PEDV could induce the activation of type III IFN at any time of infection, cells were transfected with the IFN-1 luciferase reporter. MARC-145 cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected with p-551-(225/36)-Luc. the gene-transfected and PEDV-inoculated cells were then stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. total cellular RNA was prepared to determine type III IFN mRNA levels. poly(IC) stimulation caused the upregulation of IFN-1, IFN-3, and IFN-4 expressions in mock-infected cells. however, PEDV infection significantly downregulated their expressions. expression levels of individually cloned viral proteins were first examined by Western blotting. ural proteins representing nsp1 through nsp16. ural proteins were grown in 24-well plates and cotransfected with p-551-(225/36)-Luc and different PEDV genes along with pRL-TK. at 12 h posttransfection, cells were stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. nsp1 appears to be one of the most potent viral antagonists. luciferase activity decreased as the amounts of nsp1 increased. nsp1 is the most potent viral antagonist. mut.IRF-Luc, p-551mut.NF-B-Luc, and p-551mut.IRF/mut.NF-B-Luc contain binding-site mutations for IRF, NF-B, and both IRF and NF-B respectively. both IRF and NF-B are involved in PEDV-mediated IFN- suppression. 551mut.IRF/mut.NF-B-Luc for 6 h and infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 12 h. cells were then stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. cells were then stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. nsp8 and N did not inhibit IRF1 activity, suggesting that these two proteins may function through pathways other than the IRF1-mediated pathway. PEDV nsp1 suppressed the activities of the IFN-1 promoter mutants by suppressing both IRF1 and NF-B. the transfection of active molecules upregulated IFN-1 promoter activities. PEDV nsp1 also inhibited the IFN-1 promoter activated by IRF3. this suggests that IRF3-mediated type III IFN suppression might be a nuclear event. PEDV nsp1 degrades CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. IRF3-mediated type III IFN production also relies on enhanceosome formation. however, nsp1-mediated type III IFN production can be independent from enhanceosome assembly. nuclear localization signal (NLS) located immediately downstream of the DNA-binding domain. when stimulated, IRF1 is instantly activated and translocates to the nucleus. IPEC-DQ cells were infected with PEDV for 12 h and stimulated with poly(IC), followed by antibody staining for IRF1. in 12-well plates were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 5 and lysed at indicated times for detection of IRF1 and the PEDV N protein by Western blotting. IPEC-DQ cells were grown on coverslips and infected with PEDV for 12 h followed by stimulation with poly(IC) for 12 h. mitochondrial and peroxisomal MAVS pathways result in different but complementing responses. peroxisomal MAVS in intestinal epithelial cells preferentially triggers the IRF1-mediated expression of IFN- genes (11) differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells upregulates the biogenesis of peroxisomes and promotes a robust type III IFN response. the number of peroxisomes in PEDV-infected cells was compared to that in noninfected cells. nsp1 may be the protein that reduces the number of peroxisomes. the 37\u201351 deletion mutant was localized in the cytoplasm and reduced number of peroxisomes. perinuclear N93A/N95A mutant and other mutants, G38A/F39A, F44A, G87A, L98A/E99A/E100A, and 37\u201375, showed punctate patterns in the nucleus and did not interfere with the number of peroxisomes. nsp1-expressing cells were cotransfected with either p-551-(225/36)-Luc or IRF1-Luc with each mutant of nsp1. cells were then stimulated with poly(IC) and cell lysates were prepared to measure the luciferase activities. cells were cotransfected with individual nsp1 constructs along with p-551-(225/36)-Luc or pIRF1-Luc and then stimulated with poly(IC) for reporter assays. nsp1 and its mutants exhibited comparable expression levels. al cells (IPEC-DQ) are widely used for PEDV isolation and propagation (29, 30), and ST (swine testicle) and PK-15 (porcine kidney) cells also support PEDV replication (31). expression of cytokeratins in IPEC-DQ cells, as in LLC-PK1 and IPEC-J2 cells. the growth kinetics of IPEC-DQ cells was similar to that of IPEC-J2 cells, with a similar doubling time of approximately 53 h. we concluded that IPEC-DQ retained the porcine intestinal epithelial phenotype. IPEC-J2 and IPEC-DQ cells were infected with PEDV at MOIs of 5 and 1 respectively. cells were then fixed at 24 hpi with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with mouse anti-N MAb. FN-3 was observed in IPEC-DQ cells compared to IFN-. this suggests that IPEC-DQ cells produced type III IFNs efficiently. cells were primed for 12 h with either IFN-1 or IFN-3. the anti-PEDV activity of type III IFNs was examined under three different treatment conditions. cells were treated with IFN-1 or IFN-3 at 100 ng/ml 12 h before, at the time of, or after PEDV inoculation. culture supernatants were collected at 24 h postinfection for virus titration. the cells were coincubated with PEDV and IFN-1 or IFN-3 (100 ng/ml) for 1 h. the cells were then infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 1 h. cells were then inoculated with PEDV and IFN-1 or IFN-3 (100 ng/ml) for 1 h. type III IFNs play a critical role in maintaining the antiviral state of the epithelium in the gut. we also showed that they inhibited PEDV infection (Fig. 2). Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV might have evolved to modulate the type III IFN response of the host. type III IFN responses by PEDV were not limited to a particular cell type. cells were transfected with the IFN-1 luciferase reporter and inoculated with PEDV to determine virus regulation of IFN-1 activity. PEDV does not induce type III IFN production in intestinal epithelial cells. the gene-transfected and PEDV-inoculated cells were then stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. PEDV suppresses the induction of type III IFN mRNA as determined by RT-qPCR. cells were grown in 12-well plates for infection for 12 h. individual PEDV proteins were examined for IFN- suppression by reporter assays. all genes were expressed well, as anticipated. poly(IC) stimulation upregulated IFN-1 transcription in GST-expressing cells. cells were stimulated with poly(IC) (0.5 g/ml) for 12 h. at 12 h posttransfection, cells were stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. luciferase activity decreased as the amounts of nsp1 increased. nsp1 inhibited expressions of type III IFN by nsp1. nsp1 is the most potent viral antagonist. PEDV infection suppressed the luciferase activity of the mutants. both IRF and NF-B are involved in PEDV-mediated IFN- suppression. luciferase activity is mediated by IRF and NF-B interference. luciferase activity was measured in cells transfected with empty vector pXJ41. IRF1 activity was suppressed by nsp3, nsp5, nsp15, nsp16, ORF3, E, and M. of the total of 11 viral IFN- antagonists, nsp8 and N did not inhibit IRF1 activity. nsp1 was also examined for its ability to suppress IRF-mediated and NF-B-mediated IFN-1 responses. PEDV nsp1 suppressed IRF3-dependent type III IFN expression. nsp1 also inhibited the IFN-1 promoter activated by IRF3. this suggests that IRF3-mediated type III IFN suppression might be a nuclear event. IRF3-mediated type III IFN production also relies on enhanceosome formation. nsp1 inhibited RIG-I/MDA5-mediated IRF1 activation. overexpression of activated MAVS also upregulated IRF1 activity. IPEC-DQ cells were infected with PEDV for 12 h and stimulated with poly(IC), followed by antibody staining for IRF1. IRF1 in virus-infected cells remained in the cytoplasm even after poly(IC) stimulation. expression of IRF1 and its cellular distribution, however, were not altered in nsp1-expressing cells. IPEC-DQ cells were grown on coverslips and stimulated with poly(IC) for 12 h. cells were then fixed and stained with anti-N antibody and anti-IRF1 antibody. white arrows indicate IRF1 in the nucleus after stimulation in the absence of nsp1 expression. peroxisomal MAVS in intestinal epithelial cells preferentially triggers the IRF1-mediated expression of IFN- genes (11) differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells upregulates the biogenesis of peroxisomes and promotes a robust type III IFN response to invading pathogens. the number of peroxisomes in PEDV-infected cells was compared to that in noninfected cells. nsp1 may be the protein that reduces the number of peroxisomes. perinuclear N93A/N95A mutant and other mutants, G38A/F39A, F44A, G87A, L98A/E99A/E100A, and 37\u201375, showed punctate patterns in the nucleus. numbers of peroxisomes in nsp1- and mutant nsp1-expressing cells were quantified. HeLa cells were cotransfected with either p-551-(225/36)-Luc or IRF1-Luc. cells were then stimulated with poly(IC) and cell lysates were prepared to measure the luciferase activities. nsp1 and its mutants exhibited comparable expression levels. T68A, K70A, T68A/K70A, and L101A appeared to inhibit IFN-1 expression. 37\u201351 deletion mutant localized in the cytoplasm but retained IFN-1 suppression activity. peroxisomes are the signaling platforms for innate antiviral activity. peroxisomal MAVS triggers type III IFN production for rapid ISG expression independent of type I IFNs. PEDV is an enteric virus causing severe diarrhea in pigs. type III IFNs exert antiviral activity mainly in epithelial cells at the mucosal surfaces via the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. type III IFNs exert antiviral activity mainly in epithelial cells at the mucosal surfaces. type I and type III IFNs control reovirus infection. type III IFNs restrict infection in epithelial cells. type I IFNs exert antiviral activity on nonepithelial cells. Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) is a primate poxvirus that exclusively infects the skin. the secreted glycoprotein Y136 of YLDV binds to IFN-/ for the inhibition of IFNAR signaling and also binds to type III IFNs to inhibit the antiviral response. the induction of type III IFNs in IPEC-DQ cells is much more potent than that of type I IFNs. the induction of type III IFNs in IPEC-DQ cells is much more potent than that of type I IFNs. peroxisomes are the signaling platforms for IRF1-dependent IFN- production. the differentiation process of IECs upregulates the biogenesis of peroxisomes for the robust response of type III IFNs (11), which highlights the importance of type III IFNs for the innate antiviral state. peroxisomes are intracellular organelles that play a central role in regulating metabolic activities in mammalian cells. most RNA viruses replicate in cellular membrane organelles or rely on them for entry and assembly. influenza virus NS1 protein has been shown to bind to the peroxisomal enzyme 17--hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (57), which may alter peroxisome-specific lipid metabolism for viral replication. nsp1 is the first cleavage product of the pp1a and pp1a/b polyproteins. it is one of the most divergent viral proteins in four different genera. only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses code for nsp1. MERS-CoV nsp1 inhibits host gene expression by selectively targeting mRNAs transcribed in the nucleus for translation inhibition and mRNA degradation. nsp1 proteins in alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses lack overall sequence similarity. neither conserved motifs nor conserved domains are found in viruses of the Alphacoronavirus genus. p1 is a continuous line of epithelial cells derived from the jejunum of a 12-h-old, colostrum-unsuckled, mixed-breed pig. p1 has functions similar to those in other coronaviruses for shutting off host gene translation.
