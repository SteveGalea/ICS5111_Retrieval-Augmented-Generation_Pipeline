{"summary": "gout is a urate crystal deposition disease that occurs when supersaturation of individual tissues with urate arises, leading to the construction of monosodium urate crystals in and around the joints, abdomen, and organs. visceral gout can be caused by many factors, including vitamin A deficiency, high dietary calcium, renal insufficiency, chicken astrovirus (CAstV) and NIBV. NIBV replicates on the epithelial surface of the kidney and causes particle degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of the tubular epithelium. however, there is a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of NIBV infection. hepatitis C virus infection is associated with gut dysbiosis. a large-scale and comprehensive analysis of viral target tissues is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of the NIBV infection. we first replicated the visceral gout model by infecting chickens with NIBV and conducted an integrated transcriptomic, metabolomics, and microbiomics analyses. a large-scale and comprehensive analysis of viral target tissues is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of the infection. ten serum samples were randomly collected from surviving chickens in the Con and Dis groups before euthanasia that were used for uric acid test. four biological replicates of kidney samples were collected from each group giving a total of 12 samples that were used for RNA-seq analysis. methanol extraction, metabolite derivatization, metabolite detection, and data analysis followed those of Yang et al. [25]. GC\u2013TOF/MS analysis was performed using a gas chromatograph system. RNA preparation, library preparation, RNA-sequencing, and data analysis followed those of Yang et al. [26]. total RNA was extracted from each kidney sample individually using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) differential expression genes (DEGs) analysis was performed by using the DESeq R package (1.10.1) only those genes with a FC (fold change) 2 and FDR (false discovery rate) 0.01 were defined as DEGs. Sequencing libraries were generated using TrueSeq DNA PCR-free sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) based on their unique barcode, the paired-end reads were granted to samples. sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Novogene Company, Beijing, China) all birds were sacrificed using carbon dioxide euthanasia. all attempts were carried out to minimize the suffering of the animals. changes in the kidney of chickens infected with nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) the black asterisk shows the shedding of kidney tubular epithelial cells. the white asterisk shows the brush border that was lost in some segments of proximal tubules. GC\u2013TOF/MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph system coupled with a Pegasus HT time-of-flight mass spectrometer. the energy was \u201370 eV in electron impact mode. after 6.04 min of solvent delay, mass spectrometry data were acquired in full-scan mode with an m/z range of 50\u2013500 at a rate of 20 spectra per second. library preparation was performed as described by Li et al. [27]. a total amount of 1 g RNA per sample was used for the RNA sample preparations. index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. the target seven DEGs in response to NIBV infection were chosen for validation using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) the primer pairs for the selected genes were designed using Primer 5 and are shown in Table S1. 2.6. results 3.1. Clinical signs and pathology The chicks inoculated with strain SX9 showed obvious clinical signs from 3 to 9 \u201cday post-infection\u201d (dpi) the NIBV-infected chickens were listless, huddled together, and displayed ruffled feathers. the kidney parenchyma of the dead birds was pale, swollen, and mottled. the results indicate that the SX9 strain has strong renal tissue tropism. a total of 519 valid peaks were identified in the total ion current profiles. the points represent the scores of biological replicates. the abscissa t [1] P represents the predicted principal component score of the first principal component, the ordinate t [1] O represents the orthogonal principal component score. differential metabolites participated in six target pathways (p 0.05) including valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. metabolomics highlighted N-formyl-L-methionine as the most relevant metabolite alteration in NIBV-infected chickens. a total of 2868 genes were differentially expressed in the chicken\u2019s kidney with NIBV infection compared to Con group. 1521 genes were upregulated and 1347 genes were downregulated. the results showed that the general trends of the selected genes were consistent which proved the reliability of our RNA sequencing profiling. MDA5 recognizes a complementary set of cytosolic viral dsRNA ligands. NOD-like receptor signalling is activated by monosodium urate (MSU) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) the activation of TLRs and the ROS accumulation activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, pyruvate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid degradation were significantly regulated. in organismal systems pathways, intestinal immune network for IgA production and toll-like receptor signaling pathway were significantly regulated. the top 10 relative abundances of bacteria at the phylum (d), family (e) and genus (f) levels in cecal content samples from the Con and Dis groups. the difference in species analysis between the Con and Dis groups at the family (g) and genus (h) levels according to a t-test. differentially abundant phylum detected showed that Proteobacteria (LDA = 4.7644853231) phylum was most dominantly present in Dis group. at the species level, the microbiota of the Con group was enriched with Bacteroides (LDA = 4.80848153017) from the Bacteroidetes phylum. strong negative correlations were found between glutathione synthetase (GSS) and glutamine (R = 1, p = 0). most genes related to innate immune responses had strong positive correlations with differentially abundant metabolites. metabolites, including canavanine, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, 5,6-dihydrouracil, malonamide, thymine, phenylalanine, 1,3-diaminopropane, 4-acetamidobutyric acid, proline, threonine, isoleucine, valine, and oxalacetic acid, were negatively correlated with the presence of the phylum Prot histological examination revealed remarkable injuries in the kidney. results indicate that the SX9 strain has strong renal tissue tropism. a total of 519 valid peaks were identified in total ion current profiles. differential metabolites were the key to explaining the occurrence of gout in chickens under NIBV infection. a total of 160 metabolites displayed significantly different levels based on VIP > 1. two pathways with an impact factor > 0, including valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis (impact value = 0.43) and arginine and proline metabolism (impact value = 0.17) these pathways are related to amino acid metabolism and glycometabolism. metabolomics highlighted N-formyl-L-methionine as the most relevant metabolite alteration in NIBV-infected chickens. transcriptome analysis of chickens with NIBV infection showed that the general trends of the selected genes were consistent. the blue and red triangles represent the mean coordinates (center point) of the Dis and Con group, respectively. GO (http://www.geneontology.org) project was applied to explore potential biological functions of DEGs. the 20 most enriched GO terms classified by molecular function (MF), cellular components (CC) and biological processes (BP) terms were listed in Figure 3c. NIBV infection resulted in gut microbiota dysbiosis. NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling), ANOSIM (analysis of similarity) and PCA analysis (Figure 4c) confirmed the significant separation of the groups. the top 10 relative abundances of bacteria at the phylum (d), family (e) and genus (f) levels are shown and indicate significant variations of the microbial community. the top 10 microbes at the phylum (Figure 4d), family (Figure 4e), and genus (Figure 4f) levels are shown. biota of the Con group was enriched with Bacteroides (LDA = 4.80848153017) from the Bacteroidetes phylum and Lactobacillus (LDA = 4.22406025945) from the Firmicutes phylum. we filtered out five overlapping pathways in the transcriptome and metabolome pathway enrichment analysis. most genes related to innate immune responses had strong positive correlations with differentially abundant metabolites, such as amino acids and fatty acids. heat map of DEGs and metabolites involved in overlap pathway were shown in the grey box, respectively. obutyric acid, 5,6-dihydrouracil, malonamide, thymine, phenylalanine, 4-acetamidobutyric acid, proline, threonine, isoleucine, valine, and oxalacetic acid were positively correlated with the presence of the phylum Proteobacteria. a series of upregulated genes were noticed, including TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, NIBV infection also activated the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway. this induction may be due to MDA5 acting as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor to trigger an innate immune response against viral infection [43,44,45] catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), glutathione S-transferase kappa 1 (GSTK1), dehydrogenase/reductase member 4 (DHRS4), and epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2) are included. the mRNA was downregulated in the model group chicken kidneys. the lack of mRNA abundance of the gene GSS in the kidney tissue inhibited the conversion of glutamine to glutathione. a significant negative correlation between GSS and glutamine has confirmed this finding. differential expression of genes and differential abundance of metabolites in significantly enriched pathways have strongly positive correlations with DEGs related to innate immune responses. the correlation analysis highlighted a significant positive correlation between Tlr7 and proline, isoleucine, threonine, and valine. me incorporates a wide variety of commensal microbiota and has a large effect on the health of individuals. the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides vulgatus was significantly reduced in the cecal microbiota of NIBV-infected chickens. a decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus promotes intestinal flora imbalance and activation of the immune system. the abundance of Proteobacteria in this experiment may be closely related to the immune and metabolic changes caused by NIBV infection. NIBV significantly increased uric acid synthesis, inhibited the function of peroxisomes, and significantly elevated the pattern recognition receptor signalling pathways."}
