{"summary": "EV71 infection results in severe aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid paralysis, and pulmonary edema. chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 180 million people worldwide, and 350,000 people die each year due to HCV-related complications. anti-EV71 agents targeting viral proteases have generated a few successes. despite increasing amount of research aimed at identifying antiviral agents against EV71, no direct-acting anti-EV71 drugs are currently available. lycorine presents potent inhibitory activities against flaviviruses. lycorine inhibits EV71 in an animal model and lycorine-derived phenanthridine inhibits HCV. however, the inhibitory mechanisms of lycorine and lycorine derivatives against various viruses remain unclear. cDNA6-FY-capsid and pEV71-Luc-replicon lacking the P1 region were kindly supplied by W. Li from the National Institute of Biological Sciences, China. antibodies used for Western blot analysis were purchased from Abcam (mouse monoclonal antibody [MAb] to enterovirus 71 VP1; 10F0) and ProMab (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenas EV71-GFP virus was serially diluted 10-fold with DMEM containing 10% FBS (101- to 108-fold dilutions) and added to RD cells. plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. pcDNA6-FY-capsid plasmid was transfected into 293T cells at 60 to 80% confluence. after 24 h posttransfection, EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA was then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the stocks were serially diluted 10-fold and incubated with RD cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. cholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaVO4, 10 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors after 24 hpi. protein concentration in the lysates was determined with a spectrophotometer. cytotoxicity measured by cytotoxicity assay kit. 1.5 105 RD cells were seeded in each well of 24-well tissue culture plates. the medium was then replaced with medium containing EV71 Fuyang virus. total cellular RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent using a standard protocol. RD cells in another 96-well plate were treated with 2 M 1-acetyllycorine, 2 M NITD008, and 1 pM ALD. they were transfected with EV71(FY)-Luc replicon RNA after 4 h. RD cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured at 37\u00b0C. h, EV71 (strain Fuyang) was used to infect RD, Vero, and 293T cells at an MOI of 0.1 in complete medium. the initial high concentration of inhibitor, around 10-fold of the best EC50, ensured the quick emergence of resistant virus. after 3 days, the virus was harvested when RD cells reached 70 to 90% confluence. full-length RNAs of wild-type (WT) EV71 and F76L mutant virus were transcribed from recombinant plasmid linearized with XbaI in vitro.

RD cells were seeded at 3 104 cells per well onto 96-well microtiter plates. a different final concentration of 1-acetyllycorine was added to each row. a different final concentration of NITD008 was added to each column of the plate. differential surface plots at 95% confidence level (CI) were generated using MacSynergy II. peaks above or below a theoretical additive plane represent synergy or antagonism. data sets were interpreted using following scale. EV71 containing plasmids pcDNA6-FY-capsid and pEV71-Luc-replicon lacking the P1 region was supplied by W. Li from the National Institute of Biological Sciences, China. antibodies used for Western blot analysis were purchased from Abcam (mouse monoclonal antibody [MAb] to enterovirus 71 VP1; 10F0) and ProMab (glyceraldehyde the measurement was performed by seeding 3 104 RD cells per well in 96-well microtiter plates. after overnight culture, virus was serially diluted 10-fold with DMEM containing 10% FBS (101- to 108-fold dilutions) and added to RD cells. plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. pcDNA6-FY-capsid plasmid was transfected into 293T cells at 60 to 80% confluence. after 24 h posttransfection, EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA was then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the stocks were serially diluted 10-fold and incubated with RD cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaVO4, 10 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors after 24 hpi. proteins were separated by 5%-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) 1.5 105 RD cells were seeded in each well of 24-well tissue culture plates. the medium was replaced with medium containing EV71 Fuyang virus. total cellular RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent using a standard protocol. RD cells in another 96-well plate were treated with 2 M 1-acetyllycorine, 2 M NITD008, and 1 pM ALD. the cells were transfected with EV71(FY)-Luc replicon RNA after 4 h. EV71 (strain Fuyang) was used to infect RD, Vero, and 293T cells at an MOI of 0.1 in complete medium. the initial high concentration of inhibitor, around 10-fold of the best EC50, ensured the quick emergence of resistant virus. after 3 days, the virus was harvested when RD cells reached 70 to 90% confluence. full-length RNAs of wild-type (WT) EV71 and F76L mutant virus were transcribed from recombinant plasmid linearized with XbaI. RD cells were seeded in two 96-well plates and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. a humanized gene was introduced into the C terminus of the plasmid pJFH-1. the transcripts were prepared in vitro using the Ambion MEGAscript kit. after electroporation, Huh7.5.1 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm dish. RD cells were seeded at 3 104 cells per well onto 96-well microtiter plates. a different final concentration of 1-acetyllycorine was added to each row. a different final concentration of NITD008 was added to each column. differential surface plots were generated using MacSynergy II. peaks above or below a theoretical additive plane represent synergy or antagonism. the data sets were interpreted using following scale. RD cells were infected with EV71-GFP at an MOI of 1. DAPI was used to visualize the nuclear staining (top panel) in the host cells. 1-acetyllycorine inhibited EV71-GFP in a concentration-dependent manner. 1-acetyllycorine suppressed the propagation of multiple EV71 strains. enteroviruses from different genotypes share high conservation. RD cells were infected with three different strains, including strains BrCr, SK-EV006 and Fuyang. levels were measured using qRT-PCR at 24 hpi. RD, 293T, and Vero cells were incubated with 1-acetyllycorine for 24 h. the cell viability was measured using a WST-1-based assay. treatment with 1-acetyllycorine at 6 hpi to 10 hpi showed strongest antiviral effects. antiviral effect of ALD was dramatically decreased from 2 hpi. EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA lacking the P1 region was transfected into RD cells. drug resistance to 1-acetyllycorine was mapped to EV71 2Apro. EC50s of 1-acetyllycorine against the three resistant selections are 8.10, 6.22, and 7.98 M. EC50s of 1-acetyllycorine against EV71 WT and F76L viruses were measured in parallel using qRT-PCR. each point represents the average results from three independent experiments. a parallel comparison showed that 1-acetyllycorine inhibited WT EV71 with an EC50 of 0.77 M. mutation site in EV71 2Apro attenuates virus growth and facilitates escape from 1-acetyllycorine inhibition. compared with the high inhibition by 1-acetyllycorine of EV71, 1-acetyllycorine showed only minor attenuation of 2Apro activity. the aromatic side chain of F76 packs with a cluster of the hydrophobic core formed by the side chains of residues Y63, V74, M99, L114, V121, V132, and F134. the structure of EV71 2Apro and HCV NS3 protease was aligned and presented as cartoon diagrams in blue and gold. the zinc binding site in the HCV NS3 protease presents high structural homology with picornavirus 2Apro. the removal of the zinc ion affects the activities of both proteases. 1-acetyllycorine inhibits HCV through a conserved mechanism for inhibition of EV71. 1-acetyllycorine inhibited HCV replication through inhibition of molecular folding and thus the function of NS3 protease. 1-acetyllycorine reduced the fitness of HCV, which is similar to the effect of the F76L mutation in EV71. combination therapies with multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action have been demonstrated as effective approaches to treat virus infections (18). combination of 1-acetyllycorine and NITD008 showed a slightly increased effect over that of the theoretical additive effects. 1-acetyllycorine\u2013ALD had antiviral effects that were significantly more potent than the theoretical additive effects. no evidence of antiviral antagonism was observed with any of the tested doses. the combination of 1-acetyllycorine and sofosbuvir had synergistic antiviral effects compared with the theoretical model. the combination of 1-acetyllycorine and sofosbuvir presented clear antagonistic effects compared with the theoretical model. 1-acetyllycorine suppressed EV71 proliferation. RD cells were infected with EV71-GFP at an MOI of 1. concentration of 1-acetyllycorine was 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0 M. 1-acetyllycorine suppressed the propagation of multiple EV71 strains. enteroviruses from different genotypes share high conservation. we speculated that 1-acetyllycorine might exhibit inhibition on multiple EV71 strains. EV71 RNA levels were measured using qRT-PCR at 24 hpi. RD, 293T, and Vero cells were incubated with 1-acetyllycorine. the cell viability was measured using a WST-1-based assay. EV71 subgenomic replicon RNA lacking the P1 region was transfected into RD cells with or without treatment with 1-acetyllycorine, NITD008 (2 M) and ALD (1 pM) the results showed that 1-acetyllycorine inhibited EV71 replication similarly to. the EC50s of 1-acetyllycorine and NITD008 against EV71 replicon were further determined as 0.62 M and 0.21 M, respectively, but ALD did not present obvious inhibition. drug resistance to 1-acetyllycorine was mapped to EV71 2Apro. virus compared with the WT virus suggests that the fitness of the virus is inferior to that of the WT virus. a comparison showed that 1-acetyllycorine inhibited WT EV71 with an EC50 of 0.77 M but with a significantly increased EC50 of 7.4 M. NITD008 inhibited EV71 subgenomic replicon activities with EC50s of 0.21 M and 0.17 M, respectively. however, ALD did not show observable inhibition of WT or mutated replicon activities. we also examined the impact of F76L mutation on EV71 2Apro. the mutation site in EV71 2Apro, F76, confers resistance to 1-acetyllycorine, is located at the back side of the zinc finger region. the aromatic side chain of F76 packs with a cluster of the hydrophobic core formed by the side chains of residues Y63, V74, M99, L114, V121, V132, and F134, thereby stabilizing the conformation of the zinc finger. is the NS3 serine protease of hepatitis C virus, in which the zinc ion is also involved in maintenance of the structure. the overall structure of the core domain and the zinc binding site in the HCV NS3 protease presents high structural homology with picornavirus 2Apro. 1-acetyllycorine inhibited R118L-mutated HCV(JFH-1)-Rluc virus with an EC50 of 11.1 M, 5-fold over that of 1-acetyllycorine inhibition on WT HCV(JFH-1)-Rluc virus. this result supported the hypothesis that 1-acetyllycorine inhibited HCV replication through the inhibition of molecular folding. 1-acetyllycorine and NITD008 were treated with various concentrations of 1-acetyllycorine and NITD008 or 1-acetyllycorine and ALD, either alone or in combination. the results revealed that the combination of 1-acetyllycorine and NITD008 showed a slightly increased effect over that of the theoretical additive effects, suggesting that this combination was indeed synergistic. combination of 1-acetyllycorine and sofosbuvir and 1-acetyllycorine and RBV (D) on HCV were also documented. lycorine and sofosbuvir were treated either alone or in combination for 48 h. lycorine derivatives against EV71 and HCV restrained proliferation. mutations for drug resistance to 1-acetyllycorine on both EV71 and HCV are located at a conserved position in EV71 2Apro (F76) and HCV NS3 (R118) in vitro enzymatic assays, 1-acetyllycorine displayed only minor attenuations of EV71 2Apro against the substrate spanning the peptides in EV71 polypeptide. previous studies have revealed that lycorine blocks the protein synthesis either for eukaryotic cells or for virus. differences in the working mechanisms of lycorine derivatives for the inhibition of various flaviviruses were not surprising. lycorine-derived phenanthridine suppresses HCV proliferation via various mechanisms."}
