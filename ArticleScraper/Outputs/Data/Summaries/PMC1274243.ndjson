{"summary": "the main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by SARS patients. the main outcome measure was daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted and days from the most recent significant event discovery. the number of admissions and isolation beds required during management of SARS outbreaks can be expected to significantly exceed that used for actual SARS cases. the communicable disease centre (CDC) was the initial designated facility for the screening management of all SARS cases in Singapore from 22 Mar 2003. hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from Tan Tock Seng hospital for the period 14th March 2003 to 31st May 2003. the main outcome measure was daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted and days from the most recent significant event discovery. events 1\u20135 all involved probable SARS cases, while event 6 proved to be a false alarm[18]. the correlogram and partial correlogram graphs were used to help in deciding the order of moving average (MA) and auto-regressive (AR) terms to include in the model. before modeling the bed occupancy, we opted to set an a-prior value of 1 for starting the Kalman recursions[22]. the correlogram indicated that there was a significant autocorrelation out to about 3 lags. the only highly significant partial autocorrelation occurred at one lag. we found that the AR(1) coefficient of 1.02 and MA(3) coefficient of -0.95 were significant (p 0.05) we have also provided the model parameters and their corresponding MAPE values for some of the alternative ARIMA models that we had considered (table 2).
