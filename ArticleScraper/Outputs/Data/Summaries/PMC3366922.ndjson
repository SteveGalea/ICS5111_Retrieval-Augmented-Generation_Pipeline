{"summary": "RT-PCR is a powerful analytical and preparative method for detecting, quantifying and analyzing gene expression and RNA viruses. most RT-PCR protocols rely on two DNA polymerase (Pol) enzymes; a retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) to copy RNA into cDNA and a thermostable DNA Pol to amplify the target sequence. this is the first report of a reagent enzyme produced from a viral metagenomic library retroviral RTs have precluded development of complete RT-PCR enzyme premixes popular for standard PCR. alternative chemistries based on an improved RT-PCR enzyme are a means of addressing these shortcomings. no truly thermostable viral replicase-type Pol has ever been described. viral metagenomes are an unexplored source of sequence diversity for the development of new enzymes. a screen of hot spring viral metagenomes identified thousands of open reading frames [2] including many encoding putative viral Pols. sensitivity, specificity and overall performance of this mix were compared to available one- and two-enzyme systems. cells were pelleted at 2,800 rcf and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA,0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v glycerol) cells were lysed by sonication and host proteins were denatured by incubation at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes. name DNA Oligonucleotide Sequence 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 Info Source Assay primer * ROX-TGTCTCAGACAGTCAGACTGCTGACTTGCA This report Assay Template AACGTGCAAGTCATCTGTCAGCAGTCTGACTGTCTGAGACA This report Fid-f GTCTGAGGCCCTCTCAGTCCAGTTACGAC 6333 to 6310 X02513 This report M13-f GTCGCGGTAATTGGCGC 6333 to 2-124-f GCTCTAACTCGCGTTCACAGGCTTACAAAGTAACCT 1438 to 1473 NC_001417 [40] MS2-124-r ACACCACCAACAGTCTGGGTTGCCAC 1561 to 1536 NC_001417 [40] MS2-93-f CCCGCTCTCTGAGAGCGGCTCTATTG 2227 to 2252 NC_001417 [40] MS2-217-f GGGCGTCGACCGAAGTCCT biochemical characterization of 3173 Pol units were determined by a radioactive nucleotide incorporation assay [19] as the amount of enzyme that incorporates 10 nmol of deoxynucleotides per 30 minutes at 70\u00b0C. unit activity was determined based on counts adhering to a DE81 filter (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Counts due to free nucleotides were measured after precipitation of polynucleotide substrate with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 10 minutes on ice. site directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange\u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kits (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) 3173 Pols were compared to Pfu (Agilent), Phusion (New England Biolabs) and Taq (Lucigen) Pols. the amplicons were digested with Eco0109 I restriction enzyme. the plates were incubated 20 hours at 37\u00b0C and the number of blue and white colonies was determined visually. the fluorogenic RT assay was performed by incubating 500 ng/l polyA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 25 ng/l oligo-dT. RT primer extension assays were performed using the same conditions as the fluorogenic RT assay. reactions with hexachlorofluorescein labeled dT20 oligonucleotide instead of oligo dT primer were incubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C, and then 30 minutes at 65\u00b0C. ophage (Accession Number NC_001417) was cultivated using published procedures. RNA was isolated from cultures of MCDK cells infected with Influenza A strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) no DNase treatment was used for either preparation. annealed in water at 70\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by incubation on ice. no primer and no RT controls were performed. oligo dT 12\u201318 mer, random hexamers, random nonamers, and gene specific primers were used. qPCR, amplification data was acquired during the PCR extension step. a thermal melt was performed from 70\u201395\u00b0C for the Roche and the Lucigen reagents. a fluorescent DNA-binding dye, EvaGreen (Biotium, Hayward, CA), was added at 0.5. luble proteins were collected from the supernatant after centrifugation at 11,000 rcf for 10 minutes. the labeled assay primer was annealed at room temperature to the assay template and incubated for 10 minutes at 70\u00b0C. pol proteins were expressed, extracted and heat-treated as described for the functional screen and purified using heparin-agarose and Q-sepharose chromatography.

Mix A contained 50 nM primer, 50 nM M13mp18 single strand DNA, and 0.5 nM of Pol in the standard buffer. an aliquot of Mix A was incubated at room temperature to anneal primer. reactions were pre-incubated with enzyme at 70\u00b0C. 3173 wild-type and exo- Pols were compared to Pfu (Agilent), Phusion (New England Biolabs) and Taq (Lucigen) Pols. each of the Pol enzymes was tested according to the respective manufacturer recommendations. reaction contained 5 Pol units, the AMV RT (Promega, Madison, WI) reaction contained 10 units and the MMLV RT (New England Biolabs) reaction contained 200 units based on unit definitions of the suppliers. reaction was preincubated at 37\u00b0C to equilibrate secondary structures of the substrate. RT-PCR MS2 RNA bacteriophage was cultivated using published procedures. RNA was isolated from cultures of MCDK cells infected with Influenza A strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). total human liver RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) was re-suspended in 100 mM EDTA. RNA concentration was estimated by absorbance at 260 nm with an extinction coefficient of 40 g ml1 OD1. PCR and real-time PCR were performed using an iCycler\u00ae MyiQTM thermal cycler (BioRad) for qPCR, amplification data was acquired during the PCR extension step, a thermal melt was performed from 70\u201395\u00b0C. a fluorescent DNA-binding dye, EvaGreen (Biotium, Hayward, CA), was added at 0.5. able thermostable activity was from clone number 3173, encoding 3173 Pol (Figure 1). this enzyme belongs to a family of viral Pols identified in this and other screens that have strongest sequence similarity to Pol I-type enzymes from the Aquificales family. a variant of the lacIq forward mutation fidelity assay was used to determine the fidelity of 3173 Pol in PCR amplification of a DNA target. the wild-type 3173 Pol had a fidelity of 6.7104. onuclease reduced PCR fidelity to 0.9104. the enzyme was preloaded onto a fluorophore-labeled primer/template complex. excess activated calf thymus DNA was added simultaneously with nucleotides. says indicated strong RNA-dependent DNA synthesis (reverse transcription) activity for 3173 Pol in buffers containing either magnesium or manganese. we used two assays to compare the RT activities of the wild-type and exonuclease deficient 3173 Pols to those of AMV and MMLV RTs at 37\u00b0C or 65\u00b0C on an oligo dT primed poly A substrate. the AMV and MMLV had higher RT activity the 3173 Pol and MMLV RT were both able to extend the primer to produce faint, nearly full-length products. the MMLV RT formed a visible template-independent product in the absence of added RNA template that was not resolved by the gel. the 3173 Pol synthesized several shorter length extension products from 175 to 300 bases in length. cDNA synthesis was detected by two-step PCR amplification. only the 821 bp beta-actin sequence (Lane C3) was reverse transcribed by the 3173 Pol. both enzymes appeared to reverse transcribe with primers that would not be expected to prime near the target. cDNA synthesis and amplification occur during the PCR step. the basis of the product in the MMLV RT reaction is not known. 3173 Pol reverse transcribed mRNA transcripts using either 3173 Pol or MMLV RT. beta-actin, beta2-microglobulin and cyclophilin target sequences of the indicated sizes were amplified from human liver total RNA using the primers described in Table 1. shown are products of two step reactions where either MMLV RT or 3173 Pol were used for first strand cDNA synthesis. the 160 bp MS2 primer set from Figure 6A was chosen as well suited for both qPCR and electrophoresis analysis. the estimated limit of detection was between one and ten RNA copies. the water-only control gave a negative response demonstrating high specificity. curve PCR Cycle threshold vs. log10 RNA copy number in triplicate with linear least squares best fit line. the 160 bp MS2 target from Figure 6 was amplified by each enzyme over a dilution range of 102 to 108. a small amount of false product was detectable in the negative control but not by agarose gel. zyme systems using MMLV RT plus Taq Pol are far more commonly used than single-enzyme systems. comparisons were made with three widely used mixes that are based on the two enzyme MMLV RT plus Taq Pol combination, but are referred to as one-step systems. influenza A RNA preparation and a water only control were amplified by one-step RT-PCR reagent mixes (PyroScript, qScript (Quanta), Transcriptor (Roche), and Superscript (Invitrogen) as indicated. the ability of these four reagents to amplify human influenza A virus RNA was also compared. all four reagent mixes amplified the MS2 target with similar efficiency. both the qScript and the PyroScript reagent were found to amplify influenza A several cycles later than the SuperScript and Transcriptor master mixes did. nt template oligonucleotide by a polymerase results in a shift from 37 to 41 nt (peak 2). degradation of the substrate by 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease activity results in peaks of less than 37 nt (peak 4). nt: size of standard markers in nucleotides. proofreading exonuclease activity of 3173 Pol was eliminated. fidelity of incorporation is less important for detection and quantification. fidelity of incorporation is less important for detection and quantification. the same analysis indicated processivity of 47 nucleotides for 3173 Pol. the 3173 enzyme has a half-life at 94\u00b0C of about eleven minutes. in contrast Taq Pol measured under the same conditions lost 45% activity over the two hour assay. RTs were able to extend the primer when polyA RNA template was provided. the length distribution of the cDNAs was visibly shorter than that produced by the MMLV RT. a subset of the 3173 extension products appeared to be so large that they barely entered the gel. HEX-labeled dT20 primed poly A was incubated 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C. then 10 minutes at 65\u00b0C in the presence of indicated Pol enzymes. primer extension products were resolved by 10% denaturing PAGE. RNA targets were MS2 bacteriophage and a human mRNA. the 3173 Pol readily synthesized 77 bp MS2 [40] and 144 bp beta-actin cDNAs. of the longer target sequences tested, only the 821 bp beta-actin sequence (Lane C3) was reverse transcribed by the 3173 Pol. 3173 Pol reverse transcribe mRNA transcripts using two-step RT-PCR protocol. both enzymes appear to transcribe the targets with similar efficiency and specificity. the amount of PCR product for all three transcripts appeared visibly greater in the 3173 Pol reactions. primers used with melting temperatures of 72\u00b0C significantly improved RT-PCR performance of the PyroScript enzyme mix. the one-enzyme PyroScript RT-PCR mix with nine primer sets (Table 1) amplify regions of the MS2 RNA genome [40] up to 362 bp. products from 89 to 362 bp in length were amplified using one-step single-enzyme RT-PCR cycling conditions: 15 sec @ 94\u00b0C, (10 s @ 94\u00b0C, 30 s @ 72\u00b0C)*40. products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. 3173 Pol, exonuclease minus and Tth Pol were used according to manufacturer recommendations to amplify a 102 to 108-fold dilution series of MS2 RNA. a water no target control was amplified using primers targeting the 160 bp product from Figure 6. all of the reagents produced a weak background amplification product of about 60 bp. the transcriptor kit reproducibly amplified more false product. similar slopes from plots of qPCR cycle threshold versus fold target dilution show that all four reagent mixes amplified the MS2 target with similar efficiency. the ability of these four reagents to amplify human influenza A RNA was also compared. the results with influenza A were similar to those seen for the MS2 target. both the qScript and the PyroScript-based mixes amplified the MS2 target. retroviruses will ever provide RTs thermostable for single-enzyme RT-PCR. the two-enzyme systems are widely used and generally reliable. deficiencies inherent in these systems have restricted certain improvements in RT-PCR. a viral metagenomic library originating from a thermal hot spring provided a new enzyme, 3173 Pol, with efficient reverse transcription activity and thermostability for PCR. the physiological role of the RT activity of 3173 Pol is not clear. a previously reported half-life of Taq Pol at 95\u00b0C is 20 minutes [50] the higher reverse transcription temperature should improve specificity and allow synthesis through difficult, structured and G/C rich RNA templates. this broad thermal profile, strand displacement and initiation at nicks have enabled certain isothermal amplification schemes. the high stability of 3173 Pol in solution compared to MMLV RT also allows the formulation of a complete PyroScript RT-PCR master mix. phi29 Pol has a processivity value of greater than 70,000 nt. the processivity of 3173 (47 nt) is comparatively modest. but still higher than either Bst or Taq Pols. 3173 Pol could prove valuable as an RNA sequencing enzyme for transcriptomics research. the PyroScript mix was comparable in sensitivity to three leading commercial two-step RT-PCR kits when used to detect either MS2 phage or influenza A RNA. both the 3173 wild-type and exo- mutants generate PCR products from DNA targets up to 5 kb and higher. this is consistent with the shorter length of cDNA products that we observed in the labeled primer extension experiments. each of these shorter products terminate within a region of secondary structure of the MS2 RNA associated with RNase sensitivity. MMLV RT-based RT-PCR [10] and with optimization may be ameliorated. RNA viruses including influenza, HIV, dengue, west Nile and SARS coronavirus represent a substantial portion of emerging pathogens worldwide."}
