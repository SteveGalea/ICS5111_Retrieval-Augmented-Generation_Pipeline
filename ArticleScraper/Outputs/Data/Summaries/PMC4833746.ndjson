{"summary": "HBoV virus DNA was detected in 15 of 140 samples (10.7 %). positive samples were negative for influenza A and B viruses. co-infection with RSV was found in 2 (13.3%). HBoV1, the fourth most prevalent respiratory virus, was detected worldwide in 2\u201333% of children less than two years of age with RTIs. HBoV1 is responsible for the upper and lower RTIs, often showing a high rate of co-infections with other respiratory viruses specially respiratory syncytial virus. sequences were assembled by Staden Package-2 and edited using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor 7.0.5.3. sequence alignment was performed by using Clustal W multiple alignment. sequences were deposited at GenBank under the accession numbers KJ598617-KJ598621. the sequences were assembled by Staden Package-2 and edited using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Version 7.0.5.3. the sequences were deposited at GenBank under the accession numbers KJ598617-KJ598621. a phylogenetic tree was drawn with VP2 genes by using the neighbor-joining method. in 15 positive samples only five were available for VP2 PCR. a total of 140 throat swabs were tested. a phylogenetic tree was drawn with VP2 genes by using the neighbor-joining method. a phylogenetic tree was drawn with VP2 genes by using the neighbor-joining method. the estimated prevalence of each province is given in Table 1. rate obtained in this research was higher than two previous studies. HBoV1 DNA prevalence in young children with RTIs is about 10%. but in some studies reported up to 33% (13) study had some limitations. first, we did not have more information about the patient\u2019s signs and symptoms. second, we did not have enough clinical samples for doing VP2 PCR."}
