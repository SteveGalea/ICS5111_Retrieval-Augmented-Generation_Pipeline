{"summary": "recent global outbreaks of avian influenza caused by the avian influenza virus pose a serious public health threat because of potential transmission among humans. influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are further divided into subtypes according to the combination of 2 major immunogenic surface glycoprotein components. HA is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with a globular head and a stem region that are both exposed to the outside of the membrane. aptamers are nucleic acid ligands that bind to a specific target molecule with high affinity. they are usually obtained from an oligonucleotide library harboring random sequences by using the SELEX method. aptamers have many advantages over protein antibodies, such as high affinity, rapid synthesis, low cost, low-temperature sensitivity, large-scale production. amers that specifically bind to the gHA1 protein demonstrated that the selected RNA aptamer, HA12-16, effectively inhibited viral infection in host cells and enhanced cell viability. cells were grown in 100 ml of Sf-900 serum-free media (Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, CA) and SFX-Insect cell culture media (Hyclone, Logan, UT) recombinant pBAC6/HA baculovirus plasmids (2 g) and linearized baculovirus DNA (0.5 g) were mixed in Cellfectin reagent (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 5 min and then added to 1 ml of Sf-900 serum-free media. after 15 min of incubation, the DNA mixture was removed and 4 ml of fresh Sf-900 serum-free media was added to concentrated sample was loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-NTA His Trap affinity column. the column was washed twice, and the recombinant gHA1 was eluted with a gradient from 0.1 to 1 M imidazole in the equilibration buffer. gHA1-containing fractions identified by the band corresponding to 50 kDa were then loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 200. gHA1 glycoprotein (50 g) was immobilized on Ni-NTA spin trap columns. negative selection was performed to remove RNAs bound to Ni-NTA resins in columns by passing the RNA pool through separate Ni-NTA spin trap columns. after three iterative rounds of negative selection, unbound RNAs were collected and reloaded onto new Ni-NTA spin trap columns. RNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation. cDNA was cloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector and then transformed into E. coli. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel to measure the amount of DNA that was amplified from each eluant. each RNA aptamer generated by in vitro transcription was dephosphorylated and the 5\u2032-end-labeled with [-32P] ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. the membrane was washed twice with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl) and dried at room temperature. the membrane was then washed twice with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl) and dried at room temperature. the wells of a nickel-coated plate were incubated overnight with the purified gHA1 (0.5 g) at 4\u00b0C. the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBS-T; 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) 3 times and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h to avoid non-specific binding. the titer of virus used for infection was evaluated by the infection of MDCK cells with expression. the cells were seeded on 96-well plates (5103/well) 24 h before the experiment. the cells were maintained as-is or infected with the influenza virus. influenza virus antigen HA was detected by incubating the cultures with a mouse anti-H3 (H3N2) antibody (diluted to 1100 in PBS, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) primary antibodies were detected with FITC-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibodies. recombinant pBAC6 plasmids and linearized baculovirus DNA were co-transfected into insect cells. after 15 min of incubation, the DNA mixture was added to the Sf21 cells (2.0106 cells/ml) in the T25 flask and incubated at 28\u00b0C. purification of gHA1 The gHA1 protein was expressed in a suspension culture of TriEx-Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant pBAC6/HA baculovirus. all viral supernatants were ultra-filtered with the equilibrium buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) tagged gHA1 protein was dialyzed against buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 150 mM NaCl) purified gHA1 was quantified using a Bradford protein assay kit. RNA pool of random sequences (RNA library) was produced by RT-PCR and in vitro transcription of the DNA template containing 40 random nucleotides. random RNA library (6 g) was denatured at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and then incubated at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) plasmid DNA from each clone was prepared and sequenced. each RNA aptamer was generated by in vitro transcription. RT-PCR was carried out as previously described. a nitrocellulose filter binding assay was performed to measure the binding affinities of RNA aptamers with the gHA1 protein. each RNA aptamer generated by in vitro transcription was dephosphorylated. the 5\u2032-32P end-labeled RNA aptamer (5 nM) was incubated with the gHA1 protein (500 nM) in binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m ligation occurred by ligation of biotinylated cytidine to the 3\u2032-end of RNA using the 3\u2032-end biotinylation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) the non-labeled RNAs (50 pmol) were heated at 85\u00b0C for 5 min, immediately put on ice, and added to the reaction mixture (40 U RNase inhibitor, 1 nM biotinylated cytidine (bis the color development was initiated by adding 100 l of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetrametylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to each well, and stopped by adding 2 M H2SO4. the absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a VICTOR X3 Multilabel plate reader. the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. the supernatants were aspirated, and the formazan dyes were dissolved in 100 l/well dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a VICTOR X3 Multilabel plate reader. d goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibodies (Abcam) nuclei were visualized using DAPI (Sigma) staining. immunofluorescence images of the cells were obtained using an AxioCam MRc5 digital camera equipped with an Axio Imager A1 microscope. results and discussion Purification of gHA1 from insect cells. a slightly higher molecular weight of 50 kDa appeared in SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE analysis of AIV HA protein expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. gHA1 was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. the predicted size of unglycosylated HA1 was about 46 kDa. the purified recombinant HA protein was N-glycosylated and was used for the subsequent RNA aptamer selection procedure (SELEX) twelve iterative rounds of the selection process were performed by increasing the stringencies of RNA binding to the gHA1 protein. amplification, amplified cDNA of final round was subcloned. 26 individual aptamer clones were classified into 4 groups. population frequency of selected RNA aptamers was 42.3>26.9>19.2>11.5%. each RNA aptamer group has a conserved sequence that might be considered a binding site specific to the gHA1 protein. the same amount of RNAs from each round was loaded onto an affinity column charged with the target protein. cDNAs were visualized and quantified by ethidium bromide staining on an agarose gel, which reflected the amount of RNA bound to gHA1. each 32P-end labeled RNA aptamer (5 nM) was incubated with gHA1 (500 nM) for 30 min at room temperature. the reaction mixture was filtered through double filters containing nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 m) radioactivity was quantified and normalized as shown in Fig. 5A. HA12-16 aptamer RNA exhibited a higher absorbance value compared with other RNAs, such as the initial RNA library and the HAS15-5 aptamer. the selected RNA aptamer (HA12-16) against gHA1 is different from the HAS15-5 RNA aptamer that has been previously selected against the unglycosylated HA1. HA12-16 aptamer exhibited highest antiviral activity in uninfected cells. extent of cell viability positively correlated with binding affinity of RNA aptamer to gHA1. most effective aptamer prevents influenza infection by strongly binding to the gHA1 viral surface protein. mouse anti-HA antibodies and goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies conjugated to FITC as secondary antibodies were visualized. HA and nuclei are shown in green and blue fluorescence, respectively. the baculovirus expression system can produce post-translationally modified and biologically active recombinant proteins from insect cells. a pBAC6 baculovirus plasmid carrying the full-length HA1 gene was cloned and transfected into Sf21 insect cells. four days post-infection, the secreted recombinant HA1 was collected and purified. the purified gHA1 (3 g) was incubated with (+) or without (\u2013) PNGase F. the reaction mixture was resolved with 12% SDS-PAGE. the migration of PNGase F treated (+) and untreated HA1 is indicated with arrows. RNA library for in vitro selection was produced by PCR and in vitro transcription of DNA template containing 40 random sequences. RNAs selected after the 12th round of SELEX were sequenced and grouped based on sequence similarity. sequences of 26 individual aptamer clones were classified into 4 groups. conserved sequences in each RNA aptamer are believed to be exposed to facilitate interactions with the HA1 protein. the conserved sequences could constitute a binding motif specific to gHA1. the stem structures of other sequences could merely stabilize the secondary structure of RNA. gHA1 protein charged in spin trap columns was eluted with buffer solution containing the initial RNA pool, the 5th, 9th, and 12th round RNA pools. cDNAs indicating the gHA1-bound RNAs were stained with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis. each 32P end-labeled RNA aptamer was incubated with gHA1. the reaction sample was then filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose membrane. gHA1 protein (0.5 g) was incubated with each 3\u2032-biotinylated RNA sample. the RNA aptamer specific to gHA1 suppresses viral infection in the host cell by binding, thereby promoting viability in host cells exposed to the influenza virus. we hypothesized that the RNA aptamer specific to gHA1 suppresses viral infection in the host cell by binding. MDCK cells were infected with influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 TCID50. the highest protective activity was observed by HA12-16, as compared with other selected RNA aptamers. HA12-16 aptamer suppresses viral attachment to the host cells. FITC fluorescence on the cells appeared to be similar to the one treated with the viruses plus the aptamer. this result suggests that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppresses viral attachment to the host cells by neutralizing the receptor-binding site of influenza virus HA. the selected RNA aptamers should be modified to improve stability. if a stable RNA aptamer is combined with appropriate RNA delivery method, it can be used as an antiviral reagent."}
