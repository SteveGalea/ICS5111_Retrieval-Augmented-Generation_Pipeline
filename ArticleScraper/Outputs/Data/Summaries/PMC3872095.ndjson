{"summary": "worldwide, there are reportedly about 12 million severe and 3 million very severe cases of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. a recent global survey suggests that RSV is not prevalent throughout the year in the tropical regions of the globe. the incidence peaks in winter with a wide ranging persistence depending on the geographical topology. fusion protein (F) is a negative strand RNA genome virus. it fuses with the host cell membrane using the F protein. the RNA genome itself transcribes mRNA for protein synthesis without any intermediate. children of nosocomial origin show symptoms within 4 to 6 days of infection. most of them recover in 1 to 2 weeks while serving as carriers of the virus for 1 to 3 weeks. there is no specific treatment for RSV infection ever since its first discovery in 1956. diagnostic assays for detection of pathogens have a pivotal role in public-health monitoring [23], but diagnosis becomes difficult when the causative agent exhibits overlapping symptoms with other disease(s) or remains nonsymptomatic. the correct diagnosis has to be empirically derived for the treatment. immuno-complexes detected chromatographically Easy, rapid, handy, cost effective, FDA approved Nonquantitative, limit of sample volume limits detection Hospital based procedure, commercial diagnostic assays (C) Molecular methods (1) LAMP [41, 43\u201345] Colorimetric/turbidimetric detection of isothermal amplification of DNA using specific primer Sensitivity and specificity Semiquantitative, designing compatible primer set Research intent, not commercialized (2) PCR. analytes with low-frequency vibrational and/or rotational energy Rapid and nondestructive detection of specific protein-antibody complexes. ELISA is extensively used for detection of various proteins at very low concentration in different sample types. ELISA for RSV detection is mainly based on targeting RSV F protein (antigen) the antigen-antibody complex is detected by horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody on a screen printed electrochemical cell coated with the substrate. DFA is a standard detection technique used for decades and other detection techniques are often compared to DFA for evaluating their efficiency. the antigen-antibody complex forms a thin layer, which changes the reflective properties of the surface. the technique is simple, rapid, and sensitive and as low as 1 ng of antibody per mL can also be detected. RT-LAMP was tested for RSV detection from nasopharyngeal aspirates. compared with viral isolation, enzyme immunoassay, immuno-chromatographic assay, and real-time PCR. RT-LAMP was the most sensitive among all the methods tested. LAMP had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% when compared with PCR. the PCR method was based on the reverse transcription-nested PCR technique involving the outer and inner primers designed from the F gene of RSV strain A, over a two day procedure with a sensitivity of 73%. this method is faster as compared to the conventional culture method which usually takes 3\u20135 days. a similar assay was developed for the detection of RSV in the bronchoalveolar lavage of lung transplant patients or patients with respiratory infections. the assay was designed based on the RSV N gene and first involved a screening step of the positive samples using a SYBR green based assay. the assay was found positive in 16% of transplant patients. method was more rapid as the results were obtained in 3.5 to 4 hours upon receiving the samples. several other reports emphasize the applicability of real-time PCR in detection of RSV in immunocompromised patients. sensitivity of the technique relies on age of the patients. microarrays are the miniaturized assay platforms with a high-density array of immobilized DNA or protein. hybridization of sample biomolecules to corresponding DNA or protein on the chip is detected. microarray has proved to be a robust and reliable tool to understand the echelon of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. the procedure is simple and follows few steps including RNA extraction from clinical samples, reverse transcription, second-strand cDNA synthesis, and then PCR amplification of randomly primed cDNA. the hybridization of nucleic acids with probes is done by fluorescent dyes or by an alternative method of electrochemical detection. the hybridization of nucleic acids with probes is done by fluorescent dyes. the gene expression profile shortly after RSV infection can be accounted as a biomarker and scaled up for diagnostics with in vitro and in vivo profiles. this situation may arise in complications of RSV with other associated disorders like asthma [70, 71]. PCR amplification of pathogen nucleic acid combined with MS can be used as substitutes [88\u201390] MS has the advantage of rapid identification of multiple viruses at same time and even identifies protein modification status. the surveillance of samples from 2005-2006 influenza virus incidence showed evidence of new genotypes of the H3N2 strains. the study also suggested approximately 1% mixed viral quasi-species in the 2005-2006 samples providing insight into viral evolution. ed with gold nanoparticles functionalized with both, palivizumab (Synagis), an anti-RSV F protein antibody, and DNA sequence partially hybridized with a tag DNA sequence (fAuNP) this assay offers a 4000-fold improvement in the limit of detection over ELISA and a 4-fold improvement over detection when compared with real-time RT-PCR. quantitative assay using this approach was possible using DNA hairpin structures functionalized to a gold filament. the set-up was able to detect as low as 11.9 PFUs, which was 200 times better than a standard comparison ELISA. however, the comparative efficacy of DFA with other assays does not seem to have reached a consensus. in vitro, on vero cell lines was extrapolated by an in vivo study. the approach beyond diagnostics can be used for multiplexed virus and/or host cell antigen detection and intracellular tracking studies. Flow cytometer could detect RSV with sensitivity and reproducibility. Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) works on the basis of the inelastic scattering of monochromatic radiation like near infrared, visible, or near ultraviolet, interacting with an analyte with low-frequency vibrational and/or rotational energy. but the signal generated is low and hence the signal is enhanced using silver or gold matrix substrates. sensitivity of SERS to resolve strain level differences for RSV strains A/Long, A2, G, and B1 can be exploited for clinical diagnosis instrumentation. ELISA is extensively used for detection of various proteins at very low concentration in different sample types. antigen-antibody complex is detected by horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody on a screen printed electrochemical cell coated with the substrate. sensitivity and specificity of DFA are a subject of variance as the success of the technique is dependent on numerous factors. optical immunoassay (OIA) is an immunochromatographic technique known for the rapid detection of RSV from nasal washes or nasal aspirates. the technique is simple, rapid, and sensitive and as low as 1 ng of antibody per mL can also be detected. ELISA for RSV detection is mainly based on targeting RSV F protein (antigen) several modifications of the classical ELISA technique have been efficiently developed and employed for the detection of RSV. DFA can detect RSV with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 99.6%. the sensitivity decreases if tested 4\u20137 days after the onset of the symptoms. lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA) is an immunochromatographic technique known for the rapid detection of RSV from nasal washes or nasal aspirates. the lateral flow of antigen-antibody complex on the substrate matrix reaches the reaction area and results in formation of colored band indicating the presence of antigen in the specimen. RT-LAMP was the most sensitive among all the methods tested, with exception of real-time PCR. the RT-LAMP was specific for RSV and did not react with any other respiratory pathogens like RNA viruses, DNA virus, or bacteria. development in the chemistry of the LAMP has made it slightly inconvenient as a cost-effective detection technique. the PCR method was based on the reverse transcription-nested PCR technique involving the outer and inner primers designed from the F gene of RSV strain A. this method is faster as compared to the conventional culture method which usually takes 3\u20135 days. real-time PCR is by far the most sensitive method for the detection and diagnosis of a wide array of pathogens, including RSV. real-time PCR based on RSV N gene has been used to quantify RSV from the nasal aspirates of children. the method was one log more sensitive than the conventional culture method. the method was one log more sensitive than the conventional culture method. multiplex PCR has been used for the detection and subtyping of RSV and human influenza virus simultaneously. the method was based on the primer sets of hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein gene of influenza virus and nucleocapsid protein gene of RSV. it suffered from the drawback that it could not distinguish between RSV A and B. real-time PCR is the most sensitive method for the detection and diagnosis of a wide array of pathogens, including RSV. a rapid, sensitive, and specific method was devised based on TaqMan real-time PCR for the detection of both RSV A and RSV B strains. the method was one log more sensitive than the conventional culture method. the real-time PCR assay resulted in 56% of positives. the immunofluorescence assay had 41.3% and culture method 45.3% of positives. a rapid and sensitive detection assay for RSV and other respiratory viruses was developed by Idaho Technologies christened as FilmArray. this is an automatic real-time molecular station with capability of nucleic acid extraction, initial reverse transcription, and singleplex second-stage PCR reactions for specific virus detection. this would result in more efficient therapy for respiratory diseases via the concept of personalized medicine. sequencing coupled with microarray is a powerful high throughput diagnostic tool. the technique is simple and follows few steps including RNA extraction from clinical samples, reverse transcription, second-strand cDNA synthesis, and then PCR amplification of randomly primed cDNA. genes involved in pathways of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, p53 signaling, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, jak-STAT signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cancer were upregulated in RSV-infected BEAS-2B cells. 1682 and 3771 genes were downregulated at 4 h and 24 h, respectively, and only mass spectroscopy (MS) is a method of choice for molecular investigation of pathogens. the combination of affinity based viral detention and nucleic acid based MS serves as a solution for low detection limits. now, MS is no longer confined to proteomics based analysis. a notable ESI-MS for global surveillance of influenza virus was accomplished by Sampath et al. [75] by coupling MS with reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) the study correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates. nanotechnology exploits these new properties and harnesses them with the existing technologies to exceptional capabilities. nanoparticle amplified immuno-PCR is used widely for the detection of various bacterial and viral antigens with lower titers as meagre as zepto moles. oligonucleotide-functionalized gold nanoparticulate probe was suggested as an improvement. the DNA is so designed that the loop portion has a complimentary sequence to RNA to be detected and the 5\u2032 stem is linked to gold nanoparticle by thiol group. the 3\u2032 end is linked to a fluorophore. fluorescent nanoparticles appear promising candidates for field clinical diagnostics. due to their inorganic nature, they are less susceptible to metabolic degradation. they do not lose fluorescence on long exposure to light and can be excited at the same wavelength while radiating at different wavelengths. a 40-nm carboxylate-modified fluorescent nanoparticles and streptavidin-coated QDs were used in their study. a 40-nm carboxylate-modified fluorescent nanoparticles and streptavidin-coated QDs were used in their study. SERS can be targeted to various analytes that may constitute DNA, RNA, proteins, or other organic compounds. nucleic acids are preferred candidates in biological SERS investigations. the influence of base composition and sequence is expressed as typical spectral signature. the MMP-RSV complex is then countered with gold nanoparticles functionalized with both, palivizumab (Synagis), an anti-RSV F protein antibody, and DNA sequence partially hybridized with a tag DNA sequence. this assay offers a 4000-fold improvement in the limit of detection over ELISA and a 4-fold improvement over detection compared with real-time RT-PCR. quantitative assay was possible using DNA hairpin structures functionalized to a gold filament. the set-up was able to detect as low as 11.9 PFUs, which was 200 times better than a standard comparison ELISA. the prime possible disadvantages and inconsistencies of DFA can be attributed to the fading of the dyes. this method was more sensitive than real-time quantitative RT-PCR. it was extrapolated by an in vivo study on vero cell lines. it can be used for multiplexed virus and/or host cell antigen detection and intracellular tracking studies. surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy works on the basis of the inelastic scattering of monochromatic radiation like near infrared, visible, or near ultraviolet. but the signal generated is low and hence the signal is enhanced using silver or gold matrix substrates. the most widely used one is the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. SERS is an established powerful tool for sensitive, expedited, and specific detection of various respiratory pathogens, like Mycoplasma pneumoniae and RSV. sensitivity of SERS to resolve strain level differences for RSV strains A/Long, A2, G, and B1 can be exploited for clinical diagnosis instrumentation. effective preventive measures reduce the mortality and economic burden of the disease. polyclonal antibodies from healthy human individuals resistant to RSV were successful in preventing RSV infection in high risk infants. the monoclonal antibody specifically neutralizing F protein conferred effective protection against RSV as compared to RespiGam. palivizumab is now used to passively protect high risk infants from severe disease, thus replacing the RespiGam. minimum 5 doses are recommended irrespective of the month of the first dose for all geographical locations for infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks 0 days to 32 weeks 6 days without hemodynamically significant CHD or CLD. the infants were qualified for receiving prophylaxis only until they reached 90 days of age. mice challenged with the RSV-G construct had balanced systemic and pulmonary Th1/Th2 cytokines and RSV neutralizing antibody responses. but the wild type RSV F protein expressed from DNA plasmid was poorly expressed. a codon optimized DNA vaccine was designed for better in vivo expression and thus reduced the RSV titer. immunized mice induced neutralization antibody, systemic Ab (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b) responses, and mucosal antibody responses (Ig A) which mimicked the challenge with live RSV. mice immunized with the DRF-412 vector contained less RSV RNA in lung tissue and induced a higher mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine immune response. a rational approach to confer protection against various pathogens Xie et al. used this interesting way of delivering and expressing the DNA vaccine in mice against RSV. a novel method of developing RSV DNA vaccine was devised by replacing structural genes with RSV genes in an attenuated strain of equine encephalitis virus. an antigenic region corresponding to RSV F protein (region 255\u2013278) was cloned into a vector with ctxA2 B gene of cholera toxin and named as rF255, which elicited a helper T cell type 1 immune response in mice. a multivalent recombinant protein was developed by cloning RSV F, M2, and G protein into a bacterial pET32a (+) vector (called a similar approach was adopted for developing a recombinant alphavirus or immune stimulating complex (ISCOM) antigen against RSV. the recombinant vector was designed by using a self-abortive alphavirus called Semiliki forest virus carrying RSV F gene. the recombinant vaccine SFV/F or SFV/FG resulted in resistance to RSV infection without worsened RSV disease. the results were opposite in ISCOM/FG with enhanced goblet cell hyperplasia post-RSV challenge. several applications of nanotechnology have appeared in the development of vaccines popularly known as nanovaccines. a vaccine based on the recombinant RSV N gene rings, called N-SRS, enclosing a bacterial RNA has been developed and assessed intranasally in BALB/c mice. nanoemulsion (NE) was used as an adjuvant to mucosal RSV vaccine in a mouse model and found to provide significant protection against RSV, along with antigen specific humoral responses. the use of these epitopes for neutralizing antibodies as a vaccine requires the retention of immuno functional conformation while getting rid of the undesired protein. the study was extrapolated to phase 1 human clinical trials, which showed its safety and efficacy against RSV. antibodies RSV has three envelope proteins F, G, and SH. the recombinant monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, is now used to protect high risk infants from severe disease, thus replacing the RespiGam. palivizumab has been found to neutralize RSV by binding the fusion protein F after attachment to the host, but before the viral transcription. there was a reduction in viral transcription, thus inhibiting both cell-cell and virus-cell fusion. effective use of palivizumab is limited due to the cost and its use in infants with high risk of bronchiolitis. the efficacy of the plant derived palivizumab was more than the mammalian derived palivizumab or the plant derived human monoclonal antibodies in cotton rats. DNA Vaccines RSV genome codes structural and functional proteins that are immunogenic and referred for vaccine development against RSV. a codon optimized DNA vaccine was designed for better in vivo expression. a construct was designed by inserting the F gene into NDV-F. this modification served the purpose of higher elicitation of IFN by NDV-F than RSV. INF-A haemagglutinin (HA), INF-A nucleoprotein (NP), HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) and RSV glycoprotein F were immunized with mixture of four plasmids. this led to protection of mice from the respective pathogens of challenge. recent developments have been made in the field of recombinant vaccines. VEEV has an ssRNA (+) genome and contains a strong subgenomic promoter. replicon particles were prepared by providing helper RNAs encoding VEEV capsid and envelope glycoprotein which comprise structural proteins. the system could be modulated by the administration of helper RNAs. several studies have used the approach of combining other viruses with RSV genes. one such study uses virus like particles (VLP) developed from NP and M proteins of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and a chimeric protein consisting of cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of NDV HN protein and ectodomain of the RSV G protein (H/G) rSVV based vaccines resulted in enhanced immune responses to RSV antigens serving as suitable vaccines in rhesus monkeys. similar approach was adopted for developing a recombinant alphavirus or immune stimulating complex (ISCOM) antigen against RSV. chitosan nanoparticles are being developed against RSV. a DNA vaccine (DR-FM2G) constitutive expression vector was encapsulated using chitosan nanoparticles. the advantages of DCNPs are that it was more stable than naked DNA or chitosan. nanoemulsion (NE) was used as an adjuvant to mucosal RSV vaccine. it was found to provide significant protection against RSV, along with antigen specific humoral responses and an enhanced Th1/Th2 response. NE-RSV also led to higher expression of RSV specific antibody, with significant decrease in viral load. the study was extrapolated to phase 1 human clinical trials. it showed its safety and efficacy against RSV. supplementary nutrients could reverse the adverse effects of disorders and diseases. the target genes and proteins vital for RSV infection are important for developing preventative and treatment measures. a focus is therefore on development of potent drug which holds conformity in the human trials. some of the approaches are described below that promise to be a potential treatment for RSV. ribavirin is phosphorylated in the cells and competes with adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate and guanosine-5\u2032-triazole-3-carboxamide. ribavirin is a competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), causing deletion of GTP and messenger RNA (mRNA capping enzyme) ate and mizoribine have shown antiviral activity against the hepatitis C virus. a well-known compound RSV 604 showed promising results against RSV. a derivative of antibiotic geldanamycin 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17DMAG) targeted against cancer has now attracted researchers due to its anti the first reports of the use of peptide(s) as fusion inhibitors include the development of DP-178, a synthetic peptide based on the leucine zipper region of the HIV fusion glycoprotein gp41 [167], which showed an IC50 at 0.38 nM against HIV-1. fusion inhibitors for paramyxoviruses have also been developed based on the conserved region of the fusion protein F. a peptide derived from the RSV-F binding domain of RhoA (RhoA77-95) was shown to inhibit RSV and PIV-3 infection and syncytium formation, block cell-to-cell fusion, and reduce viral titers and illness in mice. a lead compound was identified to synthesize an analogue JNJ2408068, a low molecular weight benzimidazole, which showed high anti-viral activity a second series of derivatives of the compound 1 were developed and evaluated for SAR and their functionality as fusion inhibitors. these compounds were developed from 1, which had a tolerant diethylaminoethyl side chain with both polar and nonpolar functionality against RSV. these compounds were named 2 and had an additional structural vector absent in 1, which accounted for enhanced potency as fusion inhibitors. the compound was analyzed for its antiviral activity, cell permeability, and metabolic stability in human live microsomes. three compounds 18j, 18i, and 18n were shown to have anti-viral activity against RSV in the BALB/c mice. a compound RFI-641 was found to be the most potent anti-RSV agent in vitro and in vivo. carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are emerging nanomaterials for biomedical application. polyvinylpyrrolidone conjugated silver nanoparticles showed low toxicity to HEp-2 cells at low concentrations and exhibited 44% RSV inhibition. emergence of nanotechnology has opened new avenues for RSV treatment. mice treated with siRNA nanoparticles showed significant decrease in inflammation. an interferon-inducible enzyme, 2-5A-dependent RNase, present in higher vertebrates requires 5\u2032-phosphorylated, 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylate (2-5A) for its endoribonuclease activity against single-stranded RNAs. this feature of 2-5A-dependent RNaseL is looked upon as an effective RSV treatment. a chimera of 2-5A-antisense christened as NIH351 was used to develop NIH351. it was 50- to 90-fold more potent against ribavirin than ribavirin. resulting new version RBI034 was 50% more effective than the parent molecule against RSV (strain A and B) ALN-RSV01 proved to be safe against RSV even in a complex clinical situation like lung transplants. it is the product of alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and has completed phase IIb clinical trials. another approach of RNAi treatment to combat RSV is to decelerate the adverse effects of RSV mediated Th2 type immune response. plant extracts of Lonicera deflexicalyx (Chin Jinyinhua) were tested against RSV. the active compound from the extract was 3, 5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (CJ 4-16-4), which was isolated, and purified by a series of chromatographic processes. modified Dingchuan decoction (MDD) exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effect in mice. ribavirin is phosphorylated in the cells and competes with adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate and guanosine. ribavirin is a competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), causing deletion of GTP and messenger RNA (mRNA) guanylyl transferase. the exact mechanism of anti-viral activity of ribavirin against RNA and DNA viruses is still not clear. the anti-RSV activity of these compounds was seen in human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) these compounds are also known to inhibit replication of HPIV, influenza virus, and rhinovirus. the anti-viral activity dose is not toxic to the cells and inhalation mode of treatment can increase local efficacy. DP-178 is an FDA approved anti-HIV drug with international nonproprietary name (INN) Enfuvirtide and trade name Fuzeon. out of the peptides tested, the peptide T-118 developed from RSV was the most effective. a vast screening of as many as 16,671 compounds was conducted for anti-RSV activity in vitro. two novel compounds, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methoxy-N-methyl-3-(6-methyl[1,2, 4]triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazin-3-yl)-1,4-diazepane, were mined, which reduced the virus infectivity with IC50 values of 0.11 and 0.13 M. the oxadiazolone had anti-RSV activity comparable to that of ribavirin. the ester modified group 2 compounds were suitable for oral administration. a benzimidazole-2-one derivative called BMS-433771 was an orally active RSV inhibitor. effective against 6 laboratory and 18 clinical viruses at concentrations between 0.008 and 0.11 mM (0.013\u20130.18 mg/mL) the compound reduced the viral load to an extent of 1.7 logs in the African green monkey model and also in mice and cotton rats. the compound reduced the viral load to an extent of 1.7 logs in the African green monkey model. the interference mediated by siRNA was used against human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis C, and parainfluenza virus (PIV) in cell culture. the concept of inhibiting RSV infection using targeted antisense mechanism was applied by Jairath et al. by silencing the RSV-NS2 gene. the endoribonuclease activity of 2-5A-dependent RNaseL was used for targeting RSV M2 gene specifically by covalent 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate target antisense. the endoribonuclease activity was negligible with an inactive dimeric form of 2-5A linked to antisense, which resulted in the reduction of RSV replication. antiviral activity targeted the nucleocapsid gene of RSV. intranasal dosing of ALN-RSV01 resulted in a 2.5- to 3.0-log-unit reduction in RSV lung concentration. safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics were tested on healthy adults. PMOs are the oligomers where the nucleobases are covalently attached with the morpholine ring replacing the deoxyribose sugar. the phosphodiester bond is replaced by the phosphodiester bond. this is specifically true for mRNA and its translation. this is specifically true for mRNA and its translation. the active compound from the extract was 3, 5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (CJ 4-16-4), which was isolated, and purified by a series of chromatographic processes. it is suggested that CJ 4-16-4 is a fusion inhibitor and the in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that it is a more effective RSV inhibitor than ribavirin. challenges in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of RSV technology have provided enough capabilities for the detection of RSV in various sample types at various stages of infection using an array of techniques. the most important perspective of RSV diagnosis is the strategic management of choice between the point of care testing and central laboratory testing. there are many aspects that need to be addressed in the challenges for vaccine development programs and the technological interventions to deal with RSV. the challenges include safety issues concerning the subjects involved in clinical trials, as evident by the failure of formalin inactivated RSV vaccine and motavizumab. there is no significant correlation between increased disease severity, respiratory deaths, and detection of any of the respiratory viruses. there is limited data to correlate RSV global transmission dynamics with climate and population [2], due to which it is difficult to develop strategies for RSV prevention and treatment. there is no vaccine or effective treatment against RSV, but the rapid and sensitive detection is possible."}
