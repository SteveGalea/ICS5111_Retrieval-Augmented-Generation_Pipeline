{"summary": "resilience is a universal concept that can be operationalised uniformly across populations and age groups using a single scale. many variables are not static, interacting dynamically and changing over time; therefore, longitudinal methods must be employed to disentangle these relationships. definition-driven methods use an a priori set of criteria and components to establish which individuals are resilient. resilience may involve the continued avoidance or absence of a negative state, for example, symptoms of depression. data-driven methods are specific to the adversity\u2013adaptation dyad examined in a given study. 'resilience AND (ageing OR aging)' were searched across all years. in Scopus, article title, abstract and keywords were searched across all years. in Web of Science, \u2018topics\u2019 were searched across all years. in Scopus, article title, abstract and keywords were searched across all years. 'topics' were searched across all years excluding books, letters, corrections, meetings or editorial, that is, non-peer reviewed articles. references and relevant articles were hand searched. included studies (n=36) most commonly examined protective/risk factors for resilience. sample size ranged from 30 to 10 835 with an average of 758.69 (SD=1877.6) and median of 233.5. more studies included non-acute adversity than acute adversity, for example, disaster. spouses Bonanno et al17 185 65 72 6.5 3 72 USA Bereaved spouses Ho et al18 76 21 66 38.9 9.2 4 52 China Hereditary gastrointestinal cancer registry Jaffee19 2065 8 16 10.96 4.54 3 144 54.0 Maltreated children Mlinac et al20 470 79.9 5.8 4 192 USA 74.9 Community-dwelling older adults Netuveli et al21 3581 50 3 Va et al36 190 6 16 10.7 2.31 3 24 Australia 37.0 Accident victims Murphy and Marelich37 111 6 11 8.5 1.8 4 72 USA 45.9 Children of HIV/AIDS diagnosed mothers Norris et al38 39 561 4 72 Mexico Flood victims 1267 4 120 USA Nugent et al41 10 835 45.3 9.6 3 416 USA 13.4 9/11 responders Saad et al42 398 6 24 USA 100.0 Breast cancer surgery patients Self-Brow latent class analysis (n=1), longitudinal hierarchical clustering (n=2), semiparametric group-based clustering (n=3) and GMM (n=17) were used to identify groups of individuals with similar trajectories based on individuals' scores on a continuous variable.
