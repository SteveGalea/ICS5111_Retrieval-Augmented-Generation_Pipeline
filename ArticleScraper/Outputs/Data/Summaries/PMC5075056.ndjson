{"summary": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped virus, and its envelope protein recognizes CD26 as the host receptor (12) the virus may enter the host cells via membrane fusion either at the plasma membrane or in the endosomes after endocytosis. TMPRSS2 inhibition was more effective than cathepsin inhibition in the prevention of MERS-CoV infection in vitro (16) nafamostat, a serine protease inhibitor, was the most potent inhibitor. nafamostat was the most potent inhibitor among the evaluated compounds. recombinant pseudotype retroviruses were produced using plat-E cells. 293FT-derived reporter cells infected with pseudotype viruses were selected with 1 g/ml puromycin, 10 g/ml blasticidin, and 300 g/ml hygromycin for at least 1 week. these bulk selected cells were used to perform fusion assays. Calu3 (ATCC HTB-55) cells were used as target cells for the fusion and viral infection assays. effector cells expressing MERS-S and DSP8-11 and target cells expressing CD26, TMPRSS2 and DSP1-7 were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates. two hours before the assay, cells were treated with 6 M EnduRen (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), a substrate for Renilla luciferase, to activate EnduRen. rivaroxaban (Adooq Bioscience, Irvine, CA, USA), telaprevir (Adooq Bioscience), and simeprevir (TRC, Toronto, Canada) were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. the FDA-approved drug library (L1300) was purchased from Selleck (Houston, TX, USA) and diluted in DMSO at a concentration of 100 M. recombinant pseudotype retroviruses were produced using plat-E cells with a vesicular stomatitis virus-G-expressing plasmid. 293FT-derived reporter cells infected with pseudotype viruses were selected with 1 g/ml puromycin, 10 g/ml blasticidin, and 300 g/ml hygromycin for at least 1 week. lines expressing MERS-S, CD26, and TMPRSS2 genes were cloned into a pMXs-IRES-blasticidin retroviral vector. TMPRSS2 was cloned into the pMXs-IRES-hygromycin vector. effector cells expressing MERS-S and DSP8-11 and target cells expressing CD26, TMPRSS2 and DSP1-7 were seeded in 12-well nafamostat mesylate (Tokyo Chemical Industry), camostat mesilate (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), sivelestat sodium tetrahydrate (LKT Laboratories), rivaroxaban (Adooq Bioscience), telaprevir (Adooq Bioscience), and simeprevir (TRC, Toronto, Canada) were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. 293FT cell lines express a reporter protein called DSP as the effector and target cells. the chimeric split reporter proteins self-associate and facilitate association of split RL domains. membrane fusion between the effector and target cells can be monitored by both GFP and RL signals generated from the reassociated DSPs. the effector 293FT cells expressing DSP8-11 were transduced with MERS-S. the target 293FT cells expressing DSP1-7 were transduced with CD26 and TMPRSS2 separately or simultaneously. this yielded target cells that could fuse with the effector cells upon cocultivation. the concentration of the substrate for RL, EnduRen, was reduced to 6 M. for negative-control experiments, 293FT/DSP1-7 cells were cocultured with 293FT/DSP8-11/MERS-CoV S cells (n = 16) or 293FT/DSP1-7/CD26/TMPRSS2 cells were cocultured with 293FT/DSP8-11 cells (n = 16) nafamostat mesylate (nafamostat), a serine protease inhibitor, reduced DSP activity to only 1.66% of that of the control. if a drug showed inhibition in the latter assay, the drug was therefore not a specific inhibitor of membrane fusion but a nonspecific inhibitor of RL itself. determined for the most active drug, nafamostat (1.66% of the control value), is indicated with a red arrow and red dot. each drug (1 M) was applied to cells coexpressing both DSP1-7 and DSP8-11, which harbored reassociated active DSP. the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of nafamostat was 0.1 M, about 10 times lower than that of camostat. the effect of each drug on the coculture fusion assay using DSP as a reporter is indicated below the graph. effectsor cells expressing only DSP8-11 were used as a control. nafamostat was the best inhibitor among the drugs we evaluated. the results showed that nafamostat was more efficient at inhibiting DSP than camostat. nafamostat was a potent inhibitor of MERS-S-mediated membrane fusion. inhibition was most likely a result of inhibition of TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane. nafamostat reduced viral entry by 100-fold at a concentration of as low as 1 nM. se inhibitors camostat and nafamostat pretreated with different concentrations of individual inhibitors. the amount of internalized viral RNA was quantified by real-time PCR. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences determined by Student's t test. membrane fusion mediated by the MERS-S protein was monitored by coculturing the effector and target cells expressing the respective split reporter proteins (dual split proteins [DSPs]). the effector cells express MERS-S protein, and the target cells express CD26 and TMPRSS2. effector 293FT cells expressing DSP8-11 were transduced with MERS-S. the target 293FT cells expressing DSP1-7 were transduced with CD26 and TMPRSS2 separately or simultaneously. different combinations of these effector and target cells were cocultured, and the result RL activity was measured. this experiment was performed on a 384-well plate at the same time. the Z\u2032 factor value was >0.5 even in the presence of 2% DMSO. the results showed good reproducibility of our assay for HST. direct inhibition of RL by 55% was observed with only one drug, fenoprofen calcium. nafamostat, a serine protease inhibitor, potently inhibited MERS-S-mediated membrane fusion. sivelestat sodium tetrahydrate, rivaroxaban, telaprevir, ulinastatin, and simeprevir showed no inhibition of DSP activity, even at a higher concentration. nafamostat showed 50% inhibition at 1 M, about 10 times lower than camostat. each drug was added to cells coexpressing DSP1-7 and DSP8-11 to evaluate its direct inhibitory effects on RL. the relative DSP signal is indicated in the vertical axis by setting the control value with DSP alone as 100%. effectsor cells expressing only DSP8-11 were used as a control. vivo, and Calu3 cells may represent a more suitable physiological target for MERS-S-mediated membrane fusion. nafamostat and camostat were transduced with a retroviral vector harboring DSP1-7. results showed that nafamostat was more efficient at inhibiting DSP than camostat. inhibitors were added after virus had been incubated with Calu3 cells. amount of progeny viruses released into the culture medium was measured by titration using vero/TMPRSS2 cells. nafamostat was significantly more effective than camostat. this fusion assay did not use live viruses and could be finished within several hours. Candidate drugs identified in the DSP assay can be further evaluated in a virus infection assay. we used the RL mode of the DSP reporter because it could provide a more quantitative reading than the GFP mode without image analyses. further, the luminescent signals of the RL mode were less likely to suffer from the nonspecific noise of natural color or possible fluorescence emitted from the test drugs in the G nafamostat, a serine protease inhibitor, exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity. the efficacy of nafamostat was weaker than that of nafamostat. the alternative endocytic pathway uses other proteases, such as cathepsins. it is hard to estimate the exact contribution of each entry pathway in real infections in vivo. however, other assay systems are required to screen potential drugs targeted at proteases other than TMPRSS2. nafamostat is currently indicated for systemic use in the treatment of pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. the anticoagulatory activity as implicated in the latter indication may cause unwanted side effects when applied to MERS."}
