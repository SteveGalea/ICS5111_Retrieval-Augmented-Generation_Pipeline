{"summary": "CNS infection with a glial-tropic sublethal variant of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), designated JHMV-v2.2-1. both T and B cell priming occurs in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) (5\u20137). virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are essential to clear infectious virus. CXCL13 recruited activated B and follicular helper CD4+ T (TFH) cells expressing CXCR5 (15\u201317) CXCL13 is also associated with lymphoid neogenesis in nonlymphoid tissue, such as joints during rheumatoid arthritis (18) and CNS meninges during some neuroinflammatory diseases. the C3d-Ag complex acts directly on activated B cells in follicles. the complex also acts directly on activated B cells in follicles and the GC. clonal selection of activated B cells in GCs is limited. infected CD19/ mice mounted virus-specific serum Abs. early polyclonal ASC expansion prior to GC formation was significantly reduced. RESULTS CD19 deficiency abrogates peripheral GC formation following CNS infection. GL7+ B cells were scattered within the follicle without forming structures resembling GC architecture. quantitative evaluation of the GL7+ area by immunofluorescence highlighted significantly reduced reactivity in CD19/ compared to WT mice. CLN tissue was assessed for aicda RNA transcript levels by RT PCR. the data represent the means plus SEM of transcript levels relative to gapdh mRNA of individual mice. CD19/ mice exhibited modestly increased aicda mRNA levels in CLN between days 7 and 21 p.i. but these levels did not significantly differ from those in naive CD19/ mice until day 21 p.i. despite severely impaired GC formation, we assessed transcript levels for several chemokines and cytokines regulating B cell migration and differentiation. mRNA levels were not significantly altered in the absence of CD19. transcript levels of the Tnfsf13b gene, which encodes the survival factor B cell activation factor (BAFF), were also similar in the two groups, suggesting no deficits in retaining B cell viability. we also assessed upregulation of transcripts encoding complement protein C3. mRNA of individual mice from 2 separate experiments is denoted by asterisks: *, P 0.05. impaired GC formation in CLN was also a hallmark of CXCL13/ mice infected with JHMV. neutralizing serum Ab was initially reduced in infected CD19/ relative to WT mice at day 7 p.i. but it reached levels found in WT mice by day 14 p.i. thus, despite impaired GC formation in the absence of CD19, virus-specific serum Ab responses were induced, albeit with delayed kinetics, at lower levels. the induction, but not maintenance, of virus-specific serum Ab prompted us to investigate the kinetics of virus-specific IgG ASC accumulation in CLN and bone marrow (BM). viro-specific IgG ASC emerged at day 7 in CLN of WT mice, reached peak frequencies at day 14 p.i., and declined by day 21 p.i. the peak of virus-specific ASC at day 14 p.i. in CLN following JHMV infection was preceded by a peak in polyclonal ASC expansion at day 7 p.i. (11, 12) similar numbers of B220+ B cells in CLN of both groups during infection indicated no overall deficiencies in the B cell compartment or recruitment to CLN following infection. CD19 deficiency severely diminishes CNS humoral responses. accumulation of ASC in the CNS is dependent on differentiation in GCs. the paucity in virus-specific ASC in the brain was supported by direct analysis of supernatants for virus-specific IgG2a Ab. compared to the progressive increase of virus-specific IgG2a Ab from days 14 to 28 p.i. in WT mice, the levels were barely above background in CD19/ mice. both brains and spinal cords of infected WT mice exhibited a significant increase in IgG heavy chain mRNA by 14 days p.i. the levels at day 28 p.i. did not even reach those of WT mice at day 14 p.i. CD19/ mice showed a significant reduction in the frequency of ASC expressing CXCR4 in the CLN, beginning at day 14 p.i. and continuing throughout the infection. the MFI of CXCR4 on ASC did not differ between WT and CD19/ mice. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were also similar between the groups. frequencies were similar to those in WT mice by days 14 and 21. 60% of B220+ B cells were IgD+ in both groups at days 7 and 14. the severe deficit in virus-specific ASC and antiviral IgG2a predicted loss of virus control during the persistent phase of infection. the infectious virus load in the CNS of CD19/ mice was similar to and even lower than that in WT mice at days 7 and 14 p.i. but it remained detectable between days 14 and 28 p.i. in the absence of CD19. at day 21 p.i., IFN- mRNA levels were significantly elevated in both brains and spinal cords of CD19/ mice. these results indicated that an elevated viral load triggers retained or reemerging T cells to produce IFN- and exert antiviral activity. infectious virus within the brains of WT and CD19/ mice. transcript levels of the lymphoid chemokine CXCL13, which regulates migration of IL-21-expressing CXCR5+ T cells, were also notably elevated at day 28 p.i. in the CNS of CD19/ mice. compared to WT mice, mRNA levels were consistently elevated in both brains and spinal cords. CD19 deficiency abrogates peripheral GC formation following CNS infection. CD19 deficiency abrogates peripheral GC formation following CNS infection. retriggering of T cell activity by elevated virus replication in settings of impaired humoral immunity. WT mice were initially compared for GC formation in CLN. defined structures of GL7+ B220+ B cells started to form at day 14 p.i. GL7+ cells were very sparse and scattered at day 21 p.i. bar graph shows percentages of GL7+ pixels per frame from 2 to 3 frames per mouse from 2 to 6 mice per time point. data represent mean and SEM of 2 to 4 individual mice per time point per group from 4 separate experiments. GC B cells are characterized by upregulation of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), an enzyme required for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination to increase Ab diversity and affinity. in infected WT mice, the progressive increase of aicda mRNA levels from days 7 to 21 p.i. correlated with GC formation and maturation. the chemokine receptor CXCR5 is upregulated on B cells migrating to and forming GCs (15, 41) it is also highly expressed by TFH cells, which are essential for GC formation and maintenance. differences reached statistical significance only at day 21 p.i. CD19 deficiency does not impair expression of factors promoting GC formation within CLN. CLN harvested from infected WT and CD19/ mice at indicated times p.i. were analyzed for mRNA expression levels of Cxcl13, Ccl19, Ccl21, Cxcr5, Il-21, Tnfsf13b (BAFF), and complement C3. Virus-specific IgG2a was induced in both mouse groups by day 7 p.i. and increased by day 14 p.i. however, the levels were lower in the absence of CD19, reaching 3 log10 relative to 4 to 4.5 log10 units in WT mice. representative wells are shown for CLN at day 14 and BM at day 21 p.i. the data represent the means and SEM of individual mice. differences between time points within the same group are indicated. CD19 deficiency severely diminishes peripheral ASC expansion following CNS infection. impaired virus-specific ASC and serum responses as early as day 7 p.i. were consistent with a defect in early activation. overall ASC expansion in CLN was monitored by flow cytometry using CD138 as a phenotypic marker. pooled CLN cells from infected WT and CD19/ mice were stained for B220 and the ASC marker CD138. the numbers represent percentages of CD138+ B220+ ASC among total cells. virus-specific ASC frequencies were significantly higher in spinal cords than in brains in WT mice at days 21 and 28 p.i., consistent with their preferential accumulation at the site of persistence and elevated inflammation. differences between ASC frequencies were therefore especially pronounced in spinal cords, amounting to an almost 10-fold disparity. individual titers from 2 to 6 mice per group per time point from 2 separate experiments are denoted by asterisks: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. CD19 deficiency affected overall ASC CNS migration independent of specificity. the mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) of CXCR3+ were similar in WT and CD19/ ASC. these data suggest there is no inherent deficit in the ability of CD19/ ASC to express CXCR3. interactions with its ligand, CXCL12, are important in mediating ASC homing to, and retention within the BM. CD19 deficiency affects overall B cell recruitment using CD45hi and B220 as expression markers of infiltrating B cells. no differences in total CNS cell yields or frequencies of CD45hi infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were also similar between the groups. the data represent the means and SEM of individual mice from 2 separate experiments, each comprising 2 to 4 individual mice per time point and group. the severe deficit in virus-specific ASC and antiviral IgG2a in the CNS of CD19/ mice predicted loss of virus control during the persistent phase of infection. the infectious virus load in the CNS of CD19/ mice was similar to and even lower than that in WT mice at days 7 and 14 p.i. cells did not increase in the CNS during persistence in CD19/ mice. we assessed reemergence of T cell effector activity to explain partial ongoing viral control during persistence. transcripts peaked to similar levels at day 7 p.i. in both the brains and spinal cords of CD19/ and WT mice. both brains and spinal cords were temporally screened for expression of factors associated with increased T cell function. IL-21 enhances B cell differentiation in CLN, but also enhances and prolongs CD8 T cell function within the CNS (10) CCL19 mRNA was consistently elevated in brains of CD19/ mice. CCL21 mRNA levels were vastly increased at basal levels in the CNS of CD19/ mice but remained unaltered by infection, similar to naive WT mice. herpes simplex viruses and japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are characterized by intrathecal Ab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consistent with local ASC (2, 56\u201359). overall Ab detection is more transient in cases of acute encephalitis but persists during chronic disease. despite induction of virus-specific serum IgG and neutralizing Ab, both IgM and IgG responses were overall reduced and not sustained. reduced anti-virus serum Ab, lower virus-specific ASC, and very scant accumulation of IgG ASC in BM are consistent with less differentiation and longevity of isotype-switched CD19/ ASC. CXCL13/ mice exhibit normal lymphoid architecture with intact B cell follicles. absence of CD19 leads to more severely impaired generation of protective ASC during JHMV infection than in CXCL13/ mice. in vitro stimulation to assess virus specificity provided no evidence for these early B cells as precursors of ASC (83). the nature of signals driving IgD+ B cells to the CNS during infection, as well as their role, thus remains to be determined but likely involves toll-like receptor (TLR)-driven signals. CD19/ mice did not exhibit increased clinical symptoms or disability at day 28.p.i.. possible explanations reside in CCR7-mediated restraint of T cell function to perivascular spaces and elevated protective IL-10. male mice were housed at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute under pathogen-free conditions. all animal procedures were executed in accordance with guidelines approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using MMLV reverse transcriptase. 7500 fast real-time PCR system used for transcripts encoding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL; TNFSF13; TNFSF13), IL-21, CXCL9, CXCL10, viral nucleocapsid. transcript levels were calculated relative to the GAPDH housekeeping gene. cell surface expression of CXCR5 was determined by staining with biotin rat anti-mouse CXCR5 MAb and streptavidin phycoerythrin. cells were then washed with FACS buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer. titers are expressed as the log of the highest dilution with an optical density value exceeding 3 standard deviations above the mean background. titers represent the log of the highest average serum dilution that inhibited cytopathic effect. the plates were incubated for 16 h at 4\u00b0C, washed with washing buffer, and incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 25\u00b0C. after washes with washing buffer and 1 PBS, diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution was added to visualize spots. the sections were mounted with Vectashield Hard Set mounting medium with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and examined using a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA) statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 6 software. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using a 1:1 mixture of oligo(dT) primers and random primers. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using a 7500 fast real-time PCR system. mononuclear cell isolation and flow cytometric analysis were calculated. cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer. gen (GL7) (all from BD Pharmingen), CD8 (53-6.7) and PD-1 (RMP1-30) (both from eBioscience) cell surface expression of CXCR5 was determined via staining with biotin rat anti-mouse CXCR5 MAb and streptavidin phycoerythrin (both from BD Bioscience) the cells were then washed with FACS buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde sterile, white 96-well filter plates with 0.45-m-pore-size hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were stripped with 70% ethanol for 2 min, washed with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, and coated with either polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml or undiluted virus supernatant for approximately 16 h at 4 threshold criterion for spot size was defined as between 0.0009 and 0.2257 mm2. slides were fixed with ice-cold 70% acetone for 5 min. sections were stained with rat anti-mouse B220 MAb (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-mouse CD3 polyclonal Ab (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated"}
