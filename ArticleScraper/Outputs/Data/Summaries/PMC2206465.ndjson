{"summary": "the biggest challenge in planning for an influenza pandemic is the range of unknown factors. the biggest challenge is the range of unknown factors; its nature and impact cannot be fully predicted until the pandemic virus actually emerges. the base scenario assumes a clinical attack rate of 25% and a case fatality rate of 0.37%. patients with influenza would represent 208% of combined level 2 (high-dependency unit) and level 3 (ICU) bed capacity, and 231% of current level 3 capacity. occupancy of level 3 beds by 'flu patients' was unsustainable at approximately 50% in terms of care for other patients even in most optimistic conditions. the next pandemic derives from the H5N1 strain. the epidemiological evidence to date suggests extremely high mortality. both will undermine the ability to deliver critical care to critically ill patients even before consideration is given to the duty of care to others. the expansion of ICU capacity to provide critical care in other areas will require the pre-emptive identification, tracing and maintenance of all usable equipment. it is likely that there will be some variability in the prevalence of influenza across the country during a pandemic wave, with peaks in demand staggered across geographical areas. neuraminidase inhibitors may make focussed chemoprophylaxis a strategy for reducing staff illness in critical care areas. it is likely that these services will rapidly reach their capacity and even their contingency arrangements for extended facilities will be overwhelmed. there is a legitimate debate about how limited capacity can best be utilised, but a number of themes are recurrent. the higher ethical principle of 'wellness of society as a whole' allows for the direction of resources to those where it is felt most effective. it may also allow for an expansion in the scope of practice of non-physicians. a number of scoring systems have been advocated for use in a pandemic. 10/32 scored CURB-65 1 or 2 amongst ICU admissions with community-acquired pneumonia in 1996 to 1997. 5/32 were classified as PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) class III. only 90.5% were PSI class IV or V, and 70.3% had a CURB-65 score of 3 or above. emergency medicine community and the u.s. administration recognised the utilitarian principle. a triage protocol for critical care is based on data collected at hospital admission. if review by experienced critical care physicians is impractical, decision support will be required. a SOFA score of over 15 was 98.9% specific for mortality. other critical care scoring systems show comparable performance in mortality prediction. discrimination as measured by area under Receiver Operator Characteristic curve was 0.825 to 0.901. the time may come when we need realistically to evaluate the effectiveness of critical care in influenza. if survival with the benefit of critical care is marginal (for example, 10%) and there is a significant cross-infection risk, perhaps critical care should close and concentrate its efforts on outreach."}
