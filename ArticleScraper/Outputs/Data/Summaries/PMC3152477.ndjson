{"summary": "hepatic, splenic, bone marrow, and nodal iron accumulation is exploited at organ-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the biodynamics of iron oxide nanoparticles vary depending on particle diameter. mean particle diameters and iron concentrations of USPIO and SPIO were 30 nm and 56 mg/mL and 57 nm and 28 mg/mL respectively. average diameter of the magnetic core was the same (5 nm) in both particle types. iron oxide core of both particle types was coated with dextran. in a single field of view (magnification 200) of three different lesions for each histological section were measured using Image-Pro\u00ae Plus software. differences in the uptake of USPIO and SPIO in murine tissues and the uptake of iron by cultured cells were determined with the one-tailed Student\u2019s t. 0.05 was considered statistically significant. iron oxide nanoparticles were studied in vivo and in vivo. ages were immunohistochemically stained with F4/80. areas stained with Prussian blue were measured using image-pro\u00ae Plus software. phagocytosis of USPIO and SPIO was measured by cultured cells. iron-positive areas in the liver were larger in the mice injected with USPIO than those injected with SPIO at almost all time points except the last one. iron-positive areas in the liver were larger in the mice injected with USPIO than those injected with SPIO. iron-positive areas were significantly larger in mice treated with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) at 30 minutes, 1, and 24 hours after intraperitoneal injection, iron-positive areas were significantly larger in mice injected with USPIO. iron-positive areas were significantly larger in mice intraperitoneally injected with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) than with small superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) at 30 minutes, 1, 3, and 24 hours. mice with respect to the spleen manifested no significant iron deposits in organs other than the spleen. the amount of intracellular iron measured by atomic absorption photometry was significantly higher in cells treated with SPIO than with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide. histological study of mouse liver specimens stained with Prussian blue (magnification 200) iron-positive areas were significantly larger in mice treated with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) than with small superparamagnetic iron oxide. iron-positive areas were significantly larger in mice intraperitoneally injected with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide. at 30 minutes, 1, 3, and 24 hours the iron-positive areas were significantly larger in mice injected with USPIO (P 0.05) intracellular iron was significantly higher in cells treated with small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) than with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) there was no significant accumulation in the heart, great vessels, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract. a greater amount of USPIO than SPIO tended to be distributed to the lung parenchyma around the airway. there was no significant difference in lymph node accumulation between the two groups of mice. the early distribution of intraperitoneally injected USPIO to the liver is attributable to differences in the absorption route. parasternal and intercostal-paravertebral lymph ducts pass through iliac, renal, splenic, posterior gastric, portal, superior mesenteric, and cisternal lymph nodes. in the latter network it passes through more distal (eg, parathymic) and left and right posterior mediastinal lymph nodes. the IP delivery of USPIO and SPIO might be useful as a contrast agent for the study of lymph nodes in a clinical setting. the authors suggest that intraperitoneally injected iron particles may be very useful for getting Kupffer images of the liver and lymph nodes."}
