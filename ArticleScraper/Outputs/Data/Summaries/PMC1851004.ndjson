{"summary": "RT-PCR was used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV in 934 sera and self-collected throat washes and fecal samples from 271 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS managed at a single institution. fecal samples were frequently SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive beyond 40 days, and occasional sera still had SARS-CoV detected after 3 weeks of illness. 304 patients fitting the case definition of probable SARS were hospitalized between March 26-May 31 2003. 92 (33.9%) healthcare workers who acquired SARS, including 51 nurses, 30 physicians, 5 logistics staff, 3 pharmacists and 2 laboratory technicians. 62 cases were household contacts of known SARS cases. total of 31.3% (192/614) of sera had detectable amounts of SARS-CoV RNA detected. viral loads ranging from 101-103 copies/ml serum were more likely to be RT-PCR positive (54%) than later in the disease course. 224 stool samples self-collected by 188 patients (1\u20132 samples each), 127 (56.7%) had SARS-CoV RNA detected by RT-PCR. fecal samples collected 40 days or more after onset contained SARS-CoV RNA in 29.8% (17/57) of samples. 60% of patients with clinical SARS had a positive RT-PCR in one or more clinical specimens, with the highest detection rates in sputum (55.6%), NPAs (29.6%) and nose/throat swabs (20%) in the first 9 days of illness. RT-PCR was positive in 37.5% of probable SARS cases, reaching 50\u201360% on days 7\u201310. serum SARS-CoV RT-PCR is a useful investigation early in the illness. 50% of sera had SARS-CoV detected in the first four days of illness. fecal samples collected after 40 days were higher than peak load. 80% in stools collected 11\u201316 days after onset have been reported elsewhere, as have fecal samples positive 40 days or more after onset. despite the high SARS-CoV load in feces, diarrhea was not a prominent clinical feature in this cohort. respiratory tract samples are the sample of choice for suspected respiratory viral infections. patient self-collected specimens may be less appropriate for common seasonal respiratory virus infections such as influenza. this sampling approach may reduce the safety issues of healthcare workers collecting NPAs. five ml of the throat wash was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. 5 ml of 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. RNA was extracted from the remaining 100\u2013300 l of the throat wash. the PCR assay was negative when performed on RNA or DNA extracted from influenza A and B, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus isolates. manipulations were carried out in a BSL2 facility with BSL3 practices. SARS-CoV isolation was not attempted on clinical samples during the outbreak due to safety concerns."}
