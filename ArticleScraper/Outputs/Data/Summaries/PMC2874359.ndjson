{"summary": "a total of 1,172 fecal samples were collected from dogs with acute enteritis in 14 european countries. some samples were retrieved from previous studies (7,16\u201318), whereas the remaining samples were sent to our laboratory (from veterinarians, breeders, or other researchers) for routine diagnostic investigations. the thermal profile consisted of reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 20 min, activation of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 48\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. the thermal profile consisted of reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 20 min, activation of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 2 min.
