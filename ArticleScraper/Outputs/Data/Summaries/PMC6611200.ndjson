{"summary": "OBJECTIVES: clinical, clinical and laboratory changes and outcomes of viral pneumonia caused by influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections. a retrospective cohort study screened all patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia during the period from January 2012 to December 2015. a total of 448 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia were included. a retrospective analysis of a cohort of viral pneumonia cases presented to PSMMC between January 2012 and December 2015 was done. the patients were included if they had positive respiratory virus panel for MERS-CoV or influenza. the study included adult patients over 18 years of age whether managed as in- or out-patients. 448 confirmed viral pneumonia patients were included in the analysis. of those, 216 (48.2%) cases were infected with influenza A non-H1N1/influenza B, 150 (33.5%) with H1N1 and 82 (18.3%) with MERS-CoV. year of infection 2012 77 (17.2) 40 (18.51) 36 (24) 1 (1.21) 0.0001 2013 78 (17.7) 57 (26.3) 7 (4.66) 14 (17.07) 2014 114 (25.4) 54 (25) 24 (16.0) 36 (43.90) 2015 179 (40.0) 65 (30) 83 (55.3) 31 (37.80) Symptoms Cough 357 (84.4) 174 (80.5) 129 (59.7) 54 (65.9) 0.001 Hypo influenza A non-H1N1 in 2014, H1N1 in 2015, and MERS-Cov in 2014 and 2015. incidence of viral pneumonia was highest between October and December followed by January\u2013March. bilateral lung findings on chest X-ray were more frequent among MERS-CoV (94.1%) and H1N1 (86.7%) cases. the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.25). patients infected with MERS-CoV were significantly more likely to die compared to others. 59.7% vs. 17.7% in H1N1, 14.5% in Influenza A (non-H1N1), and 8.1% in influenza B. 0.0001 HTN 49 (79.0) 163 (42.4) 4.6 0.0001 DM 41 (66.1) 151 (39.3) 2.7 0.001 Stroke 12 (19.4) 20 (5.2) 4.7 0.0001 Liver disease 3 (4.8) 12 (3.1) 1.5 0.55 MERS-CoV 37 (59.8) 44 (11.4) 11.4 0.000 *Data are presented by n (%) pneumonia caused by MERS-CoV-infection was more prevalent among older patients. in this cohort, males were more likely to be infected. this is consistent with a similar finding reported by others. the most common radiological finding in this study was bilateral lung infiltrate. the pattern of interstitial infiltrates with patchy distribution on chest radiograph was sometimes useful in differentiating viral from bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. the risk of mortality was found to progressively increase among cases with multiple comorbidities. the presence of pre-existing lung disease was not found to affect the outcome in our study. despite its retrospective nature, the data emerged from a single center might not reflect the whole spectrum of the disease. financial support and sponsorship Nil.
