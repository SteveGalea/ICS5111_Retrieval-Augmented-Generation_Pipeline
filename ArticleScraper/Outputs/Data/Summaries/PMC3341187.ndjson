{"summary": "PCV genomes have relatively much lower content of GC and codon preference. the results of the correspondence analysis indicate codon usage patterns of PCV of various genotypes, various subgenotypes changed greatly. genetic information is transmitted from mRNA to protein in a mode of triplet codon. each amino acid matches with at least one codon, at most six codons. the codons encoding the same amino acid is called synonymous codon. some species or some genes are usually prone to use one or several particular synonymous codons. ORF2 has smaller selective pressure than ORF1 and more mutation. similarity between nucleotide sequences from different strains is less than 80%. so far, studies have not related to usage of PCV codons. PCV genome has lower GC%, from 48.35% to 49.12%, with an average content of 48.61% and an SD value of 0.19. however, the phenomenon suggests that content of G or C as the end base of codons has effect on usage pattern of synonymous codons.

PCV genotype II have high similarities with swine than PCV genotype I. the synonymous codon containing the CpG were inhibited because of CpG was present at the expected frequencies. low RSCU values were present in 7 of all 8 codon containing the CpG and they are all not preferentially used codons. a plot of the f'1 and the f'1 of each virus of Circoviridae was shown in Figure 5. there were considerable differences for codon usage patterns among PCV, DCV, GCV, CoCV, CAV and BFDV. however, differences of synonymous codon usage pattern still exist between each virus. three-dimension mesh plot of correspondence analysis value of 59 synonymous codons in PCV. it can be seen from the plot, change range on the Z axis(f'1)s from 15 to 2.5, which indicates that synonymous codon usage in the PCV genome is not balanced. among all the 59 synonymous codons, a part of codon is rarely used, while others have higher usage frequency. the relative synonymous codon usage frequency (RSCU) of PCV and swine AAa Codon SUSb PCV Leu UUA 0.65 0.957 Tyr UAU 1.12 0.964 UUG 0.85 1.372 UAC 0.82 1.036 CUU 1.20 0.912 His CAU 0.97 1.078 CUC 1.12 0.761 CAC 1.03 0.921 CUA 0.56 0.465 Gln CAA 0.85 0.933 CUG 1.62 1.528 1.00 0.812 GCA 1.05 1.118 UCG 0.31 0.419 GCG 0.37 1.153 Phe UUU 1.11 1.402 UUC 0.89 0.597 a AA is the abbreviation of Amino Acid. a AA is the abbreviation of amino acid. b SUS is swine. 41 55.97 -0.221771 0.132841 9 24.50 26.89 28.99 19.61 19.96 31.60 28.20 20.00 48.61 48.20 56.16 -0.184256 0.108997 10 25.57 25.90 28.11 20.24 26.48 24.60 27.70 20.00 48.53 47.70 57.36 -0.188909 0.100179 11 25.62 25.90 28.00 28.84 24.44 25.00 20 20.02 48.42 51.22 55.53 -0.219601 0.117967 20 25.92 25.30 27.50 21.28 25.29 25.0 27.80 20.00 48.78 47.80 58.67 0.044658 0.084063 21 25.35 25.98 28.30 20.73 24.95 25.10 22.80 20.00 48.67 42.80 57.64 0.096485 0.093146 22 25.41 25.69 28 the correlation analysis between f'1,f'2 value and A%, U%, G%,C%, GC%, GC3% and U3%, G3%, GC3% was compared with correlation analysis. the correlation analysis between f'1,f'2 value and A%, U%, G%,C%, GC%, GC3% and U3%, G3%, GC3% was analyzed. b f'1 and f'2 represent the values of the first and the second axis of each gene in CA.

PCV is divided into two genotypes, PCV genotype I and PCV genotype II, of which PCV genotype II includes various subtypes. the results in this study also reveal that geological factor may almost have relation with codon usage. each general nucleotide composition (T%,A%,C% and G%) and each nucleotide composition in the third site of codon (T3%,A3%,C3% and G3%) in PCV coding sequence were calculated by biosoftware DNAStar7.0 for windows.
