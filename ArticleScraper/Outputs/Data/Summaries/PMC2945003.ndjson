{"summary": "genome projects of the last decade have uncovered an overwhelming amount of sequence data. a comparison of sequences for evolutionary insight is best achieved by looking at the structural and functional (sub)units of proteins, the protein domains. protein domains can usually fold independently, likely due to their relatively limited size. berg.de Superfamily http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/hmm.html Structural analysis CATH http://www.cathdb.info/latest/index.html SCOP http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/ SSM http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm evolution is believed to form and mold genomes largely via three mechanisms, namely i) chemical changes through the incorporation of base analogs, the effects of radiation or random enzymatic errors by polymerases, ii) cellular repair processes that counter mutations, and iii) selection pressures that manifest themselves as the positive or negative influence that determines whether the mutation will be present in subsequent generations. fast algorithms for pair-wise alignments can be found in the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), whereas multiple sequence alignments (MSAs, Fig. 1A) are commonly created with for example ClustalX and MUSCLE (see Table 1) [31-34]. commonly used phylogenetic analysis strategies are listed in Table 1. a limitation of all inferred phylogenetic data is that it is directly dependent on the alignment and less so on the programs used to build the phylogenetic tree. software has been developed that combines the alignment procedure and phylogenetic analysis iteratively in one single program. a limited number of amino acids may account for most of the free-energy change that occurs upon binding. binding specificities may therefore arise through mutations at these hot spots. the folding of a domain is essentially based on a complex network of inter-molecular interactions in time [49] DOMAIN DUPLICATION Through selective mutation, protein domains have been the tools of evolution to create an enormous and diverse assembly of proteins from likely an initially relatively limited set of domains. currently > 1700 domain superfamilies are recognized in the recent release of the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) the number of domains per gene, the so-called modularity, is related to genome size via a power-law. the multi-domain architecture is essentially the relation between frequency f and an occurrence x raised by a scaling constant k (i.e., f (x) xk. a similar correlation is found when the multi-domain architecture is compared to the number of cell types present in an organism. abundant domains have been shown to accumulate non-linearly in relation to the overall number of domains encoded or the genome size. a reoccurring theme among these abundant domains is the function of protein-protein interaction. this positive relation is underlined by the association of these abundant domains with disease such as cancer and gene essentiality. non-promiscuous domains can easily evade selection pressure by obtaining compensatory mutations within themselves or their specific binding partner. a rationale for the increase in interactions and functional subunits may derive from the paradoxical absence of correlation between the number of genes encoded and organism complexity. new methods are being developed to take into account that when sequences evolve, their close and distant functional relationships evolve in parallel. a gene duplication or domain duplication implies the addition of a node, while the deletion of a gene or domain reduces the amount of links in the network. the evolution of protein networks is tightly coupled to the addition or deletion of nodes. microarray studies are now well under way to map genome-wide expression levels of related and non-related genes under a variety of conditions. for example, transcriptional comparisons have investigated aging [106] and pathogenicity [107]. however, such comparisons can only be performed under strictly controlled research conditions. large-scale expression studies are beginning to show evolutionary correlations between gene expression levels and timings. others demonstrate spatial differences between paralogs or (partial) overlap between interaction partners [117-120]."}
