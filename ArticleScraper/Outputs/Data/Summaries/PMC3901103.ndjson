{"summary": "ELISPOT has found wide use because it is simple, reliable, sensitive, quantitative, and efficient in cell utilization [10,12,13]. ELISPOT technology permits enumeration of individual antigen-specific T cells through the detection of their secretory products such as the antigen-triggered release of interferon gamma (IFN-) dual color ELISPOT assays allow the measurement of cytokine coexpression in individual T cells with the same sensitivity as ICS. however, low frequency responses that are difficult to detect by ICS can be readily detected by dual color ELISPOT [22] ELISPOT needs less PBMC than flow cytometry-based assays. the resting strategy has been readily embraced and recommended by some immune monitoring panels. it is assumed that during the resting period apoptotic PBMC contained within the thawed PBMC die leaving a higher frequency of viable, functional cells for the assay. newly isolated PBMC and cryopreserved PBMC were shown to be identical for non-cryopreserved \u201cex vivo\u201d and cryopreserved PBMC without resting. this equal performance of non-cryopreserved \u201cex vivo\u201d and of cryopreserved PBMC was seen without resting when the cells were plated into the assay right after thawing. freshly thawed non-rested (fresh) PBMC show equal performance to non-cryopreserved ex vivo PBMC. ELISPOT assay results can be used to test the impact of resting in ELISPOT. ePBMC donors were randomly selected from the ePBMC donor library provided by Cellular Technology Limited (CTL), Shaker Heights, OH, USA. the PBMC were tested \u201cfresh\u201d for reactivity to CEF peptide pool, and to mumps antigen. for both antigens, the response levels ranged from undetectable to high. donors that showed a high response level to CEF responded vigorously to some others of the over 30 antigens for which all PBMC were tested. ePBMC data base consists of a large selection of precharacterized PBMC samples with established HLA types and antigen reactivities. 11 of the 25 donors qualified as low responders to the CEF peptide pool. one batch was plated into the ELISPOT assay within 1 h of thawing. the other batch was incubated for 20 h at 37 \u00b0C before plating into the ELISPOT assay. non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare matched fresh vs. rested responses with a p-value 0.05 being considered significant. 12 of the 20 donors qualified as low responders for mumps antigen reactivity using the 50 SFU per million PBMC as the cut-off criterion. s PBMC donors responding to antigen stimulation with more than 50 SFU per million PBMC were defined as high responders. with the exception of one donor for whom the increase was slightly more than two fold, the increase for all other donors was less than two fold. in measuring CD4 responses directed against mumps among the high responders, resting had no significant benefit. if a donor tested \u201cfresh\u201d as high or low responder to CEF or mumps in the first experiment, the same response level reproduced in the repeat experiment for both antigens. the inter-assay variation for the freshly thawed samples was not significant. if resting resulted in a moderate gain in the CEF response in the first experiment, it was also not evident in the repeat experiment. acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining was used to distinguish between live and dead cells. losses were seen for all but one of the 25 PBMC samples. overall losses occurred at a similar rate, with about half of the cells lost after resting. flow cytometry used flow cytometry to monitor potential changes in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets following resting. however, slight increases/decreases in frequencies of CD4 cells after resting did not result in a proportional increase/decrease in the mumps recall response. resting does not predictably have such an impact on low responders. for the low responders, rested samples could provide decreased antigen-induced spot counts. we tested the hypothesis that the desired increase in signal-to-noise performance of the PBMC can be accomplished simply by increasing the numbers of freshly thawed PBMC plated into the ELISPOT assay. the PBMC were plated in serial dilution with antigen (closed symbols) or without (medium alone, open symbols) keeping all other assay variables constant. the regression for antigen-induced SFU was calculated and is shown. results were compared between thirteen centers in which \"ELISPOT analysis was performed according to 11 more or less different protocols\" resting caused a predictable gain in assay sensitivity for CD8 responses of high-magnitude alone. this gain was on average less than two-fold, and might have limited significance in immune diagnostic terms. resting is likely to benefit T cell monitoring if the number of apoptotic cells is high in thawed samples. the number of apoptotic cells might be high if the PBMC were not frozen or thawed under optimized conditions. resting might help to rescue a result, but for successful T cell work attention should be drawn to optimized freezing and thawing conditions. apoptotic cells can be selectively stained by dyes such as Jo-Pro. it is not well established whether apoptotic cells are just non-functional bystander cells. apoptosis is an intrinsically non-phlogistic process. resting might be of benefit if the serum contains immune suppressive factors. for IFN- assays, for example, IL-2 is a potent stimulator of IFN- production in macrophages, NK and dendritic cells. PBMC are cryopreserved and thawed according to protocols that we have established. the frequencies measured in freshly isolated PBMC \u201cex vivo\u201d and in the thawed PBMC were shown to be identical for CD4 and CD8 cells [15]. this equal performance of non-cryopreserved \u201cex vivo\u201d and of cryopreserved PBMC was seen without resting when the cells were plated into the assay freshly thawed non-rested (fresh) PBMC show equal performance to non-cryopreserved ex vivo PBMC. a basic assumption of this paper is that \u201covernight resting\u201d reliably improve ELISPOT assay performance. nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare matched ex vivo vs. fresh responses with a p-value 0.05 being considered significant. ePBMC donors were randomly selected from the ePBMC donor library provided by Cellular Technology Limited (CTL), Shaker Heights, OH, USA. donors that displayed a high response level to CEF and mumps antigens were not linked. donors that displayed a high response level to both antigens responded vigorously to some others of the over 30 antigens for which all PBMC were tested. this reflects low frequency of CEF or mumps antigen-reactive T cells in the respective PBMC donor. 11 of the 25 donors qualified as low responders to the CEF peptide pool. PBMC of these donors was thawed and split in two batches. one batch was plated into the ELISPOT assay within 1 h of thawing. the other batch was incubated for 20 h at 37 \u00b0C before plating into the ELISPOT assay. non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare matched fresh vs. rested responses with a p-value 0.05 being considered significant. for each sample, fresh or rested, the medium background was less than 10 spots per well. resting of Cryopreserved PBMC from high-responders Augments CEF- resulted in increased SFU counts. for eight of nine CEF high responders resting resulted in increased SFU counts. with the exception of one donor for whom the increase was slightly more than two fold, the increase for all other donors was less than two fold. if a donor tested \u201cfresh\u201d as high or low responder to both CEF and mumps in the first experiment, the same response level reproduced in the repeat experiment for both antigens. the inter-assay variation for the freshly thawed samples was not significant. if resting resulted in a moderate gain in the CEF response in the first experiment, it was also not evident in the repeat experiment. acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining was used to distinguish between live and dead cells. losses were seen for all but one of the 25 PBMC samples. overall losses occurred at a similar rate, with about half of the cells lost after resting. increased responses to CEF in conjunction with decreased mumps responses after resting may result from more rapid dying off of CD4 cells. flow cytometry did not show any statistically significant changes in CD8+ or CD4+ T cell subsets due to resting. however, slight increases/decreases in frequencies of CD4 cells after resting did not result in a proportional increase/decrease in mumps recall response. resting is presumed to improve signal-to-noise performance of ELISPOT assays. we plated unrested PBMC in two-fold serial dilutions. we tested the hypothesis that the desired increase in signal-to-noise performance of the PBMC can be accomplished simply by increasing the numbers of freshly thawed PBMC plated into the ELISPOT assay. this linear relationship between the numbers of freshly thawed PB PBMC were plated in serial dilution with antigen (closed symbols) or without (medium alone, open symbols) keeping all other assay variables constant. the regression for antigen-induced SFU was calculated and is shown. of 7 donors were tested for reactivity to CMV and flu peptides of which three possessed CMV-specific CD8 cells, and five responded to the flu peptides. results were compared between thirteen centers in which \u201cELISPOT analysis was performed according to 11 more or less different protocols\u201d and the influence of different parameters on the number of positive responses. resting is likely to benefit T cell monitoring if the number of apoptotic cells is high in thawed samples. the number of apoptotic cells might be high if the PBMC were not frozen or thawed under optimized conditions. PBMC of healthy donors should yield more than 95% viable, and less than 5% apoptotic/dead cells. apoptotic cells can be selectively stained by dyes such as Jo-Pro. it is not well established whether apoptotic cells are just non-functional bystander cells. apoptosis is an intrinsically non-phlogistic process. the presence of cells undergoing apoptosis in PBMC affects T cells in functional assays such as ELISPOT or ICS. resting might also benefit if the serum contains cytokines that stimulate cells of the innate immune system to produce the analyte. polyclonal stimulation with SEB or PHA can also serve as a reference standard/positive control. spot morphology induced by polyclonal stimulators is fundamentally different from spots elicited by antigens. the cryovials were placed for 8 minutes into a 37 \u00b0C bead bath. PBMC were washed twice in 10 mL CTL-TestTM Medium (CTLT-005) and resuspended at a final concentration of 3 106 PBMC/mL in the same medium. cells were plated onto an ELISPOT assay plate within 1 h of thawing. the thawed PBMC were adjusted in CTL Test Medium to 3 million PBMC/mL of which 100 L/well (300,000 cells/well) were plated per well using wide-bore pipette tips. plates were air dried in a laminar flow hood prior to analysis. the comparisons of matched pre- and post-thawing SFU were tested by a two-tailed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. a p-value of 0.05 or less (two-tailed) was considered significant. a p-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant. the cryovials were rinsed using a wide-bore 2 mL pipette and transferred into a 15 mL V bottom tube. the cryovials were rinsed using 1 mL 37 \u00b0C warm CTL Anti-Aggregate WashTM Medium (CTL-AA-005) that contains benzonase. the antigens, CEF peptide pool (CTL-CEF-002; 2 g/mL) or mumps antigen (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA, Lot# IV0094, 1:80 dilution) were plated first in triplicates to the capture antibody pre-coated assay plate in a final volume of 100 L per well. the thawed PBMC were adjusted in CTL Test Medium to 3 million 500,000 cells were stained in 5 mL Falcon round-bottom tubes with human anti-CD3FITC (clone HIT3a), and CD4PE (clone RPA-T4) and fixed in 2% formaldehyde. a minimum of 200,000 events were acquired using BD FACSCanto III. resting relative to the T cell frequencies ex vivo, to potentially missing positive responses due to substantial cell losses, to the added labor and complexity of the protocol, investigators are well advised to establish whether resting indeed will benefit immune monitoring in their particular population."}
