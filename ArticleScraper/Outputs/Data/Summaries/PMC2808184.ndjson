{"summary": "a powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. however, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, and in the past the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis. the most direct experimental method to accurately define an epitope is to determine the 3D structure of the antibody-antigen complex by X-ray crystallography11\u20135 however these methods are time-consuming and need purified protein complexes. an alternative approach makes use of screening biological peptide libraries with antibodies to identify peptides that mimic conformational epitopes. episearch is based on a patch analysis that identifies spatial contiguous clusters of residues on the surface of the antigen. similarity of residues is measured by a physical-chemical property distance that was derived from five descriptors of amino acid residues. highest-scoring patch of EpiSearch was found in all the test cases overlapping with the experimentally observed conformational epitopes. the input of EpiSearch uses the set of M sequences from phage display experiments (labeled j = 1,..., M) that mimic the surface residues of an antibody binding sites. frequency distributions of residues for these peptide sequences are stored in a matrix mat1 (M, 20) with M rows and 20 columns. a decrease in patch size may predict a smaller number of residues. we calculated the property distance PD (A, B) of residues A in the peptide sequences and residues B in each patch as: P D ( A, B ) = i i ( E i ( A ) E i ( B ) 2 (1). patch k with the maximum number of matching residues for a given peptide j. we select only patches as potential candidates for conformational epitopes. the final score, Scorek, of each selected patch k is then calculated as the average over all M peptides. the solvent accessible surface area of each residue is calculated by GetArea26. a residue is considered solvent exposed if its solvent accessible surface area is greater than 102 otherwise the residues are considered as buried in the protein. we used a cutoff value of PD = 8.0 as the criterion to have matching residues between phage display sequences and surface patches. the number of matching residues in each peptide j and patch k are then stored in a new matrix X j k. defined conformational epitope derived from the X-ray structure of the antibody-antigen complex A residue is considered as part of the observed epitope in the X-ray crystal-structure of the antibody-antigen complex. the residue changes its solvent accessible surface area by more than 102 in complex formation. highest score (0.910) was found with the center at residue C565, and the second highest score was found centered at residue C214 (Score: 0.882) the individual score profiles for all 5 peptides are shown in a close-up view in Figure 2B and Figure 2C. patches at the third and fourth rank were found at K569 with a score 0.774 and at Y568 (Score: 0.766) overlapping with the patch at C565. both patches share a large fraction of amino acids present in the input peptide sequences. this patch is also predicted as one of the top rank cluster in Mapitope analysis. residue R2220 is completely buried at the Fab interface and forms a salt bridge with the residue D102 on the Fab Bo2C11. other three patches predicted by EpiSearch method are centered on the residues P2205 (Score: 0.881), E2228 (Score: 0.804) and Y2195 (Score: 0.769) the episearch method correctly predicted the residues N280, A281, K282, R469, T455, G472, and M475 as part of the conformational epitope. we also mapped the conformational epitopes of mAb 17b onto the crystal structure of gp12036 using eleven 12-mer cysteine looped peptides. the patch M214 was located in the C-terminal while the patch centered at R100 was located in the N-terminal region of p24. the dimeric structure of the p24 shows a dimer interface between the N-terminal domain of one molecule and the C-terminal domain of two fold related molecule. peptides mapped correctly in the interface region while five mapped in a patch centered at residue L355, a site also predicted by Tarnovitski et al40 on SARS Coronoavirus. peptide sequences satisfying the criteria defined by equation (3) were found in a patch centered at residue F460. the patch with the highest score (0.910) was found with the center at residue C565, and the second highest score was found centered at residue C214 (Score: 0.882). the individual score profiles for all 5 peptides are shown in a close-up view in Figure 2B and Figure 2C. both patches share a large fraction of amino acids present in the input peptide sequences. this patch is also predicted as one of the top rank cluster in Mapitope analysis. mAb Bo2C11 is a human anti FVIII monoclonal antibody. the predicted residues form a large part of the conformational epitope as determined by the X-ray crystal structure of the Bo2C11 mAb-C2 domain. the residue R2220 is completely buried at the Fab interface and forms a salt bridge with the residue D102 on the Fab Bo2C11 while residues H2315 and Q2316 play an important role in polar interactions at the antibody interface. the epiSearch method correctly predicted the residues N280, A281, K282, R469, T455, G472, and M475 as part of the conformational epitope. we also mapped the conformational epitopes of mAb 17b onto the crystal structure of gp12036 using eleven 12-mer cysteine looped peptides. epiSearch method predicted two top scoring patches centered on residues M214 and R100. the patch was located in the C-terminal while the patch centered at R100 was located in the N-terminal region of p24. the dimeric structure of the p24 shows a dimer interface between the N-terminal domain of one molecule and the C-terminal domain of two fold related molecule. ten peptides mapped correctly in the interface region while five mapped in a patch centered at residue L355, a site also predicted by Tarnovitski et al40 on SARS Coronoavirus. all the peptide sequences satisfying the criteria defined by equation (3) were found in a patch centered at residue F460. the constrained loop peptides gave a better result than the analysis performed without the terminal Cys residues. results are shown for the highest scoring patch, for the gp120-mAb 17b complex we also include the data for the second scoring patch. the performance of the PepSurf method was compared with the online version of the PepSurf method (http://pepitope.tau.ac.il/),42 see Table 2. In case of the EpiSearch method all input peptide sequences satisfying equation 2 were mapped on the antigen surface. pepSurf can not accept peptide sequences longer than 14 amino acids. it is generally believed that not all amino acids in a protein interface contribute to the affinity of binding of a protein complex in a uniform way. the peptides selected from the phage display experiment represent discontinuous fragments of amino acids that may not have a high sequence homology to the antigen. a number of computational methods used to identify the epitopes on the antigen structure have been reported earlier. epiSearch method correctly mapped the location of conformation epitopes. however, subtle differences were observed when the input peptide sequences shared a low sequence identity. the average processing time is about one minute. an automated version of the method is freely available online at http://curie.utmb.edu/episearch.html."}
