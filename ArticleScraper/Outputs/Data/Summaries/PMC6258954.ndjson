{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is responsible for the most important viral encephalitis affecting humans. a yearly estimation of 68,000 cases and with a mortality rate of 14% to 21% (1). about 30% to 50% of the surviving encephalitis patients can suffer severe long-term neurological sequelae (2). several species, including macaques, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and squirrel hamsters, are susceptible to oronasal infection with JEV (15\u201317) non-vector-borne transmission has been described for other flaviviruses (18, 19) examples are Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (22, 23), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Bagaza virus (24), Tembusu virus ( porcine nasal mucosa explants and well-differentiated porcine primary nasal epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) RESULTS JEV replicates in porcine nasal mucosa explants. we challenged porcine nasal mucosa explants from four different pig donors. in panel A, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), cilia with anti-tubulin (red), and JEV with anti-E protein 4G2 (green) three-dimensional (3D) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle. porcine NEC cultures were infected with JEV strains at MOI of 0.1 TCID50/cell. after 24, 48, and 72 hpi, inserts were collected and viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system. the experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. in panels A to C, results are represented as 25 to 75% interquartile boxes. different superscript letters indicate significant differences (P 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain. Detailed images of necrotic and apoptotic cells are shown to the far right (A and B) the scale bar represents 20 m. JEV induces poor innate immune responses in NEC. after 24, 48, and 72 hpi, inserts were collected and cytokine gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR for IL-6 (A), IL-8 (B), IFN-3 (C), and SOCS1 (D) the experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. neither of the JEV strains induced a statistically significant increase in expression for this gene at the investigated time points. suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is upregulated in cells infected by JEV (36) both JEV strains induced a significant upregulation of SOCS1 in NEC, with higher gene expression in laos-infected cells. differences between different JEV strains and mock at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.002; **, P 0.002; **, P 0.002; **, P 0.001). basolateral medium collected from JEV-infected NEC induced a significant increase of porcine monocyte migration. IL-4 treatment of macrophages enhanced infectivity and virus replication of both strains of JEV. the second observation was that JEV harvested from NEC had enhanced infectivity for IL-4-treated macrophages. this indicated the presence of additional factors released by epithelial cells with a potential to enhance infection of macrophages. all experiments were repeated three independent times in duplicate. significant differences between nonpolarized and IL-4 polarized MDM for the same challenge condition are shown by asterisks (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.002) porcine macrophages were challenged with JEV Laos at an MOI of 1 TCID50/cell. the influence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP (all at 10 ng/ml) was tested when added with the virus inoculum. after 24 hpi, cells were harvested and E protein-positive cells acquired by flow cytometry. porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 105 TCID50/sample for 2 h, followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h. three-dimensional (3D) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. lateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC. similar titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts. the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system. nuclei (DAPI, dark blue), cilia (-tubulin, red), tight junctions (ZO-1; light blue) and JEV E protein. 3D scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. scale bars represent 20 and 8 m for panels D and E, respectively. CD90-induced apoptosis induction was employed as a positive control. the percentage of E protein expressing dead (A) or apoptotic (B) cells is shown in the upper left corner of each image. 3D scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. porcine NEC were challenged with JEV Laos and Nakayama at an MOI of 0.1 TCID50/cell. after 24, 48, and 72 hpi, inserts were collected and cytokine gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR for IL-6 (A), IL-8 (B), IFN-3 (C), and SOCS1 (D). the experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. mRNA expression levels of CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 were significantly upregulated by the virus at 48 and 72 hpi compared to those in mock controls. mRNA expression levels of CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 were significantly upregulated by the virus at 48 and 72 hpi. basolateral medium from porcine NEC at 72 hpi was used for chemotaxis experiments. mean values SD are shown, with different superscript letters indicating significant difference (P 0.05) between samples challenged with same JEV strain. differences between distinct JEV strains and mock at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks. we compared the infectivity of basolateral culture media obtained from infected NEC and JEV derived from vero cell-propagated virus. the media used as infectious JEV sources were adjusted to the same multiplicity of infection (MOI) the first observation made in these experiments was that IL-4 treatment of macrophages enhanced infectivity and virus replication of both strains of JEV. IL-4-treated porcine MDM were infected with JEV Laos or Nakayama for 72 h at an MOI of 1 TCID50/cell. all experiments were repeated three independent times in duplicate. nonpolarized (A) and IL-4-polarized (B) macrophages were challenged with JEV Laos at an MOI of 1 TCID50/cell. the influence of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP (all at 10 ng/ml) was tested when added with the virus inoculum, incubated for 1.5 h, and washed off. after 24 hpi, cells were harvested and E protein-positive cells acquired by despite this multitude of reports, nothing is known about the mechanisms leading to such routes of transmission. for nonlaboratory exposures, a first prerequisite for aerosol contact transmission would be that the virus is secreted into body fluids such as mucosal secretions or urine. the source of the virus and first target remained unknown. the in vivo relevance of the presented data is further supported by the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs, it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia (9), pointing to a local cellular source for virus replication. the larger JEV RNA amount was detected in nasal mucosa (11) a systemic infection could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area. these alarmins are known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which promote M2-like macrophage polarization. these alarmins can enhance JEV infection of macrophages, further supporting this concept. the same applies to the macrophage work in terms of virus replication and shedding. the same applies to the macrophage work in terms of virus replication and shedding. such models may be used for any species and therefore permit analysis of species differences. viral titers were determined in vero cells using the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) with the anti-flavivirus E antibody 4G2 (ATCC HB-112) Titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per milliliter. porcine nasal mucosa explants were isolated from four 3-month-old pigs. mucosa was incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C and washed 3 times with BEGM. after 2, 24, and 48 hpi one piece of tissue per condition was embedded and cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Leica Microsystems) helial cell serum-free growth medium (BEGM; LHC basal medium supplemented; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and retinoic acid (50 nM; Sigma) incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the medium was changed after 24 h and then every 2 to 3 days until confluence was reached. RNA was extracted from NEC at each indicated time postinfection. an extra insert was kept for 72 hpi to fix in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) ATGCTTTCGCTCTG 400 Probe FAM-TGGACCGGCGCAAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAA 500 76 PR GCCTCACAGAGAGAA 500 Probe FAM-TTCTCTTCGCCCCCTCAGTGTGAA-TAMRA 125 CCL5 PF TCCATGGCAGCTCTCTT 500 Probe FAM-ACCGCCCCCCACAGAGA basolateral supernatants of porcine NEC harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hpi were used for determination of porcine IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. blood from 6- to 24-month-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Swiss Large White pigs from our own breeding facilities was taken. recombinant human IL-25, IL-33, TSLP (Thermo Fisher) or any possible combination thereof was added at 10 ng/ml each, with the virus inoculum and removed at the same time after incubation. the cells were harvested as cell suspensions, immunolabeled with the anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2, and acquired on a FACSCantoII. monocytes were harvested at 72 hpi and dispensed into 24-well plates. 106 monocytes were added into transwell inserts with 3-m-diameter pores. monocytes were quantified by flow cytometry. porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS/ and incubated in 4% PFA for 15 min. cells were incubated with anti-ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher) and anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h. all incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark. for each staining, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma) at 2 g/ml was applied for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Sigma) for the present work, we employed the same JEV strains as in our previously published in vivo studies (8, 9, 12). a P value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. sterile surgical compresses were cut in squares of 1.2 cm, placed in 12-well plates. the nasal mucosa tissues were cut in 1-cm squares and placed onto the compresses in 12-well plates and refilled with medium. after incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, mucus was washed away with BEGM, and mucosa pieces were transferred to new empty 12-well plates without compresses. the epithelium was treated with 0.1% protease (mass/volume [m/v]; from Streptomyces griseus type XIV; Sigma) and desoxyribonuclease I (0.001% m/v; from bovine pancreas; Sigma) after 48 h the cells were harvested by gently scratching the apical surface. pore size of 0.4 m (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were coated with collagen type IV (Sigma) and 2 105 cells per insert were seeded in 500 l of BEGM (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and 1 ml in the lower chamber. after 24 h, the insert medium was replaced, and then the medium in both chambers was changed every 2 to 3 days. cDNA was generated with the Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher) RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using random hexamers (thermo Fisher) the primer and probe sequences used in this work are listed in Table 1.
