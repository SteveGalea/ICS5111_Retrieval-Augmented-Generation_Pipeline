{"summary": "a virus with distant relationship to coronaviruses based on a fragment from the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene was discovered (1). the tentatively named Cavally virus (CavV) represented the first insect-associated nidovirus, defining a novel virus family within the order Nidovirales (2). the viruses turned out to be closely related (4) and are now proposed to belong to the same virus species. NDiV was reported to be an enveloped, spherical virus. the positive-sense RNA genomes of CavV and NDiV comprise 20,187 and 20,192 nucleotides (nt), respectively. the medium-size genomes of the two viruses, NDiV, inspired the name mesonivirus. conserved domains in pp1ab of mesoniviruses and large nidoviruses (CoV, ToV, and RoV) include a picornavirus 3C-like main protease (3CLpro, also called Mpro), flanked on either side by two transmembrane domains (TMDs), an RdRp, a complex zinc-binding motif (Z) that is linked to a superfamily 1 helicase ( two sg mRNAs are 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 coterminal and carry 5\u2032 leader sequences derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome. synthesis of mesonivirus sg mRNAs seems to involve two different leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) elements. positions and sizes of TRSs, as well as number of sg mRNAs detected in virus-infected cells, varied. Virus isolation experiments were done from 432 pools with 4,839 female mosquitoes on C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and Vero cells as described previously (1, 12). two endpoint dilutions via titration on C6/36 cells were performed. aliquot of cell culture supernatant was removed 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection. RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III RT system. RNA was extracted from mosquito pools (n = 432) and from pools inducing cytopathic effects (CPE) on C6/36 cells (n = 105) using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III RT System (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) using random hexameric primers (R6) following manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. purified either by gel extraction (QIAex II; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or by gel extraction (ExoSAP-it, High Wycombe, United Kingdom). genome sequencing. fragments were elongated by primer walking, seminested PCRs using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) phosphorylation sites were identified in NetPhos 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) the molecular weights and isoelectric points of putative proteins were calculated with the pI/MW tool (http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/). 12% or 14% polyacrylamide gel washed twice in distilled water. gel stained with Coomassie (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250) for 1 h at 50\u00b0C. epitope-specific antisera were raised against each putative protein of CavV. the respective antisera were generated by Eurogentec Inc. (Seraing, Belgium; 28-day speedy polyclonal packages) SDS-PAGE with purified, concentrated viral particles was performed. proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman Protran; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) using a semidry blotting system. the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-CavV/Ns\u00e9V serum in a 1:1,000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 solution. bound antibodies were visualized on an X-ray film using goat anti-rabbit-peroxide dismutase (POD) aliquot of cell culture supernatant was removed 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postinfection. RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III RT system. five blind passages of cell culture supernatant were performed on fresh cells in 1:10 dilutions. three blind passages of cell culture supernatant were performed on fresh cells. cDNA was synthesized using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit. nested PCRs were tested using platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) and the primers MeNiV-F1 (5\u2032-AAAYAAATCAGAASCAGGACG-3\u2032) and MeNiV-R1 (5\u2032-WGTYACRCCTCCDGGTTTCTG-3\u2032) for first-round PCR. PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified either by gel extraction (Qiagen cDNA termini were amplified by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR products were cloned into the TopoTA pCR4 cloning vector (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) and amplified. pairwise identities on the nucleotide and amino acid levels were determined using ClustalW within Geneious 6. blot analyses of viral mRNAs were done as described previously (2). total RNA was further used to amplify the 5\u2032 ends of subgenomic mRNAs with gene-specific primers for ORF2a/b, ORF3a/b, and ORF4 using the GeneRacer kit. ylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane stained for 10 min in 40% methanol. membrane was then washed with 50% methanol until distinct protein bands became visible. inactivated virus produced from 1 1010 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of CavV and Ns\u00e9V (50% each) was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant.

varied among the four mesoniviruses. similarities to other viral and cellular proteins could not be detected. mesoniviruses use two distinct TRS motifs for sgRNA synthesis. we then investigated sg mRNA expression by Northern blotting. mRNAs from infected C6/36 cells were used as a control. mRNA that encodes the 2a (S) and 2b (N) proteins in its 5\u2032-terminal region (tentatively termed sgRNA2) was found to be fused to the 5\u2032 leader sequence at 124AGACACTCTCCCA. the mRNA that encodes the 3a and 3b proteins in its 5\u2032-terminal region (tentatively termed sgRNA3) used 27TAATACTACTACTA as a TRS (the nucleot three proteins were expressed from ORF2a, suggesting that the putative spike protein is subject to proteolytic cleavage. the proteins were tentatively named S (p77), S1 (p23), and S2 (p57) the site is conserved among mesoniviruses. the identities of CavV virion proteins were analyzed by Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. specific ORFs shown to encode the respective proteins are given on the right. predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the S and M proteins are indicated by brown triangles. a Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-CavV/Ns\u00e9V serum was performed. no proteins corresponding to ORF3b, ORF4 or other small ORFs were detected. anti-peptide antibodies raised against specific epitopes of the predicted ORF2a-, ORF2b-, and ORF3a-encoded proteins were generated. rabbit anti-CavV antiserum was found to cross-react with the HanaV M protein but failed to detect the M protein homologs from M\u00e9noV and Ns\u00e9V. the rabbit anti-CavV N serum was able to detect the putative N proteins from all four mesoniviruses. the proteins were analyzed either directly () or after deglycosylation using PNGase F (+) and detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-CavV/Ns\u00e9V serum (A), rabbit anti-CavV N serum (B), rabbit anti-CavV S serum (C), and rabbit anti-CavV M serum (D) in panels A and C, proteins shown in the upper blot were separated by SDS-PAGE. the presence of other viruses in the samples may also have influenced mesonivirus prevalence (1, 12, 20, 21) differences in viral detection rates could also be explained by differential intrinsic capabilities of the viruses to replicate. mesoniviruses appear to contain a lower number of spike projections. it remains to be determined if this difference reflects an intrinsic instability of (some) mesonivirus spike proteins or less efficient integration of the protein in the viral envelope. genome comparisons of four distinct mesoniviruses revealed conserved properties. the current demarcation of CoV species has been based on the presence of more than 90% amino acid sequence identity in the seven most conserved polyprotein pp1ab domains. if the same criteria approved for the Coronavirinae are applied to members of the Mesoniviridae, four different mesonivirus species have been described. gene loss along this long lineage appears to be more likely than gene acquisition along the shorter branch connecting the common mesonivirus ancestor with the ancestor of the ORF4-containing sister taxon to M\u00e9noV. the presence of an ExoN domain in mesoniviruses may indicate an intrinsic potential of this nidovirus lineage. nidovirus sgRNAs have two [33], mesoniviruses at least three, toVs three or four [34], and CoVs up to 12 [7]. nidovirus sgRNAs do not contain leader sequences (35), indicating a potential evolutionary trend that would be in line with our topology. the most prominent mesonivirus protein was shown to be the M protein, expressed from sgRNA3, which is produced in larger amounts than sgRNA2. it remains to be determined whether the observed gradient for viral RNA synthesis is solely caused by the (postulated) discontinuous extension process of subgenomic minus strands. new data suggest mesonivirus virions contain eight major structural protein species, i.e., a nonglycosylated p25 (a putative N protein), four forms of a glycosylated membrane protein (a putative M protein, p17, p18, p19, and p20), and three ORF2a-encoded glycoproteins. a cleavage product corresponding to the N-terminal 223 amino acid residues apparent absence of S1 and S2 may have been caused by too low protein concentrations in the preparations analyzed. similar locations of cleavage sites and absence of the most N-terminal cleavage product were also reported for the envelope glycoproteins of RoV (40). coV S proteins are known to form homotrimers, with their S1 subunits forming the globular membrane-distal part containing the receptor-binding domain and S2 subunits forming the membrane-anchored stalk essential for fusion activity. this conformation is also suggested for the S proteins of ToV, and it seems reasonable to predict a similar structure for mesonivirus S protein. we found a high level of mesonivirus diversity in a genetically rather narrow sample of mosquitoes from only one geographic region. insects from other taxa and geographic regions should be tested for mesoniviruses to help answer important questions related to molecular biology, phylogeny, host range."}
