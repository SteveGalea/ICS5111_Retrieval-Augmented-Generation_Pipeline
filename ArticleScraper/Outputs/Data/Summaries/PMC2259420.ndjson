{"summary": "the presence of clusters of promiscuous T-cell epitopes, immunological hotspots, has been observed in several antigens. these clusters may be exploited to facilitate the development of epitope-based vaccines by selecting a small number of hotspots that can elicit all of the required required T-cell activation functions. hotspot Hunter is a new generation computational tool aiding in epitope-based vaccine design. binding of fragments of processed antigens by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and their presentation to T-cells is crucial for immune surveillance and defence against bacteria, parasites, viruses and tumors. clusters of promiscuous T-cell epitopes, immunological hotspots, have been observed in several antigens, such as SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid [11], HIV-1 proteins [12-14] and Chlamydia trachomatis outer membrane protein [15]. these clusters may be exploited to facilitate the development of epitope-based vaccines by selecting a small number of hotspots that can elicit all of the required hotspot Hunter uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods as predictive engines. soft computing exploits the tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty and approximation, all characteristics for T-cell epitope data. the training data was from experiments conducted on 340 15-mers to measure their binding affinity to each of the six HLA-DRB1 variants. each 15-mer binder was decomposed into overlapping 9-mers which were submitted to SYFPEITHI for HLA-DR binding prediction. three-layer back propagation networks (267-4-1) with sigmoid activation functions were built for HLA-B7 supertype. the maximum number of the ANN training cycles was set to 300. the training was repeated four times, and four sets of weights were obtained. the area under the receiver operating curve (Aroc) for A2, A3, B7 and DR ANN models were 0.83, 0.83, 0.88 and 0.85 respectively. ten-fold cross-validation results showed that the Aroc of A2, A3, B7 and DR models are 0.91, 0.95, 0.92, and 0.80 respectively. the prediction performance of models for HLA-B7 supertype was validated using experimental results of the tumor-associated antigen survivin (NCBI Accession: NP_001159.2) [34,35] Hotspot Hunter correctly predicted one hotspot and missed one. each input protein sequence to Hotspot Hunter is truncated into overlapping 9-mer peptide sequences with an 8 amino acid overlap. the window length of 30 amino acids was found to be best for class I predictions. the window length of 15 amino acids was best for class II predictions. a region in protein sequence is considered as immunological hotspot specific to a HLA supertype only if its predicted binding strength is above the threshold defined for the supertype. the input interface is shown in Fig 1A (numbering is relative to the mature sequence of MOG) hotspot Hunter predicted four hotspots, 38\u201356, 79\u201393, 121\u2013163 and 174\u2013211, for the protein. the predicted hotspots are displayed in two formats. the input protein sequence is myelin Oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (NCBI Accession: CAA88109) the selected HLA supertype of interest is HLA-DR. the input protein sequence is myelin Oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. the input is a set of dengue virus type 1 capsid sequences in ALN or PHY (PHYLIP) format. the input is a set of dengue virus type 1 capsid sequences in ALN format. antigenically redundant peptides are peptides whose complete nonamer antigenic diversity is covered by the other peptides at the consensus hotspot position. nonamer antigenic diversity was studied because they represent the predominant length of binding cores of T-cell epitopes. cleavage, TAP (transporter associated protein) transport, and MHC class I binding have been proposed as a supporting methodology for prediction of high probability targets for therapeutic peptides and vaccines [45]. a major weakness of these methods is that they only represent the major antigen processing pathways; alternative pathways for class I peptide loading exist [48]. hotspot Hunter is a new generation computational tool aiding in epitope-based vaccine design. the system provides a utility for selecting candidate experimental targets based on antigenic diversity analysis. authors declare that they have no competing interests. this project has been funded in part with federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, USA. the ImmunoGrid project under the EC contract FP6-2004-IST-4, no. 028069."}
