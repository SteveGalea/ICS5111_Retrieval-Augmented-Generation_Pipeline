{"summary": "only 10%\u201320% of smokers will develop the disease at some day in their life. deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is present in at least 1% of the carriers of the disease in Europe and the united states. globally, this disease is present in 600 million people, especially in low- and middle-income countries. it is estimated that in 2020, it will rank among the first three causes of death worldwide. pathological changes that are induced as a consequence of chronic exposure to cigarette smoke are observed more early in airway epithelium. toxic particles contained in the cigarette smoke generate tissue remodeling as a consequence of the damage they cause to airway epithelium. most pronounced changes are shortening of the cilia (resulting in less mobility of the mucus produced by goblet cells and less elimination of pathogens) cell death produced releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as heat shock proteins, S100 protein and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),14 which are recognized by extracellular receptors present in neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)15\u201317 and trigger an intracellular signaling cascade led by the transcription factors Myd88 and NF-B that culminate in the release of proinflammatory cytokines. a microenvironment rich in IL-12 will lead to the activation and differentiation of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. this leads to an intracellular signaling cascade commanded by MyD88 and the transcription factor NF-B. this leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-18. airway epithelium acts as a barrier that protects the lungs from environmental factors and also from toxic compounds present in tobacco smoke. the most pronounced changes are shortening of the cilia, metaplasia and hyperplasia of goblet-producing goblet cells. heat shock proteins, S100 protein and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),14 are recognized by extracellular receptors present in neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs; such as toll-like receptors)15\u201317 and trigger an intracellular signaling cascade led by the transcription factors Myd88 and NF-B that culminate in the release of proinflammatory cytokines. once in the area to which they were recruited, leukocytes release products stored in epithelial cells present in the airways release DAMPs. this leads to an intracellular signaling cascade commanded by MyD88. this leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-18. dendritic cells are presented to the virgin T lymphocytes through the class II MHC-11, which binds to the TCR present on the cell membrane. polarization to Th17 CD4+ occurs from three signals: first, the binding of the TCR to the antigen. IL-17A influences most cells in the lung parenchyma, such as macrophages and DCs, which express receptors for IL-17A. IL-22 has been linked to multiple pathologies of an inflammatory nature, for example, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, CD8+ T lymphocytes, basophils, mast cells, NK 30, 31, 33 IL-17F It induces the expression of IL-6, TNF-, GM-CSF, CXCL10 and CXCL8 in epithelial, vascular, fibroblasts, neutrophil and eosinophil cells. main characteristics of the proinflammatory genes related to Th17 CD4+ lymphocytes Gene Encoded protein Locus Exons/introns Amino acids Described variants Base pairs Genome location IL17A IL-17A 6p12 3/2 155 155 4,251 Forward IL17F IL-17F 6p12 3/2 163 174 7,856 Reverse IL22 IL-22 12q15 5/4 179 130 5,365 Reverse IL23A IL the presence of bacteria in patients who have had an exacerbation does not prove that these alone are sufficient to trigger the exacerbation of the symptomatology of patients with COPD. in healthy individuals, different species of bacteria are constantly inhaled. however, due to the responsiveness of their immune system that is not compromised, they are not capable of infecting the host. eudomonas aeruginosa 43, 46, 47, 49 Streptococcus pneumoniae 43, 52\u201354 Staphylococcus aureus 52, 53 Haemophilus influenzae 46, 49, 50 Enterobacteriaceae 49, 54 Klebsiella pneumoniae 43, 46, 47 Moraxella catharralis 44, 45, 50 Viruses In the past, it was believed that only bacteria were capable of generating exacer vitamin D induces IB (a potent inhibitor of NF-B) expression in airway epithelial cells, favoring a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. this increase of 1,25D in airways will contribute to control tissue damage. the lungs contain, depending on the disease or stage in which they are found, a variable content of microbiomas. in the upper airways, there are also colonizing microorganisms. the nasopharynx is colonized under normal conditions by non-hemolytic, -hemolytic Streptococcus and some Neisseria species. the loss of the tight junctions between epithelial cells acting as an impermeable barrier is a factor that helps colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria. it has also been shown that patients with COPD who are vaccinated against some pneumococcal strains are less prone to exacerbations. vitamin D induces IB (a potent inhibitor of NF-B) expression in airway epithelial cells, favoring a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. this increase of 1,25D in airways will contribute to control tissue damage, while maintaining viral clearance. influenza vaccine is more effective than pneumococcus. it is also one of the main etiological agents of exacerbations. IL-27 significantly augmented T-bet expression by naive CD4+ T cells in Th1 conditions. cigarette smoke exposure induced the upregulation of IL-27R (WSX-1) by naive CD4+ T cells. also, IL-27R expression is increased during bacterial and parasitic infections. a deficiency in the phagolysosome trafficking in DC leads to a deficient antigenic presentation. inhibiting the production of IL-10 (inhibitory cytokine) by Tregs decreases the likelihood of secondary S. pneumoniae infection. cytokines such as IL-17A and IL-17F do not exist in the airway microenvironment. ligand stimulates expression of Th17 polarizing mediators and influences in vitro Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells. a complex system of proinflammatory cells and molecules is involved in its pathogenesis."}
