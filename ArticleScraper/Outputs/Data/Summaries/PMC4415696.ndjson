{"summary": "1,2 one consistent feature of pandemic influenza is a surge in demand for health care. hospitalization due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the USA was estimated at approximately 274 000 cases between April 2009 and April 20105. the availability of intensive care units beds came under pressure in most national health systems. results are interpreted with reference to sociological understandings of population behaviour. they are highly relevant to the development of appropriate interventions to minimize refusal to work. outcome measures of interest were proportion of HCWs reporting willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. all identified records were imported to endnote software X4 (Thomson Reuters, Toronto, CA, USA) the remaining records were screened by a single researcher (YA) against the protocol eligibility criteria following a sequential assessment of the study title, abstract and full-text article. we considered it statistically inappropriate to perform meta-analysis where I2 exceeded 85%. we planned to conduct subgroup analyses according to the type of influenza pandemic; geographical region; survey time period; type of questionnaire; type of participants; sex of participants. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS, AMED, ASSIA, BioEthicsWeb, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO were searched. search terms were \u2018pandemic + influenza + willingness to work/report to work\u2019 to avoid including studies on willingness to accept vaccination. risk of bias was assessed for each study using a Newcastle\u2013Ottawa assessment scale modified for cross-sectional studies by Herzog et al. Random-effect meta-analysis estimated the proportion of HCWs (including 95% confidence intervals [CIs] who reported willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. results Study selection We identified a total of 1133 unique records of which 43 studies met protocol eligibility criteria. two studies did not describe the percentage of participants reporting willingness to work. 41 were included in the meta-analysis of the pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work during an influenza pandemic. 931% (908\u2013951) Barnett (2009)35 USA 2006\u20132007 Health department workers 1835 (83%) Convenience (all employees in four clusters of local health departments) 92% (907\u2013932) Errett (2013)36 USA 2009 (June\u2013August) Medical Reserve Corps 3181 (not stated) Convenience (all doctors, medical students attending a lecture and 500 nurses in the region) 99% (909\u2013928) Barnett (2012)37 USA April 2009\u2013June 2010 Local public health department workers 79% (748\u2013829) Daugherty (2009)45 USA Early 2007 ICU and CCU staff 256 (88%) Convenience (attendants of meetings in two hospitals) 79% (734\u2013837) Cone (2006)46 USA 2001\u20132002 Hospital workers 1711 (85%) Convenience (from 9 hospitals) 72% (698\u2013741) Dickinson (2009)47 Canada 2009 (September\u2013November) Family physicians 192 (22%) Stratified random (from the list of all family physicians in the region Tippett (2010)56 Australia May 2006 Emergency pre-hospital medical care providers 725 (25%) Stratified random (from national network of 9 ambulance services) 563% (526\u2013599) Basta (2009)57 USA 2006 (November\u2013December) Health department workers 2414 (51%) Stratified random (from national network of 9 ambulance services) 562% (542\u2013582) Balicer (2006)58 USA 2005 (March\u2013July) Health department workers 308 (58%) Judgement sampling (3 health departments) 538% (482 66 Taiwan December 2005 Nurses 225 (95%) Convenience (attendants of classes) 569% (501\u2013635) Irvin (2008)67 USA 2006 (July\u2013August) Hospital workers 169 (90%) Convenience (attendants of lecture) 50% (425\u2013581) Studies of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Wong (2010)22 Hong Kong 2009 (June) Community nurses 401 (67%) All community nurses in the region 231% (191\u2013276) Ma (2011)68 China December 10 studies were at low risk (4\u20135 stars) and ten were at high risk (0\u20131 stars) many studies used convenience sampling and few justified the study sample size. many studies did not clarify how statistical adjustment for confounding variables was carried out. females were one-third less likely to be willing to work compared with males. by occupational group, physicians were most likely to be willing to work. full-time workers were more likely to be willing to work than part-time employees. adjusted 8 156 (117\u2013208) 001 820 NS Doctor/Others 204 357 Adjusted 2 273 (137\u2013543) 001 292 \u2013 6403 1574 Unadjusted 7 243 (178\u2013331) 001 589 NS Clinical/Non-clinical 964 1622 Adjusted 3 Not valid \u2013 888* NS* 2472 4825 Unadjusted 7 Not valid \u2013 961* NS* Location ( 410** Unadjusted 3 Not valid \u2013 978* NS* Risk perception 2307** 1987** Adjusted 6 Not valid \u2013 885* NS* 206** 873** Unadjusted 3 227 (152\u2013341) 001 459 NS Training 1206** 1694** Adjusted 6 138 (113\u2013168) 001 453 001 1966** 1822** Unadjusted 6 Not valid \u2013 862* NS* meta-analysis abandoned due to excessive statistical heterogeneity. training in pandemic preparedness, general and specific role knowledge, good communication skills and perception of role importance all had positive effects on willingness to work. study selection We identified a total of 1133 unique records of which 43 studies met protocol eligibility criteria. two studies did not describe the percentage of participants reporting willingness to work;
