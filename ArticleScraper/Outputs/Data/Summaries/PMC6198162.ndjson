{"summary": "IBV is an acute contagious viral infection with low mortality and a significant reduction in performance in chicken. the virus consists of three important structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), the membrane (M), and the spike (S1 and S2) glycoproteins. the nucleotide sequence of the S1 gene is highly variable, which makes it prone to mutation and emergence of new variants of the virus. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of IBVs in broiler chicken respiratory complexes in Ahvaz. the study was to study the partial S1 sequences among field isolates of IBVs. all experiments were carried out after approval by the animal committee of Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran. cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the topological stability of the tree was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replications. the percentage of nucleotide sequence identity of partial S1 gene of IBV isolates in the present study and the other IBV strains from GenBank. the results showed that 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. the nucleotide sequences were submitted to the GenBank sequence database. the results showed that 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. IBV is one of the main pathogens of commercial and backyard chickens with several serotypes and genotypes circulating in the world. 12 out of 25 examined flocks (48.00%) were found to be infected with IBV, which show the prominent role of the virus in respiratory involvement. Isolated IBVs in the present study clustered with QX-like viruses. for the first time, in 1996, QX strain of IBV was identified in China."}
