{"summary": "HSV-1 is an enveloped, linear double-stranded DNA virus. diseases caused by herpes simplex include cold sores, keratoconjunctivitis, genital herpes and encephalitis. treatments currently directed against HSV infections are nucleoside analogs. anthraquinones derivatives like aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, and chrysophanol demonstrated antiviral effects. but as with most Chinese herbal medicines, the application of rhubarb is limited due to its poor bioavailability and hydrophobicity. nanoparticles might resolve the biopharmaceutical problems related to improving the uptake of poorly soluble drugs, reducing toxicity and increasing the drug bioavailability the in vivo efficacies of R. tanguticum nanoparticles were investigated with a mouse model of HSV-1 encephalitis. the positive results offer a novel promising way for the usage of Chinese herbal medicine to control the HSV-1 infection. the mobile phase composed of A) methanol and B) 0.1% (v/v) phosphoric acid water solution was delivered at a rate of 1 ml/min. the reference marker compounds of aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion for high-performance liquid chromatography were purchased from the Shanghai Standard Technology Co., Ltd. HEp-2 cells in 96-well plates were incubated with various concentrations of R. tanguticum nanoparticles at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. the virus was propagated in HEp-2 cells and stored at 80\u00b0C for further studies. the plaques developed after 72 h of incubation were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. the plaques were counted and the percentages of inhibition were calculated. the effective concentration of test compound that reduced plaques number by 50% (EC50) was calculated. HEp-2 cell monolayers were pre-chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the medium was replaced with different concentrations of cold R. tanguticum nanoparticles and was incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and were covered with methylcellulose to allow viral adsorption. the immediate early gene 4 (encoding ICP4), early gene U L 29 (encoding ICP8) and late gene U S 6 (encoding glycoprotein gD) were determined by using a Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument. the transcription levels of total RNA in each sample were standardized against the GAPDH gene. cells were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 0.01. soluble fraction was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. membranes were blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h, rinsed and then incubated. mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally by ketamine (100 mg/kg) and injected intracerebrally with 20 l serial dilutions of HSV-1(HSV-1 F strain) no death and obvious weight loss were seen when R. tanguticum nanoparticles were at dosages below 2,500 mg/kg/day. the mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups and inoculated intracerebrally with 20 l of DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing either no virus (vehicle only) or 5LD50 of HSV-1(HSV-1 F strain. after 5 h, the inoculated mice received either dissolved in Saline (0.9%) before administration to mice with the indicated dose at 625 mg/kg/day or 312.5 mg/kg/day. assays, brains of four mice per group were collected on day 5 post infection. total RNA was extracted from brain tissues with TRIzol reagent. expression of two viral genes was determined using RT-qPCR. R. tanguticum nanoparticles were characterized by a transmission electron microscope. a drop of R. tanguticum nanoparticles suspension was placed on a carbon coated-copper grid and evaporated to form a monolayer at room temperature. the elemental analysis was carried out with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. the zeta potential (ZP) of R. tanguticum nanoparticles was measured with the same instrument. the samples were suspended in distilled water and were analyzed in triplicate at a temperature of 25\u00b0C. the optical density at 570 nm was then determined by a conventional microplate reader (MultiskanTM GO; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). the CC50 was calculated using a regression analysis. the virus inocula were added to HEp-2 cell monolayers. after adsorption for 2 h, the viral inoculum were discarded. the cells were washed once with PBS, and then overlaid with overlay media. HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 0.01. total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Ambion\u00ae, Life Technologies Pty Ltd., Carlsbad, CA) the cDNA was synthesized in a reverse-transcriptase reaction. HEp-2 cells were in the presence or absence of R. tanguticum nanoparticles (350 g/ml) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h.p.i., the cells were fixed with pre-chilled 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. the cells were then rinsed three times for 5 min in PBS, followed by in membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and visualized by using an ECL Western Blot Detection Kit. mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally by ketamine (100 mg/kg) and injected intracerebrally with 20 l 10-fold serial dilution of HSV-1(HSV-1 F strain) 1,250 mg/kg/day, 625 mg/kg/day, 312.5 mg/kg/day, 156.3 mg/kg/day. no death and obvious weight loss were seen when R. tanguticum nanoparticles were at doses below 2,500 mg/kg/day. mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups and inoculated intracerebrally with 20 l of DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing either no virus (vehicle the homogenates were frozen and thawed twice to release the virus. the supernatant was used to test the virus titers in the HEp-2 cells. brains of four mice per group were collected on day 5 post infection. the concentrations of aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion in R. tanguticum nanoparticles were 0.226, 0.443, 0.503, 0.853 and 0.252% respectively. the result revealed that the content of the five anthraquinone compounds in R. tanguticum nanoparticles was in accordance with the quality standard of Chinese Pharmacopo the small polydispersity index (PDI) value indicates the R. tanguticum nanoparticles are uniform in particle size with a narrow particle size range. the zeta potential values were a little low which may induce agglomeration in nanosystem. the anti-HSV-1 efficacy of R. tanguticum nanoparticles was further conducted using a plaque reduction assay (PRA) the results showed that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could suppress HSV-1 viral plaque formation in a dose-dependent manner. HEp-2 cells infected with HSV-1 were treated with different concentrations of R. tanguticum nanoparticles. hep-2 cells were treated with different concentrations of R. tanguticum nanoparticles. the mRNA levels of the IE gene ICP4, E gene ICP8 and L gene gD were significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner when treated with R. tanguticum nanoparticles. the effect of ICP4 and ICP8 on their production was further determined by Western blot analysis and IFA. HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 0.01. the cells were harvested at each time point (6, 12, 18, and 24 h) for western blot analysis of ICP4 and ICP8. survival time, lethality and viral titers in the brains were recorded to determine the antiviral efficiency of R. tanguticum nanoparticles. survival rates were 30.0% and 60.0%, which are higher than the viral control group (20.0%) on the 14th day post-infection. ing mice (n = 10 mice/group) infected with 5 LD50 of HSV-1 were orally administered with 625 mg/kg/day and 312.5 mg/kg/day. a 0.9% saline was used in viral control and normal control group. survival rates were collected daily for 14 day. treatment with R. tanguticum nanoparticles at 312.5 mg/kg/day is similar to those in virus group. post-treatment with R. tanguticum nanoparticles can alleviate severity of brain damage in the virus-infected mice. the expression of the ICP4 protein of the brain tissue was detected by Western blot analysis. the mRNA levels of the ICP4 and ICP8 were determined by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. the morphology and size of R. tanguticum nanoparticles were characterized by using TEM and DLS techniques. the mean particle size of R. tanguticum nanoparticles calculated by TEM was around 123.2 nm. hep-2 cells were treated with serial dilutions of R. tanguticum nanoparticles at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of R. tanguticum nanoparticles on HEp-2 cells was 415.3 g/ml. R. tanguticum nanoparticles (350 g/ml) were added to HEp-2 cell monolayers at indicated times post-infection. the cells were harvested at 72 h.p.i. the inhibitory effect was significant when R. tanguticum nanoparticles were added at 0\u201315 h.p.i. the progeny virus yields were determined by plaque assay. values are represented as the mean standard deviation of three individual experiments. VC is the abbreviation of the \u201cvirus control group\u201d. the effect of R. tanguticum nanoparticles on HSV-1 immediate-early and early genes expression was further determined by western blot analysis and IFA. the western blot results showed that ICP4 and ICP8 failed to express in virus-infected R. tanguticum nanoparticles treated cells which were significantly lower than in the virus-infected group. total RNA was extracted and subjected to cDNA synthesis. the real-time quantitative PCR was performed. values are represented as the mean standard deviation. the protective rate of acyclovir at 100 mg/kg/day was shown to be 70%. the changes of the virus titers at the 5th d.p.i. were also detected to confirm the protective efficacy of R. tanguticum nanoparticles. saline mice treated with 0.9% saline (viral control, NC); acyclovir mice treated with 312.5 or 625 mg/kg/day of R. tanguticum nanoparticles. in virus group, HE staining showed tissue hyperemia, inflammatory cell aggregation, degeneration of neural cells and virus-induced diffuse necrosis. mRNA expression levels of both ICP4 and ICP8 could be down-regulated in brain tissues of mice compared to virus control (p 0.01) treatment with R. tanguticum nanoparticles (625 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased the expression of the ICP4 protein levels compared with non-treated infected groups. nanoparticles exist broad-spectrum antiviral activity for its potential multi-targeting mechanism of action. it has been reported that silver nanoparticles have proven to be active against several types of viruses. tanguticum nanoparticles exerted a more effective antiviral activity when they were added post infection. the formation of viral plaques was reduced by fifty percent when treated with 194.1 g/ml R. tanguticum nanoparticles, and plaques were completely inhibited when the concentration is 300 g/ml or higher. rhubarb ethanol extract exhibited anti-viral effects on herpes simplex virus infection in vivo and treated mice by injected hypodermically with the dose at 4.9 g/kg/day. this indicates that nanoparticles could improve the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of therapeutic agents. further experiments need to be carried out to confirm which way the R. tanguticum nanoparticles work by using transmission electron microscopy. a competitive gB/gC-capture ELISA using HSPGs-coated plate should be performed to verify this hypothesis. silver nanoparticles with diameters between 10 and 80 nm showed antiviral activity against monkeypox virus. silver nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 10 nm (Ag-PS-10) were the most effective at inhibiting MPV infectivity. silver nanoparticles could induce production of cytokines and chemokines that important for anti-viral response. the nanoparticles were spherical and hexagonal shapes with an average size of 121.5 nm. they showed an excellent bactericidal effect against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. however, the antiviral activity of these nanoparticles was not evaluated at that time. research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
