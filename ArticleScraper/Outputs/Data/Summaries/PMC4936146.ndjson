{"summary": "new world hantaviruses have been associated with a highly lethal disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) hantaviruses alter the barrier properties of the microvascular endothelial cells that they infect, causing vascular leakage in the kidneys or lungs. hantaviruses are known to cause disease by multiple routes of infection. the predominant route of human exposure is inhalation of excreta from infected rodent hosts. alveolar macrophages (AM) are found in the alveoli and alveolar ducts of the lung. studies of humans infected with hantavirus have detected high titers of proinflammatory and vasoactive cytokines in lung tissue of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome patients. systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines have also been reported in plasma of patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal symptoms (25), suggesting a role for these cytokines in disease pathogenesis. ANDV causes a lethal disease in adult hamsters (30) that resembles HPS in humans. soluble mediators secreted by infected AM do not contribute to hantavirus disease. female hamsters 6 to 8 weeks of age were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized isoflurane. for i.m. challenges, anesthetized hamsters were injected with 80 PFU (10 50% lethal doses [LD50]) of virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.2 ml, caudal thigh) the vocal folds were numbed by topically administering a 2% lidocaine HCl jelly (Akorn) and then a 16-gauge 1.25-in Surflo catheter (Terumo) was passed between the vocal folds. the trachea was lavaged 3 times using 1 ml of a 0.02% EDTA solution. cells were stained with mouse-anti-hamster MARCO (32) (clone PAL-1; 10 g/100 l; AbD Serotec) followed by anti-mouse IgM (clone RMM-1; 0.4 g/ml; BioLegend) for 15 to 20 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were then fixed in Cytofix buffer (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. real-time PCR was conducted on a bio-Rad CFX thermal cycler using an Invitrogen Power SYBR green RNA-to-CT one-step kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. anti-hamster cytokine ELISA kits were purchased from MyBioSource and were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. slides were rinsed, and a serum-free protein block with 5% goat serum was applied for 30 min. monoclonal antibody was then applied to the tissue at a dilution of 1:1,200 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. slides were then treated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary mouse IgG antibody. survival curves were compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log rank comparisons and Dunnett's correction. comparisons of viral genome, infectious virus, alveolar macrophage, and neutrophil percentages and numbers were done using a one-way analysis of variance. anesthetized hamsters were injected with 80 PFU (10 50% lethal doses [LD50]) of virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.2 ml, caudal thigh) each animal was placed in a dorsal recumbent position, and an otoscope was used to visualize the vocal fold. the vocal folds were numbed by topically administering a 2% lidocaine HCl jelly (Akorn) and then a 16-gauge 1.25-in Surflo catheter (Terumo) was passed between the vocal folds. the trachea was lavaged 3 times using 1 ml of a 0.02% EDTA solution. Stained cells were then fixed in Cytofix buffer (BD Biosciences) for 15 to 20 min at 4\u00b0C. analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using cellQuest software (BD Biosciences) andV S 41F, 5\u2032-GAA TGA GCA CCC TCC AAG AAT TG-3\u2032; ANDV S 107R, 5\u2032-CGA GCA GTC ACG AGC TGT TG-3\u2032. anti-hamster cytokine ELISA kits were purchased from myBioSource. a monoclonal antibody (USAMRIID number 1244) against ANDES virus was used on all tissue slides. monoclonal antibody was applied to the tissue at a dilution of 1:1,200. slides were then treated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary mouse IgG antibody. slides were exposed to a substrate-chromogen for 30 min, rinsed, counterstained with hematoxylin, and coverslipped with Permount. survival curves were compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. comparisons of viral genome, infectious virus, alveolar macrophage, and neutrophil percentages and numbers were done using a one-way analysis of variance. hamsters were treated intratracheally with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (Clodrosomes) or control PBS-encapsulated liposomes (Encapsomes) on days 3 and 1. one group of hamsters was left untreated; one group was left untreated. clodronate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the total number of alveolar macrophages. Hamsters were treated intratracheally with liposomal clodronates or control liposomes on days 3 and 1 prior to an 80-PFU ANDV i.m. challenge. the ability of Encapsome or liposomal clodronate treatment to deplete AM was determined by analyzing the percentage of MARCO+ cells (b) or FSChi/SSChi cells (c) in hamster BAL samples. serial sections of lung tissue from these groups revealed the presence of ANDV antigen colocalized to CD31-positive endothelial cells in both capillaries and larger vessels. despite treatment, no differences were observed in pathogenesis of HPS-like disease in ANDV-infected hamsters. alveolar macrophages found in ANDV-infected hamsters were negative for Andes virus. depletion of AM does not prevent disease following intranasal ANDV challenge. alveolar macrophages are more likely to be involved in defense against airborne pathogens. the number of AM at day 17 in the untreated group was significantly lower than the number of AM in the untreated group at day 10. the difference between the number of AM in the control liposome-treated animals and untreated animals on day 17 was not significant. however, the difference in the number of AM in the control liposome-treated animals and untreated animals on day 17 was significant. a) and 17 days (b) post-ANDV challenge, the number of AM was determined by flow cytometry by gating on FSChi/SSChi cells. the numbers of AM on days 10 and 17 in untreated, ANDV-challenged hamsters were directly compared (**, P 0.01). all surviving animals seroconverted, indicating that they had been exposed to virus. depletion AM alters TNF- expression but only early after intranasal ANDV challenge. hamsters were challenged either with 4,000 PFU ANDV by intranasal infection or with 80 PFU ANDV by intramuscular infection. the depletion of AM resulted in increased TNF- levels 10 days after intranasal ANDV challenge. liposomal clodronate and control liposome treatments resulted in a decrease in both MIP-1 (a) and MIP-2 expression (e) compared to untreated hamsters after intramuscular challenge. liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in an increase in the number of neutrophils in hamster BAL fluid on day 10 (f) but not on day 17 (g) after intranasal challenge. early in disease pathogenesis (day 10), MIP-1 and MIP-2 expression were reduced in both liposomal clodronate- and control liposome-treated hamsters. control liposome treatment resulted in increased numbers of recruited AM. liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in an increased number of neutrophils. VEGF expression in hamsters 10 days after intranasal ANDV challenge was only slightly, but not significantly, elevated. at the time of peak disease on day 17, there was almost a 2-fold increase in VEGF-A protein. VEGF-A expression in the BAL fluid on day 10 was equivalent to the amount of VEGF-A detected in all hamster BAL samples on day 17. clodronate has been used extensively to deplete AM in many animal models. in the hamster, AM were identified as high forward light scatter, high side light scatter (FSChiSSChi), MARCO-expressing cells in hamster BAL fluid (Fig. 1a) and intratracheal administration of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes was found to effectively reduce the number of AM in hamsters during ANDV infection. the mean time to death following control liposome treatment was significantly longer than that in untreated animals. depletion of AM also did not result in increased ANDV titers in the lung as measured by PCR. these data suggest that AM are not important for protection against an intramuscular ANDV challenge. the number of alveolar macrophages is affected when treated with liposomal clodronate or control liposome. hamsters were challenged with 80 PFU ANDV by intramuscular infection. the depletion of AM did not prevent disease in hamsters. hamsters treated with liposomal clodronate (a) or control liposome (b), untreated ANDV-infected hamsters (c), or normal uninfected hamsters (d) stained with antibodies specific for CD31 (DAB; brown) or ANDV NP (alkaline phosphatase; red) no differences were seen in the pattern of ANDV NP staining across treatment groups. liposomal clodronate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in AM. control liposome treatment resulted in a trend toward increased numbers of AM compared to untreated animals. ANDV titers in the lung were not significantly different in liposomal clodronate-treated hamsters at either day 10 or day 17 as determined by the presence of viral genome measured by PCR. however, there was a trend toward increased ANDV M copy number in the lungs of liposomal clodronate-treated animals 10 days postchallenge. treatment with either liposomal clodronate or control liposome resulted in an increase in detected TNF- compared to that in untreated hamsters. reduction in AM did not reduce the amount of TNF- detected in BAL samples 10 days after intramuscular challenge. BAL samples were collected from all hamsters 10 days after intramuscular challenge (a to c) or 10 and 17 days after 4,000 PFU intranasal ANDV challenge (d to g) both liposomal clodronate and control liposome treatments resulted in a decrease in both MIP-1 (a) and MIP-2 expression (e) compared to untreated hamsters after intramuscular challenge. at peak of hantavirus disease following intramuscular infection with ANDV, we observed a decrease in the neutrophil chemoattractant MIP-1 in BAL samples from AM-depleted hamsters compared to untreated ANDV-infected hamsters. but the expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant MIP-2 in BAL samples from all hamsters remained unchanged. neutrophil numbers in control liposome-treated and untreated hamsters remained virtually unchanged between days 10 and 17. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been hypothesized to play a role in hantavirus disease pathogenesis. liposome-treated hamsters demonstrate that VEGF expression is enhanced in hantaviruses infected with ANDV. but AM may regulate the expression of VEGF by other cell types in the lung. but they are not a major source of VEGF during hantavirus disease pathogenesis. alveolar macrophages may play an important role in clearing or contributing to disease caused by aerosolized hantaviruses. the disease resulting from parenteral exposure is virtually identical to the disease following aerosol infection. hamsters experimentally infected with ANDV by intramuscular challenge develop a disease that is indistinguishable from the disease exhibited following intranasal exposure. alveolar macrophages depleted in mice prior to infection with influenza virus. mice showed lower percent oxygen saturation (sO2) and oxygen partial pressure (pO2), arguing that AM are important for maintaining lung function during infection. same mechanisms that alveolar macrophages use to protect against pathogens have also been implicated in causing disease. antigens of yellow fever virus can be found inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of AM. it is unknown whether AM play any role in disease pathogenesis. it is also unknown whether other hemorrhagic fever viruses target AM. alveolar macrophages were found to stain positive for hantavirus antigen (57) hamsters devoid of AM developed disease faster than untreated or control-treated ANDV-infected hamsters. hamsters devoid of AM developed disease faster than untreated or control-treated hamsters. surviving animals were found in control liposome-treated animals. this group also had greater numbers of AM than liposomal clodronate-treated animals. this could suggest that early after infection, AM help prevent spread of infection by reducing infectious virus in the lung. in hamsters, AM are more prone to an immunosuppressive phenotype. by depleting them, other cell types, including neutrophils, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells are no longer prevented from producing TNF-. AM appear to play a greater role in the negative regulation of neutrophil migration in that the depletion of AM amplifies neutrophil recruitment. a decrease in MIP-1 and MIP-2 in liposomal clodronate-treated animals following intranasal challenge was accompanied by an increase in BAL neutrophils. neutrophils migrate freely to the lung and act as a MIP-1/MIP-2 \u201csponge\u201d that soaks up free chemokine and reduces the overall levels of bioavailable MIP-1/MIP-2. similar explanation could hold true for decreased abundance of MIP-1 and MIP-2 following control liposome treatment in which newly arrived AM act as the chemokine sponge. cases failed to detect changes in MIP-2, MIP-1a, IL-8, or MCP-1. significant increases in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were detected. GM-CSF and M-CSF could implicate macrophages and dendritic cells in disease (81, 82) hantavirus infection sensitizes endothelial cells to VEGF, rendering them hyperpermeable (87) in a process involving VE-cadherin (88, 89) and potentially 3 integrin (90). increased levels of VEGF can be detected in pleural effluent from patients with acute HPS (91) or in serum samples of acute-phase HFRS patients (92) epithelial cells (99, 100) and neutrophils (101, 102) are other known sources of VEGF in the lung. expression could be induced by inflammatory cytokines produced by other cells during infection. role for neutrophils in vascular leakage caused by HTNV infection of SCID mice has been suggested. endothelial cells form a dome controlled by RhoA and F-actin (107) over the neutrophil to prevent vascular leakage. hamster models are invaluable tools to study pathogenesis of diseases caused by neglected infectious disease agents such as Andes virus. the utility of the hamster model, as well as the role of the immune response, is contentious. infection are likely to be important for protection and viral clearance, even as they are seen as contributing to disease. it will be necessary to continue to evaluate other immune cell types."}
