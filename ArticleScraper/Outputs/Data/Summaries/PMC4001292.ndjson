{"summary": "children 3 years of age were enrolled and followed through weekly household visits. symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) were recorded during each visit. nasal swabs were obtained during episodes of ARI for identification of respiratory viruses. cohort members were followed through weekly household visits. field-workers were trained in data and sample collection. follow-up started in may 2009 and continued through either the third birthday, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up (travel outside the area or inability to locate), death or the end of the study (30 September 2011). a nonacquisition episode was defined as 2 consecutive swabs in which there was no pneumococcal colonization in the second swab. indeterminate episodes included those in which both swabs were nontypable or in which serogroups could not be completely distinguished. children were allowed to contribute >1 episode of observation, all analyses accounted for the correlation introduced by the clustering of observations at the subject level. acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype was the model outcome, and ARIs or specific viral ARIs were the main study exposures. a complete enumeration of eligible population in the study catchment area was obtained through a local census. field-workers obtained baseline demographic and socioeconomic information and information on known risk factors for ARI. cohort members were followed through weekly household visits by field-workers who visited the home of each enrolled child. colected NP samples were placed in skim milk, tryptone, glucose, and glycerine media. NP testing has been completed for years 2009 and 2011. a new acquisition episode defined as the identification of a S. pneumoniae serotype that was not present in the previous NP sample. identification of Viral Respiratory Infections Nasal swab specimens were obtained during episodes of ARI, placed in virus transport medium, and transported to the local laboratory for long-term storage at 70\u00b0C. random subsets were also tested for RNase P [24] to determine the integrity of the samples. analyses were performed in Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) study included data from 729 children or 82% of the RESPIRA-PERU prospective cohort. median duration of observation episodes was 28 days. the prevalence of influenza and parainfluenza viruses was higher among pneumococcal acquisition episodes than among nonacquisition episodes. for influenza, 25 (89%) of infections were due to the A(H1N1)pdm strain, while for parainfluenza, 73 (96%) of infections were due to PIV3. up to elementary 70.5 70.3.447 Environmental exposures Open fire/traditional stove for cooking 67.1 65.6.712 Use wood for the stove 93.2 92.4.818 At least 1 dose of influenza vaccine 26.7 26.4.893 At least 1 smoker at home 8.8 10.4.275 Exposure to ARIb No ARI 51.4 47.7 Reference ARI no virus detected 12.8 12.2.882 Influenza ARI 1.2 2.4.046 Parainfluenza ARI 3.5 5.9.014 Respiratory s CI,.99\u20131.51) or any ARI (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI,.95\u20131.41) did not significantly increase pneumococcal acquisition risk when compared with no ARI. adjusted odds ratios were obtained from a random-effects logistic regression model that controlled for age, presence of young children at the household. ARI with viral coinfections (134 [82%] involved HRV and 38 [23%] influenza or parainfluenza) were also significantly associated with pneumococcal acquisition. the stratified analysis by age group suggested a stronger association with influenza and an attenuated association with PIV among infants. for influenza, 25 (89%) of infections were due to the A(H1N1)pdm strain. parainfluenza, 73 (96%) of infections were due to PIV3. enza viruses were higher among nonacquisition episodes than among nonacquisition episodes. at least 2 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 46.3 43.2.209 Child attends daycare 5.5 8.1.040 At least 1 smoker at home 8.8 10.4.275 Exposure to ARIb No ARI 51.4 47.7 Reference ARI no virus detected 12.8 12.2.882 Influenza ARI 1.2 2.4.046 Parainfluenza ARI 3.5 5.9.014 Respiratory syncytial virus ARI 4.6 5.3.343 Human metapneumovirus all virus exposures are mutually exclusive. adjusted odds ratios were obtained from a random-effects logistic regression model. there was no significant association between respiratory viral infection and pneumococcal acquisition among children who were already colonized. ARI with viral coinfections (134 [82%] involved HRV and 38 [23%] influenza or parainfluenza) were also significantly associated with pneumococcal acquisition. the stratified analysis by age group suggested a stronger association with influenza and an attenuated association with PIV among infants. the study was limited by a small number of pneumococcal acquisition episodes and the lack of molecular laboratory methods. however, no conclusive association between rhinovirus and pneumococcus was demonstrated. nasopharynx mucous surface colonized with pneumococcus extended forward toward the nasal cavities and downward toward the trachea. neuraminidase, an enzyme that cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface, could be a common factor that facilitates bacterial adherence, NP pneumococcal colonization, and thus pneumococcal diseases. the role of influenza and PIV infections on pneumococcal colonization was restricted to children who were already colonized. there were no age differences between these children and those who acquired pneumococcus after not being colonized, suggesting age-related immunity may not explain this observation. our study findings suggest a selective synergism between certain respiratory viruses and pneumococcus. this association seemed to be especially strong among children who were already colonized with pneumococcus."}
