{"summary": "glycans have branched structures with extremely high-degrees of freedom in internal motions. structural feature enables the glycans to embed and express multiple messages deciphered by various lectins as fate determinants of glycoproteins in the early secretory pathway. glucosidase I is responsible for this unsealing process by catalyzing the cleavage of the terminal Glc-1,2-Glc glycosidic linkage. glucosidase I is a type II transmembrane protein of 80 kDa\u2013110 kDa, possessing a large catalytic domain. the cleavages of the second and third glucose residues are catalyzed by the same enzyme glucosidase II. the enzyme comprises approximately a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and a 60-kDa regulatory subunit. the subunit is predicted to belong to the GH31 family and adopts a globular structure. avage of the Glc-1,3-Glc linkage at the D1 branch is catalyzed by the subunit. the mannosidase-catalyzed cleavage of the Man-1,2-Man at the D3 branch is a key step leading to ERAD. the cooperation between the and subunits of glucosidase II is likely to be a critical mechanism in the processes of glycoprotein fate determination. globular carbohydrate recognition domain recruits ERp57, a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family chaperone. ERp29 has a single Trx-like domain without the CXXC catalytic motif. despite their overall structural similarities, the monoglucosylated D1 branch is accommodated in parallel with -strands in l-type lectins. folding sensor enzyme is capable of sensing folding states of glycoproteins as potential substrates. UGGT can form a complex with Sep15, a 15-kDa selenocystein-containing oxidoreductase possessing one redox-active Trx-like domain. it is conceivable that Sep15 serves as a structural and functional extension. crystal structures of the third Trx-like domain of thermophilic fungal UGGT show its extensive hydrophobic patch. it is capable of trapping a hydrophobic molecule through the exposed hydrophobic patch in an open conformation. these results provide a clue to the mechanism of the manner in which UGGT senses the folding states of potential substrates. l-type lectins, ERGIC-53 and VIP36, exhibit disparate sugar-binding specificities and affinities, despite structural similarities in their CRDs. in contrast, ERGIC-53 exhibits a broader specificity towards the high-mannose-type glycans, irrespective of the presence or absence of the terminal monoglucose residue at the D1 branch. two independent groups reported crystal structures of ERGIC-53CRD complexed with sugar ligands [28,29]. bound 1,2-linked mannobiose in the complex structures is represented in stick models. one mode is similar to that of VIP36CRD, which has a protruding aspartate residue instead of glycine at the corresponding position of the sugar-binding pocket. a mechanistic model has been proposed, which involves a conformational change of MCFD2 with the opening of its putative ligand-binding pocket. new cargo glycoproteins were identified for ERGIC-53, including Mac-2BP, which is a large oligomeric secretory glycoprotein. MCFD2 captures their polypeptide segments. ER-degradation enhancing -mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) and their yeast homolog Htm1p were originally identified as lectins that recognize Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B (M8B) there has been a controversy as to whether the EDEM family proteins function as mannosidases or lectins. OS-9 is tethered to the SEL1L-contaning ER membrane dislocation complex. the functional role of its homolog XTP3-B remains controversial. unlike OS-9, XTP3-B did not facilitate degradation of misfolded glycoprotein substrates. structural studies on the l-type lectins have given insights into structural mechanisms of the manner in which structurally homologous MRH domains exhibit disparate sugar-binding specificities. the sensing ability of the glycoprotein folding states has been suggested for OS-9/Yos9p. however, it remains elusive whether the ERAD lectins directly recognize folding states of potential ERAD substrates. crystallographic studies have successfully provided conformational snapshots of oligosaccharides recognized by lectins. however, these data give only one-sided views of glycan recognition mechanisms in terms of the energetics of carbohydrate-protein interactions. glycans are supposed to have considerable conformational flexibility, at least in their uncomplexed states. the conformation of the 1,2-linked D1 trimannosyl moiety, accommodated in VIP36CRD, corresponds to a low-populated conformational state of this branch among its conformational ensemble. these data suggest conformational selection by the lectin during the glycan recognition process. the removal of the terminal mannose residue at the D2 branch results in significant expansion of the conformational space with increased population of the foldback conformations. carbohydrate recognition is controlled by static steric factors such as shape of the sugar-binding pocket of lectin and non-reducing terminal capping of glycans. the ER quality control system is ingeniously designed by combining these mechanisms employing the high-mannose-type glycans as transformable signals recognized by intracellular lectins and processing enzymes. control coupled with N-glycan processing in the ER."}
