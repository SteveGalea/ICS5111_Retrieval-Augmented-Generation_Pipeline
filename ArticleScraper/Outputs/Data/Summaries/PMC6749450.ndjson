{"summary": "nucleoside analogues have long served as the cornerstone for antiviral therapeutics due to their ability to inhibit viral DNA or RNA replication. in the past decade, research in the seley-Radtke lab has focused on the development of various types of flexible nucleoside analogues, called \u201cfleximers\u201d that have demonstrated the ability to overcome point mutation within the binding site of biologically significant enzymes. fleximer analogues based on the structure of the fda-approved drug Acyclovir demonstrated great promise. compound 1 showed low micromolar activity against coronaviruses [17], filoviruses [20], and most recently, flaviviruses. a secondary series featuring a methoxy at the 2-position on the pyrimidine was developed to better analyze the effect of hydrogen bonding motifs on antiviral activity. 2Cl2 to give 8\u201310 as clear to pale yellow oils in high yields (78\u201399%) stannyl pyrimidine 13 was realized with bistributyltin. synthesis of series 5 started with commercially available 2-amino-5-iodopyrimidine (14) and bis(tributyltin) to give the stannyl pyrimidine 15 in good yields compared to previous series. dba3\u2022CHCl3, anh.

DMF, 65 \u00b0C, 3\u20135 h. protection of the 4-aminopyrimidine was tried using two equivalents of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate to give a di-boc protected amine, which could easily be deprotected after coupling to the sugar using mild acidic conditions. however, subsequent attempts at installing the boronic ester (21) were unsuccessful. tetrahydrofuran (THF), 78 \u00b0C; b. EtMgBr, ZnCl2, THF, 78\u00b0C \u2013 rt, 2 h; c. 9 (for 5-iPrAc), or 10 (for 5-tBuAc), respectively. the addition of 10% NH4OH to CH3OH in the chromatography gradient greatly decreased streaking. the synthesis of 1, 1-Ac, 2, and 2-Ac have already been reported. the remaining analogues in these series were pursued first. stannyl pyrimidine 13 was realized in good yields. synthesis of series 5 started with commercially available 2-amino-5-iodopyrimidine (14) and bis(tributyltin) to give the stannyl pyrimidine 15 in good yields compared to previous series. the 2-aminopyrimidine series 4 was pursued using stille palladium catalyzed cross-coupling methods. the 4-aminopyrimidine series 5 was originally pursued using similar methods. a protection group for the 4-aminopyrimidine was envisioned in attempts to make purification more facile and increase the overall yields. tert-butyl dicarbonate gave a di-boc protected amine, which could easily be deprotected after coupling to the sugar using mild acidic conditions (Scheme 6). protection of the 5-iodo intermediate 17 was successful in producing the di-boc compound 19; subsequent attempts at installing the stannyl component (20) were unsuccessful. Compound 17 was first protected in situ with chlorotrimethylsilane to give intermediate 23, which was then complexed with ZnCl2 to give intermediate 24. dropwise addition of the zinc complex to either 9 or 10 gave 5-iPrAc and 5-tBuAc, respectively. aEC50: effective concentration showing 50% inhibition of virus-expressed ZsGreen fluorescence. all compounds were nontoxic up to 100 M in uninfected cells. no analogues showed any cytotoxicity up to 100 M. adenosine series 5 were not active except for the tBuAc, which demonstrated weak activity. the difference in activity between the Ac, EtAc, and iPrAc is an interesting trend, as the analogues were consistently the least active. logP values were determined for each analogue. the greater the value, the more lipophilic the compound. all the parent analogues (R group = H) were the least lipophilic of the series. isopropyl acyl analogue 3-iPrAc demonstrates an EC50 of 38.29 28.15 M and a logP of 1.76. 3-tBuAc has an EC50 of 51.40 10.01 M and a logP of 2.47. this suggests compounds with logP values over 2.8 are too lipophilic. selective inversion of (B) H11 and (C) H6 proton resulted in strong NOE enhancement of 4.3% at H1\u2019, whereas other NOE enhancements were relatively weak. the lack of strong NOE enhancements between H11 and H6 suggests that anti-orientation along the C11\u2013C10\u2013C5\u2013C6 torsion angle is the predominant conformation of compound 1 in solution. compounds 1, 1-Ac, 2, 2-Ac, 5 and 5-Ac have been analyzed in these studies. it will be interesting to see if the 4-methoxy series 3 or the 2-amino series 4 also demonstrate different orientations compared to series 1 or 5. 1H-NMR spectra was recorded on a JEOL Eclipse ECX (400 MHz) or a Bruker Advance III HD (101 MHz) spectrometer. chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as an internal standard. a nitrogen balloon was added the corresponding anhydride (2 equivalents), triethylamine (2.50 mL, 17.85 mmol), and DMAP (0.18 g, 1.49 mmol) with stirring at room temperature. the reaction stirred for 3 hours at room temperature; then, the solvent was removed in vacuo. the crude mixture was purified by flash column chromatography on silica (0\u2013100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the product as a clear oil (2.0 g, 99%); Rf = 0.53 (1:1 EtOAc: Hex;1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) 7.26 (s, 1H), 6.89 (s, 1H), 5.01 (s, 2H), 3.77\u20133.78 (m, 2H), 2.14 the sugar (1 equivalent) and stannyl reagent (1.2 equivalents) were dried in a three-neck flash in vacuo for two hours, and then were suspended in anh. the reaction was heated to 65 \u00b0C and stirred with direct nitrogen bubbling for 2.5 h. the crude mixture was then purified three to four times by flash column chromatography on silica. the product was purified three times by flash column chromatography on silica. the sugar 9 (0.80 g, 2.37 mmol) and 4-methoxy-5-(tributylstannyl)pyrimidin-2-amine (1.18 g, 2.84 mmol) were used. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) 8.80 (s, 1H), 7.60 (s, 1H), 7.39 (s, 1H), 5.31 (s, 2H), 4.17\u20134.20 (t, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 3.98 (s, 3H), 3.59\u20133.61 (t, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H), 2.48\u20132.55 (m, 1H), 1.10\u20131.12 (d, J = 9.2 t, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 4.11 (s, 3H), 3.65\u20133.67 (t, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 1.19\u20131.27 (s, 9H), 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3) 176.48, 166.35, 153.71, 137.37, 134.27, 117.33, 104.72, 76.09, 66.45, 62.77, 52.73, 2.28\u20132.33 (m, 2H), 1.05\u20131.08 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 3H); 13C NMR (126 MHz, CD3OD) 174.44, 166.98, 163.58, 154.80, 138.21, 132.99, 118.74, 108.50, 76.34, 66.67, 62.73, 54.08, 53.49, 26.74, 8.01; 1H NMR 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 9.05 (s, 1H), 7.95 (s, 1H), 7.53 (s, 1H), 5.42 (s, 2H), 4.22\u20134.23 (t, J = 4.7 Hz, 2H), 4.04 (s, 3H), 3.65\u20133.68 (t, J = 4.6 Hz, 2H), 1.18\u20131.20 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3) a solution of 4-chloro-5-iodopyrimidine (0.5 g, 2.08 mmol) in anh was added to a solution of 12 (0.89 g, 3.79 mmol) the reaction was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 6 hours.
