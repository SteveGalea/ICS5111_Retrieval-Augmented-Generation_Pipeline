{"summary": "a telephone survey of the general population from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. conducted from mid-February to mid-March 2004. households were selected by using random digit dialing and respondents were selected by using random number tables based on varying household sizes. respondents expressed agreement or disagreement using 5-point Likert scales. average annual live chicken purchase rates were calculated by using a conservatively estimated number of live chicken purchases per response category. perceived risk moderates behavior (10\u201312) the draft questionnaire was examined by a panel of experts, including epidemiologists and psychologists, to determine face validity. the questionnaire was then pilot tested with respondents, who were questioned on item comprehensibility and relevance. the instrument was retested as necessary to obtain satisfactory responses. average annual live chicken purchase rates calculated by using a conservatively estimated number of live chicken purchases per response category. to households reporting 1 live chicken purchase per year, 1 live chicken purchase was attributed; to households reporting \"a few times a year,\" 4 were attributed; to households reporting \"monthly,\" 24 were attributed; to households reporting \"weekly,\" 52 were attributed; and to those reporting \"a few times a week,\" 100 purchases annually were attributed. 256 declined to participate or complete the survey (556 were \"too busy,\" 688 refused for other reasons. the sample comprised 589 women and 397 men closely matching the most recent population census data. men had a wider age distribution than women (2 = 16.3, degrees of freedom [df] 5, p = 0.006), more likely to be single (2 = 23.84, df 3, p0.001), born in Hong Kong (2 = 21.67, df 3, p = 0.0 2 = 21.67, df = 4, p0.001. 2 = 23.84, df = 3, p0.001. # 2 = 10.54, df = 3, p = 0.015. in households that reported buying live chickens, 76% (72%\u201378%) of female and 31% (26%\u201336%) of male respondents personally bought live chickens. 18% (14%\u201322%) reported that all family members bought live chickens. 69% (64%\u201374%) reported that live chickens were bought by other household members but not the respondent. Detailed purchase patterns and rates are given in Table 2. standardized purchase rate only among respondents reporting household purchase of live chickens. in households buying live chickens, 14% of male respondents and 65% of female respondents make purchases. sex-proportionately adjusted buying rate is used as the estimated average household buying rate. four separate items tapped perception of risk from buying live chickens. 36% (33%\u201339%) of respondents agreed with the statement \"buying live chickens is risky to health\" the next 2 items considered perceived consequences of risk. factor 3, \"protective practice\" (8%), items reflected avian influenza worries, effect of media reports. factor 5, \"feel protected\" (6%), items reflected reassurance from media reports. factors 1\u20135 plus attitudinal items not included in factor scores. model 3 identified adjusted independent predictors of risk perceptions for getting sick from buying live chickens. older age lowered perceived risk, while worries about catching bird flu, animal husbandry risk, protective practices and avian influenza anxiety increased risk perception. annual number of live chicken purchases reported by male and female respondents (standardized) in households buying live chickens, 14% of male respondents and 65% of female respondents make purchases. 65% of women but only 14% of men personally bought live chickens. sex-adjusted household purchase rate for all 2,051,890 households in Hong Kong is given in Table 2. 14% (10%\u201316%) of female and 19% (14%\u201323%) of male purchasers touched chickens. 53% (50%\u201356%) perceiving the likelihood of getting sick at below 26%, 38% (35%\u201341%) in the range 26%\u201350%, and 9% (7%\u201311%), exceeding a 51% likelihood. Factor 1, \"animal husbandry risk\" (10% of variance), items supported traditional markets, their low health risks, live chicken sales. models included factors 1\u20135 plus attitudinal items not included in factor scores. models included factors 1\u20135 plus attitudinal items not included in factor scores. the observed purchase (and therefore exposure) rate of 18.7 live chickens/household/year matches government figures of 38,325,000 live chickens purchased annually in Hong Kong. how much risk this exposure represents is difficult to accurately quantify. wet markets amplify viral loads (19). 4.2 million exposures provide substantial opportunity for chicken-to-human transmission in wet markets. most other Southeast Asian countries have endemic avian influenza infections. risk magnitude seldom exceeded 60%, and peaks at 25% and 50% are partially artifactual. hazard exposure causes familiarity, thus reducing perceptions of risk. hazard exposure causes familiarity, thus reducing perceptions of risk. health warnings can produce short-term effects that rapidly attenuate in absence of increased perceived threat."}
