{"summary": "the entire DENV2 EDIII region was inserted into the backbone sequence of a deNV4 molecular clone to create a recombinant virus. the recombinant virus, which had 40 amino acid changes in EDIII compared to the parental wild-type (wt) DENV4 strain, grew to similar levels as the wt viruses in C6/36 insect cells. rDENV4/2 chimera had a maturation state similar to that of DENV4. insertion of EDIII from serotype 2 minimally altered the maturation state of the backbone serotype 4 virus. cross-reactive MAbs 1C19, 1N5 and 1M7 bound to the chimera. we predict that the full 2D22 epitope required for antibody binding and neutralization includes EDIII, as well as some conserved residues on adjacent domains. the epitope consists of residues on EDIII and EDII of different monomers within a single dimer. only five of the eight contact residues identified in EDIII differ between DENV2 and DENV4 suggesting these are critical residues important for 2D22 binding and neutralization. the rDENV4/2 virus remained fully sensitive to neutralization by DENV4 immune sera. the rDENV4/2 virus did not display increased sensitivity to neutralization by DENV1 or DENV3 immune sera. rDENV4/2 neutralization by human and macaque DENV immune sera. a cell-based focus reduction neutralization test was performed using primary DENV2 (A), primary DENV4 (B), primary DENV1 (C), primary DENV3 (D), and monovalent DENV2 (E) vaccine immune sera. sera that did not block 50% of infection at the lowest serum dilution factor were assigned a value of 10. the same sera were depleted using DENV2 rEDIII alone. one sample lost 58% of neutralization, a significantly smaller loss of neutralization than that of DENV2 depletions. the results indicate that most DENV2 epitopes targeted by polyclonal type-specific human neutralizing antibodies require assembly of more higher-order structures. serum DENV2 virion depletion DENV2 rEDIII depletion BSA depleted (FRNT50) rEDIII depleted (FRNT50) % loss of neutralization (mean SD) DENV2 infection sera DT001 147 82 44 171 131 23 IRB019 931 261 72 372 305 18 DT031 1,288 721 44 1,493 1,140 24 DT110 644 76 88 1,718 the vaccine neutralized DENV2 and the rDENV4/2 chimera but not DENV4. the vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies that tracked with the transplanted EDIII. three vaccine sera were depleted of antibodies binding intact DENV2 virions or recombinant DENV2 EDIII. full-length cDNA was synthesized and inserted into the pUC-57 plasmid (BioBasic) full-length cDNA was transcribed into genome-length RNAs using T7 polymerase, as previously described by our group. the c6/36 and U937+DC-SIGN media were supplemented with nonessential amino acids. all media were supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. total RNA was isolated from viral supernatants and used as the template for cDNA synthesis. nonhuman primate immune sera were collected following experimental DENV2 infection. all sera were collected following informed consent and approval by the Western Institutional Review Board. the plates were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma), and then foci were counted. either MAbs or sera were diluted 4-fold and mixed with 40 focus-forming units (FFU) of virus and then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. each 24 h, culture supernatant was harvested and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Membranes were probed with 0.5 g/ml anti-E MAb 4G2, 0.5 g/ml anti-prM MAb 2H12, and MAb 5L20 in blocking buffer for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Membrane was exposed to chemiluminescent substrate and developed on film. polyclonal immune sera were depleted of antibodies by incubation with coated beads for at least three rounds. ELISA plates were coated directly with either 50 ng of DENV2 antigen or 100 ng DENV2 rEDIII per well at 4\u00b0C overnight. andepleted, control depleted, and antigen/rEDIII-depleted sera were incubated on plates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) design to distinguish rDENV4/2 from parental DENV4. mutants introduced into DENV4 E gene disrupted XmnI enzyme restriction site present in DENV4. PCR products were gel purified and digested with XmnI. additional residue changes replace hydrophobic amino acids with polar amino acids.
