{"summary": "traditional public health surveillance provides accurate information but is typically not timely. new early warning systems leveraging timely electronic data are emerging. but the public health value of such systems is still unknown. the public health agency of Canada (the Agency) first deployed a pharmacy-based syndromic surveillance in 2004. in 2009, pharmacy-based syndromic surveillance was again used by the agency in response to the influenza H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) outbreak. data was obtained for respiratory surveillance on antiviral prescriptions in Ontario (2009-2015) and respiratory OTCs in Nova Scotia (2014-2015) these were compared with confirmed cases of influenza and reports of influenza-like-illness in Ontario and laboratory detection of non-influenza respiratory pathogens in Nova Scotia. pharmacosurveillance data was extracted from the FluWatch Surveillance System. five years of prescription antiviral sales in Ontario were compared to reported cases of influenza-like-illness between august 2009 and January 2015 and to confirmed cases of influenza between 2011 and 2015. pharmacy data acquisition was established through a contract with an industry partner, Rx Canada. daily prescription sales data were sourced from 13 national pharmacy chains and four independents. both OTC and prescription datasets provided coverage for over 85% of the health regions across Canada. weekly provincial laboratory detections of respiratory viral pathogens from Nova Scotia were evaluated relative to sales of respiratory over-the-counter products for the same period. rho was determined for three time frames (January to December, November to March and April to October) sales of antivirals between 2009 and 2015 correlated closely with the onset dates of confirmed cases. for January and December the rho was 0.80, in November and March the rho was 0.70 and from April to October the rho was 0.60. reports of ILI followed the same trends of confirmed cases and antivirals. there were no definitive correlations between the occurrence of outbreaks and sales of gastrointestinal products. no significant increases in sales of gastrointestinal products were detected. five jurisdictions stated that they used the information. for January and December the rho was 0.80, in November and March the rho was 0.70 and from April to October the rho was 0.60. reports of ILI followed the same trends of confirmed cases and antivirals. however, ILI varied considerably in late spring and summer. antiviral prescriptions were a clear marker of influenza activity for respiratory illness surveillance. the value of pharmacosurveillance for outbreak-related enteric activity was less certain. a potential weakness is that it included only prescribed medications and OTCs from retail pharmacies not linked to health care institutions. timely and accurate pharmacosurveillance has the potential to enhance public health capacity to detect and quantify activity at the local, multijurisdictional and national level."}
