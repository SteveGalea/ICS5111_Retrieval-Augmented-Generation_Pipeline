{"summary": "103 CF patients (49 girls, 54 boys; median age 8.9 years; age range 3.8 months\u201317.8 years) were enrolled in the study from September 6, 2006 through September 4, 2007. sputum or oropharyngeal samples for microbiology culture were collected during scheduled visits or unscheduled visits on 408 occasions. samples in which picornavirus cDNA had been identified were submitted to a real-time PCR protocol (11) to identify HRV and enterovirus. only samples in which rhinovirus had been identified by real-time PCR were submitted to 5\u2032 CR sequencing with an automated sequencer. results were visualized through the MegaBace FragmentProfiler software. at least 1 respiratory virus was identified in 203 (49.8%) of 408 samples; rhinovirus was the main identified agent (139 samples, 34.1%). the results of virus identification, in relation to clinical status, are shown in Table 1. 93 of 139 samples showed a predominance of genotype A (36 samples; 38.7%). Isolates in 3 samples were identified as HRV87, coxsackievirus, and echovirus. 5 isolates were enteroviruses, which indicates that the TaqMan\u2013based real-time PCR platform misidentified them. virologic test results and respiratory exacerbation outcome for 103 children with cystic fibrosis, Brazil, 2006\u20132007*. p value Any respiratory virus 1.063 (0.979\u20131.154) 0.144 Rhinovirus 1.020 (0.931\u20131.117) 0.666 Any respiratory virus except rhinoviruses 1.195 (1.043\u20131.369) 0.010 Rhinovirus A2 or C (excluding samples not sequenced) 1.213 (1.024\u20131.436) Smyth et al (15), who evaluated respiratory exacerbations in CF patients, identified rhinovirus as the leading agent. the group used PCR to investigate the presence of 7 different viruses in sputum or laryngeal aspirates. viral infections did not reduce lung function or increase respiratory symptoms."}
