{"summary": "the study aimed to devise a novel statistical model to quantify the country-level risk of experiencing an importation of MERS case. Methods We analyzed the arrival time of each reported MERS importation around the world, i.e., the date on which imported cases entered a specific country, which was modeled as a dependent variable. both country-specific religion and the incidence data of MERS in Saudi Arabia were used to improve our model prediction. ERS importations, especially when computationally intensive large-scale transmission models may not be immediately applicable, could have been benefited from the particularly low transmission of the MERS coronavirus."}
