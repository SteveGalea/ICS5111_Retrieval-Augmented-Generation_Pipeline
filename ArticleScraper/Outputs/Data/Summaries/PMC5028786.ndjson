{"summary": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Coronavirus. it causes vomiting and wasting disease in suckling piglets. the virus has a strong tropism for the upper respiratory tract and is propagated through the neural route. a PHEV field strain was isolated from the brain tissue of infected piglets. the major structural proteins of the strain were sequenced to identify genetic relationships with other coronaviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus. at the time of the outbreak, these pigs had not been immunized with any PHEV vaccines. the supernatant was centrifuged at 3,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-m syringe filter. was used as inoculums for BALB/c mice or for virus isolation in neuro-2a cell culture. mice in group 1 were inoculated with the original filtered brain tissue. mice in group 2 were inoculated with HEV 67N (GenBank: AY048917) in the same manner. the mice in the third group formed a negative control group. in 5% CO2, the cells were washed 3 times, and 2% DMEM was added. the cell cultures were examined daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) the cells and supernatants were harvested together and used as seed stocks for the next passage. the main structural protein genes, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), spike (S), small membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), of PHEV in the original specimen were amplified, cloned and sequenced. all of the primers were designed according the sequence of the HEV 67N genome. sample collection and testing On march 2014, there was an acute outbreak of suspected porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis in suckling pigs on a farm with a total of 502 sows in Changchun, Jilin province, china. the total proportion of deaths in piglets that had not been weaned was 46.7% (140 dead piglets) PHEV TACTGAAACCATTACCACT AY078417.1 56 HE 509 CTATAACTATGACCGCGAC PEDV GAAATAACCAGGGTCGTGGA DQ355221.1 55.3 N 492 GCTCACGAACAGCCACA TEGV GATGGCGACCAGATAGAAGT AF302264.1 58 N 612. hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed. the permission to work with laboratory animals was obtained from the Animal Welfare Ethical Committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, china. all of the mice experiments were carried out at Bio-Safety Level 2 facilities at the Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Ministry of Education, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, China. the cell cultures were clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and then ultracentrifuged at 20,000 g for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. the pellet was resuspended and submitted for virological investigation using electron microscopy. the virus isolate was designated PHEV-CC14. in cell culture were amplified, cloned and sequenced. all of the primers were designed according to the sequence of the HEV 67N genome. the RNA was converted to cDNA by an oligo (dT)-priming strategy. pathological autopsy showed congestion, edema and hemorrhage in brain tissue. none significant histopathological changes were found in other substantive organs. eight of nine brain samples from young nursing pigs on the farms were PHEV positive. histopathologic examination of the piglets was performed on seven infected piglets. samples submitted for histopathologic examination included brains from PHEV-infected piglets and antigen-negative piglets. no PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in negative control group. pathogenicity of HEV 67N and PHEV-CC14 infected mice. all of the infected mice died within a week. immunofluorescent assay in the cerebral cortex showed large numbers of PHEV-positive neurons (red); original magnification, 100. PHEV-positive Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were distributed widely (red); original magnification, 400. PHEV-CC14 strain was successfully isolated and designated as PHEV-CC14. PHEV-CC14-inoculated neuro-2a cells showed normal cells at 4 dpi, 200. mock-inoculated cells showed normal cells at 4 dpi, 200. mock-inoculated neuro-2a cells showed normal cells at 4 dpi. EV 67N-infected cells were inoculated with PHEV-CC14 and HEV 67N. there was no significant difference in replication or proliferation between the PHEV-CC14 strain and HEV-67N strain. these nucleotide changes all induced corresponding amino acid (aa) changes (S12G and T114I in the HE protein; R381H in the S protein; A146T in the M protein) residues in the E and N genes of PHEV-CC14 strains were highly conserved in identity with other PHEV reference strains in the GenBank database. the trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA software, version 6.06. phylogenetic analysis of the five genes showed that the PHEV-CC14 strain clustered into a subclass with a HEV-JT06 strain from China isolated in 2006. eight of nine brain samples from young nursing pigs were PHEV positive. all were negative for PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV, and PRV. pathologic autopsy showed congestion or hemorrhage in brain tissue. a large number of glial cells were aggregated to glial nodules in the infected brains. neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic. neuronophagia was widespread. pathogenicity of HEV 67N and PHEV-CC14 infected mice. infected mice showed typical neurological damage, with symptoms of depression, arched waists, standing and vellicating front claws. all of the infected mice died within a week, and the mice in the control group survived normally. PHEV-positive Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were distributed widely (red); original magnification, 400. the neuro-2a cell monolayer was inoculated with original field and mouse-passaged PHEV-positive samples. at 3 dpi, inoculated cell monolayer showed visible CPE. ining using PHEV monoclonal antibody showed immunofluorescent-positive staining mainly evident in the cytoplasm of infected cells (red), 400. the samples were negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid. the magnification bar in the picture represents 100 nm in length. the PHEV-CC14 strain shared 95%\u201399.2% nt identities with other PHEV strains available in GenBank. the structural genes of the PHEV-CC14 strain had the greatest nucleotide sequence similarity (99.2%) to the HEV-JT06 strain.

PHEV strains currently circulating in china are closely related to the emerging PHEV-CC14 strains. the strain was most closely related to the emerging PHEV-CC14 strains. this suggests that they could be derived from a similar ancestral strain. compared with HEV 67N, there were two amino acids (S12G, T114I) in the HE protein of PHEV-CC14 that were meaningful mutations. six amino acid variations were observed (S12G, S15G, K49N, T114I, V116A, L161F) the permission to work with laboratory animals was obtained from the Animal Welfare Ethical Committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, China (permission number 2012-CVM-12).
