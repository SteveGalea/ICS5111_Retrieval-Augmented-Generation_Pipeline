{"summary": "PDCoV is an emerging swine enteric virus that causes diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death in nursing piglets. co-infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was common in infected piglets. PDCoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome about 25.4 kb. the two opening reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1ab, occupy almost two-thirds of its genome. the other one-third encodes two polymerase proteins, pp1a and pp1ab, respectively, which are proteolytically cleaved into 15 mature non-structural proteins. mutations in the S gene of PEDV-LY4-98 resulted in increased pathogenicity to neonatal piglets [29]. the S protein is highly immunogenic, making it a useful target for the development of effective vaccines against coronavirus [30]. cells and antibodies LLC porcine kidney cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. the rabbit anti-PDCoV N monoclonal antibody was prepared in our laboratory. the flasks were subjected to three cycles of and thawing then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. supernatants were collected and stored at 80 \u00b0C. RT-PCR/qRT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from PDCoV-infected LLC-PK cell cultures using a UNlQ-10 Column TRIzol Total RNA Isolation Kit (Sangon, China), then was subjected to RT-PCR/qRT-PCR using primers specific to the S and M gene of the PDCoV. amplification conditions were 98 \u00b0C for 5 min, then 32 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 30 s the primer sets were designed using the CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 sequence as a template. the quantity of PDCoV RNA was calculated based on the standard curve and expressed as copies per milliliter of cell culture. s were mapped to the known porcine deltacoronavirus strain CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 and assessed using the quality control tool FastQC. Sequence alignment, based on the complete genome of the PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 and the 59 available strains deposited in GenBank, was performed using iTOL. three challenged piglets and one control piglet were necropsied at 5 days post-infection (dpi), the remaining piglets were necropsied at 8 dpi. experiments were performed in triplicate. cells and Antibodies LLC porcine kidney cells (LLC-PK) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. the rabbit anti-PDCoV N monoclonal antibody was prepared in our laboratory. the flasks were subjected to three cycles of and thawing then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. supernatants were collected and stored at 80 \u00b0C.

Analysis of deletions and insertions in the complete genome of PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015. phylogenetic and recombination analysis of PDCoV Strain CHN-SC2015 was based on sequences of the complete genome and the S gene of CHN-SC2015 and the 59 reference strains. PDCoV CHN-SC2015 clustered with CHN-HG-2017; there is a 3-bp deletion in CHN-HG-2017 and also present in CHN-SC2015. the predicted recombination breakpoints in CHN-SC2015 are located between nucleotides 6020 and 7069, the region encoding nsp3 and nsp4. potential recombination events were identified using Recombination Detection Program 4. the five-day-old piglets were inoculated orally with PDCoV CHN-SC2015 passage 12 and DMEM. clinical signs were observed daily, and diarrhea was scored for challenged piglets. the PDCoV N protein was detected in sections of jejunum by immunofluorescence staining. piglets infected with PDCoV CHN-SC2015 were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the different colors of arrows and boxes indicated the typical histological lesion. piglets were infected with PDCoV CHN-SC2015. viral shed in feces was quantitated daily from two or three of the challenged piglets. no PDCoV RNA was detected in the control swine. porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) [38], swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), [39] and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) [40] are also major pathogens of diarrheal disease in swine. coexistence of pathogens, such as PDCoV and PEDV, PDCoV and PoRV, increase the mortality rate of infected PDCoV infects cells of galline and human origin, such as galline hepatoma, DF-1 fibroblast, human hepatoma, and Hela cells. a 3-nt deletion in the S gene is found in other Chinese isolates but not in the USA, Japan, South Korea, or Southeast Asia. the amino acid mutation at position 162 is a glycosylation site located on the surface of amino-terminal domain within the S protein. the lack of glycosylation at this site may hinder the virus\u2019 ability to evade the host\u2019s immune response because of the lack of glycan shielding of S protein epitopes. a recombination analysis predicted that CHN-SC2015 had undergone recombination with strain SHJS/SL/2016 from the China and TT_1115 from Vietnam. the predicted breakpoint is located in the nsp3 gene, which is similar to the strain CHN-HG-2017. the pathogenicity of PDCoV to piglets has become a focus of investigation. PDCoV CHN-SC2015 infection leads to a low score of diarrhea from 6 DPI. this is also true for PEDV, which can disseminate from the nasal cavity to the intestinal mucosa. this is the first PDCoV strain isolated from southwest china."}
