PCR mixture (25 l) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.01% gelatin) mixtures were amplified in 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 10 min. standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination. RT-qPCR was performed on samples positive for novel picornaviruses. cDNA was amplified by thermal Cyler FastStart DNA Master reagent kit. cDNA was amplified with 20-l reaction mixtures containing FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit. RNA was converted to cDNA by a combined sequence-specific-priming, random-priming and oligo (dT) priming strategy. initial results showed that the two novel picornaviruses are distantly related to known picornaviruses. the cDNAs of three initial strains were amplified using the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit. the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, and the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site, Ka, for each coding region between different strains of rosavirus B and C were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in MEGA 5.0 as described previously [68]. antigen-antibody interaction was detected with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL fluorescence system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) viral cultures Eleven samples tested positive for novel picornaviruses were subject to virus isolation in various cell lines. immunoostaining and electron microscopy performed on 3T3 cells successfully infected by rosavirus C RASM14A. samples were examined with a Philips EM208s electron microscope. mice were infected orally (4-day-old) and intracerebrally (1-day-old) necropsies of mice were performed to obtain the following tissues: intestine, spleen, kidney, liver, lung and brain. guinea pig antiserum against the VP1 protein of rosavirus C was produced by subcutaneously injecting 100 g purified recombinant rosavirus C VP1 protein to three guinea pigs. three inoculations at once every two weeks per guinea pig were administered. sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with 1:2000 dilution of guinea pig anti-VP1 anti-serum, followed by 30 min at room temperature with 1:2000 dilution of biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig. sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. the mice challenge experiment was approved by CULATR, HKU (CULATR 2545\u201311) and the government of the HKSAR under the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance, Chapter 340. the mice were anesthetized by fetanyl/fluanisone/diazepam during the whole experiment. samples from street rodents in urban areas of Hong Kong were collected immediately after euthanasia as routine policies for disposal of captured rodents. RNA extraction Viral RNA was directly extracted from the respiratory and alimentary samples in viral transport medium using Viral RNA mini kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) the reaction mixture (10 l) contained RNA, first-strand buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2), 5 mM DTT, 50 ng random hexamers, 500 M of each dNTPs and 100 U Superscript III reverse transcriptase. the mixtures were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 50\u00b0C for 60 min and 70\u00b0C for all the 2450 respiratory and alimentary tract samples were re-tested using specific RT-PCR assays to enhance the sensitivities for detection of novel picornaviruses. the PCR assays were targeted to a 253 bp (5\u2019- ATGCTCCTGTTCTCATGCTTTT -3\u2019 and 5\u2019- GAAAATCTCTGGGTCAGGGGTGAA -3\u2019) fragment and a 243-bp (5\u2019- TGTTCTCT cDNA was amplified by Thermal Cycler 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) with 20-l reaction mixtures containing FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit (Roche) plasmid containing target sequence was used for generating standard curves. RNA was converted to cDNA by a combined sequence-specific-priming, random-priming and oligo (dT) priming strategy. the nucleotide (nt) sequences of the genomes were compared to those of known picornaviruses. the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the open reading frames were compared to those of known picornaviruses. western blot analysis was carried out using available rodent sera. the purified (His)6-tagged recombinant VP1 protein was loaded into each well of a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)\u201310% polyacrylamide gel. the mixtures were added to 24-well tissue culture plates by adsorption inoculation. after 1 h of adsorption, excess inoculum was discarded and the wells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and replaced by serum-free MEM. culture lysates were collected for RT-PCR for monitoring viral replication. uckling balb/c mice were infected orally (4-day-old) and intracerebrally (1-day-old) Approximately 200l (500 TCID50) of virus suspensions was applied orally and 30l (100 TCID50) intracerebrally. two mice challenged with culture media from uninfected cells were included as negative controls. nine/ten, five, three and three mice were sacrificed at day 3, 7, 14 and 21 respectively. in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) cell lines and tissues from challenged mice tested positive for rosavirus C RASM14A by RT-PCR were subject to viral load studies and immunohistochemical staining for viral VP1 protein as described previously [28, 69]. the collection of rodent samples was approved by the Committee on the use of live animals in teaching and research (CULATR), the University of Hong Kong (CULATR 2284\u201310) and the Department of health, the Government of the HKSAR under the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance."}
