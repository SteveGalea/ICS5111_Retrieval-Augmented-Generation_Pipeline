{"summary": "the innate immune response to viral infection involves the recognition of viral components through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) and the subsequent induction of type I interferons (IFN-/), which trigger the expression of antiviral proteins. PRRs comprise membrane-associated receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and cytosolic receptors, including RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomer TLR3 signals through an adaptor called TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN- (TRIF), while RIG-I and MDA-5 recruit another CARD-containing adaptor. newly synthesized IFN- induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) evasion is that viral gene expression is silenced and the infected cells are therefore invisible to immune responses. several human viruses, including hepatitis C virus (42), vaccinia virus (78), ebola virus (5) and influenza virus (83) have evolved strategies to target and inhibit distinct steps in the early signaling events that lead to type I IFN induction. us11 binds to endogenous RIG-I and MDA-5 and inhibits downstream activation of the RLR signaling pathway. this inhibits downstream activation of the RLR signaling pathway, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-. despite its association with various human health problems, our knowledge of HSV-1 evasion strategies against type I IFN-mediated host immunity is still not complete. Rabbit antisera against IRF3-S396 were described previously. mice anti-Myc (isotype IgG1), and anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were purchased from Roche (Mannheim, Germany) mice monoclonal IgG1 and IgG2b isotype control antibodies were purchased from eBioscience Inc. (San Diego, CA) plasmids include pcDNA3.1-FlagTBK1 and pcDNA3.1/Zeo-MAVS. total RNA was extracted from HEK 293T cells with TRIzol. RNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. all analyses were based on data from one representative of at least three experiments. transfection and dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay. HEK 293T cells (5 106) were cotransfected with 10 g of each of the indicated expression plasmids carrying FLAG, Myc, or HA tags. a 0.5-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 g of the anti-HA MAb, anti-Myc MAb, or anti-Flag MAb or nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody. whole-cell extracts were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. followed by blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline\u2013tween. membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. cells were incubated with rabbit anti-IRF3 pAb (diluted 1:500) or with mouse anti-HA MAb (diluted 1:2,000) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation with tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse the wild-type (WT) HSV-1 F strain and US11 mutant HSV-1 were propagated in Vero cells and titrated as described previously (88). the virus titer was determined by hemagglutination assay using chicken red blood cells. commercial reporter plasmids include NF-B-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) plasmids include NF-B-Luc (21), pcDNA3.1-FlagTBK1 and pcDNA3.1/Zeo-MAVS (64), pcDNA3.1-FlagIKKi (94), pEF-Flag-RIG-I, pEF glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a housekeeping gene to establish a baseline against which target genes were compared between samples. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with 10 g of each of the indicated expression plasmids carrying FLAG, Myc, or HA tags. for each immunoprecipitation, a 0.5-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 g of the anti-HA MAb, anti-Myc MAb, or anti-Flag MAb. samples in native sample buffer (10 g protein, 62.5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, and 1% DOC) were size fractionated by electrophoresis for 60 min at 25 mA. whole-cell extracts were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min. cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-IRF3 pAb (diluted 1:500) or with mouse anti-HA MAb (diluted 1:2,000) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. ELISA for IFN- was carried out with culture supernatants collected from infected cells. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 500 ng of IFN- promoter reporter plasmid p125-luc (A), NF-B-Luc (C), or (pRDIII-I)4-Luc (D), together with an IFN- promoter construct. ectopic expression of US11 significantly inhibited IFN- promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV-HA empty vector or US11-HA expression plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were mock infected or infected with 100 HAU ml1 SeV for 16 h before RT-PCR was performed using GAPDH and IFN- primers. US11 inhibits production of IFN- by blocking IRF and NF-B activation. both wild-type (WT) HSV-1 and a US11 mutant of HSV-1 were employed to test their abilities to inhibit IFN- production induced by SeV by DLR assays. coinfection of US11 mutant HSV-1 showed less inhibition in the mRNA level and protein secretion of endogenous IFN- than that of WT HSV-1. difference between WT HSV-1 and US11 mutant HSV-1 was statistically significant. HEK 293T cells were seeded onto a 35-mm cell culture plate after 24 h. they were mock infected or infected with 100 HAU/ml SeV. at 8 h postinfection, the cells were then mock infected with either WT or US11 mutant HSV-1. 11 recombinant plasmids were constructed previously (89) including US11-EYFP, US11(1-83)-EYFP, US11(84-152)-EYFP, and US11(126-152)-EYFP. overexpression of full-length US11-EYFP blocked activation of IFN- promoter activity. expression of US11(84-152)-EYFP blocked seV-mediated activation. 93T cells were performed as for Fig. 1A to measure the activation of the IFN- promoter following SeV infection in the presence of full-length and deletion mutants of US11. the expression of these mutants was verified by Western blotting using rabbit anti-YFP polyclonal antibody. lysates from cells cotransfected with US11 and RIG-I or MDA-5 plasmids were treated with RNase A prior to immunoprecipitation. lysates from HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-RIG-I or Flag-MDA-5 and then infected with WT HSV-1. no US11 protein was immunoprecipitated by either RIG-I or MDA-5. US11 interacts with both endogenous RIG-I and MDA-5 in transfected cells. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with 10 g of plasmid US11-HA. cells were lysed and clarified supernatants were left untreated. HEK293T cells were infected with pEF-Flag-RIG-I (E) or pEF-Flag-MDA-5 (F) at an MOI of 10 for 16 h. the cells were then lysed, and the extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid pEF-Flag-RIG-IC (E) or pEF-Flag-MDA-5H (F) and with plasmid US11(84-152)-EYFP or pEYFP-N1 respectively. at 24 h after transfection, immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag MAb and nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG2b) and Western 293T cells were cotransfected with US11-HA and either Flag-MDA-5C or Flag-MDA-5H. US11 coimmunoprecipitated with MDA-5H but not with MDA-5C. no detectable EYFP was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Flag MAb. US11 interferes with the interaction between MAVS and RIG-I or MDA-5 during viral infection. 293T cells coexpressing Myc-MAVS and either Flag-RIG-I or Flag-MDA-5 were infected with WT or US11 mutant HSV-1 at an MOI of 10 and then subjected to co-IP analysis using anti-Myc MAb. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids pMyc-MAVS and pEF-Flag-RIG-I (C) or pEF-Flag-MDA-5 (D), respectively. cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays as described for panel A. endogenous IRF3 translocated into the nucleus in more than 90% of cells. ectopic expression of US11 abrogated the nuclear translocation of IRF3. less than 10% of US11-expressing cells displayed nuclear accumulation of IRF3. protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (C) or native PAGE (D) for subsequent analysis with anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser396) (C) or anti-IRF3 (D) antibody. IRF3 and actin as a loading control were also detected. ser 396 is targeted for phosphorylation following virus infection. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 500 ng of IFN- promoter reporter plasmid p125-luc (A), NF-B-Luc (C), or (pRDIII-I)4-Luc (D), together with Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (50 ng) at 24 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or infected with 100 HAU ml1 SeV as indicated. medium from infected cells in panel E was isolated and analyzed by ELISA. the data represent means + standard deviation for three replicates. the activation of IFN- gene transcription depends on synergistic interactions between NF-B, IRFs, and other transcription factors. both wild-type (WT) HSV-1 and a US11 mutant of HSV-1 (which lack US11 expression) (72) were employed to test their abilities to inhibit IFN- production induced by SeV by DLR assays. neither WT HSV-1 nor US11 mutant HSV-1 infection alone stimulated the promoter activity of IFN-. difference between WT HSV-1 and US11 mutant HSV-1 was statistically significant. HEK 293T cells in a 24-cell plate were cotransfected with the IFN- reporter plasmid p125-luc and Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK. HEK 293T cells in a 24-cell plate were mock infected or infected with 100 HAU/ml SeV. at 8 h postinfection, the cells were then mock infected with either WT or US11 mutant HSV-1 at an MOI of 1 for another 16 h. the presence of EYFP in the US11-EYFP fusion protein did not affect the inhibitory activity of US11. the expression of US11(84-152)-EYFP blocked seV-mediated activation. the expression of US11(84-125)-EYFP or US11(126-152)-EYFP only partially inhibited seV-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter. us11 interacts with endogenous RIG-I and MDA-5. it is well established that in response to virus infection, the cytosolic helicases RIG-I and MDA-5 initiate antiviral signaling. both RIG-I and MDA-5 have been found to play a role in IFN- production in response to HSV (69). lysates from cells cotransfected with US11 and RIG-I or MDA-5 were treated with RNase A prior to immunoprecipitation. both RIG-I and MDA-5 were comparably co-IPed with US11 under RNase A treatment. the goal of the subsequent experiment was to determine whether US11 interacts with RIG-I or MDA-5 in the context of a viral infection. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with 10 g of plasmid US11-HA and 10 g of plasmid pEF-Flag-RIG-I. at 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed and clarified supernatants were left untreated or treated with RNase A at 150 g/ml. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid pEF-Flag-RIG-IC (A) or pEF-Flag-RIG-IN (B) containing the carboxyl-terminal domain (aa 218 to 925) and with plasmid US11-HA. plasmid pEF-Flag-MDA-5H (C) containing the carboxyl-terminal helicase domain (aa 287 plasmid pEF-Flag-RIG-IC (E) or pEF-Flag-MDA-5H (F) and with plasmid US11(84-152)-EYFP or pEYFP-N1 respectively. at 24 h after transfection, immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag MAb or nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG2b) was performed. 84-152)-EYFP and either Flag-RIG-IC (Fig. 5E) or Flag-MDA-5H (Fig. 5F) no detectable EYFP was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Flag MAb from cells expressing EYFP and either Flag-RIG-IC (Fig. 5E) or Flag-MDA-5H (Fig. 5F) 293T cells coexpressing Myc-MAVS and either Flag-RIG-I or Flag-MDA-5 were infected with WT or US11 mutant HSV-1 at an MOI of 10. in US11 mutant HSV-1-infected cells, RIG-I and MDA-5 were not immunoprecipitated by MAVS using anti-Myc MAb. US11 blocks formation of complex between RIG-I/MAVS and MDA-5/MAVS. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids pMyc-MAVS and pEF-Flag-RIG-I (C) or pEF-Flag-RIG-I (C) or pEF-Flag-MDA-5 (D), respectively. twenty hours after transfection, cells were infected with either WT or US11 mutant HSV-1 at an MOI of 10 for another 16 h. heLa cells were transfected with the US11-HA expression plasmid or pCMV-HA vector. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were then mock infected or infected with 100 HAU ml1 SeV for 8 h. the phosphorylation state of IRF-3 following virus infection was evaluated by immunoblot analysis using the phospho-specific IRF-3 (S396) antibody. US11 significantly abolished the Ser 396-phosphorylation induced by SeV infection. US11 binds to RIG-I and MDA-5 and inhibits downstream activation of the RLR signaling pathway. these proteins include vaccinia virus E3L (78, 87), VP35 (25), and influenza A virus NS1 (52) proteins. us11-Mut-BAC-Luc virus showed properties identical to those of US11 mutant HSV-1 (data not shown) Interestingly, infection of HEK293T cells with a US11 mutant HSV-1 still downregulated the promoter activity of IFN- induced by SeV. it was previously reported that ICP0 (48, 51, 53, 60) and 34.5 (56, 86) could antagonize type I IFN production. the interaction of both US11 and RIG-I was also verified in a yeast two-hybrid system. also, we also demonstrated that US11 could prevent the formation of the RIG-I/MAVS and the MDA-5/MAVS complexes, which were confirmed following WT and US11 mutant HSV-1 infection. therefore, we speculate that US11 binds to RIG-I and MDA-5 and then inhibits downstream activation of the RLR signaling pathway. antagonism appears to be mediated by two independent mechanisms, one involving sequestration of dsRNA (20) and the second one mediated through an interaction with RIG-I (52). Interestingly, some viruses encode proteins that bind dsRNA and prevent their detection by RIG-I and MDA-5 in the cytoplasm. interaction of the US11 protein with RIG-I may disrupt RIG-I interaction with any of the aforementioned proteins. future work will focus on fine mapping the interaction between RIG-I and US11 in an effort to elucidate the precise mechanism of US11 for antagonizing the host innate antiviral response. the protein binds to RIG-I and MDA-5 and inhibits downstream activation of the RLR signaling pathway. this is the first time that HSV-1 has been demonstrated to interfere with the host antiviral response."}
