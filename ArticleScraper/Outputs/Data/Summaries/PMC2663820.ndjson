{"summary": "around 1.5 billion episodes and 1.5 to 2.5 million deaths annually in children under age five are estimated to be associated with AGE. underlying immunological, physiological and functional deterioration exacerbate severity, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality attributed to diarrheal disease. mortality may exceed 50% in the above 73 years age group in the us. a limited number of reports suggest sapoviruses are less frequently found in cases of AGE than noVs. human astroviruses are reported to have an association with AGE, especially in children. higher rates (39%) have been reported in children less than 1 year old. 'non-specific' amplification method used nuclease digestion to purify virus nucleic acid by exploiting the protection afforded by the virus capsid. DNA produced from such enrichment followed by non-specific amplification should facilitate the sole replication of viral nucleic acid from nucleic acid \u2018soups\u2019 such as feces. a 'known' viral or bacterial pathogen was found in 125/197 (63.5%) of cases. overall a \u2018known\u2019 viral or bacterial pathogen was found in 134/197 (68.0%) of cases. 32% of AGE cases remained without a diagnosis. PCR primers homologous to the DOP-generated sequences were designed to amplify and sequence products from sample W153. each nucleotide was confirmed by a minimum of two sequences from separate PCR reactions for all 5204 nucleotides of the sequence. the sequence of similarly generated product from the second sample from the same patient, W154, was homologous to W153 sequence. the ICTVb criteria for defining a new species in the bocavirus genus is a non-structural gene genetic homology of less than 95%. we propose that the virus detected in sample W153 is not a new strain of the HBoV but rather a new species of Bocavirus (family Parvoviridae subfamily Parvovirinae) the NP1 gene is in an alternate reading frame to VP1 and overlaps the start of VP1 by 13 nucleotides. VP2 is collinear to VP1 and results from initiation of translation at a downstream ATG. the sequence analysis showed the presence of both HBoV2 and HBoV, as well as another novel parvovirus. the genome of this virus from sample W471 was sequenced using specific PCRs incorporating primers homologous to recovered W471 sequence and homologous regions. the alignment of the sequence with other Parvovirinae confirms it is also a bocavirus. NS1 and VP1/2 ORFs show percentage similarity along aligned genomes. recombination sites are indicated by the crossover of the sequence most similar to HBoV3-W471 at positions 200 and 3,000 nucleotides, just upstream of NS1 and VP1/2.

HBoV2 was detected in 11 of these \u2018pathogen negative\u2019 cases. a reduction of cases to 52 (26.4%) represents a 17.5% reduction in the diagnostic gap. HBoV2 was detected throughout 2001, predominantly between January and mid-September. in total, HBoV was detected in 17 case samples (9.1%) compared with 11 controls (5.9%). a bacterial pathogen was isolated in only 9 patients in the first sample tested. a \u2018known\u2019 viral pathogen was found in 125/197 (63.5%) of cases. a total of 43 PCR products were sequenced from the initial sample (W153) and GenBank homology searching (tBLASTx) indicated 38 showed between 46% and 91% amino acid homology to the human bocavirus (HBoV) the remaining sequences showed no sign of significant homology to known viruses. W153 is a member of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae. from this alignment we predict that the sequence spans the entire coding region of the virus genome but lacks up to 100 nucleotides of both terminal regions. the sequence is 23% variant from its closest relative, the HBoV but contains open reading frames (ORFs) for NS1, NP1, VP1 and VP2 proteins. the sequence of the HBoV2-W153 strain has been deposited in GenBank (designated HBoV2-W153, accession number EU082213) Approximately 100\u2013200 nucleotides are absent from each termini of the HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV3 genomes. oV 640 220 672 543 Pairwise dissimilarity HBoV2-W153 to HBoV2-W208 0.05 (0) 0.3 (0) 0.06 (0) HBoV2-W153 to HBoV st1 25.8 (22.4) 22.7 (29.8) 21.2 (19.3) 23.1 (21.6) HBoV2-W153 to HBoV3-W471 24.2 (23.1) 21.2 (29.7) 12.3 (9. to the virus in sample W471, we have assigned the name human Bocavirus species 3 (HBoV3; GenBank EU918736) the unusual pattern of similarity for HBoV3 seen in Table 1 suggests that HBoV3 might be the result of an ancestral recombination event between HBoV and HBov2. this confirmed that two recombination sites are present, immediately upstream of both NS1 and VP1/2 ORFs. 186 matched case control pairs were used for the statistical analysis of the association of viruses with disease. the mean age of the 186 cases was 2.7 years, median age 1.7 years, age range 1 day to 17.6 years. one hundred and twenty-two of the cases were male. value 0.007 0.7 0.0001 0.01 0.1 0.2 0.02 1.0 0.1 68 (36.6%) 15 (8%) OR (CI) 2.6 (1.2\u20135.7) 1.3 (0.3\u20136.3) 72 (12.5\u20132883) 2.4 (1.2\u20135.0) 1.7 (0.9\u20133.6) 1.6 (0.7\u20133.9) 1.7 (1.1\u2013355) 1.0 (0.2\u20134.4) 0.2 (0.004\u20131.8) rotavirus, HBoV2, adenovirus and astrovirus are all associated in the pooled univariant analysis. a pathogen could not be detected in 63 of cases (32.0%) prior to screening for HBoV2. HBoV2 was detected throughout 2001, predominantly between January and mid-September. the virus sequence from sample W208, designated HBoV2-W208, was extended using the same primer sets as used to rederive HBoV2-W153, to recover 5156 nucleotides (99.9% similar to HBoV2-W153), encompassing the complete encoding region but also missing the termini (GenBank accession EU082214). genetic homology alignments place both HBoV2 and HBoV3 in the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae. HBoV2 is 23% variant from HBoV, its closest previously known relative. level of dissimilarity to HBoV is maintained for HBoV2 across the coding regions at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. the family Parvoviridae are among the smallest viruses measuring 18 to 26 nm, unenveloped, with an icosahedral capsid. other parvoviruses, such as canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia virus, are associated with gastroenteritis or enteric disease of their natural host. HBoV2, at 17.2%, was the third most prevalent virus after rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%), and was greater than that for noV GII (3.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%). two further factors may be influencing the prevalence rates for HBoV2 we have detected in both cases and controls. a limited sample dilution analysis with current assays have indicated viral loads range from 100 to at least 1011 DNA copies per gram of feces. however, a limited sample dilution analysis with current assays, for which the sensitivity has not been quantitatively assessed, have indicated viral loads range from 100 to at least 1011 DNA copies per gram of feces. fecal samples from prospectively enrolled cases were collected only during one quarter of the enrolment period. over 75% of the cases were unmatched. this is the first such study to do so with prospectively enrolled cases. HBoV2 may be associated with diseases other than AGE. despite addition of HBoV2 to the list of proven and probable causes of viral gastroenteritis, 25% of cases in this study remain undiagnosed. one or two faecal samples were collected from cases within 72 hours of enrolment but only a single sample from controls. samples were screened for bacteria (microscopy and culture), parasites (microscopy) and viruses rotavirus and enteric adenovirus by antigen capture immunoassay [41] and caliciviruses and astrovirus by RT-PCR [17] d and 0.5 ml of a 10% suspension in phosphate buffered saline was prepared for each and microfuged (13,000 rpm; 15 mins) to remove solids. each supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 nm bacterial filter, digested with nucleases [30] and virions pelleted (28,000 rpm 2 hr, Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) each supernatant was bacterial colonies were picked directly into PCR mix (25 l) containing 1 GeneAmp PCR buffer (ABI), 2 mM MgCl2(ABI), 0.2 mM dNTPs (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold (ABI), and M13 universal forward and reverse primers (50 pmol each, Invitrogen) the genome sequence was rederived using specific primer sets spanning the genome to PCR amplify and sequence the viral DNA directly from the index fecal specimen. additional complete parvovirus sequences obtained from GenBank were as follows. nested consensus diagnostic PCR DNA was extracted from 100 l of a 10% fecal specimen using the RNeasy Mini Kit system (QIAGEN) the recently published sequence of HBoV2 (FJ170280) was also used in genome similarity comparisons. amplification products were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis. products of the predicted size were sequenced using Big Dye 3 terminator chemistry (ABI) to confirm sequence identity. study was approved by th je Research Ethics Committees of the women's and children's hospital (WCH) and the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) prospective enrolment was offered to patients presenting to the WCH in Adelaide, South Australia. caliciviruses and astroviruses have been previously assessed in prospective case control studies. the prevalence of bacteria and parasites was determined for the cases only. insufficient controls were available to permit sex matching. the DOP 25-mer oligonucleotide primer consists of a 3\u2032 four base anchor region which binds to both strands of any nucleic acid at approximately 250 base intervals. in the initial replication cycles, the DOP primer 5\u2032 tag region of 15 specific bases does not participate in the binding. this sequence becomes incorporated at the termini of the amplified product. gCl2(ABI), 0.2 mM dNTPs (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold (ABI), and M13 universal forward and reverse primers (50 pmol each, Invitrogen) were used to amplify the DNA inserts. PCR products were assessed by gel electrophoresis and reactions containing single DOP amplicons of length greater than 250 nucleotides were sequenced PCR DNA was extracted from 100 l of a 10% (vol/vol) fecal specimen using the RNeasy Mini Kit. the recently published sequence of HBoV2 (FJ170280) was also used in genome similarity comparison. several primers were chosen to amplify HBoV2 and HBoV sequence. the primers were then tested in a variety of relevant combinations. extracted nucleic acid (2.5 l) was added to the primary amplification mix. after 15 min activation at 94\u00b0C, 40 cycles of amplification (94\u00b0C for 30 secs, 52\u00b0C for 30 secs, 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min) were performed. negative samples included in each batch to monitor for false positive reactions."}
