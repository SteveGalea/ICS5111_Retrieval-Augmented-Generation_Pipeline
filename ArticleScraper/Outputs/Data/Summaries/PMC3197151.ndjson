{"summary": "s2m has been found in the 3\u2032 end of the genomes of viruses belonging to different RNA virus families. all avastroviruses identified to date, except Turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) harbour s2m. only few picornaviruses have been identified to date harbouring s2m. noroviruses belong to the family Caliciviridae, which has a genome organization similar to astrovirus. the primary structure of s2m consists of 43 nucleotides and the secondary structure is predicted to form a basal stem of 6\u20138 base pairs. about 75% of the s2m sequence is absolutely invariant between viral species. s2m may bind to one or more factors in the host's translational machinery. the virus could thus hijack this machinery for its own purpose. it is possible that the Nsp9 protein in SARS coronavirus can bind to s2m. s2m is important for both the protein synthesis and replication. the presence of s2m in several branches of mamastrovirus could be due to the presence of the motif being lost in several branches. s2m is located 40\u2013200 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail, either completely or partially in their untranslated region. s2m is an extremely conserved motif, but is an ideal target for identification of the viruses harbouring it. cloacal and tracheal swabs were sampled by a hunter from 9 wood pigeons shot during hunting season in Akershus, in 2005. swabs were placed in tubes containing virus transport medium, and kept at 20\u00b0C until analysis. 41 feral pigeon samples were randomly selected. the primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. the cloacal and tracheal swabs were pooled together. cDNA synthesis was performed using a two-step RT-PCR. five l cDNA were amplified using hotStarTaq DNA polymerase kit. the primers used were s2m-p (0.5 M) and Blend (0.25 M) the concentration of Mg2+ in the reaction was 1.5 mM. software used for sequence analysis was Sequencher version 4.1.4 (Gene Codes Corporation; http://www.genecodes.com), and FASTA similarity search. PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit v3.1. all PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit v3.1. cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) RT reaction was performed in a thermocycler at 50\u00b0C for 45 min. followed by an inactivation step at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. primers were designed to amplify 493 bp in 3\u2032 end of picornavirus RNA in pigeons. cloacal and tracheal swabs from the 9 wood pigeons were taken post-mortem from each bird, and kept at 70\u00b0C until analysis. RNA isolation and RT-PCR for s2m screening RNA was isolated with QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA mini kit. five l cDNA were amplified using a 50 l PCR. the concentration of Mg2+ in the reaction was 1.5 mM. amplification programme consisted of an initial 15 min step at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles with 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 40 s. RNA isolated from the cell supernatant was used as a positive control in all RT-PCR set-ups. negative controls consisted of RNase/DNase-free water. all PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit v3.1. an alternative strategy to 5\u2032 RACE and primer walking was used for further viral sequence characterization. nucleotide or amino acid sequences were calculated by BioEdit version 5.0.9. hypothetical polyprotein cleavage sites in the picornaviruses were determined by the NetPicoRNA server version 1.0. generic primers were designed in conserve areas of genes and used to amplify and sequence larger fragments. the concentrations of primers in the reaction were 0.5 M, and the concentration of Mg2+ was 1.5 mM. the amplification programme consisted of an initial 15 min step at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles with 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 60 s. the amplification programme consisted of an initial 15 min step at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles with 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 60 s. a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 5 min was performed, followed by chilling to 8\u00b0C.

NS = no significant alignment. sapeloviruses have a leader protein sequence prior to their capsid protein regions. enterovirus encodes two proteases, 2A and 3C, while in aphthovirus, protein L and 3C are proteases. the 2A protein in enterovirus is a trypsin-like protease. the 3D protein is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. the IRES of PiPV-B lacked the polypyrimidine tract located 25 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon in picornavirus IRES types I-III. domain II in PiPV-B consisted of 62 nucleotides, and lacked the GAA and AGUA motifs present in almost all IRES type IV elements, except for PEV A. both PiPV-A and PiPV-B harboured two adjacent s2m, called (s2m)2, in their 3\u2032 UTR. astroviruses from feral pigeon and one from wood pigeon were selected for further characterization. the astrovirus isolates from feral pigeon shared 70\u201371% amino acid identity in ORF2 with each other. the amino acid identity between feral pigeon and the wood pigeon astrovirus was 54\u201356%. phylogenetic trees for astrovirus were constructed based on alignment of the putative amino acid sequences encoded by ORF1b and ORF2. porcine astrovirus, canine astrovirus, feline astrovirus or ANV-2. the trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method. the trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method. in astrovirus, the 3\u2032 UTR range from 58 nucleotides in human astrovirus MLB1 to 305 nucleotides in ANV-1. the pigeon astroviruses contains a 3\u2032 UTR of 255\u2013287 nucleotides, where the s2m motif is found. the novel pigeon picornaviruses (PiPV) were found in 30% of the pigeons tested phylogeny and comparisons with other picornaviruses showed that overall the PiPV-B polypeptides were most closely related to those of the sapeloviruses. the sapeloviruses share 52% amino acid sequence identity with Duck picornavirus in the 3D region. the amino acid sequences of these polypeptides in PiPV-B share none or very little sequence similarity with the corresponding polypeptides in sapeloviruses. DPV, PEV-A and SPV-1 also have very divergent 2A, 2B and 3A polypeptides. the identified feral pigeon astrovirus is a novel avastrovirus clearly distinct from other known astroviruses. it has 87% and 44% amino acid identity to other known astroviruses in the ORF1b and ORF2 regions, respectively. tV-1, TAstV-2, ANV and chicken-origin astroviruses detected in different regions were highly diverse. phylogenetic analysis revealed no clear assortment by geographic region or isolation date. distances between both the polymerase and the capsid sequences of the feral pigeons were comparable to the distance between the HAstV-1 to HAstV-8 types. s2m in picorna- and coronaviruses is located entirely within the 3\u2032 UTR. norovirus is located partially in the minor capsid complex (ORF3) and partially in the 3\u2032 UTR. the wide range of viruses harbouring s2m suggest its function is not by interaction with virus proteins. the novel picornaviruses were all found in the cloacal swabs of the sampled animals. the high prevalence of viruses harbouring s2m and multiple RNA viruses suggested a favourable condition for recombination between unrelated viruses. one of the pigeons simultaneously shedding 3 different s2m-harbouring viruses (corona-, picorna- and astrovirus) both novel picornaviruses harboured two adjacent s2m, called (s2m)2. this could suggest a possible increased functional effect of this motif. (s2m)2 has previously been observed in one bat astrovirus."}
