{"summary": "group A Streptococcus (GAS), a strict human pathogen, has served as a powerful model organism for studying epidemic bacterial disease (1\u20133) for approximately 100 years, GAS strains have been categorized on the basis of serologic diversity caused by amino acid changes in the amino terminus of an antiphagocytic cell surface molecule known as M protein (4). advances in DNA sequencing now allow delineation of key molecular events responsible for generating new epidemic-producing clones nga and slo genes may play a critical role in M1 epidemicity. nga and slo genes are significantly higher in epidemic strains than in pre-epidemic strains. nga and slo genes are significantly higher in epidemic strains than in pre-epidemic strains. two SNPs are located in the \u201335 to \u201310 spacer region of the nga promoter. the third SNP of interest (G in epidemic strain MGAS2221 and A in pre-epidemic strain SF370) is located at nucleotide 989 in nga. the sum of the data is fully consistent with our hypothesis. pre-epidemic and epidemic strains lack polymorphisms in regulatory genes known to influence virulence, such as covRS, ropB, and mga. all 5 differentially regulated genes were located in the 36-kb region of recombinational replacement. these genes include nga, ifs, slo, and two small genes of uncertain function. nga, ifs, and slo comprise a single transcription unit (17) nga, ifs, and slo transcripts were upregulated to an equivalent magnitude, consistent with the genes being expressed from a single polycistronic transcript (15\u201317). insertional inactivation of a hypothetical negative regulator or acquisition of an unknown trans-acting positive regulator could cause a temporal shift in SPN-producing phenotype. we analyzed the 3,615 genome sequences for polymorphisms in the upstream promoter region of the nga gene that, in principle, could alter gene expression. despite geographic origin, all epidemic strains had the same allele (SNPs G-22T and T-18C) located in the promoter. generation of the G-22T and T-18C SNPs together in parental strain MGAS2221 significantly decreased the transcript level of nga and slo. transcript levels of nga and slo made by isoallelic mutant strain nga(G-22T/T-18C) and strain SF370 (which naturally contains these two polymorphisms) did not differ significantly. the transcript levels of nga and slo in mutant strain nga(T-18C) were significantly decreased to a significantly greater magnitude (Figure 3B). introducing the G989A SNP into the nga-coding region did not affect nga and slo transcript levels. isoallelic mutant strains with downregulated levels of SPN and/or SLO activity were significantly attenuated in virulence compared with wild-type reference strain MGAS2221. however, there were no significant differences in virulence among the mutant strains relative to each other or strain SF370. nga/slo mutant strain secretes an intermediate level of SPN and SLO. correspondingly had an intermediate histopathology phenotype. survival curves for mice (n = 10 per strain) inoculated intramuscularly. vs. nga(G-22T/T-18C), repeated-measures 1-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s post test. we measured the number of CFUs present in infected hind limbs. the bacterial loads in mice infected with single-SNP mutant strains nga(G-22T) and nga(T-18C/G989A) were significantly lower than in mice infected with wild-type strain MGAS2221. an isoallelic mutant GAS strain that overexpresses NADase and SLO is significantly more virulent than MGAS2221 in a mouse model of necrotizing fasciitis. an isoallelic mutant GAS strain that overexpresses NADase and SLO is significantly more virulent than MGAS2221. at 3 hours, the isoallelic mutant strain overexpressing SPN and SLO exhibited significantly greater survival than wild-type parental strain MGAS2221. animals infected with wild-type strain MGAS2221 had the highest levels of nga and slo transcripts in vivo. wild-type strain MGAS2221 had the highest capacity to resist PMN-mediated killing. survival of mutant strains nga(G-22T/T-18C), nga(T-18C) and nga(G989A) decreased to similar levels. cynomolgus macaques (n = 4 per strain) were inoculated in the upper respiratory tract with epidemic parental strain MGAS2221 or triple-SNP isoallelic mutant strain nga(G-22T/T-18C/G989A) the cynomolgus macaques closely mimics human-GAS molecular interactions. invasive infections caused by serotype M89 GAS increased substantially in frequency over the last 15 years. to test this idea, we sequenced the promoter region upstream of nga in all 866 strains deposited in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Isolate Bank. serotype M89 strains with this promoter spacer region variant increased substantially. all M89 strains lack the \u201cG989A\u201d SNP in nga gene that inactivates the NADase activity of SPN. variation in the nga promoter is the only factor that affects production of secreted NADase and SLO activity of M89 strains. event has triggered an intercontinental epidemic of infections caused by serotype M89 GAS. data are from comprehensive population-based studies in the us, Finland, and Iceland. three nga promoter variants in the M89 strains. serotype M89 strains with variant 3 nga promoter (clade-3 strains) emerged very recently from a single precursor cell and spread rapidly intercontinentally. in this regard, we note that the pre-epidemic and epidemic strains have caused a substantial increase in infections in recent years in Canada, new Zealand, Lebanon, and many areas of Europe. core chromosomal genes were differentially transcribed between the two strain groups in early logarithmic growth phase (12) RNA-Seq analysis detected 5 differentially expressed genes, confirming previous expression microarray findings of very limited gene transcript differences between pre-epidemic and epidemic strains. cells were harvested at OD600 values of 1.0 and 1.8. MGAS strain collection strain designations are given above the growth curves in blue for pre-epidemic strains and in red for epidemic strains. a genomic rearrangement that affects expression of the slo gene also has been reported. we interrogated the 3,615 genomes for polymorphisms in the upstream promoter region of the nga gene that, in principle, could alter transcription. insertional inactivation of a hypothetical negative regulator or acquisition of an unknown trans-acting positive regulator could cause a temporal shift in SPN-producing phenotype. strain is located at the root of the phylogenetic tree branch, giving rise to all new epidemic M1 strains. mutated strain MGAS2221 significantly decreased the level of nga and slo transcripts made by the mutated strain. mutant strains from strain MGAS2221 contain either G-22T or T-18C individually. transcript levels of nga and slo in mutant strain nga(T-18C) decreased to a significantly greater magnitude (Figure 3B) the amount of immunoreactive SPN and SLO in the culture supernatant was not influenced by the G989A SNP in the nga-coding region. the presence of G-22T and T-18C SNPs in the promoter spacer region abolished SPN and SLO activity. however, this amino acid replacement did not alter SLO activity. strains were significantly attenuated in virulence compared with wild-type reference strain MGAS2221. compared with wild-type reference strain MGAS2221, the isoallelic mutant strains caused markedly smaller gross lesions at the hind limb injection site. resistance to bactericidal activity of purified human PMNs was assessed with a suspension phagocytosis assay using PMNs from 6 donors. survival data are expressed as the mean SEM. strain MGAS2221, nga (G-22T/T-18C), Nga/Slo-OE (overexpressing) and Nga/Slo-DE (nucleotide deletion) increased nga and slo transcript, resulting in increased production of secreted SPN and SLO toxins. strain was constructed by inserting strong constitutive promoter of the GAS tufA gene directly upstream. isoallelic mutant strain overexpressing SPN and SLO exhibited significantly greater survival than wild-type parental strain MGAS2221. animals infected with wild-type strain MGAS2221 had the highest levels of nga and slo transcripts in vivo. nga and slo transcript levels in triple-SNP mutant strain nga(G-22T/T-18C/G989A) were not statistically different from those of double-SNP mutant strain nga(G-22T/T-18C/G989A) wild-type strain MGAS2221 had the highest capacity to resist PMN-mediated killing. pre-epidemic reference strain SF370 was significantly less virulent than epidemic reference strain MGAS2221 in nonhuman primate models of pharyngitis and necrotizing fasciitis. however, because strains SF370 and MGAS2221 have many genetic differences other than the 3 target SNPs, we could not conclude that these SNPs are sufficient to recapitulate all differences in virulence. invasive infections caused by serotype M89 GAS increased substantially in frequency over the last 15 years. invasive infections caused by upregulation of nga and slo cytolytic toxin-encoding genes underpinned the contemporary serotype M1 epidemic. serotype M89 strains with this promoter spacer region variant increased substantially in frequency commensurate with the upsurge in M89 infections in Finland, Iceland, and the us. slo may have contributed to the very recent upsurge in M89 infections in these disparate countries. clade-1, clade-2, and clade-3 have a unique nga promoter region sequence. all clade-1 strains have variant 1 promoter region, and all clade-3 strains have variant 3 promoter region. an analogous molecular event has triggered an intercontinental epidemic of infections caused by serotype M89 GAS. geneome analysis of all 1,125 M89 strains found no other mechanism to account for increased SPN and SLO production. only a small minority of the epidemic clade-3 strains have polymorphisms in transcriptional regulators that can potentially alter expression levels of nga and slo. a common theme in pathogen emergence is introduction of an existing strain into a new susceptible host species (species \u201cjump\u201d) (30\u201333) new viruses are sometimes generated by recombinational reassortment. however, identification of precise molecular genetic events and pathogenic mechanisms that lead to pathogen strain emergence generally has been an elusive goal in infectious disease research. all serotype M89 strains have an nga allele encoding enzymatically active NADase. the key event in spurring the M89 epidemic was increased transcription of the nga, ifs, and slo operon caused by the promoter-region SNPs. the key molecular event for both M1 and M89 epidemics was recombinational replacement of a segment of chromosomal DNA with SNPs. increased production of SPN and SLO is an elegant mechanism to create pathogens that are especially adept at transmitting dynamically in epidemic waves throughout the human population. the same molecular process has triggered two distinct epidemics indicates that production of SPN and SLO must bestow on the pathogen a substantial selective advantage and survival premium. the nga, ifs, and slo region from a donor GAS strain is introduced into a recipient of a different M protein serotype. this would enhance the probability that the recombinant cell might gain a foothold in the human host and spread throughout the population. our findings have implications for basic, clinical, and translational research. Strain nga(G989A) has a nonsynonymous mutation in the nga-coding region. nga/slo is an nga, ifs, and slo deletion mutant. two analogous isoallelic mutant strains were also derived from MGAS26844. double-SNP strain nga(G-22T/T-18C) was introduced into the \u201310 and \u201335 spacer region of the MGAS2221 nga promoter by overlap-extension PCR. primers ngapro1 and ngapro4 were used to amplify a 1,097-bp fragment of the MGAS2221 chromosome containing the 5\u2032 end of nga and its upstream promoter flanked by B the resultant linear amplicon was circularized and closed using T4 DNA ligase, column purified, and electroporated into strain MGAS2221. plasmid had integrated via single-crossover homologous recombination adjacent to nga. integrant now contained two copies of the nga promoter region. inside-out PCR was used to introduce these SNPs individually into pBBL740-ngapro. phosphorylated primers ngapro5 and ngaproTC were used to introduce SNP T-18C into the nga promoter. the respective PCR products were ligated, purified, and individually electroporated into MGAS2221. the PCR product was digested with BamHI and cloned into strain pBBL740. recombinant plasmid pBBL740-G330D was electroporated into strain MGAS2221. integrants were screened for by PCR and DNA sequencing. the two fragments were fused together by overlap-extension PCR. the PCR product was then digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pBBL740. the recombinant plasmid was then electroporated into strain MGAS2221. primers tuf-nga-1 and tuf-nga-6 were used for inside-out PCR. the PCR product was digested with BamHI and ligated into pBBL740. after overnight incubation, the ligation product was column purified and electroporated into MGAS2221. column-purified PCR product was circularized with T4 ligase and electroporated into emm89 parental strain MGAS26844. allelic exchange was performed as described above. four pre-epidemic and three epidemic invasive serotype M1 GAS strains were analyzed. bacteria were added to RNAprotect (RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent, Qiagen) and centrifuged at 3,220 g for 10 minutes. frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and suspended in 100 l of TE buffer (TE pH 7.0, Ambion) the bacteria were added to tubes containing 0.1-mm silica beads (Lysis matrix B, MP Bio) cDNA library for each sample was produced via 15 cycles of PCR. libraries were quantified fluorometrically with AMPureXP beads.
