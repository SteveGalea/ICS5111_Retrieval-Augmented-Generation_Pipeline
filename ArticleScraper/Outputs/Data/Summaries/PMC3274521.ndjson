{"summary": "GL can be converted into glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide (GAMG) or glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide (GAMG) as an important derivative of GL, GAMG displayed stronger physiological functions than GL such as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor functions, and so on. gene sequence truncation is also investigated for its effects on enzymatic properties. the non-conservative N-terminal domain of the protein phosphatase1 (PP1) showed higher sensitivity to three substrates. but the loss of the C-terminal regulatory domain resulted in a loss of the ability to catalyze the aldol reaction. heparanase is an endo--d-glucuronidase, and its C-terminal region is not an integral part of the TIM barrel domain. only a few genes have been published for GL biotransformation. three fungal strains were cloned in our previous studies. plasmids pMD19-T (TaKaRa, Japan) and pET28a (+) were used as vectors. plasmids pMD19-T (TaKaRa, Japan) and pET28a (+) were used as hosts for plasmid amplification and expression. CCCGACAAACACCTT-3\u2032) and P2(5\u2032-CATGCGGCCGCTTAAGCGCCAAATAGGAAGTATAGT-3\u2032) were designed to obtain the sequence with an intron from the A. terreus Li-20 genome under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min with Ex Tag (T intron(Atgus); L3: the target gene without C-terminal non-conservative sequence[Atgus(-3t)]. supernatant was brought to 70% saturation with (NH4)2SO4. the enzymes expressed by pET28a(+) vector were fused to an N-terminal six-histidine tag and purified via nickel chelate affinity chromatography. the catalytic activity of the enzyme was examined at 30 to 70\u00b0C in 50 mM Na2HPO4-citric acid buffer (pH 7.0) the enzyme activity under the optimal temperature and pH was defined as 100%. the temperature stability of the enzyme was determined by incubating the enzyme samples at different temperatures (45, 55, 65, and 75\u00b0C) 260 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.2 nm using a jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. the response time was 0.125 s with a bandwidth of 1 nm. chemicals and reagents GL was purchased from Xinjiang Tianshan Pharmaceutical Co. (U.S.), whereas GAMG was obtained from the Nanjing University of Technology, China. gene coloning and vector construction An intron in an AtGUS genomic sequence was removed via three-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to express the gene in E. coli BL21. in the second PCR was ligated by T4 DNA ligase after a terminal phosphation with T4 polynucleotide kinase. positive clones were screened in an LB plate with 100 g/mL ampicillin. the primer set containing P1 and P5 was used for AtGUS(-3t) under the same conditions as those of P3 and P4. the reaction mixture consisted of the enzyme and substrate (2 g/L GL) at a 14 (v/v) ratio. the catalytic activity of the enzyme was examined at 30 to 70\u00b0C in 50 mM Na2HPO4-citric acid buffer. the enzyme activity was subsequently determined at the optimum temperature after incubation for 30 min. the catalytic reactions were continuously monitored. the initial velocities were fitted to the equation using the Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab) GHF 2 comprised -galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), -mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25), and -glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31), so the phylogenetic tree was constructed according to it. it showed that the gene cloned was a -glucuronidase gene named AtGUS (Genbank accession No. JF894133), which was found very similar to PGUS ( ogenum GUS: ABU68712; Penicillium canescens GUS: AAV91787; Penicillium canescens GUS: AAV91787; Canis lupus GUS: AAC34593; Thermotoga maritima MSB8 GUS: AAD36143; Kluyveromyces lactis GAL: AAA35265; Bacillus megaterium DSM 319 GAL: CAA04 the E value was obtained by alignment with pfam02837, glycosyl hydrolase family 2, sugar binding domain; b the E value was obtained by alignment with pfam00703, glycosyl hydrolase family 2, TIM barrel domain. both pET28a(+)-AtGUS and pET28a(+)-AtGUS(-3t) were successfully expressed. pET-28a(+)-Atgus(-3t)/BL21 after induced with 0.4 mM IPTG; L5 and L6: purified AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E. the optimal pH for the bioconversion reaction by AtGUS-E was 6.6, whereas that for AtGUS(-3t)-E was 7.0. the enzymatic activity assayed in the absence of metal ions was taken as 100%. the effect of monovalent cations on the two enzymes was similar: the 1 and 5 mM K+ and 1 mM Na+ inhibited the enzymatic activity. g2+ and Mn2+ discretely promoted the activities of AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E. Ca2+ at 5 mM final concentration enhanced the activity of AtGUS-E by 107% but inhibited AtGUS(-3t)-E activity by 61%. atGUS(-3t)-E was increased by 78%, while AtGUS-E was decreased by 40%. recombinant protein Vmax (mol min1 mg1) Km (mM) Kcat (s1) kcat/Km (mM1 s1) AtGUS-E 1.84 12.9 29.0 2.24 AtGUS(-3t)-E 0.97 1.95 13.6 7.16 Structural characterization. the open reading frame of this gene was 1,974 bp ( Figure 2B) the conserved domain database was performed to analyze domains of AtGUS. there were sugar-binding domain, immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domain, and TIM barrel domains in it which all belonged to glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) 2. the scale corresponds to a genetic distance of 0.2 substitution per position (20% difference). the scale corresponds to a genetic distance of 0.2 substitution per position. pET28a(+)-AtGUS and pET28a(+)-AtGUS(-3t)-E were purified through Ni-NTA sepharose. both purified enzymes could hydrolyze GL into GAMG and GA. whole cell of pET-28a(+)-Atgus/BL21 and pET-28a(+)-Atgus(-3t)/BL21 after induced with 0.4 mM IPTG. the optimal pH for the bioconversion reaction by AtGUS-E was 6.6, whereas that for AtGUS(-3t)-E was 7.0. enzymatic activity assayed in the absence of metal ions was taken as 100%. the effect of monovalent cations on the two enzymes was similar. mM K+ and 1 mM Na+ exhibited no apparent affecting effects on the activity of AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E. the divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ discretely promoted the activities of AtGUS-E and AtGUS(-3t)-E. the Km of the recombinant AtGUS(-3t)-E was 1.95 mM, which was approximately one-seventh that of AtGUS-E (12.9 mM) the catalytic efficiency of AtGUS(-3t)-E (7.16 mM s1) was 3.2 folds higher than that of AtGUS-E (2.24 mM s1) -glucuronidase (GUS) gene was first cloned in 1987 [19] and in subsequent years, many GUS genes were cloned and registered in the GenBank. this gene has never been cloned for the hydrolysis research of GL into GAMG or/and GA. the stability of AtGUS(-3t)-E was slightly higher than that of AtGUS-E at 65\u00b0C. similar results have been reported that the modification of the C-terminal region could improve the thermal stability of endo--glucanase from Bacillus subtilis JA18. the deleted region of the AtGUS non-conservative sequence lies outside the main three domains. different methods have been applied in creating new enzyme such as error-prone PCR [26], DNA shuffling [27] and staggered extension process (StEP) [28]."}
