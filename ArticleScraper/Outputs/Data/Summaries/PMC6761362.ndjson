{"summary": "METHODS Care for hospitalized patients with viral respiratory infections was observed in the patient room for over a 2 year period. one trained observer recorded the healthcare activities performed, contacts with fomites, and self-contacts made by healthcare workers. another observer recorded fomite contacts of patients during the encounter using predefined checklists. researchers performed observations inside the patient room during a 3-hour period. one trained observer recorded contacts with fomites in the environment and self-contacts of the patient participant. another recorded fomite contacts by the patient participant during the encounter. self-contact locations by HCWs included mask (if used), head area other than mask, torso, hand, lower body, and personal stethoscope (if used) not all HCWs used a personal stethoscope during the patient encounters. a small number of HCWs participated repeatedly performed different care activities and the number of replicates was small. a total environmental fomite contacts and self-contacts by HCWs were compared between observers using the KW test. omial distribution was the best-fit distribution (Table 1).
