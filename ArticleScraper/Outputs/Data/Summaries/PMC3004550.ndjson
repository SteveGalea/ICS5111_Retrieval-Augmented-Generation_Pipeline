{"summary": "fluorescein-KCl solution was sprayed onto the faces of participants wearing the facemasks and performing intermittent exercises on a treadmill in a climatic chamber. both facemasks A and B had near or over 99% protection efficiency, compared with that of 95.5% to 97% of surgical facemasks. the main way that influenza viruses are spread is from person to person via virus-laden respiratory droplets. these respiratory droplets can then be directly deposited onto the upper respiratory tract of susceptible persons who are near (ie, within 3 feet) the droplet source such as healthcare workers (HCWs) in healthcare environments. the penetration of virions through N95 respirators can exceed an expected level of 5%. the influenza virus is a globular particle with about 0.08\u20130.12 m in diameter. some HCWs were infected with SARS despite wearing full protective equipment. infected human coughs or sneezes, particles of varying sizes are created. particles of varying sizes ranging from large particle droplets (about 100 m in diameter) to small particle droplets (about 0.1 m in diameter) could reach the alveolus of a susceptible host when respiratory protection is not employed. s filter ventilates air and obstructs viruses, and the filter of a typical filtering facemask becomes accordingly both breathing and filtering areas. inhaled air could be contaminated when wearers exhale and inhale during breathing cycles through the filter of a typical filtering facemask. the structure of a typical filtering facemask might be responsible for the incomplete protection of commercially available facemasks in some healthcare occasions. the two types of newly designed facemasks separated breathing pathways from the virus-contaminated areas. mask A and mask B were also made of laminated polypropylene with polyester fabrics and had two exhaust holes situated at its back. ten healthy subjects consented to participate in the study. the surgical facemask was commercially available for use in public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong. the tested surgical facemask was about 0.80 mm thick, and facemasks A and B were about 2.45 and 2.41 mm thick. fluorescein-KCl solution was used to simulate viral aerosols. a piece of 22.5 mm filter paper was affixed at the outer and inner surface of facemasks A and B. participants performed intermittent activities including exercise (E1), rest (R1), exercise (E2), rest (R2), exercise (E3), and rest (R3) on a treadmill at the walking speed of 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4 km/hr. the solutions were tested with the Clinical Flame Photometer 410 C instrument. solutions with the KCl concentration of 0.02%, 0.01%, 0.005%, 0.0025%, 0.0012%, and 0.00062% were prepared. the difference between the two types of facemasks in the relative K+ content (SD) is about 1.25 (0.7)%. based on this data, the required sample size was found to be 10 participants in order to have a P value 5% and a power of 90%. the inhalation valves open to release exhaled air and close during exhalation. fresh air enters into the mask through two inhalation valves. facemask B was also made of laminated polypropylene with polyester fabrics. simulated viral particles were produced by nebulization of a fluorescein-KCl solution with a concentration of 2 mg of KCl and 0.003 mg Fluorescien/cm3 of deionized water. an atomizer was used to generate simulated viral aerosols by spraying the solution. the simulated viral solution was sprayed on the facemasks twice at a distance of 100 cm every 10 minutes. the participants took off the facemask at the end of the experiment. the surgical facemask, face-mask B, and filter paper samples of the outer and inner surface of facemasks were UV scanned. percentages were used as the basis for analysis of the test results for three layers of surgical facemask and facemask B. a study comparing the effects of wearing different kinds of facemasks (N95, surgical, and facemasks A and B) on the ear canal temperature, heart rate, and clothing microclimates was carried out simultaneously. filter papers of facemasks A and B captured 98.9% to 99.9% of the K+ solution. only 0.1% to 1.1% and 0.2% to 0.6% of the K+ solution could penetrate and reach the inner surfaces of facemasks A and B. the actual amount of K+ (mg) was 21.66 and 28.2 mg of K+ on average in the outmost layer of the surgical facemasks and facemasks B. 0.79 and 0.135 mg of K+ were on the innermost layer of the facemasks and facemask B. /holes at back of facemasks were 0.6% to 5.8% and 0.3% to 0.7% (outer layer), 0.3% to 1.5% and 0.1% to 0.4% (middle layer), 0.2% to 0.1% to 0.2% (inner layer) for facemasks A and B. the rated mean values of the answers to \"how do you like the mask\" were 5.4 and 4.8 for facemasks A and B. the front surface of facemask A captured 98.9% to 99.9%. the front surface of facemask B captured 99.4% to 99.8% of the K+ solution. the outmost layer of facemask B had the highest relative K+ contents. at the innermost layer of facemask B, there were only 0.2% to 0.5% of the relative K+ contents. the K+ relative contents of the innermost layer of surgical facemask were 3.0%4.5 %. 92.3% to 98.9% of droplets for facemask A and 99.5% of droplets for facemask B were blocked by the front surface of the facemasks. only 1.1% to 7.7% of droplets for facemask A and 0.5% to 1.3% of droplets for facemask B reached the back of the facemasks. the results showed that the KCL concentrations in the sweat from face and back skin surfaces were much lower than that measured in the layers of the masks. the entire front surfaces of facemask B and most front areas of facemask A and the surgical face-mask were contaminated by simulated drops. there are huge differences in the simulated viral contaminations on the front and back surfaces of facemasks. only 0.5%7.7% of droplets reached the back of the facemasks. a fit test to ensure good fitting can be expected that the protective efficiency of facemasks can be further increased. the transmission of SARS in Toronto was limited primarily to hospitals and households that had contact with patients. these cases highlight and confirm the belief that most communicable respiratory infections are transmitted by large droplets over short distances or through contact with contaminated surfaces. more than 90% of droplets are blocked by the front surface of facemask. only 0.5% to 7.7% of the droplets reach the back of facemask."}
