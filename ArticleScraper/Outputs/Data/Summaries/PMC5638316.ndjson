{"summary": "several methods have been described to define linear (continuous) B cells epitopes (BCEs) of target proteins. this can be broadly classified into four categories: i) chemically synthetic peptide (CSP) and its chip method [1\u20135]; ii) biosynthetic peptide (BSP) by gene fragment expression, phage display random-peptide or antigen-fragment libraries. pXXGST-1 used a truncated GST gene encoding 188 residues (GST188) as carrier in pXXGST-1. it also used enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents in Western blotting for BCE mapping. it is only 6 bp shorter than the 4196 bp product generated by inadequate digestion leading to lower efficiency of constructing recombinant (r-) clones. setting GST188 control was required to screen the r-clone of expressing GST196 (GST188 + 8mer peptide) protein due to the 1 kDa of migration rate difference between both proteins. it also has same trouble for determining self-ligation clone by running SDS-15% poly the GST188-BSP method presented here is simpler and easier to perform, and more cost-effective. we describe the method and its standardized protocol for general laboratory application. unizations of 0.5 mg r-huZP4C227-463 protein in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant were administered at 3-week intervals. plasmids of pXXGST-1 and pXXGST-2 were constructed as described earlier [18] plus Western blotting detection kit, and other general chemicals were obtained from Shanghai Sangon Co., Ltd, China. DNA fragment synthesis and sequencing All gene fragments encoding short peptides of interest were synthesized by the SBS Genetech Co., Ltd,. amH I and Sal I restriction enzymes at their 5\u2019and 3\u2019 ends. they could be directly used to insert into the BamH I and Sal I sites downstream of the GST188 gene in plasmid pXXGST-3. also, a TAA termination codon is designed between each 8/18mer peptide and Sal I site. more than 1000 of the constructed 8/18mer peptide fusion proteins have been successfully expressed by using their DNA fragments from known prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes. however, it should be ascertained whether there is another potential BamH I or Sal I site within the oligonucleotide sequence. the ligation reaction was carried out at 16\u00b0C overnight using the following 15 l of reaction mixture in 0.5 ml tube. all components were mixed by flicking and spin briefly (refrigerated Mikro 120 Centrifuge) it should be observed that there are about 10 to 20 clones on the LB plates next morning. buffer 1.5 l DNA fragment (0.05 mol l-1) 2 l pXXGST-3 vector (0.01 mol l-1) 1 l T4 DNA ligase (350 U l-1) 1.2 l ddH2O up to 15 l Total volume 15 l Step six: Screening of r-clones by running SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel for screening. peptides P115-116 of huZP4;
