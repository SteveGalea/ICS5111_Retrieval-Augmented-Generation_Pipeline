{"summary": "community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) performance measures were favorable for five of the six core measures. moderate-quality evidence actually suggested one-step smoking cessation counseling was contraindicated. this disconnect between core measures and high-quality evidence may partially explain discordance between improving core measures and documented improvements in clinical outcomes. negative results may have resulted from partial inactivation of the surfactant by the aerosol generator, which may explain the lack of oxygenation benefit consistently seen in other studies of pulmonary deposition of surfactant. however, the need for adjunctive or supplemental therapy in addition to antibiotics, to reduce the mortality rate in patients with severe CAP, is once again demonstrated in these trials (8). despite limitations, data from these two studies provide strong evidence against the use of corticosteroids purely for treatment of severe influenza pneumonia. a pattern consistent with corticosteroids in case series of other severe viral pneumonias, such as the avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. no difference in pneumonia risk between fluticasone and budesonide. no difference in need for vasopressors was demonstrated. findings may explain why no increase in all-cause mortality has been seen. both studies used a propensity-to-receive-corticosteroid score to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. both studies excluded patients with other indications for corticosteroids, such as asthma or acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. inhaled steroid use in patients with COPD increases the risk of pneumonia. no difference in pneumonia risk between budesonide and fluticasone or by dose of budesonide. cystis pneumonia remains many times more likely in patients with HIV disease than in patients receiving placebo. idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is an independent risk factor for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), acute rejection, graft failure, and death in lung transplant recipients. nosocomial pneumonia remains a common concern in hospitalized patients. several investigations of the inflammatory response to lung infection have helped us better understand how gram-negative pneumonia can lead to adverse consequences such as acute lung injury. a study of 4,479 ventilated patients compared the outcome of the 685 who acquired VAP with those who did not. the 30-day mortality rate for patients with VAP was 24.1 versus 23.1% for the patients without VAP, thus showing the mortality impact of VAP to be small. french investigators examined the incidence of pneumonia within 3 days of OHCA in a population with widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia (36, 37) therapeutic hypothermia was the single independent risk factor for EOP in a multivariate analysis, raising the risk almost twofold. hypothermia protects against bacterial dissemination when applied after the onset of pneumococcal pneumonia in an animal model. hypothermia protects against bacterial dissemination when applied after the onset of pneumonia in an animal model. the only effective agent for pathogens was colistin, emphasizing the urgent need for new agents active against MDR gram-negatives. one study compared aerosol therapy of VAP (ceftazidime and amikacin without intravenous therapy) with intravenous ceftazidime and amikacin therapy. a number of issues limit full acceptance of this conclusion. the definition of compliant therapy did not consider deescalation or the timing and dosing of appropriate therapy. the heterogeneity of patients with HCAP is increasingly clear. c-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2)\u2013deficient mice had a lack of exudate macrophages, leading to more ALI after LPS challenge. but intratracheal IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) enhanced survival after experimental gram-negative pneumonia. a french multicenter study of 4,479 ventilated patients compared the outcome of the 685 (15.3%) who acquired VAP with those who did not. the 30-day mortality rate for patients with VAP was 24.1 versus 23.1% for the patients without VAP. the findings do not answer a number of questions, particularly concerning the impact of therapy on mortality. noninvasive ventilation was effective at reducing postextubation respiratory failure and death. but it did not significantly reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia compared with conventional weaning. interest in endotracheal tube cuffs has renewed, not only with maintenance of adequate pressure to avoid aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions into the lung. etiologic pathogens Most episodes of pneumonia result from microaspiration of bacteria present in the oropharynx into the lung. the organisms that cause nosocomial pneumonia are increasingly multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. if treated incorrectly, resistance was common in all countries studied. study compared aerosol therapy of VAP (ceftazidime and amikacin without intravenous therapy) with intravenous ceftazidime and amikacin therapy. all patients had susceptible or intermediately sensitive P. aeruginosa. Efficacy of both regimens was comparable, with more early eradication of the pathogen. the heterogeneity of patients with HCAP is increasingly clear. the correct approach probably depends on each patient\u2019s risk factors for MDR pathogens. maintenance of cuff pressure above 25 cm H2O with a continuous control device was effective in reducing VAP (33) the easiest clinical biomarker was peripheral eosinophilia (>2%), which defines eosinophilic exacerbations. the ability to distinguish types of AECOPD is likely to increase correct management."}
