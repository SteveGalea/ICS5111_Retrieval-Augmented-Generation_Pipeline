{"summary": "viruses can modulate the biology and behavior of their vectors. many arthropod-borne animal viruses (arboviruses) and plant viruses have evolved to be well adapted for persistent infection and maintenance in their insect vectors. but the detailed mechanisms underlying the cellular responses induced by viral infection in insect vectors are poorly understood. rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV), a plant reovirus, and its rice leafhopper vector Recilia dorsalis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) to determine how autophagy is activated to promote their transmission by insect vectors. RGDV particles are arrayed in an orderly manner close to the mitochondrial outer membrane during viral replication in vector cells. in RGDV-infected leafhopper cells, compartments contain autophagy protein ATG8. this is indicating a potential role for a cellular autophagy pathway in nonlytic viral release. RGDV infection activates the autophagy pathway in insect vector cells. RGDV infection activated the autophagy pathway in VCMs of R. dorsalis. at 48 hpi, the accumulation level of ATG8-II was increased notably in virus-infected VCMs. arrowheads indicate the colocalization of ATG8-specific autophagosomes and viral particles. the average number of ATG8-specific puncta per R. dorsalis cell was counted. panel II is an enlargement of the boxed area in panel I. at 48 hpi, more than 20-fold ATG8-specific autophagosomes were found in RGDV-infected VCMs. about 80% of them were colocalized with viral major outer capsid protein P8. the number of double- or single- membrane vesicles increased more than 7-fold in the cytoplasm of virus-infected VCMs but rarely in virus-free VCMs. immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that ATG8-specifc IgG can specifically label such compartments. so, RGDV particles, assembled at the periphery of the viroplasm, can be engulfed by virus-induced autophagosomes. western blot assay showed that the accumulation of SQSTM1 was significantly decreased during viral infection of VCMs. we further revealed a clear correlation between the increase for the accumulation of ATG8-II and the decrease for the accumulation of SQSTM1. lysosomes were immunolabeled for lysosomes with LysoTracker Green DND-26 (green), for autophagosomes with ATG8-rhodamine (red) and for viral particles with P8-Alexa Fluor 647 (blue), and then processed for confocal microscopy. 80% of lysosomes were colocalized with viral major outer capsid protein P8 or ATG8-tagged autophag at 8 h after treatment, the treated VCMs were inoculated with RGDV at a MOI of 0.1. at this low MOI, the early viral infection rate was low. western blot revealed that the treatment with 3-MA or dsAtg5 or 3-MA significantly reduced viral titers by about 2\u201317-fold. autophagy pathway induced by RGDV infection facilitated viral nonlytic release from VCMs of R. dorsalis. at 48 hpi, cells were immunolabeled with ATG8-FITC (green) and P8-rhodamine (red), then examined with confocal microscopy. hpi, effects of rapamycin or 3-MA (panels I) and dsAtg5 or dsTorc1 (panels II) on transcript levels of Atg8 gene in VCMs. accumulation levels of ATG8 and SQSTM1 were detected by western blot assay using ACTB-specific IgG. RGDV infection activates the autophagy pathway in the intestine of R. dorsalis. western blot assay showed that ATG8-II can be specifically detected in the viruliferous, but not in the nonviruliferous R. dorsalis. autophagosomes in nonviruliferous (B) or viruliferous (C, D) insects were detected by confocal microscopy. at 4 days padp, insect intestines were immunolabeled for autophagosomes with ATG8-FITC (green), for viral particles with P8-rhodamine (red) and for ACTB with ACTB dye phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (blue) the formation of autophagosomes in the intestine of nonviruliferous R. dorsalis was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy. no specific labeling of ATG8 was detected in the intestine of nonviruliferous R. dorsalis. RGDV activated the autophagy pathway in R. dorsalis to mediate viral release from the intestinal epithelium. dsAtg5, dsAtg8, dsTorc1 or dsGFP were microinjected with dsAtg5, dsAtg8, dsTorc1 or dsGFP. we calculated viral genome copies for the major outer capsid protein P8 gene. western blot assay confirmed that dsAtg5 or dsAtg8 treatment reduced ATG8-II accumulation, but increased SQSTM1 accumulation in viruliferous leafhoppers. however, dsTorc1 treatment increased ATG8-II accumulation, but increased SQSTM1 accumulation in viruliferous leafhoppers. insect ACTB was detected with ACTB-specific IgG as a control. leafhoppers treated with dsRNAs were used to infect susceptible rice plants. viral transmission rate was determined by RT-PCR assay. the statistical significance is related to the dsGFP control. dsRNA-treated viruliferous leafhopper increased transmission rates from 5 to 8 days padp. dsTorc1 treatment significantly increased transmission rates from 5 to 17 days padp. dsAtg5 or dsAtg8 treatment significantly compromised leafhopper ability to transmit the virus to rice seedlings. the number of double- or single- membrane vesicles increased more than 9-fold in the cytoplasm of virus-infected VCMs but rarely in virus-free VCMs. western blot assay also showed that RDV infection activated the appearance of ATG8-I, but reduced SQSTM1 accumulation. red arrows indicate colocalization of ATG8-specific autophagosomes and P8 antigens of RDV. the average number of ATG8-specific puncta per N. cincticeps cell and a minimum of 100 cells were counted. culture supernatant was collected to measure viral titers detected by RT-qPCR assay. at 48 hpi, accumulation levels of ATG8 or SQSTM1 in 3-MA- or rapamycin-treated VCMs were analyzed by western blot assay. we further determine whether the autophagy pathway triggered by RDV infection also facilitate viral spread among insect vector cells. the expression of 3 autophagy-related genes increased rapidly and significantly (P 0.05) after 48 hours post inoculation (hpi) the autophagy-specific protein marker ATG8 is selectively enclosed within autophagosomes. the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II is generally considered to be a reliable indicator of autophagy. insect ACTB was detected with ACTB-specific IgG as a control. at 48 hpi, VCMs were immunolabeled for autophagosomes with ATG8-FITC (green), for viral particles with P8-rhodamine (red) and for viroplasms with Pns9-Alexa Fluor 647 (blue), then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. arrows indicate double-membrane of autophagosomes. panel II is an enlargement of the boxed area in panel I. arrows indicate gold particles. at 48 hpi, electron microscopy showed virus-containing single- or double-membrane compartments appeared in the cytoplasm of virus-infected VCMs. the number of double- or single-membrane vesicles increased more than 7-fold in the cytoplasm of virus-infected VCMs but rarely in virus-free VCMs. RGDV infection increases the levels of autophagic flux in insect vector cells. autophagic adapter SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is an indicator to assess autophagic flux. RT-qPCR assay showed that the expression of Sqstm1 gene increased rapidly and significantly (P 0.05) after inoculation with RGDV at a MOI of 0.4. western blot assay showed that virus-induced autophagic flux was beneficial to viral infection, rather than serving as a defense mechanism for the degradation of viral particles. RGDV infection increased the level of autophagic flux in VCMs of R. dorsalis. RGDV-induced autophagy pathway facilitates viral nonlytic release from insect vector cells. we inhibited or induced autophagy by the drugs 3-MA or rapamycin. we also silenced expression of Atg5 or Torc1 genes by RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit or induce autophagy. RT-qPCR assay showed that the treatment with dsTorc1 or rapamycin increased viral titers by about 2\u201317-fold. thus, viral infection was positively correlated to autophagosome formation. western blot revealed that the treatment with dsAtg5 reduced the accumulation of ATG8-II. hpi, cells were immunolabeled with ATG8-FITC (green) and P8-rhodamine (red) then examined with confocal microscopy. Arrows indicate the colocalization of ATG8-specific autophagosomes and viral particles. VCMs were treated with dsTorc1 or dsAtg5 at a MOI of 10. at 8 h after treatment, the treated VCMs were inoculated with RGDV. the autophagy pathway induced by viral infection was necessary for the release of RGDV into the cell culture medium. RGDV infection triggered autophagy pathway in the intestine of R. dorsalis. at 4 days padp, ATG8 and SQSTM1 in nonviruliferous or viruliferous insects were detected by western blot assay. panel II was an enlargement of the boxed area in panel I. viruliferous intestinal epithelium was immunolabeled with ATG8-specific IgG as the primary antibody, followed by treatment with 10-nm gold particle-conjugated goat antibodies. immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that ATG8-specifc IgG can specifically label virus-containing autophagosomes in the intestinal epithelium. RGDV may exploit these autophagosomes to move from the intestinal epithelium to the gut lumen through the microvilli. RGDV-induced autophagy pathway facilitates viral infection and transmission by R. dorsalis. the mean viral genome copies in dsTorc1-treated viruliferous leafhoppers were significantly (P 0.05) higher than those in dsGFP-treated controls. western blot assay confirmed that dsAtg5 or dsAtg8 treatment reduced ATG8-II accumulation, but increased SQSTM1 accumulation in viruliferous leafhoppers. the statistical significance was related to the dsGFP control. dsAtg5, dsAtg8 or dsTorc1 were used as the internal control. dsRNAs accumulated in a particular corner of the filter chamber after dsAtg5 or dsAtg8 treatment. in dsGFP-treated leafhoppers, RGDV had spread from the filter chamber into the visceral muscles. dsRNA-treated leafhoppers were microinjected with dsRNAs to test the transmission rates. no virus-containing autophagosomes were observed in virus-infected rice plants by electron microscopy. RGDV infection also activates the autophagy pathway in its insect vector RDV, a plant reovirus closely related to RGDV. an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, strongly inhibited the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and the degradation of SQSTM1 during viral infection. at 48 hpi, mock- or virus-infected VCMs were immunolabeled for autophagosomes. insect ACTB was detected with ACTB-specific IgG as a control. at 48 hpi, the accumulation levels of ATG8 or SQSTM1 in 3-MA- or rapamycin-treated VCMs were analyzed. Western blot assay further confirmed that rapamycin promoted the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and the degradation of SQSTM1. the inhibition of virus-induced autophagy blocked vial release. the activating of virus-induced autophagy facilitated viral release form insect vector cells. RGDV infection activated autophagy pathway, which facilitated viral spread. plant reovirus RDV also induced autophagy pathway and subsequently mediated nonlytic viral release from its N. cincticeps vector cells. the role of autophagy in natural interactions of arboviruses with their insect vectors has been less studied. a single-stranded DNA plant virus TYLCV can activate the whitefly autophagy pathway, which leads to subsequent degradation of the virus in vivo. RGDV can escape lysosomal degradation and exploit such autophagosomes to release from intestinal epithelium. a novel model for virus-induced autophagy pathway exploited by a virus to spread in insect intestine may be a common mechanism of spread for other viruses in vivo. we believe such a role for virus-induced autophagy pathway is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors. reoviruses can exploit the tubules constituted by viral nonstructural proteins to pass through the actin-based microvilli of the intestine epithelium either into the lumen or across the basal lamina into the circular visceral muscle of insect vectors. the autophagy pathway and other modes of cellular remodeling are induced to facilitate viral accumulation. the insect\u2019s innate immune responses, such as the siRNA antiviral pathway, are induced to maintain VCMs derived from R. dorsalis growing on a coverslip were inoculated with RGDV at a MOI of 0.4 for 2 h. at 48 hpi, VCMs were immunolabeled for autophagosomes with ATG8-specific IgG conjugated to FITC (ATG8-FITC), for viral particles with P8-specific IgG conjugated to rhodamine (P8-rho intestine labeled with ATG8-FITC, P8-rhodamine, Pns12-specific IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic acid (Pns12-Alexa Fluor 647) at 4 days padp, the intestines were dissected, fixed, immunolabeled with ATG8-FITC, P8-rhodamine and actin dye phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic Detection of virus-induced autophagy pathway by western blot assay Total proteins from VCMs or intact insects were extracted using the sample buffer and separated by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE. membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with RGDV P8-specific IgG, ATG8-specific IgG, ACTB-specific IgG (Purchased from Sigma) viruliferous R. dorsalis was calculated as the log of the copy number/g insect RNA based on a standard curve for the RGDV P8 gene. the relative transcript expression of autophagy-related genes, Sqstm1 gene and RGDV P8 gene in VCMs or R. dorsalis was analyzed by relative RT-qPCR assay. at 48 hpi, VCMs were fixed, immunolabeled with ATG8-FITC and P8-rhodamine. then inoculated with RGDV at a low MOI of 0.1. then the VCMs were washed by the fresh culture medium for 3 times. the supernatant was collected at 48 or 72 hpi and sedimented to remove cell debris. the number of viral genome copies in the extracellular of VCMs in supernatant was calculated as described above. viruliferous R. dorsalis was fed on RGDV-infected rice plants for 1 day. the replaced rice seedlings were grown in the greenhouse about 15 days to observe the appearance of disease symptoms. the total RNA was extracted from inoculated rice seedlings to determine the presence of transcripts for the RGDV P8 gene. RGDV and RDV isolates derived from R. dorsalis and N. cincticeps were maintained on the growth medium as described previously. the major outer capsid protein P8 and the nonstructural protein Pns9 of RGDV, as well as the major outer capsid protein P8 and the nonstructural protein Pns12 of RGDV were prepared. at 48 hpi, VCMs were immunolabeled with ATG8-FITC, P8-rhodamine, Pns12-specific IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic acid (P8-Alexa Fluor 647). at 4 days padp, the intestines were dissected, fixed, immunolabeled with ATG8-FITC, P8-rhodamine and actin dye phalloidin- the average number of autophagic vesicle (AV) per cell was evaluated. the average number of autophagic vesicle (AV) per cell was evaluated. a minimum of 30 cells were observed. VCMs were transfected with (+) and without (-) 3-MA, BFA or BAF for 8 h. at 48 hpi, the cells were collected for western blot assay. RT-qPCR assay performed as previously described. autophagy pathway is activated at various time points after viral infection. RT-qPCR and western blot assays analyzed the effects of synthesized dsRNAs or the drugs. VCMs were washed by the fresh culture medium for 3 times to remove the viruses that were not absorbed. the supernatant was collected at 48 or 72 hpi and sedimented to remove cell debris. the number of viral genome copies in the extracellular of VCMs in supernatant was calculated as described above. 400 second-instar leafhoppers were microinjected with dsRNAs (dsAtg5, dsAtg8, dsTorc1 or dsGFP) from 3 to 17 days padp, an individual insect was fed on a healthy rice seedling in one glass tube. the replaced rice seedlings were grown in the greenhouse about 15 days to observe the appearance of disease symptoms. statistical analyses All data were analysed with SPSS, version 17.0. percentage data were arcsine square-root transformed before analysis. data back-transformed after analysis for presentation in the text and figures. rice plants were treated with 3-MA for 1 day and then inoculated with RGDV for 2 days using viruliferous R. dorsalis. at different days inoculation, 5 rice plants positive for transcript of RGDV P8 gene were used for assay of viral genome copies."}
