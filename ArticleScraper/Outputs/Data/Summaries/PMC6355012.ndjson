{"summary": "dromedary camels are domesticated for their adaptations to survive, reproduce, and produce (e.g. milk and meat) in hot-arid environments. the two main hot-desert adaptations in dromedary camels are both extreme thermal tolerance and their high level of water conservation [2]. adapted to aridity in camels include tolerating water loss [3], having high drinking capacity, producing low amounts of urine, minimizing respiratory water loss [5] a biobank of camel DNA samples, with associated phenotypes, is needed to utilize genome sequencing and SNP genotyping technologies in linkage analyses [23] or genome-wide association studies [24]. a camel DNA biobank is essential to study livestock genetics and to develop controlled breeding programs [26, 27]. camels are three widely recognized camel breeds in the Arabian Peninsula (\u2018Majaheem\u2019, \u2018Sofor\u2019, \u2018Waddah\u2019) they represent three widely recognized camel breeds in the Arabian Peninsula (\u2018Majaheem\u2019, \u2018Sofor\u2019, \u2018Waddah\u2019) one hundred buccal swabs were used to collect saliva samples from each camel. samples were collected five at a time, by scrubbing the inner cheeks of each camel. hair follicle samples were collected from the tail by plucking them from their roots. DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the recommendations and protocol of the kit\u2019s manufacturer. the purpose of having a second elution was to provide a diluted sample that can be used directly for a polymerase chain reaction. 'replica', 'individual camel', and 'breed' as fixed factors. ANCOVAs allow us to compare regression slopes divided by fixed factors. nonparametric alternatives of both analyses were used, with statistical significance. a nonparametric ANCOVA was used to predict extracted DNA amount (of the first elution), with separate regression analyses conducted for each sample source. each sample of saliva and tail-hair was modeled as the response variable and time as the covariate. each of'replica', 'individual camel', and 'breed' as fixed factors to compare regression slopes divided by fixed factors. buccal swabs collected five at a time, by scrubbing the inner cheeks of each camel. hair follicle samples were collected from the tail by plucking them from their roots. DNA extractions were performed on the five different quantities, of each one. DNA was eluted using 100 l of the elution buffer twice. each of the two 100 l elutions was placed in a separate tube. the purpose of having a second elution was to provide a diluted sample. 'replica', 'individual camel', and 'breed' as fixed factors. ANCOVAs allow us to compare regression slopes divided by fixed factors. nonparametric alternatives were used, with statistical significance for each determined using a maximum of 100,000 iterations. the rate of DNA degradation of the saliva samples was compared to the tail-hair samples by comparing their overall regression slopes using a nonparametric ANCOVA. DNA quality and quantity The DNA extracted from all five-whole-blood quantities (20, 40, 60, 80,100 l) was clearly visible on the gel, as a single, large-sized band, that corresponds to genomic DNA. on average the amount of DNA obtained from the second elution is approximately half (49.7%) of what was obtained from the first (Table 1; S2 Fig). on average the amount of DNA obtained from the second elution is approximately half (49.7%) of what was obtained from the first (Table 1; S2 Fig). the nonparametric linear regression analysis indicated that starting whole-blood DNA sample quantity (20\u2013100 l) did not significantly predict the extracted DNA amount of the first elution. starting whole-blood DNA sample quantity did not interact with the replica factor (p = 0.2504) nor individual camel factor (p = 0.1317; S1 Table) DNA extracted from the five buccal swab quantities (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 swabs) was clearly visible on the gel as a single, large-sized band (S3C\u2013S3E Fig) but minor signs of DNA degradation were detected in the form of smears. 23% of the variation in the amount of extracted DNA was accounted for by the variation in the starting DNA sample quantity. starting saliva DNA sample quantity did not interact with the replica factor (p = 1.0000) nor with the breed factor (p = 0.0912; S2 Table) the 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 hair follicles provided, on average, 2.46, 4.15, 6.26, 8.01, and 10.19 g of extracted DNA, respectively, with an average 260/280 ratio of 1.99. starting tail-hair DNA sample quantity (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 hair follicles) significantly predicted extracted DNA amount (of the first elution) each buccal swab and tail-hair follicle quantity of each of the nine camels (C1-9) was extracted three times (replicas) the DNA in the gels is that of the first elution (E1) cle extractions produced an average amount of DNA of 6.26, 6.31, 3.80, and 4.99 g for the four extraction times (0, 3, 6, and 9 months) cle extractions produced an average amount of DNA of 6.26, 6.31, 3.80, and 4.99 g for the four extraction times. each circle corresponds to a single measurement (DNA quantity and 260/280nm ratio) from the first elution (100l) the dashed horizontal line is the mean 260/280nm ratio and the dashed vertical line is the mean of the DNA quantities (g) relationship between time and extracted DNA amount (of the first elution) is different among different individual camels and among camel breeds but is similar experimental replicates. a visual inspection of a scatterplot of time vs. extracted DNA amount (g) shows that over all four three-month time periods, the amount of DNA extracted from hair was consistently greater than that from saliva. the DNA amount from each individual whole-blood quantity averaged to 1.05, 1.69, 1.53, 1.30, and 1.28 g, respectively. on average the amount of DNA obtained from the second elution is approximately half (49.7%) of what was obtained from the first. the nonparametric linear regression analysis indicated that starting whole-blood DNA sample quantity (20\u2013100 l) did not significantly predict the extracted DNA amount of the first elution (p = 0.403) DNA extracted from the five buccal swab quantities (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 swabs) was clearly visible on the gel as a single, large-sized band (S3C\u2013S3E Fig). however, minor signs of DNA degradation were detected in the form of smears. starting saliva DNA sample quantity (1,2 3, 4 and 5 buccal swab) significantly predicted extracted DNA amount (of the first elution) 23% of the variation in the amount of extracted DNA was accounted for by the variation in the starting DNA sample quantity. starting saliva DNA sample quantity did not interact with the replica factor (p = 1.0000) nor with the breed factor (p = 0.0912; S2 Table). no differences in the quality of DNA were detected between the three replicated extractions of each individual, among individual camels, or among breeds. the different numbers of tail-hair follicles resulted in a 0.66\u201325.08 g range in extracted DNA amount and a range of 260/280 ratios of 1.36\u20132.34. the 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 hair follicles provided, on average, 2.46, 4.15, 6.26, 8.01, and DNA extracted from tail-hair follicles, over all four extraction periods, showed a clear, large-sized band. smears resembled signs of degraded DNA (i.e. smears) the tail-hair follicle extractions produced an average amount of DNA of 6.26, 6.31, 3.80, and 4.14 g for the four extraction times (0, 3, 6, and 9 months) Fig 4. Quantity and purity of camel DNA extracted from saliva and tail-hair follicles over a nine-month period. each circle corresponds to a single measurement (DNA quantity and 260/280nm ratio) from the first elution (100l) the dashed horizontal line is the mean 260/280nm ratio and the dashed vertical line is the mean of the DNA quantities (g). tail-hair samples showed similar ratios. ANCOVA detected no significant interaction effect between time and DNA source. the relationship between time and DNA source is not different overall. the rate of DNA degradation was similar across saliva and tail-hair DNA sources. buccal swab collection only requires handling assistants, care to avoid accidental bites, sterile cytological brushes, and moderate collection time. tail-hair samples have the least requirements, where no special training or assistants are needed, no collection tools, and minimal camel handling time. genetic DNA quality was obtained from all three sources in camels. four out of twenty-seven DNA samples extracted from single buccal swabs exhibited low 260/280 nm ratio. a single buccal swab offered a DNA amount equivalent to 100 l of whole-blood. however, DNA extracted from only 20\u201330 hair follicles was greater than that extracted from five buccal swabs combined. the result for saliva and tail-hair was in accordance with previous studies. the variability among individual camels in extracted DNA amount from different starting amounts of buccal swabs could be explained by the different number of cells captured from each swab. the rate of DNA degradation over the examined 9-month period was similar for both saliva and tail-hair. camel hair was previously used for STR genotyping and DNA sequencing [30, 49] and DNA sequencing [19, 21]. STR genotyping and targeted sequencing is driven by recent successful use of tail-hair for genome-wide SNP genotyping and association studies in cattle [50, 51], horses [52], and goats [53]. a single buccal swab offered a DNA amount equivalent to 100 l of whole-blood. the highest amount of DNA was obtained from tail-hair samples. the lowest was from whole-blood samples (with a maximum of 25 g) DNA extracted from only 20\u201330 hair follicles was greater than that extracted from five buccal swabs combined. the nonparametric ANCOVAs detected no significant interaction effect between starting DNA sample quantity and the individual camel factor for whole blood. this indicates that the relationship between starting DNA sample quantity and extracted DNA amount (of the first elution) among individual camels. the rate of DNA degradation over the examined 9-month period was similar for both saliva and tail-hair. however, greater deterioration in the quality and purity of DNA obtained from saliva was observed. tail-hair follicles seem to be more optimal than these two sources for large-scale genetic studies in camels. agarose gels of DNA extracted from 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100l of camel blood. each blood quantity in the seven camels (C1-7) was extracted three times (replicas) the presented DNA in the gel is that of the first elution (E1) 1.5% agarose gels of DNA extracted from 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of camel buccal swabs. DNA in gels is that of the first elution (E1) ladder used in gels is lambda-HindIII molecular marker.
