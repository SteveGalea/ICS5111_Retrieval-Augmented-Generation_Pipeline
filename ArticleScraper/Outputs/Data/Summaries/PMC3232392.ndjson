{"summary": "new type gosling viral enteritis (NGVE) is an infectious disease that affects goslings less than 30 days of age. it is caused by an adenovirus called the NGVE virus (NGVEV) NGVE has resulted in significant economic losses due to the high mortality of the offspring of breeder geese. previous studies showed that apoptosis can be induced by NGVEV in duck embryo fibroblasts and the host cells of duck embryos. apoptotic morphological changes were observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) the experimental group (n = 100) and observation group (n = 30) were orally inoculated with 0.2 mL of a NGVEV-CN strain containing 1,000 LD50. the control group (n = 16) received oral doses of sterile 0.2 mL PBS (0.15 M, pH 7.2) instead of the viral suspension. tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. the paraffin-embedded sections (4-m thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. ultrastructural changes analysis was performed as follows. cells were incubated, fixed, and permeabilized in 50 L/well of Label Solution. the number of apoptotic cells was counted by counting chamber (cells per 0.1 mm2 field) data were presented as the average result of three sections per tissue per gosling. the experimental group (n = 100) and observation group (n = 30) were orally inoculated with 0.2 mL of a NGVEV-CN strain containing 1,000 LD50. the control group (n = 16) received oral doses of sterile 0.2 mL PBS (0.15 M, pH 7.2) instead of the viral suspension. tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. the paraffin-embedded sections (4-m thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the number of apoptotic cells was counted by counting chamber (cells per 0.1 mm2 field) for the negative control, cells were incubated, fixed, and permeabilized in 50 L/well of Label Solution (without terminal transferase) instead of the TUNEL reaction mixture. pathological changes of the intestine were observed in the infected or dead goslings during early NGVEV infection (after 3 days PI) apoptosis was readily observed in lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial and intestinal cells. small and spherical cytoplasmic fragments formed from neighboring cells. necrotic host cells were characterized by swelling, plasma membrane collapsed, and rapid lysis. moderate numbers of inflammatory cells were found in samples from control birds. apoptotic cells were widely observed in the BF, thymus, intestinal tract (small intestine, cecum, and rectum), spleen, liver, and cerebrum during the later phase (3 to 6 days PI). however, apoptotic cells were widely observed in the BF, thymus, intestinal tract (small intestine, cecum, and rectum), spleen, liver, and cerebrum during the later phase (3 to 6 days nucleus of apoptotic thymic lymphocytes showed increased electron density, shrinkage, and margination. chromatin clumped and marginated, or broke up into pieces and formed apoptotic bodies (Ca) chromatin condensation and margination were also observed. TUNEL-specific staining (brown, arrows) was widely observed in the Bursa of Fabricius (A), Harderian gland (B), small intestine (C), and proventriculus (D). if there were N goslings judged positive, which was recorded as N/3. less than 10% apoptotic cells (+), 1040% apoptotic cells (+++) and more than 40% apoptotic cells (+++). DNA ladder analysis of apoptotic cells from infected goslings is shown in Fig. 4. no obvious DNA ladder patterns were observed in samples from control birds. pathological changes of the intestine were observed. hyperaemia and heavy hemorrhaging of the small intestine were observed in the infected or dead goslings. apoptosis was readily observed in lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial and intestinal cells. apoptosis in new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV)-infected goslings was characterized by the formation of small and spherical cytoplasmic fragments. necrotic cells gradually increased while the number of apoptotic cells decreased during the late infection phase. apoptotic cells were widely observed in the BF, thymus, intestinal tract (small intestine, cecum, and rectum), spleen, liver, and cerebrum during the later phase (3 to 6 days PI). however, apoptotic cells were widely observed in the BF, thymus, intestinal tract (small intestine, cecum, and rectum), spleen, liver, and cerebrum during the later phase (3 to 6 days nucleus of apoptotic thymic lymphocytes showed increased electron density, shrinkage, and margination. chromatin clumped and marginated, or broke up into pieces and formed apoptotic bodies (Ca) chromatin condensation and margination were also observed. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) analysis of apoptosis in vivo was widely observed in the bursa of Fabricius (A), Harderian gland (B), small intestine (C), and proventriculus (D). if there were N goslings judged positive, which was recorded as N/3. DNA ladder analysis from the proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, cecum, rectum, harderian gland, thymus, BF, and spleen of the infected goslings is shown in Fig. 4. no obvious DNA ladder patterns were observed in samples from the control birds during the entire experiment. apoptosis and necrosis were detected in the early and late NGVEV-infection phase. the presence and quantity of apoptotic cells increased with infection time until 9 days PI. apoptosis was readily observed in the lymphoid and digestive organs. virus-induced lymphocytic apoptosis is involved in pathogenesis of many viral infections. cellular and humoral immune functions are markedly depressed in central as well as peripheral immune organs after NGVEV infection. apoptosis and necrosis were widely detected in the digestive organs. be useful for achieving a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in NGVEV infection."}
