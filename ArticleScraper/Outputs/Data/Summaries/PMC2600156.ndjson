{"summary": "Indonesia\u2019s decision to withhold influenza A Virus (H5N1) samples reportedly stemmed from its reaction to an Australian company\u2019s development of an avian influenza vaccine derived from a virus strain Indonesia provided to WHO (3). the decision reportedly stemmed from its reaction to an Australian company\u2019s development of an avian influenza vaccine derived from a virus strain Indonesia provided to WHO (3). in may 2007, negotiations between Indonesia and WHO did not produce agreement. independent efforts to increase vaccines access did not alter the stand-off. the resolution sets out a series of actions to achieve both \u201cthe timely sharing of viruses and specimens\u201d in GISN. to convene an interdisciplinary working group to revise terms of reference of WHO Collaborating Centers, H5 Reference Laboratories, and national influenza centers. to review all relevant documents for sharing influenza viruses and sequencing data, based on mutual trust, transparency, and overriding principles. to report on progress on implementation of the resolution to the world health Assembly. fears about avian influenza\u2019s spread and the emergence of pandemic influenza highlighted the weakness of international efforts to increase vaccine availability in developing countries. the resolution expresses a desire to craft a more equitable system of global influenza governance, the substantive elements of which remain to be negotiated. GISN was not organized under treaty law, so no countries had treaty obligations to share samples. the most relevant international legal rules, the International Health Regulations (IHRs) adopted by WHO in 1969 (IHR 1969), did not include influenza as a disease subject to the Regulations. equating influenza virus samples with biological resources by CBD raises questions that undermine Indonesia\u2019s use of CBD. CBD was created, partly, to help developing countries rich in biological diversity control access to this diversity to conserve and manage it for sustainable development. CBD does not apply to avian influenza virus. states parties to CBD have addressed avian influenza. surveillance is critical for combating avian influenza\u2019s threat to biological diversity. interpreting IHR 2005 became important in the controversy over influenza virus sharing. IHR 2005 had no binding force under international law until it officially entered into force on June 15, 2007. a state must refrain from acts that would defeat a treaty\u2019s object and purpose. at least 2 different interpretations exist. the first interpretation argues that IHR 2005 requires States Parties to share relevant biological samples with WHO. the IHR 2005 mandates that States Parties provide WHO with samples for surveillance purposes without preconditions or expectations of benefits. interpretation of IHR 2005 is compatible with CBD because IHR 2005 requires sample sharing for risk assessment purposes, not risk management activities. the second interpretation comes to the opposite conclusion. the principle of treaty interpretation is that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith. information to WHO about a reported event also contains a list of things that would fall within the ordinary meaning of \u201cinformation\u201d and contains nothing that could be considered biological samples, substances, or specimens. the absence of express reference to biological samples is particularly telling in light of the fact that WHO and its member states were aware of concerns about the failure of countries to share samples of pathogens of global concern. the WHA resolution steps back from the differing treaty interpretations. the resolution reaffirms the obligations of States parties under IHR 2005. the sovereign right of states over their biological resources is a key principle in CBD. the meeting in Singapore did not produce consensus, and Indonesia continued to withhold the samples. many feared the talks would follow Indonesia\u2019s lead and produce a system where countries would exercise sovereignty over viruses or bacteria found within their borders."}
