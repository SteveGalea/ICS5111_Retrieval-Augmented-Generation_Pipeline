{"summary": "a 10-month-old cat presented with a 4 month history of polyuria and polydipsia. the only abnormal findings were hyposthenuria and an elevated random plasma osmolality level. a modified water deprivation test confirmed the ability to concentrate urine above a urine specific gravity of 1.035. a cat with persistent PU/PD and hyposthenuria was diagnosed with primary polydipsia after completion of a modified water deprivation test. a specific pathogen-free cat was reported for drinking and urinating approximately twice as much as conspecifics housed in the same facility. the cat was anesthetized with isoflurane (Isothesia; Henry Schein) the next day for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and urine. the cat was subsequently anesthetized with isoflurane (Isothesia; Henry Schein) random USG levels measured over the next 2 months on a refractometer were never >1.010. the three main differentials for PU/PD in this cat were complete or partial central diabetes insipidus (CDI), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and primary polydipsia (PP) water allotment was incrementally reduced over a 14 day period down to 100 ml/kg/day on the day prior to testing. this allowed close monitoring of the cat for changes in mentation, neurologic status, body weight, USG and serum osmolality levels. the cat lost 5% body weight and a urine sample was collected with a USG of 1.038. after testing 100 ml of water was provided every 12 h to the cat. over the next 24 h 300 ml water was offered twice and the consumption rate was 550 ml/24 h. two weeks after establishing changes in diet and environmental enrichment, bloodwork and UA were repeated. the average values for water consumption, urine output and USG were 128 ml/kg/day, 56 ml/kg/day and 1.022, respectively. a MWDT should cause urine to concentrate above 1.008 but less than 1.020 at a 5% dehydrated state. NDI is a primary polyuric disorder that results from an inability of the nephron to respond to AVP. NDI can be primary (familial) or secondary (acquired) in dogs. hyperadrenocorticism,17 pyometra,18 pyelonephritis,4 hyperthyroidism19 and hyperaldosteronism20 can lead to secondary NDI in the cat. with NDI there should be minimal-to-no improvement in PU/PD signs and USG when desmopressin is administered or when a MWDT is performed. however, the MWDT ultimately ruled out primary and secondary ND PP has been briefly described in dogs as a psychological disorder and behavioral problem but no reports yet exist in cats. treatment for dogs diagnosed with psychogenic polydipsia centers around gradual water restriction with or without the addition of salt to the diet. patients with PP should have lower than normal plasma osmolality (280 mOsm/kg) owing to increased blood volume, while those with CDI or NDI have plasma osmolality levels >280 mOsm/kg. however, there can be considerable overlap of plasma osmolality values in animals with these three disorders. three human patients diagnosed with dipsogenic diabetes insipidus had basal plasma osmolality and sodium levels in the upper normal range as opposed to being suppressed. a study by van Vonderen et al. showed that four dogs previously diagnosed with PP had decreased AVP responses during a MWDT. primary polydipsia was the underlying cause of the cat\u2019s chronic PU/PD and hyposthenuria."}
