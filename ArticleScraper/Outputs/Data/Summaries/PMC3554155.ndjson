{"summary": "a wide variety of host cell proteins have been implicated in RNA virus replication. cyclosporine (CsA) was previously found to inhibit the replication of a number of RNA viruses (4\u20138). this drug affects the function of several members of the cellular cyclophilin protein family. several Cyp inhibitors lack the immunosuppressive properties of CsA. they are currently being explored in clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (16\u201318) many arteriviral proteins were found to be associated with these membrane structures, on which viral RNA synthesis was found to depend (26, 27). however, so far, the identity and role of proviral host factors involved in the replicative cycle of arteriviruses have remained unexplored. MARC-145 cells were infected with a recombinant PRRSV (SD01-08-GFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. a mouse monoclonal antibody against -actin (Sigma) and a mouse monoclonal antibody were used. IC50 of inhibitors was calculated with GraphPad Prism (version 5) software. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope. proteins were transferred to Hybond-LFP membranes by semidry blotting. ts were scanned with a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare) and analyzed with ImageQuant TL software. in vitro RNA synthesis assays were performed essentially as described previously. labeling of viral RNA with [3H]uridine was performed essentially as described previously. after 1 h, viral RNA synthesis was labeled by adding 100 Ci of [3H]uridine. 1 104 293/ACE2 cells per well were transfected with a 100-l mixture containing 100 nM siRNA, 0.2 g DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon), Opti-MEM reduced-serum medium (Invitrogen) and antibiotic-free culture medium. a cell culture-adapted derivative of the EAV Bucyrus isolate (32) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant EAV (33) were ARC-145 cells were infected with a recombinant PRRSV (SD01-08-GFP) at an MOI of 0.1. titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells (28), whereas PRRSV titers were determined by fluorescent focus assay on MARC-145 cells. debio-064 was stored as a 10 mM stock at 4\u00b0C in aliquots for single use. IC50 of inhibitors was calculated using a nonlinear regression model. blots were scanned with a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare) in vitro RNA synthesis assays were performed as described previously. in short, approximately 1 108 EAV-infected BHK-21 or Vero E6 cells were harvested at 6 or 7 h postinfection (p.i.) cells were lysed to obtain a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) labeling of viral RNA with [3H]uridine was performed essentially as described previously (38). 4 105 cells in 4-cm2 dishes were given medium containing 10 g/ml actinomycin D (ActD; Sigma-Aldrich) and either 4 M CsA or 0.01% DMSO as a solvent control. a 100-l mixture containing 100 nM siRNA, 0.2 g Dharmacon transfection reagent (Dharmacon), Opti-MEM reduced-serum medium (Invitrogen) and antibiotic-free culture medium were used for cells in 12-well clusters. RESULTS EAV-GFP and PRRSV-GFP replication is inhibited by CsA. IC50 of CsA for EAV-GFP replication in BHK-21 cells was determined to be 0.95 M. BHK-21 cells were infected with EAV-GFP at an MOI of 5, and at 1 h p.i. the inoculum was replaced by medium containing different concentrations of CsA. cyclophilin inhibitor Debio-064 blocks EAV-GFP and PRRSV-GFP replication. cell viability was only slightly affected by CsA concentrations above 4 M. alternative Cyp inhibitors lack immune-suppressive properties of CsA. 50 of 0.29 M, which is about 3-fold lower than that of CsA, was determined. the CsA analog Debio-064 blocks EAV-GFP and PRRSV-GFP replication. the IC50 is comparable to the inhibitory effect of CsA on PRRSV-GFP replication. wt EAV-infected cells were treated with 0.25 to 8 M CsA. at 6 h p.i., cells were lysed and lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. expression of viral nonstructural proteins was hardly detectable after 4 M CsA treatment. cells were fixed at 6 h p.i. and stained with an anti-nsp3 antiserum. wt EAV, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and viral proteins were undetectable after a dose of 4 M CsA or 1 M Debio-064. titers observed after treatment with 4 M CsA were similar to those measured at 1 h p.i., which likely reflected the remainder of the high-MOI inoculum used. these data correlated well with the barely detectable expression of the nsp5-8, nsp9, and the M and N proteins and the lack of dsRNA after treatment with 4 M CsA. treatment with Debio-064 also resulted in an 4-log-unit treatment with Debio-064 resulted in an 1.5-log-unit reduction of infectious progeny at 16 M and 2.5-log-unit reduction of infectious progeny at 32 M. this is comparable to the reduction in PRRSV progeny observed upon CsA treatment. eled CTP is incorporated into viral RNA, were conducted in the presence of various concentrations of CsA. RNA-synthesizing activity was abolished when the reaction was performed in the presence of 12 M CsA (lane 4), while a >50% reduction of viral RNA synthesis was observed in the presence of 8 M CsA (lane 3). 28S rRNA detected by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe was used as a control to correct for variations in loading during viral RNA quantification. rTCs isolated from EAV-infected BHK-21 cells at 6 h p.i. were used in an in vitro RNA synthesis assay. RNA was isolated and reaction products were analyzed in denaturing formaldehyde agarose gels. knockdown of CypB expression did not influence GFP reporter expression. knockdown of CypA resulted in 60% reduction of the GFP signal in EAV-GFP-infected cells compared to that in control cells. FP reporter expression of cells transfected with the siRNAs indicated below the graph and infected at 48 h posttransfection with wt EAV at an MOI of 0.01. titers at 32 h p.i. in the culture medium of cells transfected with the siRNAs indicated below the graph and infected at 48 h posttransfection with wt EAV at an MOI of 0.01. nsp9-containing fraction also contained significant amounts of the normally cytosolic CypA. a fraction of CypA was found to cosediment with the RTC-containing membranes. a fraction of CypA was found to cosediment with the RTC-containing membranes. Western blot analysis was used to determine sedimentation of CypA, calnexin, and cytosolic marker protein GAPDH. nsp9-containing membrane fractions were analyzed for presence of CypA. a clear cosedimentation of CypA and nsp9 was observed. BHK-21 cells were grown in 96-well plates and infected at an MOI of 5 with GFP-expressing recombinant EAV (33). Upon removal of the inoculum, medium containing 0.03 to 4 M CsA was given. at 18 h p.i., cells were fixed and GFP expression was quantified. cells were fixed at 24 h p.i., and at 1 h p.i., the inoculum was replaced by medium with CsA. effects of CsA on viability of the MARC-145 cells compared to the viability of untreated control cells (100%). a similar experiment was performed with PRRSV-GFP in MARC-145 cells. sA at inhibiting mouse T-cell proliferation induced by concanavalin A. compared to CsA, debio-064 had a stronger inhibitory effect on EAV-GFP replication. mARC-145 cells were incubated with various concentrations of Debio-064 from 1 h p.i. onwards. cells were fixed at 24 h p.i., and GFP reporter expression was normalized to the GFP signal of control cells (100%) results (average and SD) of a representative experiment performed in quadruplicate are shown. BHK-21 cells were infected with EAV (MOI, 5) and treated from 1 h p.i. on with CsA (A) or Debio-064 (B) at the concentration indicated above each lane. cells were lysed at 6 h p.i. and viral protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. CsA and Debio-064 block the production of arterivirus titers. titers were measured at 12 h p.i. using supernatants from infected (MOI, 5) cells treated with either CsA or Debio-064. treatment probably abolished virus production, as the titers observed after treatment with 4 M CsA were similar to those measured at 1 h p.i. MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV-GFP (MOI, 0.1) were treated from 1 h p.i. onwards with CsA (gray bars) or Debio-064 (white bars) at the concentrations indicated below the x axis. virus titers in the medium at 24 h p.i. were determined by fluorescent focus assay. 4 M CsA was given at 4.5 h p.i., 3H incorporation into viral RNA was reduced to 8% of the incorporation measured for nontreated control cells. we tested its effect in a previously developed in vitro assay to study the RNA-synthesizing activity of semipurified EAV RTCs. in vitro and in vivo RNA-synthesizing activity of EAV RTCs can be blocked by CsA or Debio-064 treatment. total RNA was isolated, analyzed in denaturing agarose gels, and detected by fluorography. we made use of the same human 293/ACE2 cells we previously used to study the role of Cyps in SARS-CoV replication. this cell line was also susceptible to EAV infection, although only 40% of the cells became GFP positive after infection with EAV-GFP at a high MOI. knockdown of CypA or CypB did not have a significant effect on cell viability during the 48 h of the knockdown experiment. 293/ACE2 cells were transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA or siRNAs targeting CypA or CypB. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CypA, but not CypB, strongly affects EAV replication. densities in the gradient ranged from 1.04 g/ml to 1.18 g/ml. the low-density fractions of both EAV-infected and mock-infected PNSs contained the cytosolic marker GAPDH. several organelle markers, like the ER protein calnexin and the mitochondrial marker CoxIV, were found in higher-density fractions. postnuclear supernatant of EAV- and mock-infected Vero E6 cells was fractionated using a continuous 0 to 30% OptiPrep density gradient. distribution of CypA, CypB, the cytosolic marker protein GAPDH, and the ER marker protein calnexin in density gradient fractions of mock-infected cell lysates analyzed by Western blotting. a clear cosedimentation of CypA and nsp9-containing fraction of CsA-treated lysates was observed. this suggests that CsA can prevent the cosedimentation of CypA with the membrane-associated EAV RTCs. a small fraction (1 to 5%) of PRRSV-inf. previously, coronavirus-infected vero E6, 17Cl1, or Huh7 cells were refractive to CsA treatment, even at high concentrations. nidovirus-wide conservation of a cyclophilin-dependent function in viral replication suggests the nidovirus-wide conservation of a cyclophilin-dependent function. binding of CypA to NS5B mediates proper folding of enzymatically active NS5B and its incorporation into replication complexes. similar functions were found to be essential for RNA binding by NS5B and for HCV replication as whole. the distribution of CypB appeared to be less dispersed in gradients containing infected cell lysates than in those containing mock-infected lysates. the distribution of CypB appeared to be less dispersed in gradients containing infected cell lysates than in those containing mock-infected lysates. this does not have a measurable effect on virus replication. the association of CypA with the EAV replication structures suggests the existence of a functional\u2014presumably PPIase activity-dependent\u2014interaction that is essential for virus replication. a functionally important interaction with such a key enzyme in arterivirus RNA synthesis could certainly explain that efficient EAV replication depends on the availability of sufficient CypA. we compared the inhibition of EAV and PRRSV replication by CsA with that caused by the nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog Debio-064. for Debio-064, we obtained an IC50 of 0.32 M, 3-fold lower than that of CsA."}
