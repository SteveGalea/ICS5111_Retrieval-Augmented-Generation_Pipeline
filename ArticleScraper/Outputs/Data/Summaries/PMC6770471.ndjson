{"summary": "RNA viruses are recognized as highly mutatable. their high mutation rates make it very difficult for therapeutic interventions to work effectively. they develop resistance to antiviral drugs and antibodies elicited by vaccines. this poses a real threat to how emerging infectious agents could be prevented. mutation rates for DNA genomes have been estimated to be between 107 and 1011 per base pair per replication [11], the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed typically low fidelity whereby the mutation rate is roughly 104 mutations per nucleotide copied. this characteristic of the RNA polymerase in RNA viruses led to the generation of diverse offspring with different genotypes in shorter generation times. the phenomenon of quasispecies has been well reported for many viruses belonging to different families and genera [16,17,18] there is no clear idea whether emerging viruses such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and many others owe part of their evolution to higher virulence conferred by the presence of specific quasispecies. the 5\u2032-NTR has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which controls cap-independent translation. the ORF comprises 6579 nucleotides can be classified into three polyprotein regions. they encode for structural proteins (VP1 to VP4) in the P1 region and non-structural proteins in the P2 (2A\u20132C) and P3 regions (3A\u20133D) the number of poliomyelitis has been reduced by 99% worldwide. a small number of countries still have sporadic outbreaks of polio. the innate immune response reduced the viral pathogenicity by limiting the diversity of viruses during spread. the poliovirus strain with a mutated RNA polymerase showed greater fidelity without a significant reduction in the overall efficiency of RNA replication. the study hypothesized that having greater heterogeneity within a viral population allows it to adapt better to changing environments encountered during an infection. enteroviruses such as EV-A71 and CV-A16 have caused 7,200,092 cases of HFMD between 2008 to 2012. the mortality rate was highest among children below the age of five. 82,486 patients developed neurological complications and 1617 deaths were confirmed by the laboratory to be caused by EV-A71. the adaptive VP1\u201331G haplotype became dominant in neuronal tissues. the minor haplotype C was isolated in the intestinal mucosa and throat swab specimens. the minor haplotype D was isolated from specimens obtained from the respiratory and digestive systems. poliovirus population diversity was evaluated in the brain of the murine model. it was observed that only a fraction of the original injected viral pool was able to move from the initial site of inoculation to the brain via the \u2018bottleneck effect\u2019. 64S mutation showed greater fidelity without a significant reduction in the overall efficiency of RNA replication. the poliovirus strain with a mutated RNA polymerase carrying an altered amino acid residue (G64S) was observed to replicate similarly to the wild-type counterpart but produced lower genomic diversity. this showed that the diversity of the quasispecies was associated with increased virulence rather than selection of single adaptive mutations. the mortality rate was highest among children under the age of five. 82,486 patients developed neurological complications and 1617 deaths were confirmed by the laboratory to be caused by EV-A71. a dominant haplotype caused a change from viruses harboring VP1\u20133D to VP1\u201331G. the adaptive VP1\u201331G haplotype became dominant in neuronal tissues. the minor haplotype C was isolated in the intestinal mucosa and throat swab specimens. the minor haplotype D was isolated from specimens obtained from the respiratory and digestive systems. the flaviviral genome is approximately 11 kb and has a single open reading frame. the ORF encodes three structural proteins (C, M and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS) the non-structural proteins include large, highly conserved proteins NS1, NS3 and NS5 and four small hydrophobic proteins NS2A, NS2B and NS4A and NS4B. dengue infection can progress to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) it is a life-threatening disease with 500,000 cases being admitted to hospitals. elucidating the exact mechanism of how it caused the formation of small plaque size is an efficient way to choose future live-attenuated vaccine strains for clinical development. differences in the envelope (E) gene sequence were investigated using the plasma samples of six DENV infected patients. the degree of genetic diversity was revealed to fluctuate among patients. immune escape variant in response to pressure exerted by immune defense mechanism. findings highlighted importance of host-specific selection pressures in evolution of deNV-3 viral population. a vaccine candidate could be identified from the prevalent escape variants. the large plaque variant had a guanine nucleotide at position 796 (230Gln) and the small plaque clone had an adenine at the same position. a recombinant clone carrying the G796A mutation was produced using an infectious molecular clone of the ZIKV MR766 strain. west Nile Virus (WNV) was first characterized in 1937 in the west Nile district of Uganda. it was taxonomically placed in the genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae family. it caused 59 hospitalized infections and 7 deaths before its spread to other parts of the USA between 1999\u20132001. clones initially isolated reverted at position 3707 in the prM region. mutation in the prM region was sufficient to revert the isolate to the wild-type phenotype. genetic diversity of WNV in the avian host was also investigated. dengue infection can progress to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) it is a life-threatening disease with 500,000 cases being admitted to hospitals and 25,000 deaths annually. a marked increase in pSTAT1 was shown in cells surrounding the foci of PDK53 infection but no increase was detected in PGMK30 and the wild-type. elucidating the exact mechanism of how it caused the formation of small plaque size is an efficient way to choose future live-attenuated vaccine strains. -3 immunity revealed that the immune repertoire of the host is responsible for the degree of diversity exhibited by the viral population. the major hotspots for diversity were revealed in more than 59% of the samples at three codon coordinates. amino acid residues 100 and 101 in the M protein and residue 315 in the AB loop of the E Domain III. Zika Virus was first discovered in 1947 when it was isolated from a female traveler. it belongs to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. the large plaque variant had a guanine nucleotide at position 796 (230Gln), while the small plaque clone had an adenine at the same position. four variants of the quasispecies population were found to be present at a level of more than 1% of the total population. mutations in the E protein accounted for 4.1% of the variants and other mutations in the non-structural region. deletion at the cleavage site of the prM site did not affect virus replication and its release from mammalian BHK cells. mutation in the prM region of the TBEV was also reported to cause decreased secretion of virus particles with no effect on protein folding. togaviridae Viruses from the togaviridae family can be further classified into the genus Alphavirus and Rubivirus. the viral genome is translated into three structural proteins (CP, E2 and E1) and four non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP4) chikungunya virus causes acute febrile illness with high fever, severe joint pain, polyarthralgia, myalgia, maculopapular rash and edema. some cases of CHIKV disease were associated with neurological complications. the virus has been associated with frequent outbreaks in tropical countries of the Americas and also in temperate zones around the world. Riemersma et al. investigated the intra-host genetic diversity of high and low-fidelity CHIKV variants using murine models. both the high and low fidelity variants were expected to lower the virulence of CHIKV as compared to the wild-type (CHIKV-WT) however, the high-fidelity variant caused more acute levels of infection. the small plaque variant (CHK-S) showed stable homogenous small plaques after 4 plaque purifications. it also grew slower and produced lower titers when compared with the wild-type virus. suckling mice with the wild-type and CHK-S variants showed 98% survival rate. CHIKV primary isolates from the Comoros Island showed two amino acid differences in the nsp2 protease and the nsp3 protein. the significance of these specific sequences for the small plaque variants becomes uncertain. CHIKV-NoLS-immunized mice were able to produce long-term immunity against CHIKV infection following immunization with a single dose of the CHIKV-NoLS small plaque variant. the noLS mutation caused a considerable change in the basic capsid region involving two nucleotides which could affect the structure of RNA binding, assembly of nucleocapsid and interaction with the envelope proteins. the ECSA virus with an A226V substitution in the E2 envelope gene had caused multiple massive outbreaks in various regions starting in the la Reunion Islands in 2005. the Asian genotype started invading the Americas in 2013, causing massive outbreaks in various countries in central, south America and the Caribbean. fidelity variants, nsp2 G641D and nsp4 C483Y mutations increased CHIKV virulence in the adult mice. the low-fidelity variant gave rise to reduced rates of replication and disease. the CHIKV variant with the small plaque size formed a major subpopulation in the CHIKV primary isolate during multiple passages in C6/36 cells. this indicates that the small plaque variant had reduced in vivo fitness. this suggests replication cycles in mosquito vectors might play an important role in maintaining the small plaque variant in natural infections. the CHIKV-NoLS clone remained genetically stable after five passages. a single non-synonymous change in the nucleotide caused an alanine to serine substitution at position 101 in the third plaque variant. the substitution did not cause any change in the small plaque phenotype or replication kinetics of the CHIKV-NoLS clone. the virions are 80 nm in diameter and appear as branched, circular or filamentous. the genome encodes for four structural proteins, namely nucleoprotein (NP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase co-factor (VP35), transcriptional activator (VP30) and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. five species have been identified within the genus of Ebolavirus. only the Reston virus (RESTV) is assumed to be non-pathogenic for humans. the other four are well-known to cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD) a large number of mutations from previous outbreaks present with more than 90% frequency in the sequence of the new Ebola epidemic isolates. the high mutation rates found in a RNA quasispecies increased the probability of escape mutations. this could explain the escape of the 2014 viral isolates from neutralizing antibodies elicited by the old outbreak isolates. dietzel et al. studied the functional significance of three non-synonymous mutations in the Ebola virus isolates from the outbreak in west africa. the impact of specific mutations on the role of each viral proteins and on the growth of recombinant EBOVs was analyzed by recently engineered virus-like particles. only one single nonsynonymous variant (T544I) showed a shift in frequency of at least 10% over six serial passages. but passaging the EBOV in other cell lines showed different mutations in the genomes of the viral population. this brings forth the question as to whether the viral strains of the virus should be directly isolated from patients. the GP has a high frequency of mutation within a host during the spread of infection and in the reservoir in the human population. a large number of mutations from previous outbreaks present with more than 90% frequency in the sequence of the new epidemic isolates. et al. investigated the viral pseudotyping of EBOV glycoprotein derivatives in 10 cell lines from nine mammalian species. the data showed that isoleucine at position 544 mediated membrane fusion and increased the infectivity of the virus in all host species. valine at position 82 modulated viral infectivity but was dependent on the virus and the host. the mutations in the recombinant Ebola virus affected the functional activity of viral proteins and enhanced the growth of the recombinant virus in the cell culture. a pilot epidemiological study with a substantial sample size suggested that high mortality in the host was not changed by these three mutations. the genomes were characterized after serial-passages of EBOV in boa constrictor kidney JK cells. the 5\u2032 end is occupied by a replicase gene comprising two overlapping ORFs. the four structural proteins are spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid (N). the virion membrane is enriched with membrane proteins (S, M, E and HE dimer). the size of the plaque in the mutated MERS-CoV was smaller and the infectious titers and intracellular viral RNA were decreased in infected Huh7 or Vero cells. mutant virus possessed low binding activity at the 5\u2032-UTR and promoted translational shutoff against reporter plasmids with or without 5\u2032-UTR. mutant genomes with the S530 were abundant with an estimated ratio of 4:1 deleted to intact sequence reads. deletion resulted in the production of a defective virus which was incapable of causing infections or with a lowered rate of infection. the two mutations resulted in reduced RBD binding affinity to the human CD26. variants with D510G and I529T mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein demonstrated an increase in resistance against neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and reduced sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. the frequency of each of the single mutant varied greatly but their combined frequency of mutations was elevated in the majority of the samples. MERS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. the virus is transmitted by the infected dromedary camels. it can infect a broad range of mammals, including humans. mutant virus possessed low binding activity at the 5\u2032-UTR. mutant virus promoted translational shutoff against reporter plasmids with or without 5\u2032-UTR. mutant genomes with the spike glycoprotein were abundant with an estimated ratio of 4:1 deleted to intact sequence reads. mutant bearing the S530 produced a free S1 subunit with a \u201csticky\u201d hydrophobic tail. the mutant could form steady trimer complexes that retained biding affinity for the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and acted as a decoy. the mutated MERS-CoV virus (MERS-CoV T1015N) replicated approximately 0.5 log more effectively and formed larger plaques compared to the wild type. a single amino acid (A520S) was located in the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV variant. paramyxoviridae virions are enveloped and pleomorphic with diameters of around 150 to 350 nm. the genome is linear, negative-sense single-stranded RNA, about 15\u201319 kb in length and encode 9\u201312 proteins through the production of multiple proteins from the P gene. cell attachment protein is different based on the genera and could be hemagglutinin (H in Measles), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN in Mumps and NDV viruses) or glycoprotein G (Henipavirus) some genera within the Paramyxoviridae family also contain various conserved proteins. the measles virus (MeV) may persist in the brain, causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases. this virus can only infect humans and causes subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and encephalitis [112,113,114] lymphocytic and epithelial adapted variants showed different replication kinetics. mutations within the 11-nucleotide region in the middle of the phosphoprotein (P) gene. this sequence mediated the polymerase split and caused an insertion of a pseudo-templated guanosine to the P mRNA. in the united states, mumps was one of common disease prior to vaccination became routine. a dramatic decrease was observed in the number of infections. majority of those who are not vaccinated are at high risk. heterogeneity could be the result of new mutations at these positions or the selection of pre-existing sequences within the minority quasispecies. extra caution should be exercised to evaluate genetic markers of virulence or attenuation of variants based on only a consensus sequence. hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins are presented on the surface of the virion envelope. the fusion protein is expressed as an inactive precursor (F0) prior to activation by proteolytic cleavage. the cleavage of F0 is crucial for infectivity and works as a key virulence indicator for certain viruses. the decline of the lentogenic F0 genotypes of 112-E(G)RQE(G)RL-117 from 99.30% to 0.28% and the rise of the velogenic F0 genotypes of 112-R(K)RQR(K)RF-117 from 0.34% to 94.87% was hypothesized to be due to the emergence of velogenic F0 genotypes. this led to the enhancement of virulence in JS10-A10 the genome analysis of the avirulent field isolates of the NDV puts forth the existence of viruses with virulent F0 sequences without causing obvious clinical signs of the disease. the variability of the quasispecies population and the rate of accumulation of mutations in vivo and in vitro were analyzed. analysis revealed the existence of 1\u20132% of virulent strains with the F0 cleavage site of 112-RKGRRF-117 in the population. virulent strains present in the quasispecies population did not emerge from an avirulent viral population unless the quasispecies population was placed under direct selective pressure. measles virus (MeV) may persist in the brain, causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases. early investigations of meV infections in the HeLa cells with a vaccine-lineage MeV estimated an intra-population diversity of 6\u20139 positions per genome. this led to the concept that MeV exists as quasispecies in a population. mumps is an extremely contagious, acute, self-limited, systemic viral infection. it affects swelling of one or more of the salivary glands, typically the parotid glands. infection could cause pain in the swollen salivary glands on one or both sides of patient face, fever, headache, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue and loss of appetite. virulence of the passaged virus was dramatically decreased in the murine model. similar growth kinetics of the virulent Urabe P-AM9 and passaged attenuated variants in the rat brain suggested the impaired replication ability of the attenuated variants was not the main cause of the neuroattenuation. clinical diseases affecting the neurological, gastrointestinal, reproductive and respiratory systems are detected in nave, unvaccinated or poorly vaccinated birds. the NDV genome codes for seven major viral proteins in the order of 5\u2032-N-P(V)-M-F-HN-L-3\u2032. meng et al. studied changes in virulence of lentogenic variants (JS10). lentogenic variants (JS10) remained lentogenic after 20 serial passages in chicken embryos. JS10, JS10-A10 and JS10-E20 were directly generated from the parental strain. cleavage site was reported to be the main region in which the majority of amino acid changes had occurred. passaging caused a transition in the degree of virulence of NDV strains from lentogenic to mesogenic. the status of the quasispecies population is dependent on the pathogenicity of the NDV. in vitro studies showed the quasispecies distribution of the avirulent isolate harbored 10% of variants bearing the virulent F0 region (RRQRRF) the quasispecies distribution of the avirulent isolate harbored a novel clade of NDV viruses with the F0 cleavage site sequence of 112-RKQGRL-117. pneumoviruses have a negative-sense RNA genome of 13 to 15 kb. the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) binds to the genome at the leader region. members of the genus Orthopneumovirus possess 10 genes including NS1 and NS2 which are promoter proximal to the N gene. human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of infection of the upper and lower respiratory tracts with mild, cold-like symptoms in infants and young children. there are 4\u20135 million children younger than 4 years with HRSV infections and more than 125,000 are hospitalized every year in the united states. the mutation caused the virus to be completely resistant to PZ prophylaxis in cotton rats. the fusion protein supported the entry of the MP4 mutants in HEp-2 cells in an early phase of the replication cycle through a fusion step. a large dominance of non-synonymous over synonymous mutations was observed in all BRSV mutants. the non-synonymous mutations mapped preferentially within the two variable antigenic regions of the ectodomain or close to the highly conserved domain. human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the primary cause of infection of the upper and lower respiratory tracts with mild, cold-like symptoms in infants and young children. there are 4\u20135 million children younger than 4 years with HRSV infections. more than 125,000 are hospitalized every year in the united states. the fusion protein supported the entry of the MP4 mutants in HEp-2 cells in an early phase of the replication cycle through a fusion step. the lack of reactivity of the MP4 mutants with PZ suggested that the F1 protein of the MP4 mutant caused a loss of antigenic reactivity with the humanized monoclonal antibody. a large dominance of non-synonymous over synonymous mutations was observed in all BRSV mutants. the non-synonymous mutations mapped preferentially within the two variable antigenic regions of the ectodomain or close to the highly conserved domain in the G protein. this results suggested that BRSV populations might have evolved as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, despite apparent genetic stability. ed RNA encodes for 11 proteins (HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, PA, PB1 and PB2). the genome fragments contain both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal repeats which are highly conserved throughout all eight fragments. the viral RNA genome of 12\u201315 kb consists of eight single-stranded RNA segments. influenza vaccines have sub-optimal efficacy, as there was a lack of antigenic proximity between the vaccine candidate and the circulating seasonal influenza virus strains. the low vaccine efficacy of the 2016\u20132017 egg-adapted H3N2 (clade 3c.2a) vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 was reported to be due to altered antigenicity. analysis of the clinical isolates showed a difference in a single amino acid residue, 160 K within the HA. the degree of diversity within the quasispecies population was reported to be elevated in severe cases when compared to mild ones. more than 15% of the variants within the quasispecies population of the subtype strain were shared in a given season. but between the season 2010\u20132011, various vSNPs in the PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS segments were shared among variants with more than 58\u201380% of the sample population. less than 50% of the shared vSNPs were located within the PB1 segment. influenza A (H3N2) viruses from the clade 3c.2a were dominant and was associated with severe onset of the disease. the low vaccine efficacy of the 2016\u20132017 egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 was reported to be due to altered antigenicity. clinical isolates showed a difference in a single amino acid residue, 160 K within the HA. the degree of diversity within the quasispecies population was reported to be elevated in severe cases when compared to mild ones. a viral single nucleotide polymorphism (vSNP) was reported to be important. 58\u201380% of the sample population shared vSNPs in the PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS segments. less than 50% of the shared vSNPs were located within the PB1 segment. a significant upregulation of the Ifng was associated with an increased majority of mutants expressing a differentially expressed gene. the approximate size of the DNA genome is 3.3 kb. the genome is made up of four partly or completely overlapping ORFs. overlapping ORFs encode for the core protein (Core and preCore), surface antigen protein (PreS1, PreS2 and S), the reverse transcriptase (Pol protein) and the X transcriptional transactivator protein. hepatitis B (CHB) infections result in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver failure. every year CHB causes 880,000 deaths worldwide [153] every year. rtM204V/I resistant mutation was observed across the majority of samples prior to the rescue therapy. rtM204V/I resistant mutation was observed across the majority of samples prior to the rescue therapy. viral strains obtained from a time point showed evidence that they originated from a small pool of the previous time point. this conferred the strain an advantage over other strains with regards to the recovery of the founder state shortly after transmission to the new host. more than one billion people have contracted hepatitis B virus (HBV) more than 200 million patients are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (CHB) every year CHB causes 880,000 deaths worldwide. substitutions of Valine (V) or Proline (P) at position 76 resulted in a four-fold increase in the production of HBsAg. the decrease in the variability observed was associated with a stable quasispecies population after positive selection of the variant exhibiting high fitness level. the complexity and diversity of the quasispecies of HBV were similar between the CHB patients responsive to the treatment and those who did not. it can be inferred that the characteristics of the quasispecies in CHB patients at the start of the study was not associated to the various viral responses observed in the cohort. sera collected from two remote rural communities showed that 11% of the population were actively infected with HBV. the high prevalence of HBV infection suggested that the transmission of the parental strain introduced was very efficient within the two selected communities. a large network of common sequences was observed among individuals of the community and this is considered as proof of transmission. a genetically diverse quasispecies population could be a key contributing factor to elevated levels of virulence exhibited by the RNA viruses. this study could shed more light on the evolutionary pattern and virulence of RNA viruses."}
