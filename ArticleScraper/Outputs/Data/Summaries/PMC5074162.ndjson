{"summary": "we searched for papers that estimated the HAO burden. there are oft quoted figures in the range of 1\u201310%. this is because the HAO incidence is small compared to endemic HAIs. wenzel et al. (1983) evaluated 5 years of surveillance data (1978\u20131982) and identified 11 HAO, of which 10 occurred in critical care units. the methodology was heavily ICU focused which may explain the findings. the early devastating outbreaks caused by sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were over. yet to materialise were the effects of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and risks/infections associated with advancing medicine. NNIS data collected from 252 US outbreaks (1956\u20131979). no reference to a proportion of nosocomial infections that occur as outbreaks. there is no NNIS denominator provided by Stamm et al. (1981) gaynes et al. (2001) was incorrectly cited at least three times as the original source for the \u201810%\u2019 claim. the influential work by Gaynes et al. refers to old data from which evidence to support their inference is missing. the process must count \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 all the infections that are present in healthcare settings on a given day. there is no attempt to determine if any of the HAIs are related to each other. norovirus accounted for just three (0.3%) of all identified GI pathogens. for the first time, eCDC included three new and readily available markers of \u2018infection control structure and process indicators\u2019, i.e. alcohol-based hand rub consumption, single room provision and IPCNs. there are other surveillance systems that focus on infections in specific populations, such as intensive care units. most national surveillance systems mirrored their development with a focus at least initially on surgical site infections. the 2013/14 SSI report for England details outcome results of 133,427 operations by 17 different surgical categories. the responsibility for this intervention lies with the local IPCT. norovirus accounted for just three (0.3%) of all identified GI pathogens. one large NHS board in Scotland identified for a 23-month period a total of 2331 norovirus cases and 192 unit outbreaks. national norovirus surveillance systems have been established. they focus on the countable and not the totality of the challenge. new national outbreak surveillance systems are emerging. society's conceptions of security were exceeded by MRSA outbreaks by the early 2000s. outbreaks of CDI provided another such \u2018society exceedence\u2019. a public that has had its conception of security exceeded by such pathogens is unlikely to allow it. the IPCT and national surveillance systems need to be mindful of, and working towards, preventing any new emerging pathogens from \u2018exceeding society\u2019s conception of safety\u2019. the eCDC\u2019s objective of determining \u2018total burden of HAI\u2019 via prevalence of HAI is missing a considerable amount of IPCT\u2019s local HAI burden, i.e. patients who are colonised with alert organisms, e.g. MRSA, carbapenamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE), or patients with a community infection which has HAI or HAO potential. small outbreaks can present an immense HAI IPCT burden. the IPCT will be required to undertake in-depth investigations of possible transmission pathways, observe healthcare practices, attend meetings, explain the situation to patients and families. despite the number of different AO/CD there is at present only local quantification of this surveillance work. despite the number of different AO/CD there is at present only local quantification of this surveillance work. outbreaks involving endoscopy-related Gram-negative organisms have always been present but thus far avoided detection as they lacked a unique resistance pattern to serve as a marker of cross-transmission. failures to isolate patients with AO/CD also present outbreak-provoking conditions. the proportion of HAIs present as HAOs is not static and reflects the risks associated with the healthcare interventions of the time. consider the sensitive Staph aureus outbreaks of the 1960s, the quiet 1970s and 1980s which followed by MRSA and CDI challenges thereafter. national surveillance systems do not control infection; but they do create the arguments for control activity. estimates of HAI burden should include HAOs and IPCT work to minimise both HAI and HAO risk. there is often discussion about what proportion of HAI is preventable. none of the existing national surveillance systems are designed to count (all) HAI and most completely omit HAO altogether. infections that can be counted have a \u2018feature-positive effect\u2019 on the estimation HAI burden (Dobelli, 2013, ch. 95) ergo the HAI and HAO challenge is actually increasing. there is a real risk of redirection of the IPCT resource from outbreak prevention and preparedness work towards HAI that are counted."}
