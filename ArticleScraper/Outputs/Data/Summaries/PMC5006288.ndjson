{"summary": "around 3.5 million cases of RTI each year, or almost 1 in every 15 deaths globally. a wide range of respiratory viruses is known to cause recurrent epidemics of RTI in humans associated with severe disease. the paramyxoviruses switch hosts at a higher rate than many other RNA virus families. the presence of influenza viruses in both waterfowl and bats suggests that transmission from birds to bats may have occurred in the past. the presence of influenza viruses in both waterfowl and bats suggests that transmission from birds to bats may have occurred in the past. four influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century. four coronaviruses are currently endemic, generally associated with relatively mild RTI in humans. the severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002. influenza A viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are enzootic in wild migratory birds of aquatic habitats around the world. they sometimes spill over from this bird \u2018virus reservoir\u2019 into other animal hosts, including domestic poultry, pigs, horses, a variety of carnivores and marine mammals. they adapt to their new animal hosts, leading to enzootic virus circulation for years, decades or centuries. influenza viruses are well known for their ability to transmit efficiently via the airborne route, while some paramyxoviruses are thought to spread primarily via contact and fomites. key questions in public health such as whether particular newly emerging coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and influenza viruses could acquire the ability of sustained transmission between humans to trigger a pandemic remain unknown. humans have been infected with zoonotic influenza viruses via intermediate species to which human exposure is more frequent. infections result from activities in close contact with animals, such as visiting live markets or fairs, care giving, meat processing, culling of infected animals or performing necropsies of infected animals. pigs were considered a necessary intermediate host to allow adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammals. zoonotic events pointed at terrestrial poultry as an alternative potential intermediate host for transmission of influenza viruses from wild waterfowl to humans. avian influenza viruses of subtypes H5, H6, H7, H9 and H10 have indeed demonstrated the ability to infect humans. zoonoses with every subtype of influenza virus may be of concern. virus of the H5, H9 and H7 subtypes are considered the greatest threat. differences exist in the zoonotic potential of different influenza viruses or virus subtypes. human cases have continued to be reported along with poultry outbreaks. most of the recent reports on H5N1 virus outbreaks have come from Egypt and southeastern parts of Asia. human infections with H9N2 viruses have been reported upon contact with poultry since 1999. their relatively low virulence in poultry provides an opportunity for undetected virus circulation. reassortment events between H9N2 virus and other influenza virus subtypes have been reported. in 1979, human infection was reported with an H7N7 virus of seals. it remains the only report of an influenza zoonotic infection coming from an animal host other than birds and pigs. the distinction between zoonotic and pandemic influenza viruses lies in their transmission phenotypes. contact and airborne transmission can be direct, involving transfer of infectious particles by direct physical contact between an infected person and a nave person. airborne transmission occurs when infectious particles expelled by an infectious person travel via the air and settle on the respiratory tract mucosa of a susceptible person. reassortment events between viruses of different origin established the paradigm. the principal mechanism of generation of pandemic viruses would be reassortment. avian influenza virus receptors predominate in chickens, quail and other land-based birds. ferrets are a well-established model for both transmission and pathogenesis of influenza viruses and have been used in influenza research since the early 1930s. ferrets are readily susceptible to infection with avian, swine and human influenza viruses without the need of prior adaptation. guinea pig transmission models were recently developed because they are more practical and less expensive. the ferret and guinea pig model has increased the number of replicates. the more economical and less demanding guinea pig model has also allowed increasing the number of replicates. the more economical and less demanding model has also allowed increasing the number of replicates. early study on transmission of influenza viruses using ferret model made a strong case that transmission occurred primarily via aerosols. it was demonstrated that virus transmission occurred when donor and recipient ferrets were up to 1,5 m apart in open wire cages. improvement of the ventilation of the room abolished transmission. avian influenza viruses remain viable in aerosols for longer time periods. biological decay of aerosolized influenza virus increased with relative humidity. high temperatures have also been shown to be detrimental to airborne transmission efficacy. the longer the time between the inoculation of the donor and the exposure of the nave ferret, the less efficient the transmission was. the longer the time between the inoculation of the donor and the exposure of the nave ferret, the less efficient the transmission was. vRNA levels remained relatively constant over 5 days post-inoculation. binding site (RBS) of the hemagglutinin (HA) preferentially recognizes sialic acid receptors linked to galactose by 2,6-linkage (2,6-SA) avian influenza viruses preferentially bind 2,3-SA receptors. 2,6-SA receptors are predominantly present on ciliated cells in the URT (oropharynx, nose, throat) pH1N1 viruses also possessed 190D and 225D. a D225G substitution, leading to dual receptor specificity, did not decrease the airborne transmissibility of the virus in ferrets and guinea pigs. these residues are commonly found in human influenza virus isolates. however, these substitutions were not present in pH1N1 viruses. the matrix (M) gene segment was also found to be a critical factor for the transmission of pH1N1 in the guinea pig model. studies on airborne transmission of human and avian influenza viruses demonstrated that these traits were necessary but not sufficient to result in airborne transmission between mammals. GOF-TXM experiments are also needed if we wish to investigate if viruses that have not yet acquired the potential of airborne transmission could acquire this trait in the future. avian H9N2 viruses, including those that acquired 2\u20136 SA receptor specificity, still lack key features for efficient airborne transmission between mammals. reassortant virus containing the HA and NA of an H9N2 virus and the remaining genes of an H3N2 virus was initially not transmissible via the airborne route between ferrets. avian H9N2 viruses and pH1N1 viruses are genetically compatible. a total of 12 antigenically distinct H9N2 viruses isolated from humans, birds or pigs in Asia between 1998 and 2009 were found to lack the ability of airborne transmission between ferrets. adaptation substitutions, such as E627K and D701N in PB2, were detected upon infection of ferrets. this contrasts with the paradigm that mammalian intermediate hosts such as pigs are necessary to acquire such properties. the research highlights the potential public health threat posed by these viruses. a fully avian HPAI H5N1 virus can become airborne transmissible between ferrets upon acquisition of only a handful of mutations. the introduction of amino acid substitutions Q226L and G228S in HA to switch the binding preference from 2,3-SAs to 2,6-SAs and E627K in PB2 of A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Indo05) was insufficient to confer airborne transmission of this virus between ferr the H99Y substitution in PB1 in concert with E627K in PB2 tuned the balance of transcription of different RNA species (vRNA, mRNA, cRNA) produced by the viral polymerase during infection of mammalian cells. other recent studies demonstrated that H5N1 viruses can acquire airborne transmissibility upon genetic reassortment with human influenza viruses. affinity of both airborne Indo05 and VN1203 was tuned toward increased 2,6-SA receptor binding and decreased avian receptor binding. this shift was associated with differences in specificities for 2,6-SA sialosides. both Linster et al. and Imai et al. highlighted a previously overlooked critical phenotypic trait for airborne transmission of H5 viruses. the pH at which the conformational change is triggered is specific to the HA and is important for virus infectivity. Imai et al. found that substitutions leading to 2,6-SA preference increased the pH threshold for fusion and decreased the thermostability of HA. it remains unknown whether the substitutions compensate for the decreased pH stability caused by the substitutions responsible for 2,6-SA preference. several H5N1 reassortants were transmitted via the airborne route between guinea pigs without the need for mammalian adaptation substitutions. the results of Zhang et al. contrast with previous attempts to generate airborne-transmissible reassortant viruses between H5N1 and human viruses without introducing mammalian adaptation markers. avian-origin H7 influenza viruses can be efficiently transmitted by contact. avian H7 viruses are not readily airborne transmissible between mammals. reassortment was required to generate the virus. the K/R304R substitution is located in the stalk of H7 HA, distally from the RBS. this contrasts with what has been found for H5N1 viruses. the relatively high propensity of H7 influenza viruses to cross the species barrier might explain why additional substitutions in the RBS were not required. R95K mutation was acquired by the H7N1 virus during adaptation to ferrets. the other substitution acquired in M1 was R211Q, in the region responsible for binding to vRNPs. polar amino acids at position 81 are predominant in avian strains. the number of nave animals that became infected upon aerosol exposure was lower and the kinetics of transmission was slower than for human and pandemic influenza viruses. adaptation markers, known to tune the binding preference toward 2,6-SA receptor specificity, were detected in the vast majority of human H7N9 virus isolates. the 2,6-SA receptor-binding pattern of human H7N9 viruses arises from the introduction of two bulky hydrophobic residues by the substitutions Q226L and G186V. none of the H7N9 virus isolates described to date possess the G228S substitution, which has been found in combination with the Q226L substitution. 1 virus have indicated that the glycosylation and stability patterns of HA are important for airborne transmissibility. the fact that H7N9 viruses have been reassorting extensively with H9N2 viruses in china. the evolution of H7N9 viruses should be monitored closely. watanabe et al. recently conducted a study to assess the risk posed by naturally circulating avian influenza viruses. avian influenza virus genes, encoding proteins closely related to those of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus, are present in the influenza virus gene pool harbored by diverse avian hosts. E190D and G225D substitutions in HA were sufficient to switch the receptor specificity of the virus from 2,3-SA to 2,6-SA receptors. this resulted in reduced HA thermostability, which was restored by additional HA substitutions acquired upon airborne transmission. this contrasts with previous reports on airborne-transmissible H5N1 viruses. TRIG cassette first identified in swine influenza viruses in 1998. hypothesized to have contributed to the maintenance of the H1 and H3 virus lineages in swine by conferring a competitive advantage over other swine influenza viruses gene constellations. major difference between the 2011 H3N2v viruses and earlier H3N2v viruses isolated from human cases of infection is the M gene. the binding preference of H3N2v influenza viruses for 2,6-SA receptors is likely to be one of the determinants of airborne transmission. however, the identification of potential additional determinants in other viral genes is necessary to fully understand the relatively efficient transmission of H3N2v viruses between ferrets. an analysis comparing the biological properties of one seal H3N8 virus isolate and avian H3N8 isolates revealed that the seal isolate had increased binding affinity for 2,6-SA as compared to the avian isolates. however, the seal virus did not possess classical receptor switching substitutions, such as Q222L or G228S. it remains unclear whether substitutions in the head region of HA might be responsible for the increased 2,6-SA receptor-binding preference of seal H3N8 viruses avian influenza viruses preferentially bind 2,3-SA receptors. in humans, 2,6-SA receptors are predominantly present on ciliated cells. 2,3-SA receptors are present on non-ciliated cells and type II pneumocytes of the LRT. pH1N1 viruses also possessed 190D and 225D (Maines et al. 2009). a D225G substitution, leading to dual receptor specificity for 2,3-SA and 2,6-SA, did not decrease the airborne transmissibility of the pH1N1 virus in ferrets and guinea pigs. these residues are commonly found in human influenza virus isolates. however, these substitutions were not present in pH1N1 viruses. it was shown that efficient replication of pH1N1 viruses in mammalian hosts was achieved by alternative substitution, T271A and 590/591 SR polymorphism, in PB2. GOF-TXM experiments are necessary when one aims to pinpoint the minimal molecular and phenotypic traits for a given phenotype, i.e. airborne transmission of influenza viruses. GOF-TXM experiments are also needed if we wish to investigate if viruses that have not yet acquired the potential of airborne transmission could acquire this trait. avian H9N2 viruses, including those that acquired 2\u20136 SA receptor specificity, still lack key features for efficient airborne transmission between mammals. reassortant virus containing the HA and NA of an H9N2 virus was initially not transmissible via the airborne route between ferrets. this adaptation in ferrets also resulted in changes in the antigenic properties of the virus. avian H9N2 viruses and pH1N1 viruses, both of which have been isolated from pigs, are genetically compatible. a total of 12 antigenically distinct H9N2 viruses isolated from humans, birds or pigs in Asia between 1998 and 2009 were found to lack the ability of airborne transmission between ferrets. research on mammalian adaptation and airborne transmission of H9N2 viruses highlights potential public health threat posed by these viruses. this contrasts with the paradigm that mammalian intermediate hosts such as pigs are necessary to acquire such properties. a fully avian HPAI H5N1 virus can become airborne transmissible between ferrets upon acquisition of only a handful of mutations. the introduction of amino acid substitutions Q226L and G228S in HA to switch the binding preference from 2,3-SAs to 2,6-SAs and E627K in PB2 of A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Indo05) was insufficient to confer airborne transmission of this virus between ferr RNA species (vRNA, mRNA, cRNA) produced by the viral polymerase during infection of mammalian cells, resulting in increased virus replication. other studies demonstrated that H5N1 viruses can acquire airborne transmissibility upon genetic reassortment with human influenza viruses. both airborne Indo05 and VN1203 possessed a putative lack of glycosylation site at position 158\u2013160. the removal of this specific glycosylation site increased the binding of H5N1 viruses to 2,6-SA. both Linster et al. and Imai et al. highlighted a previously overlooked critical phenotypic trait for airborne transmission of H5 viruses. the pH at which the conformational change is triggered is specific to the HA and is important for virus infectivity. amino acid substitutions H110Y and T318I in HA restored the pH threshold for fusion to the wild-type levels or even below. it remains unknown whether the substitutions compensate for the decreased pH stability caused by the substitutions responsible for 2,6-SA preference. Zhang et al. (2013) showed that several H5N1 reassortants were transmitted via the airborne route between guinea pigs without the need for mammalian adaptation substitutions. the results of Zhang et al. contrast with previous attempts to generate airborne-transmissible reassortant viruses between H5N1 and human viruses without introducing mammalian adaptation markers. avian-origin H7 influenza viruses can be efficiently transmitted by contact. avian-origin H7 viruses are not readily airborne transmissible between mammals. the K/R304R substitution is located in the stalk of H7 HA, distally from the RBS. this contrasts with what has been found for H5N1 viruses. a filamentous morphology due to a fine interplay between the M gene segment has been found to be important for transmission of pH1N1 virus. H7N1 virus acquired during adaptation to ferrets may function the opposite way as it has been reported to change morphology from filamentous to spherical. the other substitution acquired in M1 was R211Q, in the region responsible for binding to vRNPs. adaptation markers, known to tune binding preference toward 2,6-SA receptor specificity, were detected in the vast majority of human H7N9 virus isolates. the role of PB2 E627K, as well as other functionally equivalent substitutions, in increasing virus replication of H7N9 viruses in mammalian hosts and cell lines has been confirmed. the 2,6-SA receptor-binding pattern of human H7N9 viruses arises from the introduction of two bulky hydrophobic residues by the substitutions Q226L and G186V. none of the H7N9 virus isolates described to date possess the G228S substitution, which has been found in combination with the Q226L substitution in pandemic and other airborne viruses. H7N9 viruses lack a glycosylation site at position 158\u2013160. a relatively unstable HA may have contributed to their capacity to infect humans. some of these H9N2 viruses have been found to be readily transmissible. avian influenza virus genes are present in the large influenza virus gene pool harbored by diverse avian hosts. the original 1918-like virus was not transmitted between ferrets via the airborne route. a subsequent transmission experiment was performed and the virus was transmitted to two out of three exposed ferrets. substitutions leading to 2\u20136 SA binding resulted in reduced HA thermostability. this contrasts with previous reports on airborne-transmissible H5N1 viruses. increased acid stability correlated with increased thermostability. the TRIG cassette has been first identified in swine influenza viruses in 1998. it hypothesized to have contributed to the maintenance of the H1 and H3 virus lineages in swine by conferring a competitive advantage over other swine influenza viruses gene constellations. the major difference between the 2011 H3N2v viruses and earlier H3N2v viruses isolated from human cases of infection is the M gene. common to all classical swine viruses, the H3N2v do not possess the polymerase activity enhancing E627K and D701N substitutions. but rather the SR polymorphism at positions 590/591 (Liu et al. 2012) the 2011 H3N2v virus possessed the M segment of the pH1N1 virus. the seal virus did not possess classical receptor switching substitutions. it remains unclear whether substitutions in the head region of HA might be responsible for the increased 2,6-SA receptor-binding preference of seal H3N8 viruses. phylogeny, modeling, virus characterization in vitro using isolated virus genes or attenuated and wild-type and engineered viruses, and animal experiments with natural virus isolates. GOF-TXM studies are the only tool to assess whether particular mutations or changes in biological traits could increase their transmissibility in the future. influenza viruses of subtypes H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 can be transmitted via respiratory droplets or aerosols between humans and other mammals. changes in receptor specificity as determined by HA (and perhaps NA) and polymerase activity have been shown to be crucial for the airborne transmission of these viruses. GOF-TXM research to investigate the effect of amino acid substitutions that affect receptor specificity and stability of HA should be conducted. animal models should be improved or alternative (e.g. in vitro or mechanical) models should be developed to study virus transmission quantitatively. s research is supported by NIAID/NIH contract HHSN272201400008C. conflict of interest.
