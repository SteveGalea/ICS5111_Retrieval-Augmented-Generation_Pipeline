{"summary": "the ER is responsible for folding and processing proteins entering the secretory pathway. it uses a variety of mechanisms to adjust its capacity in response to changes in the folding burden. in metazoans, components of the UPR are essential for developmental processes requiring high levels of secretion. new branch of the regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) has the potential to selectively relieve the burden on the ER while clearing the translation and translocation machinery for the subsequent influx of new proteins. studies suggest that the RIDD pathway also operates in mammalian cells. mRNA decay may explain observations that Ire1 in metazoans has a broader range of physiological outputs than XBP-1 splicing. in this study, we take advantage of mouse fibroblasts lacking Ire1 activity, both to confirm that RIDD is conserved in mammalian cells. induction of ERdj4 was stronger in the hIre1R cells compared with Ire1/ cells. the nuclease activity of Ire1 is required for RIDD. asterisk denotes a hybrid band amplified from spliced and unspliced products. cells treated with 2 mM DTT (A), 3 g/ml Tm (B) or 500 nM thapsigargin (C) for 5 h relative to untreated cells. cells were untransfected or transfected with negative control siRNA (QIAGEN) or siRNAs targeting Ire1 followed by DTT treatment as in A. the redistribution of certain nascent proteins from the ER to the cytosol during ER stress significantly impacts cell survival. the effect on translocation is similar in magnitude to RIDD (Kang et al., 2006). heral myelin protein (Pmp22) Mm.1237 ECM 0.88 0.07 Yes Collagen, type VI, 1 (Col6) Mm.2509 ECM 0.85 0.15 Yes Ephrin B2 Mm.209813 Membrane (PM) 1.06 0.14 No Microtubule-associated protein 7 domain containing 1 (MAP7d1) Mm.266716 NA 0.69 0.10 No Splicing factor, Arg/Ser rich 3 (SRp RIKEN cDND 4932417H02 Mm.209933 NA 0.71 0.21 ND Pre\u2013B cell leukemia transcription factor\u2013interacting protein 1 Mm.65906 NA 0.69 0.33 ND Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSP4) Mm.41329 Membrane (PM) 0.68 0.28 ND SHANK-associated RH domain\u2013interacting protein Mm.41463 Cytosol 0.67 0. mRNAs down-regulated by Ire1 are degraded faster in the presence of ER stress. hIre1R, Ire1/, or NIH-3T3 cells were treated with 1 g/ml actinomycin D and/or 2 mM DTT, and relative mRNA abundance was monitored over time by qPCR replicates. we measured the mRNA decay rates of two confirmed RIDD targets in NIH-3T3 cells. the nuclease activity of Ire1 is required for RIDD because the parent Ire1/ cell line lacks Ire1 activity. we could probe specific functions of Ire1 by inserting variants of hIre1 containing point mutations into these cells. the nuclease activity of Ire1 is required for degradation of RIDD targets. this is consistent with a mechanism in which Ire1 directly cleaves these RNAs in response to ER stress. binding allows activation of the nuclease while simultaneously inhibiting the kinase activity of Ire1-I642G. Ire1 activity was not caused by a general induction of ER stress. cells lacking Ire1 or expressing wild-type hIre1 were insensitive to 1NM-PP1. the 1NM-PP1\u2013induced activation of hIre1-I642G was not caused by increased levels of the protein. spliced XBP-1 (G) and relative mRNA abundance for ERdj4 and Blos1 (H) were measured as in B. no degradation of RIDD substrates was observed with 1NM-PP1 alone. XBP-1 splicing in cells expressing hIre1-I642G treated with 30 M 1NM-PP1 was as high or higher than those seen in wild-type cells treated with low concentrations of DTT. the levels of XBP-1 splicing in cells expressing hIre1-I642G were as high or higher than those seen in wild-type cells treated with low concentrations of DTT. RIDD requires an active Ire1 nuclease domain but does not depend on Ire1's kinase activity. ER stress-dependent degradation of RNAs by hIre1-I642G was seen at concentrations of 1NM-PP1 1.5-fold higher than those that inhibited the kinase activity of the protein in vitro. oligomers may form only in the presence of misfolded proteins. a second possibility is that other factors activated by ER stress are necessary for RIDD. a substantial change in the pool of mRNAs associated with the ER membrane under stress conditions could affect the RIDD pathway. hepatitis C virus and human cytomegalovirus induce Ire1 but block downstream effects of XBP-1. hepatitis C virus protein production is increased in the absence of Ire1. it remains to be determined what role RIDD may play in viral infection and other physiological stress conditions. both cell lines strongly induced immunoglobin-binding protein (BiP), an abundant ER chaperone, in response to ER stress. induction of ERdj4 was stronger in the hIre1R cells compared with Ire1/ cells, especially in response to DTT. mRNA abundance for targets of ER stress in hIre1R and Ire1/ cells treated with 2 mM DTT (A), 3 g/ml Tm (B) or 500 nM thapsigargin (C) for 5 h relative to untreated cells. mRNA abundance in cells lacking functional XBP-1. despite the relatively small changes for individual messages, the effect of down-regulating mRNAs at the ER surface may profoundly impact the folding burden of the ER. for example, redistribution of certain nascent proteins from the ER to the cytosol during ER stress significantly impacts cell survival.

RIDD is a general, conserved pathway associated with folding stress. cells expressing hIre1-D847A showed no change in the abundance of RIDD targets. this is consistent with a mechanism in which Ire1 directly cleaves these RNAs in response to ER stress. hIre1-I642G induces the UPR upon binding 1NM-PP1 alone. treatment of mouse cells expressing hIre1-I642G with 1NM-PP1 was sufficient to induce splicing of XBP-1. this activity was not caused by a general induction of ER stress. cells lacking Ire1 or expressing wild-type hIre1 were insensitive to 1NM-PP1. hIre1R-I642G cells were treated with 2 mM DTT, 3 g/ml Tm, and/or 7 M 1NM-PP1 for 5 h unless otherwise indicated. the means and SD for three to five independent experiments are shown. RIDD targets to similar levels as those expressing wild-type hIre1. XBP-1 is transcriptionally induced in our cells in a largely Ire1-independent manner. this does not occur to a significant extent in cells treated with 1NM-PP1 alone. no change in mRNA abundance for RIDD targets was detected in cells expressing hIre1-I642G and treated with 1NM-PP1 alone. the cells were still capable of inducing RIDD when treated with 1NM-PP1 and DTT together. in mammalian cells, RIDD requires an active Ire1 nuclease domain but does not depend on Ire1's kinase activity. yeast Ire1 forms higher order oligomers that lead to higher levels of RNase activity. oligomers may form only in the presence of misfolded proteins. a second possibility is that other factors activated by ER stress are necessary for RIDD. activation of XBP-1 leads to protective remodeling and expansion of the secretory pathway. cells may induce an active state of Ire1 that is similar to the 1NM-PP1 activation described in this study. conditions such as viral infection may call for a more destructive response that limits the load of incoming proteins. all cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in DME supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, Gln, and antibiotics. we generated Ire1-/ MEFs containing ferritin-like protein recombination target (FRT) sites for site-specific transgene expression by transfection with pFRTlacZeo. to generate labeled samples for array hybridization, we amplified 0.5 g RNA in a single round using the amino allyl MessageAmp II aRNA kit. in parallel, we synthesized unlabeled cDNA from 2 g of total RNA for qPCR measurements to confirm the array data. qPCR and XBP-1\u2013splicing assays We purified RNA samples for all experiments using TRIZOL and synthesized cDNA from total RNA samples. we then performed qPCR measurements using the primers shown in Table S1. we amplified cDNA using primers surrounding the splice site.
