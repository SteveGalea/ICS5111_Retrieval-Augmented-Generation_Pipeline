{"summary": "CAP is a leading cause of hospitalisation worldwide. Mortality rates for patients hospitalised with CAP approach 30%, especially in those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). CAP has the potential to improve individual patient management, reducing the risk of clinical failure and death. GLIMP coordinating centre received expedited project approval by the institutional review board. the review board waived the need for informed consent due to the nature of the study. the primary outcome of this study was to evaluate the influence of geography and disease severity on testing practices. hospitalisation was defined as admission at an inpatient service and subsequent stay for 24 h. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was defined according to the clinical and laboratory standards Institute guidelines. diagnostic testing was defined as concordant with the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines if recommended tests were performed. lung disease, positive Legionella antigen test, positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test and presence of pleural effusion Recommended in case of intubation Legionella urinary antigen test Recommended in case of ICU admission, leukopenia, alcohol abuse, chronic severe liver disease, asplenia and pleural effusion Recommended in all patients hospitalised with severe CAP Acute-phase serology for Chlamydophila pneumoniae. the GLIMP coordinating centre was located at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (San Antonio, TX, USA) the

obtained among patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. only blood cultures, BAL cultures and viral testing were significantly more common among patients with a severe disease. of the 8450 diagnostic tests performed, 12.9% yielded a positive result. a total of 1362 pathogens were detected. performance of at least one test ranged from 82.1% among patients hospitalised in Africa to 97.8% among patients hospitalised in Asia. blood cultures were obtained in approximately 70\u201390% of patients hospitalised in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. microbiological tests

and under-testing were reported in 59.3% and 19.1% of the IDSA/ATS-discordant patients. lack of pneumococcal urinary antigen test was responsible for a significant percentage of under-testing. a pathogen was identified in one-third of adult inpatients with CAP. despite extensive laboratory testing, the EPIC study identified a pathogen in 38% of 2259 patients hospitalised with CAP in the USA. a randomised trial by van der Eerden et al. showed a statistically significant difference in mortality among ICU patients receiving empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials (91%) versus pathogen-directed antimicrobials (45%). we could speculate that the economical restraints of African health systems accounted for the reduced number of blood cultures and viral tests performed in this setting. discordance with the IDSA/ATS guidelines was mainly due to over-testing. under-testing was also a cause of discordance with the ERS guidelines. over-testing was also a cause of discordance with the ERS guidelines. our understanding of the aetiologies of CAP among hospitalised adults is scarce, limiting the accuracy of empirical antimicrobial regimens. disease severity and geography are associated with differences in testing approaches."}
