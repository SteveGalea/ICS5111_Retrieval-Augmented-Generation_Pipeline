{"summary": "the virus was first detected in the earliest 70's when the disease became a major public health concern. since then, all four serotypes of the virus have been reported. but there are not studies about its origin, genetic diversity and distribution. DF is characterized by headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain and sometimes maculopapular rash. DF is characterized by headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain and sometimes maculopapular rash. the increase in virus transmission over the last 50 years has possibly increased its adaptive potential. host factors such as age, race, presence of non-neutralazing cross-reactive antibodies and possibly chronic diseases could act as selective pressures, resulting in more virulent genotypes.

Previously reported genotypes were represented in the tree. most of the Colombian isolates were nesting in the genotype V clade. the oldest isolates were more divergent representing the first entrance of virus in Colombia. however, two different lineages may be defined based on cladal distribution. the evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method. root indicates 1945 as the date of the more recent common ancestor. there was a split up around 1987 between DENV-1/CO/188_Guaviare/1987 isolates and the remaining strains (PP = 0,82) by the year 1992, another remarkable partition event occurred to generate 2 well defined clades (PP = 0,77 and 1). DF and DHF had been associated to the four DENV serotypes. DENV-2 and DENV-1 predominating since 1971 after the re-appearance and spread of Aedes (Stegomyia)aegipty. the huge genetic diversity of DENV has been vastly documented. strains DENV-1/CO/261_Atlantico/1978, DENV-1/CO/263_Choco/1979 and DENV-1/CO/150_Choco/1979 were separated from the remaining isolates. it was reported for the first time in 1977 in Jamaica and rapidly spread to the Antilles including Cuba, Antigua & Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Cura\u00e7ao, Dominica, Grenada, Guadaloupe, Guyana, Haiti many researchers have categorized DENV in non official taxonomic levels beneath genotype. cladogenesis event occurs around 1992 according to the molecular clock. most of the american strains correspond to the lineage-1, leaving the lineage 2 restricted to Colombia. resulting constrain has been experimentally assessed in vivo to Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis [52] and in vitro to DENV [51] demonstrating that fitness improves when virus specialize in a single cell line but decreases in virus undergoing alternative passages in different cells. a mutation rate of 8.58 10-4 substitutions per site, per year suggests faster evolution rates for Colombian strains. evolution events could bring new genetic variants and eventually increase severity of disease. pathogenic markers remain unclear, but hemorrhagic features on some Asian DENV-2 genotypes have been demonstrated. changes in clinical manifestation of disease may respond to the circulation of new DENV lineages with increased pathogenic potential. all viral stocks were inoculated on C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells growing in E-MEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FSC) after 10 days of incubation at 28\u00b0C, monolayer was disrupted and supernatant was then recovered by centrifugation and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. PCR reactions were first denaturated at 94\u00b0C (2 minutes) and then subjected to 40 cycles of denaturation (94\u00b0C, 30 seconds), primer annealing (57\u00b0C, 4 minutes), primer extension (72\u00b0C, 30 seconds) and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. nested PCR reactions were evaluated in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. a total of 224 bp from 74 new sequences were compared with 52 previously sequenced strains from all over the world. phylogenetic analyses were performed by using the best model of nucleotide substitution based on Modeltest [56]. MCMC was run for 10,000,000 steps and sampled every 500 steps. 10,000 first steps of each run were discarded. 74 isolates from outbreaks, epidemics and routine epidemiological surveillance. 140 l of each supernatant was placed into 560 l of AVL buffer with 5.6 l of carrier RNA and mixed with ethanol. after washing with buffers AW1 and AW2 RNA was finally eluted with 60 l of AVE buffer and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. nested PCR was evaluated in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. amplified products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. products were then used as template for sequencing reactions using the ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit. the program BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees)[41] uses Bayesian Markov Chain Montecarlo (MCMC) algorithms combined with the chosen model and prior knowledge of sequence data to infer the posterior probability distribution of phylogenies. in order to avoid duplicates, sequences identical to other on the dataset were removed. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the red Nacional de Laboratorios - Instituto Nacional de Salud, Colombia. we are grateful to Pablo Martnez and Noelia Reyes for technical assistance."}
