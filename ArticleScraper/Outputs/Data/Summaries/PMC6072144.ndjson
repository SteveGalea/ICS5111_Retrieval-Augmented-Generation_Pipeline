{"summary": "prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy; the mortality rate has exceeded lung cancer. it is also known that prostate cancer-associated fatalities frequently occur in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. the study aimed to investigate the effect of CXCL9 on T cells in prostate cancer. a total of 54 mice were used in this study. mice were anesthetized by 10% chloral hydrate solution (3 ml/kg, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and then the blood samples were collected. the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the prostate tissues were stored. a total of 30\u201350 l HRP conjugated IL-6 (A0192), TGF- (A0277) and PCNA (AF1363) secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was added to the tissue section and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. excess liquid was dried around the tissue and then placed flat into the moist chamber. the supernatant was discarded and the precipitation washed 3 times with 0.5% BSA. the protein was detected using FACSCantoTM II (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) prostate tissue was fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, then washed 3 times with PBS before permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. Western blotting Tissues were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) with a protease inhibitor, complete EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). the protein lysate sample was extracted from tumor tissue of mice, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10\u201315 min at 4\u00b0C. RT-qPCR was performed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) PCR cycles were run on the iCycler IQ Multi-color Detection system. the cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 1 cycle; 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and 62\u00b0C for 20 sec, 40 cycles. clinical data Prostate cancer tissue specimens (n=37) were obtained from patients aged between 35 and 68 years who were diagnosed with prostate cancer without any therapy. the clinical stages of the patients were clarified according to the tumor nodes metastasis staging system. a total of 54 mice were used in this study. mice were anesthetized by 10% chloral hydrate solution (3 ml/kg, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and then the blood samples were collected. the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the prostate tissues were collected and stored. 30\u201350 l HRP conjugated IL-6 (A0192), TGF- (A0277) and PCNA (AF1363) secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was added to the tissue section and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. excess liquid was dried around the tissue and then placed flat into the moist chamber. natant was discarded and precipitation washed 3 times with 0.5% BSA. the supernatant was removed and the precipitation was re-suspended in 200 l 0.5% BSA. the protein was detected using FACSCantoTM II. Western blotting Tissues were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) with a protease inhibitor, complete EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) the protein lysate sample was extracted from tumor tissue of mice, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10\u201315 min at 4\u00b0C. RT-qPCR was performed with random primers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) PCR cycles were run on the iCycler IQ Multi-color Detection system. the cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 1 cycle; 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and 62\u00b0C for 20 sec, 40 cycles. clinical data Prostate cancer tissue specimens (n=37) were obtained from patients aged between 35 and 68 years who were diagnosed with prostate cancer without any therapy. the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Linyi People's Hospital. mice were anesthetized by 10% chloral hydrate solution (3 ml/kg, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and then the blood samples were collected. the prostate tissues of each mouse were fixed using 10% formalin at room temperature for 24 h. the sections were washed with PBS buffer three times, each time for 5 min. excess liquid was dried around the tissue and then placed flat into the moist chamber. a working solution of 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidene was added to the sections and incubated at room temperature for 1\u20135 min. the protein was detected using FACSCantoTM II (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) prostate tissue was fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, then washed 3 times with PBS before permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS) for 10 min, also at room temperature. Western blotting Tissues were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) with a protease inhibitor, complete EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). the protein lysate sample was extracted from tumor tissue of mice, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10\u201315 min at 4\u00b0C.
