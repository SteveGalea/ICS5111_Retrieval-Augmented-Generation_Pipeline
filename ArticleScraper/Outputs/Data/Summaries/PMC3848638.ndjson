{"summary": "a subtracted library from duck trachea was constructed to analyse and compare the host response after a highly or low pathogenic (LP) H5N1-infection. more than 200 different genes were differentially expressed in infected duck trachea. genus is divided into subtypes based on the combination of two surface glycoproteins. hemagglutinin (HA, 16 subtypes) and neuraminidase (NA, 9 subtypes). LPAI viruses induce mild or no symptoms in domestic ducks. LPAI viruses replicate massively into the intestinal tract. the recent release of the chicken genome is a great help for scientists to investigate mechanisms involved in host response to the infection in chicken. no microarrays are available and molecular genetics tools have made their first steps recently. only three studies have compared the response of ducks following LPAI or HPAI infection, focusing on immune response only. tracheas were infected with 200 l of 2107 TCID50/ml of HPAI virus per trachea. the ciliary beats were dramatically reduced to 30% compared to mock-infected tracheas (100% ciliary beats) attesting for an efficient infection of the tracheas. the 2091 clones were subjected to sequencing as described in the Materials and methods section. for 1013 sequences out of 2091, a relevant blast result was obtained. 52% of sequences were above 10-140, supporting an accurate identification of the genes. new tracheal explants were infected with either strains (HPAI or LPAI) and RNA were extracted and processed for microarray experiment. sixteen microarrays were hybridised allowing four replicates for each time point of the experiment. false discovery rate was set at 4.76 (A, left panel), 4.81 (A, right panel), 5.7 (B, left panel) and 4.82% (B, right panel) false discovery rate was set at 0 (C, right panel) and 4.15% (C, left panel) black dots represent sequences not differentially expressed between the two compared conditions. comparison was made by analogy to orthologous genes annotation from well-documented and annotated human, mouse and rat genomes. trachea responses, i.e. differentially expressed genes in HPAI- and LPAI-infected tracheas, were compared. only few genes were found to be differentially expressed both at 4 h and 8 h p.i.. genes differentially expressed in LPAI-infected tracheas were compared to those differentially expressed in HPAI-infected tracheas (red circles) analysis of the microarray results for the signalling pathways highlighted different pathways in between LPAI- and HPAI-infected tracheas. only the CXCR4 pathway present for both infections. threshold corresponds to a limit of significance set by the software. only two networks, not interconnected to each other, could be identified. no induced genes were identified. TRIM33 and FOS were up-regulated whereas H-Ras, EEF1A1 and DDX3X were down-regulated in HPAI-infected tracheas as compared to control. aFold change is the mean SD of gene expression in 4 infected tracheas as compared to control. bFold change is the mean SD of gene expression in HPAI-infected tracheas as compared to LPAI-infected trachea as indicated. trachea subtracted libraries were constructed using entire tracheal explants from SPF Muscovy ducks, infected or not with a french HPAI H5N1 strain belonging to clade 2.2.1. from these 4 libraries, 1141 individual bacterial clones were randomly isolated for the two viral-induced and two viral-repressed libraries representing around 10% of all clones obtained. for 1013 sequences out of 2091, a relevant blast result was obtained. more than 50% of sequences obtained an E-value below 10-140. new tracheal explants were infected with either strains (HPAI or LPAI) and RNA were extracted and processed for microarray experiment as described in Materials and methods section. 93 sequences were down-regulated in HPAI-infected tracheas. 175 sequences were up-regulated and 222 were down-regulated. false discovery rate was set at 4.76 (A), 4.81 (A, right panel), 5.7 (B, left panel) and 4.82% (B, right panel) trachea responses, i.e. differentially expressed genes in HPAI- and LPAI-infected tracheas, were compared for each time post-infection. trachea responses to infection were slightly different with 10 genes shared. trachea responses were more different between LPAI- and HPAI-infection. only few genes were found to be differentially expressed both at 4 h and 8 h p.i. for LPAI-infected tracheas, 5 gene interaction networks can be identified. only two of these networks interacted together by one gene. the three others were not connected to another one. data significance is represented by ratio and p-value. p-value is calculated using a right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test. threshold corresponds to probability that association between genes and a given pathway is not due to random chance. only H-Ras, DDX3X and DCN were down-regulated in HPAI-infected tracheas as compared to LPAI-infected tracheas. TRIM33 and FOS were up-regulated whereas H-Ras, EEF1A1 and DDX3X were down-regulated in HPAI-infected tracheas. aFold change is the mean SD of gene expression in HPAI-infected tracheas as compared to control. bFold change is the mean SD of gene expression in 4 infected tracheas as compared to LPAI-infected trachea. ciliostasis was observed all along the tracheas indicating the virus infected and replicated all along the tracheas. the efficacy of the SSH strategy for host response analysis and discovery of modulated genes in poorly-studied species, in association or not with microarray, has been well established. many signaling pathways, including pathways concerning immunity, have been described and involve the same genes in various species. despite these limitations, subtracted libraries corresponding to induced or repressed sequences at 4 h and 8 h p.i contained 1141 and 950 clones. the expression of G was up-regulated in HPAI-infected tracheas compared to control. this activated G-protein induces transcription, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, cell survival via different signalling pathways. a similar down regulation was observed for FOS. TRIM33 was up-regulated in LPAI-infected tracheas compared to LPAI-infected. trachea family proteins are small GTPases implicated in various cell functions. they play a role in different virus infection or in immune response. cellular gene expression in the duck trachea was differently modulated after infection with a LPAI-H5N1 or after infection with a HPAI-H5N1 virus. differences were found in infected trachea, a primary infection site, which could precede continuation of infection. lack of duck genome annotations and signalling pathways hamper understanding of host-virus interaction in this species. trachea infection was performed by injecting the inoculum directly into and all along the lumen of trachea using a fine needle. trachea was then incubated at 37\u00b0C, 2% CO2 in inclined plates in order to keep trachea into the medium. RNA extraction was performed following standard Trizol protocol instructions. heat-denatured driver cDNA was added to the two tester cDNA samples. the second hybridisation step allowed for equalization of high- and low-abundance sequences. the remaining subtracted, equalized single-stranded tester cDNA re-associated to form hybrids cDNA with a different adaptor. the best 5 results were considered for final identification with a maximum e-value cut-off arbitrarily set up to 2.10-5. the best 5 results were considered for final identification with a maximum e-value cut-off arbitrarily set up to 2.10-5. 96 entire trachea explants were prepared and separated into three groups. two groups were infected with either a high dose of the HPAI H5N1 strain (32 tracheas) or a high dose of the LPAI H5N1 strain (32 tracheas) a third group of 32 tracheas was mock-infected (control) each Cy3- (or Cy5-) labelled sample from infected tracheas was then hybridised with the reference sample from mock-infected tracheas on our microarray slide. images of the hybridised arrays were acquired by scanning using a Genepix 4000A scanner with the GenePix Pro 5.0 data acquisition and analysis software (Axon Instruments) real-time PCRs were performed for the validation of the experimental infection model. cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using gene-specific primers. amplifications were carried out in 96-well plates with 3 replicates per sample. two-sample Student t-test was performed to compare gene expression variation between HPAI- and LPAI-infected tracheas using Systat 9 software. influenza viruses were amplified at 37\u00b0C in 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. allantoc fluids were collected at a maximum of 4 days after inoculation. tracheas were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, 2% CO2 in inclined plates. cDNA was synthesized from 4 g of each RNA preparation using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech) at 4 and 8 h p.i., tracheas were washed twice in cold PBS. a suppressive subtraction hybridisation (SSH) assay was then performed using the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech) libraries were ligated into pGEM vector and used in transformations with competent E. coli (TOP10, Invitrogen) for each forward subtraction (corresponding to induced genes), reverse subtraction (corresponding to repressed genes) were also performed. libraries were conserved as bacterial clones at 70\u00b0C. amplifications of cDNA from the 4 subtracted libraries were performed in 96-well plates using bacterial lysates. cDNA microarray was spotted by the transcriptomic technical platform of BiogenOuest. four random pools were constructed each with 4 individual RNAs. for RNA from mock-infected tracheas only one single reference pool (16 individual RNA) was created to ensure an homogeneous baseline between the different experimental conditions. results obtained with mock-infected tracheas were compared to those obtained with LPAI-infected tracheas (SAM two-class analyses) these analyses resulted in a total of 6 datasets (HPAI versus test at 4 and 8 h pi, LPAI versus test at 4 and 8 h pi, HPAI versus LPAI at 4 and 8 h pi, HPAI versus LPAI at 4 and 8 h pi, HPAI SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 10 l of cDNA (diluted 1:10) and 200 nM of each forward and reverse primer. the uniqueness of the amplification product was assessed by a dissociation stage after the last amplification cycle. authors\u2019 contributions PM and V\u00e9ronique Jestin created the original idea of this research and designed the study. authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
