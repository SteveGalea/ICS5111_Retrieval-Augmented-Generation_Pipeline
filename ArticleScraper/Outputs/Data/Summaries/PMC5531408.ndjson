{"summary": "antiviral efficacy of virus-specific TCR-redirected T cells has not yet been demonstrated. despite effective suppression of viral replication, cccDNA persists within the hepatocyte nucleus. complete elimination of the cccDNA remains very challenging. substantial immune-mediated destruction of infected cells or the induction of substantial cccDNA destabilization and silencing appears mandatory for achieving immune control. reconstitution of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response through HBV-specific TCR transfer can constitute an effective therapy for functional HBV cure. specific T cells cannot selectively lyse HBV-infected hepatocytes, but can also trigger inflammatory events within the liver. mRNA TCR\u2013redirected T cells are still able, despite their transient expression of TCR, to control the expansion of HBV-expressing hepatoma cells in mice. mRNA-electroporated T cells acquire HBV specificity and are activated only after incubation with target cells presenting the specific HLA-class I/HBV viral peptide complex. the TCR expression and ability to be activated upon antigen recognition declined with time and was lost after 96 hours. sensitivity of mRNA HBV s183\u2013TCR mRNA\u2013electroporated T cells was similar to that of stably transduced T cells. ability of mRNA TCR\u2013electroporated T cells to recognize different viral mutants was also tested. mRNA TCR\u2013electroporated T cells were cocultured with HBV s183\u2013191 genotype B (FLLTKILTI) or genotype A/C/D (FLLTRILTI) peptide-loaded T2 cells. percentages of CD8+ or CD8 T cells producing IFN- are indicated. the expression of HBV s183\u2013TCR allows activation of HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells when cocultured with HepG2.2.15. mock electroporated T cells were not activated and did not produce any IFN-. coculture of HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells with HepG2 cells (non\u2013HBV producing) did not cause any level of T cell activation. mRNA HBV\u2013specific TCR\u2013electroporated T cells display antiviral efficacy in vivo. PBMCs of an HLA-A201+ healthy subject were used to assess the in vivo antiviral effects of adoptively transferred human T cells transiently expressing an HBV-specific TCR. mRNA HBV\u2013specific TCR\u2013electroporated T cells show antiviral efficacy in vivo. viremia changes relative to baseline levels determined after 4 and 6 days in individual mice upon 1 injection of mRNA HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells (n = 5) and in untreated controls (n = 2). HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells were transferred to mice previously reconstituted with either HLA-A2+ hepatocytes (A2+HBV+) or with HLA-A1+ hepatocytes (A1+HBV+) multiple transfers of HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells caused a progressive and substantial decrease of serum HBV-DNA (median 1 log reduction) in only 12 days. a clear engraftment and enrichment of human CD45+CD8+ T cells could be determined in the livers of A2+HBV+ mice. very few T cells were detected in HBV-infected mice reconstituted with mismatched hepatocytes (HLA-A1) or uninfected animals repopulated with HLA-A2+ matched hepatocytes. transcript levels of human T cell response\u2013related genes (GZMB and IFNG) and human ISGs (MxA, STAT1, TAP1 and HLA-A) were measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and normalized against human housekeeping transcripts. a similar pattern of induction of human IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) could be determined in A2+HBV+ mice that received HBV-specific T cells human genes related to T cell activity (GZMB, IFNG), antigen presentation (HLA-A, TAP1), and ISGs (MxA, STAT1) appeared increased already 4 days after 1 single T cell transfer. levels remained in the same range or slightly decreased 2 days later (day 6) if no further T cells were injected. however, enhancement of genes related to T cell responses was highest after multiple T cell injections. the most pronounced HBeAg decrease was determined in the animal displaying the highest ALT level (2555 IU/l) and the strongest HSA reduction (54%). multiple injections of T cells temporarily expressing HBV-specific TCR via mRNA electroporation are able to lower both the amount of intrahepatic ccDNA loads and to transiently suppress HBV activity in vivo. baseline levels were determined as indicated after 4, 8, and 12 days upon multiple injections of mRNA HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells (n = 3), mRNA c18-TCR T cells (n = 3), and mRNA mock TCR T cells (n = 3) as well as in untreated controls (n = 6). ALT levels were determined in uninfected (n = 3) and HBV-infected mice receiving multiple injections of effector T cells presenting s an increase of caspase 3\u2013positive hepatocytes (2.7%\u20133%) was determined in the liver of infected mice treated with HBV-specific T cells. less than 1% of the cells appeared positive for active caspase 3. the immune-mediated destruction of HBV-infected cells was accompanied by human hepatocyte proliferation that increased to 1.8% in mice receiving 3 injections of c18 T cells. transient expression of HBV-specific TCRs leads to short-lasting liver inflammation and cell damage. prolonged T cell response can result in uncontrolled liver damage. we wanted to assess whether their antiviral and cytotoxic activity were also timely limited. serological analyses performed 9 days after treatment cessation revealed liver damage occurred only transiently. gene expression levels of granzyme, human caspase 1, IFNG, and caspase 8 also returned to baseline in mice. mRNA TCR\u2013expressing T cells display antiviral efficacy in vitro. we tested the cytotoxicity of HBV-specific TCR mRNA\u2013electroporated T cells against target cells that express HBV proteins. we compared their killing ability to that of retroviral transduced T cells that permanently expressed HBV-specific TCR. the results showed that HBV-specific TCR mRNA\u2013electroporated T cells could still recognize and kill few target cells even at a low E:T ratio. sensitivity of HBV c18-TCR\u2013engineered T cells (6) and ability of HBV c18 CD8+ T cell lines to recognize variant epitopes (27) have been previously described. mRNA HBV s183\u2013TCR\u2013electroporated T cells were cocultured with mRNA. the percentages of CD8+ or CD8 T cells producing IFN- are indicated. mock, mRNA HBV s183\u2013TCR, or c18-TCR\u2013electroporated T cells were cocultured with either HepG2 or HepG2.2.15 cells for 24 hours. IFNG gene expression was determined using nanoString analysis. coculture of HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells with HepG2 cells did not cause any level of T cell activation. this was further confirmed in an HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP system. coculture of HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells with HepG2.2.15 caused direct lysis of about 69.5% and a 35% inhibition of HBV-DNA production in HepG2.2.15. human T cells and human hepatocytes were allogenic, but shared HLA-A0201 expression. after being cultured for 1 week in the presence of IL-2 and anti-CD3 to enrich the fraction of T cells, cells were electroporated with HBV s183\u2013TCR. 0.5 million effector HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells were adoptively transferred in each viremic mouse reconstituted with HLA-A2+ hepatocytes. mRNA HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells were transferred to mice previously reconstituted with either HLA-A2+ hepatocytes (A2+HBV+) or with HLA-A1+ hepatocytes (A1+HBV+) multiple transfer of mRNA TCR\u2013T cells caused a progressive and substantial decrease of serum HBV-DNA (median 1 log reduction in A2+HBV+ mice) no reduction of viremia was detected in mismatched mice (n = 3) treated in parallel with the same effector T cells. a light reduction of circulating hepatitis B viral protein HBeAg levels could already be determined in two-thirds of mice exclusively upon transfer of matched HBV s183\u2013TCR T cells. a light reduction of circulating hepatitis B viral protein HBeAg levels could already be determined in two-thirds of mice. mRNA HBV\u2013specific TCR\u2013electroporated T cells are specifically recruited and activated in livers of haplotype-matched HBV-infected mice. mRNA HBV\u2013specific TCR\u2013electroporated T cells are specifically recruited and activated in livers of haplotype-matched HBV-infected mice. multiple injections of activated HBV-restricted T cells led to a clear enhancement of T cell activity markers, such as IFNG (IFN-), which appeared to be the major cytokine produced, and granzyme B (GZMB), in the liver of haplotype-matched HBV-infected mice. a similar pattern of induction of human IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) could be determined in A2+HBV+ mice that received H enhancement of genes related to T cell responses was highest after multiple T cell injections. RNA-electroporated T cells trigger a transient induction of immune markers in the infected livers. however, repeated injections are needed to maintain and further enhance such induction. in vivo antiviral effect of human T cells redirected with different HBV-specific TCRs. we also tested the in vivo antiviral efficacy of T cells electroporated with a different HBV-specific TCR expressing the HLA-A2/core 18\u201327 complex (HBV c18-TCR T cells) as a negative control for functional analysis, a similar quantity of human T cells was also electroporated with mRNA coding for an ALT levels were determined in uninfected (n = 3) and HBV-infected mice receiving multiple injections of effector T cells presenting s183 (n = 3), c18 (n = 3), or HCV NS3 as mock control (n = 3). ALT levels were determined in uninfected (n = 3) and uninfected (s183 median = 1280 ng/ml or c18 median = 160 ng/ml) mice receiving 0.5% of the PHH appeared Ki67 positive in mock-treated and untreated HBV-infected mice. 2 mice displaying baseline viremia levels (107 HBV DNA/ml) and slightly lower amounts of human hepatocytes (baseline HSA = 0.8 mg/ml) received T cells (3 times in 12 days) electroporated with HBV-specific TCRs expressing the HLA-A2/s183\u2013191 and core 18\u201327 complex (s183\u2013T mice that had received 3 injections of T cells expressing the HBV-specific TCRs were sacrificed 9 days after the last T cell infusion (day 21 after treatment begin) to assess the effect of immune cell therapy at a time when HBV-specific TCRs were no longer expressed. ALT levels were determined in 1 HBV-infected animal shortly before T cell injection (baseline) granzyme, human caspase 1, IFNG, and caspase 8 returned to baseline in mice after long-term treatment. virological parameters also rebounded after treatment cessation. discussion Immunotherapy using T cells with redirected specificities has favored strategies that lead to the production of cells with stable expression of the introduced TCR. such engineered T cells can persist in the host and establish a memory-like T cell immunity with therapeutic advantages. effect induced already after 1 single i.p. injection of effector T cells is remarkable. 0.5 million effector T cells were inoculated i.p. in mice harboring almost 50 million HBV-infected human hepatocytes (median 4.7 107 hepatocytes per liver) viremia levels and inflammatory events returned to baseline levels 9 days after treatment cessation. these results demonstrate the ability of human T cells transiently expressing HBV-specific TCRs to reach the intrahepatic environment. single injection of about 0.5 106 cells per mouse achieved about a 0.5 log reduction of HBV viremia. mRNA-electroporated T cells are more likely to be used in patients with chronic hepatitis B. this is a quantity of HBV-specific T cells achievable using our mRNA TCR T cell strategy. however, treatment with redirected HBV-TCR T cells appeared even more effective in mice harboring slightly lower levels of infection. the lower amounts of HBV transcripts, rcDNA, and even cccDNA determined per human hepatocyte were accompanied by an increased rate of cell death and human hepatocyte proliferation as well as transient production of cytokines. these events also suggest that antiviral effects occurring beyond the direct elimination of infected cells took place in the setting of adoptive T cell transfer. mRNA-HBV-TCR-redirected human T cells are also able to recognize HBV-infected human hepatocytes in a milieu in which very high levels of HBV and circulating viral antigens are produced. despite all the odds, we think that we may have underestimated the in vivo antiviral efficacy of autologous TCR-redirected T cells if applied in humans. PBMCs were stimulated with 600 IU/ml IL-2 (rIL-2; R&D Systems) and 50 ng/ml anti-CD3 (OKT-3; eBioscience) in AIM-V plus 2% human AB serum for 8 days. rIL-2 was increased to 1000 IU/ml 1 day before electroporation. cells were resuspended in 100 l of cell line nucleofector Solution V (Lonza 1 105 HBV-producing HepG2.2.15 hepatoma cells per well were seeded overnight in 96-well electronic microtiter plates. TCR mRNA\u2013electroporated T cells were added at a 1:3, 1:5, or 1:100 E:T ratio for 24 hours. human liver chimeric uPA/SCID/ILR2 mice were generated by transplanting 1 million thawed human hepatocytes in 3-week-old mice anesthetized with isofluoran. levels of human liver chimerism were determined by measuring HSA in mouse serum using the HSA ELISA Quantitation Kit (Bethyl Laboratories, Biomol GmbH) primers and probes specific for total HBV RNA and pgRNA were used for reverse transcription and amplification. expression of the human housekeeping gene GAPDH was used for normalization. HBsAg and HBeAg quantification were performed on the Abbott Architect platforms. mouse livers were costained with mouse monoclonal anti-human cytokeratin 18 Ab and rabbit anti-human active caspase 3. levels of human cytokines in the serum of humanized mice were determined using the MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1 107 activated T cells were suspended in 100 l of cell line nucleofector solution V (Lonza) cells were resuspended in 100 l of cell line nucleofector Solution V (Lonza) rIL-2 was increased to 1000 IU/ml 1 day before electroporation. 105 hepG2.2.15 hepatoma cells per well were seeded overnight in 96-well plates. TCR mRNA\u2013electroporated T cells were added at a 1:3 E:T ratio. supernatants from coculture experiments were collected for measurement of ALT. infected and stably HBV-infected human liver chimeric mice performed as previously reported. human hepatocytes obtained from 2 donors, one with haplotype HLA-A2 and one with HLA-A1 were used as indicated in Results. HBsAg and HBeAg quantification were performed on the Abbott Architect platforms. the results were displayed as signal versus noise (SC/O) to determine gene expression levels, human- and mouse-specific primers from the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay System were used. cytokines in the serum of humanized mice were determined using the MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PHHs were isolated from rejected explant livers using protocols approved by the ethical committee of the city and state of Hamburg. all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/EEC)"}
