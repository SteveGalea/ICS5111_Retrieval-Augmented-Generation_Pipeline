{"summary": "ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs. the tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical. the ubiquitin moiety can be released from substrates through the action of deubiquitinating proteases. proteasome-associated DUBs enhance the rate of proteasomal degradation by removing bulky poly-ubiquitin chains from substrate proteins prior to proteolysis. ubiquitin-like molecules show sequence and structural similarity to ubiquitin. ISG15 consists of two ubiquitin domains in a tandem arrangement, similar to FAT10. it co-opts at least one of ubiquitin's conjugating enzymes, Ubc8 [12], [13] and the ubiquitin ligase Herc5 [14]\u2013[17]. however, the molecular and regulatory consequences of ISGylation remain unknown. usP18 clusters close to USP5 (IsoT1) and its isoform USP13 (IsoT3). previous work had identified USP5 as a protease with affinity for both ubiquitin [27] and ISG15. to probe for additional ISG15-reactive proteases, we have cloned and expressed a total of 22 human DUB homologs. indicated with arrows are DUB homologs that were cloned and expressed by in vitro transcription/translation (IVT) red arrows depict DUBs that bound to neither probe (UbVME, ISG15VS, or SUMO1VS), while black arrows indicate DUBs that formed covalent adducts. we found no evidence for any of the DUBs evaluated here to display reactivity toward the SUMO1 probe. the presence of the reactive group alone is clearly not sufficient for binding to the active-site cysteine of a protease. the presence of the reactive group alone is clearly not sufficient for binding to the active-site cysteine of a protease. the decrease in gel mobility is based on steric properties of the branched adduct. in our sample set, the observed size increase of the ISG15VS-DUB adducts based on SDS-PAGE very closely matched a logarithmic equation. this mutation abolished all labeling (Figure 3B) mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue to serine abolishes its reactivity toward UbVME and ISG15VS. the smallest version of these adducts (a UbVME dimer) has a maximum electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the diubiquitin-like ISG15VS when complexed to USP14. we examined labeling of USP14 with the ubiquitin- and the ISG15-based probes as a function of the concentration of added purified proteasomes. as anticipated, the inclusion of purified proteasomes had no effect on the ISG15VS- or UbVME-reactivity of USP5. the effect was similar in magnitude to that seen for the ubiquitin probe. ding affinity is depicted on the y-axis as percent in labeling intensity. the ratio in the absence of exogenous proteasomes is defined as 100%. recombinant USP14 in its purified form bound to electrophilic probes. we did not detect robust hydrolytic activity against ubiquitin-AMC or against ubiquitin- or ISG15-linked isopeptide fusion proteins. proteasome-associated USP14 has ISG15-specific isopeptidase activity. the biotinylated peptide heptamer is attached to either ISG15 or SUMO1 in isopeptide-linkage. after overnight incubation, the proteasome-enriched fraction is completely cleaved. this activity is sensitive to NEM. a genome-wide set of C-terminal GFP fusion proteins for yeast had shown remarkably few with altered function or subcellular distribution (5%), validating the choice of such C-terminal modifications. we cloned and transiently expressed five USP-EYFP constructs in 293T cells: USP5, USP13, USP14, USP3 and USP36. USP3 is predicted to be a nuclear protein [34] and USP36 was identified as a nucleolar protein [35] both proteins were detected in the expected subcellular compartment. results indicate that ISG15-specific proteases are expressed throughout the cell \u2013 a feature also proposed for DUBs. USP13EYFP is expressed mainly in the nucleus, with lower levels in the nucleus. USP3EYFP and USP36EYFP (lower right panel) are detected in the nucleus and nucleolus respectively. previous work had identified USP5 as a protease with affinity for both ubiquitin and ISG15. SG15 installed an electrophilic trap at their C-terminus to obtain the active-site probes ubiquitin-vinylmethyl ester (UbVME), SUMO1VME and ISG15VS, respectively. probes of this type form a covalent adduct with the catalytic cysteine residue of active DUBs to yield a thioether-linked adduct between enzyme and probe. IVT was used to generate DUBs for profiling activity toward ISG15VS, UbVME and SUMO1VME probes. samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, as shown for USP18 (A), USP14 (B), USP5 (C), USP13 (D), USP2 (E), and CGI-77 (F). the ISG15 probe has a mass of 17.4 kDa, whereas the size increase observed for each of the DUBs investigated here is in the order of 25\u2013110 kDa. the correlation between the abnormal shift and the initial mass of the unmodified DUB suggests that the decrease in gel mobility is based on steric properties of the branched adduct. unexpected apparent molecular mass of ISG15VS-DUB adducts is caused by unusual behavior in SDS-PAGE. the absence of any adducts in the C114S mutant of USP14 excludes the possibility of multiple binding sites for the probes. monovalently modified USP14 results in an adduct of predicted size. this complex is unique to the mixture containing both USP14 and ISG15VS. this activity may in fact be strictly dependent on association with the proteasome, as shown for Ubp6. activity of USP14 toward UbVME and ISG15VS increases as a function of the concentration of added purified 26S proteasomes (in mg/ml) the activity of USP5 remains unaffected. proteasome-associated USP14 has ISG15-specific isopeptidase activity. the biotinylated peptide heptamer is attached to either ISG15 or SUMO1 in isopeptide-linkage. after overnight incubation, the heptamer is completely cleaved. this activity is sensitive to NEM. the five-hour pellet represents heavy cytosolic complexes. the five-hour pellet contains USP14 as the only ISG15-reactive DUB (blue asterisk) the wealth of USPs found in the human proteome likely reflects substrate specificity, but potentially complementation in terms of expression profiles. 13EYFP was expressed mainly in the nucleus in a speckled pattern. the presence of the C-terminal YFP fusion does not interfere with the endogenous distribution of these enzymes, we analyzed USP3EYFP and USP36EYFP. 293T cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. USP13EYFP is expressed mainly within the nucleus, in a speckled pattern. USP3EYFP and USP36EYFP are detected in the nucleus and nucleolus respectively. structures of USP2 and USP14 accommodate ubiquitin (green) in a shallow groove, measuring approximately 25\u201330 in diameter. based on these complexes, the C-terminal domain of ISG15 (red) can be modeled into the groove to replace ubiquitin. a recent study suggests that USP14 might have a more complex role. the close sequence relationship between USP5 and USP13 is contrasted by the functional differences and localization of these two proteases. the ubiquitin gene is prone to duplications and insertions, leading to the formation of new fusion proteins. ISG15 knockout likely reflects a role in anti-microbial or anti-viral defense. adaptation to the specific needs of host immunity often demands polymorphism. ubiquitin gene is prone to duplications and insertions, leading to the formation of new fusion proteins. ubiquitin and ubiquitin were initially reported to be cytokines [61], [62]. cDNAs were cloned from a human kidney cDNA library. cDNAs encoding full-length DUBs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1. in vitro transcription and translation (IVT) IVT was performed using the \u201cTNT-T7 Quick Reticulocyte Lysate System\u201d kit (Promega) for 30 to 45 min (0.25\u20131 g DNA per reaction) then, aliquots of the reaction mix were treated with RNase B (1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 10 min and incubated with the probes as described below. labeling with ubiquitin and UbL electrophilic probes has been described purified human 26S proteasomes for the experiments in Figure 4 were purchased from Biomol International and inhibited with MG132 (50 M) the observed size of ISG15VS-adducts in SDS-PAGE (8%) followed a logarithmic equation. the solution was mixed and incubated for 15 hours at 37\u00b0C. the reaction mixture was transferred to a microcentrifuge membrane filter (Vivascience, 5000 Da MWCO), diluted to 600 L total volume with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and concentrated at 4\u00b0C to 50 L. cell lines, transient transfections and anti-YFP immunoblotting 293T cells were maintained in DME medium as described [67]. a liposome-mediated transfection protocol (5\u201310 g of DNA/20 l of Lipofectamine-2000 per 10 cm dish; Invitrogen) as described [67], cell lines were analyzed between 24 and 48 h after transfection. cDNAs were cloned from a human kidney cDNA library (BioChain Institute, Inc.) all cDNAs encoding full-length DUBs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1. in vitro transcription and translation (IVT) IVT was performed using the \u201cTNT-T7 Quick Reticulocyte Lysate System\u201d kit (Promega) for 30 to 45 min (0.25\u20131 g DNA per reaction) then, aliquots of the reaction mix were treated with RNase B (1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 10 min and incubated with the probes as described below. thesis of ISG15- and SUMO1-branched peptide conjugates was added to 50 L of conjugation buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, 40 mM ATP) the solution was mixed thoroughly and to this was added ISG15 activating enzyme (Boston Biochem, ISG15 E1, 50 nM final) and UbcH8 (Boston Biochem, 250 nM proteasome activity was inhibited with MG132 (50 M) 10 g of fraction protein were incubated with 0.2 g of HA-tagged ISG15VS in a total volume of 10 l for two hours at room temperature. cleavage assay for ISG15- or SUMO1-branched peptides was performed at 37\u00b0C using 20 g of total protein from the proteasome-enriched fraction. ofluorescence experiments were performed as described [67] with minor modifications. cells were allowed to attach to slides overnight."}
