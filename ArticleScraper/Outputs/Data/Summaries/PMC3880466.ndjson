{"summary": "chemokines constitute the largest family of cytokines, and chemokine receptors constitute the largest branch of the subfamily of rhodopsin-like 7TM receptors. chemokine receptors are differentially expressed by all leukocytes and many nonhematopoietic cells, including cancer cells. vertebrate G protein-coupled chemokine receptors represent the largest group of chemokine receptors. chemokine subgroups are structurally defined and named by the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines. most neutrophil-targeted chemokines are in the CXC group, and most monocyte-targeted chemokines are in the CC group. functional chemokines and chemokine receptors are also encoded by herpesviruses and poxviruses. chemokine receptors are 7TM proteins that may signal constitutively and in response to binding host chemokines. soluble non\u20137TM chemokine-binding proteins, typically with broad specificity for inflammatory chemokines, have also been found in herpesviruses and poxviruses. general principles of chemokine structure and function are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and Figs. 2\u20136. specific details for each receptor are described in the individual sections. marrow CXCL13 BLC O43927 O55038 B and T-cell trafficking in lymphoid tissue CXCL14 BRAK O95715 Q6AXC2 Macrophage migration Cxcl15 lungkine NA Q9WVL7 Neutrophil trafficking CXCL16 SR-PSOX Q9H2A7 Q8BSU2 NKT cell trafficking and survival CXCL17 Q6UXB2 Q8R3 67 NA DC maturation factor CCL17 TARC Q92583 Q9WUZ6 Th2 immune response CCL18 PARC P55774 NA DC attraction of T and B cells Hematopoiesis CCL19 ELC Q99731 O70460 T cell and DC homing to lymph node CCL20 MIP-3, LARC P78556 O89093 GALT development B and DC homing to lymph node CCL22 MDC O00626 O88 chemokine receptor nomenclature and key immunoregulatory functions Name CD# Common Aliases Accession Number Key Immunoregulatory functions Human mouse G Protein-Coupled Chemokine Receptors CXCR1 CD181 IL8RA P25024 Q810W6 Neutrophil trafficking CXCR2 CD182 IL8RB P25025 P35343 B-cell lymphopoiesis Neutrophil egress from bone marrow Neutroph CC CKR2, MCP-1-R P41597 P51683 Monocyte trafficking Type 1 adaptive immunity CCR3 CD193 CC CKR3, Eotaxin receptor P51677 P51678 Type 2 adaptive immunity Eosinophil distribution and trafficking CCR4 CD194 CC CKR4 P51679 P51680 Homing of resident memory T cells to skin Thymopoiesis; Th2 immune response CCR5 CD195 chemokine scavenging ACKR3 CXCR7; CCX-CKR, CCBP2, CCR11 Q9NPB9 Q924I3 Chemokine scavenging CCRL2 (ACKR5) CKRX, CRAM-A, O00421 O35457 Not defined L-CCR, CRAM-B, HCR, CCR11 PITPNM3 (ACKR6) two chemokines, CXCR1 and CXCR4, have been structurally defined. they can exist as membrane-bound or cleaved forms, mediating direct G protein-independent cell-cell adhesion and chemotaxis. the first chemokine receptors defined at the molecular level were human CXCR1 and CXCR2 (Holmes et al., 1991; Murphy and Tiffany, 1991), the prototypic neutrophil chemotactic receptors for a group of CXC chemokines distinguished by the presence of the amino acid motif ELR in the N-terminal domain. IL-8 binds with high affinity to and potently activates both receptors. CXCR1 also binds CXCL6 (granulocyte chemotactic protein-2) and possibly CXCL7 (neutrophil-activating protein-2), while CXCR2 binds promiscuously to all seven ELR+ CXC chemokines. migration inhibitory factor, the N\u2032-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, was suggested to have sequence/charge/structure similarities to ELR+ CXC chemokines. LL-37, an -helical peptide derived by cleavage of cathelicidin, does not. the viral chemokine vCXCL1 of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) binds to both C many members of the CXCR1/CXCR2-ELR+ CXC chemokine axis have been identified in other species. however, a murine ortholog of CXCL8 does not exist. the best characterized mouse ELR+ CXC chemokines are KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 or MIP-2. the human and mouse chemokine gene repertoires are distinct. the syntenic positions of chemokine genes located in clusters are shown schematically and aligned for mouse and human. Gi2 coupling determinants on the receptors include intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) and ICL3. the C\u2032-terminal domain regulates receptor activation and desensitization. many downstream mediators are induced after CXCL8 activation. in-mediated adhesion and transendothelial migration requires activation of many proteins that may form a \u201cchemosynapse\u201d with the receptors. CXCR1- and CXCR2-dependent migration requires activation of many proteins that may form a \u201cchemosynapse\u201d with the receptors. CXCR1 and CXCR2 may also cross-talk with nucleotide receptors. the precise physiologic relevance of desensitization and receptor internalization is unclear. the precise physiologic relevance of desensitization and receptor internalization is unclear. on T cells, CXCR1 is detected mainly on effector CD8+ cells. not CXCR2 is functional on CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) many types of nonhematopoietic cells express one or both receptors (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, neurons, mesenchymal stem cells) both CXCR1 and CXCR2 are reduced on neutrophils from patients with hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome. CXCR2 may also mediate protection against pulmonary infection by Nocardia asteroides and Aspergillus. the chemokines are also expressed by associated stromal cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes. the chemokines are also expressed by associated stromal cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes. psoriasis may not have been a good target, because neutrophils are not prominent in this disease. anogens has indicated that 50% of patients achieved a greater than 60% improvement. up to 15% of patients achieved a greater than 90% improvement in disease scores after a 6-week treatment cycle.

CXCR3 is not expressed on naive T cells, but is rapidly upregulated after dendritic cell activation. Cxcr3 is required on CD8+ cells for infiltration into the brain. this is true during herpes simplex virus-2 infection of the vaginal mucosa. this is true during colitis and during colitis. deficiency in CXCR3 also reduces autoimmune diabetes and infiltration of T cells into the kidney in systemic lupus erythematosus. similar results have been seen in the spleen where Cxcr3 plays an important role in bringing CD8+ T cells into contact with antigen-activated innate immune cells. in vitro chemotactic activity of CXCL10 and CXCL11 was shown to be GAG binding-independent. ability of these chemokines to induce CXCR3-dependent T-cell migration in vivo was shown to be dependent on their ability to bind GAGs. translation of the putative human CXCR3-B splice variant results in an extracellular N terminus that is 48 amino acids longer than the originally described CXCR3 receptor (referred to as CXCR3-A), with the remaining sequence identical to CXCR3-A. the remaining sequence is identical to CXCR3-A. SCH 546738 from Merck binds to human CXCR3 with high affinity (kD = 0.4 nM) binds to human CXCR3 with high affinity (kD = 0.4 nM) and displaces radiolabeled CXCL10 and CXCL11 from human CXCR3 with an IC50 ranging from 0.8 to 2.2 nM in a noncompetitive manner. SCH 546738 attenuated disease development in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model and reduced disease severity in rat and mouse EAE models. SCH 546738 alone achieved dose-dependent prolongation of rat cardiac allograft survival. CXCR3 blockade for 30 days synergized with short-term, low-dose anti-CD154 monoclonal antibodies. the drug had low nanomolar affinity for CXCL10 and was safe in humans. in phase II clinical trials, it demonstrated efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. six different splice variants of CXCL12 have been reported. most common are CXCL12 and CXCL12. most important is the envelope protein gp120 of CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV. inflammatory cytokines and danger molecules released from damaged cells can bind and activate CXCR4. HMGB1 is a highly conserved nuclear protein known to act as a damage-associated molecular pattern after release from dead cells. CXCR4 is the first chemokine receptor for which highly diffracting crystals have been reported. helix VII reaches two turns longer into extracellular space than in other GPCRs. helix VII ends with a cysteine that forms a second extracellular disulfide bridge with Cys28 located in the N terminus. the distinct extracellular architecture of CR4 is consistent with the large size of its ligand. interaction of two receptor protomers is mediated by hydrophobic side chains of amino acids located in helix V with some participation of Lys267 from helix VI. many reports using overexpression systems suggest that CXCR4 arranges in heterodimers with some, but not all, chemokine receptors. the dimeric chemokine is only a partial agonist at CXCR4. it is expressed on almost all hematopoietic cells, vascular endothelial cells, in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system, microglia, and astrocytes. the protein is widely expressed on nondifferentiated and differentiated tissues. a role of CXCR4 in lymph node metastasis is not clear despite the expression of the chemokine. the main activities associated with CXCR4 are cell migration (homing) and positioning (homeostasis), neovascularization, survival, and growth. CXCR4 plays key roles in immune system development during lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis. the receptor retains hematopoietic precursors in the BM, mediates B-cell segregation in lymphoid organs and mediates neutrophil egress from BM. WHIM mutations result in partial truncation of the C terminus of CXCR4. mechanism involves enhanced G protein coupling as well as arrestin-dependent signaling. loss of phosphorylation sites on the C terminus important for receptor desensitization and internalization. the class of peptide-based inhibitors consists of antibodies, chemokine analogs, derivatives of the horseshoe crab protein polyphemusin, and endogenous defen. the class of peptide-based inhibitors consists of antibodies, chemokine analogs, derivatives of the horseshoe crab protein polyphemusin, and endogenous defen. human defensin-3 downregulates CXCR4 without activating canonical Gi-coupled signal transduction. from this group, the 14-amino acid polypeptide 4F-benzoyl TN14003 (BKT140) is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for multiple myeloma. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ) (BMS); Medarex (Princeton, NJ) (BMS-936564/MDX-1338) is currently being tested for treatment of multiple myeloma (phase 1). a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers was completed by Ablynx (Ghent, Belgium). vMIP-II is a strong antagonist of CXCR4, preventing binding of CXCL12 and activation of the receptor. low molecular weight antagonists of CXCR4 include the bicyclam AMD3100 (plerixafor or Mozobil; Sanofi, Paris, France) it also promotes leukocytosis, including release of precursors from bone marrow niches. the success of plerixafor has paved the way for a number of companies to target CXCR4. the success of plerixafor has paved the way for a number of companies to target the drug. POL6326 has successfully completed phase I clinical trials in the united kingdom with 74 healthy volunteers. the drug was safe and well tolerated and is currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial for safety and efficacy in transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. CXCR5 has been detected on all peripheral blood and tonsillar B cells, but not on plasmablast and plasma cells. it is also present on a small subset of peripheral blood memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. in secondary lymphatic tissue, the majority of CD4+ T cells are positive. human CXCR6 is located on chromosome 3 (Liao et al., 1997b; Loetscher et al., 1997) at 3p21.31, between CCR9 and XCR1, in the cluster that contains CC, XC, and CX3C (but not CXC) chemokine receptors. it is notable that in phylogenetic analysis, CXCR6 is most closely related not to other CXC analysis shows that CXCL16 is not closely related to other CXC chemokines. the most striking feature is a transmembrane domain (Fig. 2). immobilized CXCL16 has been reported to mediate adhesion in the absence of CXCR6 signaling in some systems. antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, and possibly B cells (Matloubian et al., 2000; Shimaoka et al., 2000; Wilbanks et al., 2001); on fibroblastic reticular cells, activated T cells, endothelial cells, and cancer cells (Hojo et al., 2007; Darash-Yahana et al., 2009 nontranslated region of CXCR6 has been associated with long-term nonprogression to AIDS in several cohorts. expression on human CD4+ T cells is restricted to effector/memory population. CXCR6 is significantly enriched on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells found in inflamed tissue. expression of CXCR6 and/or CXCL16 is increased in prostate cancer, with expression correlating with aggressiveness. expression of CXCR6 is associated with increased inflammation and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. CXCR7 (now ACKR3, see Section III.A.3) B. CC Chemokine Receptors 1. CCR1 is broadly expressed on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. binds promiscuously to the inflammatory CC chemokines CCL3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 or MIP-1), CCL5 (previously named reduced upon activation, normal T expressed and secreted or phospholipase C, protein kinase C, calcium flux, and PLA2 are all able to transduce signals through CCR1 in a human osteosarcoma line via Gi/Go, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C-mediated pathways. the ligands CCL3, CCL7, CCL5, and CCL15 can all inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in cells transfected with CCR1 in this state, the receptor may scavenge inflammatory chemokines and suppress inflammation. CCR1 can also be silenced by drugs, including statins and estrogens. mice lacking Ccl3 or Ccr1 are protected from pulmonary inflammation secondary to acute pancreatitis. Ccr1 also appears to be involved in remodeling after myocardial ischemia. the fact that Ccl3 neutralization is more effective than Ccr1 inactivation suggests that other Ccl3 receptors such as Ccr5 may play a role in pathogenesis. MLN3897 (Millennium, Cambridge, MA) inhibited CCL3-induced immune cell recruitment in a guinea pig skin sensitization model and impaired osteoclastogenesis by multiple myeloma cells. CP-481,715 (Pfizer, New York, NY) was effective in models of inflammation in CCR1-humanized mice. a phase II trial in RA was stopped after 6 weeks because the compound did not demonstrate efficacy. no efficacy data are available from phase II clinical trials. CCR2 is a high-affinity receptor for members of the monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) family, including CCL2, CCL7, and CCL13 in humans. the corresponding murine chemokines Ccl2 (also known as JE/MCP-1) and Ccl7 also are CCR2 agonists. low levels of CCR2 agonists secreted under normal conditions maintain homeostatic migration of inflammatory monocytes from bone marrow into the circulation. low levels of CCR2 agonists secreted under normal conditions maintain homeostatic migration of inflammatory monocytes from bone marrow into the circulation. different CCR2 agonists can trigger different signaling cascades (biased agonism) different CCR2 agonists can trigger different signaling cascades (biased agonism) different CCR2 agonists can trigger different signaling cascades. a pathogenetic role for Ccr2 in atherosclerosis is clearly established. protection is associated with a reduced number of macrophages infiltrating the arterial wall, consistent with the major role of Ccr2/Ccl2 in recruitment of inflammatory Ly6Chigh/CCR2+ monocytes. recruitment of Ly6Clow/Ccr2 cells depends only upon Ccr5. the role of Ccr2 in atherogenesis and infectious disease models may involve trafficking of monocytes from blood to tissue but also from bone marrow to blood. a nonredundant role for Ccr2 on microglia has been demonstrated in neuropathic pain models. the relationship of CCR2 to Alzheimer\u2019s disease is unclear. analysis of CCL2 or CCR2 haplotypes has led to conflicting results. a recent report showed that CCR2 blockade was effective in reducing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and leukocyte recruitment in a primate model of asthma. CCR2 has also been shown to be required for appropriate type 1 polarized immune responses. during mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Ccr2 is required to recruit macrophages and dendritic cells to the lung. CCR2+ monocytes recruited in the brain of HIV-infected patients have also been shown to sustain virus replication and HIV encephalitis. inhibition of Ccr2 signaling blocks their recruitment, inhibits metastasis in vivo, and prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice. inflammatory monocytes belong to a heterogeneous population of so-called myeloid-derived suppressor cells. CCR2 may also be involved in chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue. it has also been implicated in age-related macular degeneration in humans and in mouse models. nM was their clinical candidate in phase II clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (Horuk, 2009). the CCR2 antagonist failed to show any significant improvement compared with placebo for any of the end points studied. no data from the clinical trials were ever reported. two phase II clinical trials have been described for BMS-741672. the first was a double-blind study for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with type II diabetes. the second trial was a 12-week randomized double-blind study. two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the CCR2 ligand CCL2 have been described. the first, ABN-912 from Millennium, failed to demonstrate efficacy in phase II clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis. CNTO 888 is a nanomolar affinity antibody from Janssen Biotech (Philadelphia, PA) that is in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. the inflammatory chemokines CCL3L1 (LD78), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL11, CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL15 (HCC-2), CCL24 (eotaxin-2), and CCL28 (MEC) the \u201ceotaxins\u201d CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 are the most potent and selective (Fig. 6). PITPNM3/Nir1 and CCR8 are also a natural antagonist of CCR3. CCR3-signaling pathways primarily induce cellular chemotaxis and intracellular calcium flux. also involved in eosinophil and basophil degranulation. the role of Ccr3 and its ligands in asthma has been difficult to define. in one study, Ccr3 was shown to play an essential role in eosinophil recruitment to the lung in acute models of experimental asthma. in another study, mice deficient in Ccl11 had only partially impaired eosinophil recruitment to the lung. CCL11 may contribute more to the early phase of allergen-induced recruitment of eosinophils into the airways of patients with allergic asthma. kinetic induction patterns of Ccl11 and Ccl24 are similar to those observed in asthmatics. Ccl24 has a central role in the development of airway eosinophilia. CCR3 is expressed in choroidal neovascular endothelial cells of patients with AMD. the three eotaxins are also expressed in retinal pigmented epithelium. neither eosinophils nor mast cells are found in human CNV. GW766944 failed to show efficacy in phase III for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. another drug, TPI-ASM8 (Pharmamix, Sydney, Australia) contains two modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides. the compound has an IC50 of 8.1 nM for the inhibition of eotaxin binding to CCR3 and an IC50 of 40 nM for the inhibition of binding to the H1 histamine receptor. no further development of the compound has been reported. Imai et al., 1997a, 1998; Godiska et al., 1997) were found to be the specific ligands for CCR4. CCL17 and CCL22 are both highly expressed in the thymus. in peripheral blood, CCR4 is expressed by platelets and mediates platelet activation in the presence of low levels of primary agonists. this may explain the apparent universal expression of CCR4 in Th2 cells. the importance of the CCR4 axis in allergic diseases has been amply demonstrated using mouse models. the crucial role of CCR4 in skin-homing T cells has been amply demonstrated. the dominance of CCL22 over CCL17 in CCR4 desensitization coupled with their differential expression in inflamed skin. tolerance induction in an allogeneic cardiac transplantation model with anti-CD154 plus donor-specific transfusion was shown to be accompanied by dramatic intragraft upregulation of Foxp3 levels. tolerance induction could not be achieved in Ccr4/ recipients, suggesting that the recruitment of Foxp3-expressing Treg cells to an allograft tissue was highly dependent on Ccr4. KW-0761, a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR4 with defucosylation to enhance ADCC activity, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in Japan. clinical trials have been conducted against ATL and other peripheral T-cell lymphomas with highly promising results. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor \u201dcelebrity,\u201d well known throughout the scientific community and the general population because of its importance as the major HIV coreceptor controlling susceptibility to HIV infection and disease progression. in 2007, 13 years after the receptor was first identified, the HIV connection immediately catalyzed drug development programs for CCR5. specificity of ligand-receptor interaction lies within extracellular loops, particularly ECL2. additional residues in the amino terminal segment and post-translational modifications there are important binding determinants. CCR5 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells (both macrophages and DCs) and immune effector cells (T-lymphocytes with memory/effector phenotype and NK cells) in the CD4+ T-cell lineage, it is preferentially expressed on Th1, Th17, and Treg cells. interactions between CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor cells trigger CCR5 recruitment at the immunologic synapse. chemokines can act as costimulatory molecules for engaged T cells through CCR5 relocalized at the immune synapse. expression on monocytes and dendritic cell subtypes has been investigated. CCR5 is a major chemotactic mediator for murine endothelial progenitor cells. it suggests that it may regulate neovascularization and wound healing. 1% of North American Caucasians is homozygous for this null allele yet appears healthy. homozygous for CCR532 has had no PCR-detectable virus in blood or tissue since then off antiretroviral therapy. an ancient selective factor, possibly bubonic plague, has been suspected. additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) have been identified in the CCR5 promoter region. at the microbiological level, they showed reduced efficiency in clearance of L. monocytogenes infection (Zhou et al., 2001, 2005), encephalomyocarditis virus (Christmann et al., 2011), genital herpes simplex virus (Thapa et al., 2007) and increased mortality rates associated with fatal pneumonitis after influenza infection (Dawson et al., 2000a) chemokine analogs with antagonist activity, such as methionyl-RANTES, and aminooxypentane-linked-RANTES. maraviroc is potent against all known CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains, with a mean IC90 value of 2 nM. more recently, it was approved for individuals with drug-sensitive HIV-1 strains as a first-line drug in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Schering-Plough has disclosed its clinical CCR5 inhibitor SCH 351125, also known as SCH-C. this compound was a potent CCR5 inhibitor but phase I studies were suspended due to QTc prolongation in patients. the compound was active against HIV-1 clinical isolates with an EC50 of 61 pM (Baba et al., 2005). Phase I clinical studies in healthy volunteers have shown the drug to be safe, with a mean half-life of 35 to 40 hours, supporting once a day dosing. progenics is developing a humanized monoclonal antibody to CCR5 (PRO 140) as a potent inhibitor of viral entry for the treatment of R5 HIV-1-infected individuals. a small phase IIa clinical trial showed the drug was safe and it has been given \u201cfast track\u201d designation by the FDA. CCR6 is the only receptor identified thus far for the chemokine CCL20 (previously called MIP-3) (Baba et al., 1997; Greaves et al., 1997; Liao et al., 1997a; Power et al., 1997). CCR6 is expressed by subsets of dendritic cells, particularly in their immature state. Ccr6-deficient mice have also been shown to have defects in numbers of antibody-producing cells in the gut mucosa after oral immunization. recent work in sheep has suggested that CCR6 may also be important for trafficking of B cells to the skin. the data suggest an important role for CCR6 in the recruitment of dendritic cells to inflammatory tissue sites. CCR6+ human effector/memory T cells were found to express markers for trafficking to both skin and gut. the relationship between CCR6 expression and IL-17 production extends to CD8+ T cells. Ccr6 has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of mouse models of autoimmune disease, including arthritis (Hirota et al., 2007), experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), acute graft-versus host disease (Varona et al., 2005), and psoriasis (Hedrick et al., 2009). despite the data to date linking CCR6 to a number of important diseases, no publications have described C helial cells of afferent lymphatics, endothelial cells in lymph node, and reticular cells in T-cell zones of lymph node. neither ligand is expressed in B-cell areas or sinuses of lymph nodes or by blood-derived leukocytes. chemokine domain appears to be cleaved from GAG binding domain. 7 mediates recirculation of naive and central memory T cells from blood into lymph node T-cell zones across high endothelial venules expressing CCL19 and CCL21. both chemokines are displayed on the luminal and abluminal sides of the high endothelial venules. atrophic T-cell zones populated by few naive T cells have similar phenotypes. contact sensitivity, delayed type hypersensitivity, and antibody production follow a delayed course. this explains why these mice show increased sensitivity to various pathogens. chemokines such as CCL21 are bound to the surface of lymph node DCs in vivo. T cells are costimulated \u201cin trans\u201d and sequentially after initial engagement with their chemokine-rich environment. polarized effector subsets Th1 and Th2 downregulate CXCR5 and CCR7. mouse CCL8 (MCP-2) was recently identified as a second mammalian chemokine ligand for both mouse and human CCR8 (Islam et al., 2011). mouse Ccl1 does not signal through human CCR8 and only binds human CCR8 with low affinity (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012). human CCL7 is an antagonist for vMIP-1 but not for human CCL1 activity on human CCR8. recently, CCL18 was found to act at CCR8 (Islam et al., 2013). in human and mouse tissues, CCR8 is highly expressed constitutively in thymus. CCR8 is abundantly expressed on activated highly polarized in vitro differentiated Th2 cells. expression on T cells recovered from the BAL of patients with asthma is restricted to more terminally differentiated Th2 cells previously exposed to antigen. STAT4 binding in the upstream region of the CCR8 gene was inhibitory. successive rounds of polarization would enable removal of the inhibitory regulation of STAT4 on CCR8 expression. both ex vivo human studies and in vivo mouse studies support an important role for CCR8-mediated leukocyte trafficking to skin. multiple mouse studies support a role for the Ccr8 pathway in promoting chronic allergic inflammation. this includes a mast cell-mediated model of chronic asthma, a model of fungal asthma, and a model of chronic atopic dermatitis. shorter acute models may not capture differentiation and reactivation of Ccr8+ highly differentiated Th2 cells. studies also support a role for the CCR8 pathway in preventing apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis. a recent genome-wide association multivariate survival analysis study of a treatment naive cohort identified significant associations for CCR3, CCR8 and CCRL2 polymorphisms. Berlex has identified a potent nonpeptide agonist of CCR8, ZK-756326, that could competitively displace CCL1 (Haskell et al., 2006). CCR9 is a homeostatic receptor specific for CCL25 (previously called thymus expressed chemokine) a chemokine strongly expressed in the thymus and to a lesser extent in the small intestine. DN1 represents the earliest thymus immigrant progenitor cells. many DN2 thymocytes will fail to rearrange their TCR chain in frame. they will never be able to express a productive T-cell receptor. this requires a quality control step where developing DN3 thymocytes are selected. the importance of the CCL25/CCR9 axis in T-cell development is likely to extend beyond original thymus colonization and beta selection. some CD4+CD8+ and single positive CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes also express CCR9 and migrate in response to CCL25. a subset of dendritic cells that may represent precursors to mature dendritic cells also expresses CCR9. chemokine receptors have been implicated in the metastasis of certain melanomas. melanoma metastasizes to lymph node, lung, liver, and other organs but not small intestine. CCX282 has been reported to have IC50 values of 5.4 nM for inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization and 3.4 nM for inhibition of chemotaxis of cells expressing CCR9. oral administration was efficacious in murine models of ileal Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. ostatic chemokines include CCL27 (previously called CTACK) and CCL28 (previously called MEC) in different chromosomal locations, likely because of a recent translocation. CCR10 mediates diverse processes from homeostatic leukocyte trafficking to skin cancer. +CLA+ T cells do not express the gut homing receptor 47. the interaction between CCL25 and CCR9 is responsible for the recruitment of 47 cells to the gut. if the chemokine receptor profile of melanoma cells changes, the cancer may metastasize. a recent study using a Ccr10/ mouse suggests that CCL28 and CCR10 may not be the only chemokine/receptor pair involved in the recruitment of IgA plasmablasts. however, within the gut another chemokine/receptor axis may be responsible for IgA responses. no CCR10-blocking agents have been reported yet. CX3CR1 is considered a \u201cmonogamous\u201d inflammatory receptor for CX3CL1. recently CCL26, a chemokine highly selective for CCR3, was found to be a 10-fold less potent agonist at CX3CR1. this has not yet been confirmed by other groups. the pattern of HIV strains that can use CX3CR1 is restricted. antibodies have been useful to delineate CX3CR1 expression in humans. transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under control of the promoter have been the predominant tool to track expression in mice. expression of CX3CR1 is a powerful tool to identify leukocyte subsets. distinct surface Cx3cr1 levels delineates two functional subsets of murine blood monocytes. this dichotomy appears conserved in humans as CD14+CD16, and CD14lowCD16+ monocytes may resemble \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cresident\u201d monocytes. CD11c+CD103+Cx3cr1CD11b+ and CD11c+CD103Cx3cr1+CD11b+. both populations able to efficiently present antigens to CD4+ T cells. CX3CR1 is expressed in brain and on retinal microglial cells. reduced macrophage number in the gut lamina propria of Cx3cr1/ mice is associated with increased translocation of commensal bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes. on the other hand, in the setting of dysbiosis where the commensal microbiome is damaged, for example. 3CR1/CX3CL1 axis is key regulator of neuron-microglial cell communication. it may have central proalgesic and peripheral antialgesic activities. role of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 in inflammatory lung disorders was recently reviewed. otide polymorphisms in the open reading frame of CX3CR1 changed a single amino acid, V249I and T280M, in transmembrane domains 6 and 7. they define common V249T280 and rare I249M280 haplotypes. chemokines have a genetic role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) all these studies implicate CX3CR1 in human pathologies and more specifically in inflammatory conditions involving cells of the myeloid lineage. treatment with CX3CR1-blocking antibodies significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival (Robinson et al., 2000) but delayed skin wound healing (Ishida et al., 2008) no significant functional difference has been shown between XCL1 and XCL2. XCL1 is an exceptional chemokine because it has only two canonical cysteines instead of four. the second structure binds heparin with high affinity but fails to activate XCR1. XCL1 is now known to be produced by activated CD8+ T cells, dendritic epidermal invariant V3V1 T cells, intestinal intraepithelial T cells, and NK cells. Activated CD8+ T cells secrete XCL1 together with CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, suggesting some functional cooperation among these chemokines. it was therefore considered to be the first bona fide lymphocyte-specific chemokine. many researchers reported potent chemotactic activity of XCL1 on CD8+ T cells, NK cells, B cells, and neutrophils. as for XCR1, it was first reported to be strongly expressed in placenta but weakly in spleen and thymus. XCL1 and XCL2 were equipotent agonists in chemotaxis and calcium flux assays in XCR1-transfectants. the XCR1 gene has two exons. a new set of primers spanning a large intron of mouse Xcr1 showed strong expression of Xcr1 exclusively in CD8+ dendritic cells. other cell types examined, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, plasmacytoid DCs, etc., were all negative. human blood BDCA3+ DCs express XCR1. human blood BDCA3+ DCs express XCR1. Xcr1/ mice have decreased early CD8+ T-cell responses. dermal CD103+ DCs, which share with spleen CD8+ DCs a high efficiency for antigen cross-presentation, also express XCR1. Xcl1/ mice are defective in the medullary accumulation of thymic DCs and the thymic generation of naturally occurring regulatory cells. XCR1 expression in lymphocytes such as CD8+ T cells and NK cells has been shown to be negative. the XCL1-XCR1 axis may be most useful for the development of effective cancer immunotherapy after all. sa CC-chemokine receptor homolog named U51A is constitutively active in inositol phosphate turnover and also mediates chemotactic and calcium mobilization responses to various CC chemokines. XCL1 may promote virus dissemination within the host by enhancing migration of infected cells to sites of chemokine production and/or evasion of host immune recognition. genes are clustered on chromosome 2q35, along with a pseudogene for CXCR2P1 (IL8RBP) most inflammatory chemokine receptor genes are on chromosomes 2 and 3. the ELR motif partly determines receptor specificity. other modifications of the N\u2032-terminal region may increase receptor affinity. post-translational citrullination was reported to control the activities of CXCL5 and CXCL8. the viral chemokine vCXCL1 of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) binds to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 (Luttichau, 2010) but activates neutrophils, mostly through CXCR2 (Penfold et al., 1999). if the neutrophil migration-inducing activity of N-acetyl-proline-glycine-proline and its role in chronic lung inflammation are mediated directly by CX native Cxcr1 on mouse leukocytes has not been characterized yet. arrows demarcate major leukocyte traffic routes between major tissue and hematopoietic compartments. human and mouse chemokine gene repertoires are distinct. the strong interaction of CXCL8 with the N\u2032-terminal domain of CXCR1 may lead to dissociation of this receptor domain from the membrane with which it interacted. this step then induces a conformational change on the receptor. this step then induces a conformational change on the receptor, allowing subsequent activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. many downstream mediators are induced after CXCR1 and CXCR2 activation. key roles identified for PI3K. agonist-specific signaling has been described. agonists at high concentrations induce phosphorylation of CXCR1 and CXCR2. these processes are regulated by the C\u2032-terminal PDZ ligand binding motif of the receptor, by C\u2032-terminal phosphorylation, and by the LLKIL motif in the C\u2032 terminus. XCR2 internalization is required for receptor recycling and resensitization. others have claimed that receptor endocytosis terminates the migration of cells when they reach sites of inflammation. -Arrestin-2 has been reported to induce and strengthen integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion during CXCL2-CXCR2-driven extravasation in one study. the ELR+ CXC chemokine system has been implicated in diverse pathologies, including infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease, cancer, central nervous system pathologies, and pain regulation. gene targeting in mice has revealed that Cxcr2 negatively regulates expansion and development of B cells and myeloid progenitors and mediates neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses to both bacteria and parasites. in neuropathology, the CXCR2/CXCL8 axis has been implicated in diverse conditions. it has been found on astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. however, its exact role in disease is controversial. ELR+ CXC chemokines promote angiogenesis by upregulating proliferation, survival, and migration of endothelial cells. both CXCR1 and CXCR2 may be expressed by endothelial cells and mediate angiogenesis. most ELR-negative CXC chemokines are not angiogenic and some are angiostatic. psoriasis may not have been a good target, because neutrophils are not prominent in this disease and the receptor is not prominent on T cells, which drive the disease. anogens has indicated that 50% of patients achieved a greater than 60% improvement. up to 15% of patients achieved a greater than 90% improvement in disease scores after a 6-week treatment cycle.

TABLE 4. Summary of clinical development of drug candidates targeting chemokines unless otherwise noted. a class of derivatives of 2-arylphenylpropionic acids was extensively investigated. this compound blocks both CXCR1 and CXCR2 but is more potent at CXCR1 and inhibits chemotaxis with an IC50 of 1 nM for binding to CXCR2. two phase II clinical trials of reparixin in kidney and lung transplantation were negative. however, a small phase II randomized, open-label pilot study found reparixin improved outcome with a single infusion of allogeneic islets. phase 3 trials are under way in the european Union for allogeneic islet transplantation and in the united states for autologous islet transplantation. AZD-5069 recently completed a Phase II trial in patients with bronchiectasis. a second compound, AZD-8309, was tested in healthy volunteers. a second compound, AZD-8309, was tested in healthy volunteers. CXCL10 is more sensitive to innate stimuli that activate toll-like receptor-IRF3-dependent induction of type I interferon. it is also preferentially induced by hypoxia-reperfusion injury via nuclear factor B activation. structure-activity studies with CXCR3 ligands have identified unique regions in each protein that are important for binding to CXCR3 and to heparin. binding of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 to CXCR3 elicits increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels and activates PI3K and MAPK. CC-chemokines, particularly CCL11 (eotaxin-1) and CCL13 (MCP-4), compete with moderate affinity for the binding of CXCL10 to CXCR3. in CXCR3-transfected cells, CCL26 can block CXCL10-mediated receptor activation and may therefore be a natural CXCR3 antagonist, although this has not been demonstrated in vivo. T-bet, the master transcription factor of Th1 and CTL commitment, directly transactivates CXCR3. mouse models have verified that CXCR3 and its ligands regulate the migration of Th1 cells into sites of Th1-driven inflammation. Cxcr3/ mice are protected from cerebral malaria because of reduced CD8+ CTL sequestration in the brain. the system also participates in the acute response in the brain to Toxoplasma gondii. T-cell infiltration of mucosal tissues is also highly dependent on CXCR3. deficiency in CXCR3 also reduces autoimmune diabetes and infiltration of T cells into the kidney in systemic lupus erythematosus. more recent data have indicated an important role for CXCR3 in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. ligands are highly upregulated in the lymph node after infection and immunization. in vitro chemotactic activity of CXCL10 and CXCL11 was shown to be GAG binding-independent. the ability of these chemokines to induce CXCR3-dependent T-cell migration in vivo was shown to be dependent on their ability to bind GAGs. however, this conclusion is controversial. CXCR3-B has been described to mediate the angiostatic effect of its ligands, being the preferential CXCR3 receptor reported to be expressed on endothelial cells. overexpression of CXCR3-B in an endothelial cell line resulted in CXCL10 inhibiting proliferation, while overexpression of CXCR3-A in the same cell line resulted in CXCL10 augmenting proliferation. SCH 546738 from Merck binds to human CXCR3 with high affinity (kD = 0.4 nM) and displaces radiolabeled CXCL10 and CXCL11 from human CXCR3 with an IC50 ranging from 0.8 to 2.2 nM in a noncompetitive manner. SCH 546738 alone achieved dose-dependent prolongation of rat cardiac allograft survival. AMG487 inhibits CXCL11-mediated cell migration (IC50 = 15 nM) and calcium mobilization (IC50 = 5 nM) it exhibits >1000-fold selectivity over a panel of other chemokine receptors. the compound entered phase II clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis. CXCR4 and ACKR3 (CXCR7) are the most highly conserved chemokine receptors among vertebrates. they share the key homeostatic ligand CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and in some settings act cooperatively. they share the key homeostatic ligand CXCL12, and in some settings act cooperatively. most common are CXCL12 and CXCL12. the extended C terminus of the -isoform contains several basic amino acids. other nonchemokine ligands also bind CXCR4. HMGB1 is a highly conserved nuclear protein known to act as a damage-associated molecular pattern after release from dead cells. CXCR4-mediated signal transduction induced by its nonchemokine ligands triggers chemotaxis and conforms to the classic chemokine signal transduction pathway. the interaction with CVX15 mimics the binding of CXCL12. the region in question of CXCR4 shows some homology to the canonical sequence. the region in question of CXCR4 shows some homology to the canonical sequence. the hydrophobic side chains, which form the dimer interface in CXCR4, are poorly conserved in other chemokine receptors. it is unlikely that potential heterodimers, including CXCR4 would display a structure similar to the CXCR4 homodimer. the x-ray data of CXCR4 provide further support for the \u201ctwo-step\u201d binding model of CXCL12. the X-ray data unveil multiple potential receptor conformations and ligand interactions. this adds to the complexity of context-dependent CXCR4-mediated signal transduction. this could explain the differences noted in the structure of CXCR1 in jawed vertebrates. main activities associated with CXCR4 are cell migration (homing) and positioning (homeostasis), neovascularization, survival, and growth. the receptor couples to pertussis toxin sensitive Gi proteins, stimulates phospholipase C leading to calcium mobilization, triggers the MAPK cascade and the protein kinase B/PI3K pathway. hematopoietic precursors in the BM, mediates B-cell segregation in lymphoid organs and mediates neutrophil egress from BM and BM homing of senescent neutrophils. mice harboring a CXCL12-promoted gain of function for Cxcr4 exhibit defective bone marrow myelopoiesis and B-cell lymphopoiesis. the apparent paradox of patients with WHIM syndrome is to exhibit a profoundly altered immune function and yet a limited susceptibility to viral and bacterial pathogens. this may eventually be a consequence of altered immune responses and hijacking of the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis as a host susceptibility factor for the virus. hypoglobulinemia Infections Myelokathexis (Mendelian AD) CX3CR1 CX3CR1-M280 Cardiovascular disease Reduced risk (+/) Reduced foam cell accumulation in vessel wall Age-related macular degeneration Increased risk (+/) Microglial cell accumulation in the subretinal space ACKR1 FYB(ES) the 14-amino acid polypeptide 4F-benzoyl TN14003 (BKT140) is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for multiple myeloma after chemotherapy and BM transplantation. the fully human anti-CXCR4 (IgG4) from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ) (BMS-936564/MDX-1338) is currently being tested for treatment of multiple myeloma (phase 1) llama-derived chemokine-binding proteins (vCKBP) display diverse mechanisms of interfering with chemokine receptor signaling. the herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 proteins gG1 and gG2 bind CXCL12 and thereby enhancing chemokine-induced CXCR4 signaling. in 2009 the FDA approved plerixafor in combination with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for mobilization of stem cells for BM transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma and non\u2013Hodgkins\u2019 lymphoma receiving cytoreductive therapy. repeated administration of plerixafor is well tolerated and leads to decreased leukopenia (Dale et al., 2011; McDermot the antagonist is undergoing several phase II clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma and non\u2013Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. a primary compound (IT1a, NIBR1816) and several chemical derivatives, the most potent being IT1t, have potent anti-HIV activity, compete with CXCL12 binding in the nanomolar range, and mobilize hematopoietic stem cells. a peptide, BKT140, is reported to block CXCR4 and is in phase I clinical trials. the second is NOX-A12, which is a mirror image RNA of the chemokine CXCL12. it is also present on a small subset of peripheral blood memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CXCR5 is dynamically regulated on memory/effector T cells. after TCR stimulation, CXCR5 is upregulated on memory/effector T cells. in phylogenetic analysis, CXCR6 is most closely related not to other CXC receptors but is closest either to CCR6 (Lio and Vannucci, 2003) or CCR9 (Nomiyama et al., 2011), depending on the analysis. phylogenetic analysis shows that CXCR6 is an unusual chemokine. CXCL16 was discovered independently of its chemokine activity as a scavenger receptor. it was originally designated as SR-PSOX (scavenger receptor for phosphatidyl serine and oxidized low-density lipoprotein) it is expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, and possibly B cells. a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3\u2032-nontranslated region of CXCR6 has been associated with long-term nonprogression to AIDS in several cohorts. a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3\u2032-nontranslated region of CXCR6 has been associated with long-term nonprogression to AIDS. CXCR6 is significantly enriched on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells found in inflamed tissue. CXCR6 is expressed on mouse (Johnston et al., 2003) and human (Kim et al., 2002) NKT cells. CXCR6 is important for the maintenance of \u201cmemory\u201d NK cells in the liver. promoting effects of CXCR6/CXCL16 have been postulated. both the proinflammatory activity of CXCR6/CXCL16 and the activity of CXCL16 as a scavenger receptor have led to interest in roles for CXCL16/CXCR6 in atherosclerosis. chemokines and chemokine receptors each have common ancestors. most inflammatory chemokine receptor genes are on chromosomes 2 and 3. the ELR motif partly determines receptor specificity (Clark-Lewis et al., 1993), and other modifications of the N\u2032-terminal region may increase receptor affinity (Li and Gordon, 2001). both monomers and dimers of CXCL8 induce neutrophil migration in vivo. the viral chemokine vCXCL1 of human cytomegalovirus binds to both CXCR1 and CXCR2. but activates neutrophils, mainly through CXCR2. if the neutrophil migration-inducing activity of N-acetyl-proline-glycine-proline is mediated directly by CXCR1 or indirectly is currently unsettled. okines are KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 or MIP-2 (now named Cxcl1 and Cxcl2) which bind to mouse Cxcr2. native Cxcr1 on mouse leukocytes has not been characterized yet. a strong interaction of CXCL8 with the N\u2032-terminal domain of CXCR1 may lead to dissociation of this receptor domain from the membrane with which it interacted, followed by transition of the chemokine to a second binding site composed of extracellular loops and transmembrane residues. this step then induces a conformational change on the receptor, allowing subsequent activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. many downstream mediators are induced after CXCR1 and CXCR2 activation. many downstream mediators are induced after CXCR1 and CXCR2 activation. agonist-specific signaling has been described. CXCR1 and CXCR2 cross-regulate each other\u2019s downregulation in a process mediated by positive and negative elements in their C\u2032-terminal domains. CXCR1 and CXCR2 undergo and induce cross or heterologous desensitization, sometimes differentially, with other GPCRs and their ligands. the precise physiologic relevance of desensitization and receptor internalization is unclear. some studies have suggested that CXCR2 internalization is required for receptor recycling and resensitization. others have claimed that receptor endocytosis terminates the migration of cells when they reach sites of inflammation. gene targeting in mice has revealed that Cxcr2 negatively regulates expansion and development of B cells and myeloid progenitors. both CXCR1 and CXCR2 are reduced on neutrophils from patients with hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome, who are susceptible to bacterial infections. in neuropathology, the CXCR2/CXCL8 axis has been implicated in diverse conditions. it has been found on astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the setting of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) ELR+ CXC chemokines promote angiogenesis by upregulating proliferation, survival, and migration of endothelial cells. both CXCR1 and CXCR2 may be expressed by endothelial cells and mediate angiogenesis. most ELR-negative CXC chemokines are not angiogenic and some are angiostatic. psoriasis may not have been a good target, because neutrophils are not prominent in this disease and the receptor is not prominent on T cells, which drive the disease. anogens has indicated that 50% of patients achieved a greater than 60% improvement. up to 15% of patients achieved a greater than 90% improvement in disease scores after a 6-week treatment cycle.

TABLE 4. Summary of clinical development of drug candidates targeting chemokines unless otherwise noted. a class of derivatives of 2-arylphenylpropionic acids was extensively investigated. this compound blocks both CXCR1 and CXCR2 but is more potent at CXCR1 and inhibits CXCL8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis with an IC50 of 1 nM for binding to CXCR2. two phase II clinical trials of reparixin in kidney and lung transplantation were negative. however, a small phase II randomized, open-label pilot study found reparixin improved outcome with a single infusion of allogeneic islets. phase 3 trials are under way in the european Union for allogeneic islet transplantation and in the united states for autologous islet transplantation. antagonist AZD-5069 recently completed a Phase II trial in healthy volunteers in the united kingdom. a second compound, AZD-8309, was tested in healthy volunteers in an LPS airway challenge. psoriasis may not have been a good target, because neutrophils are not prominent in this disease and the receptor is not prominent on T cells. 50% of patients achieved a greater than 60% improvement. up to 15% achieved a greater than 90% improvement in disease scores after a 6-week treatment cycle. reported CCR2 BMS BMS-741672 Diabetic neuropathy II Ongoing CCR2 Johnson & Johnson JNJ-17166864 20.0 Allergic rhinitis II No efficacy CCR3 Pharmaxis ASM8b Asthma II Ongoing CCR3 GlaxoSmithKline GSK766994 10.0 Asthma and allergic rhinitis II No efficacy CCR3 Dupont DPC168 2.0 Asthma I Development HGS004a AIDS I Ongoing CCR9 ChemoCentryx/GSK CCX282/vercirnon 6.0 IBD, Crohn\u2019s III Terminated CXCR1/ CXCR2 Schering-Plough SCH 527123 3.9 COPD II Ongoing 0.049 CXCR1/ CXCR2 Domp\u00e9 Reparixin 1.0 (CXCR1) Pancreatic islet transplantation III Ongoing 100 (CXCR2) CXCR the first to be described in the literature was the CXCR2-selective phenol-containing diaryl urea named SB 225002 (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) this compound entered clinical trials in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. two distinct allosteric sites have been proposed for CC and CXC chemokine receptors. several preclinical allosteric antagonists or inverse agonists have been demonstrated to act through an intracellular allosteric site on CXCR2 close to the G protein-coupling region. phase 3 trials are under way in the european Union for allogeneic islet transplantation and in the united states for autologous islet transplantation. a recent report suggests that it may have some utility in certain forms of breast cancer. the compound significantly lowered sputum neutrophil counts compared with prednisolone. im results were summarized in the 21st Annual Congress of the European Respiratory Society. AZD-8309 was tested in healthy volunteers in an LPS airway challenge. PA401, an inhibitor of the GAG-mediated step involved in CXCL8-induced CXCR1/CXCR2 activation, is a CXCL8 variant discovered by ProtAffin (Graz, Austria) reperfusion injury via nuclear factor B activation has been shown to play an early role in the hypoxia-induced inflammation associated with solid organ transplantation. in contrast, CXCL9 is more dependent on and more strongly induced by IFN. binding of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 to CXCR3 elicits increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels and activates PI3K and MAPK. cellular responses include integrin activation, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal changes, and directed cell migration. transfected cells can block CXCL10-mediated receptor activation. the physiologic significance of this interaction is not known. human CCL21 does not interact with human CXCR3. mouse models have verified that CXCR3 and its ligands regulate the migration of Th1 cells into sites of Th1-driven inflammation. CXCR3 is also highly expressed on innate lymphocytes, such as NK cells and NKT cells (NKT), where it may mediate early recruitment to sites of infection and inflammation. this is true during herpes simplex virus-2 infection of the vaginal mucosa. in the adoptive transfer model of colitis, Cxcl10 and Cxcr3 are highly expressed at sites of colitis because of local production of the ligands. CXCR3 ligands are highly upregulated in the lymph node after infection and immunization. similar results have been seen in the spleen where Cxcr3 plays an important role in bringing CD8+ T cells into contact with antigen and inflammatory cytokines. the ability of CXCR3 ligands to influence the behavior of certain nonimmune cells has been shown to be a function of the ability of these chemokines to bind to cell surface GAGs. the identification of an alternative splice variant of CXCR3-B was suggested as a possible explanation for CXCL10\u2019s angiostatic effects. overexpression of CXCR3-B in an endothelial cell line resulted in CXCL10 inhibiting proliferation. overexpression of CXCR3-A in the same cell line resulted in CXCL10 augmenting proliferation. the alternative splice variant does not exist in mice. SCH 546738 from Merck binds to human CXCR3 with high affinity (kD = 0.4 nM) and displaces radiolabeled CXCL10 and CXCL11 from human CXCR3 with an IC50 ranging from 0.8 to 2.2 nM in a noncompetitive manner. SCH 546738 potently and specifically inhibits CXCR3-mediated chemotaxis of human activated T cells. the compound entered phase II clinical trials for the treatment of psoriasis but failed to demonstrate any signs of efficacy. it showed efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis but not in ulcerative colitis. SCH 546738 potently and specifically inhibits CXCR3-mediated chemotaxis of human activated T cells, with an IC90 of 10 nM. SCH 546738 attenuated disease development in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model and reduced disease severity in rat and mouse EAE models. clinical candidate active at CXCR3 failed to demonstrate any signs of efficacy, and the trial was terminated. the trial demonstrated efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis but not in ulcerative colitis. ine ligand and receptor proteins in mouse and human are listed below. marketed drugs acting at the three indicated receptors are listed above and below. CXCR4 is the only known chemokine receptor for CXCL12. HIV-1 Env and its subunit gp120 can elicit a complex cellular response that mimics the effects of a chemokine. but whether Env-mediated signaling affects HIV infection and pathogenesis remains unknown. inflammatory cytokines and danger molecules released from damaged cells or tissues can bind and activate CXCR4. the core of CXCR4 is highly conserved (less than 0.6 root mean square deviation) but shows slight differences when in complex with the larger molecule CVX15. the extracellular end of helix VII reaches two turns longer into the extracellular space than in other GPCRs. a distinct contact site comprising helix V and VI is found in five different crystal packings. the strongest interaction of two receptor protomers is mediated by hydrophobic side chains of amino acids located in helix V with some participation of Lys267 from helix VI. fully sulfated CXCR4 p38 tends to promote CXCL12 dimerization. the dimeric chemokine is only a partial agonist at CXCR4, not inducing chemotaxis but maintaining the ability to mobilize calcium. the crystal structure of CXCR4 can accommodate several receptor-chemokine combinations. topoietic cells, vascular endothelial cells, in neurons of central and peripheral nervous system, microglia, and astrocytes. it is functionally expressed by many cancer cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. chemokine receptors, such as CCR7, may play a more decisive role there. CXCR4 signaling is context-dependent, e.g., in B-cell subsets the receptor does not trigger calcium mobilization or chemotaxis. the concentration and aggregation state of CXCL12 also contributes to the signaling quality. chemokine receptors might even form functional heterodimers. WHIM is an acronym for warts caused by human papillomavirus infection, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (abnormal retention of senescent neutrophils in the BM), which is associated with panleukopenia. the mechanism involves enhanced G protein coupling as well as arrestin-dependent signaling and loss of phosphorylation sites on the C terminus important for receptor desensitization and internalization important chemokine system mutations strongly associated with human disease Molecule Mutation Disease Phenotype Mechanism CCR5 CCR532 (loss of function) HIV/AIDS Resistance to initial infection (/) Loss of HIV coreceptor CCR5 prevents cell entry by R5-tropic HIV-1 Delayed disease progression (+/) West Nile virus infection Increased risk of symptomatic infection (/) Reduced leukocyte trafficking to brain Rheumatoid arthritis Reduced risk the class of peptide-based inhibitors consists of antibodies, chemokine analogs, derivatives of the horseshoe crab protein polyphemusin, and endogenous defensins. from the latter group several can block HIV replication, but only human defensin-3 efficiently competes for CXCL12 binding at CXCR4. the fully human anti-CXCR4 (IgG4) is currently being tested for treatment of multiple myeloma (phase 1) after proof-of-principle studies indicating that detachment from bone marrow stromal cells may sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. a phase I clinical trial was completed in healthy volunteers. vMIP-II (vCCL2) is a strong antagonist of CXCR4, preventing binding of CXCL12 and activation of the receptor. vMIP-II also inhibits CXCR4-mediated cell entry of HIV. the non-cyclam AMD11070 (ritonavir) is the first orally bioavailable small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor introduced to the clinic. early results indicate that it is well tolerated. another unrelated chemical structure, the chalcones, also inhibit CXCL12 binding and activation of CXCR4 but by neutralizing CXCL12. POL6326 has successfully completed phase I clinical trials in the united kingdom with 74 healthy volunteers. the drug was safe and well tolerated and is currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial for safety and efficacy in transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells in patients with multiple myeloma. XCR4 inhibitors consists of antibodies, chemokine analogs, derivatives of the horseshoe crab protein polyphemusin, and endogenous defensins. human defensin-3 downregulates CXCR4 without activating canonical Gi-coupled signal transduction. the fully human anti-CXCR4 (IgG4) from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS; Princeton, NJ) (BMS) and Medarex (Princeton, NJ) is currently being tested for treatment of multiple myeloma (phase 1) after proof-of-principle studies indicating that detachment from bone marrow stromal cells may sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. vMIP-II (vCCL2) is a strong antagonist of CXCR4. it prevents binding of CXCL12 and activation of the receptor. vMIP-II also inhibits CXCR4-mediated cell entry of HIV. early results indicate that it is well tolerated. another unrelated chemical structure, the chalcones, also inhibit CXCL12 binding and activation of CXCR4 but by neutralizing CXCL12. OL3026 are polyphemusin II-derived sequences incorporated into a macrocyclic template-bound -hairpin mimetic. the peptide is derived from their proprietary technology, known as Protein Epitope Mimetics. the drug was safe and well tolerated and is currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial. CXCR5 has been detected on all peripheral blood and tonsillar B cells. it is also present on a fraction of cord blood and bone marrow B cells. in secondary lymphatic tissue, the majority of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are positive. no CXCR5 antagonists have been developed yet. targeting this receptor in autoimmunity is an attractive direction for the future. human CXCR6 is located on chromosome 3 (Liao et al., 1997b; Loetscher et al., 1997). phylogenetic analysis shows that CXCL16 is not closely related to other CXC chemokines. phylogenetic analysis shows that CXCL16 is not closely related to other CXC chemokines. CXCL16 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, and possibly B cells (Matloubian et al., 2000; Shimaoka et al., 2000; Wilbanks et al., 2001); on fibroblastic reticular cells, activated T cells, endothelial cells (Abel et al., 2004; Liao et al., 1997b a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3\u2032-nontranslated region of CXCR6 has been associated with long-term nonprogression to AIDS in several cohorts. if these associations are related to CXCR6 activity as an HIV coreceptor or, perhaps more likely, its activity in the host immune system remains unresolved. gene-free mice showed increased numbers of NKT cells at these sites. expression of CXCR6 and/or CXCL16 is increased in prostate cancer. expression of CXCR6 is associated with increased inflammation and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. there are no published data on the development of CXCR6 antagonists or neutralizing reagents for clinical use. CXCR7 (now ACKR3, see Section III.A.3) B. CC Chemokine Receptors 1. CCR1 is broadly expressed on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. CCR1 activates the classic chemokine signaling pathway through the Gi/o class of G proteins. it causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, calcium flux, and PLA2. but not all CCR1 ligands appear to mediate the same functions. CCR1 is rapidly upregulated and functional in human neutrophils treated with GM-CSF. in this state, the receptor may scavenge inflammatory chemokines and suppress inflammation. in this state, the receptor may scavenge inflammatory chemokines. cr1/ mice are more susceptible to chronic demyelination after challenge with mouse hepatitis virus and to Aspergillus fumigatus and T. gondii. the precise cellular mechanisms of action are undefined. both Ccr1 and Ccl3 appear to be important for protection against infection with pneumonia virus of mice. Ccl3 neutralization is completely protective in a relapsing-remitting EAE model of multiple sclerosis in mice. the fact that Ccl3 neutralization is more effective than Ccr1 inactivation suggests that other Ccl3 receptors such as Ccr5 may play a role in pathogenesis. CCX354 inhibited CCL3-induced immune cell recruitment in a guinea pig skin sensitization model and impaired osteoclastogenesis by multiple myeloma cells. the drug was discontinued after it failed to reach its clinical endpoint in a phase II trial for rheumatoid arthritis. AZD4818 (AstraZeneca) is a spirocyclic piperidine derivative (Kerstjens et al., 2010) that was effective preclinically. it was entered into clinical trials for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by inhalation at a dose of 300 g twice daily for 4 weeks. mouse Ccr2 has 80% amino acid identity to CCR2b. in mouse, Ccr2 is expressed by the inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocyte subset. low levels of CCR2 agonists secreted under normal conditions maintain homeostatic migration. CCR2 has been reported to be downregulated, through a redox-sensitive mechanism stimulating rapid mRNA deadenylation and degradation (Xu et al., 1997; Saccani et al., 2000) different CCR2 agonists can trigger different signaling cascades (biased agonism), suggesting that. CCR2 homodimerization occurs in the absence of the ligand, but CCL2 dimers have been shown to favor CCR2 homodimerization. the ability of CCR2 to dimerize may significantly affect drug selectivity, because the specific antagonist of one receptor may lead to functional cross-inhibition of the other. protection is associated with a reduced number of macrophages infiltrating the arterial wall. an additive effect with Ccr5 and Cx3cr1 has been demonstrated. the role of Ccr2 in atherogenesis and infectious disease models may involve not only trafficking of monocytes from blood to tissue but also from bone marrow to blood. evidence from neutralizing studies and gene-targeted animals also indicate a nonredundant role of Ccr2 in the recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates into the central nervous system. in humans, CCL2 haplotypes show a correlation with predisposition to multiple sclerosis. the relationship of CCR2 to Alzheimer\u2019s disease is unclear. analysis of the Ccl2/Ccr2 axis in type 2 polarized immune responses has given conflicting results. Ccl2 was shown to favor Th2 polarization (Gu et al., 2000), and Ccl2-deficient animals have been reported to have reduced airway hyperreactivity. preferential development of Th2 immune responses was observed in Ccr2-deficient animals. skewing from a type 1 protective immune response to a susceptible state characterized by a type 2 polarized immune response has been reported. CCR2 also may play a role in AIDS pathogenesis, because CCR2 has HIV-1 coreceptor activity (Doranz et al., 1996). inflammatory monocytes belong to a heterogeneous Gr1+ population of so-called myeloid-derived suppressor cells. CCR2 may also be involved in chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue. it has also been implicated in age-related macular degeneration in humans. the role of CCR2/CCL2 in bone mass balance has recently been supported in humans by association of CCL2 GG and CCR2-64I allelic variants with osteoporosis risk (Eraltan et al., 2012). the role of CCR2 in bone mass balance has recently been supported in humans by association of CCL2 GG and CCR2-64I allelic variants. the development of CCX915 (structure not disclosed) was terminated because of poor pharmacokinetic properties in phase I clinical trials. the current clinical candidate, CCX140 (structure not disclosed), is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of type II diabetes. no clinical data from this trial have been revealed. Millennium developed a CCR2 neutralizing antibody named MLN1202 as a therapeutic to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. this approach has had mixed success with positive results in phase II trials for atherosclerosis. CCR3 was originally identified as the eosinophil receptor for eotaxin-1 (CCL11) it is now known to be highly promiscuous, binding the inflammatory chemokines CCL3L1 (LD78), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL11, CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL15 (HCC-2), CCL26 (eotaxin-3), and CCL28 ( CXCR3 agonists may promote Th1 responses by recruiting CXCR3-expressing Th1 cells. in vivo, intravenous administration of Cxcl9 before an allergen challenge resulted in strong inhibition of eosinophil recruitment to the mouse lung. CCR3-signaling pathways primarily induce cellular chemotaxis and intracellular calcium flux. CCR3 expression on airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells is upregulated by inflammatory signaling molecules such as TNF-. a recent study found that CCR3 expression is tightly regulated by the transcription factor GATA-1 (Kim et al., 2010) the role of Ccr3 and its ligands in asthma has been difficult to define. r3-deficient mice sensitized intraperitoneally exhibited increased airway hyperresponsiveness associated with mast cell hyperplasia. both Ccr3 and Ccl11 but not Ccl24 were involved in basal trafficking of eosinophils to gut mucosa, but not to lung. sources of eotaxins in the asthmatic lung are airway structural cells (epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells) CCL11 and CCL24 were only modestly induced in EE. Ccr3/ mice were nearly completely protected from developing EE. CCR3 plays a critical role in age-related macular degeneration. pharmaceutical companies are conducting research to find novel small-molecule antagonists. however, none of them has been approved for clinical use. GW766944 failed to show efficacy in phase III for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. AZD3778 is a novel low molecular weight dual CCR3 and histamine H1 receptor antagonist developed by AstraZeneca. it has an IC50 of 8.1 nM for the inhibition of eotaxin binding to CCR3 and an IC50 of 40 nM for the inhibition of binding to the H1 histamine receptor. no further development of the compound has been reported. two novel CC chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 (MDC) were found to be the specific ligands for CCR4 (Imai et al., 1997a, 1998) in peripheral blood, CCR4 is expressed by platelets and mediates platelet activation in presence of low levels of primary agonists such as ADP or thrombin. the local tissue site of helper T-cell differentiation is important for the differential expression of homing molecules. gut-homing molecules (CCR9, 47 integrin) are induced in gut-associated lymph nodes. skin-homing molecules (CCR4, CCR10) are universally induced in all lymph nodes. the results obtained from Ccr4/ mice were not always consistent with the expected importance of CCR4 in Th2 responses. this may be in part due to less selective expression of CCR4 on Th2 cells in mice. the dominance of CCL22 over CCL17 in CCR4 desensitization and internalization coupled with their differential expression in inflamed skin. tolerance induction in an allogeneic cardiac transplantation model with anti-CD154 plus donor-specific transfusion was shown to be accompanied by dramatic intragraft upregulation of Foxp3 levels. a number of small-molecule CCR4 antagonists have been developed and evaluated in animal models of allergic diseases, some giving highly promising results. KW-0761, a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR4 with defucosylation to enhance ADCC activity, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in japan. a number of companies have described CCR4 antagonists. all of these molecules are still preclinical. a clinical development compound (GSK2239633) has entered phase I clinical trials, presumably for allergy and asthma. binds many ligands, including CCL2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, and 16. most behave as potent agonists (Gong et al., 1998; Blanpain et al., 1999); however, CCL7 is a natural antagonist. additional residues in the amino terminal segment as well as post-translational modifications there are important binding determinants. vMIP-II from human herpesvirus 8 is a potent and efficient CCR5 antagonist. more recently, mycobacterial heat shock protein 70 recapitulates most, if not all, of conventional CCR5 agonist activity. engagement of naive CD4+ T cells with antigen presenting cells (APCs) triggers secretion of CCL3 and CCL4. CCR5-dependent recruitment of polyclonal CD8+ T cells to mature DCs engaging antigen-specific CD8+ T cells has been reported to favor naive CD8+ T-cell priming. CCR5 is a major chemotactic mediator for murine endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), suggesting that it may regulate neovascularization and wound healing. 1% of North American Caucasians is homozygous for this null allele yet appears healthy. the patient was transplanted with hematopoietic stem cells from an HLA-matched donor homozygous for CCR532. the patient has had no PCR-detectable virus in blood or tissue since then off antiretroviral therapy. this suggests that viral reservoirs may have been eliminated. Ccr5/ mice appear healthy and develop normally in a pathogen-free environment. they showed altered T-cell activity, impaired macrophage function, and fewer infiltrating leukocytes at infected sites. at the microbiological level, they showed reduced efficiency in clearance of L. monocytogenes infection. mice were protected from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. this protection was associated with reduction of macrophages infiltrating the adipose tissue. chemokine analogs with antagonist activity, such as methionyl-RANTES. maraviroc was FDA approved in HIV/AIDS for treatment-experienced individuals with HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple antiretroviral drugs. more recently, it was approved as a first-line drug in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. clinical candidate TAK-652 (cencriviroc) is a potent (IC50 of 3.0 nM for CCL3), metabolically stable, and orally bioavailable CCR5 antagonist. the compound was active against HIV-1 clinical isolates with an EC50 of 61 pM (Baba et al., 2005) AZD567 had excellent CCR5 potency (binding Ki = 0.17 nM) and no cardiovascular problems. it had no efficacy in a phase IIb study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. human CCR6 is found at 6q27 (Liao et al., 1997c), outside the clusters of chemokine receptor genes. phylogenetic analysis of human chemokine receptors puts CCR6 in a cluster with CXCR6, CCR7, and CCR9. the biology of CCR6 has been best studied for B cells, dendritic cells, and T cells. in mice, CCR6 on B cells has been found to be important for gut-associated lymphoid tissue. recent work in sheep has suggested that CCR6 may also be important for trafficking of B cells to the skin. a et al., 2001; Le Borgne et al., 2006), data suggest a role for Ccr6 in recruitment of dendritic cells to inflammatory tissue sites. the relationship between CCR6 and IL-17 secretion is analogous to that between CXCR3 and IFN secretion. the cytokine-producing cells are subsets of the chemokine receptor expressing cells. most receptor+ cells are still not able to produce the relevant cytokine. other studies have shown that Ccr6 is protective in some autoimmune models. major homeostatic chemokine receptor critical for lymph node development. its only two ligands, CCL19 (previously called ELC) and CCL21 (SLC), are produced constitutively in microenvironments of lymphoid tissue. neither ligand is expressed in B-cell areas or sinuses of lymph nodes or by blood-derived leukocytes. Immature DCs in peripheral tissues express inflammatory chemokine receptors, but not CCR7. the cells undergo a receptor switch downregulating inflammatory chemokine receptors and upregulating CCR7. both chemokines are displayed on the luminal and abluminal sides of the high endothelial venules. Ccr7/ mice and the plt/plt (paucity of lymph node T cells) mouse are naturally deficient in Ccl19 and the Ccl21 isoforms expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. this plus the failure of mature DCs to migrate to lymph node from the skin of Ccr7/and plt/plt mice. B-T interaction may be facilitated by reciprocal movement of these cells. other regulators of B-T contact include oxysterols and their GPCR, EBI2. chemokines such as CCL21 are bound to the surface of lymph node DCs in vivo. both genes are encoded on a single exon. human CCR8 is located on chromosome 3, while mouse Ccr8 is on chromosome 9. both genes are encoded on a single exon. human CCL7 (MCP-3), an MCP family chemokine, but not mouse Ccl7, was noted to bind human CCR8 with intermediate affinity and with higher affinity than mouse Ccl1. human CCL7 (MCP-3), an MCP family chemokine, was noted to bind human CCR8 with intermediate affinity and with lower affinity than mouse Ccl1. human skin-resident memory CD4, CD8, and T cells express CCR8. a subset of mouse monocyte-derived dendritic cells are reported to express CCR8. CCR8 is abundantly expressed on activated highly polarized in vitro differentiated Th2 cells. the CCR8 gene was in a rare category of genes containing both STAT4-repressive and STAT6-activating binding sites. STAT4 binding in the upstream region of the CCR8 gene was inhibitory and associated with strongly repressive epigenetic marks. both ex vivo human studies and in vivo mouse studies support an important role for CCR8-mediated leukocyte trafficking to skin. MC148 (vMCC-I) from Molluscum contagiosum is specific for human but not mouse CCR8. HHV8-encoded vMIP-II is a broad-spectrum antagonist at CCR8. mouse studies support a role for the Ccr8 pathway in promoting chronic allergic inflammation. the relative importance of CCR8-regulated responses in different models of allergic airway inflammation may be dependent on the kinetics of in vivo antigen-specific memory T-cell generation. studies also support a role for the CCR8 pathway in preventing apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis. CCR8 and CCL1 are also induced under conditions associated with vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. it has also been reported that CCR8 can function as an HIV-1 coreceptor, although its activity in primary cells and in pathogenesis remains undefined. a recent genome-wide association multivariate survival analysis study identified significant associations for CCR3, CCR8 and CCRL2 polymorphisms. the lead antagonist, AZ084, appears to act as an allosteric inhibitor with a Ki at 0.9 nM (Connolly et al., 2012). no clinical trials have been reported. ymocytes start to rearrange the chain of the T-cell receptor. if they fail to rearrange in frame the chain in one chromosome they can try to rearrange the other. if they fail to rearrange in frame the chain in one chromosome they can try to rearrange the other. DN3 cells \u201cpass\u201d -selection and express CCR9. they can successfully migrate to another thymus region under the influence of CCL25. they can become DN4 cells, start rearranging the TCR chain, and eventually become CD4+CD8+ thymocytes that will undergo positive and negative selection. certain T cells that home to the intestine express CCR9 and respond to CCL25. these cells also express the 47 integrin so they are known as CCR9+47+ T cells. a subset of dendritic cells that may represent precursors to mature dendritic cells also expresses CCR9. melanoma expresses a metastasize to lymph node, lung, liver, and other organs but not small intestine. the association between CCR9 expression and small intestine metastasis in melanoma is very significant clinically. a single daily dose of 250 mg of the compound was well tolerated. CCX282 is the receptor for two homeostatic chemokines. it mediates diverse processes, from homeostatic leukocyte trafficking to skin cancer. cc10+ T cells also express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) the interaction between CCL25 and CCR9 is responsible for the recruitment of 47 cells to the gut. under normal conditions, melanocytes robustly express CCR10, and melanoma cells continue to express high levels of CCR10. CCL28 is predominantly expressed in the salivary gland, mammary gland, female reproductive tissues, and gut. CCL28-CCR10 axis may be involved in transfer of humoral immunity during breast-feeding. chemokine/receptor axis may be responsible for IgA responses within the gut. no chemokine/receptor axis have been reported yet. the full-length forms of CCL6, CCL9, CCL15, and CCL23 bind with low affinity. proteolytic modification at the N terminus during inflammatory responses in vivo may increase affinity. activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes secrete an N-terminally truncated form named CCL4 3-69. the CCR1 ligands CCL3, CCL7, CCL5 and CCL15 inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in cells transfected with CCR1. however, only CCL15 was unable to signal via G14- or G16-coupled pathways. CCR1 is expressed on monocytes, memory T cells, basophils, and dendritic cells. endothelial cells and macrophages stimulated with TNF- or IFN-. mechanism may involve inhibition of geranylgeranylation. isrogens may reduce relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis. r1/ mice are protected from pulmonary inflammation secondary to acute pancreatitis. Ccr1 also appears to be involved in remodeling after myocardial ischemia. role for Ccr1 in pulmonary injury and fibrosis was recently discovered. kotriene B4 receptor BLT1 was efficacious in preclinical models of multiple sclerosis, heart transplantation, renal fibrosis, and multiple myeloma. MLN3897 (Millennium, Cambridge, MA) inhibited CCL3-induced immune cell recruitment in a guinea pig skin sensitization model. but was discontinued after it failed to reach its clinical endpoint in a phase II trial for rheumato CCX354 is an azaindazole that blocks chemotaxis of THP-1 cells induced by synovial fluid from patients with RA. CCX354 was active in two animal models and phase II clinical trial data showed that it reached its clinical endpoints. no efficacy data are available from phase II clinical trials. MLN3897 (Millennium, Cambridge, MA) inhibited CCL3-induced immune cell recruitment in a guinea pig skin sensitization model. but was discontinued after it failed to reach its clinical endpoint in a phase II trial for rheumatoid arthritis. the drug may have failed because of incomplete receptor coverage. CCX354 was active in two animal models (Dairaghi et al., 2011) phase II clinical trial data showed that it reached its clinical endpoints. no efficacy data are available from phase II clinical trials. human CCR2 gives rise to two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding 360 (CCR2a) and 374 (CCR2b) amino acid polypeptides that diverge only in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region. the function of CCR2a, which is mostly found in intracellular compartments because of the presence of a retention signal located in its unique C-terminal domain, is currently unknown. CCR2 is induced by IL-2 in T cells and NK cells. during monocyte maturation to macrophages and dendritic cells. redox-sensitive mechanism stimulates rapid mRNA deadenylation and degradation. different CCR2 agonists can trigger different signaling cascades. different CCR2 agonists can trigger different signaling cascades. similar to other GPCRs, CCR2 may also form homodimers and heterodimers. a pathogenetic role for Ccr2 in atherosclerosis is clearly established. protection is associated with a reduced number of macrophages infiltrating the arterial wall. the role of Ccr2 in atherogenesis and infectious disease models may involve not only trafficking of monocytes from blood to tissue but also from bone marrow to blood. in humans, CCL2 haplotypes show a correlation with predisposition to multiple sclerosis (Ockinger et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2007). the relationship of CCR2 to Alzheimer\u2019s disease is controversial. animal models and genetic analysis of CCL2 and CCR2 haplotypes did not support a nonredundant role for CCR2 in other autoimmune diseases. a recent report showed that CCR2 blockade was effective in reducing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and leukocyte recruitment in a primate model of asthma. Ccr2 triggered by Ccl2 and Ccl7 produced by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in response to TLR stimulation is required to mobilize Ccr2+/Ly6Chigh monocytes from the bone marrow and recruit them to infection sites. skewing from a type 1 protective immune response to a susceptible state characterized by a type 2 polarized immune response has been reported. tumor-associated macrophages have been shown to be activated by the tumor microenvironment to an alternatively activated M2 phenotype. inflammatory monocytes belong to a heterogeneous Gr1+ population of so-called myeloid-derived suppressor cells. CCR2 may also be involved in chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue, suggesting a role in obesity and related metabolic diseases. a decrease in number, size, and function of osteoclasts with consequent higher bone mass is evident in Ccr2-deficient mice. the role of CCR2/CCL2 in bone mass balance has recently been supported by association of CCL2 GG and CCR2-64I allelic variants with osteoporosis risk. clinical candidate CCX140 (structure not disclosed) was terminated because of poor pharmacokinetic properties in phase I clinical trials. clinical end point was reduction of glycated hemoglobins (a marker of diabetes) the compound had a 100-fold reduced affinity for rodent CCR2. it showed poor oral bioavailability, but dosing by nasal spray allowed it to enter human clinical trials for allergic rhinitis. no clinical data from this trial have been revealed. NOX-E36 is a mirror image RNA of the RNA for the chemokine CCL2. this molecule has been shown to block expression of the protein. the company is currently assessing this molecule in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. antagonist with an IC50 for inhibition of CCR2 and CCR5 binding of 3.0 and 5.3 nM, respectively, was initially selected as a clinical candidate based on its potency and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. further optimization resulted in PF-4254196, which had no cardiovascular liabilities. both clinical studies ended in 2009; however, no reports have been issued. the compound had a 100-fold reduced affinity for rodent CCR2. it demonstrated poor oral bioavailability, but dosing by nasal spray allowed it to enter human clinical trials for allergic rhinitis. noxxon (Berlin, Germany) is a mirror image RNA of the RNA for the chemokine CCL2. this molecule has been shown to block expression of the protein and prevent receptor engagement. it is now known to be highly promiscuous, binding the inflammatory chemokines. CCL3L1 and CCL13 exist in humans but not in mice. CCR3 is expressed on basophils, Th2 lymphocytes, and mast cells. agonists CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which promote Th1 immunity, are also natural antagonists of CCR3. both genes are located adjacent to each other within the major cluster of chemokine receptors on human chromosome 3. CCR3 expression on airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells is upregulated by inflammatory signaling molecules such as TNF- (Joubert et al., 2005) both Ccr3 and Ccl11 but not Ccl24 were involved in basal trafficking of eosinophils to gut mucosa, but not to lung. the sources of eotaxins in the asthmatic lung are airway structural cells (epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells) CCL26 is the most overexpressed gene in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), a disease characterized by antigen-driven eosinophil accumulation in the esophagus. CCL11 and CCL24 were only modestly induced in EE. no CNV inhibition was observed when Ccr3 was blocked in Matrigel CNV models developed in mouse and rat. the authors argued that this discrepancy was not because of the differences in the CNV models used. pharmaceutical companies are conducting research to find novel small-molecule antagonists. AZD3778 is a novel low molecular weight dual CCR3 and histamine H1 receptor antagonist developed by AstraZeneca. the compound exerted moderately antieosinophilic and symptom-reducing effects thought to be through inhibition of CCR3 rather than through its effects on the histamine receptor. GW766944 failed to show efficacy in phase III for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. a second trial, GW766944 failed to show efficacy in phase III for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. AZD3778 is a novel low molecular weight dual CCR3 and histamine H1 receptor antagonist developed by AstraZeneca. the compound has an IC50 of 8.1 nM for the inhibition of eotaxin binding to CCR3 and an IC50 of 40 nM for the inhibition of binding to the H1 histamine receptor. no further development of the compound has been reported. two novel CC chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 were found to be the specific ligands for CCR4 (Imai et al., 1996; Godiska et al., 1997) were found to be the specific ligands for CCR4. in peripheral blood, CCR4 is expressed by platelets and mediates platelet activation in the presence of low levels of primary agonists such as ADP or thrombin. gut-homing molecules (CCR9, 47 integrin) are induced in gut-associated lymph nodes. skin-homing molecules (CCR4, CCR10) are universally induced in all lymph nodes. importance of the CCR4 axis in allergic diseases has been amply demonstrated using mouse models. the crucial role of CCR4 in skin-homing T cells has been amply demonstrated. the dominance of CCL22 over CCL17 in CCR4 desensitization and internalization coupled with their differential expression. the importance of CCR4 in Tregs has been amply demonstrated in humans and mice. tolerance induction in an allogeneic cardiac transplantation model with anti-CD154 plus donor-specific transfusion was shown to be accompanied by dramatic intragraft upregulation of Foxp3 levels together with those of Ccr4 and Ccl22. KW-0761, a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR4 with defucosylation to enhance ADCC activity, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in japan. the humanized IgG1 anti-CCR4 with defucosylation to enhance ADCC activity, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in 2008. vant therapy is being developed by amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA) a number of companies have described CCR4 antagonists, and these were recently reviewed. all of these molecules are still preclinical, but GSK recently disclosed a series of indazole sulfonamides (Procopiou et al., 2012) ized IgG1 anti-CCR4 with defucosylation to enhance ADCC activity, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in japan. clinical trials have been conducted against ATL and other peripheral T-cell lymphomas with highly promising results. clinical trials in other peripheral T-cell malignancies are now ongoing. the antagonist maraviroc (Pfizer), the first marketed drug targeting a chemokine receptor, resulted in FDA approval of the antagonist. genetic approaches in mice and humans have indicated a key role for CCR5 in immunologically mediated disease. gp120 was the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of R5 strains of HIV. this followed the seminal discovery that CCL3, 4, and 5 were major HIV-suppressive factors. this followed the discovery of the T-tropic HIV coreceptor activity of CXCR4. in the CD4+ T-cell lineage, it is preferentially expressed on Th1, Th17, and Treg cells (Bonecchi et al., 1998; Wysocki et al., 2005; Yurchenko et al., 2006); and NK cells (Campbell et al., 2001) and facilitates organ infiltration. expression on monocytes and dendritic cell subtypes imply downregulation of tissue-specific chemokine receptors. CCR5 is also expressed on nonhematopoietic cells, including endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, epithelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. a sequence mutation is a deletion of 32 base pairs between nucleotides 554 to 585 that causes a frame shift after amino acid 184. the truncated protein has only four transmembrane domains and is not expressed on the cell surface. 1% of North American Caucasians is homozygous for this null allele. plotypes illustrate cumulative and interactive influences in AIDS progression. homozygous CCR532 was shown to be a strong risk factor for symptomatic west Nile virus infection. findings raise questions about safe use of CCR5-blocking agents in the context of HIV/West Nile virus coinfection. CCR5-CCL5 axis provides antiapoptotic signals for macrophage survival during infection. they are protected from mucosal ulcerations in a model of intestinal inflammation. they behave similarly to control mice in EAE. chemokine analogs with antagonist activity, such as methionyl-RANTES (Proudfoot et al., 1996); aminooxypentane-linked-RANTES (Johnson et al., 2004); and RNA interference (Martinez et al., 2002). to date, only one CCR5 blocking agent, the small molecule maraviroc (Pfizer), has succeeded as an approved drug. SCH-D (vicriviroc), a methoxymethyl analog, had improved receptor selectivity. GW873410 (aplaviroc) is a spiroketopiperazine (Maeda et al., 2004) and a potent CCR5 inhibitor (Kd of 3.0 nM) phase II trials were halted in 2005 because of liver toxicity. drug is highly selective and potent (IC50 of 16 nM in calcium flux assays) it also has highly potent anti-HIV-1 activity with an IC90 of 9.0 nM for all CCR5-tropic viruses, whereas it is inactive against X4-tropic HIV-1 strains. some patients treated with high doses of HGS004 showed a switch from CCR5- to CXCR4-tropism was of concern. the natural HIV-1 resistance conferred by CCR532 has spurred interest in specific zinc finger nuclease targeting of CCR5. maraviroc was FDA approved in HIV/AIDS for individuals with HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple antiretroviral drugs. more recently, it was approved for individuals with drug-sensitive HIV-1 strains as a first-line drug in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. chols et al., 2008), and GSK abandoned the program (Moyle, 2006). takeda has disclosed a number of CCR5 antagonists, including their clinical candidate TAK-652 (cencriviroc), which is a potent (IC50 of 3.0 nM for CCL3), metabolically stable, and orally bioavailable CCR5 antagonist. progenics is developing humanized monoclonal antibody to CCR5 (PRO 140) as a potent inhibitor of viral entry for the treatment of R5 HIV-1-infected individuals. a small phase IIa clinical trial showed the drug was safe and well tolerated by patients. phylogenetic analysis of human chemokine receptors puts CCR6 in a cluster with CXCR6, CCR7, and CCR9 (Lio and Vannucci, 2003). CCR6 is the only receptor identified thus far for the chemokine CCL20 (previously called MIP-3) the biology of CCR6 has been best studied for B cells, dendritic cells, and T cells. in mice, CCR6 on B cells has been found to be important for gut-associated lymphoid tissue. recent work in sheep has suggested that CCR6 may also be important for trafficking of B cells to the skin. the data suggest an important role for CCR6 in the recruitment of dendritic cells to inflammatory tissue sites. the relationship between CCR6 and IL-17 secretion is analogous to that between CXCR3 and IFN secretion and between CCR4 and IL-4 secretion. Ccr6 has been shown to contribute to pathogenesis of mouse models of autoimmune disease. other studies have shown that Ccr6 is protective in some autoimmune models. no publications have described CCR6 antagonists or neutralizing reagents for clinical use. major homeostatic chemokine receptor critical for lymph node development. its only two ligands, CCL19 (previously called ELC) and CCL21 (SLC), are produced constitutively in microenvironments of lymphoid tissue. neither ligand is expressed in B-cell areas or sinuses of lymph nodes or by blood-derived leukocytes. Immature DCs in peripheral tissues express inflammatory chemokine receptors, but not CCR7. the cells undergo a receptor switch downregulating inflammatory chemokine receptors and upregulating CCR7. both chemokines are displayed on the luminal and abluminal sides of the high endothelial venules. Ccr7/ mice and the plt/plt (paucity of lymph node T cells) mouse are naturally deficient in Ccl19 and the Ccl21 isoforms expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. this plus the failure of mature DCs to migrate to lymph node from the skin of Ccr7/and plt/plt mice. B-T interaction may be facilitated by reciprocal movement of these cells. other regulators of B-T contact include oxysterols and their GPCR, EBI2. T-cell zone chemokines such as CCL21 are bound to the surface of lymph node DCs in vivo. human and mouse CCR8 are 355 and 353 amino acid polypeptides, respectively, that share 71% amino acid identity. both genes are encoded on a single exon. both genes are encoded on a single exon. human CCL7 (MCP-3), an MCP family chemokine, but not mouse Ccl7, was noted to bind human CCR8 with intermediate affinity and with higher affinity than mouse Ccl1. human CCL7 is an antagonist for vMIP-1 but not for human CCL1 activity on human CCR8. human skin-resident memory CD4, CD8, and dendritic cells express CCR8. a subset of mouse monocyte-derived dendritic cells are reported to express CCR8. CCR8 is notable for its association with Th2 lymphocytes. chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis found that the CCR8 gene was in a rare category of genes containing both STAT4-repressive and STAT6-activating binding sites. both ex vivo human studies and in vivo mouse studies support an important role for CCR8-mediated leukocyte trafficking to skin in both the steady state and during inflammation. two skin-tropic viruses encode two high-affinity chemokine antagonists at CCR8. MC148 (vMCC-I) from Molluscum contagiosum is specific for human but not mouse CCR8. HHV8-encoded vMIP-II is a broad-spectrum antagonist at CCR8 and several other chemokine receptors. shorter acute models may not capture differentiation and reactivation of Ccr8+ highly differentiated Th2 cells. vMIP-1 and vMIP-II were reported to promote autocrine and paracrine cell survival. CCR8 and CCL1 are also induced under conditions associated with vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. it has also been reported that CCR8 can function as an HIV-1 coreceptor. however, a recent genome-wide association multivariate survival analysis study identified significant associations for CCR3, CCR8 and CCRL2 polymorphisms. e-based compounds from Millennium were among the first CCR8 antagonists to be presented. recently their probe-dependent allosteric interactions with CCR8 were described. no clinical trials have been reported. the lead antagonist, AZ084, appears to act as an allosteric inhibitor with a Ki at 0.9 nM (Connolly et al., 2012). no clinical trials have been reported. DN2 thymocytes have only 33% probability of rearranging this chain in frame. if they fail to rearrange in frame the chain in one chromosome they can try to rearrange the other. if they fail to rearrange in frame the chain in one chromosome they can try to rearrange the other. the importance of the CCL25/CCR9 axis in T-cell development is likely to extend beyond original thymus colonization and beta selection. the importance of the CCL25/CCR9 axis in T-cell development is likely to extend beyond original thymus colonization and beta selection. the intestine expresses CCR9 and responds to CCL25. a subset of dendritic cells also expresses CCR9. chemokine receptors have been implicated in the metastasis of certain melanomas. the association between CCR9 expression and small intestine metastasis in melanoma is very significant clinically. their clinical candidate, CCX282 has been reported to have IC50 values of 5.4 nM for inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization. the IC50 was 33 nM in the presence of 100% human serum. exclusive license to compound CCX282 launched four pivotal phase III clinical trials. CCX282 has been reported to have IC50 values of 5.4 nM for inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization and 3.4 nM for inhibition of chemotaxis of cells expressing CCR9. CCR10 is the receptor for two homeostatic chemokines: CCL27 (previously called CTACK) and CCL28 (previously called MEC) CCL27 and CCL28 are in different chromosomal locations, likely because of a recent translocation. CCR10 mediates diverse processes, from homeostatic leukocyte trafficking to skin cancer. the interaction between CCL25 and CCR9 is responsible for the recruitment of 47 cells to the gut. under normal conditions, melanocytes robustly express CCR10. if the chemokine receptor profile of melanoma cells changes, the cancer may metastasize. a recent study using a Ccr10/ mouse suggests that CCL28 and CCR10 may not be the only chemokine/receptor pair involved in the recruitment of IgA plasmablasts, at least in the gut. no chemokine/receptor axis have been reported yet. azan et al., 1997; Pan et al., 1997b; pan et al., 1997b; azan et al., 1997b;. Pan et al., 1997b;. Pan et al., 1997b;. azan et al., 1997b;. et al., 1997b;. et al., 1997b;. et al., 1997b CX3CR1 is present on lymphocytes, microglial cells, and neurons. it is highly expressed on a subset of terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells. expression of CX3CR1 is a powerful tool to identify leukocyte subsets. distinct surface Cx3cr1 levels delineates two functional subsets of murine blood monocytes. this dichotomy appears conserved in humans as CD14+CD16. F4/80hi Cx3cr1hi macrophages positive or negative for CD11c produce large amounts of IL-10 and are poor APCs. DCs express low to intermediate levels of Cx3cr1 and can be divided into three subsets: CD11c+CD103+Cx3cr1 CD11b that cross-present antigens to CD8+ lymphocytes. monocyte survival depends on membrane-tethered CX3CL1 and not on the shed soluble form, suggesting dedicated activities related to the structural form of the ligand. reduced macrophage number in the gut lamina propria of Cx3cr1/ mice is associated with increased translocation of commensal bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes. contradictory results suggest that the CX3CR1-CX3CL1 axis may have complex biologic effects depending on the host insult. the role of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 in inflammatory lung disorders was recently reviewed. the first genetic tools to evaluate the biologic role of CX3CR1 in human disease were two common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the open reading frame of CX3CR1. each of which changed a single amino acid, V249I and T280M, in transmembrane domains 6 and 7. the CX3CR1 M280 allele was associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis independent of other established risk factors and uncorrelated with disease severity. a number of studies have evaluated whether CX3CR1-blocking agents may have effects in the treatment of inflammatory disorders in animal models. a number of studies have evaluated whether CX3CR1-blocking agents may have effects in the treatment of inflammatory disorders in animal models. inhaled CX3CR1 antagonist or intraperitoneal injection of CX3CR1 antibody protects mice from asthma. no CX3CR1-targeted therapeutics have been evaluated in humans. CX3CR1 blocks CX3CR1-dependent activities in vivo and in vitro. soluble CX3CL1 promotes strong adhesion of leukocytes that express CX3CR1. soluble CX3CL1 is produced by the cleavage of native CX3CL1. Cx3cr1 is mainly expressed on monocytes, microglial cells, and NK cells. subpopulations of both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes are CX3CR1+ in human. expression of CX3CR1 is a powerful tool to identify leukocyte subsets. the expression of Cx3cr1 on DCs remains controversial. five subpopulations were defined in the lamina propria of the small intestine. retinoic acid and TGF are expressed in the brain. Cx3cr1-deficient mice are fertile and develop normally in a pathogen-free environment. the mechanism appears to involve Cx3cr1 effects on monocyte recruitment into atherosclerotic plaque and survival of monocytes. set of CX3CR1+ macrophages suppress T-cell responses. deficiency was reported to promote microglial neurotoxicity in different neuropathologic murine models. contradictory results suggest that the CX3CR1-CX3CL1 axis may have complex biologic effects depending on the host insult. mice displayed severe morbidity and mortality after vaccinia virus infection associated with a defect in lung DC recruitment and reduced T-cell effector functions. recent work provided compelling evidence for functional expression of CX3CR1 on cells of myeloid origin in asthma. the first evidence in humans that chemokines have a genetic role in age-related macular degeneration involved CX3CR1. a small-scale study (85 case patients and 105 controls) found CX3CR1-I249 and -M280 alleles at a higher frequency in people with AMD than control subjects. -blocking antibodies significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival (Robinson et al., 2000), reduced inflammation and fibrosis, and preserved renal function in a renal ischemia-reperfusion model (Furuichi et al., 2006) but delayed skin wound healing (Ishida et al., 2008) XCL1 is an exceptional chemokine because it has only two canonical cysteines instead of four and can form only one disulfide bond. XCL1 is an exceptional chemokine because it has only two canonical cysteines instead of four and can form only one disulfide bond. agonist but fails to bind heparin, whereas the second structure binds heparin with high affinity but fails to activate XCR1. XCL1 is now known to be produced by activated CD8+ T cells, dendritic epidermal invariant V3V1 T cells and NK cells. it was considered to be the first bona fide lymphocyte-specific chemokine. it was therefore considered to be the first bona fide lymphocyte-specific chemokine. it was also considered to represent a new class of chemokine (now called the XC subfamily) XCR1 mRNA was reported to be expressed by CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and neutrophils. this is consistent with some but not all of the published results for presumed target cells of XCL1. this data may be due mostly to PCR amplification of contaminating DNA in RNA samples. XCR1 is expressed exclusively on murine CD8+ DCs. absence of XCL1 impaired the development of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to antigens cross-presented by CD8+ DCs. the unique expression pattern of XCR1 observed in the mouse was shown to be conserved. Xcr1/ mice have decreased early CD8+ T-cell responses associated with higher bacterial loads early in infection. thymic DCs are also shown to express XCR1 whereas medullary thymic epithelial cells express XCL1. XCL1 expression in lymphocytes such as CD8+ T cells and NK cells has been shown to be negative. XCL1-XCR1 axis may be most useful for the development of effective cancer immunotherapy after all. HHV8 encodes vCCL2 and vCCL3 to suppress host cross-presentation machinery to evade immune recognition. vCCL2 is a broad spectrum antagonist of human chemokine receptors including XCR1. vCCL3 is a highly selective agonist for XCR1. XCL1 is encoded by a gene within the CCR cluster on human chromosome 3p21. it does not bind CC chemokines. XCL1 is an exceptional chemokine because it has only two canonical cysteines instead of four. XCL1 adopts two distinct structures in equilibrium in physiologic solution conditions. XCL1 was originally reported to be produced by CD8+ T cells. Activated CD8+ T cells secrete XCL1 together with CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5. XCL1 was also originally described as a chemoattractant for lymphocytes. XCL1 was first reported to be strongly expressed in placenta but weakly in spleen and thymus. XCL1 and XCL2 were equipotent agonists in chemotaxis and calcium flux assays in XCR1-transfectants. XCR1 mRNA was reported to be expressed by CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and neutrophils. the XCR1 gene has two exons, according to Dorner et al. (2009). other cells examined, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, plasmacytoid DCs, etc., were all negative. absence of XCL1 impaired the development of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to antigens cross-presented by CD8+ DCs. human blood BDCA3+ DC expresses XCR1 because human blood BDCA3+ DC expresses XCR1. XCL1 mRNA is selectively expressed by NK cells. dermal CD103+ DCs share with spleen CD8+ DCs a high efficiency for antigen cross-presentation. Xcl1/ mice are defective in the medullary accumulation of thymic DCs. medullary thymic epithelial cells express XCL1. XCL1 expression in lymphocytes such as CD8+ T cells and NK cells has been shown to be negative. the XCL1-XCR1 axis may be most useful for the development of effective cancer immunotherapy after all. HHV6A encodes a CC-chemokine receptor homolog named U51A. it is constitutively active in inositol phosphate turnover and mediates chemotactic and calcium mobilization responses to various CC chemokines. U51A may promote virus dissemination within the host by enhancing migration of infected cells to sites of chemokine production and/or evasion of host immune recognition. XCR1 may eventually provide an excellent surface molecule to deliver antigens to CD8+-type DCs for cross-presentation to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. XCL1-XCR1 axis may also be involved in some diseases involving cytotoxic T cells such as organ-specific autoimmune diseases. complex cell responses take place after ACKR1 ligation by cognate chemokines. ACKR1 is the most promiscuous among all chemokine receptors. it binds over 20 different chemokines from both the CC and CXC subfamilies. the two antithetical duffy erythrocyte antigens, Fya and Fyb, are the products of two polymorphic alleles FYA and FYB present on chromosome 1. they differ only in a single nucleotide, G versus A within codon 42, encoding glycine and aspartic acid in Fya and Fyb. the third major ACKR1 polymorphism results from a T to C substitution at plasmodium strain, but not Plasmodium falciparum, express a specific duffy-binding protein that binds ACKR1 and mediates parasite adhesion to erythrocytes required for their subsequent invasion. however, the role of duffy-binding protein-ACKR1 interaction in parasite infectivity and the development of vivax malaria is not absolute. erythrocyte ACKR1 plays diverse pathophysiological roles in chemokine homeostasis. it was traditionally considered to act as a chemokine \u201csink\u201d dampening the levels of circulating inflammatory chemokines, thus suppressing systemic leukocyte activation. it is not clear what may be the teleologic role of ACKR1 as a chemokine blood reservoir. ACKR1 plays an entirely different role in venular endothelial cells. these cells can bind, internalize, and transport chemokines from the basolateral to apical membrane, leading to chemokine immobilization and presentation on the luminal microvilli. chemokine internalization by ACKR1 does not lead to their lysosomal degradation. ACKR2 is sulfated on N-terminal tyrosine residues and possesses a single N-terminal glycosylation site that is not required for function. ACKR2 is expressed constitutively in the skin, gut, lung, and placenta. in adult tissues, ACKR2 is expressed on some but not all lymphatic endothelial cells. ACKR2 is expressed by a range of leukocyte subtypes. it binds promiscuously all inflammatory CC-chemokines, but not homeostatic CC-chemokines or other classes of chemokines. chemokine binding to ACKR2 can be manipulated by protease CD26. ACKR2 constitutively internalizes and recycles from the cell surface via intracellular vesicles. ACKR2 is able to bind and internalize ligand and target it for lysosomal degradation. ACKR2 is in intracellular vesicles, with only 3\u20135% on the cell surface. ACKR2/ mice display markedly exaggerated inflammatory responses. exaggerated inflammatory responses are seen in all tissues of ACKR2/ mice. expression of ACKR2 on the syncytiotrophoblast layer in the placenta appears important. ACKR2 is prominently expressed by keratinocytes in apparently healthy looking uninvolved skin. this is clearly evident in patients with systemic sclerosis who show an inverse correlation between leukocyte ACKR2 expression levels and circulating inflammatory chemokine levels. ACKR3 is an atypical chemokine receptor first identified as the orphan receptor RDC1 in a dog cDNA library. similarity of its sequence to chemokine receptors was facilitated by similarity of its sequence to chemokine receptors. ACKR3 binds CXCL12, but not other CXCR3 ligands. mortality is due to stenotic defects in all four heart valves. the same phenotype occurs when Ackr3 is deleted only in endothelium. this suggests that the function of the receptor is most critical in these cells. ckr3 function appears to involve scavenging of Cxcl12 by stromal cells expressing Ackr3 behind the migrating front of primordial germ cells. stromal cells arrive at sites where Cxcl12 is translated from mRNA but do not continue to migrate forward if the scavenger activity of Ackr3 does not create a guidance cue. the enhanced cycling of the receptor in the presence of Cxcl12 can be seen as an helix III, according to the structure of CXCR4, is assumed to be essential for G protein coupling. if this motif is mutated to the canonical sequence the receptor still fails to trigger calcium flux in response to ligand binding. if this motif is mutated to the canonical sequence the receptor still fails to trigger calcium flux in response to ligand binding. migration of interneurons requires expression of both CXCR4 and ACKR3. signaling by both receptors has been suggested to contribute to directed migration by activation of G protein and MAPK pathways downstream CXCR4 and ACKR3 respectively. growth and spreading of breast cancer cells depends on expression of both receptors. ACKR3 expression is enhanced during pathologic processes such as inflammation and cancer. it is broadly expressed on cancers of hematopoietic origin, such as sarcomas, prostate and breast cancer, and gliomas. the role of ACKR3 in the neoplasms remains unclear. small molecule inhibitors of ACKR3 have been manufactured by Chemocentryx. they compete for CXCL12 binding to ACKR3 in the low nanomolar range (5 nM) but are agonists with respect to arrestin recruitment. ACKR3 binds CXCL12 differently from CXCR4 but at very elevated concentrations. ACKR4 is located within the CCR cluster on human chromosome 3p21. it was first reported to bind CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25. ACKR4 is now accepted that ACKR4 binds to the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25. ACKR4 transcripts are detected in heart, lung, and gut, but not leukocytes. ACKR4 reporter mice revealed expression of the receptor in skin keratinocytes and a variety of secondary lymphoid organs. ackr4/ mice confirmed a role for Ackr4 in adaptive immunity. ACKR4 expression also reported in hepatic and breast cancer cell lines. downregulation correlated with breast carcinoma invasiveness, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival rate. a subcommittee on atypical chemokine receptor nomenclature reserve the name ACKR5 awaiting confirmatory reports of chemokine binding and lack of or atypical signaling. human CCRL2 is expressed by most leukocyte subtypes, including monocyte/macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, NK cells, mast cells, and CD34+ bone marrow precursors in humans. ccrl2/ mice show enhanced tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltration in a model of passive immunoglobulin E-mediated cutaneous anaphylaxis. they also show partial protection in a model of ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation. in a different model, adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated a key role for dendritic cells. CCRL2 was shown to bind CCL19 and impair ERK1/2 phosphorylation. this resembles signaling interference previously reported for ACKR1 and ACKR2. CCRL2 expression was found in neutrophils and macrophages recovered from synovial fluids of patients with arthritis. CCL18 is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. it is thought to mediate T-cell attraction to DCs. ACKR6 has been reserved for PITPNM3 pending confirmation of atypical chemokine receptor properties. C5L2 undergoes constitutive clathrin-dependent internalization. it is weakly phosphorylated and does not induce calcium flux, chemotaxis, or MAPK activation. atypical chemokine receptors, in both human and murine C5L2, the DRY motif in the second intracellular domain is modified. in sepsis, increased expression of C5L2 on neutrophils, lung, and liver. a fourfold increase in IL-6 levels after C5L2 blockade was reported in a rat model. negative correlation between C5L2 levels and clinical outcome in septic patients has been reported. ACKR1 is a heptahelical cell membrane protein, structurally similar to classic chemokine receptors. ACKR1 lacks within the second intracellular loop the entire DRYLAIV consensus motif. no conventional chemokine-induced intracellular signaling responses have been recorded downstream of ACKR1. ACKR1 is also the oldest known chemokine receptor. it was discovered in 1950 as a blood group antigen. it is constitutively expressed by endothelial cells of venules and small veins. ACKR1\u2019s extracellular N-terminal domain is linked with the fourth extracellular domain via a disulfide bond. the third major ACKR1 polymorphism results from a T to C substitution at nucleotide-67 within the promoter region of the promoter region of the FYB allele. this polymorphism effectively abolishes the transcription of ACKR1 in erythroid cells, leading to a \u201cDuffy-negative\u201d phenotype mixed duffy-positive and -negative people can carry parasites asymptomatically. this suggests the resistance to vivax malaria in regions of west africa may be conveyed by the FYB(ES) polymorphism at a population level by reduced parasite transmission from infected humans to mosquito vectors. recently the relationship of ACKR1 to malaria has been extended to P. falciparum, at least in vitro. erythrocyte ACKR1 maintains chemokine levels in blood, not only on the erythrocyte surface, but also in plasma. it is not clear what may be the teleologic role of ACKR1 as a chemokine blood reservoir. ACKR1 plays an entirely different role in venular endothelial cells. chemokine internalization by ACKR1 does not lead to their lysosomal degradation. alternative mechanisms may involve heterodimerization of ACKR1 and classic signaling chemokine receptors. ACKR2 lacks the canonical DRYLAIV motif in ICL2. ACKR2 is sulfated on N-terminal tyrosine residues and possesses a single N-terminal glycosylation site that is not required for function. ACKR2 is expressed constitutively in the skin, gut, lung, and placenta. ACKR2 is expressed constitutively in the skin, gut, lung, and placenta. a number of analyses have highlighted the importance of a proline residue in position 2 (P2) in chemokines for binding. this suggests that chemokine binding to ACKR2 can be manipulated by the protease CD26. intriguingly, primates, including humans, have evolved a variant of the inflammatory CC-chemokine, CCL3, that lacks the P2 residue. ACKR2 + vesicles correspond to Rab5+ and Rab11+ early and recycling endosomes. chemokine-scavenging activity was recently shown to require activation of a -arrestin1-dependent, G protein-independent signaling pathway. ACKR2/ mice display no obvious resting phenotype, but marked phenotypes are revealed in models of inflammatory pathologies. exaggerated inflammatory responses are seen in all tissues of ACKR2/ mice. expression of ACKR2 on the syncytiotrophoblast layer in the placenta appears important for protecting the embryo during maternal inflammatory responses. increased miscarriage rates have been reported in ACKR2/ mice administered LPS or autoantibodies. in psoriasis, ACKR2 is prominently expressed by keratinocytes in apparently healthy looking uninvolved skin. interferon- is the strongest regulator of ACKR2 expression reported. tumorigenesis have indicated an important role for ACKR2 as a tumor-suppressor gene. ACKR3 transcripts are detected in hematopoietic cells, mesenchymal cells, and neuronal tissue. similarity of its sequence to chemokine receptors was facilitated by similarity of its sequence to chemokine receptors and localization of human RDC1 to chromosome 2 in the vicinity of CXCR2 and CXCR4. type occurs when Ackr3 is deleted only in endothelium. this indicates that the lethal cardiac phenotype is not caused by a defective Cxcl11/Ackr3 interaction. the stenotic cardiac valve phenotype in Ackr3/ mice does not occur in Cxcl12/ mice. the enhanced cycling of Ackr3 in the presence of Cxcl12 can be seen as an agonist-driven response. the signal transduction pathway involves stimulated arrestin recruitment and chemokine-enhanced coupling to the internalization machinery. the precise molecular pathway for ACKR3 signaling remains unclear. mammalian ACKR3 acts as a critical scavenger on brain microvessel endothelium. perivascular CXCL12 acts as a kind of glue, preventing the few emigrating leukocytes to enter the parenchyma. the marked expression of ACKR3 in ganglia of the central nervous system suggests additional functional relevance. signaling by both receptors has been suggested to contribute to directed migration by activation of G protein and MAPK pathways downstream CXCR4 and ACKR3 respectively. ACKR3 has also been shown to be essential for maintaining CXCL12 levels that are optimal for CXCR4-dependent migratory responses. ACKR3 expression is enhanced during pathologic processes such as inflammation and cancer. it is broadly expressed on cancers of hematopoietic origin, such as sarcomas, prostate and breast cancer, and gliomas. the role of ACKR3 in the neoplasms remains unclear. the consequences of targeting ACKR3 with inhibitors are complex and potentially opposed. small molecule inhibitors of ACKR3 have been manufactured by Chemocentryx. CCX771 and its prototypes CCX754 and CCX733 compete for CXCL12 binding to ACKR3 in the low nanomolar range (5 nM) but are agonists with respect to arrestin recruitment. CCX771 and its prototypes CCX754 and CCX733 compete for CXCL12 binding to ACKR3 in the low nanomolar range (5 nM) monoclonal antibodies can efficiently block CXCL12 binding and have minor effects on arrestin recruitment. ACKR4 is located within the CCR cluster on human chromosome 3p21. ACKR4 binds to the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25. in humans, a pseudogene is located on human chromosome 6q24.1. ACKR4 internalizes and drives its ligands to degradation. ACKR4 expression was reported in hepatic and breast cancer cell lines. downregulation correlated with breast carcinoma invasiveness, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival rate. ACKR4 blocking agents have not been developed yet. in humans, two variants have been reported, originally called CRAM-A and CRAM-B (chemokine receptor for activated macrophages A and B), that differ in the N-terminal region of the receptor. CCRL2 shares over 40% amino acid identity with CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5. CCRL2 expression in dendritic cells and neutrophils is upregulated by LPS, TNF, and other inflammatory stimuli. both in humans and mice, CCRL2 expression in dendritic cells and neutrophils is rapidly upregulated by LPS, TNF, and other inflammatory stimuli. CCRL2 was shown to bind a portion of chemerin not involved in binding and activation of ChemR23 and CCRL2-expressing cells preloaded with chemerin induced functional responses in cells transfected with ChemR23. CCRL2 is expressed in some stages of B-cell maturation, and CCL5 stimulation can modulate the level of its expression. CCRL2 expression was found in neutrophils and macrophages recovered from synovial fluids of patients with arthritis. genetic studies on CCRL2 nonconservative allelic variants suggest its involvement in pneumocystis pneumonia development in patients with AIDS. a typical 7TM G protein-coupled receptor has been recently identified for CCL18. the name ACKR6 has been reserved for PITPNM3 pending confirmation of atypical chemokine receptor properties. drug development. Blocking agents for this receptor have not been developed yet. similar to ACKR2, C5L2 undergoes constitutive clathrin-dependent internalization. in both human and murine C5L2, the DRY motif in the second intracellular domain is modified, but reconstituting this sequence only partially restored the receptor ability to induce calcium transients. in human neutrophils, C5L2 is mostly stored in intracellular compartments. in sepsis, increased expression of C5L2 on neutrophils, lung, and liver. a fourfold increase in IL-6 levels after C5L2 blockade was reported in a rat model. negative correlation between C5L2 levels and clinical outcome in septic patients has been reported. results in vivo highlight complex interplay between C5aR and C5L2. C5L2 blocking agents have not been developed yet. Virus-Encoded Chemokine Receptors and Chemokine-Binding Proteins Viruses have evolved numerous survival strategies. cell migration HHV6 U12 CC Unknown U51 CC Downregulation of CCL5 expression HHV7 U12 CC Unknown U51 CC Unknown 2-Herpesvirus EHV2 E1 CCL11 Unknown HHV8 ORF74 CXC Lytic expression Constitutively active, but regulated by CXC agonists and inverse agonists. US28 encodes four 7TM receptors as follows: US27, US28, UL33, and UL78. first three are structurally most homologous to chemokine receptors. first three are structurally most homologous to chemokine receptors. US28 promotes HIV cell entry (Pleskoff et al., 1997), vascular smooth muscle cell migration (Streblow et al., 1999, 2001), and carcinogenesis (Maussang et al., 2006, 2009; Bongers et al., 2010; Slinger et al., 2010); allosteric inverse agonists have been discovered for US28. expression of U51 leads to downregulation of CCL5 secretion and FOG-2. HHV7 genome encodes two chemokine receptor homologs, U12 and U51. HHV7 is also widespread and a cause of persistent infection. a 7TM receptor with no resemblance to the chemokine system (E6-EHV2) is described below. 7L from Yaba-like disease virus infects primates and causes vesicular skin lesions. the virus encodes two 7TM receptors, 7L and 145R. asymptomatic infection in the natural host, the squirrel monkey (Saimirii sciureus), and fatal lymphoproliferative disease upon transmission to certain other primates. the gene ECRF3 is located in ORF74, which is conserved among members of the rhadinovirus lineage (2-herpesvirus) HHV8 ORF74 is less widely distributed in the population than most other herpesviruses. primary HHV8 infection is usually asymptomatic, but is associated with three neoplasms: Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease. HHV8 ORF74 acts as a strong paracrine activator. cells expressing this receptor secrete various growth, angiogenic, and proinflammatory cytokines. pharmacological features correlate with several in vivo studies placing HHV8 ORF74 centrally in relation to oncogenic properties of HHV8. chemokine agonists activate MHV68 ORF74 to signal through multiple pathways, including Gi/o, Gq/11, and MAPKs. however, in contrast to HHV8 ORF74, no constitutive activity has been observed for this receptor. experiments done with MHV68 ORF74 knockout virus have shown that it is necessary for the reactivation of virus from latency. a DTW-motif is found in EHV2 ORF74 and reintroduction of the DRY-motif results in decreased signaling. small molecule inverse agonists are found among the virus-encoded chemokines. vMIP-II from HHV8 and MC148 from Molluscum contagiosum virus act as antagonists and inverse agonists. broad-spectrum antagonism by vMIP-II has been demonstrated in vivo in a rat model of experimental glomerulonephritis. the virus-encoded chemokine-binding proteins (vCKBPs) have no known cellular homologs and their evolutionary sources therefore remain obscure. vCKBP-III 2-Herpesvirus MHV68 M3 XC, CC, CXC, and CX3C Important for latency. chemokine-binding proteins may serve as templates for development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs. smCKBP was identified in schistosome egg secretions but not from other stages of the worm\u2019s life cycle. the molecular identity of smCKBP, achieved by a proteomic approach, revealed a novel sequence unrelated to chemokines, chemokine receptors, and other known proteins. smCKBP also was tested in a number of animal disease models. smCKBP has specific in vivo activity in suppression of acute or local inflammation. lack of effect in the chronic models could be caused by generation of host anti-smCKBP antibody response. this is common for large DNA viruses, which have a strong preference for chemokine and chemokine receptor genes. cytomegalovirus encodes four 7TM receptors as follows: US27, US28, UL33, and UL78. first three are structurally most homologous to chemokine receptors. US27 and UL33 remain orphan receptors, whereas US28 was the first viral chemokine receptor to be identified. CC chemokine ligands are agonists, inducing Gq/11 activation, calcium flux, G12/13-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell migration, and MAPK signaling. allosteric inverse agonists have been found for US28. their ability to affect HCMV disease pathogenesis remains unknown. HHV6 is a widespread herpesvirus that causes persistent infection. the HHV7 genome encodes two chemokine receptor homologs, U12 and U51 (Nicholas, 1996). some studies have demonstrated that in K562 cells both receptors elicit calcium flux induced by CCL17, CCL19, CCL21, or CCL22. in murine L1.2 cells little response was seen without the coexpression of CCR4 or CCR7. virus encodes two 7TM receptors, 7L and 145R, that have extraordinarily high homology to CCR8, 73 and 68%, respectively. 7L-mediated G protein activation was observed in response to the CCR8 agonists human CCL1 and mouse Ccl1 as well as human CCL4 and CCL7 and mouse Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl7 and Ccl21. the gene ECRF3 is located in ORF74, which is conserved among members of the rhadinovirus lineage (2-herpesvirus) all ORF74s have highest structural homology to human CXCR2. it signals constitutively through Gi/o and G12/13, but activates Gq/11, Gi/o and the transcription factors NFAT. HHV8 ORF74 encodes only one 7TM receptor. binds multiple human CXC-chemokines (CXCL1-3, 5, 7\u20138, and 12) with high affinity. it is regulated by various chemokine ligands. no small-molecule ligands exist for native HHV8 ORF74. but by site-directed mutagenesis and incorporation of metal-ion binding sites it has been shown that both its constitutive and ligand-mediated activity can be modulated by small molecule ligands. HHV8 ORF74 knockout virus is necessary for reactivation of virus from latency. E1 and ORF74 are the two chemokine receptors encoded by the equine -herpesvirus 2 (EHV2). a DTW-motif is found in EHV2 ORF74 and reintroduction of the DRY-motif results in decreased signaling. vMIP-II from HHV8 and MC148 from Molluscum contagiosum virus act as antagonists and inverse agonists. the virus-encoded chemokine-binding proteins (vCKBPs) have no known cellular homologs. a distinct pattern of four groups appear (vCKBPI-IV) these are all described in detail in Table 8. CKBP-IV -Herpesvirus Equine herpesvirus 1+3 bovine herpesvirus 1+5 rangiferine herpesvirus 1 cervine herpesvirus 1 gG XC, CC, and CXC Interferes with chemokine-GAG interaction and chemokine-receptor interaction. chemokine and small-molecule antagonists and inverse agonists have been identified for several viral chemokine receptor CX3CL1 acts as both a partial inverse agonist (Casarosa et al., 2001; McLean et al., 2004) and an agonist. CC chemokine ligands are agonists, inducing Gq/11 activation, calcium flux, G12/13-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell migration. HHV6 is a widespread herpesvirus that causes persistent infection. HHV7 encodes two chemokine receptor homologs, U12 and U51. chemotactic response was induced by U12 in response to CCL17, CCL19, CCL21, or CCL22 (Tadagaki et al., 2005, 2007). however, this was not observed in the murine L1.2 cell line (Tadagaki et al., 2007). the significance of EHV2 as a pathogen remains uncertain. the virus encodes two 7TM receptors, 7L and 145R, that have extraordinarily high homology to CCR8, 73 and 68% respectively. 7L-mediated G protein activation was observed in response to the CCR8 agonists human CCL1 and mouse Ccl1 as well as to human CCL4 and CCL7 and mouse Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl7, and Ccl21. ECRF3 binds ELR+ CXC chemokines (Rosenkilde and Schwartz, 2004; Strieter et al., 1995), with the potency order CXCL6 > CXCL1 > CXCL8 > CXCL7. it activates Gq/11, Gi/o and the transcription factors NFAT, cAMP response element-binding protein, and nuclear factor-B in a ligand-dependent manner. HHV8 ORF74 acts as a strong paracrine activator. it acts as a strong paracrine activator, because cells expressing this receptor secrete various growth, angiogenic, and proinflammatory cytokines. HHV8 ORF74 is regulated by various chemokine ligands. no small-molecule ligands exist for native HHV8 ORF74. but by site-directed mutagenesis and incorporation of metal-ion binding sites it has been shown that both constitutive and ligand-mediated activity can be modulated. EHV2 ORF74 is homologous to other ORF74 receptors from -herpesviruses. it binds human CXCL6 with subsequent activation of the Gi/o pathway. a DTW-motif is found in EHV2 ORF74. vMIP-II from HHV8 and MC148 from Molluscum contagiosum virus act as antagonists and inverse agonists. vCKBPs have no known cellular homologs and their evolutionary sources remain obscure. vCKBPI-IV -Herpesvirus Equine herpesvirus 1+3 bovine herpesvirus 1+5 rangiferine herpesvirus 1+5 cervine herpesvirus 1 gG XC, CC, and CXC Interferes with chemokine-GAG interaction and chemokine-receptor interaction. virus-encoded 7TM chemokine receptors are generally more promiscuous with respect to ligand binding and signaling pathways than their human counterparts. chemokine and small-molecule antagonists and inverse agonists have been identified for several viral chemokine receptors. smCKBP was identified in schistosome egg secretions but not from other stages of the worm\u2019s life cycle. recombinant smCKBP blocked ear swelling caused by neutrophil infiltration. smCKBP also blocked neutrophil infiltration in a pulmonary inflammation model. smCKBP did not alter disease in eAE or collagen-induced arthritis models. recombinant tick Evasins Evasin Chemokine Affinity by SPR IC50c Therapeutic Efficacy In Vivo nM Evasin-1 CCL3 0.16a 2.0 Dermal inflammation in Ackr2/ mice Bleomycin induced lung fibrosis CCL18 3.2 nd Evasin-3 CXCL1 0.85a 20 mBSA induced arthritis CXCL3 0.97 nd Intestinal ischemia reperfusion CX Tick salivary gland extracts purified by liquid chromatography were shown to bind [125I]CXCL8 and inhibit CXCL8 activity in receptor binding and chemotaxis assays. in this study, D. reticulatus, A. variegatum, and Ixodes ricinus SGE were collected after 5 days of feeding on mice. a single cDNA clone responsible for the CCL3 binding activity was identified and named Evasin-1. a second sequence was identified, named Evasin-2, that also was thought to be a CCL3-binding protein. compared with viral CKBPs and smCKBPs, Evasin-1 and Evasin-3 are more selective. the chemoattractant properties of CCL18 are not impressive, at least in vitro. the fact that ticks express a binding protein that specifically neutralizes its activity suggests that it may have an important role in host defense against pathogens. administration of Evasin-4 in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury greatly ameliorated clinical score, weight loss, and overall tissue destruction and mortality. the effects are probably related to its ability to block several CC chemokines, including those responsible for eosinophil recruitment. at least five putative Evasin-1 and Evasin-3 homologs have been identified by in-depth sequence analysis of the R. sanguineus sialotranscriptome. potential Evasin homologs have been deposited in the Genome database for Boophilus microplus and I. scapularis (C. Power, unpublished results) this may explain the difficulty in developing safe and effective medicines for immunologically mediated disease by targeting one chemokine or one chemokine receptor at a time."}
