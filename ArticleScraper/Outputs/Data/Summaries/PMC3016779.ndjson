{"summary": "study participants were patients admitted to the prince of Wales hospital for suspected SARS during the first week of the outbreak (12) patients had an acute onset of fever (>38\u00b0C, most with chills or rigor), dyspnea, myalgia, headache, and hypoxemia. patients showed no response to antimicrobial drugs prescribed for typical and atypical pneumonia. all cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C, except for MDCK. all NPAs were added to an additional LLC-MK2 cell culture tube. cells were examined daily for cytopathic effect. after 14 days of incubation, a hemadsorption test was performed. for the second round of amplification, we used 0.2 M of inner primers 5\u2032-GAG TAG GGA TCA TCA AGC A-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCT TAG CTG RTA TAC AGT GTT-3\u2032. the PCR was conducted at 95\u00b0C for 15 min for denaturation of DNA templates and activation of the hot-start DNA polymerase (HotStarTaq, QIAGEN GmbH) nucleotide sequence of purified PCR products was determined by PCR-based cycle sequencing performed with the inner primers. sequences were confirmed by repeated PCRs and sequencing from both directions. cell culture supernatants were coated on formvar-carbon grids. injected with NPAs or double distilled water to replace NPA sample after every fifth reaction. negative controls did not show positive results, which indicated absence of cross-contamination. results showed no inhibitors were present in the extracted RNA preparations. nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were taken by inserting a suction catheter into the nasopharyngeal area via the nostril. a low suction force was applied to collect approximately 0.5 mL fluid. all NPAs were added onto rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2), human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2), mardin darby canine Kidney (MDCK), human embryonic lung fibroblast the reaction was carried out in a single-tube (Superscript One-Step RT-PCR and Platinum Taq; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) using 0.2 M of each primer and thermal cycling conditions of 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 94\u00b0C for 3 min. for the second round of amplification, we used 0.2 M of inner primers 5\u2032-GAG TAG GGA TCA TCA AGC A-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCT TAG R the RT-PCR for coronavirus was conducted similarly to HMPV. the nucleotide sequence of purified PCR products was determined by PCR-based cycle sequencing performed with the inner primers. negative controls were placed using the same cell line injected with maintenance medium after every fifth cell culture tube. negative controls were placed using cell culture medium to replace cell supernatant injected with NPAs or double distilled water to replace NPA sample after every fifth reaction. results showed no inhibitors were present in the extracted RNA preparations. cytopathic effect developed after 10 to 12 days of incubation. HMPV RT-PCR showed a PCR product of the expected size (89 bp) from 25 (52.1%) isolation materials injected with specimens. the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were identical to the F-gene fragment of HMPV. no. of patients (%) Human metapneumovirus F-gene sequence detected by RT-PCR Nasopharyngeal aspirate HEp-2 cells LLC-MK2 cells MDCK cells 1 (4.0) positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive 18 (72.0) negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative fractile rounding occurred after 10 to 22 days of incubation. cytopathic effect progressed slowly to detachment from cell monolayer. the supernatants of these passages were also positive by the HMPV RT-PCR. combination approach of conventional virus isolation and molecular detection could be successfully applied to the isolation of HMPV. among the 48 participants, 6 (12.5%) had both HMPV and coronavirus isolated from NPAs, 19 (39.6%) had HMPV, and 5 (10.4%) had coronavirus. eighteen (37.5%) had no virus isolated from the cell lines that we used. multiple cell lines including LLC-MK2, HEp-2, MDCK, human foreskin fibroblast, Vero, Mink lung, A-549, human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD), transformed human kidney (293), and human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) were used for isolation of HMPV. the results showed that HMPV only grew on LLC-MK2 cells with cytopathic effect of round and refringent cytopathic effect took a mean incubation time of 17.3 days to develop. a co-circulation of two pathogens within our study group was possible. a co-circulation of two pathogens within our study group was possible. coronavirus was also detected in five of six patients living in canada. a few recent studies implicate a strong association of a novel coronavirus with the worldwide outbreak of SARS (16\u201318)"}
