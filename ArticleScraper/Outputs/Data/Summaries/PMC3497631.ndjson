{"summary": "autophagy is a highly conserved degradation pathway that recycles cytoplasmic organelles and proteins in response to starvation. autophagosome formation is regulated by the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) kinase, which is a negative regulator of autophagy. mTORC1 regulates a multimeric complex (the ULK-1 complex) made up of ULK-1 (unc-51-like kinas ubiquitinylated proteins can be directed to autophagosomes by the linker protein p62 (also known as sequestersome 1), which binds polyubiquitinated proteins and membrane-associated LC3II. delivery of viruses to lysosomes by autophagy can play a protective role during infection when it leads to virus degradation. polioviruses generate double-membrane vesicles resembling autophagosomes in cell culture (6, 45) and in vivo (18), and nonstructural proteins required for replication of human pathogens. poliovirus 2BC can induce lipidation of LC3 (42) studies with poliovirus suggest that autophagy may actually promote rather than protect against infection. poliovirus 3A protein blocks protein secretion between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus (7). for FMDV, protein secretion is blocked by 2BC (27) or coexpression of 2B and 2C (28) IBRS-2 cells were cultivated in Glasgow's modified Eagle's medium. all cell culture media were supplemented with 20 mM glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. working stocks of FMDV O1BFS and O1Kcad2 were prepared. CHO cells expressing GFP-LC3 were lysed in 120 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL) and 3 SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the lysate. the membranes were probed with antibodies against LC3 or p62. cell culture medium containing 1% FCS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. unbound virus or capsid was removed by washing. cells were returned to 37\u00b0C in cell culture medium with reduced FCS. MEFs or atg5/ MEFs were incubated for 1 h with FMDV O1BFS in reduced-serum cell culture medium (MOI = 5) to allow virus internalization. the cells were then washed using a low-pH buffer (0.1 M citric acid in 140 mM NaCl, pH 5.2) to inactivate extracellular virus. 2 were prepared using baby hamster kidney (BHK) 21 and primary bovine thyroid cells. the monoclonal antibodies 2C2, 3B5, and D9 recognize the FMDV 3A, 3D, and VP1 proteins (type O viruses) were gifts from Emiliana Brocchi. CHO cells expressing GFP-LC3 were lysed in 120 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL) and 3 SDS-PAGE sample buffer (New England BioLabs) was added to the lysate. inhibitors were added to cells for 0.5 h (nocodazole and scriptaid) or 1 h (wortmannin) prior cells on glass coverslips were incubated for 15 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. cells were washed and incubated in block buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10% normal goat serum, and 10% gelatin) for 0.5 h. the cells were washed using a low-pH buffer (0.1 M citric acid in 140 mM NaCl, pH 5.2) to inactivate extracellular virus. RESULTS FMDV infection causes redistribution and lipidation of LC3. FMDV generates LC3 punctae that resemble autophagosomes early during infection. CHO GFP-LC3 cells were infected for increasing times with FMDV O1BFS. labeling for 3A is not shown for images ix to xii. p62 binds to ubiquitinated proteins and LC3 in the autophagosome membrane. the distribution of p62 was followed during FMDV infection as a second marker for formation of autophagosomes. we also investigated whether FMDV induced lipidation of LC3. Wortmannin does not inhibit induction of GFP-LC3 punctae by FMDV. the class III PI3-kinase vps34 is required for the formation of isolation membranes in response to starvation. the drug was unable to prevent formation of GFP-LC3 punctae in response to FMDV. FMDV nonstructural protein 3A (red) was detected by immunostaining using antibody 2C2. cell nuclei are blue. Scale bars = 10 m. generation of LC3 punctae does not necessarily indicate activation of autophagy. LC3 punctae are induced in the absence of virus replication. UV-inactivated FMDV induced punctae in CHO GFP-LC3 cells. this led us to test whether autophagy was activated during cell entry rather than as consequence of virus replication. LC3 punctae induced by FMDV colocalizes with VP1 in infected cells. FMDV 2B, 2C, and 3A colocalize with LC3 in infected cells. the locations of 3A at 2 h and 3D at 2.5 h postinfection of CHO cells are shown in Fig. 5A, ii (3A) and vi (3D) the GFP-LC3, 3A, and 3D signals were located close to the nucleus (Fig. 5A, i to iii and v to vii) the high-magnification images in Fig. 5A, iv and viii show that the red and green signals were we treated cells with concanamycin A to inhibit the vacuolar ATPase, to raise the pH of endosomes and autophagosomes, and to inhibit proteolysis in lysosomes. the drug was added 1 h postinfection to avoid effects of the inhibitor on cell entry. this supports our conclusion that these viral proteins do not associate with autophagosomes containing LC3. p62 and p62 were positive for p62, suggesting p62 may localize with FMDV-induced autophagosomes. a proportion of the FMDV-induced autophagosomes contain VP1. however, the precise relationships between LC3, p62, and VP1 were difficult to resolve. CHO cells were labeled for the microtubule-organizing center (ii) (red) using an antibody against -tubulin. iii) Merge of images i and ii. Cell nuclei are blue. scriptaid inhibited the perinuclear clustering of LC3, VP1, 3A, or 3D. punctae positive for VP1 was also dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. no dispersal of LC3 or VP1 was seen in infected cells treated with DMSO alone. we analyzed 837 fluorescent punctae in five infected CHO GFP-LC3 cells. four hundred and forty-seven were positive for GFP-LC3 and 224 were positive for VP1. LC3 punctae generated during FMDV infection contain VP1, but not 3A or 3D. CHO cells in nutrient medium contained very few punctae. starvation induced on average 28 punctae per cell, most with a diameter between 0.8 and 1.4 m. the perinuclear GFP-LC3 signal induced by FMDV represented an accumulation of LC3-positive autophagosomes rather than formation of large megaphagosomes. CHO GFP-LC3 cells were mock treated, starved for 2 h, or infected with FMDV O1BFS (MOI = 2) for 2 h (MEFs) or 2.5 h (MEFs) CHO GFP-LC3 cells were visualized by immunostaining for endogenous LC3 (green) autophagosomes are induced by empty capsids or UV-inactivated virus. two classes of receptors can be used by FMDV to initiate infection. heparan sulfate (HS) is used following adaptation of FMDV to cell culture. LC3 punctae are induced when either integrins (IBRS-2 with O1Kcad2) or HS (CHO with O1BFS) serves as the major receptor. induction of LC3 punctae is triggered by an as yet unidentified factor common to both integrin- and HS-mediated entry. average number of LC3 punctae per cell from uninfected and O1Kcad2-infected IBRS-2 cells calculated from immunofluorescence images using IMARIS software. the means and standard errors of the mean for at least 8 cells are shown. the role of autophagy in FMDV infection. lowered yields of intracellular FMDV correlated with reduced extracellular virus. decreased yields result from reduced replication rather than a requirement for autophagy in release of virus from cells. ification at increasing times postinfection shows cells at high magnification counterlabeled for FMDV nonstructural protein 3A as a marker for virus replication. the middle row shows cells at high magnification counterlabeled for FMDV nonstructural protein 3A (red) was detected using antibody 2C2. labeling for p62 (red) is shown in images ix to xii. cell nuclei are blue. Scale bars = 30 m (i to iv) or 10 m (v to xii) infected cell lysates separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody to LC3. LC3 (LC3II) has increased mobility on SDS-PAGE relative to the unlipidated form. increased levels were first seen 30 min postinfection and peaked at 2 to 3 h. p62 is also diminished at 3 h postinfection. CHO GFP-LC3 cells were pretreated with 1/2,000 DMSO (solvent control) (i and iii) or 10 nM wortmannin (ii and iv) for 1 h. the cells were either starved for 2 h in EBSS (i and ii) or infected with FMDV O1BFS (MOI = 2) for 2 h. LC3 punctae are low in wild-type (wt) MEFs (Fig. 3i and iii) and increase markedly in response to starvation (Fig. 3ii) or FMDV infection. the LC3 punctae induced by FMDV were therefore dependent on Atg5. FMDV was inactivated by UV irradiation. loss of infectivity was confirmed by absence of immunofluorescence signal for 3A. FMDV empty capsids that lacked a viral genome also induced LC3 punctae. autophagosome production was analyzed by immunostaining for endogenous LC3 (green) cell nuclei are blue. Scale bars = 10 m. LC3 punctae induced by FMDV do not contain the viral nonstructural proteins but colocalize with VP1. analysis of GFP-LC3 and FMDV nonstructural proteins 3A (i to iv) and 3D (v to viii) LC3 was visualized using the natural fluorescence of GFP (green) the boxed regions of interest in the merged images are shown at high magnification. DMSO alone (as a control for concanamycin A) did not affect the distribution of LC3. many punctae were positive for either VP1 or LC3, while others appeared to be positive for both proteins. the results in Fig. 1 show that FMDV infection induced the formation of p62 punctae. LC3 was visualized using the natural fluorescence of GFP (green). FMDV capsid protein VP1 was detected by immunostaining using antibody D9 (red) cell nuclei are blue. infected CHO GFP-LC3 cells were labeled for microtubule-organizing center. a possible explanation for the pattern in CHO cells is that the perinuclear clustering of LC3 results from transport of autophagosomes along microtubules to the MTOC. a possible explanation for the pattern in CHO cells is that the perinuclear clustering of LC3 results from transport of autophagosomes along microtubules. no dispersal of LC3, VP1, 3A, or 3D was seen in infected cells treated with DMSO alone. the dispersal of LC3 and viral proteins allowed us to calculate the degree of colocalization between LC3 and VP1. the cells were fixed and immunostained for VP1 (i) (red), 3A (iii) (red), or 3D (v) (red) the panels show side-by-side comparisons of confocal images (i, iii, and v) and digital rendering of pixel densities in fluorescent punctae for the same cells. LC3 punctae induced by FMDV closely resemble autophagosomes generated by starvation. starvation increased the number of punctae per cell to an average of 75. CHO GFP-LC3 cells (A), MEFs (B), or IBRS-2 cells (C) were starved for 2 h or infected with FMDV O1BFS (MOI = 2) for 2 h (MEFs) or 2.5 h (MEFs) the LC3 punctae in starved cells were compared to those formed in cells following infection with FMDV. FMDV induced more punctae in CHO GFP-LC3 cells and MEFs than in IBRS-2 cells. this provided further evidence that FMDV induces the formation of authentic autophagosomes. integrin-binding viruses can also induce autophagosome formation. LC3 punctae are induced when either integrins (IBRS-2 with O1Kcad2) or HS (CHO with O1BFS) serves as the major receptor. integrin-binding viruses can also induce autophagosome formation. autophagosome production was analyzed by immunostaining for endogenous LC3 (green) and FMDV 3A protein (red) was detected using monoclonal antibody 2C2. LC3 labeling is shown in confocal images alone (i and iv) or overlaid with the signal for FMDV 3A (ii and v) the proportions of infected cells were similar for wt and atg5/ cells. this suggests that autophagy was not required for cell entry. we also determined the intracellular and extracellular virus yields produced by wt and atg5/ MEFs. ii and iv) Virus yields normalized to MEFs at 8 h postinfection. LC3 punctae were induced by FMDV in three different cell types. this could be detected by immunostaining for endogenous LC3 or by following redistribution of GFP-LC3. noncanonical pathways of autophagy in which autophagosomes are formed independently of beclin-1 and vps34 have recently been described. noncanonical pathways appear to depend on other key autophagy proteins, and autophagosomes appear to mature normally. further experiments will be needed to determine whether FMDV can trigger both canonical and noncanonical autophagy. LC3 punctae induced by FMDV were much smaller than megaphagosomes. perinuclear concentration of autophagosomes in response to viral infection is not unique to CHO cells. the perinuclear concentration of LC3 in response to viral infection is not unique to CHO cells. autophagosomes are induced when either integrins (IBRS-2 with O1Kcad2) or HS (CHO with O1BFS) serves as the major receptor. autophagosomes are induced when either integrins (IBRS-2 with O1Kcad2) or HS (CHO with O1BFS) serves as the major receptor. ovirus and HRV2 titer compared to a 10-fold decrease in the virus yield following inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine. rapamycin causes a 100-fold increase in FMDV yields from human mammary gland MCF-10A cells, but this falls to a 10-fold increase in bovine pharynx cells. the effects of rapamycin on FMDV can also vary between cell types. 50% of autophagosomes costained for VP1. this could indicate the use of autophagosomes for capsid assembly and/or degradation. however, we currently do not know why VP1 costained for VP1. enteroviruses infect via the gastrointestinal tract are relatively resistant to low pH and proteases. the FMDV capsid is highly sensitive to low pH, and transport to acidic autophagosomes and lysosomes would be expected to reduce virus yields. in this way, FMDV would be subject to removal by autophagy."}
