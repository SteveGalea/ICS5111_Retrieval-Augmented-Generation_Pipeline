{"summary": "the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) is a novel reassortant virus. it is comprised of genomic segments originating from swine, avian, and human influenza strains. the virus rapidly achieved sustained human-to-human transmission worldwide. there have been at least 50 million cases and 18,449 confirmed deaths worldwide. novel viral species or strains can also be detected on the basis of conserved sequence homology to known viruses. other novel viruses previously identified by Virochip include a new clade of rhinoviruses [11], a human cardiovirus associated with respiratory and diarrheal illness [12], and avian bornavirus, the etiologic agent of outbreaks of proventricular dilation disease (PDD in birds [13], [14]. deep sequencing strategies have been recently employed to detect seasonal influenza viruses in three clinical samples. we analyzed a group of 17 early cases from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic from the united states (California), Canada, and Mexico by Virochip and deep sequencing. we also demonstrated the utility of deep sequencing of clinical samples to identify and characterize not only the novel pathogen but also the host response to infection. Virochip identification of 2009 H1N1 was designed prior to the emergence of pandemic 2009 H1N1. seventeen samples from Mexico (n = 5), Canada (n = 9) and the united states (California) were suspected or PCR-confirmed cases. the difference was statistically significant for 13 of 17 samples by t-test analysis. microarrays corresponding to seasonal H1N1 influenza displayed the opposite pattern. a virus most closely related to swine influenza A (A/swine/Wisconsin/464/98) was present in these samples. the asterisks denote samples for which the difference in probe intensity is significant by t-test analysis (p0.05). virochip labeled the 17 influenza samples positive for 2009 H1N1 by Virochip with distinct molecular barcodes and analyzed them by paired-end deep sequencing on three lanes. 85% of reads from sample BC-59 aligned to bacterial sequences. reads designated as \u201cother\u201d consisted solely of artificial plasmids or environmental sequences. a high level of diversity of bacterial families was observed in different samples. reads to the top three bacterial families comprised anywhere from 22 to 97% of all bacterial reads. Moraxellaceae or Enterobactericeae were the most common bacterial families found. sixteen reads to murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) were detected in 4 of 17 samples. these reads aligned slightly better to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) than to the recently described human xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus (XMRV) [38], [39], [40], although, for some reads, the alignments were identical. 8.8% 100% - - Ont-MT1 578,886 18,079 18,079 3.1% 100% - - - - Ont-MT2 541,022 8,594 8,594 1.6% 100% - - BC-22 133,568 35,374 6,036 4.5% 17.1% 29,337 - 1 baculovirus BC-44 143,907 67,448 1,824 1.3% 2.7% 65,624 - - influenza reads aligning to orthomyxoviridae were found in all specimens. the percentage of total reads aligning to influenza was linearly correlated with calculated viral titers by real-time quantitative RT-PCR for sites in the united states and Canada. influenza reads from all 8 segments were found in 7 of 17 samples. reads to the NS (nonstructural) segment were significantly less likely to be found than reads to other segments. 97.0% of the 2009 H1N1 genome had at least 1x coverage. the study with the highest coverage of the 2009 H1N1 genome, BC-22 (97.1% coverage at 1X) and Cal-UC2 (92.6% coverage at 1X) were mapped to their full-genome scaffolds obtained by Sanger sequencing. we compared the genomes of BC-22 and Cal-UC2 with the full-genome reference sequence A/California/06/2009(H1N1). no RNA-seq data corresponding to nasopharyngeal samples from healthy individuals can be found in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. genes associated with immunity and interferon were significantly up-regulated (p0.05) in four of the 12 influenza samples as compared to the control samples. de novo assemblies of paired-end reads pooled from all 17 2009 H1N1 samples which did not align to the modified NT database were then constructed using Geneious software (Geneious, Auckland, NZ) a cursory analysis of the remaining 561 contigs that did not map to the influenza genome revealed 90% of these sequences were low-complexity sequencing artifacts. no misassemblies were observed even though the percentage of Orthomyxoviridae reads from all 17 H1N1 samples or BC-22 alone comprised only 7.6% or 2.6% of the corresponding unaligned reads. de novo assembled contigs mapping to 2009 H1N1 influenza derived from all 17 pooled samples (dark red) or sample BC-1422 alone (pink) a group previously reported at high risk for severe complications from H1N1 infection [34]. the method for DNase treatment, found to greatly impact the deep sequencing results, is also shown. Virochip identification of 2009 H1N1 was designed prior to the emergence of pandemic 2009 H1N1. the average normalized microarray intensities for the 2009 H1N1 samples were more pronounced with H1N1 probes derived from swine influenza (A/swine/Wisconsin/464/98) than with probes derived from human influenza (A/human/Puerto Rico/8/34); the difference was statistically significant for 13 of 17 samples by t-test analysis. samples (y-axis) and probes on the Virochip are clustered using hierarchical clustering. asterisks denote samples for which the difference in probe intensity is significant by t-test analysis (p0.05). 85% of reads from sample BC-59 aligned to bacterial sequences. reads aligned to human rRNA (dark green), human mitochondrial genomic DNA (medium green), other human genomic DNA/transcriptomic RNA (light green) and the non-redundant nucleotide database. in the upper respiratory tract microbiome were present in samples from patients infected with H1N1 virus. all bacterial reads aligned to rRNA sequences, likely due to the high relative abundance of rRNA transcripts in bacteria. a high level of diversity of bacterial families was observed in different samples. the identities of the top-ranking, second-ranking, and third-ranking bacterial family are shown. the majority of viral reads aligned to members of the Orthomyxoviridae (influenza) family (Table 1). Phages comprised the second most common group of viruses, including known controls (e.g. MS2 control phages), trace reagent contaminants (e.g. bacteriophage M13) % FLU (VIRAL READS) PHAGE MLV OTHER VIRAL Ont-61 574,838 2,649 2,649 0.46% 100% - - - - Ont-69 25,500 2,243 2,243 8.8% 100% - - - Ont-84 947,111 884 884 0.091% 100% - - - Ont-MT1 578,886 18,079 18,079 3.1% 100% - - - influenza reads aligning to orthomyxoviridae were found in all specimens. the percentage of total reads aligning to influenza was linearly correlated with calculated viral titers by real-time quantitative RT-PCR for sites in the united states and Canada. correlation between percentage of deep sequencing reads aligning to 2009 H1N1 and viral titer. for each sample, the percentage of deep sequencing reads aligning to 2009 H1N1 is plotted as a function of the calculated viral titer per mL of nasal swab sample. deep sequencing reads from the two samples in the study with the highest coverage of the 2009 H1N1 genome, BC-22 (97.1% coverage at 1X) and Cal-UC2 (92.6% coverage at 1X) were mapped to their full-genome scaffolds obtained by Sanger sequencing. the genome segment with the most amino acid changes was the HA gene (27 of 69 nucleotide differences, or 39.1%) genes associated with immunity and interferon were significantly up-regulated (p0.05) in four of the 12 influenza samples compared to the control samples. genes associated with immunity and interferon were significantly up-regulated (p0.05) in four of the 12 influenza samples. genes associated with cell structure, motility and protein metabolism were also upregulated in 2009 H1N1 samples relative to control samples. overexpressed genes in 2009 H1N1 samples relative to control samples were categorized using the PANTHER database. de novo assembly of 90.3% of the genome was possible. no misassemblies were observed even though the percentage of Orthomyxoviridae reads from all 17 H1N1 samples or BC-22 alone comprised only 7.6% or 2.6% of the corresponding unaligned reads. the Virochip microarray was capable of differentiating seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza from the novel 2009 pandemic strain. complementary deep sequencing of 17 clinical samples collected early in the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic enabled detection of reads to the novel strain in every sample. rRNA sequences corresponding to related bacteria were found to be 100% identical over a 60-bp range. a key advantage of Illumina sequencing is the significant increase in read depth (100-fold) relative to pyrosequencing. the greater depth of sequencing provides better and more accurate genome coverage. deep sequencing is able to generate much more useful information including data on the microbiome and host gene expression as well as whole-genome sequencing of pathogens. unbiased deep sequencing allows broad-based detection of novel viruses that may elude diagnosis by specific RT-PCR assays. paired-end read lengths achievable on the Illumina platform now approaching 300 bp. co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae may impact the severity of the clinical presentation in patients infected with 2009 H1N1 [44]. a small number of reads from adenovirus type 4 (n = 26) imply that co-pathogens did not play a significant role in infection by 2009 H1N1 influenza. one sample contained a paired-end read of 97 nt that was a 98% match to the filovirus Ebola-Sudan. the origin of this sequence ultimately remains unknown, as we could not subsequently detect it in any sample or reagent by specific RT-PCR. transcriptome reads showed immunity and interferon genes were significantly up-regulated in 4 nasopharyngeal swab samples from 2009 H1N1-infected patients. nasopharyngeal swab samples did not necessarily have a high number of transcriptome reads, but did have the highest 1X coverage of the influenza genome. sequence reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 were detectable in all 17 samples, even in those with very low viral titers approaching the analytical limits of detection. more studies are clearly needed on the metagenomics of different viral agents (e.g. RNA vs. DNA viruses; lysogenic vs. lytic, etc.) across different stages of infection. cases in California were enrolled in a viral diagnostics study approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) institutional review board (IRB) for all cases, collected samples were analyzed under protocols approved by the UCSF IRB (Protocol #H9187-32565) sample identification and collection Cases of influenza-like illness in Canada and Mexico were reported by providers and hospitals to the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. microarray slides were custom-designed 815k or 860k arrays synthesized by Agilent Technologies. each containing 11,956 Virochip 70-mer oligonucleotide probes in common. nucleic acid was extracted with the Zymo Viral RNA kit. array intensities were analyzed using a two-sample, two-tailed t-test. PCR and Sanger sequencing Sequences corresponding to each influenza segment were obtained by one-step RT-PCR using either a Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or an Invitrogen SuperScriptIII One-Step RT-PCR kit. the PCR was performed using a Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in a 12.5 l reaction containing 3.25 l H2O, 2.5 l 5X PCR buffer, 2.5 l Q solution, 0.5 l dNTP, 0.5 l RT/Taq enzyme mix, 0.75 l of each primer, 0.25 l SYBR Green and 1.5 l total RNA. conditions for libraries were size-selected on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at approximately 350 bp average length. reads were sequenced for 67 cycles in each direction. deep sequencing analysis Fluorescent images were analyzed using the Illumina base-calling pipeline 1.5.0 to obtain paired-end sequencing data. the presence of murine leukemia virus and Ebola virus in the deep sequencing libraries was independently confirmed by specific RT-PCR and direct sequencing (data not shown). we also separately performed directed BLASTN alignments of the original set of unclassified deep sequencing reads to an influenza sequence database. all high-quality sequence reads have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession number SRA023755) a minority SNP was defined as present if occurring 25% of the time at a given nucleotide position. a minority SNP was defined as present if occurring 25% of the time at a given nucleotide position. initial generated contigs of size 100 bp were further assembled de novo in Geneious at high sensitivity. final assembled contigs were then mapped to full-genome reference sequence A/California/06/2009(H1N1) 90% of the contigs correspond to low-complexity sequence that was identified as such by applying an LZW compression ratio of 0.5. nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in viral transport media from 17 patients with either laboratory-confirmed or suspected cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus were analyzed. RNA extractions were performed differently using established protocols specific to individual laboratories. d samples were normalized to 10 pmol of incorporated dye and hybridized overnight using the Agilent Gene Expression Hybridization kit. the microarray slides were custom-designed 815k or 860k arrays synthesized by Agilent Technologies, each containing 11,956 Virochip 70-mer oligonucleotide probes in common. these probes include conserved as well as specific probes representing all viral species in GenBank. PCR products were run on a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Sanger sequenced (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Hayward, CA) with M13F and M13R primers and the original conserved PCR primers. at least three-fold redundancy was obtained for each segment. RT/Taq enzyme mix, 0.75 l of each primer, 0.25 l SYBR Green and 1.5 l total RNA. conditions for the PCR were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min. 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 7 min. sequence reads that aligned to human rRNA and mitochondrial genome by BLASTN (word size = 11, E-value = 11010) were initially removed. remaining reads were then classified by successive BLASTN alignments to the RefSeq human transcriptome database. reads that aligned to NT but that did not align to human, bacterial, or viral sequences were categorized as \u201cother\u201d. transcriptomic analysis of samples from 11 patients with KLS (KLS samples) by deep sequencing found only 24 reads to a single rhinovirus A isolate in one sample and no reads to influenza in any sample. all KLS samples were negative for both pandemic and seasonal influenza by specific RT-PCR. the transcriptomic analysis was performed as follows. a minority SNP was defined as present if occurring 25% of the time at a given nucleotide position. initial generated contigs of size 100 bp were further assembled de novo in Geneious at high sensitivity with \u201cfine tuning\u201d of gaps and 3-nt trimming of contig ends. the coverage is plotted on a log scale as a function of nucleotide position. the nucleotide position is based on the A/California/04/2009 reference genome."}
