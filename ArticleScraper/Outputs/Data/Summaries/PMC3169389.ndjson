{"summary": "structure-based drug design has played an increasingly important role in drug development. the first group, the Structural Genomics of pathogenic protozoa Consortium (SGPP; http://www.sgpp.org/) solved 70 structures of proteins from pathogenic protozoa. the VISP Center (http://visp.scripps.edu/default.aspx) solves protein structures from SARS-CoV, influenza, herpesviruses and flaviviruses. the biological community has nominated a number of microbial targets for structure solution by the protein structure initiative (PSI) network. SSGCID: the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease The SSGCID consortium consists of team members from four institutions in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. the consortium is advised by an external panel of experts, and a Target Selection Board reviews targets selected by the con\u00adsortium itself prior to submission to NIAID. a total of 7564 targets from 65 species within 24 genera have been validated and approved for the SSGCID pipeline. target selection at SSGCID includes rescue attempts for failed targets by selecting orthologues or paralogues in other species within the NIAID-approved genera. a bioinformatic approach uses a statistical classification algorithm to identify proteins predicted to be associated with virulence and/or pathogenesis. a different approach was adopted for target selection in these genera. SSGCID has expanded beyond proteins to include a small number. noncanonical macromolecular com\u00adplexes represent ground-breaking efforts to expand the range of biological targets amenable to drug targeting. most targets entering the SSGCID pipeline are cloned into the bacterial expression vector (pAVA0421) by PCR amplification from genomic DNA or cDNA (Tier 1). every unique macromolecular structure solved by the SSGCID is bioinformatically processed in an attempt to find putative cofactors, inhibitors or other ligands. this process employs biochemical searches for enzyme-reaction substrates and cofactors by mining databases that contain ligand or potential inhibitor interactions. the SSGCID has cloned a total of 4178 targets. of these, 2376 have expressed soluble protein and 1483 have been prepared to high purity from cell extracts. the overall structure-determination success rate for the 3383 bacterial, 758 eukaryotic and 37 viral targets cloned by SSGCID currently stands at 6%. crystallization and diffraction rates from eukaryotic proteins are lower (44% and 43%, respectively) than those from prokaryotes (51% and 51%, respectively) but once high-quality diffraction data have been obtained the rates of structure solution are similar for both kingdoms. es 30 47 93 69 44 75 11 Filoviridae 5 20 0 0 0 Orthomyxoviridae 25 52 100 69 44 75 12 Other viruses 7 43 67 50 100 100 14 Total 4178 57 62 50 50 66 6 The success rate for Burkholderia is artificially low, since purification of a large number of soluble targets has not been completed. initial target selections were made by identifying homologues to potential drug targets in a single \u2018representative\u2019 species/strain from each genus based on similarity to targets in the DrugBank database. additional details covering the initial target-selection approaches, including the bioinformatic filters used, have been described previously. interaction with collaborative researchers continues to influence the SSGCID pipeline, leading to the selection of entire biological pathways that appear to be essential in one or more pathogenic organisms. SSGCID has expanded beyond proteins to include a small number of noncoding RNA molecules for structure determination. a relatively small percentage of target plasmids come directly from collaborators (Tier 0) or are cloned using gene synthesis (Tier 3). multiple rescue pathways (Tiers 2\u20139) allow increased success in either expression or purification with any target. ID annually selects a small number of high-impact targets for a complete library screen. this library now contains over 2000 metabolites, their bioisosteres and other small molecules designed to mimic compounds found within the natural metabolome. RNA targets enter Tier 16 and protein complexes enter Tier 17. 240 different targets have led to complete solution-state structure determination. the overall structure-determination success rate for the 3383 bacterial, 758 eukaryotic and 37 viral targets cloned by SSGCID currently stands at 6%, but the success rate varies considerably (from 1 to 18%) between genera. the success rate for Burkholderia is artificially low, since purification of a large number of soluble targets has not yet been completed. the most important mandate for the SSGCID is to provide three-dimensional protein structure-determination services to the scientific community at no charge. 2161 community requests have been received from 98 groups. 1384 have been approved and 1078 have entered into the SSGCID pipeline. 511 of the requests were received during the preparation of this manuscript. SSGCID works closely with members of the scientific community to publish protein structural data produced by the consortium. more than 1400 proteins (purified as single final peaks by size-exclusion chromatography in 10\u2013150 mg quantities) produced by SSGCID can be ordered online through the SSGCID Protein Sample Distrbution System (SSGCID-PSDS) 2161 community requests have been received from 98 groups. 1384 have been approved and 1078 have entered into the SSGCID pipeline. 511 of the requests were received during the preparation of this manuscript. 7% of all entries for Brucella (42), 68% of all entries for Bartonella (22) and 61% of all entries for Coccidioides (eight) SSGCID has submitted over 300 structures to the PDB from proteins encoded by bacteria, parasites and viruses. SSGCID and CSGID will submit over 1000 structures from infectious disease drug targets to the PDB by the end of the five-year contract period (late 2012) for many organisms this represents the vast majority of protein structures available. SSGCID is committed to engaging the infectious disease research community in collaborations to maximize the potential for exploitation of the recent advances in structural genomics. zekii, chaffeensis and eukaryotic pathogens represent one of very few protein structures available for the organism in the PDB. these communications compare the apo structure of a protein with one or more ligand-bound complexes, including those produced through fragment screening."}
