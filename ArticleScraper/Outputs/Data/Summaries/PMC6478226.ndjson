{"summary": "the patient had a history of visiting the Middle East and was suspected of MERS-CoV infection. he was transferred to a hospital with a national isolation ward. nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab, and sputum samples were positive for upE and orf1a genes. PCR to generate products of 600\u20131,100 bp covering the entire S gene and the full-length genome. we used an ABI 3730 Analyzer (http://www.thermofisher.com) to align the S gene sequences of the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of 157 S sequences was performed using MEGA7 (https://www.megasoftware.net) the taxonomic positions of circulating strains from the outbreak in south Korea and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, are indicated. a human MERS-CoV strain was isolated in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2017. the virus was located in a lineage of locally endemic 2016 and 2017 strains. KR011266_KSA_Hu/Riyadh-KSA-2049/2015 C (V) KR011263_KSA_Hu/Riyadh-KSA-2345/2015 C (V) KR011265_KSA_Hu/Riyadh-KSA-2466/2015 C (V) KT026453_KSA_Hu/Riyadh-KSA-2959/2015 C (V MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; NTD, N-terminal domain; RBD, receptor-binding domain. 157 strains isolated in 27 countries including south Korea showed highest identity. the strains involved in the outbreak in south Korea in 2015 had 12 nt substitutions (NTD, 1 site; RBD, 2 or 3 sites), implying that the imported case in 2018 involved a different virus. we could not compare the genetic relationships between the strain we isolated and MERS-CoV strains in the Middle East (12)."}
