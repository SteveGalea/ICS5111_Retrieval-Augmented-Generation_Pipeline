{"summary": "the flavivirus that causes dengue fever infects up to 100 million people each year, leading to death in 2.5% of cases 3, 4. other viral outbreaks including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV), affect far fewer people. small molecules have several advantages over other therapeutic approaches including the ability to be produced at a large scale and stability necessary for broad distribution. small molecules have several advantages over other therapeutic approaches including the ability to be produced at a large scale and stability necessary for broad distribution. four compounds for other diseases (non-antivirals) resulting from two high throughput screens against the Ebola virus 14, 15 and closely matched the receptor-ligand pharmacophores for the Ebola Viral protein 35 (VP35) 10. VP35 helps the virus evade the immune response by blocking activation of interferon regulatory factor 3. favipiravir is undergoing phase 3 clinical trials in the us for influenza. it has shown promising efficacy against the Ebola virus in mice 20. at least one Ebola patient, who has since recovered, was given favipiravir 21. a novel nucleoside analog, BCX4430 demonstrated efficacy in mice and non-human primates against the Ebola virus 25. this compound targets viral RNA polymerase activity by inducing early termination of transcription and thus blocking replication. this compound targets other members of the Filovirus family as well as 8 other RNA virus families. rhodanine compound LJ-001 was found to be active against numerous enveloped viruses and was found through a screen of inhibitors of Nipah virus entry (IC 50 1M) 31. in vivo a steady state plasma concentration could not be maintained at a therapeutic level. activity against the Ebola virus is statistically significant p 0.0001 using the t-test and ANOVA. note data are skewed by SARA-133. large-scale collaborations have promoted selective sharing of related data in a secure environment between collaborators using the CDD Vault 32. the centralized availability of publicly available data on compounds screened for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis enables researchers to leverage the existing literature alongside their private data. this knowledge can be used for building validated computational models that can help in selecting additional compounds or lead optimization 33, 34. the IUPAC name is universally used in naming chemical compounds in patents and software exists for going from IUPAC name to chemical structure. a comprehensive database could be created and used for collaborations. 55 molecules with predicted properties and scores from an experienced medicinal chemist. all of these compounds have a common tertiary amine feature. but they are all orally bioavailable and generally safe for humans. favipiravir is undergoing phase 3 clinical trials in the us for influenza. a number of other compounds have been identified as active against the Ebola virus. this compound is a pro-drug that is converted into the active antiviral, cidofovir diphosphate. this compound targets viral RNA polymerase activity by inducing early termination of transcription and thus blocking replication. only 16 out of 55 compounds were selected as desirable in this analysis with no potential problems based on medicinal chemistry experience. we applied computational filters such as pan Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) to identify potentially problematic compounds from structures 28, 29. significant differences were noted in logP and Lipinski Rule of 5 violations. one molecule SARA-133 skewed the data with a molecular weight over 3000. removal leads to significant differences for molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors, heavy atom count and polar surface area. research described for small molecule inhibitors against the Ebola virus has occurred in a disconnected manner. funding from the european commission has enabled the TB Drug Accelerator and the More Medicines For Tuberculosis as large-scale collaborations between academia, research institutes and industry. identifying compounds by name or company code number does not per se allow direct access to chemical structure. identifying compounds by name or company code number does not per se allow direct access to chemical structure. IUPAC name is universally used in naming chemical compounds in patents. there are already drugs on the shelf that can be potentially repurposed in a shorter time period and at a lower cost. there are at least 16 molecules which in the opinion of an experienced medicinal chemist are possibilities for further optimization."}
