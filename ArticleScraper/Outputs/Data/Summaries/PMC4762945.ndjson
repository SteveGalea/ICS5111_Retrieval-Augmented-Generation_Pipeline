{"summary": "filovirus infection can cause a life threatening hemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola virus disease, EVD) in non-human primates and humans, with case-fatality rates of up to 90%. before 2013, filovirus outbreaks in human populations were restricted to remote areas in central africa and were associated with less than 500 cases. bats are considered a natural reservoir for filoviruses from which these viruses might be transmitted to humans either directly or via intermediate hosts. role of bats as a natural reservoir for filoviruses is supported by the detection of filoviruses in multiple, geographically dispersed bat species. the receptor binding domain (RBD) and a mucin-like domain (MLD) are found in all filovirus GPs. processing of EBOV-GP by these enzymes is dispensable for robust viral spread in cell culture and in the host. GP and EBOV-GP mutants lacking the mucin-like domain and furin cleavage site. FP = internal fusion peptide; HR1/2 = heptad repeat 1/2; TD = transmembrane domain. data on the bat distribution obtained from www.iucnredlist.org. filovirus GP-driven entry into human, NHP and bat cell lines. the latter were generated from bat species believed to constitute the natural reservoir of filoviruses. but the efficiency with which the glycoproteins of certain filovirus species interact with host cell factors during the entry process might differ. all cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were detached by either resuspension in fresh culture medium (HEK-293T cells) or the use of trypsin/EDTA (PAA Laboratories; Vero, BHK-21, and bat cells) expression plasmids (pCAGGS-based) for marburg virus (MARV, strain Musoke; DQ217792.1) and Lloviu virus (LLOV; JF828358.1) were provided by S. Becker (Philipps-University Marburg, Marburg/Germany) and A. Takada (Hokkaido University Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Sapporo/Japan) all GP sequences were first aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method. the vector contains two separate open reading frames coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase (fLuc), VSV*G-fLuc [39, 42, 52] 100\u20131,000x stock solutions of mannan, ammonium chloride, camostat mesylate and U18666A were prepared in water. bafilomycin A1, tetrandrine, E-64d and MDL28170 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for convenient use, all compounds were diluted in culture medium to yield their respective working concentrations. calpain 50 M [35] MDL28170 Inhibitor of cathepsins B and L, and calpain 50 M [35] MDL28170 Inhibitor of calpain and cathepsin B 50 M [65] Camostat mesylate Serine protease inhibitor 100 M [66\u201368] U18666A Induces cholesterol accumulation in endosomes 20 M [37, 69] Transduction of cell lines ase Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. the cell lysate was transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96well plate. fLuc activity is either given in counts per second or displayed as x-fold change normalized against a control. a baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK-21; DSMZ No. ACC-61) was solely used for the production of rhabdoviral pseudotypes. the fruit bat cell lines were a kind gift of C. Drosten and M. A. M\u00fcller (University of Bonn, Bonn/Germany) expression plasmids for marburg virus (MARV, strain Musoke; DQ217792.1) and Lloviu virus (LLOV; JF828358.1) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector. details on the cloning strategy (e.g. restriction sites and primer sequences) are available upon request. phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the aa sequences of the filovirus GPs that were subject of this study. all GP sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm before a phylogenetic tree was constructed. the vector contains two separate open reading frames coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase (fLuc), VSV*G-fLuc. the cells received fresh culture medium and were further incubated for 16\u201320 h. aliquots were stored at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 7 days. for convenient use, 100\u20131,000x stock solutions of mannan, ammonium chloride, camostat mesylate and tetrandrine were prepared in water. the cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) at 24 h post seeding, the cell culture medium was removed and the cells were again washed with PBS. either undiluted or infectivity-normalized VSVpp were added and the cells were further incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. fLuc activity was quantified in HEK-293T cells and the VSVpp were diluted in cell culture medium to yield comparable luciferase activity. the cell culture supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. the measurement was carried out in a microplate reader, plate CHAMELEON (Hidex) two representatives for the Zaire ebolavirus species, EBOV-GP obtained during the EVD outbreak of 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. we chose cell lines established from the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus; RoNi/7), the hammer-headed flying fox (Hypsignathus monstrosus; HypNi/1.1), the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon hel we inoculated human (HEK-293T), non-human primate (Vero) and four fruit bat cell lines with VSVpp harboring filovirus GPs or VSV-G as control. first, we normalized the VSVpp for comparable transduction of HEK-293T cells and then used the particles for transduction of primate and bat cell lines. the efficiency of entry mediated by the EBOV2014-GP was notably lower (80%) than for the EB the GPs of filovirus species differ widely in their ability to transduce target cells of certain reservoir species. EBOV- and BDBV-GP are capable of mediating entry into fruit bat cells. furin cleavage motif and MLV dispensable for GP-mediated transduction of human, primate and fruit bat cells. EBOV1976-GP(Cleav) cannot be cleaved by furin while EBOV1976-GP(MLD) does not. the activity of firefly luciferase in cell lysates was quantified as an indicator for transduction efficiency. transduction mediated by the tested GPs is shown relative to transduction mediated by wt EBOV1976-GP, which was set as 1. ase activity (ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1), cysteine proteases (E-64d; MDL28170), serine proteases (camostat mesylate), two-pore channels (tetrandrine) and NPC1 (U18666A, a compound that was recently shown to directly bind to NPC1 [61]. mannan and camostat mesylate had no appreciable inhibitory effect. glycoprotein-mediated entry into human and fruit bat cells relies on the same host cell factors. equal volumes of vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes (VSVpp) harboring the indicated glycoproteins were used to inoculate human (HEK-293T) and fruit bat cells. rhabdoviral pseudotypes were employed that were decorated with GPs representative of all filovirus species. we included two representatives for the Zaire ebolavirus species, EBOV-GP obtained during the EVD outbreak of 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire; EBOV1976-GP) and the GP of an isolate circulating in West Africa in 2014. four fruit bat species range from concentrated habitats at the southern coast of west africa (Epomops buettikoferi) to nearly complete coverage of the area between Sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa. we inoculated human (HEK-293T), non-human primate (Vero) and four fruit bat cell lines with VSVpp harboring filovirus GPs or VSV-G. RESTV- and MARV-GP-bearing VSVpp showed intermediate transduction efficiency. undiluted VSVpp were used for inoculation of EidNi/41 cells. GPs of filovirus species differ widely in their ability to transduce target cells. furin cleavage and mucin-like domain dispensable for EBOV-GP-driven transduction of fruit bat cells. furin cleavage site and MLD are dispensable for entry into humans cells. EBOV-GP mutants facilitated entry into human, primate and fruit bat cells. OV1976-GP(Cleav) cannot be cleaved by furin while EBOV1976-GP(MLD) does not contain the mucin-like domain. the activity of virus-encoded firefly luciferase in cell lysates was quantified as an indicator for transduction efficiency. ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, tetrandrine and u18666A inhibited entry. mannan and camostat mesylate had no appreciable inhibitory effect. mannan and camostat mesylate also had no inhibitory effect. glycoprotein-mediated entry into human and fruit bat cells relies on the same host cell factors. vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes (VSVpp) harboring the indicated glycoproteins were used to inoculate human and fruit bat cells. filovirus GPs of all filovirus species are able to mediate entry into bat cells but differ in their efficacy. GP processing by the host protease furin and presence of the MLD were dispensable for efficient entry into bat cells. cells from the Hammer-headed fruit bat (HypNi/1.1) and the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus, RoNi/7) showed a reduced susceptibility for TAFV-GP- and BDBV-GP-driven pseudotype entry. the results obtained for transduction of RoNi/7, HypNi/1.1 and EpoNi/22.1 are in keeping with and expand previous studies. cynomolgus macaques experimentally infected with the Makona strain of EBOV (i.e. EBOV2014) showed delayed disease progression compared to animals inoculated with EBOV1976 [74] this observation is in line with the finding that cynomolgus macaques showed delayed disease progression compared to animals inoculated with EBOV1976 [74] ases is conserved requires further investigation. we employed inhibitors of cellular factors or processes known to be required for filovirus GP-driven entry into human and fruit bat cells. we observed a profound decrease in GP-mediated transduction when endosomal acidification. ylate did not inhibit filovirus GP-driven entry into any of the cell lines tested. mannan was previously shown to block GP-driven entry by DC-SIGN and other mannose-binding lectins [62, 75], which are endogenously expressed on a subset of primary filovirus target cells."}
