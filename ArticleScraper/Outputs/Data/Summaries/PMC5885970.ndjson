{"summary": "a refugee camp in Cox experienced a large-scale diphtheria epidemic in 2017. the background information of previously immune fraction among refugees cannot be explicitly estimated. a renewal process model was devised to estimate the R0 and ascertainment rate of cases. multiple diphtheria outbreaks were reported in refugee camps, including those in Yemen and Bangladesh. as of December 26, 2017, the cumulative number of 2,526 cases and 27 deaths were reported. a refugee camp in Bangladesh experienced a large-scale diphtheria epidemic. the latest epidemic curve was extracted from the report of the world health organization (WHO), 2017a. as of December 26, 2017, a total of 2,526 cases have been reported. cases consist of (i) confirmed cases: cases reported as positive for C. diphtheriae by multiplex assay. the data from December 23\u201326 was discarded as the number of cases may be influenced by emergency vaccination. the vertical axis represents the total of confirmed, probable and suspected cases. by December 11, 2017, the count represents suspected cases. st represents the fraction of susceptible individuals on day t. st is written as s t = 1 y = 1 t 1 c y y N. the population size of epidemic area within Rohingya refugee camp as 579,384 persons. we assume that ct follows a Poisson distribution. the likelihood to estimate consisting of the parameters R0, and t is derived as L ( ; c T ) = t = 1 T ( E ( c t ) c t exp ( E ( c t ) cT = (c1, c2,..., cT ). the health survey of Rohingya population indicated that overall 30.8% of children had received no vaccinations. the remaining 69.2% receives at least a single immunization. so, vaccination coverage for diphtheria should be near the mid-point of the range from 0.0 to 0.7. mass child vaccination started on December 12 and according to the administrative coverage, greater than 90% vaccination coverage was achieved by December 30. Vaccine-induced immunity requires at least 7\u201314 days to become effective, and moreover, the reporting delay was assumed to be about four days. for these reasons, the dataset from December 23\u201326 was discarded as the number of cases may be influenced by emergency vaccination. serial interval was eight days, and we imposed an assumption that the coefficient of variation (CV) of the distribution was 50%, and later varied it from 25% to 75% as part of the sensitivity analysis. the renewal process can capture the serial stochastic dependence structure (Nishiura, 2010) let it be the number of new cases on day t. g represents the distribution of the serial interval. st is written as s t = 1 y = 1 t 1 c y y y N. st decreases when natural infection takes place. in the present study, was estimated through uncertainty analysis, while t was estimated as a step function governed by two parameters, a1 and a2. t was estimated as a step function governed by two parameters, a1 and a2. 950 samples (95%) of R0 (or what it can be assumed as the 95% tolerance intervals) were in the range of 5.0\u201312.3. a1 ranged from 0.007 to 0.021 with the median 0.010, while a2 ranged from 0.003 to 0.011 with the median 0.005. the predicted epidemic curve overall captured the observed pattern. bars constituting the epidemic curve show the observed data. we varied the CV of the serial interval distribution from 25% to 75%. uncertainty analysis of R0 was conducted with an input parameter assumption for employing the LHS method. the current study is the first to statistically estimate R0 of diphtheria from epidemic data. the estimated small ascertainment rate during the epidemic is considered as reflecting the time-dependent diagnostic practice at a local level. the small ascertainment rate can lead us to observing the low case fatality risk of diphtheria in the Cox\u2019s Bazar that has been estimated to be small. a follow-up study should be conducted in the future. no heterogeneous patterns of transmission, including contact patterns and age-dependency were taken into account due to shortage of information. the time-dependent heterogeneity, including reduced transmission potential due to contact tracing and rapid hospitalization, was not explicitly taken into account.
