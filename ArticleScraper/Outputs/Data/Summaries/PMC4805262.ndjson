{"summary": "a rapid method was developed to process large volumes of stool for downstream testing by the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) TB-detection assay. the method was tested on stool samples spiked with known numbers of M. tuberculosis colony forming units (CFU) and stools from M. tuberculosis-infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) over half a million new cases of childhood tuberculosis occur every year. TB accounts for 10\u201315% of the TB cases worldwide. TB can progress very rapidly in children because of their immature immune system. the Xpert assay detected TB with a sensitivity of 25\u201369% and a specificity of 91.7\u2013100%. in previous TB detection studies performed on stool, the Xpert assay detected MTB with a sensitivity of 25\u201369% and a specificity of 91.7\u2013100%. sensitivity could be increased if methods were available for testing larger quantities of stool without introducing PCR inhibitors. pre-quantified frozen MTB and BCG cell stocks were sonicated or vortexed vigorously for 1 to 2 min before making serial dilutions in Middlebrook 7H9 media (BD) for analytic spiking studies, stools were obtained from human subjects not suspected of having TB. one-gram of human TB negative stool was spiked with five different concentrations of M. bovis BCG (10, 100, 103, 104 and 105 CFU/g) TB negative stool by itself was used as negative control as concentration zero in both experiments. the LOD was defined as the lowest CFU concentration that produced 100% positive results. participants excluded if they had been on more than five days of empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment in the past 6 months, if parental informed consent was unattainable, or if child assent for participants 6 to 14 years of age was unattainable. participants were not followed up after recruitment and sample collection. 5 0.11 On TB treatment 7 1 0.04 Cough >2weeks 18 5 0.0001 Other constitutional symptoms 20 5 0.00001 Malnutrition weight-for-height -2 z-score 7 4 0.48 Positive TB trace contact 14 2 0.0003 Definite TB3 4 0 0.1 Possible TB3 0 0 NA * 2-tailed Fisher Exact probability values 1 TB cases were defined as TB suspects with either a gastric lavage or an induced participants without written consent were excluded from the study. the non-human primate stool samples were obtained from animals being investigated for another purpose under IACUC protocol assurance number A3187-01. the stool samples were obtained only after they had been removed from the animal cages and were slated to be discarded. specificity was defined as the percent results with a positive stool result against the GeneXpert induced sputum or gastric aspirate positive cases. two-tailed Fisher exact probability test was used to compare the TB cases to TB controls using the online calculator. processing buffer (SPB), containing AL buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10% Polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were added to the mixture. final stool and buffer combination was mixed by snap vortexing (for 10 seconds), incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then passed through a syringe filter. samples were taken from two groups: TB cases, who were children confirmed to have TB by a positive Xpert MTB/RIF on induced sputum or gastric lavage. TB-negative controls were sourced from primary health care clinics or hospitals. participants excluded if they had been on more than five days of empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment in the past 6 months. TB cases were defined as TB suspects with either a gastric lavage or an induced sputum positive for M. tuberculosis by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. 2 TB controls were defined as TB suspects with either a gastric lavage or an induced sputum positive for M. tuberculosis. laboratory testing was performed under a sterile hood in a biosafety laboratory 3 (BSL3) according to standard operating procedures described in Fig 1. Ethics statements This study was approved by university of medicine and dentistry of new Jersey. participants without written consent were excluded from the study and all the documents are saved on investigators computers. the monkeys were housed at the University of Pittsburgh Regional Biocontainment Center. at the time of collection, none of the monkeys were on treatment. Xpert assay\u2019s internal control (IC) indicated PCR inhibition [33]. sample processing pressures measured by the GeneXpert instrument were not significantly affected by an increase in stool quantity (P>0.01). minimum rpoB Cts decreased to 29.81.8 with 1g samples compared to 324.4 and 353.4 for 0.5g and 0.2g samples. macaque stool samples weighing 0.2g, 0.6g or 1g were tested in triplicate following the protocol in Fig 1. a single stool sample was tested for each macaque, 1/6 (17%) of the 0.2g, 4/9 (4%) of the 0.6g, and 0/6 (0%) of the 1.0g stool samples were positive for TB. test performance on human clinical samples Twenty TB cases and 20 TB-negative control participants were enrolled in the clinical study. most TB cases and controls fit the definitions proposed by international clinical case definition for intrathoracic M. tuberculosis [29] of \u2018probable TB\u2019. tests performed on 0.6g samples detected TB in 6/7 (85.7%) participants who met our case definition by a positive gastric aspirate. assay was positive on tests of both 0.6g and 1.2g stool samples in 4/4 (100%) of participants who were culture positive for MTB in sputum (three participants) or gastric aspirate (one participant). sputum and 1 gastric lavage were rifampin sensitive on phenotypic testing. these four TB cases were also found to have rifampin susceptible MTB in the stool assay. assay performance did not appear to be affected by stool color and consistency. a. M. bovis BCG was spiked at 103 CFU/ml into 0.2, 0.5 and 1 g of stool (N = 4) the number in parenthesis indicates number of macaques tested at each volume. all the uninfected controls tested (N = 5) were negative by this method. 2/6 (33%) of 1.0g stool samples were positive for TB. no difference in percent positive rate between the two different macaques. macaque stool is more pellet in form than the semi-solid consistency observed in human stool. Xpert stool testing of 0.6g and 1.2g volume from Xpert induced sputum (IS) and gastric washing (GW) results was performed on above recruited participants. repeat testing was performed on a limited stool number of samples that were initially negative. stool assay at 0.6g was positive in 8/11 (72.2%) of HIV positive TB cases, 6/6 (100%) of HIV negative or exposed negative TB cases. the assay was also positive in 6/7 (85.7%) TB cases who were on TB treatment 5 days. stool samples were treated with SPB and SR and passed them through our filter as described in Fig 1. invalids are caused by a delay or an absence of cycle threshold (Ct) from the internal control. QC probe check errors are often due to abnormal signals from the assay components within the Xpert MTB/RIF cartridge. our study is limited by its small sample size. limited facilities made it difficult to confirm by culture the presence of TB in most of our participants who met our case definition of TB positive. previous studies have shown that the Xpert MTB/RIF assay has a high positive predictive value compared to MTB cultures. clinical studies are needed to evaluate the full performance parameters and potential impact of this methodology."}
