{"summary": "secretion of polypeptides by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is an elaborate mechanism enabling the execution of essential processes. however, a unique group of secreted toxins plays a different role in maintaining the fitness of the organism. toxins provide their producer with advantages such as enhanced defense capabilities or pathogenic competence. toxin cleavage may enhance cell-binding and/or translocation, stabilization or catalytic activity of the toxic moiety specifically in protease expressing cells. intoxication occurs only in diseased cells that express an active disease-associated transcription factor that specifically binds to the TRE and activates the transcription machinery (RP: RNA polymerase) the term \u201cimmunotoxin\u201d refers to molecules consisting of a protein toxin linked to a targeting moiety derived from the immune system. but often expanded to include other target-specifying ligands (such as a cytokine) the idea of developing a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d that has a specific attraction to a disease-causing target was originally suggested by Paul Ehrlich over 100 years ago. recombinant DNA techniques were applied in the production of third generation immunotoxins. the first generation immunotoxins were prepared by chemically conjugating antibodies/ligands to intact toxin units or to toxins with attenuated cell binding capability. the first was generally applied when the conjugation site was. in second generation immunotoxins, truncated toxins that lack a cell binding domain were chemically conjugated to a targeting moiety. selected immunotoxins will be classified by their toxic moiety (diphtheria toxin, pseudomonas exotoxin A or RIPs derivatives) and current status of clinical trials.

EF acts as a zinc metalloproteinase that cleaves the N termini of MKK/MEK proteins, blocking their signaling activity. the toxic catalytic polypeptide was a fusion between the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and amino acids 1\u2013254 of LF (LFN) the polypeptide contains the PA binding domain that proved sufficient to achieve translocation of a fused \u201cpassenger\u201d polypeptide to the cytosol of cells in a PA-dependent process. a modified leTx (PA-L1/LF) composed of LF and MMP activated PA protein was tested in mice xenograft models of human tumors. the mutation \u201clocks\u201d the molecule in a constitutively active state, making the cell dependent on the constitutive activation of the ERK pathway for survival. however, specific toxicity toward B-Raf mutant melanoma cells has been observed both in vitro and in xenograft mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play a central role. in vitro studies on endothelial proliferation, invasion, and tube formation showed that activated LeTx acts by impairing microvascular endothelial cell invasion and migration in the absence of endothelial cell death. treatment with PA-L1/LF also delayed tumor growth and improved long-term survival in mice with orthotopically implanted anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) pro-uPA/uPA and plasminogen/plasmin cleaves plasminogen to generate active plasmin in a positive feed-back mechanism. the initial proteolytic event leading to the initiation of plasmin generation on the cell surface is still under study. the presence of this proteolytic system which confers the tumor mass with the ability to degrade ECM proteins is associated with increased tumor tissue invasiveness. anthrax LF binding site spans two adjacent monomers of cleaved PA in the oligomeric prepore. each monomer contains three subsites which play a role in the binding of LF. each monomer contains three subsites which play a role in the binding of LF. intermolecular complementation between the two types of mutated subunits was performed in mice. a mixture containing subsite III mutated PrAg-L1 (PrAg-L1-I210A), subsite II mutated PrAg-U2 (PrAg-U2-R200A) and toxic FP59 chimeric polypeptide showed decreased toxicity. oproteinases (MMPs) are a multigene family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. they are secreted as latent pro-enzymes and have the capacity to degrade components of the extracellular matrix. membrane-type MMPs are integral plasma membrane proteins capable of activating MMPs. receptor-bound PA63 self associate to form a ring-shaped homoheptamer [445] called the prepore, which may then form complexes with up to three molecules of LF and/or EF. resulting complexes are internalized via clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis. this channel/pore is thought to participate in the unfolding of LF and EF. the toxins are secreted as 3 polypeptides: protective antigen (PA; 83 kDa), lethal factor (LF; 90 kDa) and edema factor (EF; 89 kDa) the toxins are secreted as protective antigen (PA; 83 kDa), lethal factor (LF; 90 kDa) and edema factor (EF; 89 kDa) the complex internalized via clathrin-dependent receptor mediated endocytosis. the acidic environment of the endosome induces a conformational change in the prepore. EF acts as a zinc metalloproteinase that cleaves the N termini of MKK/MEK proteins, blocking their signaling activity. the toxic catalytic polypeptide was a fusion between the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and amino acids 1\u2013254 of LF (LFN), which contains the PA binding domain that proved sufficient to achieve translocation of a fused \u201cpassenger\u201d polypeptide to the cytosol of cells in a PA-dependent process [477,478,479]. a modified leTx (PA-L1/LF) composed of LF and MMP activated PA protein was tested in mice xenograft models of human tumors. it showed lower toxicity to mice than wild-type toxin and has a potent anti-tumor activity. this is similar to observed for cells bearing the V600E mutation in B-Raf. in vitro studies on endothelial proliferation, invasion, and tube formation showed that activated LeTx acts by impairing microvascular endothelial cell invasion and migration in the absence of endothelial cell death. treatment with PA-L1/LF also delayed tumor growth and improved long-term survival in mice with orthotopically implanted anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) xenografts. plasmin or kallikrein into uPA cleaves plasminogen to generate active plasmin in a positive feed-back mechanism. the catalytic efficiency of these reactions is increased upon binding of pro-uPA/uPA and plasminogen/plasmin to membranal receptors. the initial proteolytic event leading to the initiation of plasmin generation on the cell surface is still under study. anthrax LF binding site spans two adjacent monomers of cleaved PA in the oligomeric prepore. each monomer contains three subsites which play a role in the binding of LF. each monomer contains three subsites which play a role in the binding of LF. an in vivo toxicity assay in mice was performed by intraperitoneal administration of a mixture containing subsite III mutated PrAg-L1 (PrAg-L1-I210A), subsite II mutated PrAg-U2 (PrAg-U2-R200A) and the toxic FP59 chimeric polypeptide. results showed decreased toxicity in comparison to administration of a mixture of PrAg-L1, PrAg-U a partial list of human disease-associated viruses encoding protease(s) in their genomes include flaviviruses such as: hepatitis C virus (HCV), west Nile virus (WNV), dengue fever virus (DFV) and yellow fever virus (YFV); retroviruses such as HIV-1; picornaviruses such as coxsackievirus, poliovirus and hepatitis A virus. nidovirus in eukaryotes, the N-degron comprises at least two determinants. a destabilizing N-terminal residue and internal lysine/s that function as acceptor site/s. the ubiquitin-protein conjugates as a substrate for proteosomal degradation. the difference in cytotoxicity between the wild-type DT-A fragment and the least stable mutant was only 20-fold in compared to 100-fold difference in intracellular half-life. he suggested previously the construction of a new kind of toxins where a signal that inactivates the toxin can be cleaved off by a viral protease, resulting in selective intoxication of virally infected cells. in vitro and in vivo simulating experiments showed that when constructs were pre-digested with HIV-PR, both stability and cytotoxicity of the chimeric toxins was considerably augmented. the concept of stabilizing a protein through specific proteolytic removal of a degradation signal works in practice. cleavable RIPs behave more like a constitutively active form toward infected cells. cytotoxicity toward uninfected cells was found to be lower than activated mutant. cleavable toxins behave more like a constitutively active form toward infected cells. cleavable toxins behave more like a constitutively active form toward infected cells. destabilizing residues in mammalian cells can be hierarchically divided into three classes. primary (type 1 (Arg, Lys or His) or type 2 (Ile, Leu, Phe, Tyr or oxidized Cys) and secondary (Asp, Glu or oxidized Cys) were assessed in vivo stability and cytotoxicity of diphtheria toxin-based polypeptides. a degradation signal can be cleaved off by a viral protease, resulting in selective intoxication of virally infected cells. Falnes et al designed fusion proteins composed of a FLAG peptide containing an N-terminal phenylalanine (a destabilizing amino acid according to the N-end rule), followed by an HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) cleavage sites that is positioned upstream to a in vitro and in vivo simulating experiments showed that when the constructs were pre-digested with HIV-PR, both stability and cytotoxicity of the chimeric toxins was considerably augmented. however, no selective eradication of HIV infected cells was observed following treatment with non-treated constructs. cleavable toxins behave more like a constitutively active form toward infected cells and in a similar way to a non-activated form toward uninfected cells. cytotoxicity toward uninfected cells was found to be lower than that of the activated mutant. the recent integration of modified plant and bacterial toxins into clinical research and application adds new weapons to the arsenal against these refractory diseases. the most common toxicities in patients treated with immunotoxins are vascular leak syndrome (VLS) and hepatotoxicity, caused by non-specific binding of the toxic or the targeting moiety of the immunotoxin to endothelial and hepatic cells. the issue of immunogenicity is a major challenge distinguishing immunotoxins from small molecule-based therapy. ethylene glycol and immunosuppressive agents have led to different success rates in reducing immunogenicity against non-human components of immunotoxins. ethylene glycol (PEGylation) and immunosuppressive agents (105,107,530,531,532) have led to different success rates in reducing their immunogenicity against non-human components of immunotoxins. based suicide gene therapy is a versatile and dynamic research area with a great application potential. toxin-based therapy is either because of the immunogenicity of the cleavable toxin or the immunogenicity of the viral vecto."}
