{"summary": "study of interactions between the gut bacterial microbiome and virome of rhesus monkeys. depletion of viral populations was confirmed at the species level by real-time PCR. results A majority of bacteria were depleted after treatment with antibiotics. neutrophilic granulocytes (NEUT), lymphocytes (LYMPH), monocytes (MONO#), eosinophils (EO#) and basophilic granulocytes (BASO#) were counted, and the counts were compared between the monkeys that were treated with antibiotics and ones were not. the phylum was represented by own color. the reads number on the family level belong to bacteriophages and the eukaryotic viruses including DNA viruses and RNA viruses. the reads number on the family level belong to bacteriophages and the eukaryotic viruses including DNA viruses and RNA viruses. metabolome detecting by PCA. (A) PCA analysis of GC-MS. (B) PCA analysis of LC-MS."}
