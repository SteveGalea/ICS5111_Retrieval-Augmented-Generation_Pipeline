{"summary": "prevalence of measles has decreased significantly from 593.5/100,000 in 1951 to 0.5/100,000 in 2011 due to increasing vaccination coverage of 95%-99%. most affected population were younger children of 1\u20134 years before 1978. every month county CDC aggregated data submitted through prefecture and provincial CDC to reach the national level. since 2004 after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NNDRS was upgraded to direct reporting through network. for each suspected case, the local CDC is required to carry out an epidemiological investigation. Beijing is capital of china with a total area of 16,808 square kilometers. there were 19.6 million populations, of which 7 million migrants seek work in Beijing out of their province of origin. since 2000, SIAs among migrant children under 7 years old was implemented every year. since 2005, the vaccination schedule was recommended 3-doses vaccine schedule at 8 months, 1.5 and 6 years of age. measles vaccination campaign targeted migrant workers aged 15\u201340 years was implemented every year. the national serological surveillance laboratory network was established in 2001 to provide serological confirmation of measles infection. all cases included in this analysis were confirmed cases including laboratory or clinical confirmed and epidemiological related cases. annual incidence and morbidity (per 100,000 populations) were calculated based on Beijing census data reported by the statistical yearbook of Beijing. the sampling procedure was based on a three-stage protocol. at least 3 prefectures were selected as random or specific survey sites. a number of objects per birth cohort were selected by convenience sampling method. all cases included in this analysis were confirmed cases including laboratory or clinical confirmed and epidemiological related cases. annual incidence and morbidity (per 100,000 populations) were calculated based on Beijing census data reported by the statistical yearbook of Beijing. blood samples were collected from healthy persons with consent. measles sero-epidemiology data from 1973 to 2007 were obtained from Beijing CDC. measles has remained at a relatively low level, less than 2.0/100,000 in most of years. in 1997\u20132004, incidence was between 0.7/100,000 and 6.6/100,000. in 2005\u20132011, incidence rebounded from 6.6/100,000 to 24.5/100,000 in 2011. the measles cases by age groups in 1963\u20131972, 1985\u20131986 and 1997\u20131999 were not recorded in detail. from 1957 to 1962, the most affected age groups were children of 1\u20134 years old, with proportion of 91.0%. from 1973 to 1977, the proportion of measles cases decreased to 59.1% in children of 1\u20134 years, but increased to 40.7% in children of 5\u20139 years. in 1982\u20131985, measles broke out in all districts and the incidence range from 38.3/100,000 to 160.2/100,000. in 1986\u20131996, incidence of all districts remained lower level at 0.1/100,000 to 10.5/100,000. in 2005\u20132010, incidence in all districts increased slightly from 2.1/100,000 to 27.3/100,000. measles incidence and immunization coverage rate in Beijing, 1971\u20132011. from 1973 to 1977, antibody positive rate of measles increased from 73.3% to 95.8%. incidence decreased from 248.7/100,000 to 42.2/100,000. 1,507,956 reported cases and 11,130 deaths of measles were recorded in Beijing over the 60-year period. the overall declining trend was clear, with the annual average incidence decreasing from 593.5/100,000 in 1951 to 0.5/100,000 in 2011 and mortality declining from 48.4/100,000 in 2011 to 0 in 2011. 685.5/100,000 to 14,743.2/100,000 was found in children aged 14 years. in 1987\u20131996, incidence declined continuously in all age groups. three peaks of higher incidence were found in infants of 1 years, children of 5\u20137 years and adults of 20\u201330 years. from 1957 to 1962, the most affected age groups were children of 1\u20134 years old. from 1973 to 1977, the proportion of measles cases decreased to 59.1% in children of 1\u20134 years, but increased to 40.7% in children of 5\u20139 years. affected age groups expand to 10\u201314 years age group with 26.4% and 15 years with 12.0%. seasonality of measles peaks in the reported measles mainly occurred from March to May in 1985\u20132010. it was no clear seasonal trend in 2011 when incidence declined to the lowest level. MV coverage rate of first and second dose increased gradually from 91.2% to 99.9%, while measles incidence remained high level during this period. from 1978 to 1996, antibody positive rate increased from 75.7% to higher 93.6%. incidence declined from highest 146.0/100,000 in 1978 to lowest 0.3/100,000 in 1995. age-specific antibody positive rate increased from 70.6% to 98.0% for 5\u201314 years. surgences may result from low effectiveness of liquid MV from Jing55 strains [19] and an accumulation of susceptible to a critical threshold level. situation of lower immunogenicity and administration of two doses was inadequate for the interruption of measles transmission. increasing vaccination coverage led to declining incidence of measles to historical lowest level in 1995. the average reported measles incidence decreased more in the western than in the central provinces. incidence in the eastern provinces increased from 38.8/100,000 in 1990\u20131999 to 65.0/100,000 in 2000\u20132009. migrant workers aged 15\u201340 years had a strong mobility. infants born to immune mothers received maternal antibodies transferred during the perinatal period and remained protected, on average, until approximately 4\u20136 months of age. however, transferred maternal antibodies that were vaccine-induced rather than naturally acquired following measles infection generally existed at lower mean titers in the mother and infant and waned much earlier, leaving the infant unprotected as early as 1 month of age. a gap remained between the second dose coverage and the 95% goal in 2002\u20132004 while SARS happened in china. the emphasis is on implementing strategy to increase measles vaccine coverage in migrant adults and migrant adults. written informed consent obtained from patient\u2019s guardian/parent/next of kin. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
