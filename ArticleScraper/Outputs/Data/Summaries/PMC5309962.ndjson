{"summary": "avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus (CoV) first isolated in 1937. it causes pathology ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe kidney and oviduct diseases. it has been estimated that IBV infection in a commercial flock with the best possible management practice reduces income by approximately 3% (3). deletion of SARS-CoV E protein reduced pathogenicity and mortality. recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E gene led to increased apoptosis and downregulation of genes related to inflammation in infected cells. development of coV LAVs requires an accurate knowledge of critical residues. inant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV resulted in in vivo attenuation. revertant mutants that regained viral fitness and pathogenicity also regained channel activity. alignment was obtained using Clustal O (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) a similar consensus secondary structure is predicted for E proteins in other CoVs, except alpha-CoVs (TGEV) the TMD of SARS-CoV E has been characterized in lipid membranes (33, 34) and in dodecylphosphatidylcholine (DPC) micelles (35). mutation T16A resulted in decreased Golgi complex disruption (38, 39), proposed to facilitate the efficient trafficking of virions (38\u201342). however, the effects observed for T16A could not be restored by the conservative polar substitutions to Ser, Asn, or Gln (39). however, these effects cannot be unequivocally attributed to loss of IC activity. revertant mutations appear in the IBV E sequence and correlate their locations with structural features of IBV E obtained by solution nuclear magnetic resonance. RESULTS IBV E protein IC activity is not essential for virus replication in cell culture. previous studies on SARS-CoV E showed that two residues in the TMD, asn15 and Val25 are essential for IC activity, viral fitness, and pathogenesis. the growth kinetics of the two mutants was studied with vero cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2, whereby virus titers in both cell lysates and culture supernatants were determined by plaque assay. i.e., levels of IBV positive-sense subgenomic RNA2 were similar for cells infected with WT-rIBV or rA26F mutants. total cellular RNA was harvested from infected cells at indicated times postinfection. IBV positive-sense subgenomic RNA2 (+sgRNA2) levels were quantified by qPCR and normalized to an internal GAPDH control. western blot analysis of viral protein expression in vero cells infected with the WT-rIBV. IBV positive-sense genomic RNA was present at significantly lower levels in the supernatants of cells infected with the rT16A and rA26F mutants. these mutations affect the efficient release of mature virions from infected cells. this suggests that IBV E protein IC activity may play a crucial role in viral release. the rT16A mutant still remained dominant in the population after four passages, but the tendency showed a steady decline in favor of the WT virus. a similar set of competition assays was performed in DF-1 cells, where WT-rIBV outcompeted both IBV mutants in both aspects. these results show that the two mutant viruses were challenged in fitness and release. mutations observed are indicated in passages P5 to P25. regions of IBV E are indicated by color codes: TMD, green; predicted -structure, red; flanking conserved Pro55, yellow circle; inserted sequence, pink; remaining EMD, blue. reversion to native residue (from Ala to Thr) requires only a single nucleotide change, i.e., a transition (GA) mutations K58N, which appeared only transiently in Vero cells, and N11D, were observed. it may be possible that the rescue of viral fitness is due to acquired mutations outside the E gene during serial passage of the recombinant IC-inactive. DF-1 cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated for 24 h, followed by infection with the rT16A mutant for 24 h. western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates, with WT-rIBV-infected cells as a control. trans can be used to recover lost fitness in the rT16A virus. to test if the observed revertant mutations restored the IC activity of the E protein, IBV E proteins carrying these mutations were expressed and purified and studied in a black lipid membrane setup. however, in most cases, the IC activities of the observed revertant mutants were comparable to that of the WT. s, N11D and K58N must be present in the same protein to regain IC activity. the membranes contained DOPC:DOPS:DOPE at a 3:1:1 molar ratio. T16A, L25F, A26F, L26F, T16D, and T16N mutants were IC inactive. most revertant mutations for the rA26F mutant, except F26C in Vero cells, appeared in EMDs. this is clearly in contrast with a similar SARS-CoV E mutant, the V25F mutant, which acquired several mutations that clustered along the helix interface opposite Val25 (32) thus, we tested the effect of these mutations on IBV E oligomerization using blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE arrows point to pentamers and monomers, as in panel A. the same molecular weight markers (M) are used in both panels. one possible explanation for the preservation of the oligomeric form in the A26F mutant is that A26F is not at an interfacial position. we tested the possibility that IBV E has more than one TMD or an unexpected topology. we tested the possibility that IBV E has more than one TMD or an unexpected topology. the two mutations, C44A and C45A, are indicated. backbone resonance assignment could be achieved for most of the protein. however, despite the use of a perdeuterated sample, resonances corresponding to 10 residues in the predicted C-terminal EMD were not observed. in LMPG, the N-terminal -helical stretch formed by H1 to H3 extends until Thr50. this is followed by a helical stretch analogous to H4 in SDS but slightly shorter, from Gly56 to Thr67. H5 is not observed in LMPG and may be unfolded or partially adopt -structure. the amide II is indicated by a star. the small reduction in amide II intensity after D2O exposure is due to N-H to N-D conversion. in a 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC experiment, 26 residues in the first predicted TMD region were found to be resistant to exchange. IBV E in SDS, in the presence of 99% D2O, with H/D exchange-resistant cross-peaks indicated. protection from exchange expressed as a volume ratio of D2O/H2O peaks. peak volumes in H2O are plotted in a logarithmic scale (filled circles) rIBV-E-T16A (rT16A mutant) and rIBV-E-A26F (rA26F mutant) these mutant viruses could be recovered from electroporated Vero cells. their E gene sequences were verified. the effect of these mutations on IBV production was monitored. vero cells were infected at an MOI of 2 with WT-rIBV, rT16A mutant, or rA26F mutant. viral progeny in total cell lysate was titrated at indicated times postinfection. western blot analysis of viral protein expression in vero cells. the culture supernatant was tested for levels of IBV positive-sense genomic RNA and IBV structural proteins. however, no expression could be detected in cells infected with the mutants. this suggests that IBV E protein IC activity may play a crucial role in viral release. rT16A or rA26F mutant viruses (open circles) were performed in vero or DF-1 cells coinfected at a wild type/mutant ratio of 1:9. either the culture supernatant (A) or whole-cell lysates (B) were serially passaged every 24 h four times. the quantification of the relative abundance of each virus was performed by sequencing the IBV E gene within the viral progeny. fected with the rT16A mutant, the E gene acquired mutation A26V after only 5 passages in both types of cells. mutations observed are indicated in passages P5 to P25, where underlined mutations dominate in population over the wild-type residue at the corresponding positions. reversion to native residue (from Ala to Thr) requires only a single nucleotide change. rA26F mutant produced revertants with mutations at extramembrane domains (EMDs) in vero cells, the E gene rapidly acquired mutations K58N and F62S in the insert sequence. only mutations K58N, which appeared only transiently in vero cells, and N11D, were observed. a 3-fold increase in the supernatant IBV titers was observed in this sample compared to that transfected with the pXJ40 vector control alone. DF-1 cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated for 24 h followed by infection with the rT16A mutant for 24 h. transfection with pXJ40-IBVE-T16A/A26V resulted in a CPE comparable to that caused by transfection with wild-type IBV E (pXJ40-IBVE) these experiments demonstrate that the T16A/A26V revertant introduced in trans can be used to recover lost fitness in the rT16A virus. the compensatory mutation A26V made in the E gene of the recombinant IBV was sufficient for this the 100-pS events lasted for tens of seconds, whereas the 800-pS events lasted typically only hundreds of milliseconds. these results clearly suggest that the two compensatory mutations, N11D and K58N, must be present in the same protein to regain IC activity. rSARS-CoV-E-N15A was acquired by the recombinant rSARS-CoV-E-N15A and regained IC activity (32). Neither of these mutants displayed IC activity, supporting the hypothesis that the identity of the polar residue at this position 16 is specific for each CoV E protein. revertant mutations for the rA26F mutant, except F26C in Vero cells, appeared in EMDs. ant mutants observed in DF-1 cells, the A26F/N11D and A26F/K58N mutants, also preserved a WT-like oligomer. results of BN-PAGE electrophoresis of IBV E mutants are shown. arrows point to pentamers and monomers, as in panel A. rA26F-induced conformational change in the IBV E oligomer may be effective either through direct physical contact between the central region of the TMD and EMDs or indirectly through some allosteric mechanism. no structural data are currently available for IBV E. only sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and lyso-myristoylphosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) produced spectra of reasonable quality for structural studies. the two mutations, C44A and C45A, are indicated. residues delimit the only TM -helix (H2) flanked by short -helices N- and C-terminally (H1 and H3) at the C-terminal end, two additional short -helices span Gly56 to Gly69 (H4) and Pro75 to Glu84 (H5) are probably bound to the SDS micelle surface. in LMPG, the N-terminal -helical stretch formed by H1 to H3 extends until Thr50 -structure may correspond to the predicted -structure regions in IBV E around Pro55. nonpolarized infrared spectra of the amide I and II regions in H2O at low hydration (solid line) or hydrated in D2O (broken line) are shown. the amide II is indicated by a star. Arrowheads indicate the maxima in the amide I band. rIBV E IC-inactive T16A and A26F mutants display kinetics in genome replication/transcription, protein translation, and virus assembly inside the infected cells. rIBV E IC-inactive T16A and A26F mutants display kinetics in genome replication/transcription, protein translation, and virus assembly. previous reports have shown that substitution of a nonoligomerizing TMD for the IBV E TMD led to intracellular accumulation of viral particles (38), highlighting the importance of the IBV E TMD for the forward trafficking of cargo to the plasma membrane through the Golgi complex. revertant mutants bearing the T16A and A26F mutations restored both IC activity and viral fitness. the rA26F compensatory mutations observed differed slightly depending on the cell type used for the passage. however, these small differences may not be reproducible. it remains to be tested whether these compensatory mutations can lead to a recovery of native phenotype. both SARS-CoV E and MERS E have a single predicted TMD. there is an overwhelming evidence of a NexoCcyto topology for IBV E (39, 43, 48), which implies the presence of only one TMD. this would allow direct regulation of the TMD through modifications in the insert region of IBV E. a recent study based on the analysis of IBV E in transfected cells reaches opposite conclusions regarding the oligomeric state of the T16A and A26F mutants. the authors associated the effects on Golgi compartment disassembly and trafficking with an IBV E monomeric form present in both the WT and the A26F mutant. almost all (95%) of WT IBV E appeared in the high-molecular-weight band. the role of the monomeric and oligomeric forms of IBV E is precisely the opposite. disruption of the secretory pathway is associated with an oligomeric form (WT and A26F mutant), whereas a monomeric form (T16A mutant) enhances VLP formation. peptides inspired on that domain form amyloid fibers (51, 54), whereas peptide 50-65 forms 100% -helix (unpublished result). IR spectrum of IBV E in lipid bilayers is mostly -helical but shows a minor contribution of -structure. the native function of this region in SARS-CoV E, as well as H4-H5 helices in IBV E, is unknown, but this region is probably involved in protein-protein interactions. a strategy for vaccine development that prevents back-mutations might be to combine the mutation with simultaneous mutations in this insert region. rIBV E IC-inactive T16A and A26F mutants display kinetics in genome replication/transcription, protein translation, and virus assembly inside the infected cells. the reduced virion release for these IC-inactive mutants suggests a role for E protein IC activity in efficient shedding of mature virions. preliminary studies suggest that the mutations introduced here also resulted in differential activation of cellular response pathways. this includes alterations in the induction of apoptotic cell death and production of proinflammatory cytokines. however, the patterns of revertant mutations observed in the two cases are very different. mutation Y64H appeared only when the virus was passaged in vero cells. but these small differences may not be reproducible. it remains to be tested whether these compensatory mutations can lead to a recovery of native phenotype when introduced in the chicken embryo system. this would allow direct regulation of the TMD through modifications in the insert region of IBV E. this would allow direct regulation of the TMD through helices H1 (N11D) and H4 (Fig. 1, insert region) and allosterically alter the TMD, reinstating in the oligomer some lost flexibility that is necessary for IC activity. a recent study based on the analysis of IBV E in transfected cells reaches opposite conclusions regarding the oligomeric state of the T16A and A26F mutants. the latter study analyzed nonquantitatively the relative sedimentation of IBV E in a sucrose gradient after extraction from transfected cells with the detergent DDM (n-dodecyl--d-maltoside) no obvious -structure was detected for IBV E in SDS or LMPG micelles. the structure appears to be formed by several -helical stretches. this is supported by the -helical conformation of H4 that could be observed in LMPG. the IR spectrum of IBV E in lipid bilayers is mostly -helical but shows a minor contribution of -structure. for IBV E in detergent, short stretches before and after the conserved Pro55, predicted to form -structure, were difficult to detect by NMR. however, the conformation of this region remains uncertain. the results point to compensatory mutations for the rA26F mutant located in an insert region characteristic of gamma-CoV. however, it is possible that the stability of these mutations in ovo or in vivo may be different from that in vitro. commercial LAVs are produced after multiple passages of virulent field isolates in embryonated domestic fowl eggs. this has several drawbacks, such as lack of cross-protection due to many different IBV serotypes, reduced viral immunogenicity, mutations that enable back-mutations. pGEM construct containing the cDNA fragment (fragment E) spanning the genomic region of nucleotides 20901 to 27608 of IBV. each E fragment contained different point mutations within the E gene that would result in amino acid substitutions to abolish IC activity. RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. cDNA was reverse transcribed using the oligo(dT) primer and Promega reverse transcription system. oligo(dT) primer was used as the template for the subsequent PCR. the cDNA product was purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega) and sequenced with primer 5\u2032-TTGAAACTGGGGGGCCAAAAGC-3\u2032. the rIBVs were serially passaged 25 times, in which the E gene was sequenced at passages 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25. the viral population was studied in two ways. in one set of experiments, cells were washed twice at 24 hpi and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. transfection was performed using lipofectamine 2000 reagent. cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected with 0.8 g of plasmid DNA. cell pellets were lysed in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. the two native cysteine residues (Cys44 and Cys45) were mutated to alanine in all constructs to improve the yield and purity of the expressed protein. the constructs were transformed into pNIC28-Bsa4 for protein expression. cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 2 mM -ME, and 10% glycerol. eluent was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), lyophilized, and further purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. tonitrile (IPA-ACN) mixture (80:20 [vol/vol] with 0.1% TFA) on a Phenomenex Jupiter C4 column (250 by 10 mm, 300- pore size, 5-m particle size) identity and purity of peptide fractions confirmed by SDS-PAGE and in-gel trypsin digestion. the potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the side of the protein addition (the cis side of the membrane chamber), whereas the trans side was set to ground. the chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen. NMR data were processed using Bruker TopSpin 3.1. sequence-specific assignment of backbone 1HN, 15N, 13C', 13C, and 13C was achieved by using 2D [1H-15N]-TROSY-HSQC, 3D HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and CBCA(CO)NH on a 15N/13C/D-labeled IBV E protein. the egg-adapted Beaudette strain of IBV (ATCC VR-22) was obtained from the ATCC and adapted to Vero cells as described previously. the cell lysate obtained 24 hpi was treated with three freeze-thaw cycles, followed by clarification at 1,500 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was stored at 80\u00b0C. in vitro transcription was performed using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using the oligo(dT) primer and ImProm-II reverse transcription system. the following primers were used: IBV subgenomic RNA, 5\u2032-CTATTATACTAGCCTTGCGCTAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGGTGTTACCAACATCTCACC-3\u2032; -actin, 5\u2032-TACGCCAACAACGAACGGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGCACTGGCATCTTTAGAC-3\u2032. the cDNA product was purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega) and sequenced with primer 5 cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.4% agarose. cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde before staining with crystal violet. each sample was titrated in triplicate in each experiment. the relative abundance of the WT-rIBV and mutant rIBVs was determined as previously described (32). cDNA sequence was amplified by RT-PCR of RNA extracted from IBV-infected cells using primers 5\u2032-CGGAATTCCACCATGAATAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCGCTCGAGTCAAGAGTACAATTTGTC-3\u2032. s were lysed in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. the antisera against IBV S, E, M, and N proteins were obtained from rabbits immunized with bacterially expressed fusion proteins. mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was produced by growing an E. coli culture in LB medium at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.7. the cell mass was then transferred to M9 minimal medium at 4 times the concentration factor. IBV E protein was eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 2 mM -ME, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% LDAO. the eluent was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), lyophilized, and further purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. l-serine (DOPS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) ratio in pentane on 70- to 90-m-diameter orifices in the 15-m-thick Teflon partition. aqueous solutions of KCl were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. lyso-myristoylphosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) was solubilized at 0.8 mM in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 50 mM NaCl, and 200 mM SDS or LMPG. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as the internal reference for 1H nuclei. the areas of the amide I (C = O stretching) and amide II (N-H bending, centered at 1,550 cm1) were obtained by peak integration from 1,600 to 1,700 cm1 and from 1,510 cm1 to 1,580 cm1."}
