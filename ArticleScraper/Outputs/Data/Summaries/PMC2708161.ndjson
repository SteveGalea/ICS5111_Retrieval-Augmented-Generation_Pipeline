{"summary": "peptidyl-proline isomerase regulates turnover of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in murine aortic endothelial cells (MAEC) stimulated with E. coli endotoxin (LPS) and interferon- (IFN) degradation of iNOS was reduced by a calpain inhibitor, suggesting that PIN1 may affect induction of other calpain-sensitive inflammatory proteins, zVF and PD150606 each enhanced the induction of COX-2 by LPS/IFN. zVF also slowed the loss of COX-2 after treatment with cycloheximide. depletion of PIN1 reduced calpain activity by 55% in comparison with Control cells. depletion of PIN1 and treatment with a calpain inhibitor each reduced the degradation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in murine aortic endothelial cells (MAEC) stimulated with E. coli endotoxin (LPS) and interferon- (IFN) calpain inhibitors are known to suppress cleavage of iNOS. endothelial cell growth supplement, heparin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Bradford reagent, E. coli LPS, serotype 0111:B4 and arachidonic acid were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO) transcriptase Taq DNA polymerase, RNAse-free DNAse, deoxynucleotides, and protein G agarose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. anti-COX-2 antibody directed against a 16 amino acid sequence, ending 7 residues from the C-terminus of the protein, SC-560 and NS-398 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MN) cycloheximide/ml was used to inhibit protein synthesis after induction of COX-2 with LPS/IFN for 24 h. cells were then incubated in fresh medium containing 20 M arachidonic acid, LPS, IFN and the COX-1 selective antagonist, SC-560 (1 M) cDNA was produced from 3 g of RNA. sample protein were denatured and separated on 4\u201320% Tris-gylcine, SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. for immunoprecipitation, 500 g of cell lysate protein was incubated with 5 g anti-PIN1 antibody and protein G agarose. samples were then denatured for electrophoresis and western blotting. reaction mixture contained 40 g protein and 15 mM calcium in 50 l of buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) the susceptibility of COX-2 to degradation by exogenous calpain in vitro was also determined. reaction was started by mixing 20 M cathepsin substrate, carboxybenzyl-phenylalanine-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, in the reaction containing 2 g supernatant protein. reaction was monitored at 37\u00b0C for 30 min by fluorescence, with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. l was used to inhibit protein synthesis after induction of COX-2 with LPS/IFN. cells were then incubated in fresh medium containing 20 M arachidonic acid, LPS, IFN and the COX-1 selective antagonist, SC-560 (1 M) mRNA Levels RNA was extracted with Trizol, precipitated, and dissolved in water. 500 g of cell lysate protein was incubated with 5 g anti-PIN1 antibody. samples were then denatured for electrophoresis and western blotting. cells were washed with and scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. ine-proline-arginine-[5-((2-aminoethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid) contained 40 g protein and 15 mM calcium in 50 l of buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin release was monitored at 37\u00b0C for 30 min by fluorescence. excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. data analysis Bands in images of polymerase chain reaction gels and scanned western blots were measured with Image J 1.34 s (NIH) mRNA in KD and Control shRNA MAEC increased within 1 h. message increased within 1 h and remained elevated at 24 h. no difference between KD and Control shRNA MAEC at any time. representative ethidium bromide-stained gels are shown. bars represent mean + S.E. ratio of COX-2 to -tubulin from densitometric analysis of images from 3 independent cultures. KD and Control shRNA MAEC were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 25 M zVF for 1 h. mRNA for COX-2 and -actin were assessed as in figure 3. agarose electrophoresis of PCR products were shown. KD and Control shRNA MAEC were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 25 M zVF for 1 h, then with LPS and IFN for 24 h. cell extracts were collected at the indicated times and western blotted for COX-2 and -tubulin. calpain activity in vehicle-treated KD cells was approximately 45% of the activity in the Control cells with or without treatment with LPS/IFN (figure 8A). there were no differences in cathepsin activity in extracts of KD and control MAEC, with our without treatment with LPS/IFN. in endothelial cells increased induction of COX-2, and COX-2-dependent production of prostaglandin E2 by LPS/IFN. this suggests that PIN1 regulates COX-2 by a post-transcriptional mechanism. inhibition of turnover could lead to large, cumulative, post-transcriptional increases after induction with LPS/IFN [8] reduced calpain activity in KD extracts could be due to increase in expression or function of calpastatin or other unrecognized calpain inhibitors in KD cells. zVF further reduced the loss of COX-2 in cycloheximide-treated KD cells. this may be due to the partial 55% reduction of calpain activity in KD. interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 cannot be completely excluded. effects of PIN1 on calpain activity and/or COX-2, or associated factors, could affect the sensitivity of COX-2 to digestion with calpain. calpains, heterodimeric - and m-calpain, can cleave numerous protein substrates, and enhance or down-regulate different signal transduction processes. excessive calpain activity can also cause cell injury and death in several organs, which can be reduced with calpain inhibitors. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions TL and DGH designed the study.
