{"summary": "the study of human immunobiology in vivo is limited by technical and ethical constraints. animals with humanized immune systems would significantly advance our understanding on human immunobiology and immune-related diseases such as autoimmune diseases, virus infections, as well as tumour and graft rejection. humanized mice are specifically defined in this review as mice with a human immune system reconstituted by engrafting human haematopoietic or mature immune cells and/or immune tissues [15\u201324] to avoid confusion, humanized mice are specifically defined in this review as mice with a human immune system reconstituted by engrafting human haematopoietic or mature immune cells. the lack of functional T and B cells in SCID mice contributes to the acceptance of allogeneic or xenogeneic grafts without severe rejection. the lack of functional T and B cells in SCID mice contributes to the acceptance of allogeneic or xenogeneic grafts without severe rejection. the innate immune defects in NOD/LtSz or NOD/Shi-SCID mice might well account for increased human xenograft survival in vivo[37\u201340]. xenogeneic combinations can be engulfed by xenogeneic macrophages due to inefficient interaction between CD47 and SIRPaon macrophages. c chain is an indispensable component of receptor heterodimers for many cytokines. NOD/SCID/cnull mice were created by impairing c chain in NOD/SCID mice. these mice are completely defective in T, B and NK activity. NOD mice with targeted mutations of both Rag1 and perforin genes were developed, named NOD/LtSz-Rag1nullPfpnull mice, which lacked mature T, B and NK cells. these mice supported a 4- to 5-fold increase in percentages and total numbers of human lymphocytes in the periphery compared with NOD/LtSz-Rag1null mice. xenogeneic human HSCs or mature immune cells could be rejected in recipient mice by innate immune elements including mouse neutrophils, granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. the strategies to deplete NK cells and certain subpopulations of monocytes and macrophages in recipient mice could improve human HSCs or immune cell engraftment. the low engrafting efficiency of human HSCs and immune cells in xenogeneic immunodeficient recipient mice may be somewhat improved by offering human growth factors. administration of human TNF- to irradiated NOD/SCID mice before transplantation led to rapid augmentation of human T lymphopoiesis. administration of human Fc-IL7 fusion protein greatly enhances the presence of human T cells in spleens and peripheral blood of NOD/SCIDcnul rhIL-15 is shown to have haematopoiesis-promoting effects, including proliferation of T cells, maturation of B cells and development of NK cells. administration of IL-12 or IL-18 enhanced the engraftment of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice. co-administration prevented grafting due to IFN--dependent apoptosis and regulation of class-switching IgA. treatment with anti-c-kit monoclonal antibody (clone ACK2) could transiently remove a majority of recipient HSCs and make niches where HSCs could home to. subsequent transplantation of donor HSCs could lead to 90% donor chimerism, and this may become an alternative conditioning regimen for engrafting xenogeneic HSCs. or Ragnull mice against human grafts may be associated with significant increases in human engraftment. the low engrafting efficiency of human HSCs and immune cells in xenogeneic immunodeficient recipient mice may be somewhat improved by offering human growth factors. administration of human TNF- to irradiated NOD/SCID mice led to rapid augmentation of human T lymphopoiesis. administration of human Fc-IL7 fusion protein greatly enhances presence of human T cells in spleens and peripheral blood of NOD/SCIDcnull mice. administration of IL-12 or IL-18 enhanced the engraftment of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice. a preparative regimen involving sublethal irradiation or chemical reagents may be required to make \u2018space\u2019 for grafting xenogeneic human HSCs or immune cells. these pretreatments could result in depletion of mouse HSCs, increase concentrations of growth factors and chemoattractants. human HSC transplantation in NOD/SCID mice requires 2\u20133 Gy pre-irridiation, and human immune cells could repopulate mature human T and B cells were found to be present in peritoneal cavity, peripheral blood, spleens or lymph nodes. some human macrophages were found in lymphoid organs. the'so-called' established human immune system became non-functional in the late stage. irradiation could increase human engraftment in Rag2null mice. irradiation could increase the efficiency of human engraftment. human lymph nodes were transplanted into human lymph nodes. phenotypes of human T cells and mouse xenoantigens were found. human bone marrow grafts in SCID mice were histologically comparable to normal foetal bone marrow when fragments of foetal human femur and tibia were implanted into SCID mice [88], 89. the multi-lineage reconstitution of functional T, B and NK cells was achieved in irradiated NOD/SCID/cnull mice by grafting human CD34+ cells. ocytic cells and haematopoietic progenitor cells were detected in the chimaeric mice. both the frequency and levels of engraftment were lower than those previously reported when human immune cells were transplanted into adult NOD/SCID recipients. human T cells in the grafts were similar to those of normal human foetal thymus. levels of peripheral circulating human T cells were relatively low in this model. no detectable mature human B cells were generated in these mice. all four human IgG subclasses, IgA and IgE were detectable [104] results showed human antibody production and isotype switching occured in these mice. these mice produced high levels of human IgM and IgG antibodies and mediated strong immune responses in vivo as demonstrated by skin xenograft rejection. BLs into SCID mice caused mature activated T cells to populate the primary lymphoid tissues [70] and a massive expansion of human B cells in the spleen. the high rate of reconstitution could be achieved after transfer of human PBLs into SCID, NOD/SCID and NOD/SCID2Mnull mice. human PBL engraftment in SCID mice was extremely difficult. several strategies were explored to improve the efficiency of human PBL engraftment. this included an increasing number of transferred cells [29, 79], pre-treatment of recipient mice with low-dose irradiation [32], elimination of recipient mouse NK cells by anti-asia-lo-GM1 antibodies [81]. NOD/SCID/cnull mice engrafted with human cord blood CD34+ cells without co-transplantation of human immune tissues. human cells migrated into peripheral lymphoid organs. these T cells responded to mitogenic stimuli, such as PHA and IL-2. humanized mice were immunized with tetanus tox-oid or infected with EBV. low levels of antigen-specific human IgG productions indicate an inefficient class switching is present in this model. humanized mice achieved by engrafting human thymus and HSCs. no detectable mature human B cells were generated in these mice. transplantation of foetal human thymus, liver haematopoietic cells and lymph nodes resulted in improved differentiation of mature human T and B cells. these mice produced human IgM and IgG at levels that were consistently higher than those observed in SCID mice grafted with human thymus and liver tissues. a proposed ideal experimental humanized mouse model should be explored. the ideal recipient mice should be deficient of both adaptive and innate immunity. if humanized immunity was achieved by grafting foetal human thymus and HSCs, the recipient mice should be athymic. s in immunodeficient mice to reconstitute human immunity may be an optimal approach. the co-transplantation strategy of foetal human thymus/liver tissues and CD34+ HSCs could sustain development of multilineage of human immune cells, including T cells, B cells and DCs. a combination of modified recipients would create an optimal humanized mouse model with an approximation of a complete human immune system. mutilineages of immune cells were reconstituted, including human T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. thymocytes of human thymus grafts in SCID mice had a phenotype comparable to those of freshly isolated foetal human thymocytes. human DCs in humanized mice were developmentally, phenotypically, and functionally similar to the DC subsets found in human beings. human NK cells mainly repopulated in BM and spleen, and showed cytotoxicity against K562 cells in this model [91]. this provides a possible way to investigate the pathogenesis and effector phases of human autoimmune diseases in in vivo models. in humanized mice grafted with human PBLs, HIV infections were limited to a short period because CD4+ T cells were rapidly depleted and lacked replenishment sources. this is feasible for the study of HIV-specific human humoural immune responses and for the isolation of human mAbs against HIV. humanized mouse models have been developed for pre-clini-cal evaluation of antiviral compounds against HIV including azidothymidine [126], dideoxyinosine, dideoxycytosine, nevirapine, protease inhibitors [127], non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine derivatives. exposure to cocaine can enhance HIV infection in vivo by activating sigma-1 receptors and modulating the expression of HIV coreceptors. humanized mouse models were used to examine VZV pathogenesis and immunobiology in vivo. Eliminating ORF47 kinase activity impaired virus production and envelopment, which would block VZV infectivity for T cells. dengue virus is an important mosquito-borne flavivirus and it infects human beings. human skin was grafted onto the backs and autologous human immune cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of SCID mice. adaptive CD4+CD25+Treg cells isolated from kidney transplant recipients mediated the suppression of donor-specific DTH in humanized mice. GVHD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSC transplantation. mice conditioned with 300 cGy total body irradiation developed lethal GVHD after injection of human T cells through the retro-orbital venous plexus. humanized mouse models were used to study the immune response to xenogeneic porcine grafts in vivo. human T cells in these mice did not infiltrate pig skin or artery grafts. however, pig tissue allowed human T cells to infiltrate and injure both pig skin and artery grafts because the actions of this proinflammatory cytokine were not species-restricted. human T cells developed in this chimerism showed specific non-responsiveness to the porcine donor because it lacked rejection of porcine haematopoietic cells and anti-donor pig MLR responses. human T cells in the mixed chimeric mice rejected the third party porcine skin grafts and responded to the third party porcine antigens in MLR assays. humanized mice could be successfully engrafted with xenogeneic human tumours including solid humanized mice provide an opportunity to evaluate human cytokines and chemokines that augment both innate and adaptive anti-tumour immune responses of human leucocytes. this model has been used to test the anti-tumour efficacy of a wide spectrum of human cytokines [172\u2013174] and cytokine-delivery strategies. human umbilical cord blood (UCB), bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) were used as sources of human mutilineages of immune cells were reconstituted, including human T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. thymocytes of human thymus grafts in mice had a phenotype comparable to those of freshly isolated foetal human thymocytes. human T cells maturing in human thymus grafts responded to toxic shock syndrome toxin1 superantigens, EBV infection and mitogen humanized mice were developmentally, phenotypically, and functionally similar to the DC subsets found in human beings [114] human NK cells mainly repopulated in BM and spleen, and showed cytotoxicity against K562 cells in this model [91] human PBLs obtained from patients with organ-specific and multi-system autoimmune diseases survived in SCID mice for several months and produced IgG and autoantibodies with same specificities found in the donor [115]. in humanized mice grafted with human PBLs, HIV infections were limited to a short period because CD4+ T cells were rapidly depleted and lacked replenishment sources. a strong HIV-specific antibody response was observed after intrasplenic transfer of PBLs from untreated HIV-infected patients into NOD/SCID mice. this is feasible for the study of HIV-specific human humoural immune responses. humanized mice constructed by human thymus, liver tissues and lymph nodes were permissive for HIV replication [78]. antiviral compounds such as azidothymidine would partially suppress replication in a time- and dose-dependent manner. exposure to cocaine can enhance HIV infection in vivo by activating sigma-1 receptors and modulating the expression of HIV coreceptors. humanized mouse models were used to study novel vaccine candidates against SARS CoV, SARS DNA vaccines mice grafted with human cord blood haematopoietic progenitor cells achieved replication of dengue viral infection in a physiological setting. humanized mice were used to investigate pathogenesis and therapeutics of EBV [140], cytomegalovirus (CMV) [135] and influenza infections [141]. human skin was grafted onto the backs and autologous human immune cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of SCID mice. adaptive CD4+CD25+Treg cells isolated from kidney transplant recipients mediated the suppression of donor-specific DTH in humanized SCID mice. GVHD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSC transplantation. nod/SCID/2Mnull mice conditioned with 300 cGy total body irradiation developed lethal GVHD after injection of human T cells through the retro-orbital venous plexus. this model replicated similar phases and pathogenesis of human acute GVHD in physiological settings. human T cells in these mice did not infiltrate pig skin or artery grafts. pig tissue allowed human T cells to infiltrate and injure both pig skin and artery grafts. this proinflammatory cytokine was not species-restricted and could activate pig endothelial cells to express cell surface molecules necessary to recruit a local infiltrate of leucocytes. porcine donor lacked rejection of porcine haematopoietic cells and anti-donor pig MLR responses. human T cells in the mixed chimeric mice rejected the third party porcine skin grafts. human T cells in the mixed chimeric mice responded to the third party porcine skin grafts. humanized mice provide an opportunity to evaluate human cytokines and chemokines that augment both innate and adaptive anti-tumour immune responses of human leucocytes. this model has been used to test the anti-tumour efficacy of a wide spectrum of human cytokines [172\u2013174] and cytokine-delivery strategies. these models are becoming powerful and versatile tools to investigate human haematolymphoid differentiation."}
