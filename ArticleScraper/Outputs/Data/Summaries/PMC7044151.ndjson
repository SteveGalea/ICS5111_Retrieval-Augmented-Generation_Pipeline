{"summary": "several viral pathogens are related to canine diarrhea in china. CPV is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in dogs. CPV is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in dogs. CPV-2 is widely distributed in nature, and the morbidity and mortality of CPV-2-infected animals remain high (20) a dramatic increase in the number of dog or other factors potentially promote the spread of different CPV-2 antigenic variants, increasing disease complexity (21\u201323). the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of CPV-2 need to be updated in China. in the 1970s, CPV-2 morbidity varied between 30 and 40%, with a mortality rate of over 10% (29). in the 1980s, CPV-2 incidence varied between 41.61 and 100%, and the mortality rate varied from 3.1 to 60% (33, 36). from the 1990s to the current era, CPV-2 incidence in clinical animal hospitals has varied between 3.90 and 95.8%. the proportion of CPV-2 incidences from January to December varied from 1.9 to 31.43%, 2.8 to 33.33%, 5.6 to 38.29%, 11.48 to 31.71%, 8.84 to 27.91%, 2.8 to 20.69%, 1.7 to 16.13%, 1.9 to 16.27%, 4.26 to 18.70%, 5.86 to 27.78%, 4.10 to 35.56%, and 2.20 to 32.88%, respectively. higher positive rates of CPV-2 were found in animals ranging from 2 to 4 months old. low morbidity in dogs aged 1 month most likely resulted from acquired maternal antibody. low morbidity in dogs aged more than 4 months most likely resulted from adaptive immune responses. male dogs account for the higher disease prevalence (8, 63) prevalence of CPV-2 in dogs shows significant gender variation, usually occurring more in male dogs than female dogs. correlation between breeds and canine parvovirus (CPV) infection in china. both vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs can be affected by CPV-2 (60) positive rates of CPV in unvaccinated dogs were significantly higher than those in vaccinated animals (41\u201343, 47, 50, 55, 56, 58, 60) vaccination is vitally important for prevention and control of CPV-2. CPV-2 single infection is higher than that of a coinfection with other viruses (41). CPV-2 cure rates have been improved using specific drugs or other treatments. of the 201 samples, the CPV-2-positive rate was 47.26% (95/201) cholerae, V. vulnificus, and Y. enterocolitica, at frequencies of 18.95, 27.37, 7.37, 14.74, 34.74, 8.42, 3.16, 4.21, 37.89, 1.05, and 3.16%, respectively. coinfection of canine enteric viruses and bacteria frequently occur in diarrheic dogs. in the 1970s, CPV-2 morbidity varied between 30 and 40%, with a mortality rate of over 10% (29). in the 1980s, CPV-2 incidence varied between 41.61 and 100%, with a mortality rate of over 10% (33, 36). in spring (March to May), CPV-2 incidences vary from 9.26 to 40.52%, whereas in summer (June to August), incidences vary from 7.70 to 52.22%. in the autumn (September to November), incidences vary from 5.48 to 33.06%, and in the winter (December to February), they vary from 14.80 to 33.04% (43, 45, 50\u201354) for 1 month old, the positive proportion varies from 5.40 to 9.93%. for 3 months old, it varies from 11.26 to 23.08%; for 4 months old, it varies from 8.21 to 16.38%. between 5 months and 1 year, it varies from 2.55 to 7.65%. the proportion of CPV-positive male dogs varies between 15.29 and 69.20%. that of positive female dogs varies between 16.80 and 47.7%. male dogs account for the higher disease prevalence (8, 63) prevalence of CPV-2 in dogs shows significant gender variation. correlation between dog vaccinations and canine parvovirus (CPV) infection in china. vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs can be affected by CPV-2 (60) positive rates of CPV in unvaccinated dogs were significantly higher than those in vaccinated animals. CPV-2 infection in adult dogs results in temporary panleukopenia or lymphopenia. CPV-2 monoclonal antibodies are highly therapeutic in a short period of time. the cure rate for a CPV-2 single infection is higher than that of a coinfection with other viruses (41). the CPV-2-positive rate was 47.26% (95/201) of the 201 samples, the CPV-2-positive rate was 47.26% (95/201) the coinfection rates occurred with the following 11 pathogens. CPV-2 was the main causative agent of canine diarrhea in northeast china. CPV infection occurs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated dogs (72). CPV infection occurs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated dogs (72). CPV infection occurs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated dogs (72). CPV-2c appears to have circulated in eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern regions of china. CPV-2c circulated in eastern, central, and southwestern regions. new CPV-2a and CPV-2b strains started circulating in northeast china. 204 CPV strains clustered into their respective antigenic variants. CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2c, new CPV-2a, and new CPV-2b. circulating CPV antigenic variants in china include CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2c, and new CPV-2b. CPV-2b is the prevalent variant in the united states, the united kingdom, and Japan, but with different frequencies (3, 24, 90, 91) the CPV-2c is detected mainly in Italy and Argentina, and Uruguay (24, 77, 92\u201395). CPV-2c was completely replaced by the CPV-2a variant in America, which is consistent with the prevalence of CPV in China (96, 97). in the early 1980s, the original CPV-2 started circulating in Chinese canine populations. in 1986, CPV-2a replaced CPV-2 as the predominant Chinese isolate. new CPV-2a and CPV-2b strains are distributed over all parts of the country. entire VP2 gene sequences of CPV strains were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database to construct phylogenetic trees. the entire VP2 gene sequences of CPV strains were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database to construct phylogenetic trees. a summary of VP2 gene sequences has provided a comprehensive perspective on CPV-2 evolution. correlative biological studies should be performed. CPV-2a, 2b, and 2c are circulating in almost all countries. CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c are currently spreading globally. their relative frequencies may be related to the geographic region and time of the sample collection. this mini-review will facilitate an increased comprehension of CPV strains in China."}
