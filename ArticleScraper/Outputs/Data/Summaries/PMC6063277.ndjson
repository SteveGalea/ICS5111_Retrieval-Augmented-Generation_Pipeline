{"summary": "most bacterial genomes contain only 25\u201346 unique tRNA species. this apparent shortfall in decoding ability is mitigated by GU wobble base pairing. specific modifications to the first anticodon base of the tRNA also contribute to wobble base pairing. deleting MEs is lethal or otherwise deleterious for growth and translation. to address these gaps, we traced the evolutionary history of the five known bacterial tRNA modifications. we first determined the occurrence of each modification pathway in 1093 sequenced bacteria that represent the diversity of eubacteria. we then used ancestral reconstruction to infer the major evolutionary gain or loss events in the bacterial phylogeny. tRNA modifications may affect translational speed and accuracy. we hypothesize that the presence of a tRNA modification should selectively favor the tRNAs that it modifies (henceforth \u201ctarget\u201d RNA) selection on tRNA that are not modified by the ME should be weakened, since their function would be redundant with the modified target tRNA. the evolutionary history of tRNA modifications is highly dynamicmic. we determined the occurrence of tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria. we assumed that detected homologs are functional, and have the same modification function as that of previously described enzymes. the proteobacterial cmo5U modification is also active in Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium bovis str. BCG (Murao et al. 1976; Yamada et al. 2005; Chionh et al. 2016). however, we could not reliably identify the reported enzymes in the sequence of any other organisms. value in parentheses indicates the posterior probability of each gain or loss event for each ME involved in the modification pathway. tRNA with a yellow border are those involved in GU wobble base pairing and were not considered in subsequent analyses. -proteobacteria, once in -proteobacteria, and once in some species of -proteobacteria (fig. 1B) some species do not have well-supported homologs to proteobacterial cmo5U genes. however, it is possible that the modification was ancient and the responsible genes diverged significantly in different bacterial lineages. c)mnm5(s2)U modification was lost at the root of Actinobacteria. we compared the tRNA gene content of species within the Actinobacteria clade with that of species in the sister group: the Cyanobacteria-Deinococcus-Thermus. four cases involving the Q modification are not informative with regard to nontarget tRNAs because these are absent in all bacteria. biochemical or evolutionary causes for the absence of these nontarget tRNAs remain unknown but theoretically these tRNAs could exist. in three out of five comparisons made for the (c)mnm5(s2)U and cmo5U modifications, at least five of the six nontarget tRNAs were present in a significantly higher proportion of species without the modification. in all five comparisons made for the I modification, at least one nontarget tRNA (in most cases both) was present in significantly more species without the modification compared with species with the modification. in three of five comparisons, target tRNAs were absent in nearly all species without the modification (fig. 2M and N; P 0.05, two-sample proportions test) together, these results suggest that except for the I modification, the evolution of modifications had no impact on the evolution of target tRNA genes. asterisks indicate a significant difference in distributions across the sister clades. species in clades without the modification typically had more extreme GC3 values. species without the modification also had significantly more biased codon use. in five of the eight cases we observed significant differences in genome size across sister clades (fig. 3A and F) we observed that larger genomes were associated with the absence of the modification. in the other three cases involving Tenericutes and Enterobacterales, the lack of modification may reflect overall genome reduction. phylogenetic regression and mapping also reveal clear instances of GC independent impacts of modification status on tRNA genes. the strongest impact of tRNA modification is observed the case of the Inosine modification, where the target tRNA was present in all species when the modification was present. open and closed triangles indicate loss and gain of each ME involved in the modification. target tRNA indicated on the tree on the left and nontarget tRNA indicated on the mirror tree on the right. nontarget tRNAs with a dashed underline indicate significant impact of focal trait on presence of tRNA gene. the evolutionary history of Bacterial tRNA Modifications is Highly Dynamic We determined the occurrence of tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria using homology searches for complete protein sequences of previously described MEs. the essential proteins RpoB and RplA (positive controls) were present in 99.5% and 99.7% of analyzed bacteria. both MnmE and MnmG are absent only in Actinobacteria and -proteobacteria. the leftmost column shows two essential housekeeping proteins (RpoB- RNA polymerase beta subunit and RplA-50S Ribosomal protein L1) that serve as positive controls for homology detection. the tree pruned to show the evolutionary relationships between the 1093 bacterial species used in our study. bacterial phylogeny suggests most bacterial tRNA modifications are ancient. these ancient modifications were independently lost multiple times. k2C modification appears to be evolutionarily stable across bacteria. eubacterial ancestor should have been able to decode most sense codons using only a subset of all possible tRNAs. ancestral reconstruction of tRNA genes suggests that the eubacterial ancestor did have all target tRNAs (except t R N A L e u U U U ), but did not possess nontarget tRNAs. we compared the tRNA gene content of species within the Actinobacteria clade with that of species in the sister group: the Cyanobacteria-Deinococcus-Thermus. of these, four cases involving the Q modification are not informative with regard to nontarget tRNAs because these are absent in all bacteria. in most of the informative sister clade comparisons (8 out of 10 cases), species were more likely to have nontarget tRNAs if the modification was absent. in three out of the five comparisons made for the (c)mnm5(s2)U and cmo5U modifications, at least five of the six nontarget tRNAs were present in a significantly higher proportion of species without the modification. target tRNAs were always present, but in two of four comparisons their copy number was lower in clades that had lost the ME. in three of five comparisons, target tRNAs were absent in nearly all species without the modification (fig. 2J\u2013L) in the remaining two comparisons, target tRNAs were present in fewer species without the modification (fig. 2M and N; P 0.05, two-sample proportions test) we also observed a significant reduction in the total number of tRNA genes. this suggests wide-ranging gene loss that is potentially a result of genome reduction. previous reports have shown that reductive genome evolution in Mollicutes has led to the loss of several tRNA MEs. GC content in third base of codons, fig. 3; p 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test; we observed similar results for RSCU of highly expressed ribosomal proteins. in five of these eight cases, species without the modification also had significantly more biased codon use. 3 of the 14 major changes in modification status were not associated with significant shifts in either tRNA or GC content. this included one instance of the loss of the (c)mnm5(s2)U modification (fig. 3B) and two losses of the I modification (fig. 3K\u2013L). a phylogenetic regression to test the impact of tRNA modifications on tRNA genes revealed that GC content had the strongest impact on the dynamics of nontarget tRNA genes. evolutionary dynamics of tRNA genes, MEs, and GC content for the (c)mnm5(s2)U modification. Branches are colored according to the inferred GC content for each branch. nodes that showed the largest GC shifts are indicated with black circles. tRNA presence/absence Modification status (i.e., presence/absence) tRNA presence/absence Modification status (i.e., presence/absence) Asterisks indicate a significant impact of the focal trait on the presence of the tRNA gene (see Materials and Methods) some modifications such as the k2C modification were lost in only a few bacterial species. the absence of the k2C modification was compensated by the presence of the nontarget tRNA UAU Ile and altered specificity of the Isoleucine tRNA synthetase. a lack of specific tRNA modifications should result in strong positive selection favoring the relevant nontarget tRNAs. this should pose a problem because codons recognized by the missing nontarget tRNAs cannot be decoded efficiently. this scenario is especially likely in species where the Q modification is absent. our analysis quantifies the role of specific tRNAs in bacterial translation. nontarget tRNAs are evolutionarily largely stable whereas nontarget tRNAs are often gained or lost in lineages following a GC shift. the combination of MEs and largely target tRNAs should confer higher fitness than a full tRNA set without MEs. our analysis also shows that multiple key components of bacterial translation have evolved in close association with genomic GC content. tRNA gene copy numbers for each of these genomes were downloaded from the Genomic tRNA database (Chan and Lowe 2009) the information for each of these genomes was represented using different identifiers in the databases that we used. a recent report shows that a nonorthologous enzyme QueH carries out the function of QueG in species that lack QueG but have the Q modification. another report suggests the possibility of Tgt alone carrying out the Q modification in the absence of QueA and QueG. however, there is no evidence for this phenomenon across most bacteria in our analysis. we used the amino acid sequences of all proteins from the 1093 genomes. each search generated a table with accession numbers of potential homologous hits. there is no consensus in the field with respect to setting an e-value cut-off to detect true homologs. a closer inspection of the B. subtilis genome did not reveal these enzymes. we therefore tested whether these enzymes are true homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB, using homology detection (using \u201cjackhmmer\u201d). we used the enzyme with the most variable presence/absence state (queG) for this analysis. we assumed calculations for all other enzymes would be more stable. the mapping resulted in 500 enzyme states at each node. phylogenetic regression tests the impact of GC content and modifications on tRNA presence/absence. tRNA presence/absence GC content*tRNA modification status. tRNA presence/absence GC content*tRNA modification status. bacterial phylogeny was generated using an alignment of the 400 most conserved protein sequences across all prokaryotes. we removed all archaea, as well as bacteria whose genomes have not been fully sequenced. the information for each of these genomes was represented using different identifiers in the various databases that we used. the information for each of these genomes was represented using different identifiers in the various databases that we used. we considered all four enzymes (Tgt, QueA, QueG, and QueH) as crucial enzymes for the Q modification. for each modification, we only considered species that had all crucial enzymes as having the modification; and denoted species that lack any of these enzymes as lacking the modification. each search generated a table with accession numbers of potential homologous hits with a corresponding e-value and bit score. to infer presence/absence with precision, we implemented a dynamic e-value cut-off to eliminate spurious hits. we observed stable plateaus where the number of species in which an ME was detected did not change despite changing the e-value cut-off. we therefore tested whether these enzymes are true homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB, using homology detection (using \u201cjackhmmer\u201d) (Eddy 2009). we observed that only the query organisms showed the presence of these enzymes (data not shown). the mapping resulted in 500 enzyme states at each node of the tree. in case the probability was 0.7, we assumed the same state at the node as the preceding node. we determined the closest sister clade where the state of modification was opposite to that of the focal clade. within each clade, we excluded species that had an opposite state for any of the MEs involved in each modification. we assigned the identity of the comparison group using the lowest level of taxonomic classification.
