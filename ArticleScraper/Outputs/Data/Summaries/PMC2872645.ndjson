{"summary": "syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the spirochetal bacterium Treponema pallidum (Tp) subspecies pallidum. syphilis has re-emerged in developed countries. most individuals (>90%) who acquire the disease reside in less affluent regions of the world. venereal syphilis is a multistage illness with clinical manifestations that reflect the propensity of Tp to disseminate systemically and to induce persistent chronic inflammation in diverse tissues and organ systems [1], [2], [13], [14]. the appearance of a painless ulcer, more commonly known as a \u201cchancre\u201d, typically only appears 2\u20134 weeks after the initial contact with the spirochete [2], [15], [16]. patients enter late latency and several years later 15\u201340% develop recrudescent forms of the disease. the bacterium disseminates from its primary or secondary sites of infection. the pathogenesis of venereal syphilis has been hampered due to the inability to readily propagate Tp in vitro. spirochetes are present in significant numbers in skin and blood of untreated SS patients. spirochetes persisted despite the presence of circulating antitreponemal opsonizing antibodies in the serum of SS patients [18], as well as the robust pro-inflammatory dermal cellular immune response characteristic of this stage of the disease [17]. study protocol was reviewed by ethics committee from each of the participating ESEs. study subjects were not eligible for participation if they were 18 years old. city of Cali is divided into 22 geographical districts called \"comunas\" study dermatologists obtained skin biopsies from 11 patients who had representative syphilis dermal lesions. whole blood and skin biopsies were also collected from a subset of patients for real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Tp DNA quantitation. all patients were treated with 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin. individual biopsy samples were then systematically analyzed by trained pathologists in Colombia. polA real-time PCR was determined by testing blood spiked with either purified Tp DNA or Tp organisms. blood sample was maintained at room temperature prior to performing spiking experiments. DNA extraction from all spiked blood samples was achieved using the Qiagen DNAeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) a 10l sample was tested in duplicate using a real-time PCR targeting the DNA polymerase I gene of Tp (polA) five to ten milliliters of whole blood were collected in tubes containing EDTA (1.8mg EDTA per milliliter of blood) from 26 SS patients enrolled in the study. the probe was labeled with Cyanine (Cy5) at the 5\u2032 end and black-hole quencher 3 (BHQ3) at the 3\u2032 end. PCR was performed in 50l reaction volumes containing: 4l of deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix. each PCR run included positive and negative (no template) control reactions. -bp tandem repeats within the arp gene and PCR-restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of tpr (T. pallidum repeat) genes was done as previously described by Pillay et al. [26], [27], with two modifications. first, all PCR amplicons were analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, San Diego, California) study procedures were reviewed and approved by the human subjects boards at the Connecticut Children's Medical Center, the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC), the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and CIDEIM. study protocol was also reviewed by ethics committee from each of the participating ESEs. study subjects were not eligible for participation if they were 18 years old. pregnant women were also excluded from participation. study dermatologists obtained skin biopsies from 11 patients who had representative syphilis dermal lesions. the study dermatologist obtained biopsies from 11 patients deemed to have distinctive clinical manifestations classically associated with SS. available tissues from these patients were stained with both hematoxilin-eosin (H&E) and Warthin-Starry silver stain. individual biopsy samples were then systematically analyzed by trained pathologists in Colombia. DNA extraction from all spiked blood samples was achieved using the QIAamp DNA Midi kit (Qiagen) a 10l sample was tested in duplicate using a real-time PCR that targets the DNA polymerase I gene of Tp (polA) PCR was performed using forward primer TP-1 (5\u2032CAGGATCCGGCATATGTCC3\u2032), reverse primer TP-2 (5\u2032AAGTGTGAGCGTCTCATCATCATTCC3\u2032), and probe TP-3 (5\u2032CTGTCATGCACCA GCTTCTT3\u2032) the probe was labeled with Cyanine (Cy5) at the 5\u2032 end. T. pallidum Molecular Typing Strain typing was attempted for all WB and skin samples obtained from SS patients. PCR amplification and sizing of the 60-bp tandem repeats within the arp gene and PCR-restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of tpr (T. pallidum repeat) genes was done as previously described by Pillay et al. the majority of subjects self-reported a high-risk sexual behavior history (62.5%), including having multiple sexual partners, rarely using condoms, and/or having contact with commercial sex workers. one male patient admitted to having unprotected sex with other men as the principal risk factor for acquiring syphilis. most subjects had faint macular and papular eruptions, which were diffusely disseminated over the trunk and upper and lower extremities. in many cases, the dermal lesions were hyperpigmented, a finding which, not surprising, was more evident in darker skinned individuals. in one subject, several very large frambesiform, pustular lesions were plainly evident over the naso-labial folds and lower jaw. symptom and signs no.

Edge of an ulcer located in the lower extremity reveals fibrinoid exudate on the ulcer bed. we previously determined that WB was the best sample to detect spirochetes in blood obtained from infected rabbits. polA PCR detection limit in blood samples was one log higher than samples kept at room temperature for a total of 26 hrs prior to DNA extraction. the polA copy numbers in these patients ranged from 194.92 to 1954.2 copies/ml of WB, which is well above the cutoff for the assay. 3 of the 4 skin biopsies that did not have detectable Tp DNA by RT-PCR were obtained from hyperkeratotic plantar plaques. 5 of the 8 patients had Tp DNA present in both the blood and the skin. one patient with spirochetemia had a negative PCR in the skin. polA PCR Skin polA PCR Strain type (Skin) Punch biopsy site Description of the lesion 71 + + 22a Epigastrium Erythematous Plaque 72 + + 14d Posterio lumbar Erythematous Plaque 73 + + 13d Right iliac crest Erythematous Plaque 75 NA Left sole Plaque 76 + + 16d Posterior neck Lichenoid plaque 77 + 16d Right ankle (external male all enrolled SS patients resided in comunas of the city of low or very\u2013low socio-economic conditions. most participants were either unschooled (10.5%) or had only partially completed elementary school education (59.6%). most participants were either afro-colombian (38.6%) or of mixed race (mestizo) (56.1%) many patients reported mild to moderate flu-like symptoms (42.1%), and all had dermal and mucosal findings. the typical palmar and plantar exanthem of SS [13], [15], [19], [32]\u2013[34] was the most common dermal manifestation (59.6%) the majority of patients (94.7%) had RPR titers than 116. over a third (36.8%) had titers 1128. hematologic anomalies, indicative of the systemic inflammatory nature of this stage of the disease, were the norm. lesions consist of smooth or scaly plaques and papules. similar lesions were evident in 59.6% of all secondary syphilis subjects enrolled. secondary syphilis has been known as the \u201cGreat Imitator\u201d due to the diversity of dermatologic lesions. spirochetes were only seen in one (9%) of the 11 biopsies studied. inflammatory responses can affect hair follicles leading to \u201cmoth-eaten alopecia\u201d as depicted in the figure. the figure shows histopathologic anomalies seen in punch biopsies obtained from four secondary syphilis patients skin lesions. corresponding clinical appearance of the lesions is also shown. we previously determined that WB was the best sample to detect spirochetes in blood obtained from infected rabbits. using a real-time qPCR assay targeting the polA gene, we first established the sensitivity of the assay to be between 15 and 150 spirochetes/ml. we then used this highly sensitive PCR method to amplify Tp DNA in 46% (11/26) of the WB samples obtained from SS patients. T. pallidum DNA in whole blood (WB) samples was collected, frozen and shipped to UCHC for subsequent DNA extraction at the CDC. findings highlight the importance of timely specimen processing and handling. Tp DNA was readily detected in 8/12 (66%) skin biopsies studied. 5 of the 8 patients had Tp DNA present in both the blood and the skin. one patient with spirochetemia had a negative PCR in the skin. a quarter of all yearly cases of infectious syphilis occur in Latin America and the Caribbean. syphilis is not rigorously notified, and often not recognized by health care providers in the region. syphilis has been shown to be a leading cause of genital ulcerative disease. in one of the few available studies describing the epidemiology of venereal syphilis in Colombia, 10% of female sex workers in Bogota had serologic and clinical evidence of the disease. this assertion was further substantiated by the very high syphilis seroprevalence rates documented in 15\u201324 year old sexually active men and women from poor Cali districts. a significant proportion of early syphilis patients, regardless of the stage of the disease, have circulating spirochetal DNA. the detection limit in blood samples spiked with either DNA or whole Tp organisms and kept at 4\u00b0C for 26 hrs was 15 polA copies/ml blood compared to 150 polA copies/ml in the same dilutions stored at room temperature for 1 hr. the ability to detect low copy numbers may be enhanced by extracting DNA on site and using a larger volume of blood (2ml vs. 400l) we also performed Tp strain type analysis in DNA material obtained from the skin of several SS patients in the city of Cali. the spirochete is largely devoid of integral outer-membrane proteins. this is thought to contribute to the ability of intact spirochetes to avoid recognition by innate immune cell pattern recognition receptors. inefficient antibody binding to the small number of potential antigenic targets present on the spirochete's outer membrane could also allow the spirochete to shun rapid and efficient binding by opsonizing anti-treponemal antibodies. high syphilis prevalence rates in the region should prompt health care workers in countries like Colombia to maintain a high index of suspicion. a diagnosis of SS must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in any subject who presents with chronic skin and/or mucosal lesions."}
