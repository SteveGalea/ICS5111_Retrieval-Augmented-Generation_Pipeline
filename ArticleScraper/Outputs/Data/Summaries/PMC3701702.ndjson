{"summary": "most emerging/reemerging diseases result from human-adapted infectious agents that genetically acquire heightened transmission and/or pathogenic characteristics. examples of such diseases include multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR and XDR) tuberculosis, toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus causing toxic shock syndrome. reemerging infectious diseases can be defined as diseases that are recognized in the human host for the first time. these stages include adaptation to a new host [11], an epidemic/pathogenic stage, an endemic stage, and a fully adapted stage in which the organism may become nonpathogenic and potentially even beneficial to the new host. AIDS was not recognized as a distinct entity until 1981 [6], [9] after its initial detection among certain risk groups, such as men who have sex with men, recipients of blood products, and injection drug users. the bulk of HIV infections globally has resulted from heterosexual transmission that has been heavily weighted within the developing world. pathogenic strains of dengue have spread back from Southeast Asia to the western Hemisphere. cholera has repeatedly reemerged over more than two centuries in association with global travel, changing seasons, war, natural disasters, and conditions that lead to poor sanitation. global emergence of plasmid-spread NDM-1 (New Delhi -lactamase) Gram-negative pan-resistant organisms linked to global antibiotic use and inadequate antibiotic stewardship, medical tourism, economic globalization. drug resistance mutations have also caused the reemergences of certain pathogens such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, drug-resistant malaria, and numerous bacterial diseases. the 1918 influenza pandemic virus is one example: its descendants have evolved continuously by antigenic drift, intra-subtypic reassortment, and antigenic shift. in the past 95 years, its descendants have evolved continually by antigenic drift, intra-subtypic reassortment, and antigenic shift. the battle against emerging infectious diseases is a continual process. winning does not mean stamping out every last disease, but getting out ahead of the next one."}
