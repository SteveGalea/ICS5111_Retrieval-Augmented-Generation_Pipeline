{"summary": "more than 8,000 cases of severe respiratory illness have been identified worldwide. a new strain of coV emerged in the middle east as a cause of severe respiratory disease in humans. no vaccines or antivirals known to be effective for control of disease in humans are currently available. three humanized transgenic mouse models, each with strengths and weaknesses, have been reported. two are primarily lung infection models that develop various extent of lung pathology in response to 105 to 106 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of MERS-CoV. a transgenic mouse model globally expressing human CD26 (hCD26)/DPP4 exhibits acute illness. transgenic mice expressing hCD26/DPP4 were generated in house in the barrier facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch as previously described (10) all animal studies were conducted strictly following an approved animal protocol and the guidelines and regulations of the national Institutes of health and AAALAC. lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, and intestine were weighed and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) with a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Retsch, Haan, Germany) after clarifying by centrifugation, the titers of the resulting suspensions were determined in the standard vero E6 cell-based infect antibody-virus mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h before transfer of 100 l of the mixtures into confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates. six wells of vero E6 cells cultured with equal volumes of M-2 medium with and without virus were included in these assays as positive and negative controls. 96-well ELISA plates were precoated with recombinant S1-His protein (1 g/ml) for quantifying total specific IgG antibodies, the thoroughly washed plates were incubated in the dark with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma; catalog no. P9187) for 15 min. the highest dilutions of serum specimens with MERS-CoV S1-specific antibody with a mean OD tissue specimens harvested from animals at indicated times after infection were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 72 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin for subsequent sectioning and processing. standard alkaline phosphatase-based colorimetric indirect immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using a combination of a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV polyclonal antibody and a biotinylated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin second immunization subjected to serological assays for quantifying neutralizing and MERS-CoV S1 protein-specific IgG antibodies. three mice in each group were sacrificed at 3 dpi for quantifying infectious virus and viral RNA expression. the remaining five animals in each group were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. all animal studies were conducted strictly following an approved animal protocol and the guidelines and regulations of the national Institutes of health and AAALAC. the EMC-2012 strain of MERS-CoV was designated passage zero (P0) and further expanded with three passages in Vero E6 cells for generating cell-free P1, P2, and P3 stocks. virus titers of individual samples were expressed as log10 TCID50 per gram of tissue. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR. tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. antibody-virus mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h before transfer of 100 l of the mixtures into confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates. the wells of vero E6 cells infected with virus alone developed advanced cytopathic effects (CPE). 96-well ELISA plates were precoated with recombinant S1-His protein (1 g/ml) for quantifying total specific IgG antibodies, the thoroughly washed plates were incubated in the dark with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma; catalog no. P9187) for 15 min. the highest dilutions of serum specimens with MERS-CoV S1-specific antibody with a mean OD a rabbit anti-MERS-CoV polyclonal antibody and a biotinylated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin were also included in this staining as negative controls. groups of age-matched Tg+ mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) twice (once and then again three weeks later) with 10 g S377-588-Fc\u201350 l PBS formulated with an equal amount of MF59 adj three mice in each group were sacrificed at 2 dpi for assessing yields of infectious virus or viral RNA expression. the remaining five animals in each group were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. all mice receiving virus dosages of 102 to 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV succumbed to the infection (100% mortality), with the day of death occurring later with reducing dosage (Table 1). weight loss was extreme (20%) for dosages of 103 and higher; all mice given a dose of 102 died, but weight loss was 8% or less. only 5 of 8 mice given a dose of 101 died; deaths occurred between 8 to 13 dpi, and weight loss was only mice were followed daily for morbidity (weight loss) and mortality for at least 3 weeks. none of the infected mice exhibited significant weight loss. a death on each of days 9 and 10 in mice infected with 10 TCID50 and a single death in mice infected with 5 or 1.25 TCID50. the rechallenged mouse without serum antibody did exhibit evidence of neutralizing and ELISA antibody results for lower-endpoint criteria. previous infection with a nonlethal dose of MERS-CoV was sufficient to induce immune responses that fully protect Tg+ mice against lethal infection. hCD26/DPP4 mice challenged with 10 LD50 of MERS-CoV suffered a profound weight loss of 20%, with 100% death within 6 days after infection. the initial plan was to sacrifice three mice at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 dpi for assessing viral infection. 107 TCID50/g of infectious virus from the lungs of mice inoculated with 105 LD50 (106 TCID50) we detected a much lower titer of virus (104.6 TCID50/g) from the lung of only a single mouse at 2 and 4 dpi. IHC staining with specific rabbit antibodies failed to reveal the expression of viral antigens in paraffin-embedded lung and brain tissues, including those positive for infectious virus data are presented as means standard errors (SE); error bars indicate standard errors. results of qRT-PCR analyses targeting the upstream E gene of MERS-CoV clearly indicated consistent expression of viral RNA. viral RNA expression was detected at day 6 and increased thereafter, reaching a level equivalent to 103.4 TCID50/g at 10 dpi. lung histopathology of infected mice primarily showed mild and multifocal perivascular, peribronchial, and interstitial infiltrations with mononuclear cells at 2 and 4 days postinfection. intensity of these pulmonary infiltrates was slightly increased in 2 of 3 animals and moderately increased in 1 animal at 6 dpi. a decreasing trend of the pulmonary inflammatory response was seen in the sole survivor at 10 dpi, suggesting 102 TCID50/mouse (10 LD50) developed progressive inflammatory responses. pathological changes consisting of perivascular cuffing, microglia activation, and apoptotic bodies were noted in brain stem tissues from 6 to 10 dpi. mild meningitis was noted in cerebral tissues from 8 to 10 dpi. two groups of Tg+ mice were immunized twice (with 3 weeks between immunizations) with S377-588-Fc plus MF59 adjuvant (S377-588-Fc/MF59) or PBS/MF59 (as a control) sera of vaccinated mice were collected at day 10 after the second immunization for assessing immunogenicity in neutralizing antibody tests. loss and a single death occurred at 10 dpi; the remaining four animals survived until the experiment was terminated at 21 dpi. two groups of Tg+ mice (with eight animals in each group) were immunized with a MF59-adjuvanted RBD fragment fused with Fc or MF59/PBS alone. levels of the resulting neutralizing antibody titers were determined prior to viral challenge. lung viral RNA titers were significantly reduced from 3.7 log10 TCID50 eq/g in PBS-treated mice to 1.2 and 1.4 log10 TCID50 eq/g in those pretreated with HR2M6 at 1 and 4 h. all of the remaining five mice and four of the five mice pretreated with HR2M6 at 1 and 4 h, respectively, were protected from death. mice were given a single dose of either HR2M6 (200 g in 60 l) or PBS (control) at 1 or 4 h before viral challenge. survival rates of the remaining five animals in each group were assessed daily. weight loss was extreme (20%) for dosages of 103 and higher. all mice given a dose of 101 died, but weight loss was 8% or less. all of the surviving mice continued to appear healthy up to 21 dpi. mice were followed daily for morbidity (weight loss) and mortality for at least 3 weeks. none of the infected mice exhibited significant weight loss. a death on each of days 9 and 10 in mice infected with 10 TCID50 and a single death in mice infected with 5 or 1.25 TCID50. all mice challenged with 2.5 TCID50 of MERS-CoV survived without clinical illness. previous infection with a nonlethal dose of MERS-CoV was sufficient to induce immune responses that fully protect Tg+ mice against lethal infection. c Data represent the highest dilutions of sera with a mean optical density (OD) greater than the mean measured for naive mice. 18 age-matched mice were challenged with 102 TCID50 (10 LD50) of MERS-CoV. the initial plan was to sacrifice three mice at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 dpi for assessing viral infection in the lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen. eighteen hCD26/DPP4 transgene-positive mice were challenged i.n. with 10 LD50 (102 TCID50) of MERS-CoV/mouse in 50 l. low levels of virus were recovered from infected lung homogenates of a single mouse (of three) at 2 and 4 dpi. dotted lines represent the limit of detection. all lung specimens collected over time were positive for viral RNA. expression increased thereafter, reaching a level equivalent to 103.4 TCID50/g at 10 dpi. despite differences in kinetics and intensities of viral infection, lung, brain, and possibly GI tracts appear to be the major tissues supporting MERS-CoV infection. mild and multifocal perivascular, peribronchial, and interstitial infiltrations with mononuclear cells were detected at 2 and 4 dpi. the intensity of these pulmonary infiltrates was slightly increased in 2 of 3 animals and moderately increased in 1 animal at 6 dpi. a decreasing trend of the pulmonary inflammatory response was seen in the sole survivor at 10 dpi, suggesting that some resolution was under way. no intracerebral pathology was seen in brain stem tissues from 6 to 10 dpi. mild meningitis was noted in cerebral tissues from 8 to 10 dpi. pathological changes, including the presence of perivascular cuffing, apoptotic bodies, and activated microglia, were seen in the brainstem at 6 to 10 dpi. two groups of Tg+ mice were immunized twice (with 3 weeks between immunizations) with S377-588-Fc plus MF59 adjuvant (S377-588-Fc/MF59) or PBS/MF59 (as a control) sera of vaccinated mice were collected at day 10 after the second immunization for assessing immunogenicity in neutralizing antibody tests. two groups of Tg+ mice (with eight animals in each group) were immunized with a MF59-adjuvanted RBD fragment fused with Fc or MF59/PBS alone. levels of the resulting neutralizing antibody titers were determined prior to viral challenge. all of the remaining five mice and four of the five mice pretreated with HR2M6 at 1 and 4 h, respectively, were protected from death. three mice were sacrificed at 2 dpi for quantifying viral RNA. the remaining five animals were monitored for morbidity and mortality. viral loads were determined in three infected mice per group at 3 dpi by qRT-PCR targeting the upstream E gene. they are expressed as log10 TCID50 equivalents per gram (eq/g) survival rates of remaining five animals in each group were assessed daily. marmosets challenged with MERS-CoV (6) reported high titers of virus and viral antigens. challenge dosage in transgenic mouse model was similar to that reported in marmosets challenged with MERS-CoV (6). transgenic mice still exhibited dissemination of virus, including to brain. but mortality was not reported at these later times for the Ad5 model. transgenic models add virus dissemination, severe gross lung pathology and histopathology. encephalopathy or an encephalitis type of abnormality may have been missed in patients with severe lung disease. it is of interest that the reports of infection and disease for the mouse-adapted MA-15 strain of SARS-CoV and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptor transgenic mouse models exhibited SARS-CoV dissemination and presence of virus in the brain (32\u201334) mice surviving infection had developed serum neutralizing antibody. all were completely immune to challenge with 100 LD50 of virus. a receptor binding domain protein vaccine, S377-588-Fc, induced serum neutralizing antibody to MERS-CoV."}
