{"summary": "the PEDV E protein has no effect on the IEC growth, cell cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and cell survival. the cells expressing PEDV E protein express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. the PEDV E protein is localized in the ER and the nucleus. PEDV is an enveloped virus with an approximately 28 kb, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5\u2019 cap and a 3\u2019 polyadenylated tail. the genome is comprised of seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins and three non-structural proteins. genes for the major structural proteins spike (S, 180\u2013220 kDa), membrane (M, 27\u201332 kDa), nucleocaps the porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line is the target cell of PEDV. the epithelial cells in the gut serve as a physical barrier, restricting the movement of components and the passage of potentially harmful microorganisms between the lumen and the underlying mucosa. the expression of PEDV E protein has no effect on cell growth, cell cycle and cyclin A expression in IEC. the cells transfected with the pEGFP-N1-E plasmid and pEGFP-N1-E plasmid expressed an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa and 27 kDa proteins. this is in accord with the predicted size of E protein approximate 8\u20139 kDa. the cells were subjected to Western blot using anti-GFP antibody. PEDV E protein expression caused a slight change in the proportion of cells in each phase. the results suggest that cell proliferation of E expressing cells did not change over a time course. PEDV E protein has no effect on cyclin A expression. cyclin A expression level was slightly changed in cells that expressed E protein compared with control cells. real-time PCR analysis of GRP78 mRNA levels were normalized to the corresponding CT value for porcine -actin mRNA. results are means SD and representative of three independent experiments. expression of PEDV E protein results in the up-regulation of GRP78 and NF-B which suggests the E protein has a role in ER stress activation. PEDV E up-regulates IL-8 expression in IEC cells. IL-8 expression is regulated by activation of NF-B. NF-B activation is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8. real-time PCR analysis of Bcl-2 mRNA levels were normalized to the corresponding CT value for porcine -actin mRNA. the cells transfected with the pEGFP-N1-E plasmid expressed an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa and 27 kDa proteins detected by anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies. PEDV E protein subcellular localization was investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. lots of PEDV E protein was localized in the ER and a little in the nucleus while the control GFP protein was distributed throughout the whole cell. the results suggest that cell proliferation of E expressing cells did not change over a time course. the results show that relative to control cells, PEDV E protein expression caused a slightly change in the proportion of cells in the each phase. the results strongly suggest that PEDV E protein has no effect on cell cycle. western blot with the mouse monoclonal antibodies against NF-B p65 in all cell lines. total RNA was extracted from cells expressing either GFP alone, GFP-E or untransfected cells. an investigation of the transcriptional levels of IL-8 using real-time quantitative PCR found that the mRNA levels of IL-8 in the GFP-E expressing cells is also higher than in the GFP transfected cells and untransfected cells. the results suggest that PEDV E up-regulates IL-8 expression in IECs. the results suggest that PEDV E protein may play a very important role in protecting the host cells from functional damage or apoptosis. the protein was localized in the ER and the nucleus and able to induce ER stress. IL-8 as a pro-inflammatory neutrophil chemotactic factor plays an important role in the promotion of cell survival signaling. PEDV E protein induced ER stress and significantly activated NF-B which consequently caused the promotion of IL-8 expression. the PEDV E protein is able to up-regulate IL-8 expression in IEC. the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression is ascribed to the ER stress response and activation of NF-B which are induced by PEDV E protein. this study provides novel findings for the function of the PEDV E protein. mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was purchased from millipore (USA), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Pierce (Pierce, Rockford, IL, US) the MG132 proteasome inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem (USA) and the nuclear staining dye Hoechst33342 and ER-TrackerTM Red probe were obtained from Invitrogen (USA). IEC cells were seeded into 6-well dishes 24 h before being transfected (up to 70-80% confluence) cells were transfected with pEGFP-E and pEGFP-N1 control vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) and maintained (up to 80-90% confluence) in selection media containing 1200 g/mL G418 for two further weeks. lysates were centrifuged at 12 000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. 100 L of DMSO was read on a microplate reader at appropriate time intervals. the experiments were independently repeated three times. cell cycle analysis was measured by using propidium iodide staining. the cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s. a negative control was included in each run and the specificity of amplification reaction was checked. the relative quantification of gene expression was analyzed by the two-ddCt method as described previously. lisates (50 g total proteins) were incubated in ELISA wells coated with active p65. the colorimetric reaction was measured at 450 nm. MG132 previously found to block IL-8 expression was added after 24 h. the established swine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were cultured as described previously [34]. the established swine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated new born calf serum (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, US) and 100 IU of penicillin. the primers were designed according to the archived PEDV CV777 strain nucleotide sequence (GenBank: AF353511.1) and synthesized by Shanghai Invitrogen (China) the primers were used for the PCR amplification and were designed with 5\u2019 terminal restriction enzyme recognition sites for aid cloning into pEGFP-N1. protein, the stable cell lines expressing GFP-E protein or control cells were grown on glass bottom dishes (35 mm) and washed with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS) cells were then incubated with ER-Tracker Red probe (Invitrogen, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 25 min and then washed with HBSS for twice. images were viewed by laser confocal scanning microscopy. cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at a concentration of 2 103 cells per well in 200 L culture medium. after incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h, the culture medium was carefully replaced with 200 L of a fresh medium. real-time quantitative PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, California, USA) the expression of genes was quantified using a real-time quantitative PCR assay (qRT-PCR) the expression of genes was quantified using a real-time quantitative PCR assay (qRT-PCR) the level of NF-B activity was measured using western blot assay and the NF-B p65 transAM kit (Active Motif) the level of NF-B activity was measured using western blot assay and the NF-B p65 TransAM kit. the concentrations of IL-8 were measured using a swine IL-8 ELISA kit. a value of P 0.05 was considered significant.
