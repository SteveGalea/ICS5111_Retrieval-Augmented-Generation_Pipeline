{"summary": "spread is thought to occur predominantly through close person-to-person contact. this interest has been driven by the role human contact patterns play in determining effectiveness of vaccination and social distancing measures. empirical studies of social mixing specifically targeted at understanding the spread of respiratory infections have been restricted to European countries [6,8], the USA [9], Vietnam [10] and Taiwan [11]. study of human contact patterns in a random sample of communities in and around Guangzhou, china, a city of over 11 million and the capital of Guangdong province. we measured the quantity, duration, age group and distance from home of residence of contacts made by individuals aged 2 years and older. we compare these results with those obtained for other countries. a consenting adult in each household was administered a questionnaire on household composition, demographics, travel by household members, animal ownership and other household information. all questionnaires\u2014household-level, individual-level and contact diaries\u2014were administered as face-to-face interviews. participants could report groups of similarly encountered individuals as a single event involving multiple people, rather than reporting each contact individually. there was no limit to the number of contacts (or contact events) that could be reported, and participants were not aware of how many slots for reporting were available on the questionnaire. contact durations were reported as one of four categories. we summed the duration of each reported contact event to find the total duration of all contacts for each participant. the actual duration of a contact event was considered to be within the reported range or one of the adjacent categories. number of contacts, duration of contact and distance of contacts were analysed using 2-tests. ages were divided into deciles (0\u20139, 10\u201319,..., 80+) and total contact times into hours with upper limits increasing by twofold. a consenting adult in each household was administered a questionnaire on household composition, demographics, travel by household members, animal ownership and other household information. all questionnaires\u2014household-level, individual-level and contact diaries\u2014were administered as face-to-face interviews, with all responses recorded by study researchers. the number of contacts reported should be considered a measure of the number of transmission opportunities that occurred through contact involving face-to-face interaction or touch. participants could report groups of similarly encountered individuals as a single event involving multiple people rather than reporting each contact individually. previous versions of contact diaries with single line entry possibly suffer from the underreporting of contacts. the study staff interviewed participants and used addresses, key locations and landmarks to determine the location (latitude and longitude) of each reported contact. the total number of contacts is likely to be a crude approximation of those encounters\u2019 potential to result in disease transmission. values above one in the mixing matrix indicate more contact than expected between the two age groups, and values below one indicate less contact than expected. results We recruited 1821 participants from 856 households, across 40 communities. number and duration of contacts We find the distribution of number of contacts made has a long right-hand tail. only one participant reported zero contacts during their reporting day. there was no significant difference in the number of contacts when comparing administratively designated rural and urban study locations (p = 0.19) the inset shows the proportional distribution across log-binned durations, by age group. one participant reported zero contacts: they are in the 70-79 year age group. a steady decline in contact duration with increasing age begins as individuals enter their twenties. proportion of number of contacts in household declines with increasing population density. there was no clear trend in the distance from home of non-household contacts. distance kernels for number of contacts and number of contact events. age-based mixing matrices for total number of contacts increase to 1.3 times more than if mixing was random. bluer colours indicate less mixing between age groups than expected by random mixing, and yellower colours indicate more mixing. 95% CIs are shown in parentheses, derived from 1000 re-samples of participant contact diaries. there was no significant difference in the number of contacts when comparing administratively designated rural and urban study locations (p = 0.19) however, differences did exist when locations were stratified by population density (p 0.001). those living in high-density areas made significantly fewer contacts than those living in mid- or low-density areas. groups and a steady decline in contact duration with increasing age. 0\u20139 and 10\u201319 years have a similar distribution of contact durations. household contacts and those encountered most frequently dominate daily contact duration for all age groups. there was no clear trend in the distance from home of non-household contacts. the contacts of participants residing in mid-density locations encountered the furthest distance from home. ages of contacts were only measured in coarse age categories. 95% CIs are shown in parentheses, derived from 1000 re-samples of participant contact diaries. when stratified by whether a contact was made within or outside of the household, assortativity by age increases the further from home contacts are made. age-assortativity in our population follows a similar pattern to that found in Europe and Vietnam [6,10] this may be explained by considering why individuals may travel different distances from home. this may be explained by considering why individuals may travel different distances from home. a higher prevalence of older individuals in these locations may also be evidence of \u2018urban isolation\u2019 in a rapidly developing region of China. the most marked rural\u2013urban differences are found in the locations in which contacts occur, with more contacts occurring within the home in rural areas, but contacts made outside of the home occurring further from the home. study provides an important measure of social contact and travel patterns in a Chinese population specifically aimed at measuring factors related to infectious disease transmission. the patterns seen when only examining numbers of contacts may differ from those seen when considering the duration of contact. funders had no role in study design, data
