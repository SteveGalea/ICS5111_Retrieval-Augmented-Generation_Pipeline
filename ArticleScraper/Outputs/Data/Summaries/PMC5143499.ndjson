{"summary": "despite differences, these theories all share in common the notion that the adaptive value of MDD is to be found in our relationships, but not primarily in our relationships with other people. despite differences, these theories all share in common the notion that the adaptive value of MDD is to be found in its effects on our relationships. the pathogen\u2013host defense theory of depression, or PATHOS-D, has significant differences from a pathogen defense theory of depression. this position overlaps, but has significant differences from a pathogen defense theory of depression first articulated by Kinney and Tanaka, (2009). this position overlaps, but has significant differences from a pathogen defense theory of depression. no adaptive relationship exists between immune changes and depressive symptoms. adaptive benefits of depression exist in non-pathogen/immune-related domains. genetic alleles that promote an inflammatory bias have undergone positive selection because they provided direct pathogen defense. evolutionary forces instantiated a coupling of these behavioral responses with the acute phase response. the pathogen\u2013host theory of depression is consistent with modern risk factors for depressive symptoms, including obesity, processed-food-based diets, sedentary lifestyle and sleep deprivation. a recent meta-analysis found that levels of IL-1- and IL-6 were significantly increased in blood and postmortem brain samples of patients with suicidality compared with non-suicidal depressed patients and healthy control subjects. some studies provide evidence of increased inflammatory activity in the central nervous system of depressed individuals as well. meta-analyses suggest that the best replicated associations between depression and inflammatory biomarkers are increases in circulating levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6. IL-1- features so prominently in both the inflammatory response and in animal studies of stress, and depression-like behavior. cross-sectional associations between MDD and inflammation do not establish that immune system activity is capable of producing depression. it might well be that mental states can increase inflammation, but it is equally true that activation of the body's inflammatory response system can induce depression. this has been shown in studies examining the acute behavioral and CNS responses to a single exposure to endotoxin or typhoid vaccine. increased inflammatory activity has been the most replicated immune change associated with MDD, but there is no reason why this should be the only adaptive immune pattern associated with depression that enhanced pathogen\u2013host defense. a clear prediction of PATHOS-D theory is that as novel innate immune anti-pathogenic mechanisms are identified, they will be found to be enhanced in depressed individuals. stress has been repeatedly associated with other immune changes seen in MDD. a number of these factors, such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle and processed foods, are artifacts of modern lifestyles. at least two proinflammatory risk factors for MDD may well have evolved to activate depression. the TSST activates key intracellular inflammatory transcription pathways (eg, nuclear factor-kappa (NF-B)) within peripheral blood mononuclear cells and dramatically increases circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines. individuals with known risk factors for developing depression show larger inflammatory responses to laboratory psychosocial stressors than others. stress perception by the brain may serve as an early warning signal to activate the immune system in preparation for a markedly increased likelihood of subsequent infection. chronic stress is best known to suppress certain aspects of immune function (ie, natural killer cell activity, circulating T-cell subsets; Herbert and Cohen, 1993c), the types of acute and/or psychosocial stressors most likely to be associated with immediate risk of wounding and hence infection activate both innate and adaptive immunity. a repeated social defeat stress paradigm (SDR) has shown that stress primes multiple aspects of the rodent host defense repertoire. stress-induced activation of inflammation provides pre-potent protection against pathogens. individuals with high trait sensitivity to social disconnection produce greater blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6) and increased expression of inflammatory genes in response to an endotoxin stimulus. study participants who responded to an fMRI-based social exclusion paradigm with greater activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula responded to a psychosocial stress test with increased salivary production of the inflammatory biomarker soluble TNF- type II receptor. ostracized mothers would have been less likely to survive than ostracized fathers. the increased balance of antiviral to anti-bacterial/inflammatory gene expression seen in more socially integrated individuals would have been more optimal for providing protection against more recent viral infections that spread from person to person. the association should be ancient, because it is this immune response and its associated depressive symptoms that enhanced survival and reproduction via reduced pathogen-related mortality. the link between chronic inflammation and MDD may not reflect an evolved adaption, but rather represents an example of non-adaptive environmental mismatch, defined as a state of disequilibrium. of all the modern environmental conditions that have altered associations between immune function and behavior, none has received more attention than our changed relationships with a huge range of microorganisms. evolutionary mismatch model suggests the link between depression and immune activation reflects the failure of the modern world to honor ancient and mutually beneficial collaborations. the strongest data that support evolutionary mismatch come from the ground-breaking work of colleagues who have examined associations between stress, mood and inflammation in non-industrialized environments. levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were significantly lower than are typically observed in western contexts. in lowland Ecuador, levels of CRP were found to vary widely within the same individuals, showing a pattern of rapid rise to high levels in response to acute infection and then dropping to often undetectable levels upon infection resolution. a depressive syndrome identical to that seen in the industrialized world exists among the Tsimane. it is associated with the same risk factors that have been observed everywhere else in the world: reduced health (indexed as functional disability) and psychosocial stress (indexed by social conflict, especially with non-kin; Stieglitz et al, 2015a) a subset of patients with MDD demonstrate increased inflammation implies the hypothesis that if depression is associated with increased inflammation then increased inflammatory activity should have produced an overall survival benefit in high-pathogen ancient environments. if depression is associated with increased inflammation, then increased inflammatory activity should have produced an overall survival benefit in high-pathogen ancient environments. inflammation is essential for human health and a necessary ingredient of our ability to adequately fight infections. studies have found that the relationship between the innate and acquired immune systems follows the laws of cooperation and competition that define all evolved relationships. chronic inflammation can actually suppress T- and B-cell function through various mechanisms. more definitive evidence for this possibility comes from a second study. a haplotype of IL-10 gene associated with increased inflammation was found to be significantly more prevalent in populations that relied on river water than in populations that drank from boreholes. inin found that Tsimane individuals with high levels of depression produced greater levels of IL-1-, IL-6, and TNF in response to both endotoxin and PHA. this pattern is different from suppression of mitogen-stimulated immune responses commonly observed in depressed patients in the western world. if increased mitogen-stimulated inflammatory cytokine response would translate to enhanced protection against pathogens remains unknown. the 1082G allele predicts increased symptom severity and mortality in the context of community acquired pneumonia (Gallagher et al, 2003) it is associated with reduced antibody responses to tetanus, influenza and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines. the association of depression with increased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and CRP does not lend itself to social explanations for the high prevalence of either MDD or putative depressogenic risk alleles. if this is true, why should we expect the immune changes seen in depression to be limited to circulating cytokines or CRP\" a comprehensive vision of the APR sees some of its elements as serving direct anti-pathogen functions (eg, leukocytosis), some as serving to reallocate energy to the immune system (eg, psychomotor slowing, somnolence) and some as serving 'immune brinkmanship' functions. medically healthy individuals demonstrate multiple biological and behavioral stigmata of an APR. psychological stress has also been reported to elevate core body temperature in animals and humans. stress-induced hypoferremia and hyperthermia are associated with stress-induced increases in IL-6. stress-induced hypoferremia and hyperthermia are associated with stress-induced increases in IL-6. if inflammation induces sickness, inflammation might be expected to be more strongly associated with the symptoms most often shared by sickness and depression. if inflammation induces sickness, inflammation might be expected to be more strongly associated with the symptoms most often shared by sickness and depression, rather than symptoms such as sadness and guilt/feelings of worthlessness. if MDD is conceptualized as a condition evolved from, and \u2018designed' to serve the same purposes as, sickness, the obvious question is what pathogen-related survival and reproductive benefits accrue from depressive symptoms. the costs across evolutionary time of the types of prolonged sickness behaviors that comprise MDD have also likely been substantial. genes that contribute to MDD have been retained across hominid evolution. in response to stress, depression provides an adaptive advantage for individuals at increased risk of infection as a result of immune functioning that for one reason or other is sub-optimal. in response to stress, depression can be seen as proactive physiological/behavioral sickness behavior. ad et al, 2011 characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, social avoidance, and anorexia. this state is an integral component of depressive disorders and has been widely considered to develop in the context of infection and/or tissue injury as a means of marshalling limited metabolic resources for the expensive tasks of immune activation, fever generation and tissue repair. a clear prediction is that viewing images of depressed individuals should activate the immune system. a decrement in survival from depression-induced loss of social aid might have been offset by reduced risk of exposure to other pathogens while in a vulnerable state due to a pre-existing infection. social withdrawal and reduced environmental exploration might also have promoted individual survival. inflammatory conditions typically strike after the age of reproduction. alleles that promote them are subject to minimal selective pressure, even in modern environments. the association between chronic inflammation and these disease states serves no adaptive purpose. a proximal answer might point to the fact that mania is associated with many of the same neuroendocrine abnormalities as depression, especially glucocorticoid resistance. full manic episodes have been reported during IFN- therapy. however, this type of answer provides no insight into why mania should be associated with increased inflammation. a previous study used sparse whole-genome sequencing in a population of Han Chinese females to identify and replicate two novel depression risk loci on chromosome 10, one 5\u2032 to the suirtuin 1 (SIRT1) gene (rs12415800) and one in an intron of the phospholysine phospho-histadine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP) gene (consortium C (2015)) /p65 activity represses cyclooxygenase 2 gene expression. /p65 activity induces gene silencing facultative heterochomatin formation. sirtuin 1, in dependence on NAD+, increases levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1. sirtuin 1 blockade has been shown to reduce bacterial load and enhance survival. sirtuin-deficient mice have been shown to demonstrate improved intestinal anti-bacterial defense mechanisms. sirtuin 1 also appears to be essential for optimal immune clearance of respiratory syncytial virus. signaling in the hippocampus appears to have antidepressant effects. pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of hippocampal SIRT1 function increases depression-like behaviors in response to stress. SIRT1 activation blocks both the development of depression-related phenotypes and aberrant dendritic structures. IES PATHOS-D proposes that depression risk alleles have been maintained in the human genome. a primary problem that this theory shares with other adaptive explanations for depression is that to date no incontrovertible risk alleles for MDD have been identified. many large GWAS have failed to find SNPs that meet genome-wide significance. a PATHOS-D perspective suggests that understanding the specific histories of shared and unique co-evolved pathogen\u2013host interactions within and across human societies will be essential for enhancing our understanding of why genotype\u2013phenotype associations observed in one population do or do not replicate across other populations. the association between SIR1 nor LHPP SNPs and MDD identified in Han Chinese females was not replicated in European populations. the clear prediction of PATHOS-D would be that alleles that confer depression risk should either increase inflammatory signaling more in the population in which they confer risk. a PATHOS-D perspective would predict that individuals from cultures with higher rates of historical exposure to lethal viral pandemics should respond to treatment with IFN- with increased rates of depression development. 2% of the DNA of non-African humans derives from multiple bouts of interbreeding with Neanderthals. current melanesian populations also show a Denisovan genetic inheritance from ancestral interbreeding with that group of now-extinct archaic humans. however, other archaic sequences appear to have undergone positive selection. three epidemiological features of MDD relate directly to sex. females are approximately twice as likely as males to suffer from MDD. this imbalance is most pronounced during the reproductive years. PATHOS-D theory predicts that this association should less prominent in females who effectively \u2018replaced' inflammation with depression-based behavioral pathogen avoidance. females respond to an injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with an increase in depression and feelings of social isolation, both of which are correlated with amount of cytokine response to the LPS in females. a significant minority of depressed individuals manifest hypersomnia and hyperphagia instead. cytokine pathways known to be activated by infection are capable of producing both hypersomnia and hyperphagia. female rodents have less anorexia than males in response to influenza infection. study suggests stressors associated with high degree of wounding induce hypothalamic resistance to leptin. cytokines can induce hyperphagia/weight gain under certain circumstances. younger individuals in general, and females in particular, are more likely to develop depressive conditions characterized by hypersomnia and hyperphagia. in hunter-gatherer societies youth and females are frequently more protected from predation and to have food supplied to them by others. depression and anxiety are highly comorbid, and activation of the inflammatory response produces both types of symptoms. in both animals and humans, activation of the inflammatory response produces both types of symptoms. evolutionary logic may have dictated that inflammatory processes could have promoted hypervigilant behavior, which would nonetheless have served adaptive purposes by protecting against environmental dangers engendered by sickness. a recent study found no difference between males and females in the severity of anxiety symptoms induced by low-dose endotoxin. a recent large cohort study reported that peripheral inflammatory biomarkers were more strongly associated with anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in males than in females. maternal depression may contribute to the child's pathogen\u2013host defense prospects. parental investment theory postulates that parents reduce their care for, and involvement with offspring when the costs of such care and involvement outweigh the benefits. if PPD is associated with behavioral or immune changes that might actually help infant survival. a japanese study found PPD-induced maternal withdrawal may have decreased the risk of infant infection in circumstances when the maternal depression resulted from pathogen-induced cytokine activation. it is also intriguing to speculate that PPD might influence the composition of breast milk in ways that might aid nursing infants in avoiding or surviving infection. a testable explanation for why depression is so common in females of reproductive age. compared with men, females respond to an injection of lipopolysaccharide with an increase in depression and feelings of social isolation. females are more likely than males to develop depression in response to chronic inflammatory stimulation resulting from treatment with the cytokine IFN-. females mounted an enhanced proinflammatory cytokine response to low-dose endotoxin when compared with men, while showing no difference in inflammation-induced mood or anxiety symptoms. hypersomnia has been recognized for years as a primary behavioral manifestation of proinflammatory cytokines. studies in healthy adolescents and adults indicate chronically increased sleep is associated with increased saliva and blood concentrations of IL-6 and CRP. preclinical studies suggest stressors associated with a high degree of wounding induce hypothalamic resistance to leptin. increased peripheral leptin levels (consistent with leptin resistance) have been observed more consistently in females than in males with MDD. gene associated with increased inflammatory signaling might boost host defense. depression and anxiety are highly comorbid. inflammation produces changes in brain function that subserve conservation-withdrawal symptoms likely to aid in defense against pathogens. males should respond to immune challenges/inflammatory activation with increased ratio of hypervigilant to conservation-withdrawal symptoms. a recent study found no difference between males and females in the severity of anxiety symptoms induced by low-dose endotoxin. inflammatory biomarkers were more strongly associated with anxiety symptoms. maternal depression in postpartum period is associated with short- and long-term adverse consequences for the affected offspring. the question of why the condition is so common is especially pressing. the question of why the condition is so common is especially pressing. if PPD is associated with behavioral or immune changes that might actually help infant survival is a question that to our knowledge has never been examined. a japanese study found that PPD may influence the composition of breast milk in ways that might aid nursing infants in avoiding or surviving infection. reduced levels of TGF- have been associated with increased symptom severity in children infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Chaiyaroj et al, 2004; Rovira-Vallbona et al, 2012) the provision of increased TGF-2 in breast milk from depressed mothers might confer some protection against malaria.
