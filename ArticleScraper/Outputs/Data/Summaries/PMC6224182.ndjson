{"summary": "Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), the largest memory T cell subset, are non-recirculating cells parked in nonlymphoid and lymphoid tissues. the importance of CD8 TRM cells in limiting infections, their distinct transcriptional profile, and their ability to control reinfections at mucosal portals of pathogen entry are well documented. cer agents, JCPyV can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. an acknowledged impediment to understanding PML pathogenesis is the absence of tractable animal models. astrocytes/oligodendrocytes engrafted in brains of immune and myelin deficient (RAG2-/-MBPshi/shi) mice support JCPyV replication. CD8 T cells in the CNS of mice inoculated intracerebrally with a mouse coronavirus had reduced IFN- and granzyme B expression, impaired viral control, disrupted memory differentiation, and increased apoptosis [21\u201323]. CD4 T cell help to CD8 T cells and B cells is also pivotal in the control of measles virus encephalitis [24, 25]. d organs fail to generate an anti-MuPyV CD8 T cell response [31]. unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells infiltrated the brain and failed to control virus. maintenance of unhelped CD8 T cells required resupply from CD8 T cells in the vasculature. CD4 T cell-sufficient mice showed similar frequency and number of CD8 T cells specific for the dominant DbLT359 epitope in both the brain and spleen in acutely [day 8 post-infection (p.i.)] and persistently (day 30 p.i.) in either CD4 T cell-sufficient or\u2013deficient mice. CD4 T cell availability did not affect the pattern of effector/memory differentiation of MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells in either the brain or spleen based on surface co-expression of KLRG1 and CD127. Fig 1. Number and frequency of CD44hi DbLT359 tetramer+ CD8 T cells in brain (A) and spleen (B) during acute (day 8 p.i.) infection. fewer unhelped and unhelped DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells produced IFN- in persistently infected mice. aided and unhelped CD8 T cells in the brain had similar sensitivity to antigen stimulation, as evidenced by the expression of IRF4. a significant decrease in IFN- (P = 0.0002) and CXCL9 (P = 0.0003) mRNA between days 8 and 30 p.i. there was a significant decrease in IFN- (P = 0.0002) and mRNA between days 8 and 30 p.i. CD4 T cells showed a transient 4-fold increase in TGF- mRNA compared to unstimulated CD4 T cells. IL-21 has also been associated with establishing CD8 TRM. unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells had higher PD-1 expression. SD of 8\u201312 mice per group from 3 independent experiments (A-D) or 6\u201310 mice per group from 3 independent experiments (E). i.p. administration of a depleting CD4 mAb led to a dramatic decline in numbers of CD4 T cells in the brain. CD4 T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice had similar frequencies of DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells in the brain 30 days after rVSV-LT359 intranasal (i.n.) inoculation. this result confirms that of wakim et al. who found no differences in antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses between WT and CD4 T cell-deficient mice. LT359 tetramer+ CD8 T cells from brains 30 days post-VSV infection. gMFI of PD-1 expression on DbLT359 tetramer+ CD8 T cells. mean SD of 3\u20134 mice per group from 2 independent experiments. no difference in the ratio of extravascular to intravascular total and virus-specific CD8 T cells was seen between helped and unhelped mice. bTRM become dependent on hematogenous replenishment in the absence of CD4 T cell help. the frequency of IFN-+ CD8 T cells upon ex vivo LT359 peptide stimulation was lower in rechallenged CD4 T cell-deficient than -sufficient mice. a significantly higher fraction of CD103+ than CD103- cells produced IFN- upon reinfection. this defect was not due to a decrease in CD103- cells in brain. ns = not significant, *P0.05,***P0.001, Two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test (B-F) and one-way ANOVA (G,H) absence of virus-neutralizing antibodies may be associated with increased viral burden, with the consequent high antigen levels driving virus-specific T cell exhaustion. despite a decrease in VP1 IgG titers in CD4 T cell-depleted mice at day 30 p.i., sera from CD4 T cell-deficient and -sufficient mice exhibited strong virus-neutralization capability during acute and persistent infection. IFN-+, IFN- + TNF-+, and IFN- + TNF-+ IL-2+ CD44hi CD8 T cells from brains 5 days post rechallenge stimulated ex vivo with LT359 peptide. real-time PCR analysis of viral genome copies from brain five days post rechallenge. only 73 transcripts were differentially expressed between helped CD103- and CD103+ CD8 T cells. these transcriptomes were substantially different from the transcriptomes of MHC II-/--CD103- cells. findings support evidence caution is warranted when considering CD103 as a stereotypical marker of TRM differentiation. ide pathways have been reported to promote exhaustion and senescence of CD8 T cells. MHCII-/--CD103- CD8 T cells differentially expressed genes involved in mitochondrial function. mitochondrial dysfunction is highly prevalent in CD8 T cells isolated from HIV+ patients. ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed transcripts between MHCII-/--CD103- and CD103-. Y-axis represents pathway and X-axis represents enrichment factor. blue labels indicate upregulated pathways with a cut-off z score 2.0. the number of total and virus-specific CD8 T cells and the gMFI of CD8 on the MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells were significantly reduced in CD4 T cell-deficient mice. the number of unhelped DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells was not significantly different between CD4 T cell-sufficient and -deficient mice. CD4 T cells are dispensable for the recruitment, maintenance, and function of brain-infiltrating muPyV-specific CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells were depleted by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CD4 mAb before muPyV infection and weekly thereafter until endpoint. number of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the brain did not significantly change between days 8 and 30 p.i. in either CD4 T cell-sufficient or\u2013deficient mice. unhelped muPyV-specific CD8 T cells in the brain proliferated similarly as compared to helped CD8 T cells. independent confirmation of these results was made using MHC II-/- mice inoculated i.c. with MuPyV. CD44hi DbLT359 tetramer+ in brain (C) and spleen (D) during persistent (day 30 p.i.) infection in WT and MHCII-/- mice. similar numbers of helped and unhelped DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells produced IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2. unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells in the brain remain functional. number of IFN-+, IFN- + TNF-+, and IFN- + TNF-+ IL-2+ CD44hi CD8 T cells from brain at days 8 and 30 p.i. significant decrease in number of IFN-+ CD107+ (P0.0001) and Granzyme B+ (P0.0001) between days 8 and 30 p.i. bLT359-tetramer+ CD8 T cells in the brain express CD103 in persistently infected mice. few CD103+ muPyV-specific CD8 T cells were detected in the brain 30 days after muPyV inoculation. these cells expressed CD69 at levels similar to those in CD4 T cell-sufficient mice. brain-resident CD8 and CD4 T cells during muPyV encephalitis showed a dichotomy in their dependence on cells in the circulation. i.p. administration of a depleting CD4 mAb led to a dramatic decline in CD4 T cells in the brain. in CD4 T cell-sufficient mice, depletion of circulating CD8 T cells had no effect on number of total CD8 T cells or DbLT359-specific CD8 T cells in the brain at day 30 p.i.. a differential dependence of CD4 T cell help on development of CD8 bTRM may depend on the type of viral infection. CD4 T cell-depleted mice showed low levels of VSV gRNA. a previous study reported persistent VSV gRNA after i.n. infection. but no VSV mRNA at the same time point [41]. unhelped virus-specific CD8 T cells expressed adhesion molecules VLA-4, PSGL1 and LFA-1, suggesting that CD4 T cell availability did not alter the ability of these cells to home to and traffic into the infected brain. no difference in extravascular to intravascular total and virus-specific CD8 T cells was seen between helped and unhelped mice. mice were depleted of circulating CD4 T cells before i.c. inoculation. then reinfected i.c. with MuPyV at day 30 p.i. at day 5 after reinfection. viral load was significantly higher in CD4 T cell-deficient mice. CD103- DbLT359 tetramer+ CD8 T cells produced IFN- upon reinfection. this defect was not due to a decrease in CD103- cells in brain. without rechallenge, CD103- T cells from CD4 T cell -sufficient and -deficient mice have similar IFN-eYFP production to CD103+ CD8 T cells. cells 30 days p.i. Mean SD of 9\u201310 mice per group from 3 independent experiments (A-F) or 8 mice per group from two independent experiments (G, H) absence of virus-neutralizing antibodies may be associated with increased viral burden. influenza virus infection also generates a T cell-independent influenza-specific IgG that helps resolve primary influenza infection. MHCII-/- and WT mice with and without mAb VP1 treatment possessed similar virus-neutralization capabilities. virus-specific antibodies did not rescue the unhelped CD8 T cell response. CD4 T cells were sorted from brains of persistently infected mice. 377 transcripts were differentially expressed between CD103- and CD103- CD8 T cells. 267 transcripts were differentially expressed between helped CD103- and CD103+ CD8 T cells. MHCII-/--CD103- CD8 T cells had downregulated RhoA signaling. MHCII-/--CD103- CD8 T cells also showed upregulation of phosphoinositide pathways. mitochondrial dysfunction is highly prevalent in CD8 T cells isolated from HIV+ patients. red represents differentially expressed transcripts over the cut-off of a q-value 0.05 (y-axis represents -log10[q-value]) and the X-axis represents the fold change. i.c. inoculated mice at days 30\u201340 p.i. cells significantly declined in the brain with systemic anti-CD4 depletion. no difference was seen in the number of virus-specific CD8 T cells or viral load in the brain with delayed CD4 T cell depletion. there was a significant increase in CD103+ CD8 T cells in rats IgG-treated mice between days 8 and 30 p.i. there was a significant increase in CD103+ CD8 T cells (p = 0.0132) in rats IgG-treated mice between days 8 and 30 p.i. CD4 T cells guided the differentiation of muPyV-specific CD8 bTRM during navet cell priming. insufficiency resulted in diminished effector competence of antiviral CD8 bTRM. an ongoing dependence on CD4 T cells for induction and maintenance of virus-specific CD8 bTRM to a persistent CNS infection has clear clinical implications for individuals whose immune status is altered. JCPyV VP1/LT-specific CD8 T cell adoptive immunotherapy in a PML patient drove viral DNA below PCR detectability in the CSF and improved neurological status. preserving and augmenting anti-JCPyV CD4 T cells or providing \u201chelper\u201d cytokines in PML-susceptible individuals could promote differentiation of brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells into CD8 bTRM. pathway analyses point toward significant defects in cell migration by unhelped CD8 T cells. depressed functional integrity of unhelped CD8 T cells may necessitate resupply of new effector T cells from the circulation. CD4 and CD8 T cells were primed and recruited to the CNS. these studies demonstrate that the nature of CD4 T cell help is dynamic. cytopathic and non-cytopathic effector mechanisms control infections in the CNS. fewer than half of muPyV-specific CD8 T cells express CD103. fewer than half express CD103, an E integrin that pairs with 7 to bind E-cadherin. role of CD103 in maintaining TRM appears to vary between tissues. CD8 bTRM applies to both muPyV and VSV encephalitis. an intact systemic CD4 T cell compartment is essential for preserving a steady-state d\u00e9tente between CD8 bTRM and persistent viral infection in the CNS. mice were infected intracerebrally (i.c.) with 3x105 PFU MuPyV.A2 in 30 l at day 0, re-inoculated i.c. with 3x105 PFU MuPyV.A2 in 30 l at day 0, then euthanized 4\u20135 days later. mice were injected with 250 g rat anti-CD4 or 250 g rat anti-CD8. animals were injected with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences) through the tail vein three minutes before the brains were excised. cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), APC-DbLT359 tetramers (NIH Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA) for intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized and fixed in FoxP3 buffer fixation lymphocytes were isolated from brain and spleen, cultured in DMEM/10% FBS for 5 h at 37\u00b0C with or without 1 M LT359 peptide. intracellular staining included anti-IFN- (clone XMG1.2; Biolegend), anti-TNF- (clone XMG1.2; Biolegend), anti-IL-2 (clone JES6-5H4, Biolegend), anti-CD107a (clon samples were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa or BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software. anti-VP1 ELISA and antibody neutralization muPyV major capsid protein VP1-specific ELISA were performed as described. cDNA was prepared using random primers and RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase Enzyme.

JCPyV VP1/LT-specific CD8 T cell adoptive immunotherapy in a PML patient drove viral DNA below PCR detectability in the CSF and improved neurological status. preserving and augmenting anti-JCPyV CD4 T cells or providing \u201chelper\u201d cytokines in PML-susceptible individuals could promote differentiation of brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells into CD8 bTRM. pathway analyses point toward significant defects in cell migration by unhelped CD8 T cells. depressed functional integrity of unhelped CD8 T cells may necessitate resupply of new effector T cells from the circulation. CD4 and CD8 T cells were primed and recruited to the CNS. these studies demonstrate that the nature of CD4 T cell help is dynamic. cytopathic and non-cytopathic effector mechanisms control infections in the CNS. fewer than half of muPyV-specific CD8 T cells express CD103. fewer than half express CD103, an E integrin that pairs with 7 to bind E-cadherin. role of CD103 in maintaining TRM appears to vary between tissues. CD8 bTRM applies to both muPyV and VSV encephalitis. an intact systemic CD4 T cell compartment is essential for preserving a steady-state d\u00e9tente between CD8 bTRM and persistent viral infection in the CNS. mice were infected intracerebrally (i.c.) with 3x105 PFU MuPyV.A2 in 30 l at day 0, re-inoculated i.c. with 3x105 PFU MuPyV.A2 in 30 l at day 0, then euthanized 4\u20135 days later. mice were injected with 250 g rat anti-CD4 or 250 g rat anti-CD8. animals were injected with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences) through the tail vein three minutes before the brains were excised. cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), APC-DbLT359 tetramers (NIH Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA) for intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized and fixed in FoxP3 buffer fixation lymphocytes were isolated from brain and spleen, cultured in DMEM/10% FBS for 5 h at 37\u00b0C with or without 1 M LT359 peptide. intracellular staining included anti-IFN- (clone XMG1.2; Biolegend), anti-TNF- (clone XMG1.2; Biolegend), anti-IL-2 (clone JES6-5H4, Biolegend), anti-CD107a (clon samples were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa or BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software. anti-VP1 ELISA and antibody neutralization muPyV major capsid protein VP1-specific ELISA were performed as described. cDNA was prepared using random primers and RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase Enzyme.
