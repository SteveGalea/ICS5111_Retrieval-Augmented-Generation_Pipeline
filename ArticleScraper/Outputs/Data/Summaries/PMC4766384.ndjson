{"summary": "the CDC PUI case definition includes epidemiologic and clinical criteria. the real-time log of cases maintained by the physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic was supplemented by querying infectious diseases and ED staff for all PUI evaluated. outpatients who met criteria for PUI were triaged to the tropical medicine clinic, ED, or ETU for further management. people under investigation for EVD were triaged to the ED if they required evaluation outside of clinic hours, reported \u201cwet\u201d symptoms or had any medical indication for ED-level care. infection prevention precautions and personal protective equipment were used as per CDC recommendations for PUI [17]. however, whether or not to maintain enhanced levels of isolation for hospitalized PUI was determined on a case-by-case basis. non-Ebola diagnostic tests were performed at the discretion of the physician. laboratory testing was performed in the routine clinical laboratory of EHC. suspicion of EVD was low (after consideration of presenting symptoms and epidemiologic risk level) tests were performed at a specialized isolation laboratory located in the ETU. data collected for this study included demographic information, purpose of travel, travel history, vaccination history, malaria prophylaxis use, presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory test results, and final diagnosis. the purpose of antecedent travel was categorized into 1 of 4 groups: Ebola outbreak response, business travel, visiting friends and relatives in the affected country (VFR), or immigration to the united states. most patients were evaluated in either the outpatient tropical medicine clinic (48%) or the ED (40%), and the majority had symptoms for 1 day or less (67%) none of the patients reported direct contact with a patient with EVD within the prior 21 days. one patient initially evaluated in the tropical medicine clinic and discharged with home quarantine was re-evaluated at our ETU for Ebola testing 2 days later. twenty patients presented with fever (80%) (Table 3) none of the patients presented with hemorrhagic symptoms. none of the patients presented with hemorrhagic symptoms. the patients with malaria and DKA were among the 6 who were hospitalized. three of the hospitalized patients had EVD testing before admission. the remaining were determined not to need EVD testing due to a low suspicion of EVD. five patients (20%) had acute diarrhea with a confirmed or unconfirmed cause. none of the patients had EVD, and an alternative etiologic diagnosis was established in most. a key challenge of evaluating ill persons with possible EVD results from the many other infectious diseases. the CDC case definition for persons under investigation for EVD was appropriately sensitive, given the nonspecific initial symptoms of EVD and potentially severe consequences of undiagnosed EVD for patients and staff. the screening and triage protocols that were implemented in our EDs and clinics [14\u201316] were critical for the prompt identification and management of these patients. influenza is among the most common vaccine-preventable travel-related infections among international travelers. the 2014\u20132015 influenza season peaked locally in the Atlanta area in December [22] and influenza A contributed to the peak of PUI evaluated during that month. FR travelers often does not seek pretravel advice despite increased risk of travel-related infectious diseases. our findings are subject to a few limitations. it is possible that some patients may not have been identified as PUI. PUI are restricted from using public means of transportation. the transport of PUI also presented challenges when patients lacked personal means of transport. regular practice drills and tabletop exercises were important to train staff."}
