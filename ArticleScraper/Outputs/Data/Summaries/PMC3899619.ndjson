{"summary": "132 human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) had been reported in 10 Chinese cities. on 17 May 2013, a chicken infection with H7 subtype avian influenza virus was detected in Guanzhou. the study identified attitudes, practices and information needs among employees of food production and operation. a novel strain of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was detected in humans in Shanghai, eastern China. the virus had never been reported in humans, and the world health organization is taking this novel strain seriously. most H7N9 patients have presented with respiratory tract infection with progression to severe pneumonia and breathing difficulties. chicken samples from a poultry market tested positive for H7 subtype avian influenza virus. this led to Guangzhou being the 11th city in china to conduct emergency response operations related to novel influenza A (H7N9) the centrally-located Guangzhou CDC health examination center is the largest. subjects were interviewed face-to-face to complete a three-page questionnaire. the questionnaire was amended to create a final version of the questionnaire. each of these six items was phrased as a statement, with response options \u201cagree\u201d and \u201cdisagree\u201d. participants were asked to report any information needs or concerns if large numbers of human infections with H7N9 cases emerge. sex, age, household income, educational level, marital status, birthplace, living area, and length of time live in Guangzhou. data analysis Epi InfoTM 7.1.0.6 was used for data entry, cleaning, and initial analysis. descriptive statistics, such as percentages, means, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. the centrally-located Guangzhou CDC health examination center is the largest. subjects were recruited by convenience sampling from the CDC health examination hall. each interview lasted about 20 minutes. practices Participants were asked 10 questions about their recent practices. one question was \u201cdo you believe that government can control the H7N9 epidemic\u201d with response options of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. a free statistical software package was used for data entry, cleaning, and initial analysis. descriptive statistics, such as percentages, means, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. a 2 test and/or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to compare proportions of different groups. the majority of participants (69.72%) worried about being infected with the A/H7N9. the majority of participants (69.72%) reported their opinions on H7N9 information. more than a fifth (20.28%) reported \u201cnot timely enough\u201d and 20.76% thought \u201csome information was intentionally concealed by the government\u201d a total of 64.48% of participants chose \u201csatisfied\u201d, \u201cmore satisfied\u201d or \u201cvery satisfied\u201d (Table 2). practices after the emergence of H7N9, 74.41% of participants said they had searched for information about H7N9. most common method of obtaining information was \u201cuse internet\u201d (76.92%) followed by \u201cwatch TV\u201d (67.56%), and \u201cread newspaper\u201d (56.26%). females and older are more likely to choose \u201cwatch TV\u201d and \u201cread newspaper\u201d (P 0.05). 729 67.56 231 (62.94%) 498 (69.94%) 5.41 0.02* 511 (65.26%) 183 (74.09%) 35 (71.43%) 7.02 0.03* Read newspaper 607 56.26

ventilating rooms more frequently than before. nearly half (48.76%) cancelled or postponed social events because of A/H7N9. the high proportion of participants indicating a willingness to receive H7N9 vaccine bodes well for influenza prevention through vaccination in Guangzhou. the primary reason for unwillingness to accept a vaccine was concern about the safety of the new vaccine. a similar finding was also observed during the pH1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. international studies assessing willingness to receive the pH1N1 vaccine indicated rates that ranged from 36.9% [26] to 49.6% [27]. however, national data from australia collected in November and December 2009 showed that there had only been a 14% uptake of the vaccine [28]. this is similar to Aihua et al., who reported that during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the public's primary concern was effective and easy-to-operate preventive measures [29 the majority of participants took initiative to find information about H7N9. the internet, television, and newspapers were the main methods of obtaining information. the methods differed by sex, age, and other demographic variables. authors declare that they have no
