{"summary": "reverse vaccinology is an emerging vaccine development approach. it starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by bioinformatics analysis. it takes less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered in the past 40 years by conventional methods. more and more genomes are now available for each pathogenic species. it is now required to examine all completed genomes and predict vaccine targets that are conserved in all genomes. predicted vaccine targets are those that exist in genomes of virulent pathogen strains but are absent from avirulent strains. many databases of MHC-binding peptides have been developed for use with matrices and neural network-based epitope prediction tools. UPEC is the most common cause of community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) over half (53%) of all women (and 14% of men) experience at least one urinary tract infection. strains were isolated from human cases of cystitis, pyelonephritis and/or bacteremia. these provide a basis for predicting UPEC vaccine targets using these genome sequences based on reverse vaccinology. vaccine targets predicted based on genome analysis largely correlate with the results obtained from these high throughput data analyses. helix topology analysis is performed using optimized HMMTOP. the resulting PROFtmb method reaches an overall four-state (up-, down-strand, periplasmic-,and outer-loop) accuracy as high as 86%. the probability of being an adhesin has a default cut-off of 0.51. the prediction of peptide binders to MHC class I or II is calculated based on a position-based weighting method. data for generating the PSSMs came from known epitope data from the IEDB immune epitope database [27]. a leave-one-out approach was applied to test if a known epitope can be predicted. four UPEC strains with fully sequenced genomes were used. strains CFT073 (RefSeq ID: NC_004431), 536 (NC_008253), UTI89 (NC_007946), and F11 (NZ_AAJU00000000). to determine whether predicted antigens exist in UPEC strains but not in non-pathogenic E. coli. Vaxign integrates open source tools and internally developed programs with user-friendly web interfaces. input data for Vaxign execution are amino acid sequences from one protein or whole genomes. orthoMCL is used to calculate homology between predicted sequences and all proteins in a specified non-pathogenic strain genome(s) vaxign uses an internally developed program Vaxitope to predict MHC class I and class II-binding epitopes. two servers run the Redhat Linux operating system (Redhat Enterprise Linux ES 5) users can submit database or analysis queries through the web. these queries are then processed using PHP/HTML/SQL against a MySQL relational database (back-end, database server), or executed in runtime based on the Vaxign algorithm pipeline. the result of each query is then presented to the user in the web browser (Figure 1). /J mice were intranasally immunized with individual proteins combined with cholera toxin. control and vaccinated mice were transurethrally challenged with 5 108 CFU E. coli CFT073. the vaccine challenge experiments were reported in a recent publication. adherence of microbial pathogens to host cells is mediated by adhesins. the conserved vaccine targets among different strains in one pathogen offer protection against these different strains. a vaccine candidate with similar sequence to the host is likely to be a poor immunogen due to epitope mimicry, or if an immune response is triggered, cause autoimmunity in the host. Vaxitope predicts both MHC class I and class II binding epitopes. a Tyr-Trp substitution at position A of an alignment receives the same score no matter at what position it occurs. a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was generated for prediction of epitopes against 40 MHC class I or II alleles. the ROC analysis detects the ability of predictions to classify each predicted epitope peptide into MHC class I or II binding based on its comparison with existing epitope database [40]. a ROC curve based on Vaxign analysis was generated using HLA A*0201 specific PSSM (Figure 2). itivity (P =.01) Specificity (P =.05) Sensitivity (P =.05) Specificity (P =.1) 1 HLA-A*0101 9 0.871.298.956.531.876.792.783 3 HLA-A*0201 10 0.868.505.9.915.706.988.554 12 HLA-A*1101.773 4 HLA-A*0202 9 0.867.317.963.691.827.834.712 8 HLA 9 0.863.337.946.672.833.859.71 13 HLA-A*1101 10 0.879.461.924.9.742.989.627 14 HLA-A*2402 9 0.984.727.985.97.879 1.783 15 HLA-A*3101 9 0.912.426.952.813.872.927.752 16 HLA-A*3101 10 0.855.419.905.889.711.99.563 17 HLA-A HLA-B*1501 9 0.873.514.927.816.765.939.603 26 HLA-B*3501 9 0.838.403.927.701.775.834.666 27 HLA-B*5101 9 0.978.835.953 1.871 1.824 28 HLA-B*5301 9 0.923.769.933.894.813.952.702 30 H-2-Kb 8 0.936.753.922.935.744.987. Vaxitope defines statistical P-values based on a random sequence model that assumes each position in a random sequence is generated according to the average letter frequencies of all sequences in the NCBI peptide non-redundant database. the input sequence of Vaxitope may come from those peptides that are part of an outer membrane protein and exposed outside the bacterial membrane. in total 22 proteins were predicted to meet selected criteria. prediction of -helices and their possible cellular locations of NmpC. traditional reverse vaccinology does not consider prediction of epitopes. a user is prompted to provide information for up to 300 proteins at one time. Vaxign predicts vaccine targets based on runtime execution. it would take 150\u2013300 minutes to finish analysis of 300 proteins. the roles of adhesin-like proteins in adhering to host cells require further investigation. none of these 70 proteins shows sequence similarity to any human or mouse proteins. similar strategy was applied to obtain vaccine targets for the other three UPEC strains using Vaxign. only 22 proteins have been identified to be unique to the pathogenic UPEC strains. eight proteins are predicted to contain iron-binding and iron siderophore transporter activity. nine proteins are related to porin and ion transport. iron ion binding and iron/siderophore transporter activity 1 NP_752820.1 ybiL 0.857 1 Catecholate siderophore receptor fiu precursor (tonB-dependent receptor fiu) 3 NP_754406.1 c2518 0.83 0 X TonB dependent receptor 4 NP_752238 c0294 0.83 0 X TonB dependent receptor 5 NP_753164.1 iroN 0.672 fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher protein 15 NP_757244.1 fimD 0.744 1 + Outer membrane usher protein fimD precursor 16 NP_757034 papC_2 0.674 1 X PapC protein 17 NP_755465 papC 0.666 0 X PapC protein 18 NP_754524.1 yehB 0 0 Outer membrane usher protein yehB precursor 19 NP_ outer membrane protein F (Porin family) 29 NP_754240.1 c2348 0.759 0 X Outer membrane porin protein nmpC precursor 30 NP_752325.1 phoE 0.729 0 Outer membrane phosphoporin protein E 31 NP_753724.1 phoE 0.751 0 Outer membrane protein N precursor 32 NP_754275.1 c2383 0.597 0 X Outer membrane protein N precursor outer membrane protein CusC 43 NP_754925.1 yfhM 0.224 0 Lipoprotein yfhM precursor 44 NP_756232.1 yiaD 0.526 3 + Putative outer membrane lipoprotein Other outer membrane proteins 45 NP_752286.1 c0345 0.987 1 X ShlA/HecA/FhaA exofamily protein 46 NP_752352 eaeH 0.904 1 X Put ompW 0.848 0 + Outer membrane protein W 59 NP_753695.1 ompG 0.618 0 Outer membrane protein G precursor 60 NP_754014.1 ydiY 0.708 0 Hypothetical protein c2120 61 NP_754081.1 yeaF 0.852 0 + + MltA-interacting protein precursor 62 NP_754523.1 yehA 0.847 0 Ad NP_754656.1 c2770 0.348 0 Hypothetical protein c5318 76 NP_753730.1 ydbH 0.401 1 Hypothetical protein c1828 77 NP_756204.1 yhjL 0.408 0 Cellulose synthase subunit BcsC 78 NP_751977.1 c0021 0.418 1 Hypothetical protein c0021 79 NP_757166.1 proteomics, protein expression results (+ for up-regulation in vivo or in vivo) 23 proteins have been found upregulated in vivo or in urine at the mRNA and/or protein levels. only one protein (FimD) from fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane protein family was shown to be upregulated in DNA microarray analysis. c2482 (renamed Hma for heme acquisition), a heme-binding protein, was first cloned and purified, and used for in vivo mouse testing. it was found that intranasal immunization with Hma generated an antigen-specific humoral response, antigen-specific production of IL-17 and IFN-, and provided significant protection against experimental infection with UPEC strain CFT073. adherence of microbial pathogens to host cells is mediated by adhesins. adherence of microbial pathogens to host cells is mediated by adhesins. adherence of microbial pathogens to host cells is mediated by adhesins. the vaxign database contains precomputed prediction results using 76 genomes from 13 pathogens. in total, 191,192 proteins have been precomputed. this data can be queried using the Vaxign web interface. Vaxitope predicts both MHC class I and class II binding epitopes using an internally developed tool. a Tyr-Trp substitution at position A of an alignment may receive a very different score than the same substitution at position B. in position-independent matrices, the Tyr-Trp substitution receives the same score no matter at what position it occurs. the positive HLA A*0201 alleles were used to calculate the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) the negative alleles were used to calculate the False Positive Rate (1-Specificity) the areas under the ROC curve provide a way to measure prediction quality. 737.808.891.684 6 HLA-A*0203 9 0.874.304.956.659.865.828.769 7 HLA-A*0203 10 0.867.317.963.691.827.834.712 8 HLA-A*0206 9 0.900.387.961.73.867.881.781 9 HLA-A*0206 10 0.916.403.957.775.878.922.782 10 HLA-A*0301 9 942.905.755.966.619 19 HLA-A*6801 9 0.908.406.949.841.841.946.744 20 HLA-A*6801 10 0.848.418.9.866.701.973.564 21 HLA-A*6802 9 0.918.446.96.801.868.922.757 22 HLA-A*6802 10 0.913.452.947.837.825.977.715 23 HLA-A ROC curve analysis of epitopes binding HLA A*0201 may be better than the results predicted by RANKPEP [15]. Vaxitope defines statistical P-values based on a random sequence model that assumes each position in a random sequence is generated according to the average letter frequencies of all sequences in the NCBI peptide non-redundant database [39]. another unique feature in Vaxitope is that it integrates with other vaccine design components in Vaxign. .05, 1436 epitopes from E. coli protein Hma have been found in 4 hosts. 515 epitopes for 23 MHC Class II alleles have been found in 4 hosts. it remains a challenge to rank and optimize the epitopes for vaccine development. only outer membrane proteins (OMP) are predicted and analyzed. from the total 5379 proteins in UPEC strain CFT073, Vaxign detects 107 outer membrane proteins. these predicted adhesins are likely critical for colonization. 58 out of 83 proteins have an adhesin probability of.051. only 48 genes have annotation in DAVID and thus included in the DAVID analysis. only 22 proteins have been identified to be unique to the pathogenic UPEC strains. eight proteins are predicted to contain iron-binding and iron siderophore transporter activity. nine proteins are related to porin and ion transport. erobactin receptor (TonB-dependent receptor) 7 NP_752135.1 fhuA 0.746 0 + + ferrichrome outer membrane transporter 8 NP_754374.1 Hma (c2482) 0.772 0 X + + outer membrane heme acquisition protein 9 NP_756170 chuA 0.846 0 X + + Outer membrane heme/hemoglobin receptor 10 NP_753551.1 pr NP_754765.1 yfcU 0.563 0 X Fimbrial export usher family protein 22 NP_753156.1 ycbS 0.559 1 Outer membrane usher protein ycbS precursor 24 NP_753159 focH 0.917 0 X F1C putative fimbrial adhesin precursor Porin and ion transport 25 NP_753469.1 nmpC 0.788 1 X putative outer membrane channel protein 38 NP_753669.1 c1765 0.437 0 Putative outer membrane channel protein 38 NP_753669.1 c1765 0.437 0 Putative outer membrane channel protein 38 NP_753669.1 tsx 0.833 0 + Nucleoside-specific channel-forming protein tsx precursor Lipoproteins 39 NP_756849.1 yjbH 0.651 0 Lipo NP_756286 c4424 0.99 0 X Putative adhesin protein 52 NP_752116.1 yadC 0.81 1 Putative fimbrial-like adhesin protein 52 NP_752162.1 yaeT 0.637 0 + + Outer membrane protein assembly factor YaeT 53 NP_752163.1 hlpA 0.587 0 Periplasmic chaperone 54 NP_752339.1 y ase A 66 NP_754578.1 cirA 0.51 0 Colicin I receptor 67 NP_755652.2 tolC 0 0 + + Outer membrane protease 69 NP_756783.1 btuB 0 0 + Vitamin B12/cobalamin outer membrane transporter 70 NP_754246.1 fliF 0.213 2 Flagellar MS-ring protein 71 NP_755960.1 hypothetical protein c4739 82 NP_753585.1 ychP 0.435 0 Hypothetical protein c1680 83 NP_754913.1 c3031 0.448 0 SinH-like protein 84 NP_752491.1 ybaU 0.464 1 Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (rotamase D) 85 proteins are conserved across total four UPEC genomes five out of 14 iron binding proteins (IroN, FepA, FhuA, Hma, and ChuA) discovered by Vaxign have been found to be upregulated in vivo or in urine. five proteins from porin family have also been found upregulated in vivo or in urine. two other proteins, IreA (NP_757022.1, c5174) and IutA (NP_755498.1), were also tested based on six independent screens. both are putative iron-regulated outer membrane virulence proteins. Vaxign predicted results are consistent with existing reports. UPEC FimH is predicted by Vaxign as an adhesin with an adhesin probability of.96. this prediction is consistent with current knowledge about this protein. more advanced in silico prediction would be able to predict and optimize epitopes for vaccine development. microarray and proteomics gene expression data were complementary to DNA sequence-based analysis in predicting vaccine targets. future directions of further Vaxign development may include addition of other components such as analysis of high throughput transcriptomic (e.g., DNA microarray and superarray) epitopes can be predicted from antigens (e.g., Hma) it is often challenging to rank predicted epitopes for vaccine testing. the best T cell epitopes tend to contain \u201cclusters\u201d of MHC binding motifs. molecular mimicry or cross-reactivity between self epitopes and pathogen epitopes has been found a common reason for many pathogen-induced autoimmune diseases. oligopeptide QTDRED is common to both K. pneumoniae and HLA-B27 nitrogenase reductase enzyme. this sequence similarity appears to cause ankylosing spondyltis. literature mining program based on the Vaccine Ontology is also being developed to facilitate automated literature data processing and inference."}
