{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus similar to respiratory syncytial virus. hMPV is primarily known as a causative agent of respiratory tract infections in children. the virus can also cause respiratory infections in adults. est X-ray showed cardiomegaly and diffuse opacity in both lower lungs. electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a normal ventricular response. echocardiography showed slightly decreased systolic function with a small amount of pericardial effusion. ABGA PH 7.4 - SaO2 (%) 88 - PO2 (mmHg) 54 - PCO2 (mmHg) 34 - HCO3- (mmol/L) 22.7 - CK-MB (ng/mL) 7.9 6.8 Pro-BNP (pg/mL) 2,618 - WBC, white blood cells; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP, C-reactive protein; AST PCR analysis was positive only for hMPV on the fourth day after hospitalization. tests for other respiratory viruses (influenza virus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus) were negative. the patient was diagnosed with hMPV complicated by pneumonia and myopericarditis. hMPV infection facilitated severe bacterial infection by obstruction of higher levels of airways and induction of inflammatory cytokines. in the present study, although a bacterial pathogen was not isolated, antibiotics were administered because of concerns regarding concomitant bacterial pneumonia. the elevations of cardiac troponin I or T levels are known to be more common than CK-MB elevation in patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis. the elevations reflect acute, early-onset myocarditis, and reflect acute, early-onset myocarditis."}
