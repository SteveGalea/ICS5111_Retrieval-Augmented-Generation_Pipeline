{"summary": "the majority of CMV infections in immunocompetent hosts are asymptomatic. the phenomenon of latency allows the virus to establish a permanent and persistent infection. the virus is highly seroprevalent in the human population (>60%). proposed targets include downstream manipulation of kinase upon altering Na+/K+-ATPase activity (14) or by manipulating hERG expression (16). different cardiac glycoside variants were analyzed to identify key side chain moieties of convallatoxin that are important for anti-CMV activity. all the cardiac glycosides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), except for ouabain, which was purchased from Acros Organics (New Jersey). human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) fluorescence emission >2 standard deviations above background was registered as a positive signal. any fluorescent signal larger than 5 m, smaller than 300 m, separated from any other emission by at least 0.5 m in both the x and y axes was classified as an event. MRC5 cells (10,000 in 100 l) were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. MRC5 cells (10,000 in 100 l) were plated in a 96-well plate. the following day, the medium was replaced with 95 l of DMEM. the cells were infected at 0 hpi with AD169IE2-YFP (MOI, 3), and at 18 hpi. ligands were docked into the minimized pump structure using XP precision in Glide (Schr\u00f6dinger) the following day, the cells were treated with convallatoxin (5 nM or 50 nM) or the known mRNA synthesis inhibitor flavopiridol (20 nM or 5 M) MRC5 cells (500,000 in 2 ml) were plated in a 6-well plate. the following day, the cells were treated with 0 to 50 nM convallatoxin for 24 h. the cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 250 l of starvation medium. 5 l of 30 M cycloheximide was added to the 25-l reaction mixture. luciferase activity was then measured on a luciferase assay reagent II. the average luminescence with the standard error of each triplicate was plotted as relative luminescence. the medium was removed and replaced with medium containing a range of convallatoxin nanomolar concentrations in triplicate wells for 7 to 10 days without refreshing the compound. cells were harvested via trypsinization and resuspended in 250 l of starvation medium (free of methionine and cysteine) the cells were lysed in 0.5% NP-40, and 10 l of each sample's total cell lysate was analyzed for scintillation counts. human lung fibroblasts (MRC5; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U of penicillin-streptomycin/ml, Isolate CH13 has a deletion of codons 597 to 603 in the CMV UL97 kinase gene, and CH19 has an A594V point mutation in the same gene. both mutations confer resistance to ganciclovir. MRC5 cells (10,000 in 100 l) were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. the following day, the medium was replaced with DMEM with various concentrations of the compounds (final volume, 100 l) in sextuplicate. MRC5 cells (10,000 in 100 l) were plated in a 6-well plate. the following day, the medium was replaced with 95 l of DMEM. the cells were infected at 0 hpi with AD169IE2-YFP (MOI, 3) the cells were washed with PBS and then removed by trypsinization. total RNA was harvested from the cells using the Promega mini RNA isolation kit. qPCR was performed in a lightCycler 480 using SYBR green. the whatman paper was air dried overnight before being placed in 2 ml of scintillation fluid. the average counts per million with the standard error of the triplicates were plotted. MRC5 cells (1,000,000 in 2 ml) were treated for 2 h in DMEM containing 50 nM convallatoxin or DMSO. each sample was split in half so that there were 4 samples of 500,000 cells each. each sample was incubated for 20 min in starvation medium (free of methionine and cysteine) the EC50 was calculated using the average plaque count or CMV DNA copy number in the triplicate DMSO control wells as 100%. long-term, low-dose [35S]methionine scintillation experiments. MRC5 cells (50,000 in 2 ml) were plated on a 6-well plate. convallatoxin consists of two functional domains: the steroidal core and the glycan chain. the arrows indicate the important structures identified for anti-CMV efficacy. MRC5 cells treated with DMSO and increasing amounts of glycoside variants (0 to 5 M) were infected with AD169IE2-YFP (MOI, 3) and subjected to analysis using an Acumen eX3 cytometer for YFP+ cells. the percent infection was determined based on the number of YFP+ cells from compound-treated cells. the error bars represent standard errors of the mean. the compounds were classified into four general classes based on antiviral potency. for one group of compounds, the EC50s below 50 nM showed high potency. the next group of compounds have moderate antiviral selectivity, with EC50s in the 50 nM to 1 M range. the variants were classified as high-potency, medium-potency, low-potency, and no-potency compounds. the variants were classified as high-potency, medium-potency, low-potency, and no-potency compounds. the variants were classified as high-potency, medium-potency, low-potency, and no-potency compounds. differences in the pharmacodynamics among the variants may be related to a combination of a compound's efficacy to modulate the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, the Kd (dissociation constant) value, cell permeability properties, and half-life in cells and medium. the two compounds that maintained efficacy up to 4 h postinfection (i.e., convallatoxin and -antiarin) both have glycosi ouabain, 50 nM; -antiarin, 50 nM; or convallatoxin, 50 nM. at 18 hpi, the number of YFP+ cells was determined using an Acumen eX3 cytometer. the relative maximal inhibition was determined based on the 0-hpi sample as 100% relative maximal inhibition. the low-efficacy compounds (strophanthidol and strogoside) and the no-efficacy compounds (allo-emicymarin and 17-epi-strophanthidol) were unable to bind in the same manner and were incapable of forming the same hydrogen bonds as the high- and moderate-efficacy ligands. MRC5 cells were treated with DMSO, convallatoxin (5 nM or 50 nM), or flavopiridol (5 nM or 5 M), and infected with AD169WT for 24 h prior to subjecting the total RNA to qRT-PCR for IE2 and GAPDH mRNAs. the relative IE2 mRNA levels were normalized to the GAPDH levels. MRC5 cells were treated with 0 to 50 nM convallatoxin. convallatoxin inhibits protein synthesis by altering methionine transport. low concentrations of convallatoxin had little to no impact on incorporation. convallatoxin at 12.5 nM and above had a significant reduction in [35S]Met incorporation. these data were consistent with the level of [35S]Met-labeled polypeptides in infected cells analyzed under similar conditions. the results demonstrate that convallatoxin treatment likely inhibits CMV infection by limiting the global expression of newly synthesized proteins and thus preventing the production of viral proteins. the normalized values represent the averages of 3 replicates normalized to DMSO-treated cells as 100%. luciferase translation in vitro was analyzed based on luciferase activity using Promega's TnT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system. the luciferase activity was measured after 2 h. the amount of [35S]Met in the cell lysate corresponds to free [35S]Met and [35S]Met-labeled protein. cycloheximide treatment alone reduced the free [35S]Met in cell lysate by only 12% (P 0.01) while reducing the [35S]Met in proteins by 69% (P 0.001) ganciclovir-resistant strains BI-4 (A), BI-6 (B), CH13 (C) and CH19 (D) were treated with convallatoxin for up to 7 days. the number of plaques and viral DNA copies were analyzed and determined, setting DMSO-treated cells as 100%. qPCR BI-4 3,000 6.8 9.9 BI-6 3,000 6.8 6.3 BI-6 NDc 4.8a ND BI-6 ND 4.6b ND CH13 11,500 7.7 7.0 CH19 15,700 4.8 5.0 CH19 ND 4.9a ND 4.5b ND a Convallatoxin was added at 24 h postplating. fibroblasts treated with 0 to 15 nM convallatoxin for 7 days low levels of IE1 and IE2 proteins may not be sufficient to induce expression of early and late proteins. decrease in methionine levels may trigger metabolic changes that would further inhibit virus replication. convallatoxin is a potent selective inhibitor of CMV infection. convallatoxin consists of two functional domains: the steroidal core and the glycan chain. the arrows indicate the important structures identified for anti-CMV efficacy. MRC5 cells treated with DMSO were infected with AD169IE2-YFP (MOI, 3). the dye binds to double-stranded DNA and is able to enter the cell only upon the breakdown of the plasma membrane. the fluorescence signal thus localizes to the nuclei of dead cells. all of the compounds had minimal toxicity up to the maximum dose tested (5 M) third group shows minimal antiviral selectivity, with EC50s greater than 2 M. strophanthidol, strogoside, and glucostrebloside all have a hydroxy substituent or lactone functionality at the C-19 position of the steroid. the only difference between strophanthidin and strophanthidol is at C-19. cymarin, glucostrebloside, strogoside, and strophanthidol were quite effective at inhibiting a virus infection when added up to 1 hpi. -antiarin and convallatoxin remained effective when added up to 4 h postinfection, with statistically significant increases in virus infection beginning at 6 h postinfection. MRC5 cells were infected with AD169IE2-YFP (MOI, 3) at time zero. at 18 hpi, the number of YFP+ cells was determined using an Acumen eX3 cytometer. the relative maximal inhibition was determined based on the 0-hpi sample as 100% relative maximal inhibition. the high-efficacy ligands (ouabain, convallatoxin, and -antiarin) were predicted to dock in the same pose, forming hydrogen bonds with Glu116, Glu117, and Thr797 of the protein. strogoside and gluostrebloside have the same C-1 hydroxy group and the same time-of-addition profile as ouabain. convallatoxin is the most potent inhibitor with a high affinity for the Na+/K+-ATPase. it is possible that there is a lower-affinity conformation that supports the binding of the lower-efficacy ligands when there is a high concentration of drug present. convallatoxin does not inhibit IE2 gene transcription of virus-infected cells. MRC5 cells treated with DMSO, convallatoxin (5 nM or 50 nM), or flavopiridol (5 nM or 50 nM or 50 M) were infected with AD169IE2-YFP. the results suggest that convallatoxin treatment targets protein synthesis. latoxin was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine ([35S]Met) to measure the synthesis of newly synthesized proteins. proteins with [35S]Met incorporated were analyzed by measuring TCA-precipitated counts. low concentrations (3.125 nM or 6.25 nM) of convallatoxin had little to no impact on [35S]Met incorporation. 25 nM, or 50 nM, for 24 h were subjected to liquid scintillation (A) and resolved by SDS-PAGE (B) luciferase activity was measured with the proMega TnT in vitro transcription and translation kit pretreated with 5 M cycloheximide or 5 M convallatoxin (30 min) upon addition of luciferase-expressing vector. convallatoxin did not reduce luciferase activity, demonstrating that the compound does not directly target the translational machinery. results imply that convallatoxin's reduction of protein synthesis occurs via indirect means by possibly altering the pools of available methionine. convallatoxin's reduction in mRNA translation limits protein synthesis by inhibiting the transport of methionine into the cell. we examined whether convallatoxin was effective at limiting the dissemination of clinical cell-associated virus. HFFs infected with the clinical strains BI-4 (A), BI-6 (B), CH13 (C) and CH19 (D) were treated with convallatoxin for up to 7 days. the number of plaques and viral DNA copies were analyzed and determined. the EC50s for plaque assays ranged from 4.8 nM to 7.7 nM. 3.75 nM convallatoxin reduced methionine transport by 20%. but caused a 30 to 40% reduction in the number of plaques. olide's orientation permits hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl residues on the steroid backbone of the compound with amino acids Thr797 and Glu117 of the Na+/K+-ATPase. the 6-deoxy--l-mannopyranoside sugar forms hydrogen bonds with Glu116. this in turn reduces the sodium gradient across the cell membrane and thus leads to a decrease in sodium-dependent methionine cotransport into the cell. convallatoxin is effective when added up to 4 hpi. infection is not rescued by the addition of wortmannin and PP2. known inhibitors of the proteins SRC and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. convallatoxin is unable to inhibit in vitro transcription and translation. convallatoxin can be safely consumed orally by rats at a daily dose of roughly 0.76 mg/kg of body weight (38), which would translate to a little over 50 mg/day orally in a 70-kg person. the toxic serum convallatoxin concentrations in mice are 18 to 180 M (39, 40), well above 1,000 times what would be necessary to prevent CMV replication. toxicity associated with cardiac glycosides is not directly linked to its efficacy as an anti-CMV agent. this means that more effective antiviral cardiac glycosides could possibly be designed without necessarily increasing their toxicity. ouabain is unique among the 3 high-potency ligands in that it has a hydroxyl group at C-1. it is thus able to hydrogen bond with Gln111 of the Na+/K+-ATPase. future mutational studies and/or more crystallography data would allow greater confidence in the explanation of the relationship between antiviral potency and molecular protein-ligand interactions. this combination of a DNA polymerase inhibitor and a protein expression inhibitor could help to limit the emergence of resistant strains or to lower the dosage of ganciclovir required for treatment."}
