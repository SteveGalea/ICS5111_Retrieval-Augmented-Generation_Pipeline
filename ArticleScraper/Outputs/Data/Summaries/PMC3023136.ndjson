{"summary": "RESULTS Influenza-specific plasmablasts are persistently induced throughout infection, providing a rich source of antiviral mAbs B cell responses. cases ranged from mild disease with rapid viral clearance within a few days after onset of symptoms to severe cases that shed virus for several weeks and required hospitalization with ventilator support. sore throat, nausea, diarrhea N/A Day 9 Oseltamivir Yes 1010 24 M 10 10 none Fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting, headache, confusion N/A Day 9 Oseltamivir No 1013 26 M 80 160 none Fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea N/A Day 9 None No The kinetics of their appearance and persistence during an ongoing infection remain unclear. most patients had a relatively high frequency of plasmablasts, forming antibodies that bound to past, seasonal influenza strains. none of the induced plasmablast cells bound to recombinant HA from the same vaccine were overlapping populations and cross-reactive. antibodies were scored positive if they bound at least two standard deviations greater than the mean absorbance of naive B cell antibodies at 10 g/ml. antibodies were scored positive (frequency above plots) if they bound at least two standard deviations greater than the mean absorbance of naive B cell antibodies at 10 g/ml. only 14 of 15 HA-binding antibodies have curves in G because one of the HA-reactive antibodies only binds HA on whole virions, not on the recombinant protein. the antibodies were screened for reactivity by ELISA. plasmablasts from patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza were highly cross-reactive to prepandemic influenza strains. a majority (29/46, or 63%) of the pandemic H1N1-specific antibodies also cross-reacted with seasonal influenza viruses. the center numeral equals total antibodies. 16.5% of the pandemic H1N1-induced plasmablasts were clonally related. median values indicated by the bar. evidence of extensive affinity maturation suggests a high frequency of memory cell activation against the pandemic H1N1 strain Based on the 10\u201315-fold induction of plasmablasts and expression of intracellular Ki67 during ongoing immune responses. mutations progressively accumulate on variable genes after repeated immunizations. plasmablast responses to anthrax or vaccinia (small pox) vaccines are more so than for IgG-positive memory B cells from our historical data that averaged 14/VH gene. mutations had accumulated at a significantly lower frequency than the IgG controls. five of these antibodies bind with high affinity to most H1 strains. these five antibodies cross-compete for a similar epitope that was not over-lapping with the HAI+ antibodies. each H5 variant has a single residue mutation in the stalk region. a surprising 10% of all antibodies induced by pandemic H1N1 infection bound to a conserved, critical epitope on the HA stalk. the frequency of pandemic-induced, stem-reactive antibodies (5/46) versus those from annual vaccine (0/50) is significantly greater (Chi-square test, P = 0.02) ELISA binding curves are provided in Fig. S2 A. three binding patterns were observed that coincided with specificity comparisons by competitive ELISA. mutants were transfected into 293T cells 24 h after transfection. binding of indicated antibodies was tested at 10 g/ml. antibody F10 was one of the antibodies used to characterize HA stalk epitope. a surprising 82% (9/11) of the neutralizing plasmablasts we isolated during pandemic H1N1 influenza infections were broadly cross-reactive to multiple influenza strains. a surprising 82% (9/11) of the neutralizing plasmablasts that we isolated during pandemic H1N1 influenza infections were broadly cross-reactive to multiple influenza strains. antibodies EM-4C04, 1009-3B06, and 70-1F02 are specific for the active site of the HA molecule. EM-4C04 is highly specific for pandemic H1N1, whereas 1009-3B06 and 70-F02 display broadly cross-reactive binding. all three antibodies were effective therapeutically, even when they were administered as late as 60 h after the lethal challenge infection. mice were treated with 200 g of mAb intraperitoneally 12 h before infection with a lethal dose of either pandemic H1N1 influenza or either of the two common influenza laboratory strains PR/8/34 or FM/1/47. EM-4C04, which is highly specific for the pandemic H1N1, had no protective effect on infection with PR/8/34 or FM/1/47. treatment conferred significant protection as determined by comparison of weights in untreated versus prophylaxis. at the time of treatment versus 12 d after infection (unpaired, two-tailed Student\u2019s t test, P 0.05). log-rank test indicated significant survival as well (P 0.003) cases ranged from mild disease with rapid viral clearance within a few days after onset of symptoms to severe cases that shed virus for several weeks. a majority of the patients were treated with antiviral drugs. the diagnoses were confirmed by pandemic H1N1-specific RT-PCR and serology. 20 10 none Fever, cough, sore throat, vomiting, headache, confusion N/A Day 9 Oseltamivir No 1013 26 M 80 160 none Fever, chills, cough, cough, sore throat, body aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea N/A Day 9 None No The mAb column indicates whether mAbs were made from the plasmablasts of these patients. influenza-specific human plasmablasts are continuously generated throughout an ongoing infection. a fairly high proportion of these cells make antibodies that also cross-react with previous annual H1N1 influenza strains. whole IgG secreting cells specific to pandemic H1N1 whole virus, recombinant HA from pandemic H1N1 and recombinant HA from the previous year\u2019s vaccine were not analyzed in this fashion. donors EM1 and SF1000 were not analyzed in this fashion. HA-binding antibodies have curves in G because one of the HA-reactive antibodies only binds HA on whole virions, not on the recombinant protein. plasmablasts from patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza were highly cross-reactive to prepandemic influenza strains. a majority (29/46, or 63%) of the pandemic H1N1-specific antibodies also cross-reacted with seasonal influenza viruses. only 22% (11/50) of plasmablasts induced by annual H1N1 strains before the pandemic could bind the pandemic H1N1 influenza. 16.5% of the pandemic H1N1-induced plasmablasts were clonally related. median values are indicated by the bar. each individual set of VH genes averaged significantly more mutations than the IgG memory and GC. affinity maturation suggests a high frequency of memory cell activation against the pandemic H1N1 strain Based on the 10\u201315-fold induction of plasmablasts and expression of intracellular Ki67 during ongoing immune responses. the ready detection of clonal expansions at a mean frequency of 16.5% of the cells for the six patients supports this view. a majority of the neutralizing antibodies bound to highly conserved epitopes in both the HA stalk and head regions were able to neutralize the virus in vitro. this specificity is reminiscent of antibodies against the recently discovered broadly neutralizing epitopes found on the HA stalk. five of these antibodies bind with high affinity to most H1 strains. these antibodies cross-compete for a similar epitope that was not over-lapping with the HAI+ antibodies. each H5 variant has a single residue mutation in the stalk region. the frequency of pandemic-induced, stem-reactive antibodies (5/46) versus those from annual vaccine (0/50) is significantly greater. this specificity is only rarely seen in human memory B cells or from phage-display libraries. three binding patterns (epitopes 1 and 2, and 3) were observed that coincided with specificity comparisons by competitive ELISA. competition ELISA assays were used to determine similarity in specificity between the various neutralizing antibodies. mutants were transfected into 293T cells 24 h after transfection. binding of indicated antibodies was tested at 10 g/ml. antibody F10 was one of the antibodies used to characterize the HA stalk epitope by x-ray crystallography. a novel antibody was the SF1009-3B06 antibody that reacts strongly with the pandemic H1N1 strain. it is only accessible on whole virions, not on recombinant HA. two antibodies cross-reacted and inhibited hemagglutination to all recent H1 vaccine strains. antibodies EM-4C04, 1009-3B06, and 70-1F02 are specific for the active site of the HA molecule. EM-4C04 is highly specific for pandemic H1N1, whereas 1009-3B06 and 70-F02 display broadly cross-reactive binding. all three antibodies were effective therapeutically, even when they were administered as late as 60 h after the lethal challenge infection, well after the mice were symptomatic. 1009-3B06 and 70-1F02 showed protection against these antigenically distinct H1N1 influenza strains. EM-4C04, which is highly specific for the pandemic H1N1, had no protective effect on infection with PR/8/34 or FM/1/47. 6\u20138-wk-old BALB/c mice were treated with 200 g EM-4C04, 70-1F02, or 1009-3B06 human mAb intraperitoneally. control mice were treated with a control mAb or polyclonal human IgG. 12 h later, they were challenged with a 3xLD50 dose of mouse adapted pandemic H1N1, PR/8/34, or FM/1/47 influenza virus. newly recruited naive B cells and preexisting memory B cells can account for the observed high frequency of neutralizing antibodies (11/15 HA-binding antibodies), the majority (9/11) of which are cross-reactive with seasonal H1N1 strains. ELISA most antibodies were cross-reactive and one third of antibodies bound to past annual viral antigens at lower concentrations, suggesting higher avidity to past influenza strains. plasmablasts activated by infection with the highly novel pandemic H1N1 influenza strain have substantially increased targeting to the HA stalk region epitopes. however, most specific antibodies isolated in this study were cross-reactive to past influenza strains. there is a discrepancy between patients for serum MN titers, severity of disease, and frequency of plasmablasts expressing neutralizing antibodies. this may be caused by the time from infection (day 31) or by the presence of highly potent antibodies, such as EM-4C04, whose activities were less likely to titer out. studies of 46 mAbs induced by pandemic H1N1 infection indicated frequent activation of broadly reactive B cells. if true, it will be important to characterize the efficacy of the pandemic vaccine to induce a similarly cross-protective response. influenza stocks used for the assays were freshly grown in eggs, prepared, and purified as previously described (Wrammert et al., 2008) the hemagglutination inhibition activity was determined using turkey red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories) as previously described (Wrammert et al., 2008) or purchased as inactivated preparations (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd.) 96-well ELISPOT filter plates (Millipore) were coated overnight with either the optimized amounts of purified pandemic H1N1 virions, recombinant HA from the pandemic H1N1 (as above) or goat anti\u2013human Ig (Invitrogen) plates were washed and blocked by incubation with RPMI containing 10% FCS for 2 h. analytical and cell sorting cytometry were purchased from BD. anti-CD27 was purchased from eBioscience: anti\u2013CD3-PECy7 or PerCP, anti\u2013CD20-PECy7 or PerCP, anti\u2013CD38-PE, anti\u2013CD27-APC. antibody anti-H1N1 induced plasmablast variable genes were amplified by single-cell RT-PCR using primer sets and PCR conditions that were previously published. mutation rates by this method is 1 base-exchange per 1,000 bases sequenced (based on sequences of constant region gene segments) 100 PFU of virus in 250 l DME were incubated with equal volume of diluted mAbs at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before the plaque assay. cells were washed with PBS and 10fold diluted viruses in 100 l DME were added into each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. whole virus, recombinant HA, or vaccine-specific ELISA was performed on starting concentrations of 10 g/ml of virus or recombinant HA. in brief, microtiter plates were coated with virus strains totaling 8 HAU of total virus per well or with 1 g/ml of recombinant HA protein. 50 l of 0.5% turkey RBCs (Rockland Immunochemicals) suspended in PBS with 0.5% BSA was added to each well. after 30 min at room temperature, the serum titers or minimum effective concentrations were read based on the final dilution for which a button was observed. ferret anti-H5N1 serum at 1:300 dilution were incubated with transfected 293T cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3. binding of antibodies to cells was analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur. all experiments were performed in triplicates. for kinetic analysis, injections over reference cell surface and injections with buffer were subtracted from the data. association rates (ka), dissociation rates (kd) and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by aligning the curves to fit a 1:1 binding model using BIAevaluation 4.1 software. antibodies 1009-3B06, 1000-3E01, and 1000-2G06 could not be determined because these mAb body weight changes were registered daily for a period of 14 d. all mice that lost >25% of their initial body weight were sacrificed according to the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Vacutainer tubes (BD), washed, and resuspended in PBS with 2% FCS for immediate use or frozen for subsequent analysis. plasma samples were saved at 80\u00b0C or frozen in medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for subsequent analysis. direct ELISPOT to enumerate the number of either total IgG-secreting, pandemic H1N1 influenza\u2013specific, or vaccine-specific plasmablasts present in the PBMC samples were done as previously described. in brief, 96-well ELISPOT filter plates (Millipore) were coated overnight with either the optimized amounts of purified pandemic H1N1 virions, recombinant HA from the pandemic H1N1 Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting was performed on whole blood after lysis of erythrocytes and fixing in 2% PFA. all live cell sorting and single cell sorting was performed on purified PBMCs using either a FACSVantage or ARIAII cell sorter system. antibody sequences are deposited on GenBank. heavy/light chain plasmids were cotransfected into the 293A cell line. antibody proteins generated in this study can be provided in limited quantities upon request. cells were incubated for 36\u201340 h and fixed with 2% PFA for 10 min. Agarose plugs were removed and cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% EtOH for 1 min. plates were dried and used to count plaques in each well. l of the supernatant was incubated with equal volume of 0.5% of PBS-washed Turkey red blood cells for 30 min. four replicates were performed for each dilution, and complete agglutination was scored as HA+. titers were calculated by the Reed-Muench method. affinity estimates were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of curves from eight dilutions of antibody (10 to 0.125 ug/ml) using GraphPad Prism. the samples were then serially diluted with PBS in 96- well v-bottom plates and 8 HAU (as determined by incubation with 0.5% turkey RBCs in the absence of serum) of live, egg-grown virus was added to each well. mutants of pcDNA3.1-H5-TH04 were transfected transiently into 293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000. cells were harvested for immunostaining 24 h after transfection. anti-HA antibodies, a control human mAb 80R at 10 g/ml, or ferret anti-H5N1 serum at 1:300 dilution were incubated. recombinant HA (His-tagged) was immobilized at 5 l/min1 on NTA sensor chips. the antibodies at concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 nM in HBS-P buffer were then injected at 20 l/min1 over the immobilized recombinant HA or reference cell surface. for the other experiments, recombinant HA (His-tagged) was immobilized at 5 l/min1 on NTA sensor the LD50 for all the viruses was determined by in vivo infection at various virus concentrations, according to the method of Reed and Muench. the experiments were conducted in accordance with ethical procedures and policies approved by the Emory University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. all studies were approved by the Emory University, University of Chicago, and Columbia University institutional review boards. all work with samples from infected patients was performed in a designated BSL2+ facility at Emory. ELISPOT was used to enumerate the number of total IgG-secreting, pandemic H1N1 influenza\u2013specific, or vaccine-specific plasmablasts present in the PBMC samples. 96-well ELISPOT filter plates (Millipore) were coated overnight with either the optimized amounts of purified pandemic H1N1 virions, recombinant HA from the pandemic H1N1. purified and extensively washed PBMCs or sorted plasmablasts were added to the plates in dilution series and incubated for 6 h. the plates were incubated with an avidin-D-HRP conjugate (Vector Laboratories) and developed using an avidin-D-HRP conjugate. single ASCs were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing RNase inhibitor (Promega) VH and V genes from each cell were amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR reactions. restriction sites were incorporated by PCR with primers to the particular variable and junctional genes. MDCK cells were grown in 6-well plates at a density of 8 105/well. on the next day, cells were washed with PBS. 10fold dilutions of virus were added in 500 l DME. cells were washed with PBS and 100 l of DME were added into each well. cells were further incubated for 60 h, 50 l of the supernatant was incubated for 30 min. agglutination was scored as HA+. anti-human IgG (goat anti\u2013human I-peroxidase-conjugate; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used to detect binding of the recombinant antibodies. the plate developed when the absorbance of these controls reached 3.0 0.1 OD units. the full-length HA gene (H5-TH04) of A/Thailand/2(SP-33)/2004 (H5N1) were codon-optimized for eukaryotic cell expression. all mutants of H5-TH04 were derived from pcDNA3.1-H5-TH04 and constructed by the QuikChange method. cells were harvested for immunostaining 24 h after transfection. EM4CO4 and SF1009-3FO1 antibodies were immobilized at 10 l/min1 on a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling and recombinant HA at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 nM. running buffer (HBS-EP) was then applied for 600 s, after which the sensor surface was regenerated by a single injection of 25 mM NaOH at 100 l/min1. mice were inoculated intranasally with 3xLD50 of a highly pathogenic, mouse-adapted pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (A/California/04/09), or PR/8/34 or FM/1/47 influenza virus. mice were inoculated intranasally with 3xLD50 of a highly pathogenic, mouse-adapted pandemic H1N1 virus. at various times after infection (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and data were collected and graphed using MS Excel and GraphPad Prism software. Efficacy of therapeutic and challenge experiments was evaluated by analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism software."}
