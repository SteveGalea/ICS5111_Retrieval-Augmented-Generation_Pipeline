{"summary": "the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals. we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern france. only the age of males and females had an effect on the transmission rate. the spread of FIV in domestic cat populations is highly influenced by the mating system. at the individual level, some cats are more aggressive than others. a male-biased sex-ratio may make the entire population more aggressive, making virus transmission more efficient and thus, higher disease prevalence. we sampled 15 cat populations in north-eastern France and measured FIV prevalence in males and females. we also measured five social indicators in order to measure how they correlated with FIV prevalence. commonly, risk factors are analyzed with logistic regression models. however, these models are built on the assumption that individuals become infected independently. the model is very simple, explains the data well, and thus constitutes an interesting tool for further understanding and control of the spread of FIV in these cat populations. the approach developed here can easily extend to many host-parasite interactions. the village of Sepvigny, connected to Champougny, could not be sampled for technical reasons. most of the cats were captured using baited traps; others being caught directly in their owner\u2019s houses. for each cat, we have recorded information on sex, age and serological status in relation to FIV. step 3: Model selection process. Different models are defined by setting some coefficients (ai) to 0. Hence, the probability of being infected only depends on the risk factors which associated coefficients are non-zero. model parameter p is bounded by 0 and 1. simplest model, i.e. where no model parameter depends on risk factors, is sufficient to describe the data. dynamic epidemiological model \u2013 Model H0 The aim of this framework is to study population risk factors. we assume that the mean age of cats in the population may act as a risk factor for FIV transmission. this is justified because we assume a proportionate mixing law for the incidence function of FIV between males, which is more appropriate in social species [22], [23]. males and females are infected from external sources at a rate M/M and F/F. the rates M and F are termed the external transmission rates. the model is based on a continuous-time Markov process. behavioural observations suggest networks of connectivity between the different populations. the objective is to estimate whether introducing this information on the probability of disease reintroductions within populations produces significant predictive improvements. a priori, the coefficients can have negative values and hence predict negative transmission rates. behavioral observations suggest a network of contacts between the different populations. we define the resulting \u201cneighboring\u201d models and \u201cmetapopulation\u201d models. a potential neighboring network has been suggested by behavioral observations. models cannot be directly compared with data because they predict distributions for the total number of infected and susceptible males and females in the population. data are just samples of the real total numbers, i.e. the probability of capture is strictly below 1. x,y,z is the hyper-geometric law of integer parameters x, y and z, which is defined when max(y,z) x for all integers t satisfying t min(x,y) and zt xy by: The distribution d is then equal to the distribution d0 after sampling a proportion 1/(1+pNC) of the population. the model predicts a distribution for the number of infected cats (male or female) each possible model outcome (defined as a vector of 30 integers representing the number of infected males and females within each of the 15 populations) has a probability of occurrence. accreditation has been granted to the UMR-CNRS 5558 (accreditation number 692660703) for the program. fifteen spatially separated rural cat populations were sampled during 2007 in north-eastern France. cats were anaesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamin chlorhydrate (Immalg\u00e8ne 1000 15 mg/kg, Rh\u00f4ne-M\u00e9rieux) and acepromazin (V\u00e9tranquil 5.5% 0.5 mg/kg, Sanofi) for each cat, we have recorded information on sex, age and serological status in relation to FIV. step 3: Model selection process. Different models are defined by setting some coefficients (ai) to 0. Hence, the probability of being infected only depends on the risk factors which associated coefficients are non-zero. there are two equivalent ways of presenting the classical approach. classical approach mainly because the model parameter p is bounded by 0 and 1. we have no reason to consider their logit value. in step 3 for model comparison we use likelihood ratio tests (LRT) rather than AIC. we assume that the mean age of cats in the population may act as a risk factor for FIV transmission. this is justified because we assume a proportionate mixing law for the incidence function of FIV between males, which is more appropriate in social species [22], [23] males and females are infected from external sources at a rate M/M and F/F. the rates are termed the external transmission rates. the model is based on a continuous-time Markov process. a priori, the coefficients can have negative values and hence predict negative transmission rates. a priori, the coefficients can have negative values and hence predict negative transmission rates. a priori, the coefficients can have negative values and hence predict negative transmission rates. behavioral observations suggest a network of contacts between the different populations. we define the resulting \u201cneighboring\u201d models and \u201cmetapopulation\u201d models. a potential neighboring network has been suggested by behavioral observations. models to data cannot be directly compared with data because they predict distributions for the total number of infected and susceptible males and females in the population. data are just samples of the real total numbers, i.e. the probability of capture is strictly below 1. we can calculate for each population k the probability of generating the number of infected males and females observed. we call it Lk(|Dk), where Dk represents the data restricted to population k; Dk is defined by the number of infected males and females. the model predicts a distribution for the number of infected cats (male or female) each possible model outcome (defined as a vector of 30 integers representing the number of infected males and females within each of the 15 populations) has a probability of occurrence. dpm,f/dt = 0. Maximum of the likelihood function are computed using a conjugate gradient method. it is assumed that all individuals have a same probability p to be infected, independently of the other individuals\u2019 status. the main difference between our approach and the classical one comes from the model used to describe the data. in step 2, the logit function is chosen in the classical approach mainly because the model parameter p is bounded by 0 and 1. males and females play different roles in the transmission of FIV. the sexual structure of the model is simply represented by splitting classes S and I into two sub-classes. the model includes both males (susceptible, SM or infected, IM) and females (susceptible, SF or infected, IF) we assume constant numbers of males (M) and females (F) within each population, whereby dead cats are instantaneously replaced by newborn cats. infected cats die at a rate a, but their death is not explicitly modeled. the distribution of the number of infected males given by the model can also be compared with male infection prevalence data. the distribution of the number of infected males given by the model can also be compared with male infection prevalence data. we define as H0 the model where and, the four model parameters (,, and ) being positive. models involving other parameters are called H(), where denotes the set of free (non-zero) parameters in the model that are not, and. then we investigate the possibility that, all other parameters being equal, the external transmission rates may differ between cat populations due to their spatial organization. we define the \u201cmale metapopulation model\u201d, where represents the value of in metapopulation i, and denotes the set of free parameters in the model. in this model the only parameter that differs between cat populations is, which varies between metapopulations. extinction events may succeed, and this being considered a population has a time-independent probability of being in each of its possible states. for each value of the free parameters, we can calculate for each population k the probability of generating the number of infected males and females actually observed. we consider a model H with a given set of freely varying parameters that defines a vector. each possible model outcome has a probability of occurrence. we want to determine the values of the free parameters for which the observed data is a plausible outcome. in the models the only parameter value we fix a priori is the mortality rate of infected individuals (a) infected cats have a 4-year life expectancy. the model time unit is the month. a total of 499 cats were sampled and tested for FIV in the 15 populations. a total of 499 cats were tested for FIV. the overall sex-ratio is close to 50% but with differences between populations, although it does not differ statistically from a 5050 binomial distribution (2 = 17.21, 15 df, p = 0.31) for each captured cat, we estimated its age following Pascal and Castanet [30], then the mean age of males and females in each population. for clarity, we plot the distribution of FIV prevalence as a continuous line. the probability of finding no infected cats in the population is high (17%). the mean prevalence of FIV is 12.66%. we plot the probability of FIV extinction from the population (dashed line, right axis) below a given threshold, the distribution of FIV prevalence is not affected by M. infrequent infections of FIV from external sources have almost no effect on FIV transmission within already infected populations. the probability of observing zero infected individuals is an important characteristic of the models. the only significant effect we found is associated with the effect of mean age of males and females on the male-to-female transmission rate. the effect of age on FIV prevalence observed here is not due to the accumulation of FIV cases with age. the p values are rather large (p = 0.02 and p = 0.043) but we cannot apply a simple Bonferroni correction for multiple tests because of dependence among the different tests performed. 102, M = 2.11102, F = 3.88102 1.14102 AFobs and F = 1.92102 for model. 102, M = 2.70102, M = 1.91102, F = 1.90102 5.30103 AMobs and F = 2.30102 for model. male transmission parameters are the most important for understanding and controlling FIV transmission. we can derive that a 95% confidence interval for the estimation of the basic reproductive number is [0.626, 1.942], with a maximum likelihood estimation of 1.285, for pNC = 0.30. in a same manner we can estimate a confidence interval for M([1.93103, 1.03101]), with a maximum likelihood estimation of 2.03102. if external infections have an important effect compared to the within-population transmissions, then R will be quite larger than 0.30. for pNC = 0.30 we calculate R in a square region of the male transmission rate (M and M) parameter space. we superimpose on the same graph the edge of the confidence region. Fig. 5 shows that there is an important dependency between F and F. Increasing the value of F increases the mean prevalence in females. the confidence region crosses the X and Y axis. the dynamic model predicts a very large variability of FIV prevalence in males within population. as a result observed FIV prevalence in males is always in the 95% confident region for the dynamic model, but not for the binomial model. population Cats sampled No. Males (sex ratio) FIV+ males FIV+ females FIV+ total Mean age of males Mean age of females Mean age of females Mean age of females Mean age of females (all) 28 12 (0.43) 4 (0.33) 1 (0.06) 5 (0.18) 3.79 4.46 Barisey-au-Plain (BaP) 24 10 (0.42) 2 (0.20) 1 (0.07) 3 (0.13) 4.75 4.57 05 Mont-l'Etroit (MoE) 19 10 (0.53) 0 (0) 0 (0) 2.40 2.37 Pagny-la-Blanche-C\u00f4te (PBC) 61 27 (0.44) 4 (0.15) 2 (0.06) 6 (0.10) 2.17 2.83 Punerot (Pun) 42 19 (0.45) 8 (0.42) 3 (0.13) 11 (0.26) 2.11 2.79 Ruppes (Rup) 29 23 (0.79) 6 for the entire study area the mean age is 3.08 years for males. for the entire study area the mean age is 3.55 years for females. there is a strong correlation between the mean age of males and females in the studied populations (r = 0.85) the mean prevalence of FIV is 12.66% and in 95% of the model outcomes the FIV prevalence ranges between 0 and 32%. the probability of finding no infected individuals in the population is much smaller (0.1%) and the confidence interval for FIV prevalence is [0.01; 0.20]. external infections are an important component of FIV transmission, even within already infected populations. this indicates that the external transmission rates of FIV within our populations must be large enough such that there are infected males in at least 13 out of the 15 populations. this indicates that external infections must be large enough such that there are infected males in at least 13 of the 15 populations. significant effect is associated with the effect of mean age of males (2 = 4.09, 1 df, p = 0.043) and females (2 = 5.335, 1 df, p = 0.02) on the male-to-female transmission rate. the effect of age on FIV prevalence observed here is not due to the accumulation of FIV cases with age. models where external transmission rates of FIV in males and females are proportional to the prevalence of FIV in neighboring populations (models and, respectively) under these circumstances, we find no significant improvement in the models compared to H0 (see Table 2). pNC = 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45. probability of observing zero infected individuals is an important characteristic of the models. removing extinction cases would lead to lose very important information. there is a negative correlation between the mean ages of males and females and FIV prevalence. this means that the effect of age on FIV prevalence observed here is not due to the accumulation of FIV cases with age. the p values are rather large (p = 0.02 and p = 0.043). the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is M = 2.71102, M = 1.91102, F = 4.4103 and F = 2.08102 for model H0; M = 2.66102, M = 2.11102, F = 3.88102 1.14102 AFobs and F = 1.92102 for model. we remove female prevalence data because there is no female to male transmission of the virus. we obtain a 95% confidence interval for the male-to-male transmission rate M ([1.30102, 4.05102]), with a maximum likelihood estimation of 2.68102 for pNC = 0.30. in a same manner we can estimate a confidence interval for M([1.93103, 1.03101]), with a maximum likelihood estimation of 2.03102. if external infections have a small effect compared to the within-population transmissions, then R will be close to 0. we calculate R in a square region of the male transmission rate (M and M) parameter space. we superimpose on the same graph the edge of the confidence region. Fig. 5 thus shows all paired values of F and F for which there exists concomitant values of the parameters M and M. the plotted region represents all paired values (F,F) for which there exists concomitant values of the parameters M and M. the observed data are a plausible outcome of the model. we remove female prevalence data from the analysis because there is no female to male transmission of the virus. in Fig. 4b we superimpose these three confidence regions; only showing their boundaries. pNC = 0.15 (solid thin line), pNC = 0.30 (bold solid line) and pNC = 0.45 (dashed thin line) we estimate the average size of a population as the mean number of observed males per population multiplied by 1+pNC, which is equal to 21 for pNC = 0.30. we focus on the simplest model. first, it is interesting to know if, and for which set of parameters, the simplest model can fit the data. second, since the effect of the mean age of populations is not highly significant, we do not believe it makes biological sense to take this factor into account. the data may be explained by considering only infection of females by males of the same population, without external infections or, conversely, by only considering infections by males from other populations without within-population male-to-female infections. we cannot determine which source of infection for females (internal or external) is most important in our study area. a result observed FIV prevalence in males is always in the 95% confident region for the dynamic model, but not for the binomial model. results show that the binomial model predicts a smaller variance than what is observed in the field. the dynamic model shows an overestimated variance compared to what is estimated from data (but only around 42% larger) a rapid study of the dynamic model shows that, in such a model, great variability in FIV prevalence may be expected. the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected depends on the proportion of infected individuals in a population. cat populations observed in this study are of small size, and certainly are not large enough to retain the virus over long periods of time. previous theoretical studies have shown the importance of the spatial dispersal of the virus between populations. logistic regression models are still widely used for the analysis of risk factors associated with infectious diseases. the main difference between the two approaches comes from the variability expected by their respective H0 models. the simple SI model accounts for the observed variability in FIV prevalence in males for a wide range of parameters. the approach developed here is general and can easily extend to a wide variety of cat populations, but also to other host-parasite systems. it facilitates selection of the best model to describe data, which can be calibrated by determining confidence regions for the model parameters. the model can be used to test virtual management plans and to look at the expected results in the entire confidence region. we performed a statistical analysis using the sexually-structured SI model. we found no such factors, except for mean ages. these ages have a negative effect on FIV prevalence in females, despite the accumulation of cases that occurs with age. a spatial correlation in FIV prevalence between connected populations can be observed only if external infections have a substantial impact on FIV prevalence within the population. in contrast, for the highest values of external transmission rate in the confidence region, we can expect a correlation in FIV prevalence between connected populations. dynamic models predict much more variability than models where individuals are independent and therefore are sufficient to explain highly variable prevalence data. the approach developed here is general and can easily extend to a wide variety of cat populations, but also to other host-parasite systems. experimental results indicate that most of the virus present in the saliva is not infectious. this is not surprising, since experimental results indicate that most of the virus present in the saliva is not infectious."}
