{"summary": "high-throughput multiplex detection techniques are designed for rapid, sensitive and specific testing of large numbers of analytes in a single biological sample. these techniques enable analysis of large numbers of samples. classical single reaction detection methods based on determination of nucleic acids such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) xMap Technology \u2013 in the Beginning were the Microspheres The principle of xMAP technology is based on the concept of a liquid (suspension) array. microsphere sets are internally dyed with two spectrally different fluorophores. integration of a third internal dye has allowed the expansion of up to 500-member microsphere sets. different concentrations of red and infrared fluorophores were used to create 100 distinct microsphere sets. each set is able to conjugate to a specific target molecule (yellow and orange lines = nucleic acid; green star = fluorescent reporter). there are different types of commercially available microspheres. agnetic 100 Flow cytometry-based Proteins SeroMAPTM 5.6 Non-magnetic 100 Flow cytometry-based Proteins FIGURE 2. Microsphere architecture. the polystyrene divinylbenzene core is formed by polystyrene methacrylic acid (infusion of dyes) the surface of each microsphere is irregular, porous and carboxylated. X\u00ae Magnetic microspheres Immobilization of microspheres in magnetic field 50 96-well plate Luminex100\u00ae/200TM All types of microspheres Flow cytometry-based 100 (80 with MagPlex) 96-well plate FlexMAP 3D\u00ae All types of microspheres Flow cytometry-based 500 96 and 384-well plate The basic detection instrument, which is called MAGPIX, is compatible only with magnetic microspheres (MagPlex and Mag the red classification laser/LED (635 nm) excites the inner fluorescent dyes of the microspheres, thus identifying a specific microsphere set according to its spectral signature. if the analyte of interest is present, the green reporter laser/LED (525\u2013532 nm) recognizes the fluorescent reporter bound to the captured analyte. a fluorescent imager of the MAGPIX system reads all the microspheres at once. reading of a 96-well-plate takes about 60 min. the maximum reading capacity of MAGPIX instruments is limited to 50 bead sets. multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay format (MOL-PCR) is able to simultaneously perform detection and identification, strain typing, detect antibiotic resistance determination, virulence prediction, etc. xMAP immunoassays surpass the common enzyme immunoassays in the ability of multiple simultaneous detection, while requiring less sample and lower cost. all target DNA sequences are amplified in multiplex PCR prior to hybridization to microspheres. the disadvantage is that in assays containing large amounts of targets multiplex PCR leads to amplification bias. in the multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay (MOL-PCR) sequence discrimination occurs before the amplification step. target DNA sequence is amplified, while one of the primers is fluorescently labeled. defining characteristic of ASPE is the extension of two allele-specific detection probes. ize to amplified target sequence after addition of DNA polymerase and dNTPs. specific detection probes are terminated one base before the polymorphic site. Oligonucleotide ligation-based formats include a ligation step of two oligonucleotide detection probes. the target DNA sequence is PCR-amplified prior to the ligation step of the annealed probes. the target DNA sequence is PCR-amplified prior to the ligation step of the annealed probes. the second detection probe is fully complementary to the target sequence and serves as a reporter due to its fluorescent label at the 3\u2032 end. the second detection probe is fully complementary to the target sequence. MOL-PCR is not susceptible to the amplification bias that is characteristic of multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay (MOL-PCR) only a minimal amount of target/sample is required. single-analyte ELISA cannot support simultaneous detection of multiple specific antibodies within a single serum sample. MBMIs represent an alternative for commonly used indirect tests like ELISA. MBMIs are often used in the diagnostics of various pathogens. CS assay uses microspheres covalently coupled with a capture antibody. a specific antibody against an antigen coupled with a microsphere is captured. if binding of serum antibody to antigen occurs, a labeled secondary antibody (anti-antibody) then provides the visualization. the disadvantage of these methods is that in assays containing large amounts of targets multiplex PCR leads to amplification bias. in the multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay (MOL-PCR) sequence discrimination by detection probes occurs before the amplification step. target DNA sequence is amplified, while one of the primers is fluorescently labeled. defining characteristic of ASPE is the extension of two allele-specific detection probes. single base chain extension (SBCE) is similar to the previously described ASPE. however, there are slight differences, mainly in the design of detection probes. Oligonucleotide ligation-based formats include a ligation step of two oligonucleotide detection probes. the target DNA sequence is PCR-amplified prior to the ligation step of the annealed probes. the target DNA sequence is PCR-amplified prior to the ligation step of the annealed probes. the second detection probe is fully complementary to the target sequence and serves as a reporter due to its fluorescent label at the 3\u2032 end. the second detection probe is fully complementary to the target sequence. MOL-PCR is not susceptible to the amplification bias that is characteristic of multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay (MOL-PCR) only a minimal amount of target/sample is required. the upgrade has the potential to have widespread impact on genomic assays. amplification of target sequences is ensured by specific primer pairs. one primer from each pair is fluorescently labeled at the 5\u2032 end. subsequent incubation of amplicon with microspheres leads to a direct and specific hybridization between matching capture and target sequences. the defining characteristic of ASPE is the extension of two allele-specific detection probes. DNA polymerase can extend detection probes by incorporation of dNTPs. the fluorescence signal is generated by a fluorophore bound to labeled dNTPs. dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) terminators serve as a \u201cquery\u201d nucleotide. they are used for single base probe extension at the same time. this assay requires the setting up of separate reactions for each of the four ddNTPs (ddC, ddG, ddA, and ddT) the target DNA sequence is PCR-amplified prior to the ligation step of the annealed probes. the target DNA sequence is PCR-amplified prior to the ligation step of the annealed probes. the second detection probe is fully complementary to the target sequence. multiplex oligonucleotide ligation PCR assay represents improved version of previous OLA assay format. one of the detection probes consists of a sequence complementary to the target sequence and an extension composed of the TAG sequence and primer binding site. the second probe is the same as the first except for the absence of the TAG sequence. amplicon hybridizes via its TAG sequence to capture anti-TAG on the microsphere. the upgrade has the potential to have widespread impact on genomic assays. MBMIs are often used in the diagnostics of various pathogens. the methods of choice are usually Capture Sandwich (CS) and Indirect Serological Assay (ISA) however, the problems typical for methods based on serology remain. ISA is typically used for serological screenings (monitoring and prevention purposes) that are carried out on serum samples. microspheres covalently coupled with a capture antibody (polyclonal antibodies should be purified and mono-specific) that takes up target molecules from the sample. CS format can be used in cases where confirmation of pathogen identity within the inflammatory focus or altered tissue is needed. the majority of applications that enable multiplex viral detection and identification are based on the capture of viral nucleic acid by adoption of various DDH modifications. the majority of applications that enable multiplex viral detection and identification are based on the capture of viral nucleic acid by adoption of various DDH modifications. xTAG RVP is multiplex nucleic acid test designed for detection of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in human nasopharyngeal swabs. xTAG RVP is multiplex nucleic acid test designed for detection of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids. xTAG RVP can detect all the respiratory viral targets included in the in-house NAT panel. of the 1,530 samples tested, 532 were positive by xTAG RVP and 580 by in-house NATs for these targets. this gives the xTAG RVP a sensitivity of 91.2% and a specificity of 99.7%. parainfluenza virus type 2 and human coronavirus 229E were not detected using xTAG RVP Fast. the sensitivity for detection of IFVB was very low (41.3%) the MBMNA was successfully applied for detection of viral pathogens causing acute viral gastroenteritis. xTAG\u00ae Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel - GPP is commercially available. only three enteric viruses (norovirus, rotavirus and adenovirus 40/41) can be identified by the GPP. the method enables a more comprehensive coverage of HPV types compared with the previously mentioned study, where only 26 types of HPV were genotyped. the method was more sensitive than the Linear Array (a leading commercial genotyping method) in terms of distinguishing positive/negative HPV samples, but less sensitive for detection of multiple HPV types. a total of 532 samples were tested in 11-plex BVPA-1 and 540 field 8-plex BVPA-2. both developed assays were proven to be reliable and accurate. a number of pathogens, including viruses, are implicated in reproductive diseases of swine. MBMI was compared with a Western blot assay for the detection of HIV-specific antibodies. the microspheres were coupled with anti-p24 monoclonal antibody and with HIV antigens: gp41, p17, p24, p31, and p66 recombinant protein. the most widely used approaches are based on the DDH, ligation assays or ASPE, but multiplex detection of bacteria may be performed as well using MBMI. the most widely used approaches are based on the DDH, ligation assays or ASPE. there were limitations to the method, including the limited number of clinically significant pathogens or the inability to detect diarrheagenic E. coli, protozoa, or viruses. the full capacity of the assay was utilized when the panel was expanded to include the most common bacterial/viral enteropathogens found in stool samples. xTAG\u00ae Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel is a multiplex nucleic acid test designed for detection of various bacterial, viral and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool samples. the panel allows qualitative detection of Campylobacter sp., Clostridium difficile (toxin A/B), Escherichia coli O157, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) LT/ST, Shigella sp., Vibrio samples with discordant results between routine tests and xTAG GPP were tested by singleplex PCR and sequencing. the overall sensitivity of xTAG GPP was 96.3% and specificity was 99.8%. xTAG GPP is also capable of detecting coinfections; 35 coinfections were detected using xTAG GPP. OLigo pair probes were designed and tested using similar species of Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis. the final probe panel was validated on extracted DNA from infected rodent liver and spleen. results also showed the ability of this method to simultaneously detect multiple different signatures. both methods were of comparative cost. MOL-PCR was ideal for classification of unknown isolates. TaqMan qPCR was faster for confirmation of unknown isolates. immunoassays were successfully applied for detection of organism-specific antibodies using microspheres coupled with antibodies for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and Listeria. MBMI was also applied to test bacterial contamination of foods through the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), staphylococcal toxin A (SEA), and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) from urine samples. tic zoonoses are recorded worldwide and some of them have endemic character. parasitic agents may pass from animals to humans in several ways, e.g., by direct contact, vector, consumption of raw or undercooked foodstuffs containing the infective stages or by infective stages released into environment. current diagnosis of some parasitic diseases is based only on combination of clinical signs, anamnesis, and direct visual identification of parasitological objects. oplasma gondii Protozoa In fresh produce, fruit juice, milk Entamoeba histolytica Protozoa In fresh produce Trichinella spiralis Worm Pork Opisthorchiidae Flatworm in fresh water fish Ascaris sp. 80% of all cases of diarrhea remain without confirmed etiology. the final calculated sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 100%. the results of both assays were equivalent or better in comparison to the parent multiplex qPCR. xTAG GPP tool enables inter alia detection of the protozoa G. intestinalis, E. histolytica and Cryptosporidium sp. the most studied group of parasites are representatives from the phylum Nematoda. the larvae may infect humans during the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat. inspection of meat for the most important species, Trichinella spiralis, is mandatory at slaughter. the xMAP technology-ISA showed 87% sensitivity and 95% specificity in comparison with the commercial Pourquier ELISA. the recombinant antigens were used to detect toxocara-specific antibodies in sera from humans pre-diagnosed as positive for visceral and ocular larval migrans. tachyzoite surface protein (SAG-1) was used for simultaneous serological detection in a set with T. spiralis E/S. the results exactly reflected the load of infection; sensitivity was 86% and specificity was 96% for T. gondii. majority of xMAP applications for the multiplex detection and identification of fungal pathogens are based on the capture of fungal nucleic acid by DDH assays. the xMAP technology was used for genotyping of human pathogenic Fusarium sp. the Candida 7-plex assay was tested within 43 of Candida strains and 16 bacterial strains with no-cross-reaction with any of the bacterial strains. the assay correctly identified all species of Aspergillus, with 100% specificity and sensitivity except A. niger. the xTAG\u00ae Fungal ASR assay is an attractive alternative to reference methods. it is able to identify the fungal pathogens, but it can be used for a genotyping of fungal pathogens. the detection limit was calculated from 4 101 to 2 103 cells for each of the six genotypic groups. multiplex Detection and Typing of Viruses are a very diverse group of infectious agents. they can be classified according to a number of properties, e.g., type of nucleic acid, the presence of the viral envelope, antigenic structure, mode of transmission, pathogenicity, etc. amplification is carried out with a single set of universal primers where only one primer is labeled. the background is low and no post-PCR cleanup is required. commercial kits have also been developed for the detection of respiratory viruses by xMAP. xTAG RVP can detect all the respiratory viral targets included in the in-house NAT panel. of the 1,530 samples tested, 532 were positive by xTAG RVP and 580 by in-house NATs for these targets. xTAG RVP includes all the respiratory viral targets tested routinely for the diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections. xTAG RVP was more sensitive than xTAG RVP Fast. some targets were not detected using xTAG RVP Fast. sensitivity for detection of IFVB was very low (41.3%) human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), enterovirus (EV), rotavirus (RoV), norovirus GI (NoVGI) and norovirus GI (NoVGII) environmental water samples were tested. the detection limit was higher than qPCR for viral detection in wastewater samples. the 26-plex method discriminated all 18 high-risk HPV targets and also 8 low-risk HPV targets. another study focused on genotyping HPV also used specific probes targeting a region of the L1 gene. the method enables a more comprehensive coverage of HPV types compared with the previously mentioned study. a total of 532 samples were tested in 11-plex BVPA-1 and 540 field 8-plex BVPA-2. both developed assays were proven to be reliable and accurate. a number of pathogens, including viruses, are implicated in reproductive diseases of swine. xMAP antibody-based tests for the detection and typing of viruses are also available. MBMI was used to develop a competitive immunoassay that measures HPV type 6, 11, 16 and 18 specific neutralizing antibodies. MBMI was also compared with a Western blot assay for the detection of HIV-specific antibodies. multiplexed microsphere assay has powerful potential to allow serological diagnosis of NPC in the future. MBMI showed increased sensitivity and the possibility of quantifying antibodies, antigens, as well as other substances (e.g., hormones, cytokines, tumor markers, etc.) the authors showed that the DDH was more specific than traditional methods for typing of Salmonella. in most cases, DDH is used only for the detection of pathogens. there were limitations to the method, which included the limited number of clinically significant pathogens. the xTAG\u00ae Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel is a multiplex nucleic acid test designed for detection of various bacterial, viral and parasitic nucleic acids in human stool samples. the panel allows qualitative detection of Campylobacter sp., Clostridium difficile (toxin A/B), Escherichia coli O157, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) LT/ST, Shiga-like toxin producing E. xTAG GPP was tested and compared with routine tests. samples with discordant results between routine tests and xTAG GPP were tested by singleplex PCR and sequencing. sensitivity of xTAG GPP was 96.3% and specificity 99.8%. MOL-PCR was initially optimized for the detection of the biothreat agents Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis. the pathogen-specific sets of MOLigo pair probes were designed and their specificity and sensitivity were tested using similar species of Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis. mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was based on two phylogenetically equivalent sets of SNP markers that are specific for the six main human-associated lineages of MTBC. both methods were of comparative cost. MOL-PCR was ideal for classification of unknown isolates. MBMI is a suitable method for multiplex detection of bacteria occurring in foodstuffs. MBMI was combined with the Binax NOW Streptococcus pneumonia. the specificity of MBMI was determined by testing 85 serotypes of S. pneumoniae and other strains of streptococci. 18 of the 26 non-pneumococcal serotypes gave C-P positive results. MBMI could be used for diagnosis of infection caused by S. pneumoniae. the presence of parasites in stool may vary and could be naturally low, requiring multiple sampling. up to 80% of all cases of diarrhea remain without confirmed etiology. several pioneering works have been published in relation to this topic. to date, improved multiplex qPCR assays were adapted to DDH. separate reactions were optimized \u2013 3-plex for protozoa. microsphere-based assays can be arranged also as multiplex indirect immunoassays. ELISA still represents the gold standard in serodiagnostics for screening of individual human/animal samples at a population level. recently, some studies have been done to improve the potential of this serological method and to upgrade it to the multiplex level. xMAP technology-ISA exhibited 87% sensitivity and 95% specificity in comparison with the commercial Pourquier ELISA. recombinant antigens Tc-CTL-1 and Tc-TES-26 were used to detect toxocara-specific antibodies in sera from humans pre-diagnosed as positive for visceral and ocular larval migrans. unicellular parasitic protozoa ISA was tested in representatives from the genus Toxoplasma. no regulations for meat control exist for T. spiralis, even though its prevalence is higher. majority of xMAP applications for the multiplex detection and identification of fungal pathogens are based on the capture of fungal nucleic acid by DDH assays. studies using xMAP technology were developed and successfully used to identify individual fungal species within Candida sp. xMAP incorrectly identified some of Fusarium isolates. sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 100% for each species. commercial kits have also been developed for the detection of fungal pathogens. mold 11-plex assay developed specifically for the detection of specific species of mold. results showed that xTAG\u00ae Fungal ASR assay could be used as an adjunct to culture. the results showed that DDH is highly specific method. it is possible not only identify cryptococcal isolates at the species and genotype levels. but also allows identification of hybrid isolates that have two alleles of the specific probes region. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
