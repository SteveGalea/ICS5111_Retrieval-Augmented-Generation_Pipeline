{"summary": "despite intense research efforts over nearly three decades, only minimal progress has been made in developing an HIV-1 vaccine. the most vulnerable regions may only be accessible for a short period. these short-lived structures include the so-called CD4 induced (CD4i) in gp120 and the pre-hairpin epitopes in gp41 that are only exposed following CD4 receptor binding. HK20 targets HR1 instead of MPER or glycans in this region. it has the conceptual advantage over 4E10 and 2F5 of avoiding potential auto reactivity. mAbs have been found to confer protection in infant rhesus monkeys by the group of Ruprecht. mAbs HJ16, HGN194 and HK20 showed considerable breadth of neutralizing activity against a panel of HIV-1 primary isolates spanning both tier 1 and tier 2 viruses. the results clearly demonstrate that patient selection was highly dependent on the neutralization assay format. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine. cells were stimulated with 0.5 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) for 2 days and 1 day with 200 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2; Gentaur, Brussels, Belgium) in a 7% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C and then used for neutralization assays. all isolates were classified by phylogenetic analysis of their envelope genes. all virus stocks were prepared and titrated on PBMC stimulated. these strains have been extensively used for at least 10 years at ITM. PBMC neutralization assays are described as a/b/c where \u2018a\u2019 is the incubation time in hours following mixing of mAb with virus, \u2018c\u2019 is the culture time in days (all at 37\u00b0C and 7% CO2). incubation, \u2018short incubation\u2019 and \u2018extended absorption\u2019 assays respectively. titer below 1 constitutes poor growth of the virus. ninety l of each virus dilution are mixed with 5 l of plasma or 50 g mAb. nonidet P40 (0.25% in PBS; Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Puurs, Belgium) to disrupt virions. pooled plasma of 100 HIV-1 negative donors are tested in parallel. times of incubation are appropriately adjusted: 1/2/7 and 1/24/14 respectively. GHOST cells were seeded in each well of 96-well, flat bottom plates and infected with a range of viral doses in a total volume of 200 l. mAb concentration or plasma dilution producing a 50% reduction in luciferase reporter gene production was determined by linear regression analysis. the infectious virus titer was calculated following virus incubation with mAb/plasma. the reduction in titer was calculated as a percentage of the virus titer following exposure to either IgG or plasma which was pooled from 100 HIV-1 negative donors. cells were stimulated with 0.5 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) for 2 days and 1 day with 200 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2; Gentaur, Brussels, Belgium) cell lines were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. all isolates were classified by phylogenetic analysis of their envelope genes. all virus stocks were prepared and titrated on PBMC stimulated. these strains have been extensively used for at least 10 years at ITM. PBMC neutralization assays are described as a/b/c where \u2018a\u2019 is the incubation time in hours following mixing of mAb with virus, \u2018c\u2019 is the culture time in days. cells are then washed and \u2018c\u2019 is the culture time in days. a titer below 1 constitutes poor growth of the virus and the experiment is discarded. ninety l of each virus dilution are mixed with 5 l of plasma or 50 g mAb. natant are mixed with 50 l Nonidet P40 (0.25% in PBS; Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Puurs, Belgium) to disrupt virions. pooled plasma of 100 HIV-1 negative donors are tested in parallel. times of incubation are adjusted: 1/2/7 and 1/24/14 respectively. 1.104 TZMbl or GHOST cells were seeded in each well of 96-well, flat bottom plates and infected with a range of viral doses in a total volume of 200 l. mAb concentration or plasma dilution producing a 50% reduction in luciferase reporter gene production was determined by linear regression analysis in Microsoft Office Excel. PBMC neutralization assays are described as a/b/c where \u2018a\u2019 is the incubation time in hours following mixing of mAb with virus. \u2018b\u2019 is the absorption time in hours during which the cells are exposed to the mAb/virus mixture. cells are then washed and \u2018c\u2019 is the culture time in days. MC in 100 l culture medium are added to each well. cells are washed three times by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. cells are then left in a CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C during the absorption phase. luciferase reporter gene activity was quantified 48\u201372 h after cell lysis. infection of TZMbl cells was quantified using SteadyLite as a substrate. infection of GHOST cells was quantified using BriteLite as a substrate. mAbs or plasma were pre-incubated with PV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. an ID50 for plasma and IC50 for Abs were calculated from a dilution series starting from 120 for plasma and starting from 50 or 150 g for Abs. in the virus dilution series, doses ranged between those infecting all cultures (100%) to those infecting none (0%). titer was calculated following virus incubation with mAb/plasma. about 25% of patients had cross-neutralizing plasma. plasma which neutralized at least 50% of strains belonging to one subtype plus at least 25% of strains from a second. we then classified the best responding plasma according to the HIV subtype they preferentially neutralized. 91,1 63,7 74,3 93,7 91,1 73,7 88,3 97,2 96,1 E HVDA-plasma C 24,1 70,5 86,8 66,1 0,0 99,9

plasma was originally determined using a panel of 14 replication competent clinical HIV-1 isolates (four subtype A, four subtype C and six CRF02_AG strains, Table 2). in view of the known neutralization resistance of these isolates [8], they were considered to represent \u2018tier 2 like\u201d strains. the 242315-HJ patient plasma has a very broad neutralization spectrum. 21 of the 26 viruses neutralized, including all the C and CRF01 strains, 75% of the subtype A, B and D strains and 67% of CRF02 strains. the 529552-HK plasma neutralized 12/26 viruses, including 75% of the C strains, 67% of the CRF02 strains, 50% of the A strains and 25% of the B, D and CRF01 strain three strains from our primary selection panel were added. three strains from the \u201cNeutNet\u201d panel were also available. virus titer is highlighted in bold for the PBMC assays. 50% reduction in virus titer is highlighted in bold for the cell line based assays. no correlation was found between the

much more restricted range of isolates than the plasma. mAb had no activity against any of the extra isolates. plasma showed their broadest range of neutralization in the 24/1/14 assays. plasma showed their broadest range of neutralization in the 24/1/14 assays. the range of HIV-1 isolates neutralized by both the plasma and mAbs is greatest in the extended incubation 24/1/14 PBMC assay. only three of the 36 mAb/isolate combinations show significant neutralizing activity in the extended absorption 1/24/14 PBMC assay. the HK20 mAb only neutralizes VI 1888. the HK20 mAb neutralizes VI 882 in the GHOST_PV assay, SF162 in the TZMbl_PV assay and does not neutralize any infectious virus. there was no consistent statistically significant correlation between the levels of neutralization reached in the 24/1/14 PBMC assay and the others. plasma from the 242315-HJ patient is very effective against the three tier 1 strains and also against five out of 11 tier 2 strains. the HGN194 mAb is also able to neutralize the tier 1 strains and three out of 11 tier 2 strains. patients' plasma was initially selected in 24/1/14 PBMC assays and the ITM panel of 14 primary infectious HIV-1 isolates. the 242315-HJ plasma neutralized six isolates (50%), the 314994-HGN plasma neutralized four (33.3%) and the 529552-HK plasma neutralized all but one (92%) of the PV in the TZMbl assay. subtype A, subtype

and CRF02 subtype specific (HMQ plasma) the remaining five interrogated patients did not display this subtype specific behavior. there is no obvious association between the subtype infecting a patient and that neutralized by his or her plasma. patients 314994-HGN and 529552-HK were not receiving antiretroviral treatment during this study. her viral loads varied between undetectable and 2,700 RNA

plasma (e.g. subtype A 92RW009 with 242315-HJ plasma versus HJ16 mAb the range of HIV-1 isolates neutralized by both the plasma and mAbs is greatest in the extended incubation 24/1/14 PBMC assays. only three of the 36 mAb/isolate combinations show significant neutralizing activity in the extended absorption 1/24/14 PBMC assay. the HGN194 mAb neutralizes three (SF162, VI 1888 and VI 1090) of the six isolates. the HK20 mAb neutralizes VI 1888 while the corresponding plasma does not produce significant neutralization against any isolate in these assays. the HK20 mAb only neutralizes VI 882 in the GHOST_PV assay, SF162 in the TZMbl_PV assay. plasma ID50 1 in 100, Ab IC50 50 g (see Mat & Meth) was tested at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with different concentrations starting from 150 g for their capacity to neutralize HIV-1 PV. plasma from the 242315-HJ patient is very effective against the three tier 1 strains and also against five out of 11 tier 2 strains. the corresponding HJ16 mAb is not able to neutralize the tier 1 strains and also against six out of 11 tier 2 strains. 14 isolates tested at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. the present study is based on an extensive program to employ naturally occurring broadly neutralizing Abs from HIV-infected patients as templates for immunogen design against A, C and CRF02 primary viruses. a side-by-side comparison of the different neutralization assays used for characterization of these patients' plasma and the newly isolated Abs showed that the broadest spectrum of strains and subtypes was neutralized in the PV assays as well as in the 24/1/14 extended incubation PBMC assay with primary virus. in contrast, the classical short incubation phase assays as well as the extended absorption phase PBMC assays showed a reduction in the number of neutralized strain one reason could be the polyclonal character of the Abs in the plasma. cross-neutralization may require interaction between Abs acting at several epitopes. this would be buttressed by methods to directly determine the number of individual neutralizing antibody clones. the inference was that specific quaternary protein structures should be used in a primary screening. it should also be noted that the Abs in the plasma probably originate in the plasma cells of the bone marrow while the mAbs are isolated from memory B cells. a possible reason for any increased sensitivity of primary vs. pseudo viruses for identifying patients with potent neutralizing Abs could be the higher number of envelope glycoprotein spikes on the primary viruses relative to the PV [28] an alternative factor might be the density of (co)receptors on target cells, which has been implied by Corti et al who reported potent neutralization by HK20 in the HOS assays. the most compelling demonstration that pre-existing Abs can be protective comes from passive immunization studies with either IgG or mAbs [28], [34], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [46], [47], [48], [49]. a single neutralizing mAb from each of the three patients does not reflect the major neutralizing spectrum of the patients' plasma. that can be used for HIV-1 immunogen design and subsequent vaccine development."}
