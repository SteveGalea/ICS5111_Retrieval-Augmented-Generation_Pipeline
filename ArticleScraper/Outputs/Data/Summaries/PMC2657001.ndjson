{"summary": "the ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat. a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. the greatest threats posed by this virus are its ability to cause mortality in humans, its potential to compromise food supplies, and its possible economic impacts. an effective, safe poultry vaccine that elicits broadly protective immune responses to evolving flu strains would provide a countermeasure to reduce the likelihood of transmission of this virus from domestic birds to humans. DNA vaccines have been used experimentally against various infectious agents in a variety of mammals. there is only one previous report of a monovalent DNA vaccine effective against H5N1. no protection with multivalent DNA vaccines against heterologous strains has been reported. there is a potential countermeasure against HPAI H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks. expression vectors encoding HAs from ten phylogenetically diverse strains of influenza viruses [33] were generated by synthesis of cDNAs in plasmid expression vectors, pCMV/R or pCMV/R 8B. lentiviral assay inhibition (LAI) yields similar results to microneutralization and HAI analyses with higher sensitivity in mice. groups of mice (n = 10) were immunized with 15 g of individual H5 HA DNA expression vectors, pCMV/R 8B, encoding the HA of indicated viruses. a combination of 10 HA vaccine immunogens was administered IM at proportionally lower concentration (1.5 g per immunogen) into groups of 10 mice. significant neutralizing antibody titers were generated to each of the 10 immunogens, with >80% neutralization against 6 out of 12 H5 HA pseudoviruses at dilutions of up to 1400. breadth of neutralization against divergent HAs is determined by the composition of multivalent HA plasmid DNA expression vectors. pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Egypt/2782-NAMRU3/2006), and pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006). mice were immunized with 15 g of plasmid (3 g each) three times at 3 week intervals. neutralization of homologous strains was comparable to monovalent and the 10 immunogen multivalent immune response. fewer cross-reactive antibodies were detected, directed most prominently against A/Iraq/207-NAMRU3/2006 and A/Egypt/ 2782-NAMRU3/2006. fewer cross-reactive antibodies were detected. immunity with HA derived from the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain showed a survival rate approaching 90%. animals injected with HA plasmid DNA derived from A/Anhui/1/2005 showed a lower percent survival (70%) after lethal viral challenge. animals were challenged 68 weeks later by intranasal inoculation. all control mice died 10 days after infection. the ability of chickens to generate specific antibodies was assessed. almost all chickens immunized with either monovalent or multivalent HA DNA vaccines generated significant neutralization titers. neutralization of the Indonesia HA strain was the most robust, with neutralization nearing 100% at titers greater than 13200. monovalent and multivalent vaccines elicited robust homologous and heterologous HA neutralization. vaccinated chickens were inoculated with 20 LD50 of highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 heterologous virus intranasally using standard methods [25], [40] and monitored for morbidity, mortality, viral shedding and serum antibodies. chickens were immunized with either trivalent HA encoding plasmids. pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005) plus pCMV/R-HA(A/Vietnam/1203/2004) with pCMV/R-HA(A/Vietnam/1203/2004) with agro-Jet\u00ae twice or three times. a total of 500 g plasmid DNA was used controls died 4 days after infection by intranasal inoculation. the GMT HI in each group two weeks post-challenge were: Control: not done (n = 0); Trivalent by needle (500 g): 325 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (50 g): 120 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (5 g): 197 (n = 8); Trivalent by needle (0.5 g): 200 (n = 2). dose-response study was performed with amounts of DNA vaccine ranging from 500 to 0.5 g with two inoculations. the observed rate of protection was higher among the animals receiving 5 g by Agro-Jet (8/8) than by IM injection (6/8) both modes provided complete protection for all animals at doses higher than this. we assessed viable viral shedding after inoculation by chick embryo inoculation three days after virus challenge. there was no embryonic lethality at 5, 50 or 500 g groups. immunogenicity and neutralizing antibody specificity of alternative HA DNA vaccines in mice. sera from mice immunized with plasmid DNA vaccines neutralize a homologous and heterologous HA with differing efficacy. groups of mice (n = 10) were immunized as described in Materials and Methods with 15 g of individual H5 HA genes. a combination of 10 HA DNA vaccine immunogens was administered IM at proportionally lower concentration (1.5 g per immunogen) into groups of 10 mice. despite a log lower DNA concentration of each component, significant neutralizing antibody titers were generated to each of the 10 immunogens. pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Hong Kong/156/1997), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Egypt/2782-NAMRU3/2006), and pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/ immunized serum neutralized all tested pseudotyped lentiviruses at low dilutions. differences were often observed at high dilutions. fewer cross-reactive antibodies were detected in one set. control animals were then challenged with 10 LD50 of the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus intranasally. complete survival was observed in the groups immunized with the 10 component and set 2 of the 5 component multivalent DNA vaccines. animals injected with HA plasmid DNA derived from A/Anhui/1/2005 showed a lower percent survival (70%) after lethal viral challenge. mice were immunized with 15 g total of either the 10 HA as in Fig. 2A, legend and Materials and Methods, 5 HA (Set 1) as in Fig. 2B, legend and Materials and Methods, 5 HA (Set 2) as in Fig. 2B, legend and Materials and Methods. mice were challenged 68 weeks later by intranasal inoculation. the injection conditions were determined by histologic analysis of tissues that received injections of india ink. a pressure of 48 psi was chosen because it enabled consistent delivery into intradermal and subcutaneous tissues. almost all chickens immunized with either monovalent or multivalent HA DNA vaccines generated significant neutralization titers. pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005), pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005) and pCMV/R-HA(A/Vietnam/1203/2004) was analyzed after immunization with trivalent HA encoding plasmids. neutralization was determined by individual chickens at titers ranging from 1100 to 13200. chickens were immunized with either trivalent HA encoding plasmids. a total of 500 g plasmid DNA was used in each injection for all groups. control animals died 2 days after infection by nasal inoculation. the GMT HI in each group two weeks post-challenge were: Control: 80 (n = 1); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (500 g): 580 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (50 g): 183 (n = 8); Trivalent by Agro-Jet (0.5 g): 200 (n = 2). a dose-response study was performed with amounts of DNA vaccine ranging from 500 to 0.5 g with two inoculations. the observed rate of protection was higher among the animals receiving 5 g by Agro-Jet (8/8) than by IM injection (6/8) both modes provided complete protection for all animals at doses higher than this. there were no differences between control and 0.5 g or between 5, 50, and 500 g. survival differences between IM and Agro-Jet were not significant. the neutralizing antibody response to homologous and heterologous HAs corresponded with protection and correlated with dose, with higher titers elicited by injection with needle. DNA vaccines offer several advantages, including ability to express diverse antigens, ease of delivery, and stability for storage and distribution without the necessity of maintaining a cold chain. they do not contain other viral proteins used to screen for infection, but address the need to differentiate vaccinated from infected animals. 3 components of HA including A/Vietnam/1203/2004, A/Indonesia/05/2005, and A/Anhui/1/2005 HA were tested as the vaccine candidate in the challenge study. effective protective immunity could be induced with two DNA vaccinations and as little as 5 g trivalent DNA immunization using the ID/SC route with the Agro-Jet\u00ae device. the virus was propagated in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs at 35\u00b0C. the virus was titrated by the Reed and Muench method to determine EID50. cDNAs from diverse strains of influenza viruses were then inserted into plasmid expression vectors. the immunogens used in DNA vaccination contained a cleavage site mutation. the mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuickChange kit. all experiments were approved by the Vaccine Research Center Animal Care and Use Committee. pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006), and pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/N pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Hong Kong/483/1997), and pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Iraq/207-NAMRU3/2006). serum was collected 10 days after the last vaccination. group 5 received subcutaneous immunizations via needle and syringe with pCMV/R-HA(A/Vietnam/1203/2004) and group 6 received intramuscular immunizations via needle and syringe with pCMV/R-HA(A/Indonesia/05/2005) cloacal and tracheal swabs were collected from each animal on days 3 and 5 post challenge. needle-free injector Agro-Jet\u00ae is a needle-free device used for mass delivery of vaccines and drugs in livestock and poultry. the device is semi-automatic and requires a small CO2 tank or compressed air for low pressure delivery. Upon trigger activation, CO2 disperses the injectate at a precise dose into the muscle, dermis or subcutaneous tissue. chickens were infected with 200 l virus intranasally. tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected days 3 and 5 post-challenge. blood was collected 14 days post-challenge and serum was titered by microneutralization assay. samples were brought to a final dilution of 110 using PBS. each sample was serially diluted and virus, diluted to 100 TCID50, was added to each well. the plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 1\u20132 hours. supernatants were used to infect a second 96-well plate of MDCK cells. the sera/virus mixture was then added to 293A cells in 96-well B&W TC Isoplates (Wallac, Turku, Finland; 12,000 cells/well) cells were lysed in mammalian cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) 24 hrs after infection and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) rating 50 l of antiserum treated with receptor-destroying enzyme was added to each well. HI titers were calculated after 30 minutes as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited hemagglutination. cDNAs from diverse strains of influenza viruses were then inserted into plasmid expression vectors, pCMV/R or pCMV/R 8B. the immunogens used in DNA vaccination contained a cleavage site mutation (PQRERRRKKRG to PQRETRG) as previously described. pCMV/R 8B, pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Hong Kong/156/1997), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/chicken/ pCMV/R 8B-HA (Set 2) group contained: pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004), pCMV/R 8B-HA(A/Hong Kong/483/1997), and pCMV/R group 1\u20134 received intradermal/subcutaneous immunizations via Agro-Jet\u00ae. group 5 received subcutaneous immunizations via needle and syringe. group 6 received intramuscular immunizations via needle and syringe. pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006) using 500 g (167 g of each of the three plasmids), 50 g (17 g of each plasmid), 5 g (1.7 g of each plasmid), 0.5 g (0.17 g of each plasmid) and a 500 g control vector administered chickens were bled and humanely euthanized at day 14 post-challenge. any mouse that had lost more than 25% of its body weight was euthanized. all experiments were conducted in an AAALAC accredited facility. infect 10 day-old embryonated chicken eggs in 10-fold dilutions. three eggs were inoculated per dilution and incubated for 48 hours before titration. microneutralization assay performed using a 96-well plate format. the recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced as previously described [35], [36] for the neutralization assay, antisera from immunized animals were heat-inactivated at 55\u00b0C for 30 minutes. the sera/virus mixture was then added to 293A cells in 96-well B&W TC Isoplates (Wallac, Turku, Finland; 12,000 cells/well) two hours later HA titers were calculated using 50 l of 0.5% chicken red blood cell suspension in PBS added to 50 l of two-fold dilutions of virus in PBS. this mix was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. HI titers were calculated by titrating 50 l of antiserum treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and an equivalent amount of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 virus was added to each well. pCMV/R-HA(A/Anhui/1/2005), pCMV/R-HA(A/indonesia/05/2005), and pCMV/R-HA(A/chicken/Nigeria/641/2006) in the dose response study at the indicated DNA vaccine doses were analyzed. dilution of the serum with IC50 activity are shown."}
