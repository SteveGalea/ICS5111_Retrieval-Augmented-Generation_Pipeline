{"summary": "a technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. nized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS. limited data exist on prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in different hospital settings. PCR/ESI-MS has been used to characterize virulence factors, toxin-encoding genes and antibiotic resistance determinants on isolated colonies. elements from previous studies were consolidated into a single PCR/ESI-MS research application to directly screen nasal swabs from sample of 200 patients. Swab Plus double applicators were inserted into both left and right nostril of each study subject. analysis of clinical specimens Swabs were inoculated into mannitol salts broth and allowed to sit for 5 minutes at room temperature. swabs were then expressed into broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours. 629229 5\u2032-TGGTACACCTGGTTTTTTTGATGATTTGTA-3\u2032 B BCT2249 tufB NC_002758.2 5\u2032-TGAACGTGGTCAAATCAAAGTTGGTGAAGA-3\u2032 [14] 615038..616222 5\u2032-TGTCACCAGCTTCTAATAA-3\u2032 BCT2163 yqi NC_003923 5\u2032-TAGATAATTGGGCTCTCTC-3\u2032 [ lukE-lukD NC_003923 5\u2032-TGGAAAACTGTATTGGATAG-3\u2032 [14] 1529595. 1531285 5\u2032-TGGAAAACTCATGAAATTAAAGTGAAAGGA-3\u2032 BCT2149 aroE NC_003923 5\u2032-TGGGGCTTTAAATATTCCAATTGAAGATTTTCA-3\u2032 [13] 1674546. aRow indicates the row of a 96-well assay plate. two primer pairs are present in each well of the assay plate. the current assay used eight amplification/mass spectrometry measurements. DNA from nasal swabs was distributed into eight wells of a microtiter plate. amplicons were analyzed by ESI-MS. each well contained two pairs of primers as indicated in Table 1. the enrollment of patients was a sample of convenience during hours when the study coordinator was available. we excluded patients with previously known risk factors for MRSA colonization [16-18] such as patients with fever greater than 100.4\u00b0F. samples were streaked on a ChromAgar (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA) plate. samples were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C. 830771..830799 5\u2032-TGGTACAACATCGTTAGCTTTACCACTTTCACG-3\u2032 D BCT3106 TSST1 NC_002758.2 5\u2032-TCGTCATCAGCTAACTCAAATACATGGA-3\u2032 This work 519..620 5\u2032-TCACTTTGATATGTGGATCTCATTCA-3\u2032 BCT3025 arcC NC_003923 5\u2032-TGAATAGTGT-3\u2032 [13] 27 CT4022 PVL / lukD NC_003923 5\u2032-TGGTCAACAAAGCTATATCAGTAGAAC-3\u2032 This work 1529595. 1531285 5\u2032-TGGATCATCATGTCCAGACATTTCACCTAATG-3\u2032 BCT2156 gmk NC_003923 5\u2032-TCACCTCTAGATC-3\u2032 [13] 1191206. genotyping and characterization of S. aureus and S. lugdunensis was used to distinguish species from each other as well as other coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. the turn-around time of the assay was under 8 hours for the first 12 samples. statistical prevalence estimates were calculated to estimate the proportion of emergency department patients with MRSA colonization. Variables collected on the patient data sheet were entered into a bivariate logistic regression model to generate odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. results Genotype and characterization analyses A total of 200 individuals were recruited and met eligibility criteria for this study. female 92 (46%) 33 (56%) 12 (45%) Race White/Hispanic 38 (19%) 14 (24%) 4 (15%) Black 159 (79.5%) 45 (76%) 23 (85%) Asian, Pacific Islander 2 (1%) 0 0 Hispanic/Spanish origin Yes 3 (1.5%) 1 (2%) 0 No 195 (97.5%) 58 (98%) 27 (100%) Unknown 2 (1%) 0 0 Primary complaint Respiratory 26 (13%) 6 (10.5%) 3 ( one hundred forty of the 200 (70%) were colonized exclusively with CoNS. only one patient showed no evidence of staphylococcal colonization. of 35 patients colonized only with S. aureus, 18 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. 85 patients altogether were colonized with strains that carried the gene encoding high-level mupirocin resistance. the genotypes and presence of virulence factors unique to S. aureus were determined for all patients colonized with S. aureus. one genotype was detected in 12 instances, but 11 patients had unique genotypes. /ESI-MS type and clonal complexes of S. aureus from 59 infected patients 1 Genotype Virulence/Toxin-encoding genes Number of instances Clonal Complex PCR/ESI-MS or ST Type 2 LukD/E PVL Type TSST CC8 1 - - - - - 1 lukD/E+ - - - 6 lukD/E+ - - - the PCR/ESI-MS was not conclusive the best match consistent with ST type is shown. additional molecular resolution was provided by the presence or absence of the lukD/E genes and the gene encoding the TSST-1 toxin. the same primer pair serendipitously detects and differentiates by virtue of base composition. the results for PCR/ESI-MS analysis of nasal swabs from the participants are illustrated in Figure 2. a primer pair targeted to the highly conserved tufB gene amplifies all species within the Staphylococcus genus but not other bacterial genera. spectral peaks from each species are observed in the same spectrum. 59 (29.5%) were colonized with S. aureus; 24 were also co-colonized with CoNS. only one patient showed no evidence of staphylococcal colonization. of 35 patients colonized only with S. aureus, 18 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. of 17 MRSA isolates, 11.8% (2/17) had the mupirocin resistance gene. of 140 CoNS positive patients, 8.6% (12/140) were colonized with strains that had only the mupirocin resistance gene. the isolates clustered into 21 genotypes as depicted in Table 3. the most abundant genotypes were PCR/ESI-MS type 1 (CC8) (19 patients), which correlate with USA300, followed by PCR/ESI-MS type 2 (CC5), which correlate with USA100 (12 patients) lukD/E+ - - 6 lukD/E+ - - TSST+ 1 lukD/E+ PVL+ R - 11 7 lukD/E+ - - - - 12 CC30 3 - - - - 2 - - - - TSST+ 2 CC15 12 lukD/E+ - - - 4 CC45 6 lukD/E a region of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) operon is targeted by a primer pair that hybridizes across the junction of the 3\u2032 end of lukS-PV and the 5\u2032 end of lukF-PV[14]. the same primer pair serendipitously detects and differentiates by virtue of base composition a second leukotoxin-encoding operon that contains the lukE and lukD genes. this study demonstrated a significant prevalence of S. aureus, MRSA and drug-resistant CoNS nasal colonization in a random sample of individuals seeking care from the emergency department at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. the prevalence of MRSA (13.5%) among nasal isolates was somewhat greater than those estimated from other studies that had a similar objective and sample population [28]. the gene for high-level mupirocin resistance can be found on conjugative plasmids that carry multiple resistance determinants for other antimicrobial agents. this resistance has been shown to be transferable to S. aureus[35], which has implications for mupirocin decolonization strategies. the PCR/ESI-MS methodology operates on an automated, high-throughput platform. the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA colonization in a convenience sample of patients seeking care in emergency department was 29.5% and 13.5%, respectively. a substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS. lecular genotypes become associated with increased infection risk.
