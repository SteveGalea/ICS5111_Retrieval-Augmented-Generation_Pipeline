{"summary": "corman et al. sequenced the genome of an African bat virus belonging to the same species as MERS-CoV. phylogenetic analysis indicates that the evolution of MERS-CoV in camelids preceded that in humans. active ADAM17 activates pro-TNF cells that ingest these exosomes. further characterization of this mechanism of HIV transmission may illuminate potential antiviral targets."}
