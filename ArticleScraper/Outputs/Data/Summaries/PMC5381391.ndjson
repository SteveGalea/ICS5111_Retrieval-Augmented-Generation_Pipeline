{"summary": "influenza A and B viruses cause a significant number of annual influenza cases. the divergence of two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B virus has necessitated the inclusion of two influenza B strains into the annual vaccine. both have two glycoproteins on the surface of the viral membrane. NB is an integral membrane protein of 100 amino acids found on the surface of infected cells. it has an 18 amino acid extracellular N terminus, a 22 amino acid transmembrane domain and a 60 amino acid cytoplasmic C terminus. mkumar et al., 2004; Sunstrom et al., 1996; sunstrom et al., 1996; mkumar et al., 2004; Sunstrom et al., 1996; mkumar et al., 2004; Sunstrom et al., 1996; sunstrom et al., 1996; mkumar et al., 2004; sunstrom et al., 1996; sunstrom et the 5NB virus was engineered by the introduction of a premature stop codon after the fifth amino acid of NB coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. both WT and 5NB viruses were rescued and propagated in MDCK cells. WT and mutated (5NB) influenza/B/Florida/04/2006 viruses were used to infect MDCK cells at a high m.o.i. (3). after 24 h, cells were lysed, the proteins separated by SDS-page and transferred by Western blot. mucus inhibition assay measured the ability of the viral NA to cleave abundant sialic acids found in mucus. mucus inhibition assay measured the ability of the viral NA to cleave abundant sialic acids found in mucus. cus was mixed with 100 p.f.u. of each virus before inoculating MDCK cells. the viral NA cleaved sialic acids in mucus enabling infection of the cell monolayer. no significant difference in ability to overcome mucus inhibition was observed between the WT and NB virus. Influenza B/Florida/04/2006 WT or mutant (5NB) viruses were used to infect Calu-3 cells at a low m.o.i. (0.01) at 24 h intervals the viral titre released was assessed by titration on MDCK cells by plaque assay. the 5NB recombinant virus is not attenuated in mice in vivo C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 4.5 105 p.f.u. of either WT or 5NB virus. the weight loss of the mice was monitored daily. BL/6 mice 6\u20138 weeks old were infected with 4.5 105 p.f.u. of WT B/Florida/04/2006 or 5NB virus. at days 2, 3 and 4 post-infection lungs were isolated and homogenized. four donor ferrets were inoculated with a ratio of 104 p.f.u. WT and 5NB virus. all four donors shed infectious virus in their nasal wash over the following 6 or 7 days. the relative proportions of the two virus genotypes in daily nasal washes from a paired donor ferret D4 and infected exposed ferret RD4 assessed by pyrosequencing. only one of the four sentinel animals acquired infection following exposure to the infected donor. cells lacking similar lysates from 5NB mutant virus-infected cells. nucleotide sequence alterations engineered to generate an influenza B virus that lacks NB expression. mutations that lead to NB truncation are double underlined. influenza B/Florida/04/2006 WT or mutant (5NB) virus were serially diluted in MES buffer. 50 l of 0.5 % fresh human RBCs were added and the plate was incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. the two viruses were mixed with human RBCs at equal HA titres. the plates were then incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow agglutination. the effect was more evident at high titres of virus where more NA was present. virus replication kinetics of loss of NB protein on human derived clonal or primary differentiated cell lines were assessed. each cell system was inoculated by each virus type in separate wells at an equal m.o.i. and comparative growth was assessed at set time points by plaque assay. Influenza B/Florida/04/2006 mutant (5NB) viruses were used to infect mucilair HAE cells at an m.o.i. of 0.001 with a mixture of 20 % WT and 80 % 5NB virus. competition assays have increasingly been used to assess small variations in fitness between two influenza viruses not observable by traditional viral growth curves. recombinant virus is not attenuated in mice in vivo C57BL/6 mice. mice were infected with 4.5 105 p.f.u. of either WT or 5NB virus. the weight loss of the mice was monitored daily. lungs were measured by ELISA of the homogenized lungs from (a) there was no difference in interferon levels in the mice infected with the 5NB virus or those infected with the 5NB virus on day 4 (P = 0.005) four ferrets (D1\u2013D4) were inoculated with 104 p.f.u. of an equal mixture WT and truncated NB virus. at 1 day post-infection, four naive ferrets were placed in adjacent cages as respiratory droplet sentinels (RD1\u2013RD4) this infected recipient continued to shed 5NB virus for 4 days from day 6 to day 9 after it was first exposed. NB protein is absolutely conserved across influenza B viruses, a finding that might indicate it is required for effective replication or transmission. NB is dispensable for virus replication in vitro or in vivo in mice or ferret models. ion channel proteins of other viruses appear to stimulate the inflammasome. loss of NB expression had a marginal effect on IL-1 expression in the mouse lung. NB modulated inflammasome activation was masked in the mouse model. study of influenza B viruses found that in the single transmission event we did record, the virus that transmitted was uniquely of the genotype that lacked expression of NB. david frum: we cannot absolutely exclude that the 5NB virus genome was not complemented by wild-type NB protein during the transmission event. s MDCK cell line and the Human lung adenocarcinoma derived cell line (Calu-3) were maintained in DMEM (Gibco Life Technologies) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids and penicillin/ streptomycin. the human airway epithelial cells (Mucilair HAE) were purchased from Epithelix. the cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C at 5 % CO2 and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection. virus was added at an m.o.i. of 0.001. after 1 h, the inoculum was removed and the cell layer washed. all animals were nasal washed daily, while conscious, by instilling 2 ml PBS into the nostrils. all animals were nasal washed daily, while conscious, by instilling 2 ml PBS into the nostrils. the expectorate was collected in 250 ml centrifuge tubes. anti-mouse Dylight 680 and anti-rabbit Dylight 800 conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signalling Technologies) the image has been split to display both proteins in grayscale. an equal amount of lysate was loaded onto two additional lanes and stained with anti-NP. 100 p.f.u. of virus were mixed with either 1 : 70 diluted mucus or virus diluent (PBS+0.35 % BSA), these mixtures were used to infect confluent MDCK cells. after 72 h, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet and the plaques counted. the human airway epithelial cells (Mucilair HAE) were purchased from Epithelix. the virus was rescued by reverse genetics from plasmids containing cDNA synthesized de novo directly from the database sequence. the cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C at 5 % CO2 and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection, virus released from apical surface washed with DMEM. amplification was conducted using random hexamers and superscript III (Invitrogen) mouse infections Female C57BL/6 mice (6\u20138 weeks old), anaesthetized with isoflurane, were intranasally infected with 40 l containing 4.5 105 p.f.u. of WT or 5NB virus or with 40 l of PBS. cytokines in the lungs were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells. in grayscale, an equal amount of lysate was loaded onto two additional lanes and stained with anti-NP. a 50-cycle PCR was performed using the following primers: 5\u2032 GCCAAAAATGAACAATGCTACCT and 3\u2032 CTGATGTGAGAAATAGGGTTAACG. 100 p.f.u. of virus were mixed with either 1 : 70 diluted mucus or virus diluent (PBS+0.35 % BSA) these mixtures were used to infect confluent MDCK cells (in triplicate) at 1 h post-infection, the cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with plaque overlay media."}
