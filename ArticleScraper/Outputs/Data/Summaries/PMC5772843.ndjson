{"summary": "CPV has remained a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in young dogs worldwide. the evolution has given rise to three genetic/antigenic variants, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. in brazil, the CPV-2c variant has already been described, especially in southern Brazil. study has described the prevalence and risk factors for viral exposure in rural dogs around protected areas of Atlantic forest. faecal samples were collected per rectum from apparently healthy dogs and stored at 86 \u00b0C prior to virus isolation. cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 with 95% humidity. after AF-72 cells reached 80% confluence, 1 ml of faecal preparation was added to 4.7 105 cells/ml and the culture supernatant was submitted to three blind passages at 5-day intervals. CPV VR-2016TM (ATCC), Cornell strain, was used as negative controls. CPV amplicons were purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit. Sequences were aligned using the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM) the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbour-Joining method. AF-72 cells were cultured in MEM (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae), 10% foetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae) and non-essential amino acids (100x, Invitrogen\u00ae, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) after 80% confluence, 1 ml of faecal preparation was added to 4.7 105 cells/ AF-72 cells were used as negative controls nd cells inoculated with CPV VR-2016TM, strain Cornell were used as positive controls. other enteric viruses, e.g., canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 (CAV-1, CAV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV), were not detected in the examined samples. all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on amino acid alignments using BLAST analysis. sequences generated for CPV were submitted to GenBank and assigned. an additional 50 samples were related to CPV-2c sequences. the sequences presented the amino acid substitution (Asp-426 to Glu-426) that characterizes the 2c type. the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the use a representative strain which had been characterized as CPV2-c were subjected to full length VP2 amplification and cloning. CPV isolation is feasible when faeces are processed shortly after collection. this procedure allows for enriching viral preparations for several purposes. this includes biological studies of viral replication, drug susceptibility and virus-host interactions.
