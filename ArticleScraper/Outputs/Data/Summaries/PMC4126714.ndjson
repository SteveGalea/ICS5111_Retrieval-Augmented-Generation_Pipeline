{"summary": "interFeron Inducible TransMembrane (IFITM) protein family of viral restriction factors was defined in 2009 in a screen for host-modifying proteins of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. these proteins received little attention until human IFITM3 depletion was found to enhance IAV infection in cell culture assays. over-expression of IFITM3 could inhibit IAV replication in vivo [4], [5]. sequence analyses identified two hydrophobic, putative membrane interacting domains in each of the proteins. additional studies demonstrated palmitoylation of cysteine residues adjacent to the hydrophobic domains, a post-translational modification indicative of membrane proteins. ered myristoylation and prenylation sites at the NTD and CTD of murine IFITM3 can be detected as lipidated with selective chemical reporters alk-12 and alk-FOH. these data suggest that both the NTD and CTD of IFITM3 are intracellular, and that the two hydrophobic sequences enter, but do not span, the lipid bilayer [20]. HA-tagged human (hu) IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3, as well as untransfected A549 cells [23] were cultured in Ham's F-12-GlutaMAX media. untagged IFITM1 and IFITM1-Vstop were cloned into BamH1/Not1 sites. goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680 and goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 (1 mg/ml, Li-COR), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa-647 fluorophore. permeabilised immunofluorescence Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 3% (w/v) formaldehyde (TAAB) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 cell staining was bound to cells on ice for 10 min. cells were then washed four times with PBS/BSA. cells then rinsed in PBS, fixed and permeabilised before incubation. qRT-PCR The endogenous levels of IFITM1, 2, and 3 mRNA in A549 and HEK293T cells were measured by QuantiTect green qRT-PCR (Qiagen) the same approach of applying a threshold was then taken on the red channel to calculate the pixel area, with these pixels being defined as \u201cyellow\u201d. five standards from 107\u2013103 copies were made using plasmids encoding the transcripts of human IFITM1, 2, and 3, using the following formula. the number of copies per cell was estimated by dividing the total number of cells by the total RNA extracted, multiplied by 100. from this the RNA copy number per cell was inferred. antibodies used for protein detection were rabbit anti-IFITM3-NTD 1500, rabbit anti-IFITM1-NTD 11000, mouse anti-HA 11000 and rabbit anti-VDAC 13000. primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-rabbit IRDye 680 or goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 secondary antibodies, both at 110,000 (in 5% milk-TBST) cells were washed 3 with PBS and subject to flow cytometry (LSR-II; BD Bioscience) cells were gated on forward and side scatter and analysed for fluorescence labelling. antibodies were diluted as for immunofluorescence staining. electron microscopy Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) FA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH7.4. ultrathin (70 nm) cryosections were cut at 120\u00b0C and picked up in 11 2% sucrosemethylcellulose. images were obtained using a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope (FEI) X supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) Pen/Strep. untagged IFITM1 and IFITM1-Vstop were purchased from GeneArt. cloned into BamH1/Not1 sites of pcDNA3.1. mM NH4Cl and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) in PBS (PBS/BSA) for 15 min and then permeabilised in PBS/BSA and 0.05% (w/v) saponin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. primary antibodies were diluted in PB and incubated with coverslips for 1 hour (h) unbound antibody was washed off with PB (35 min) rat anti-HA 1100, rabbit anti-IFITM1-NTD 1200, mouse anti-tubulin 1100, goat anti-rat Alexa-488, goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488, goat anti-rabbit Alexa-594 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa-647 all 1500 and WGA-Alexa-647 1200. image analysis To calculate the Pearson's R-value and mander's correlation coefficients, individual cells were segmented and analysed using the the endogenous levels of IFITM1, 2 and 3 mRNA in human cells were measured by QuantiTect SYBR green qRT-PCR (Qiagen) using the primers described in Table 1 and the following thermocycling conditions: RT step - 50\u00b0C for 30 min. PCR steps - 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 94\u00b0C for 15 s; 35 cycles of (94\u00b0C, 15 s; 60\u00b0C, 30 s; 72\u00b0 Western blotting Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. equal amounts of protein were mixed with reducing 3 Laemmli sample buffer. membranes were blocked in TBST with 0.05% [v/v] Tween 20. IFITM1-HA expressing A549 cells were treated with 100 g/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 5\u201330 min at 37\u00b0C. the wells were rinsed with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in PBS. untreated control cells, as well as cells treated with inactivated trypsin, were also collected. cells were detached with 5 mM EDTA and re-plated into 635 mm well plates. after 24 h, cells were labelled with 1 mg/ml EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. whole cell lysate was added to a 25 l NeutrAvidin agarose bead pellet. sections were labelled with primary antibody (mouse anti-HA 1400), followed by rabbit anti-mouse intermediate antibody (DAKO) and protein A gold. images were obtained using a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope (FEI) intact IFITM1-HA cells show positive cell surface HA staining. a minority (1%) show low-level positive staining. cells were also stained in the absence of detergent. in some cells IFITM3-HA is either mis-sorted and/or is expressed at the cell surface where the HA epitope is accessible. we used two commercially available antibodies against the hu IFITM1 and IFITM3 NTDs. the IFITM1 NTD antibody was raised against a peptide encoding the first 35 amino acids of hu IFITM1. two commercially available antibodies targeting either the IFITM1-NTD or the IFITM3-NTD were screened by western blot to assess specificity using HA-tagged IFITM1-3 (M1, M2 and M3) cell lines along with control A549 cells. proteins were also identified using the HA epitope. distributions agree with those seen using anti-HA antibodies. inaccessibility of the IFITM1-NTD to labelling indicates the domain is on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. IFITM1-HA cells were incubated with trypsin for up to 30 min at 37\u00b0C. trypsin predicted to cleave at two positions close to the C-terminus of hu IFITM1. untreated cells with anti-IFITM1-NTD indicated two IFITM1 bands. the higher molecular weight band was rapidly lost, with a concomitant increase in the intensity of the lower band. this suggests that the lower band is a cleavage product that has lost the HA-tag. untagged, wild type IFITM1 or IFITM1-Vstop expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. after two days the cells were labelled with cell impermeable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. western blots probed with anti-IFITM1-NTD for whole cell lysates. protein eluted from the NeutrAvidin beads remained unbound. IFITM1 labelled by biotin is readily detected compared to unlabelled samples. sections of IFITM1-HA cells were immuno-gold labelled for the HA-tag. labelling was seen predominantly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 7A and B) labelling was also seen in the Golgi apparatus and in multi-vesicular bodies. live cells were cultured in medium containing anti-HA antibody for 3 h. control untransfected A549 cells showed no labelling. most IFITM2-HA and IFITM3-HA cells showed little labelling. control A549 cells show no specific staining. majority of cells are not labelled. a minority of cells show punctate labelling indicative of IFITM-mediated internalisation of anti-HA antibodies. the overlap was seen across multiple images as demonstrated by Mander's correlation coefficients M1 and M2. around 70% (1.8%) of pixels were detectable as yellow (Table S1). a lower level of co-localisation was seen on IFITM3-HA expressing cells. Pearson's R-value represents the correlation in intensity between the red (anti-IFITM3-NTD) and green (HA) channels. mander's correlation coefficients represent the overlap of red, in pixels that are green, and the overlap of green, in pixels that are red. Error given is of the standard deviation. human IFITM1 and IFITM3 are exposed to the endosomal/lysosomal system. the human IFITM1 C-terminal domain resides extracellularly. cells were permeabilised and labelled with antibodies. nuclei were labelled with Hoechst. all images are maximum projections of 0.25 m optical sections. scale bar represents 15 m. cells were also stained in the absence of detergent. the IFITM1 antibody (anti-IFITM1-NTD) was raised against a peptide encoding the first 35 amino acids of hu IFITM1 and IFITM3 respectively. this domain has 69% and 75% amino acid identity with hu IFITM2 and IFITM3, respectively. tagged IFITM1-3 (M1, M2 and M3) cell lines along with control A549 cells. proteins were also identified using the HA epitope. IFITM1-HA, IFITM2-HA and IFITM3-HA show distinct distributions in permeabilised cells. no specific staining was seen on intact cells labelled with anti-IFITM1-NTD antibody. trypsin predicted to cleave at two positions close to the C-terminus of hu IFITM1. the trypsin was inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor. the cells were lysed and the cellular proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. 8% of the HA-tagged protein was not digested by trypsin. a small pool of IFITM1-HA protein was inaccessible to the protease. untreated cells showed a high level of staining that was lost upon treatment with trypsin. untagged, wild type IFITM1 or IFITM1-Vstop expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. after two days the cells were labelled with cell impermeable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin prior to incubation with NeutrAvidin agarose beads. cells were precipitated using NeutrAvidin beads and analysed by western blot. the detection of IFITM1 in the biotin labelled, but unbound, fraction suggested that either the precipitation is not efficient or only a proportion of IFITM1 has a CTD that is accessible to cell surface labelling. hu IFITM1 is located in the plasma membrane, making it highly amenable to the topological analysis described above. hu IFITM2-HA and IFITM3-HA are primarily intracellular and less accessible to these investigative methods. IFITM1-HA cells acted as a positive control and showed strong cell surface labelling. 25% of IFITM3-HA cells showed intracellular, punctate labelling. 10% of IFITM2-HA cells showed intracellular, punctate labelling. the majority of cells are not labelled, however in both cases a minority of cells do show punctate labelling indicative of IFITM-mediated internalisation of anti-HA antibodies. previous results suggest that IFITM2 and 3 are localised to endosomes. mander's correlation coefficients, M1 and M2, represent the overlap of red, in pixels that are green, and the overlap of green, in pixels that are red, respectively. mander's correlation coefficients, M1 and M2, represent the overlap of red, in pixels that are green and the overlap of green, respectively. image analysis of anti-IFITM3-NTD antibody and anti-HA antibody co-labelling. red represents anti-IFITM3 labelling, green represents anti-HA labelling and yellow represents overlap of the two stains. hu IFITM1, which localises primarily to the plasma membrane, has a topology with the NTD located in the cytoplasm and the CTD in the extracellular space. a large proportion of untagged IFITM1 could be biotin labelled and absorbed to NeutrAvidin beads, but some protein remained in the supernatant. hu IFITM2 and 3 are likely to have the same topology, suggesting this may be a common feature of human interferon-induced IFITM proteins, and mu IFITM3. if these tags are at the C-terminus they will reside in extracellular and lumenal spaces where they may be exposed to proteolytic conditions. stably expressing IFITM1 show two bands when using the anti-IFITM1-NTD antibody. the higher molecular weight band is the HA-tagged form of the protein. the lower weight band is a cleaved form of the protein that has lost the HA-tag. hu IFITM proteins have an intracellular NTD and CIL domain. extracellular CTD may allow IFITM proteins to interact with key membrane components that are inaccessible on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. IFITM-HA cell lines were co-labelled with anti-HA antibody. images are of a single optical section through the middle surface of the cells. a minority (1%) of the cells show some plasma membrane labelling. the black line represents control A549 cells expressing no HA constructs. the green line represents untreated IFITM1-HA cells. the blue and red lines represent 10 and 30 mins of trypsin treatment."}
