{"summary": "Background We have compared 38 isolates of the complete genome. the main goal was to analyze and compare nucleotide sequences. the comparison is based on genome polymorphism such as insertions or deletions. a comparative study of SARS-CoV isolates provides essential information for genome polymorphism, indication of strain differences and variants evolution. the genome of SARS-CoV consists of a single positive RNA strand approximately 30 Kb in length. the first two overlapping ORFs at the 5' end encompass two-thirds of the genome. list of the complete genome isolates investigated. included are isolates' labels, IDs, accession numbers, length in nucleotides, dates of revisions considered and countries and sources of isolates.

Sin2500 Ay283794.1 29711 12-AUG-2003 the length of isolates (insertions and deletions) and the presence of SNPs, we classified them into three main groups. we classified them into three main groups with subgroups: \"regular\" isolates with no insertions or deletions. isolates with \"long insertions\" and isolates with \"many individual\" insertions and deletions. Isolates Frankfurt 1 and FRA are identical up to the poly-\"a\" of length 13 present at the 3' end of FRA (Figure 1). a significant number of isolates have the same length (29727 bases), the same beginning and ending subsequences (that seem to be exact starts and ends of the complete SARS-CoV genome up to the poly-\"a\" at the 3' end) isolates have significant length insertions (29 nucleotides) inside the sequence. a significant number of individual insertions have been identified in ZJ01 and ZMY 1 isolates. for TWH as the referent isolate, this number varies from 1 to 80 SNPs. the positions of multiple SNPs of these three isolates are highly different from all the others and are represented in Figure 4. these results coincide with those published in Marra et al's paper [4] for Urbani and Tor2 isolates. positions with two or more SNPs in group B have not been counted. Isolates from group B have not been counted, since positions of SNPs are highly different from all the others. IDs of annotated isolates are in grey boxes. properties (III, IV) may result in three groups (Figure 2): \"regular isolates\" whose nucleotide structure is close to the referent group. SNPs properties (1\u20133) may divide A group into A1.

Isolates may be classified into three groups based on the number of SNPs with TWH. the tree is based on qualitative analysis of sequence variation of 36 isolates. the results obtained also differ from Hsueh et al. [12] regarding positions with two or more SNPs in A and C groups with amino acid changes. positions are represented on the relative scale of all the isolates and on the TWH scale. positions of annotated isolates causing amino acid changes are in grey boxes. only SNPs in B group isolates, regarding TWH, have been counted. 2677, Sin2748, Taiwan TC1, Taiwan TC2, Taiwan TC3, WHU, Frankfurt1, FRA, HKU, CUHK-W1, GZ50 and BJ01-BJ04 (Figure 5, 6a) CUHK-W1, GZ50 and BJ01-BJ04 (Figure 6a and the additional file 2) B.

ZMY 1 (Figure 7b and the additional file 5) figure 8 represents the overall density distribution of SNPs, insertions and deletions for all the 36 isolates along with the gene map for TWH. the proposed grouping of 36 isolates, based on different criteria, still conserves the previous classification T-T-T-T / C-G-C-C. Phylogenetic tree of 36 complete genome isolates. distances represent degree of sequence variation. largest distance is associated with ZMY 1, followed by ZJ01 isolate (groups C1, C2). phylogenetic analysis The SARS-CoV isolates have been multialigned using the CLUSTALW program [10] as the very first step in obtaining a phylogenetic tree. the aligned sequences have been submitted to CLUSTALW for bootstrapping and phylogenetic tree production. out of 312 SNPs in total, only two are in IGRs. all the isolates may be grouped according to sequence polymorphism into three groups. the fully sequenced isolate TWH has been chosen as the referent isolate, since its average number of SNPs was the lowest as compared to all other isolates. step 1 has been carried out by a function performing similarity analysis of subsequences of a given length (e.g., 100 bps), and identification of SNPs in structurally identical parts. dataset We investigated the complete genomes of 38 SARS-CoV isolates. a CLUSTALW [10] multialigned output has been generated. a bootstrapped phylogenetic tree has been produced and drawn using the PhyloDraw program [15] step 2 has been carried out by comparing structurally identical parts (of the same length) of pairs of isolates. the starting and ending positions of those parts have been taken from the file InsDelx-y (for comparison of x and y), produced in step 1. the exact positions on all four scales (TWH, GD01, SZ3 and SZ16) are given. ID of the only annotated isolate (GD01) is in grey box. the project was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Republic of Serbia."}
