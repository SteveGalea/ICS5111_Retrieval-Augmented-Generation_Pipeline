{"summary": "the number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is increasing. traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events. in urban informal settlements, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces could be used as a surveillance surrogate. infectious diseases, inadequate health care access, lower socioeconomic status and malnutrition are generally higher in low and middle income settings. however, conducting infectious disease surveillance among urban settlement dwellers using conventional disease surveillance methods can be challenging and costly due to the dense settlements. novel local and global surveillance systems for detection and response in such settings are needed to improve containment and control of infectious diseases. study setting and collection of surveillance data Kibera is one of the largest informal settlements in East Africa. the area covers approximately 0.4 km2 and is densely populated (70,000 persons/ km2) with high burden of infectious diseases. patients with acute febrile illness (AFI) defined as measured axillary temperature 38.0\u00b0C, respiratory syndrome defined as cough or difficult breathing. participants can freely seek care at other private and public health care facilities, chemists/pharmacies, drug shops as well as traditional healers. the pellet was tested for bacterial and parasitic DNA. the supernatant was extracted for DNA and RNA viruses. the samples were sequenced using the Nucleospin RNA XS kit. viral read count per million (VRPM) was calculated by normalizing read count for each specific virus relative to the total viral read count for each sample. cases where the observed weekly number of reads for specific bacteria, viruses or AMR genes were above the upper limit were defined as an \u201cupsurge\u201d of a sudden occurrence. each AMR feature was transformed to Z-scores to enable easy between-sample comparison within a single AMR feature. ethics This study was conducted in accordance with the Danish Act on scientific ethical treatment of health research. there are ten geographic units referred to as clusters in the study area (Fig 1) [15]. Fig 1. Geographical overview and location and description of the residence clusters 9 and 10 of the urban slum city. a total of 42 samples were collected at KEMRI laboratory in the study area. the samples were stored with no presentation at -80 C\u00b0. all samples arrived still frozen to the Technical University in Denmark. mapper v2.2 (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MGmapper/) mapped reads from each metagenomic sample. read abundance data were visualized using ggplot2 [25] and heatmap plotting systems for R. the number of S. Typhi reads at both clusters 9 and 10 in week 28 were removed from the calculation due to the spiked samples. the relative abundance of the top 20 most abundant bacterial species were determined independent of their known relevance to infectious diseases. raw sequence data have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive under study accession no.: PRJEB13833. a minimum Phred quality score of 30 to trim low-quality reads before adaptor removal. an upper limit was calculated as the mean read abundance plus 1.96 times the standard deviation. cases where the observed weekly number of reads for specific bacteria, viruses or AMR genes were above the upper limit were excluded from the recalculation of the average and the upper limit. the relative abundance of the top 20 most abundant bacterial species were determined independent of their known relevance to infectious diseases. the highest number of clinic diarrhea cases occurred in week 25 (n = 26), clinic fever cases in week 31 (n = 37), and all-cause clinic visits in week 26 (n = 509). a Shigella flexneri infection was detected the 17th of August 2014 (week 34). a high read abundance of Shigella spp. was observed in cluster 10 on Wednesday in week 26 with all four species exceeding the calculated upper limit. bacterial read abundance of Shigella spp. was also observed in cluster 9 on Wednesday in week 26 with all four species exceeding the calculated upper limit. a sudden and considerable increase in the relative abundances of a number of AMR genes and classes was observed on Wednesday of week 27 in cluster 10. however, no corresponding increase in any of the bacterial pathogens was observed at the same time point. strovirus MLB3, and norovirus all had their highest reads counts in weeks 25, 26, 30, and 31, respectively. abundance of selected parasitic pathogens Giardia spp., Plasmodium spp., Ascaris spp., and Blastocystis spp. were the most abundant parasites throughout the study period. only one significant increase in read abundances exceeding the upper limit was observed with Blastocystis spp. this coincided with other bacterial genera of higher abundances in the same week such as shewanella spp., salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp. and Flavobacterium spp. one Shigella flexneri infection was detected the 17th of August 2014 (week 34). bacterial read abundance of Shigella spp. was observed in cluster 10 on Wednesday in week 26 with all four species exceeding the calculated upper limit. significantly higher read abundances to Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia enterocolitica exceeded the upper limit. the spiked sensitivity test with S. Typhi led to a large change in the relative abundance of S. enterica. the presence of S. Typhi was later confirmed with the identification of 238.439 unique reads to S. Typhi str. P-stx-12. data were mean-standardized (Z-scores) within each drug class. the spiked S. Typhi had several resistance genes, leading to high relative abundances of aminoglycoside (strA, strB), sulphonamide (sul1, sul2, sul3), trimethoprim (dfrA), beta-lactam (blaTEM, and phenicol (catA) resistance genes in the samples from Monday of week 28. Cryptosporidium spp. had significantly higher read abundances in weeks 29 and 30 as well as week 32 in cluster 9. only one significant increase in read abundances exceeding the upper limit was observed with Blastocystis spp. on the Monday of week 27. a large variation in bacterial read abundances was observed over time with several peaks above the calculated upper limit. bacterial read abundance of Shigella spp. was observed in cluster 10 on Wednesday in week 26 with all four species exceeding the calculated upper limit. the spiked sensitivity test with S. Typhi led to a large change in the relative abundance of S. enterica (from 0.04% to 86% of all sequencing reads within seven days) the presence of S. Typhi was later confirmed with the identification of 238.439 unique reads to S. Typhi str. P-stx-12 (CP003278.1) the spiked S. Typhi had several resistance genes, leading to high relative abundances of aminoglycoside (strA, strB), sulphonamide (sul1, sul2, sul3), trimethoprim (dfrA), beta-lactam (blaTEM, and phenicol (catA) resistance genes. bacteriophages of the families Virgaviridae and Podoviridae were also found consistently. higher read abundances in weeks 29 and 30 as well as week 32 in cluster 9 and on the Wednesday of week 30 and week 32 in cluster 10. only one significant increase in read abundances exceeding the upper limit was observed with Blastocystis spp. on the Monday of week 27. metagenomic approach provides high resolution of microorganisms compared with traditional disease surveillance. it could lead to new applications involving strategic genomics-based testing of environmental specimens in disease hot spots replacing the currently limited conventional surveillance. rotavirus A has been shown to be the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in children in Kenya. a number of human viral pathogens were observed during the study period. rotavirus A has been shown to be responsible for an estimated 4,000 deaths among children 5 years of age in 2013. no association with gastroenteritis was found in the study of Meyer et al. (29), but it is unclear to what extent Astrovirus MLB3 contributed to the diarrheal cases detected at the clinic. a variety of viral pathogens were observed in the virome of the urban sewage. metagenomics sewage surveillance was limited in the number of reported illnesses, diarrhea, AFI, subjective fever and clinic visits at the household level. it is interesting that several detected bacterial and viral pathogens in the metagenomics analysis coincide with increased numbers of diarrheal cases despite the few isolated bacteria from the clinic. for each sample, the mapped reads were randomly subsampled to varying levels (x-axis) to determine the unique number of genes or species hit (y-axis) each line thus shows the trajectory for a single sample with a horizontal plateau indicating saturation.
