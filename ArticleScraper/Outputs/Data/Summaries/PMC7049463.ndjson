{"summary": "most vector-borne diseases are treated as a part of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) during 2014, the historical large-scale dengue fever caused an extensive international epidemic in southern china and other regions in Southeastern Asia. the Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in the Pacific area in 2008 (Duffy et al., 2009; Besnard et al., 2014; Cauchemez et al., 2016), then in south America since 2015. malaria epidemics occur from time to time in many under-developed places in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. increasing frequency of such outbreaks over the past decades urges disease control and prevention studies. the YF outbreak included 941 reported cases with 73 deaths in Luanda, angola from December 2015 to June 2016. the local authority had conducted large-scale mass vaccination campaign since February 2016. the vaccine program immunised approximated 55% of the local population within 6 months since started. fever, yellow fever, zika fever, malaria, etc., are transmitted from vector to host as well as from host to vector. the transmission mechanism can be explained by vector-host epidemic models. the model parameters are summarised in Table 1, and all parameters are assumed non-negative. the Sh, Ih, Rh represent the numbers of susceptible, infected and removed host population. the black arrows represent disease transmission paths. we have N h = S h t + I h t + R h t = constant. N v t = S v t + I v t + R v t = constant. model (2) takes a simple form, but is applicable to model transmission dynamics of most vector-borne diseases. model system in Zhao et al. (2018b), Gao et al. (2016) and Tang et al. (2016). entry of ith row and jth column of matrix F is denoted by Fi,j, and F i, j = F i x j where F i is the ith equation of F and xj is the jth variable of the vector of infected classes. the vector F is the transmission rates\u2019 vector quantity, i.e., the changing rates from infected to non-infected classes. the square root represents the geometric mean that takes the average number of secondary host (or vector) infections produced by a single infected host. effective reproduction number During an epidemic, the susceptible individuals (Sh or Sv) are gradually consumed, become infected and finally removed from the disease transmission cycle. the next generation matrix, G, is given by G = F V 1 = 0 v h S h v h v S v N h 0 h + h 1 0 0 v + v 1 = 0 S h N h v + v m S v h v h v + v m S v h v + v m S v h v + v m S the relationship between R 0 and R eff in Eq. (5) holds whenever the transmission path of the vector-borne pathogens is from a host to a host via a vector. the relationship between R 0 and R eff in Eq. (5) holds whenever the transmission path of the vector-borne pathogens is from a host to a host via a vector. the first transmission wave is highlighted in light purple by shifting one YF\u2019s serial interval (SI), averagely 23 days Wu et al. (2016). the shedding area represent the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reproduction number, R 0 t and R eff t, reconstruction approach proposed in Zhao et al. (2018b) is concisely introduced in \u2018Reconstruction of the Reproduction Numbers from Compartmental Model\u2019. the instantaneous (effective) reproduction number, R t or R t estimation is described in details in \u2018Instantaneously Reproduction Number Estimation by Renewable Equation\u2019. the reconstructed R 0 t is in the form of an exponential cubic spline function varying over the YF epidemic period. the shape of the cubic spline function are controlled by the number of nodes and value of each node. the overall log-likelihood value can be calculated by summing up to all log-probabilities of all is during the entire YF epidemic period. therefore, the reconstructed R 0 t can be estimated by finding the number of nodes and values of nodes (of the cubic spline function) with the \u201cbest fitting performance\u201d. the time-varying effective reproduction number is estimated from the renewal equation in Eq. (7). the time-varying R t is estimated from the renewable equation in Eq. (7). the convolution term 0 w k x t k d k is the measurement of the total infectiousness at time t. similar methods were also implemented in Zhao et al. (2019c), Zhao et al. (2019d), Cowling et al. (2019d), and Ferguson et al. (2016). the susceptible host becomes infected by the \u201ccontact\u201d with infectious vectors, eventually recovers, eventually recovers. a similar path is also modelled in the vectors\u2019 population. square compartments represent the host classes (or compartments), and circular compartments represent the vector classes. the red compartments represent infected classes. Table 1. Summary table of the parameters in model (2). the disease-caused vector mortality is neglected in this modelling study. the inclusion of v = 0, thus Rv = 0, can resolve this conflict straightforwardly. most of the pathogens of the vector-borne diseases merely transmit via two paths, host-to-vector and vector-to-host. van den Driessche & Watmough (2002), diekmann, Heesterbeek & Roberts (2009) and Diekmann, Heesterbeek & Metz (1990), a systematic procedure to calculate the R 0 by solving the dominant eigenvalue, i.e., the eigenvalue with the largest real part, of the next generation matrix, G, at the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and Iv are the infected classes, which should be included in the vectors ( F and V ) of infected classes. then, we have F = v h S h N h I v h v S v I h, and V = h + h I h v + v. the next generation matrix, G, is given as follows. the square root represents the geometric mean that takes the average number of secondary host (or vector) infections produced by a single infected vector. effective reproduction number, R eff, is the expected number of secondary cases produced by one typical infection joining in a population during its infectious period. we further define the susceptibilities of hosts ( S h ) and vectors ( S v ) by S h = S h N h, and S v = S v N v. in the epidemic model (2), we have Sh, Ih, Rh Nh, and Sv, Iv, Rv Nv. Henceforth, the effective reproduction number is in Eq. (5). the YF cases time series in Luanda and the local vaccination coverage were obtained from the situation reports released by the african health observatory (WHO, 2017) both probable and confirmed cases were grouped together, and were considered as the \u201cYF cases\u201d for further analyses. the instantaneous reproduction number, R t, is calculated by the serial interval (SI) approach. we compare the calculations of the R eff s by using Eq. (1) or Eq. (5) to the R eff. the focus of this part is to compare the two relationships between R 0 and R eff described in Eqs. (1) and (5). the reconstructed R 0 t is in the form of an exponential cubic spline function varying over the YF epidemic period, i.e., from December 2015 to June 2016. the compartmental model simulated number of cases time series as the theoretical case numbers, denoted by Zi for the ith week in the epidemic period. we assume the observation noise follows an over-dispersed Poisson distribution. the rate of the Poisson process is considered to be a Gamma random variable. this leads to a NB process (Lin et al., 2018). the simulation outcomes can be found in Fig. 3 of Zhao et al. (2018b) we estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the reconstructed R 0 t. using the local YF vaccination coverage, the data were publicly available via the African Health Observatory (WHO, 2017) and adopted in Zhao et al. (2018b) this approach was extended by Forsberg White & Pagano (2008), Katriel et al. (2011), Ali, Kadi & Ferguson (2013), Fraser (2007), Cori et al. (2013) and Wallinga & Lipsitch (2006). we also implemented to study several vector-borne diseases. the reconstructed R 0 t is in the form of an exponential cubic spline function. the shape of the cubic spline function are controlled by the number of nodes and value of each node. the compartmental model simulated number of cases time series is estimated based on the maximum likelihood framework. the probability framework is described in Eq. (6). the term is an over-dispersion parameter of the NB process. the overall log-likelihood value can be calculated by summing up to all log-probabilities. the approximation is difference between the pre-existed population susceptibility, calculated by 1 minus the pre-existed YF-protection rate, and the time-varying local vaccination coverage. we calculated two different forms of the time-varying effective reproduction number by using the Eqs. (1) and (5) with S v = 1 fixed. the time-varying R t is estimated from the renewal equation in Eq. (7). the convolution term 0 w k x t k d k is the measurement of the total infectiousness at time t. both percentage reductions in S h and R 0 ranged from 0 to 1. the range of R 0 from 2 to 10 covers most of the vector-borne diseases\u2019 basic reproduction numbers during the initial outbreak. we found two peaks in the reconstructed R 0 t, of which the highest value was found to be 7.1 during the first wave that peaked in January. the second peak of R 0 t occurred in the April of 2016 with the local maximum value of 5.6. the trajectory of the R eff t from Eq. (5) against the percentage reductions in S h and R 0 of the YF epidemic in Luanda, angola from 2015 to 2016. for the second transmission waves, it \u201cbroke\u201d the R eff = 1 boundary and thus associated with the second (minor) YF epidemic wave in may of 2016. the R eff from Eq. (5) were compared with the R eff of the classic airborne infectious disease in Eq. (1) as well as the estimation by the SI approach in Eq. (7). we used this epidemic as an example to compare the R eff calculation and estimation. the reduction in S h is (relatively) less effective in reducing R eff during the initial stage, i.e., from 0% onwards. this finding suggests that directly reducing R 0, via, e.g., vector elimination, avoiding exposure to vectors, improving treatment, etc., could be a more efficient option to control the vector-borne diseases. Wu et al. (2016) estimated that the YF basic reproduction number of R 0 = 8. 3 (95% CI [6.8\u20139.7]) with mean SI of 23 days. we adopted the mean SI of 23 days as in Wu et al. (2016). to derive the R eff in Eq. (5), we used the next generation matrix approach in \u2018Effective Reproduction Number\u2019 and considered the transition \u201cfrom host to vector to host\u201d as two generations. in this case, the effective reproduction number is R eff = R 0 S h S v. the relationship holds on the condition that the transmission paths remain from-host-to-vector and from-vector-to-host. however, since the sexual transmission merely contributes very minor infections, it can be ignored in scale, and thus R eff R 0 S h S v.
