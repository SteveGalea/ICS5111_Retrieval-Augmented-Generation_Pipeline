{"summary": "the steps of the Virochip assay include (1) nucleic acid extraction from clinical samples, (2) reverse transcription of extracted RNA and 2nd-strand cDNA synthesis, (3) PCR amplification of randomly primed cDNA. the protocol shown below will demonstrate the use of the Virochip assay on a nasal swab sample from a child with an influenza-like illness. 5 L of a master mix consisting of 2 L 5X RT buffer, 1 L 12.5 mM dNTP, 1 L water, 0.5 L 0.1M DTT, and 0.5 L SSIII RT (Invitrogen) heat to 94\u00b0C x 2 min (to abort the reverse transcriptase reaction), cool to 10\u00b0C, pulse centrifuge. add 5 L Sequenase mix consisting of 1 L 5X Sequenas a smear from approximately 200 - 1000 bp should be visualized. add 5 uL of Rd B sample to 45 uL of a master mix. use 1.5 L to check cDNA concentration and the amount of dye incorporated on a nanodrop spectrophotometer. Virochip array (University of California, San Francisco / Agilent) preheat buffer 2 (Agilent) to 37\u00b0C. preheat buffer 2 (Agilent) to 37\u00b0C, speed setting at 10 rpm. samples can be spiked with measured quantities of nucleic acid from a known virus to serve as a positive control for the assay. microarrays are scanned at 2 m resolution and analyzed using a variety of computational tools, including E-Predict. extract the sample using the Turbo DNAse kit (Ambion) per the manufacturer's instructions. Add 1 uL 40 pmol / L Primer A to 4 uL extracted RNA. heat to 65\u00b0C for 5 min in a thermocycler and let cool at room temp x 5 min. uL of Rd A sample to 45 uL of a master mix consisting of 5 uL 10X PCR buffer, 1 L 12.5 mM dNTP, 1 L 100 pmol / L primer B, 1 L KlenTaq LA (Sigma) and 37 uL water. check the Rd B sample on a 1.5% agarose electrophoresis gel. uL Cy5 (GE Healthcare) to the Rd C sample. incubate x 1 hour in the dark. use 1.5 L to check cDNA concentration and amount of dye incorporated on a nanodrop spectrophotometer. ze Virochip microarrays by visual inspection, cluster analysis, or the automated Virochip analysis program, E-Predict11. if a virus is present it should be readily identified by visual inspection, cluster analysis, and / or E-Predict. samples can be spiked with measured quantities of nucleic acid from a known virus to serve as a positive control. the Virochip protocol is complex and requires a meticulous and skilled research technician. the Virochip protocol can be easily modified to accommodate analysis of diseased tissues by using a tissue extraction method."}
