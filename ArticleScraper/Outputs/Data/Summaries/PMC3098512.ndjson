{"summary": "adaptation to the host is poor despite this selection. human genes code Ile mostly by AUC and least by AUC. the poor codon adaptation of HIV-1 reduces translation efficiency. HIV-1 is known to package host tRNAs, specifically tRNALys and tRNAIle. tRNALys is used by HIV-1 as a primer to initiate reverse transcription. a recent tRNA microarray study demonstrated that HIV-1 packages a variety of tRNAs in addition to tRNALys and tRNAIle. specific tRNA species were packaged within each codon family. tRNAIle/UAU was highly packaged by HIV-1 as compared with tRNAIle/IAU. the tRNA pool for translating HIV-1 genes may be selectively altered to favor the translation of HIV-1 genes. tRNAs packaged in HIV-1 virions and in Gag viral-like particles were quantified by microarray. tRNA content of HEK293T cells was also measured. cellular tRNAs are the source of tRNAs packaged into HIV-1. a ribosomal slippage at the slippery sequence UUUUUUA starts at position 1631 in the HXB2 reference genome. the two polyproteins therefore share the N-terminal portion but differ in the C-terminal portion. we defined two indices for viral codon usage and tRNA packaging. the simian immunodeficiency virus genome (SIV, M58410) was downloaded from NCBI. early genes are rex and tax, and late genes are gag, pol, vif, vpx, and env. RSCU measures the degree of bias in codon usage for each codon family. the codon usage of HIV-1 genes correlated poorly with that of host genes. RSCU of HIV-1 compared with RSCU of highly expressed human genes. seven pairs of Icodon and ItRNA values for codon families were computed (table 1). these seven families were the only ones that used probes on the tRNA microarray that distinguished A-ending from non\u2013A-ending codons. only families for which information on all tRNAs was available were studied. tRNAGagVLP: relative tRNA abundance of GagVLP versus human HEK293T cells. itRNA and Icodon were ranked positively correlated with r = 0.5780 and P = 0.0304. removal of Lys from the analysis resulted in an increased correlation between the ranked Icodon and ItRNA to 0.6853 (P = 0.0139) tRNALys enrichment is for the purpose of reverse transcription and may have little to do with codon\u2013anticodon adaptation. we therefore investigated whether there were differences in the codon usage between HIV-1 early and late genes. the early genes are expected to have codon adaptation similar to that of highly expressed human genes because they are expected to share the same tRNA pool for translation. HTLV-1 b) compared with RSCU of highly expressed human genes. early (pink) and late (dark blue) genes shown with different colors. the positive correlation in RSCU between HTLV-1 and human genes is highly significant. HTLV-1 relies for the most part on the host polymerase to replicate through clonal expansion of infected cells rather than undergoing iterative replication cycles like HIV-1. HTLV-1 relies for the most part on the host polymerase to replicate through clonal expansion of infected cells. the substitution rate of HTLV-1 is consequently lower. RSCU measures the degree of bias in codon usage for each codon family. the codon usage of HIV-1 genes correlated poorly with that of host genes. RSCU of HIV-1 compared with RSCU of highly expressed human genes. seven pairs of Icodon and ItRNA values for codon families were computed (table 1). these seven families were the only ones that used probes on the tRNA microarray that distinguished A-ending from non-A-ending codons. tRNALys is known to be selectively packaged for the purpose of reverse transcription and its packaging should not be related to HIV-1 translation. the removal of Lys from the analysis resulted in an increased correlation between the ranked Icodon and ItRNA to 0.6853 (P = 0.0139) we may view the regression line for the A-ending codons as being pushed to the right by the A-biased mutation. correlation lines are plotted with R2 values to indicate the goodness of fit. tRNALys enrichment may have little to do with codon\u2013anticodon adaptation. RSCU of HIV-1 a) and HTLV-1 b) compared with RSCU of highly expressed human genes. early (pink) and late (dark blue) genes shown with different colors. early (pink) and late (dark blue) genes shown with different colors. HTLV-1 relies for the most part on the host polymerase to replicate through clonal expansion of infected cells. the substitution rate of HTLV-1 is consequently lower, about 5.2 10-6 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al. 2004); that of HIV-1 is around 2.5 10-3 substitutions/site/year (Hanada et al. 2004). tRNAs that read A-ending codons are rare in human cells. it would be tempting to hypothesize that rare tRNAs are actively packaged and delivered into a newly infected cells to alter the tRNA pool. tRNA pool when HIV-1 late genes are translated is enriched with tRNAs decoding A-ending codons common in HIV-1 late genes. modifying HIV-1 codon usage according to the codon usage of highly expressed host genes can substantially increase the production of viral proteins of HIV-1 late genes. however, these studies were conducted with the normal tRNA pool in the host cell and did not take into consideration the possible alteration of the host tRNA pool during the translation of HIV-1 late genes. mutation bias is not only reflected in the third codon position but also in the first and second codon positions. if A-biased mutation is stronger in the late genes, then A12 should be higher in the late genes than in the early genes. translation of HIV-1 proteins is not inhibited by the repression of host proteins. a cap-independent internal ribosome entry site-mediated mechanism would affect the tRNA pool. the UPR response is induced in response to the accumulation of highly expressed viral proteins, particularly the structural glycoproteins. the HIV-1 late genes are translated in the second tRNA pool. the selection against using A-ending codons is weaker. understanding the translation of HIV-1 genes has potential biomedical implications."}
