{"summary": "new method for the discovery of unknown viruses based on the cDNA - random amplified polymorphic DNA (cDNA-RAPD) technique. getah virus, belonging to the family togaviridae in the genus Alphavirus, is a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus. GETV is a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus belonging to the SFV complex in the genus Alphavirus[1]. GETV has been shown to cause illnesses in humans and livestock animals. current molecular biological techniques are troublesome since some viruses do not replicate in vitro but may cause a cytopathic effect. virus nsP3, capsid protein genes, and 3\u2019-UTR sequences were cloned, sequenced, and compared. the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus YN08 isolate is more closely related to Hebei HB0234 strain than the YN0540 strain, and genetically distant to the MM2021 Malaysia primitive strain. Specimens were analyzed using ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (SV5 and SV40) Lane M, DNA molecular weight markers (DL2000,TOKARA); negative controls. VIDISCR PCR products for YN08 amplified with different primers.

VIDISCR begins with a treatment to selectively enrich for viral nucleic acid. to remove interferences from the cell genomes DNA and cellular RNA, a centrifugation step is used to remove residual cells and mitochondrial DNA. the viral nucleic acids of SV40 and SV5 were detected from cell culture. PCR product of cultured YN08 amplified with different primers. RAPD Primers used for VIDISCR. the supernatant of the suckling mouse brain tissue infected with YN08 was analyzed by VIDISCR. the 21 VIDISCR fragments were cloned and sequenced from the 11 selective PCR assays. the YN08 isolate nsP3 nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 98.00 to 99.31%, while amino acid sequence identity ranged from 98.89 to 99.44%. the capsid protein gene nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 97.56 to 99.31%, while amino acid sequence identity ranged from 98.27 to 99.66%.

GETV_S_Korea GETV_M1, ALPV_M1, HB0234 and YN0540 showed the highest nucleotide sequence identity between the YN08 isolate and MPR GETV. the nucleotide sequence identity was lowest between the YN08 isolate and the south Korean isolate (93.61%). phylogenetic tree constructed using RT-PCR sequences of the non-structural protein gene nsP3 from YN08 isolates of GETV and other alphaviruses. previously published genetic sequences of GETV and other alphavirus capsid protein genes were used to construct phylogenetic trees. GETV is widely distributed in southeast Asia and northern Australia along the Pacific Ocean. GETV has been isolated from various mosquito species of the genera Culex, Aedes, and Armigeres. GETV could cause illnesses in humans and livestock animals. phylogenetic trees constructed using viruses sequence data are the best indication of the evolutionary relationships between viruses and genetic changes associated with antigenic drift. phylogenic analysis was performed based on the capsid protein gene and the 3\u2019-UTR sequence of YN08 and other 9 alphaviruses. yN08 is more closely related to HB0234 strain than YN0540 strain and more genetically distant to the MM2021 Malaysia primitive strain. chromosomal DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and cellular RNA must be removed from the preparation to perform VIDISCR. approximately 50% of PCR assays amplified DNA fragments in 20 VIDISCR selective PCR reactions (11/20; Table 1). currently, approximately 50% of PCR assays amplified DNA fragments in 20 VIDISCR selective PCR reactions (11/20; Table 1). fifty to 100 mosquitoes were sorted into a collection tube and stored in liquid nitrogen. pooled mosquitoes were added to 2 mL minimal essential medium. 100 L of supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and treated with DNase I for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. nucleic acids were extracted using the ribonuclease inhibitor. reverse transcription reaction was performed with random hexamer primers. electrophoresis and data collection were performed using an ABI 377 instrument (ABI) DNA molecular weight markers were obtained from Takara. identification of virus by electron microscopy GETV was observed. PCR products were analyzed on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels by electrophoresis at a constant voltage (2 V/cm) the non-structural protein gene nsP3, the capsid proteins genes and 3\u2019-UTR sequences were cloned and sequenced. pooled mosquitoes were added to 2 mL minimal essential medium. they were supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 0.12% NaHCO3, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin. ground samples were centrifuged at 13 800 g in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. the ribonuclease inhibitor is required to obtain the intact RNA sequence of virus genomes. a reverse transcription reaction was performed with random hexamer primers (Takara) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of DNA amplification. extract was centrifuged at 13 800 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. precipitate was resuspended in 5 mM phosphate buffered saline. PCR products were analyzed on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels by electrophoresis at a constant voltage (2 V/cm) non-structural protein gene nsP3, the capsid proteins genes and 3\u2019-UTR sequences were cloned and sequenced. authors declare that they have no competing interests. anshui Fan and Fuqiang Zhang participated in the design of the study. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
