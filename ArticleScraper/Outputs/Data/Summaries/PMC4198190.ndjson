{"summary": "pigs are naturally susceptible to three subtypes of influenza A viruses. the virus first encounters mucus, the first barrier of the respiratory tract. the virus reaches the target cells in the mucosal epithelium. the virus is also known to be the cellular receptor of influenza viruses. it is hypothesized that influenza viruses bind to these extracellular receptors, get entrapped in the mucus and then are removed by ciliary clearance [14]\u2013[16]. the effective cleavage may allow the efficient release of virus from the mucus. this contrasts with the findings of Ehre et al. [18] who demonstrated a strong protection of up-regulated mice against A/PR/8/34 H1N1 virus infection. two days before euthanization, the pigs were treated intramuscularly with ceftiofur (Naxcel, Pfizer-1 ml/20 kg body weight) the tracheas were dissected and the mucus was scraped with a spoon. the mucus samples were stored separately at 70\u00b0C until use. the sections were washed and mounted in 90% glycerin containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane (DABCO) the fluorescence signal was analyzed using a confocal microscope. the coverage of either SA was calculated by ratio of fluorescence signal to the region of interest (ROI) the virus suspension was brought on a discontinuous gradient containing 10\u201330% (w/v) of iodixanol and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 3 h at 4\u00b0C in an SW41Ti rotor. the visible opalescent virus bands at the interfaces were harvested separately. the suspension was ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 1.5 h in a type 35 rotor. after resuspension, the virions were clarified by a further ultracentrifugation at 100 000 g for 1.5 h. the staining was analyzed by randomly selecting 10 regions. 0.1 M glycine (pH 10.7) was added to 25 l of each sample containing 16 HA units. reactions were stopped with 0.1 M glycine (pH 10.7) in 25% ethanol. controls and standards were run in parallel. the virus was added to the mucus with or without the presence of 0.02 M zanamivir (Sigma) or 10 mU/ml Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. the mixture was placed in a custom made glass chamber. the samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min on the microscope. the suspension containing approximately 106.5 TCID50 purified SIV was brought in the form of 5 droplets onto the surface of the mucus. the time point \u201cimmediately after addition\u201d was designated as 2 min. immunofluorescence staining was performed using a mouse IgG antibody to SIV NP, followed by Goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with FITC to visualize the virions on the mucus. two days before euthanization, the pigs were treated intramuscularly with ceftiofur. mucus samples were negative for neuraminidase determined by NA assay. fluorescence lectin staining of 2,3- and 2,6-SA in mucus Freshly collected mucus was filled in a gelatin capsule (2.3 cm 0.8 cm), snap frozen in methocel (Fluka) the coverage of either SA was calculated by ratio of fluorescence signal to the region of interest (ROI) cells and virus Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 100 g/ml of streptomycin and 100 units/ml of penicillin. the buffer was exchanged with HNE (5 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) buffer. double staining was performed by using 3,3\u2032-Dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (Dio) and hyperimmune swine serum directed to influenza Sw/Belgium/1/98 virus. the ratio of viral antigen positive particles (virions) versus Dio positive particles was calculated. the band containing the most purified virus was obtained and the buffer was exchanged with HNE buffer. the virus suspension was filtered by the use of a Sephadex G-50 column. trajectories of fluorescent viral particles in porcine tracheal respiratory mucus were recorded by a fast and sensitive electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Cascade II: 512; Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ, USA) mounted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon TE2000E, Nikon Belux, Brussels, Belgium) movies were captured with the NIS Elements AR software (Nikon) at a temporal resolution of 33 ms for 5 s. the illumination time was 30 ms per frame. three independent experiments were performed for each condition. Cryosections of 12 m were made with a trimming interval of 400 m between each section. double immunofluorescence staining was performed using mouse anti-Muc5AC IgG1 (45M1, LifeSpan Biosciences, 1100) and mouse anti-NP IgG2a monoclonal antibodies. ten sections were made for each condition, then 10 images were taken. suspension containing 106 TCID50 SIV in the presence or absence of 0.1 M zanamivir or 50 mU/ml Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase at 37\u00b0C, for 1 h. sections were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, followed permeabilization in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. independent mucus samples were analyzed and error bars indicate the standard deviation. asterisks (**) indicate statistical significance (P0.01, Student\u2019s t-test). the labeled and unlabeled SIV were analyzed for different characteristics. the neuraminidase activity of Dio-labeled SIV was 91% of that of unlabeled SIV. the size and surface charge of the labeled virions were not significantly altered. the average diffusion coefficient of SIV in mucus was 11-fold higher than that of PRV. the similar size 100 nm PEGylated beads are muco-innert. this indicates that these particles did not interact with any type of mucus moieties. the viral particles were immobilized probably due to binding interactions with the mucus. 65% of the viral particles penetrated at 30 min more than 2-fold further than 2 min post virus addition. the average depth of virus penetration at 30 min was significantly higher than that of earlier time points. 55% of the mobile viral particles became stuck by the effect of zanamivir. exogenous neuraminidase increased the mobile particles by approximately 15%. average penetration of mock treated SIV was significantly higher than that of NAI treated virus. three independent samples were performed, and error bars indicate the standard deviation from 3 independent experiments. effects of NA on SIV binding to the porcine respiratory mucus Virus was visualized by immunofluorescence staining to the SIV NP. 2,3- and 2,6-SA coverage in the mucus was calculated by the ratio of pixels of positive signal to the total pixels measured. the 2,6-SA covered over 50% the region of interest, while merely 11% of the region was constituted by 2,3-SA. the highest viral purity (over 0.9 for the ratio of double positive particles/Dio positive particles) was found in Band 2. the virus preparation from Band 2 was used for further analysis. 256 340173250 Dio-Labeled SIV 28.15.1 113.52.5 8.50.23 256 309504172 *RFU = Relative Fluorescence Units. motion of SIV in porcine respiratory mucus was investigated. asterisks indicate statistical significance (P0.01, by Student\u2019s t-test) depth of SIV penetration could be visualized by double immunofluorescence staining of the muc5AC and SIV nucleoprotein (NP) mucin 5AC and SIV antigens were visualized by red and green color. average penetration depth of SIV at 2, 10 and 30 min post virus addition. neuraminidase helped SIV penetrate through the porcine respiratory mucus. neuraminidase (AUNA) on microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration of SIV in porcine respiratory mucus. distribution of diffusion coefficient of NAI, AUNA and mock treated SIV in mucus was refined with MEM. virions (green) bound to mucus sections in presence or absence (Mock) of Zanamivir (NAI) or Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (AUNA) exogenous neuraminidase was shown to promote microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration. this does not only confirm the beneficial effect of neuraminidase on releasing SIV from respiratory mucus, but highlights bidirectional synergistic interactions. surfactant protein D (SP-D) binds via a carbohydrate recognition domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner to N-linked carbohydrates present on the HA and NA of the influenza viruses. sIgA is retained at high concentrations in mucus where it can efficiently trap the pathogens. the ability of an influenza virus passing through the mucus may serve as a determinant for influenza virus transmission. swine influenza virus was able to escape from porcine airway mucus. a balance of binding to and releasing from mucin sialic acids may influence how efficiently the virus avoids sticking to mucus. human and swine influenza viruses have a preferential specificity for 2,3-SA. the sialic acids in respiratory mucus secretions may exert an effect on influenza virus transmission. we propose several strategies the influenza viruses may use to overcome the mucus barrier. the use of abundant and ubiquitous molecules as receptors provides the apparent advantage to the virus for allowing infection of multiple cell types and species. this can result in a low minimal infectious dose for initial infection. the slow settle of aerosols in the air can cause prolonged contact of the virus with the respiratory tract which benefits the virus penetration through the mucus layer. the role of influenza virus neuraminidase in cleavage of sialic acid from mucus may shed some light on unravelling the mechanism of influenza pneumonia."}
