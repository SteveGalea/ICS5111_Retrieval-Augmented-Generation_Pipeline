Brazil, Africa, and India are the top three countries/regions according to the number of articles collected from the database. the rest of the top 10 countries/regions are Bangladesh, Spain, China, Mexico, South Africa, Kenya, and sub-saharan africa. the rapid increase in research in Brazil may be due to the rapid urbanization of Latin America in the last few decades. six grantees were chosen from 108 applicants to develop innovative, affordable, and scalable sanitation technologies. in china, 98% of the urban population has access to improved toilets (as of 2012); the coverage of sanitary toilets in rural areas was 7.5% in 1993, 74.1% in 2013, and 78.4% in 2015. excreta and wastewater are not recognized as hazardous waste, but valuable resources that can be reused and recycled. the research hotspots can be classified into three categories: (i) hygienization of excreta, (ii) resource recovery from excreta. the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms depended on either the temperature and pH or only the temperature. stored urine could then be used to fertilize crops without restriction. ludge treatment, and other treatment processes, like composting and anaerobic digestion, could have an effect on pathogen inactivation at some level. the most direct way to use urine and feces as fertilizer for agriculture occurs after proper processing, especially in low-income areas. fecal sludge recycling after anaerobic digestion is another alternative. reuse of urine and feces after stabilization and hygienization is a concern. new engineering technologies have become viable alternatives for the efficient commercial recovery of nutrients. struvite is magnesium ammonium phosphate (MgNH4PO46H2O, MAP), which is the chemical precipitation that occurs at an alkaline pH with a suitable ratio of ammonium, phosphorus, and phosphorus. the addition of magnesium is necessary for struvite formation to meet the chemical equilibrium of the constituent ions in the solution. the ferric ion (Fe3+) has also been used for phosphorus recovery. it was estimated that the available phosphorus from urine and feces produced in urban settings is approximately 0.88 million metric tons. this will increase with population growth to over 1.5 million metric tons by 2050. micro-pollutant control of excreta: sustainable sanitation takes into consideration both the reuse and safe disposal of waste after treatment. heavy metals can accumulate in crops and throughout the food chain, creating a health risk for humans. antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections; they are difficult to degrade. photochemical processes with nanomaterials have been used as new approaches to remove antibiotics and promote antibiotic-resistant microbe removal in wastewater treatment. the practical applications of such technologies for micro-pollutant removal in the sanitation sector are unclear. of the 11,956 articles, 10,049 (84%) were published in English. the number of articles published per year increased over the study period. there were 140 articles published in 1992 and 1147 in 2016. of times each article was cited fluctuated, with a peak average of 27.4 citations in 1997 and an average low of less than five citations in recent years. about 10% of the sample consisted of five (1491, 12.4%), one (1463, 12.2%), and six (1136, 9.5%) authors together. the Lancet published the article with the largest number of authors. 851 3.3 6385 24.8 2266 8.8 406 1.6 283 1.1 5537 21.5 2001 231 792 3.4 5077 22.0 2061 8.9 367 1.6 265 1.1 4837 20.9 2002 267 985 3.7 7509 28.1 2687 10.1 500 1.9 340 1.3 6674 25.0 2003 268 945 3.5 7162 26.7 2457 9.2 470 1.8 313 1.2 5574 20.8 2004 290 1085 1.6 3075 3.0 2016 1147 6920 6.0 45,405 39.6 12,698 11.1 3505 3.1 1852 1.6 1244 1.1 Total 11,956 53,527 376,441 115,152 26,645 15,952 133,297 Average 4.0 26.6 9.1 1.9 1.2 14.7. 207 contributors from 26 countries and 103 institutes reviewed the leading risk factors for global disease burden. it ranked second for the most frequently cited research article per year. it emphasized the risks from unsafe sanitation and water. it disclosed that behavioral, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of the global mortality rate. water research had the highest JIF value (6.942) and h-index (33);

Fig. 9a and b show that children suffer primarily from diarrhea. WHO website noted that every year, 361,000 children under five years age die from diarrhea. india has the largest number of the world's growth-stunted children in Asia. the key issue is a lack of toilets rather than lack of food. in china, 98% of the urban population has access to improved toilets. the percentage of the urban population living in south Sudan without safe toilets accounted for 83.6% of the total, which dominates the list. india has 157 million urbanites living without sanitation, ranking first for the most people without access to proper toilet facilities. antimicrobial resistance is a new concern from a hygienization point of view. the hygienization of human excreta is essential for reducing transmission of diseases by pathogenic microorganisms. the health risk can be eliminated through natural attenuation or existing disinfection technologies. self-sanitization by ammonia and a high temperature is also effective for fecal sludge. time needed to eliminate pathogens is longer than that needed for urine. alkaline additives, such as ash, sawdust, and urea, could speed up hygienization process. most direct way to use urine and feces as fertilizer for agriculture occurs after proper processing, especially in low-income areas or regions dominated by agriculture. feces contain some nutrients and organic material, which can act as good soil conditioners after aerobic stabilization. ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation are two of the most commonly employed techniques in nutrient recovery from source-separated urine. ammonia stripping is a physicochemical process that strips ammonium to gaseous NH3 which is then recovered as liquid ammonia, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium carbonate. a combination of ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation has been investigated. 85\u201399% of the nitrogen and 99% of the phosphorus (w/w) can be harvested from hydrolyzed urine in 28 h at 40 \u00b0C and in 32 h at 30 \u00b0C. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) and Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs) are two key microbial electrochemical technologies. it was first demonstrated in 2012 that MFCs generated electricity from diluted urine. this electricity could be used to power cell phones (Ieropoulos et al., 2013). heavy metals (such as Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Hg) have been detected in solid waste from human excreta. antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. nano-filtration, active carbon adsorption and other advanced treatment processes could be alternative technologies for micro-pollutant removal. we excluded the 6493 articles without author keyword information and analyzed 11,956 articles with the author keyword information. there were 22,391 keywords listed by authors; however, 17,310 (77.3%) of the keywords were used only once and 2335 (10.0%) of the keywords were used twice. risk factor 159 7 (1.8) 19 (1.1) 5 (2.0) 13 (1.4) 4 (1.9) 6 (1.8) Water supply 150 8 (1.6) 5 (3.4) 53 (0.6) 2 (2.9) 10 (1.5) 14 (1.4) Water quality 149 9 (1.6) 10 (1.7) 8 (1.9) 13 (1.4) 11 (1.5) 6 (1.8) Brazil 132 10 (1.5) 65 (0.6) 25 (0.9) 19 (1.2) 5 (1.8) 11 (1.5) Prevalence the most frequently-used keyword (\u201csanitation\u201d) was ignored. the three most frequently-used keywords were \u201cepidemiology\u201d (205; 2.3%), \u201cwater\u201d (198; 2.2%), and \u201cpublic health\u201d (176; 1.9%) \u201cwater\u201d was increasingly studied and enjoyed a rise in rank from 65th in 1992\u20131996 to 2nd in 2012\u20132016. \u201cwater supply\u201d (150, 1.7%), \u201cwater quality\u201d (149, 1.6%), \u201cwastewater\u201d (97, 1.1%), and \u201cdrinking water\u201d (90, 1.0%) ranked 8th, 9th, 19th, and 25th, respectively, as the most frequently-used keywords. \u201cIndia\u201d and \u201cAfrica\u201d ranked 158th and 174th, respectively, in 1997\u20132001 and 8th and 27th, respectively, in 2012\u20132016. \u201cChild\u201d (111, 1.2%) ranked 17th in the top 30 keywords, but it was ranked 65th from 1992 to 1996. this trend occurred because children are the most sensitive to poor sanitation. the word cluster analysis uses the author keywords, article title, article abstracts, and KeyWords Plus to identify patterns in data. Fig. 9 shows the growth trend of hotspot-related articles during the last 25 years in the six categories. the rapid increase in research in Brazil may be due to the rapid urbanization of Latin America in the last few decades. 2% of the population still practiced open defecation as of 2015. most african countries, including south africa, sub-saharan africa, and Kenya, lacked clean water, basic sanitation, and good personal hygiene. the BMGF has been funding RTTC activity in china since 2013. the majority of those without improved sanitation are people who live in rural areas. the number of articles with \u201curban\u201d even exceeded the number of articles that included \u201crural\u201d in the keywords. hygienization of excreta is essential for reducing transmission of diseases by pathogenic microorganisms. human urine contains very few, if any, pathogens, but the amount increases due to cross-contamination with feces. the inactivation of E. coli, Salmonella, and MS2 was faster than that in urine stored at ambient temperature. the rapid inactivation of bacteria could be achieved by coupling other technologies with this process, such as acidification and nitrification. the average amounts of phosphate, nitrogen, and potassium in human urine are approximately 5.6 kg, 0.5 kg, and 1.0 kg per person per year. the main form of nitrogen in urine is ammonia due to the hydrolysis of urea during storage, while the phosphorus in urine exists as inorganic phosphate ions. the most direct way to use urine and feces as fertilizer for agriculture occurs after proper processing. ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation are two of the most commonly employed techniques in nutrient recovery from source-separated urine. the process strips ammonium to gaseous NH3, then recovered as liquid ammonia, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium carbonate. a combination of ammonia stripping and precipitation to improve nitrogen and phosphorus recovery has been investigated. 90% of the phosphorous and approximately 20% of the nitrogen could be recovered through MAP crystallization. ferric ion (Fe3+) has been used for phosphorus recovery. phosphorus from urine and feces will increase with population growth to 1.5 million metric tons by 2050. other technologies that transform the wastewater treatment system, such as ion exchange, membranes, and bio-electrochemical systems have also been investigated. micro-pollutant control of excreta: Sustainable sanitation takes into consideration both the reuse and safe disposal of waste after treatment. heavy metals can accumulate in crops and throughout the food chain, creating a health risk for humans. antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections; they are difficult to degrade. gaps in global sanitation still exist in the form of technical, economic, social, cultural, educational, political, and institutional challenges. government support, social acceptability, as well as technological reliability are necessary. the developed toilet should adapt to religious belief, ethnic culture, and economic level. the relevant policy refers to sustainable market-driven mechanisms to support its development, viability, and up-scaling of the technologies. social acceptance refers to the acceptance of both the treatment process and end products. cultural tradition decides whether the innovative toilet system changes the habits of the users. TRL (Technology readiness level) are a method of estimating technology maturity of critical technology elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. MAP refers to MgNH4PO46H2O; MFC refers to Microbial Fuel Cells. lysis Cells; MPP refers to MgKPO46H2O. \u201c+\u201d refers to the identified technique is satisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. \u201c+\u201d refers to the identified technique is satisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. \u201c\u201d refers to the identified technique is unsatisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. \u201c\u201d refers to the identified technique is satisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. only 26.6% of the NGO-donated sanitation interventions were in use after two years. this low sustainability was primarily influenced by the lack of consideration of the institutional, technical, educational, operational, social, and cultural factors. a functional and coordinated link between these factors can support high-quality sanitation and hygiene services. there is a severe lack of skilled staff that can effectively and efficiently facilitate the sustainable sanitation process, which hampers the continuous follow-up and monitoring of these systems. the improvement of health and sanitation services calls for a good understanding of the actors at various levels. one-third of the technologies are at the TRL level 4. the rest of the technologies would require further development for practical utilization. storage techniques for excreta have a positive effect for their hygienization. but since a large space and long retention time are required for the process, its application is limited in an urban context. the challenges of MAP/MPP precipitation are related to the high recovery efficiency of nutrients and the purification of the products. the social, cultural, economic, political, and educational factors have a great effect on the implementation of sanitation solutions. a functional and coordinated link among these factors can support high-quality sanitation and hygiene services. the state should lay a foundation and enforce health standards and regulations. the improvement of health and sanitation services calls for a good understanding of the actors at various levels, the full involvement and continuous support of the community, and institutional, legal, and contractual linkages. the technologies developed should not only meet the technical standards, but satisfy the social acceptance. there is no one-size-fits-all approach for achieving the successful implementation of adequate global sanitation. Efforts should be made from view of government support, social acceptability, and technological reliability to realize a holistic solution."}{"summary": "in the 1990s, 192 UN member states and at least 23 international organizations agreed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the world summits. in September 2015, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was adopted by world leaders at the UN, calling on countries to begin new efforts to achieve 17 SDGs. the new toilet system won the challenge is a truly aspirational next-generation product that operates \u201coff the grid\u201d without connections to centralized water, sewers, or electrical supplies. the toilet costs (consists of both fundamental investment and operation cost) 5 cents (US) per user per day. resource recycling should be economically viable, socially acceptable, and technically and institutionally appropriate. it should protect the environment and conserve natural resources. the results offer a comprehensive overview of current issues and perceptions in sanitation research. the document type, language, output, subject category, journal, country, institute, source title, abstract keywords, and h-index were all analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010. by identifying the institution and country of at least one author, we were able to estimate the influence of a country and its research facility. the 2017 JCR covers 11,459 journals across 236 scientific disciplines spanning 81 countries. we used bibliometric analysis, which has been adopted in other studies. h-index was regarded as the h of Np articles were cited no less than h times each. the same research facility identified works from different research facilities. we used data from the JCR, Science Edition, 2017 for the values of the journal impact factor. we also applied \u201cword cluster analysis\u201d to explore the research patterns and hotspots. of the 11,956 articles, 10,049 (84%) were published in English, followed by Portuguese (651), Spanish (508), French (315), German (134), Japanese (65), Italian (62), Polish (61), Russian (29), Chinese (16), Croatian (14), Turkish (7), Hungarian (6), Korean (6), Slovene (5), Dutch (4), Romanian (4), Slovak (3), Malay (2), Lithuanian (1) and Serbo-Croatian (1) the average article length and average number of countries per article fluctuated slightly, with an overall mean length of 9.1 pages and average of 1.2 countries. the number of times each article was cited fluctuated, with a peak average of 27.4 citations in 1997 and an average low of less than five citations in recent years. 2000 257 851 3.3 6385 24.8 2266 8.8 406 1.6 283 1.1 5537 21.5 2001 231 792 3.4 5077 22.0 2061 8.9 367 1.6 265 1.1 4837 20.9 2002 267 985 3.7 7509 28.1 2687 10.1 500 1.9 340 1.3 6674 25.0 2003 268 945 3.5 7162 26.7 2457 9.2 470 1.8 313 1.2 5574 20.8 2004 290 207 contributors from 26 countries and 103 institutes reviewed the leading risk factors for global disease burden. the authors presented evidence of key risks including poor water quality and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. research emphasized the risks from unsafe sanitation and water. it disclosed that behavioral, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of the global mortality rate and more than one-third of the global-disability-adjusted life-years. h-index of 8 published the most articles (157; 1.3%), followed by the Journal of food protection (140; 1.2%), Water Science and Technology (130; 1.1%), and the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (122; 1.0%). water research had the highest JIF value (6.942) and h-index (33); this journal was the top publication for water resources. there was a strong dominance of five journals. these publications were responsible for 677 (5.6%) of the articles studied.

Brazil, Africa, and India are the top three countries/regions according to the number of articles collected from the database. the rest of the top 10 countries/regions are Bangladesh, Spain, China, Mexico, South Africa, Kenya, and sub-saharan africa. the rapid increase in research in Brazil may be due to the rapid urbanization of Latin America in the last few decades. six grantees were chosen from 108 applicants to develop innovative, affordable, and scalable sanitation technologies. in china, 98% of the urban population has access to improved toilets (as of 2012); the coverage of sanitary toilets in rural areas was 7.5% in 1993, 74.1% in 2013, and 78.4% in 2015. excreta and wastewater are not recognized as hazardous waste, but valuable resources that can be reused and recycled. the research hotspots can be classified into three categories: (i) hygienization of excreta, (ii) resource recovery from excreta. the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms depended on either the temperature and pH or only the temperature. stored urine could then be used to fertilize crops without restriction. ludge treatment, and other treatment processes, like composting and anaerobic digestion, could have an effect on pathogen inactivation at some level. the most direct way to use urine and feces as fertilizer for agriculture occurs after proper processing, especially in low-income areas. fecal sludge recycling after anaerobic digestion is another alternative. reuse of urine and feces after stabilization and hygienization is a concern. new engineering technologies have become viable alternatives for the efficient commercial recovery of nutrients. struvite is magnesium ammonium phosphate (MgNH4PO46H2O, MAP), which is the chemical precipitation that occurs at an alkaline pH with a suitable ratio of ammonium, phosphorus, and phosphorus. the addition of magnesium is necessary for struvite formation to meet the chemical equilibrium of the constituent ions in the solution. the ferric ion (Fe3+) has also been used for phosphorus recovery. it was estimated that the available phosphorus from urine and feces produced in urban settings is approximately 0.88 million metric tons. this will increase with population growth to over 1.5 million metric tons by 2050. micro-pollutant control of excreta: sustainable sanitation takes into consideration both the reuse and safe disposal of waste after treatment. heavy metals can accumulate in crops and throughout the food chain, creating a health risk for humans. antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections; they are difficult to degrade. photochemical processes with nanomaterials have been used as new approaches to remove antibiotics and promote antibiotic-resistant microbe removal in wastewater treatment. the practical applications of such technologies for micro-pollutant removal in the sanitation sector are unclear. of the 11,956 articles, 10,049 (84%) were published in English. the number of articles published per year increased over the study period. there were 140 articles published in 1992 and 1147 in 2016. of times each article was cited fluctuated, with a peak average of 27.4 citations in 1997 and an average low of less than five citations in recent years. about 10% of the sample consisted of five (1491, 12.4%), one (1463, 12.2%), and six (1136, 9.5%) authors together. the Lancet published the article with the largest number of authors. 851 3.3 6385 24.8 2266 8.8 406 1.6 283 1.1 5537 21.5 2001 231 792 3.4 5077 22.0 2061 8.9 367 1.6 265 1.1 4837 20.9 2002 267 985 3.7 7509 28.1 2687 10.1 500 1.9 340 1.3 6674 25.0 2003 268 945 3.5 7162 26.7 2457 9.2 470 1.8 313 1.2 5574 20.8 2004 290 1085 1.6 3075 3.0 2016 1147 6920 6.0 45,405 39.6 12,698 11.1 3505 3.1 1852 1.6 1244 1.1 Total 11,956 53,527 376,441 115,152 26,645 15,952 133,297 Average 4.0 26.6 9.1 1.9 1.2 14.7. 207 contributors from 26 countries and 103 institutes reviewed the leading risk factors for global disease burden. it ranked second for the most frequently cited research article per year. it emphasized the risks from unsafe sanitation and water. it disclosed that behavioral, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of the global mortality rate. water research had the highest JIF value (6.942) and h-index (33);

Fig. 6 shows the results of our analysis. each country (shown as a circle) is sized according to the weight of its publications. the line weight of each circle identifies the nation's research cooperation with authors from other regions. some non-sewer and source oriented toilet systems have been developed. from 2011 to 2013, 15 grants have been awarded for innovated toilet developers. a solar panel will produce enough power for an electrochemical reactor designed to break down water and human waste. fig. 7 shows trends and times cited per year for articles from the USA and Brazil. of the 11,956 articles spanning 11,781 institutes in 182 countries, 6890 (58.5%) were inter-institutionally collaborative publications. the collaboration between institutes was 34.7% higher than that between countries. 188 82.82 (11) Univ Estadual Campinas, Brazil (17) 22 (5) 9.69 (21) London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, UK 129 2 (1.1) 6 4.65 123 95.35 (4) Emory Univ, USA (31) 22 (5) 17.05 (19) Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, USA 115 3 (1.0) 15 13.04 100 86.96 (8) Emory Univ, USA (9) 34 (1) 29.57 63 80.77 (14) London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, UK (13) 18 (15) 23.08 (13) Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, UK 76 12 (0.6) 15 19.74 61 80.26 (16) Emory Univ, USA (12) 21 (8) 27.63 (10) INRA, France 74 13 (0.6) 14 18.92 60 81.08 (13) Agrocampus Ouest, France; Inst Elevage, France (5) 19 (13) the \u2018Center for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services\u2019, \u2018WHO\u2019 and the \u2018University of North Carolina\u2019 are the top three institutions in h-index with high values of 34, 28, and 27 respectively. over half of the 20 institutes were universities, demonstrating that the universities are the core drivers of sanitation research. top 30 used author keywords in 5 five-year periods (1992\u20132016) authors 92\u201316 TA 92\u201316 R (%) 92\u201396 R (%) 97\u201301 R (%) 02\u201306 R (%) 07\u201311 R (%) 12\u201316 R (%). coli 130 12 (1.4) 65 (0.6) 25 (0.9) 5 (2.2) 15 (1.3) 10 (1.5) Food safety 126 13 (1.4) N/A 19 (1.2) 27 (1.0) 8 (1.7) 11 (1.5) Landfill 121 14 (1.3) 6 (2.5) 12 (1.6) 3 (2.4) 17 (1.1) 21 (1.0) Developing countries 120 15 (1.3) 15 (1.4) 22 (1.0) 7 (1.8) 6 (1.7) 24 (1.0) a 74 28 (0.8) 174 (0.3) 53 (0.6) 60 (0.5) 43 (0.6) 20 (1.1) groundwater 71 29 (0.8) 19 (1.1) 25 (0.9) 32 (0.8) 50 (0.6) 25 (0.9) Pathogen 66 30 (0.7) 10 (1.7) 34 (0.7) 27 (1.0) 38 (0.6) 46 (0.6) the pathogenic indicator bacteria \u201cE. coli\u201d and \u201cSalmonella\u201d ranked 12th and 21st in the most frequently used keywords. this trend could be attributed to the fact that E. coli is common in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. from 1992 to 1996, improved sanitation was a primary focus of research. it was important to ensure the hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact. the proposed facilities included flush/pour-flush-to-piped-sewer systems and ventilated improved pit latrines. Fig. 9a and b show that children suffer primarily from diarrhea. WHO website noted that every year, 361,000 children under five years age die from diarrhea. india has the largest number of the world's growth-stunted children in Asia. the key issue is a lack of toilets rather than lack of food. in china, 98% of the urban population has access to improved toilets. the percentage of the urban population living in south Sudan without safe toilets accounted for 83.6% of the total, which dominates the list. india has 157 million urbanites living without sanitation, ranking first for the most people without access to proper toilet facilities. antimicrobial resistance is a new concern from a hygienization point of view. the hygienization of human excreta is essential for reducing transmission of diseases by pathogenic microorganisms. the health risk can be eliminated through natural attenuation or existing disinfection technologies. self-sanitization by ammonia and a high temperature is also effective for fecal sludge. time needed to eliminate pathogens is longer than that needed for urine. alkaline additives, such as ash, sawdust, and urea, could speed up hygienization process. most direct way to use urine and feces as fertilizer for agriculture occurs after proper processing, especially in low-income areas or regions dominated by agriculture. feces contain some nutrients and organic material, which can act as good soil conditioners after aerobic stabilization. ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation are two of the most commonly employed techniques in nutrient recovery from source-separated urine. ammonia stripping is a physicochemical process that strips ammonium to gaseous NH3 which is then recovered as liquid ammonia, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium carbonate. a combination of ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation has been investigated. 85\u201399% of the nitrogen and 99% of the phosphorus (w/w) can be harvested from hydrolyzed urine in 28 h at 40 \u00b0C and in 32 h at 30 \u00b0C. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) and Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs) are two key microbial electrochemical technologies. it was first demonstrated in 2012 that MFCs generated electricity from diluted urine. this electricity could be used to power cell phones (Ieropoulos et al., 2013). heavy metals (such as Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Hg) have been detected in solid waste from human excreta. antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. nano-filtration, active carbon adsorption and other advanced treatment processes could be alternative technologies for micro-pollutant removal. we excluded the 6493 articles without author keyword information and analyzed 11,956 articles with the author keyword information. there were 22,391 keywords listed by authors; however, 17,310 (77.3%) of the keywords were used only once and 2335 (10.0%) of the keywords were used twice. risk factor 159 7 (1.8) 19 (1.1) 5 (2.0) 13 (1.4) 4 (1.9) 6 (1.8) Water supply 150 8 (1.6) 5 (3.4) 53 (0.6) 2 (2.9) 10 (1.5) 14 (1.4) Water quality 149 9 (1.6) 10 (1.7) 8 (1.9) 13 (1.4) 11 (1.5) 6 (1.8) Brazil 132 10 (1.5) 65 (0.6) 25 (0.9) 19 (1.2) 5 (1.8) 11 (1.5) Prevalence the most frequently-used keyword (\u201csanitation\u201d) was ignored. the three most frequently-used keywords were \u201cepidemiology\u201d (205; 2.3%), \u201cwater\u201d (198; 2.2%), and \u201cpublic health\u201d (176; 1.9%) \u201cwater\u201d was increasingly studied and enjoyed a rise in rank from 65th in 1992\u20131996 to 2nd in 2012\u20132016. \u201cwater supply\u201d (150, 1.7%), \u201cwater quality\u201d (149, 1.6%), \u201cwastewater\u201d (97, 1.1%), and \u201cdrinking water\u201d (90, 1.0%) ranked 8th, 9th, 19th, and 25th, respectively, as the most frequently-used keywords. \u201cIndia\u201d and \u201cAfrica\u201d ranked 158th and 174th, respectively, in 1997\u20132001 and 8th and 27th, respectively, in 2012\u20132016. \u201cChild\u201d (111, 1.2%) ranked 17th in the top 30 keywords, but it was ranked 65th from 1992 to 1996. this trend occurred because children are the most sensitive to poor sanitation. the word cluster analysis uses the author keywords, article title, article abstracts, and KeyWords Plus to identify patterns in data. Fig. 9 shows the growth trend of hotspot-related articles during the last 25 years in the six categories. the rapid increase in research in Brazil may be due to the rapid urbanization of Latin America in the last few decades. 2% of the population still practiced open defecation as of 2015. most african countries, including south africa, sub-saharan africa, and Kenya, lacked clean water, basic sanitation, and good personal hygiene. the BMGF has been funding RTTC activity in china since 2013. the majority of those without improved sanitation are people who live in rural areas. the number of articles with \u201curban\u201d even exceeded the number of articles that included \u201crural\u201d in the keywords. hygienization of excreta is essential for reducing transmission of diseases by pathogenic microorganisms. human urine contains very few, if any, pathogens, but the amount increases due to cross-contamination with feces. the inactivation of E. coli, Salmonella, and MS2 was faster than that in urine stored at ambient temperature. the rapid inactivation of bacteria could be achieved by coupling other technologies with this process, such as acidification and nitrification. the average amounts of phosphate, nitrogen, and potassium in human urine are approximately 5.6 kg, 0.5 kg, and 1.0 kg per person per year. the main form of nitrogen in urine is ammonia due to the hydrolysis of urea during storage, while the phosphorus in urine exists as inorganic phosphate ions. the most direct way to use urine and feces as fertilizer for agriculture occurs after proper processing. ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation are two of the most commonly employed techniques in nutrient recovery from source-separated urine. the process strips ammonium to gaseous NH3, then recovered as liquid ammonia, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium carbonate. a combination of ammonia stripping and precipitation to improve nitrogen and phosphorus recovery has been investigated. 90% of the phosphorous and approximately 20% of the nitrogen could be recovered through MAP crystallization. ferric ion (Fe3+) has been used for phosphorus recovery. phosphorus from urine and feces will increase with population growth to 1.5 million metric tons by 2050. other technologies that transform the wastewater treatment system, such as ion exchange, membranes, and bio-electrochemical systems have also been investigated. micro-pollutant control of excreta: Sustainable sanitation takes into consideration both the reuse and safe disposal of waste after treatment. heavy metals can accumulate in crops and throughout the food chain, creating a health risk for humans. antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections; they are difficult to degrade. gaps in global sanitation still exist in the form of technical, economic, social, cultural, educational, political, and institutional challenges. government support, social acceptability, as well as technological reliability are necessary. the developed toilet should adapt to religious belief, ethnic culture, and economic level. the relevant policy refers to sustainable market-driven mechanisms to support its development, viability, and up-scaling of the technologies. social acceptance refers to the acceptance of both the treatment process and end products. cultural tradition decides whether the innovative toilet system changes the habits of the users. TRL (Technology readiness level) are a method of estimating technology maturity of critical technology elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. MAP refers to MgNH4PO46H2O; MFC refers to Microbial Fuel Cells. lysis Cells; MPP refers to MgKPO46H2O. \u201c+\u201d refers to the identified technique is satisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. \u201c+\u201d refers to the identified technique is satisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. \u201c\u201d refers to the identified technique is unsatisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. \u201c\u201d refers to the identified technique is satisfied with the corresponding evaluation aspects. only 26.6% of the NGO-donated sanitation interventions were in use after two years. this low sustainability was primarily influenced by the lack of consideration of the institutional, technical, educational, operational, social, and cultural factors. a functional and coordinated link between these factors can support high-quality sanitation and hygiene services. there is a severe lack of skilled staff that can effectively and efficiently facilitate the sustainable sanitation process, which hampers the continuous follow-up and monitoring of these systems. the improvement of health and sanitation services calls for a good understanding of the actors at various levels. one-third of the technologies are at the TRL level 4. the rest of the technologies would require further development for practical utilization. storage techniques for excreta have a positive effect for their hygienization. but since a large space and long retention time are required for the process, its application is limited in an urban context. the challenges of MAP/MPP precipitation are related to the high recovery efficiency of nutrients and the purification of the products. the social, cultural, economic, political, and educational factors have a great effect on the implementation of sanitation solutions. a functional and coordinated link among these factors can support high-quality sanitation and hygiene services. the state should lay a foundation and enforce health standards and regulations. the improvement of health and sanitation services calls for a good understanding of the actors at various levels, the full involvement and continuous support of the community, and institutional, legal, and contractual linkages. the technologies developed should not only meet the technical standards, but satisfy the social acceptance. there is no one-size-fits-all approach for achieving the successful implementation of adequate global sanitation. Efforts should be made from view of government support, social acceptability, and technological reliability to realize a holistic solution."}
