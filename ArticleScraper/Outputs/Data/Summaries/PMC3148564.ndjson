{"summary": "Cardiovirus genus consists two distinct species: Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theilovirus (ThV) there are a lot differences between the two species. the differences of codon usage in EMCV and ThV were compared. the synonymous codon usage pattern in both EMCV and ThV genes is gene function and geography specific, but not host specific. EMCVs comprise a single serotype and have a wide host range [11-21], while the ThV species probably includes four serotypes. virus (VHEV), Thera virus (TRV; isolated from rats) and Saffold virus (SAFV; isolated from humans) 1-8. the strains in Cardiovirus also consist a open-read-frame (ORF), 5'-untranslate region (5'-UTR) and 3'-untranslate region (3'-UTR) the (C+G)3% values of EMCV strains range from 46.47 to 52.11% with a mean of 48.90 and S.D. of 2.18. ThV strains range from 37.35 to 51.00, with a mean of 43.72 and S.D. of 5.77. 1.38 GAG(E) 1.07 GAG(E) 0.62 Gly GGU(G) 1.06 GGU(G) 1.14 GGC(G) 0.92 GGC(G) 1.25 GGA(G) 1.53 GGG(G) 0.77 GGG(G) 0.32 His CAU(H) 1.23 CAU(H) 0.84 CAC(H) 0.77 CAC(H) 1.16 Ile AUU(I) 1.61 AUU(I) 1.

(C+G)% has a highly significant correlation with each of A%, U%, C% and G% among the ThV strains but not among the EMCV strains. this indicates that the (C+G)% and (C+G)3% may reflect some more important characteristics of codon usage pattern of ThV compared with EMCV. the results show that for EMCV there are no significant correlations between (C+G)3%, (C+G)12%, axis f'1 and axis f'2 are observed, while the results of ThV are opposite. all of the spots lie below the expected curve (Figure 2).

Effective number of codons used in each ORF plotted against the (C+G)3. RSCU, ENC, COA, and GC3S were used to measure the synonymous codon usage bias in coding regions of both EMCV and ThV. there were several synonymous codons with strong discrepancy for codon usage in each genus. a general mutational pressure, which affects the whole genome, would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. mutational pressure, rather than natural selection, is supported by the highly significant correlation between (C+G)12% and (C+G)3% (r = -0.736 for EMCV; r = 0.986 for ThV, P 0.01). serotype may be one factor for codon bias in Cardiovirus. location has no significant effect on variations of synonymous codon usage in these viruses. 39 sequences used in this study SN Strain Species Serotype Location Accession No. 1 BEL-2887A/91 EMCV EMCV Belgium AF356822 2 BJC3 EMCV EMCV China DQ464062 3 HB1 EMCV EMCV China DQ464063 4 GX0601 EMCV EMCV China FJ604852 5 GX0602 EMCV EMCV China FJ897755 7 NJ08 the effective number of codons (ENC) was calculated to quantify the codon usage bias of an ORF. the effective number of codons (ENC) was calculated to quantify the codon usage bias of an ORF. in an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid, this value would be 20; if all codons are used equally, it would be 61; and if the value of the ENC is greater than 40, the codon usage bias was regarded as a low bias [25] the values of ENC were obtained by CodonW program. the information of the 39 sequences used in this study SN Strain Species Serotype Location Accession No. 1 BEL-2887A/91 EMCV EMCV Belgium AF356822 2 BJC3 EMCV EMCV China DQ464062 3 HB1 EMCV EMCV China DQ464063 4 GX0601 EMCV EMCV China FJ604852 5 GX0602 EMCV EMCV China FJ604853 the effective number of codons (ENC) was calculated to quantify the codon usage bias of an ORF. the effective number of codons (ENC) was calculated to quantify the codon usage bias of an ORF. codon usage bias was regarded as a low bias [25] in an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid, this value would be 20; if all codons are used equally, it would be 61; and if the value of the ENC is greater than 40, the codon usage bias was regarded as a low bias. correspondence analysis was used to investigate the major trend in codon usage variation among genes.
