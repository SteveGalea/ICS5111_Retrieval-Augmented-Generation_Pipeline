{"summary": "the introduction the genetic code refers to the sequences of DNA and RNA nucleotides that determine amino acid sequences in proteins. the genetic code comprises 64 codons encoding 20 amino acids. the most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. E. festucae is a biotrophic fungus that systemically colonizes the aerial tissues of the cool-season grasses Festuca, Lolium, and Koeleria spp. to form a highly structured symbiotic hyphal network [23,24,25,26]. this study analyzed the codon usage bias of E. festucae and its relationship with other genome features. GC content for the total 4870 genes varies from 46.43% 5.80% (GC2) to 64.11% 10.16% (GC3). a mean value of 56.41% 4.6% is distributed mainly between 24.80% and 73.00%. the greatest differences of GC content are found in GC2 (46.43% 5.80%) and GC3 (64.11% 10.16%) neutrality plot shows that E. festucae genes exhibit a wide range of GC3 values, ranging from 21.82% to 91.67%. there was a significant positive correlation between GC12 and GC3 (r = 0.121, p 0.01) the slope of the regression line was 0.0486. most genes appear in the 0.0\u20130.1 range, suggesting that most observed ENC values are smaller than the expected values based on the GC3s. mutation plays a role in shaping codon usage in E. festucae. an ENC plot was generated to explore the influence of GC3s on codon bias in a gene. the translation efficiency constrains codon choice. the degree of codon usage bias is related to the level of gene expression. highly-expressed genes reduce the use of these codons under the selection pressure as far as possible. r = 0.193, p > 0.01) values, but were significantly negatively correlated with the GC3s. this suggests that ENC may be the main factor shaping codon bias in E. festucae. the CAI (Codon adaptation index) exhibited a significant positive correlation with GC (r = 0.018, p 0.01), GC3 (r = 0.265, p 0.01), GC3s (r = 0.266, p 0.01), T3s (r = 0.045, p 0.01), GRAVY (r = 0.080, p 0.01), and Aromo (r = 0.144, p 0.01) values both nucleotide composition and gene expression level are major factors shaping codon usage bias in E. festucae. the correlation coefficients for the positions of genes along the first four major axes were analyzed with their indices of amino acid usage in Table 3. four methods of correspondence analysis (CA) have been developed based on three types of input data for synonymous codon usage in 241 bacteria genomes. the result shows that WCA is more effective than the other three methods in generating axes that reflect variations in synonymous codon usage. this is the first study of the codon usage in fungi of Epichlo endophytes. E. festucae exhibits weak codon biases based on the RSCU values of the 61 sense codons. twenty-five codons were frequently used, such as CUC (RSCU = 1.84) and GGC (RSCU = 1.79) most frequent codons ended in a G or C, such as UUC, UUG, AUC, and Gly. 86 CCC 49,710 1.37 CCA 35,372 0.83 CCG 36,167 0.93 Thr ACU 27,362 0.71 ACC 46,502 1.30 ACA 31,612 0.81 ACG 40,791 1.17 Ala GCU 49,281 0.84 GCC 88,269 1.58 GCA 44,142 0.75 GCG 45,406 0.83 TER UGA 2445 1.39 UAA 1271 0.74 UAG 1529 0.87 Trp 74 1.03 4414 Leu UUA 0.03 86 0.54 2081 UUG 0.55 1375 1.27 4893 CUU 0.29 744 1.22 4713 CUC * 2.90 7320 1.10 4257 CUA 0.14 358 0.71 2725 CUG * 2.08 5252 1.16 4456 Ile AUU 0.57 1339 1.20 4799 AUC * 2.24 5277 1.13 4511 AUA 0.19 442 0.68 2704 Met AUG 1.00 3940 1 there are 27 optimal codons that end in a G (14/27) or C (13/27) there are three optimal codons (AGG, CGC, and CGG) encoding the amino acid Arg and two optimal codons each that encode Ala, Thr, Pro, Ser, Val, and Leu. the optimal codons of Aspergillus nidulans [40], Oryza sativa [41], Triticum aestivum [33], Zea mays [42], and other higher plant nuclear genomes end in G or C. this phenomenon may be related to their origin and relatives. the GC content for the total 4870 genes varies from 46.43% 5.80% (GC2) to 64.11% 10.16% (GC3). the greatest differences of GC content are found in GC2 (46.43% 5.80%) and GC3 (64.11% 10.16%), where most synoymous mutations occur. GC3 refers to the GC content in the third position. the solid line is the linear regression of GC12 against GC3, R2 = 0.0146, p 0.01. the neutrality plot shows that E. festucae genes exhibit a wide range of GC3 values, ranging from 21.82% to 91.67%. most genes appear in the 0.0\u20130.1 range, suggesting that most observed ENC values are smaller than the expected values based on the GC3s. mutation plays a role in shaping codon usage in E. festucae. if a particular gene is under selective pressure for high expression, its ENC value will deviate more strongly from the expected value. the translation efficiency constrains codon choice, which the frequency of codon usage is positively correlated with tRNA availability. the degree of codon usage bias is related to the level of gene expression. NC values were significantly positively correlated with the first axis (r = 0.836, p 0.01) and the second axis (r = 0.193, p 0.01) values, but were significantly negatively correlated with the GC3s (r = 0.808, p > 0.01) this suggests that ENC may be the main factor shaping codon bias in E. festucae. 63 ** AROMO 0.040 ** 0.195 ** 0.412 ** 0.317 ** 0.130 ** 0.106 ** 0.106 ** 0.129 ** 0.028 0.163 ** 0.004 0.420 ** ENC 0.227 ** 0.673 ** 0.211 ** 0.008 0.799 ** 0.808 ** 0.786 ** 0.608 ** 0.807 ** 0.252 ** 0.164 ** 0.034 * CAI 0.024 0.108 ** 0.015 0.193 ** 0.265 ** the CAI was negatively correlated with the first and second axis and with other nucleotide composition indices (gene length, GC1, GC2, A3s, G3s, and ENC) both nucleotide composition and gene expression level are major factors shaping codon usage bias in E. festucae. 420, p 0.01) and were negatively correlated with all four axes. the most important factor in the amino-acid usage is hydrophobicity, followed by CAI and aromaticity. this provides strong evidence for the inference that selection for translational efficiency exists in E. festucae. some researchers put forward research that ignore the composition of amino acids in the genome. Optimal codons in E. festucae We found that E. festucae exhibits weak codon biases based on the RSCU values of the 61 sense codons. most frequent codons ended in a G or C, such as leu and Gly. the total putative optimal codons of E. festucae are presented in Table 5. There is the synonymous codon of each amino acid. behind the corresponding codons are the RSCU values and codon numbers with corresponding \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d expression date dataset. o Acid Codon High RSCU N Low RSCU N Phe UUU 0.41 1246 0.97 4176 UUC * 1.59 4874 1.03 4414 Leu UUA 0.03 86 0.54 2081 UUG 0.55 1375 1.27 4893 CUU 0.29 744 1.22 4713 CUC * 2.90 7320 1.10 4257 CUA 0.14 358 0.71 2725 CUG * 2.08 5252 1.16 4456 Ile AUU 0.57 1339 the optimal codons are indicated with a (*) there are 27 optimal codons that end in a G (14/27) or C (13/27). there are three optimal codons (AGG, CGC, and CGG) encoding the amino acid Arg. codon preferences of E. festucae were more biased than those of A. thaliana, E. coli, or Caenorhabditis elegans. no complete Epichlo sp. mitochondrial genome is available in GenBank. the complete genome sequences of E. festucae (E2368, version 4) were obtained from Genome Projects at University of Kentucky [46]. each CDS had to be greater than 300 nucleotides in length; and duplicated sequences were detected and excluded from the dataset. effective number of codons (ENC) value, ranging from 0 to 1.0, is used to measure the magnitude of codon bias in individual genes. effective number of codons (ENC) value, ranging from 20 to 61, is used to measure the magnitude of codon bias in individual genes. it is also a measure of the unevenness of use of codons across all amino acids in a protein. values of ENC were always within the range from 20 (only one codon effectively used for each amino acid) to 61 (codons used randomly) the expected ENC values were calculated as follows [30]: ENCexp = 2 + S + (29/(S2 +(1 S2)) where S is the frequency of G + C (i.e., GC3s) the degrees of freedom were reduced to 40 after removing variations caused by the unequal usage of amino acids. 3.7. Statistical Analysis Correlations between codon usage and various indices were carried out using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) effective number of codons (ENC) value, ranging from 20 to 61, is used to measure the magnitude of codon bias in individual genes. if all codons for each amino acid were used equally, the ENC would be 61, while if a single codon was used for each amino acid, the ENC would be 20 [30] the expected ENC values were calculated as follows [30]: ENCexp = 2 + S + (29/(S2 +(1 S2)) where S is the frequency of G + C (i.e., GC3s) the independent optimal codon index can be used as a standard to distinguish between strong and weak translation-coupled biases in datasets. 3.7. Statistical Analysis Correlations between codon usage and various indices were carried out using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) effects were corrected for multiple testing with a Tukey-Kramer test, with p 0.01 and p 0.05 as significance levels."}
