{"summary": "the first known MERS-CoV outbreak in humans, diagnosed retrospectively, occurred in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. the dromedary camel has been identified as the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV. direct evidence for zoonotic transmission from camels has been reported in KSA and Qatar. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer and used to PCR amplify the MERS-CoV spike S2 domain (nucleotides 23781\u201324395 of HCoV-EMC/2012) sequences were assembled on SeqMan Pro and analyzed on MegAlign (DNASTAR) shedding dromedary camels detected by upE and ORF1A qRT-PCR assay. ELISA ratio was calculated by dividing the OD of each serum sample by a constant positive sample on the ELISA plate. twenty-three camels sampled from the bedouin herd in Azraq ranged in age from 4 months to 8 years. 22 camels sampled at the farm in Ramtha ranged in age from 4 months to 3 years 0 1 0.35 35 5M Ramtha 1 92 109 1 0.29 06 6M Azraq 1 81 264 1 0.29 06 6M Azraq 1 81 264 1 0.30 17 6M Azraq 1 188 174 1 1.27 24 6M Ramtha 0 1 1.43 34 6M Ramtha 0 1 1.43 34 6M Ramtha 0 1 1.43 37 6M Ramtha 1 2729 1256 1 0.30 10 7 RNA from 42/45 camels was tested positive for the presence of MERS-CoV nucleic acid. urogenital and rectal swab samples were negative. only 1/7 camels older than 3 years was positive for viral RNA. phylogenetic analysis of partial S2 sequences placed novel Jordanian viruses within the B1 cluster representing contemporary camel and human MERS-CoVs. three sequences were identical to spike S2 sequences of human isolates of MERS-CoV obtained in 2015. a maximum likelihood tree was generated from a spike S2 domain genome fragment. the newly identified MERS-CoV sequences are depicted in bold. bootstrap values of 50 were not shown. only 4/16 animals with an ELISA ratio of 1.1 were positive for viral RNA in nasal swabs. 20/34 seropositive dromedary camels were MERS-CoV viral RNA positive versus all (8/8) seronegative dromedary camels. this might indicate that sterile immunity is only reached at high levels of antibody titers. edward et al."}
