{"summary": "transmission studies incorporate features such as droplet size, coughing, sneezing and virus load. evolution and the big conundrum as to why one virus, or one strain, goes pandemic, while another doesn't. virology came to them as established global diseases. the spring of 2009 saw a series of cases of H1N1 human influenza in Mexico. the specter of a pandemic caused by the so-called swine flu shocked scientists and health officials worldwide. up to then, the general feeling was that the next pandemic virus would emerge from Southeast Asia, so a central American epicentre foxed everyone. in the past humans have been plagued by H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. other avian influenza viruses cross over to humans. they can come from poultry, such as H5N1 or H7N7. a novel avian influenza A virus could mutate into a robust human-transmissible virus sparking a pandemic. rabies, hendra, nipah and hantaviruses are small fry. the virus dies out in what is called a dead-end infection. essentially all dead-end infections \u2013 took everyone by surprise. nobody predicted the SARS or MERS-coronavirus outbreaks. the latter was clearly accompanied by human-to-human transmission. the latter seems to result mostly in dead-end infections. a selection screen will give you what you are looking for, provided the initial mutant population is large enough. if animals with asymptomatic infections are chosen, the resulting virus will be a highly transmissible and pathogenic virus with low pathogenic potential. a spectacular molecular example is the recovery of ribozymes from pools of random RNA molecules. influenza GOF experiments are unfalsifiable, but common sense suggests it should stop. adaptation of an avian influenza virus to human cells might \u2013 and probably would \u2013 impact antigenicity. vaccine makers consider there is little in this influenza GOF research that will help them develop more effective vaccines. there are more viruses on the planet than cells (aka bacteria) their genomes range from 2 to 240 kb for mammalian viruses and up to 2.5 Mb for viruses that prey on unicellular eukaryotes. if non-human mammalian, avian and insect-borne viruses are factored in as springboards to humans, the number that could possibly cross over is essentially limitless. scientists are generally upbeat about their work yet notoriously underestimate risk. the more groups performing GOF virology, the greater the overall risk. the big unknown of course is whether an escaped GOF influenza virus, or any other virus, would set off a pandemic. a virus of lower pathogenicity but higher transmissibility has greater impact on humanity than a highly pathogenic, but poorly transmissible virus. virology may well be just one small step for virology; the problem is it's a giant risk for mankind."}
