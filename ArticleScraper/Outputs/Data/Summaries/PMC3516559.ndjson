{"summary": "HCV is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae (genus Hepacivirus) the viral genome, 9.6 kb in length, is an uncapped linear molecule that contains a single open reading frame (ORF) the resulting polyprotein is co- and post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 different proteins that are required for RNA replication and virion formation. subgenomic RNAs (replicons) composed of only the NTRs and the region encoding for these replicase proteins are capable of autonomous replication in the human hepatoma cell line Huh7. a common feature of all positive-strand RNA viruses is the remodeling of intracellular membranes creating mini-organelles where RNA amplification and eventually also virion assembly take place. membrane rearrangements with a \u2018membranous web\u2019 (MW)-like appearance [18], [19] were originally detected in cells over-expressing the viral polyprotein, or only NS4B. a recent study suggests that the predominant structures within the MW are DMVs and less frequently, multivesicular membranes [20]. however, the 3D architecture of the MW and its biogenesis are not known. lysosomes, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and others were analyzed. only values higher than 0.5 were considered as colocalization. all examined HCV proteins colocalized with PDI, a marker for the rough ER. membrane alterations induced by HCV originate from the ER, but contain in addition membranes derived from other subcellular compartments such as early and late endosomes. the MW contains mitochondrial membranes and LDs, the latter playing an important role in HCV assembly. n.a., not applicable owing to incompatible antibodies. n.a. not applicable owing to incompatible antibodies. hoh7 cells were infected with HCV (strain Jc1) using 30 TCID50/cell. 48 h later cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy. samples were analyzed with a microscope at 60 magnification. correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) used a replication-competent subgenomic replicon containing a GFP-tagged NS5A [23]. Relevant fluorescent structures were allocated by fluorescence microscopy of live cells grown on patterned sapphire discs. cells were immediately processed for EM. the cell boxed in panel Ab overlapped with the fluorescence image. areas marked with a green dotted line indicate regions of intense fluorescence. the EM image represents one 60 nm ultrathin section of the same cell. Huh7.5 cells were infected with the highly assembly-competent HCV genome Jc1 [24] cells were fixed 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h post-infection (hpi) no virus-specific alterations of intracellular membranes were detected. at 16 hpi vesicles with two clearly distinguishable and closely apposed membrane bilayers were observed only in infected cells and these DMVs were the predominant structures. a local confined accumulation of membranous vesicles originally referred to as MW was rarely observed when using HPF-FS of HCV-infected or replicon-containing cells. a local confined accumulation of membranous vesicles originally referred to as MW was rarely observed when using HPF-FS of HCV-infected cells. immunolabeling of thawed cryo-sections failed in case of HCV-infected cells. membranes were no longer detectable and the cytoplasm appeared full of holes. membrane preservation was increased when cells were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide (osO4) [25], resulting in a much better overall structure preservation. TCID50/cell of Jc1 fixed 16 h post-infection with 0.1% OsO4. both NS5A and NS3 localize predominantly to the ER (b and d) and 50\u201370 nm diameter single-membrane vesicles (SMVs; subpanela, c and d) irrespective of OsO4 post-fixation the structures most abundantly labelled by both NS5A- and NS3-specific antibodies were the rER and small vesicles. in uninfected cells we detected only background labeling (Figure 4C). however, attempts to localize double-strand (ds) RNA by immuno-EM using a dsRNA-specific antibody were ambiguous. HCV-specific antigen labeling resided at the ER and at small SMVs. DMVs were labeled with only low efficiency for HCV protein and dsRNA. these results are consistent with the important role of the ER for MW formation. kinetics of RNA amplification correlated with membrane alterations. at 16 hpi only 50 DMVs were detected per cell section. this number increased 6-fold during the following 8 h. the striking correlation between the kinetics of viral RNA amplification and DMV formation suggests that DMVs might play an important role for HCV RNA replication. electron tomography identifies DMVs as protrusions from the ER. the outer (cytosolic) membrane bilayer of a large fraction of DMVs were continuous with the ER membrane. the outer (cytosolic) membrane bilayer of a large fraction of DMVs were continuous with the ER membrane. 3D architecture of membrane rearrangements induced 16 h after HCV infection. Huh7.5 cells were infected with 100 TCID50/cell of Jc1. if DMVs would be sites of HCV RNA replication, viral replicase could either reside on the DMV surface. in the latter case one would expect that the vesicle would have a pore to allow entry of e.g. NTPs and exit of viral RNA progeny. we therefore studied DMV morphology in more detail by ET and 3D reconstructions. 3D architecture of membrane rearrangements induced 36 h after infection with 100 TCID50/cell of Jc1. note the extensive membrane reorganization and the appearance of MMVs predominating at late time points after infection. white star indicates a large MMV; due to its complexity only its middle part could be rendered. omic replicons encoding NS2 to 5B or NS3 to 5B polyprotein fragments were detectable resembling morphologically those found in HCV-infected cells. however, MMVs were virtually absent in replicon-transfected cells arguing that the structural proteins themselves or a stress response triggered by these proteins is the primary determinant for MMV formation. however, cells transfected with the NS2-5B re representative images show vesicular structures detected in cells transfected with constructs specified in the upper panels. whiskers represent minimum and maximum values; whiskers represent minimum and maximum values. expression of NS5B induced enlarged ER sacs with an average diameter of 370 nm (150 nm; n = 90) and occasional curvature (Figure 8H and I\u2013K). NS5A was the only protein inducing the formation of MWs. only values higher than 0.5 were considered as colocalization. all examined HCV proteins colocalized with PDI, a marker for the rough (r) ER. similar results were obtained with another rER marker protein: GRP94. MW contains mitochondrial membranes and LDs, the latter playing an important role in HCV assembly. cellular proteins viral proteins NS3 NS4B NS5A dsRNA 0.41 0.3 0.34 0.23 0.36 rough ER PDI 0.58 0.67 0.63 0.53 0.52 GRP94 0.72 0.58 0.74 0.54 0.43 smooth ER EH 0.34 n.a. 0.35 reticular subdomain of rough ER CLIMP-63 0.37 0. late endosomes Lamp-3 0.32 0.17 0.19 0.19 0.25 GFP-Rab7A 0.75 0.7 0.54 n.a. cells were infected with HCV (strain Jc1) using 30 TCID50/cell. 48 h later cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy. samples were analyzed with a Nikon TE2000-E inverted confocal microscope. highly fluorescent structures were allocated by fluorescence microscopy of live cells grown on patterned sapphire discs. highly fluorescent areas corresponded to accumulations of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) surrounding LDs. these structures were not observed in mock-infected cells, arguing for an HCV-specific phenotype. fluorescence image corresponds to the complete cell whereas EM image represents one 60 nm ultrathin section of the same cell. region 1 corresponds to a region corresponding to the intersection of high to low fluorescence (2). region 2 corresponds to a LD-enriched area containing DMVs in close proximity. cells were infected with the highly assembly-competent HCV genome Jc1 [24] cells were fixed 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h post-infection (hpi) no virus-specific alterations of intracellular membranes were detected. at 16 hpi vesicles with two clearly distinguishable and closely apposed membrane bilayers were observed only in infected cells and these DMVs were the predominant structures. a locally confined accumulation of membranous vesicles originally referred to as MW was rarely observed when using expression of HCV proteins. a localization of viral proteins to HCV-induced membrane structures was performed in order to stay consistent with the generally accepted nomenclature. thawed cryo-sections failed in case of HCV-infected cells. membranes were no longer detectable and the cytoplasm appeared full of holes. membrane preservation was increased when cells were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide (osO4). NS5A and NS3 localize predominantly to the ER (b and d) and 50\u201370 nm diameter single-membrane vesicles (SMVs; subpanel a, c and d) NS5A localizes to lipid droplets (e) irrespective of OsO4 post-fixation the structures most abundantly labelled by both NS5A- and NS3-specific antibodies were the rER and small vesicles. in uninfected cells we detected only background labeling. however, attempts to localize double-strand (ds) RNA by immuno-EM were ambiguous. kinetics of RNA amplification correlated with the kinetics of membrane alterations. amplification of intracellular HCV RNA became first detectable 16 hpi. this kinetic was corroborated when cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy to detect dsRNA and its colocalization with NS5A. in contrast, MMVs appeared in high abundance only after the exponential RNA amplification phase arguing that they are only of minor relevance for replication. the striking correlation between the kinetics of viral RNA amplification and DMV formation suggests that DMVs might play an important role for HCV RNA replication. electron tomography identifies DMVs as protrusions from the ER. the outer (cytosolic) membrane bilayer of a large fraction of DMVs were continuous with the ER membrane. this is exemplified by the consecutive snapshots and the 3D surface rendering of a tomogram generated from cells analyzed 16 hpi. cells were infected with 100 TCID50/cell of Jc1, fixed 16 h later. HPF-FS processed for ET as described in materials and methods. panel B, C and D are part of the tomogram displayed in panel A. most of the DMVs appeared as closed structure and only in a minority of cases (8%) an opening (\u2018pore\u2019) towards the cytosol was found. however, in a small fraction of DMVs an intermembrane space was observed. 3D architecture of membrane rearrangements induced 36 h after HCV infection. note the extensive membrane reorganization and the appearance of MMVs predominating at late time points after infection. black arrows show invaginations of DMVs. white star indicates a large MMV; due to its complexity only its middle part could be rendered. cells transfected with the NS2-5B replicon contained lower numbers of DMVs. the same membrane alterations were found upon expression of a NS3-5B polyprotein fragment lacking NS5B. this showed that formation of DMVs is induced by viral proteins independent from HCV RNA replication. however, formation of DMVs does not require this HCV protein. the number of vesicular structures per m2 is given; whiskers represent minimum and maximum values. the number of vesicular structures per m2 is given; whiskers represent minimum and maximum values. expression of NS5B induced enlarged ER sacs with an average diameter of 370 nm (150 nm; n = 90) and occasional curvature (Figure 8H and I\u2013K). none of the HCV proteins was capable on its own to induce formation of the MW, which requires the concerted action of two or more replicase proteins. NS5A and NS3 localize to distinct sites within the MW. a recent report described the detection of LC3-II at HCV-induced membranes arguing that formation of HCV replication sites is linked to autophagy. but the role of autophagy in the HCV replication cycle is a matter of controversy. NS4B forms a complex with Rab 5 and Vps34 and induces autophagy [49]. it is therefore tempting to speculate that proteins of the autophagy machinery induce formation of DMVs. we assume that NS5A plays a key role in biogenesis of membrane rearrangements. cells containing a stably replicating genotype 1b replicon thereby excluding genotype-specific effects. cells infected with low MOI and harvested at different time points after infection. each HCV replicase factor induced distinct membrane alterations. no membrane alterations were detected in cells over-expressing NS5A or NS5B. the reason why such vesicles have not been observed by Egger and co-workers in cells expressing only NS5A is not known. in one scenario, HCV proteins might provoke membrane invaginations into the ER. such invaginations might enlarge and reach the opposite ER membrane, thus leading to pairing of both lipid bilayers and DMV formation. hypothetical models describing the formation of double membrane vesicles and their possible role in viral RNA replication. enzymatically active HCV replicase (green dots) reside in the lumen of the invagination. extensive invagination leads to a local \u2018shrinking\u2019 of the ER lumen. dsRNA-specific antibody is not sufficient, because this method does not discriminate between active and inactive, dsRNA-containing replication complexes. it might also detect viral RNA genomes containing secondary (ds) structures and engaged e.g. in RNA translation or virion assembly. several attempts to detect newly synthesized HCV RNA by IF- or EM-based methods were not successful. the exact site of HCV RNA replication within the MW remains to be determined. a common denominator of all positive-strand RNA viruses is the induction of membranous replication compartments that provide a physical scaffold for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. poliovirus extensively reorganizes membranes originating from components of the anterograde membrane traffic system. this gives rise to 50\u2013400 nm single and double-membrane vesicles forming a complex meshwork [56], [57]. morphological similarities also exist between the MW and the replication compartment of arteriviruses. the main component of the MW is membranes derived from the ER. we detected markers of early and late endosomes, COP vesicles, mitochondria and LDs. these results support earlier studies showing the association of the MW with ER membranes and LDs [19], [31], [32]. autophagy has been shown to play a major role for the replication of several positive-strand RNA viruses such as poliovirus [44], [45], coronaviruses [46] or dengue virus [47] it is well possible that individual factors of the autophagy pathway, rather than the complete machinery, are involved in the formation of the MW. the predominant membranous structures detected in HCV-infected cells were DMVs. these structures as well as MMVs were not an artifact caused by the used methods because they were consistently detected under the following conditions. these structures were not an artifact caused by the used methods. no membrane alterations were detected in cells over-expressing NS5A or NS5B. these contiguous vesicles were of irregular shape and their membranes were in very close contact in a way that the two lipid bilayers were often fused into a trilayer. the reason why such vesicles have not been observed by egger and co-workers in cells expressing only NS5A is not known. in this model, DMVs with a \u2018pore\u2019 might represent intermediates that are (still) actively involved in RNA replication, whereas later on when DMVs become completely sealed, they would represent remnants that are no longer actively engaged in the RNA amplification process. a compact structure might also shield HCV proteins and RNA from detection by antibodies. a direct demonstration of the HCV replication site will require the unequivocal detection of newly synthesized RNA. several attempts to detect newly synthesized HCV RNA by IF- or EM-based methods were not successful. this included transfection of infected cells with 5-bromouridine 5\u2032-triphosphate. some approaches allowed detection of newly synthesized dengue virus RNA that replicates to much higher levels in an easy to access ER-derived membrane compartment. labeling of the ER is consistent with its role as primary source of the MW. however, the role of SMVs in the HCV replication cycle is unknown. spherule-containing vesicles are internalized and fuse with acidic endosomes. structures induced by these viruses are composed of mixtures of convoluted membranes and large (200\u2013400 nm) DMVs. similar observations have been made for another flavivirus, the west Nile virus. morphological similarities exist between the MW of HCV and the replication compartment of arteriviruses. biogenesis and morphology of the MW reveals an unexpected similarity to distantly related picornaviruses, coronaviruses and arteriviruses. pTM-based expression plasmids pFK-J6/C3 (Jc1), pFK-I389-neo-sg-JFH1, pFK-I389-Luc-NS2-3\u2032_JFH_g, pFK-I389Luc-NS3-3\u2032_JFH_g,

Wohlwend GmbH, Sennwald, Switzerland) that had been carbon coated to improve cell adhesion. at different time points after infection (Jc1, 100 TCID50/cell) or electroporation of HCV RNA (10 g) cells were fixed with 4% PFA, 0.1% GA in Na-cacodylate buffer [pH 7.4] and immunolabeling of thawed cryo-sections Infected cells were fixed by adding an equal amount of 8% PFA and 0.2% GA in 0.2 M PHEM buffer. cells were then fixed for 1 h with 4% PFA, 0.1% GA and 1% Acrolein in 0.1 M PHEM until further processing. sections were incubated in 30 mM glycine in 0.1 PHEM for 10 min. sections were then incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. grids were stained with 3% UA for 10 min at room temperature. cells were seeded onto sapphire discs. nm thick serial sections were collected on formvar-coated slot grids. EM micrographs of GFP-positive areas were acquired at different magnifications. protein A-gold (10 nm) was added to both sides as fiducial markers. mitochondria were staining using MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) cell culture for virus production, infection assays and electroporation of HCV-RNA. the cell clone Huh7.5 is highly permissive for HCV RNA replication. pFK-I389-Luc-NS2-3\u2032_JFH_g, pFK-I389Luc-NS3-3\u2032_JFH_g, pFKi389Luc-NS3-3\u2032_dg_JFH-1_NS5Aaa2359_emGFP and the full-length genome pFK-JFH-g have been described elsewhere. pTM vectors allowing expression of JFH1-derived polyprotein fragments or individual proteins were transfected by using the effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) twenty-four hours later cells were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy and inoculated with 30 TCID50/cell of Jc1. serial dilutions of a standard RNA (108 to 102 HCV RNA copies per reaction) were processed in parallel to determine absolute RNA amounts. dilutions were performed on a PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System. cell washed with PBS and water, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, USA) and sealed with nail polish. images were merged using the ImageJ software package (National Institutes of Health) infected cells were scraped off the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20% dextran, subject to HPF-FS. infected cells were fixed by adding an equal amount of 8% PFA and 0.2% GA in 0.2 M PHEM buffer. cells were then fixed for 1 h with 4% PFA, 0.1% GA and 1% Acrolein in 0.1 M PHEM. cell pellets were mounted onto sample holder pins, frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. 60 nm cryo-sections were prepared using a leica Ultracut UC6 microtome. sections were molten by floating on 2% gelatine for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. in vitro transcripts derived from the subgenomic replicon construct pFKi389LucNS3-3\u2032_dg_JFH-1_NS5Aaa2359_emGFP [27] were seeded onto sapphire discs (M.

HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells grown on sapphire discs were subjected to chemical fixation and subsequent HPF-FS as described in materials and methods. epon embedding showed a diameter of 186 nm (25 nm; n = 30) this is most likely due to dehydration of the cell occurring during sample preparation. two different labeling experiments were considered. 100 gold clusters were counted per grid and allocated to subcellular sites specified in the bottom. Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected by electroporation with a subgenomic JFH1 replicon RNA and subjected directly to HPF-FS without chemical fixation. the high abundance of DMVs also in these native samples excluding that DMVs are an artifact caused by chemical fixation. colored overlay shows a 3D surface model of virus-induced membranes.
