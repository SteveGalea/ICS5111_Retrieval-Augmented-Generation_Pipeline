{"summary": "the time window for the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is less than 6 hours once the symptoms are recognized. every hour of delay in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy increases the mortality by 7.6% in patients with septic shock. there is an urgent need to improve diagnostic tools for a better management of septic patients. identification of pathogen can be achieved within 30 minutes directly from a positive blood culture. this technology relies on culture and, therefore, a median of 12- to 17-hour delay is unavoidable. a single-pathogen approach is not useful for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections. the PCR/ESI-MS technology combines broad-range PCR amplification with the electrospray-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. a new version of the instrument is presented that has been designed to improve the sensitivity and implementation in the clinical laboratory. the time-to-result using this approach is 4.5\u20136 hours. this assay has been widely evaluated in the clinical setting. but the results are conflicting with reported sensitivities ranging from 15% to 98% in ICU patients. the time-to-result of this assay is 8 hours. microbial DNA from 5 mL of blood is enriched. human DNA is depleted during the extraction step. SeptiFast is a multiplex real-time PCR assay that detects 25 pathogens including five Candida species and Aspergillus fumigatus. the presence of the resistance gene mecA may be detected with a separate test. the region amplified in this assay is the internal transcribed spacer region (IST) the largest study (N = 342) [16] reported a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0% and 85.8%. two smaller studies reported lower values of sensitivity of 46.0% (N = 50) [25] and 37.5% (N = 75) [26] and 86.6% [26]. a real-time PCR is then carried out in a screening step for identification of the group or genera level of pathogens present. identification of 21 bacterial species, five Candida species, and Aspergillus fumigatus is possible. sensitivity and specificity were reported to be 65.0% and 92.0% respectively. amplification of conserved regions of the genome has been widely used for the identification of microorganisms at the species level. several housekeeping genes (i.e., tufB, rplB, valsS, and rpoB) are also useful for the identification of pathogens. a base composition for each amplicon based on mass, compares these to an extensive database, and achieves the identification of the pathogen. a synthetic standard is added to each PCR well at a known copy number. the internal standard serves as PCR positive control to exclude PCR inhibition. the agreement between blood culture followed by biochemical identification and PCR/ESI-MS was good in both studies. 77.1% in the Jordana-Lluch et al. study [21] and 78.6% in the Laffler et al. study [22]. polymicrobial infections were detected in both studies. the estimated sensitivity of PCR/ESI-MS using this theoretical approach was 85.9%. this extrapolation may have led to biased estimation of the sensitivity. the new version of PCR/ESI-MS technology uses higher volumes of whole blood reducing the limit of detection 4-5-fold. the PLEX-ID was intended to be used in health and industry settings. it provided highly sensitive detection without the need for a highly trained operator. a newer version has been developed with improvements focused on the analysis of direct specimens. a PCR/ESI-MS assay is able to differentiate species in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and classify these species based on drug resistance. a total of 76 clinical specimens including swabs, blood cultures, and swabs were investigated. new version of the Viral IC assay designed for the diagnosis of opportunistic viral infections of immunocompromised patients by viruses such as Herpesvirus, Adenovirus, Parvovirus, Picornavirus, and polyomavirus. the ability of the assays on the PCR/ESI-MS system to detect influenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, vector-borne a broad bacteria and Candida detection assay has been designed for use in clinical research to identify more than 600 bacteria and Candida species. the BAC assay also detects resistance genes for three clinically relevant antibiotics: methicillin (mecA), vancomycin (vanA and vanB), and carbapenem (blaKPC). BAC assay includes thirteen pairs of primers targeting different conserved regions. redundancy of coverage across various primer pairs is especially relevant when different microorganisms are present in different abundances. amplification also prevents missed detections due to mismatches. the accuracy of BAC assay for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections was first evaluated on blood culture specimens. PCR/ESI-MS has been optimized to achieve a rapid diagnosis from direct clinical specimens. the agreement between blood culture followed by biochemical identification and PCR/ESI-MS was good. a number of cases in both studies, PCR/ESI-MS detected microorganisms in whole blood specimens with a paired positive blood culture. the sensitivity of the system was calculated using different approaches in each study. the estimated sensitivity of the PCR/ESI-MS was 85.9%. the new version of the PCR/ESI-MS technology has been continuously evolving. the PCR/ESI-MS technology uses higher volumes of whole blood reducing the limit of detection 4-5-fold. a newer version of the technology has been developed with improvements focused on the analysis of direct patient specimens. the mass spectrometer is a bench-top instrument, facilitating installation in clinical laboratories. preliminary evaluation of this new version has shown a better sensitivity in the detection of pathogens. further evaluations are currently underway. a new version of the Viral IC assay designed for the diagnosis of opportunistic viral infections of immunocompromised patients by viruses such as Herpesvirus, Adenovirus, Parvovirus, Picornavirus, and polyomavirus. the new version of the Viral IC assay designed for the diagnosis of opportunistic viral infections of immunocompromised patients. a new assay for the PCR/ESI-MS systems has been validated for detection of aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Pneumocystis spp., Cryptococcus spp., Mucor spp., and Rhizopus spp. a significant percentage of blood cultures are negative despite the high likelihood of a bacterial or fungal infection. the new presentation of the technology has been improved in several aspects that significantly enhance sensitivity. the main advantage of this technology is that it can be used on direct patient specimens, avoiding the culture step."}
