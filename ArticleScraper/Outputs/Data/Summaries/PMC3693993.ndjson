{"summary": "there is an ongoing debate and limited evidence on the use of masks and respirators in health care workers (HCWs) there are significant variations in the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and TB. the lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks remains a policy gap. medical masks and respirators are commonly used to protect HCWs from respiratory infections. masks are not designed to provide respiratory protection, as they have consistently lower filtration efficiency than respirators. high-income countries have established infection control programs. study aimed to examine available policies and guidelines for use of masks and respirator for HCWs, for the prevention of influenza, SARS and TB. guidelines from two large public health organizations, three high-income countries and six low/middle income countries were purposely selected for inclusion in this study. a key word search was conducted using Google, with 10 results per page set and the first two pages of hits reviewed. policies and guidelines were also searched in the native languages of the selected countries through advance search settings in Google. key personal contacts in the selected countries were contacted in regards to the availability of guidelines in the country. high risk situations described in TB guidelines: exposure to drugs resistant organism; culture/DST and other high risk procedures in laboratory, high risk areas. a key word search was conducted using Google, with 10 results per page set and the first two pages of hits reviewed. policies and guideline documents were also searched for using Medline, Embase, National Guidelines Clearinghouse, and Google Scholar through key words. key personal contacts in the selected countries were contacted in regards to the availability of guidelines in the country. the WHO, the CDC and most of the countries recommend masks and/or respirator on the basis of the mode of transmission of influenza, SARS and TB. only a few mentioned that a single mask could be used for 4 hours [10], 8 hours [11], or even for an entire shift [12]. the WHO, the CDC and most of the selected countries have the same policy for seasonal influenza, but they differ in their recommendations for pandemic influenza. the guidelines of the UK [22], Canada [23], Australia [4], China [11], India [18] and Pakistan [19] are align with those of the WHO. or equivalent respirator (e.g., PAPR, elastomeric or PAPR) Respirators (N95 or higher) UK [16,22,25,34] Mask (Surgical mask) Respirators (FFP3) Respirators (FFP3) PAPR use is discouraged Respirators (FFP3) PAPR use is discouraged Respirators (FFP3) PAPR use is discouraged Not recommended Respirators (FFP3) Canada [13,20,26,32] Mask ( the WHO and the CDC have different policies when coming in contact with a patient with SARS. the CDC and most of the countries prefer N95 or equivalent respirators in low risk situations in SARS, while the UK recommends a FFP3. the CDC also recommends elastomeric respirators in low risk situations. the seasonal influenza guidelines of china, Indonesia and Bangladesh, and TB guidelines of india, Indonesia and Bangladesh did not make clear recommendation on masks and respirator use. pandemic guidelines of india, Indonesia and Bangladesh did not make clear recommendation on masks and respirator use. the general term \u201crespirator\u201d is constantly used in the guidelines. products with various filtration capacities were recommended for the same diseases. a particular type of respirator recommended by one country was actually discouraged by another country. employers are required to provide respirators to employees for protection from respiratory hazards. the use of mask and respirator is not discussed in pandemic plans of some countries. only 33/76 (45%) of the national plans discuss the role of masks and respirators. droplet and contact are thought to be primary modes of transmission of SARS [65] but the use of respirators is highly recommended by the CDC and most of the countries in both low and high risk situations. the CDC maintains its position and continues to recommend a respirator [1] most of the low income countries recommended the use of respirators only when undertaking high risk procedures on patients with TB. only the recommendations from Canada, australia and china are aligned with the WHO and the CDC. the UK recommendations have not been amended since 1994. there is a lack of data to support or refute the effectiveness of woven cloth masks in blocking influenza or virus transmission and fluid resistance. there is no clinical trial data on the efficacy of cloth masks and most of the available studies are in-vitro [79-84] the situation may be different in these countries. for example, france recommends FFP2 and Austria recommends FFP3 for the HCWs in low and high risk situations during pandemics. policies of the european CDC are the same as those of the WHO. HS and CRM extensively reviewed the paper. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
