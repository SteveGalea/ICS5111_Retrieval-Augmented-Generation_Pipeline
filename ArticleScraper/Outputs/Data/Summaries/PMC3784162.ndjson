{"summary": "recognition of viral nucleic acids by intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) entails the early steps of the immune response elicited during viral infections. efforts have been made to define the role of TLR3 in the antiviral response. vants in vaccine therapy is based on the selective high expression of TLR3 in human CD141+ DCs and mouse CD8a+ DC subsets. emerging evidence suggests that TLR3 also mediates pathogenesis. this review provides background on the TLR3 pathway, highlights the negative regulation of TLR3 signalling by endogenous and virus-encoded proteins. two studies have reported a differential role for tyrosine kinases c-Src13 and epidermal growth factor receptor14 in mediating TLR3 phosphorylation. phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase have been implicated in TLR3 phosphorylation. NF-B activating kinase (NAK) -associated protein 1 mediates TRIF association with the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) together with TRAF family member-associated NF-B activator (TBK1) and IB kinase (IKK) complex. second branch drives the activation of NF-B and AP-1 and is mediated by the protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and the E evidence is emerging on the role of TRIF in cytosolic sensing of dsRNA. TRIF is also an adaptor in a branch of the TLR421 and perhaps the TLR2 pathways22 and modulates the TLR5 pathway by inducing proteolytic degradation. we discuss recent advances in the regulation of TRIF, TRAF3, RIP1 and TRAF6. we discuss recent advances in the regulation of TRIF, TRAF3, RIP1 and TRAF6. RIP3 Inhibition by competition Presence of RIP3 negatively regulates the TRIF-RIP1-induced NF-B pathway. TANK in unstimulated cells inhibits TRAF6 activation. TRIF is also involved in the TLR4, MyD88-dependent signalling pathway. adaptor translocating chain-associated factor 3 mediates TRIF recruitment. integrins may play a role in the regulation of some TLRs. LR3 and TLR4 signalling by a mechanism involving TRIF degradation has recently been identified. TRAF3 assembles Lys63 linked polyubiquitin chains and forms a protein complex with TBK1 and IKK. de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases that specifically cleave ubiquitin linkages, negating the action of ubiquitin ligases. TRIF inhibits TLR3- and Sendai virus-induced activation of IFN-sensitive response element and IFN- promoter. TRAF6 is negatively regulated by the DUB tumour suppressor cylindromatosis. it generates an autoregulatory loop that controls the immune response through TRAF6. ubiquitin-specific protease 4 plays an essential role in modulation of the TLR/IL-1R signalling-mediated innate immune response. the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner is a transcriptional co-repressor that regulates hepatic metabolic pathways. the mitochondrial NLRX1 protein interacts with TRAF6 and inhibits NF-B activation. TRIF NS3-4A HCV Inhibits both NF-B and IRF3 activation via its interaction with and cleavage of TRIF. 3CD HAV Inhibits both NF-B and IRF3 activation via its interaction with and cleavage of TRIF, leading to IFN-I inhibition. hepatitis C virus (HCV), 50 the hepatitis A virus (HAV) protease-polymerase processing intermediate (3CD),51 the 3C(pro) cysteine protease of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3),52 and the enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3C protease53 cleave TRIF and disrupt the TLR3 signalling. TRIM38 promotes K48-linked poly Vaccinia virus inhibits TLR3-induced NF-B activation by sequestering TRAF6 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-like 2 through interaction with the poxvirus protein A52R. findings provide evidence of the complex regulatory networks that viruses exploit to counteract the TLR3 signalling pathway. CD11b/Cbl-b activation TLR-triggered, active CD11b integrin engages in cross-talk with the MyD88 and TRIF pathways inhibiting TLR signalling. TRIM38 Ubiquitination K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRIF; down-regulation of the signalling cascade. TANK in unstimulated cells inhibits TRAF6 activation. pellino-3 Ubiquitination TRIF signalling induces Pellino3 expression, and inhibits the ability of TRAF6 to activate IRF7. a splice variant of TRAM, is an adaptor that negatively modulates TLR4\u2013TRAM signalling from endosomes by displacing TRIF. the integrin CD11b activates Syk and promotes degradation of TRIF via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b.33 Triad3A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates TLR3 signalling by degradation of the TIR domains ubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) selectively cleaves polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3 resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signalling complex. the negative role of MIP-T3 in the production of type I IFN by inhibition of TRAF3 complex formation is unique. RIP1 kinase is negatively regulated by RIP3, Triad3A and A20. cylindromatosis negatively regulates the TNF receptor-induced activation of NF-B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase by reversing ubiquitination of its target. TANK (also known as I-TRAF) has been identified as a TRAF-binding protein. the mitochondrial NLRX1 protein interacts with TRAF6 and inhibits NF-B activation. Upon TLR stimulation, NLRX1 dissociates from TRAF6 to allow its function. viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract cell responses against infection for their own benefit and diminish the immune response at multiple levels. a viral strategy to interfere with the TLR3 signalling pathway is to down-regulate the expression of the adaptor TRIF. some viral non-structural proteins with serine protease activity have been identified to target TRIF for proteolysis. a-associated herpesvirus mediates degradation of TRIF through proteasome pathway. TRIM38 promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NAP1 and TRIF. TRIM38 negatively regulates TLR3-mediated type I IFN signalling. e-like 2 through interaction with the poxvirus protein A52R.57 Taken together, these findings provide evidence of the complex regulatory networks that viruses exploit to counteract the TLR3 signalling pathway. the role of TLR3 in human immunity is still unknown, and our understanding is based mostly on studies using human primary or immortalized cells. immune complexes containing viral RNA may activate mesangial TLR3 during HCV infection, thereby contributing to chemokine/cyokine release. hepatocellular carcinoma Humans TLR3 polymorphisms are associated with acute-on-chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. a protective role of TLR3 in the central nervous system (CNS) has been suggested for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and influenza A virus (TBEV) -induced encephalitis in humans. children with a TLR3 polymorphism had increased risk of pneumonia. the role of TLR3 in pathogenesis of various viral infections has been studied in TLR3-deficient mice. TLR3 plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus type 1B (RV1B), vaccinia virus (VACV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and IAV in the lung. TLR3 is the only TLR that has been shown to play a non-redundant role for protection against HSV-1 infection in the CNS. a genetic evaluation of TLR3 identified the wild-type TLR3 rs3775291 allele to be a risk factor in tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. a link has been reported between the TLR3 pathway and induction of glomerulonephritis in patients with chronic HCV infection. glomerulonephritis is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidneys. a common TLR3 allele confers immunologically mediated protection from HIV-1. a common TLR3 allele confers immunologically mediated protection from HIV-1. however, extreme caution is advised because TLR3 may also make a detrimental contribution of TLR3 in HIV-1-induced pathogenesis. the role of human TLR3 in protection against herpes simplex encephalitis is unique. this finding correlated the deficiency of TLR3 with the encephalopathy induced by IAV. a genetic evaluation of TLR3 identified the wild-type TLR3 rs3775291 allele as a risk factor in tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. some TLR3 polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure. there is a close relationship between the presence of TLR3 rs5743313/CT polymorphism and an increased risk of pneumonia in children infected by the pandemic. a common TLR3 allele confers immunologically mediated protection from HIV-1. this suggests that triggering of TLR3 with specific ligands could have therapeutic potential against HIV-1 infection in humans. however, extreme caution is advised because TLR3 may also make a detrimental contribution of TLR3 in HIV-1-induced pathogenesis. T3 reovirus CNS Encephalitis i.cb. or i.c. C57BL/6 B129 No differences in CNS injury; survival and viral load were not determined. TEMV strains BeAn and GDVII CNS Encephalitis, Demyelination Hemisphere. RV1B Lung chronic inflammatory disease of the airways (asthma) intranasal C57BL/6J Detrimental role: reduced lung inflammatory responses and airways responsiveness. TLR3 initiates pro-inflammatory signalling pathways leading to airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. phenotype rescued by WT NOD macrophages. EMCV, myocarditic variant Heart Myocarditis intraperitoneal C57BL/6J Protective role: lower survival rate, lower viral load in serum, and less pro-inflammatory response in liver and serum. contrasting results on role of pattern recognition receptors in vitro and in vivo have been reported for some viruses. contrasting results on the role of pattern recognition receptors in vitro and in vivo have been reported for some viruses. herpes simplex virus 1 is a major cause of encephalitis, whereas HSV-2 can give rise to meningitis, encephalitis, sacral radiculitis and myelitis in humans. the role of TLR3 in herpes simplex encephalitis has been recently studied in the mouse model using the HSV-2 strain. bations and can be studied in vivo by using the rhinovirus type 1 RV1B strain. mice showed reduced lung inflammatory responses and reduced airway responsiveness. in the absence of TLR3, IAV-infected mice had increased survival rates. recombinant strain Western Reserve vaccinia virus expresses firefly luciferase. mice lacking TLR3 had reduced disease morbidity and lung inflammation. mice lacking TLR3 also had lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. TLR3-deficient mice developed an IL-4-dominant Th2 response during acute coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis with elevated markers of alternative activation. disease was significantly worse in TRIF- or TRIF-deficient mice. this is the first report in the literature to demonstrate a differential role of TRIF and TLR3 in a mouse model of viral pathogenesis. poliovirus and phlevovirus are not strictly hepatotropic and induce multi-organ pathogenesis. however, mice lacking TLR3 expression developed higher viral load in the liver and increased mortality compared with their controls. TLR3-deficient mice showed increased resistance to lethal infection. the role of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis does not exhibit a differential trend among ssRNA, dsRNA and DNA viruses. the detrimental contribution of the TLR3 pathway in autoimmune hepatitis through activation of certain cytokines and chemokines involved in migration to the liver is remarkable. theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Picornaviridae, positive-sense ssRNA), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Herpesviridae, segmented dsRNA) and T3 reovirus (Reoviridae, segmented dsRNA) is separated from the rest of the body by the blood\u2013brain barrier. the cerebrospinal fluid is also separated from the pe the role of TLR3-mediated signalling in the protection and pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease is intriguing and warrants further investigation. this case, activation of TLR3-mediated signalling during viral infection leads to pathogenic immune response. the role of TLR3 in reovirus-induced neuropathogenesis has been addressed using the T3 reovirus strain Dearing (T3D) no differences were observed in CNS injury, viral loads, and mortality in TLR3-deficient compared with wild-type mice. dsRNA induces similar pulmonary dysfunctions to respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice. dsRNA induces nucleotide/P2Y purinergic receptor-mediated impairment of alveolar fluid clearance. mice that are TLR3-deficient have been shown to be highly susceptible to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)90,91 and coxsackieviruses B3 and B492\u201394 infections. these viruses induce cardiac injury or diabetes depending on the virus strain. lack of TLR3 leads to impaired expression of pro-inflammatory response in the heart and the liver of mice infected with EMCV. new evidence demonstrates the existence of a new branch of TLR3 signalling that does not lead to gene induction but affects many cellular properties. the adaptor proteins TRIF and MyD88 were not required for this effect of the new pathway. non-specific activation of innate immunity can drastically enhance susceptibility to immune destruction of the liver through a TLR3-mediated mechanism. non-specific activation of innate immunity can drastically enhance susceptibility to immune destruction of the liver through activation of TLR3.97. a detrimental contribution of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis is emerging from studies in the mouse and in certain viral infections in humans. a working model of the role of TLR3 in antiviral (protective) and immunoregulatory (detrimental) responses is shown in Fig. 2. despite the detrimental role of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis being poorly understood, three major mechanisms have been identified. the precise molecular mechanisms that lead to TLR3 hyper-responsiveness are unknown. the precise molecular mechanisms that lead to TLR3 hyper-responsiveness are unknown. TLR3 hyper-responsiveness may play a detrimental role in virus-triggered autoimmunity. a single viral pathogen conventionally defined as Th1-inducing bears a variety of ligands capable of engaging multiple TLRs that can also stimulate a Th2 response. LR3\u2013TRIF axis may play important roles in determining how the balance between antiviral and immunoregulatory pathways affect protective versus detrimental responses. challenge is to identify TLR3-dependent, TRIF-independent pathways, and their contributions."}
