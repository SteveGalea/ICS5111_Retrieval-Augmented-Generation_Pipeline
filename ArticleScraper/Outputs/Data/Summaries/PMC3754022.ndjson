{"summary": "mRNA has a 5\u2032 cap structure, in which the guanosine residue is methylated at the ribose 2\u2032-O position. the 5\u2032 cap structure is known to be responsible for the stability and efficient translation of mRNA (1, 2). human and human genes are clustered in loci on chromosomes 19C1 and 10q23, respectively (20) IFIT family proteins reportedly associate with several host proteins to exert various cellular functions (21, 22) human IFIT1/IFIT2 and murine Ifit1/Ifit2 bind to eukaryotic translational initiation factor 3 (eIF3) subunits to inhibit translation (23\u201326) Ifit1 was found to preferentially interact with 5\u2032 capped mRNA without 2\u2032-O methylation and inhibit its translation. all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines of the animal care and use committee of the Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University. MEFs were prepared from wild-type (WT) and Ifit1/ day 14.5 embryos. plasmid encoding the simian virus 40 large T antigen. cDNA of Ifit1 was cloned into pMRX-puro (pMRX/Ifit1) pMWJEATG1/JEV K61A mutant was generated from pMWJEATG1/JEV K61A. RNA accumulations in the culture supernatants were determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. the 5\u2032-terminal 200 nucleotides of the JEV genome were amplified by PCR. 32P-labeled m7GpppA-RNA substrate was prepared with a ScriptCap m7G capping system in the presence of a ScriptCap vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase. a 5\u2032 OH-RNA substrate was produced by incubating in vitro-transcribed RNA with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. luc2, 5\u2032-CCATTCTACCCACTCGAAGACG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGTAGGTAATGTCCACCTCGA-3\u2032. wild-type and K61A mutant JEV N-terminal NS5 (MTase domain) cDNAs were obtained by PCR using pMWATG1 with the primers 5\u2032-GGATCCGGAAGGGGCAGGACGCTA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTCGTAATGTCCACCTCGA-3\u2032 RNA was purified by passage through a postreaction cleanup column (Sigma) and digested with 10 U of nuclease P1 (Wako) in 50 mM sodium acetate overnight at 37\u00b0C. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a lightShift chemiluminescent RNA EMSA kit. the separated RNAs were transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. the membrane was incubated with stabilized streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:300 dilution; a component of the EMSA kit) the bound stable peroxide was detected with luminol/enhancer solution (another component of the EMSA kit). stably expressing Flag-tagged Ifit1 were infected with JEV at an MOI of 1.0 and cultured for 24 h. cells were then lysed in 500 l of RNA buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 0.1 g/l of yeast tRNA (Ambion), 1 tablet/10 ml luciferase mRNAs were transfected with 1,000 U/ml of universal type I interferon for 6 h. three types of modified luciferase mRNAs were transfected using the lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at 6 h after the transfection, RNA was isolated and analyzed. a herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (tk) gene was inserted into the 3\u2032 end of the vector. a ES cell clone correctly targeting Ifit1 was microinjected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 ml of 4% thioglycolate medium (Sigma) mice were isolated from the peritoneal cavity at 3 days postinjection. the cells were incubated for 2 h and then washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution. the 5\u2032-terminal 200 nucleotides of the JEV genome were amplified by PCR using pMWATG1 (37) with the primers 5\u2032-TAATACGACTCACTATTAGAAGTTTTTATCT-3\u2032. the luciferase reporter gene (luc2) was amplified using pGL4.14 (Promega) with the primers 5\u2032-TAATACGACTCACTACTACCCTCTCTTCACTACTAGTGG-3\u2032. all RNA substrates were purified with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. real-time RT-PCR was performed in an ABI 7300 apparatus (Applied Biosystems) using a GoTaq real-time PCR system (Promega) length murine Ifit1 cDNA and JEV MTase cDNA were inserted into pET-15b and pGEX-6P. expression of the Ifit1 and JEV NS5 proteins was induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) the samples were analyzed on thin-layer chromatography polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose plates developed with 0.3 M ammonium sulfate. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a lightShift chemiluminescent RNA EMSA kit. Ifit1-transfected cells were lysed in RNA-binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 0.1 g/l of yeast tRNA (Ambion), and the lysate (200 g) was coincubated with 25 pmol of biotin-labeled RNA and streptavidin supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 30 l of 50% protein G-conjugated Sepharose and 1 g of mouse normal IgG for 1 h. beads were washed five times with RNA buffer without yeast tRNA. RNA was isolated from the precipitants and input samples. luciferase activities of whole-cell lysates were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) the numbers of relative light units (RLU) were normalized by the concentrations of proteins determined by use of a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) the production of the JEV K61A mutant was decreased in wild-type MEFs. this suggests that 2\u2032-O MTase activity is required for JEV replication. we also infected peritoneal macrophages with JEV WT. Ifit1 inhibits replication and infection of flavivirus mutants that lack 2\u2032-O MTase activity. m7GpppA-RNA was methylated in vitro with respective recombinant NS5 proteins or vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase. a neomycin-resistance gene cassette and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene were isolated from the tails of wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/) and homozygous (/) Ifit1 mutant mice. a Southern blot analysis performed after digestion of the genomic DNA with BamHI shows the correct targeting of the locus. ND, not detected. data are representative of three independent experiments. wild-type and Ifit1/ MEFs were infected with the JEV K61A mutant (MOI, 0.1) recombinant Ifit1 reportedly binds to 5\u2032-PPP RNA. mRNA of the JEV K61A mutant has a 5\u2032 m7G cap but lacks 2\u2032-O methylation (5\u2032 cap+/2\u2032-O Me) recombinant Ifit1 preferentially binds to virus RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation. unlabeled 5\u2032-PPP RNA was used as a competitor. loss of band indicates binding of RNA and Ifit1 (top) the cells were harvested after 24 h. the immunoprecipitated RNA was analyzed by nested RT-PCR. each value was normalized by the value for the input. luciferase RNAs in wild-type and Ifit1/ cells were transfected into type I IFN-primed MEFs. total RNA and cell lysates were harvested 6 h later. luciferase mRNA was not translated in either wild-type or Ifit1/. the presence or absence of a 5\u2032 cap and 2\u2032-O Me of the introduced luciferase RNA is indicated. data are shown as means SDs of triplicate samples. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. mice and infected MEFs with JEV WT and JEV K61A strains. the JEV WT replicated equivalently in wild-type and Ifit1/ MEFs. the production of the JEV K61A mutant was decreased. Ifnb was similarly induced in wild-type and Ifit1/ MEFs after infection with the JEV K61A mutant. Ifnb was similarly induced in wild-type and Ifit1/ MEFs after infection with the JEV K61A mutant. neomycin-resistance gene cassette, thymidine kinase gene and a neomycin-resistance gene cassette. the positions of the probe and restriction enzyme site for Southern blotting are shown. peritoneal exudative macrophages were harvested from wild-type mice. titers in 1-ml supernatant aliquots were determined by focus-forming assays on Vero cells. they were expressed as the log10 number of FFU/ml. ND, not detected. recombinant Ifit1 preferentially binds to virus RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation. mRNA of the JEV K61A mutant has a 5\u2032 m7G cap but lacks 2\u2032-O methylation. Ifit1 preferentially binds to 5\u2032 capped RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation. the loss of the band indicates binding of RNA and Ifit1. the cells were harvested after 24 h, and JEV RNA/Ifit1-binding complexes were immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-Flag antibody. each value was normalized by the value for the input. luciferase RNAs with different 5\u2032 structures were transfected into type I IFN-primed MEFs. the levels of luciferase RNAs in wild-type and Ifit1/ cells were unaffected by any of the 5\u2032 modifications. the relative luciferase mRNA amounts are shown. the presence or absence of a 5\u2032 cap and 2\u2032-O Me of the introduced luciferase RNA is indicated. data are shown as means SDs of triplicate samples. replication in vero cells and rapidly reverted to the wild type. a similar phenotype was observed with the WNV D146A 2\u2032-O methylation mutant (11) however, unlike our results, it has recently been reported that a JEV E218A mutant is stable in Vero cells (39) this would be due to the different strains used in the two studies. this would be due to the different strains used in the two studies. RNA-binding site on human IFIT5 is located in a narrow pocket. this raises the possibility that 5\u2032 capped and 2\u2032-O methylated RNA cannot fit within an analogous pocket of Ifit1 due to a size limitation (33) the nonredundant and redundant roles of the Ifit family proteins remain to be elucidated. generation of mice lacking the other members or all of the Ifit family proteins will be useful to reveal the physiological functions."}
