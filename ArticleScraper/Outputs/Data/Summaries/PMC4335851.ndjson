{"summary": "over 95% of adult-acquired infections are spontaneously cleared within 6 months by a vigorous and polyclonal HBV-specific T cell response. more than 90% of exposed neonates and 30% of children 1 to 5 years old develop a chronic infection (2, 3), which is associated with a weaker and often barely detectable virus-specific T cell response. the restoration of host innate and HBV-specific adaptive immune responses is essential for a functional cure of chronic HBV infection (8). pharmacological activation of intrahepatic dendritic cells with agonists of toll-like receptors (TLRs) or other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may facilitate intrahepatic priming of an anti-HBV immune response. the fact that STING can be activated by cyclic dinucleotides implies that, like TLR7/8, STING might be activated by other small molecules. DMXAA (Vadimezan or ASA404) was initially developed as a vascular disrupting agent with antitumor activity partially through activation of natural killer (NK) cells and tumor-associated macrophages. DMXAA activated a STING-dependent signaling pathway to induce a type I IFN-dominant cytokine response in mouse macrophages. agonist Pam3CSK4, the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C), the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the TLR7 agonist Gardiquimod were from InvivoGen. an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of the HBV core protein was described previously (21) antibodies against -actin and mouse IFNAR-1 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. a plasmid expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting murine STING was constructed by inserting the following cDNA sequence into the pRS vector. a control plasmid expressing scrambled shRNA from the pRS vector was purchased from Origene. mice were treated with either DMXAA (in phosphate-buffered saline with 7.5% sodium bicarbonate) at 25 mg/kg or the vehicle via intraperitoneal injection. mice were sacrificed at 24 h after treatment. inant murine IFN-, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) were from PBL InterferonSource. antibodies against -actin and mouse IFNAR-1 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. cDNAs were synthesized with TRIzol reagent. real-time quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis was performed. plasmid expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting murine STING was constructed. mice treated with either DMXAA (in phosphate-buffered saline with 7.5% sodium bicarbonate) mice were sacrificed at 24 h after treatment. the weights of individual mice were measured before and 24 h after treatment. a cell-based assay mimicking the intrahepatic environment to screen small-molecular PRR agonists for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. mouse macrophages were treated with test compounds and the conditioned media of treated macrophages were then applied to immortalized mouse hepatocytes harboring HBV (AML12HBV10) the assay system was first validated with known TLR agonists. cytoplasmic HBV core DNA was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization 2 days posttreatment. RC, relaxed circular DNA; DSL, double-stranded linear DNA; SS, single-stranded DNA; NT, no-treatment control, which consisted of samples from mock-treated AML12HBV10 cells (direct-treatment control) DMXAA-induced antiviral response in macrophages suppressed HBV replication in hepatocytes. conditioned media harvested from DMXAA-treated RAW264.7 cells inhibited HBV DNA replication in mouse hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner. no cytotoxic effect was observed at concentrations of up to 500 M DMXAA. expression and activation of STING were determined by Western blot assay. DMXAA-induced antiviral response in macrophages reduced the amount of cytoplasmic HBV capsids. DMXAA-induced antiviral response in macrophages reduced the HBV nucleocapsids in a hepatocyte cell line. both STING and TLR agonist-induced antiviral responses against HBV in macrophages may be primarily mediated by IFNs. signaling pathway activated and cytokine profiles induced by DMXAA. only DMXAA, and not the TLR1/2, TLR7, TLR3 and TLR4 agonists, induced STING phosphorylation, which was detectable in cells treated with DMXAA for more than 30 min. however, DMXAA and all of the TLR agonists tested efficiently induced the phosphorylation of TBK1, a kinase essential cytokine profiles induced by DMXAA and TLR agonists in RAW264.7 cells were determined by qRT-PCR assays. DMXAA induced approximately 100-fold more IFN- mRNA expression than the TLR1/2, TLR3 or TLR7 agonist did at 2 h posttreatment. DMXAA treatment of RAW264.7 cells activated STING and induced an antiviral cytokine response to suppress HBV replication in mouse hepatocytes. in order to further determine the role of STING in the DMXAA-induced antiviral cytokine response, we established RAW264.7-derived stable cell lines expressing either scrambled shRNA or shRNA specifically targeting mouse STING mRNA. RNA levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR. data are expressed as percentages of the NT control value. expression and activation of STING and TBK1 were determined. type I IFNs were the primary mediators of the DMXAA-induced antiviral response against HBV. blockade of the type I IFN receptor in AML12HBV10 cells significantly reduced the antiviral response induced by IFN-. AML12HBV10 cells cultured in the absence of tetracycline were cultured for 1 day either with or without preincubation with 10 g/ml of a monoclonal antibody against type I IFNAR1 (Ab INFAR) for 1 h, followed by treatment for 2 days with the concentrations of mouse IFN- indicated (A) or 50% of the conditioned media harvested from RAW264.7 cells. the average body weight of DMXAA-treated mice was reduced by approximately 8%. the average body weight of DMXAA-treated mice was reduced by approximately 8%. DMXAA could be used as a surrogate marker for STING agonist-induced pharmacological and toxicological responses in vivo. direct treatment of hepatocytes with TLR agonists induces a negligible cytokine response. but some hepatic NPCs express high levels of TLRs (25, 26) we have developed a cell-based assay to screen small-molecular PRR agonists for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. antiviral response in macrophages suppressed HBV replication in hepatocytes. DMXAA-induced antiviral response in macrophages suppressed HBV replication in hepatocytes. DMXAA-induced antiviral response in macrophages suppressed HBV replication in hepatocytes. tilorone, CMA, and DMXAA were identified as potent IFN inducers in mice several decades ago (30\u201332) both CMA and DMXAA demonstrated strong indirect anti-HBV activity in our assay system. NT controls were as described in the legend to Fig. 1B. DMXAA-induced antiviral response reduced the amount of cytoplasmic HBV capsids. covalently closed circular DNA is undetectable and HBV replication is fully supported by pregenomic RNA transcribed from the integrated copy of the HBV genome in the host cell chromosome. the amounts of HBV mRNA, capsid protein, total capsids, and capsid-associated HBV DNA in the treated AML12HBV10 cells were detected by Northern blot hybridization, Western blot assay, native agarose gel-based viral particle assay DMXAA induced a distinct profile of cytokine responses in macrophages. only DMXAA and all of the TLR agonists tested efficiently induced the phosphorylation of TBK1. phosphorylated p38, JNK, and ERK were detected as early as 15 min. activation of the MAPK pathways was delayed and only became detectable at 90 min after DMXAA treatment. cytokine profiles induced by DMXAA and TLR agonists in mouse macrophage cells were determined by qRT-PCR assays. DMXAA treatment of RAW264.7 cells activated STING and induced an antiviral cytokine response. DMXAA-induced, but not LPS-induced, TBK1 activation was significantly compromised in RAW264.7 cells expressing STING-specific shRNA. DMXAA-induced cytokine and antiviral responses were STING dependent. total RNAs were extracted from wild-type (WT) RAW264.7 cells and RAW264.7-derived stable cell lines that express scrambled shRNA (shcontrol) or shRNA targeting mouse STING mRNA (shSTING) AML12HBV10 cells cultured in the absence of tetracycline for 1 day were mock treated or treated for 2 days with 50% of the conditioned media harvested from RAW264.7-derived shcontrol or shSTING cells. cytoplasmic HBV core DNA was extracted and quantified by a real-time PCR assay. cytokines mediating the DMXAA-induced antiviral response. we tested the antiviral effects of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-. we demonstrated that only TNF- inhibited HBV DNA replication. this result is consistent with fact that anti-TNF therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and psoriasis reactivates HBV infection in inactive carriers. single-dose DMXAA treatment produced a 1.3-log reduction in intrahepatic HBV core DNA. the average body weight of DMXAA-treated mice was reduced by approximately 8%. DMXAA inhibits HBV replication in mice. total RNA was extracted from livers, and levels of OAS1b and viperin mRNAs were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assay. all of the data are presented in box plots showing medians, interquartiles, and ranges (minimum and maximum values) liver-resident NK cells and NKT cells have been shown to restrict HBV infection in vivo. accumulating evidence suggests that liver-resident macrophages and dendritic cells play essential roles in the priming and activation of the host adaptive immune response to HBV. responses induced by TLR and STING agonists revealed distinct characteristics. DMXAA induced a cytokine response in macrophages that was dominated by IFN-. if only considering the property of inducing a noncytolytic antiviral cytokine response, intrahepatic activation of the STING pathway seems to be superior to the activation of TLR pathways. liposomal delivery of STING agonists cleared from circulation by Kupffer cells."}
