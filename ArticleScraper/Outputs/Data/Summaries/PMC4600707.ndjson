{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can cause extrapulmonary manifestations. gastrointestinal manifestations account for 25% of M. pneumoniae infections. acute pancreatitis is rarely associated with M. pneumoniae infection. brain computed tomography scans were unremarkable without findings of cerebral edema and hemorrhage. initial laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin of 14.4 g/dL, hematocrit 30.1%, white blood cell count of 22,500/mm3. mumps virus, measles virus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, leptospira, aspergillus, and toxoplasma were all unremarkable. a portal vein thrombus of 2 cm was observed in the main portal vein. creatitis was associated with M. pneumoniae infection. fever persisted despite intravenous antibiotic therapy with meropenem and clarithromycin. fever subsided with subsequent improvement of her general condition. 20,480, and serum antibody titers to M. pneumoniae were >100 for IgG AU/mL and 3.6 index value for IgM. magnetic resonance imaging performed after one month of hospitalization revealed that the extent of the pseudocyst had decreased. but near total necrosis of the pancreas body and tail was observed. acute pancreatitis is characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, elevation of pancreatic enzyme levels on laboratory tests. it is estimated that 2 to 13 new cases occur annually per 100,000 children in the pediatric population. biliary diseases, complications from medications, systemic diseases, systemic infections, trauma, and organ transplant are among the major etiologic factors of acute pancreatitis. the pathomechanism of M. pneumoniae infection associated with acute pancreatitis may be related to the vascular occlusion type mechanism with a systemic hypercoagulable state. the overall mortality of acute pancreatitis is about 5%. the basic concept of treatment in acute necrotizing pancreatitis is not greatly different from that of acute pancreatitis without necrosis. rapid and accurate initial assessment of the severity of necrotizing pancreatitis is also important, as some patients should be managed in an intensive care unit. necrotizing pancreatitis should be considered a cause of children with severe pancreatitis with a recent history of preceding respiratory symptoms. early aggressive supportive care and close observation of complications is crucial for preventing mortalities and morbidities."}
