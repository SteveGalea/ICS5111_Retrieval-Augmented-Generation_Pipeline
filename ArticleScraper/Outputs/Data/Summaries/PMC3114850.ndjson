{"summary": "a total of 95 children with radiological focal, lobar or segmental consolidation had lung aspirate performed and sent for bacterial culture and for PCR for detection of bacteria, viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii. pneumonia aetiology studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the bacterial aetiology of pneumonia. an inherent difficulty with pneumonia aetiology studies is the low yield from blood culture. PCR of lung aspirate fluid increases the yield further. aspiration on a select group of Malawian children as part of a larger descriptive study. we report the use of PCR for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Pneumocystis jirovecii and nine respiratory viruses. we compare diagnostic yield for bacteria between PCR applied to lung aspirate and bacteriological median age- years (IQR) 2.6 (1.0\u20135.7) Median duration of symptoms- days (IQR) 4 (3\u20135) Prior treatment Antibiotics 49 (52%) Penicillin 20 Cotrimoxazole therapy 15 Of which, on prophylaxis. bacterial organism was S.pneumoniae (41%), followed by H. influenzae b (6%), and the commonest virus identified was adenovirus (16%), followed by human bocavirus (4%), either as single or co-infection. the infant with HBoV infection was 6 months old, co-infected with CMV and was also HIV-infected. galovirus 3 100% NT NT 3 Atypical Chlamydia pneumoniae 2 0% NT NT 2 Mycoplasma pneumoniae 0 NT NT 0 Pneumocystis jirovecii 3 100% NT NT 3 NT: not tested, PcP: pneumocystis pneumonia, Hib: Haemophilus influenzae b, CMV: cytomegalovirus. 2 patients had mixed infection children were bacteraemic by blood culture or blood PCR for pneumococcus or Hib. prior antibiotics were reported in 23/36 (64%) with bacteria identified by PCR. children with a confirmed bacterial pneumonia were significantly less likely to have signs of grunting or require oxygen therapy than children without confirmed bacterial pneumonia. blood bacterial loads ranged from 1.22102 to 1.54106 copies/ml. blood and lung aspirate median bacterial loads were higher in non-survivors than in survivors. there was no correlation between lung and blood bacterial loads. study population characteristics During the study period, we screened 424 children with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia by chest radiographs. the median age was 2.6 years, interquartile range (IQR) 1.0\u20135.7 years. 58 were male (61%), 59 (62%) were HIV-infected, and 6 died (6.3%). pathogens identified by culture or PCR A pathogen (bacterial, viral, pneumocystis) were identified in 59 children (62%), either singly or as co-infection. the commonest bacterial organism was S.pneumoniae (41%), followed by H. influenzae b (6%), and the commonest virus identified was adenovirus (16%). four out of 6 children with hib pneumonia were fully immunised, one had received only one dose and in one there was no record of immunisation status. aetiology of radiologically confirmed pneumonia. blood and lung aspirate culture and S.pneumoniae from lung aspirate PCR, 7 had S.pneumoniae/adenovirus, 1 had S.pneumoniae/Chlamydia, 1 case with S.pneumoniae had M. tuberculosis cultured from nasopharyngeal aspirate after induced sputum. blood culture was positive in only 8 children, 6 with S.pneu aetiology p value Increased work of breathing 31/45 (69%) 35/47 (75%) NS Grunting 17/46 (37%) 28/49 (57%) 0.05 Crackles 32/45 (71%) 40/48 (83%) NS Oxygen therapy 8/45 (18%) 20/46 (44%) 0.008 Temperature>38\u00b0C 28/46 (61%) 34/49 (69%) NS Oxygen saturation90% 4/42 (10%) 13/48 two patients (2%) had a pneumothorax on the same side as the aspiration. one presented with worsening respiratory distress about 4 hours after aspiration. a large tension pneumothorax was diagnosed. most studies of pneumonia aetiology have previously only used blood culture to identify bacterial aetiologies. the median age of our group was higher than that of children with pneumonia presenting to queen Elizabeth Central Hospital [11] pathogens that commonly occur in infants such as RSV may therefore be under-represented in our study. there are now 35 reported studies of pneumonia in children where lung aspirate has been used [4], [5], [6], [10]. in the review of the published series up to 1999 the pneumothorax complication rate was 3.3%. there are seven deaths reported from 6001 lung aspirates. our study is the first to report HBoV detection in lung aspirate samples in children with radiological pneumonia. a recent study from Finland found high concentrations of HBoV in induced sputum, also suggesting that the virus may have originated from the lower airways. in a recent study from Kenya, 56% of infants and children who presented with severe pneumonia had one or more respiratory viruses detected on nasal wash samples by PCR [22]. lung aspirate PCR significantly increases diagnostic yield in children with focal, segmental or lobar consolidation. the study adds to the growing body of evidence that respiratory viruses contribute significantly to the aetiology of childhood pneumonia in Africa. blood (1\u20132 ml) was taken for culture prior to commencement of antibiotics. all isolates were identified using standard diagnostic techniques. HIV status was determined in all patients. lung aspirate fluid was cultured using the BacT/Alert 3D automated system. the rest of the sample was stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. real-time quantitative PCR was performed using primers previously described. a multiplex influenza RT-PCR was performed to identify Influenza A and B. a second multiplex RT-PCR was used for the detection of parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134. adenovirus, Chlamydia and M. pneumoniae were detected using previously published protocols. p values are two-tailed, and the 5% significance level was used to infer statistical significance. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 15.0 (Illinois, USA) was used for all analyses. Ethics statement Ethical approval obtained from both The College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Research and Ethics Committee. culture prior to commencement of antibiotics and cultured using the BacT/Alert 3D automated system (BioMerieux, France) all isolates were identified using standard diagnostic techniques and antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. aspirate fluid was cultured using the BacT/Alert 3D automated system. the remainder of the sample was stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. RNA was amplified and quantified using a real-time PCR assay. the HCoV genomes were amplified separately by RT-PCR using previously published primers for; HCoV NL63 [34], HCoV HKU1 [35], HCoV229E, and HCoVOC43 [36]. the multiplex PCR assays for these respiratory viruses have been used by our group in previous studies [38], [39], [40]. a cut-off value of >100 copies/ml was used to determine a positive PCR in either blood or lung aspirate. this value was used based on a previous study using pneumococcal DNA."}
