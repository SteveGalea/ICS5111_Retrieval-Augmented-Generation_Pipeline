{"summary": "an estimated 95% of all public and private hospitals use this tool. an anonymous extraction of the dataset with limited sociodemographic information can be made available for specific epidemiologic studies. a unique patient identifier was created by chaining the variables year of birth, gender, and residence postal code. the same identifier was used to match PMSI and CepiDc data, to identify additional deaths and to check for duplicates. cases detected >1 time were classified as new cases at first occurrence. hematologic malignancies included neutropenia or aplastic anemia, acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia, lymphomas, and other disorders of the myeloid system. the third category, labeled nonhematologic immunodepression, included solid organ cancers, HIV infection, solid organ transplantations, and/or rejection of these transplantations. the total number of deaths is N = n1,1 + n1,2 + n2,1 + n2,2. the variance and 95% confidence intervals are Var(N) = (n1,1 + n2,1)(n1,1 + n1,2)(n1,2)(n2,1)/(n1,1)3 and 95% CI = N 1.96Var(N), respectively. an estimated 95% of all public and private hospitals use this tool. medical information includes the main cause of admission (principal diagnosis), the related medical conditions (with >20 entries for various associated diagnoses), duration of stay, modes of admission and discharge, and major medical activities performed during the stay. the same identifier was used to match PMSI and CepiDc data. in the PMSI we derived the year of birth from age at admission. cases detected >1 time were classified as new cases at first occurrence in the database. a second category labeled hematologic malignancies included neutropenia or aplastic anemia, acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia, lymphomas, and other disorders of the myeloid system. the third category, labeled nonhematologic immunodepression, included solid organ cancers, HIV infection, solid organ transplantations, and/or rejection of these transplantations. the total number of deaths is N = n1,1 + n1,2 + n2,1 + n2,2. the variance and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are Var(N) = (n1,1 + n2,1)(n1,1 + n1,2)(n1,2)(n2,1)/(n1,1)3 and 95% CI = N 1.96Var(N), respectively. the annual incidence rate increased from 0.7 cases/million persons in 1997 to 1.2/million persons in 2006. this average AIR increased with age from 0.3/million in children aged 0\u20139 years to 3.9/million in patients >89 years of age. the highest rates were observed in 5 rural districts hosting 500,000 inhabitants each. malignancies, the specific AIR increased over time from 0.02 to 0.2 cases/million persons from 1997 through 2006 (+24%/year; p0.001) it also increased in patients with BMT (+15%/year; p = 0.02) or with diabetes (+9%/year; p = 0.02) incidence was not significantly altered over time for patients with nonhematologic immunodepression and in patients with no known risk factors. average CFR was 13.7% in the 1997\u20132003 period versus 23.6% in the 2004\u20132006 period (p0.01). the specific CFR according to conditions was calculated only for the 61 deaths reported in the PMSI for which information was available. it was greater when patients had hematologic malignancies (47.8%) or BMT (36.4%) the average standardized incidence rate varied from 0 to 36 over the 10-year period. the highest rates were observed in 5 rural districts hosting 500,000 inhabitants each (p0.01) from 2.4/million (95% CI 2.3\u20132.5) to 3.4/million (95% CI 3.2\u20133.5) versus 0.9/million nationwide. s 20 6 30.0 Other lymphoid/myeloid disorders 16 4 25.0 Nonhematologic immunodepression 64 8 12.5 Cancers of the solid organs 28 3 10.7 HIV/AIDS 26 1 3.8 Solid organ transplantations 10 4 40.0 Diabetes 86 8 9.3 No known risk factor 289 12 4.2 Total 531 61 11.5 *Calculated only for the 61 deaths reported in hospital records. the average 0.9/million annual incidence rate in France is lower than the 1.7/million reported in the population-based study by Rees et al. in California in 1992\u20131993 (23). the average 0.9/million annual incidence rate in France is lower than the 1.7/million incidence reported in the population-based study by Rees et al. in California in 1992\u20131993 (23). the incidence of zygomycosis is regularly debated because of limitations in diagnosis accuracy, inconsistent disease coding, or undetected duplicates because of anonymous data recording (26). authors stressed that these codes may sometimes be assigned before final diagnosis is confirmed, or they may not be assigned by the clinician in charge of the patient. overreporting was estimated at 11% for cancers of the thyroid in a study based in 10 districts (28) the number of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations increased by +1.58% per year (p0.01) 2001\u20132006. in parallel, diabetes prevalence increased at an estimated 5.7%/year in France from 2000 through 2005 (37). a retrospective analysis of hospital records provides a population-based estimate of zygomycosis incidence and trends over a 10-year period. the average 0.9/million annual incidence rate in France is lower than the 1.7/million incidence reported in the population-based study by Rees et al. in California in 1992\u20131993. in a survey performed in Spain in 2005, incidence was 0.43/106 on a representative sample of 50 participating hospitals covering one third of the country\u2019s population. this network, which covers all university and other tertiary level hospitals in France, reported an average of 17 cases per year since 2003 versus 65 in our study for the same period. overreporting was estimated at 11% for cancers of the thyroid in a study based in 10 districts (28) and at 15% for mesothelioma (29). inversely, underreporting caused by diagnostic or coding errors was estimated at 17% by Hafdi-Nejjari et al. and at 27% by Carr\u00e9 et al. the PMSI provides scarce information about the sociodemographic characteristics of patients. the highest incidence rates found in 5 rural districts and not in others of comparable age and gender distributions may indicate an increased awareness of these diseases among clinicians. the wide range of CFR estimates calculated with the capture\u2013recapture method reflects these uncertainties. recent progress in early diagnosis and treatment strategies over time should also be considered. this study will provide a description of zygomycosis cases and their outcome in France. it should enable us to evaluate the predictive value of administrative data for this rare disease."}
