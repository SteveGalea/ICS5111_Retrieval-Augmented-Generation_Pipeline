{"summary": "human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common pathogen causing congenital infection and primary infection during pregnancy1. it can cause life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients and has been recognized as a risk factor for vascular diseases. HCMV can infect many different cell types in vivo, such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, epithelialcells, neuronal cells, monocyte/macrophage lineage cells and so on5\u20137. HCMV infection of endothelial cells is also associated with atherosclerosis and transplant vascular sclerosis in HCMV-infected patients. however, the specific mechanisms by which HCMV infects endotheli enet target cells infected with HCMV are different performance depended on probe characteristics, array density, sample labeling methods and the characteristics of target cell11\u201314. most studies aimed at human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) as target cell, gene expression profiling of endothelial cells infected with HCMV has not been studied intensively. one batch of uninfected cells served as control, while others were infected with HCMV AD169 strain. PCR was performed in 50 l reaction mixtures, containing 0.5g of DNA template, 0.4 M of each primer, 25 l of 2Premix and 18l of ddH2O. slides were visualized with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. microarray hybridization and analysis Total RNA from the infected and uninfected cells were extracted using trizol reagent. Scanning was performed with an Agilent 2565BA scanner. the data of the images were acquired using an Agilent 2565BA scanner. the features were automatically loaded with a grid file and calculated centroid positions of each spot on the microarray. RTase, 10 Uof RNase Inhibitor, 400 ng of total RNA and RNase Free dH2Owere carried out under the following conditions: 10 min at 42\u00b0C, 2 s at 95\u00b0C. real-time qPCR was used to validate microarray and performed on a Rotor Gene 3000 Fluorescence quantitative detection system (CORBETT, Australia) 304 cells were infected with 1mL puri\u00fbed HCMV virions. one batch of uninfected cells served as control, while other batches were infected. PCR was performed in 50 l reaction mixtures, containing 0.5g of DNA template, 0.4 M of each primer, 25 l of 2Premix and 18l of ddH2O. the PCR products were electrophoresed using 1.5% agarose gels (Shanghai Yito Enterprise, Shanghai, China) the quality of total RNAs (500 ng) from the uninfected and infected ECV304 cells was controlled by ultraviolet spectrophotometer DU530 (Beckman) and BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) the total RNAs (500 ng) from the uninfected and infected ECV304 cells were reversed-transcribed and labeled with Cy5- and Cy3-dCTP using the net Cy3 and Cy5 signal intensities for each feature were formed by subtracting the mean of the pixels in the local background from the mean of the pixels in the feature. the spots were included whose foreground signals were significantly greater than the local background signals. PCR reactions in a final volume of 10l reaction mixture contain 5l PCR mixture, 1l diluted cDNA and 0.5 M each primer specific primers for six genes selected from differentially expressing genes. the specificity of the primer set was confirmed by melting curve analysis (65\u201395\u00b0C with a heating rate of 0.5\u00b0C/min) in this study, we evaluated the expression of pp65 in ECV304 cells using immunofluorescence that is simple, reliable, less time-consuming and cheap. cells infected with HCMV AD169 showed very intense nuclear staining (figure 1A) uninfected cells displayed no detectable staining if subjected to same conditions as infected cells (figure 1B). the yellow dots represent no significant difference between gProcessedsignal and rProcessedsignal, while red and blue represent significant difference between them. most of the dots distributed in the yellow region with red and blue dots consist with the general rule of high-density cDNA microarray hybridization. differential expressed genes induced by HCMV infection were also involved in the pathogenic mechanism of HCMV infection. these genes included apoptosisrelated genes (Granzyme B, DAPK2, TARF2, TNFSF9, TNFSF10, Bcl-2L10, TGFBRAP1), G-protein-coupled receptors signal transduction pathway-related genes (RGS6, RGS2, GIT1), cell cycle-related genes (cyclinE, E these results indicated that HCMV AD169 stain could infect ECV304 cells. agar gel electrophoresis showed three bands of 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA and 5S rRNA. the effective hybrid spots were more than 99% meeting the requirements of analysis. the scatter plot of fluorescence intensities was drawn with gProcessedsignal (Cy3) as ordinate against rProcessedsignal (Cy5) as abscissa. the result showed that there were 559 differential expressed genes. 471 genes were found to be expressed up-regulated; 334 of which had clear functions, while 88 genes were found to be expressed down-regulated. cDNA microarray can simultaneously monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes to study the effects of certain treatments, diseases, and developmental stages on gene expression. in these biological processes, the P value of signal transduction-related genes is lowest (P=0.005), containing 21 genes. DNA-dependent transcriptional regulation-related genes were the most, containing 29 genes. mRNA accumulation and 1425 cellular mRNAs were found to be up-regulated or down-regulated by threefold or greater. cDNA microarrays showed that HCMV-regulated gene expression profile in fibroblasts using high-density cDNA microarrays. the interaction of gB with its unidentified cellular receptor is the principal mechanism by which HCMV alters cellular gene expression early during infection. gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. it encodes a protein that is often found as a disulfide linked homodimer. this protein is a glycosylated mitogen that acts on endothelial cells. this protein has various effects including mediating increased vascular permeability. HCMV may effectively use UL33 to orchestrate multiple signaling networks within infected cells. cytokines belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. cytokine encoded by TNFSF9 is a ligand for TNFRSF9/4-1BB. the binding of this protein to its receptors has been shown to trigger the activation of MAPK8/JNK, caspase 8 and caspase 3. the biological process, such as S phase of mitotic cell cycle, was significant in HCMV infection. up-regulated genes may represent host responses to stress stimuli. downregulation of other cellular transcripts may be partly attributed to the shutoff of host macromolecular synthesis in favor of viral replication. MAP2K2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2) can encode a protein. MICB gene encodes a heavily glycosylated protein which is a ligand for the NKG2D type II receptor. this protein is stress-induced and does not associate with beta-2-microglobulin or bind peptides. HCMV infection is associated with graft rejection by upregulating expression of MICB 29. a protein encoded by this gene contains conserved BH4, BH1 and BH2 domains. overexpression of this gene has been shown to suppress cell apoptosis. this protein is found to interact with Apaf1 and forms a protein complex with Caspase 9."}
