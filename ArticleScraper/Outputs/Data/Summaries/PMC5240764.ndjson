{"summary": "the positive for CDV, CPIV and CAdV-2 was obtained from the modified-live vaccine Vanguard\u00ae plus 5/CV-L (Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, U.S.A.) the positive for CRCoV, CaHV-1 and CIV was derived from naturally infected dogs that were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. nucleic acid was quantified and qualified using nanodrop\u00ae Lite. the extracted nucleic acid was divided into two aliquots. the RT was performed using 100 ng RNA as the template for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. canine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an internal control as reported earlier [20]. Virus Primer name sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) Target genea. a first round PCR for CRCoV was performed in order to increase detection sensitivity. a mixture of 2x GoTaq\u00ae Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), 0.4 M final concentration of each outer primer (CoV_16053_F and CoV_16594_R) and 2 l of cDNA were made up to 25 l. multiplex PCR was optimized separately for RNA- and DNA-associated CIRDC viruses. the starting genetic material for RNA virus detection was derived from two compartments: (1) product from the first nested PCR of CRCoV and (2) cDNA of the other RNA viruses. the suitable Ta was selected for further comparative analysis with simplex PCR. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were determined. independent t-test was used to evaluate difference between route of sample collection and number of viral detection using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., New York, NY, U.S.A.) the sequenced amplicons showed 100% sequence identity with their respective sequence in the GenBank database. the multiplex PCR products were observed at the same template dilutions as with the simplex PCR. the highest detection threshold was found for CDV and CRCoV, then CaHV-1 and CIV. simplex and multiplex modalities revealed minimal detectable dilution at 24 (CAdV-2) and 26 (CaHV-1)ng/reaction. no specific amplicons were detected in all reactions. both intra- and inter-assay variations revealed similar results.

CDV, CAdV-2 and CaHV-1 were not detected as a single infection. 2% (1/51) was positive for CRCoV infection in both NS and OS samples. for dual infections, the most frequently detected viruses were CIV co-infected with CRCoV at 13.7% and 21.6% in NS and OS, followed by CIV with CPIV at 9.8% and 7.8% in NS and OS samples. one dog was negative for all tested viruses in both the NS and OS samples. multiplex PCR has been developed previously to detect several pathogens of CIRDC, such as CIV, CDV and CRCoV. the overall sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR was more than 90% and 87%, respectively, compared to simplex counterparts. however, the detection of CRCoV was modified as a hemi-nested RT-PCR to increase its sensitivity. rapid antigen test kits may have a low sensitivity to detect the influenza virus, but could still be suitable for rapid in-house clinical applications. this is consistent with reports that many rapid test kits might have a low sensitivity to detect the influenza virus, but could still be suitable for rapid in-house clinical applications [11, 15]. 3 out of 15 vaccinated dogs received combined vaccine against CPIV, CDV and CAdV-2 showed PCR positive results for CIRDC virus detection. this study documented caHV-1 and CRCoV circulation in Thailand for the first time. in 2012, CIV H3N2 was discovered in Thailand from dogs with flu-like symptoms. these viruses were also found as co-infections together or with other viruses. multiplex PCR assays are suitable for a screening test for disease diagnosis, quarantine and prevention measures, especially in developing countries."}
