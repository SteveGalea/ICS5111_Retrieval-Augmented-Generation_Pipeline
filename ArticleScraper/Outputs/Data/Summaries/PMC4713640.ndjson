{"summary": "Sepsis is a type of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) it is a category of infection complication for some diseases, disorder and severe trauma. Symptoms of sepsis include abnormal body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate and the abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte. many studies indicated that polymorphisms in the promoter region and exon1 of MBL2 gene contribute to the MBL serum concentration and MBL activation [18-20] because the polymorphism distributions are different in ethnicity and region. MBL2 rs1800450 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. plasma and leukocytes were respectively stored in -80\u00b0C until to use. 134 healthy individuals (86 males, 48 females, mean age 49.65 14.98) who received health examination in the healthy check-up center of air force general hospital of PLA were enrolled as controls. controls matched with cases in age, gender, ethnicity and living area. the association of rs1800450 polymorphism with sepsis was represented by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) all of the calculations were performed by PASW 18.0. rs1800450 polymorphism is associated with sepsis. rs18004550 polymorphism is associated with sepsis. rs18004550 polymorphism is associated with sepsis. ELISA results showed that the MBL serum levels in case and control groups were respectively as 1533.44 698.17 and 3017.56 573.90 g/L, these concentrations had a significantly difference (P0.001) MBL serum level in different genotypes of rs1800450 polymorphism in sepsis patients. five widely studied MBL2 gene polymorphisms were reasonably related to reduced MBL serum level. these polymorphisms include three structure variants, codon 52 (rs5030737C/T, A/D), 54 (rs1800450G/A, termed A/B), 57 (rs1800451G/A, termed A/C) and two promoter variants -550 (rs11003125G/C, termed H/L), the association of MBL2 gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of sepsis in Turks is still unclear. in addition, gene polymorphism was different among regions and ethnicity. ELISA test showed a significantly decreasing trend of MBL serum level in cases compared with controls. conflict of interest were impermissible."}
