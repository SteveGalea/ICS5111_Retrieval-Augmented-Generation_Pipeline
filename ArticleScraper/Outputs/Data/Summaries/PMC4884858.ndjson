{"summary": "PKV is a virus that may associate with acute viral gastroenteritis in pigs, especially piglets. there are no reports of a PKV epidemic in Gansu Province of China to date. 203 porcine fecal samples were collected from the seven main geographic regions of Gansu Province. the samples were divided into two groups: 129 adult pigs and 74 piglets. many pathogens cause diarrhea in pigs, including PEDV, RV, TGEV, and SaV. 3D is the most highly conserved region of the PKV genome, so most detection primers are designed to bind to it. however, the sensitivity and repeatability of the PCR with primers based on this region were not as good as the primer we used based on 544 bp sequence of 2C. the one-step RT-PCR was performed with the PrimeScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit ver. 2 from Takara. 2.5. Sequence Analysis We analyzed the amplified 2C gene fragments of PKV and constructed a phylogenetic tree based on it using the maximum-likelihood method. no sample was positive for PKV only, but samples were frequently coinfected with PEDV. we used RT-PCR assays to detect PKV, PEDV, and SaV in all the samples. we constructed a phylogenetic tree using the amplified fragments of the 2C gene of PKV. 3D is the most highly conserved region of the PKV genome. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Fecal suspensions (20%) were prepared in 0.0067 M phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min. the RNA was extracted from 400 L of the fecal suspensions using the miniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) of the 74 samples collected from piglets, PKV was found in 87.8%, PEDV in 94.6%, SaV in 13.5%, PKV and SaV in 10.8%, PKV and SaV in 10.8%, and PKV, PEDV, and SaV in 10.8%. of the 74 piglets samples, 2.7% were free of all three viruses. the viral samples shared 90.1%\u2013100% nucleic acid sequence similarity. the 15 Gansu isolates shared 90.6%\u201399.3% nucleotide identity with strain S-1-HUN. the strains from different regions of Gansu showed sequence variations. the outbreaks of PKV in Jiuquan may be attributable to L3 or vice versa. we must strictly control the importation and exportation of pigs between regions. PKV displays good host adaption and is endemic to Gansu Province. PKV and PEDV in 87.8%, PKV and SaV in 10.8%, PEDV and SaV in 13.5%, and PKV, PEDV, and SaV in 10.8%. of the total fecal samples (n = 203), 23.15% were free of all three viruses. of the 74 piglets samples, 2.7% were free of all three viruses. the 15 Gansu isolates shared 90.6%\u201399.3% nucleic acid sequence identity with strain swKoV CH441. strains from different regions of Gansu showed sequence variations, suggesting that they have different origins. the 15 PKV identified in this study may have various genetic relationships with other porcine kobuviruses recorded in GenBank. these findings indicate that PKV displays good host adaption and is endemic to Gansu Province. piglets, especially those with diarrhea, have a higher prevalence of PKV infection than pigs in all other age groups in Gansu Province. the prevalence of PKV decreased significantly with age, which is consistent with the previous finding that PKV prevalence was highest in pigs 3 weeks old [15]. s.
