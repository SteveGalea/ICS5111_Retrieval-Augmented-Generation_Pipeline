{"summary": "the pathology of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been described. several mechanisms of immune evasion and suppression have been described for the pathology of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. signaling has been described [13], revealing that activation of TLR2 increases resistance of macrophages to HIV-1 infection [14]. Interestingly, dendritic cells were less responsive via TLR upon expression of ENV on the membrane [15]. these emerging studies link the manipulation of TLR2 responses and HIV-1 pathogenesis through as yet unknown mechanisms. ectopic expression of intact gp41 and gp160 inhibited LTA mediated cytokine secretion. gp41 protected mice against LTA and D-galactosamine-mediated acute sepsis, concomitant with a decrease in tissue damage. the basal level of phosphorylated ERK1,2 was also decreased by the gp41 TMD peptide but not by the mutant peptide. we then measured expression levels of NFB downstream genes. the treatment resulted in a 45% decrease in MCP1 mRNA expression levels compared to non-treated cells. the WT peptide shows over 50% decrease in p-ERK levels. mutant peptide shows approximately 15%. expression levels were normalized to the expression of non-activated cells. incubation of gp41 TMD peptides with cells leads to inhibition of TLR2/6 signaling. results suggest a potential potent immunosuppressive effect of gp41 HIV-1 ENV protein via inhibition of TLR2 mediated signaling. the fully processed ENV protein, once expressed on the cellular membrane, results in inhibition of TLR2 activation. the fully processed ENV protein, once expressed on the cellular membrane, results in inhibition of TLR2 activation. the level of association between the TMDs of gp41 WT and TLR2 was significantly higher than that of the gp41 mutant and TLR2. gp41 TMD interacts directly with the TLR2 TMD in vitro. incubated for 2 hours with the indicated peptides and then cells were lysed and the Co hours with the indicated peptides and then cells were lysed and the Co-i.p. was performed. band detection was performed by using a fluorescence spectra-photometer scanner. the TMDs of TLR2 and TLR6, we performed a FRET competition assay between TLR2 and 6 in the absence (Figure S3 a in Text S1) or presence (Figure S3 b in Text S1) of the gp41 WT peptide. this inhibition was further corroborated by immunoprecipitation of TLR6-TMD peptides with the TLR2 protein. peptide (5 mg/kg), mutated peptide (5 mg/kg) or PBS. 7/9 mice and 6/9 of the gp41 mutant treated mice died. gp41 TMD treatment resulted in massive parenchyma damage associated with hemorrhage. gp41 TMD reduced monocyte activation, resulting in less apoptosis in the spleen. gp41 TMD reduces serum cytokine levels in vivo and protects from consequential spleen damage. gp41 TMD peptide treated mice showed a similar increase in Mac2 positive cells. spleen staining with anti-Mac2 showed low intensity staining of Mac2 positive cells. spleen staining with anti-Mac2 showed very high elevation of Mac2 positive cells. representative data of 3 typical experiments of anti-Mac2 staining of the spleens of LTA/GLN treated mice, treated with either PBS or WT gp41TMD or mutated gp41TMD. Arrows indicate round shaped macrophages that could either infiltrating activated monocytes or activated kupffer cells. the gp41 mutant peptide did not change the levels of phosphorylated ERK1,2. the basal level of phosphorylated ERK1,2 was also decreased. treatment resulted in a 45% decrease in MCP1 mRNA expression levels compared to non-treated cells. ERK1,2 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells was detected before and after LTA exposure. cells were either pre-incubated with indicated peptides for 2 hours prior to LTA addition or untreated. limited to murine cells we evaluated the effect of the peptides on human cells. the mutant peptide did not affect the secretion levels of TNF. these results suggest a potent immunosuppressive effect of gp41 HIV-1 ENV protein via inhibition of TLR2 mediated signaling. gp160 expressing cells showed a reduction in TNF secretion. gp41 showed even more reduction of TNF secretion compared to gp160. this should result in less hindrance upon its interaction with TLR2. the GALLEX system [23], [24] was used to evaluate the hetero-association of gp41 and TLR2 TMDs in biological membranes. -gal activity was measured after the expression of LexA-TMD-MBP chimera proteins in which the TMDs are those of ENV and of TLR2. or peptides was performed from 140, 120, 110 and 11 acceptordonor ratios. 1*106 cells were incubated for 2 hours with the indicated peptides. then cells were lysed and the Co hours with the indicated peptides. band detection was performed by using a fluorescence spectra-photometer scanner. gp41 mutant peptide preserved helical secondary structures, typical of a TMD peptide (Figure S2 in Text S1). gp41 mutant peptide preserved helical structures, suggesting that any functional discrepancies are not as a result of major structural deformation. mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with 100 g of LTA and 700 mg/kg D-galactosamine (GLN) mice were either treated intravenous (i.v.) with gp41 TMD peptide (5 mg/kg), mutated peptide (5 mg/kg) or PBS. gp41 mutant treated mice died while only 2/9 of the gp41 TMD treated mice died. gp41 TMD treatment decreased apoptosis to levels similar to nave samples. cell death was also detected in the red pulp of untreated mice. gp41 TMD decreased monocyte activation, resulting in less apoptosis in the spleen. gp41 TMD peptide treated mice showed a similar increase in Mac2 positive cells. spleen staining with anti-Mac2 showed very high elevation of mac2 positive cells. gp41 TMD peptide treated mice showed low intensity staining of Mac2 positive cells. mice treated with gp41 TMD+LTA/GLN showed minor amount of Mac2 positive cells that resembled the non-treated control mice. these results suggest that the attenuating effect of Gp41 TMD was systemic rather than tissue specific, with high specific effects on monocytes and macrophages. the TMD of TLR2 regulates its function in response to natural and synthetic ligands. the ENV TMD possesses a GxxxG motif, which is well defined as a membrane dimerization motif. however, it is conceivable that the GxxxG motif of the TLR2 and TLR6 TMDs move in a piston mechanism. several studies have linked the activation of TLR cascades to viral replication and burst. several studies have linked the activation of TLR cascades to viral replication and burst. the ENV TMD inhibits the activation of TLR2 signaling by interacting with its TMD. this property could be of great importance during fusion and serves as an additional mean of regulation of the activity of TLR at stages of Env expression. this property could be of great importance during fusion and serves as an additional mean of regulation of the activity of TLR. s were incubated with the peptide for 5 hrs (TNF) or 12 hours (IL-6, MCP-1) at 37\u00b0C. samples of the media were collected and stored at 20\u00b0C. fluorescence experiments were performed with pairs of peptides using 4-Fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD, BioChemika) -labeled peptides as donors and rhodamine-labeled peptides as acceptors. maximum FRET values were obtained by calculating changes in the emission of the donor peptide at 530 nm. the desired TM sequences are inserted between these two protein sequences using standard cloning techniques. the resulting plasmids were transformed into an SU202 E. coli strain, which then expressed the LexA-TM-MalE fusion proteins (after induction with 1 mM IPTG) -buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, pH = 7.0, 10% chloroform, 1% -mercaptoethanol) was lysed with 50 L of 2% SDS in Z-buffer. strong dimerization results in strong inhibition of -gal expression. qPCR Gene Expression The following sequences were used for quantitative mRNA analysis. plasmid gp41 encodes a HIV-1 gp41 fusion protein with the c-terminal external parts of the protein replaced by a Yellow Fluorescent Protein. 12-week-old C57 Black female mice were injected IP with 50 mg/kg of S.aureus LTA and 800 g/kgof D-galactosamine. blood samples were collected for TNF and IL-6 serum levels measurements. blood samples were collected by blood coagulation in RT followed by spin down centrifugation. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids and antibiotics. at the following day, media were replaced by fresh DMEM, including all supplements. surface expression of untagged gp160 was analyzed using immunofluorescence. cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. spectra were scanned using a thermostatic quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. average recording time was 15 s, in 1 nm steps, through wavelength range of 195\u2013260 nm. expression vectors and E. coli strains required for the assay were provided by Dr. Dirk Schneider. TM homo-oligomer formation does not interfere with the measurement of hetero-association. the hybrid promoter is designed to bind only the wt and mutant heterodimers. in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (RIPA) 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS. protein concentration measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) plasmid p96ZM651gp160-CD5-opt was obtained through NIH AIDS Reagent Program. plasmid encodes a HIV-1 gp41 fusion protein with the c-terminal external parts of the protein replaced by a Yellow Fluorescent Protein.
