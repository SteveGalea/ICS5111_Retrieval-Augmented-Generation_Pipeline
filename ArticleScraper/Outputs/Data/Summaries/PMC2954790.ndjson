{"summary": "structured EMR data could be coupled with computerized processing of free-text clinical entries to enhance detection of acute respiratory infections. a manual review of EMR records related to 15,377 outpatient visits uncovered 280 reference cases of ARI. the increasing availability of electronic health data offers the opportunity to enhance public health surveillance for infectious diseases. early electronic surveillance efforts have collected codified diagnoses, chief complaints, school absenteeism, over-the-counter medication sales and other independent data streams. a surveillance system rooted in the electronic medical record (EMR) could provide early and nuanced illness detection compared to current-generation SSS. results study Population The Maryland (n = 5,127) and the Utah (n = 10,250) study samples were representative of their respective outpatient populations and included mostly male veterans. the Utah population was more than 90% Caucasian, whereas almost half of the Maryland veterans were African American (Table 1). records identified a total of 280 ARI cases. ARI incidence during the 6-month study period was lower at the UT site (1.3%) than at the MD site (2.8%). patients over the age of 70 represented 46% of the study sample but only 21% of ARI cases. 82 34 Myalgia or Arthralgia 22.9 81 59 38 Headache 19.6 73 38 42 Chest Pain-Pleuritic 8.2 91 48 22 Gastrointestinal* 16.4 91 67 35 Shortness of Breath 12.9 92 81 17 Malaise/Fatigue 10.7 90 87 20 Chest Pain-Non Pleuritic 5.4 93 60 27 Lymph node enlargement 2.1 0 67 67 Neurological CBC/Diff stands for complete blood count with differential white blood cell count. for each vital sign, \u201cabnormal\u201d was defined as: temperature 38\u00b0C, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, heart rate 100 beats per minute. for each vital sign, \u201cabnormal\u201d was defined as follows: temperature 38\u00b0C, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, heart rate 100 beats per minute. five EMR parameters could improve ARI case detection when added to the VA ICD-9 codes. orders for cough remedies, CBC, gram stains of respiratory secretions, blood cultures and a temperature 38\u00b0C were significant at both study sites. the blood culture parameter alone (CDA 5) or the addition of CBC and gram stains to other parameters were significant at one site, but not at the other. ARI CDAs That Use Free-Text EMR Entries The Text-only CDA was as sensitive as a CDA that best combined ICD-9 codes with other structured clinical parameters. the \u201cVA ICD-9 codes\u201d could be coupled through an OR operand to bring sensitivities up from 88% (CDA 10) to 97\u201399% (CDAs 11 and 12). CDAs 3-12 seek increasing sensitivity; CDA 13-16 seek increasing PPV. a Text-only CDA achieved a higher sensitivity for ILI than its ICD-9-only counterpart. despite specificities of 91-96%, both detection approaches yielded PPVs in the 2\u20133% range. restricting cases retrieved through ICD-9 codes or text analysis increased the PPV more than 10-fold without decreasing sensitivity. requiring patients to simultaneously satisfy the ICD-9 codes, text and temperature parameters maximized the PPV (68%) while keeping sensitivity above 70%. 206,561 Study Sample n = 5,127 ARI Cases n = 142 Patient Base n = 47,257 Study Sample n = 10,250 ARI Cases n = 138 Age 21 y 0.2 0 0 0.3 0 0 21\u201330 y 2.3 1.7 3.5 4.5 1.1 3.6 31\u201340 y 7.9 4.7 11.3 5.5 2.7 3.6 41\u201350 y 15.9 14.9 28.2 9.1 7.5 13 ARI cases amounted to less than 1% of visits to routine care areas. location of care % of total ARI cases % of visits with ARI emergency room 12.9 58.6 8.3 Same-day Appointments 2.1 8.6 7.5 Telephone Care 11.2 13.2 2.1 Routine (Primary Care) 6.3 1.1 0.2 Cough was the most commonly documented symptom of ARI (88% of cases), followed by fever/chills/night sweats (58%) and so ARI CDAs That Use Structured EMR Parameters Six of the EMR parameters considered were either not found or present in only one ARI patient. the overall frequency at which other EMR parameters occurred at both sites is shown in Table 4. Incidence of orders and abnormal vital signs in ARI patients. iff stands for complete blood count with differential white blood cell count. for each vital sign, \u201cabnormal\u201d was defined as follows: temperature 38\u00b0C, respiratory rate 22 breath per minute, heart rate 100 beats per minute. CDAs that did not include ICD-9 codes achieved a peak sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 69%. the addition of CBC and gram stains to other parameters (e.g. CDA 9) were significant at one site, but not at the other. ARI CDAs that combine parameters derived from structured EMR entries can be coupled through an OR operand to bring sensitivities up. losses in specificity halved positive predictive value (PPV) that had been obtained with CDA that used ICD-9 codes alone. resulting CDAs exhibited low sensitivities (e.g. 6%, CDA 13, and 38%, CDA 14). a text-only CDA achieved a higher sensitivity for ILI than its ICD-9 counterpart. despite specificities of 91-96%, both detection approaches yielded PPVs in the 2\u20133% range. the results support our hypothesis that judicious use of information contained in the EMR can improve early disease detection compared to the sole use of diagnostic codes. most (78%) of our ARI patients had normal vital signs and thus probably suffered from mild, uncomplicated ARI [21]. the majority of patients who satisfied our case definition were seeking health services despite a mostly mild illness. we used a manual abstraction of respiratory symptoms from the EMR as a reference standard to uncover cases of ARI. this case-finding method may have underestimated the absolute incidence of ARI encounters. but the abstraction relied on information committed to a real-world EMR. study revisits similar parameters, adds new ones not yet formally investigated. it was made possible because EMR-derived parameters were not used as independent data streams. new prescriptions directed at the symptom of cough and elevation in measured body temperature recorded in an EMR field dedicated to vital signs. providers did not order blood tests or chest imaging in 73% of ARI patients. a parsimonious ILI CDA increased PPV by an order of magnitude. a parsimonious ICD-9 code set optimized for ILI could narrow this performance gap. study showed a temporal correlation between total daily ILI counts obtained using text analysis, queries of structured EMR data, categories of chief complaints or influenza isolates. despite challenges with non-standard grammar and abbreviations, spelling mistakes, lack of punctuation, copy-and-pasting, personal templates and checklists, our reference review allowed us to provide insight into the performance of free-text mining per se. limitations may limit the generalizability of our results. a) the veterans study population is mostly male and excludes the pediatric population, a key target for ARI surveillance. b) veterans health care utilization may differ from that observed in uninsured or privately insured individuals. reference review allowed an evaluation of a stalwart component of SSS, ICD-9 diagnostic codes. additions of only a few codes improved detection sensitivity and specificity. findings reinforce results obtained in adult and pediatric emergency room populations [23], [24] a broad field of candidate structured EMR entries found two that could complement ICD-9 codes to detect patients with ARI. new prescriptions directed at the symptom of cough and an elevation in measured body temperature recorded in an EMR field dedicated to vital signs. the practical difficulty is to devise database queries that will continue to reflect the concept of \u201ccough remedies\u201d. we acknowledge that an ICD-9 code set optimized for ILI could narrow this performance gap. but our observations that more diagnostic tests are ordered with increasing vital signs abnormalities raise the prospect that as disease severity increases, so will the value of the structured EMR data. simplest explanation for why providers didn't order tests for viral ARI is that neither were felt to offer a meaningful therapeutic impact in non-hospitalized patients during our study period. a simple approach to free-text analysis found ARI cases with a sensitivity (88%) and a specificity (93%, CDA 10) not dissimilar to what could be reached with structured parameters (e.g. CDA 8). combining the results through an \u201cAND\u201d logical operand yielded near-perfect sensitivity, albeit at the cost of a much reduced PPV. optimal CDAs could differ outside the respiratory infection season, or during periods of heightened apprehension for an influenza epidemic. 3) factors related to our iterative CDA development process, which may have over adapted CDAs to VA's particular EMR implementation. participants We randomly sampled outpatient clinical encounters from October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004 at VA Maryland (VAMHCS) and at VA Salt Lake City (VASLCHCS) health care systems. we limited our sampling to outpatient care areas where at least two encounters were assigned ICD-9 codes related to ARI. a panel of specialists in pulmonary and infectious diseases arbitrated cases where there was disagreement. sample size was adjusted so that we could reach 140 reference ARI cases at each study site. a goal estimated by the need to have sufficient power to perform a regression analysis. cough remedies (from VANF) drug classes RE-200, -301, -302, -502, -503, -503, -507, -508, -513, -516, or codeine) antiemetics (from VANF GA-700), antidiarrheals (from VANF GA-400), influenza-targeting antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors or adamantanes) ARI CDAs were developed independently for each study site. the clinician-selected parameters were reduced to include only those that contributed significantly to detection of reference ARI cases using backward elimination logistic regression with 95% confidence intervals. a clinical note related to an index visit contained non-negated strings. the index visit was labeled as 'positive' for the presence of ARI. we used the publicly available NegEx version 2 algorithm. participants We randomly sampled outpatient clinical encounters from October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004 at VA Maryland (VAMHCS) and at VA Salt Lake City (VASLCHCS) health care systems. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of the participating VA health systems. a trained abstractor reviewed all EMR entries during the calendar day of each index outpatient encounter for documentation indicative of ARI. predefined ARI symptoms and signs were recorded individually on an abstraction instrument (MS Access, Microsoft Corp., Redmond WA) all uncovered ARI cases and a 10% random sub-sample of negative records were re-reviewed by a physician. s from the research team systematically reviewed and adjucated structured or semi-structured EMR parameters that could potentially identify patients with ARI. the parameters chosen were: a) ICD-9 diagnostic code(s) included in the existing \u201crespiratory\u201d groupings from SSS of national scope. antidiarrheals (from VANF GA-400), influenza-targeting antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors or adamantanes) and alternative groupings of antibacterials. the three antibiotics most commonly associated with an encounter ascribed an ICD-9 code from the ESSENCE grouping at both sites. aike's Information Criterion, Wald's Chi Square Test, Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic, and drop-in-deviance. the performance of retained CDAs was summarized with standard statistical descriptors. previous analyses for selected case detectors were performed on the 80% subset. the list includes 186 synonyms, term variants, and common misspellings. we searched for the text strings identified above in the full text of all EMR clinical notes completed on the calendar day. the list
