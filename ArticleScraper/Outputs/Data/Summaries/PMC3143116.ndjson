{"summary": "study of past spread and discussion about potential mitigation efforts has led to a significant body of literature investigating the use of mathematical models to predict global pathogen spread. the discrete populations themselves are subdivided in terms of infection status with compartments for susceptible, incubating, infectious, and recovered individuals. in the migration model, travelers represent migrants, mixing the populations of the two cities, City A and B. in each model, individuals may progress through the infection stages (red arrows), the rates of which may be city-dependent. exposure occurs via mass action, i.e. that all susceptible individuals in a given location are exposed with the same probability to the infectious agent. this simplification underestimates long-distance travel, because no one can fly between cities that are not directly connected. limiting travel in this way may lead to alteration and truncation of the pattern of spread, especially when transmission risk is heterogeneous across the network. incubating and infectious compartments included sub-compartments to allow more realistic incorporation of the time periods spent in each [22]. the rates of effective contact, time to progression to the infectious compartment, and time to recovery are based on previous studies. we compared the base models, which allow individuals to travel regardless of infection status, with models in which infectious individuals do not travel. we also assessed three different travel network parameters: seat-based direct-travel only, connecting-travel-inclusive and a skewed version of the connecting-travel. each model includes 141 cities selected to represent a realistic sample network with varied connectivity and population sizes. each city in the model had susceptible, incubating, infectious, and recovered/immune compartments, with separate compartments for residents and travelers. humans are dependent on estimated effective contact rates [27], [28] and the prevalence of infectious vectors. we compared the base, \u201ctraveler\u201d models with \u201cmigration\u201d models. we assumed that all travelers immediately mixed with local populations upon arrival in a new city. the origin city was selected from the subset of cities containing vector populations and was used for simulated epidemics of both the directly transmitted and the vector-borne pathogens. the same city was used as the origin city for the directly transmitted model. the empirical cumulative probability of the first autochthonous transmission event in a single city in a single model. the solid lines are for a more distal city. A. is the directly transmitted pathogen and B. is the vector-borne pathogen. the final epidemic size was slightly decreased in the migration model. incubating and infectious (red), and recovered (blue) in the migration model over time. Approximately 20% of the population is replaced by incoming susceptibles between the two epidemics. in the no-infectious-travel models, the final epidemic size was slightly decreased (mean difference: 0.018%, 95% CI: 0.028\u20130.007%) for the directly transmitted pathogen, and was unchanged (mean difference: 0.018%, 95% CI: 0.028\u20130.007%) under the direct-travel model, spread to the nine cities occurred on average 10.5 days (95% CI: 10.1\u201311.0 days) later. vector populations were delayed by an average of 188 days (95% CI: 181\u2013196 days) for one city, introduction was sporadic, occurring in only 40 of the 100 simulations. compared to the connecting-travel model, the epidemics affected 1.9% (95% CI: 1.6\u20132.1%) more people. in the tropical cities by 0.26% (0.23\u20130.29%) Temporary travel versus migration We contrasted two different model designs, one treating all travelers as migrants and one treating them as temporary travelers. for the directly transmitted pathogen, the pathogen introduction caused a pandemic. the migration model allowed continued mixing of the population leading to susceptible replenishment in affected cities. once the initial outbreak subsided, 18.0% (95%CI: 17.6\u201318.3%) of that population was replaced by immigrating susceptibles within one year. this replenishment led to recurrent outbreaks. blocking the interaction of travelers staying in hotels with mosquitoes reduced spread by an average of 11 days (95% CI: 9\u201313 days) blocking traveler-associated transmission in homes slowed spread by 5.5 days (95% CI: 3.8\u20137.3 days) and decreased final epidemic size by 0.36% (95% CI: 0.35\u20130.37%) for 42 (30%) of the 141 cities, spread was faster (Figure 4A), for 90 cities (64%), slower (Figures 4B and 4C), and for 9 cities (6%), there was no significant difference. average epidemic size was unchanged (95% CI: 0.040\u20130.008%) spread occurred approximately 1.6 days earlier in the skewed-travel model for the directly transmitted pathogen. in non-tropical cities, epidemic size did not change (95% CI: 0.006\u20130.015%), but in tropical cities, average epidemic size increased by 0.57% (95% CI: 0.52\u20130.62%) the direct-travel-only model assumes that every seat is potentially used by a direct traveler as opposed to a connecting traveler. this overestimation of direct travel increases the overall volume of travel and thus leads to greater local replenishment of susceptibles. this phenomenon takes on added importance when transmission is spatially heterogeneous. pathogen by an average of 188 days was spatially heterogeneous. a single city was directly connected to the origin city. four cities were not directly connected to any other city with a vector population. skewed travel did not significantly impact the speed of spread. incubating and infectious stages are less than the average duration of stay (18 days), so some travelling individuals will recover before returning home. with shorter durations of infection or longer stays, the rate of spread will decrease, and with longer durations of infection and shorter stay, it will increase. the challenge lies in the parameterization of the travel network. assuming that travelers only travel between cities connected by direct flights biased the speed of spread in both models. truncation may result from spatial heterogeneity in pathogen transmission. the importance of travel network assumptions is particularly important in the presence of geographic heterogeneity. in future modeling efforts, we suggest at minimum assessing the sensitivity to the structural changes considered here, in particular those related to infectious travelers and treating travelers as temporary visitors rather than migrants. in the traveler model, this proportion is reduced by half because only half of the travelers are outgoing residents; the other half are visitors returning to their home. Adding heterogeneity to exposure among travelers also led to delayed introduction by an average of 3.8 and 3.9 days. skewed travel caused a slightly increased speed of spread in models of the directly transmitted pathogen. this likely resulted from the fact that the origin city was a non-tropical city and thus infected residents were more likely to leave. travel for infectious individuals is a structural and parameterization issue. for pathogens causing severe disease, it may be completely realistic for no infectious individuals to travel. but for pathogens associated with mild disease or asymptomatic infection, infectious individuals may travel at the same rate as any other individual. characterization of global air travel requires a substantial sample of global itineraries with accompanying data. it is critical to know where people truly travel (actual origin and destination), how long they stay in their destination and how travel patterns vary throughout the year. 0.4KB, docx."}
