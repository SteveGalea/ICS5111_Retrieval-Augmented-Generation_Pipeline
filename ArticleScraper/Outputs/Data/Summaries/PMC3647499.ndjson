{"summary": "185 neonatal piglets on 3 farms were experiencing scouring problems. the farms were located at 2 geographic locations in western Australia. at the time of the study, 50%\u201380% of litters were scouring, with death rates of 11%\u201314%. toxin profiling was by PCR detection of the toxin A (tcdA), toxin B (tcdB), and binary toxin (cdt) genes (7,8). Isolates underwent PCR ribotyping and were compared with human reference C. difficile strains. 185 piglets tested were force-fed 1 107 spores of the same strains used in the Vero cell assays. mice were housed in separate cages to avoid cross-contamination and monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease. strains AI35 and VPI10463 produced 25-fold less toxin B than the ribotype 027 and ribotype 078 isolates. in vitro testing showed AI35 produced 25-fold less toxin B than did the ribotype 027 (p = 0.0354 by t test) and ribotype 078 (p = 0.0074 by t test) isolates, but AI35 showed similar toxin levels to the low toxin producing strain 630 a toxigenic strain circulating in piglets in australia is of a different ribotype, 237, than that commonly found in other parts of the world. the strain contained a unique PaLoc and produced more weight loss in mice than did the more common ribotype 078 animal strain."}
