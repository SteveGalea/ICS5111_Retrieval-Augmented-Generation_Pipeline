{"summary": "human rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) top the list, but recently discovered or re-emerging viruses contribute to acute wheezing in infancy. most viral infections are not associated with acute exacerations, and cofactors, including allergic inflammation and airway bacteria, have been described that increase the severity of infection. early treatment of asthma exacerbation is considered the best strategy for management. increases in eosinophilic inflammatory markers have been shown to be good predictors of asthma exacerbations. in the short term, RSV-induced bronchiolitis is associated with longer hospitalization than RV-induced bronchiolitis. there is a strong likelihood of RSV reinfection in the absence of ongoing passive immunity. more severe RSV illnesses in early childhood increase the risk of asthma development. RV enters the body through the respiratory route and infects and replicates in epithelial cells. one of the proposed reasons why asthmatics are predisposed to viral infection is damaged epithelium. cellular mechanisms involved in this response include increased intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on respiratory epithelial cells. RV-C types bind to cadherin-related protein-3 (CDHR3). corresponding gene has been linked to childhood asthma associated with wheezing episodes in early life. RSV-A is associated with more severe illness, while RSV-B has been characterized as the milder strain. IFN- and TNF- levels were significantly lower in RSV-induced asthma exacerbation when compared to asthmatics infected with influenza. weaker Th1 response during viral infection may lead to reduced viral clearance and prolonged and/or more serious disease. EV-D includes 3 serotypes known to cause disease in humans: EV-D68, EV-D70, and EV-D94.53. EV-D68 has emerged in the past decade as an important respiratory pathogen. it is of special note in children with asthma. some children may have genetic risk factors for wheezing with RV26 or with RSV. many commonly used polymerase chain reaction tests cannot distinguish RV from other EV (e.g., EV-D68) RV infection also induces pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), IL-, regulated on activation normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) RV-induced asthma exacerbation can also be associated with increases in airway eosinophils (Eos) RSV infection of the airway induces airway inflammation and can promote airway hyperresponsiveness. airway epithelial cells initially respond to RSV infection by releasing type I IFNs, IL-12, IL-18,42 and a variety of cytokines and chemokines. eotaxin levels correlate closely with eosinophil degranula-tion in pediatric asthma. chemokine receptor CCR550 binds a number of inflammatory CC-chemokines. gene-environment interactions may contribute to susceptibility to virus-induced disease. in children with asthma, the severity of RV infection is positively related to the probability of exacerbation. EV-D68 may have gene mutations that influence antigenicity or trophism for lower airway cells. studies of children with allergic asthma treated with omalizumab show that neutralizing immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated inflammation can lead to improvements in IFN responses and reduced virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. this suggests that IgE-mediated inflammation can inhibit antiviral responses and increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. RV infections can promote increased detection of bacterial pathogens. the combination of RV infection with detection of respiratory pathogens is associated with a greater risk for illness, including exacerbation of asthma. studies have shown that viral infections precede bacterial infections of the upper and lower airways and may affect disease severity. this may occur for several reasons, including virus-induced expression of airway receptors used by bacteria for cell invasion and disruption of airway epithelial layers. patients with stable asthma have even exhibited increased colonization of upper and lower airways. repeated antibiotic therapy could have adverse effects on commensal bacteria. more research is needed on long-term effects of this approach. infections with several respiratory viruses contribute to asthma exacerbation."}
