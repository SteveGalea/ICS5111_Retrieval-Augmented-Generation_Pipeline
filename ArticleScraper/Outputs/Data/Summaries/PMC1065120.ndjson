{"summary": "several countries have developed national horizon scanning systems to identify and monitor new technologies. the outputs of major health technology assessment centres, national regulatory authorities, and recognized scientific news sources (Table 1) were systematically searched for developments relevant to acute and critical care. this was combined with a manual medical literature search. areas of research range from outpatient, 'office'-based and patient self-testing to in-hospital diagnostics. rapid access analysis of traditionally laboratory bound diagnostics and direct patient imaging are particularly relevant to critical care clinicians. the first major prospective study of tight glucose control in sepsis introduced a novel algorithm requiring frequent measurements [6], which raised concerns over patient safety and resource utilization in general ICUs. a subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor system (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System; Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) was tested against clamp controlled hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic excursions in volunteers [7] developments include the use of adenylate kinase assay for accelerated laboratory based identification of drug-resistant bacteria. developments include the use of adenylate kinase assay for accelerated laboratory based identification of drug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. clinical management of sepsis is normally outside the remit of this section of the journal. new mechanical technology has been applied to the direct treatment of sepsis rather than to cardiovascular or tissue perfusion monitoring. clinical management of sepsis is normally outside the remit of the journal. a commercial artificial intelligence inference engine is used to extract and structure information from standard paediatric textbooks. it is now being modified to encompass adult critical illness. a review of decision support systems by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence is pending. ICUs provide complex, time-sensitive care to highly dependent patients. they therefore require the successful convergence of multiple hospital systems. the currently stated UK NPfIT vision is that all ICU subsystems, including networked monitoring, telemetry and audit systems, will eventually be integrated into NPfIT. critical care is a distillation of acute hospital practice. any health care technology that has an impact on diagnosis, monitoring, and management of acute conditions will be of heightened importance."}
