{"summary": "infection of humans with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus is associated with mortality in excess of 60% [1]. avian H9N2 Quail/HK/G1/97 (H9N2/G1) virus is one of the precursor viruses of the highly pathogenic H5N1/97 virus. macrophages from MKP-1 deficient mice show prolong activation of p38MAPK and enhanced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6. PP2A suppresses activation of p38MAPK and the upstream kinases of MAPK signaling pathways. PBMac were mock-treated or infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2. p38MAPK-mediated hyperinduction of TNF-alpha is mediated by the activation of p38MAPK. the levels of p38MAPK phosphorylations induced by H9N2/G1 were higher than those of ERK1/2. PBMac were mock-treated or infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2. Total RNA, culture supernatant or cell lysates were collected. h.p.i. were examined by TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. the relative TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels in the SB203580-treated cells compared to the mock-treated cells. H9N2/G1 Virus did not alter the cellular protein levels of p38MAPK. expression levels of MKP-1 and PP2A catalytic subunit were not affected by H9N2/G1 and H1N1 infections. PP2A expressions are dispensable to the p38MAPK activity in PBMac. the activity of PP2A induced by H9N2/G1 was abrogated by okadaic acid (OA), a selective PP2A inhibitor, at 25 nM. PBMac were treated with OA at the indicated concentrations. PBMac were mock-treated or treated with 25 nM okadaic acid (OA) for 30 min prior to H9N2/G1 infection. at 2 h.p.i., cell lysates were collected and the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK were determined by using Western blot analysis. the total RNA samples were then harvested and the TNF-alpha levels were quantified by using quantitative RT-PCR. PP2A is a Negative Regulator in H9N2/G1-Induced p38MAPK Activation and TNF-Alpha Expression. p38MAPK was not activated in PBMac with OA treatment only. PP2A played a role in damping the p38MAPK-mediated TNF-alpha production in PBMac with H9N2/G1 infection. we measured the PP2A activity in H1N1-and H9N2/G1-infected PBMac at 2 h.p.i. phosphorylated p38MAPK was detected by using Western blot analysis. total protein lysates were harvested at 2 h.p.i. and phosphorylated p38MAPK was detected by using Western blot analysis. H9N2/G1 did not induce PP2A expression indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK. despite the activation of PP2A, the levels of p38MAPK phosphorylation and subsequent TNF-alpha production were still much higher than those in cells with H1N1 infection. avian influenza viruses including H5N1 and H9N2/G1 induce high levels of TNF-alpha production in macrophages. p38MAPK-mediated hyperinduction of TNF-alpha is, in large part, mediated by the activation of p38MAPK. PBMac were mock-treated or infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 virus at a multiplicity of infection. the levels of p38MAPK phosphorylations induced by H9N2/G1 were higher than those of ERK1/2. PBMac were mock-treated or infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 at a multiplicity of infection. levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein at 3 h.p.i. and 16 h.p.i. were measured by ELISA. PBMac were treated with SB203580 at the indicated doses for 30 min. levels of p38MAPK were significantly suppressed by SB203580. H9N2/G1 Virus did not induce expression of MKP-1 from 0.5 to 4 h.p.i. expression levels of MKP-1 and PP2A catalytic subunit were not affected by H9N2/G1 and H1N1 infections. previous reports have shown that HIV or coronavirus induces MKP-1 expression which in turn modulate the excessive production of cytokines in virus-infected cells. PP2A expressions were not modulated by H9N2/G1- or H1N1-infected PBMac. cytotoxicity of OA in PBMac was examined. PBMac were treated with the indicated doses of OA for 30 min prior to H9N2/G1 infection. at 2 h.p.i., cell lysates were collected and the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK were determined by using Western blot analysis. PBMac were treated with DMSO or 25 nM OA for 3 h. total RNA samples were then harvested and the TNF-alpha levels were quantified. PP2A is a Negative Regulator in H9N2/G1-Induced p38MAPK Activation. PP2A played a role in damping the p38MAPK-mediated TNF-alpha production in PBMac with H9N2/G1 infection. we measured the PP2A activity in H1N1- and H9N2/G1-infected PBMac at 2 h.p.i. phosphorylated p38MAPK was detected by using Western blot analysis. total protein lysates were harvested at 2 h.p.i. and phosphorylated p38MAPK was detected by using Western blot analysis. PP2A may not be the targets of p38MAPK in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways. despite the activation of PP2A, levels of p38MAPK phosphorylation and subsequent TNF-alpha production were still much higher than those in cells with H1N1 infection. this high level of p38MAPK phosphorylation raises a question on its roles in the virus infection. antibodies against p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA) specific inhibitors against p38MAPK and PP2A (okadaic acid) were purchased from Merck Millipore. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with oligo primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. levels of mRNA encoding TNF-alpha were assayed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays. PP2A activity was carried out by malachite green-based PP2A Immunoprecipitation Phosphatase Assay Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) the cells were collected by scrapers, sonicated three times for 10 s on ice and then centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. monocytes were differentiated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated autologous plasma. differentiated macrophages were obtained after culturing for 14 days. influenza viruses including A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2/G1) and A/Hong Kong/54/98 (H1N1) were grown in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells. aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 g/mL pepstatin, 2 g/mL leupeptin and 10 mM sodium fluoride. cDNA synthesized from total RNA with oligo (dT) primers. levels of mRNA encoding TNF-alpha were assayed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays. PP2A activity was carried out by malachite green-based PP2A Immunoprecipitation Phosphatase Assay Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) PP2A activity was carried out by malachite green-based PP2A Immunoprecipitation Phosphatase assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol."}
