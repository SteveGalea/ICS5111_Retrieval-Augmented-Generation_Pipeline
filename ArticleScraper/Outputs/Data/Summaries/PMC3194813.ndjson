{"summary": "human enterovirus (HEVs) are a genus of (+)ssRNA viruses. they are among the most common human viruses, causing a wide range of acute diseases, such as upper respiratory tract infection, febrile rash, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis and severe chronic disorders. the prevalence and clinical significance of HEVs are further manifested by multiple outbreaks of the hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Asia. we present a novel classification method based on information derived from the whole genome sequences of HEVs instead of specific genes. we have previously demonstrated that each organism has a unique barcode image; and more closely related genomes generally have more similar barcodes. barcodes provide a good tool for visualizing genomes, but also allow easy comparisons between different genomes. we have calculated the barcodes for a total of 838 human ssRNA virus genomes of four families, namely HIV (279), Rabies virus (63), SARS coronavirus (101) and HEVs (395). the x-axis is the list of all unique combinations of 4-mers. the y-axis is same kind of virus joint genome axis contracted by 2,000 fold. the gray level shows the frequency of each k-mer within a 2,000 bp window in the corresponding location. the red dots represent HEVs (395 genomes), the blue ones for HIV (279 genomes), the magenta ones for SARS coronavirus (101 genomes) and the cyan ones for rabies virus genomes (63 genomes). the blue dots represent poliovirus (78 genomes), the green ones for echovirus (52 genomes), the red ones for new virus strain enterovirus 68-71 (72 genomes), and the magenta ones for coxsackievirus A the difference between the two classification results is whether HEVs of serotype CVA1, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 or 24 should be grouped together with EV68, 70 and 94 or PV1, 2 and 3. the reason causing these differences is that we can obtain some more information from a whole genome view. serotypes barcode based Comparison 1 EV71(82), CV-A2 to A7(1), CV-A10(1), CV-A12(1), CV-A14(1), CV-A16(3) HEV-1 HEV-A Exact match 2 CV-A9(1), CV-B1(1), CV-B2(3), CV-B3(15) barcode-based method has the metagenome binning property, which can be found in previous paper[29]. this method is at least as good as the widely used specific gene-based phylogeny reconstruction algorithm. barcodes of one representative genome for each of the five virus families reflect sizes of the joint sequence of the same kind of virus. it should be noted that regardless whether a virus is DNA (Hepatitis B virus) or RNA virus (HIV, Rabies virus, SARS coronavirus, e) its genome has this barcode property. x-axis for each plot is the distance between the feature vector of each virus' barcode and the average feature vector of all the viruses we used. red dots represent HEVs (395 genomes), the blue ones for HIV (279 genomes), the magenta ones for SARS coronavirus (101 genomes) and the cyan ones for rabies virus genomes (63 genomes). phylogenetic tree we constructed based on the VP1 gene of HEVs using the MEGA Clustal-W alignment and neighbor joining clustering method [31], which groups the HEVs into four clads, named HEV-A through D. Clearly the two trees are largely in agreement except for some CV-A strains, giving rise to a consistency level at 93.4%. the difference between the two classification results is whether HEVs of serotype CVA1, the edge lengths in the trees reflect the genetic distance calculated according to the Kimura-parameter model. the VP1-based tree's reliability was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap replications. the serotype names beside the trees denote what the serotypes of the species having HEVs. the next generation high-throughput sequencing technique is developing. we hope this genome featured method could be wildly used as more and more whole genome sequences have been generated. this method is at least as good as the widely used specific gene-based phylogeny reconstruction. the information of these five classes of viruses' genome sequences is given in Table 2. the information of these five classes of viruses' complete genome sequences is given in Table 2. Table 2. Information of five classes of viruses' complete genome sequences. codes are calculated as the Euclidean distance between the corresponding 136-dimensional vectors. for two such matrices M1 and M2 with K columns and L rows, we defined their barcode distance as. for details, we refer the reader to [29]. ith 4-mer and its reverse complement are more reliable and accurate in classifying organisms. we mapped k-mer frequencies to grey levels so we can generate a barcode image for a whole genome. the distance between two barcodes is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the corresponding 136-dimensional vectors."}
