{"summary": "the pandemic was a test of global preparedness to assess the epidemiology of a pandemic and to respond appropriately and rapidly. the pandemic hampered international efforts to mount an appropriate response. rapid assessment of the epidemiologic, virologic and clinic features of a pandemic is essential to provide critical information to decision-makers. population is well characterized in terms of demographic structure, particularly by ethnicity and socio-economic status. indigenous maori and Pacific peoples (collectively about 20% of the population) appear particularly vulnerable to influenza and other respiratory infections. RT-PCR assays for 8 respiratory viruses for all SARI and ILI patients. simultaneous testing by real-time RT-PCR assays for 8 respiratory viruses for all SARI and ILI patients. serology can detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, thus estimating the true incidence of influenza infection. serology can detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, thus estimating the true incidence of influenza infection. aetiology SHIVERS provides an integrated platform for the study of respiratory diseases caused by influenza. the aetiological component allows us to monitor antigenic drift of seasonal influenza viruses, contributing to WHO's annual vaccine strain selection. there is increasing evidence in the literature for the importance of polymicrobial infections. SHIVERS provides robust and timely estimations of the protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccine in the prevention of hospitalizations. there are international calls for more rigorous VE studies. the 2009 pandemic in NZ revealed that the risk of hospitalization and death was markedly higher for Maori and Pacific people. however, it is not clear whether these socio-demographic factors are independent risk factors for influenza. some chronic health conditions have been shown to increase the risk of having a poor outcome from influenza infection. virologically confirmed cases would vastly underestimate influenza incidence and overestimate severity. aetiology SHIVERS provides an integrated platform for the study of respiratory diseases caused by influenza. there is increasing evidence in the literature for the importance of polymicrobial infections. vaccine effectiveness Influenza vaccine strain selection requires annual consultations and frequent updates to match the antigenic drift of the circulating viral strains. many VE estimates derive from observational studies with existing data collecting systems which often have multiple limitations and biases. individuals with serologically defined influenza infection will provide evidence to inform decisions on targeted pharmaceutical (vaccinations, antivirals), healthcare (e.g. improved treatment of comorbidities) and non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the risk of seasonal and pandemic influenza. elderly people have a significantly higher risk of influenza-associated death compared with non-elderly people. a wide spectrum of socio-economic, cultural, ethnic and demographic groups broadly similar to the new Zealand population. in 2012, we began active, prospective, continuous, population-based surveillance for influenza and other respiratory pathogens among persons residing in the two DHBs hospitalized for respiratory disease. a systematic sample of about 50% of non-SARI patients was also interviewed and provided a respiratory sample. some SARI cases and non-SARI patients were also tested for a range of respiratory bacteria. GP/PN documented the components of the case definition that were present and recorded patients who met the case definition in an advanced electronic form designed for the practice management system (PMS) patient information already captured in the PMS was automatically retrieved, including demography, comorbidities, vaccination history and regular medication list. further data were captured by interviewing ILI patients regarding influenza vaccination obtained elsewhere, pregnancy and a clinician's judgement of obesity. sites SHIVERS study sites are located within two District Health Boards of the Auckland region of NZ: ADHB and CMDHB. this is a predominantly urban population of 906 000 people, with a wide spectrum of socio-economic, cultural, ethnic and demographic groups broadly similar to the new Zealand population. some SARI cases and non-SARI patients were also tested for a range of respiratory bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza) by blood culture, urinary antigen test and PCR. a respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab) was collected to test for influenza and other respiratory viruses by real-time RT-PCR (Figure3). GP/PN documented the components of the case definition that were present and recorded patients who met the ILI case definition in an advanced electronic form designed for the practice management system. the SARI case definition was designed to monitor trends in severe influenza disease and best capture the majority of influenza respiratory disease. the initial SARI case definition included the symptom onset of acute respiratory illness within 7 days. the initial SARI case definition included the symptom onset of acute respiratory illness within 7 days. the very young (0\u20134 years) and elderly (65 years) had the highest SARI-associated influenza hospitalization rates. a high rate of influenza-related hospitalizations and low vaccine uptake (6%) in young children (6 months to 4 years) from SHIVERS led the government to change vaccination policy by extending free influenza vaccination to those in this age group who have been hospitalized or have a history of significant respiratory illness. the disease burden of moderate influenza is estimated using data from SHIVERS ILI surveillance. the data on influenza disease burden will allow us to estimate direct medical costs and indirect societal costs. ILI-associated consultations and SARI-associated hospitalizations for RSV and rhinovirus show different socio-demographic patterns from that of influenza. both ILI- and SARI-associated RSV incidences were similar \u2013 high rates for very young (1 year and 1\u20134 years) followed by elderly (65 years) this presented a very different age-specific incidence profile from that of influenza. the ability to parse out immunological differences between severe and moderate influenza cases highlights the value of adding the active immunology study to the SHIVERS platforms. risk factors As NZ has a well-characterized socio-demographic distribution, socio-demographic risk factors can be characterized quite easily. the initial SARI case definition included the symptom onset of acute respiratory illness within 7 days. the initial SARI case definition included the symptom onset of acute respiratory illness within 7 days. however, the cost of testing was minimal. a pilot study in 2012 testing persons with respiratory disease who did not meet the SARI case definition showed that a small proportion (6%) of non-SARI patients were positive for influenza viruses, compared with 18% of SARI cases (manuscript in preparation) future work will further expand our knowledge of the burden of influenza in this important group potentially protected by maternal immunization. s were shown in preschoolers (aged 1\u20134 years), school-age children and adults (65 years), those of Asian ethnicity and those from least deprived socio-economic status (SES) groups. this was a different picture from SARI surveillance where SARI-associated influenza hospitalizations were more frequent in the very young (under 1 year), the elderly, Mori and Pacific peoples. Vaccine effectiveness SHIVERS surveillance platforms provided a systematic opportunity to estimate VE for the prevention of general practice visits and hospitalizations for RT-PCR-confirmed influenza from the same population in the same influenza season. the data in 2013 showed moderate effectiveness of influenza vaccine against medically attended and hospitalized influenza. SHIVERS will use the results obtained from hospital and sentinel general practice surveillance to disentangle the effect of ethnic and socio-economic gradients. there are limited data available on their distribution in the population. it is difficult to assess the importance of the risk factor data collected. the platforms established here are relevant not only for new Zealand policy, but also for the region and the world. it will provide robust systematic virologic, epidemiologic and vaccine effectiveness data on circulating pandemic or seasonal influenza viruses at a time when circulation in the northern Hemisphere is low. this could provide valuable information on all emergent respiratory pathogens that have some winter seasonality. authors participated in designing and implementing the SHIVERS project. authors have given final approval of the version to be published. authors declare they have no competing interests."}
