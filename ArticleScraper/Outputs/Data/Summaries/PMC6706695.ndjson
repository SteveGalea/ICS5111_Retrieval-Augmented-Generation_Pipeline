{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae, genus Gammacoronavirus (2\u20134) genetic diversity in coronaviruses is due to adaptive evolution caused by high mutation rates. six genotypes of IBV comprising 32 distinct viral lines have been described (7). next-generation paired-end sequencing (2 150 bp) was performed on a miSeq instrument using the 300-cycle miSeq reagent kit version 2 (Illumina, USA) Sequence data were assembled using a de novo approach and utilizing MIRA version 3.4.1 (10) within a customized workflow on the Galaxy platform (11), as described previously (12, 13) a preliminary BLAST comparison to the currently available full-length IBV genome sequences showed the highest nucleotide identity to the California strain Cal56b/1991 belonging to the GI-17 lineage (7, 15\u201317) there are no IBV reference full-genome sequences available for the DMV/1639 IBV strain isolates, only sequences of the S1 gene (8, 9) the rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 28.1% sites). the analysis involved 29 nucleotide sequences (sequences from the GI-27 lineage are included as an outgroup)."}
