{"summary": "Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a Gram negative rod-shaped bacterium. it causes the most devastating bacterial leaf blight disease in rice. Xoo is well known to produce a wide variety of virulence factors. xanthan is one of the most important virulence factors of this species. xanthan is a Gram negative bacterium. it produces a large amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) in its outer membrane. many plant-pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing (cell\u2013cell communication) to regulate expression of factors contributing to virulence. over 1 billion people are infected with intestinal nematodes, and many millions are infected with filarial nematodes, flukes, and tapeworms. Niclosamide has been successfully used as an orally bioavailable salicylanilide, with anthelmintic and potential antineoplastic activity. niclosamide can also inhibit the growth of bacterial plant pathogen Xoo. it increased the levels of salicylate and induced the expression of defense-related genes thereby suppressing the Xoo-induced leaf wilting. niclosamide has no detrimental effects on vegetative/reproductive growth. plant materials, growth conditions, chemicals and pathogen infestation rice (oryza sativa \u2018Nipponbare\u2019, japonica variety) were surface sterilized by agitation in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min, followed by washing thrice in demineralized water. seedlings were sprayed with 10 g/ml niclosamide at 4-day intervals. niclosamide was assessed for antibacterial activities against Xoo via in vitro turbidimeter test. the growth of the cultures was monitored by a Synergy H1 detector. the cells were gently washed three times with distilled water. the cells were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet (2 mL) for 15 min. biofilm formation was quantified by measuring absorbance at 570 nm. EPS production of Xoo in culture supernatants at 28\u00b0C for 72 h. precipitated EPS were pelleted via centrifugation, dried, and weighed. xanthomonadin measured by measuring absorbance at OD445. Xoo and E. coli grown up to log phase were treated with 5 g/ml of niclosamide for 12 h. untreated cells were used as a control. niclosamide, bismerthiazol and probenazole were generated from the SMILES notation in the Chemsketch Software1. the active sites of each protein were predicted by COFACTOR. the molecular docking of niclosamide was performed in Argus Lab 4.0.1 software. RNA purity was evaluated using a nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. all OD260/OD280 values of RNA were between 1.8 and 2.2. for each sample, 1 g RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Prime ScriptR\u00ae RT reagent kit. the IR spectra of niclosamide treated and untreated samples were recorded at the range of 4,000\u2013400 cm-1 using Nicolet 6700 Thermo Scientific spectrophotometer. the variations in the components of cell membrane were determined using OMNIC software 8.2 (thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) each sample was scanned with three different pellets under identical conditions. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae pathogens were grown in nutrient broth (NB) medium in conical flasks or 50 ml falcon tubes in a shaking incubator set at 28 1\u00b0C. NB medium contained the same components but lacked agar powder. plants inoculated with 0.02% Tween-20 solution were used as mock-inoculated controls. niclosamide was assessed for antibacterial activities against Xoo via in vitro turbidimeter test. biofilm formation in glass test tube was quantified as described previously. about 2 mL of a diluted bacterial suspension was placed in each glass tube with 5 g/mL niclosamide and incubated at 28\u00b0C for 72 h. the medium was carefully discarded and planktonic bacteria were carefully washed out with 100 mM PBS (pH = 7.4). coverslips containing biofilm were carefully removed from the well and stained with fluorescein diacetate (f7378, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) superoxide radical anion reduces XTT to form water-soluble XTT-formazan with the maximum absorption at 470 nm. Xoo and E. coli grown up to log phase were treated with 5 g/ml of niclosamide for 12 h. samples were coated with gold and analyzed on a Hitachi S-3000N scanning electron microscope. for TEM analysis, samples were embedded in Epon 812, sectioned with an ultramicrotome. the protein sequences of XanA (Accession number: ACD61040), GumB (Accession number: ACD59988) and RpfB (Accession number: AAL06344) were used as input.

Xoo were grown on cover slides with or without 5 g/ml niclosamide. xanthomonadin activity after niclosamide treatment. niclosamide treated Xoo showed irregular shape with sunken surfaces. E. coli cells were the same as the control without significant damage. TEM observations indicated that the Xoo cell membranes were heavily disrupted with noticeable irregular shape and morphology. XanA, GumB and RpfB were modeled at >90% confidence. for gumB only 78% of residues were modeled at >90% confidence. ligand binding site was predicted by using COFACTOR. interacting residues of the RpfB protein formed two hydrogen bonds with niclosamide. Ile445 also formed a pi-alkyl bond along with Lys548 and Ala340. these results suggest that there is a strong binding affinity of niclosamide with the target proteins. phopQ (essential for AvrXA21 activity) and thiG genes were significantly lowered. niclosamide downregulates the expression of biofilm, EPS and quorum sensing related genes. only \u201cXoo\u201d served as control while \u201cXoo+ niclosamide\u201d represents the treatment in the figure. shift was observed at the wavelength of 2843, 1023, and 868 cm-1 corresponding to the bonds C\u2013H (aldehyde), C\u2013N (aliphatic amines) and C\u2013H (vinyl) respectively. however, the maximum negative shift was exhibited by the carboxylic acids (O\u2013H), C\u2013N, and fluoroalkanes. niclosamide has a strong inhibitory (>80%) potential against Xoo. this non-effectiveness of niclosamide against Xoo could be due to the use of lower concentration of niclosamide (5 g/ml) the antibacterial activity of niclosamide has been described against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. niclosamide can effectively block the growth of Xoo without affecting the growth of other beneficial bacteria. anning Microscopy (CLSM) has become a standard tool for visualizing biofilms in situ. the niclosamide drug was found to disrupt the xanthomonadin production. this suggests that niclosamide might directly affect the epiphytic survival of and effective host plant infection. the niclosamide drug was found to disrupt the xanthomonadin production. the reduction in the production of xanthomonadin and EPS might be the possible cause of biofilm inhibition by niclosamide. our in-depth morphological and ultrastructural analysis by scanning and transmission electron microscopy reveals several noticeable changes in the membrane integrity and overall bacterial morphology after niclosamide treatment. this docking score is in accordance with earlier reports signifying that lower the binding affinity score, higher will be the binding efficiency. in all interactions there were involvement of at least two to three hydrogen bonds within the predicted active site. this existence of intra/intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the ligand (niclosamide) and the target (protein) further demonstrate strong binding interaction. EPS biosynthesis related genes belonging to the gum gene cluster were also significantly affected. the rpfB gene responsible for the production of diffusible signal factor (DSF) was also significantly affected. the results revealed major positive shifts in C\u2013H (aldehyde), C\u2013N (aliphatic amines) and C\u2013H (vinyl) the maximum negative shift was exhibited by the carboxylic acids (O\u2013H), C\u2013N, and fluoroalkanes. this finding is in accordance with that of a previous study on the ciprofloxacin penetration in P. aeruginosa biofilm. niclosamide is a master regulatory drug that effectively functions to protect both animals and plants from contagious diseases caused by parasites and pathogenic bacteria respectively. however, the involvement of other inhibitory mechanisms cannot be ruled out by taking into account the multiple impacts of niclosamide on Xoo."}
