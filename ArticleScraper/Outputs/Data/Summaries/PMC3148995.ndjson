{"summary": "community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians presents as a non-specific acute febrile respiratory illness followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure. novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing for respiratory viruses enabled us to rapidly make the diagnosis in this case. adenovirus serotypes 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21 are common among military recruits. outbreaks of adenovirus infection in long-term nursing facilities and hospital wards have also been described. community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia cases in immunocompetent adult civilians have rarely been described. initial laboratory tests showed a white cell count of 9.2 109/L, a neutrophil count of 7.9 109/L, a lymphocyte count of 0.69 109/L, a platelet count of 0.69 109/L, a C-reactive protein concentration of 169 mg/L, alanine aminotransferase level of 22 IU/mL, a creatinine phosphokinase level of 950 IU/mL and a nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples were negative for influenza A and B. they were positive for adenovirus DNA on the basis of a PCR assay. the patient made an uncomplicated recovery without any specific antiviral therapy. adenovirus serotype 3 No 4 (19) 4 Yes 2 (10) 7 No 5 (24) 21 No 3 (14) Unknown No 7 (33) aCPK, creatinine phosphokinase; CXR, Chest X ray; ET, endotracheal tube. of the 21 cases retrieved in our literature search, 57% of the patients were men. the commonest ethnic origin of patients was Caucasian (40%) the median duration of illness prior to admission to the hospital was five days. common examination findings included abnormalities in chest auscultation (90%), pyrexia (89%) and hypoxia (66%). there were no cases identified in the literature where molecular methods were used to diagnose adenovirus pneumonia. there were no cases identified in the literature where molecular methods were used to diagnose adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. sporadic adenoviral pneumonia is the first case to be reported in literature. adenoviral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults is more common than previously thought. adenoviral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults is more common than previously thought. novel respiratory virus real-time RT-PCR testing enabled us to rapidly detect adenovirus as the cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia in our patient. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
