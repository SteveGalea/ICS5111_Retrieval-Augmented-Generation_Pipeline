{"summary": "a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 260 participants 1 year old hospitalized with influenza-like illness. participants were randomized 1:1 to NTZ (age 12 years, 600 mg twice daily; age 4\u201311 years and 1\u20133 years, 200 or 100 mg twice daily, respectively) or placebo for 5 days in addition to standard of care. study was designed to enroll 290 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio. primary endpoint was duration of hospitalization (days and hours) study population The WHO 2014 definition of SARI [17] was used as the basis of developing inclusion criteria for this study. participants recorded symptoms on diary cards, which were completed daily through day 14. NP swabs were tested by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction to influenza. study was designed to enroll 290 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio. primary endpoint was duration of hospitalization (days and hours) study population The WHO 2014 definition of SARI [17] was used as the basis of developing inclusion criteria. participants recorded symptoms on diary cards, which were completed daily through day 14. NP swabs were tested by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to influenza. 257 (99%) participants were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. of these, 129 of 130 (99.2%) in the NTZ + SOC group and 125 of 127 (98.4%) in the placebo + SOC arm had primary endpoint data. 76 (29.6%) participants reported vaccination against influenza.
