{"summary": "retrospective study was based on three categories of samples submitted in 2009 and 2010. blood samples collected for disease monitoring were subjected to influenza A antibodies with an antibody ELISA. positive samples were further analyzed for H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 antibodies. e influenza of avian-like H1N1 virus was introduced into the Finnish pig population in 2008 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009. the source of avian-like H1N1 infection could not be determined. three influenza A virus subtypes, H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2, are circulating in the swine population in Europe. a retrospective serological study examined the time of entry of H1N1 swine influenza virus into the Finnish pig population. for the first time, we also report the detection of two types of H1N1 influenza A virus in pigs in Finland. ELISA-positivesamples were further analyzed using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test according to the operating procedure of the European Surveillance of Influenza in Swine. all antigens were provided by GD Animal Health Service, Deventer, NL. primer pairs for NA gene amplification were: 5\u2032agcaaaagcaggggataattaaatc3\u2032 and 5\u2032tgatacaactgaaaaatgtatgtatg3\u2032, 5\u2032caccaagtcataaaacaaacaac3\u2032 and 5\u2032ggcattatatgtccatagtc3\u2032. in all PCRs the reaction volume was 50 l and the temperature profile of cDNA genes of pandemic strains A/Swine/Finland/si5688/09, A/Swine/Finland/si3431/10, and A/Swine/Finland/si4171/10 were amplified and sequenced as previously published. the phylogenetic analyses were carried out with the middle part sequences of HA and NA genes of the Finnish strains and over 20 swine influenza A (H1N1) and three A(H1N in 2008 and 2009, a total of 472 samples from 42 farms and 465 samples from 31 farms were analyzed for the presence of swine influenza antibodies. in 2008 and 2009, a total of 472 samples from 42 farms and 465 samples from 31 farms were analyzed for the presence of swine influenza antibodies. ELISA-positivesamples were further analyzed using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test according to the operating procedure of the European Surveillance of Influenza in Swine. all the antigens were provided by GD Animal Health Service, Deventer, NL. HA gene amplification was carried out using a BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit v3.1 and an ABI3100 Avant automatic sequencer. the primer pairs were: na1 [15] and 5\u2032actgactcaaatcttgagtgttg3\u2032, 5\u2032ccytgctraatgacaaaacattg3\u2032 and 5\u2032ttatatggtcgttagtagtag3\u2032. the phylogenetic analyses were carried out with the middle part sequences of HA and NA genes. the 744 nucleotides of HA and 560 nucleotides of NA genes of the Finnish strains and over 20 swine influenza A (H1N1) and three A(H1N1)pdm09 strains originating in swine and in humans were aligned with the program ClustalW [18]. samples from special health class farms producing replacement animals HI test results show that in 2008 one farm out of 42 (2,3%) and in 2009 four out of 31 (12,9%) farms was serologically H1N1 positive. the results of samples taken from pigs in farms with clinical signs of acute respiratory disease show that seven out of 18 (38,8%) farms tested had H1N1 antibodies. in 2009 and 2010 this swine H1N1 influenza virus was detected on 12 farms and two farms, respectively. no influenza viruses have been detected in porcine samples in 2011 and 2012. the locations of the infected farms are indicated in Figure 2. the pandemic HA gene cluster clearly differed from the swine influenza A (H1N1) avian origin strains. the NA gene clustered together with both classical swine influenza H1N1 viruses and pandemic H1N1 viruses, as expected. in 2008 one farm out of 42 (2,3%) and in 2009 four out of 31 (12,9%) farms were serologically H1N1 positive. the first H1N1-positive serum sample of a special health class farm was taken in July 2008. samples from special health class farms producing replacement animals HI test results show that in 2008 one farm out of 42 (2,3%) and in 2009 four out of 31 (12,9%) farms was serologically H1N1 positive. the results of samples taken from pigs in farms with clinical signs of acute respiratory disease show that seven out of 18 farms tested had H1N1 antibodies. in 2009 and 2010 this swine H1N1 influenza virus was detected on 12 farms and two farms. no influenza viruses have been detected in porcine samples in 2011 and 2012. the locations of the infected farms are indicated in Figure 2. the pandemic HA gene cluster clearly differed from the swine influenza A (H1N1) avian origin strains. the NA gene clustered together with both classical swine influenza H1N1 viruses and pandemic H1N1 viruses, as expected. the only positive H1N1 sample in 2007 had a titer of 1:16. the number of H3N2 and H1N2 seropositive samples in 2007 and 2008 was low. in 2005\u20132007, seasonal influenza in humans in Finland was mainly caused by H3N2 influenza viruses. no epidemiological data are available and the direction of virus transmission between humans and swine is impossible to estimate. a new respiratory disease like swine influenza was expected to be noticed based on clinical signs due to the good health status of the Finnish pigs. a higher number of H1N1 seropositive samples were found in pigs with clinical signs than in samples of pigs collected for disease monitoring and in samples of pigs in special health class farms. avian-like swine H1N1 does not necessarily cause coughing in pigs that are free from M. hyopneumoniae infection [37], and subclinical infections are possible [38,39] this could have contributed to the delayed detection of influenza virus in TL participated in the diagnostics of samples submitted to the laboratory for pathological examination. LL participated in analyzing the data and in drafting the manuscript. AH designed and participated in the molecular diagnosis, sequenced the swine influenza strains and performed the phylogenetic analyses."}
