{"summary": "MHV is a collection of strains with tropisms for different organs, including the liver and central nervous system (CNS) the MHV-A59 strain (A59) used in this study induces mild encephalitis and moderate hepatitis. dsRNA activates OAS, which synthesizes 2-5A. oligonucleotide activates RNase L to degrade 2-5A. many viruses have evolved mechanisms to avoid and/or antagonize host type I IFN responses. ns2-H126R can replicate efficiently in macrophages derived from mice deficient in either type I interferon receptor expression (IFNAR/) or RNase L expression (RNase L/) (2, 11) ns2 acts as an organ-specific virulence factor that is required for efficient hepatic virus replication and pathology in B6 mice. fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), HEPES (10 mM) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. recombinant coronaviruses inf-MHV-A59 and inf-ns2-H126R were obtained from the national cancer institute (Frederick, MD) RNA was isolated with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed as described previously (2). 2 l of cDNA was combined with 12.5 l of iQ5 SYBR green mix. hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 15 (E15) to E16 mouse embryos. they were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture plates. neuron cultures were infected and/or treated with IFN-. cells were plated in complete medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin. microglia cultures were 95% pure, as determined by positive immunostaining for CD11b and negative staining for GFAP (2). oligodendrocyte lineage cells were purified using a modified wash-down procedure to remove astrocytes a modified MEM was used for long-term culture of adult liver epithelial cells. the cells were allowed to attach for 2 h before switching to William E medium supplemented with 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids (3). the cells were allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. titers of released virus were determined by plaque assay on L2 cells. total RNA from virus-infected cells was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and quantified using a nanodrop analyzer. recombinant coronaviruses inf-MHV-A59 and inf-ns2-H126R were obtained from Stuart Siddell (University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom) the recombinant coronaviruses inf-MHV-A59 (referred to as A59 here) and inf-ns2-H126R (referred to as ns2-H126R here) were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD RNA was isolated with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed as described previously (2). 2 l of cDNA was combined with 12.5 l of iQ5 iCycler (Bio-Rad) and 4 l primer mix (5 M each) cultures were routinely 99% pure as assessed by positive staining for expression of CD11b and negative staining for expression of CD11c. neuron cultures were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture plates for 4 days in the absence of an astrocyte feeder layer. microglia cultures were generated from neonatal mice similarly to astrocyte cultures. the cells were plated in complete medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin. after 12 days in culture, the flasks were shaken at 200 rpm for 45 min to remove nonadherent cells, including microglia. a modified MEM used for long-term culture of adult liver epithelial cells was added to cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell and allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. supernatants recovered from cells that were infected with A59 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. supernatants were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. total RNA from virus-infected cells was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and quantified using a nanodrop analyzer. an unpaired two-tailed t test was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS MHV replication depends on ns2-phosphodiesterase activity in an organ-specific manner. MHV strain A59 infects predominantly the CNS and the liver. B6 and RNase L/ mice were inoculated intracranially with 200 PFU/mouse of A59 or ns2-H126R (n = 5) the mice were sacrificed at 5 days p.i., the brains and livers were harvested, and the virus titers were determined by plaque assay. the titers of A59 in the liver were approximately 1,000-fold higher than the minimal titers of ns2-H126R. dispensability of ns2 activity for replication in the brain was independent of the route of inoculation. liver parenchymal cells were less well prepared than macrophages to restrict MHV. primary hepatocyte cultures were infected with A59 or ns2-H126R. ns2-H126R and ns2-H126R replicated to similar levels in hepatocytes. primary hepatocyte cultures were infected with A59 or ns2-H126R (1 PFU/cell); at the times indicated, the virus titer was determined from the supernatant. cells were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to locate cellular nuclei (blue) and an antibody directed against MHV nucleocapsid protein. basal levels of expression of several genes encoding active OAS proteins were 100- to 1,000-fold higher in macrophages than in hepatocytes. even following MHV infection, at 16 h p.i., OAS1a mRNA levels remained comparatively low in hepatocytes relative to macrophages. basal levels of IFN- mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR using the same RNAs as in panel B. mRNA expression levels relative to -actin mRNA were expressed as 2CT. MHV replication is restricted by the OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway in microglia. ns2-H126R replicated to the same extent as A59 in microglia derived from RNase L/ mice. restriction of ns2 mutant virus in B6 microglia was due to activation of RNase L. ns2-H126R replicated to the same extent as A59 in microglia. astrocytes expressed intermediate mRNA levels after viral infection of these CNS cell types. infection induced significant upregulation of OAS mRNAs, up to 50-fold for OAS2. levels in astrocytes were still 10- to 100-fold lower than in microglia. ns2-H126R induced rRNA cleavage in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia infected at 24 h p.i. with either ns2-H126R or A59. ns2-H126R, but not A59, induced rRNA cleavage in microglia. supernatants from primary CNS cultures were treated with UV light and incubated with L2 mouse fibroblasts for 24 h. at 24 h p.i., cells were examined under a Nikon Eclipse 2000E-U-fluorescence microscope. hypothesized that low OAS mRNA levels in MHV-infected primary cultures could be attributed to insufficient IFN production. we then assessed replication of A59 and ns2-H126R in each cell type. IFN pretreatment severely restricted A59 replication in all neural cell types. ns2-H126R displayed enhanced sensitivity to IFN pretreatment in microglia similar to that in BMM. in contrast, ns2-H126R displayed sensitivity to IFN similar to that of A59 in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. the data are from one representative of two experiments performed in triplicate and are shown as means and SEM. the data are from one representative of two experiments performed in triplicate and are shown as means and SEM. astrocyte and neuron cultures were treated with 100 U/ml IFN for 24 h. RNA was extracted from treated cells 6 h after poly(IC) treatment. rRNA degradation was evident in both cultures, indicating that RNase L was activated. phosphodiesterase residues, H46A or H126R, confers attenuation of viral replication and pathogenicity in the liver, but not in the brain, in B6 mice (2). titers of ns2-H126R were more than 100-fold lower than those of ns2-H126R in the livers of infected B6 mice at 5 days p.i., consistent with previously observed results of intrahepatic inoculation. culated intranasally with 2 105 PFU/mouse of A59 or ns2-H126R. the mice were sacrificed at 5 days p.i., the brains and livers were harvested. expression levels of OAS1a, OAS2, and RNase L mRNAs were assessed by qRT-PCR. basal levels of expression of three active OAS genes, OAS1a, OAS2 and OAS3 genes, were significantly higher in the liver than in the brain. this suggests that the basal level of OAS might influence the host's ability to activate RNase L and restrict MHV infection in an organ-specific manner. we compared replication of A59 and ns2-H126R in hepatocytes. ns2-H126R and ns2-H126R replicated to similar levels in hepatocytes. both viruses produced syncytia in hepatocytes, as observed by staining cultures with an antibody directed against MHV nucleocapsid protein. hepatocyte cultures were infected with ns2-H126R (1 PFU/cell) at 16 h p.i., the cells were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to locate cellular nuclei (blue) and an antibody directed against MHV nucleocapsid protein to visualize virus (green) MHV infection of BMM significantly induced IFN- mRNA expression at 16 h p.i. relative to mock infection, mRNA levels remained low in infected hepatocytes. basal levels of ISG mRNAs encoding a group of pattern recognition receptors, transcription factors, and antiviral genes involved in the host response to viruses were also higher in BMM. MHV replication is restricted by the OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway in microglia but not in neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia were each prepared as described in Materials and Methods. virus titer was determined from the supernatant at the times indicated. the data are from one of two replicate experiments performed in triplicate. Activation of RNase L activity correlates with high basal and induced levels of OAS genes. astrocytes and microglia induced significant upregulation of OAS mRNAs. levels in astrocytes were 10- to 100-fold lower than in microglia. ns2-H126R elicited similar levels of induction. ns2-H126R, but not A59, induced rRNA cleavage in microglia. RNA was harvested 24 h p.i. and analyzed for rRNA degradation. mRNA expression levels relative to -actin mRNA were expressed as 2CT. induction by both A59 and ns2-H126R was more than 100-fold greater in microglia than in the other cell types tested. bioassay for antiviral activity confirmed that both A59 and ns2-H126R induced detectable IFN expression in microglia, but not in other cell types. ns2-H126R showed enhanced sensitivity to IFN pretreatment in microglia similar to that of A59 in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. in contrast, ns2-H126R displayed sensitivity to IFN similar to that of A59 in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. in contrast, ns2-H126R showed sensitivity to IFN similar to that of A59 in neurons, oli we infected astrocytes with three other viruses, EMCV (16), LaCrosse virus (15) and SeV (14). EMCV and LACV are neurotropic, while SeV is pneumotropic. rRNA degradation was assessed with a bioanalyzer. neuron RNAs were analyzed on separate chips. we investigated whether neurons or astrocytes can regulate RNase L activity in response to poly(IC) poly(IC) serves as a surrogate for dsRNA for dsRNA. rase (2\u2032-PDE) can degrade 2-5A in vivo and downregulate the activity of RNase L. ns2-H126R activates but cannot antagonize the pathway. the outcome of infection depends on the viral genetics, as well as the balance of activation and antagonism. myeloid cells express the highest basal levels of OAS. ns2-H126R is the only cell type tested in which MHV needs an enzymatically active ns2 to ensure efficient replication. oligodendrocytes and astrocytes showed little increase in OAS mRNA expression. west Nile virus replication was significantly less restricted by IFN pretreatment of primary neuronal cultures than of macrophages. lack of activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway in nonmyeloid primary cell types is requirement for viral dsRNA to be accessible to induce the synthesis of 2-5A by OAS. the nonparenchymal Kupffer cells (KC), the resident macrophages of the liver, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are located within the sinusoids (43). we suggest that KC serve as gatekeepers to restrict entrance from the sinusoids into the liver parenchyma to infect hepatocytes (2, 31, 42) the brain is considered immune privileged and differs from the liver and other peripheral organs in response to infections, in part due to the blood brain barrier and a lack of dendritic cells in the naive brain. however, unregulated immune responses could be irreparably destructive to the CNS. olfactory bulb neurons may be specialized to control viruses, as they are most exposed to environmental factors. olfactory bulb neurons may be specialized to control viruses, as they are most exposed to environmental factors. VSV infection was restricted by the IFN-stimulated gene product of IFIT2 following intranasal, but not intracranial, inoculation. however, when inoculated via the intranasal route, ns2-H126R was not preferentially restricted relative to A59, implying that the cells of the nasal epithelium and the olfactory neurons were not better able to prevent viral invasion. cell types may play a gatekeeping role similar to the function we propose for KC in the liver and thus prevent the spread of peripheral viral infections into the brain."}
