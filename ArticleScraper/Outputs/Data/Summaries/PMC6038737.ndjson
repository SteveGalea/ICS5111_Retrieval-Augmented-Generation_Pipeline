{"summary": "the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the South Korea Armed Forces Medical Command. we defined AFRI as a history of fever or measured fever >37.6\u00b0C and the presence of >1 respiratory symptom such as cough, sore throat, or rhinorrhea with onset within the last 7 days. the hospital is the only tertiary care hospital in the military healthcare system. heminested PCR was performed by using primers (273 bp) ADHEX1F (5\u2032-CAACACCTAYGASTACATGAA-3\u2032) and ADHEX2R (5\u2032-ACATCCTTBCKGAAGTTCCA-3\u2032) with same temperature and time profiles. for the phylogenetic analysis, we selected the sequences of each type of HAdV from GenBank. we used MEGA 6 software to generate the phylogenetic tree and evaluated topologies by performing a bootstrap analysis of 1,000 iterations (20). we collected nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens from patients with AFRI within 24 hours after their hospital visit by using a flocked swab. within 3 days of collection, we sent specimens to a commercial laboratory center (GC Labs, Yongin, South Korea) we extracted total viral nucleic acid from the specimens by using the Chemagic Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 1 min, elongation at 68\u00b0C for 1 min, and final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. for samples that tested negative in the first PCR reaction, we performed heminested PCR by using primers (273 bp) ADHEX1F (5\u2032- a total of 157 respiratory viruses were detected in 139 soldiers with AFRI. HAdV was the most prevalent virus (49.6% [69/139]), followed by influenza A or B virus (28.8% [40/139] and rhinovirus group A (12.2% [17/139]). a peak positive rate for HAdV infection occurred in soldiers with AFRI during March\u2013April 2014. 69 patients with HAdV infection, 40.6% were new recruits and 75.4% were hospitalized (Table 2). Temporal distribution of acute febrile respiratory illness from human adenovirus infection among soldiers (no. cases) and overall HAdV positivity rate among collected specimens, by HAdV type, south Korea, January 2013\u2013April 2014*. from the 69 patients with HAdV infection, 51 respiratory specimens were available for further molecular analysis. HAdV-55 (72.5% [29/40]) was the most prevalent type in soldiers with HAdV infection, followed by HAdV-4 (22.5% [9/40]) the patients with HAdV-55 infection were more likely to have onset pneumonia (44.8% vs. 27.3% [odds ratio (OR) 2.17; 95% CI 0.48\u20139.86] and be hospitalized (86.2% vs. 54.5% [OR 5.21; 95% CI 1.06\u201325.50]) than those infected with other types of HAdV. ctival injection 4 (13.8) 2 (18.2) 0.72 (0.11\u20134.63) 1.000 Laboratory findings, mean +SD Leukocyte count, cells/L 5,200 +1,818 6,322 +2,656 NA 0.134 Platelet count, 103 cells/L 177 +57 172 +77 NA 0.848 C-reactive protein, mg/dL 6.7 +3.9 5.0 +1.8 NA 0.193 Radiographic findings Bilateral involvement 6 (20.7) 1 (9.1) 2.61 a total of 157 respiratory viruses were detected in 139 patients with AFRI.

HAdV-55 causes outbreaks of respiratory illness and severe pneumonia in the general population and soldiers. our finding that HAdV-55 was the most prevalent type in soldiers in south Korea differs from the epidemiology of adenovirus in children in south Korea. HAdV-4 was the second most common type after HAdV-55 among soldiers with AFRI in south Korea in 2013. however, HAdV-4 has not been identified in soldiers in south Korea since November 2013. more than half of the soldiers with HAdV infection were on active duty. this contrasts with previous data in which HAdV-associated respiratory infection has been common among new recruits (7). the patients included in this study might have had clinically severe illness rather than mild illness because our institute is the only central referral hospital in the military system in south Korea. HAdV-55 and HAdV-4 may be implicated in HAdV respiratory infections among soldiers in south Korea. active duty soldiers and new recruits could have substantial disease burden caused by respiratory HAdV infection."}
