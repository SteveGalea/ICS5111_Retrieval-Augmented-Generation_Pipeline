{"summary": "improved nucleic acid amplification and detection technology has facilitated the identification of pathogens that had previously proved difficult or impossible to detect using traditional culture or immunofluorescent techniques. despite these advances, there remain a significant proportion of respiratory disease episodes for which a pathogenic agent can not be identified. denovirus genotypes, Bordetella species, human bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and psittaci, coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63, Haemophilus influenzae, influenza viruses A, B and C, Legionella longbeachae and pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenzaviruses 1 \u2013 sensitivity of multiplex tandem real-time PCR compared to single real-time and nested PCR in-house assays. target DNA/RNA Highest 10 fold dilution detected Multiplex Tandem real time PCR Singleplex real time PCR Nested PCR [11\u201320] Adenovirus. 105 105 105 parainfluenzavirus 1 108 107 108 Parainfluenzavirus 2 106 106 Parainfluenzavirus 3 106 105 Parainfluenzavirus 4B 103 103 NA Pneumocystis jirovecii 103 102 102 Polyomavirus WU 105 103 NA RSV A 107 107 107 RSV B 104 104 104 Streptococcus the significance of the detection of these agents in pernasal aspirates remains doubtful [21\u201323] further studies are underway to gather more information about asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage rates for viral and bacterial pathogens. syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was detected in 41 samples. at least one, and up to three other respiratory agents, including human rhinovirus, human bocavirus, KI and WU polyomaviruses. the tandem multiplex real-time assay failed to detect pathogens that had previously been detected on initial routine testing in six samples. the agents were rhinovirus (2), parainfluenza type 2, parainfluenza type 3, human metapneumovirus and influenza B. despite the comprehensive range of agents detected by the assay described in this study, 35 (29%) samples still failed to yield a positive result. some may be due to suboptimal specimen types for some viruses; poor collection, transport or storage conditions; samples collected too late in the time course of infection; or non-infectious causes of respiratory symptoms. however, it may also indicate possible infection with as yet unknown pathogens. multiple PCR assays, immunofluorescence or multiple cell culture assays to be performed on each sample. considerable specimen volume is required to produce sufficient nucleic acid extracts for multiple PCR assays. multiple extraction and reverse transcription reactions significantly increase the cost of the assays. target (Abbreviation) Gene target Primer or Probe name Sequence 5\u2032-3\u2032 Size (bp) PCR mixa Adenovirus (AdV) (Group B) Hexon gene ADB-F ADB-R ADBProbe1 ADBProbe2 GACAGGATGCTTCGGAGTACCT TTTCTAAACTTKTTYCCCAYAYTGAA 6FAM-CACCAGACCCGGACT-MGBNFQ 63 A-2 Bordetella species Insert CCTTACAAGCCTTGCCTGTAG CCCACATAGTGCCATCGATTAA CY5.5C+CCAGC+TGAA+C+CAAG+TT-BHQ3 (LNA) Nucleocapsid 229E-F 229E-R 229E Probe CTGCCAAGTCTTTT TCTTTT VIC-AGAACAAAAGCATGAAATG-MGBFQ 80 A-6 Coronavirus HKU1 (HCoVHKU1) ORF 1 influenza virus A Matrix [44] FA-MATF FA-MATR FA Probe CTTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACGTA GGTGACAGGTCTTTTTA CALOTCAGGCCCCCTCAAAGCCGAGBHQ1 155 A-4 Influenza virus A H3 haemagglutinin H3N2-F H3N2-R H3HAProbe AAGCTACCACCCATTGGC-MGBNFQ 72 A-4 Influenza virus C NS1 FLUC-F mophila mip gene LPN-F LPN Probe CAATGGCTAAAGGCATGCAA TGCTGTTTTTTTC VIC-ACCAATGTTGTTTTTTRCG-MGBNFQ 63 B-14 MS-2 RNA coliphage Coat protein MS2-F MS2-R MS2 Probe GTCGACAATGGCGGAACTG TTCAGACCACCACCACGACGCTCAA TCGTCAGGGGGTGTAG 6FAM\u2013CGCCAGCAATTTA 67 A-8 65 A-8 59 A-8 65 A-9 60 A-9 Pneumocyctis jirovecii 5S rRNA PN-F PN-R PN Probe CCATACCTCAGAATATACCGTATCC TACTGACGACGCCCTTCAGA 6FAM\u2013TRACTTCGCAGATCG\u2013MGBNFQ 69 A-10 Polyomavirus VP1 KI-F KI Probe WU-F WU coccus speB gene STAspeB-F STspBProbe CTAAACCCTCTCTTGGTACTG TTGATGCCTACAACAGCACTTTG 6FAM-CGGCGCGCGCGCGGCTTCAAC-BHQ1 77 B-11 Streptococcus pneumoniae Pneumolysin gene Pneumolysin gene Pneum-F Pneum-R Pn Probe. the nucleic acid extracted from the specimens and controls was a single sample extraction and three reverse transcription reactions are required for the tandem multiplex real-time assay. the consumable costs are approximately AUD 67 for the individual assays compared to AUD 17 for the tandem multiplex real-time assay. further work is planned to incorporate the picornavirus and human metapneumovirus assays into the tandem multiplex real-time assay. sensitivity of the tandem multiplex real-time assay was greater than or equal to that of singleplex real-time or traditional nested PCR assays. adenovirus and influenza virus C were 100-fold and 10-fold less sensitive respectively than the established nested PCR assay. sensitivity of the tandem multiplex real-time assay was greater than or equal to that of singleplex real-time or traditional nested PCR assays.
