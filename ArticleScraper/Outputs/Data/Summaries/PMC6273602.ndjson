{"summary": "leukemia is a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic malignancies. it is the sixth leading cause of cancer-associated death in the united states. leukemia is the 13th leading cause of cancer-associated death. pro-apoptotic protein Bax, the ratio of Bak and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl also play an important role affecting the mitochondrial dysfunction involved in the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. about 47.1% of approved anticancer drugs are unmodified natural products, their semisynthetic derivatives, or molecules synthesized based on natural products [17] 18-GA inhibited gingival fibroblast growth by suppressing the G1/S phase transition and inducing apoptosis. results showed that 18-GA treatment of HL-60 cells resulted in apoptotic cell death through mediation by extrinsically and intrinsically mediated pathways. HL-60 cells were treated with 18-GA (0, 40, 80 and 120 M) for 48 h. cells were stained with DAPI for measuring nuclear condensation. results indicated brighter fluorescence of HL-60 cells after 48 h treatment. 18-GA decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (m) from 6 h to 48 h. cells were treated with 18-GA (100 M) for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. results indicated that m are involved in 18-GA induced cell apoptosis in HL-60 cells in vitro. cells were treated with 18-GA (100 M) for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. cells were treated with 18-GA (100 M) for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. apoptosis-associated proteins were examined by western blotting. results indicate 18-GA induces apoptosis of HL-60 cells. 18-GA altered the translocation of apoptosis-associated proteins in HL-60 cells. cells were treated with 100 M of 18-GA for 48 h and stained by anti-cytochrome c (A); and AIF (B) and then stained with secondary antibody. 18-GA showed the strongest HL-60 cell growth inhibition potency, accompanied by a reduction of viable cells. HL-60 cells (1 104 cells/well) were placed on 96-well plated in 100 M of RPMI-1640 medium. medium was containing 18-GA (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 M) for 48 h. percent of cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. HL-60 cells were treated with 18-GA (0, 40, 80 and 120 M) for 48 h. cells were stained with DAPI for measuring nuclear condensation. cells were treated with 100 M of 18-GA for 48 h. 18-GA decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (m) and increased the activities of caspase-8, -9 and -3 in HL-60 cells. cells were treated with 18-GA (100 M) for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. results showed 18-GA significantly increased the expression of active-caspase-3, -8 and -9. 18-GA affects apoptosis associated protein expression in HL-60 cells. cells were treated with 18-GA (100 M) for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. cytochrome c and AIF were released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm compared to the control group. glycyrrhetinic acid (GE) can occupy mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in mononuclear leukocytes. GE can block 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 thus reducing the availability of cortisol at the adipocyte level. 18-GA induced cell apoptosis and whether it occurred through mitochondrial dysfunction and involved caspase activities. western blotting was used to examine possible protein expression associated with cell apoptosis. we further investigated whether 18-GA induced cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria. we used a flow cytometry assay and found that 18-GA decreased the levels of m in HL-60 cells. this pathway is named the intrinsic signaling pathway. if this agent caused decreased levels of m in mitochondria, it could lead to cell apoptosis [35,36] 18-GA increased the activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 in HL-60 cells. it is well documented that cell apoptosis may go through the extrinsic death receptor pathway and/or the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. 18-GA induced cell apoptosis was caspase-dependent and mitochondria-dependent pathways were accompanied by release of cytochrome c, caspase-9 and -3 activation and/or AIF release. the human leukemia HL-60 cell line was purchased from the Food Industry Research and Development Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan) HL-60 cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. comet assay Cells were placed in 6-well plate at a density of 2 105 cells/well. cells were incubated with 18-GA concentrations ranging from 40\u2013120 M for 48 h. cells from each treatment were harvested to examine the DNA damage. cells were collected, re-suspended in 25 L of 10 M substrate solution containing CaspaLux8-L1D2 for caspase-8 activity measurement, or containing PhiPhiLux-G1D1 for caspase-8 activity measurement. cells were pretreated with caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-EDVD-FMK) for 1 h. protein bands on the membrane were visualized and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL detection system (Millipore). protein expression was quantified by densitometry using Image J. 4.10. RPMI-1640 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine and antibiotics were purchased from GIBCO\u00ae/Invitrogen Life Technologies. primary antibody against PARP, caspase-3,-8, -9, AIF, Endo G, Bid, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cytochrome c, Fas, Fas-L and peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from cell signal nuclear staining with DAPI Cells were placed in 6-well plate at a density of 2 105 cells/well. cells were incubated with 18-GA at concentrations ranging from 40\u2013120 M for 48 h. cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 20 min and then washed with PBS. cells from each treatment were harvested and washed twice with PBS. re-suspended in 500 L of DiOC6 (4 mol/L) and were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min without light. cells were measured for the levels of m by flow cytometry. both adherent and floating cells were collected and lysed by lysis buffer. protein was separated by 12% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. proteins were visualized and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence using image J. 4.10. examined and photo-micrographed under a leica TCS SP2 Confocal Spectral Microscope. Statistical analysis was conducted by Student\u2019s t test."}
