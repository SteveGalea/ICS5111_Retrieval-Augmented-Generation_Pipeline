{"summary": "the state council of the People\u2019s Republic of China officially announced the lifting of its travel ban on people living with HIV/AIDS wishing to enter the country. this ban was implemented >20 years ago as one of China\u2019s first key policies for HIV/AIDS control and prevention. China has made significant progress in its HIV response over the past decade. china's new 5-Year Action Plan for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2011\u201315) review key national policies that have guided China\u2019s HIV response at various stages. we also discuss gaps in policy implementation, and challenges ahead as China continues its efforts to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care services. government officials in china gradually came to understand the seriousness of the HIV epidemic and the urgency of the response needed. a series of policies and actions were taken at different levels, including: issuance of a national Blood Donation Law that took effect in 1998 to address unsafe blood collection practices. more and more people living with HIV began to progress to clinical AIDS. a total of 680 MMT clinics were set up in 27 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities between 2004 and 2005. in 2003, the fda approved the production of four anti-retroviral drugs by two domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers. the cost of anti-retroviral drugs was reduced to 3500\u20134000 Chinese yuan per patient per year, significantly increasing accessibility of ART. by the end of 2009, a cumulative total of 79 946 adults and 1793 children received ART in 1821 counties across China. the first HIV/AIDS policy document was issued on 17 September 1984. in 1986, the Ministry of Health classified HIV/AIDS as a Class B infectious disease notifiable through the national infectious disease reporting system. the scale of transmission and the resulting devastation led to one of the worst tragedies of the global HIV pandemic. early small-scale surveys indicated that the epidemic was serious, but the true scope of transmission was unknown until 1996. first 5-year action plan was a policy milestone in terms of supporting effective policies for condom promotion, methadone maintenance and needle exchange. implementation of the plan was not adequately budgeted, weakening its impact, particularly in the first 3 years, between 2001 and 2003. the number of drug users receiving methadone increased from 8116 in 2005 to 241 975 in 2009, almost a 30-fold increase. at least 80% of AIDS patients satisfying the treatment criteria should have received ART by 2010. the evaluation of the second 5-year action plan will take place next year. the \u2018Four Frees and One Care\u2019 policy has had a significant impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in china. before 2003, less than 22 000 newly identified HIV infections were reported each year. after 2004, over 44 000 newly identified HIV infections were reported each year. the most significant gap relates to stigma-related rights for receiving medical services and employment. on 27 august 2010, the first case of a law suit concerning HIV-related stigma for employment was reported. foreigners found to be HIV infected at china cross-border and customs checkpoints were forced to leave the country and were placed under quarantine before departure. the first major outbreak of HIV infection in china occurred in 1989 among injecting drug users along the border with Myanmar. since the enactment of the Blood Donation Law in 1998, 18 cases of HIV infection caused by transfusion occurred in 2002 and were reported in 2008. it is not clear if there have been any other cases of HIV infection caused by transfusion. number of voluntary donors screening positive for HIV is low and the number who may be in the window period of infection is even lower. china\u2019s second 5-year action plan (2006\u201310) was drafted in a more supportive political environment in which public health was given a higher priority. a new administration led by president Hu Jintao, premier Wen Jiabao and then health minister Wu Yi put the implementation of evidence-based HIV policies high on the national agenda. at least 80% of AIDS patients satisfying the treatment criteria should have received ART by 2010. more than 90% of women should have received prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services. evaluation of the second 5-year action plan will take place next year. high-risk behavioural intervention outreach teams have increased the reach of HIV prevention programmes. on average, these teams have reached about 460 000 female sex workers and 120 000 men who sex with men per month. china now has national laws, policies, action plans, surveillance systems and monitoring and evaluation systems in place to support its HIV/AIDS response. despite increased coverage of HIV testing services, too many people remain unaware of their HIV status. by the end of 2009, there were 326 000 cumulative cases of HIV/AIDS reported. governments do not fully implement national HIV/AIDS policies. in some places, the rate of consistent condom use is low among sex workers and their clients. seventhly, the involvement of civil society needs to be increased. plans and models of HIV/AIDS interventions are being developed. accessibility and coverage of testing, interventions, treatment, PMTCT, care and support are being enhanced. sustainable HIV/AIDS services are being promoted."}
