{"summary": "culture-based methods are currently the standard method for detection of microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) many studies have documented the advantage of using blood culture medium to improve the yield of clinically significant isolates from sterile body fluids other than blood. all agar plates were incubated at 35\u00b0C in 5% CO2 except thioglycolate broth, which was incubated in ambient air. a minimum volume of 1.0 ml of CSF was inoculated into FAN or FAN Plus bottles of the BacT/Alert system. all the Gram stain-positive samples were culture positive in both the conventional culture method and the BacT/Alert system. a total of 80 samples showed growth in conventional media, and 182 showed growth in FAN/FAN Plus bottles. all isolates except for two of Enterobacteriaceae were recovered exclusively in the thioglycolate broth. clinical significance of 113 isolates from lumbar puncture recovered only from conventional method or the FAN/FAN Plus bottlesa Microorganism(s) No. of isolates recovered only in: Conventional method FAN/FAN Plus bottles. 114 of 1,649 specimens were positive by one or both methods during the period FAN. 49 (43.0%) and 104 (91.2%) grew in conventional media and FAN bottles. significantly more isolates were recovered by using the FAN and FAN Plus bottles than by using conventional media. no. of recovered isolates Period FANa Period FAN Plusb Total period Total CM FAN bottles P value Total CM FAN and FAN Plus bottles P value Gram-positive cocci 87 28 83 0.0001 54 15 49 0.0001 141 43 132 0.0001 Staphylococcus aureus 9 6 8 NS 5 3 4 NS 14 9 12 NS CoNS 58 18 56 0.0001 31 6 30 0.0001 89 24 86 0.0001 Entero NS 17 6 17 0.0010 21 10 21 0.0010 Candida sp. 1 1 0 NS 5 4 5 NS 6 5 5 NS All microorganisms 114 49 104 0.0001 86 31 78 0.0001 200 80 182 0.0001 a From January 2010 to January 2013. c Abbreviations: CM, conventional method; CoNS, coagulase-negative staphylococci; NS, not significant. 165 of 182 culture-positive isolates in the FAN/FAN Plus bottles were recovered within 3 days. nine isolates were recovered on day 5 of incubation. previous studies have shown that blood culture bottles have a recovery rate superior to that of the traditional plated medium method for the detection of bacteria and yeast from sterile fluids (4\u20137) the incremental recovery rate of overall microorganisms from FAN and FAN Plus bottles was higher than that from FAN bottles. a substantial number of isolates recovered only in FAN/FAN Plus bottles might be of uncertain clinical significance. al material supp_54_11_2837__index.html (870B, html)."}
