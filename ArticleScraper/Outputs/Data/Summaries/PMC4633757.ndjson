{"summary": "a cohort of 47 households with young infants and other members (n=493 individuals) were prospectively sampled weekly over the first 4 weeks. a household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and with communal cooking arrangements. at least 2 RSV cases were detected per week in each of the 2 contiguous weeks and continued as long as these conditions were met. episodes whose first sample was positive for both RSV group A and B counted as 1 infection episode. the timing of the start of symptoms was defined for every episode. a household RSV outbreak was identified when at least 1 other infection occurred during or within 14 days from the end of the infection episode of an index case in the same household. an asymptomatic case was defined as the absence of any ARD symptoms in the course of the infection episode. a household RSV outbreak was identified when at least 1 other infection occurred during or within 14 days from the end of the infection episode of an index case in the same household. the minimum Ct value over the episode was used as a proxy measure for the peak viral load. the Ct values were converted to arbitrary units (AU) and estimated to be a 10-fold increase in viral load. participants were nested within households, defining the grouping structure. a total of 16 928 swab specimens were collected, representing a sampling compliance of 81.1%. only 2% of individuals in the study were never sampled. the missed sampling was due to refusal of swabbing or when individuals were away during home visits. in rural Kenya Characteristic Evaluated Subjects, No. Asymptomatic Episode, P Valuesa,b No. (%) Age at infection, y 0 to 1 33 3 (9.1).0001b 1 to 5 52 9 (17.3) 5 to 15 73 38 (52.1) 15 to 40 38 29 (76.3) 40 9 7 (77.8) Sex Female 116 58 (50.0).008 Male 89 28 (31.5) Detection of other respiratory viruses during the RSV infection episode None 179 infected individuals had 1 episode, 22 had 2 episodes, and 2 had 3 episodes. the main ARD symptoms were running or blocked nose (117 episodes [98.3%]) and cough (89 [74.8%] the odds of an asymptomatic episode declined by 35% for every 10-fold increase in the peak viral load (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI,.46\u2013.91) prior AdV or hCoV infections or any concurrent virus infection were not significant predictors of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes. asymptomatic episodes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a household cohort study in Kenya, by age in years (A), shedding duration (B), minimum cycle threshold (Ct) values (C), and percentage of individuals with concurrent RSV infection in the household (D). 84 (41.0%) were index cases. thirty-seven index cases (44.0%) were asymptomatic. within-household spread occurred in 10 asymptomatic index cases (27.0%) compared with 29 symptomatic index cases (61.7%; P.002, by the 2 test) acute respiratory disease (ARD) presence is denoted by red, ARD absence is denoted by blue, and cases linked with virus spread are denoted by green. abbreviation: AU, arbitrary units. the study was active for 178 days, and the median duration of an individual's participation was 171 days. only 2% of individuals in the study were never sampled. the missed sampling was due to refusal of swabbing or when individuals were away during home visits. 483 individuals in a prospective household study in rural Kenya, no.

ARD symptoms were observed in 119 infection episodes (58.0%) individuals with RSV group B infections were 2 times more likely to be asymptomatic than those with group A infections. the odds of an asymptomatic episode declined by 35% for every 10-fold increase in the peak viral load (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI,.46\u2013.91). prior AdV or hCoV infections or any concurrent virus infection were not significant predictors of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes. n Prospective Household Study Predictor Adjusted OR (95% CI) P Value Age Per y 1.20 (1.09\u20131.33).003 Duration of RSV shedding, per d 0.90 (.82\u2013.98).010 Virus load, per unit log10 AU 0.65 (.46\u2013.91) thirty-seven index cases (44.0%) were asymptomatic. within-household spread occurred in 10 asymptomatic index cases (27.0%) compared with 29 symptomatic index cases (61.7%; P.002, by the 2 test) acute respiratory disease (ARD) presence is denoted by red, ARD absence is denoted by blue, and cases linked with virus spread are denoted by green. abbreviation: AU, arbitrary units. over 40% of the 205 RSV infection episodes were asymptomatic. the probability of symptomless infection increased with age, peaking at about 40 years, and declined in older ages. only 5% of infected individuals (2 of 39) had asymptomatic infection in the study. the study by Crowcroft et al reported a prevalence of asymptomatic infection of 48% and 49% in the siblings and parents, respectively. this suggests that the study might have missed subclinical infections, particularly in older children and adults. hRV infection 14 days before the start of RSV infection was associated with a reduced risk of asymptomatic infection. this association is more likely to be mediated through nonspecific cross-reactivity of innate immunity, such as the physiological status of respiratory epithelia following virus infection. ARD and the amount of virus shedding suggest vaccines that decrease viral shedding severity upon exposure to the virus could diminish transmission in the population. 34% of the symptomatic RSV episodes had the illness appear on average 4 days after first detection of the virus. we provide empirical data that will be useful in developing a realistic RSV transmission model for assessing the impact of RSV vaccines and other interventions on viral circulation. supplementary data consist of data provided by the author that are published to benefit the reader."}
