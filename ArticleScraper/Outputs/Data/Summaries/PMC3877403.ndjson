{"summary": "a mathematical model for communicable disease outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and public health interventions. the model generates estimated incidence at the i+1th serial interval using data from the ith serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence. it would be desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop accurate projections of their duration. in real time, predict the duration and size of epidemics, and quantify the transmission characteristics of new or mutated pathogens. however, typical model forms focus largely on epidemiological characteristics of the disease at the time of emergence. such models rarely account for the behavioral, regulatory, and informational interventions that are either put into place by public health authorities, or occur spontaneously in a worried public. the rate of growth of an epidemic is a function of both R0 and the average serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptoms developing in an index case and symptoms developing in a secondary case [15], [15]. we use a symptom-based interval so that the model is applicable in situations where microbiological or serological diagnosis is not available. we created a difference equation model with discrete time steps, each representing a single disease generation. the model was specified as: (3.0) (3.1) (3.2) Here S is the number of susceptibles in the population, I is the number of infectives and R is the number of immune individuals. the model was applied to an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) from the territory of nunavut, Canada, using an empirically derived serial interval of 5 days [18]. the model can be manipulated algebraically to generate estimates of tmax, the generation where the number of new cases is 1. cases likely represent a subset of total true influenza cases [21], [22]. no identifying data was shared with the research team or used for subsequent analyses. cases were normalized to the first day of the outbreak (day 1). the IDEA model is based on concept of the basic reproduction number, R0. the rate of growth of an epidemic is a function of both R0 and the average serial interval. the rate of growth of an epidemic is a function of both R0 and the average serial interval. the model may be fitted to available outbreak data when case counts are aggregated to reflect likely generation times. the model was specified as: (3.0) (3.1) (3.2) a difference equation model was created with discrete time steps, each representing a single disease generation. models were fit by minimizing root-mean-squared differences (RMSD) between generation-specific case counts by adjustment of the R0 and d parameters of the IDEA model. model can be manipulated algebraically to generate estimates of tmax, the generation where the number of new cases is 1, such that the outbreak is effectively over. a laboratory-confirmed case was reported as an individual with influenza-like illness or severe respiratory illness who tested positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. cases likely represent a subset of total true influenza cases [21], [22] no identifying data was shared with the research team or used for subsequent analyses. model fits for nunavut data were performed using the \"Solver\" application. results simulations Normalized sum of squares fits of the IDEA model to simulated data were best with first order control (i.e., = RRt), and were better for systems with low or moderate R0 (i.e., R0 = 5). the true R0 used in the SIR model was 3.0. IDEA model projections reproduce future case counts in the SIR model almost perfectly. simulated epidemics with high R0 initial convergence occurred rapidly as the epidemic grew. IDEA models are fit using generations that include and follow the epidemic peak (i.e., T> = 15) projections of both prevalent and cumulative infections become fairly accurate. however, estimated R0 is much larger than the true value (R07.56) and the best-fit value for d increases as well (from 0.054 to 0.069) the model generates an estimate of R0 and d at each point in an outbreak. it is then possible to rapidly project the estimated duration and total cases. this outbreak took place over 27 serial intervals and included 950 cases. the population of nunavut in 2011 was 31,906 [27] figures 5b, c and d show a key inflection point at which the outbreak suddenly began growing again. such biphasic outbreaks can occur for various reasons, such as the end of school closure periods, the arrival of a newly infected individual into a community or a reduction in a public health intervention. the model illustrates the new projection in the outbreak behavior as such events occur. each projection is based on the outbreak up to i intervals, projected to the i+1th interval. the projected case counts were less than the actual case counts. simulations Normalized sum of squares fits of the IDEA model to simulated data were best with first order control. best-fit values for the \u201cdiscount parameter\u201d d were approximately 0.054 or 0.055 for all low or moderate R0 models. the proportionate degree of over-estimation increased as the true R0 increased. IDEA models are fit using generations that include and follow the epidemic peak (T = 10). projections of both prevalent and cumulative infections become fairly accurate. however, estimated R0 is much larger than the true value (R07.56) and the best-fit value for d increases as well. the IDEA model generates an estimate of R0 and d at each point in an outbreak. it is then possible to rapidly project the estimated duration and total cases. this outbreak took place over 27 serial intervals and included 950 cases. in later stages of the outbreak, the model continues to provide a rapid analysis of the immediate direction of the outbreak. Figure 5c shows a key inflection point at which the outbreak suddenly began growing again. such biphasic outbreaks can occur for various reasons, such as the end of school closure periods, the arrival of a newly infected individual into a community or a reduction in a public health intervention. the model underestimated the actual number of cases at each serial interval. the model underestimated the actual number of cases except during two serial intervals. if validated, the implications may be profound. the application of the model to simulated epidemics with higher R0 (>5) was more challenging, as best-fit parameters derived from early outbreak generations resulted in epidemic curves that dramatically overshot true epidemics. however, the use of this technique for early R0 estimation when novel diseases emerge may be reasonable regardless of whether R0 is low or high. the model is constructed entirely on a case count time series that is likely to be available to public health professionals charged with outbreak control. it requires no sophisticated knowledge of mathematics or computing, and can be realized using commonly available spreadsheet programs. the model's outputs include both cumulative case counts under best-fit conditions, and cumulative outbreak duration. IDEA estimates of total epidemic size and duration. the figure plots percent deviation of the IDEA model from simulated epidemic size data. when R0 exceeded a threshold of 6, there was an increasing tendency for the IDEA model to project the epidemic to end later than was in fact the case. true R0 values are presented in the legend. it can be seen for R0 = 5, d stabilizes with a value of around 0.054. high R0 models demonstrate similar stability in d (and empiric values of d) prior to epidemic peaks. best-fit values of R0 and d for a biphasic epidemic are fairly stable. best-fit values of R0 and d for a biphasic epidemic are fairly stable."}
