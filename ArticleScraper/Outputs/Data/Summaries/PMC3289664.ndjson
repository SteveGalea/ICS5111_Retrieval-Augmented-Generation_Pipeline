{"summary": "the cause of pneumonia in intensive care units remains unknown in nearly 30% of cases despite extensive microbiological investigations. microorganisms previously identified include bacteria, fungi and viruses for which the role in the observed pathology is not clear. 185 episodes of ICU pneumonia and 25 control cases were studied using 16S rDNA gene amplification followed by cloning and sequencing. in preliminary results, we have reported the likely frequency of Tropheryma whipplei and the occurrence of vegetable DNA in pneumonia patients [12], [13]. results Bacterial microbiota as evaluated by 16S rDNA Molecular assays were positive for at least one bacterium for 129 out of 185 bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with pneumonia as well as from 13 out of 25 from control individuals. ne libraries of controls identified 38 species belonging to 4 different phyla. gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and anaerobic bacteria from oropharyngeal flora were the most frequent bacteria identified. 51 strictly anaerobic bacteria were found in patients versus 17 anaerobic bacteria found in controls.

Candida species were the most common fungal species identified in our study. qPCR detected fastidious bacteria Chlamydia pscitacii (1 case), Mycobacterium sp. (2 cases) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2 cases). qPCR enabled the detection of 7 different viruses. bacterial microbiota composition between community-associated pneumonia (CAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), non-ventilator ICU pneumonia (NV ICU-P), aspiration pneumonia (AP) and control subjects (CS) cohorts. bacteria, 7 fungi and 5 viruses were common to at least two cohorts. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mitis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Candida albicans and HSV were commonly identified irrespective of cohorts. monomicrobial controls have a slightly shorter period of mechanical ventilation before sampling compared to polymicrobials (p = 0.25; Table 3 and Table S7) the same observation was shown for length of ICU stay prior to sampling and for total length of hospital stay. 37.8 (1.7) 37.2 (1.2) 37.6 (1.4) Initial antibiotic therapy 18 33 2 9 Less than 2 days prior to sampling 6 17 0 3 3 days or more prior to sampling 12 16 2 6 Length of ICU stay prior to sampling, d (SD) 6.1 (9.1) 6.3 (10) 1.6 (1.1) 13.1 (15.6) Total length of hospital stay, d (SD) 26 (29.7) 28.2 (23.3) 4.3 (1.5) 36.6 ( uginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mitis were commonly found in the four studies. however, the pattern of distribution of many other species is distinctly heterogeneous and depending on the specific study and disease. Bacterial microbiota as evaluated by 16S rDNA Molecular assays were positive for at least one bacterium for 129 out of 185 bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with pneumonia. 157 different bacteria were identified at the species level. patients exhibited up to 15 bacteria in their BAL fluids (mean SD;3.482.80) patients exhibited 146 different species belonging to 7 different phyla. bacterial clone libraries of controls identified 38 species belonging to 4 different phyla. sequences of Streptococcus mitis (7% of the clone library) were identified along with 12 other bacteria in a control with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a history of aspiration pneumonia (AP) 6 days before BAL sampling. \u00b0 species/positive sample SD 1.30.48 1.110.31 1.270.46 10 1.150.36 1.090.30 CAP, community-associated pneumonia; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia; NV ICU-P, non-ventilator ICU pneumonia; AP, aspiration pneumonia; CS, control subjects. study only in pneumonia patients shown in red. 37 new phylotypes with 16S rDNA sequence similarity lower than 98% to known bacteria available in the GenBank database. bacterial phylotypes identified in patients were more diversified. phylotypes are reported according to their genus or by the last possible classification determined by the program. when possible, phylotypes with the same classification are clustered together. the frequency of phylotypes in each cohort is shown on the right. phylum, Sporidiobolales sp., Cryptococcus victoriae and Hyphoderma praetermissum were found for the first time in pneumonia BAL samples in the present study. Candida utilis and Periconia macrospinosa were identified only in controls. results obtained using routine serology and antigenemia for viruses and fastidious pathogens are available in Text S1 Comparison of the microbiota between pneumonias and controls. bacterial difference between patients and controls showed that bacteria belonging to Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria were dominant in patients. 58 bacteria, 7 fungi and 5 viruses were common to at least two cohorts, among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mitis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Candida albicans and HSV were commonly identified. positive pneumonia BAL fluids showed that 40 (25%) were characterized by the presence of one microorganism, whereas 116 (75%) were polymicrobial. monobacterial patients were more frequently, but statistically insignificant, subjected to initial antibiotic therapy than polymicrobial ones. monomicrobial controls have a slightly shorter period of mechanical ventilation before sampling compared to polymicrobial ones (p = 0.25; Table 3 and Table S7) gender 16 36 0 8 Immunocompromized 15 20 1 4 ARDS 15 19 0 4 CPIS (SD) 3.7 (1.8) 3.6 (1.7) 4.6 (0.5) 4 (1.4) SOFA score (SD) 6.9 (3.1) 6.7 (3.6) 6.3 (3.7) 5.4 (2.6) Radiologic score (SD) 5.5 (2.9) 4.8 (3.2) 3.6 (3.2) 5.3 (2.8) Temperature, \u00b0C (SD) 37.6 (1) 77 genera were restrictively identified across the studies. in contrast, 291 bacteria were restrictively identified across the studies. the pattern of distribution of many other species is distinctly heterogeneous. 11 N\u00b0 of controls 25 (13 positive cases) 21 (14 positive cases) 4 No 10 (BAL) 13 Profile of controls Without pulmonary infections With bronchiectasis No Smokers and non smokers healthy peoples COPD and healthy controls Type of samples BAL BAL Sputa BAL BAL and lung explants Left upper lobe brush N\u00b0 of determined species 160 121 57 53 ND 20 Total N\u00b0 of genera 81* 56 34 28 74 39 N\u00b0 of genera pulmonary microbiota heterogeneity can be observed between patients and controls. some pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus species, can be detected as commonly in controls as in patients. this is emphasized by more recent studies by Erb-Downward et al. and Hilty et al. molecular assay remains a more efficient method to detect microorganisms in the pneumonia samples. microorganism diagnosis was obtained for 156 (84%) episodes of pneumonia by molecular tools compared with 120 (65%) pneumonia episodes for which microorganism diagnosis was successfully done by culture. all bacteria that were first associated with pneumonia in the present study were exclusively identified by molecular methods. molecular approaches identified more fungal species than culture. fungal diagnoses were positive for 79 (42%) episodes of pneumonia by culture compared with 31 (17%) pneumonia episodes for which fungal diagnosis was successfully obtained. qPCR performed on their BAL fluids was negative. we failed to identify a microbial agent in only 7% of pneumonia episodes. this is significant when compared to previous studies where the microbial agent was not found in more than 30% of episodes of pneumonia. community-associated pneumonia, 106 episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 22 episodes of non-ventilator-associated pneumonia and 25 episodes of aspiration pneumonia. written informed consent was obtained from patients' family members. sequences were discarded from the study. sequences showing a similarity of >98% were considered to be known species. sequences showing a similarity of 98% were considered novel species.

DNA was tested by PCR using broad-range primers targeting the 16S rDNA gene.
