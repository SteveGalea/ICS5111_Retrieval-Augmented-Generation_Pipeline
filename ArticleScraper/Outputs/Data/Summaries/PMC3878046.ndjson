{"summary": "MERS-CoV causes symptoms similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but involving an additional component of acute renal failure. the role of kidney infection in MERS is not understood. the clinical picture of MERS-CoV infection is characterized by acute atypical pneumonia and respiratory failure, resembling symptoms caused by SARS-CoV [2-5] acute renal failure (ARF) was described in a number of MERS cases, with potential influence on disease severity. the broad search term was chosen due to inconsistencies of nomenclature before the consensus name MERS-CoV was announced. in total, the search revealed 655 publications, including 508 articles in PubMed, and 147 reports in ProMed. in cases where two reports on the same patient were available, only the report with the more detailed clinical description was selected. systematic search strategies were applied to identify all reports on patients\u2019 kidney function during MERS-CoV infection. data on patient sex and age, country of patient origin and travel route, onset of illness, presence or absence of ARF, date of onset of ARF, day of illness on which ARF occurred, and clinical outcome (death or survival) were extracted. 8 16 y m Saudi Arabia 3 Nov 12 No - Recovered [3] 9 31 y m Saudi Arabia 4 Nov 12 No - Recovered [3] 10 64 y m France ex Saudi Arabia 22 Apr 13 Yes 30 Apr 13 9 Fatal [6] 11 51 y m France 8 May 13 Yes 14 May 13 7 Recovered [6] 12 73 y m Germany ex Saudi Arabia 8 Mar 13 Yes 22 Mar 13 12 Fatal [5] y \u2013 years of age; controls, ACE2- and DPP-4-expressing primate cells were used as negative controls. cells known to be negative for ACE-2 (kidney cells from Syrian hamster [BHK]) or DPP-4 (kidney cells from African green monkey [COS-7]) were used as negative controls. cells known to be negative for ACE-2 (kidney cells from Syrian hamster [BHK]) were used as negative controls. all virus infection experiments were performed in triplicates. bars represent mean values, error bars represent standard deviation of triplicates. infection of human primary bronchial epithelial cells was studied in parallel. in a retrospective analysis of 536 SARS cases, only in 36 (6.7%) patients acute renal impairment was diagnosed. only very small amounts of viral RNA were detected in kidney tissue, and none in urine. post-mortem studies have been done systematically in SARS victims. in vitro studies of SARS-CoV with immortalized human proximal tubular epithelial cells showed replication without cell impairment as seen in our study. the abundant expression of both viruses\u2019 entry receptors in kidney epithelium argues against receptor-dependent limitations to viral kidney tropism. the abundant expression of both viruses\u2019 entry receptors in kidney epithelium argues against receptor-dependent limitations to viral kidney tropism. clinical guidelines should consider possibility that MERS patients may benefit from early induction of renoprotective treatment.
