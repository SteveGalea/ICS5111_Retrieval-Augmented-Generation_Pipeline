{"summary": "despite recent successes with biological agents as therapy for autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, many patients fail to respond adequately to these treatments. despite recent successes with biological agents as therapy for autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many patients fail to respond adequately to these treatments. a complex of molecules known collectively as the NADPH oxidase complex has the specific function of generating ROS to fuel the oxidative burst. a reduction in ROS might have been expected to decrease susceptibility to an inflammatory disease like RA. pristane, which does cause arthritis, caused a lower oxidative burst in the granulocytes. rats injected with phytol were protected from arthritis after pristane injection. they tested phytol as a treatment for active arthritis and found it reduced swollen joints. this study is an excellent reminder that there are no \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d biochemicals\u2014in the intricacies of cellular metabolism, it's all a matter of balance. a continued search for successful therapies for RA is extremely important. neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1) is an important subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex responsible for the one-electron reduction of oxygen that ultimately yields reactive oxygen species. this oxidative burst process is used by phagocytes primarily to kill invading pathogens [10]. this finding contradicts the hypothesis in current use that high levels of free radicals promotes inflammation. the experiments were approved by local (Malm\u00f6/Lund, Sweden) ethical committee license M70/01 and M70/04. the cells were cultured in D-MEM (Gibco, Paisley, UK) before they were assayed the cells were washed and resuspended in D-PBS (Gibco) to a concentration of 107 cells/ml. isoluminol and horseradish peroxidase were injected in a total volume of 200 l of PBS containing isoluminol and horseradish peroxidase (100 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and horseradish peroxidase type II (5 units/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) the scores of the four paws were added, yielding a maximum total score of 60 for each rat [16] unless stated otherwise, preventive treatment of arthritis was performed by SC injections of 200 l of phytol, C11, or C16 5 d before induction of arthritis. dative burst in granulocytes and T cells was determined by incubation of cells for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with biotin-labelled antibody HIS-48 (anti-granulocytes) cells were incubated with allophycocyanin-conjugated streptavidin (BD Pharmingen) for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. a 1:1:1 mixture containing thiobarbituric acid (3.75g/l; Sigma-Aldrich), TCA (15%), and HCl (0.33 M) was freshly prepared. 3 l of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (2% in ethanol) was added to 100 l of serum together with 200 l of the reaction mix and mixed vigorously. plasma diluted in PBS was added using biotinylated anti-IgG (Zymed) or anti-IgM antibody (BD Pharmingen) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ABTS tablets. the plasma was diluted in PBS and analyzed in duplicates. the amounts of bound IgG antibodies were estimated after incubation with isotype-specific antibodies (Zymed) followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and ABTS (Roche Diagnostics) as substrate followed by detection in a Spectra Max at OD405 nm. half of the pristane-injected rats were treated with 200 l of phytol SC day 13. the same rats were injected again in the same way on day 40 after pristane. DA rats were kept in a climate-controlled environment with 12 h light/dark cycles. the rats were found to be free from common pathogens including Sendai virus, Hantaan virus, coronavirus, reovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Mycoplasma pulmonalis. the cells were washed and resuspended in D-PBS (Gibco) before they were assayed the cells were washed and resuspended to a concentration of 107 cells/ml. dilution at 1%\u20135% concentration in 10% -cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) and oil-induced arthritis (CIA) were induced by a SC injection of 100 l of rat collagen type II (100\u2013150 g/rat) nonoil collagen-induced arthritis (NOCIA) was induced by emulsifying rat CII (300 g) in a mixture of LPS (50 g; Sigma-Aldrich), CPG (5\u2032-TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG comparisons to standard treatments were performed by injection of phytol (200 l SC), etanercept (generously provided by Prof. H. Burkhart, Erlangen, Germany; 0.4 mg/kg in PBS SC), or MTX (Wyeth Lederle, Solna, Sweden; 0.1\u20130.25 mg MTX/kg rat IP) on days 8, 10 and 12 in a total volume of 200 l. dihydrorhodamine-123 emits a bright fluorescent signal upon excitation by blue light. cells were then stimulated with 200 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. Ex Vivo Analysis of Lymphocyte Populations Blood, spleen, and draining LNs were taken from rats 5 d after SC injection with 200 l of phytol. cells were acquired on a FACSort (BD Biosciences) and B-to-T cell ratio was determined after gating on respective cell type. single-cell suspensions were prepared and red blood cells were lysed with 0.84% ammonium chloride (pH 7.4) cells were washed with PBS, then stained with OX-35 (anti-CD4) (BD Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. 0.05 M acetic acid was injected into the epidermis of the right external ear. delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response measured after 24 h. DA.Ncf1 DA rats were injected either with phytol and pristane or with pristane alone. half of the pristane-injected rats were treated with 200 l of phytol SC day 13. 11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol and pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane) had an oxidative burst-inducing capacity in vitro. pristane induced arthritis whereas phytol protected against it. alkanes (n = 4), phytol (Ph; n = 5), and pristane (Pr; n = 7) after SC administration. oxidative burst-inducing alkanes prevent arthritis. phytol was superior in inducing oxidative burst in vitro as well as in preventing arthritis when injected before induction of disease. we then investigated the dependency of arthritis-preventing effects on route of administration. phytol increases oxidative burst capacity in DA.Ncf1 DA rats. sera were taken 5 d after SC phytol injection in DA.Ncf1 DA. Phytol injection has a long-term effect on oxidative burst capacity of granulocytes. an increase in oxidative burst capacity was evident the day after phytol injection. pristane-injected rats increased compared to nave rats. phenotype of cells with longer lifespans than those of neutrophilic granulocytes is altered. the increase in oxidative burst could be a reflection of contaminating ROS from granulocytes. phytol did not significantly alter T cell distribution, as no effect on the ratio of CD4/CD8 was seen. phytol does not increase cell death. percentage of apoptotic (Annexin V+ and PI) and necrotic (Annexin V+ and PI+) CD4+ cells ex vivo 5 d after phytol injection. Phytol prevents collagen-induced arthritis in DA.Ncf1 DA rats. effect of SC administration of phytol (200 l) 5 d before immunization with CII (n = 7) Phytol decreases anti-CII antibody levels in plasma. alum, lipopolysaccharide, and a bacterial DNA sequence (CpG) were mulsified in a mixture of nonoil adjuvants, such as alum, lipopolysaccharide, and a bacterial DNA sequence (CpG) a CII injection in the ear showed phytol totally inhibited the DTH response. phytol decreases Arthritis Severity in established disease To be considered as phytol was injected IP twice (200 l) (arrows), starting day 70 after pristane injection in DA.Ncf1 DA rats with 3 d between treatments. the preventive effect of phytol is not dependent on genetic background. rats heterozygous for the functional Ncf1 (Ncf1 E3) allele with an arthritis susceptibility locus on Chromosome 6 were injected IP (200 l) with phytol at the estimated peak of disease (day 24, arrow; control, n = 13; phytol, n = 15). injection of histamine twice (200 l SC and IP), starting 10 d after phytol treatment. f1 E3 allele is enough to restore the oxidative burst and to prevent arthritis in DA. we used a DA double congenic rat strain expressing Ncf1 E3/DA. also a congenic fragment on Chromosome 6 allowing arthritis development [12]. phytol significantly lowered disease scoring after etanercept administration. phytol is as effective as or more effective than standard treatment for RA. on adoptively transferred PIA, we pretreated the recipient rats before or after transfer of arthritogenic T cells. phytol prevents adoptive transfer of arthritis when injected into the recipient DA.Ncf1 DA rat before onset. phytol has a rapid inhibitory effect on arthritogenic T cells. the time-point for the effect of phytol was titrated by administration of phytol (500 l SC) on different days after pristane injection (day 0) donor spleens were taken and analyzed for oxidative burst of granulocytes (n = 3) (D) no increase in oxidative burst capacity occurred in rats receiving cells from phytol-treated donors. this argues that ROS-producing cells affect the arthritogenic T cells in vitro or that the NADPH oxidase activation is transferred to the recipient. but when oxidative burst was measured in recipients 2 d after transfer, no differences were seen. some oils with an alkane structure had an oxidative burst-inducing capacity in vitro. pristane induced arthritis, whereas phytol protected against it. alkanes 11\u201313 carbons long were most potent in activating the NADPH oxidase complex. arthritogenicity of alkanes (n = 4), phytol (Ph; n = 5), and pristane (Pr; n = 7) after SC administration. oxidative burst-inducing alkanes prevent arthritis. phytol was superior in inducing oxidative burst in vitro as well as in preventing arthritis when injected before induction of disease. phytol increased oxidative burst capacity in DA.Ncf1 DA rats. s taken 5 d after SC phytol injection in DA.Ncf1 DA rats (200 l) or from nave DA.Ncf1 E3 compared to nave DA.Ncf1 DA (n = 5). Phytol injection has a long-term effect on oxidative burst capacity of granulocytes. pristane-injected rats increased oxidative burst response to PMA. pristane-injected rats increased compared to nave rats. phenotype of cell populations with longer lifespans than those of neutrophilic granulocytes. in granulocytes, T cells are minor producers of ROS. increase in oxidative burst could be a reflection of contaminating ROS from granulocytes. increased B/T ratio was altered after phytol injection. the phytol effect is not mediated by a general immune-suppressive effect. phytol suppresses CIA and CII autoimmunity. Phytol prevents collagen-induced arthritis in DA.Ncf1 DA rats. effect of SC administration of phytol (200 l) 5 d before immunization with CII (n = 7) CII was emulsified in a mixture of nonoil adjuvants, such as alum, lipopolysaccharide, and a bacterial DNA sequence (CpG) we found phytol totally inhibited the DTH response. phytol decreases Arthritis Severity in established disease. phytol was injected IP twice (200 l) (arrows), starting day 70 after pristane injection in DA.Ncf1 DA rats. rats treated before onset showed no signs of inflammation. phytol has an arthritis-ameliorating effect in rats that have a functional oxidative burst. rats heterozygous for the functional Ncf1 (Ncf1 E3) allele were injected IP (200 l) with phytol at the estimated peak of disease. DA.Ncf1 DA rats used a DA double congenic rat strain expressing Ncf1 E3/DA but also a congenic fragment on Chromosome 6 allowing arthritis development [12] phytol treatment in acute phase of disease resulted in a significant decrease in disease severity. this is important findings indicating that phytol can also be therapeutic in individuals with a normal oxidative burst capacity. phytol is as effective as or more effective than standard treatments for RA. etanercept was effective at different stages of arthritis. phytol inhibits arthritogenic T cells. phytol prevents adoptive transfer of arthritis when injected into recipient DA.Ncf1 DA rat. phytol inhibits arthritogenic T cells when injected in recipient DA.Ncf1 DA rat. the time-point for the effect of phytol was titrated by administration of phytol (500 l SC) on different days after pristane injection (day 0) donor spleens were taken and analyzed for oxidative burst of granulocytes (n = 3) (D) no difference in oxidative burst was seen after PMA stimulation. apoptosis did not increase after phytol injection, in agreement with data from 5 d after treatment. apoptosis did not increase after phytol, in agreement with data from 5 d after treatment. inflammatory disease pathway is based on reversing a phenotype caused by a genetic polymorphism responsible for increased severity of arthritis in both rats and mice [7,32], increasing the possibility that it also operates similarly in humans. a complete lack of ROS due to Ncf1 deficiency results in chronic granulomatous disease in both mice [33] and humans. granulocytes are the main ROS-producing cell type. this preventive effect could be seen after phytol treatment. oxidative burst could be a result of ROS leaking from surrounding granulocytes. polymorphism in PTPN22 has been shown to be associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases. mutation leads to a more potent negative effect on T cell receptor signalling. oxidized phospholipids could block Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of dendritic cells [43] and macrophages [44]. phytol represents a promising new class of pharmaceuticals to further investigate for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. cells were taken from different anatomical sites 5 d after phytol injection."}
