{"summary": "despite the bewildering complexity, some useful generalizations have emerged. in vivo veritas; in a colloquial tautology used in reference to viral vaccines and therapies, the only correlate of protection is protection. in cases for which human testing is unfeasible or unethical, indirect rationales for product licensure must be established on the basis of animal models. we share in the anticipation and excitement of how emerging technologies may offer new experimental insights into complex processes that were previously suspected but unapproachable. we share in the anticipation of how emerging technologies may offer new experimental insights into complex processes. a common language, with agreement upon the meaning of terms, is often missing from discussions of Ab-mediated immunity to viruses. overarching questions Some viruses yielded long ago to empirical approaches to vaccines and Ab therapies. empiricism and conventional strategies have not led to effective Ab-based therapies or vaccines. investigators turn to deeper understanding of: (1) the paratope (epitope-binding moiety) on the Fab; (2) the biological function-amplifying structures of Ig molecules located mostly in Fc; and (3) the unsolved complexities of how to construct vaccine Ags and microenvironments that induce Abs mirror those most desirable. \"Fc-independent\" Ab-binding is sufficient. Fe serves only half-life and valency \"Fc-dependent\" Ab-binding is necessary but insufficient. the special case of early, entry-associated targets for ADCC, best described with HIV, was covered in previous reviews (17, 20\u201323). the special case of early, entry-associated targets for ADCC, best described with HIV, was covered in previous reviews. infected cells display new and early CTAb targets (*) as the viral spike rearranges coincident with receptor engagement. the human data with ab therapy designed to eliminate cells are more advanced in oncology and autoimmunity than they are in virology. the human data with ab therapy designed to eliminate cells are more advanced in oncology and autoimmunity than they are in virology. mice tend to be wholly or partially resistant to infection and disease caused by human pathogens of greatest interest. a compromise is sometimes found by serial passage of virus in mice to achieve some semblance of human disease and protection. data were generally unconvincing in assigning clear relevance to Fc because of technical limits. cR interactions across species are problematic at best (26). classical adaptation of virus by serial passage sometimes fails repeatedly. accumulating evidence on nature of species barriers for any given virus may suggest that adaptation through mutation and selective pressure is highly improbable. transgenic mice expressing MERS-CoV receptor Identify and exploit naturally uncoupled (i.e., either/or) targets for anti-virion vs. anti-cell Abs Alphaviruses, poxviruses, flaviviruses. most viral systems reported to date lacked matching paratopes. c-dependent Ab activities on viral clearance in vivo have too often been subordinated to an unfruitful \u201ceither-or\u201d argument about relative importance of \u201cneutralizing\u201d vs. \u201cnon-neutralizing\u201d Abs. many (but not all) neutralizing monoclonal MAbs are also potent cell-targeting MAbs (CT-MAbs) animal models may be employed to examine effectiveness of ab given at various times before (prophylactically) or after (therapeutically) the cognate Ag, in this case viral antigen either on virions or cells. a complex array of binding and signaling events are required to reach a threshold of activity that is itself variable. the threshold is not a constant, but varies by individual, host species, virus biotype, dose and route of infection, etc. to adequately exploit these concepts with vaccines or therapeutic Abs requires either empirical good fortune (the key to almost all licensed vaccines) high-dose prozone presumably results from a diminution of the formation of complexes necessary for robust Fc-FcR interactions (56), akin to high-dose prozone in classical immunoprecipitation reactions. in experimental animal models, a range of Ab doses is preferred. in experimental animal models, a range of Ab doses is preferred. a given effector function may vary with different Ag-Ab pairs, exemplified by counter-examples in which HIV-specific MAbs against the \u201cmembrane proximal region\u201d of envelope may have negligible effector function. in vivo efficacy will be decisive, as they are confounded by mechanistic differences. literature is rich with the recognition of naturally occurring Fc and FcR alleles or variants (19, 59), followed by structural redesigns of Ab molecules to optimize Ab glycosylation (8, 12, 39) or Ab half-life (60) the details are outside the scope of this manuscript, but we call attention to the caution with which the Fc-dependent possibilities or limitations of a single MAb may be viewed during the course of experiments. antibody therapies against human tumors show important additive and augmenting effects mediated by complement. potential for restoration of inhibited CTAb activity is emerging opportunity for understanding and improving the protective capacities of CTAb against viruses. anti-CD47 Abs already in clinical trials. the efficacies of anti-tumor CTAbs are differently complex due to the typical incapacities to obtain human protection data. newer approaches have allowed increasing compatibility between a given virus (or its cell-expressed antigen), a susceptible animal model, Fc-FcR interactions, populations of FcR-bearing effector cells, etc. AS crafted the primary draft, which was improved, and approved by CO and GL. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
