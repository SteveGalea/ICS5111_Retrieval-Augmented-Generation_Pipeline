{"summary": "transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the Alphacoronavirus 1 species within the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. the virus causes enteric disease characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and high mortality in piglets in TGEV/PRCV-naive herds. monoclonal antibodies targeting antigenic regions of TGEV have been used to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for TGEV/PRCV differential serodiagnosis (17\u201320) no clinical signs were observed in pigs inoculated with TGEV Miller strain between 2 to 4 days postinoculation. no significant fecal shedding was detected in pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue or PRCV throughout the study. no significant fecal shedding was specifically detected by rRT-PCR in oral fluid samples collected from pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue. the percentages of TGEV antibody-positive serum samples reported by the three commercial ELISA kits evaluated over the 50-day study period for pigs inoculated with TGEV strains Purdue and Miller are presented in Fig. 2A to F. the first TGEV-specific antibody detection was reported between 7 and 10 dpi in both TGEV-inoculated groups. a nonspecific TGEV antibody response to PRCV-inoculated pigs was reported by the three ELISA kits between 7 and 42 dpi. no significant differences in the percentages of TGEV false positives were found between ELISAs over the monitoring period. however, the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive, regardless of the ELISA kit evaluated. results are presented considering suspect results to be positive (red bars) or negative (green bars) on PRCV-inoculated animals, an early PRCV-specific antibody response was first detected at 7 to 10 dpi by the three commercial ELISAs. the percentage of PRCV-seropositive animals detected by the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly lower than those with both the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (d study except at 7 dpi when the proportion of PRCV-false-positive animals detected by the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly greater (P 0.05) than that by the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA. diagnostic parameters are presented relative to the interpretation of suspect results as positive or negative. the diagnostic specificity of each test was calculated according to diagnosed TGEV or PRCV status in the negative-control group on dpi 7 and 42. overall, the diagnostic sensitivity for the TGEV Miller inoculation group was higher than for the TGEV Purdue group. ELISA kit showed the highest diagnostic sensitivity for antibody detection in pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Miller (94%), regardless of the interpretation of suspect results. diagnostic sensitivities for PRCV antibody detection obtained with both Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA (86%) and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (81 to 85%) were greater than that of the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit (54%) the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit showed the lowest analytical specificity (39%) of the kits when suspect results were interpreted as negative. no clinical signs were observed in pigs from the negative-control, TGEV Purdue, and PRCV-inoculated groups throughout the experiment. e (1 to 21 dpi), TGEV strain Miller (1 to 9 dpi) and PRCV (1 to 7 dpi) pigs inoculated with TGEV strains Purdue and Miller remained TGEV and PRCV seronegative throughout the monitoring period. pigs in the negative-control group remained TGEV and PRCV seronegative throughout the monitoring period. the first TGEV-specific antibody detection was reported between 7 and 10 dpi in both TGEV-inoculated groups. the number of TGEV antibody-positive pigs detected increased through the study, regardless of the ELISA kit used. results are presented considering suspect results to be positive (red bars) or negative (green bars) differences in the percentages of TGEV false positives were found between ELISAs over the monitoring period when suspect results were interpreted as negative. however, the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive. an early PRCV-specific antibody response was first detected at 7 to 10 dpi by the three commercial ELISAs. the percentage of PRCV-seropositive animals detected by the TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly lower than those with both the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA. sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, and analytical specificity of the three commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISA kits evaluated in this study are presented in Table 1. Diagnostic parameters are presented relative to the interpretation of suspect results as positive or negative. the diagnostic sensitivity for the TGEV Miller inoculation group was higher than for the TGEV Purdue-inoculated group. the diagnostic sensitivity for the TGEV Miller group was higher than for the TGEV Purdue-inoculated group. the diagnostic sensitivities for PRCV antibody detection obtained with both Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (86%) and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (81 to 85%) were greater than that of the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit (28%). the diagnostic specificity of any of the evaluated ELISA kits was unaffected by the interpretation of suspect results. seronegative pigs of all ages are susceptible to infection with TGEV (1, 21, 22), with the route of infection typically being oral or oral-nasal (23, 24) quarantine and testing for TGEV-seronegative animals are requirements for export/import into a herd. a region endemic for PRCV has less TGEV-associated disease. the exception is a large deletion (227 amino acids in length) in the amino terminus of the PRCV S protein that is responsible for the loss of hemagglutination activity (29). this deletion provided the opportunity to develop blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for differentiation of PRCV and TGEV infections. verification and monitoring of TGEV or PRCV viral shedding status were performed using rRT-PCR testing of pen-based feces and oral fluids. pigs inoculated with PRCV and TGEV Purdue, virus shedding was only detected in oral fluids. this could be related to differences in pathogenicity and tissue tropism. pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Miller showed mild watery diarrhea between 2 and 4 dpi. pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue showed mild watery diarrhea. differences in diagnostic sensitivity could be due to strain-related differences in virulence. study showed excellent diagnostic specificity, ranging from 99% (Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA) to 100% (Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA) results consistent with previous reports in the field where a TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISA showed a diagnostic specificity of 100% in wild boar populations historically free from coronavirus disease (34). this study confirms that the serological cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV is significant even when using TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISAs. previous reports indicated that the accuracy of the commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs for differentiating between U.S. TGEV and PRCV strains was low. the presence of TGEV remains a barrier to international livestock trade. the blocking ELISA format alone was determined to be useful in large swine populations for the detection of TGEV-infected herds. commercial ELISAs adapted to TGEV Purdue (ATCC VR-763), TGEV Miller (ATCC VR-1740) and PRCV (ATCC VR-2384) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746) were cultured in 25-cm2 flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) using MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. after incubation, 5 ml of postinoculation medium was added to each flask without removing viral inoculum. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. pigs within each group were housed in pens of 2 pigs in the same room. each pen was equipped with nipple drinkers and pigs were fed twice daily. the infectious dose used for each virus was previously determined in a pilot study. blood samples were collected on 7, 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days postinoculation (dpi) from the jugular vein or cranial vena cava using a single-use blood collection system. serum was separated by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 5 min, aliquoted into 2-ml cryogenic tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific spike (S) and TGEV/PRCV-specific nucleocapsid (N) genes were targeted and amplified by dually labeled probe-based rRT-PCR. rRT-PCR results were analyzed using an automatic baseline, with a threshold value of 0.1. transmissible gastroenteritis virus and PRCV CT data were reported as \"adjusted CT\" pig serum samples were tested using three commercially available TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISA kits. pig serum samples and controls were first added to the TGEV antigen-coated wells for the first incubation step. anti-TGEV MAb targeting the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein that is deleted in PRCV is added into the first well (odd column) or second well (even column), respectively, and attaches to specific free sites of the virus. when antibodies in the test sample occupy the binding sites on the antigen, the binding of the conjugated MAbs is blocked. lyses were conducted using commercial statistical software (SAS version 6.1.7601; Microsoft Corporation, USA) the percentage of results for TGEV/PRCV ELISA were interpreted (positive, negative, or suspect) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. commercial ELISAs were performed and the test results interpreted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746) were cultured in 25-cm2 flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) using MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin the flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. they were subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle at 80\u00b0C. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the virus content was harvested by collecting the supernatant. each pen was equipped with nipple drinkers. pigs were fed twice daily with an antibiotic-free commercial diet. the infectious dose used for each virus was previously determined in a pilot study. blood samples were collected on 7, 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days postinoculation (dpi) from the jugular vein or cranial vena cava using a single-use blood collection system. serum was separated by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 5 min, aliquoted into 2-ml cryogenic tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany), and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific spike (S) and TGEV/PRCV-specific nucleocapsid (N) genes were targeted and amplified by dually labeled probe-based rRT-PCR. rRT-PCR results were conducted on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Life Technologies) pig serum samples and controls were first added to the TGEV antigen-coated wells. if anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are present in the test sample, these sites will remain free. if anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are absent in the test sample, these sites will remain free. protein that is deleted in PRCV is added into the first well (odd column) or second well (even column) when antibodies in the test sample occupy the binding sites on the antigen, the binding of the conjugated MAbs is blocked. if anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are absent in the test sample, these sites will remain free. the percentage of seropositive animals per day postinoculation detected by each kit was interpreted (positive, negative, or suspect) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. significant differences were calculated using Pearson\u2019s chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test."}
