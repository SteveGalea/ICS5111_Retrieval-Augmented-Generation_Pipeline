{"summary": "ten to thirteen influenza outbreaks or probable pandemics have occurred since the 1700s. the 1918\u20131919 pandemic was the most severe. the 1918\u20131919 strain of influenza was unusual because of the high rate of mortality among victims between the ages of 15 and 35 years. both mechanisms of genetic mutation have the possibility of producing a new virus that can be easily transmitted between humans and initiate a pandemic. the 1918 influenza pandemic virus was a result of antigenic drift while the 1957\u20131958 and 1968\u20131969 influenza pandemic virus was a result of antigenic shift. the severe form of the disease is called \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" the H5N1 virus caused severe illness and high mortality among humans. among 18 people who were infected, 6 died. the outbreak ended after authorities slaughtered entire stock of 1.5 million poultry. the rapid spread of SARS to Asia, Australia, Europe and North America in the first two quarters of 2003 illustrates the speed that an AI pandemic can spread across the world. a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms, which limits the effectiveness of isolation of cases as a control strategy for this illness. d anti-viral treatment was a crucial component of all combined strategies. national and global strategies are needed to contain and control an avian flu pandemic. the earlier this fact is known, the more time there will be to gather and deploy available public health resources. if the influenza pandemic turns out not to be the H5N1 strain, then the stockpiled vaccines would be useless and wasted. critics have argued younger and healthier individuals should be given priority because they are more mobile than older, less healthy people. if the flu pandemic has characteristics of the 1918\u20131919 pandemic, then the young and healthy are at higher risk of death. only two anti-viral drugs have shown promise in treating avian influenza. oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) and zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) a treatment of Tamiflu includes 10 pills taken over five days. countries must set up AI pandemic contingency plans and high-level coordinating committees. the economic cost of an avian pandemic to all countries would be phenomenal. the response to the influenza threat would require an integrated cross-sector approach. GOARN is a technical collaboration of existing institutions and networks. it is critical to share information rapidly with experts, policymakers and the worldwide community at large. the avian influenza virus (AI) is a subtype that causes contagious respiratory disease mainly in birds. avian influenza is associated with near 100% mortality rates among domesticated birds. this is of concern because such birds often live in close proximity to humans. this increases the chance of genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses which may produce a mutant strain. virus satisfies the first two pre-requisites of a pandemic but has not developed the ability to be transmitted easily from human to human. a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms, which limits the effectiveness of isolation of cases. a carefully selected and orchestrated combination of public health measures could potentially stop the spread of an avian flu pandemic. interventions include an international stockpile to 3 million courses of flu antiviral drugs, treating infected individuals and everyone in their social networks, closure of schools and workplaces, vaccinating (even with a low-efficacy vaccine) half the population before the start of a pandemic and quarantine measures. global capacity for flu vaccine manufacture in the first 12 months is estimated at only 500 million doses. avian flu affecting poultry and eggs, the egg supply required for vaccine production may itself be disrupted. if influenza pandemic strain turns out not to be the H5N1 variety, then vaccines would be useless and wasted. the government terminated the campaign and indemnified manufacturers, ultimately paying $93 million in claims. the government recently announced plans to stockpile H5 influenza vaccine and create a policy framework for vaccine allocation and recommendations for its use. only two anti-viral drugs have shown promise in treating avian influenza. there are concerns about the safety of Tamiflu\u00ae which has been associated with increased psychiatric symptoms among Japanese adolescents. the sudden surge in health manpower and facility need would be challenged. countries must set up AI pandemic contingency plans and high-level coordinating committees. international community must also undertake long-term measures to strengthen capacity of animal health, human health and other relevant sectors in Asia. richer countries may have to support poorer countries in financial and non-financial means in the fight against a flu pandemic, for the sake of international good. global outbreak alert & response network (GOARN) is one such international body that supports global preparedness against bird flu. the earlier this fact is known, the more time there will be to gather and deploy available public health resources. the earlier this fact is known, the more time will be to gather and deploy available public health resources. there are ongoing efforts to mass produce and stockpile vaccines. in 1976, four US soldiers developed swine flu in an army camp. there was concern that it could become a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. the government initiated a mass inoculation programme for the entire US population. Tamiflu\u00ae needs to be taken within 2 days of initial flu symptoms. but many people may not be aware that they have the flu early in the disease. there are current concerns about the safety of Tamiflu\u00ae. ector approach bringing together animal and human health, areas of rural development and agriculture, economics, finance, planning and others. international resources are also needed for surveillance on avian influenza outbreaks and human-to-human transmission. a human pandemic may still emerge from a different strain of flu virus. medical-research funders and other stakeholders plan to develop, maintain and disseminate a central inventory of funded research activities that are relevant to human influenza. they will also coordinate road-mapping exercises to identify knowledge gaps to assist funders and researchers in establishing research-funding priorities. factors that suggest that an avian influenza pandemic would be less severe than past influenza pandemics include advances in medicine. avian influenza is endemic in Asia where birds often live in close proximity to humans. this increases the chance of genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses which may produce a mutant strain that is easily transmitted between humans. a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms."}
