{"summary": "the RMVA was formed to provide a venue that allowed formal presentations of current research in multiple areas of virology and prion biology. the 17th annual RMVA meeting upheld the tradition of presenting novel findings that spanned the fields of bio-informatics, host-pathogen interactions, immunology, therapeutics. despite strong overall structural similarity, regions of the envelope (E) glycoprotein revealed differences that suggested sequences that might be involved in the unique cell and tissue tropism that Zika has displayed. his team continued to probe the structure and composition of these viruses and their assembly intermediates using the tools of cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry. temperature profoundly impacts virus transmission via replication rate and the likelihood that virus will disseminate from the midgut and ultimately be transmitted. infected mosquitoes were exposed to fluctuating temperatures that varied from 25 to 35 \u00b0C diurnally. coinfection of aedes aegypti mosquitoes with all combinations of the three viruses is possible. co-transmission may occur with little impact on vector competence. only subtle differences in vector competence were observed. dengue viruses are the most aggressive arthropod-borne positive-strand RNA viruses in the world. despite lack of virus-derived lipid biosynthetic machinery, DENV2 was able to drastically alter cellular lipid content by manipulating SCD expression. sphingolipids are bioactive molecules that play roles in the structural composition of cellular membranes and cell-signaling pathways. SPs have also been highlighted in many studies as a lipid metabolic pathway altered by flavivirus infection. the balance between CER and its precursor, dihydroceramide, plays critical roles in membrane architecture, fluidity and function. the balance of CER and DHCER is a potential target for disrupting DENV transmission in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. dengue Viruses (DENV) are positive strand RNA viruses that account for almost 400 million infections annually making them the most aggressive human pathogens in the world. dengue virus uses the CCTalpha enzyme to increase and regulate phosphatidylcholine synthesis during viral replication. it has also been documented that PC accumulates in infected mosquitoes and mosquito cells as well as during Hepatitis C and poliovirus infection. fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) catalyzes elongation of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. fatty acids can be used as precursors for more complex cellular membrane lipid production. read lab validates role of this enzyme during dengue virus replication. preliminary evidence indicated a reduction in DENV replication in human cells through the inhibition of FADS2. inhibition of FADS2 will impede DENV replication by reducing presence of arachidonic acid in the cell from linoleic acid metabolism. ACOT-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in knockdown and control cells were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. deNV RNA levels increased five-fold above controls upon siRNA mediated knockdown of ACOT-1. ACOT-1 may be the first fatty acid enzyme that plays a protective role in host cells. infected cells can participate in paracrine signaling, thus enhancing viral replication in neighboring cells. vesicles released by ZIKV infection can activate the recipient cells and prime them for infection. vesicles released by the dengue virus protease can activate the recipient cells. human TRIM5 protein could function as a host-derived restriction factor for flaviviruses. TBEV replication is inhibited by TRIM30D, a rodent-specific ISG. TRIM5 colocalized with NS3 and dsRNA suggesting that TRIM5 disrupts the viral replication complex. understanding the genetic trade-offs in TRIM5 that enable restriction of one virus versus another will illuminate how the evolution of host resistance is shaped by multiple pathogens. high-risk papillomavirus E7 stabilizes APOBEC3A protein by inhibiting Cullin-dependent protein degradation. new studies have revealed abundant APOBEC3 signature mutations in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cervical and head and neck cancers, suggesting a role in HPV-positive cancer progression. scientists have screened 216 yeasts from the Saccharomyces genus. they identified 30 strains capable of producing protein toxins that inhibit the growth of fungi. 77% of these newly identified \u201ckiller yeasts\u201d were infected with viruses from the Totiviridae family. herpesviruses are typically associated with a single host species in nature. transmission from host-to-host is an essential component in the herpesvirus\u2019 life cycle. but when they transmit across species, the outcome is often deadly. mule deer-derived herpesvirus is most closely related to ruminant alphaherpesviruses, including cervid herpesvirus-1 (CvHV-1, 93% identity), cervid herpesvirus 2 and bovine herpesvirus 1 (CvHV-1, 91% identity), BHV-5 and buffalo herpesvirus (90% identity), and caprine herpesvirus (86% identity) serologic cross-reactions with BHV-1 were detected. titers were significantly lower (p values /= 0.008) based on paired students t-test. v-cyclin is critical for specific aspects of HV68 infection. the cyclin D/p18 regulatory hub was critically required for normal B cell development and differentiation. the cyclin D/p18 regulatory hub was disrupted in many B cell lymphomas. this research further characterizes the specific interplay between distinct cyclin functions and host p18 in virus reactivation. pp71 is bound to the DNA at the 1q42 breaksite and the NID1 promoter leading her to suspect it is responsible for transcriptional regulation. the targeting of NID1 by two separate viral proteins via two separate pathways highlights the importance of NID1\u2019s elimination to the virus. interleukin 8 (IL-8) antigen in 17/20 (85%) GCA-positive, 18/20 (90%) GCA-negative, and 2/18 (11%) normal TAs. IL-8 appears to be upregulated in both GCA-positive and -negative TAs. we hypothesize that a persistent release of cytokines suppresses virus. interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon alpha (IFN) and IFN individually aid in limiting VZV growth and spread. this provides a better understanding of the relationship between the immune system, human neurons, and VZV latency. zoster virus (VZV) vasculopathy occurs after virus reactivates from ganglia, spreads along nerve fibers to arteries, leading to pathological vascular remodeling and stroke. nehrotorpic alphaherpesvirus exits neuron during virus reactivation. mock-infected cells expressed E-cadherin and not N-cadherin. conditioned media from VZV-infected cells contained a soluble factor that was able to induce the same changes seen in VZV-infected cells. findings suggest that claudin-1 is not necessary for VZV infection. the results showed that VZV infection modulates expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein signaling in both human neurons and fibroblast cells. further studies were described to help elucidate mechanisms of how VZV-infection may alter lipid metabolism for a better understanding of why patients on statins are more likely to experience zoster. functional clustering revealed a profile that, hypothesize, reflects a cellular environment permissible for virus replication. HSV-1 reduces host gene expression, working in combination with virion host shut-off protein (vhs) in some cases, while ramping up host gene transcription to transcend the effects of vhs in other cases. herpesviruses in human trigeminal ganglia will provide clues to the mechanism by which virus gene transcription is controlled during latency and reactivation. prion diseases are a group of inevitably fatal neurodegenerative diseases affecting mammals, including humans. new work has found both internal and external plant surfaces are able to bind and retain infectious prions. the results provide new insights into the role of plants in transmission of chronic wasting disease (CWD) the development of in vitro detection assays for hematogenous prions has been hampered by the presence of inhibitors found in blood that interfere with detection methodologies. they have demonstrated prions by IOMB-RT-QuIC in blood harvested minutes post prion exposure (15 min, 30 min, 60 min, one week, two weeks, n = 8 deer with 16 replicates/animal/time) Candace Mathiason (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA) continued the theme of pathogen and host interactions. they presented their use of real time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) to detect blood-borne prions in buffy coat cells harvested from longitudinal chronic wasting disease (CWD) infection studies. it is currently estimated that 1:2000 individuals in the united kingdom are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD. ultra-sensitive assays for prions and prion-like misfolded protein aggregates. many neurodegenerative diseases involve the pathological accumulation of fibrillar aggregates of specific proteins such as A and tau in Alzheimer\u2019s. RNA assays for tauopathies and synucleinopathies have also begun to appear. they can detect billion-fold dilutions of brain tissue from human cases. these seeded fibrillization assays have the potential to greatly improve the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for multiple neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases. cellular Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) senses and restricts the Influenza A Virus ribonucleoprotein complex. the human genome encodes approximately 100 TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases. TRIM25 inhibits viral RNA synthesis in a direct manner. TRIM25 may act as a barrier to the cross-species transmission of influenza viruses in the wild. TRIM25 is the first portable next-generation sequencing instrument. it is capable of producing long-reads of single molecules from DNA and RNA libraries. the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and associated fetal microcephaly mandates efforts to understand the molecular processes of infection by this emerging global pathogen. sfRNAs are highly conserved and have been linked to the pathology of the virus in cell culture and mouse model systems. picornaviruses contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome replicated by 3 Dpol, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) a previous study in coxsackievirus showed mutations within the RdRP palm domain resulted in changes to both fidelity and elongation rate. a 44-nucleotide structured RNA element at the beginning of the viral 3\u2032 UTR was sufficient to inhibit 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonucleolytic decay in vitro. they solved the three-dimensional structure of a complete Dianthovirus nuclease-resistant RNA (xrRNA) by X-ray crystallography. the xrRNA element functions as a structural switch, triggered by the arrival of an exonuclease from clease-resistant RNA structures of arthropod-borne flaviviruses differ greatly. the overall fold of flaviviral and dianthoviral nuclease-resistant RNAs differ greatly. this observation highlights how highly divergent RNA viruses have developed similar RNA-based strategies to inhibit exoribonucleases. doc (MODV), Montana Myotis Leukoencephalitis (MMLV), Cell Fusing Agent (CFAV) and Tick Borne Encephalitis (TBEV) viruses also produce sfRNAs following Xrn1 degradation. using selective 2\u2032 hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemical probing they have been able to characterize these evolutionarily diverse xrRNAs into two distinct structural \u201cclasses\u201d. serological studies indicated high prevalence to these viruses among many species of Phyllostomidae leaf-nosed fruit bats of central and south America. the bats exhibited no clinical signs of disease. however, rectal swabs had up to 104 TCID50 equivalents of HL18NL11 viral RNA (vRNA) by real-time PCR in each bat on days 2, 4 and 7 post-inoculation. adults with Down syndrome (DS) are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections. respiratory disease is a primary cause of death in individuals with DS over the age of 20 years. the V920 vaccine is a live, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-Indiana (VSV-I) where the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV) the vaccine has been tested in numerous Phase 1\u20133 clinical trials. the first cells within the body that are virus antigen positive have been shown to support EBOV replication over the course of infection. they are thought to support EBOV replication over the course of infection, resulting in the production of dysregulated cytokines/chemokines. a method for longitudinal mosquito saliva collection for determining arbovirus vector competence increases biosafety and throughput. the recent emergence of Zika, chikungunya and yellow-fever viruses emphasizes the need for rapid, reliable, and safe methods for analyzing vector competence from various species of mosquitoes. bluetongue virus (BTV) is spread by members of the genus Culicoides. it may lead to a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease in certain species. cattle are susceptible to infection but generally asymptomatic. west Nile virus (WNV) is a positive strand RNA virus (Flaviviridae) that is transmitted by mosquitoes. the virus is normally maintained and amplified in avian reservoir hosts. infected mosquitoes will also bite other vertebrates and can result in the transmission of the virus. the Gunnison\u2019s prairie dog is one of five species of prairie dogs native to north America. the most significant factor affecting survival of prairie dog species in Colorado is epizootics of plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) the greatest number of reads of this sequence was found in tumor samples. this represents a candidate for a novel retrovirus associated with thymic lymphomas in prairie dogs. the progression of FeLV infection has been well documented in domestic cats. human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transmission to a new individual elicits a strong selective bottleneck on the existing virus population. only very recently have these transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 variants been appreciated for their unique ability to initiate an infection. a single point mutation in the HIV-1 genome is evaded with a single point mutation. another (tetherin) is polymorphic in owl monkeys with some individuals encoding ineffective alleles. they harnessed the genetic diversity of multiple owl monkey colonies to define key molecular interactions of T/F HIV-1 biology. mulated genes had significantly elevated rate of nonsynonymous mutations. induction genes were not elevated significantly when compared to the null set. rapid evolution may indicate that viruses are enhancing selective pressure for new mutations, specifically in interferon-stimulated genes. BPNV is part of an expanding group of related viruses that have been associated with respiratory disease in reptiles and mammals. their findings establish a causal relationship between BPNV infection and respiratory disease in ball pythons. new world monkeys have acquired adaptive mutations in CCR5 that protect them from cross-species transmission in primates. this suggests the compelling hypothesis that new world monkeys have acquired adaptive mutations in CCR5 that protect them from these viruses. this suggests the compelling hypothesis that new world monkeys have acquired adaptive mutations that protect them from these viruses. the ability of the MERS-CoV spike to adapt to diverse host species receptors may play a significant role in cross-species transmission. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito borne flavivirus that has been prevalent in Asia, parts of Africa, and Central and South America. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that is currently outbreaking. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that is currently outbreaking. imatinib reduced the percentage of infected cells by approximately 45% at 24 h post treatment, while maintaining normal cell viability. further testing is currently underway to determine the optimal concentrations for DCA and imatinib to reduce viral replication and still maintain cell viability. two chimera-inoculated cats received more chimeric virus and two wt FFV. chimeric vector system can induce a detectable immune response in domestic cats comparable to wt infection, and that FFV is capable of superinfection. cannabinoid receptors (CB1) alter cellular physiology and increase anabolic pathways. alterations to metabolic pathways directly impact the ability of the virus to successfully replicate and produce new virions. they hypothesized that activation or inhibition of the CB1 receptor/endocannabinoid signaling pathway will cause specific changes in cellular physiology. the outcomes of oncolytic virus treatment of dogs with spontaneous tumors may be better predictors of human cancer response to treatment. the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of intratumoral injection of myxoma virus lacking the serp2 gene (MYXVserp2) maternal infections during pregnancy induce immune factors and present infectious agents to the maternal-fetal interface. the hallmark of successful pregnancy includes a maternal immunological profile skewed towards an anti-inflammatory response. disruption of microbiota has been linked to proinflammatory responses. the emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) has become an increasingly-growing public concern. emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) has become an increasingly-growing public concern. aedes albopictus mosquito vectors exposed the mosquitoes to fluctuating temperatures that varied from 25 to 35 \u00b0C diurnally. they found that transmission of ZIKV in both mosquitoes was most efficient at 28 \u00b0C (p 0.05) but viral load in the midgut and hemolymph was highest at 35 \u00b0C (p 0.05). mosquitoes were exposed to CHIKV (99659), DENV-2 (Merida) or ZIKV (PRVABC59) in single and triple infections. infection with more than one arbovirus simultaneously may affect virus evolution. dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) alters fatty acid metabolism during infection. despite lack of virus-derived lipid biosynthetic machinery, DENV2 was able to drastically alter cellular lipid content by manipulating SCD expression and thus produce mature virions. metabolomics study of midguts from aedes aegypti mosquitoes identified and reconstructed a significant proportion of the SP pathway. they observed an accumulation of precursors and downstream derivatives of ceramide (CER), a hub of the SP pathway, during DENV infection. the balance between CER and its precursor plays critical roles in membrane architecture, fluidity and function. dengue Viruses (DENV) account for almost 400 million infections annually. positive strand RNA viruses share common characteristic of reorganizing host cellular phospholipid membranes to assemble their viral replication complexes. how these viruses regulate membrane reorganization is unknown. dengue viruses (DENV) are arthropod borne viruses with widespread impact consisting of 390 million new cases every year. viruses such as dengue, dengue, and now Zika are becoming increasing threats to the united states. fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) enzyme activity is a control point to limit dengue virus serotype 2 replication. despite the prevalence of dengue fever, there are currently no fda-approved vaccines or antivirals. dengue viruses infect over 400 million people per year, but only a suboptimal vaccine exists. previous studies indicate that DENV utilizes lipids to replicate in host cells. deNV RNA levels increased five-fold above controls upon siRNA knockdown of ACOT-1. ACOT-1 may be the first fatty acid enzyme that plays a protective role in host cells against deNV infection. the Montgomery lab shifted the conversation to host protein targets predicted to be cleaved by the dengue virus protease. a machine learning approach has created a predictor to search for Dengue protease cleavage sites within the human proteome. they have validated that several human proteins in this candidate list were cleaved by the protease. both human (h) and rhesus (rh) TRIM5 restricted the replication of viruses belonging to the TBEV serogroup, but not WNV. TRIM5 colocalized with NS3 and dsRNA suggesting that TRIM5 disrupts the viral replication complex. acute-stage isolates of HIV-1 require two receptors to enter cells. the surface glycoprotein of HIV-1, Envelope (Env) mediates interaction with these receptors facilitating virus entry into cells. the Warren lab showed that HIV-1 is highly adapted to use human CD4 and that nonhuman primate forms of CD4 restrict HIV-1 entry. a member of the APOBEC3 family is upregulated in HPV-positive keratinocytes. high-risk HPV E7s, but not low-risk HPV (HPV6 and 11) E7s, inhibit A3A proteasomal degradation. this effect was mediated by the motifs in the domain of HPV16 E7 involved with interaction with Cullin 2 (CUL2). 77% of these newly identified \u201ckiller yeasts\u201d were infected with viruses from the Totiviridae family. 93% contained double-stranded RNA satellites, which encode antifungal toxins. they hypothesized sequence polymorphisms found within dsRNA satellites were responsible for the variation in toxin tropism. herpesviruses are typically associated with a single host species in nature. but when they transmit across species, the outcome is often deadly. the macaque herpes B virus causes fatal encephalitis when transmitted to humans. isolates found that they were identical (>99.8% identity) mule deer-derived herpesvirus is most closely related to ruminant alphaherpesviruses, including cervid herpesvirus-1 (CvHV-1, 93% identity), cervid herpesvirus 2 and bovine herpesvirus 1 (CvHV-2, BHV-1, 91% identity), and caprine herpesvirus (86% identity) the van Dyk lab demonstrated that a conserved viral homolog of cellular cyclins (v-cyclin) is critical for specific aspects of HV68 infection. they found that v-cyclin function in reactivation was complemented by the v-cyclin of KSHV and by host cyclin D3. HCMV congenital infection in the us affects 1% of newborns annually. five to 10% of congenitally infected infants display negative central nervous system consequences at birth and another 10\u201315% develop sequelae within the next few years. Teresa Mescher described work providing a mechanistic pathway through which the neurotropic alphaherpesvirus, varicella zoster virus, may contribute to the development of a serious disease in the aging human population. she described work providing a mechanistic pathway through which the neurotropic alphaherpesvirus, varicella zoster virus, may contribute to the development of a serious disease in the aging human population. IL-8 appears to be upregulated in both GCA-positive and -negative TAs. the upregulation of IL8 is consistent with the presence of neutrophils in all GCA-positive TAs and most GCA-negative TAs. a new model system is poised to begin understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pains of zoster and PHN. a nehrotorpic alphaherpesvirus could exit the neuron during virus reactivation. a nehrotorpic alphaherpesvirus could exit the neuron during reactivation. VZV vasculopathy occurs after virus reactivates from ganglia, spreads along nerve fibers to arteries, leading to pathological vascular remodeling and stroke. her lab hypothesized that during VZV spread along nerve fibers, the virus may disrupt tight junctions in perineurial cells. claudin-1 is not necessary for VZV infection. upregulation of claudin-1, downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin is mediated by a soluble factor. this may lead to disruption of tight junctions in perineurial cells. precision nuclear run-on (Pro-seq) is used to map RNA polymerase II (Pol II) location on actively transcribed genomes to a single base pair resolution. the Baines\u2019 lab characterized Pol II occupancy on host genes 3 h post-infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) a set of tilled oligonucleotides were used to enrich virus sequences in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays targeting CTCF-protein. analysis of virus DNA within the enriched sample described definite peaks at known CTCF-motifs located at cell gene promoters. prion disease introduced prion disease, and how prion strain interactions during incubation periods affect strain dynamics. prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. a long incubation period strain inhibits the replication of a short incubation period strain. it is unknown if two long incubation period strains can interfere with each other. a brain homogenate from a terminally ill elk for either 2 h, 24 h or 72 h. plants were homogenized to a 10% (w/v) homogenate and tested for chronic wasting disease prions (PrPCWD) at 24 hpe, PrPCWD was detected in root tissues after PMCA. progress in developing in vitro detection assays for hematogenous prions has been hampered by the presence of inhibitors found in blood that interfere with detection methodologies. the development of antemortem detection of blood-borne prions for humans, cervids and other susceptible species is of utmost importance for human public health, animal monitoring of prions. it is estimated that 1:2000 individuals in the united kingdom are asymptomatic carriers of vCJD. progress in developing in vitro detection assays for hematogenous prions has been hampered by the presence of inhibitors found in blood that interfere with detection methodologies. many neurodegenerative diseases involve the pathological accumulation of fibrillar aggregates of specific proteins such as A and tau in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, tau in frontotemporal dementias, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other tauopathies. a major clinical problem is the inability to accurately discriminate and diagnose many of these diseases, which can have complex and overlap clinical manifestations. two types of dynamic cytoplasmic RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals. stress granules contain stalled translation initiation complexes. RNA viruses antagonize RNA granules for replicative advantages. the human genome encodes approximately 100 TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases. TRIM25 is a component of the RIG-I signaling cascade that activates the interferon response upon sensing foreign viral RNA. the mechanism by which TRIM25 inhibits viral RNA synthesis is unique. the minION by Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc. is the first portable next-generation sequencing (NGS) instrument. it produces long-reads of single molecules from DNA and RNA libraries. the minION runs produced reads ranging from less than 1 kb to over 500 kb in length. sfRNAs are highly conserved and have been linked to pathology of the virus in cell culture and mouse model systems. sfRNAs are formed by co-opting Xrn1, the cell\u2019s predominant 5\u20323\u2032 exonuclease. the viral RNA genome contains highly structured Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), which halt the enzyme leaving sfRNAs behind. a previous study in coxsackievirus showed mutations within the RdRP palm domain resulted in changes to both fidelity and elongation rate. a set of chimeric polymerases based on poliovirus and coxsackievirus 3Dpols have been constructed by exchanging the fingers domains entirely or only the pinky finger motif between the two viral polymerases. a 44-nucleotide structured RNA element at the beginning of the viral 3\u2032 UTR was sufficient to inhibit 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonucleolytic decay in vitro. they solved the three-dimensional structure of a complete Dianthovirus nuclease-resistant RNA (xrRNA) by X-ray crystallography. the xrRNA element functions as a structural switch, triggered by the arrival of an exonuclease from the family flaviviridae contains enveloped viruses that are vector borne and have positive sense, single stranded RNA genomes. sfRNAs are made via incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the host 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease Xrn1. sfRNAs have been shown to be necessary for both cytopathicity and pathogenicity during WNV. the sequences required for Xrn1 halting are more variable than previously suspected. the halt sites in the 3\u2032 UTR of WNV are capable of stopping other exonucleases as well, including bacterial enzyme RNase J1. Ongoing studies also include infection models and large-scale manipulation of xrRNAs in the Dengue Virus 3\u2032UTR. the bats exhibited no clinical signs of disease. rectal swabs had up to 104 TCID50 equivalents of HL18NL11 viral RNA (vRNA) by real-time PCR in each bat. the King lab hypothesized that adults with DS will have an attenuated antibody response to immunization. antibody titers to influenza A, influenza B and Bordetella pertussis were evaluated using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the vaccine candidate is replaced with the glycoprotein of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV) the vaccine has been tested in numerous Phase 1\u20133 clinical trials. a wild-type VSV-I was used as a positive control. macrophages treated with interferon gamma (IFN-) profoundly inhibited EBOV infection. in contrast, treatments that shift a macrophage towards an M2 phenotype, enhanced EBOV GP/rVSV infection. iFN-treated peritoneal macrophages transferred into a nave mouse were protected against lethal virus challenge. arboviruses transmit from the mosquito to the vertebrate host via mosquito saliva. current collection methods are laborious and typically require sacrificing the mosquito, limiting researchers to a single saliva collection time point per insect. a 3D printed lid covered with organdy turned 12-well plates into suitable habitats for anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti. er, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, domestic sheep, and bighorn sheep are susceptible to infection but generally asymptomatic. each summer for three seasons, 20 maternal antibody positive and 20 maternal antibody negative spring-born calves were tested twice monthly for BTV antibodies. mercury exposure has been associated with suppressed immune responsiveness in captive song birds. over 800 bird blood samples have been collected over the last four years. the retrovirus is associated with thymic lymphoma in Gunnisons\u2019s prairie dogs. prairie dogs are highly sensitive to plague infection, with death occurring rapidly in infected animals with no apparent clinical signs prior to death from acute septicemia. as part of plague research and management efforts in Colorado, prairie dogs were captured from several colonies across the state. study showed Feline leukemia virus replicates faster in mountain lion cells. infection has not been thoroughly investigated in atypical hosts. in domestic cats, four types of infection have been documented. human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transmission to a new individual elicits a strong selective bottleneck on the existing virus population. only one or few very special viral variants establish each new infection. the vast majority of HIV-1 research has been performed using lab-adapted or late-stage HIV-1 variants. interferons and interferon-stimulated genes are involved in a variety of mechanisms that suppress viral replication within host cells. Upon recognition of a virus, a signaling cascade leads to the expression of secreted interferons. viruses have evolved strategies to subvert the interferon response by evading recognition, impairing signaling, or hindering restrictive functions. a severe respiratory illness of pythons has been observed by veterinarians since the 1990s. they conducted an experimental infection in ball pythons (Python regius) to test the hypothesis that ball python nidovirus (BPNV) infection would yield clinical signs and histologic lesions consistent with respiratory disease. studies have revealed insights into clinical course, possible routes of transmission, useful diagnostics, viral genomic diversity, species specificity, and disease epidemiology of the python nidovirus. the evolution and functional relevance of species-specific differences in CCR5 has been overlooked. the evolution and functional relevance of species-specific differences in CCR5 has been overlooked. researchers studied the viral spike plasticity in the context of the common vampire bat receptor. a novel coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was discovered in 2012 in humans and dromedary camels. this range of animal hosts lead them to hypothesize that MERS-CoV can readily adapt to new hosts. the most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis and headache; however compilations have been observed in infected newborns. this study was undertaken to determine an immune-competent, non-primate, small animal model that would be valuable for understanding the mechanism of ZIKV sexual transmission. al treatments for alphaviruses infect millions of people and animals. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that is currently outbreaking. feline foamy virus (FFV) is a Spumavirus that has not been associated with a disease syndrome in domestic cats despite life-long infection. we inoculated wt-inoculated cats with wild-type (wt) FFV or a chimeric FFV-Vif virus containing the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vif gene replacing the FFV bet gene. chimera-inoculated cats had comparable anti-Gag antibody titers. the four cats initially inoculated with wt FFV seroconverted against Bet by 42 days post-inoculation. the two chimera-inoculated cats later exposed to wt FFV seroconverted by 45 days post-inoculation. signaling pathway will cause specific changes in cellular physiology. all tests have been performed with the prototype alphavirus. this is a plus strand RNA virus transmitted by infected mosquitoes. MYXVserp2 was injected intraumorally in five dogs with soft tissue sarcoma. tumor biopsies, blood, urine, feces, saliva, and swabs were collected. no adverse effects have been observed in any canine cancer patients. the hallmark of successful pregnancy includes a maternal immunological profile skewed towards an anti-inflammatory response. disruption of microbiota has been linked to proinflammatory responses. the relationship between these responses and the impact their interactions have on transplacental trafficking is unknown. students use pre-lab quizzing to prepare for daily labs, make predictions based on phylogenetic trees, and perform blast searches on sequences. examples and materials used in each type of teaching environment were presented."}
