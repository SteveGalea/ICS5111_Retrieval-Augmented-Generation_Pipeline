{"summary": "coronaviruses infect a wide variety of mammals and birds, causing respiratory and enteric diseases and, in some rarer cases, hepatitis and neurologic disease. infection can be acute or persistent [2] virion envelope contains at least three viral proteins, the spike protein (S), the membrane protein (M) and the envelope protein (E) some coronaviruses also contain a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) the genome of four different coronaviruses is depicted. the genome of four different coronaviruses is depicted. the genome of four different coronaviruses is depicted. spike protein is a large type I transmembrane protein ranging from 1,160 amino acids for avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and up to 1,400 amino acids for feline coronavirus (FCoV) this protein is highly glycosylated as it contains 21 to 35 N-glycosylation sites. the coronavirus spike protein contains two subdomains, a N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). both are able to function as receptor binding domains (RBDs) and bind variety of proteins and sugars. fusion protein contains in their C-terminal part regions predicted to have an -helical secondary structure. heptad repeats comprise a repetitive heptapeptide abcdefg with a and d being hydrophobic residues characteristic of the formation of coiled-coil that participate in the fusion process. the functional role of MHV and SARS-CoV HR was confirmed by mutating key residues and by inhibition experiments using HR2 peptides. a mutant MHV-A59 strain exhibiting altered tropism was isolated from persistently infected microglial cells. the single mutation Q159L in the S1 domain is responsible for reduced replication in the liver and low hepatotropism of the virus. feline coronaviruses (FCoV) provide a fascinating example of the critical involvement of the spike protein in tropism and pathogenesis [17] there are two known serotypes, 1 and 2, based on serological and genetic characteristics of their spike. feline coronaviruses provide a fascinating example of the critical involvement of the spike protein in tropism and pathogenesis. FECV 79\u20131683 and FECV 79\u20131146 have similar growth characteristics in established feline epithelial cells. but only FECV 79\u20131146 but not FECV 79\u20131146 has the ability to efficiently infect and replicate in macrophages. authors found that the exchange of the chimeric recombinant virus with that of FECV 79\u20131683 in the FIPV 79\u20131146 genetic background strongly reduced the chimeric the difference in tropism mediated by S proteins results from different mechanisms linked to the two main functions of the protein: receptor binding and fusion. the difference in tropism mediated by S proteins results from different mechanisms linked to the two main functions of the protein. the MHV/BHK virus infects cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent and CEACAM1-independent manner. the heparan sulfate binding sites are required to acquire the CEACAM1-independent phenotype. the virulence is correlated to the length of a hypervariable region present within S1. the virus is a type II transmembrane protein expressed on the apical domain of epithelial cells of respiratory and enteric tracts. it has been shown that tropism differences of these viruses are due to the ability of their spike proteins to recognize small species-specific amino acid differences in APN. hemagglutinating activity was mapped to residues 145\u2013155 of TGEV spike protein. it has been shown that a mutation abrogating this activity reduced the enteropathogenicity of the virus. a study has shown that the sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is responsible for binding of an additional protein designated as mucin-like glycoprotein (MPG) in brush border membranes. heparin-agarose beads can bind heparin. heparin has a very similar structure to heparan sulfate. heparin binding motif proposed by authors resides in defective furin cleavage site at boundary between the S1 and S2 domains. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein abundantly expressed in lung tissue. it is a mono-carboxypeptidase that hydrolyses angiotensin II. adaptation of the virus to humans was due to two point mutations. the coronavirus spike is heavily glycosylated providing the virus with the opportunity to interact with host lectins such as DC/L-SIGN. in-trans transmission of SARS-CoV by dendritic cells to susceptible target cells has been documented. the role of lectins in IBV infection in vivo is undetermined. entry and Fusion Enveloped virus entry can occur directly at the cell surface. fusion can occur directly at the cell surface after receptor binding or after endocytosis. requirement for fusion between the mutant and the wild type virus was attributed to three point mutations in the heptad repeat regions. recombinant strain containing the MHV-2 spike protein relies on low pH for entry. if a cleavage site is introduced in MHV-2 spike protein, virus entry no longer requires these proteases. fusion occurs at acidic pH, with a half-maximal fusion rate occurring at pH 5.5. in order to infect cells, IBV enters by endocytosis. inhibitory drugs such as chlorpromazine also abolished IBV infection. cleavage of the fusion protein is a common characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins. the nature of the cleavage site of HA is of great importance in virus pathogenicity. the nature of the cleavage site of HA is of great importance in virus pathogenicity. coronaviruses have a spike that is cleaved by furin. it is important to note that this protease belongs to a family of enzymes called proprotein convertases (PCs), which has nine members. it remains to be determined whether other PCs related to furin can also recognize and cleave coronavirus spike proteins. trypsin activates fusion by sequential cleavage of spike protein at two discrete sites. second cleavage occurs directly at the N-terminal extremity of the fusion peptide. fusion is modulated by spatial regulation of cleavage site. the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is a key factor of tropism. it is believed that this route of entry is 100- to 1000-fold more efficient than the endosomal pathway. the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is a key factor of tropism. expression of HAT in target cells does not confer NH4Cl or cathepsin inhibitor resistance to SARS-CoV virion entry. TMPRSS2 likely plays a key role in the initial infection and spread of the virus. a well-studied case for the role of proteolytic activation of spike comes from research on the type 2 FCoV pair FECV 79\u20131683 and FIPV 79\u20131146 [86]. a biochemical assay found that FECV 79\u20131683 can be cleaved by cathepsin B and L, while FIPV 79\u20131146 could only be cleaved by cathepsin B. the location of the fusion peptide has been most extensively studied for SARS-CoV. the location of the fusion peptide has been most extensively studied. the location of the fusion peptide is predicted to be in the S2 domain. mutagenesis of this predicted fusion peptide inhibited fusion in syncytia assays of S-expressing cells. a third, aromatic region adjacent to the transmembrane domain has been shown to be important in SARS-CoV fusion. a structural model of the proposed IEDLLF fusion peptide shows that it is externally positioned mid-way down the trimer. it is also homologous to an immunodominant neutralizing domain (the 5B19 epitope) on the MHV S2 subunit. the novel S2 fusion peptide is mainly helical (especially the conserved residues SxIEDLLF), with a short central unstructured region. the predicted model does not include residues 681-736 of the protein. closely related coronaviruses have been identified in distantly related animals suggesting recent interspecies jumps. mutations that a virus might acquire may be inherited."}
