{"summary": "influenza has been estimated to result in 31 million outpatient visits and an annual total economic burden of $87 billion. the elderly, children, and individuals with underlying medical conditions are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality caused by influenza virus infection. emerging influenza virus strains have the potential of sustaining efficient human-to-human transmission and causing a global pandemic. rapid tests confer the highest efficiency, with the results known within 10 to 15 min. but rapid tests exhibit inconsistent test performance, especially in the detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (15\u201318) a number of molecular assays for in-house research and diagnostic use have become available. a panel of 10 respiratory viruses was purchased from Qnostics. 328 samples were collected from two institutions for the clinical evaluation. the samples were all surplus samples left from routine respiratory testing. prospectively collected 41 mixed nasal/throat swab specimens from the clinical microbiology and public health laboratory. these samples were submitted to the Scientific Institute of Public Health (WIV-ISP) for testing during and between influenza seasons from 2010 to 2012. cDNAs of A/Brisbane/59/2007 and B/Florida/4/2006 were generated from RNA extract. the 113-bp (influenza A virus) and 131-bp (influenza B virus) amplicons were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) followed by cloning into the pCRII vector using a TA cloning kit dual promoter. the recommended amount of amplicons was transcribed in vitro with a MEGAshortscript T7 kit (influenza A the transcripts were purified using a MEGAclear kit (Ambion), and their concentrations (in ng/l) were determined by using the nanoDrop system. the number of copies per microliter for each preparation of transcript was calculated according to the following formula: RNA amount (in copy/l) the qRT-PCR mixture was prepared using a superscript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) the mixture was prepared in a volume of 25 l containing 0.8 M influenza virus A forward and reverse primers, 0.6 M influenza virus B forward and reverse primers, 0.2 M influenza virus A probe, 0.15 M influenza virus B probe, 4% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.7 l of superscript III RT/Platinum Taq mix previously reported generic quadriplex assay (25, 26) was upgraded to a pentaplex assay capable of detecting all influenza A virus subtypes, influenza B virus, the hemagglutinin A(H1)pdm09 and H3 subtypes, and bacteriophage MS2. the hemagglutinin H5 subtype primers and probe were replaced with hemagglutinin-specific primers and probe. the reporter label (Cy5) on the influenza B virus probe (BNP probe) was converted to Quasar 705. the concentrations of primers (BNP-F and BNP-R) and the Quasar 705 probe for the influenza virus B component of the assay were, however, increased to 0.2 M and 0.08 M. the pentaplex assay provided additional typing data for influenza A virus positives. the 12 A(H1N1)pdm09 samples gave a consistently lower CT value, between 1 and 1.5, with the pentaplex assay. the performance of both assays was also assessed using a number of external quality assessment panels. an in-house duplex qRT PCR was developed for the simultaneous detection of influenza A and B viruses. the qRT-PCR mixture was prepared in a reaction volume of 25 l containing 0.8 M influenza A virus forward and reverse primers (InfA For and InflB Rev), 0.2 M influenza A virus probe (InfA Probe FAM-BHQ1), 0.1 M influenza B virus probe (InflB HEX-BHQ1) and 0.5 l of super primers and probes targeting influenza virus conserved regions were designed by using Primer3. oligonucleotides were further analyzed in silico for specificity. the same primer-probe sets were adapted for RT-PCR and qRT-PCR used in production of in vitro transcripts. primer set (A-F and A-R) amplified a 106-nucleotide target region of the influenza A virus NS gene. IC primer set (IC-F and IC-R) amplified a 102-nt region of the MS2 phage genome, which showed no sequence similarity with known human pathogens.

PCR mixture was prepared in a volume of 25 l containing 0.8 M influenza virus A forward and reverse primers, 0.6 M influenza virus B forward and reverse primers, 0.2 M influenza virus A probe, 0.15 M influenza virus B probe, 4% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.7 l of SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq mix. qRT-PCR method consistently detected 10 copies of transcript standards per reaction mixture. the hemagglutinin H5 subtype primers and probe were replaced with A(H1)pdm09 hemagglutinin-specific primers and probe, H1F, 5\u2032-TCAACAGACACTGTAGACACAGTACT-3\u2032; H1p, Cy5-5\u2032-AATGTAACACACTCTGTTAACC-3\u2032-BHQ. the primer concentrations were both 0.4 M and 0.12 M, respectively. the MS2 bacteriophage internal control (IC) component was identical to that described previously (25), with the primers (MS2 F1 and MS2 R1) and ROX-labeled MS2 probe concentrations each at 0.08 M. the pentaplex assay was performed with the superscript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR enzyme (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) the 12 A(H1N1)pdm09 samples gave a consistently lower CT value, between 1 and 1.5, with the pentaplex assay. the performance of both assays was also assessed using a number of external quality assessment panels. the annual HPA Influenza Molecular Proficiency Panel 7 (for 2012) was also subjected to both assays in parallel. qRT-PCR was performed using the superscript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) on the Mx3005p QPCR system. primers and probes for influenza A virus target the matrix gene (27), and those for influenza B virus target the HA gene (28). Sequences of each gene segment were aligned with the multiple alignment using the fast Fourier transform program. oligonucleotides were further analyzed in silico for specificity. the CDC universal influenza A virus primers were modified and adapted for SAMBA as one of the tentative primer sets for evaluation. the primer set (A-F and A-R) amplified a 106-nucleotide (nt) target region of the influenza A virus NS gene. the IC primer set (IC-F and IC-R) amplified a 102-nt region of the MS2 phage genome, which showed no sequence similarity with a 250-l aliquot of the swab sample was extracted using the SAMBAprep machine. to the lysis buffer was added 1,500 PFU of phage. the dipstick signal was scored from 0 to 5. the signal strengths of the IC and influenza A/B test lines were graded from 0 to 5 according to an in-house scoring chart. a blank dipstick (no IC or influenza A/B signal) indicated an invalid test run. the presence of the IC signal is not required for a valid influenza virus-positive call. the LoD of the SAMBA flu duplex test was determined to be 95 copies/test and 85 copies/test for influenza A and B viruses, respectively. a panel of common respiratory pathogen culture supernatants was used to validate the analytical specificity. a panel of 18 influenza viruses, including 3 H1N1, 4 H3N2, 1 each of H5N3, H7N1 and H7N2 subtypes, and 8 influenza B viruses were tested to determine the detection spectrum of the SAMBA flu duplex test. the copy numbers of these cultures were quantified by using the in-house qRT-PCR assay. the dynamic range of the IC was analyzed by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of the cultured virus in pooled clinical samples. the IC signal remained visible at 4.074 and 3.647 million copies/test of influenza A and B virus, respectively, and was out-competed at higher levels of influenza virus. successful detection of both viruses was observed when two viral concentrations were within a 100-fold difference, e.g., 500 and 50,000 copies. the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA flu duplex test was conducted by testing samples from two public health laboratories. 41 prospective nasal/throat swab samples were collected during the 2011-2012 winter season from HPA Cambridge. influenza A virus 328 135 0 4 189 100 (97.2\u2013100) 97.9 (94.8\u201399.2) 97.1 (92.8\u201398.9) 100 (98\u2013100) influenza B virus 328 94 0 0 234 100 (96.1\u2013100) 100 (98.4\u2013100) 100 (98.4\u2013100) a Q, qRT-PCR result; S, SAMBA result; CI, confidence interval; positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value of 328 clinical specimens, the SAMBA showed a resolved clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for its influenza A virus test and a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100% for its influenza B virus test. the performance between the prospective study, although small in sample size, and the retrospective study was similar. first, 1,000, 500, 250, 250, 200, 150, and 75 copies of influenza A/B viruses were tested in quadruplicate. concentrations above 75 copies were tested in increments of 5 copies in 20 replicates until at least 95% of the replicates tested positive. a panel comprising 18 influenza viruses, including 3 H1N1, 4 H3N2, 1 each of H5N3, H7N1 and H7N2 were tested. all other panel members were tested at 200 copies/test (determined via the in-house qRT-PCR). two hundred copies/test of the panel member and 45 PFU/test of A/Teal/England/2006 were tested in duplicate. the dynamic range of the IC was analyzed by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of the cultured virus in pooled clinical samples from the highest possible concentration. the IC signal remained visible at 4.074 and 3.647 million copies/test of influenza A and B virus, respectively, and was out-competed at higher levels of influenza virus. the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA flu duplex test was conducted by testing samples from two public health laboratories. 41 prospective nasal/throat swab samples were collected during the 2011-2012 winter season from HPA Cambridge and were tested fresh. in the initial testing, the SAMBA Flu duplex test detected 135 influenza A-positive and 94 influenza B-positive concordant samples. four samples tested influenza A positive by SAMBA but negative by qRT-PCR, and two negative by SAMBA but influenza B positive by qRT-PCR. the 32 concordant samples gave the same results as SAMBA. four influenza A virus SAMBA-positive qRT-PCR-negative samples tested negative. two influenza B virus SAMBA-negative qRT-PCR-positive samples also tested negative. rapid and accurate diagnostic testing close to the source is important for the control of outbreaks and detection of emerging influenza viruses. recently, there have been a number of commercial molecular tests, such as the IQuum Liat Influenza A/B assay, the Simplexa Flu A/B, and RSV Direct and Cepheid Xpert Flu test, designed for use in near-patient settings (31\u201334). a significant quality concern over rapid tests for influenza virus is their failure to report whether the clinical evaluation was conducted in a blinded fashion (35). for the clinical evaluation of the SAMBA Flu duplex tests, the clinical samples were tested blind, including the testing of archived samples from WIV-ISP, Belgium. a retrospective archived swab samples were used to supplement the small number of prospectively collected samples obtained in Cambridge. a large proportion of weak positive results could adversely affect test performance. the principle of the SAMBA test takes advantage of the explosive accumulation (109-fold increase in 1 to 2 h) of single-stranded amplification product by isothermal amplification. the SAMBA flu duplex test currently takes 2 h and 15 min for the entire test procedure. other commercial tests designed for point-of-care use have much shorter turnaround times (from 20 min to just over 1 hour) this disadvantage could be addressed by reducing the detection and amplification times. the assay will bring state-of-the-art molecular testing for the influenza virus closer to patients in the near future."}
