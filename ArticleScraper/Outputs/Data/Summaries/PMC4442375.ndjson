{"summary": "TEXT Coronaviruses are a diverse family of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have frequently undergone host range expansion events. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged into the human population in 2003 and infected over 8,000 people before finally being contained by aggressive public health interventions. the importance of A288L can be understood by recognizing that there is a strong hydrophobic region in the MERS-CoV RBD that engages the equivalent hDPP4 residue (L294). arginine 330 provides a highly conserved charge that is present in all known permissive hosts but missing from all known nonpermissive hosts. sylation was crucial for regulating mDPP4 permissivity to MERS-CoV infection. mutation T330R in mDPP4 introduces a conserved positive charge for permissive hosts but knocks out a glycosylation site. a panel of hDPP4 mutants were generated to test the impact of glycosylation versus charge on the ability of mDPP4 to support infection by MERS-CoV. we swapped the three residues of the mDPP4 putative glycosylation site with residues 334 to 336 of hDPP4 (hDPP4+gly) the presence of a positively charged residue at position 336 is not essential for hDPP4-mediated MERS-CoV infection. the presence of glycosylation does not impact the ability of hDPP4+gly to be expressed on the cell surface. the positive charge is not a crucial interaction in the context of hDPP4. blot protocol followed that described by Cockrell et al. (4). mutant variants are expressed on the surfaces of cells, visible by immunofluorescence. cells were transfected as described in the legend to Fig. 2A. surface staining for mDPP4 and hDPP4 showed a 2.5-kDa downward shift in the Western blot, consistent with the loss of glycosylation. this suggests that removal of the glycosylation site is responsible for regulating the ability of MERS-CoV to utilize mDPP4 as a functional receptor. the secondary mutation, A288L, also plays an important role in MERS-CoV permissivity. values for all DPP4 constructs are significantly greater than those for no DPP4 and mDPP4 (*, P 0.05; Student's t test); however, the values for mDPP4 A288L, N328A and mDPP4 A288L, T330R are not statistically different from each other. changes in both blades of mDPP4 are crucial for mediating permissivity to MERS-CoV. circulating MERS-like coronaviruses cannot expand host range into mice and possibly other rodent species with just one change. circulating MERS-like coronaviruses cannot expand host range into mice and possibly other rodent species with just one change."}
