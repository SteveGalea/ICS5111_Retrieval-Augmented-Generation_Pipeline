{"summary": "there is an increasing call for multilevel governance in health. regional organisations are carving a place in negotiating health targets. health has become a concern for these organisations given the challenges that arise from diseases that transcend borders. literature shows that framing narratives can be instrumental in introducing an issue into political agendas potentially leading to the institutionalisation of norms. one study found that health in foreign policy can be addressed as a security issue, charity, investment or public health more generally. new frameworks explain'regionness' and social cohesion beyond traditional areas of study of regions of trade and security, to socio-political areas such as health. authors identify security, development, global public goods (GPG), trade, human rights and ethical/moral reasoning as the most common ways in which countries approach global health. documents according to the policy frames developed by Labonte and Gagnon (2010), as well as definitions developed by other authors in the field. they were the result of a thorough examination of foreign policy documents at the governmental level and not the global health governance level. this means the framework is not only based on the examination of existing foreign policy documents. development remains the invitation to global governance debates. risks inherent in its \u2018investing in health\u2019 instrumentalism can be tempered by continuously reminding decision makers to distinguish which one is the objective (human development) and which one the tool (economic growth) human rights, though weak in global enforcement, have advocacy traction. such rights do not resolve embedded tensions between the individual and the collective. policy documents are the effects of mechanisms or forces explained by the frames. it is explanatory because it shows how policy documents are the effects of mechanisms or forces explained by the frames. this method is clearly useful in the case of the study of regional organisations. key texts may reflect a lapsed reality and may not capture current discussions around health in these regional organisations. this is the case for example of the SADC, where texts have a 2-year embargo period after which they are freely available to the public. ASEAN: a region emphasising development and (increasingly) the securitisation of health ASEAN was formed in 1967 as a grouping of five countries in Southeast Asia. over the years it has expanded to include 10 countries in the region. title Year published Identified policy frame(s) Example Source Healthy ASEAN 2020 2000 Human rights \u2018health as a fundamental right of our peoples\u2019 (p. 1) the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration reiterates that 'every person has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical, mental and reproductive health, to basic and affordable health-care services and to have access to medical facilities' however, these restrictions open the doors to many possibilities to limit the rights of sick people in the name of 'national security' ASEAN considers health as an engine for social development and consequently the prerequisite for the wellbeing of every ASEAN citizen. a link between \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018social development\u2019 is especially visible in the ASCC Blueprint (2009) which places health under the heading of \u2018social welfare and protection\u2019. regional cooperation and international partnership with the ASEAN on other issues, such as addressing non-communicable diseases, is lower. regional cooperation and international partnership with the ASEAN on other issues, such as addressing non-communicable diseases, is lower. 'health is important for the wellbeing of individuals and society, but a healthy population is also a prerequisite for economic productivity and prosperity' 'health is not just a cost, it is an investment' p. 3) 'Communication on The EU Role in Global Health', European Commission (2010c) 128 final 2010 Development \u2018health is influenced by social, economic and environmental factors which are increasingly influenced by globalisation\u2019. development \u2018health does not only contribute to economic growth, it also represents a major provider of employment in the EU and globally\u2019. the EU defines HIAP as a policy strategy that targets the key social determinants of health. the view that health is an intersectoral issue that should be addressed by all sectors is related to the GPG and development frames. this thinking is embedded in the main EU policy documents and guides their investments within the region and to other non-member states. the EU\u2019s priority in terms of global health issues are poverty-related diseases seen as the major cause as well as the consequence of poverty in developing countries. the EU has funded research on poverty-related diseases through its Research Framework Programmes (FP7 and Horizon 2020) security and human rights frames emerged in our analysis. the frame was prevalent in the EU health strategy (2008\u20132013) and in the document \u2018Health as a bridge for peace\u2019. defining health as a human right is different to the public goods frame. six documents in total are identified as the most important documents addressing health in SADC. the SADC health protocol (1999) starts by reaffirming that a healthy population is a prerequisite for sustainable development. the text was adopted during a period regarded as the acme of efforts to ensure better access to affordable health care to HIV/AIDS patients. SADC Declaration on Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development 2008 Development. they resolve to step up actions to ensure access to health services including primary health care and to increase efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. the \u2018Regional indicative strategic development plan\u2019 (SADC, 2003a) also approaches health as a means to achieve greater development. it refers to the goal of primary health care for all by 2020 as espoused in the Alma-Ata Declaration (WHO, 1978) the \u2018SADC strategy for pooled procurement of essential medicines and health commodities\u2019 (2012) was adopted. it is stated that one of the priorities of the plan is to address limitations in the WTO sanctioned agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property (TRIPS) in order to have better access to safe, effective and affordable drugs and vaccines. ISAGS 3-year working plan 2012\u20132015 2011 Human Right/Public Good/Development \u2018Health as: A fundamental right of a human being and of society and a vital component for human development\u2019. quenal 2010\u20132015 2009 Human rights \u2018should be integrated in the greater concept of social protection and as such, should play an important role in harmonic social development\u2019. health is considered to be a crucial condition for economic and social development in resolution 9/2011. this is also the case in the periodic working plan of the South American Institute of Governance in Health (ISAGS) health is regarded as a means to reach equity and 'harmonious development' evidence shows that the UNASUR may justify involvement in health in different manners. but these documents still reiterate their clear stance on approaching health as a human right. this is also made explicit in their core policy documents such as the \u2018UNASUR Constitutive Treaty\u2019 (2008) and the \u2018Five Year UNASUR Health Strategic Plan\u2019 (2009b) health and foreign policy frames emerge within the ASEAN region. three main policy frames emerge within the region. a human rights, development and security approach. the human rights argument presented in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (ASEAN, 2000) was recently confirmed in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration that reiterates that 'every person has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical, mental and reproductive health' the ASEAN considers health as an engine for social development and consequently the prerequisite for the wellbeing of every ASEAN citizen. this is particularly visible in the ASCC Blueprint (2009) which places health under the heading of \u2018social welfare and protection\u2019. members of the ASEAN often express their interest in supporting these efforts despite limited intra-regional financial support. regional cooperation and international partnership with the ASEAN on other issues, such as non-communicable diseases, is lower. health was presented within the development (European Commission, 2010c; European Commission, 2007), human rights (Council of the EU, 2010a; European Commission, 2010c), security (European Commission, 2010c; European Commission, 2007) and GPG (European Commission, 2010c) frames. analysis also uncovered another frame that had not initially been described by Labonte and Gagnon (2010). p. 6) Security \u2018Pandemics, major physical and biological incidents\u2019 pose potential major threats to health. it is a core part of the Community\u2019s role in health to coordinate and respond rapidly to health threats globally. p. 4) Contributing to universal coverage of health services through development policy SEC(2010) 382 final 2010 Human rights. 'Health can be a good entry point to initiate dialogue across borders, thus contributing to building trust between parties' the EU defines HIAP as a policy strategy that targets the key social determinants of health through integrated policy responses across relevant policy areas. this frame combines the conceptualisations of health as GPG \u2013 that is, goods which are not diminished by use and available to all \u2013 and as a driver of development. however, it goes further by including how health has an effect on and is affected by all aspects of society. the EU considers investments in non-member states have the potential to open new economic opportunities and markets to the region. this is reflected in the percentage of ODA allocated to health, which represented 7.2% of the overall budget in 2010 (Action for Global Health, 2012) the EU considers medical research as a GPG. but the end-use of medical knowledge when it is embodied in a tangible good often remains excludable and not available for all. such an approach is the main rationale for the EU framework programme for health. the approach supports health workers in delivering health in conflict and post-conflict situations. the approach rests notably on the case of the South-East Europe Health network which helped build bridges across hitherto hostile communities. the human rights frame was less common. six documents in total are identified as the most important documents addressing health in the SADC (2014a) the most commonly found policy frames in the analysis centred on development, trade and human rights arguments. development was the most frequent argument for health in foreign policy. 'the HIV/AIDS pandemic is reversing the developmental gains made in the past decade and is posing the greatest threat to sustainable development of the region' the \u2018Regional indicative strategic development plan\u2019 (SADC, 2003a) also approaches health as a means to achieve greater development. the \u2018SADC strategy for pooled procurement of essential medicines and health commodities\u2019 (SADC, 2012:1) describes how greater access to medicines can support the goal of sustainable growth and poverty eradication. the access to affordable medicines debates and struggles especially in southern africa were specifically articulated in human rights terms. the \u2018SADC strategy for pooled procurement of essential medicines and health commodities\u2019 (2012) was adopted. six documents are identified as the most important in the area of health for the UNASUR. most common frames are ethical reasoning, development, human rights, public goods and security. UNASUR plan Quinquenal 2010\u20132015 2009 Human rights \u2018should be integrated in the greater concept of social protection and as such, should play an important role in harmonic social development\u2019. the argument of health as a fundamental human right is identified in the majority of the documents, primarily in the \u2018Five Year UNASUR Health Work Plan (2010\u20132015)\u2019. health as a driver of development also emerges as an important frame in several documents. health as a common point of convergence that can promote regional integration seems to an argument that is repeatedly rehearsed. the ISAGS 3-year working plan discusses access to medications but does not bring up trade issues. the limited discussion around trade may reflect the countries\u2019 limited involvement in production. health is presented as a driver for development. this can be explained by the impact the HIV/AIDS epidemic has had on development in the region. the uNASUR and the SADC view health as an important element to reduce poverty. regional organisations such as the uNASUR and the SADC do approach health from development and human rights standpoints. they are composed of a number of developing countries and therefore have a greater stake in ensuring all member states develop to build a stronger union. the EU do not have a formal status and positions are brought forward by member states representing the regional blocs. the continent was instrumental in the discussions around the preparation and adoption of the WHO Code of Practice on the international recruitment of health workers. however, the convening power of sub-regional organisations such as the SADC has been lower. the ASEAN\u2019s swift position on addressing the SARS epidemic among their member states in 2003 was recognised as an example of effective international cooperation against a common disease threat. regional organisations will likely have an impact at the moment of negotiating. findings elucidate how regional organisations formally address health as a foreign policy issue. this explains their interaction with other outside bodies such as the WHO, the UN, donors and international civil society organisations. health is also used as an entry point to juxtapose countries or regions. this is also critical when interacting with donors in the case of the SADC region."}
