BAC cDNA Clones To recover the infectious virus, vero cells on 6-well plates were grown to 90% confluence in growth medium without antibiotics. after 6 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh growth medium and the cells incubated at 37 \u00b0C. the recovered virus was cloned by three rounds of plaque purification. genomic 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-terminal sequences were determined by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the 5\u2019/3\u2019 RACE second generation kit (Roche, Basilea, Switzerland) with a polyA-tail added to the cDNA prior to the 3\u2019 RACE reaction using polyA polymerase. total RNA was purified from Vero cells infected with viruses from passage 1 (P1) to passage 5 (P5) using the RNeasy minikit cells seeded into 12-well plates at 90\u201390% of confluence were infected with the indicated viruses diluted in virus growth medium without FBS at the specified MOIs. after viral absorption, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells overlaid with 2 mL of virus growth medium containing 1% DEAE-Dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) total intracellular RNA from uninfected or infected Vero cells was purified using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) total cDNA was synthetized from 100 ng of purified RNA using random hexamer primers and the high-capacity cDNA Transcription kit. the level of viral RNA was further quantified using a custom TaqMan assay specific for ZIKV-RGN RNA. vero cells grown on coverslips in 24-well plates at 80\u201390% of confluence were infected with the rescued rZIKVs at the indicated MOIs. at selected time points post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mM Hepes pH 7.4 during 20 min at room temperature. after that, cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution (10% FBS in PBS) and incubated 96-well plates were coated with cell lysates from mock- or ZIKV-infected Vero cells and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were washed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, then incubated with two-fold dilutions of mice sera for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. after that, plates were washed with water and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mous female 4-to-6-week-old mice (n = 5) were first anesthetized i.p. with a mixture of ketamine (100 g per gram of body weight) and xylazine (20 g per gram of body weight), and then mock-infected (PBS) or infected s.c. after viral infection, animals were monitored daily for morbidity (body weight loss and disease signs, including hunching, ruffling and mice were challenged s.c. in the footpad with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN. their morbidity and mortality were monitored over 14 days. a two-tailed, unpaired Student t test was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, ThermoFisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) were propagated in vero cells with virus growth medium BAC-based plasmids were isolated and purified using the Large-Construct kit. cDNA clone was assembled in the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11. restriction sites PmlI, AfeI, and BstBI are unique in the viral genome. ZIKV 1 fragment contained the CMV promoter precisely fused to the first 3350 nucleotides of the viral genome flanked at the 5\u2019-end by ApaLI and AscI sites. fragment ZIKV 2 (flanked by PmlI and AfeI) and ZIKV 3 (flanked by AfeI and BstBI) covered the genomic regions 3346\u20135972 and 5967\u20139131, respectively. eI, BstBI and MluI to generate the full-length cDNA clone pBAC-ZIKV-RGN. the bacterial strain DH10B (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used as the E. coli host for all the cloning steps. hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (Rz) ribozyme (Rz) followed by the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation sequences. vero cells were grown to 90% confluence in growth medium without antibiotics. after 6 h of incubation, the cells incubated at 37 \u00b0C. sonication and a DNA library were generated using the NEBNext mRNA library prep master mix set for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) deep-sequencing was performed using miSeq (Illumina) and the raw sequencing reads analyzed using SWARM custom software. total RNA was purified from Vero cells infected with viruses from passage 1 (P1) to passage 5 (P5) using the RNeasy minikit (Q the amplicons generated covering the region encoding NS2A and NS2B proteins were sequenced by Sanger sequencing (Macrogen Europe, Amsterdam, Netherlands) after viral absorption, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells overlaid with 2 mL of virus growth medium containing 1% DEAE-Dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.6% Agar Noble (Difco, ThermoFisher Scientific) aliquots of tissue culture supernatants were collected and virus titers determined by plaque assay. total intracellular RNA from uninfected or infected vero cells was purified using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) total cDNA was synthetized from 100 ng of purified RNA using random hexamer primers and the high-capacity cDNA Transcription kit. 7500 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific) was analyzed with PRISM 7500 software v2.0.6. all experiments and data analysis were MIQE compliant. immunofluorescence acquired images were processed and analyzed with ImageJ 1.52b software. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed as previously described. 96-well plates were coated with cell lysates from mock- or ZIKV-infected Vero cells. female 4-to-6-week-old mice (n = 5) were first anesthetized i.p. with a mixture of ketamine (100 g per gram of body weight) and xylazine (20 g per gram of body weight) mice showed more than 20% of body weight loss or severe paralysis were considered to have reached the experimental endpoint and were humanely euthanized. mice were challenged s.c. in the footpad with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A diluted in PBS in a final volume of 50 L. at 20 days post-immunization, mouse sera were collected by submandibular bleeding and the presence of total antibodies against ZIKV-RGN was evaluated by ELISA. pBeloBAC11 was a single-copy plasmid derived from the E. coli F-factor. it was used to assemble a ZIKV infectious cDNA clone. the genome sequence was obtained from a fetus with microcephaly in 2015. length sequence of the BAC clone was determined and no changes were detected to that reported for the ZIKV-RGN strain. the BAC clone was passaged in E. coli DH10B cells for more than two hundred generations. the BAC approach is a reliable and simple method to generate ZIKV infectious clones. vero cells were mock-transfected or transfected with 4 g/well of the BAC cDNA clone (pBAC-ZIKV-RGN) at the indicated times post-transfection, virus titers were determined by plaque assay. full-genome sequencing of both viral clones revealed that both clones presented the same sequence that the cDNA clone. results demonstrate the feasibility of generating infectious rZIKVs using a BAC-based approach. mice infected with 103 or 104 PFU did not show disease symptoms. only a slight reduction in body weight was detected on days 8 to 12. animals infected with 105 PFU showed hind limb paralysis and rapidly lost weight. female 4-to-6-week-old mice (six mice per group) were infected with the indicated PFU of rZIKV-RGN. the differences between viral doses of 103 and 104 are statistically significant when data are compared using the unpaired t test (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.01) mutation consists in a cytosine-to-thymidine substitution at genomic position 4069, resulting in an alanine-to-valine change in the residue 175 of the NS2A protein (A175V) pBAC-ZIKV-RGN-mNS2A was generated by replacing the ZIKV 2 WT fragment for that containing the NS2A A175V mutation. this infectious clone was fully stable in bacteria and amino acid A175 is highly conserved, since the 100% of the analyzed ZIKV sequences contained an alanine residue at this position. pBAC-ZIKV-RGN or pBAC-ZIKV-RGN-mNS2A were transiently transfected with 4 g/well of the infectious clones pBAC-ZIKV-RGN or pBAC-ZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. vero cells were infected (MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell) with rZIKV-RGN or rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. at the indicated hpi, viral RNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. a reduction of about one logarithmic unit in virus production was detected in Vero cells infected with the mutant virus both at high and low MOI. a 5-fold reduction in the levels of viral RNA was observed in cells infected with the mutant virus. NS2A A175V mutation at least impairs viral RNA synthesis in vero cells. rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A in mice was compared with parental rZIKV-RGN. mice infected with mutant rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A presented lower viremia than mice infected with the parental virus. mutant virus was only detected at day two after infection and at lower titers (approximately 1.5 logarithms lower) than the parental virus. female 4-to-6-week-old mice (six mice per group) were infected with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN or rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. viral titers in sera were determined at days two and four after infection (three animals per time point) five female 4-to-6-week-old mice were vaccinated s.c. in the footpad with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A or mock-vaccinated with PBS. twenty days after vaccination, blood samples were collected to evaluate the humoral response. one day later, mice were challenged with a lethal dose (105 PFU) of rZIKV-RGN. mice were challenged with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. the body weight loss and survival were monitored daily during 14 days. mice that lost more than 20% of their initial body weight were humanely euthanized. rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A was attenuated in vivo and induces protection against ZIKV-RGN in mice. both mutant (rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A) and parental (rZIKV-RGN) viruses were passaged five times in vero cells. the virus plaque phenotype, growth kinetics and the sequence of NS2A were analyzed for each passage. the differences between rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A and the experimental samples, rZIKV-RGN P1, rZIKV-RGN P5 and rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A P5, are statistically significant when data are compared using the unpaired t test (***, P 0.001). in vero cells limits the use of this mutant for vaccine development, these data further support the importance of this NS2A residue for virus replication. the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 (a single-copy plasmid derived from the E. coli F-factor) was used to assemble a ZIKV infectious cDNA clone based on the genome sequence of the RGN strain of ZIKV. HDV ribozyme followed by the BGH termination and polyadenylation sequences to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 3\u2019-ends of the viral genome. the full-length sequence of the ZIKV-RGN BAC clone was determined and no changes were detected to that reported for the ZIKV-RGN strain. avivirus E protein mAb 4G2 induced a clear CPE. high levels of E protein expression were detected in perinuclear region of infected cells. rZIKV-RGN infectious BAC clone produces high titers of rZIKV-RGN directly after transfection of susceptible Vero cells. rZIKV-RGN replicated efficiently in both vero and A549 cells. the rescued virus generated homogeneous plaques of about 2 mm in size. both clones presented the same sequence that the cDNA clone. groups of five female 4-to-6-week-old mice were inoculated s.c. in the footpad with PBS or with different doses of rZIKV-RGN. the morbidity (body weight loss and disease signs) and survival were monitored daily over 14 days. as expected, weight loss and survival correlated with the inoculated dose. female 4-to-6-week-old A129 mice (five mice per group) were mock-infected with the indicated PFU of rZIKV-RGN. body weight loss (expressed as the percentage of starting weight, left panel) and survival (right panel) were monitored daily during 14 days. pBAC-ZIKV-RGN infectious clone detected a point mutation in the NS2A protein. this mutation consists in a cytosine-to-thymidine substitution at genomic position 4069, resulting in an alanine-to-valine change in the residue 175 of the NS2A protein (A175V) no additional mutations were observed after sequencing the full-length clone. an in silico analysis was performed to evaluate the frequency of amino acid residues 175 of the NS2A protein in more than 700 ZIKV strains sequences deposited in the database. rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A is highly conserved, since the 100% of the analyzed ZIKV sequences contained an alanine residue at this position. rZIKV-RGN or rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A at high or low MOI, and at the indicated hpi virus titers were determined by plaque assay. a reduction of about one logarithmic unit in virus production was detected in vero cells infected with the mutant virus both at high and low MOI. flavivirus NS2A protein is involved in regulation of RNA replication and virus assembly. production of viral RNA in vero cells was analyzed at 24 and 36 hpi by RT-qPCR. at both times, a 5-fold reduction in the levels of viral RNA was observed in vero cells infected with the mutant virus. week-old mice were inoculated in the footpad with 105 PFU of either rZIKV-RGN or rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. the body weight loss and survival were monitored daily over 14 days. mice infected with mutant rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A did not present any clinical signs of infection or weight loss. female 4-to-6-week-old mice (six mice per group) were mock-infected with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN or rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. body weight loss (expressed as percentage of starting weight, left panel) and survival (right panel) were monitored daily during 14 days. a single immunization dose with rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A is enough to induce full protection against ZIKV-RGN. a strong humoral response against rZIKV-RGN was observed in mice vaccinated with rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. female 4-to-6-week-old A129 mice were mock-vaccinated (PBS) or vaccinated with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A. at 21 days after challenge, mice were challenged with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN. at 21 days after challenge, mice were challenged with 105 PFU of rZIKV-RGN. gene stability of rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A was analyzed in vero cells. rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A was attenuated in vivo and induces protection against ZIKV-RGN in mice. the plaques were visualized by immunostaining using the pan-flavivirus E protein mAb 4G2. rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A P1, rZIKV-RGN P5 and rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A P5 were infected. a reversion of the mutant virus from P1 and P5 was observed. the NS2A coding region of mutant viruses from P1 to P5 was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. the instability and reversion of the mutant virus to the WT sequence during its propagation in Vero cells limits the use of this mutant for vaccine development. this data further support the importance of this NS2A residue for virus replication. mutational silencing of cBPs present in the viral genome [37], in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments [27,28,34], the ISA method [35,36], and the CPER approach [38]. some of these approaches are laborious, time consuming and present several disadvantages. some of them need in vitro ligation and transcription steps that complicate the assembly and reduce the recovery efficiency. rZIKV-RGN infectious clone was rescued after transfection of vero cells. the virus was asymptomatic and nonlethal in female 8-to-12-week-old mice. the age of the mice (8-to-12-week-old versus 4-to-6-week-old) or the MOI used to infect the mice (103\u2013106 CCID50 versus 105 PFU) remains to be evaluated. BAC cDNA clones present a higher efficiency of transfection than RNA transcripts in mammalian cells. this allows higher efficiencies of virus recovery, reducing the passages in cell culture to get a viral stock. the BAC approach has been successfully used to engineer infectious clones of other flaviviruses, including deNV [39], and several coronaviruses. flavivirus NS2A protein is a 22-kDa hydrophobic protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum that contains eight transmembrane domains. it is a multifunctional protein that has been involved in viral RNA synthesis [61,62], virus assembly [63,64], membrane rearrangement [64], and immunomodulation of innate immune response [65,66,67]. the mutant rZIKV-RGN-mNS2A was instable and reverted to the WT sequence during its propagation in Vero cells. however, this instability and the high conservation of the amino acid A175 of the NS2A protein highlights the importance of this NS2A residue for virus replication. NS2A protein is a good target for antiviral development against ZIKV infection."}
