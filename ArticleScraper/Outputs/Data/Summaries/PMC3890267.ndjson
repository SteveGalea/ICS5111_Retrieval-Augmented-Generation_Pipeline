{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases are perceived as a significant threat to human health. several species were recognized as potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses. research on bats has led to the discovery of novel bat virus sequences. the airway epithelium is a pure \u201cphysical\u201d barrier consisting of a tightly packed layer of cells covered with mucus. recent studies also show that airway epithelial cells provide a complex contribution to host defense, innate immunity, and immune regulation. so far, only one cell line from the respiratory tract of a bat is widely available. Eidolon helvum, a member of the Pteropodidae, is found in very large colonies across a wide area in both East- and West Africa. the population trend of E. helvum is suspected to be decreasing due to intensive hunting for meat (IUCN: near threatened) but the sometimes very large colonies and adaptability to urban habitats pose potential risks for zoonotic transmission. trachea specimens were placed in ice-cold medium for transport or, if longer transport was necessary, frozen at 80\u00b0C in cell culture freezing medium (PAA, Pasching, Austria) trachea and large bronchi were roughly cleaned from attached surrounding tissue, and then longitudinally chopped into pieces with a sterile blade. cells were characterized for expression of epithelial marker proteins cytokeratin and zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) by immunofluorescence staining. cells were subcloned by end-point-limiting dilution and those populations that were initially derived from a single cell. modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was cultured with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. cell lines were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. PCR was performed using the SuperScript\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR System. antibodies were cyanine 3-labeled donkey-anti-mouse serum and cyanine 2-labeled donkey-anti-rabbit serum (Dianova) nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. all photographs were taken with a 207 Motic Axiovision microscope (Zeiss) antibodies with reactivity to a broad variety of species were chosen. amplicons ranging in size from 150 bp to 700 bp were cut from the gel and purified using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Fragment ends were repaired, 454 sequencing adaptors were ligated, and emulsion PCR was performed according to standard 454 sequencing protocols. bats were caught with mist nets, anaesthetized with a Ketamine/Xylazine mixture and euthanized by cervical dislocation. additional export permission was obtained from the Veterinary Services of the Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture. the trachea and large bronchi were roughly cleaned from the attached surrounding tissue. the medium consisted of primary airway epithelial cell medium basal mix supplemented with bovine pituitary extract 0.004 ml/ml. the primary cell medium was supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. cells were characterized for expression of epithelial marker proteins cytokeratin and zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) by immunofluorescence staining. cells were subcloned by end-point-limiting dilution and those cells that were initially derived from a single cell were selected. the cell line Tb 1 Lu was cultured under the same conditions. immunofluorescence assay (IFA) Cells were seeded on glass slides and washed with PBS on the following day, then fixed with acetone-methanol. slides were incubated with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies against pan-cytokeratin (mouse-monoclonal, Abcam, C-11, ab7753) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against zonula occludens protein (ZO-1 Mid) diluted 1400 in P the cells were derived from feral animals or from breeding populations without special pathogen free (SPF) housing conditions. the cells were investigated for putative contaminants which might be cultured along with the cells. cell lines were screened for lyssaviruses and lyssaviruses. the medium was removed and cells were infected with virus diluted in Optipro serum-free medium for 1 h. samples were taken at time points 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours post infection (hpi) for VSV and 0, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi for RVFV. 100,000\u20131,000,000 Population trend stable decreasing Status Least concerned Near threatened Figure 1.

Viruses associated with bat species C. perspicillata and E. helvum. aviridae Orthopolyomavirus Bat polyomavirus [43] Coronaviridae Coronavirus Bat Coronavirus [44]\u2013[46] Straw-colored fruit bat (E. helvum) simplexvirus 1 [48] unassigned several, unassigned [49] Reoviridae Orbivirus Ife virus [38], [50] Rotavirus Bat/KE4852/07 [51] Filoviridae Ebolavirus establishment of primary cells from outgrowths Growth of primary cells from the tissue was observed between 3\u20135 days after tissue fragments were placed in the dish. outgrowing cells displayed a homogeneous, cobblestone-like morphology typical of epithelial cells. tracheal rings were carefully removed once the dish was fully coated with cells. this procedure could be repeated five to six times. epithelial characterization Primary cells of both species were successfully immortalized by lentiviral transduction of the large T antigen of SV40. one to two weeks later, surviving cells started to proliferate rapidly. cells were expanded and characterized for epithelial cell markers by IFA. amplification was performed using degenerate primers targeting conserved regions of major virus families or genera. cells were infected with two different MOIs, 0.1 or 0.001, and viral copies in the supernatant were detected. Upon infection, cells of both species showed cytopathic effects. tracheal rings were carefully removed once the dish was fully coated with cells. this procedure could be repeated five to six times. however, a decrease in the number of outgrowing cells and loss of active ciliated cells within the tracheal ring over time was observed. cytokeratin (CK, red) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, green), nuclei counterstained with DAPI (blue) expression of both markers is present in all cell lines generated by the described methods, indicating an epithelial origin. both cell lines showed high replication of VSV with maximum copy numbers in the range of 109 viral copies per ml and lower maximum copy numbers for RVFV. Virus infection studies with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (A, B) and Rift Valley fever virus (C, D) were detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. cell lines are needed that allow the study of virus-host interaction in a wide range of host species. cell lines are needed that allow the study of virus-host interaction in a wide range of host species. many species may differ in many aspects, including geographic distribution, ecology, and biology. Crameri et al. established primary and immortalized cell lines from Pteropus alecto. serum-free medium was the least successful approach in their culture compared to conventional medium formulations. however, they do not comment on the cell type (i.e. epithelial vs. fibroblast) there is a general pitfall in all cell cultures, especially if further modifications such as immortalization or subcloning are performed. some findings supported the approach of isolation of bat-borne viruses in cell lines developed from the natural host species. MERS-coronavirus allows infection of bat cell lines originating from the presumed reservoir host. only a small number of cells were obtained in total from a single animal. this problem could be overcome by culturing organ specimens from multiple animals. but for almost all relevant wild zoonotic species it is not possible to harvest material of the required quality. video S1 Movement of ciliae in primary cell culture (here: E. helvum) Click here for additional data file."}
