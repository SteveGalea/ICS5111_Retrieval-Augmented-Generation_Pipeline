{"summary": "influenza A (subtypes seasonal A(H1N1), A(H3N2), pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza were obtained from 2004 to 2013. studies have failed to find an association between influenza vaccination and non-influenza infections. the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was characterized with an offseason surge of infected cases in temperate regions, with an age distribution shift towards children and young adults. the pandemic coincided with the summer epidemic of seasonal influenza. influenza (type A or B), adenovirus and parainfluenza were subtyped into seasonal A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) by viral culture. non-subtyped influenza A positive specimens were allocated into three subtypes by annual ratio of total numbers of each subtype. weekly age-specific positive proportions were calculated as weekly age-specific numbers of positive specimens divided by weekly total numbers of specimens tested for each age group. wavelet analysis has been adopted to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity across different states of the united states. this approach was adopted to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity across different states of the united states [9] and the synchrony of different surveillance data in Hong Kong [10]. a total of 120 571 specimens were collected during the entire study period of January 2004 to December 2013. we examined the age profile of 9 952, 1 509, 5 012, 1 467 and 3 391 cases with laboratory-confirmed infections of influenza A, influenza B, RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza. after the pandemic, the positive rate of A(H1N1)pdm09 became low among school children and adults but low in the elderly 1.5 20 43.4 0.5 6 13.0 0.1 0.001 0.001 0.001 5-17y 239 33.6 3.7 3 2.1 0.1 1 0.2 0.0 0.001 0.398 0.001 18-64y 170 3.8 2.1 33 3.7 0.5 8 0.9 0.1 0.001 0.001 0.001 65y+ 110 12.1 0.7 31 17.1 0.3 1 0.2 0.0 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001 A(H3N2) 1.4 0.001 0.001 0.511 65y+ 130 14.3 0.9 15 8.3 0.2 165 30.3 0.8 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.425 RSV 0-4y 1827 792.0 10.1 469 1016.6 11.5 795 1723.2 9.4 0.009 0.001 0.066 5-17y 90 12.7 1.4 22 15.5 1.0 52 12.2 1.7 0.177 0.048 0.340 18-64y 148 3.3 1.8 75 influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza B, RSV, adenovirus and parainfluenza are shown in Fig 1. influenza B had a single broad annual peak in most years but remained at low level in 2004, 2009, 2011 and 2013. influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus or parainfluenza by age group, Hong Kong, 2004\u20132010. annual cycle was dominant throughout the study period for A(H3N2) and B, but semiannual cycle became dominant for A(H1N1) in early 2009 before the pandemic outbreak. red and blue dots represent MWE in warm season (week 19 to week 50) and cool season (week 51 to week 18 of next year) of the pre-pandemic period. over 95% of the pandemic cases occurred in people younger than 65 years. viral interference between the novel 2009 pandemic virus and other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus and adenovirus, has also been reported in previous studies [20\u201322]. we also found high positive proportions of A(H3N2) in the post-pandemic periods for all age groups (except the 18\u201364y group), low proportions of influenza B in children, and low proportions of RSV in adults and old people. a survey showed that only 18% of the population were vaccinated in the 2012/13 season. the overall vaccination rate remained extremely low in Hong Kong after the pandemic. sensitivity and specificity of laboratory tests may vary across age. the age distribution, seasonal pattern and peak time of six respiratory viruses have changed since the pandemic. the magnitude of most changes is not significant and the patterns appear inconsistent. similar studies in other regions when age specific virology data become available in a wide range."}
