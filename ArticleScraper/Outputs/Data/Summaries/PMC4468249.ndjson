{"summary": "real-time reverse transcription polymerase amplification assays (RT-PCR) are the standard method for molecular detection of the dengue virus (DENV) over 2.5 billion people are exposed to the risk of contracting DF. DENV consists of four serotypes (DENV1-4) each comprising multiple genotypes and belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae [2] before 1970 DENV outbreaks were reported in nine countries. before 1970 DENV outbreaks were reported in nine countries but has since expanded to more than 100 countries. RT-PCR is highly sensitive and specific [14, 16\u201318]. it requires precautions, sophisticated equipment, and is cold chain dependent. there is only one development for the application of nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [19] but several applications of reverse transcription Loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for the detection and differentiation of DENV serotypes have been described [20\u201323] Viruses Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany provided the viruses and/or nucleic acids used in this study. PCR primers used for the amplification of the target region for ligation into the TA cloning vector pCRII were prepared. the RNA standards were tested by using a published real-time RT-PCR [28]. the light cycler 2.0 and the LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes kit were used. the following temperature profile was used: initial activation at 95\u00b0C/30 seconds, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C/15 seconds and 60\u00b0C/60 seconds. DENV1-3-STD-UP/DP are for DENV1-3 RT-PCR; DENV4-STD-UP/DP are for DENV4 RT-PCR; DENV-PCR-FP/RP/P, real-time RT-PCR primers and Taqman probe. the RT-RPA assay was carried out using the ready-to-use TwistAmp RT exo kit (TwistDx, Cambridge, UK) and the reverse transcriptase (RT) Transcriptor (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was added as described [29, 30]. dilution range from 107 to 101 RNA molecules/l of the molecular standards in eight replicates was used to determine the analytical sensitivity of RT-RPA assays differentiation between specific and non-specific signals of the RT-RPA assay. A and C are real-time fluorescence intensity; B and D are the 1st derivative analysis. black line shows specific amplification where blue line shows no amplification. both master mix and sample mix areas contain vortex, minicentrifuge, automatic 1\u201310 and 10\u2013100 l micopipettes, micropipette tips, scissor, and 0.2 ml tubes rack. detection was done using the tubescanner (Twista device, TwistDx, Cambridge, UK) RNA was retested simultaneously with real-time RT-PCR and the RT-RPA assays. data were analyzed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR software provided by Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system. human samples tested in Thailand were provided by the WHO collaborating center for Abovirus and Viral Hemorrhagic Fever at the Institute Pasteur de Dakar. the IPD has the required ethical approvals from the Senegalese National Health Research Council and the signed consent forms from patients. DENV4 RT-RPA identified DENV2 and DENV4. RNA molecular standards cover 242 and 248 bp of the 3\u2019 non-translated region (3\u2019NTR) RNA standards were tested by using a published real-time RT-PCR.

San Diego, CA, USA) and dried RT-RPA oligonucleotides (TIB MOLBIOL, Syntheselabor, Berlin, Germany). l 40x stock solution thus allowed pipette eight 9-volume master mixes to fill eight 8-tube strips for the tubescanner device. all reagents used for the mobile laboratory were cold-chain independent, i.e. used stored, and transported at ambient temperature. data were analyzed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR software provided by Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Life technologies, USA) the primers and probe targeted the NS5 gene (S1 Table, [14]. sensitivity was 95% of 241 and 14 RNA molecules detected for the DENV1-3 and the DENV4 RT-RPA assays. inactivated whole DENV1-4 (strains are listed in Table 1) were spiked into plasma samples. limits of detection in RT-RPA were 237, 618, 363, and 383 RNA molecules detected/reaction of DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. in DENV1-3 RT-RPA assay, 107\u2013103 RNA molecules were detected 8 out of 8 runs, 102 in 1 out of 8 and 10 copies was not identified. the value for 10 RNA copies was consistently 5.3 minutes in all 6 cases. extraction and RT-RPA assays were carried out at an ambient temperature of 38\u00b0C. 30 out of 31 DENV-3-positive samples were positive in RT-PCR. RT-RPA is much faster than the real-time RT-PCR even with samples with high Ct value. RT-RPA assays sensitivities for DENV serotypes were 66.6% (16/24), 44% (4/9), 80.9% (34/42) and 60% (6/10) for DENV1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. no correlation was found between threshold time values of RT-RPA and Ct of the real-time RT-PCR. sensitivity was 95% of 241 and 14 RNA molecules detected for the DENV1-3 and the DENV4 RT-RPA assays. inactivated whole DENV1-4 (strains are listed in Table 1) were spiked into plasma samples. Limits of detection in RT-RPA were 237, 618, 363, and 383 RNA molecules detected/reaction of DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. in DENV1-3 RT-RPA assay, 107\u2013103 RNA molecules were detected 8 out of 8 runs and 10 copies in 6/ out of 8. in Fig 4B, the value for 10 RNA copies was consistently 5.3 minutes in all 6 cases. extraction and RT-RPA assays were carried out at an ambient temperature of 38\u00b0C. the RT-RPA assays were used successfully to detect DENV RNA in the spiked plasma. 30 out of 31 DENV-3-positive samples were positive in RT-PCR assays. RT-RPA assay sensitivities for DENV serotypes were 66.6% (16/24), 44% (4/9), 80.9% (34/42) and 60% (6/10) for DENV1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. no correlation was found between threshold time values of RT-RPA and Ct of the real-time RT-PCR. several isothermal amplification technologies were developed in the last two decades. they differ in the amplification temperature, run time, number of primers used for DNA amplification, detection method (probe-based or intercalating dye dependent) and commercial availability. the tolerance for mismatches in LAMP assays may help overcome challenges for highly variant viruses. DEN RPA P3 is shared by both assays but carries 4 mismatches in the smaller 13 nt 3\u2019 section of the probe. DEN RPA P3 is shared by both assays but carries 4 mismatches in the smaller 13 nt 3\u2019 section of the probe. t 5\u2019 section of DEN RPA P3, which matches almost perfectly to DENV1-4, allows for tolerance of the accumulation of the mismatches in the smaller section of the probes. real-time RT-PCR can be used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of RNA in a sample. RT-RPA can currently only be used for qualitative detection of RNA. the RT-RPA assays were evaluated with plasma samples and RNA extracts in Senegal and Thailand. the RT-RPA clinical sensitivities were 98% for samples tested in Senegal. real-time RT-PCR sensitivity was 98% and 94.4% respectively. two DENV RT-RPA assays were developed for rapid identification of DENV1-4. three RPA exo probes (P), 19 forward primers (FP) and 5 reverse primers (RP) were tested to select combinations yielding the highest analytical DENV1-3 RT-RPA sensitivity. dilution range of 107\u2013101 RNA molecules/l of the DENV1-3 molecular standard. 107 represented by black line; 106, gray; 105, red; 104, blue; 103, green; 101, dark khaki; negative control, orange. dilution range of 107\u2013101 RNA molecules/l of the deNV1-3 molecular standard.
