{"summary": "the clinical course of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated with Bowenoid papulosis and condyloma acuminatum of anogenital tumors is still unknown. we evaluated molecules relevant to cellular proliferation and regulation of apoptosis in HPV associated anogenital tumors. c-Myc mRNA expression, telomerase activity levels and p-Akt/p-S6 expressions may provide clinically relevant molecular markers in HPV associated anogenital tumors. c-Myc, SP1, estrogen receptor, E2F-1, WT-1, NFB and MZF-2 are involved in regulation of hTERT gene expression. BP is a rare skin neoplasia, which is found in the anogenital area as multifocal papular lesions. in contrast, CA occasionally occurs as pigmented nodules or papules in the anogenital area, resulting sometimes in its misdiagnosis as BP. phosphorylated (p-) proteins associated with cell signaling pathways provide proliferative signals, promote survival and regulate protein synthesis. c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP were reported to act as tumor markers. there is a large body of data demonstrating elevated expression of IAP proteins in many human cancers. there are no reports about the expression of genes of HPV associated tumor cells. 74 samples (36 CA, 20 BP, and 18 normal skin) obtained from 74 patients were examined in the current study. biopsy or surgical specimens were collected at the Department of Dermatology, Nippon Medical School, Japan. nonradioisotope telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay Telomerase activity (TA) was assayed by the TRAP method in a total volume of 25 l. aliquots of untreated cell extract were incubated with 0.1 g of TS oligonucleotide primer (5'-AATCCGTCGAGCAGTT-3') internal telomerase assay standard (ITAS) was used as an internal control [25]. the signal intensity of each band on the TRAP ladders was measured individually. the relative specific TA of each sample is expressed as a percentage of the specific activity of the control extracts. specific probes and primers were used for real time RT-PCR Gene Application Sequence Length (bp) 5' 3' Tm (\u00b0) sequences of specific probes and primers were shown in Table 1. p-Akt thr308, p-S6 and p-4EBP1 were analysed. immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections from tumours. stained sections were independently examined by two of the authors. Western blot Western blot analysis and reverselysate protein rays were performed in anogenital tumors samples. the percentage of positive cells was arbitrarily scored as follows: 0, 30%; 1, 30% to 60%; 2, >60%. patients and tissues samples A total of 74 samples (36 CA, 20 BP, and 18 normal skin (NS)) obtained from 74 Japanese patients were examined in the current study. a two-sided test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. the suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was removed and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. aliquots of untreated cell extract were incubated with 0.1 g of TS oligonucleotide primer (5'-AATCCGTCGAGCAGTT-3') one-fourth of each reaction product was then analyzed by electrophoresis in 1 Tris-glycine on 12.5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels. internal telomerase assay standard (ITAS) was used as an internal control [25] Quantification of enzyme activity was determined using NIH imaging software. the prepared RNAs were subjected to real time PCR using an Mx3005P thermocycler (Strategene, San Diego, CA) and a QuantiTect Multiplex RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) the specific probes and primers were used to construct standard curves. immunohistochemistry was performed on the tissue sections from tumours with high or low TA mounted on aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated slides. the labelling index of p-Akt thr308, p-S6 and p-4E binding protein 1(4EBP1) was examined. -4EBP1 was determined by assessing the number of stained cells within the relevant area of a selected section containing more than 50 intraepidermal cells. at least 4 random microscopic fields at 200 magnification were evaluated. the average percentage of positive cells was arbitrarily scored as follows. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS software package. a two-sided test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance for all analyses. s, high TA levels corresponding to greater than 40% of relative TA were detected in 25% (3 out of 12) BP samples, but none of the 22 CA samples. the analysis of relative telomerase activity (TA) among Bowenoid papulosis, condyloma acuminatum, and normal skin by a nonisotopic TRAP assy. mRNA levels in BP samples were significantly up-regulated compared to NS. c-IAP1, p 0.001; c-IAP2, p = 0.002; XIAP, p = 0.034. each BP sample was carefully examined in triplicate. dyloma acuminatum, p 0.001, normal skin; p = 0.002 C; condyloma acuminatum; p = 0.022, normal skin; p = 0.034 D; condyloma acuminatum; p = 0.022, normal skin; p = 0.031, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided) no significant difference in expression of the IAP family members or c c-Myc, c-Myc, p 0.001; and vs. CA (n = 15); c-Myc, p 0.001. mRNA expression level of c-Myc was elevated in BP compared to NS samples. p-Akt 308, P-S6 and P-4EBP-1 expression p-Akt expression was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the intraepidermal cells. there are differences in p-Akt thr308 and p-S6 expression, but not p-4EBP1 expression, between anogenital tumors with and without TA. cases b and c showed more than 30% expression of p-4EBP1 was detected, with double bands at 15 and 20 kDa in Cases b and c. there were no significant histopathologic differences in 20 BP. moderate to considerable acanthosis contained many vacuolated cells of the stratum malpihii. the anogenital tumors had equivalent numbers of keratinocytes. Bowenoid papulosis samples had a significantly higher relative levels of TA than those with condyloma acuminatum and normal skin samples. low risk type HPV 6 was detected in all of the CA samples. high risk types HPV 16 and HPV 31 were detected in 9 BP samples and 1 BP sample, respectively. c-IAP1, p 0.001; c-IAP2, p 0.001; XIAP, p 0.001; and vs. CA (n = 15); c-IAP1, p 0.001; c-IAP2, p 0.001; XIAP, p 0.001; and vs. CA (n = 15); c-IAP1, p 0.001; c-IAP2, p more than 27.3% of CA samples showed positive TA, c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP expression levels were not significantly up-regulated when compared to the high expression levels observed in BP. expression levels of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP in CA were similar to the levels seen in NS. this expression was a rare event in other CA samples. mRNA expression level of c-Myc was elevated in BP compared to NS samples. c-Myc expression in CA was similar to that of NS (p = 1.000) p-Akt 308, P-S6 and P-4EBP-1 expression p-Akt expression was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the intraepidermal cells. p-4EBP1 expression was predominantly observed in the nucleus of intraepidermal cells. cases b and c showed more than 30% expressions of p-Akt thr308 and p-S6. the expression score indicates 0, >30%; 1, 30% to 60%; 2, >60%. the expression score indicates 0, >30%; 1, 30% to 60%; 2, >60%. negative TA was detected in 41.7% (5 of 12) BP samples and 22.7% (5 of 22) CA samples. no evidence of increased TA in normal skin from non-sun-exposed areas. IAPs family (XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2) can suppress apoptosis induced by a variety of apoptotic triggers. c-IAP2 is related to the hTERT protein and promotes hTERT expression. phophatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, growth, survival and metabolism. Akt promotes protein synthesis and cell growth by alleviating TSC1/2 suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), allowing the latter to act as part of the mTOR-raptor complex. a minority of BP samples with high risk HPV types showed increased c-Myc and IAPs family mRNA expression. CA samples with low risk HPV types showed little increase in those genes. majority of BP lesions in this study showed low levels of TA and mRNA expression of IAPs family and c-Myc. analyzed clinical and pathological data, including patients' follow up.
