{"summary": "the fifth porcine coronavirus was identified in 2012 in an investigation to discover new deltacoronaviruses in mammals and birds from china. in february 2014, the presence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first announced in Ohio, United States, and since then, this novel coronavirus has been reported in 17 U.S. states. complete genome of KNU14-04 has nucleotide identities of 98.8 to 99.0% and 99.6 to 99.8% to 2 Chinese strains. a 3-nt insertion was observed in each of the S genes and the 3\u2032 UTR of strain KNU14-04. this is the first time that the complete genome sequence of PDCoV from south Korea has been determined. our sequence data will provide further insight into the understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of PDCoV in south Korea."}
