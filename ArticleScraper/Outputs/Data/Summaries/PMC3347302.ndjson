{"summary": "the complete genome sequences of a virulent and attenuated PEDV strain pair have not been reported. the genome of virulent DR13 is 28,029 nucleotides (nt) long after exclusion of the poly(A) tail. that of attenuated DR13 contains 27,931 nt shorter than those of other sequenced virulent PEDVs (1, 4) the PEDV genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1ab) encoding two large nonstructural precursor polyproteins. the precursor polyproteins are proteolytically 15 replicase proteins (5). attenuated DR13 has 4,149-, 276-, and 210-nt ORFs in its S, ORF3 and E genes. this is the first report of the complete genome sequences of a virulent PEDV strain. the complete genome sequences of the virulent and attenuated DR13 strains described here have been deposited in GenBank under accession no. JQ023161 and JQ023162."}
