RNA biology is tightly orchestrated by interplay of RNAs with RB-Binding Proteins. RNAs are tightly orchestrated by interplay of RNAs with RB-Binding Proteins. KSRP induces protein unfolding and impairs the ability of KSRP to promote the degradation of its RNA targets. RNA binding is also controlled by pH conditions. TIA-1 shuttles between two cellular compartments (nucleus and cytoplasm) with slightly different pH values. RNA-binding proteinopathies, characterized by the nucleation of irreversible SGs, are often found in neurodegenerative diseases. insights into RNA biology suggest highly-regulated RBPs determine mRNA fate from synthesis to decay. RNA biology is tightly orchestrated by the interplay of RNAs with RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs), which can be regulated by post-translational modifications, pH-dependence and oligomerization states. RNA binding by TIA-1 is modulated by slight environmental pH changes due to the protonation/deprotonation of TIA-1 histidine residues. disassembly of cytoplasmic Stress Granules (SG) arise as a protective mechanism by preventing mRNA decay under stress situations. we propose that scaffolding SGs may be driven by RBDs, since PRD-lacking RBPs, like HuR, often form oligomers [6,7,8]. et al.

RNA-seq analysis indicated that none of these proteins had altered expression levels, suggesting that the binding interactions are not due to changes in background abundance. work is ongoing to probe the more subtle changes in conformation and the importance of these interactors to mediating mechanisms of dysfunction. more prevalently co-precipitated with pathogenic huntingtin included Fused in sarcoma (Fus), glycine-tRNA ligase (Gars), peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (Pebp1/Rkip) and histone subunit Hist1H4a. none of these proteins had altered expression levels, suggesting that the binding interactions are not due to changes in background tyrosinemia is an autosomal recesive disorder caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. mutations lead to loss of kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the enzyme. this knowledge should help us design new therapies based on the identification of pharmacological chaperones. biophisical and structural characterization of FAH wild type along with its mutations should help us design new therapies based on the identification of pharmacological chaperones that could restore the altered enzymatic stability of the enzyme. human FAH wild type and 19 selected mutants were synthesized and inserted in an expression vector for E. coli. the proteins were purified in a FPLC and their thermodynamic and kinetic stability investigated using circular dichroism. preliminary results confirm the loss of termodinamic stability of different mutants and its variability compared to wild type protein. ferritin consists of 24 identical subunits, which are assembled into a spherical shell-shape with 4/3/2 symmetry. the subunit includes a long BC-loop between B and C-helices and a short E-helix at the C-terminal. the acid-dissociated Ftn is able to reassemble into the native structure when pH increases. the initial velocity calculated from the forward scattering intensity increment was proportional to the square of the protein concentration. we propose the sequential bimolecular reaction, in which two dimers bind to form tetramer, then another dimer attaches to the tetramer to form a hexamer, and so on. the assembly rate decreased with increasing pH in the range from 6.0 to 8.0 and increased with increasing NaCl concentration. Escherichia coli non-heme ferritin (Ftn) consists of 24 identical subunits. they are assembled into a spherical shell-shape with 4/3/2 symmetry. the subunit includes A-D helices forming 4-helix bundle and a short E-helix at the C-terminal. the assembly rate decreased with increasing pH in the range from 6.0 to 8.0. this indicates that there are repulsive electrostatic interactions between assembly units and that they increases with increasing NaCl concentration. a possible interaction is the repulsion between net charges of dimers. Ftn consists of 24 identical subunits assembled into a spherical shell-shape. the subunit includes a 4-helix bundle, a long BC-loop between B and C-helices and a short E-helix at the C-terminal. the

were similar to that of wild-type Ftn. the acid-dissociated Ftn is able to reassemble into the native structure when pH increases. we performed the stopped-flow time-resolved SAXS experiments. the initial velocity calculated from the forward scattering intensity increment was proportional to the square of the protein concentration. to model unfolding pathways in proteins we use a computational method called GeoFold. this approach uses recursive hierarchical partitioning of protein structure and finite elements simulation. this approach uses recursive hierarchical partitioning of protein structure and finite elements simulation. the predicted unfolding rates and pathways using this improved GeoFold are compared with experimentally measured values in KineticDB for proteins with multi-state unfolding kinetics, point mutations, circular permutations, and engineered disulfides. a new partitioning operation is introduced involving the breaking of all contacts between an adjacent set of -strands, called a seam. to improve the accuracy of kinetic modeling, several updates have been made to the energy function, including an improved solvation model and a contact-order-based estimation of the reassociation rates. finite element simulations are carried out to simulate the kinetics of unfolding. this model accurately predicts changes in unfolding pathways due to disulfides

insertion in wild-type AKE facilitates folding cooperativity. a coarse-grained structure-based model of E. coli Adenylate kinase (AKE) folds cooperatively. we examine the role of the interfaces between these domains in facilitating folding cooperativity in AKE. unlike a typical multi-domain protein in which one domain is singly-linked to its adjacent domain, NMP and LID are inserted into CORE by two linkers each. mutants in which these interfaces are deleted exhibit similar folding cooperativities as wild-type AKE. we create circular permutants of AKE in which the inserted domains are converted to singly-linked domains, and find that they fold less cooperatively. domain insertion in wild-type AKE facilitates folding cooperativity even when the inserted domains have lower stabilities. insertion in wild-type AKE facilitates folding cooperativity even when the inserted domains have lower stabilities. the present study provides an understanding of the relationship between stability and folding cooperativity. it suggests that the cooperative transitions observed in unfolding reactions maybe a consequence of the changes in the stabilities of the unfolded state and the transition state. determining whether these reactions are slowed down by a continuum of small ( kBT) free energy barriers or by a few large (> 3 kBT) free energy barriers is a major challenge. in this study the free energy landscape accessible to a small protein monellin is characterized under native-like conditions using hydrogen exchange. under native conditions, the unfolded state is transiently sampled in an entirely non-cooperative and gradual manner. it suggests that the cooperative transitions observed in unfolding reactions might a consequence of the changes in the stabilities of the unfolded state and the transition state. arginine residues appear to have an unfavorable electrostatic effect on the trimer assembly and stability of HiaT. the repulsion between positively charged residues seems to be important for preventing HiaT from misassembly. the autotransporter consists of an N\u2013terminal signal peptide, an internal passenger domain and a C-terminal translocator domain. the signal peptide directs to export across the inner membrane via the Sec system and is cleaved. the translocator domain (HiaT) is embedded in the outer membrane. ssembly, amounts of reassembled trimer and monomer were quantified by SDS-PAGE. the neutralized mutation increased the rate of reassembly, but the final amount of reassembled trimer decreased. this suggests that the incorrect oligomer has a secondary structure different from the WT HiaT. locator domain (HiaT) has shown that HiaT forms a transmembrane -barrel of 12 -strands. the protein has a unique arginine residue at 1077. arginine side chains from three subunits protrude from the -strand toward the center of the barrel. 77K mutant showed assembly properties similar to those of the WT HiaT. similar proximity of positively charged residues is observed for HIV capsid protein, carboxysome shell protein, lumazine synthase. hiaT and two mutants were dissociated by formic-acid treatment. reassembled trimer and monomer were quantified by SDS-PAGE. the neutralized mutation increased the rate of reassembly, but the final amount of reassembled trimer decreased. senescence accelerated P8 mice were fed

the increase in HSPA1A expression by concentrated Kurozu was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting methods. however, concentrated Kurozu could not increase HSPA1A expression in mouse primary neurons, suggesting it may not directly affect neurons. concentrated Kurozu suppressed cognitive dysfunction and amyloid accumulation in the brain. senescence accelerated P8 mice were fed 0.25% concentrated Kurozu or 0.5% (w/w) Kurozu Moromi. concentrated Kurozu suppressed cognitive dysfunction and amyloid accumulation in the brain, while Kurozu Moromi showed a tendency to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. however, the level of lipid peroxidation in the brain did not differ in senescence accelerated mice. a comparison of structural parameters with positive enthalpy and heat capacity changes showed opposite signs to protein folding. the burial of charged residues in the fibril cores contributed to the cold denaturation of -synuclein fibrils. we propose that although cold-denaturation is common to native proteins, the main-chain dominated amyloid structures may explain amyloid-specific cold denaturation due to the unfavorable burial of charged side-chains in fibril cores. -synuclein fibrils are cold-denatured to monomers at 0-20oC and heat-denatured at 60-110 oC. the fibrils of 2-microglobulin, Alzheimer\u2019s A1-40/A1-42 peptides, and insulin exhibited only heat denaturation. thermal unfolding pattern obtained by differential scanning calorimetry for Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei triosephosphate isomerase (TcIM and TcTIM) are significantly different although the crystal structure of both proteins is almost indistinguishable and the sequences are highly homogolous. residues that behave significantly different between both proteins were selected and proposed for mutations. the general aim is to identify the minimum amount of residue mutations that allow providing TbTIM with the behaviour of TcTIM and vice versa. experimental complementary work is also being performed on the same protein. a set of molecular dynamics simulations were performed at different temperatures between 400 and 700 K. the obtained trajectories were analyzed in detail and the residues that showed to be key in the unfolding pathway of each species were identified. a set of residues that behave significantly different between both proteins were selected and proposed for mutations. tetramer binds specifically to TTR in human plasma, stabilizes the tetramer in vivo and inhibits TTR cytotoxicity. tetramer is a better amyloid inhibitor than Tafamidis, so far the only drug in the market to treat the TTR. the crystal structure of SOM0226-bound TTR explains why this molecule is a better amyloid inhibitor than Tafamidis. despite TTR stabilizers promising drugs to treat TTR amyloidoses, none of them is approved by the fda. molecule is a better amyloid inhibitor than Tafamidis, so far the only drug in the market to

mesophile one commensurate with biosynthesis of \u201cphase 2\u201d amino acids. we tested the effects of aromatic residue addition to the core of a \u201cprimitive\u201d designed protein enriched for the prebiotic amino acids. the subsequent results show that the inclusion of just a single aromatic residue was sufficient for movement to a mesophile folding environment. the interactions that are inferred can help guide experiments that measure the phenotypic consequences of protein substitutions. the present work can be divided into three areas: (i) methodological improvements related to alignment, folding procedure, structure refinement and ranking; (ii) folding of proteins of known structure for benchmarking and prediction of proteins of unknown structure; (iii) focused exploration of specific cases of interest. we use a global probability model to disambiguate direct and indirect correlations. we use a maximum entropy approach called pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM) to

PI-047 Essential and non-essential amino acid species for ancestral protein Satoshi Akanuma1 1Faculty of human sciences, Waseda University The translation system is an essential element for life because it links genetic information embedded in genes to functional molecules, proteins. a number of theories have been proposed for the origin and evolution of the genetic code, and these theories suggest that only a fewer amino acids were used in primitive proteins. reconstructed ancestral kinases are extremely thermally stable. using the most thermally stable ancestral NDK, Arc1, I restricted its amino acid usage. the 19 amino acid species do not equally contribute to the stability and activity of Arc1. NDK catalyzes transfer of a phosphate from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate kinase.

that 740 nm light causes a protomer swapping between the BphP1 dimers. however, the mechanism of the light-induced swapping is poorly studied. full-length BphP1 showed the normal Pfr-to-Pr transition. but 740 nm absorbance changes were similar for both proteins. bacterial phytochromes share common architecture and consist of a PAS-GAF-PHY photosensory core. the mechanism of the light-induced swapping is poorly studied. we tested an ability of the protomer swapping between the BphP1 dimers. it was shown that 740 nm light causes a protomer swapping between the dimers. we propose that the impaired Pfr-to-Pr transition is caused by restricted Pr conformation in the mutant rather than by fast Pr-to-Pfr relaxation. understanding the mechanisms of the BphP1 light-induced changes should advance engineering of bacterial phytochromes into fluorescent probes and optogenetic tools. more than 75% of heterodimers (strep-tagged-BphP1 and BphP1-mRuby2) form within 2.5 h of incubation under 740 nm light. in darkness, the swapping was much slower. phytochromes found in bacteria share common architecture and consist of a PAS-GAF-PHY photosensory core and a C-terminal output module. a

outcomes. we applied phenotype similarities between various diseases for expanding molecular connections of cancer-type-specific variants. cancer variants that cause the similar disease phenotypes tend to be linked as a cluster of biological pathways or functions. cancer-type-specific variants of 7 cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed to find phenotype-inferred relationships among the variants. cancer-type-specific modules could explain the underlying pathogenicity of specific symptoms which manifest in particular cancer types. from over 1500 generated

present work is to create a model of the core of Gracilaria chilensis. to achieve these we have used molecular biology, biochemistry and bioinformatics techniques. we designed oligonucleotides primers for the four allophycocyanin subunits genes. auxiliary photosynthetic complexes allow cyanobacteria and red algae to enhance the energy uptake in the range of 490-680 nm. these proteins possess chromophores which capture energy and then transfer it to photosytems. the main goal in our group is to build an atomic model of the Gracilaria chilensis phycobilisome. the sequences were translated to a aminoacid sequences and used to build a 3D model for APC subunits and trimers using the software Modeller. on the other hand we purified and analyzed the spectroscopic properties of APC from Gracilaria chilensis using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. the antennas are composed of PE and PC, whose function is to capture energy between 490-570 and 590-625 nm respectively and transfer it to the core. the core is formed by APC, which can absorb energy in the 620-650 nm range. the first atomic model of Gracilaria chilensis phycobilisome core was built. a tri-cylindric core
