{"summary": "the city health department assessed all contact persons (contacts) retrospectively and monitored them prospectively. all contacts received a questionnaire for retrospective documentation and prospective daily self-monitoring of symptoms, exposure to the patient, and infection control measures applied. each day from march 19 through April 5, information was collected about the distance from the patient. paired serologic samples were taken from any contact with respiratory illness. the first was taken immediately after contact and the second was >28 days after the last exposure. a structured questionnaire was used for the interview and information collected was documented on paper. an aerosol-producing procedure was defined as respiratory suction, bronchoalveolar lavage, intubation, or bronchoscopy. close-distance contacts were asked to contact the City Health Department daily for 10 days after the last exposure to the patient. a respiratory tract sample was taken from any contact with respiratory illness. serum samples were tested for antibodies against influenza A, B, and C; rhinovirus A, B, and C; parainfluenzavirus 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; human metapneumovirus; coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1; and adenovirus. all samples were analyzed at the Institute for Virology of the University of Bonn. n = 10 0.725 Swab sample collected 9 (90) 8 (89) 1 (11) No swab sample collected 1 (10) 1 (100) 0 PCR results for symptomatic contacts with swab samples, n = 9 NA MERS-CoV positive 0 NA MERS-CoV negative 9 (100) 8 (89) 1 (11) HCoV-NL63 positive 1 (11) 1 (100) 0 Rhinovirus positive 2 (22) 2 ( a respiratory symptom or fever developed in 10 (12%) contacts. all 9 swab specimens were negative for MERS-CoV; 1 (11%) was positive for CoV NL-63; 2 (22%) were positive for rhinovirus. all 7 serum samples were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. 1 (8%) of 12 daily exposures occurred while FFP2 or FFP3 masks were being used before March 21. after that date, 11 (79%) of 14 daily exposures occurred while FFP2 or FFP3 masks were being used (p0.01) patient Questionnaire The patient was a 73-year-old married man from Abu Dhabi. four (5%) of the contacts were members of the patient\u2019s family, 16 (19%) were physicians, 25 (30%) were nursing staff, 20 (24%) were laboratory personnel and 18 (22%) were part of other professional groups. clinical follow-up was available for 81 (98%) contacts. not done 23 (28) 15 (65) 8 (35) Serologic testing among symptomatic contacts, n = 10 0.107 MERS-CoV positive 0 NA NA MERS-CoV negative 7 (70) 7 (100) 0 Not done 3 (30) 2 (67) 1 (33) Percentages are of contacts (N = 83) unless otherwise indicated. the patient's children and son-in-law had their last contact with the patient on march 20 and his wife on march 23. no protection measures had been used until after March 20. all 4 provided respiratory swab and serum samples on march 24. dromedary (Camelus dromedaries) and Bactrian (C. bactrianus) camels were reported to have had a respiratory illness in the 2 weeks before his onset of illness. the patient had no contact with other MERS-CoV patients, had no personal contacts in Qatar or Jordan, and had no travel history in the 10 days before illness onset. the patient's illness was likely a primary case, and possible exposures that might have caused the MERS-CoV infection were explored. the patient\u2019s illness was likely a primary case, and possible exposures that might have caused the MERS-CoV infection were explored. a daily monitoring questionnaire provides detail in clinical information, exposure, and protection measures. such a questionnaire could be expanded to include a section for contact persons to fill in the names of persons with whom they had face-to-face contact each day."}
