{"summary": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer\u2019s disease. it is caused by an imbalance between the inhibitory action of dopamine and the excitatory action of acetylcholine because of decrease in dopamine. PD is progressive and worsens with time, and there is currently no cure. the effectiveness of integrative therapy consisting of both biomedicine and KM on the management of PD patients was investigated. the data masked 2,980 diagnoses, including those of cancer and infective diseases. the NHIS-NSC 2nd version (2002\u20132015) of the NHIS-NSC was generated in 2017, but the data masked 2,980 diagnoses. patients who were diagnosed with PD during the eligibility period were excluded. only those newly diagnosed with PD from 2007 to 2011 were excluded. the NHIS-NSC does not have survey or examination data. the severity of disability of the patients included in the NHIS-NSC was considered as a confounder. the treatment period in neurology, hospitalization period in neurology and anti-parkinsonism medications were also considered confounders. the propensity score (PS) was used to increase the level of causality revealed in the observational study. the NHIS-NSC 2nd version (2002\u20132015) of the NHIS-NSC was generated in 2017, but the data masked 2,980 diagnoses. the eligibility period was set from January 2002 to December 2006. the cohort index was set from January 2007 to December 2011. treatment type, integrative therapy group received both biomedicine and KM. monotherapy group was only treated with biomedicine. but patients who received the treatment only once were excluded. the treatment period in neurology, hospitalization period in neurology and anti-parkinsonism medications were also considered confounders. the propensity score (PS) was used to increase the level of causality revealed in the observational study (D\u2019Agostino, 1998). Specifically, the PS was used to match subjects with similar characteristics in the two groups. statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. 117 patients were treated using both biomedicine and Korean medicine. 1,321 received biomedicine alone. 79 (21.1%) 23 (20.2%) 23 (20.2%) 2009 25 (21.4%) 278 (21.0%) 25 (21.9%) 16 (14.0%) 2010 26 (22.2%) 236 (17.9%) 24 (21.1%) 26 (22.8%) 2011 36 (30.8%) 393 (22.9%) 35 (30.7%) 44 (38.6%) Charlson Comorbidity Index 0.308 0.489 0 0 0 (0.0%) 5 (0.4%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 1 17 103 (7.8%) 6 (5.3%) 5 (4.4%) Anti-parkinsonism medication Levodopa 68 (58.1%) 326 (24.7%) 0.001* 65 (57.0%) 58 (50.9%) 0.352 Ropinirole 34 (29.1%) 126 (9.5%) 0.001* 32 (28.1%) 27 (23.7%) 0.450 Pramipexole 18 (15.4%) 74 (5.6%) 0.001* 16 (14.0%) 15 (13.2%) 0.8 hospitalization because of PD, dementia, depression, and pneumonia/sepsis in the integrative therapy group was positive compared to the monotherapy group. however, the prevalence of total hospitalization, hospitalization because of PD, dementia, depression, and pneumonia/sepsis in the integrative therapy group was positive compared to the monotherapy group. comparison of annual length of hospitalization between groups using a t-test revealed that total annual length of hospitalization, annual length of hospitalization due to PD, annual length of hospitalization due to depression and annual length of hospitalization due to pneumonia/sepsis were shorter. the integrative therapy group was divided into two groups (over 30 days, less than 30 days) by treatment duration. the prevalence of total hospitalization, as well as hospitalization because of PD, dementia, depression and pneumonia/sepsis showed positive results. however, these differences were not statistically significant. after and after PS matching, the characteristics of both groups were statistically similar (Table 1).

KM seems to have a positive effect on infectious diseases such as pneumonia and sepsis. the incidence and prevalence of PD in Asian countries, including south Korea, have been shown to be lower than in Europe and America. this difference may result from genetic and ethnic differences, but the possibility of the effects of CAM, including KM, cannot be ruled out. study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dongguk University, Gyeongju (DRG IRB 20170015) patient consent was exempted because of the total anonymity of all research data used in this study."}
