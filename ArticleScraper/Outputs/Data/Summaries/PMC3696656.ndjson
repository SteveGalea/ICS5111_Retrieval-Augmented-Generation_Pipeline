{"summary": "bacterially expressed proteins selected as fusions with a phage coat protein do not express or retain their function in mammalian cells. peptides too small to be expressed by themselves are typically first evaluated on the surface of the phage by ELISA. however, this approach is quantitatively imprecise and retains artifacts from the original selection (5, 6). expression in bacteria also precludes use of certain fusion proteins. pDQ1 Vector Construction pDQ1 was constructed by inserting an Fc fusion expression cassette into a pUC-derived plasmid. a segment following the CMV promoter was replaced with sequence encoding the IGH1 signal peptide. the 5\u2032 end of the signal peptide intron was then replaced with sequence encoding the Lac operon promoter, a ribosome binding site, and the STII* signal peptide. individual exons comprising the Fc domain of human IgG1 (green); and an SV40 polyadenylation termination signal (gray) mammalian expression utilizes a CMV promoter and encodes a chimera of the IgG1 signal peptide and STII*, the same library component. library design and Assembly Primers were designed using four handmixes. each containing 85% of the template nucleotide and 5% of the remaining three nucleotides. library 1 was constructed using CD4mim2 as a template. a streamlined phage display workflow was used in this study.

Colonies from the titer plates were sequenced to monitor library diversity. the expansion and panning process was repeated for a total of three or four pans until the library size was reduced to 30 unique clones of 200 sequences. immunoprecipitation Miniprep DNA prepared from sequenced colonies was transfected into 12-well plates of 50% confluent 293T cells at 1 g of DNA/well. 93T cells in 140-mm plates were transfected with 25 g/plate at 50% confluence by standard calcium phosphate transfection. 10% FCS-DMEM was replaced with serum-free 293 Freestyle medium (Invitrogen) medium was collected 48 h later, and debris was cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 g. 293T cells at 50% confluence in T175 flasks were transfected with 25 g of plasmid encoding envelope glycoprotein and 45 g of NLEnv. 10% FCS-DMEM was changed at 12 h, and medium was collected at 48 h. CF2th-CCR5 cells were incubated with pseudoviruses generated with pNL4\u20133.Luc.R-.E bearing the indicated HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and encoding firefly luciferase. infection was measured as in neutralization studies. DMEM + 10% FCS was changed at 18 h after transfection. splice donors and acceptors were engineered to excise domains specific to phage display. a second splice links regions encoding a mammalian signal peptide to one encoding the protein under selection. bacterial and mammalian signal sequences share four amino acids and encode an efficient splice acceptor. peptide Fc fusion proteins were produced directly from pDQ1 phagemid clones in mammalian cells. the alternative workflow used here integrates mammalian expression of selected variants. a previously described CD4-mimetic peptide included three unnatural amino acids (20\u201322) CD4mim2 was used as a template to generate a first library of CD4mim variants. the final composite product of our first selection cycle was used as a template. both libraries were soft randomized from their respective templates. peptide, CD4mim6, was selected as a template for a second soft-randomized library. the procedure was repeated, and an improved peptide, CD4mim6, was selected. both peptides bound measurably to 293T cell surface-expressed HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers. T cells transfected to express the trimeric envelope glycoproteins of the indicated clade B (HXB2, ADA, 89.6) and clade C (SA32) isolates. background binding, determined using Fc domain alone, was 15 mean fluorescence intensity in each case. CD4mim1 and CD4mim6 were synthesized as free peptides without an Fc domain. no neutralization was observed for CD4mim1-Ig. model of CD4mim variants with alterations indicated. CD4mim6 increased association of E51 with the envelope glycoprotein. phenylalanine 23 binds a critical pocket of gp120 occupied by CD4 phenylalanine 43. phenylalanine 23 was replaced with a tryptophan. ylalanine 23 was replaced with a tryptophan. cells were then incubated with an anti-gp120 antibody. ylalanine 23 was replaced with a tryptophan. the bacterial and mammalian signal sequences share four C-terminal amino acids and encode an efficient splice acceptor. the vector, pDQ1, expressed Fc fusion products in mammalian cells as efficiently as the original pCDM8-derived vector. the alternative workflow used here integrates mammalian expression of selected variants. the composite peptide best bound gp120 and neutralized HIV-1 then served as the template for a new phagemid library and a subsequent round of selection. we began with a previously described CD4-mimetic peptide that included three unnatural amino acids (20\u201322) these amino acids were reverted to their closest natural form, introducing a cysteine at position 1, a phenylalanine at position 23, and a valine at position 27 to generate CD4m peptide-Fc fusions were used to compare output variants for functional activity in immunoprecipitation and HIV-1 neutralization assays. CD4mim6-Ig bound measurably to 293T cell surface-expressed HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers. the remaining 21 residues were encoded by doped oligonucleotides. surface plasmon resonance studies with immobilized gp120 made clear that the basis for the efficient binding was due to a slower off-rate, five times slower for CD4mim6-Ig. the more flexible CD4mim6-Ig accessed more gp120 conformations than the fixed CD4mim1-Ig. synthetic monomers of CD4mim1 and CD4mim6 were compared in the same assay. CD4mim6 neutralized the indicated isolates with IC50 values. IC50 values for CD4mim1 were >4\u20138 g/ml. 4mim4, the product of the first cycle of phage selection and the template the second phage library, has eight total differences from CD4mim1. all models are based on the Protein Data Bank structure 1YYM by Huang et al. (20) and generated with the PyMOL mutagenesis tool. we incubated CD4mim6 with cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein ADA. CD4mim6 or CD4mim6W more potently neutralized HIV-1 than CD4mim6. however, little or no infection was observed at any concentration with CD4mim6W. splice donors and acceptors were engineered to excise domains specific to phage display and thereby encode a protein-of-interest fusion with the Fc domain of human IgG1. a second splice links regions encoding a mammalian signal peptide to one encoding the protein under selection, excising sequence encoding a bacterial promoter and signal peptide. peptide-Fc fusion proteins were produced directly from pDQ1 phagemid clones in mammalian cells. the alternative workflow used here integrates mammalian expression of selected variants. peptide-Fc variants were compared using flow cytometry, plasmon resonance and surface plasmon resonance. soft randomization is a diversification technique that allows the introduction of a small number of amino acid changes (e.g. 5) distributed throughout a larger peptide (e.g. the 28 amino acids of CD4mim2 and CD4mim4) CD4mim6 outperformed in immunoprecipitation and neutralization assays. both peptides bound measurably to 293T cell surface-expressed HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers. but at all concentrations, and for all clade B and C envelopes assayed, CD4mim6-Ig bound more efficiently than CD4mim1-Ig and similarly to CD4-Ig. ding was determined by flow cytometry using a goat anti-human secondary antibody. background binding, determined using Fc domain alone, was 15 mean fluorescence intensity in each case. Fig. 4, A and B shows a model of CD4mim6 bound to HIV-1 gp120, with changes from CD4mim1 highlighted. CD4mim6 modeled into the CD4 binding site of HIV-1 gp120. phenylalanine 23 binds a critical pocket of HIV-1 gp120 occupied by CD4 phenylalanine 43. occupation of this same gp120 pocket with a tryptophan has been shown to increase the potency of the neutralizing antibody NIH-45\u201346 (26). binding was determined by flow cytometry using a goat anti-human secondary antibody. background binding, determined using Fc domain alone was 15 mean fluorescence intensity in each case. infection, measured as luciferase activity was determined as in Fig. 3C. the bacterial and mammalian signal sequences share four C-terminal amino acids and encode an efficient splice acceptor. the resulting vector, pDQ1, expressed Fc fusion products in mammalian cells as efficiently as the original pCDM8-derived vector from which the Fc gene was cloned. the alternative workflow used here integrates mammalian expression of selected variants. a previously described CD4-mimetic peptide included three unnatural amino acids (20\u201322) these amino acids were reverted to their closest natural form, introducing a cysteine at position 1, a phenylalanine at position 23, and a valine at position 27 to generate CD4mim1. ped oligonucleotides favoring template amino acids at an 85:5:5:5 ratio. peptide-Fc fusions were used to compare output variants for functional activity in immunoprecipitation and HIV-1 neutralization assays. an optimal peptide was selected as a template for a second soft-randomized library. more total CD4mim6-Ig bound to immobilized gp120. more total CD4mim6-Ig accessed more gp120 conformations than fixed CD4mim1-Ig. synthetic monomers of CD4mim1 and CD4mim6 were compared in the same assay. IC50 values for CD4mim1 were >4\u20138 g/ml. experiment is representative of two with similar results. CD4mim6 modeled into the CD4 binding site of HIV-1 gp120. all models are based on the Protein Data Bank structure 1YYM by Huang et al. CD4mim6, but not CD4mim6W, induces the CD4-bound conformation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. 239T cells transfected to express the envelope glycoprotein of the clade B isolate ADA were incubated with the indicated concentrations of CD4mim6 or CD4mim6W. current approaches for validating library outputs limit the number of outputs that can be reasonably evaluated or the precision and range of assays that can be applied. the pDQ1 vector described here permits early selection for efficient mammalian expression and expands the range of available validation techniques. it thus facilitates immediate, sensitive characterization of a large number of library outputs for their biochemical and functional properties. CD4mim1 has been fused at its C terminus with tyrosine-sulfated CCR5-mimetic peptides to make a double-mimetic peptide with considerably higher potency than either peptide alone (23). steric interference between the N terminus of CD4mim1 and gp120 has been observed."}
