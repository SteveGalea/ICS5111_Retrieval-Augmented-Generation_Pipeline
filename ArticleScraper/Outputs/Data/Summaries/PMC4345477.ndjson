{"summary": "the next frontier is to unravel how diseases shape behavioural norms. the public response to a disease outbreak is usually calm and orderly. in rare cases, however, the outbreak of disease can trigger social disturbances. model of the joint spread of disease and social response is based on the amplification of risk framework developed by Kasperson et al. [22] this framework assumes perceptions about the risk of disease are formed within a social context. factors such as the predictability of the disease risk and the society's familiarity with the disease will affect how the disease is perceived. biosurveillance data collected by biosurveillance company ascel bio. data includes 11 926 near-real-time, multi-source reports on disease outbreaks. social response in the data was consistently higher than in endemic countries. BSL-4 diseases were associated with social response 17% of the time. social response occurred only 5% of outbreaks of diseases with lower BSL. most severe diseases are more likely to be associated with social response than less severe diseases. the disease spread network and social response spread network are permitted to differ in our model. agents repeatedly interact according to behavioural rules, which govern the spread of disease and social response. the agents repeatedly interact according to behavioural rules, which govern the spread of disease and social response. agent's disease state at time t is represented by, where S = susceptible, I = infected and R = recovered. the model is initialized with almost all agents in a susceptible state. agents recover after TR time periods, where the parameter TR is set to reflect the time that infected persons continue to circulate. agent's social response can be changed in one of three ways. agents are influenced by their neighbours on the social network. agents will probabilistically update their social responses to be more similar to their neighbours. agent i's social response updates are applied sequentially: Step 1. Social response exchange. each agent's social response after step 1 is a weighted average of its neighbour's social responses plus the media signal received by that agent at time t. 3.8 The model is implemented by simulating the disease-state transitions followed by social response-state transitions. at each time t, Xi(t) is updated for each agent i. then, Xi(t) is updated, first by setting the social response of newly infected agents to and then by communication among agents and reception of a signal from the media. parameter exploration simulations were conducted with 15 000 agents and 500 model realizations. each realization was allowed to run until the disease was no longer spreading. each realization was allowed to run until the disease was no longer spreading. agent's disease state at time t is represented by, where S = susceptible, I = infected and R = recovered. the model is initialized with almost all agents in a susceptible state. agents recover after TR time periods, where the parameter TR is set to reflect the time that infected persons continue to circulate. a social response of 0 indicates no anxiety and no behavioural symptoms. a social response of 1 indicates severe anxiety or behavioural manifestations of concern about disease, such as panic buying or participating in a protest. if the disease is actively spreading, agents can receive an excitatory signal from the media resulting in increased social response. 3.4 Media amplifies concern over the disease when many people are infected in the present compared with the past. a non-zero media signal is sent when the disease is actively spreading in the population. a non-zero media signal is sent when the disease is actively spreading in the population. young et al. paired high media exposure and low media exposure diseases on the basis of mode of transmission, symptoms, mortality and prevalence. they found that infectious diseases that receive extensive media attention are considered to be more severe than diseases that do not receive such attention. we postulate that media attention will increase concern about disease. agent i's social response level is given by 3.6 where Mi(t) is the media signal received by agent i at time t. the hyperbolic tangent is used to restrict the social responses to be within the range [0,1] s were selected because they illustrate how the response to the same disease can change when there are changes in the disease's perceived novelty and severity. formal survey data are quite rare and were not available for the Mexico City H1N1 outbreaks. the model achieved high predictive accuracy. the parameters used in the H1N1 and SARS simulations are shown in table 1. media had little effect on the social response of the agents when the disease was perceived as neither novel nor severe (figure 3a, 0.7). media influence resulted in a social response, even at low levels of media penetration p. 1755 cases were reported, with 299 deaths [30]. a series of surveys of the population measured anxiety using the state-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) it was found that at the height of the outbreak in early April, the residents of Hong Kong were experiencing heightened anxiety. more than 11% of the population of Hong Kong was infected with the global H1N1 pandemic compared with SARS. a majority of residents felt that the H1N1 outbreak had no effect on their daily lives [34]. the simulated social response for H1N1 was much smaller than that for SARS. removing the effect of media in the simulations resulted in a 100% decrease in the expected peak mean social response. the simulated social response for SARS peaked at a high level at the same time as the peak in cases, then declined over the months that followed, returning to a normal level by June 2003. the simulated social response for H1N1 rose only slightly during the outbreak and never reached the same level as during the outbreak. in late august of 2009, there was a second outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico City corresponding with the return of children from the summer school vacation. by that time, fears that the 2009 influenza pandemic could reach the scale of 1918\u20131919 had largely been alleviated. the model predicted a large social response for the spring outbreak. for the significantly larger autumn outbreak, the model predicted low social response. the simulated number of new infections and simulated social response are shown for (a) the spring outbreak and (b) the autumn outbreak. media played a more important role in spreading social response than did the coupling mechanism for both simulated social responses. removing the coupling mechanism resulted in a 97% decrease in the expected peak mean social response for the autumn and spring outbreaks. outbreaks of these diseases have historically been quite small, but have attracted widespread attention. the expected peak mean social response is the largest mean social response observed at any point in the outbreak, averaged over the model realizations. the 2013 dengue fever outbreak in Singapore is an example of such behaviour. removing the coupling mechanism and spreading social response only via the media resulted in a 60% decrease in the expected peak mean social response. in 2003, Hong Kong became the epicentre of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Asia. the disease risk index was set to 0.95 for SARS, reflecting the novelty of the virus, its unexpected appearance in Hong Kong and the high clinical severity of the disease. in these simulations, the widespread media attention directed at SARS helped fuel a large social response in the population, while H1N1 did not produce a social response. search interest in 'H1N1' declined in Hong Kong over July and August. but when it actually arrived and was not as severe as feared, interest dissipated. the arrival of H1N1 in Hong Kong was not a surprise. the simulated social response for H1N1 was much smaller than that for SARS. removing the effect of media in the simulations resulted in a 100% decrease in the expected peak mean social response. the simulated social response for H1N1 rose only slightly during the outbreak and never reached the same level as during the outbreak. in march of 2009, cases of respiratory illness began to surface in la Gloria, Mexico. by April 10, it was reported that 616 people, or 28.5% of the population, had been infected. by the time it appeared that a novel H1N1 influenza virus was responsible for the outbreak. the spring and autumn outbreaks are compared in table 3. the disease spread parameters and disease risk index were fit to the distinct dynamics of the spring and autumn outbreaks using the procedure outlined in the electronic supplementary material. for the autumn outbreak, we lowered the disease risk index to 0.60. the number of cases produced in the spring outbreak was relatively low. the social response in the spring outbreak was triggered by heightened media attention. there is no significant association between the number of confirmed influenza cases and the influenza search index (r = 0.21, d.f. = 32, p = 0.24), which suggests that the interest in influenza was not primarily driven by people infected with the disease. an approach to quantitative estimation of social response with greater content validity is needed for better validation of the simulations in the future. model can account for large and small social response resulting from changes in novelty and perceived severity of disease. we have shown that even when a disease has low incidence and social response does not spread by word of mouth, media influence can produce a social response. incorporating mechanisms for analysis of effects of mitigation measures will further enhance the model's usefulness. predictions will help policy makers better respond to disease outbreaks by bringing to their attention when there is risk for social disruption."}
