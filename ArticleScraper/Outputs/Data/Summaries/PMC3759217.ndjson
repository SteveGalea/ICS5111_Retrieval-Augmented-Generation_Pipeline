{"summary": "the incidence of cancer is continuously increasing and is often associated with a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, infectious agents, exposure to mutagens, as well as lifestyle factors. cancer immunotherapy has seen many more clinical failures than successes. recent breakthroughs have led us to believe that this approach may become an established therapeutic modality for the treatment of cancer within the next decade. ideally cancer vaccines should be administered for a prolonged period of time (possibly as chronic treatment) without loss of immunogenicity. if vaccinations are discontinued, self-responses tend to vane due to the presence of mechanisms of tolerance. non genetic Vaccines Whole cell vaccines use irradiated cancer cells, either autologous or allogeneic, as source of tumor antigens. they have been shown to induce tumor-specific immunity and durable anti-tumor responses in a number of Phase I and II trials. genically well-defined cell lines provide access to a sustained and virtually unlimited source of TAAs. cell lines allow for highly standardized large-scale production of vaccines. eliminating the need for the continuous production of tailor-made individual vaccines simplifies the logistics and reduces the laboriousness of the vaccine production and delivery process. nonrandomized phase II study in patients with stage IIIA/IV melanoma. median OS was 23 months compared with 7 months for historical controls. canvaxin did not demonstrate efficacy in a phase III study as a post-surgical adjuvant treatment. despite the technical complexity, sipuleucel-T was recently awarded fda approval based on a successful Phase III trial showing improvement in overall survival in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic advanced castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). there are several features of the clinical development of DC- and immune cell-based cancer vaccines bear several features. heat shock proteins are intracellular molecules of a family characterized by members of similar molecular mass (such as hsp70 and hsp90) they act as chaperones for a repertoire of peptides, including normal self-peptides and antigenic peptides. release by necrotic cells functions as an endogenous danger signal. peptide-based cancer vaccines have yielded relatively poor results in the clinical setting. the results of the Phase III clinical trial in 676 metastatic melanoma patients deserve a particular mention. ipilimumab improved median overall survival from 6.4 to 10.1 months. one possible interpretation for lack of efficacy of peptide vaccines in a patient population otherwise responsive to immunotherapy is the necessity to generate a polyclonal immune response directed simultaneously against several MHC class I epitopes. this could not be achieved in the clinical trial cited above because it made use of a single-epitope peptide. other single peptide vaccines are still in advanced clinical development. antigens MART-1, gp100, and tyrosinase were administered in patients with metastatic unresectable melanoma. median survival of patients with vaccine immune response was significantly longer than that of patients with no immune response (21.3 versus 13.4 months; P = 0.046) cancer patients are vaccinated with multiple tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs) isolated from tumor specimens and identified by mass spectrometry. the most advanced development for the MAGE-A3 vaccine is in a Phase III trial called MAGRIT (MAGE-A3 as Adjuvant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Immunotherapy) the most advanced development for the vaccine is in a Phase III trial called MAGRIT (MAGE-A3 as Adjuvant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Immunotherapy), which began in October 2007. the objective of the MAGRIT trial is to investigate the efficacy of MAGE- cDNAs encoding one or several antigens are inserted into the viral vector. the resulting recombinant viruses are used to infect the host. the ideal viral vector should be safe with respect to disease-causing potential, transmissibility and long-term persistence in the host. a randomized, empty vector-controlled, double-blinded Phase II study was designed and powered for the short-term end point of Progression Free Survival (PFS) but failed to find an association between vaccine treatment and slowing down disease progression. 30% of PROSTVAC-VF\u00ae vaccinated patients still alive versus only 17% of controls. clinical response (primary endpoint), safety, time to treatment failure (TTF), OS, and immune response. median OS was 19.3 months for all patients and 22.4 months for combination therapy recipients. transgene identified a subpopulation of patients who particularly benefited from the treatment with TG4010 and chemotherapy, versus chemotherapy alone. the production of recombinant adenoviral vectors relies on the use of a packaging cell line that complements the functions of adenoviral gene products which have been either deleted or engineered to be non-functional. in the central part of the figure is a schematic structure of the adenoviral genome. adenoviruses comprise a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses found in amphibians, avians and mammals. adenoviruses comprise a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses found in amphibians, avians and mammals. Ads can transduce dividing and non-dividing cells without integrating into the genome of the host cell. human Ads (hAds) are divided into six subgroups (A\u2013F) based on a number of biological, chemical, immunological and structural criteria. hemagglutination properties of rat and rhesus monkey erythrocytes, DNA homology, restriction enzyme cleavage patterns, percentage G+C content and oncogenicity. antibodies against the hexon protein dominate the neutralizing response elicited when humans are infected by hAd. the hexon protein is composed of seven short hypervariable regions (HVRs), each of which can elicit a serotype-specific immune response. the use of uncommon Ad serotypes should bypass the issue of pre-existing immunity. alic acid and CD80/CD86 have been shown to act as receptors for hAd subgroup D [60] and for hAd3 [61], respectively. comparison of hAd5- and hAd35-based vectors in mice and nonhuman primates showed a lower immunological potency of the latter vector. the strategies to avoid Ad vector neutralization are particularly relevant to their use as cancer vaccines. one of the major obstacles to achieving a tumor specific immune response is that of overcoming central and/or peripheral T cell tolerance against TAAs and inducing CTLs that could effectively eradicate disseminated tumor metastases. ine\u00ae are recombinant Ad5 with the E1 region replaced by a human wild type p53 expression cassette containing a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter. the best known example is Onyx-015, the first engineered replication-selective virus to be used in humans. several groups are currently assessing the immunologic and clinical activity of Ad vectors expressing a variety of TAAs. it will be of great interest to verify how local and systemic suppression exerted by the tumor itself as well as pre-existing immunity to Ad will impact the outcome of these studies. viral capsids interact with the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) as an initial binding step, followed by secondary engagement of the integrin co-receptors 51, v3, v5, and M2. other cell surface molecules have been described for the process of Ad binding and internalization. two well-characterized human subgroup C adenovirus serotypes (hAd2 and hAd5) were initially most widely used as the source of viral backbone for the majority of adenoviral vectors used for gene therapy and vaccine development. recently, clinical results have shown that Ad vectors based on common human serotypes, such as serotype 5, may not be ideal as vaccine carriers. hAds subgroup B (including hAd3, 7, 11 and 35) is less prevalent in the human population. presence of anti-hAd5 antibodies does not block transduction efficiencies of these vectors. hAds can infect cells via human CD46 (membrane complement protein) no pre-existing anti hAd5 cross-neutralizing antibodies have been detected in humans or mice. chimpanzee Ad (ChAd) vectors have proven particularly effective tools as vaccines against a variety of viral antigens and diseases. overcoming central and peripheral T cell tolerance against TAAs and inducing CTLs could effectively eradicate disseminated tumor metastases. Advexin\u00ae and Gendicine\u00ae are recombinant Ad5 with the E1 region replaced by a human wild type p53 expression cassette containing a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Rous sarcoma virus promoter. the best known example is Onyx-015, the first engineered replication-selective virus to be used in humans. an oncolytic virus derived from HSV is being actively pursued by Amgen/Biovex. oncoVEXGM-CSF selectively infects and generates GM-CSF in tumor cells resulting in increased tumor antigen presentation by recruited DCs. this agent is currently in Phase III trials of melanoma and head& neck cancer. the antigen cDNA can be fused to an immunoenhancing moiety. the ability to make new DNA vaccines without needing to handle a virulent pathogen or adapt it for manufacturing purposes opened the suitability of this vaccine technology. onceptTM has been approved by drug administration authorities. onceptTM has been shown to extend survival of dogs with stage II or III oral canine melanoma. in mouse models, DNA vaccines have been successfully directed against a wide variety of tumors. but there is still a need to improve the delivery of DNA vaccines and increase the immunogenicity of antigens expressed from the plasmids. the success of these trials is difficult to interpret due to the heterogeneity of the patient populations [99,100]. Vaccines encoding individual DNA idiotypic single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to Tetanus Toxoid Fragment C (TTFrC) were delivered as naked DNA by i.m. injection in patients with follicular lymphoma in clinical remission following chemotherapy. in vivo EP has been associated with a consistent enhancement of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in small and large animals. the most advanced technologies are those being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals [111] and by Ichor Medical Systems [112] VGX-3100TM is currently in phase II development for Cervical Displasia/Cancer by Inovio. it includes plasmids encoding E6 and E7 proteins of HPV types 16 and 18. 13 out of 18 vaccinated subjects (72%) developed significant T-cell responses. id is also being developed in partnership with Merck that encodes human Telomerase (hTERT) both vaccines are being delivered in Phase I studies using MedPulser\u00ae DNA Delivery System in combination with Ad vectors. several attempts are being made to enhance immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. the second approach consists in the creation of DNA vaccines containing tumor antigen sequences fused to other genes. the fused microbial protein engages local CD4+ T cells to provide help for anti-tumor immunity, and to induce more potent CD8+ T cell responses able to suppress tumor growth. DNA-EP is a desirable vaccine technology for cancer vaccines. it is repeatable several times, as required for the maintenance of anti-tumor immunity. the addition of in vivo EP has been associated with a consistent enhancement of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in small and large animals. the most advanced DNA-EP cancer vaccine product in clinical development is VGX-3100TM currently in Phase II development for Cervical Displasia/Cancer by Inovio. the most advanced DNA-EP cancer vaccine product in clinical development is VGX-3100TM currently in Phase II development for Cervical Displasia/Cancer by inovio. the first approach aims at enhancing the expression of the encoded antigen in eukaryotic cells transduced in vivo. the first approach aims at enhancing the expression of the encoded antigen in eukaryotic cells transduced in vivo. the second approach consists in the creation of DNA vaccines containing tumor antigen sequences fused to other genes. the fused microbial protein engages local CD4+ T cells to provide help for anti-tumor immunity, and to induce more potent CD8+ T cell responses able to suppress tumor growth. heterologous prime/boost protocols are best positioned to overcome 'therapeutic immunity' threshold. the sequential administration of plasmid DNA and an adenoviral vector may result in synergistic immune activation. a further advantage of heterologous prime/boost protocols is that one can exploit strong immunogenicity of Ad as best priming agent to break tolerance. a recent meta-analysis of 500 cases of advanced cancer patients treated with therapeutic peptide vaccines found that 6 severe adverse events were related to the vaccine itself. the occurrence of autoimmunity is particularly evident in therapies with systemic immunomodulators more than with cancer vaccines. the occurrence of autoimmunity is particularly evident in patients with systemic immunomodulators more than with cancer vaccines. genetic vaccine vectors under development bear two significant differences compared to gene therapy with retroviral vectors. electroporated DNA [132], Ad [133] or Pox vectors used for cancer vaccines have a very low or null chromosomal integration, respectively, in the host genome. genotox studies for any new genetic vaccine as part of the documentation to be included for IND filings. a development paradigm that takes into account the evolving scenario and draws inspiration from the consistent improvement of endpoints for cancer immunotherapy trials."}
