{"summary": "MERS-CoV was identified as the causative agent of a new viral respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. since then, more than 1,500 cases and 571 deaths have been reported worldwide. major outbreaks have been confined to the Middle East and, more recently, to south Korea. nsp5 is a second viral protease (3C-like protease [3CLpro] that cleaves both pp1a and pp1ab to the final nsp products. nsp5 is a second viral protease that cleaves both pp1a and pp1ab to the final nsp products. ERS-CoV and SARS-CoV elicit limited interferon responses in most cell types. these viruses express antagonists of the IFN response, including SARS-CoV ORF6, ORF3b, and nucleoprotein. enzymatic activities of nsp14 and nsp16 endow the viral RNA with a 2\u2032-O-methylated cap structure that mimics cellular mRNAs. genes encoding molecules that directly interact with the host immune system are thought to be preferential targets of natural selection. nsps may represent targets of natural selection as a consequence of host-pathogen arms races. adaptation to new hosts in other RNA viruses has been associated with selective changes in polymerase genes. the alignments were screened for the presence of recombination events. recombination breakpoints were considered significant if the P value was 0.05. a false-discovery rate correction was applied to take into account a multiple-hypothesis issue. es empirical Bayes analysis was used to evaluate the posterior probability that each codon belongs to the site class of positive selection on the foreground branch. an alternative model that allows the action on positive selection on specific branches is compared with a null model that does not allow an of >1. if the null model is rejected, at least one site is under positive selection on the foreground branch. to detect coevolving sites in the ORF1a and ORF1b alignments, we applied two different methods: the Bayesian graphical model (BGM)-Spidermonkey (39) and the Mutual Information Server To Infer Coevolution (MISTIC) (40). MISTIC estimates the relationship between two or more positions in an alignment. recombination breakpoints were considered significant if the P value was 0.05. recombination breakpoints were considered significant if the P value was 0.05. positive selection can be defined when the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio () is higher than 1; to analyze the presence of episodic positive selection in lineage C betaCoVs, we applied the branch site test (31) from the PAML suite (32) the test is based on the comparison between two nested models: a model (MA) that allows positive selection on one or more lines (called foreground lineages) and a model (MA1) that does not allow such positive selection alternative and null model at each site is compared to a 2 distribution (degree of freedom = 1). site models implemented in PAML were applied for the analysis of nsp3 sequences from MERS-CoV isolates. sites were filtered based on a minimum count of 4 substitutions across the phylogeny. this threshold corresponds to 0.02% and 1.42% of all analyzed site pairs in ORF1a and ORF1b respectively. membrane protein topology was predicted by using TMHMM (41) additional viruses belonging to lineage C of betaCoVs have been described to occur in bats (BtCoV/133 and BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013) and hedgehogs (hedgehog coronavirus [EriCoV]) recently, a virus belonging to the same species as MERS-CoV was isolated in Neoromicia bats (45) the phylogenetic tree of ORF1a obtained with phyML was consistent with previously reported ones (45, 46) an estimate of the extent of functional constraint along ORF1a was obtained by identification of negatively selected sites (total number = 903) and calculation of their distribution among nsps. nsp7 and nsp9 were not targeted by selection. nsp3 was preferentially targeted by episodic positive selection. nsp3 was preferentially targeted by episodic positive selection. b 2lnL is twice the difference of the natural logs of the maximum likelihood of the models being compared. c MA and MA1 are branch site models that assume four classes of sites. most sites were located in nsp3 (Fig. 1; see also Table S3). nsp resulted in a preferential selection target at nps3 in MERS-CoV. 87 sequences were retrieved from nps3 isolated from camels or humans. no recombination breakpoint was detected by either GARD or GENECONV. nsp3 M1a vs M2aa 15.25 0.00048 0.6 (17.24) G720, R911 M7 vs M8b 14.15 0.00085 1.6 (11.59) a M1a is a nearly neutral model that assumes one class between 0 and 1 and one class with an of 1. b M7 is a null model that assumes that 01 is beta distributed among sites. positively selected sites were mapped onto known domain 3D structures of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (PDB codes 2GRI, 3EWR, 4RNA, and 2K87) the acidic domain is shown in gray because it was not analyzed (see the text) positively selected sites were found in the so-called transmembrane region of nsp3. we performed an in silico prediction of transmembrane helices and glycosylation sites. in analogy to other CoVs, some hydrophobic regions predicted to be transmembrane are unlikely to span the lipid bilayer. positively selected sites affecting the dimerization process are labeled. positively selected sites affecting the dimerization process are labeled. the only positively selected site in nsp16 (K249) is involved in the interaction with both nsp16 (59) and nsp14 (60) a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype in MHV disrupts nsp5 function (61) this observation suggests that this loop may be involved in interaction with other nsps or that amino acid changes in this loop can modify nsp10 conformation (61). positively selected sites in lineage C betaCoVs are shown in green. lineage C of betaCoVs includes two bat species closely related to MERS-CoV, namely, Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, isolated from lesser bamboo bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelles (Pipistrellus abramus) nsp11 is shown in gray because it was not analyzed (because it is too short) positively selected sites are represented by triangles, with colors corresponding to the selected branch in the phylogeny. branches set as foreground lineages in independent branch site tests are highlighted with different colors and numbered. nsp3 was preferentially targeted by episodic selection (Bonferroni corrected P value = 0.010) during the evolution of MERS-related CoVs. a total of 55 selected sites were detected. nsp1, 1 nsp2, 8 nsp3, 2 nsp4, 1 nsp4, 1 nsp6, 1 nsp10) 25 26.84 2.20 107 (2.75 107) 7.52 0.023 ORF1b 18 0.78 0.38 (0.475) 17 8.53 0.0035 (0.0058) 2.8 0.246 16 12.70 3.6 104 (0.0009) 17.36 1.70 104 1 (nsp12) 23 37. the degree of constraint in nsp12 to nsp16 was comparable to that observed for ORF1a. fewer selected sites were detected than for ORF1a. most sites were targeted by selection on the branch leading to bat CoVs. adaptive evolution at this site started before the spread to humans. all of them belong to group 3 and include the virus responsible for the recent south Korean outbreak (MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH) most positively selected sites were located in nsp3. in the PLpro domain, four of the positively selected sites were clustered in a spatially confined region opposed to the catalytic crevice. in the PLpro domain, four of the positively selected sites were clustered in a spatially confined region. one positively selected site in the Ubl1 domain precedes a conserved acidic loop that when mutated in SARS-CoV determines a lethal phenotype (49) one of the positively selected sites (T1080) is part of the 2 helix, which forms a structure possibly interacting with ssRNA via a charged patch (51). two other positively selected sites (G453 and A479) are located in the C-terminal domain of the protein (Fig. 3C) this domain is cytosolic and interacts with viral and host proteins (55). two of them were proposed to affect the correct domain orientation required for dimerization of MERS-CoV nsp5 (56). mutation of residue 61 in SARS-CoV nsp10 strongly reduces interaction with nsp14. in MHV and SARS-CoV, S61 is located on an exposed loop that also includes Q65. mutation of Q65 results in a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype in MHV. the positively selected site 138 (Asn in MERS-CoV) is located on a solvent-exposed flexible loop (not present in the structure) on the RNA binding groove. this loop may be involved in interaction with RNA (64). DISCUSSION In recent years, the emergence of both viruses stirred great interest in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses. branch site tests are relatively insensitive to the saturation issue (69). in both ORF1a and ORF1b, episodic selection was particularly strong on the branch leading to bat CoVs (HKU4, HKU5, and BtCoV133), possibly reflecting specific characteristics of these host species. epistasis is very common in viruses and is thought to play an important role in the evolution of immune evasion, host shifts, and drug resistance. the latter is likely not at play in the case of MERS-CoV and related viruses. interactions are likely to be common in ORF1a and ORF1b. a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in MHV nsp10 affects viral replication by blocking the activity of nsp5. ts mutations in MHV nsp5 can be rescued by second-site suppressor changes located in physically distant protein regions. sites in the PLpro domain affect the enzyme's specificity toward the viral polyprotein but also in terms of deubiquitination and deISGylation activities. mutant nsp3 and nsp4 carrying different amino acids at positively selected sites in the large luminal loops will be instrumental to determine whether these changes affect the formation of membrane rearrangements onto which the RTC assembles. nsp3 represents a preferential target of positive selection and that the adaptive process is ongoing in variability at position 720 is also observed among viruses isolated from camels. variation at the second selected site (R911) was observed only for viruses isolated from human patients. adaptation of a zoonotic virus to a new host is expected to result in selective events that optimize viral fitness in terms of replication efficiency, transmissibility, and immune evasion (72)."}
