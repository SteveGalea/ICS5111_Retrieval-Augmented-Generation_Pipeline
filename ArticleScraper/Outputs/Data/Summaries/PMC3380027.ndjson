{"summary": "Poisson regression modeling has been widely used to estimate influenza-associated disease burden. but few studies have discussed how to judge the adequacy of confounding adjustment. results were evaluated by bias and root-mean-square error. underreporting of influenza cases was due to the fact that influenza infections usually caused relatively mild symptoms. even for those with laboratory confirmed infections, influenza was rarely recorded as underlying cause of death on their death certificates. four model selection criteria were considered in this study. daily concentrations of air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matters with diameter less than 10 m (PM10) were obtained from the census & Statistics Department. flut and RSVt denote the proxy variables for influenza and RSV. three natural cubic spline smoothing functions of s(t, df = 11k), s(Tempt) and s(Humt) are added to adjust for time (t = 1,2,...,574), weekly mean temperature (Tempt) and relative humidity (Humt) we simulated 500 mortality datasets by assuming that mortality followed a negative binomial distribution, i.e. when [24]. the degrees of freedom of s(t, df changed from 1 to 2,3,..., 10 per year. we then applied Model (1) with degrees of freedom varying from 1\u201310 per year for s(t,df) to each set of 500 simulated data. standard error and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were defined as the standard deviation and square root of the mean square error of estimated coefficients. the criterion that obtained the minimal RMSE under the different assumptions of confounding was considered as the best criterion in selecting the model with adequate adjustment for confounders. influenza-associated hospitalization rates were defined as the difference between the observed and expected hospitalization under the assumption of no circulating influenza viruses. bias and RMSE were calculated by comparing with the observed admission rates of a pediatric cohort of influenza hospitalization cases. co-circulation of RSV, together with two meteorological factors of temperature and humidity, are adjusted for as confounders. unmeasured confounding is adjusted by including the long-term and seasonal trends of outcome variables. flut and RSVt denote the proxy variables for influenza and RSV, which are weekly proportions of specimens testing positive for influenza. the coefficient for influenza variable Flut fixed to 0.33 (i.e. mortality increasing 3.3% when the influenza positive proportion increases 10%) the over-dispersion parameter was also derived from this model. we repeated the above simulation process with degrees of freedom changing from 1 to 2,3,..., 10 per year. r(R) is the trace of weighted additive-fit operator corresponding to the last iteration of the local-scoring procedure. we calculated the bias as the average difference between the estimated coefficients of the influenza variable from the best-fit model and the true coefficient of 0.33. standard error and root-mean-square error were defined as the standard deviation and square root of the mean square error. five age groups were considered: 01, 12, 25, 510, 1018 years. this model was similar to model (1), except that two proxies for adenovirus (Adenot) three types of parainfluenza viruses were added as confounders. these data were only available after 2003. most models overestimated influenza effects with a few exceptions. estimates tended to have larger biases as seasonal confounding increased. RMSE was similar between the models selected by PACF, QAIC or QBIC when the df of smoothing functions for time were less than 5 per year. a shorter study period of 2003\u20132008 or 2006\u20132008 showed slightly higher RMSE than those from the whole study period. but GCV provided the smallest biases and RMSE compared to the other three criteria. estimates from the four criteria were comparable for the 12 and 25 age groups. two recent studies have demonstrated the estimates of influenza-associated hospitalization derived from Poisson regression models reasonably matched the numbers of patients with laboratory confirmed influenza infections [17], [29]. however, it is extremely difficult to obtain the gold standard data on influenza associated deaths to assess the validity of the statistical models. in this simulation study, we mainly focused on the determination of degrees of freedom by an appropriate model selection criterion. the best-fit model was selected by minimizing each of the selection criteria, but the magnitude of their difference was not assessed. the best-fit model was selected by minimizing each of the selection criteria. burnham and Anderson (2002) developed a set of cutoff points for AIC to select the models with meaningfully different estimates. so far there are no commonly accepted cutoff points for those selection criteria used in our study. we did not take into consideration the difference magnitude between these values. our results suggested that the GCV criteria should be recommended for selection of the best-fit model in the future disease burden studies using Poisson models. standardization of this modeling procedure shall increase the reliability of estimates and facilitate the comparison across countries or regions. the fitted hospitalization data were derived from the best-fit models selected by the generalized cross validation criterion. the fitted hospitalization data were derived from the best-fit models selected by the generalized cross validation criterion."}
