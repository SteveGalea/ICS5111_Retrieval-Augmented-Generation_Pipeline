{"summary": "four known HCoVs have been identified in just the last 10 years. two, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing lethal respiratory and systemic infection [1], [3]\u2013[6]. studies have expanded the known phylogenetic, geographic, and species diversity of CoVs. coV nsp14-ExoN is a member of the DEDD superfamily of DNA and RNA exonucleases. this superfamily contains four conserved D-E-D-D acidic residues required for enzymatic activity. mutation of these critical residues within CoV ExoN ablates or significantly reduces ExoN activity. ribavirin (RBV), an antiviral drug shown to be mutagenic for some RNA viruses, was ineffective against SARS-CoV [25]\u2013[28]. using the nucleoside analog RBV and the base analog 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; [29] we show that CoVs lacking ExoN activity are up to 300-fold more sensitive to inhibition than wild-type CoVs (ExoN+) Viral studies using SARS-CoV were performed in select agent certified BSL-3 laboratories using protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of Vanderbilt University. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), ribavirin (RBV), guanosine (GUA) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) were obtained from Sigma. oN+ or exoN viruses at an MOI of 1 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell (single-cycle) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. DMEM containing vehicle, RBV, 5-FU, MPA, or GUA was added back. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for either 12 (single-cycle) or 24 (multi-cycle) h. real-time qRT-PCR was performed on the RT product using the Applied Biosciences 7500 Real-Time PCR System with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. each reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 L containing 12.5 L of the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 125 ng each of the forward and reverse primers. four microliters of RT product was used to generate 12 overlapping 3 kb amplicons for each virus treated with either 0 or 400 M 5-FU by PCR. the polymerase Easy A (Agilent) was used to ensure that errors were minimal during PCR. cDNA amplicons were fragmented (Fragmentase, NEB) and clustered. each variant allele's rate was initially modified according to its covering read qualities based on a maximum likelihood estimation and test for significance using Wilks' theorem. only alleles with statistically significant p0.05 values were retained and considered to be true variants. Viral studies using SARS-CoV were performed in select agent certified BSL-3 laboratories using protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of Vanderbilt University. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), ribavirin (RBV), guanosine (GUA) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) were obtained from Sigma. MHV-ExoN+ or ExoN viruses at an MOI of 1 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell (single-cycle) or 0.01 (multi-cycle) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. DMEM containing vehicle, RBV, 5-FU, MPA, or GUA was added back. cells were then incubated for 24 h. real-time qRT-PCR was performed on the RT product using the Applied Biosciences 7500 Real-Time PCR System with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. each reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 L containing 12.5 L of the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 125 ng each of the forward and reverse primers. exoN infected Vero monolayers was harvested using TRIzol reagent. RT was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III as described above. four microliters of RT product was then used to generate 12 overlapping 3 kb amplicons for each virus. each variant allele's rate was initially modified according to its covering read qualities. an allele confidence interval was calculated and output for each allele. above 0.01% all variants were found to be statistically significant, while below 0.01% many variants could not be distinguished from background error. sensitivity of MHV-ExoN+ and ExoN viruses to RBV during single-cycle replication in murine astrocytoma delayed brain tumor cells (DBT cells) no toxicity was observed in DBT cells following treatment with up to 400 M RBV. MHV-ExoN+ viruses were resistant to 10 M RBV, while MHV-ExoN virus titers decreased by 200-fold following treatment with 10 M RBV. MHV-ExoN+ viruses are shown in blue and MHV-ExoN viruses are shown in green. the change in virus titer was calculated by dividing virus titers following treatment by the untreated controls. the change in genomic RNA levels (2Ct) is shown relative to endogenous GAPDH expression. the antiviral activity of RBV against ExoN viruses is not primarily due to mutagenesis. unexpectedly, multi-cycle replication of MHV-ExoN viruses in the presence of RBV was indistinguishable from single-cycle replication. RBV caused decreased RNA synthesis in MHV-ExoN viruses. the relative specific infectivity of MHV-ExoN viruses was decreased by 6- to 9-fold following treatment with RBV or 5-FU. MHV-ExoN+ viruses were unaffected. a concentration-dependent decrease in MHV-ExoN virus titer was observed during single- and multi-cycle replication. similar to RBV, increased sensitivity of MHV-ExoN viruses to MPA was not observed during multi-cycle replication. addition of extracellular guanosine (GUA) should restore virus titers. treatment of MHV-ExoN+ titers with up to 400 M 5-FU did not result in any detectable cellular toxicity. titers of MHV-ExoN+ decreased 900 fold, representing a 300-fold increase in sensitivity compared to MHV-ExoN+. titers were reduced by less than 10-fold following 5-FU treatment. cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. all values were normalized to the untreated control. change in virus titer was calculated by dividing virus titers following treatment by the untreated controls. treatment of Vero cells with up to 400 M RBV or 5-FU did not decrease cell viability by more than 20%. previous studies have shown that RBV failed to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vero cells. Vero cells in 96-well plates were incubated with DMEM alone. all values were normalized to the untreated (DMEM) control. change in SARS-ExoN+ (filled blue circles) and SARS-ExoN (empty green circles) titers. tic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have demonstrated that 5-FU is incorporated as 5-fluorouridine monophosphate into replicating viral RNA. to determine whether 5-FU was causing increased mutagenesis in SARS-CoV populations, we performed full-genome NGS analysis of both virus populations. 5-FU-associated A-to-G and U-to-C transitions are highly represented and distributed across the genome Incorporation of FUMP instead of uracil into replicating RNA allows FUMP to base pair with both guanosine and adenine. this decreased specificity in base pairing has been shown in studies with LCMV. incorporation of FUMP results in increased U:C and A:G transitions. all possible base changes are shown for SARS-ExoN+ and SARS-ExoN viruses in panels (A) and (B), respectively. transitions (AG and UC) are shaded in grey. the sensitivity of MHV-ExoN+ and exoN viruses to RBV during single-cycle (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) replication. no toxicity was observed in DBT cells following treatment with up to 400 M RBV. at least 10-fold higher concentrations of RBV are required to inhibit poliovirus and chikungunya viruses [48]\u2013[50]. this observation could be due to the longer genomes of CoVs or to the mechanism(s) by which RBV inhibits CoV replication. DBT cells were infected with MHV-ExoN+ or MHV-ExoN in the presence or absence of RBV. virus titer was determined by plaque assay. change in genomic RNA levels (2Ct) is shown relative to endogenous GAPDH expression. multi-cycle replication of MHV-ExoN viruses in the presence of RBV was indistinguishable from single-cycle replication. unexpectedly, multi-cycle replication of MHV-ExoN viruses in the presence of RBV was indistinguishable from single-cycle replication. a dose-dependent reduction in MHV-ExoN titers was observed. MHV-ExoN+ 0 1 0 1 5 1.20.1 0.840.06 100 0.330.05 3.40.5 10 1.90.2 0.560.05 200 0.240.03 4.50.4 MHV-ExoN 0 1 0 1 5 0.190.04 6.00.7*** 100 0.100.03 13.62.9** 10 0.260.11 9.13.0* 200 0.0120.004 12829** Relative specific infectivity values were calculated using the data shown in Figures 1 addition of 100 M GUA following RBV or MPA pretreatment and viral infection had no effect on MHV-ExoN+ viruses. but completely restored MHV-ExoN titer even in the continued presence of 10 M RBV or 1 M MPA. this data indicate that the antiviral activity of RBV against MHV-ExoN viruses is occurring at least in part through decreasing viral RNA synthesis. MHV-ExoN+ RNA levels were not reduced following 5-FU treatment. 5-FU treatment resulted in minimal two-to-five fold decreases in MHV-ExoN RNA. the specific infectivity of MHV-ExoN was decreased by 14- and 128-fold following 5-FU treatment. the change in virus titer was calculated by dividing virus titers following treatment by the untreated controls. the change in titer (filled bars) and genomic RNA levels (hatched bars) of MHV-ExoN+ (blue) and MHV-ExoN (green) viruses is shown. previous studies have shown that RBV failed to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells [59]. in our experiments both SARS-ExoN+ and ExoN viruses were unaffected by treatment with up to 400 M RBV. titer was determined by plaque assay on vero cells. mean values S.E.M. are shown, n = 2 (RBV) and n = 4 (5-FU) 5-FU drives increased mutagenesis in both SARS-ExoN+ and exoN populations. fected with either SARS-ExoN+ or ExoN viruses following treatment with either 0 M or 400 M 5-FU. we then generated 12 overlapping cDNA amplicons of approximately 3 kb in length for each sample. for each sample, 1.4108 to 4.5108 bases were sequenced. for each sample, 1.4108 to 4.5108 bases were sequenced. treatment with 5-FU caused the number of U:C and A:G transitions to increase in both ExoN+ and ExoN populations. in untreated cells, A:G and U:C transitions accounted for less than 25% of the total minority variants within each population. 5-FU-mediated U:C and A:G transitions are distributed across the entire genome following treatment with 400 M 5-FU. Approximately 75% and 90% of the total minority variants occurring at a frequency between 0.1 and 1% were due to A:G or U:C transitions. increased and decreased fidelity mutants have been described for picornaviruses and arboviruses [35], [48], [50], [69], all of which have occurred in the viral RdRp. a Sindbis virus variant containing mutations within nsP1 has been shown to be resistant to both RBV and MPA [72]. exoN+ SARS-CoV populations showed 24-fold more mutations following 5-FU treatment. this suggests that exoN proofreading can be overwhelmed by higher concentrations of mutagens and likely by other nucleoside or base analogs. this raises the further possibility that ExoN may be less efficient at recognizing or removing some types of nucleoside or base analogs than others. nsp14 contains N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity, a critical step in RNA capping. a recent report has demonstrated that the ExoN and N7-MTase domains are structurally inseparable. the parallel use of MHV-ExoN viruses with RBV could result from the impairment of undefined functions of ExoN during CoV replication. exoN inactivation likely skews the spectrum of spontaneous mutations present within the untreated population. this altered distribution due to ExoN inactivation could have profound implications for coV adaptation and evolution. combining an inhibitor of CoV fidelity with an RNA mutagen would magnify the intrinsic fidelity defect of ExoN inhibition and drive high-level mutagenesis. a potential advantage of such an approach would be to rapidly drive the virus to extinction. antiviral nucleoside analog RBV is currently used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV; [73]\u2013[75] and Lassa virus [76] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. the potential clinical use of RBV for CoV infections is complicated by the multiple mechanisms of action that have been reported [38]. oN and N7-MTase domains are structurally inseparable. the increased sensitivity of MHV-ExoN to RBV could result from the impairment of undefined functions of ExoN during CoV replication. mounting evidence points to a role for nsp14-ExoN in proofreading activity during RNA virus replication. lethal mutagenesis occurs through the accumulation of mutations within the viral genome during replication, and ultimately results in virus extinction. the first demonstration of RBV acting as a mutagen was performed using poliovirus [23], [24] almost 30 years after the antiviral activity of RBV was described. exoN mutants of both MHV and SARS-CoV have shown no reversion over multiple passages in culture or during persistent infections in vivo [19]\u2013[21]. the maximum tolerance for increased or decreased fidelity without loss of virus viability is between 3- to 6-fold [35], [48], [69], [91]."}
