{"summary": "admission serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can serve as a predictor of illness severity. results Seventeen (9%) of the 191 enrolled patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom eight (4%) required mechanical ventilation and three (2%) died. serum CRP levels obtained in the early ED admission stage from patients presenting with pandemic H1N1 influenza A were found to serve as a useful gauge for predicting disease course. there is no single laboratory test that can serve as a potential biomarker to identify the patients at high risk for a complicated clinical course. data were collected for all consecutive patients admitted to the ED between May 1 and December 31, 2009. these criteria included flu-like symptoms, such as a body temperature of 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) or higher, cough or sore throat, and a real-time reverse transcriptase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1 virus. a telephone survey conducted at least 30 days since hospital admission. a value of p.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistical significance. the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. data were collected for all consecutive patients admitted to the ED between may 1 and December 31, 2009. these criteria included flu-like symptoms, such as cough or sore throat, and a real-time reverse transcriptase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1 virus. all patients whose serum CRP levels were measured within 24 hours of presentation to the ED were eligible for inclusion, whether they were subsequently hospitalized or discharged after initial evaluation. Statistical Analysis Values are presented as means SD or median and interquartile range (IQR) for the continuous variables and as number of individuals (and the percentage in each group) for the categorical variables. patients' mean age was 43 16 years (range 18-85) there were 95 (50%) female and 96 (50%) male patients. most common background medical conditions were active smoking (n = 50, 26%), asthma (n = 37, 19%), diabetes mellitus (n = 24, 13%) and COPD (n = 22, 12%). the median time from symptom onset until presentation to the ED was 72 hours. median (IQR)* 96 (24 - 168) 72 (48 - 120) 0.506 Sys BP (mmHg), median (IQR) 128 (104 - 148) 125 (114 - 140) 0.904 Hypotension (sys BP 90 mmHg), median (IQR) 80(62 - 95) 77 (69 - 84) 0.619 Heart rate (beats/min), median (IQR) 100 (81 - median(IQR) 5.9 (4.2 - 8.1) 5.6 (3.9 - 8.7) 0.750 % LYM (%), median(IQR) 0.6 (0.4 - 1.1) 0.9 (0.6 - 1.3) 0.057 Platelets (103/ml3), median (IQR) 203 (155 - 222) 209 (169 - 251) 0.307 Creatinine (mg/dl), median (IQR) 1.1 (0.9 - the same clinical observation was noted in regard to patients who required mechanical ventilation compared to those who did not. the prevalence of these findings was significantly higher among the patients who required ICU care compared with those who did not. the dotted boxes represent the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentiles) the thick black line in the box is the 50th percentile (median) the black dots are \"outliers\" and the black star is an \"extreme outlier\" the Cox proportional hazard model was applied to assess the ability of serum CRP level to predict the need for mechanical ventilation. the first variable that entered the model was CRP (p =.001), followed by abnormal auscultatory findings (p =.028). the first variable that entered the model was CRP (p =.001), followed by abnormal auscultatory findings. no patients with a serum CRP level 28 mg/L (upper tertile) needed to be admitted to the ICU or required mechanical ventilation. at the same time point, 19% of the patients with a serum CRP level 70 mg/L needed to be admitted to the ICU. low initial serum CRP levels were an excellent predictor of good outcome. a cut-off value of 33 mg/L is a viable choice that achieves 100% sensitivity. a slightly higher CRP cut-off of 64 mg/L achieved lower but acceptable sensitivities. the high serum CRP levels are usually found among patients with bacterial infections. the absence of an agreed protocol for the measurement of serum CRP in patients with H1N1 virus infection admitted to the ED led to the exclusion of 34% of the 315 patients. the absence of an agreed protocol for the measurement of serum CRP in patients with suspected or confirmed H1N1 influenza A virus infection led to the exclusion of 34% of the 315 patients. authors' contributions OZ participated in conception, design and coordination of the study, acquisition of data, interpretation of data and manuscript drafting.
