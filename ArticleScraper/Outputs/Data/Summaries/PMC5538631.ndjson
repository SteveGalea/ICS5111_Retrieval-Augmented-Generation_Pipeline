{"summary": "open data and open science can confer benefits to researchers, including increases in citation, media attention, and potential collaborations. open data and open science projects encourage crowdsourcing of solutions to scientific problems. open data and open science projects are needed to address global health issues. the prize competition was open to any solution that exhibited the benefits of making research outputs open and usable. the use of prize competitions as a funding mechanism has several advantages over traditional funding mechanisms (e.g., grants, contracts) the prize competition was structured in 2 phases: phase I sought the most innovative and promising ideas and proposed open science tools. phase II provided a grand prize award (US$230,000) for the best prototype of the Phase I finalists. the public was invited during a 5-week period to vote and comment on their favorite prototypes. the teams were asked to develop written narratives summarizing progress to date. they were asked to address key factors such as innovation, utility, feasibility and technical merit, and development and sustainability plan for their prototypes. the public was invited to cast their votes and provide input. \u201cReal-Time Evolutionary Tracking for Pathogen Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation\u201d was developed by a team from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Washington and the University of Basel, Switzerland. the project uses an online visualization platform (http://www.nextstrain.org) the outputs of statistical analyses of viral genome sequences can be used by public health officials for epidemiological insights within days of genome sequences having been obtained from viral pathogen samples taken from patients. the development of new funding models, like the OSP, is important for several reasons. one prior example of the power of open data is the human Genome Project. many health and disease issues pay little attention to national borders and are optimally addressed with collaborative teams. each funding agency has its own approval processes, which added additional time to the development of shared documents such as funding announcements or press releases. organizational policy differences had to be considered in the creation of the initiative. funding organizations encouraged the creation of open data but left it to the solvers to establish their intellectual property and business models for the proposed and proof-of-concept technology. a 2-step funding model is an effective way to encourage innovation whilst minimizing the cost. public participation is a good way to increase the reach of the competition. holding a public vote was an effective way to raise awareness of open science. the nature of this competition means that engagement with and wider use of the tools is critical to their impact. the open science prize was open to any solution that exhibited the benefits of making research outputs open and usable. the prize was open to any solution that exhibited the benefits of making research outputs open and usable and demonstrated new and innovative ways of enabling this. the prize competition was structured in 2 phases: Phase I sought the most innovative and promising ideas and proposed open science tools. phase II provided a grand prize award

public was invited during a 5-week period to vote and comment on their favorite prototypes. a group of advisors with expertise in open science, health information technology, and/or biomedical research methods were selected to provide comments on the submitted applications and prototypes. the public was invited during a 5-week period to vote and comment on their favorite prototypes. funders selected \"Real-Time Evolutionary Tracking for Pathogen Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation\" the project uses an online visualization platform (http://www.nextstrain.org) the output of statistical analyses of viral genome sequences can be used by public health officials for epidemiological insights within days. a platform for rapid (real-time) data sharing of pathogen genome data with open source code. the 3 funding agencies were able to increase the size of the purse prizes. leveraging resources through partnerships can be a key strategy for promoting innovation. democratizing science can create novel solutions to complex and/or challenging health problems. democratizing science can create novel solutions to complex and/or challenging health problems. democratizing science can create novel solutions to complex and/or challenging health problems. a prototype of a prototype is a first step toward deriving value from open data. some teams were able to leverage the Phase I funding to acquire additional funds. other teams were still seeking additional funding. the OSP has implications for organizational policy, technology development and the funding of science. funding partners should develop a strong shared commitment and understanding of what they are trying to achieve. a 2-step funding model is an effective way to encourage innovation whilst minimizing the cost. the 6 finalists naturally did not represent the breadth of ideas proposed. consider establishing different categories\u2014best new tool, best cross-cutting application, etc.\u2014rather than having a single winner. consider refining the OSP funding model to create future global initiatives focused in particular areas. the international aspects of this competition enriched each of the funding agencies\u2019 understanding of new ideas emerging around the globe. the competition was notable in its ability to highlight the value of open health data to the broader scientific community."}
