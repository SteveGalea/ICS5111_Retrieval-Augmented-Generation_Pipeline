{"summary": "the marsh rice rat was in good body condition but was moderately dehydrated. both ear pinnae were diffusely thickened and mildly ulcerated. the rice rat was part of an IACUC-approved breeding colony. multiple sections from the ear pinnae, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract were fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin. sections from the ear pinnae, liver, spleen, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract also underwent immunohistochemical staining. immunostained rice rat lymph node and spleen were compared with murine lymph node and spleen. neoplastic lymphocytes infiltrating both ear pinnae and the liver and spleen were strongly positive for the T-cell marker CD3 but were negative for the B-cell markers CD19 and CD20. the dermis of the pinna is diffusely thickened due to infiltration of lymphocytes. hyperkeratosis (*)is present. Hematoxylin and eosin stain; magnification, 400. neoplastic lymphocytes are strongly immunopositive for CD3 (brown) MF is characterized by infiltration of small to medium-sized neoplastic lymphocytes with a specific tropism for the epithelium and adnexal skin structures. in as many as one third of cases as the disease progresses, lymphocytes become larger, and blasts may be present. resection of a solitary CETL skin lesion in a squirrel was performed. local recurrence was not observed 10 mo later. few animal models of MF have been described in literature."}
