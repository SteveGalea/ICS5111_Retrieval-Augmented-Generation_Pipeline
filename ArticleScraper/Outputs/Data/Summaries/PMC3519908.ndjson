{"summary": "biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, PLGA, is the US FDA approved material in the development of nanoparticle-based controlled release delivery system. PLGA slowly degrades and releases the vaccine over a long-period of time, thus avoiding the need of a booster dose. pigs are already in use as an animal model system to study a few viral diseases. control of PRRS remains a challenge to the swine industry worldwide. Optimal mucosal immunization induces protective immune response at both mucosal and systemic sites compared to systemic immunization. biodegradable microspheres made of PLGA and liposome have been in use to deliver candidate vaccines to mucosal sites. PRRS-MLV and killed virus vaccines are in use to control PRRS. but neither of them protects pigs completely against heterologous field viruses. there are reports of reversion of vaccine virus into virulence leading to severe disease outbreaks. the viral pellet was aliquoted and stored at 70\u00b0C. control antigen was prepared similarly using uninfected MARC-145 cells. anti-PRRSV nucleocapsid specific mAb SDOW17 (Rural Technologies, Inc.), early endosome specific goat polyclonal anti-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA-1) IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Flour488 and donkey anti-goat Alexa flour 633 (Invitrogen), and incubated for 1 hr at pigs and inoculations Conventional large white\u2013Duroc crossbred weaned specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs from three different litters at 3\u20134 wks of age were confirmed seronegative for PRRSV, porcine respiratory corona virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine Circo virus 2 antibodies. pigs (n = 9) were grouped randomly into three groups (n = 3 per group) each vaccine dose had same amount of Ags as described above. pigs were challenged with PRRSV MN184 (0.5106 TCID50/ml, 2 ml per pig) on PID 21 and euthanized on day post-challenge (PC or PC) 15. pulmonary lesions given an estimated score based on the percentage of consolidated lesions in individual lobes as described previously [28]. sections (3 m) made were stained for hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) as described previously [29] sections were immunostained as described previously [29] the bound virus specific isotype antibody was detected using anti-pig IgA and IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (KPL) plates were developed using the chromogen TMB and read at 450 nm. we also included non-PRRSV antigen-coated plates as control and the OD values obtained from experimental plate were subtracted from the control. Statistical analysis All data were expressed as the mean of three pigs +/ SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey's test. 15% of PLGA 50/50 (750 mg) was dissolved in 5 mg of killed VR2332 proteins, homogenized at 6000 rpm for 90 seconds. then added to aqueous solution of 10% polyvinyl alcohol and homogenized. nanoparticles were freeze-dried and stored at 4\u00b0C. endosome specific goat polyclonal anti-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA-1) IgG was diluted in the dilution buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% triton X-100) for 1 hr at RT. cells were washed in between the treatment steps and treated with a mounting medium containing 2.5% DABCO (Sigma) pigs (n = 9) were grouped randomly into three groups (n = 3 per group) each vaccine (Nano-KAg and K-Ag) dose has one mg of crude viral preparation containing 5106 TCID50 of inactivated virus. each vaccine dose had same amount of Ags as described above. the dose of nano-KAg (1 mg per pig) was chosen based on the results of a dose-dependent response study performed earlier in pigs. pigs received food and water ad libitum and maintained under a veterinarian. all the pigs were maintained, samples collected, and euthanized. lin-and-eosin sections were immunostained as described previously [28] sections were treated with PRRSV nucleocapsid protein specific mAb (SDOW17) or isotype control mAb followed by ABC peroxidase staining kit. the labeling was visualized by application of DAB (3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine) substrate (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin. PRRSV specific cytokine response on antigen restimulation Five million pigs PBMC, TBLN (tracheobronchial lymph nodes) MNC, and lung MNC were subjected to ex vivo restimulation in the absence or presence of PRRSV MN184 Ags (50 g/ml) as described previously. the harvested supernatant was analyzed to measure cytokines. key's test using GraphPad InStat (software version 5.0) to establish differences between unvaccinated, K-Ag and Nano-KAg pig groups in post-challenge trial. the average protein content in nanoparticles or core-loading was 0.50\u20130.55% (w/w), which represents an encapsulation efficiency of 50\u201355%. confocal images of alveolar Ms revealed preferential uptake of Nano-KAg but not unentrapped viral Ags (K-Ag), PRRSV infected cells served as a positive control. 57% of BAL-MNC treated with Nano-KAg was positive for PRRSV protein comparable to virus-infected cells. lung MNC and PBMC from nano-KAg secreted significantly reduced levels of cytokine, IL-10, and higher amounts of IL-6 in a recall response. innate cytokine IFN- was secreted at significantly higher levels in pigs vaccinated with Nano-KAg compared to both the control groups. nano-KAg vaccinated MN184 challenged pigs were clinically healthy with no fever or respiratory distress. both K-Ag and unvaccinated, MN184 challenged pigs had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during the first two-week post-challenge study. significantly reduced lung lesion scores in Nano-KAg immunized group compared to other virus challenged groups was observed. each bar represents the statistical significant difference (p0.05) between unvaccinated and Nano-KAg received pig groups. a similar trend was obtained in an independent second trial performed using same number of animals. the PRRSV specific IgG antibody levels in serum and both IgA and IgG levels in the nasal swab were significantly higher in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs. a similar trend of increased (but not significant) titers of neutralizing antibodies in nano-KAg immunized pigs was seen. nanoparticle-based PRRSV vaccine showed enhanced innate immune response in pigs Nano-KAg vaccine received MN184 virus challenged pigs had significantly increased innate IFN- production in the lungs. pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated, challenged and euthanized as indicated in Fig 3 legend. each bar or data point in the graph represents average values from three pigs SEM. Asterisk represents the statistical significant difference (p0.05) between unvaccinated and Nano-KAg received pig groups. similar trend was obtained in an independent second trial performed using same number of animals. different immune cell subsets present in PBMC and TBLN MNC were enumerated by flow cytometry. a CD172+ cells were gated to enumerate CD11c and SLAII expression and the percent of DCs rich fraction (CD3CD4 CD8+) is shown. each number is an average percent of immune cells from three pigs +/ SEM. increased IFN- was secreted in both PBMC and TBLN-MNC of nano-KAg. increased IL-10 was seen compared to both virus challenged groups. increased IFN- was secreted in both PBMC and TBLN-MNC. in vitro characterization of sham and PRRSV Ags entrapped PLGA nanoparticles was determined by scanning electron microscopy. the average protein content in nanoparticles or core-loading was 0.50\u20130.55% (w/w), which represents an encapsulation efficiency of 50\u201355%. confocal images of alveolar Ms revealed preferential uptake of Nano-KAg but not unentrapped viral Ags (K-Ag), PRRSV infected cells served as a positive control. engulfed nanoparticles delivered the PRRSV Ags to early endosomes. nano-KAg elicited enhanced innate and suppressed regulatory response in a pre-challenge study. pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated as indicated. innate cytokine IFN- was secreted at significantly higher levels in pigs. nano-KAg vaccinated MN184 challenged pigs were clinically healthy with no fever or respiratory distress. both K-Ag and unvaccinated, MN184 challenged pigs had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during the first two-week post-challenge study. pigs were clinically healthy with no fever or respiratory distress. immunohistochemistry analysis showed abundant PRRSV antigen positive cells in the lung sections of unvaccinated and K-Ag vaccinated pigs compared to nano-KAg received pigs. PRRSV titer in serum samples indicated a reduced viral load of greater than one-log at PC 7 with complete viral clearance by PC 15 in Nano-KAg vaccinated. also the PRRSV titer in both the serum and lung homogenate showed a reduction the PRRSV specific IgG antibody levels in serum and both IgA and IgG levels in the nasal swab were significantly higher in Nano-KAg vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated and K-Ag immunized pigs at DPC 15. in the lungs, a similar trend of increased (but not significant) titers of neutralizing antibodies in Nano-KAg immunized pigs was seen (Figure 4, C & F based PRRSV vaccine showed enhanced innate immune response in pigs nano-KAg vaccine received MN184 virus challenged pigs had significantly increased innate IFN- production in the lungs. pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated, challenged and euthanized as indicated in Fig 3 legend. each bar or data point in the graph represents average values from three pigs SEM. Asterisk represents the statistical significant difference (p0.05) between unvaccinated and Nano-KAg received pig groups. similar trend was obtained in an independent second trial performed using same number of animals. a CD172+ cells were gated to enumerate CD11c and SLAII expression. c CD25+ cells were gated to enumerate CD4 and CD8 expression. each number is an average percent of immune cells from three pigs +/ SEM. increased IL-10 was seen compared to both virus challenged groups. increased IFN- was secreted in both PBMC and TBLN-MNC. levels of proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in a restimulation response was significantly reduced. nanoparticle mediated vaccine delivery has shown a great promise in mouse models against influenza, parainfluenza, hepatitis B, plasmodium, and venezuelan equine encephalitis pathogens. the knowledge related to cross-protective efficacy of such vaccines in a suitable large animal model is limited. pigs treated with PLGA nanoparticle vaccine (Nano-KAg) increased expression of a costimulatory molecule, CD80/86. a rapid uptake of nano-KAg by lung APCs followed by translocation of viral Ags into endosomal compartment was observed. nano-KAg vaccine significantly increased the frequency of CD8+ T cells, Th/memory cells, with concomitant increase in the secretion of innate (IFN-), proinflammatory (IL-6) and Th1 (IFN-) cytokines. nanoparticles are mediated by the action of innate immune cells, in addition to enhanced production of IL-6 and IFN-. pigs possess relatively large population of T cells compared to other species. they secrete IFN- at both mucosal and systemic sites. both vaccinated and virus challenged pigs have immunosuppressed response. pigs vaccinated intranasally with nano-KAg vaccine completely clear the PRRSV viremia of a virulent heterologous virus by two-week post-challenge. pigs vaccinated intranasally with the vaccine completely clear the PRRSV viremia of a virulent heterologous virus by two-week post-challenge."}
