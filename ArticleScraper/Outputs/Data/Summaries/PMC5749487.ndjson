{"summary": "the control intervention was conducted during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. based on the time series data of the daily MERS-CoV incidence in Korea, the box plots of MERS-CoV incidences in Korea were computed. fectious, Recovered model with estimated parameters from the time series data on the daily incidence of MERS-CoV in Korea was considered from May to December 2015. Depending on the time of control interventions on the 20th, 40th, and 60th days since the index case was identified, the box plots of MERS-CoV incidences in Korea were computed. d X ( t ) d t = j = 1 M c j a j ( t ) d t = j = 1 M c j a j ( t ) d t = j = 1 M c j a j ( t ) d t = j = 1 M a i ( X ) d = i = 1 M a i ( X classes were considered susceptible (S), exposed (or high-risk latent) (E), symptomatic and infectious (I), infectious but asymptomatic (A), hospitalized (H), and recovered (R) the parameters represent human-to-human transmission rate per unit time, the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. step 0: Initialize the time t = t0 and the system\u2019s state X(t0) = X0. step 2: Draw two random numbers r1 and r2 from the uniform distribution in the unit interval. take = 1 a 0 ( X ) ln ( 1 r 1 ) j=the smallest integer satisfying i = 1 j a i ( X ) the difference was markedly larger 100 days after the identification of the index case. the difference was markedly larger 100 days after the identification of the index case, and the effect of the intervention over time showed a decreasing trend. control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea. control measures were carried out on the 20th day after the confirmation of the index case."}
