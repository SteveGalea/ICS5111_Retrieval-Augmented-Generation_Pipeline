{"summary": "a subsample of new immigrant mothers from mainland china made decisions on various childhood and adolescent vaccines for their offspring. the study explored how a subsample of new immigrant mothers from mainland china made decisions on various childhood and adolescent vaccines for their offspring. participants\u2019 conversation revealed five underlying themes which influenced parents\u2019 vaccination decision-making. Hong Kong has almost universal immunization coverage rates for mandated vaccines of 98% or above among local-born children and over 95% among Mainland-born children living in Hong Kong. in 2010 only 72.7% of 19\u201335 month old children received all six USA government-recommended vaccines [4]. the recently introduced HPV vaccine is a typical example targeting young adolescent girls to prevent adult-onset cervical cancer [8]. only 2.4% of secondary school girls [9] have been vaccinated against HPV. parents mostly control young children\u2019s access to vaccines, so understanding parental decision-making for their children\u2019s vaccinations is important. a qualitative study with individual in-depth interviews under a Grounded Theory approach was chosen. it attempts to avoid presumptions, thereby enabling a broad-brush picture of key concerns to emerge as the ground for theory building. participants were recruited using purposive sampling to capture the richness of the phenomenon. interview locations were determined by participants for their privacy and convenience. participants were initially asked whether their children had received all or some routine vaccines recommended by Hong Kong or mainland China governments. mothers were asked about various types of routine and optional vaccines including those for preventing childhood diseases. data analysis was based on original verbatim transcripts written in Chinese. the quotation was presented in English after having been translated and back-translated using ethnographic principles. interviews were conducted in Putonghua and digitally recorded. participants were asked whether their children had received all or some routine vaccines recommended by Hong Kong or mainland China governments. participants were encouraged to discuss their attitudes and concerns about vaccination for their child. data analysis was based on original verbatim transcripts written in Chinese. results Twenty-three new immigrant mothers participated between October 2011 to may 2012. participants\u2019 ages ranged from 27 to 50 years old (median 34 years) lower secondary 10,000-15,000 IM 7 34 Married Hubei 10 m-9 y Housewife Upper secondary 10,000 IM 10 41 Married Guangdong 6-8 y None Primary 13,000 IM 11 34 Married Guangdong 6 y Part-time job Post-secondary 10,000 IM 12 50 Married Jilin 13-23 y Housewife university >30,000 IM 13 32 Married Guangdong 8 m-9 y Housewife Lower secondary 20,000 IM 14 32 Married Guang participants were receptive to all routine vaccinations mandated by either Hong Kong or mainland China governments. a minority of participating mothers had decided to reject all optional vaccines as unnecessary. in Hong Kong, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for 9-45-year-old women and the bivalent for women aged 10-45 years. insufficient knowledge and advice Knowledge-related deficits were widespread and varied, and included misconceptions. ignorance surrounding optional, particularly newly introduced vaccines, is undesirable. chickenpox vaccine, though available since 1995, was frequently mentioned. despite government efforts in 2009-2010 to promote vaccination for children against 2009 pA/H1N1 influenza, several mothers interviewed here were unaware that the vaccine was available during the pandemic. the most commonly reported sources of vaccination information were targeted formal sources, informal conversations with peers, and mass media. sources included those from healthcare workers regarding routine vaccines, such as vaccination record cards for new-born babies from hospitals, and pamphlets from MCHCs. several respondents reported ever receiving advice on optional vaccines from healthcare professionals. some cited business-related explanations for why doctors seldom promote vaccination. most attributed this to healthcare professionals\u2019 lack of time, and avoidance of responsibility. if the doctor is from a government hospital, it is OK. if from the private sector, I would worry. fear of the disease was balanced against possible reduction in worries after vaccination versus fearing the risk of vaccine-related harms. fear of diseases was a key factor motivating parents to adopt vaccination for prevention. iii. perceived controllability of disease Participants were more willing to vaccinate their child. chickenpox will not make people die, just have high fever. parents who believed that VPDs are easily controlled and not so serious expressed less or no worry about those diseases. high cost was one of the biggest barriers hindering participants who wanted to get HPV vaccination for their daughters. many people hesitate, because of the price. it is really expensive. many people cannot afford it. perceived low efficacy of vaccines Misconceptions arising from confusing symptoms of influenza and the common cold (flu) [28] detracted from the perceived efficacy of influenza vaccination. the younger child was vaccinated, but after injection, within one month, she caught cold again. i don\u2019t believe it. how come it can protect for several decades. ii. information extraction By observing peers\u2019 choice, parents assimilated relevant information and assessed the safety, effectiveness and necessity of vaccination. if other people can take the vaccine, it should be fine for us to take it, too. follow the crowd, if many of the crowd are vaccinated, you have no need to be concerned. study participants expressed unanimous confidence about the safety, efficacy and necessity of routine vaccinations in Hong Kong. a minority of participants had decided to reject all optional vaccines as unnecessary since they were not formally recommended by government agencies. in Hong Kong, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for 9-45-year-old women. the bivalent for women aged 10-45 years confused some parents about the appropriate age for vaccination. insufficient knowledge and advice Knowledge-related deficits were widespread. chickenpox vaccine, though available since 1995, was frequently mentioned. despite government efforts in 2009-2010 to promote vaccination for children against 2009 pA/H1N1 influenza, several mothers interviewed were unaware that the vaccine was available during the pandemic. a proportion of these parents may fail to make informed decisions. ii. informal conversations For all participants, conversations were salient sources of information and consultation about optional vaccines. mass media Television, newspapers, and internet were important sources of vaccination information. low trust in optional vaccines advice from healthcare professionals. financial gain was seen as a covert factor possibly influencing recommendations. if he recommends it, definitely I won\u2019t accept it. fear of diseases Among participants who vaccinated or intended to vaccinate their children with optional vaccines, anxiety was expressed about diseases perceived as severe and uncontrollable. fear of the vaccine-targeted disease was a key factor motivating parents to adopt vaccination for prevention. if you are infected, the risk of death was very high, how many people died every day, it was scary. gynecological diseases, i think, are unavoidable. parents who believed that VPDs are easily controlled and not so serious usually expressed less or no worry about those diseases. perceived anxiety reduction after vaccination was a salient factor motivating parents to vaccinate children. free provision of mandatory vaccination under CIP was one of the most important reasons for high immunization compliance. the government provides (vaccines) free, and it is not bad to be vaccinated, so just take it. concerns about vaccination side effects significantly influenced parental VDM towards \u201cnew\u201d vaccines. ii. information extraction By observing peers\u2019 choice, parents assimilated relevant information and assessed the safety, effectiveness and necessity of vaccination. ii. information extraction By observing peers\u2019 choice, parents assimilated relevant information and assessed the safety, effectiveness and necessity of vaccination. if many of the crowd are vaccinated, you have no need to be concerned. follow the crowd, if many of the crowd are vaccinated, you have no need to be concerned. follow the crowd, if many of the crowd are vaccinated, you have no need to be concerned. all participants accepted CIP vaccines as necessary without explicit consideration. obedience to authority/government is unusual in vaccine studies [31-33]. this effect manifests in conformity with perceived peer group action. the risk-as-feeling hypothesis suggests negative affect and cognitive risk evaluations are inter-correlated but divergently influencing decision-making. the utility model proposes that the primary motivating factor for adopting preventive behavior is resolving the anxiety associated with the threat, rather than the threat itself. Vaccination cost emerges as an important contributor to disparities in cervical cancer risk. impaired information communication between health professionals and new immigrant parents probably discourage parents from recommended action. social influence then appears crucial in parental VDM for immigrant Chinese mothers. most other information sources involved one-way mass media. new immigrants tend to take up less skillful jobs in Hong Kong or remain as housewives. the findings are consistent with earlier childhood vaccination decision-making studies in Hong Kong [42,46]. subjective norms only weakly predict intention [49] while descriptive norms are a more substantive predictor of intention [50] there is medium-to-strong sample-weighted average correlation between descriptive norms and intention [51] descriptive norms appear more influential for parental VDM. a reformulation of the social norm concept is needed in future studies of vaccination decision-making.
