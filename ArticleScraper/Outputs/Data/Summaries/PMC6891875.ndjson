{"summary": "influenza-like illness (ILI) is one of the acute respiratory infections, defined by a fever higher than or equal to 38 \u00b0C accompanied by a cough. pathogens responsible for many ILI cases, if not influenza viruses, needed to be further defined. previous studies have shown that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are most common bacteria responsible for respiratory infections. the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and epidemiologic characteristics of different pathogens causing ILI in Jiangsu province in china from 2012 to 2016. at the end of 2017, its population has reached 80.293 million, with males accounting for 50.33% with mainly Han ethnicity. ten samples were selected randomly in every sentinel hospital per month. each sample was tested for influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), influenza C virus (Flu C), HRV, RSV, ADV, 4 strains of hCoV (hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-HKU1), HSV, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. specimens with only a single pathogen detected were considered mono-infection. those with two or more pathogens detected were regarded as co-infection. Statistical analysis The R project was used for all analyses. ten samples were selected randomly in every sentinel hospital per month. each sample was tested for the following pathogens: influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza C virus (Flu C), HRV, RSV, ADV. real-time PCR was performed to detect ADV, hCoVs, HSV, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Specimens with only a single pathogen detected were considered mono-infection. the most frequently detected virus was HRV in 211 patients (6.36%), followed by Flu A in 209 patients (6.30%), ADV in 140 patients (4.22%), RSV in 133 patients (4.01%), HSV in 98 patients (2.95%), hCoV-NL63 in 84 patients (2.53%), hCoV-OC43 in 47 patients (1.42%), hCoV-229E in 14 patients (0.42%), and hCoV-HKU1 in 13 patients ( patients with ILI Characteristics Flu A Flu B Flu C RSV ADV HRV hCoV-229E hCoV-OC43 hCoV-NL63 hCoV-HKU1 HSV S. pneumoniae H. influenzae *Median and interquartile range of age of positive cases for different pathogens. 717) 33 (4.60) 10 (1.39) 1 (0.14) 54 (7.53) 49 (6.83) 65 (9.06) 5 (0.70) 11 (1.53) 24 (3.35) 8 (1.12) 22 (3.07) 139 (19.38) 80 (11.16) 35 years [n (%)] (n=715) 57 (7.97) 16 (2.24) 5 (0.70) 44 (6.15) 38 (5.31) 54 (7.55) 1 (0.14) 15 (2.10) 14 (1.96) median age of patients with at least one positive pathogen was lower than that of patients who tested negative for any of etiologies. patients with flu A, Flu B, HRV and HSV were older than those with S.pneumoniae (P0.001, Mann-Whitney test) etiologies distribution in different regions and years Etiologies Years Regions 2012 [n (%)] 2013 [n (%)] 2014 [n (%)] 2016 [n (%)] Adjusted P-value Nanjing [n (%)] Suzhou [n (%)] Adjusted P-value *Fisher's exact test was used. hCoV-229E 3 (0.40) 3 (0.40) 1 (0.10) 3 (0.50) 4 (0.60) 0.771* 10 (0.63) 2 (0.16) 2 (0.26) 0.167* hCoV-OC43 14 (2.00) 12 (1.80) 3 (0.40) 6 (1.00) 12 (1.80) 0.053* 31 (2.04) 13 (1.10) 5 (0.75) 0.050 hCoV-NL63 25 (3.50) 16 (2 flu A, flu B, RSV, HSV, and S. pneumoniae were detected most often during winter and spring. but flu A also occurred in summer. there were no clear seasonal characteristics with HRV and H. influenzae. co-detection of multiple pathogens was found in 419 cases. two pathogens were found in 315 patients, 3 pathogens in 97 patients and 4 pathogens in 7 patients. positive proportion for single pathogen and multiple pathogens among 3 316 patients with ILI in 20122016. co-infections of S. pneumoniae with one or more viruses were detected in 260 patients, thereinto HRV (63 cases, 24.23%) and HRV (61 cases, 23.46%) were co-detected with it. for those infected with 3 pathogens, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, FluA and HSV viruses were co-detected in 3 cases (42.86%) combining form of 3 or 4 pathogens among 3 316 patients with ILI in 2012\u20132016 Co-detection with three pathogens Co-detection with four pathogens Etiologies Case. flu 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 -
