{"summary": "the culture supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae has an antiviral activity in vitro against PRRSV in SJPL cells. the culture supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae has an antiviral activity in vitro against PRRSV in SJPL cells. uropneumoniae disrupts SJPL cell cycle resulting in inhibitory activity against PRRSV. two putative molecules were identified from the culture supernatant. this study highlighted the cell cycle importance for PRRSV."}
