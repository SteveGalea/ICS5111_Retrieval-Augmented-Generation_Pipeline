{"summary": "intestinal helminths (e.g., nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes) have been identified in the feline alimentary system. 26 species have been detected in cats in Korea. the intestinal trematode Neodiplostomum seoulense (formerly Fibricola seoulensis) causes serious diarrhea. a stray female cat was found dead on the street in china. clinical signs and individual information such as breed and age were unavailable. a small intestinal wall was observed to have thickened. trematodes with the TO were characteristically attached in the intestinal mucosa of cat. a small and subterminal oral sucker was located at the end of anterior body. a large and cordiform tribocytic organ occupied almost the entire anterior body. the PCR product was purified using a QIA amp Purification kit (Qiagen) and commercially sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea) sequences were aligned in BioEdit and then analyzed in MEGA7 (Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, USA) the animal exhibited severe diarrhea and necrotizing enteritis. fluke attachment and damage of intestinal mucosa are the primary causes of these pathological lesions. the oral suckers of flukes probably induce local irritation, erosion, and ulceration. the parasite has been detected in 63/438 (14.4%) feral cats from Busan. stray cats can act as reservoirs, carriers, transmitters, and definitive hosts for many intestinal parasites, including those that are potentially zoonotic."}
