{"summary": "protective immunity acquired in response to P. falciparum exposure appears to be mediated mainly by IgG antibodies specific for variant surface antigens (VSA) women become highly susceptible to P. falciparum infection when they become pregnant. pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is a major cause of mother/offspring morbidity. the molecular identity of VSAPAM remains controversial. current evidence points to VAR2CSA, an interclonally conserved member of the PfEMP1 molecules encoded by the multigene var family. clonal analysis of memory B cells represents a powerful tool to dissect the immune response to complex pathogens. a total of 5760 replicate cultures of 100 immortalized B cells per well were set up. supernatants from 105 of the polyclonal B-cell lines stained one or both of the VSAPAM-expressing lines. these results suggest that the frequency of VSAPAM-specific B cells can be high (at least 1 in 4000 memory B cells) in recently pregnant multigravidae. the higher memory B-cell frequencies in the present study compared with earlier reports for PfEMP1 and total P. falciparum antigens. monoclonal antibodies did not recognize all VSAPAM-expressing lines. monoclonal antibodies produced by a control B-cell clone (D7) did not recognize any of the tested parasite lines. b 3D7 (Walliker et al., 1987) was originally cloned from, and appears genetically identical to, NF54 (Delemarre and Van der Kaay, 1979) c Line used in screening of B-cell supernatants for production of VSAPAM-specific IgG. n.d., not determined. immunofluorescence microscopy of unselected FCR3-CSA-infected erythrocytes labelled with PAM3.10 (top) or an irrelevant control antibody (bottom) F. Reactivity of PAM3.10 in Western blots of FCR3-CSA and FCR3. flow cytometry evidence of antibody reactivity with antigens on the surface of IEs expressing VSAPAM was confirmed. monoclonal antibodies were specific for members of the so far best-characterized family of VSA, PfEMP1 (Leech et al., 1984) this family includes VAR2CSA (predicted molecular weight: 355 kDa), which is the only PfEMP1 described so far that has the characteristics expected of VSAPAM (Salanti et al., 2003; 2004) monoclonal antibodies were used to detect surface-expressed 3D7-VAR2CSA domains on transfected Jurkat cells in a flow cytometry assay (Fig. 3A and Table 2). this pattern of reactivity was confirmed when the monoclonal antibodies were used to detect surface-expressed 3D7-VAR2CSA domains. competition ELISA to examine the epitopes recognized by the DBL3-X and DBL5--reactive monoclon monoclonal antibody Parasite Domain PAM1.4 PAM2.8 PAM3.10 PAM4.7 PAM5.2 PAM6.1 PAM7.5 PAM8.1 3D7 DBL3-X \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 DBL5- \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 FCR3 DBL3-X \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + \u2013 n.d. \u2013 n.d., not determined. PAM8.1-negative and -positive proteins were a C-terminal 16-amino-acid stretch that maps to a polymorphic region of 3D7-VAR2CSA DBL3-X. chimeric protein was transferred to the corresponding site in a PAM8.1-negative variant lacking this sequence. the 3D7 residues flanking the insert, G1474 and Q1475 (positions 26 and 39 in A) are highlighted in black. we tested the ability of PAM1.4 to enrich VSAPAM-expressing IEs in two parasite lines (EJ24 and EJ27) initially expressing non-PAM-type VSA. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the isolates showed increases in var2csa transcription in response to the selection for PAM1.4 reactivity. EJ24 acquired reactivity with the VAR2CSA-specific antibodies PAM2.8, PAM3.10, PAM6.1 and PAM7.5. mmune donors to estimate frequencies of P. falciparum-specific B cells. VSAPAM-specific memory B cells acquired in response to PAM primarily target polymorphic, conformation-dependent epitopes that are reproduced by Baculovirus-produced recombinant antigen constructs. PAM induces a high-frequency VSAPAM-specific memory B-cell response. a total of 5760 replicate cultures of 100 immortalized B cells per well were set up. a total of 5760 replicate cultures of 100 immortalized B cells per well were set up. supernatants from 105 of the polyclonal B-cell lines stained one or both of the VSAPAM-expressing lines. frequency of VSAPAM-reactive polyclonal supernatants varied from 6/1920 to 33/1344 [2.5%] in the three donors. eight clones produced antibodies recognizing antigens on the surface of erythrocytes infected by the VSAPAM-expressing lines. none of the monoclonal antibodies recognized the 3D7-SM control line not expressing VSAPAM. monoclonal antibodies did not recognize all VSAPAM-expressing lines. b 3D7 (Walliker et al., 1987) was originally cloned from, and appears genetically identical to, NF54. c Line used in screening of B-cell supernatants for production of VSAPAM-specific IgG. n.d., not determined. a. Labelling of FCR3-CSA, NF54-VAR2CSA and 3D7-SM by VSAPAM-specific monoclonal antibodies (\u2022) or an irrelevant control monoclonal antibody (\u2013) determined by flow cytometry. proteins were not detected when blots were probed with the monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibodies were used to probe Western blots of non-PAM-type VSAPAM-expressing parental lines. PAM8.1 was not tested by Western blotting with IEs expressing VSAPAM. but was tested with VAR2CSA-specific constructs. s and constructs from other PfEMP1 not implicated in the pathogenesis of PAM were consistently completely negative in ELISA. each of the VAR2CSA-reactive monoclonal antibodies had absolute specificity for either DBL3-X (PAM2.8, PAM6.1 and PAM8.1; also from two donors) this pattern of reactivity was confirmed when the monoclonal antibodies were used to detect surface-expressed 3D7-VAR2CSA domains on transf to express constructs B\u2013D, F\u2013H, J, K, M\u2013O, Q\u2013S, U\u2013Y by antibodies PAM2.8 (red), PAM3.10 (orange), PAM5.2 and PAM7.5 (green) and PAM6.1 (blue) are shown. ELISA to determine domain specificity of DBL5--reactive IgG. we cloned and sequenced 43 VAR2CSA DBL3-X domains from placental parasite isolates. a subset of 29 of these domains selected to represent the overall VAR2CSA DBL3-X diversity was expressed as Baculovirus recombinant proteins. the PAM2.8 antibody reacted with 25, PAM6.1 with eight and PAM8.1 with 20 of the domain variants. a. amino acid sequence in the region of the domain where interclonal variation affected PAM8.1 recognition of DBL3-X constructs from 29 genetically distinct P. falciparum isolates. the predicted loop region where parasite isolates recognized by PAM8.1 have a definite insertion compared with 3D7 is shown in red. in two parasite lines (EJ24 and EJ27) initially expressing non-PAM-type VSA and only marginally recognized by PAM1.4. a single round of PAM1.4 antibody selection of EJ27 and EJ24 resulted in rapid emergence of IEs uniformly recognized by PAM1.4 and expressing VSAPAM. gG in plasma from P. falciparum-exposed men and women and in plasma from non-exposed adults. VSAPAM-specific memory B cells acquired in response to PAM target polymorphic, conformation-dependent epitopes that are reproduced by recombinant antigen constructs. CSA-adhesive domains have been identified in the antigen. vaccine can elicit broadly reactive antibodies that block IE adhesion to CSA. but whether such antibodies are ever produced in humans remains unanswered questions. VSAPAM-expressing subline 3D7-BeWo was selected by repeated panning of IEs on the choriocarcinoma line BeWo. parasites were considered as expressing VSAPAM if the level of labelling of intact IEs by IgG in a panel of plasma samples from P. falciparum-exposed multigravid women was significantly higher than the level in plasma from sympatric men. ates EJ24 and EJ27 were obtained from the peripheral blood of pregnant, recently pregnant multiparous women. both isolates were selected for expression of VSA reacting with the human VSAPAM-specific monoclonal antibody PAM1.4. both isolates were selected for expression of VSA reacting with the human VSAPAM-specific monoclonal antibody PAM1.4.
