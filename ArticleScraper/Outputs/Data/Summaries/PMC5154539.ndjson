{"summary": "three anti-hCXCR5 mAb clones, 16D7, 79E7 and MAB190, were used to evaluate and compare these assay formats. the reversed peptide-based assay format was able to distinguish mAb 16D7 with an almost 10-fold slower Koff-rate. the reversed peptide-based assay format displayed good reproducibility. eptide flow over captured antibody (500 RUs) 16D7 Mean 4.80E+05 2.41E-04 5.03E-10 CV (%) 3.14E-02 1.02E-01 1.06E-01 79E7 Mean 1.88E+06 6.82E-04 3.65E-10 CV (%) 9.58E-02 4.25E-02 6.09E-02 MAB190 Mean 4.08E+05 2.70E-04 6.56E-10 CV (%) 8.08E-02 3.02E-01 2.69 the highest level of peptide (100 RU) did indeed alter the overall affinity (KD) mainly due to artificial Koff (9.85 108, Table 2). the highest level of peptide (100 RU) did indeed alter the overall affinity (KD) the reversed assay format lacks resolution due to the avidity effect. the development of a whole-receptor assay was able to address these issues. the human CXCR5 protein was purified as a mixture of monomer, dimer and trimer. chip surfaces with two different receptor densities (300 and 700 RUs) were prepared. chip surfaces with two different receptor densities (300 and 700 RUs) were prepared. human CD52 virus-like particles (VLPs) were prepared from 293FT cells. after western blot analysis to verify presence of CD52 in the VLP prep, VLPs containing CD52 were captured by the anti-CD52 antibody Alemtuzumab26 on a C1 chip surface. the capture of CD52 VLPs by Alemtuzumab is target specific. the post capture cross-linking step stabilizes CD52 in the VLP surface. the reversed peptide-based assay format was able to distinguish mAb 16D7 with an almost 10-fold slower Koff-rate (Table 1). the Kon-Koff rate map also indicated that this reversed peptide-based assay format displayed good reproducibility. affinity data generated by the reverse format were higher than the conventional assay format. however, the higher affinity data for the same antibody, at least in part, is attributed to the avidity effect. mAb Peptide Density* Data Kon (1/Ms) Koff (1/s) KD (M) 16D7 5 RU Mean 6.81E+05 4.71E-05 7.02E-11 CV (%) 5.14E-02 5.77E-01 6.15E-01 20 RU Mean 8.32E+05 2.70E-05 3.25E-11 CV (%) 3.26E-03 3.92E-01 3.93E-01 100 RU Mean 1.01E+06 9.85E-08 tandem 6xHis/HPC4 tag was added to the C-terminus of full-length human CXCR5 coding sequence. the human protein was purified as a mixture of monomer, dimer and trimer. the purified receptor was directly captured on an NTA SPR sensor chip via affinity capturing. three antibody samples as well as the ligand were well-differentiated by this assay format. the kinetics data shown in Table 3 further demonstrated the reliability of the assay regardless of the difference in receptor density. this limited chemical crosslinking step generated a stable chip surface with full ligand binding activity. human CD52 virus-like particles (VLPs) were prepared from 293FT cells. after western blot analysis, VLPs containing CD52 were captured by the anti-CD52 antibody Alemtuzumab26 on a C1 chip surface. the captured VLPs were then stabilized by the same approach. hek293FT negative control total cell lysates transiently expressing CD52. negative control VLP prep, 6. CD52 VLP prep from HEK293FT cells. western blotting with anti-CD52 antibody Alemtuzumab. over cross-linking with 200 NHS/50 M EDC resulted in significant loss of binding activity. in each case, similar results were obtained. therefore, we chose the 20 NHS/5 M EDC as our standard stabilization reagent. the receptor surface stabilized by this simple cross-linking step yielded sufficient binding capacity for analyzing both antibody and ligand binding. VLPs produced by recombinant expression systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been reported at 30\u201350 nM in size28. we also determined that the CD52 VLPs produced in HEK293FT cells were similar in size (30\u201350 nM, data not shown) it is presume that only a portion of the CD52 molecules displayed on VLP surface is bound by the capturing antibody. the same set of anti-hCXCR5 monoclonal antibodies used in the conventional assay was injected at various concentrations to generate kinetics sensorgrams. expression of hCXCR5 human CXCR5 receptor was expressed in Sf9 cells using the FastBac expression system (Invitrogen) highly purified membranes were solubilized by incubation in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-D-maltopyranoside (Sigma) and 0.01% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) (Sigma) for two to three hours at 4\u00b0C. after solubilization, the unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 g for 45 minutes the eluted receptor was buffer exchanged to 12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) DDM, 0.001% (w/v) CHS, 1 mM EDTA. the eluted receptor was buffer exchanged to 12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 5% ( 5 ligand and antibodies CXCL13 and 3 anti-hCXCR5 mAbs were tested in triplicate. all samples were injected at a flow rate of 50 l/min. full-length CD52 coding sequence was obtained. the rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (GE) was first immobilized on the chip surface via amine coupling to the free carboxyl groups on the CM5 chip surface using standard protocols provided by the manufacturer. the same set of anti-hCXCR5 monoclonal antibodies used in the conventional assay was injected at various concentrations to generate kinetics sensorgrams. hCXCR5 cells were harvested by centrifugation 72 hours post-infection. cells were initially disrupted by homogenization in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. receptor was eluted with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 800 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 55 mM imidazole, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.001% (w/v) CHS, and 200 mM imidazole. eluted receptor was buffer exchanged to 12.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl hCXCR5 ligand and antibodies CXCL13 and 3 anti-hCXCR5 mAbs were each tested in triplicate for binding to hCXCR5 in a running buffer. all samples were injected at a flow rate of 50 l/min. 52 antibody Alemtuzumab was immobilized and the captured VLPs were then captured at 1300 RU level. the captured VLPs were further stabilized by limited crosslinking using 20 M NHS/5 M EDC for 7 min."}
