{"summary": "RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) are catalytic components of the RNA genomic replication system encoded by RNA viruses. they are ubiquitous in these viruses, regardless of genomic structure. most RNA virus RdRps possess a conserved structural \u201ccupped right hand\u201d feature that includes finger, palm, and thumb subdomains (2). PRRSV, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) but absent in equine arteritis virus (EAV) (5, 6). PRRSV is typically divided into two genotypes, European (EU) type (genotype I) and North American (NA) type (genotype II), represented by the LV strain and the ATCC VR-2332 strain. a series of chimeric viruses were constructed by swapping the corresponding regions of HP-PRRSV and classical PRRSV. a series of mutant viruses were generated by swapping either single or double amino acids between the HP-PRRSV strain rHuN4 and the classical PRRSV rCH-1a strain. the alignment of all 204 NA-type PRRSV strains included in the study revealed consistent amino acid mutations in NSP9. classical PRRSV strains, including the VR-2332-related and CH-1a-related subgroups, typically possess a threonine and an alanine (A) at these two positions, respectively. in the intermediate HB-1(sh) 2002-related subgroup, both the mutant and prototype amino acid residues can be found at positions 519 and 544. the three-dimensional structure of PRRSV NSP9 was predicted using I-TASSER (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) the protein is comprised of two major sections, an N-terminal section at amino acid residues 1 to 180 and a C-terminal section formed of amino acid residues 181 to 646. two infectious cDNA clones of pHuN4 and pCH-1a were generated and validated. rHuN4 and rCH-1a cDNAs were digested with MluI. only one band (432 bp) was visible in the wild-type strains. rHuN4-S519T-T544A, rHuN4-S519T, and rHuN4-T544A each had a lower viral RNA copy number than rHuN4. the mutant viruses based on CH-1a (rCH-1a-T519S-A544T, rCH-1a-T519S, and rCH-1a-A544T) each had significantly higher viral RNA copy numbers rHuN4-S519T-T544A-infected cells had significantly lower viral RNA copy numbers than rHuN4 at 48 and 72 hpi. at 24, 36, and 96 hpi, the viral RNA copy number of rCH-1a-T519S-infected cells was significantly higher than that of rCH-1a.
