{"summary": "congenital malaria occurs at relatively low rates in malaria-endemic regions. it is a serious problem in Plasmodium falciparum\u2013endemic sub-saharan Africa. in low P. vivax\u2013endemic regions, immunity to vivax malaria is low. malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious parasitic disease that is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. it is estimated that 660,000 lives were lost to the disease in 2010 mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, a region hyperendemic for P. falciparum, the most virulent of the species that cause malaria in humans. 103 congenital malaria cases were reported by 61 medical articles in china. 103 cases of congenital malaria between 1915 and 2011 were reported in the medical literature. but because of language barriers, this valuable information has not been accessible to the malaria research community outside of China. the earliest report dates from 1963 and the latest was from 2010. the majority of the reports were published in the 1980s and 1990s. congenital malaria mainly occurred in the eastern, central, and southern regions of china. 96 cases of congenital malaria reported clinical symptoms. 78 had fever as the main presentation; only 27 described intermittent fever. other clinical presentations included anaemia, jaundice, paleness, diarrhoea, vomiting, weakness and inactivity. of 53 infants with congenital malaria for whom WBC counts were performed, ten infants had WBC>12.5109/L. 88 cases of congenital malaria in newborns whose ages at the onset of symptoms were recorded ranged from 1 to 50 days (median, 8 days) the age distribution was 4 to 126 days (median, 30 days) there were 103 congenital malaria cases reported by 61 medical articles in china. one case occurring in mainland china reported in English. the majority of the reports (81.73%) were published in the 1980s and 1990s. all diagnoses were performed by microscopy. in 85 cases, parasites were found initially in peripheral blood films. in nine cases, parasites were initially detected in bone marrow smears. moglobin concentrations (Hb) were recorded, 51 had Hb120 g/L, 43 had Hb90 g/L, 26 had Hb60 g/L and four had Hb30 g/L. of 53 infants with congenital malaria for whom BPCs were performed, ten infants had WBC>12.5109/L. guanil, guanil, and 28 were treated with unspecified antimalarial drug(s) one infant's family refused and halted treatment. another infant died two hours after diagnosis. congenital malaria in china was (and is) relatively rare. china's malaria hyperendemic period occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. cases of congenital malaria were more frequently reported in the 1980s and 1990s. this is possibly due to the fact that periodicals were routinely deposited in databases after 1979. 80.39% (41/51 cases) of the infants' livers were 2 cm below the right costal margin. 87.50% (35/40 cases) of the infants' spleens were enlarged 2 cm below the left costal margin. there was a considerable delay in the time taken to diagnose congenital malaria. congenital malaria of the neonate is intrinsically dependent on the malaria status of the mother. only three mothers of neonates diagnosed with congenital malaria reported no malaria symptoms. pregnant women are possibly more susceptible to malaria than nonpregnant women. 102 cases of congenital malaria were cured with antimalarial and symptomatic treatment. the main antimalarial drug was chloroquine (61.76%, 63/102 cases), effective due to the predominance of P. vivax in china. one infant died before antimalarial treatment commenced, and another infant was discharged. the most prominent symptom of congenital malaria was fever. most cases of neonatal malaria presented with fevers that did not closely resemble typical malaria paroxysms. malaria-endemic areas in china occur in underdeveloped and remote rural areas with very limited resources. most cases of neonatal malaria presented with fevers that did not closely resemble typical malaria paroxysms. surveillance for congenital malaria in infants whose mothers have been diagnosed as having malaria before labour began has not been noted or discussed in the literature. there is a need in the future for heightened vigilance of malaria screening in newborns born to mothers with malaria. active surveillance for congenital malaria in infants whose mothers have been diagnosed as having malaria before labour began has not been noted. there is a need in the future for heightened vigilance of malaria screening in newborns born to mothers with malaria."}
