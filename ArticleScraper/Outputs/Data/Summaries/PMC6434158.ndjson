{"summary": "a mismatch was observed between the R&D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. a new approach for allocating government R&D funding should be considered. major R&D budget of the MOHW was USD 435.1 million for 32 projects in 2018.2. research on principles for fund allocation identified some factors. METHODS We used the MOHW R&D budget data to examine the distribution of health R&D funds against the burdens of diseases in Korea. this study was funded by the MOHW to contextualize the global burden of disease study for the Korean population. each fund was classified in the most detailed manner. but some funds, such as the one for big data in healthcare, were also assigned to the non-disease specific group. we then categorized a wide range of disease clusters using the budget groups that could meet the burden of disease. non-disease specific budget refers to big data in healthcare, cutting edge medical technology development, medical device development, and so on. they accounted for roughly USD 275.8 million in 2018 and were excluded from our three diseases categories. the most salient findings were in the injuries and violence disease group. injuries and violence accounted for 10.1% of the total 2015 DALYs in the KNBD study, even higher than those of the communicable disease category. DALYs per 100,000 R&D cost, millions, USD HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis 133 - Diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, meningitis, other common infectious diseases 136 15.8 Neglected tropical diseases and malaria 3 - Maternal disorders 425 3.1 Neonatal disorders 49 - Nutritional deficiencies 59. DALY = disability adjusted life year, MOHW = Ministry of Health and Welfare, R&D = research and development. the budgets give greater weight to communicable diseases than to injuries and violence. the budgets are heavily skewed toward strengthening response capabilities. the economic burden of non-communicable diseases in Korea increased by around 65% from 2007 to 2015.10. the MOHW R&D budget for non-communicable diseases still favored neoplasms, and the burden of disease as well as other risk factors were not considered. a new process for allocating government\u2019s R&D funding should be seriously considered. the amount of the R&D budget for these non-disease specific categories is not small, at roughly USD 275.8 million. we compared the current burden of disease with economic burden, and other factors were not included in this study. the burden of disease from something such as MERS or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may be negligible from a global perspective. despite these limitations, this study provides evidence that prioritization of health-related R&D in Korea tends to be based on factors other than burden of disease."}
